The Court ordered Defendants to provide supplemental responses to Plaintiffs' discovery requests and to produce all documents and tangible things requested therein by 9/3/2010.

Defendants requested the Court enter a written order requiring Atlanta City Police named in this action to produce their cell phones; the Court denied that request. The oral order issued at the telephone conference on 8/20/2010 is sufficient. The deadline for the cell phone and electronic information production is 2 weeks from today. Plaintiffs orally moved for sanctions; the Court denied the motion but advised counsel that it would consider the sanctions issue after the Parties have completed discovery. Counsel who have not entered a notice of appearance in this case should do so immediately. (Court Reporter Montrell Vann)(alc) (Entered: 08/27/2010)"

At the end of the 120-day period, the City shall submit to the Court and to Plaintiffs a report reflecting the status of all open citizen complaints. For any noncompliant entries, the City should include a reason for noncompliance. If Plaintiffs remain dissatisfied with the City's efforts at compliance, they should submit a second motion for contempt after the 120-day period. While the Court is not inclined to require a remediation plan or additional production of documents at this juncture, continued failure by Defendants to comply with the consent order will likely result in the Court fully granting Plaintiffs' requested relief.

    "summary": "<p>On November 24, 2009, patrons of Atlanta Eagle, a gay bar in Atlanta, Georgia, filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against the City of Atlanta, the chief of police, and officers of the Atlanta Police Department in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. The plaintiffs, represented by private lawyer Dan Grossman, and public interest lawyers from Lambda Legal Defense and the Southern Center for Human Rights, asked the Court for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief to redress defendants' violations of plaintiffs' rights under the U.S. Constitution and Georgia Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that the police action was taken without any particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe that any individual was involved in any criminal activity. The plaintiffs also sought redress for the numerous state law torts committed by individual defendants, including false imprisonment, assault, battery, and trespass.</p><p>According to the complaint, on September 10 and 11, 2009, a paramilitary, SWAT-type force of Atlanta police officers entered the Atlanta Eagle without a warrant, claiming to be searching for public sex, drugs, and illegal weapons. The police forced dozens of bar patrons to lie face-down on the floor, which was covered with spilled beer, dirt, and broken glass. Officers allegedly made threats of violence and anti-gay slurs. Plaintiffs claim that although they were not suspected of any criminal activity, police officers emptied their pockets, confiscated their IDs, and entered every patron's name into a police computer. After the raid, not a single patron was charged with any crime, and no weapons, drugs, or evidence of sex was found.</p><p>In December 2010, the parties reached a settlement that required the Atlanta Police Department to rewrite their policies regarding arrest, search, and seizure, and to make other changes to protect the public from police misconduct. The settlement required, among other provisions: <ul> <li>Changes in search and seizure policy to accord with a set of legal principles spelled out in the settlement, covering the requirements for arrests, stops, and searches. </li> <li>All Atlanta police officers in uniform must wear a conspicuously visible nametag, and any Atlanta police officer who is in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of police authority must identify himself by name and badge number upon request at some point before the end of an encounter with a civilian.</li> <li>Atlanta police officers may not interfere in any way with a citizen's right to record police activity</li> <li>Payment of $1,025,000 by the City of Atlanta. </li></ul> </p><p>Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr. issued an order to approve the settlement agreement on December 8, 2010. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the City of Atlanta's compliance with the terms of the settlement if it failed to implement the actions set forth in the settlement agreement within 180 days of the entry of the order. </p><p>On June 16, 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions on the grounds that the Atlanta Police Department had not implemented the police reform policies outlined in the settlement agreement. The police department agreed to implement the policies if plaintiffs withdrew their motion for sanctions. </p><p>After three years of inactivity, on March 17, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt sanctions on the grounds that the police department had still not implemented police reform policies. The plaintiffs requested post-judgment discovery. On May 19, 2015, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion. </p><p>In response to a joint motion by the parties, the court ordered the appointment of a special master, Joe D. Whitley, on June 22, 2016 to monitor the Atlanta Police Department's compliance with court orders and assist the parties in addressing any obstacles with compliance or relevant discovery. On September 23, 2016, the court granted the parties' Consent Order Setting Forth Initial Special Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures. The consent order laid out detailed procedures for ensuring compliance and a feedback mechanism for the creation of a civil rights training program. The consent order also provided a detailed monitoring scheme. Further, all post-judgment discovery requests were stayed without prejudice. </p><p>In two 2016 status reports, Mr. Whitley found that the police department had complied or attempted in good faith to comply with the requirements of the court order. However, after six months, it became clear that there were existing areas of disagreement between the parties regarding the following elements of the court order: (1) the identification requirement for officers; (2) the requirement of no interference with audio or video recordings; (3) documentation of warrantless seizures and identification checks; and (4)  timely resolution of citizen complaints. But at that point, Mr. Whitley still believed that all of the issues could be resolved, particularly through increased communication between the parties. </p><p>After nine months had passed, however, Mr. Whitley determined that there were fundamental disagreements between the parties regarding the court order's requirements and how compliance should be evaluated. At Mr. Whitley's urging, on July 25, 2017, the Court issued two orders: one requiring that the police department show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the court order and another requiring that the department show cause as to why it is entitled to relief from any of the court order's provisions. </p><p>On September 25, 2017, the police department filed a motion to disqualify the special master and reassign matters to the district court, as well as an emergency motion to stay the special master's activities. However, the court did not grant the emergency motion and the special master continued to carry out his responsibilities. And on November 28, 2017, the court denied the police department's motion to disqualify the special master and adopted his October 2017 status report.</p><p>On February 12, 2018, the court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by responding to the police department's emergency petition. The court called for briefing and a special master report and recommendation on the issue of whether the attorneys' fees sought were reasonable. </p><p>Throughout 2018, the parties engaged in extensive settlement discussions with the goal of reaching an agreement with respect to the show cause order on contempt issues and the police department's compliance with the original settlement agreement. They proposed a new consent order on November 28, 2018, and the court approved it the following day. </p><p>The order required the police department to modify 1) training procedures; 2) standard operating procedures; 3) handing citizen complaints; 4) \"stop and think\" forms; and 5) identification procedures. It also provided the plaintiffs the right to engage in post-judgment discovery, and the right to address any failure to comply in court. Additionally, the city agreed to pay the plaintiffs attorneys' fees. </p><p>The case remains open such that the parties may resume litigation if the defendants fail to comply with the consent order. </p>",

      "text": "Case 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 1 of 23\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nATLANTA DIVISION \n \nGEOFFREY CALHOUN, et al.,   \n   \nPlaintiffs,   \n  CIVIL ACTION FILE \nv.   \n  NO. 1:09-cv-3286-TCB \nRICHARD PENNINGTON, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nO R D E R \n  This case comes before the Court on the City of Atlantaโs motion \n[375] to reassign matters to the district court from the special master \nand upon the special masterโs October 13 status report [391]. The Cityโs \nmotion is denied and the special masterโs October 13 status report is \nadopted as modified in this Order. \nI.  Background \nThis case arises from the illegal search and detainment of \nPlaintiffs by the Atlanta Police Department (โAPDโ) during a raid of the \nAtlanta Eagle bar in September 2009. The Court entered a consent \njudgment on December 8, 2010 (the โ2010 Orderโ) resolving the lawsuit \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 2 of 23\nand settling Plaintiffsโ claims by, inter alia, requiring payment of a \nmonetary judgment and enjoining the APD to implement a number of \nreforms to their police operations. \nA year later, the City had not complied with the 2010 Order. This \nresulted in post-judgment motions and another consent order entered \nby the Court on December 15, 2011 (the โ2011 Orderโ). The 2011 Order \nrestated the injunctive obligations of the City to reform the APD.  \nFour years later, Plaintiffs filed additional post-judgment motions \nfor contempt against the City for failure to comply with the Courtโs \nprevious orders and the ongoing injunction. On May 19, 2015, after a \nhearing on Plaintiffsโ second motion for contempt, the Court granted the \ncontempt motion and once again ordered the City to undertake certain \nreforms and also to pay Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees for bringing the \ncontempt motion (the โ2015 Orderโ). The 2015 Order did not modify the \n2010 Order or 2011 Order.  \nOn June 20, 2016, the parties made a joint motion [308] to appoint \na special master pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, which \nthis Court granted [309] on June 22. This resulted in a consent order \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 3 of 23\n[323] setting forth the role and function of the special master, which \nwas modified by another consent order [339] (collectively, the โSpecial \nMaster Ordersโ). \nThe parties jointly agreed to appoint Joe Whitley as special \nmaster, who has been serving pursuant to the Special Master Orders \nand Rule 53. Under the Special Master Orders the special master \npresides over and investigates the Cityโs compliance with the Courtโs \norders. This includes reviewing implementation of training procedures, \npresiding over and resolving discovery disputes, making determinations \nand recommendations to the Court regarding the necessity of sanctions, \nand providing the Court with quarterly reports regarding the Cityโs \ncompliance. These powers are exercised consistent with the special \nmasterโs appointment under the Special Master Orders and Rule 53.  \nThe special master has performed this function for over a year. In \nhis most recent compliance reports, dated July 14 [346] and October 13 \n[391], the special master indicates that while progress has been made, \nthe Cityโs compliance with the Courtโs orders is still a future prospect. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 4 of 23\nWhat is worse, it appears that the resolution of this case has all but \nstalled and relations between the parties have deteriorated.  \nOn September 7, 2017, the special master moved [359] for the \nCourt to renew and modify certain of the Special Master Orders. The \nCity objected, and filed the instant motion [375] to disqualify the special \nmaster as well as an โemergencyโ motion to stay the special masterโs \nactivities. The Court denied both the special masterโs motion and the \nCityโs emergency motion, and directed the special master to continue in \nhis role while the Court reviewed the Cityโs motion [375] to disqualify.1 \nThe special master responded [381] to the Cityโs disqualification \nmotion, filed his last quarterly compliance report dated October 13 \n[391], and provided the Court with recommendations for moving the \ncase forward. \nOther issues persist and will be addressed in subsequent orders. \nFor now, the most pertinent issue before the Court is whether the \nspecial master will be disqualified. As explained below, the Court does \nnot believe that the special master should be disqualified. Accordingly, \n                                      \n1 Plaintiffs oppose disqualification [380]. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 5 of 23\nthe Court will not reassign matters now pending before the special \nmaster to the Court. This Order also prescribes the next steps, \nparticularly as they relate to the Courtโs show-cause orders [347โ48]. \nII.  Disqualification of the Special Master \nIt is well-settled that acceptance of an appointment as a special \nmaster entails accepting โthe duties and obligations of a judicial \nofficer.โ In re Gilbert, 276 U.S. 6, 9 (1928); see also Hoffman v. EMI \nResorts, Inc., 689 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1374 (S.D. Fla. 2010). As judicial \nofficers, โ[m]asters are subject to the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges, with exceptions spelled out in the Code.โ FED. R. CIV. P. \n53(a)(2)โ(3) advisory committeeโs notes to 2003 amendments. โThe \nstandard of [a masterโs] disqualification is established by 28 U.S.C.  \nยง 455.โ Id. โA master must not have a relationship to the parties, \nattorneys, action, or court that would require disqualification of a judge \nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 455, unless the parties, with the courtโs approval, \nconsent to the appointment after the master discloses any potential \ngrounds for disqualification.โ Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Tien, 598 F. Appโx \n613, 616 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 53(a)(2)). Thus, ยง 455 \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 6 of 23\nguides the Courtโs analysis of whether Special Master Whitley should \nbe disqualified. \nThe City argues that pursuant to ยง 455(a),2 the special master \nshould be disqualified because โhis impartiality might reasonably be \nquestioned.โ [375] at 1. This argument is based on the special masterโs \nSeptember 7 motion [359] for an order โrenewing certain obligations set \nforth by consent procedures order.โ The City argues that the special \nmasterโs request to modify the Special Master Orders evinces his bias. \nThe circumstances giving rise to the special masterโs motion came \nabout after the Court ordered the City to show cause on two issues upon \nrecommendation by the special master in his July 14 status report \n[346]. The Court ordered the City to show cause as to (1) why it should \nnot be held in contempt of the Courtโs previous orders, see [347], and (2) \nwhy the City believes it is entitled to relief from the Courtโs previous \norders, see [348]. The Court directed the special master to receive \nbriefing and hold a hearing on the first contempt issue and to receive \n                                      \n2 The City also raises a disqualification charge under 28 U.S.C. ยง 455(b)(1). \nBecause this argument was raised for the first time in a reply, it will not be \nconsidered. See United States v. Martinez, 83 F.3d 371, 377 n.6 (11th Cir. 1996). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 7 of 23\nbriefing on the second relief issue. The special master was instructed to \nprovide a report and recommendation on both issues.3  \nA flurry of docket activity has ensued since this time, including \nthe special masterโs motion about which the City complains. The City \nargues that by filing a motion to renew the special master procedures, \nrather than depending solely upon a report and recommendation, the \nspecial master has shown his hand as to how he would rule on the \nshow-cause issues, and thus made a prejudgment against the City. In \nthe Cityโs words, โthe Special Master is advocating a position on \nremedies in direct opposition to the position taken by the City, and \npremises the position upon his predetermination that the City is \nsubstantively not in compliance with the [Courtโs orders].โ [375] at 5. \nThe City believes the special master cannot now be impartial in making \na recommendation to the Court on the show-cause issues.  \n  โUnder ยง 455(a), recusal is appropriate only if โan objective, \ndisinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the \n                                      \n3 Some deadlines for resolving these issues have passed. This Order revises \nthe procedures and deadlines regarding the resolution of the show-cause orders \n[347โ48]. See infra at 19โ23.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 8 of 23\ngrounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant \ndoubt about the judgeโs impartiality.โโ United States v. Amadeo, 487 \nF.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added) (citation omitted in \noriginal) (quoting United States v. Patti, 337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. \n2003)). โ[A]ny doubts must be resolved in favor of recusal.โ Patti, 337 \nF.3d at 1321 (citation omitted).  \n  But the evidence forming the basis of a recusal motion must be \ncompetent to that end. The actions of the special master the City \ncomplains about were judicial in nature, and โjudicial rulings alone \nalmost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.โ \nLiteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994). This is known as the \nโextrajudicial source doctrine,โ which the Supreme Court has held \napplies to ยง 455(a). Id. at 554. To the extent that there is any \nimpropriety in a judicial ruling, the appropriate remedy is to appeal \nthat ruling rather than to seek disqualification of the judge who \nrendered it. See id. at 555 (โAlmost invariably, [judicial rulings] are \nproper grounds for appeal, not recusal.โ).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 9 of 23\nWhen a disqualification motion is asserted based on some \nexpressed opinion of the judge, the Supreme Court has explained that  \nopinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced \nor events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, \nor of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or \npartiality motion unless they display a deep-seated \nfavoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment \nimpossible. \n \nId. at 555 (emphasis added).  \nUnder these rules, the City has not carried its burden of showing \nthe special masterโs bias because the special masterโs motion is subject \nto the extrajudicial source doctrine. Though styled a โmotion,โ it was \neffectively a sua sponte recommendation to the Court to temporarily \nextend and modify the procedures in the Special Master Orders. The \nmotion had no binding effect until ruled on by the Court, the City had \nan opportunity to (and did) object to the motion, and the Court \nultimately denied it. It would also be subject to the special masterโs \nfinal report and recommendation, and ultimately, the Courtโs scrutiny. \nThe appropriate remedy was for the City to appeal to the Court to \nintervene, which it did and the Court ruled in the Cityโs favor because \nthe relief sought by the special master was not necessary at the time. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 10 of 23\nBecause the City can point to no other, extrajudicial evidence of the \nspecial masterโs bias, its bias charge cannot be sustained.4  \nMoreover, the special masterโs actions hardly demonstrate a deep-\nseated favoritism or antagonism against the City. And it is far from \nclear that the renewal motion rendered the special masterโs fair \njudgment โimpossible.โ Id.  \nThe Cityโs allegations of bias are also contradicted by the special \nmasterโs record in this case. The special master has ruled myriad times \nin the Cityโs favor on issues brought before him. For example, the \nspecial master reported in favor of the City on a dispute over whether \nthe City had complied with the Calhoun training requirements over \nPlaintiffsโ objections that they had not approved the training. See [324] \nat 5โ8; see also [325] at 7 (reporting the Cityโs technical and substantial \ncompliance with the Calhoun training requirement); [346] at 2 (charting \nfive separate instances where the Cityโs compliance issues are marked \nas โresolvedโ). The special masterโs practice has been to give the City \n                                      \n4 The City also complains that the special masterโs motion sought to \nimproperly modify the consent orders in this case. Because the Court denied the \nspecial masterโs motion, it considers this argument moot. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 11 of 23\nthe benefit of the doubt by finding in certain instances that the City \ntechnically complied with the Courtโs orders contingent upon ongoing \nfactual development. See [325] at 7 (regarding Calhoun training); id. at \n17 (regarding amendments to APD standard operating procedures); \n[341] at 5โ7 (regarding revocation or amendment of unconstitutional \npolicies). It is only now that the City believes the special master could \nrule against it that it questions the special masterโs impartiality. The \ncharges ring hollow, as the special masterโs reports to the Court have \nconsistently demonstrated an even-handed demeanor toward both sides \nas they litigate issues related to compliance with the Court orders.  \nAllegations of bias are also inconsistent with the special masterโs \ndesire that the parties be heard before ruling on pending issues. See \n[346-1] at 2; see also [381] at 3. These issues include the show-cause \nissues, which the City asserts the special master is now disqualified \nfrom presiding over because of his renewal motion.  \n  Even if the special masterโs motion expressed a sense that the \nCity was non-compliant prior to a fuller hearing on the issue, there is no \nrule against the special master forming an impression, contrasted with \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 12 of 23\na prejudgment, about the status of the case over which he is appointed. \nJudges do this every day. Nor is the special master forbidden from \nacting upon his impressions as he fulfills his role in moving the case \nforward. It just may not affect his judgment on the merits. Here, the \nspecial masterโs motion was an interim measure; it was neither \nintended to nor did supplant his ruling on the merits. \nIn response to the Cityโs motion, the special master explains the \nmotivation behind his filing the renewal motion: โ[T]he limited \nprocedural reforms sought by the Special Master were intended to \nprovide a โstop-gapโ to certain procedures that were sun-setting but \ncontinue to be viewed by the Special Master as essential to the \nperformance of his duties.โ [381] at 9. To the special master, there \nremained a number of miles to go and he was running out of track as he \nperformed his monitoring, presiding, and adjudicating duties pursuant \nto the Courtโs orders; so, he sought the Courtโs intervention.5 And while \n                                      \n5 As the Court has noted, this intervention was premature. There appears to \nbe a mistaken impression that the special masterโs term was limited to a twelve-\nmonth period. This is unsupported by the Special Master Orders. The only time-\nlimited aspects of the special masterโs appointment are the dates by which he was \nto provide quarterly compliance reports, the last one of which was to be provided \nbased on the Cityโs reports to the special master due in September 2017. See [323] \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 13 of 23\nthe Court disagreed that the order sought by the special master was \nnecessary, the request did not constitute or reflect prejudice against the \nCity.  \nThe special masterโs actions are no different than a judge issuing \norders based on what he learned while presiding over a case. Cf. In re \nGrand Jury Proceedings, 559 F.2d 234, 237 (5th Cir. 1977) \n(โ[Disqualifying prejudice] must stem from an extrajudicial source and \nthat prejudice and bias must result in an opinion on the merits on some \nbasis other than what the Judge was exposed to in his participation in \nthis case.โ). A judge often makes procedural decisions based on his \nimpression of the case, but this does not amount to bias. Similarly, \nSpecial Master Whitley sought to keep the case moving and maintain \nthe status quo by modifying the procedures consistent with his view of \nthe needs of the case. His decision was reviewable upon objection and \ndriven by benign motivation. Thus, he should not be disqualified from \ncontinuing to serve as special master. \n                                                                                                                        \nat 9. Otherwise, the special master continues to fulfill his role under the Special \nMaster Orders and other orders of the Court until ordered to do otherwise. This \nremains the case, and though the special masterโs quarterly reporting duties have \nexpired, his role continues. See [377].  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 14 of 23\nThe D.C. Circuit case cited by the City does not require a different \nconclusion. It is both non-binding and distinguishable. In Cobell v. \nNorton, 334 F.3d 1128 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the D.C. Circuit held that the \ndistrict court abused its discretion by re-appointing a monitor as a \nspecial master over the Government-defendantโs objection. The \ncircumstances in Cobell are much more egregious than in this case. \nFirst, the Cobell master, unlike Special Master Whitley, was not \ninitially appointed as a special master; he was simply a court monitor. \nSee id. at 1133. The court of appeals took issue with the fact that the \ndistrict court, over objection, elevated the monitor to the role of \nmasterโa role entirely uncontemplated by and inconsistent with his \noriginal appointment. See id. at 1143โ44. \nContrastingly, Special Master Whitleyโs power has not been so \naggrandized. He was appointed by consent of the parties, and from the \noutset he exercised the power of a master under Rule 53. His powers, \nwhile partly dealing with monitoring, also include presiding over and \nmaking rulings and recommendations pursuant to the Special Master \nOrders. The show-cause orders are just such an example because in his \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 15 of 23\nJuly 14 status report, the special master made a recommendation to the \nCourt to issue show-cause orders, and the Court adopted the \nrecommendation. See [346] at 41โ42. Indeed, the City has not argued \nthat the special master lacked adjudicatory power ab initio; its \nargument for disqualification is primarily based on the special masterโs \nrecent docket activity. Special Master Whitley, unlike the Cobell \nmonitor, has been functioning as a judicial officer for the duration of his \ntenure. And no evidence from outside his judicial tenure has been \nproffered to disqualify him. \nAnother distinction between this case and Cobell is that the Cobell \nmonitorโs initial appointment was time-limited to one year. Id. at 1140. \nBut the district court extended the monitorโs service to a more \nindefinite term as special master over the Governmentโs objection. Id. \nThe D.C. Circuitโs holding that the district court abused its discretion \nwas derived both from the improper extension of the monitorโs temporal \nservice and the enlargement of his power beyond the scope of the \nconsent order appointing him. No such arguments can be levied against \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 16 of 23\nSpecial Master Whitley. He was appointed to an indefinite term, and \nhis powers have not been enlarged since his appointment.  \nFinally, the impropriety alleged by the Cobell appellants \nsurpasses that alleged by the City. The Government in Cobell \ncomplained about significant ex parte contact and communication by \nthe monitor, which undermined his impartiality. That is, by virtue of \nextrajudicial activity the Cobell monitor had disqualified himself.  \nAs already noted, the City cries foul regarding Special Master \nWhitley based only on judicial, on-the-record declarations. The Cityโs \narguments that the special masterโs ex parte contact disqualifies him is \nunavailing because, as permitted under ยง 455, the parties consented to \na certain level of ex parte contact by the special master in the special \nmasterโs initial appointment. See [308] at 4; [309] at 4. Thus, the parties \nconsidered that the special masterโs function would entail some limited \nex parte contact, provided notice is given to the other side, in order to \nfacilitate the unique circumstances of the special masterโs appointment. \nMoreover, the scale of ex parte contacts and enlarged and unchecked \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 17 of 23\ninvestigatory power of the Cobell monitor does not compare easily to the \nspecial masterโs function in this case. \nThe City has not shown how the special masterโs activities in this \ncase justify his disqualification. The City has pointed only to the special \nmasterโs actions that were (a) within the context of on-the-record, \njudicial activities; (b) substantially justified in light of the special \nmasterโs experience in his quasi-judicial role; and (c) consistent with the \nSpecial Master Orders and Rule 53. None of these actions support his \ndisqualification. \nIII.  Reassignment from the Special Master to the Court \nBecause the Court denies the Cityโs motion to disqualify the \nspecial master, it follows that there is no reason based on 28 U.S.C.  \nยง 455 for the Court to reassign matters from the special master. \nThe City also asserts that reassignment is warranted pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 1, which states that the Federal Rules \nโshould be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the \nparties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 18 of 23\nevery action and proceeding.โ The Court is not persuaded by this \nargument. \nFirst, the City does not cite any authority that ties the admonition \nin Rule 1 to a justification for reassignment of a case from a special \nmaster to the Court when the special master has achieved more than a \nyearโs experience presiding over the case.  \nSecond, the Court does not believe that the City has adequately \nexplained how it would be any more just or speedy or inexpensive for \nthe Court, rather than the special master, to administer this case. This \nis especially true when the City consented to the special masterโs \nappointment and the attendant procedures authorizing his activities in \nthis case.  \nThe Court is satisfied that the special master has done an \nexcellent job. Over the past year he and his authorized staff have spent \nhundreds of hours overseeing, refereeing, and managing this \nlanguishing case. He has reviewed a raft of documents, including \nprimary evidence and briefing, regarding the Cityโs compliance. His \nreports and recommendations to the Courtโtotaling nearly two-\n18 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 398   Filed 11/28/17   Page 19 of 23\nhundred pages at last countโhave been an exceptional resource that \nkeeps this case in forward motion. It would be a waste of judicial \nresources to reassign matters from him now, and in fact, would likely be \ninconsistent with Rule 1 to do so.  \nThis case has already gone seven years past judgment, and in \nlight of the Cityโs contemptuous noncompliance to date, much of this \nderives from the Cityโs own malfeasance. Consequently, it is plenty just \nfor the City to continue to pay for compliance monitoring until it \ndemonstrates that compliance has been achieved, rather than shifting \nthe burden to the Court and thereby diverting the Courtโs attention \nfrom its service to other parties. \nIV.  Conclusion \nThe Cityโs motion [375] to reassign matters from the special \nmaster is denied. The special master will continue to perform his role \nand exercise authority consistent with the Special Master Orders and \nRule 53. The Court also adopts the special masterโs October 13, 2017 \nstatus report [391] as modified below.

For \nthe reasons stated below, the Court adopts the R&R [386] to the extent \nit is consistent with this Order and overrules the Cityโs objections [352]. \n     \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 2 of 14\nI.  Background \nThe facts giving rise to this case are more thoroughly set forth in \nthis Courtโs order [398] denying the Cityโs motion to reassign matters \nfrom the special master to the district court. The specific events as they \npertain to this Order are as follows. \nIn December 2010, the parties entered into a consent order (the \nโ2010 Orderโ) settling a lawsuit regarding the Atlanta Police \nDepartmentโs (โAPDโ) unconstitutional search of an Atlanta nightclub. \nThe 2010 Order set forth a number of reforms the City was required to \nundertake in order to remediate the unlawful practices of its police \nforce. See [265]. In 2011, the City consented to the entry of another \norder (the โ2011 Orderโ) due to its noncompliance with the 2010 Order. \nSee [280]. The City was later held in contempt of the Courtโs prior \norders in 2015 (the โ2015 Orderโ). See [289]. The Court refers to the \naforementioned orders as the โCalhoun judgments,โ and the related \nproceedings as the โCalhoun proceedings.โ  \nThe 2015 Order required that the โCity of Atlanta shall reimburse \nPlaintiffsโ counsel for any reasonable fees and costs they expend in \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 3 of 14\nensuring compliance with the Orders of this Court,โ which included \nspecific tasks for which Plaintiffsโ counsel would be reimbursed, though \nreimbursement was not limited solely to those tasks. [289] ยถ 12. One of \nthe Plaintiffsโ primary tasks was to serve as a monitor of the Cityโs \ncompliance with the Calhoun judgments. See generally id.  \n The parties subsequently agreed to the appointment of Joe \nWhitley, Esq., as special master, who has been coordinating, presiding \nover, and monitoring this action and the Cityโs compliance with the \nCalhoun judgments. See [308, as modified by 309]. The special master \nhas assumed the role of assisting the Court with the resolution of the \ngrowing number of disputes between the Plaintiffs and the City during \nthe course of the Calhoun proceedings. \nThe question now before the Court is whether the City of Atlanta \nis obligated to pay Plaintiffsโ counselโs fees expended in defending \nagainst an emergency petition for relief filed by the City on January 17, \n2017. The emergency petition sought to disqualify certain of Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel in various suits against the City, including the Calhoun \nproceedings. As a new civil action, it was assigned to Judge Richard W. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 4 of 14\nStory, who dismissed it as โprocedurally improper.โ Calhoun v. City of \nAtlanta, No. 1:17-cv-530-RWS, at *8 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 3, 2017), ECF No. \n15.  \nThe R&R recommends that the Court hold that Plaintiffs are \nentitled to reasonable attorneysโ fees as a prevailing party under 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 1988. The City objects, asserting that it is under no obligation \nto pay Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ fees in connection with the emergency \npetition. \nII.  Standard of Review of a Special Masterโs R&R \nThe standard of review for a special masterโs report is set forth in \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 53, unless the Court or parties have \nagreed otherwise. Here, they have not. \nWhen reviewing a special masterโs factual conclusions, a โcourt \nmust decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made or \nrecommended by a master.โ FED. R. CIV. P. 53(f)(3). Factual findings not \nobjected to will be reviewed for clear error. See Martin v. Univ. of S. \nAla., 911 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1990) (โ[F]indings of fact made by a \nSpecial Master must be accepted by the district court unless clearly \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 5 of 14\nerroneous.โ). Similarly, โ[t]he court must decide de novo all objections to \nconclusions of law made or recommended by a master.โ FED. R. CIV. P. \n53(f)(4).  \nAfter reviewing the special masterโs factual and legal conclusions \nunder the appropriate standard, the Court โmay adopt or affirm, \nmodify, wholly or partly reject or reverse, or resubmit [them] to the \nmaster with instructions.โ Id. at 53(f)(1).  \nIII.  Discussion \nThe special master concluded that Plaintiffs were entitled to fees \nincurred by defending against the Cityโs emergency petition. The Court \nfirst reviews the law applicable to the recoverability of fees in a ยง 1983 \ncase and post-judgment proceedings. It then deals with the Cityโs \nobjections to the R&R. \nA.  The Standard for Awarding Attorneysโ Fees in a ยง 1983 \nAction \n \nThe special master correctly concluded that in civil rights cases \nbrought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, an award of attorneysโ fees is governed \nby 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988. Section 1988(b) provides that โthe court, in its \ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonably attorneyโs \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 6 of 14\nfee as part of the costs . . . .โ In order for Plaintiffs to be considered a \nprevailing party, there must be a โcourt-ordered . . . โmaterial alteration \nof the legal relationship of the parties.โโ Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, \nInc. v. W. Va. Depโt of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 604 (2001) \n(quoting Tex. Teachers Assโn v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 792โ\n93 (1989)). Because the Calhoun judgments altered the legal \nrelationship between Plaintiffs and the City, there is no dispute that \nPlaintiffs are entitled to attorneysโ fees for their efforts related to the \nCalhoun judgments.  \nB.  Recovery for Post-Judgment Attorneysโ Fees \n \nPlaintiffs are undoubtedly entitled to fees for their efforts in \nobtaining the Calhoun judgments. But the Calhoun judgments do not \nautomatically grant fees for every proceeding between the City and \nPlaintiffs after the judgments were entered. Therefore, to determine \nwhether a fee award for the emergency petition proceedings is \nappropriate, the Court must resolve first whether fees related to post-\njudgment proceedings are recoverable, and then, whether the \nemergency petition proceedings fall within that category of proceedings. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 7 of 14\n \nThe Eleventh Circuit has permitted fees to be recovered without \nobtaining another victory on the merits in a later proceeding in the \nsame action. In Turner v. Orr, 785 F.2d 1498 (11th Cir. 1986), post-\njudgment fees were recoverable if incurred to monitor or enforce the \nother (losing) partyโs compliance with the underlying judgment because \nsuch efforts were considered to flow from the underlying decree. See \nalso Adams v. Mathis, 752 F.2d 553, 554 (11th Cir. 1985) (โ[A] party \nwho โvindicates important rights [including post-trial vindication] \nโprevailsโ for purposes of [42 U.S.C.A.] ยง 1988 even though he or she \ndoes so without obtaining a formal judicial order.โโ (some alterations in \noriginal)). Moreover, as in Turner, 785 F.2d at 1503, the City has \nalready agreed to pay such fees โby contract,โ see [289 ยถ 12].  \nAlthough Buckhannon, decided after Turner, requires a legal \nalteration in the partiesโ relationship in order to be considered a \nprevailing party in the original action, the Court agrees with the special \nmaster and its sister court that Buckhannon did not disturb the \nEleventh Circuitโs precedent regarding post-judgment fee awards. That \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 8 of 14\nis, after obtaining a favorable outcome in the underlying suit, a party \nengaged in post-judgment proceedings does not have to show that the \nlater proceedings โyield[ed] additional court-ordered reliefโ to be \nawarded fees under ยง 1988. Laube v. Allen, 506 F. Supp. 2d 969, 998 \n(M.D. Ala. 2007) (citing Miller v. Carson, 628 F.2d 346, 348โ49 (5th Cir. \n1980)). However, the post-judgment fees are still required to be \nโreasonably related to the claims upon which plaintiffs were definitely \nsuccessful [and] . . . no doubt ha[ve] the effect of maintaining \ncompliance with the Courtโs [order].โ Turner, 752 F.2d at 1504 (some \nalterations in original) (quoting Miller, 628 F.2d at 348). \nAccordingly, to qualify as a post-judgment proceeding for fee-\naward purposes, Plaintiffs must show that their efforts related to the \nemergency petition (1) were reasonably related to the Calhoun \njudgments, and (2) had the effect of maintaining compliance with the \nCalhoun judgments. The Court finds that both elements are met. \nFirst, the emergency petition proceedings were not only related to \nthe Calhoun judgments, they were in large part based upon them. The \nCity filed its emergency petition in order to address the Plaintiffsโ \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 9 of 14\nbehavior in a number of lawsuits, including Calhoun. Judge Story \nrecognized the petitionโs relation to Calhoun when he dismissed it on \nthe grounds that the relief requested is more appropriately addressed \nhere, rather than in a separate petition. \nSecond, by responding and appearing in the emergency petition \nproceedings, Plaintiffsโ effort also had the effect of maintaining \ncompliance with the Calhoun judgments. As part of the Calhoun \njudgments, this Court appointed Plaintiffs as monitors of the Cityโs \ncompliance. The Cityโs emergency petition sought to undermine their \nrole as monitor. In order to protect this role, Plaintiffs necessarily had \nto respond to the emergency petition.  \n1.  The Cityโs First Objection: The Emergency \nPetition Was a Separate Action  \n \nThe Court is not convinced by the Cityโs objections that a fee \naward for the emergency petition proceedings is improper because the \nemergency petition was an entirely separate action from the Calhoun \nproceedings. \nAs a matter of form, the emergency petition was, of course, a \nseparate action from the instant case. To hold otherwise would defy \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 10 of 14\nreality. The emergency petition had a different judge, different \nschedule, and its own case number. But to say that this technical \ndistinctiveness is dispositive as to whether attorneysโ fees should be \nawarded would elevate form over substance. \nAs Judge Story noted, the Cityโs petition for relief was not \nproperly before him; rather, it should have been raised with the \npresiding judge. Calhoun, No. 1:17-cv-530-RWS, at *4โ5. In this case, \nthe presiding judge is the undersigned. If the emergency petition had \nbeen properly raised, it would have been in this case, before this judge. \nIn other words, if the petition were properly raised, the Cityโs objection \nthat the petition is separate from the Calhoun proceedings would have \nlittle merit, and Plaintiffsโ claim to fees would be clear. \nThe City cannot escape its obligation to pay Plaintiffsโ attorneysโ \nfees simply by filing collateral actions like the emergency petition. This \nwould create a perverse incentive to file a new action whenever a losing \nparty in an underlying judgment is on the hook for the other partyโs \nfees. Such gamesmanship would foster inefficiency and stall the Courtโs \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 11 of 14\ndocket. Thus, the Court rejects the Cityโs argument that the emergency \npetition is rightly considered a separate action from this case.  \n2.  The Cityโs Remaining Objections \nThe City cites North Carolina Department of Transportation v. \nCrest Street Community Council, Inc., 479 U.S. 6 (1986), for the \nproposition that fees related to the emergency petition are unavailable \nbecause it was not a civil rights action. But this is a red herring. Crest \nStreet held that โonly a court in an action to enforce one of the civil \nrights laws listed in ยง 1988 may award fees.โ Id. at 15. The question \nhere is whether this Court can award fees in this case, not the \nemergency petition. This case was based on ยง 1983, one of the civil \nrights law listed in ยง 1988. Thus, this Court has the power to award \nfees. \nSimilarly, the Court rejects the Cityโs contention that because \nJudge Story did not reach the merits of the emergency petition, \nattorneysโ fees are unavailable. This misses the point: the authority to \naward attorneysโ fees in this case is based on the Calhoun judgments, \nnot the emergency petition. The Calhoun judgments have already \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 12 of 14\nopened the font of attorneysโ fees as between Plaintiffs and the City. See \nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 111โ12 (1992) (โ[T]o qualify as a \nprevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief \non the merits of his claim. The plaintiff must obtain an enforceable \njudgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought, or \ncomparable relief through a consent decree or settlement.โ (citations \nomitted)). The only question now is whether the fee-waters flow all the \nway down the course of the post-judgment proceedings to the emergency \npetition. As discussed above, the Court holds that they do. \nThe City also objects on the basis that Judge Story finally decided \nthe issue of Plaintiffsโ fees with respect to the emergency petition by \nruling against them on their Rule 11 motion for sanctions. That \ndecision, however, has no bearing on entitlement to attorneysโ fees \npursuant to the Calhoun judgments and ยง 1988.  \nFinally, the Court rejects the Cityโs objection that the special \nmaster lacks the authority to determine whether Plaintiffs are entitled \nto a fee award. The special master did not overstep his jurisdiction, as \nhe made recommendations regarding the propriety of a fee award in \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 13 of 14\nthis case, over which he has jurisdiction. Cf. generally [377, 398]. He did \nnot purport to decide a matter in Judge Storyโs case, nor did he \neffectively overrule a sitting district court judge, as the City intimates. \nThe authority to award attorneysโ fees stems from the Calhoun \njudgments, not the emergency petition. Thus, the special master \nproperly considered and made a report and recommendation to this \nCourt on issues properly before him. \nIV.  Conclusion \nThe Court adopts as its Order the R&R [386] to the extent \nconsistent with the foregoing and overrules the Cityโs objections [352]. \nPlaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneysโ fees incurred by \nresponding to the Cityโs emergency petition and related filings.  \nThe Court orders the special master to facilitate briefing and issue \na report and recommendation on the issue of whether the attorneysโ \nfees sought by Plaintiff are appropriate under Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 \nU.S. 424 (1983). To the extent possible, the parties should coordinate \nwith each other and the special master to determine the amount of fees \ndue to Plaintiffs in concert with the upcoming the show cause \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 403   Filed 02/12/18   Page 14 of 14\nproceedings, outlined in the Courtโs November 28, 2017 Order.

Defendants \nhave admitted that APD officers forced all 60-70 persons in the establishment to \nlay on the floor while they frisked them and entered all their names into a police \ndatabase to search for warrants and/or criminal history.2 \nPlaintiffs contend, among other things, that Defendants unlawfully detained \nthem without particularized reasonable articulable suspicion; unlawfully arrested \nthem  without  probable  cause;  unlawfully  frisked  them  for  weapons  without \nparticularized  reasonable  articulable  suspicion  that  they  were  armed  and \ndangerous;  unlawfully  searched  them  without  a  warrant  or  probable  cause; \nunlawfully searched the premises of the Atlanta Eagle, a retail store in the same \nbuilding, and the home of Plaintiff Shepherd without a warrant or probable cause; \nand unlawfully arrested Plaintiff Shepherd in his home. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   (Defendantsโ Initial Disclosures, p. 5, Docket item No. 21.); Defendant City \nof Atlantaโs September 13, 2010 Defendantsโ Supplemental Response to Plaintiffsโ \nFirst Interrogatories lists 58 individuals whose names were entered into a police \ndatabase during the Raid, but this list does not include all persons known to have \nbeen  seized  by  police  during  the  Raid,  including  Plaintiffs  du-Wayne  Ray, \nChristopher Schmaltz, and Saverio Montelone. \n     \n4\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 5 of 55\nII.  Discovery \nPlaintiffs served discovery requests on the City of Atlanta and the individual \nDefendants beginning March 26, 2010.   Defendants were consistently late in their \nresponses and failed to comply with Plaintiffsโ requests as discussed throughout \nthe present Motion.  Plaintiffsโ counsel Daniel Grossman made numerous good \nfaith attempts to encourage Defendants to comply with discovery, including letters, \nemails, phone calls, and in-person meetings with Defendantsโ counsel, but to no \navail.3 \nIII.  The 30(b)(6) Deposition \nBy June, 2010, it had become obvious that Defendants were not going to \ncomply with discovery and Plaintiffs noticed a 30(b)(6) deposition of Defendant \nCity of Atlanta to inquire into the existence of responsive items and Defendantsโ \nefforts  to  preserve  and  search  for  those  items.  The  City  of  Atlanta  designated \nDefendant Debra Williams as its witness, but when Defendant Williams appeared \nfor her deposition on August 5, 2010, she was not prepared to testify and the City \nterminated the deposition.4  Defendant Williams appeared again on August 10, \n2010, but was still not prepared to testify about all topics in the 30(b)(6) notice and \n                                                 \n3   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถยถ 4-17, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n4   (Deposition of Debra Williams, August 5, 2010, p. 75, ll. 12-24.)

The August 20, 2010 Telephone Conference \nOn August 20, 2010, the parties had a telephone conference with the Court \nto discuss the problems with discovery.  The Court found Defendants had been \nโwoefully deficient in their responses to Plaintiffsโ discovery requests,โ overruled \nDefendantsโ objections to discovery, and ordered Defendants to supplement their \ndiscovery  responses  and  comply  fully  with  Plaintiffsโ  requests  on  or  before \nSeptember 3, 2010.7   The Court also issued a number of specific orders, e.g., \nordering the individual Defendants to produce their mobile phones for inspection \nby  Plaintiffs  and  to  produce  photographs  of  themselves;  ordering  the  City  of \nAtlanta to produce existing computer backups and email archives; and allowing \nPlaintiffs  to  inspect  original  documents  at  the  offices  of  the  Atlanta  Police \nDepartment. \n \n \n                                                 \n5   (Deposition of Debra Williams, August 10, 2010, p. 193, ll. 20-22; p. 198, ll. \n7-23.) \n \n6   (Deposition of Jeremy Johnson, August 19, 2010.) \n \n7   (Transcript  of  August  20,  2010  Telephone  Conference,  Attachment  7 \nhereto.) \n     \n6\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 7 of 55\nV.

Supply Co. v. United States, 77 Fed. Cl. 257, \n258 (Fed. Cl. 2007).  Defendants are guilty of both forms of spoliationโthe actual \ndestruction of evidence and the failure to preserve relevant evidence.  Spoliation \noccurred  even  after  this  Court  issued  orders  requiring  certain  evidence  to  be \nproduced. \nA.  Defendants  deliberately  deleted  mobile  phone  data  they  were \nordered to produce to Plaintiffs. \n \nAfter being ordered to produce their mobile phones for inspection, some of \nthe Defendants destroyed the evidence on their phones instead. \nPlaintiffsโ forensic expert examined the APD mobile phone reports for a \nsample group comprised of six Defendants.  The officers selected for this sample \nwere the four most senior officers involved in the Raid (Red Dog commander Lt. \nScott Pautsch, Raid commanders Sgt. John Brock and Sgt. Kelly Collier, and lead \ninvestigator  Bennie  Bridges);  an  officer  whose  phone  was  used  to  take  a \nphotograph during the Raid (Officer Jeremy Edwards); and one โrank-and-fileโ \nofficer (Officer Brandon Jackson). \n     \n9\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 10 of 55\nPlaintiffsโ expert concluded that each of the six Defendants in the sample \ngroup deleted text messages from their mobile phones after the Court ordered \nthem to produce their phones for inspection.14   \nSome of the missing messages specifically concern the Raid, and some were \neven sent during the Raid itself.15 \nThe reports indicate that mobile phone photographs are missing as well, \nincluding  photographs  taken  during  the  period  of  the  Raid.  Defendant  Jeremy \nEdwardsโ phone, for example, contained a photograph taken during the Raid, but \nthe two previous photographs are missing.16 \nThe reports also suggest the possibility of โmobile phone hackingโ (i.e., \ncorrupt data being placed on the phones specifically to disrupt forensic extraction) \non the phones of Defendants Darnell Perry, Jeremy Edwards, Timothy McClain, \nDimitri Jacques, and Vincente Marcano.17   \nThe  data  deleted  from  the  officersโ  mobile  phones  likely  includes  items \nwhich are relevant to this action.

Defendantsโ \ncounsel Robert Godfrey informed Plaintiffs that while these recordings existed \nwhen Plaintiffsโ Preservation Letter was served in December, 2009, the recordings \nwere subsequently deleted and no longer exist.43 \n3.  Defendants  were  specifically  aware  of  their  duty  to  preserve \nmobile phone data. \n \nDefendants  and  their  counsel  were  also  under  a  specific  obligation  to \npreserve the mobile phone data which has now been lost.  Mobile phone data was \nspecifically  mentioned  in  the  โPreservation  Letterโ  that  Plaintiffs  sent  to \nDefendants  on  December  17,  2009,  and  at  the  Rule  26(f)  conference  held  on \nFebruary 24, 2010, Plaintiffsโ counsel Daniel Grossman stated that he had reason \nto believe discoverable evidence existed on the mobile phones of police officers \n                                                 \n42   (Deposition of Debra Williams, August 10, 2010, pp. 36-38, 40-41.) \n \n43   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 30, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n     \n21\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 22 of 55\ninvolved in the Raid and reminded Defendantsโ counsel of their duty to preserve \nthis evidence; Grossman specifically warned that deletion or destruction of this \nevidence could result in severe sanctions.44  At numerous times over the following \nmonths  Grossman  spoke  with  Defendantsโ  attorneys  Dennis  Young,  Stephen \nPower, Robert Godfrey, and Christopher Walker to inquire about the preservation \nand  production  of  mobile  phone  data  and  to  request  that  this  information  be \npreserved and searched.  Defendantsโ counsel were aware of the need to preserve \nmobile phone data and even issued an additional Litigation Hold letter on this very \npoint, but never took effective steps to implement such a hold.45 \nOn June 30, 2010, frustrated that mobile phone data was apparently not \nbeing preserved, Grossman wrote to Dennis Young and Christopher Walker to \nagain โremind defendants of their duty to preserve electronic data relevant to this \ncase, in particular data located on the mobile phones, PDAs, laptop computers, and \nother electronic devices used by officers involved in the Eagle Raid.โ Grossman \nrecommended  that  Defendants  hire  an  electronic  discovery  consultant  to  help \nDefendants preserve and produce responsive items contained on these devices, and \n                                                 \n44   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 3, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n45   This Litigation Hold letter is undated, but may have been issued after the \nFebruary 24, 2010, Conference at which the subject was discussed.

The City failed to produce responsive documents. \n \nAs a result of Defendantsโ pervasive failure to search, and perhaps a willful \nattempt  to  conceal  evidence,  Defendants  withheld  a  massive  quantity  of \ndiscoverable and in some cases highly relevant and even dispositive items. \n1.  The City withheld responsive paper documents. \nThe site visits to APD revealed the existence of 12,046 pages of responsive \ndocuments, many of  which had previously been withheld. 64  The visit to the Red \nDog  unit  alone,  for  example,  uncovered  thousands  of  previously  unproduced \ndocuments including  personnel files, Use of Force Reports, tactical plans of other \npolice raids, Red Dog training materials, and Command Memoranda concerning \narrest, search and seizure, and other responsive topics. 65 \n                                                 \n63   (Deposition of Debra Williams, August 10, 2010, p. 57.) \n \n64   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 19, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n65   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 20, Attachment 3 hereto.)  Given the large \nquantity of responsive documents uncovered during these site visits Defendants \nmay claim the visits satisfy their obligations under discovery.  These site visits \nwere  not  intended  to  relieve  Defendants  of  their  obligation  to  search  for  and \nproduce  responsive  items;  not  only  do  Defendants  have  a  much  better \nunderstanding of their own filing system than Plaintiffs, but some key responsive \nitems were missing from their normal locations as discussed below. \n     \n27\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 28 of 55\nThe documents discovered by Plaintiffs included โsmoking gunโ items such \nsworn  statements  by  police  officers  admitting  key  factual  issues  which  are  in \ndispute in this action.  For example, one of the disputed issues is whether police \nofficers searched the premises of the Atlanta Eagle, including the managerโs office \non the second floor and a locked liquor storage room.  Raid commander Defendant \nJohn Brock stated in his interrogatory response that โThe Club was not searched,โ \nbut in a sworn statement he made to Internal Affairs, which was never produced to \nPlaintiffs and was only discovered during the site visit, Defendant Brock admitted \nthat he himself instructed officers to โclearโ the upstairs office and that officers \nkicked in the door to the liquor storage area (which he called a โkitchenโ).66 In \nanother Internal Affairs statement  Defendants also withheld, but which was found \nduring the site visit, Investigator Bennie Bridges similarly admitted that officers \nkicked down the door and searched the liquor storage area.67 \nIn addition to discovering documents which had previously been withheld, \nthe site visits also disclosed documents which are missing and may have been \nspoliated.   For  example,  Plaintiffs  discovered  detailed  minutes  of  โSpecial \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n66   (John Brock Response to Interrog # 3, Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 25,  \nJohn Brock OPS Statement, June 29, 2010, P. 21A-2-3, Exhibit I, Attachment 3 \nhereto.) \n \n67   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 25, Bennie Bridgesโ Statement, June 29, \n2010, P. 22A-2-2, Exhibit J, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n     \n28\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 29 of 55\nEnforcement Section (SES) Supervisor Meetingsโ for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, \nin which commanders of SES units (including the two units involved in the Raid, \nVice and Red Dog) presented detailed descriptions of their activities during that \nweek.  Minutes of each weekly meeting were located except for one period of \ntimeโthe period that included the Raid.  These key minutes were missing not only \nfrom the file cabinets of the Special Enforcement Section itself, but also from the \nfile  cabinets  of  the  Criminal  Investigation  Division  of  which  SES  is  a \ndepartment.68  These minutes may well go to the very heart of who ordered the \nRaid and what happened.  It is Defendantsโ obligation to locate and produce these \nminutes, or to admit that they have been spoliated and no longer exist, but so far \nDefendants have done neither.69 \n2.  The City failed to produce its Microsoft Exchange Archives as \nordered by the Court. \n \nAt the two August conferences the Court ordered Defendants to produce all \nexisting  computer  backups  including  โarchivesโ  of  Microsoft  Exchange  files \n(which include emails, email attachments, and calendar information)70 and all other \n                                                 \n68   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 22, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n69   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 23, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n70   DIT creates an โarchiveโ the Cityโs Microsoft Exchange servers every 30th \nday.

Complete Microsoft Exchange data (such as emails) from \nthe 2009-2010 timeframe were not contained on the drive received by \nthe Plaintiff on September 14, 2010.

Defendants have failed to produce photographs of themselves as \nordered by the Court. \n \nDuring  the  August  20,  2010,  telephone  conference  the  Court  explicitly \nordered Defendants to produce at least five photographs of themselves as requested \nby Plaintiffs, but not a single individual defendant has complied with the Courtโs \norder.  Twenty of the 35 individual defendants have still produced nothing but a \nsingle ID photo in the form of a small, fuzzy 2\" x 3\" inkjet printout, and of the \nremaining 15 defendants, the majority produced only 2-3 photos and many of these \nare so fuzzy or dark as to be unrecognizable.74  It would have been quite easy for \nDefendants to comply with this simple request and their failure to do so shows an \nespecially arrogant contempt for the authority of this Court. \nIII.  Responsibility for these violations falls on both defendants and their \ncounsel. \n \nA.  The responsibility of Defendants. \nDefendants are responsible for the general failure to preserve and produce \nresponsive items:  โAt the end of the dayโฆ the duty to preserve and produce \ndocuments rests on the party.

Swofford v. \nEslinger,  671  F.Supp.  2d  1274,  1282  (M.D.  Fla.  2009).    Defendants  โcannot \nabsolve  themselves  of  liability  from  their  failure  to  preserve  the  evidence  by \nhaving their counsel withhold the demand for preservation from them. If the law \nwere  otherwise,  no  party  would  be  responsible  for  the  willful  violation  of  a \npreservation  demand  or  the  destruction  of  evidence  known  to  be  relevant  to \nongoing  or  impending  litigation  if  they  simply  counseled  their  attorney  not  to \ncommunicate the demand to them.โ Id. at 1283.   \nAnd, of course, it is always appropriate to hold parties accountable for their \nown personal conduct, and any individual Defendants who personally spoliated \nevidence (such as those who deleted mobile phone data) are naturally responsible \nfor those acts.  See, Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp. 427 F.3d 939, 944 (11th Cir. \n2005); Connor v. Sun Trust Bank, 546 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1377 (N.D.

The responsibility of counsel. \n  Defendantsโ counsel are also liable for their violations of Rules 26 and 37 of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedures in connection with their conduct in this \naction.    Attorneys  have  many  obligations  in  responding  to  discovery  and  the \ncounsel for these Defendants failed virtually each and every one of them: \ncounsel  has  a  duty  to  effectively  communicate  to  her  client  its \ndiscovery obligations so that all relevant information is discovered, \nretained,  and  produced.  In  particular,  once  the  duty  to  preserve \nattaches, counsel must identify sources of discoverable information. \nThis will usually entail speaking directly with the key players in the \nlitigation, as well as the client's information technology personnel. In \naddition, when the duty to preserve attaches, counsel must put in place \na litigation hold and make that known to all relevant employees by \ncommunicating  with  them  directly.

The \nattorneys who signed the original discovery responses (Peter Andrews and Dennis \nYoung)  clearly  did  not  take  that  responsibility  seriously.    Among  many  other \nincomprehensible responses, these attorneys falsely denied the existence of any \nโtraining materials used by or prepared specifically for the Red Dog unit of the \nAPD,โ even though it defies common sense to think that APD would employ a \nSWAT-type  narcotics  unit  to  provide  an  โaggressive  police  presenceโ  without \nproviding  them  with  any  specialized  training75,  and  they  signed  responses  for \ndozens of individual Defendants who each denied having even a single personal \n                                                 \n75Atlanta Police Website, http://www.atlantapd.org/Index.asp?nav=RD&menu=42; \n(Response 32 to Plaintiffs Second Request for Production to Defendant City of \nAtlanta.) \n     \n34\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 35 of 55\nemail or text message about a major police raid which involved more than 35 \npolice  officers  and  60  civilians  and  which  has  been  the  focus  of  widespread \nattention. Did these attorneys really โstop and thinkโ about the legitimacy of these \nanswers? \nAfter the Court ordered Defendants to supplement discovery the attorneys \nwho  signed  the  new  responses  (Jerry  De  Loach,  Robert  Godfrey,  and  Tamara \nBaines) sometimes just incorporated the same untruthful and unbelievable answers \nas  the  original  responses:  โSee  previously  produced  responses.โ    Did  these \nattorneys themselves โstop and think?โ  And it was these attorneys who, after the \nCourtโs orders on August 20 and August 27, failed to prevent the recycling of \nbackup  tapes;  failed  to  take  effective  measures  to  discourage  Defendants  from \ndeleting mobile phone data; failed to supplement discovery; and failed to produce \nthe email archives, photographs, and other items specifically compelled by the \nCourt. \nIt should be noted that the attorneys who are responsible for these violations \ninclude those who participated in discovery on behalf of Defendants but never \nentered a notice of appearance, despite being ordered to do so by the Court.  These \ninclude Jerry de Loach, who signed discovery responses and participated in the \nAugust  27  telephone  conference.    In  addition,  Mr.  De  Loach,  as  the  Law \nDepartmentโs head of litigation and Robert Godfreyโs superior, participated in the \n     \n35\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 36 of 55\nAugust  26,  2010  meeting  between  Defendantsโ  counsel  and  the  individual \nDefendants76; Mr. De Loach is at least partly responsible for counselโs failure to \nimpress upon the Defendants the importance of preserving evidence such as the \nmobile  phone  data  which  was  subsequently  deleted.    Further,  Assistant  City \nAttorney  Amber  Robinson,  who  coordinated  discovery  with  APDโs  Internal \nAffairs  unit,  may  be  responsible  for  the  failure  to  produce  the  sworn  Internal \nAffairs statements that were withheld from Plaintiffs.77  These attorneys should not \nbe able to evade sanctions by pointing to their failure to enter an appearance. \nV.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(3). \n \nRule 37 authorizes the Court to impose sanctions for the failure to obey a \ndiscovery order, including โ(i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or \nother designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the \nprevailing party claims; (ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or \nopposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in \nevidence;  (iii)  striking  pleadings  in  whole  or  in  part;  (iv)  staying  further \nproceedings until the order is obeyed; (v) dismissing the action or proceeding in \nwhole or in part;(vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; or \n(vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to \nsubmit to a physical or mental examination.โ Fed.

Order Defendants fully to comply with discovery. \nThe  Court  has  already  ordered  full  compliance  with  discovery  but  these \norders have been ignored.  Plaintiffs ask the Court again to order full compliance \nwith  discovery  and,  as  discussed  below,  to  use  its  civil  contempt  authority  to \ncompel actual compliance with these orders. \nB.   Order  Defendants  or  their  counsel  to  pay  for  the  forensic \nexamination  of  electronically  stored  information,  including  the \nrestoration of deleted data. \n \nDefendantsโ bad faith authorizes the Court, in its discretion, to impose the \nseverest  of  sanctions,  including  the  striking  of  pleadings  or  entry  of  default \njudgment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A). \nHowever, since it is feasible to restore deleted electronic information on \nboth computer hard drives and mobile phones,80 Plaintiffs request that the Court \norder Defendants and/or their counsel to pay Plaintiffsโ forensic expert to restore \nthis data to as great an extent as possible, and to prepare a report to the Court \n                                                 \n80   (Affidavit of John Carney, ยถยถ 33, 35, Attachment 4 hereto.) \n     \n38\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 39 of 55\ndescribing the specific items deleted by Defendants.  This should provide Plaintiffs \nwith at least some of the responsive items Defendants should have preserved in the \nfirst place and thus fulfill one of the goals of a spoliation sanction, which is to \nโrestore the prejudiced party to the same position [it] would have been in absent \nthe wrongful destruction of evidence by the opposing party.โ Pension Comm. of \nUniv. of Montreal Pension Plan v. Banc of Am. Sec., 685 F. Supp. 2d 456, 466 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2010), citing West v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 167 F.3d 776, 779 \n(2d  Cir.  1999).    The  restoration  of  deleted  data  will  also  assist  the  Court  in \ndetermining what additional sanctions may be appropriate in light of the spoliation \nthat actually occurred, since the factors considered in making this determination \ncan much better be addressed after the deleted data is restored in whole or in part.81  \nRestoration of deleted data can be an expensive process, but if Defendants \nhad fulfilled their obligation to preserve electronic data in the first place no such \nrestoration would be required.  It is therefore appropriate to order Defendants to \npay for the restoration of deleted data as other courts have done.  See, e.g., Canon \n                                                 \n81   These factors include โ(1) whether the [party] was prejudiced as a result of \nthe  destruction  of  evidence;  (2)  whether  the  prejudice  could  be  cured;  (3)  the \npractical importance of the evidence; (4) whether the [party] acted in good or bad \nfaith; and (5) the potential for abuse if expert testimony about the evidence was not \nexcluded.โ Flury v.

S.A.M., Inc. 2008 LEXIS 47712 (U.S.D.C., E.D. La. 2008).82 \n1.   The forensic examination and collection of data should \ninclude the personal computers of the individual \ndefendants. \n \nGiven the individual Defendantsโ failure to produce even a single personal \nwriting  (such  as  a  personal  email,  Facebook  message,  or  online  postings),  the \nforensic  examination  and  data  collection  discussed  above  should  include  the \nindividual defendantsโ personal computers, since this is where personal emails and \nother writings are most likely to be found.  Each of the individual Defendants has \ndenied being in possession of responsive writings such as personal emails but these \nassertions are not credible, and in the case of at least several defendants they are \nclearly untruthful.  Plaintiffs have little reason to trust these claims since the failure \nto produce certain relevant items raises doubt about a partyโs assertion that no \nother items exist.  Connor v. Sun Trust Bank, 546 F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1376 (N.D. \nGa. 2008).   \n                                                 \n82   Defendantsโ preferred method of having forensic examination performed by \nemployees of the APD rather than a third-party expert is completely inappropriate, \nnot  only  for  the  obvious  conflict  of  interest,  but  because  the  mobile  phone \nexamination  performed  by  the  APD  examiner  was  grossly  inadequate  and \nunprofessional,  as  described  by  Plaintiffsโ  forensic  expert.    (Affidavit  of  John \nCarney,  ยถยถ  11-30,  Attachment  4  hereto.)    โโฆ  the  mobile  phone  forensic \nexamination  performed  by  the  Defendants  was  substantially  and  materially \ninadequate  with  a  flawed  process  design  that  lacked  conformance  in  every \nmeaningful  way  with  best  practices  in  the  mobile  phone  forensics  field.โ  \n(Affidavit of John Carney, ยถ 32, Attachment 4 hereto.) \n     \n40\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 41 of 55\n2.   The  forensic  examination  and  collection  of  data  should \ninclude the City of Atlanta computer workstations of โkey \nplayersโ and others likely to have responsive information. \n \nThe forensic restoration and collection of data should include the City of \nAtlanta  computers  workstations  of  โkey  playersโ  and  others  likely  to  have \nresponsive  information,  such  as  the  administrative  assistants  and  primary \nsubordinates assigned to key players and to the police department units directly \ninvolved in this action (Vice, Red Dog, Special Enforcement Section, and Criminal \nInvestigation Division). \nUnder  the  user  permissions  established  by  the  DIT,  individual  City \nemployees are free to save files exclusively to their own assigned computer hard \ndrives and the City did not take any steps in response to this litigation to prevent \nsuch files from being deleted.83  These hard drives should therefore be examined \nfor responsive files which may have been deleted. \nC.    Order Defendants or their counsel to pay for the collection \nof electronically stored information and the creation of an  \ne-discovery search facility available to all Parties and the Court. \n \nPlaintiffs  ask  the  Court  to  order  Defendants  or  their  counsel  to  pay \nPlaintiffsโ e-discovery consultants to collect electronically stored information in \nthe possession of Defendants (including emails, database entries, mobile phone \ndata, text documents, and photographs,) and load the information into a search \n                                                 \n83   (Deposition of Jeremy Johnson, p. 66, ll. 1-15.) \n     \n41\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 42 of 55\nfacility, which will then be made available to all parties and the Court.  The City of \nAtlanta agreed to this procedure with regard to its own electronic data during the \nAugust  20,  2010,  conference  (โThatโs  fine  with  the  City.    The  City  has  no \nobjection  to  thatโ)84,  but  Plaintiffs  were  reluctant  to  begin  the  project  out  of \nconcern Defendants would not honor their agreement; Defendantsโ counsel Tamara \nBaines had already agreed, on the record, that the City would pay the cost of the \n30(b)(6)  deposition  it  terminated  but  the  City  later  refused  to  make  any  such \npayment.85 \nThe procedure proposed by Plaintiffs is no different than what Defendants \nshould have already done on their own to comply with discovery.  Without an e-\ndiscovery search facility there is no practical way to search tens-of-thousands of \nemails, text messages, and database entries from a large number of employees for \nitems responsive to such a wide variety of discovery topics (including the Raid \nitself, the investigation which preceded the raid, the discussions which followed \nthe Raid, APD training on topics such as search and seizure, and other police raids \nwhich may show evidence of a custom and practice relevant to Plaintiffsโ claims \nregarding  municipal  liability).

Award  the  reasonable  attorneysโ  fees  and  costs  incurred  by \nPlaintiffs  as  a  result  of  Defendantsโ  continued  and  repeated \nfailure to comply with discovery. \n \n  Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneysโ fees and costs as a result of \nDefendantsโ conduct both before and after the Courtโs August discovery orders. \nPlaintiffsโ counsel should not have had to spend time and expenses on multiple \nphone  calls,  emails,  letters,  good  faith  conferences,  a  three-part  deposition, \nconsultation with forensic experts, and now this extensive motion to compel as a \nresult of Defendantsโ continuing and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery.87  \nThroughout  this  litigation  Defendants  have  attempted  to  wear  Plaintiffs \ndown by dragging out discovery disputes as much as possible.  For example, by \nlate  June,  when,  it  had  become  obvious  that  Defendants  had  no  intention  of \ncomplying with discovery, Plaintiffs served a notice for a 30(b)(6) deposition to \ninquire  into  the  existence  of  responsive  items.    On  July  13,  2010,  Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel Daniel Grossman sent an email to Defendantsโ counsel Dennis Young \nstating:  โPlease  let  me  know  if  the  defendants  will  fully  comply  with  all  our \noutstanding discovery requests within the next few days, or please schedule a date \nearly next week for the 30(b)(6) deposition.โ88   \n                                                 \n87   (This  effort  is  described  in  the  Affidavit  of  Daniel  Grossman,  ยถยถ  4-17, \nAttachment 3 hereto.) \n \n88   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 11, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n     \n45\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 46 of 55\nIn  an  effort  to  prompt  voluntary  compliance  with  discovery,  Grossman \nexplicitly told Defendantsโ counsel Christopher Walker that the 30(b)(6) testimony \nwould be used in connection with a motion to compel and Grossman encouraged \nDefendants  to  avoid  the  deposition  (and  thus  a  motion  to  compel)  simply  by \nagreeing to comply with discovery.89  Grossman explained Plaintiffsโ position to \nChristopher  Walker  again  by  email  and  offered  to  take  the  deposition  off  the \ncalendar, and even give Defendants additional time to comply with discovery, if \nthey would simply agree to a date certain for compliance.90  How did Defendants \nrespond to this offer? Christopher Walker replied:  โI believe the best option is for \nus to schedule the 30(b)(6) witness for the City of Atlanta.โ91 \n  In other words, Defendants were so determined to avoid compliance with \ndiscovery that rather than take advantage of the additional time offered by the \nPlaintiffs,  Defendants  chose,  instead,  to  make  Plaintiffs  begin  the  tedious, \n                                                 \n89   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 12, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n \n90   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 13, Attachment 3 hereto; Daniel Grossman\n \nJuly 14, 2010, email to Christopher Walker, Exhibit D.) \n \n91   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 14, Attachment 3 hereto; Christopher \nWalker email to Daniel Grossman, Exhibit E.) \n \n     \n46\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 47 of 55\npainstaking,  and  expensive  process  of  documenting  Defendantsโ  discovery \nviolations though a 30(b)(6) deposition.92 \nEven  after  being  twice  ordered  by  the  Court  to  comply  with  discovery, \nDefendants failed to do so, necessitating the present motion to compel, taking the \ntime not only of Plaintiffsโ counsel but of the Court and its staff as well.   \n                                                 \n92   Even  that  process,  however,  did  not  go  smoothly.  When  the  Cityโs \ndesignated 30(b)(6) witness, Major Debra Williams, finally sat for her deposition \non August 5, 2010, she was not only one hour late but was so unprepared that \nDefendantsโ counsel Tamara  Baines terminated the deposition, stating, โthereโs \nobviously a few things that should have taken place before we can truly present her \nas a 30(b)(6)โฆ I understand, too, that weโll end up having to pay for the deposition \nwhen  sheโs  deposed  again,  but  I  cannot  present  her  as  a  30(b)(6)  today.โ \n(Deposition of Debra Williams, August 5, 2010, p. 6; p. 75, ll. 15-23.) \n \nNot only did the City never pay for the deposition as promised, but when \nMajor Williams appeared again on August 10 she was still not prepared to testify \nabout some of the matters in the deposition notice. ( Deposition of Debra Williams, \nAugust 10, 2010, p. 193.)  The City therefore scheduled yet a third deposition, with \nanother witness, which took place on August 19, 2010, two weeks after the first \ndeposition.  (Deposition of Jeremy Johnson.) \n \nThe production of an unprepared 30(b)(6) witness is considered a failure to \nappear,  which  is  sanctionable  under  Rule  37(d)(1).    Continental  Cas.  Co.  v. \nCompass Bank, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12288, at *56-70 (S.D. Ala., March 3, \n2006), citing Black Horse Lane Assoc. v. Dow Chem.

Plaintiffs request the Court to enforce all orders issued under this \nmotion by a finding of civil contempt.  \n \n  The Court has already ordered Defendants to comply with discovery on \ntwo occasions.  Indeed, to emphasize the gravity of disobedience with these orders \nthe Court even warned that the โSword of Damoclesโ was hanging over the Cityโs \nhead.93  Despite these warnings Defendants ignored the Courtโs clear orders, and \nso Plaintiffs are concerned that additional orders may be similarly ignored. \nIn fact, it appears that Defendants may have deliberately chosen to defy the \nCourt.  On August 26, 2010, Defendantsโ counsel Robert Godfrey stated in an \nemail:  โI have just completed my meeting with the officers and as I anticipated, \nthere was a good deal of discomfort with what we have to do to comply with the \nCourtโs order.  First of all, I am going to have to have an order from the judge that \nI  can  show  the  officers  and  APD  brass.โ94  The  next  day  Defendants,  through \ncounsel, asked the Court for such a written order, and when the request was denied \nit  seems  they  simply  chose  to  ignore  the  Courtโs  verbal  orders.    Instead  of \nproducing their mobile phones as ordered, several Defendants deleted the data they \nwere told to produce, and all 35 Defendants refused to do something as simple as \nproducing  five  photographs  of  themselves,  suggesting  an  intentional  and \ncoordinated defiance of the Courtโs authority. \n                                                 \n93   (Transcript of August 27, 2010, p. 17, Attachment 8 hereto.) \n \n94   (Affidavit of Daniel Grossman, ยถ 18, Attachment 3 hereto.) \n     \n48\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 49 of 55\nโCourts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders \nthrough civil contempt.โ Smith v. Pefanis, 652 F. Supp. 2d 1308, 1339 (N.D. Ga. \n2009).  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize the Court to โ[treat] as \ncontempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a \nphysical or mental examination,โ and other courts have exercised this authority to \nwith regard to discovery violations.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(B)(2)(A)(VII); Pesaplastic, \nC.A. v. Cincinnati Milacron Co., 799 F.2d 1510 (11th Cir. 1986). \nA finding of civil contempt requires clear and convincing evidence that: โ(1) \nthe allegedly violated order was valid and lawful; (2) the order was clear and \nunambiguous;  and  (3)  the  alleged  violator  had  the  ability  to  comply  with  the \norder.โ  Riccard v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 307 F.3d 1277, 1296 (11th Cir. \n2002).    The  Courtโs  orders  to  produce  mobile  phones,  backup  tapes,  email \narchives,  and  photographs  were  clear  and  unambiguous  and  transcripts  of  the \nhearings were available to Defendants; there can be little doubt that Defendants \nhad the ability to comply with these orders. \nA federal court recently used its civil contempt authority to enforce an order \n(in that case, the payment of attorneysโ fees) arising from discovery violations \nsimilar  to  the  violations  in  this  action  (including  the  failure  to  implement  a \nlitigation  hold,  the  deletion  of  electronically  stored  information,  the  failure  to \npreserve electronic evidence, and the failure to stop the recycling of computer \n     \n49\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 50 of 55\nbackup tapes). Victor Stanley, Inc. v. Creative Pipe, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n93644 (D. Md. Sept. 9, 2010).  The court in Victor Stanley found the use of its \ncontempt authority appropriate because it believed that โwithout the threat of jail \ntime, [the responding partyโs] future conduct would be predicted by his past.โ Id., \nat 157.  \nGiven Defendantsโ refusal to obey the clear orders issued by this Court, \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to hold Defendants and their counsel in civil contempt and \norder them imprisoned, but give them the opportunity to purge the contempt and \navoid ever being jailed simply by complying with the Courtโs orders within a \nreasonable period of time.   \n  Plaintiffs wish to make it clear that they do not seek the actual incarceration \nof Defendants or their counsel; Plaintiffs merely suggest that the Court use its civil \ncontempt authority as a mechanism to assure compliance with the Courtโs orders, \nwhich have already been blatantly and deliberately violated by these Defendants.  \nAs the court noted in Victor Stanley, โto avoid jail time, all that is requiredโ of \nDefendants is to obey the orders of the Court. Id. at 158. \nG.    Impose  such  punitive  sanctions,  if  any,  as  the  Court  finds \nappropriate. \n \n Defendantsโ abuse of discovery hurt not only Plaintiffs but also the Court \nand the adversary system itself, which โrelies in large part on the good faith and \ndiligence  of  counsel  and  the  parties  in  abiding  by  these  rules  and  conducting \n     \n50\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 51 of 55\nthemselves and their judicial business honestly.โ Metro. Opera Ass'n v. Local 100, \nHotel Employees, 212 F.R.D. 178, 181 (S.D.N.Y. 2003); Victor Stanley, 2010 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 93644 at *98 (โthe duty to preserve evidence โฆ is a duty owed to the \ncourt, not to a partyโs adversary.โ)    \nDiscovery sanctions are intended not only to prevent unfair prejudice to \nlitigators  but  also  โto  insure  the  integrity  of  the  discovery  process.โ    Flury  v. \nDaimler Chrysler Corp. 427 F.3d 939, 944 (11th Cir. 2005); Gratton v. Great Am. \nCommcโns., 178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir. 1999).  Severe sanctions are available \nto the district court โnot merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to \nwarrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct \nin the absence of such a deterrent.โ  NHL v. Metro. Hockey Club, 427 U.S. 639, \n643  (1976).    As  discussed  above,  these  sanctions  can  include  entry  of  default \njudgment and the striking of pleadings or defenses. \nThe sanctions requested by Plaintiffs for their own sake, at this time, are \nremedial  and  compensatory,  and  it  is  for  the  Court  to  determine  in  its  own \ndiscretion  if  additional  sanctions  are  appropriate  to  protect  the  integrity  of  the \njudicial process or to deter misconduct in the future. \n \n \n \n     \n51\n  \n75205468.1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 236    Filed 10/06/10   Page 52 of 55\nCONCLUSION \n  Throughout this litigation the Defendants and their counsel have acted as if \nthe rules, the law, and even the orders of this Court simply do not apply to them:  \nThey have responded late to most discovery requests; failed to respond at all to \nothers; failed to follow the Courtโs โInstructions to Parties and Counsel;โ failed to \nuse good faith in making or certifying their discovery responses; failed to preserve, \nsearch for, or produce responsive items as required by law; failed to obey clear and \nunambiguous orders of this Court; and rather than produce evidence pursuant to \nthis Courtโs Order, they destroyed it.  These violations involved all thirty-five \nDefendants and at least eight individual attorneys.  The judicial process cannot \nfunction when parties and their counsel so flagrantly, pervasively, and deliberately \nignore their obligations.   \nThis 6th day of October, 2010. \n \n \n         \n/s/ Daniel J.

Whitley, the appointed Special Master in the above-\nreferenced case, in furtherance of the duties imposed upon the Special Master by \nthis  Court's  Order  entered June  22,  2016  [Dkt.  No.  309]  (the  \"Special  Master \nOrder\"),  and  submits  this  Special  Master  Quarterly  Compliance  Report  dated \nSeptember 29, 2016 (the \"9/29 Compliance Report\"), recommending no further \naction by the Court at this time beyond entry of the Consent Order Setting Forth \nInitial Special Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures \n[Dkt. No. 323] (the \"Procedures Order\"), which was entered September 23, 2016, \nand deferment of any further action, if any, for the reasons that follow:   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 2 of 25\n \nPROLOGUE \n  During  the  first  three  months  of  the  Special  Master's  appointment,  the \nSpecial Master quickly ascertained that an order setting forth initial monitoring, \ndiscovery, and dispute resolution procedures would be critical to accomplishing the \nparties'  shared  goals  of  \"develop[ing]  a  collaborative  rather  than  adversarial \nrelationship between the parties\" (Special Master Order, at ยถ3(c)) and establishing \ncomplete consensus as to the City of Atlanta's compliance with the Court Orders, \ndue, in large part, to mutual communication breakdowns that are not attributable to \nany one party. This has been the Special Master's primary focus for the first three \nmonths of his appointment. \n  As  indicated  by  the  Unopposed  Motion  for  Order  Setting  Forth  Initial \nSpecial Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures [Dkt. \nNo. 321] (the \"Unopposed Motion\") and the Procedures Order, significant progress \nhas been made in furtherance of these critical objectives, and the Special Master \nbelieves and finds that Plaintiffs and the City of Atlanta (the \"City\") intend to fully \ncomply with the Court Orders (as defined below), the Procedures Order, and the \nother applicable rules in an effort to achieve a mutual understanding, agreement, \nand consensus of complete compliance.   \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 3 of 25\n \n  Notwithstanding, the Special Master Order requires the Special Master to \nissue  written  quarterly  reports  on  compliance  with  the  Court  Orders  and \nelectronically file such reports with this Court. Accordingly, this 9/29 Compliance \nReport sets forth the Special Master's initial, limited findings to date regarding the \nCity's compliance, with the understanding that the Special Master will be further \ninvestigating, revisiting, and/or supplementing these findings in the next quarterly \ncompliance report, due December 22, 2016, and those that follow.  \nMETHODOLOGY \n   In conducting the Special Master's independent investigation and preparing \nthis report, the Special Master has given consideration to (i) relevant pleadings, \nfilings, and discovery in the above-styled case, including, but not limited to, the \nCourt's  Orders  entered  December  8,  2010  [Dkt.  No.  265]  (the  \"2010  Order\"), \nDecember 15, 2011 [Dkt. No. 280] (the \"2011 Order\"), and May 19, 2015 [Dkt. \nNo. 289] (the \"2015 Order\") (hereinafter, collectively, the \"Court Orders\"); (ii) \nvarious party and non-party documents, information, and accounts requested and \nreceived  by  the  Special  Master  to  date  as  relevant  to  the  determination  of \ncompliance with the Court Orders; and (iii) the parties' direct representations, as \nofficers of the Court, to the Special Master, as an officer of the Court.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 4 of 25\n \n  Where possible, evidence was reviewed according to a preponderance of the \nevidence standard to make an initial determination about compliance; however, no \nformal  evidentiary  hearing  has  been  held,  and,  given  the  recentness  of  his \nappointment, the Special Master has not had an opportunity to review all evidence. \nAdditionally, in some instances, the Special Master explicitly finds that additional \nevidence is needed to formulate a complete opinion on  compliance. Therefore, \nthese initial, limited findings are subject to further review and revision, and no \nparty is deemed to have waived any evidentiary rights or objections. \nINITIAL FINDINGS \n   For purposes of these initial findings, the Special Master utilizes the 2015 \nOrder as a road map because it sets forth fourteen (14) paragraphs of discrete \nrequirements that generally articulate the compliance issues presented by the Court \nOrders.    In  an  effort  to  create  a  more  readable  document,  the  Special  Master \nparaphrases the requirements of the 2015 Order below. The Special Master has \nattempted  to  accurately  paraphrase  the  requirements  and  understands  and \nacknowledges that compliance with the Court Orders -- not the Special Master's \nshort form interpretations thereof -- is the relevant inquiry. Accordingly, nothing in \nthis 9/29 Compliance Report, including any paraphrased language, is intended to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 5 of 25\n \n(nor shall it) modify, alter, or amend any of this Court's prior orders. To the extent \nthere is any conflict, the Court Orders prevail and are controlling. \n  Paragraph 1 - Requirement to complete in-person training of all sworn \nAPD  employees  within  90  days,  using  a  format  and  content  acceptable  to \nPlaintiffs, on the topics specified in the 2010 Order.  \n  Based on the Special Master's review of the record, there is no dispute as to \nwhether the City actually conducted \"Calhoun\" training within the relevant time \nperiod; however, disputes do exist as to whether or not Plaintiffs approved (or \nacquiesced to) the format and content of the training. \n  The record confirms that the City and Plaintiffs met on June 29, 2015 and \nagain  on  July  16,  2015  to  discuss  (among  other  things)  early  draft(s)  of  the \n\"Calhoun\" training that were not acceptable to Plaintiffs. While not entirely clear, \nit appears the parties discussed revisions that would (in theory) make the draft \ntraining  acceptable  and  agreed  that  a  five-day  period  would  be  sufficient  for \nPlaintiffs' counsel to review and comment on the revised training. \n  The  dispute  boils  down  to  a  July  17,  2015  email  from  City  counsel  to \nPlaintiffs' counsel ostensibly attaching for review the revised training materials, \nwhich  incorporated  certain  revisions  discussed  at  the  June  29  and/or  July  16 \nmeetings. The record confirms that the City waited five days after sending the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 6 of 25\n \nrevised  training  materials  on  July  17.  Then,  when  no  objection  (or  any  other \nresponse)  was  received,  the  City  interpreted  Plaintiffs'  silence  as \napproval/acquiescence and proceeded with \"Calhoun\" training despite the lack of \nan affirmative confirmation regarding the format and content of the training from \nPlaintiffs' counsel.  \n  The City proceeded with the initial \"Calhoun\" training from July 28 through \nAugust 12, completing the training of every police officer in the APD, with the \nexception of those on extended leave, on or before August 17, 2015, as required by \nthe timing component of paragraph 1, and as more particularly set forth by the \nDeclaration of Major Darin Schierbaum filed with the Court on August 21, 2015 \n[Dkt. No. 299-1]. \n  In  fact,  the  format  and  content  of  the  2015  \"Calhoun\"  training  are  not \nacceptable to Plaintiffs (although Plaintiffs' counsel confirmed the training was \nmuch improved), and Plaintiffs' counsel deny receiving the July 17 email enclosing \nthe training materials for their review. Notwithstanding, it appears Plaintiffs knew \nthe City was proceeding with the initial \"Calhoun\" training and did not intervene to \nprevent the training in progress. \n  In  lieu  of  engaging  in  potentially  complex  and  expensive  discovery \n(including metadata/ESI) to determine whether or not the July 17 email was, in \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 7 of 25\n \nfact, sent by City counsel and/or received by Plaintiffs' counsel, the Special Master \nis inclined to take the mere existence of the July 17 email at face value as standing \nfor the proposition that the City did, in fact, attempt to provide the revised training \nmaterials to Plaintiffs' counsel prior to conducting the training, and did, in fact, \nattempt  to  achieve  a  format  and  content  acceptable  to  Plaintiffs  (albeit \nunsuccessfully) through meetings with Plaintiffs' counsel and a good faith revision \nand review process.  \n  It would be impossible for the Special Master to find complete compliance \ndue to the subjective element of paragraph 1 requiring that the format and content \nbe \"acceptable to Plaintiffs.\" It is not. However, it is also not possible for the City \nto return to August 2015 to timely ascertain that Plaintiffs did not receive the July \n17  email,  and  it  appears  clear  that  the  City  attempted  to  comply  with  (and \nsubstantially complied with) the spirit of paragraph 1.  \n  In coming to this conclusion, the Special Master does not condone the City's \nbehavior  in  moving  forward  without  receiving  positive  confirmation  from \nPlaintiffs,  which  would  have  been,  in  hindsight,  the  more  prudent  course. \nHowever, the Special Master gives the City the benefit of the doubt based on the \nfact that City counsel and Plaintiffs' counsel had exchanged emails previously and \ncontinue to do so, with no other known issues.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 8 of 25\n \n  Further, the City submitted the training to Georgia Peace Officer Standards \nand  Training  Council  (\"POST\"),  who  independently  reviewed  the  training  and \nconcluded that although certain aspects of the training could be improved,  \n\"It  appears  that  this  training  was  structured  to  meet  the  aspects \nagreed upon in the consent order. The objectives of the training are \nclearโฆ\" \n \n  Finally,  a  finding  of  non-compliance  would  undermine  the  substantial \nprogress made by the parties in the past 3 months in reaching agreement as to \ndetailed  procedures  (set  forth  more  fully  in  the  Procedures  Order)  that  will \nundoubtedly prevent any misunderstanding as to whether the format and content of \nthe training is \"acceptable to Plaintiffs\" going forward. \n  Based on the foregoing, the Special Master is inclined to find that the City \ntechnically and substantially complied with paragraph 1, provided that the City \nconfirm  its  good  faith  through  completion  of  the  procedures  related  to  future \ntraining set forth by the Procedures Order, which will result in a \"Calhoun\" training \nprogram with content and in a format acceptable to Plaintiffs. This approach is \nconsistent  with  the  parties'  prospective  focus  and  approach  in  the  Procedures \nOrder.  Accordingly,  compliance  will  be  revisited  in  conjunction  with  future \ncompliance reports. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 9 of 25\n \n  Paragraph 2 - Requirement to provide recurrent \"Calhoun\" training \nconsistent with Section 1 of the 2015 Order every two years. \n  The recurrent training required by paragraph 2 must be completed by August \n2017.  Consequently,  compliance  is  not  ripe  for  determination.  Further,  all \n\"Calhoun\" training has been stayed by the Procedures Order pending approval of a \n\"Calhoun\"  training  program  with  content  and  format  acceptable  to  Plaintiffs.  \nCompliance will be re-visited when this matter is ripe for determination. \n  Paragraph 3 - Requirement for City to provide Plaintiffs' counsel with \n(i) reasonable advance notice of dates and places of proposed training; (ii) \ncopies of proposed training materials sufficiently in advance of training so \nPlaintiffs'  counsel  may  review  and  consult  with  the  City;  (iii)  a  video-\nrecording of each training session conducted pursuant to the 2015 Order; and \n(iv) an affidavit attesting to the names of all officers who attended training \nand the dates of their attendance. \n  Additional fact-finding is necessary before the Special Master can make a \ndetermination as to compliance with paragraph 3. Accordingly, final findings are \nwithheld or deferred out of necessity, provided this issue will be re-visited, as \nnecessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 10 of 25\n \n  Paragraph  4  -  Requirements  to  (a)  within  20  days  amend  any  SOP \ndealing with dress code to require all police officers in uniform to wear a \nconspicuously visible nametag (except in limited circumstances) and (b) to \ndistribute  a  Chief  of  Police  Command  Memorandum  emphasizing  certain \nofficer  identification  requirements  set  forth  more  particularly  in  the  2015 \nOrder. \n  Documents received from the City of Atlanta confirm, at a minimum, timely \npartial or technical compliance with paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b) of the 2015 Order.  \n   By way of illustration with respect to paragraph 4(a), ADP.SOP.2010 and \nADP.SOP.2130 were signed into effect by Chief of Police George Turner on May \n29, 2015 and filed with the Court on June 3, 2015 [Dkt. Nos. 291-2, 291-3], with \nno objection filed by Plaintiffs. They provide (in relevant part) as follows: \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 11 of 25\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 12 of 25\n \n \n  With respect to paragraph 4(b), Chief Turner's Command Memorandum was \ndistributed to each APD employee on May 26, 2015, and APD records confirm the \ndate the Command Memorandum was reviewed by each of 1806 APD officers, \ngenerally on or before May 29, 2015. \n  Notwithstanding these initial findings, the Special Master has  determined \nthat additional fact finding is necessary before a final finding as to compliance \nwould be appropriate. Accordingly, a final finding of compliance is withheld or \ndeferred out of necessity, pending review of additional evidence by the Special \nMaster, and the issue of complete compliance will be re-visited, as necessary and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports. \n  Paragraph 5 - Requirement to provide Plaintiffs' counsel, on or before \nMay 22, 2015, with a spreadsheet providing certain categories of information \nset forth more particularly in the 2015 Order with regard to each complaint of \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 13 of 25\n \npolice  misconduct  and  each  Office  of  Professional  Standards  (OPS) \ninvestigation received or commenced after December 8, 2010. \n  The  record  confirms  that  the  City  did,  in  fact,  provide  Plaintiffs  with  a \nspreadsheet  responsive  to  paragraph  5  on  May  22,  2015.  Disputes  exist  as  to \nwhether the spreadsheet provided on May 22 was fully responsive.  \n  The disputes appear to boil down to reasonable, differing opinions regarding \nthe scope of paragraph 5. Plaintiffs' counsel perceives two deficiencies with respect \nto the City's May 22 production. First, Plaintiffs allege that the spreadsheet lacked \nidentification of \"the law, rule, or SOP the officer was alleged to have violated\" as \nrequired by paragraph 5(e) (emphasis added). Second, Plaintiffs allege that the \nspreadsheet (erroneously) omitted internal investigations, which Plaintiffs contend \nare encompassed by the language including \"each Office of Professional Standards \n(OPS) investigation.\" The City takes the position that the spreadsheet was fully \ncompliant, and, to the extent it was not, the City has cured any deficiency. \n  The  Special  Master  finds  that  the  City's  spreadsheet  was  technically \ncompliant with paragraph 5(e) inasmuch as the spreadsheet, without exception, \nidentifies the specific work rule alleged to have been violated. There can be no \ndispute the paragraph 5(e) requirement is disjunctive.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 14 of 25\n \n  Further, when Plaintiffs raised the issue, the City did not ignore the request, \nbut  treated  it  as  a  \"section  11\"  request,  and  set  out  to  provide  the  additional \ninformation requested, including which SOP was alleged to have been violated. \nIndeed, by June 19, 2015, the City had provided at least three updated spreadsheets \nitemizing all internal investigations within the  more expansive interpretation of \nparagraph  5.  Additionally,  the  City  represents  that  it  has  now  provided \nelectronically  searchable  copies  of  all  responsive  OPS  files  that  support  the \nspreadsheets and provide the SOP alleged to have been violated. Finally, the City \nhas committed (in the Procedures Order) to continue providing all OPS files and \neven  more  comprehensive  OPS  spreadsheets  with  additional  categories  of \ninformation requested by Plaintiffs and the Special Master as necessary to monitor \ncompliance. \n  Without deciding whether or not the initial production was complete, the \nSpecial  Master  finds  that  the  City  has  achieved,  at  a  minimum,  technical  and \nsubstantial compliance with paragraph 5 by curing any apparent deficiencies, if \nany,  despite  reasonable  differing  opinions  as  to  scope.  Nonetheless,  given  the \nongoing nature of the OPS disclosure requirements and the City's commitments, \ncompliance will be re-visited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with \nfuture quarterly reports. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 15 of 25\n \n  Paragraph 6 - Requirement to implement within 60 days a form that is \nacceptable to Plaintiffs' counsel for use in complying with the requirements of \nSection  4  (\"Documentation  of  Warrantless  Seizures\")  and  Section  5 \n(\"Documentation  of  ID  Checks\")  of  the  2010  Order,  to  provide  copies  of \ncompleted forms upon request for same at no charge, and to maintain the \nforms as public records. \n  There is no dispute as to the City's technical compliance with paragraph 6. \nDocumentation confirms that City counsel collaborated with Plaintiffs' counsel to \naccomplish  a  mutually  acceptable  form,  which  was  implemented  by  the  City \nwithin the time frame allotted. A declaration confirming the City's compliance was \nfiled with the Court on July 20, 2015 [Dkt. No. 295], with no objection filed by \nPlaintiffs. \n  Notwithstanding,  Plaintiffs  dispute  whether  the  agreed  forms  are  being \nutilized effectively by APD. Without making a finding as to whether the City's \ntraining program has been effective in this regard, the Special Master finds that the \nCity  has  made  good  faith  efforts  to  train  APD  employees  how  to  utilize  the \nrequired forms. Specifically, the City (by way of example, not an exhaustive list): \n๏ท  implemented ADP.SOP.3020; \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 16 of 25\n \n๏ท  provided  training  on  ADP.SOP.3020  (more  specifically,  Section \n4.5.11  thereof)  in  the  City's  August  2015  training  and  additional \ntraining programs; \n๏ท  conferred with Plaintiffs' counsel to ascertain what would improve the \nAPD's effectiveness in utilizing the forms; and \n๏ท  committed  to  additional  actions  in  furtherance  of  the  strategies \nproposed by Plaintiffs' counsel, including (i) development of a flow \nchart for circulation to APD (upon approval by Plaintiffs of same); \nand  (ii)  agreement  to  coordinate  with  Plaintiffs  to  develop  more \neffective training programs, as set forth in the Procedures Order. \n  Based on the foregoing, the Special Master finds that the City of Atlanta has \ntechnically  and  substantially  complied  with  the  requirements  of  paragraph  6. \nHowever,  due  to  the  ongoing  nature  of  the  City's  commitments  and  potential \nunresolved issues related to the effectiveness of training, compliance will be re-\nvisited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports. \n  Paragraph 7 - Requirement to amend, within 20 days, APD.SOP.3065 to \nrestore certain language. \n  Documents received from the City of Atlanta confirm timely compliance \nwith  the  technical  requirements  of  paragraph  7  of  the  2015  Order.  Revised \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 17 of 25\n \nADP.SOP.3065 was signed into effect by Chief of Police George Turner on May \n29, 2015, and provides as follows: \n \n \n  In addition to technical compliance, the City has taken additional steps to \nensure that the operative language is not later removed.  See, for example, the \nbelow: \n \n \n  Finally, amended ADP.SOP.3065 was filed with the Court on June 3, 2015 \n[Dkt. No. 291-4], with no objection filed by Plaintiffs. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 18 of 25\n \n  Based  on  the  foregoing,  the  Special  Master  finds  that  the  City  timely \ncomplied with the technical requirements of paragraph 7.  Notwithstanding, due to \nthe  ongoing  nature  of  the  paragraph  7  requirements  (see  also,  paragraph  8), \ncompliance will be re-visited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with \nfuture quarterly reports. \n  Paragraph 8 - Requirement that the \"Calhoun\" related amendments to \nSOP's pursuant to 2010 Order and 2011 Order shall be permanent; and City \nshall inform Plaintiffs of any revisions to the affected SOP's within 5 days. \n  The Special Master has reviewed the APD SOP's and has confirmed that \namendments were made to each of the following SOP's in an effort to achieve \ncompliance with the Court Orders: (i) APD.SOP.3020; (ii) APD.SOP.3030; (iii) \nAPD.SOP.3065;  (iv)  APD.SOP.2010;  (v)  APD.SOP.2011;  (vi)  APD.SOP.2130; \n(vii)  APD.SOP.3060;  (viii)  ADP.SOP.1060;  (ix)  ADP.SOP.2020;  (x) \nADP.SOP.2060;  (xi)  ADP.SOP.2080;  (xii)  ADP.SOP.  3110;  and  (xiii) \nADP.SOP.3080. \n  Each of the aforementioned SOP's was signed into effect by Chief of Police \nGeorge Turner on May 29, 2015, and copies of the amended SOP's were filed with \nthis Court as exhibits to a Notice of Compliance filed June 3, 2015 [Dkt. No. 291], \nwith no objection filed by Plaintiffs. With regard to \"Calhoun\" related amendments \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 19 of 25\n \nto the aforementioned SOP's, the City has taken additional steps to ensure that the \noperative  language  is  not  later  removed,  consistent  with  its  handling  of \nADP.SOP.3065 (see above). The City has also represented to the Special Master \nthat the amended SOP's remain in effect as of the filing of this 9/29 Compliance \nReport. Finally, the Procedures Order institutes quarterly review of all SOP's by \nthe  Special  Master  and  Plaintiffs'  counsel  to  guarantee  and  confirm  ongoing \ncompliance. \n  Additional fact finding and scrutiny are necessary before the Special Master \ncan find that the ADP SOP's, as amended, have fully implemented \"all [] revisions \nrequired by [the Court Orders].\"  Therefore, and due to the ongoing nature of the \nparagraph 8 requirements, pending further review, the Special Master believes a \nfinding  of  compliance  eventually  will be  appropriate  and  forthcoming, but  the \nSpecial Master withholds or defers any final finding out of necessity at this time. \nThis issue will be re-visited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with \nfuture quarterly reports. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 20 of 25\n \n  Paragraph  9-  Requirement  to  comply  with  future  post-judgment \ndiscovery requests pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure,  the  Local  Rules  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the \nNorthern District of Georgia, and all Standing Orders of this Court. \n  Based on the agreement of Plaintiffs and the City to stay all pending post-\njudgment discovery requests  and to deal with these matters as set forth in the \nProcedures Order, the Special Master finds that compliance or non-compliance \nwith paragraph 9 is not currently ripe for determination. Accordingly, and because \nadditional fact finding would be necessary for the Special Master to formulate an \nopinion and basis therefor as to compliance, findings are presently withheld or \ndeferred out of necessity, provided this issue will be re-visited, as necessary and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.  \n  Paragraph  10-  Requirement  to  respond  to  outstanding  discovery \nrequests no later than Friday, May 22, 2015. \n  Based on the agreement of Plaintiffs and the City to stay all pending post-\njudgment discovery requests and to deal with these matters as set forth in the \nProcedures Order, the Special Master finds that compliance or non-compliance \nwith  paragraph  10  is  not  currently  ripe  for  determination.  Accordingly,  and \nbecause  additional  fact  finding  would  be  necessary  for  the  Special  Master  to \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 21 of 25\n \nformulate an opinion and basis therefor as to compliance, findings are presently \nwithheld or deferred out of necessity, provided this issue will be re-visited, as \nnecessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.  \n  Paragraph  11-  Requirement  to  comply  within  15  days  with  any \nreasonable request made by Plaintiffs' counsel seeking records or documents \nrelated to the City's compliance with the Court Orders. \n  Based on the agreement of Plaintiffs and the City to stay all pending \"section \n11\" requests and to deal with these matters as set forth in the Procedures Order, the \nSpecial Master finds that compliance or non-compliance with paragraph 11 is not \ncurrently ripe for determination. Accordingly, and because additional fact finding \nwould  be  necessary  for  the  Special  Master  to  formulate  an  opinion  and  basis \ntherefor  as  to  compliance,  findings  are  presently  withheld  or  deferred  out  of \nnecessity, provided this issue will be re-visited, as necessary and appropriate, in \nconjunction with future quarterly reports.  \n  Paragraph 12- Requirement for the City to reimburse Plaintiffs' counsel \nfor any reasonable fees and costs expended to monitor compliance with the \nCourt Orders. \n   The Special Master has reviewed the record related to paragraph 12 and \nfinds that the City is generally and technically compliant; however, due to the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 22 of 25\n \nongoing nature of the paragraph 12 requirements, a final finding is withheld or \ndeferred  out  of  necessity,  and  this  issue  will  be  re-visited,  as  necessary  and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports. \n  Paragraph 13- Requirement to reimburse Plaintiffs' counsel for fees and \ncosts incurred to bring the contempt proceeding. \n   The Special Master has reviewed the record related to paragraph 13 and \nfinds that the City fully complied with the requirement of paragraph 13. \n  Paragraph  14-  Providing  that  the  terms  of  the  2015  Order  (with  a \nlimited exception) shall expire six years from the date of entry and that the \n2015 Order shall have no effect on the terms of the 2010 Order and 2011 \nOrder. \n  Paragraph  14  sets  forth  the  6-year  timeframe  contemplated  by  the  2015 \nOrder and reiterates that the 2015 Order does not overrule, supersede, or otherwise \naffect the requirements set forth by the 2010 Order and the 2011 Order. Beyond \nthese  general  concepts,  paragraph  14  does  not  impose  any  new  or  additional \nrequirements on the City.   \n  Due to the ongoing nature of the paragraph 14 requirements (for 6 years) and \nthe overall applicability to the other requirements of the Court Orders, the Special \nMaster  finds  that  compliance  with  paragraph  14  is  not  presently  ripe  for \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 23 of 25\n \ncompliance and that additional fact finding would be necessary for the Special \nMaster to formulate an opinion and basis therefor as to compliance. Accordingly, a \nfinal finding is withheld or deferred out of necessity, and this issue will be re-\nvisited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports. \nPRELIMINARY CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \n  Generally,  except  as  set  forth  otherwise  above,  the  Special  Master \npreliminarily finds that the City has complied or attempted in good faith to comply \nwith the requirements of the Court Orders after entry of the 2015 Order, provided \nthe Special Master will re-visit all of the initial findings herein in conjunction with \nfuture quarterly reports as additional facts are discovered and evaluated.  \n  Along these lines, the Special Master will continue to develop the record \nrelated to compliance through additional discovery within the powers set forth by \nthe  Special  Master  Order  and  requests  that  the  parties  immediately  make  the \nSpecial  Master  aware  of  any  circumstances  that  would  prevent  a  finding  of \ncompliance, so the Special Master can evaluate the need for an evidentiary hearing \nin advance of the next quarterly compliance report due December 22, 2016.  \n  In light of the foregoing, Special Master respectfully recommends that the \nCourt adopt this 9/29 Compliance Report and defer any further action (beyond \nentry of the Procedures Order) at this time.    \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 324   Filed 09/29/16   Page 24 of 25\n \n  Respectfully submitted by:    /s Joe D.

Whitley, the appointed Special Master, in furtherance \nof the duties imposed by the Court's Order entered June 22, 2016 [Doc. No. 309] \n(the \"Special Master Order\") and FED. R. CIV. P. 53, and pursuant to the Court's \ndirection  in  its  Order  entered  September  27,  2017  [Doc.  No.  377]  (the  \"9/27 \nOrder\"), submits this Special Master Quarterly Compliance Report as of October \n13, 2017 (hereinafter, this \"10/13 Report\"):   \nI.  UPDATE REGARDING PENDING MATTERS \n  The Special Master filed the last Special Master Quarterly Compliance on \nJuly 19, 2017 [Doc. No. 346] (hereinafter, the \"7/14 Report\") setting forth his \ncompliance findings and recommendations to the Court as of July 14, 2017.  As set \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 2 of 10\n \nforth in the 7/14 Report, there are critical disputes among the parties regarding \nwhether  the  City  has  complied  with  the  Court  Orders1  to  date  and  whether \nmodification of the Court Orders is appropriate.  [See 7/14 Report, generally].  In \nlight of such disputes, the Special Master recommended and this Court ordered that \nthe  parties  should  be  heard  on  all  such  matters.    [See  Doc.  Nos.  347,  348 \n(hereinafter, the \"Show Cause Orders\")].   \n  In addition to the Show Cause Orders, the 7/14 Report established a briefing \nschedule related to two other disputed matters: the 180 Day Requirement2; and the \nFee Dispute.3  Subsequent to the 7/14 Report, the City filed a Motion to Reassign \nMatters to the District Court [Doc. No. 375] (\"Motion to Reassign\").  \n                                                 \n1 For purposes of this 10/13 Report, \"Court Orders\" means and collectively refers \nto the Orders entered by this Court on December 8, 2010 (the \"2010 Order\"), \nDecember 15, 2011 (the \"2011 Order\"), May 19, 2015 (the \"2015 Order\"), and \nSeptember 23, 2016 (the \"Procedures Order\"), as well as any requirements set forth \nin the Special Master's prior reports and recommendations to the Court. \n \n2 For purposes of this 10/13 Report, \"180 Day Requirement\" means and refers to \nthe provisions in the 2010 Order and 2011 Order requiring the City to investigate \nand adjudicate \"all citizen complaints of police misconduct of any kind within 180 \ndays of the complaint.\" [See Doc. 265 at ยถ 7; Doc. No. 280 at ยถ 7]. \n \n3  For  purposes  of  this  10/13  Report,  \"Fee  Dispute\"  means  and  refers  to  the \nPlaintiffs' request for attorney's fees from the City pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 \nrelated to the City's Petition for Emergency Relief from Chief Judge of the Federal \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Georgia [See e.g., Doc. Nos. 346, 352, \n360, 373, 386].  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 3 of 10\n \n  These  substantive  matters  (i.e.,  the  Show  Cause  Orders,  the  180  Day \nRequirement, the Fee Dispute, and the Motion to Reassign) remain pending and \nare  addressed  in  greater  detail  below.4    The  Court  has  addressed  all  other \nsubstantive submissions to date. \nA.  The 180 Day Requirement and Fee Dispute are Ripe for Ruling. \n \n  Following the 7/14 Report, the 180 Day Requirement and the Fee Dispute \nhave been fully briefed [see Doc. Nos. 351, 352, 360, 361, 372, 373], and the \nSpecial Master has submitted his reports and recommendations to the Court [see \nDoc. Nos. 386, 387].  As set forth more fully therein, these matters are now ripe for \nruling by the Court.  [Id.]. \nB.  The Motion to Reassign is Ripe for Ruling. \n  The Motion to Reassign has also been fully briefed by the parties [see Doc. \nNos. 375, 380, 384] and the Special Master filed a response brief [see Doc. No. \n381] per this Court's Order directing the same [Doc. No. 377].  As set forth in the \nSpecial Master's response brief [Doc. No. 381], the Special Master will not submit \nany further report and recommendation with regard to the Motion to Reassign \n                                                 \n4 Please note, this 10/13 Report does not address routine matters such as motions \nseeking leave to exceed page limitations, motions to continue, and motions for \nextensions of time.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 4 of 10\n \nunless directed to do so by the Court.  Absent further direction from the Court, the \nSpecial Master submits this matter is now ripe for ruling by the Court.  \nC.  The  Special  Master  Recommends  that  the  Parties  Submit  a \nConsolidated Pretrial Order Regarding the Show Cause Orders. \n \n  With regard to the Show Cause Orders, the parties have completed all of the \npreliminary briefing requested by the Special Master with regard to the Order at \nDoc. No. 348 (hereinafter, the \"Show Cause for Relief Order\").  [See Doc. Nos. \n348, 354, 358, 367, 388].  With regard to the Order at Doc. No. 347 (hereinafter, \nthe \"Show Cause for Contempt Order\"), the City submitted a substantive brief \n[Doc.  No.  363],  and  the  Special  Master  provided  notice  that  he  was  awaiting \nbriefing in response to the Show Cause for Relief Order before determining the \nbriefing schedule with regard to the Show Cause for Contempt Order [Doc. No. \n370].  The Special Master's recommendation for next steps with regard to the Show \nCause Orders is set forth below [see Parts II and III, infra].  \n  In  short,  the  Special  Master  believes  that  further  proceedings  and \npresentation of evidence will be necessary in order to resolve the Show Cause \nOrders but submits that the parties are best positioned to evaluate the extent to \nwhich further briefing and argument will be needed in order for the Court to rule.  \nAccordingly, as set forth in greater detail below, the Special Master recommends \nthat  this  Court  adopt  this  10/13  Report  and  require,  among  other  relief  [see \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 5 of 10\n \ndiscussion Part III infra], that the parties prepare and file a complete, consolidated \n\"Pretrial Order\" in the form approved  by this Court.  To the extent any party \nwishes to waive further briefing and/or argument, they should do so in the parties' \njoint submission to the Court. \nII.  COMPLIANCE RECAP AND THE SHOW CAUSE ORDERS \n  The  Special  Master's  quarterly  reports  have  traditionally  organized \npreliminary compliance findings by the topics identified in the 2010 Order and the \n2011 Order, with references to related issues from the 2015 Order, the Procedures \nOrder, and prior quarterly compliance reports, where appropriate. [See e.g., the \n7/14 Report; see also discussion Part I supra].  This 10/13 report represents a \ndeparture from the Special Master's prior methodology for good cause. 5 \n  As set forth in the 7/14 Report, there were (and remain) substantial disputes \namong the parties regarding whether the City has complied with the Court Orders \nto date and whether modification of the Court Orders is appropriate.  [Id.].  The \n                                                 \n5 The Special Master acknowledges that this report and recommendation is less \ncomprehensive than prior reports but submits this is the appropriate approach in \nlight of the current posture of this case and the pendency of the Show Cause \nOrders.  Of course, nothing in this 10/13 Report is intended to (nor shall it) modify, \nalter, or amend any of the Court's Orders.  Furthermore, these limited findings are \nsubject to further review and revision, and no party is deemed to have waived any \nevidentiary rights or objections. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 6 of 10\n \nSpecial Master recommended and this Court ordered that the parties should be \nheard on all such matters.  [See Doc Nos. 347, 348].     \n  Since  the  7/14  Report,  the  prior-reported  disputes  generally  remain,  and \nadditional disputes continue to emerge.  By way of example only, and not as an \nexhaustive  list,  the  parties  now  disagree  as  to  whether  the  Atlanta  Police \nDepartment's  Standard  Operating  Procedures  have  been  revoked  or  amended \nconsistent with the requirements of the Court Orders [see e.g., October 12, 2017 \ncorrespondence from Plaintiffs' Counsel attached hereto as Exhibit A, at ยถ3; see \nalso  October  13,  2017  correspondence  from  City  Counsel  attached  hereto  as \nExhibit B, at ยถ3], whereas the Special Master was previously unaware of any \nissues related to this particular requirement of the Court Orders [see 7/14 Report \nPart IV.1 pp. 11-13].  There are also now disputes related to Calhoun Training [see \nExhibit A at ยถ4; compare Exhibit B at ยถ4] that did not exist previously [see 7/14 \nReport Part IV.6 pp. 25-26].  The theme that continues to emerge is that the parties \ndo  not  agree  on  much  of  anything  related  to  the  City's  obligations  under  and \ncompliance with the Court Orders. \n  In lieu of revisiting in comprehensive detail each of the compliance issues \nthat remains outstanding as of this 10/13 Report, the Special Master incorporates \nby reference his 7/14 Report, the parties' compliance submissions attached hereto \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 7 of 10\n \nas Exhibit A and Exhibit B respectively, and all substantive briefing submitted by \nthe parties and the Special Master during the period from July 14, 2017 through \nOctober 13, 2017 [see e.g., discussion Part I supra], and reiterates and renews his \nprior analysis and recommendation that the parties should be given the opportunity \nto be heard regarding compliance with and modification of the Court Orders in \naccordance with applicable legal standards, as contemplated by the Show Cause \nOrders [Doc. Nos. 347, 348].   \n  At  this  juncture,  the  Special  Master  submits  that  the  parties  are  best \npositioned to evaluate the extent to which further briefing and argument will be \nneeded in order for the Court to rule.   Accordingly,  and  in  order  to  facilitate \nprompt review of these pending matters (either by the Special Master or the Court), \nthe  Special  Master  recommends  that  the  Court  adopt  this  report  and \nrecommendation, requiring the parties on or before January 12, 2018: (i) first, to \nmeet in person for a settlement conference and discuss resolution of any issues \npresented by the Show Cause Orders that can be resolved by agreement between \nthe parties; (ii) second, to prepare and file a joint report regarding the result of the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 8 of 10\n \nsettlement conference; and (iii) third, to prepare and file a complete, consolidated \n\"Pretrial Order\" in the form approved by this Court.6   \n  Upon filing of the Pretrial Order, the Special Master or the Court (depending \non the Court's ruling on the Motion to Reassign) will make necessary arrangements \nfor further proceedings on the Show Cause Orders consistent with the parameters \nset forth by the parties in the Pretrial Order, whereby all parties will be provided a \nfair  opportunity  to  present  their  evidence  and  argument  in  accordance  with \napplicable legal standards. \nIII.    CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \n  Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth in this report, the Special Master's \ncomplete recommendation to the Court is as follows: \n  (1)   that  the  Court  enter  an  order  adopting  this  10/13  Report  and \nrecommendation in the same or substantially similar form as the proposed order \nattached hereto as Exhibit C; and \n  (2)  that the Court grant such other appropriate relief as it deems just and \nproper. \n \n \n                                                 \n6 See NDGa LR 16.4A; see also NDGa Pretrial Instructions at Part VIII., available \nat: http://www.gand.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/PretrialInstructions.pdf.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 391   Filed 10/23/17   Page 9 of 10\n \n              Respectfully submitted by:     \n              /s Joe D.

      "text": "Case 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 1 of 42\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA \nATLANTA DIVISION \n \nGEOFFREY CALHOUN, et al.,    ) \n              ) \nPlaintiffs,           ) \n              ) \nv.              )  CIVIL ACTION FILE NO. \n              )  1:09-CV-3286-TCB \nRICHARD PENNINGTON et al  ) \n              ) \nDefendants.         ) \n \n \nDEFENDANTSโ RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFSโ MOTION \nTO COMPEL DISCOVERY AND FOR SANCTIONS  \n \n  COMES NOW, Defendants in the above-styled case and files this response \nin opposition to Plaintiffsโ motion to compel as follows:   \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nThe Defendants first respond to the Plaintiffsโ Motion to Compel by stating \nthat despite the protestations and overwrought demands, that all of the reasonably \nrelevant  documents  to  which  the  Plaintiffs  would  be  entitled  under  the  Civil \nPractice Act have been produced or offered for production. \nIn  this  motion,  Plaintiffs  request  that  Defendants  be  compelled  to  file \nresponses to Plaintiffsโ various Requests for Document Production and Requests \nfor Interrogatories.  The motion follows a complex format stating that Defendants \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 2 of 42\nhave failed to preserve evidence, failed to search for responsive items and failed to \ncomply with the Courtโs orders.  While Plaintiffsโ motion is impressively thick and \nfilled  with  attachments,  it  does  not  place  the  factual  content  and  the  subject \ndiscovery requests and responses in their full context.  An examination of the \ncircumstances surrounding this motion demonstrates that Plaintiffsโ motion and the \nrelief sought is unwarranted and unnecessary.  Therefore, Plaintiffsโ motion should \nbe denied. \nII.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \nDespite the strident protestations of Plaintiffsโ counsel, the Defendants in \nthis matter have not engaged in any willful conduct that would justify the relief \nrequested.  While  Defendants  concede  that  discovery  in  this  matter  has  not \nprogressed as smoothly as either side would have anticipated, this is not solely the \nresponsibility of Defendants.  \nThis case originally was filed on November 24, 2009 alleging constitutional \nviolations relative to an event that occurred on September 10, 2009 at the Atlanta \nEagle. Service was effectuated by consent of the City on January 4, 2010 and the \nappropriated waivers were filed thereafter. At the time of filing and service of the \nComplaint, the named defendants were the City, Chief Pennington and Officers \nBridges, Noble and Watkins, along with Jane and John Does 1-45. The Answer to \nthe original Complaint was filed March 1, 2010. The Complaint was amended on \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 3 of 42\nMarch 17, 2010 and for the first time the current defendants were added as parties. \nInitial discovery to the individual defendants was served April 5, 2010. \nDiscovery that originally was undertaken by previous defense counsel in this \ncase resulted in the intervention by the Court in the partiesโ discovery disputes. As \nnoted by Plaintiffs, there was a teleconference with the Court on August 20, 2010 \nat a point in the litigation where new defense counsel had been substituted into the \ncase. Neither of the two original attorneys who had worked the case was associated \nwith the Cityโs Law Department at that time, and newly substituted counsel was \nattempting to familiarize themselves with this case as well as some thirty other \ncases that had to be reassigned. The conference progressed as a fairly one-sided \nrecitation by Plaintiffsโ counsel of what he perceived to have been abuse of the \ndiscovery  process  and  concluded  with  the  Courtโs  directive  that  Defendants \ncooperate fully with Plaintiffsโ discovery requests, including, inter alia, permitting \nPlaintiffsโ counsel to conduct site visits to review documents in the places where \nthey were maintained.  \nCounsel conferred by telephone  after this teleconference to determine how \nbest to proceed and at the behest of defense counsel, Plaintiffsโ counsel and the \ndefense counsel met on August 25, 2010, at the Cityโs Law Department for their \nfirst  in  person  conference.  During  this  meeting,  defense  counsel  sought  to \ndetermine from plaintiffsโ counsel the particular concerns of counsel regarding \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 4 of 42\ndiscovery and the proposed methods that counsel intended to pursue relative to \nforensic and electronic discovery. This meeting was followed by a series of email \ncommunications that provided further clarification to defense counsel as to process \nfor producing the required information. \nThe  parties  made  arrangements to  get the site visits underway,  with the \ninitial visit at APD Headquarters occurring on August 27. Prior to that site visit, \nthe parties had been communicating regarding the logistics for providing access to \ncell phones, electronically stored data and emails. During the course of the initial \nsite visit, it became obvious to defense counsel, based upon the manner in which \nthe site visit was progressing, that the parameters of the Courtโs directive were so \nbroadly drawn as to make it difficult for counsel to be certain that they were in \ncompliance. As a result, defense counsel requested another teleconference with the \nCourt and that conference occurred the same day. \nDuring the August 27 conference, defense counsel advised the Court that \nthat they felt they would be better able to comply with the Courtโs directive, if an \norder were to be issued that would provide better guidance. Again, it should be \nnoted that newly assigned defense counsel was still in the process of becoming \nfamiliar  with  this  case.  Counsel  also  informed  the  Court  of  the  difficulty  in \ncomplying with the Plaintiffsโ request for cell phones being turned over for as long \nas four (4) days per forensic examination. While the Court originally agreed to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 5 of 42\nenter an order summarizing the conference that was to be drafted by Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel, the Court later recanted and chose not to do so. The Court did, however, \nagree that cell phones could not be in Plaintiffsโ control for longer than twenty-four \n(24) hours. \nThe parties then proceeded to complete the site visits at Headquarters and \nthe  Office  of  Professional  Standards  on  August  27  and  August  30  and  on \nSeptember  1.  Thereafter,  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  having  identified  thousands  of \ndocuments that he wanted copied, defense counsel proceeded to copy the requested \ndocuments  and  turn  them  over  to  Plaintiffsโ  counsel.  At  Plaintiffsโ  request, \ndocuments  that  were  archived  in  storage  were  retrieved  and  produced  for \ninspection. Cell phone content was retrieved, transferred to disc1 and provided to \nPlaintiffs. During the site visits, Plaintiffsโ counsel identified by serial number, the \ncomputer hard drives that he wanted his expert to inspect. \nWith regard to the larger body of electronic data stored on the Cityโs servers, \ndue to the unlimited nature of the Courtโs directive, Plaintiffsโ counsel demanded \nthat the entire universe of electronic files for seven thousand seven hundred (7,700) \nusers, including lawyers, be downloaded and provided to him. His request was \nbased upon deposition testimony of the IT staff that suggested this was a readily \navailable universe of information that routinely is archived every 30 days. Upon \n                                                           \n1 Approximately 22 discs were provided to Plaintiffsโ counsel.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 6 of 42\ndefense counselโs objection and request that counsel limit the scope by naming the \nindividuals  whose  files  were  essential,  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  insisted  he  was  not \nlimited by the Courtโs directive and demanded retrieval of the entire universe of \ninformation. To facilitate the retrieval process, the Cityโs IT staff and Plaintiffsโ \nexpert engaged in a four and a half hour telephone conference with Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel to sort the logistics of the production. Following this conference, it was \ndetermined that the process of retrieval would require several thousand man hours \nas each of the 7,700 individual files would take four (4) hours to download. It was \nonly  after  this  determination  that  counsel  agreed  to  specify  certain  files  to  be \nretrieved and in communication with defense counsel explained that it was never \nhis intent to get all 7,700 files; that the testimony of the Cityโs IT staff had led him \nto  believe  that  the  emails  were  conveniently  accessible.  These  were  then \ndownloaded and provided by defense counsel. In addition, existing back-up tapes \nwere provided to counsel pursuant to the Courtโs August 20, 2010 and subsequent \ndirectives. \nPlaintiffsโ  counsel  also  raised  the  issue  of  spoliation  with  the  Court \nfollowing the conference with the IT staff when it was discovered that back-up \ntapes were being re-used. However, the Court was persuaded that defense counsel \nhad instituted measures to correct this situation. Immediately after the close of the \nteleconference with the IT staff, defense counsel issued a written directive to the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 7 of 42\nCityโs IT staff to discontinue overriding back-up tapes. In addition, the Cityโs IT \nDepartment invested $80,000.00 for a new Symantec Netbackup Dedupe digital \nstorage system that allowed the City to abandon the use of back-up tapes with \nsoftware applications that more efficiently facilitates e-discovery. \nIn the last conversation that defense counsel had with Plaintiffsโ counsel \nwhen he came to inspect retrieved archived documents, it appeared to  defense \ncounsel that the parties were continuing to make satisfactory progress in complying \nwith the Courtโs directive. The next day, defense counsel was surprised to learn \nthat Plaintiffsโ counsel felt it necessary to file the motion that is now before the \nCourt. \nIII.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \nAt the time of the initial conference with the Court on August 20, 2010, \nDefense counsel Robert N. Godfrey and Tamara Baines had been involved in this \ncase for only a few weeks at most. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 1; \nExhibit C, Affidavit of Tamara Nikki Baines, ยถ 2).  As a result, as of the August 20 \nteleconference,  there  had  been  no  time  to  assess  the  status  of  this  case  and \ncounselโs  participation  was  limited  to  listening  to  the  assertions  of  Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel as to what had or had not been accomplished in discovery. Thus, when the \nCourt issued its directive that defense counsel was required to cooperate fully in \ndiscovery with their defenses having been summarily dismissed,  defense counsel \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 8 of 42\nessentially  had  to  depend  upon  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  to  provide  some  specific \ndirection as to what he saw as deficiencies.  (Exhibit C, Affidavit of Tamara Nikki \nBaines, ยถ 9). \nDefense  counsel  invited  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  to  confer  and  the  resulting \nmeeting concluded on a positive note and in the spirit of mutual cooperation on a \ngoing forward basis. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 2).  One of the \nmajor areas discussed during this meeting was the ongoing need for patience from \nplaintiffsโ counsel as defense counsel attempted to familiarize themselves with the \nissues in dispute.  (Id.) \nUpon initial investigation, counsel determined that over twenty  thousand  \n(20,000) documents had been produced by Defendants prior to August 20, based \nupon  the  Bates-stamped  record  available  to  counsel.  (Exhibit  B,  Affidavit  of \nRobert  N.  Godfrey,  ยถ  10).    Since  that  time,  in  the  full  spirit  of  cooperation, \ndefendants  have  produced  and  continue  to  produce  an  equivalent  amount  of \ndocuments  that  they  believe  to  be  responsive  to  Plaintiffsโ  requests.  (Id.)    A \nsummary of the document production by type and related Bates number is attached \nas Exhibit A. \nFollowing the August 20 conference, defense counsel arranged an all hands \nmeeting  with  the  named  defendants  and  their  superiors  to  inform  them  of  the \ncourtโs directive. (Exhibit C, Affidavit of Tamara Nikki Baines, ยถ 9).  At that \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 9 of 42\nmeeting,  defendants  were  provided  with  a  questionnaire  that  sought  relevant \ninformation regarding cell phones and social media pages. (Id.)  There was some \nconcern expressed during that meeting when the officers were informed that their \ncell phones would be out of their possession for as long as four days, based upon \nthe representation of  Plaintiffsโ counsel that this would be the amount of time \nneeded for a forensic review. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 5; \nExhibit  C,  Affidavit  of  Tamara  Nikki  Baines).    This  issue  was  addressed  to \nPlaintiffsโ counsel for a possible compromise solution that ultimately had to be \naddressed by the Court in a subsequent teleconference. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of \nRobert N. Godfrey, ยถ 5).  During that latter conference on August 27, the Court \nlimited the Plaintiffs to a 24 hour period for the forensic analysis. Defendants \nnever refused to hand over the cell phones for review. (Id.)  Moreover, Defendants \nutilized  the  APDโs  technical staff  to  download  a  complete copy  of  everything \ncurrently on the telephones and deliver the downloaded information to Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel. (Id.) \nAfter the meeting with the officers and their command staff, arrangements \nwere then made to provide Plaintiffsโ counsel with the access to Police Department \nfiles. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 3). Complete access to the files \nwas provided in the company of defense counsel on August 27, August 30 and on \nSeptember 1, 2010. (Id.)  Plaintiffsโ counsel was permitted to look into any file \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 10 of 42\ncabinet, desk or storage area that he desired and to designate for copying and \nproduction any individual file, file drawer or other set of files he desired.  (Id.) \nThese documents then were accumulated, copied, Bates stamped and scanned to \ndisc  for  counselโs  convenience.  (Id.)    In  addition,  wherever  counsel  located \ndocuments  that  he  wanted  copied,  he  was  provided  those  copies  as  well  as \nduplicates in the overall scanned production.  (Id.) \nIn addition to reviewing documents, Plaintiffsโ counsel identified computers \nthroughout  APD  Headquarters  that  he  wanted  made  available  for  a  forensic \nanalysis  of  the  hard  drive  by  his  request.  (Exhibit  B,  Affidavit  of  Robert  N. \nGodfrey, ยถ 4).  Those computers remain in place and await the forensic analysis by \nthe expert. What the parties agreed was to have the Plaintiffsโ expert come in and \nclone the hard drive of each identified computer for off-site analysis. (Id.) This \nremains to be done. (Id.) \nThe electronic data that counsel requested the City to provide included back-\nup tapes from the Cityโs servers as well as existing user files. (Exhibit B, Affidavit \nof Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 8).  This would have been in addition to the files that \nwould be recovered from the individual hard drives of the computers identified at \nthe various APD offices that Defendants agreed to produce and also would have \nbeen a duplication of those files. (Id.)  As an initial matter, defense counsel sought \nsome consideration from plaintiffsโ counsel from the enormity of such a production \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 11 of 42\nthat would involve the files of 7,700 City users, including lawyers and individuals \nnot remotely related to the claims in the case. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. \nGodfrey, ยถ 7).  Defense counsel suggested that it would be more productive to \nattempt to limit the production to a specific set of users whose documents might \nprove relevant. (Id.) In response, counsel insisted that he was in no way limited by \nthe Courtโs directive, that all objections had been overruled and that he intended \nfor Defendants to provide him, in a readable medium, the entire universe of the \n7,700 files. (Id.) \nIn an effort to reason with plaintiffsโ counsel, defense counsel suggested that \nthe Cityโs IT staff and the Plaintiffsโ expert be included in a teleconference to \ndiscuss the feasibility of the request and the logistics of the production. (Exhibit B, \nAffidavit  of  Robert  N.  Godfrey,  ยถยถ  7,  8).    After  a  four  and  a  half  hour \nteleconference, Plaintiffsโ counsel continued to demand the 7,700 files. (Exhibit B, \nAffidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 7). \nThe Cityโs IT staff then undertook to analyze the feasibility of compliance \nand determined that it would require several thousand man-hours to comply. (Id.)  \nEach of the 7,700 files would require a four (4) hour timeframe to be downloaded. \nGiven this information, Plaintiffsโ counsel finally agreed to provide a list of the \nindividuals whose files he desired and this data was downloaded to a portable hard \ndrive and given to Plaintiffsโ counsel. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 12 of 42\nยถ 8, 11).  At the same time this hard drive was hand-delivered to counsel, the \nexisting back-up tapes were delivered. (Id.)  However, counsel did not take the \nback-up tapes with him and they remain available for production to him.  (Id.) \nPlaintiffsโ counsel and defense counsel were continuously in communication \nthroughout the period prior to the filing of the motion to compel and defense \ncounsel was attempting on almost a daily basis to satisfy the demands of Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, ยถ 9).  When it was determined \nthat  Chief  Penningtonโs  files  were  no  longer  in  the  active  files  at  APD \nHeadquarters,  the  archived  files  were  immediately  retrieved  from  storage  and \npresented to Plaintiffsโ counsel for unfettered inspection. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of \nRobert N. Godfrey, ยถ 3). The Pennington files were made available on the same \nday he appeared to inspect the downloaded cell phone records. (Id.) \nIn one conversation with Plaintiffsโ counsel that occurred on the day of the \nsite  visit  to  the  Atlanta  Police  Departmentโs  Office  of  Professional  Standard \n(OPSโ),  when  it  appeared  that  the  parties  were  done  with  the  particulars  of \ndocument  production,  defense  counsel  inquired  as  to  what  specifically  was \noutstanding that counsel was seeking. (Exhibit B, Affidavit of Robert N. Godfrey, \nยถ 9).  The response was that the previous responses to interrogatories and requests \nfor production of documents needed to be supplemented. (Id.) Defense counsel \nagreed that that would be done and then inquired about the second set of discovery \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 13 of 42\nrequests. (Id.)  The response, as defense counsel understood it, was that the second \nrequests were not significantly different from the first and that supplementing the \noriginal responses should suffice. (Id.) Those responses were in fact supplemented \nand served on counsel. \nIV.  ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY \nA. THE  MOTION  TO  COMPEL  SHOULD  BE  DISMISSED \nFOR FAILURE TO ENGAGE IN A GOOD FAITH EFFORT \nTO RESOLVE DISCOVERY DISPUTES. \n \nIt is well-established that a โrange of choiceโ exists in how a District Court may \nrule on a motion to compel.  United States v. Kelly, 888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir. \n1989).  However, before filing a motion to compel further disclosures or discovery \npursuant  to  Rule  37(a),  the  aggrieved  party  must  attempt  to  confer  with  the \nunresponsive party in an effort to obtain the desired material without court action. \nAll motions to compel must include a certification that such an effort has been \nmade. Rule 37(d)(1)(B) has a similar requirement for a party who moves for Rule \n37(b) sanctions due to an opponent's failure to serve interrogatory answers or to \nserve a response to a document request. Plaintiffโs Motion to Compel should be \ndismissed for failure to engage and certify that, prior to filing this motion, counsel \nfor Plaintiff has contacted counsel for Defendants in a good faith effort to resolve \nthe  matters  in  Plaintiffโs  Motion  pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  Civil  Procedure  37 \n(a)(1).   \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 14 of 42\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) provides, in pertinent part: \n \nOn notice to other parties and all affected persons, a party may move for \nan order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a \ncertification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to \nconfer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in \nan effort to obtain it without court action. \n \nAll of Plaintiffsโ attempts to engage in a good faith resolution of discovery \nissues occurred before the telephone conference with Judge Batten on August 20, \n2010. During the time prior to the conference call, Plaintiffsโ counsel was on notice \nthat the attorney of record was no longer employed with the City and that new \ncounsel was being substituted. Plaintiffsโ counsel specifically requested the August \n20, 2010 conference to address discovery issues related to the timeframe before the \nsubstitution of the current counsel for Defendants. Moreover, Defendantsโ counsel, \nBob  Godfrey,  engaged  in  several  conversations  with  Plaintiffโs  counsel,  Dan \nGrossman, regarding compliance with previous discovery requests. At no time, \nbetween the timeframe of September 14, 2010 and prior to the filing of this instant \nmotion, did Defendantsโ counsel assert that Defendants were not in compliance \nwith production of discovery.  \nB. THE CITY HAS COMPLIED WITH THE COURTโS \nAUGUST 20, 2010 TELEPHONE CONFERENCE \nDIRECTIVES. \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 15 of 42\nPlaintiffsโ counsel alleges that Defendants have failed to comply with the \nCourtโs directives from the August 20, 2010 telephone conference. Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel alleges that the Defendants are not in compliance with regards to the \nfollowing:  (1)  production  of  individuals  Defendantsโ  mobile  phones  and \nphotographs  for  inspection,  (2)  production  of  โexistingโ  backup  tapes,  (3) \ninspection  of  original  documents  at  the  offices  of  the  Atlanta  Police \nDepartment,  and  (4)  Production  of  30(b)(6)  witness.  (Plaintiffโs  Motion  to \nCompel Discovery and for Sanctions, pp. 5-8). However, review of the Courtโs \ndirections  and  Defendantsโ  actual  responses  do  not  support  Plaintiffโs \ncontentions.  Defendants  will  address  the  general  issues  as  articulated  in \nPlaintiffโs instant motion and then address each of the specific issues articulated \nin Exhibit A to Plaintiffโs instant motion. \nFirst,  the  Court  specifically  directed  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  to  inform \nDefendantsโ counsel of any perceived noncompliances with discovery: \nโMr. Grossman, Iโll allow you to point out to defendantsโ counsel any \nalleged noncompliances that you would like to see corrected in the form \nof supplemental responses.โ Courtโs August 20, 2010 Order, p. 9. \n \nIn the instant case, Plaintiff has failed to engage in a good faith effort to \naddress any perceived problems with the current discovery responses as of \nAugust 20, 2010, before filing this motion nor has Plaintiff filed the required \ncertification of good faith as required pursuant to FRCP 37 or pursuant to the \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 16 of 42\nCourtโs August 20, 2010 order.2  As such, Plaintiffโs Motion to Compel should be \ndismissed.  \n1.  Defendants  are  in  compliance  with  the  Courtโs  August  20,  2010 \ndirective regarding the requested photographs. \n \nPlaintiffsโ counsel alleges noncompliance with providing photographs of the \nofficers. However, the court addressed this issue in its August 20, 2010 order: \nโIt seems to me that what you [Plaintiffsโ counsel, Dan Grossman] ought to \ndo is look at those pictures first and see if theyโre sufficient, And I would \nthink they probably would be. Be if you still feel that theyโre not sufficient, \nIโm going to find that they need--that these individual defendants need to go \nto Lambda Legal. But donโt make them go if the pictures are good enough. \nCourtโs August 20, 2010 Order, p.14. \n \nIn  this  passage,  the Court  referenced  Defendantsโ  counsel proposal to have \nindividual Defendants go to Lamda Legal in order to have their pictures taken. \nโI  noticed  [that]  the  City  has  made  the  offer  โฆto  have  the  remaining \ndefendants travel to Lambda Legal and have their photographs taken at their \nconvenience.  That  sounds  about  as  reasonable  as  the  Court  could  ever \nimagine. Courtโs August 20, 2010 Order, p.6. \n \nAs  such,  any  issues  regarding  individual  Defendantโs  photographs  could \nhave been easily resolved by Plaintiffsโ request of Defendantsโ initial offer.  \nAs established below, Defendants provided photographs to Plaintiffs, which \nPlaintiffs then complained as to the color and visual characteristics of the group of \npictures,  without  specifying  a  single  picture  that  did  not  meet  his  personal \n                                                           \n2  โI assume that counselโs seen my instruction to the parties and counsel that they \nneed to try to resolve these disputes by agreements.โ See Courtโs Order, August \n20, 2010, pg. 5. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 17 of 42\npreference.  Instead  of  complying  to  the  Courtโs  August  20,  2010  order  with \nregards  to  Lambda  Legal  taking  the  photographs,  and  without  conferring  with \nDefendants,  Plaintiffs  filed  this  motion  stating  that  Defendants  were  not  in \ncompliance regarding production of photographs.  \n2.  Defendants are in good faith compliance with the Courtโs August 20, \n2010  and  August  27,  2010  directives  regarding  the  production  of \nmobile phones. \n \nThe courtโs August 20, 2010 order granted that Defendantsโ would provide \nelectronic  mobile  phones  and  Blackberries  for  Plaintiffโs  inspection.  In  the \nsubsequent August 27, 2010, the court directed: \nThe one thing I do want the Plaintiffs to do and to confer with the \nDefendants  to  make  sure  is  done  appropriately  is  to  make \narrangements  for  the  inspection  of  these  cell  phones  and  other \nelectronic  devices  over  a  period  of  days  so  that  each  individual \ndefendant who produces his phone only has to be without his phone \nfor one day. (Courtโs August 27, 2010 order, pg. 10). \n \n  Plaintiffsโ  and  Defendantsโ  counsel  did  confer,  and  decided  to  have  the \nCityโs Homeland Security Department complete an initial analysis of Defendantsโ \nphones to capture all images and written communications. Then after examination \nof the initial analysis, Plaintiffsโ counsel would identify any individual phone that \nthey  wanted  for  a  forensic  analysis.  Here  again,  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  has \nmisconstrued the Courtโs directive. Defendants provided an initial report of 22 out \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 18 of 42\nof the 34 individual officers named.3 Instead of adhering to the joint agreement, \nPlaintiffs now file this instant motion, without providing any notice to Defendants \nof which phones would be required for forensic analysis.  \n3.  Defendants  are  in  compliance  with  the  Courtโs  August  20,  2010 \ndirectives regarding the inspection of site visits and production of \ndocuments.  \n \nPlaintiffs allege that all documents were not produced; however review of \nthe record does not support this contention. In order to facilitate Plaintiffsโ counsel \nrequest  for  original  documents,  the  court  ordered  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  to  have  \ncomplete access to inspect the site of police headquarters, including individualsโ \nworkspaces,  OPS  investigations  headquarters,  commanding  officersโ  files,  and \nother locations. As part of the site inspection, Plaintiffโs counsel was allowed to \nnote and mark documents to be copied. However, Plaintiffs counsel now alleges \nthat  Defendants  compliance  with  the  Courtโs  order  indicates  Defendantโs \nintentionally withheld documents. However, Plaintiffโs allegations are confusing, \nwhen one reviews the Courtโs order. \nMR. GROSSMAN: I would like to mention the subject of paper files. \nThe City has refused, in fact Ms. Baines refusedโฆ, to allow us to inspect \nand copy original documents. They are only willing to provide photocopies \nof the documents made by the defendants themselves. \n \n                                                           \n3 Additional cell phone reports have been provided to Plaintiffsโ counsel for \nremaining officers. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 19 of 42\nMS. BAINES: Well, we produced a number of documents. It would \nbe very difficult for us to take a lot of these original documents out of \ncirculation to them make them available to the plaintiffsโฆ \nMS. BAINES (CONโT): Now, we will allow himโฆ to check it against \nthe originals, but we donโt want to have these [original] documents leaked, \nto be taken off site. \n \nTHE  COURT:  All  right.  Now  that  โฆto  me  seems  reasonable.  I \nunderstand why you want to look at the โฆoriginal document. And if sheโs \ntelling you  weโll make you a copy of everything and then you can come \ndown  at  that  time  when  you  pick  up  the  copies  or  sometime  shortly \nthereafter and compare them to the originals, to the extent you want to make \nsure that the copies are authentic, that seems reasonable.  \n \nCourtโs August 20, 2010 Order, pp. 17-18.   \n \nMR. GROSSMAN (Plaintiffโs Counsel): We simply wanted access to \nlook  at  the  original  documents  in  the  place  where  theyโre  stored  in  the \nordinary course of business. And part of the reason weโre concerned about is \nthat Major Williams testified that the paper files of numerous people were \nnever searched. So, we would like the opportunity to look at these files, \nwhere theyโre stored in the ordinary course of business, take a look at how \ntheyโre stored, what kind of file numbering system there is. Removing them \nis less important than having a chance to inspect them so that we know \nweโre getting everything that might exist. \n \n  THE  COURT:  Well,  it  doesnโt  sound  to  me  like  you  want  a  document \ninspection. You want an inspection of the premises. \n \n  MR. GROSSMAN: Weโre not asking for that, Judge. \n \nTHE COURT (CONTโD): Ms. Baines, you just take them on a tour over \nthere and show them where the documents are and let them see the actual original \nfiles to see how things are maintained. And they can take notes, but notโbut not \npictures, but they can take notes of what they see and that type thing. \nMS. BAINES: All right, Your Honor.  \n \nCourtโs August 20, 2010 Order, pp. 17-19.   \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 20 of 42\nPlaintiffs admit that on August 27, August 30, and September 1, 2010,  they \nwere permitted to inspect the Atlanta Police Department offices in compliance with \nthe Courtโs August 20, 2010 directives. (Plaintiffโs Motion to Compel, pg. 7.) Not \nonly did Defendants comply with the Courtโs order for site inspection, but in a \ngood faith cooperation, allowed Plaintiffโs counsel to mark any documents that he \nwanted copied and produced. Following counsel site visits, all documents marked \nwere copied and produced to him. This allowance was not ordered in the Courtโs \nAugust 20 or August 27 orders, but constituted Defendants good faith  compliance \nwith any outstanding discovery issues.  \n4.  The Cityโs 30 (b)(6) witness was sufficient. \n \nLastly,  Plaintiffโs  counsel  goes  to  extreme  lengths  to  suggest  that \nDefendantsโ 30(b)(6) witness, Debra Williams, was not prepared and that costs \nand/or sanctions should be awarded. It is incredulous to believe that the witness \nwas not prepared sufficiently when her testimony is so heavily relied upon to \nbuttress the averments of Plaintiffโs instant motion. Specifically, Plaintiffsโ counsel \nquotes at length testimony obtained from Williams that alerted him to perceived \nissues of noncompliance. Moreover, Williamsโ deposition occurred on August 5 \nand August 10, 2010, more than 10 days before the August 20, 2010 conference \nwith Judge Batten regarding discovery issues. The August 20, 2010 conference is \nvoid of any objection or dissatisfaction with testimony Williams provided as the \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 21 of 42\nCityโs  30  (b)(6)  witness.  Moreover,  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  contends  that  he  was \nprovided  another  witness  from  the  Cityโs  Department  of  Technology,  Jeremy \nJohnson, to answer questions regarding the City technical infrastructure. Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel, remarkably, now characterizes the Cityโs production of these witnesses as \nnoncompliance, although he is notably silent on this issue in both the August 20 \nand August 27, 2010 record from the court.  \nC. SPECIFIC ALLEGED FAILURES TO COMPLY \nThe specific issues raised in the motion to compel were set forth separately \nwithin Appendix A to the motion (Doc. 236-1). Those issues will be addressed in \nthe order presented in Appendix A. \n1.  First Request for Production No. 2 \nThis request sought disciplinary files for the Defendant officers. In response, \nthe City produced two sets of documents which it believed satisfied the request. \nThe  entire  personnel  file  of  each  of  the  Defendants  was  produced  with  the \npresumption  that  all  personnel  related  matters  would  be  captured  within  the \npersonnel files, including pre-employment investigations that normally are retained \nin all City employeesโ personnel files. The City also produced any investigative \nfiles relating to complaints against the officers that were maintained separately by \nthe  Office  of  Professional  Standards  (OPS).  The  OPS  files  were  updated  and \nsupplemented after the August 20, 2010 court directive. It was later determined \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 22 of 42\nthat there also existed separate background investigation files for the officers that \nwere maintained by the recruitment arm of the APD. However, the information in \nthose  files  do  not  relate  to  disciplinary  concerns  relative  to  an  APD  officerโs \nperformance as an employee with the City of Atlanta. Moreover, as many of the \nofficers have been employed by the City for more than ten or twenty years, the \ninformation in those files would relate to whatever was uncovered as part of a \nbackground  investigation  that  may  be  decades  old.  Even  so,  those  files  were \nlocated,  copied  and  produced  in  a  supplemental  production  as  document  nos. \n36501-41111.4,5 \n2.  First Request for Production No. 2 \nThis request sought training records of the officers. Once again the records \nwere presumed to have been a part of the officersโ personnel files, as they are for \nother City employees, including other public safety personnel such as firefighters. \nIn fact there were training records within the personnel files that were produced, \nalthough those records reflect general training requirements for all City employees \nand  did  not  include  records  from  the  officersโ  training  period  at  the  Training \nAcademy. As with the background investigation files, many of the officers training \nrecords may be decades old due to the amount of time they have been employed. \n                                                           \n4 The files of the following defendants could not be found: George Turner, Herman \nGlass, Cayenne Mayes, Scott Perry and Debra Williams. \n5 Defendants made a supplemental production after the filing of the motion to \ncompel. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 23 of 42\nThe records of the officers from the Training Academy have been produced in a \nsupplemental production as document nos. 33885-36400. \n3.  First Request for Production No. 5 \nThis request asked for all personnel records of the officers and in response \nthe personnel files were produced with the presumption that the personnel files \ncontained all relevant documents. Since the August 20th directive from the Court, \nas noted above, background investigation and training files have been produced as \na supplement to the original production. \n4.  First Request for Production No. 6 \nThis request asked for all documents concerning OPS investigations of the \nofficers. As noted above, all OPS files were produced as document nos. 5856-\n20043. In addition, the OPS file for the Atlanta Eagle investigation was produced \nas  document  nos.  4608-5255.  When  these  files  originally  were  produced,  they \nincluded  both  open  and  closed  investigations.  As  such,  while  the  closed \ninvestigations would have been complete files, the open investigations, including \nthe  Atlanta  Eagle  file,  may  not  have  been  complete  at  the  time.  In  an  open \ninvestigation, other documents and electronic media may have been created after \nthe date of the original production. At the site visit to OPS on September 1, it was \ndetermined that some of the open files had additional information that had not been \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 24 of 42\nsupplemented. Since that time those files have been updated in a  supplemental \nproduction as document nos. 31500-33605, 36499 and 36500. \n5.  Second Request for Production No. 7 \nThis request was for recordings of telephone communications among APD \nofficers  during  the  raid.  Counsel  is  correct  that  this  information  could  not  be \nproduced because the custodian of the recordings within APD had deleted the data. \nThe retention system that was used for audio recording retained the audio version \nof the calls for a period of 180 days. As such, calls related to the September 10, \n2009 operation at the Atlanta Eagle would have dropped from the system on or \naround March 10, 2010. While it is factually accurate that the data was lost after \nthe  litigation  hold  memorandum  was  issued  to  preserve  electronic  data,  the \nresponsive data was no longer in existence as of April 5, 2010, the date of service \nof the second production request and the Courtโs August 20th directive. However, \nthe City was able to capture the record of all communications during the time \nframe  surrounding  the  Atlanta  Eagle  operation  in  a  digital  printout  that  was \nproduced to counsel on the same day that was provided the telephone dumps, email \ndumps and back-up tapes.  \n6.  Second Request for Production No. 21 \nThis request was for photographs or text messages created during the Atlanta \nEagle operation. Following the Courtโs August 20th directive, counsel met and \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 25 of 42\nconferred  about  the  logistics  of  producing  the  cell  phones  of  the  officers  for \nforensic  inspection by  Plaintiffsโ  expert. Defense  counsel  was  advised  that the \nexpert was located in Minnesota and the telephones would need to be out of the \nofficersโ possession for a minimum of four (4) days to facilitate delivery analysis \nand return delivery. Because many of the officers rely solely on their personal cell \nphones for communication with superiors and with friends and family, it would \nhave been burdensome to comply with the production as it was set by Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel. During the August 27th conference with the Court, the Court agreed and \ndirected that telephones not be kept from the officers for more than twenty-four \nhours. At no time have the Defendants refused to comply with this directive. In an \neffort to assist Plaintiffsโ counsel with this process, the City organized and carried \nout a telephone dump of the officersโ cell phones that transferred to a readable disc \nall information then existing on the phones. Counsel was provided this information \nand was asked to review the information as a first step to determine which of the \nphones he specifically wanted for further forensic analysis based on what the initial \ndata suggested. There has been no follow-up request from counsel other than what \nis contained in the motion. Defendants continue to be ready and willing to provide \nthe telephones for forensic analysis as directed in the August 27th conference. \n   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 26 of 42\n \n7.  Second Request for Production Nos. 23 and 24 \nThese requests were for boots and clothing worn by undercover officers \nduring the operation. The intent of the request as represented by Plaintiffsโ counsel \nwas for the Plaintiffsโ to identify the officers who were inside the club during the \noperation because their identities were unknown to Plaintiffs.  In a supplemental \nresponse to discovery, the City has identified every participant in the operation, \nincluding the specific location of each officer within the club and each officerโs \narea  of  responsibility  during  the  operation.  Some  of  the  officers  named  as \ndefendants had zero involvement with the operation for a number of reasons. In \naddition, photographs of clothing for John Brock (20953-20957). The boots worn \nby the uniformed officers involved in the operation are standard and pictures of the \nboots worn by James Menzoilan  have been produced as document nos. (36490-\n36498).  \n8.  Second Request for Production No. 28 \nThis request was for files maintained regarding the Plaintiffs. There was \nconfusion regarding the Index to which Major Williams testified and counsel had \ndifficulty determining where this index was maintained and by whom. The index \nwas located within the Cityโs Department of Information Technology (โDITโ) and \nproduced as document nos. 40679-40952. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 27 of 42\n9.  Second Request for Production Nos. 30 and 31 \nThese requests were for training materials for APD officers generally and \nspecifically for the Red Dog Unit. All documents identified by counsel during site \nvisits have been produced. Other responsive documents that have been produced \nare identified as document nos. 20957 (APD Policy Manual CD);  21251-21555 \n(Law Enforcement Standards); 26085-26392 (Warrants and Tactical Information); \n26398-30398  APD  Tactical  Plans);  33885-36400  (Training  Academy  Files); \n41112-41133 (Confidential SOPs). \n10.  Second Request for Production Nos. 35-37 \nThese requests were for similar facts operations conducted by the Red Dog \nunits.  The  specific  objection  to  what  has  been  produced  relates  to  warrant \nexecution by the narcotics Unit at residential addresses and ID checks (presumably \nfor  underage  drinking)  at  businesses  selling  alcohol.  Neither  narcotics  nor \nunderage drinking was involved in the Atlanta Eagle operation. The operation was \ndirected toward sexual intercourse and other lewd activities occurring in a business \nestablishment  in  violation  of  State  law  and  City  ordinances.  Defendants  have \nproduced what it believes to be responsive to the original request that now is being \nre-defined by the instant motion. \n   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 28 of 42\n11.  First Individual Request for Production Nos. 1 and 2 \nThese  requests  seek  communications  between  the  officers  regarding  the \nAtlanta Eagle operation. As noted above, Plaintiffs have been provided with cell \nphone dumps from the officersโ phones; the defendants have agreed to further \nforensic  examination  of  the  phones;  the  emails  of  the  defendants  have  been \nproduced  from  the  Cityโs  servers;  and,  the  Plaintiffs  have  identified  every \ncomputer hard drive they want to conduct forensic analysis on but have not yet \ndone  so.  In  addition,  when  plaintiffs  expressed  their  disbelief  of  the  officers \nresponses, defense counsel offered the officers for deposition for determination \nunder oath of the existence of responsive information that would have included a \nprocess wherein the officers logged on to social media pages during the deposition \nfor  Plaintiffsโ  review.  Plaintiffs  originally  agreed  to  this  process  but  have  not \nfollowed through. \n12.  Individual Request for Production No. 3 \nThis  request  seeks  photos  of  the  officers.  Aside  from  the  fact  that  this \nrequest is inconsistent with the Plaintiffsโ representation that they can only identify \nthe officers by their clothing, photographs of many [all] of the defendants have \nbeen provided  in one  form  or  another  as document nos. 20044-20079,  20852-\n20853, 25924-25974, 26393-26397, 36415-36489. \n   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 29 of 42\n13.  Individual Request for Production Nos. 4 and 5 \nThese are the same requests for clothing and boots addressed previously.  \n14.  Second Individual Request for Production No. 1 \nThis  request  seeks  access  to  the  officersโ  online  accounts.  As  indicated, \ncounsel advised that responses were not required and none was provided based on \nthis representation. At the time of service of this request, the parties already had \nagreed that the officers would be deposed and would log on during the depositions \nto their online accounts. \n15.  First Continuing Interrogatories No. 1 \nThis request seeks the identity of the officers involved in the Atlanta Eagle \noperation. The City believes it adequately identified all officers involved in the \noperation as well as each officerโs involvement. If further clarification is required it \ncan be provided and could easily have been addressed during the depositions of the \nofficers to which the parties had agreed. As indicated, the officer whose name was \nnot included, Officer Bashir, was not technically a part of the operation and only \ndrove the transport vehicle, as counsel obviously is aware, based upon his own \nrepresentations. Omission of Officer Bashirโs name was not an attempt to be less \nthan fully responsive and her limited participation has been known to counsel for \nPlaintiffs. If it now is necessary to supplement the response further that is easily \nremedied.   \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 30 of 42\n16. First Continuing Interrogatories No. 2 \nThis request is for the identity of electronic devices used in connection with \nthe  operation.  The  City  has  provided  the  cell  phone  dumps  that  include  the \nidentifying information for those devices, which included the PDAs of command \nstaff from the involved units. In concert with Plaintiffsโ counsel during the site \nvisits, the computers logically utilized in the offices of the APD units involved in \nthe operation were identified and await Plaintiffsโ expertโs analysis.  \n17. First Continuing Interrogatories No. 7 \nThis request seeks the identity of other operations by APD in which more \nthan ten civilians were detained at a place of public accommodation. The Cityโs \nresponse was believed to be responsive when made (See document nos. 20958-\n21049). The essence of the request, because no record is maintained by the number \nof civilians involved, is that every warrant and every Narcotic and Vice operation \nwould have to be included. Moreover, while plaintiffs use the term โraidโ that term \nis not defined and is not a term utilized routinely by APD. However, during the site \nvisits with counsel, every document considered by him to have been responsive \nwas identified copied and produced. The operations that he identifies on page 11 of \nExhibit A were not specifically requested until the filing of the motion to compel. \nDocuments  related  to  those  operations,  to  the  extent  that  they  exist,  will  be \nproduced. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 31 of 42\n18. First Continuing Interrogatories No. 8 \nThis request seeks documents related to โraidsโ by the Red Dog Unit. Again, \nthe  documents  identified  by  counsel  during  the  site  visits  were  copied  and \nproduced. \n19. First Continuing Interrogatories No. 10 \nThis request seeks information about complaints related to the Atlanta Eagle. \nAny such complaints would have been included as part of the OPS file regarding \nthe investigation of the operation (See document nos. 36401-36405). \n20. First Individual Continuing Interrogatories Nos. 9 and 10 \nThese Requests seek information about complaints or disciplinary sanctions \nrelative to each of the officers. The City has produced, as indicated above, OPS \nfiles, personnel files and background investigation files that would include the \nrequested information. \nD. THE  MOTION  FOR  SANCTIONS  IS  PREMATURE  AND \nNOT WARRANTED. \n \nCourts have broad discretion to impose sanctions. This power derives from \nthe court's inherent power to manage its own affairs and to achieve the orderly and \nexpeditious disposition of cases. Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp.  427 F.3d 939, \n944 (2005); See also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43, 111 S.Ct. 2123, \n2132 (1991). Accordingly, sanctions for discovery abuses are intended to prevent \nunfair prejudice to litigants and to insure the integrity of the discovery process. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 32 of 42\nFlury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp.,  427 F.3d 939, 944 (11th Cir. 2005); see also \nGratton v. Great American Communications, 178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). \n   โA  judge's  decision  as  to  whether  a  party  or  lawyer's  actions  merit \nimposition of sanctions is heavily dependent on the court's firsthand knowledge, \nexperience,  and  observation.  At  times  the  actions  of  the  individual  or  party \ninvolved may be judged over the course of time.โ Harris v. Chapman, 97 F.3d 499, \n506 (11th Cir. 1996). As the Court noted in its August 27, 2010 teleconference: \nI agree with Mr. Godfrey that this is not the day to say I want sanctions \nbecause you havenโt finished what youโve set out to  do, Mr. Grossman. \nWhat I want you to do is to finish doing what you set out to do and what I \nauthorized and allowed you to do, and then after doing that if you are able to \nshow that you were put through a lot of unnecessary trouble and expense \nbecause of the Cityโs failure to comply with the Discovery Rules and/or the \norders of this court, then you can apply for sanctions at that time. (Courtโs \nAugust 27, 2010 order, pg. 9). \n \nThe Court further reiterated: \n   \nThatโs  how  weโre  going  to  resolve  this  and  I  expect  that  to  be  done \namicably. Now, if itโs not, Mr. Grossman, you can file whatever motion you \nthink  is  appropriate  if  after  all  of  your  work  is  done  in  this  discovery \nprocess, you just have a laundry list of things that the City failed to do. Iโm \njust saying thereโs no reason to file it now. (Courtโs August 27, 2010 order, \npg. 9). \n \nDiscovery  does  not  end  in  this  case  until  March  2011.  Defendants \nrespectfully request that the court consider their actions as of August 20, 2010, at \nwhich time Defendantsโ substituted counsel was in good faith cooperating with \nPlaintiffsโ counsel and attempting to cure all discovery defects which had occurred \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 33 of 42\nprior to their appearance on the case. Moreover, there is no evidence of spoliation \nand such allegation is also premature. Plaintiffs have gone to extreme lengths to \ncreate the inference that spoliation has occurred, without proof. \nโSpoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the \nfailure to preserve property for another's use as evidence in pending or reasonably \nforeseeable litigation.โ Graff v. Baja Marine Corp., 310 Fed.Appx. 298, 301, 2009 \nWL 226308, 2 (11th Cir.  2009) citing West v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 167 \nF.3d 776, 779 (2d Cir.1999).  \nThe โobligation to preserve evidence arises when the party has notice that the \nevidence is relevant to litigation-most commonly when suit has already been filed, \nproviding the party responsible for the destruction with express notice, but also on \noccasion in other circumstances, as for example when a party should have known \nthat the evidence may be relevant to future litigation.โ Kronisch v. United States, \n150 F.3d 112, 126 (2d Cir.1998); accord Silvestri, 271 F.3d at 591. โNotice does \nnot have to be of actual litigation, but can concern โpotentialโ litigation. Otherwise, \nany person could shred documents to their heart's content before suit is brought \nwithout fear of sanction.โ Bayoil, S.A. v. Polembros Shipping Ltd., 196 F.R.D. 479, \n483 (S.D.Tex.2000)(citing ABC Home Health Serv., Inc. v. IBM Corp., 158 F.R.D. \n180, 182 (S.D.Ga.1994)). \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 34 of 42\nTo determine whether spoliation sanctions are warranted, a court must consider \nthe factors identified in Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 427 F.3d 939. Graff v. \nBaja  Marine  Corp.,  310  Fed.Appx.  298,  301,  2009  WL  226308,  2  (C.A.11 \n(Ga. (C.A.11 (Ga.),2009)Griffin v. GMAC Commercial Fin., L.L.C., No. 1:05-CV-\n199-WBH-GGB, 2007 WL 521907, at *3 (N.D.Ga. Feb. 15, 2007). \n In determining whether a spoliation sanction is warranted, this court must \nconsider the following factors: (1) whether plaintiff was prejudiced as a result of \nthe  destruction  of  evidence;  (2)  whether  the  prejudice  could  be  cured;  (3)  the \npractical importance of the evidence; (4) whether defendant acted in good or bad \nfaith;  and  (5)  the  potential  for  abuse  if  expert  testimony  about  the  evidence \nprovided by the spoliator were not excluded. Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 427 \nF.3d 939, 945 (11th Cir.2005). โWith regard to the fourth factor, [the] law does not \nrequire a showing of malice in order to find bad faith. The court should weigh the \ndegree of the spoliator's culpability against the prejudice to the opposing party.โ \nFlury, 427 F.3d at 946 (citations omitted; See also Griffin v. GMAC Commercial \nFinance, L.L.C., 2007 WL 521907, 3 (N.D.Ga.) (N.D.Ga.,2007) \nResolution of motions for sanctions โturns, in part, on when defendant knew, \nor should have known, that plaintiff was likely to bring a lawsuit against it for \nwhich the destroyed documents might be relevant.โ Moreover, the relevant time \nperiod for acquisition of this knowledge is circumscribed by defendant's document \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 35 of 42\nretention policy, Cf. United States v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., 314 F.3d 995, 1001 \n(9th Cir.2002)(holding that defendants did not engage in spoliation of evidence \nwhere  records  were  intentionally  destroyed  in  accordance  with  a  document \nretention policy and state regulations before litigation commenced). Moreover, an \nindividual โ[d]efendant cannot be held accountable for information it received after \nthe documents were destroyed.โ Griffin v. GMAC Commercial Finance, L.L.C., \n2007 WL 521907, 4 (N.D.Ga.) (N.D.Ga.,2007). \nIn  the  instant  motion,  Plaintiff  alleges  that  some  individual  Defendants \ndeliberately deleted mobile data from their phone. (Plaintiffsโ Motion to Compel, \npp.  9-14.)  Plaintiffsโ  allegations  are  unsubstantiated.  First,  examination  of  the \nexpertโs report proffered by Plaintiffsโ merely asserts that there may be missing \ninformation, not a deliberate deletion as asserted by Plaintiffs. Defendantsโ have \noffered Plaintiffs counsel the opportunity to conduct forensic analysis and take \nindividual  Defendantsโ  depositions  to  inquire  into  any  perceived  allegation \nregarding  substantive  and  evidentiary  issues  related  to  the  trial.  In  fact, \nDefendantsโ  counsel  coordinated  and  scheduled  dates  for  Plaintiffsโ  counsel to \nconduct the depositions; however, to date Plaintiffsโ counsel has not conducted the \ndepositions. Furthermore, Plaintiffsโ counsel alleges that the individual Defendants \nhave failed to produce all electronic devices without evidence of such. Again, the \nCourt stated: \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 36 of 42\nI do think the individual defendants have got to provide their own phones \nthat they hadโฆeither had with them on the night of the raid or that they have \nused  to  transmit  any  messages,  texts,  or  emails  or  any  other  type  of \nelectronic message touching upon the raid. And, of course, its going to be \nyour [Mr. Grossman] during your deposition to ask them under oath if they \nhave done that.(Courtโs August 20, 2010 Order, pg 22.) \n \nMoreover, Defendants have produced all backup tapes and archived records \nin existence as of the August 20, 2010 conference call pursuant to the Courtโs \norder.  To  allege  that  evidence  was  deleted  and  request  sanctions  based  on \nspeculation and limited analysis, without an adequate determination on the merits \nincluding deposition and continuing discovery, is premature, unreasonable, and \nunjust. \n Secondly, Plaintiffsโ allege that their December 17, 2009 Preservation letter, \nshould  have  put  the  individual  officers  on  notice,  and  that  Defendants  are  in \nviolation of the Courtโs directive. However, the individuals alleged to have deleted \nphone communications within the instant motion, were not joined as parties until \nthe  Amended  Complaint  filed  on  March  17,  2010  and  were  not  served  with \ndiscovery until April 5, 2010. As such, each individual officer was not on notice \nthat  he/she  would  be  joined  in  an  individual  capacity  or  that  their  personal \ncellphones would be subjected to discovery requests.  Their continued use of their \ncell phones and routine deletion due to capacity for six months after September \n2009 operation are clearly excusable. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 37 of 42\nA party seeking an adverse inference instruction (or other sanctions) based \non the spoliation of evidence must establish the following three elements: (1) that \nthe party having control over the evidence had an obligation to preserve it at the \ntime it was destroyed; (2) that the records were destroyed with a โculpable state of \nmindโ and (3) that the destroyed evidence was โrelevantโ to the party's claim or \ndefense such that a reasonable trier of fact could find that it would support that \nclaim or defense. Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 229 F.R.D. 422, 430 (S.D.N.Y. \n2004).  \nIn order to establish bad faith, one must establish that the alleged acts were \nintentional or willful to demonstrate relevance. By contrast, when the destruction is \nnegligent, relevance must be proven by the party seeking the sanctions. Id. at 431.  \nThe court in Zubulake, specifically stated: \n \nIn the context of a request for an adverse inference instruction, the \nconcept of โrelevanceโ encompasses not only the ordinary meaning of \nthe  term,  but  also  that  the  destroyed  evidence  would  have  been \nfavorable  to  the  movant.  โThis  corroboration  requirement  is  even \nmore necessary where the destruction was merely negligent, since in \nthose cases it cannot be inferred from the conduct of the spoliator that \nthe evidence would even have been harmful to him.โ This is equally \ntrue in cases of gross negligence or recklessness; only in the case of \nwillful  spoliation  does  the  degree  of  culpability  give  rise  to  a \npresumption of the relevance of the documents destroyed.โ (internal \ncitation omitted). \n \n Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC , 229 F.R.D. 422, 431 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 38 of 42\nAlthough Plaintiffs have cited the Zubulake decision extensively throughout \ntheir  brief,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  meet  the  legal  requirements  for  imposing \nsanctions under the decision.  Defendantsโ counsel issued a litigation hold memo in \nDecember 2009 which the Court found to be appropriate and necessary under the \nlaw  as  memorialized  in  the  transcribed  minutes  from  the  August  20,  2010 \ntelephone  conference.    Any  allegations  of  deletion  of  data  can  be  addressed \ndirectly with each Defendant during deposition cross-examination.  This will allow \nthem an opportunity to explain any discrepancies under oath.  \nE. COSTS FOR FORENSIC EXAMINATION AND \nCOLLECTION OF DATA \n \nPlaintiffs are asking the Court to compel the Defendants to bear the cost of \nattempting to retrieve data that has not been determined to exist. This request is \npremature. The federal courts are often confronted with a party's complaint that its \nopponent  must  have  documents  that  it  claims  not  to  have.  Such  suspicion  is, \nhowever, insufficient to warrant granting a motion to compel. Alexander v. FBI, \n194  F.R.D.  305,  311  (D.D.C.2000).  See  Bethea  v.  Comcast,  218  F.R.D.  328 \n(D.D.C. 2003) (applying principle to demand to search opponent's hard drive).  In \nthe context of computer systems and computer records, inspection or seizure is not \npermitted unless the moving party can โdemonstrate that the documents they seek \nto compel do, in fact, exist and are being unlawfully withheld.โ Id. As indicated by \nthis court and other courts, a party's suspicion that another party has failed to \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 39 of 42\nrespond to document requests fully and completely does not justify compelled \ninspection of its computer systems. See id.; see also Medical Billing Consultants, \nInc. v. Intelligent Medical Objects, Inc., No. 01 C 9148, 2003 WL 1809465, at *2 \n(N.D.Ill. Apr.4, 2003).   \n  Per  discussions  with  Plaintiffsโ  counsel  regarding  the  electronic  data, \nDefendants have previously agreed to allow Plaintiffsโ expert to clone the hard \ndrive for every key employeeโs terminal identified by Plaintiffsโ counsel, and to \nexamine and extract related data.  Plaintiffs have never attempted to arrange this \ninspection.  The offered inspection would be the Plaintiffsโ opportunity to establish \nif any discoverable data exists to be restored and the potential costs involved.   \nIn the alternative, Defendants will agree to share the cost of a neutral third-\nparty to assess the probability of success and the associative costs of electronic \nrestoration.  Any cost-shifting order for forensic examination and collection prior \nto this step would be unjustified and premature.    \nF. PLAINTIFFS HAVE NOT MET THE LEGAL STANDARD \nTO SUPPORT A RULING OF CIVIL CONTEMPT. \n \nDefendants have not intentionally violated an order of nor been disrespectful \nof this Court.  Defendants have made and continue to make every effort to comply \nwith the Courtโs orders.  Thousands of pages of documents have been produced \npursuant to the Courtโs order.  Since the Courtโs order, Plaintiffsโ counsel has \nreceived volumes of responsive documents as well as responsive electronic data.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 40 of 42\nPlaintiffsโ counsel has failed to communicate to Defendants any dissatisfaction \nwith these responses.  The first notice Defendants received regarding Plaintiffsโ \nconcerns  with  the  latest  produced  information  was  via  the  instant  motion  to \ncompel.   \n โThe  party  alleging  civil  contempt  must  demonstrate  that  the  alleged \ncontemnor  violated  the  court's  order  by  โclear  and  convincing  evidence,โ  not \nmerely a preponderance of the evidence.โ United States v. Ayres, 166 F.3d 991, \n994 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 880 (1999) (quoting In re Dual-Deck Video \nCassette Recorder Antitrust Litig., 10 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir.1993)). This clear and \nconvincing evidence must show the alleged contemnor โviolated a definite and \nspecific order of the court requiring him to perform or refrain from performing a \nparticular act or acts with knowledge of the court's order.โ Local Union 58, 340 \nF.3d at 379 (quoting Cincinnati Bronze, 829 F.2d at 591)). โClear and convincing \nevidence is not a light burden and should not be confused with the less stringent, \nproof  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.โ  Id.  Defendants  are  making  every \nattempt to provide Plaintiffs with the requested information.  There is no clear and \nconvincing evidence that the Defendants have  violated a specific order of this \nCourt; therefore, a finding of civil contempt is unwarranted. \n   \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 251    Filed 10/22/10   Page 41 of 42\nV.  CONCLUSION \nTherefore, based on the foregoing, the Defendants respectfully submit that \nthis Court should deny Plaintiffโs Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions. \nDefendants further submit that they would be receptive to the appointment of a \nCourt Appointed Monitor for the remaining discovery matters should the Court \ndecide that additional oversight of the discovery process is warranted.  \nCertification \nCounsel for Defendants certifies that this brief has been prepared with Times \nNew Roman font, 14 point, and therefore it complies with the requirements of L.R. \n5.1(C). \n  Respectfully submitted this 22nd day of October, 2010.         \n              s/Jerry L.

TRAINING \nA.  Training \n1. The City of Atlanta (โthe Cityโ) shall conduct Calhoun โApproved\nTrainingโ (as defined in Part B below) for all sworn employees within 90 days of \nthe entry of this Order, and then every even-numbered year thereafter (โTraining \nYearโ) by no later than the last day of August, through and including August, \n2024.    \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 2 of 32\nB.  Continuation of Reform  \n1. The requirements of Paragraph A1 shall not apply to sworn officers\nwho work no hours in the month during which training is conducted, or who \nexperience extenuating circumstances making them unavailable to timely complete \nthe training, for example depart for military duty or become hospitalized.  The City \nwill require such officers to complete the Calhoun training within 30 days of their \nreturn to active Atlanta Police Department (โAPDโ) duty.   \n2. The Calhoun Approved Training may be presented on-line rather than\nin-person, and shall instruct about current Fourth Amendment law regarding \ndetentions, arrests, frisks and searches generally, the topics set forth in Exhibit A \nhereto (โConstitutional Principlesโ), and the topics set forth in Exhibit B hereto \n(โCalhoun SOP Topicsโ).  \n3. Plaintiffs approve the training video (contained on a thumb drive that\nis Exhibit C to this Order, the โApproved Trainingโ) with the exception of the \nAssessment Questions. Plaintiffs do not approve the Assessment Questions, but for \npurposes of compromise Plaintiffs stipulate that: 1) they will not argue that the \nAssessment Questions in the Approved Training violate subsection (A)(1) of Part I \n(Training) of this Order; and 2) the Approved Training may be used for full \nsatisfaction of the training and recurrent training requirements of subsection (A)(1) \nof Part I (Training) of this Order.  The Parties further agree that:  \n(a)   the โfast forwardโ function of the Approved Training video will \nbe disabled, so that trainees are unable to fast forward through \nany portion of the training that they have not yet viewed; and \n (b)   for each embedded segment of Assessment Questions in the \nApproved Training, the segmentโs order of questions and the \nquestionsโ order of answer choices will be randomized. \nThe City shall not change any material element of the structure, format, or content \nof the Approved Training or the Assessment Questions unless such changes are \npresented to and approved by Plaintiffsโ counsel in writing prior to \nimplementation; Plaintiffsโ approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed \nor conditioned. \n2 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 3 of 32\n4. In addition to the training implemented pursuant to this Part I, the City\nmay implement the Approved Training at any other time in its sole discretion, \nwithout prior consent of Plaintiffs.   \nC.  Monitoring Facilitation  \n1. Within two weeks (14 calendar days) of the Cityโs completion of the\nApproved Training in 2018 or 2019, and by September 15 of a subsequent \nTraining Year, the City shall provide Plaintiffs with a roster of all sworn \nemployees of the Department as of the final day of August (except that for 2018 or \n2019, the roster shall be for the month in which the Approved Training was \nconducted), which shall contain the date that each of those sworn employees \ncompleted the Approved Training, or as applicable pursuant to paragraph B1, \nabove, the reason why timely completion did not occur.  In addition, the City shall \nprovide a composite analysis for each test question showing the number of officers \nwho initially answered each question correctly, the number who initially answered \neach question incorrectly, and the average number of attempts needed for officers \nto correctly respond to each question.  \n2. For each such sworn officer unable to timely complete the Calhoun\ntraining for reasons described in paragraph A1, above, the City will inform \nPlaintiffs within 15 days of the sworn officerโs completing the Calhoun training, \nindicating the date that the officer returned to active-duty and the date that the \ntraining was completed.   \nII. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPS)\nA.  APD Standard Operating Procedures \n1. The City shall not maintain, adopt, or revise any APD Standard\nOperating Procedure (โSOPโ) inconsistent with the any of the Constitutional \nPrinciples set forth in Exhibit A hereto. \n2. The City shall not maintain, adopt, or revise any SOP inconsistent\nwith any provision of this Order, any of the Calhoun SOP Topics set forth in \nExhibit B hereto, or any of the โCalhoun SOPsโ (as defined below), except as set \nforth in paragraph B3, below.   \n3 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 4 of 32\nB.  Continuation of Reform \n1. As used herein, โCalhoun SOPโ shall mean the SOPs listed on the\nattached Exhibit D and any SOP added to this list pursuant to the process described \nin this Part II(B). \n2. Except as set forth in this Part II(B), the City shall retain without\nchange the Calhoun SOPs. \n3. The City may modify the Calhoun SOPs to the extent that a change is\nmade to the applicable legal principle through statutory change or legal \ninterpretation by the United States Supreme Court, United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Eleventh Circuit, the Supreme Court of Georgia or the Georgia Court of \nAppeals.   \n4. If the City modifies any Calhoun SOP for any reason, within five\nbusiness days (i.e., weekdays except federal holidays) the City shall \ninform Plaintiffsโ counsel and provide a copy of the modified SOP to Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel.  This requirement shall be referred to as the โFive Day Reporting \nRequirement.โ  \n5. If Plaintiffs reasonably believe that language in any SOP not listed on\nExhibit D substantively implicates or is inconsistent with any provision of this \nOrder, any of the Constitutional Principles set forth in Exhibit A, or any of the \nCalhoun SOP Topics set forth in Exhibit B, or any of the Calhoun SOPs, Plaintiffs \nmay request in writing that the City add such an SOP to the list of Calhoun SOPs, \nwhich SOPs are subject to the Five Day Reporting Requirement.  If the City \nobjects to adding an SOP to the list of Calhoun SOPs, the parties shall meet and \nconfer.  If a dispute remains, the City will have 15 business days in which to add \nthe SOP to the list of Calhoun SOPS or present the issue to the Court for \nresolution.  If the City does not timely object, the SOP shall be added to the list of \nCalhoun SOPs.  \nC.  Monitoring Facilitation \n1. By no later than midnight on the 28th day of February, until and\nincluding February 28, 2024, the City must provide Plaintiffs with a copy of every \nSOP in effect on December 31 of the immediately preceding year, except that the \nrequirements of this Paragraph C(1) shall not apply to Confidential SOPs,.  The \n4 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 5 of 32\nSOPs shall be provided in both Microsoft Word and PDF (Adobe Acrobat) \nformats.  These files shall be named as follows: [SOP number] [SOP Title] \n[Year.Month.Day of Last Revision]     \n2. Beginning April 15, 2019, by no later than midnight on the fifteenth\ndays of the months of January, April, July, and October, until October 15, 2024 \n(hereafter the โReporting Datesโ), the City must provide Plaintiffsโ counsel with \nthe following information for the immediately preceding quarter, except that the \nrequirements of this Paragraph C(2) shall not apply to Confidential SOPs: \n(a)  A copy of every SOP that is subject to the Five Day Reporting \nRequirement, which is in effect on the final day of the \nimmediately preceding quarter.  For example, on October 15, \n2020 (the Reporting Date), the City must provide copies of all \nSOPs subject to the Five Day Reporting Requirement in effect \non September 30, 2020.  The SOPs shall be provided in both \nMicrosoft Word and Adobe Acrobat formats.  The titles of \nthese SOPs shall contain: [SOP number] [SOP Name] \n[Year.Month.Day of Last Revision].โ    \n(b)  As a separate document, a revision list indicating, in separately \nheaded sections: (i) every SOP first implemented during the \nimmediately preceding quarter;  (ii) every SOP revoked during \nthe immediately preceding quarter; and (iii) every SOP other \nthan those already identified in (i) or (ii) to which any change \nwhatsoever has been made during the immediately preceding \nquarter.  The SOPs identified on these lists shall be denoted as \nfollows: โ[SOP Number] [SOP Name] [Year.Month.Day of \nLast Revision].โ    For any category in which there are no \napplicable SOPs for the immediately preceding quarter, this \nshall be indicated affirmatively by the word โNone.โ  This \ndocument must always be provided, even if no SOPs were \nimplemented, revoked, or changed during the immediately \npreceding quarter. \n(c)  For every SOP identified in Section (b)(iii), a separate blackline \ndocument in Microsoft Word format reflecting every change \nmade to that SOP in the immediately preceding quarter. The \n5 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 6 of 32\nparties agree that this blackline document shall be created by \ncomparing the version of the SOP in effect on the immediately \npreceding Reporting Date and the version of the SOP in effect \non the current Reporting Date using Microsoft Wordโs \nblackline function or the equivalent thereof that is mutually \napproved by the parties. \n3. No more than once per calendar year, the City shall be entitled to a\nfour-calendar-day extension of one Reporting Date, if the request for such \nextension is timely (i.e., communicated to Plaintiffsโ counsel prior to midnight on \nthe Reporting Date). \nD.

With regard to any\nwarrantless seizure (e.g. Terry stop), warrantless frisk, or warrantless search of a \nperson conducted by an Atlanta police officer inside any residence or commercial \nbuilding or structure, the City of Atlanta shall require the officer to fill out a \nwritten or electronic form before the end of his or her shift documenting the \nspecific crime(s) of which the individual was suspected; indicating the specific \nfacts giving rise to reasonable articulable suspicion regarding that crime; indicating \nwhether the individual was frisked for weapons, and if so giving the specific facts \ngiving rise to reasonable articulable suspicion that he was both armed AND \ndangerous; indicating whether the individual was searched for anything other than \nweapons, and if so giving the specific facts giving rise both to probable cause and \nexigent circumstances. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the \naction is in immediate response to a non-police-officer-initiated 9-1-1 call. These \n10 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 11 of 32\nreports shall be a public record, routinely available for public inspection by \nelectronic or other means, pursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. \n2.

The \nrequirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the action is in immediate \nresponse to a non-police-officer-initiated 9-1-1 call. These reports shall be a public \nrecord, routinely available for public inspection by electronic or other means, \npursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. \nB.  Continuation of Reforms \n1. The forms required in paragraph A1 and A2 above shall be public\nrecords, routinely available for public inspection by electronic or other means, \npursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act.  For the purpose of public inspection \nunder the Open Records Act, the Forms will be available after supervisor review \nand approval.  In the event that the content of any Form completed by an officer \nbefore the end of her or his shift (โEnd of Shift Formโ) prior to supervisor review \nis not identical to the publicly available form, the City will retain for production to \nPlaintiffsโ counsel, as set forth below, the End of Shift Form, an audit trail showing \nthe history of transactions associated with the End of Shift Form, and the \nsupervisor notes associated with the audit trail.  Plaintiffsโ counsel agree to keep \nconfidential such End of Shift Forms, audit trails and supervisor notes. \n2. Training and Promotion of Compliance\n(a)  Within thirty days of entry of this Order, the City shall cause\nthe Chief of Police to distribute a Memorandum to all sworn \nstaff describing the Stop and Think Forms and their proper use, \nexplaining the New Incident Report Form (discussed below), \nidentifying the relevant SOPs, giving examples of when Stop \nand Think Forms should be completed, and identifying \nparticular units in which the completion of Stop and Think \n11 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 12 of 32\nForms may be required more often.

Monitoring Facilitation\n(a)  On the 15th day of each month, beginning the latter of 30 days\nafter entry of this Order or January 15, 2019, the City shall \nprovide Plaintiffsโ counsel with the following information for \nthe immediately preceding month: (i) each Stop and Think \nForm (in the form of an individual PDF document for each Stop \nand Think Form) and the corresponding incident report (in the \nform of an individual PDF document for each incident report); \n(ii) each End of Shift Form that differs from the corresponding \npublicly available Stop and Think Form (in the form of an \nindividual PDF document for each such End of Shift Form) and \nthe corresponding audit trail and supervisor notes (in the form \nof an individual PDF document for each End of Shift Form, or \nother format acceptable to Plaintiffs); (iii) all criminal trespass \nwarnings recorded electronically (in the form of an Excel \nspreadsheet with a row for each criminal trespass warning and a \ncolumn for each field in the criminal trespass warning \ntemplate); (iv) copies of all criminal trespass warnings that \nwere created in paper form (in the form of an individual PDF \n12 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 13 of 32\ndocument for each paper criminal trespass warning); and (v) all \nField Interview Forms, as currently contained in the Field \nContact Module referenced in SOP 3065 ยง 4.4.1, or any \nfunctional equivalent (in the form of an Excel spreadsheet with \na row for each Field Interview Form and a column for each \nfield in the Field Interview Form template). Plaintiffs will not \nassert any violation or contempt with regard to any missing or \nimproperly-completed Stop and Think Form completed before \nMarch 1, 2019. The parties understand that the Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel will also request in discovery GCIC/ACIC/NCIC \nrecords from time to time, and data from individual APD \nincident reports (in the form of an Excel spreadsheet with a row \nfor each incident report and a column for each field in the \nincident report template).   \n(b)  For a six-month period beginning on or about April 15, 2019, \nthe parties will have monthly meetings to address whether the \nprocedures set forth above are sufficient or necessary to \npromote reasonable compliance by APD police officers with the \nStop and Think Form requirement.   Such meetings may \ncontinue thereafter on an as needed basis. \nC.  Sunset \n1. The provisions in Part IV shall expire six years following the entry of\nthis Order.  \nV.  IDENTIFICATION \nA.  Identification Requirement for APD Officers  \n1. The City of Atlanta shall require all Atlanta police officers who are in\nuniform, other than a rain slicker or traffic direction vest, to wear a conspicuously \nvisible nametag, and to require any Atlanta police officer who is in uniform or has \ndisplayed a badge or other indicia of police authority (such as a police vest, etc.), \nto identify himself by name and badge number upon request at some point before \nthe end of an encounter with a civilian.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 14 of 32\nB.  Continuation of Reform \n1. APDโs Standard Operating Procedure SOP.2130 pertaining to Dress\nCode (or any future functional equivalent) shall include a section requiring that any \nAtlanta police officer who is in uniform must, at all times, wear a conspicuously \nvisible nametag, and emphasizing that the only exception to this requirement is a \nrain slicker or traffic direction vest. No APD SOP shall supersede or contradict this \nsection of SOP.2130.   \n2. APDโs Standard Operating Procedure SOP.2010 pertaining to Work\nRules (or any future functional equivalent) shall include a section requiring any \nAtlanta police officer who is in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia \nof police authority (such as a police vest, etc.), to identify himself by name and \nbadge number upon request at some point before the end of an encounter with a \ncivilian.    \n3. APD recruits shall be trained on the name tag and identification\nrequirements.   \n4. All APD supervisors who identify a police officer in uniform, whether\non duty or off duty, without a conspicuously visible nametag, shall initiate an OPS \ninvestigation, discipline, or issue a written reprimand where deemed appropriate. \nC.  Monitoring Facilitation \nThe City shall make available for review by Plaintiffsโ counsel, by the 15th day of \neach month (beginning no less than 30 days after the entry of this Order), all \nvideos and photographs (including BWC, handheld, dashcam) of operations by \nofficers in โtacticalโ and โSWAT-typeโ gear or uniforms conducted the \nimmediately preceding calendar month, except for such videos and photographs \nthat are exempt from public disclosure under the Georgia Open Records Act \n(OCGA ยง50-18-72) or other applicable Federal or State law, which videos and \nphotographs shall be made available when they are no longer exempt.  Plaintiffsโ \ncounsel agree to keep confidential information received pursuant to this Paragraph \nC.  The City understands that Plaintiffsโ counsel may also be requesting videos in \ndiscovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n14 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 15 of 32\nD.  Sunset \n1. The provisions in Part V(B) โContinuation of Reformโ and Part V(C)\nโMonitoring Facilitationโ shall expire six years following the entry of this Order.   \nVI. NO INTERFERENCE WITH AUDIO OR VIDEO RECORDINGS\nThe City of Atlanta shall prohibit Atlanta police officers from interfering in any \nway with a citizen's right to make video, audio, or photographic recordings of \npolice activity, as long as such recording does not physically interfere with the \nperformance of an officer's duty.  \nVII. DISCOVERY\n1. Plaintiffs are granted the right to conduct post-judgment discovery to\nmonitor compliance with this Order pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia, and all Standing Orders of this Court. \n2. The Parties agree that the Cityโs compliance with the document\nproduction requirements set forth in this Order should facilitate Plaintiffsโ ability to \nmonitor the Cityโs compliance with the Order and accordingly reduce Plaintiffsโ \ndiscovery requirements.   \n3. The City shall comply within 20 days with any request made by\nPlaintiffsโ counsel for discovery.  Any such request from Plaintiffsโ counsel shall \nbe accompanied by an explanation of the reason for additional information or \ndocuments to monitor compliance with this Order.  Any records or documents that \nwould not be subject to disclosure under the Georgia Open Records Act shall be \nused by Plaintiffsโ counsel solely for the purpose of monitoring the Cityโs \ncompliance with this Order and shall not be disclosed to the public. \n4. In any instance in which the City objects to or seeks clarification of a\ndiscovery request, the City shall present such objections or requests for \nclarification in writing to Plaintiffsโ counsel within 5 working days of receipt of the \nrequest, including the specific bases for each objection or the nature of any \nambiguity.  Within 5 working days thereafter the parties shall meet and confer and \nattempt to resolve the dispute.  Plaintiffsโ counsel will waive attorneysโ fees for the \nfirst hour of such a meeting.  If a dispute remains, the City must, within 10 \n15 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 16 of 32\nworking days of the partiesโ meeting, do the following: (1) produce complete, \nresponsive records or (2) petition the Court for relief.   \n5. The provisions in this Part VII shall expire six years following the\nentry of this Order. \nVIII. IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING FACILITATION\nThe parties agree that enforcement of this Order is dependent upon the \ntimely, full and accurate production of the records and information required to be \nprovided under this Order, and the City acknowledges and understands that failure \nof the City to comply will be raised with this Court.    \nIX. ATTORNEY FEES\n1. The City shall pay Plaintiffsโ counsel their reasonable attorney fees\nand reimburse any costs they reasonably expend in ensuring compliance with the \nOrders of this Court.  The City shall pay these sums directly to Plaintiffsโ counsel \nupon receipt (i.e., within thirty calendar days) of each itemized accounting of \nreasonable time and expenses. \n2. If the City believes any element of such itemized accounting to be\nunreasonable, the City shall present such objections, including the specific bases \nfor each objection, in writing to Plaintiffsโ counsel within 5 calendar days of \nreceipt of such accounting.  Within 5 calendar days thereafter, the parties shall \nmeet and confer and attempt to resolve the dispute.  If a dispute remains, the City \nmust, within 10 business days of the date it raised its objections, do one of the \nfollowing: (1) pay Plaintiffsโ counselโs accounting as presented; or (2) petition the \nCourt, in a writing served on Plaintiffsโ counsel, for relief.     \n3. The parties recognize that the Plaintiffsโ counsel are entitled to\ncompensation for their reasonably expended monitoring hours under 42 U.S.C. ยง \n1988.  The City also acknowledges that certain aspects of the monitoring regime \nand mechanisms may require Plaintiffsโ counsel to expend significant and \ncompensable time.   \n4. The provisions in this Part IX (โAttorney Feesโ) shall expire six years\nfollowing the entry of this Order. \n16 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 17 of 32\nX.  STATEMENT \nThis Consent Order represents the desire and agreement of the parties to \nfocus on ensuring compliance by the City in the future, rather than litigating \nPlaintiffsโ allegations of the Cityโs non-compliance.  The parties view this Consent \nOrder as their good-faith effort to both advance compliance with Orders of this \nCourt and as an important tool advancing APDโs work to ensure both public safety \nand respect for citizensโ constitutional rights. \nXI. THIS ORDER SUPERCEDES PREVIOUS ORDERS\nThis Order shall supersede this Courtโs Orders of December 8, 2010, \nDecember 15, 2011, May 19, 2015 and all orders subsequent to May 19, 2015.  \nNothing in this Order shall preclude any party from filing a motion to modify any \npart of this Order. \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 29th day of November, 2018.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 18 of 32\n(cid:40)(cid:59)(cid:43)(cid:44)(cid:37)(cid:44)(cid:55)(cid:3)(cid:36)(cid:3)\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 19 of 32\nEXHIBIT A \nConstitutional Principles \n \na)  Police officers may not lawfully detain any individual without reasonable \narticulable suspicion, particularized to the person being detained (i.e., a \n\"particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person\") that \nthe individual is involved in specific and identifiable criminal activity. \n \nA police officer may conduct a brief, investigatory stop of a person when the \nofficer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that that person is involved in \ncriminal activity (A \"Terry stop\"). While \"reasonable suspicion\" is a less \ndemanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing \nconsiderably less than preponderance of the evidence, the Fourth \nAmendment requires at least a minimal level of objective justification for \nmaking the Terry stop. The officer must be able to articulate more than an \n\"inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or 'hunch' \" of criminal activity by \nthe person. Illinois v. Warlaw, 528 U.S. 119, 122 (2000) (citations omitted). \nThe officer must have a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that \nthe individual is involved in criminal activity. Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, \n51 (1979). Also, the officer's action must be \" 'justified at its inception, and . \n. . reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the \ninterference in the first place.'\" United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 682 \n(1985) (quoting Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968)). \n \nb) Police officers may not lawfully take or demand identification, or require an \nindividual to identify himself, without reasonable suspicion, based on \nobjective criteria, that the individual is engaged or had engaged in criminal \nconduct. \n \nWhen a police officer is conducting a Terry stop on the basis of reasonable \narticulable suspicion that a person is engaged or has engaged in criminal \nactivity, the officer may demand that a person identify himself or display \nidentification. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 177 (2004); \nBrown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979). In the absence of a lawful Terry stop, a \npolice officer may not lawfully take identification or demand an individual \nto identify himself. \n \nExhibit A \nPage 1 of 3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 20 of 32\nc)  Police officers may not lawfully frisk an individual for weapons without a \nreasonable belief, directed at the particular person to be frisked, that the \nperson is both armed and presently dangerous. \n \nDuring a lawful Terry stop, a police officer for his own protection and safety \nmay conduct a patdown of a person to find weapons that he reasonably \nbelieves or suspects are then in the possession of the person he has stopped. \nPolice may not conduct a generalized \"cursory search for weapons\" or any \nsearch whatever for anything but weapons. The \"narrow scope\" of the Terry \nexception does not permit a frisk for weapons on less than reasonable belief \nor suspicion directed at the person to be frisked, even though that person \nhappens to be on premises where an authorized narcotics search is taking \nplace. Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93 (1979). \n \nd) A warrantless arrest is constitutionally valid only when there is probable \ncause to arrest. United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 417 (1976). Probable \ncause exists if, \"at the moment the arrest was made, 'the facts and \ncircumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had \nreasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man \nin believing' that [the suspect] had committed or was committing an \noffense.\" United States v. Floyd, 281 F.3d 1346, 1348 (11th Cir. 2002); \nUnited States v. Gonzalez, 969 F.2d 999, 1002 (11th  Cir. 1992). \"Probable \ncause does not require the same type of specific evidence of each element of \nthe offense as would be needed to support a conviction.\" Adams v. Williams, \n407 U.S. 143, 149 (1972). \"[P]robable cause is a reasonable ground for \nbelief of guilt, and that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect \nto the person to be searched or seized.\" Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, \n371 (2003). \n \ne)  An arrest requiring probable cause is defined using an objective standard: \nwhether the suspect is '''subjected to restraints comparable to those \nassociated with a formal arrest. '\" United States v. Acosta, 363 F.3d 1141, \n1149 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 441 \n(1984)). \n \nf)  In the absence of a lawful arrest, voluntary consent, or the exception \ncommonly known as \"the plain feel exception,\" a police officer may not \nExhibit A \nPage 2 of 3 \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 434   Filed 11/29/18   Page 21 of 32\nlawfully search an individual for anything other than weapons without either \na search warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances.  \n \nAs to the \"plain feel exception,\" if in conducting a lawful Terry patdown for \nweapons a police officer in lawfully patting down a suspect's outer clothing \nfeels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately \napparent as contraband, it may be seized without a warrant. Minnesota v. \nDickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 37-376 (1993). \n \ng) Police officers may not lawfully arrest an individual in his or her home \nwithout either an arrest warrant or probable cause plus exigent \ncircumstances. Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980). \n \nh) A police officer may not enter a suspect's home without a search warrant or \nvoluntary consent unless probable cause and exigent circumstances exist, \nand any resulting search and seizure is prohibited under the Fourth \nAmendment. Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 586 (1980). Exigent \ncircumstances exist \"when the inevitable delay incident to obtaining a \nwarrant must give way to an urgent need for immediate action.\" United \nStates v. Satterfield, 743 F.2d 827, 844 (11th Cir. 1984). Situations in which \nexigent circumstances exist include: \"danger of flight or escape; danger of \n[physical] harm to police officers or the general public; risk of loss, \ndestruction, removal, or concealment of evidence; and 'hot pursuit' of a \nfleeing suspect.\" United States v. Blasco, 702 F.2d 1315, 1325 (11th Cir. \n1983). \"The mere presence of contraband, however, does not give rise to \nexigent circumstances.\" United States v.

Revocation or Amendment of Unconstitutional Policies \nThe City of Atlanta agrees permanently to revoke or amend all Atlanta \nPolice Department  SOPs,  Command Memoranda,  and any  other policies, \nincluding  but not  limited  to  SOP.3020  ยง 4.3.1(2)  (regarding  warrantless \nsearches),  SOP.3030  (regarding  arrests),  and  SOP.3065  (regarding \ninvestigatory detentions and frisks without reasonable articulable suspicion), \nwhich  contain  provisions  that  are  inconsistent  with  the  following \nconstitutional requirements: \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 2 of 11\na)  Police  officers  may  not  lawfully  detain  any  individual  without \nreasonable  articulable  suspicion,  particularized  to  the  person being \ndetained  (i.e., a \"particularized and objective basis for suspecting the \nparticular  person\")  that  the  individual  is  involved  in  specific  and \nidentifiable criminal activity. \nA police officer may conduct a brief, investigatory stop of a person \nwhen  the  officer  has  a  reasonable,  articulable  suspicion  that  that \nperson  is  involved  in  criminal  activity  (A  \"Terry  stop\").  While \n\"reasonable  suspicion\"  is  a  less  demanding  standard than probable \ncause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of \nthe evidence, the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimal level \nof objective justification for making the Terry stop.  The officer must \nbe  able  to  articulate  more  than  an  \"inchoate  and  unparticularized \nsuspicion or 'hunch' \" of criminal activity by the person.  Illinois v. \nWarlaw,  528 U.S.  119,  122 (2000) (citations omitted).  The officer \nmust have a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts,  that the \nindividual is involved in criminal activity.  Brown v.  Texas, 443 U.S. \n47,  51  (1979).  Also, the officer's action must be \"  'justified at its \ninception, and . . . reasonably related in  scope to the circumstances \nwhich justified the interference in the first place.'\"  United States v. \nSharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 682 (1985) (quoting Terry v.  Ohio, 392 U.S.  1, \n20 (1968)). \nb)  Police  officers  may  not  lawfully  take  or  demand  identification,  or \nrequire  an  individual  to  identify  himself,  without  reasonable \nsuspicion, based on objective criteria, that the individual is engaged or \nhad engaged in criminal conduct. \nWhen  a  police  officer  is  conducting  a  Terry  stop  on  the  basis  of \nreasonable  articulable  suspicion  that  a  person  is  engaged  or  has \nengaged in  criminal activity, the officer may demand that a person \nidentify himself or display identification.  Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. \nCourt do Nevada,  Humboldt County, 542 U.S.  177 (2004); Brown v. \nTexas,  443 U.S. 47 (1979).  In the absence ofa lawful Terry stop, a \npolice  officer  may  not  lawfully  take  identification  or  demand  an \nindividual to identify himself. \n2 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 3 of 11\nc) \t Police  officers  may  not  lawfully  frisk  an  individual  for  weapons \nwithout  a  reasonable  belief,  directed at the  particular person to  be \nfrisked, that the person is both armed and presently dangerous. \nDuring a lawful Terry stop, a police officer for his own protection and \nsafety may conduct a patdown of a person to  find weapons that he \nreasonably  believes  or  suspects  are  then  in  the  possession  of the \nperson he has stopped.  Police may not conduct a generalized \"cursory \nsearch  for  weapons\"  or  any  search  whatever  for  anything  but \nweapons.  The \"narrow scope\" of the Terry exception does not permit \na  frisk  for  weapons  on  less  than  reasonable  belief or  suspicion \ndirected at the person to be frisked, even though that person happens \nto  be  on  premises  where  an  authorized  narcotics  search  is  taking \nplace.  Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93 (1979). \nd)  A  warrantless  arrest  is  constitutionally  valid  only  when  there  is \nprobable cause to arrest.  United States v.  Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 417 \n(1976).  Probable cause exists if, \"at the moment the arrest was made, \n'the facts and circumstances within [the officers'] knowledge and of \nwhich they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to \nwarrant a prudent man in believing' that [the suspect] had committed \nor was  committing an offense.\"  United States  v.  Floyd,  281  F.3d \nth \n1346, 1348 (11  Cir. 2002); United States v.  Gonzalez, 969 F.2d 999, \n1002 (11  Cir. 1992).  \"Probable cause does not require the same type \nth \nof specific  evidence  of each  element  of the  offense  as  would  be \nneeded to support a conviction.\"  Adams v.  Williams, 407 U.S.  143, \n149 (1972).  \"[P]robable cause is  a reasonable ground for belief of \nguilt, and that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to \nthe person to be searched or seized.\"  Maryland v.  Pringle, 540 U.S. \n366,371 (2003). \ne) \t An  arrest  requiring  probable  cause  is  defined  using  an  objective \nstandard: whether the suspect is '''subjected to restraints comparable \nto those  associated with a formal  arrest. '\"  United States v.  Acosta, \n363 F.3d 1141, 1149 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Berkemer v.  McCarty, \n468 U.S. 420, 441 (1984)). \n3 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 4 of 11\nf) \t In the absence of a lawful arrest, voluntary consent, or the exception \ncommonly known as \"the plain feel exception,\" a police officer may \nnot  lawfully  search  an  individual  for  anything  other than  weapons \nwithout  either  a  search  warrant  or  probable  cause  plus  exigent \ncircumstances. \nAs  to  the  \"plain  feel  exception,\"  if in  conducting  a  lawful  Terry \npatdown  for  weapons  a  police  officer  in  lawfully  patting  down  a \nsuspect's outer clothing feels an object whose contour or mass makes \nits  identity  immediately  apparent  as  contraband,  it  may  be  seized \nwithout  a  warrant.  Minnesota  v.  Dickerson,  508  U.S.  366,  37-376 \n(1993). \ng)  Police  officers  may  not  lawfully  arrest  an  individual  in  his  or her \nhome without either an arrest warrant or probable cause plus exigent \ncircumstances. Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980). \nh)  A  police  officer may not enter a  suspect's  home  without  a search \nwarrant  or  voluntary  consent  unless  probable  cause  and  exigent \ncircumstances exist, and any resulting search and seizure is prohibited \nunder the  Fourth Amendment.  Payton v.  New  York,  445  U.S.  573, \n586  (1980).  Exigent circumstances exist \"when the  inevitable delay \nincident to obtaining a warrant must give way to an urgent need for \nimmediate action.\"  United States v.  Satterfield,  743  F.2d 827, 844 \n(11 th  Cir.  1984).  Situations  in  which  exigent  circumstances  exist \ninclude:  \"danger  of flight  or escape;  danger of [physical]  harm  to \npolice officers or the general public; risk of loss, destruction, removal, \nor concealment of evidence; and  'hot pursuit' of a fleeing  suspect.\" \nUnited States v.  Blasco, 702 F.2d 1315, 1325 (11 th Cir. 1983).  \"The \nmere presence of contraband, however, does not give rise to exigent \ncircumstances.\"  United States v.  Lynch, 934 F.2d  1226,  1232 (11 \nth \nCir.  1991).  Rather, \"the appropriate inquiry is whether the facts ... \nwould lead a reasonable, experienced [o fficer] to believe that evidence \nmight be destroyed before a warrant could be secured.\"  United States \nv.  Tobin, 923 F .2d 1506, 1510 (11  Cir. 1991). \nth \n4 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 5 of 11\n2.  Identification Requirement for APD Officers \nThe City of Atlanta shall require all Atlanta police officers who are in \nuniform,  other  than  a  rain  slicker  or  traffic  direction  vest,  to  wear  a \nconspicuously visible nametag, and to require any Atlanta police officer who \nis  in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of police authority \n(such as a police vest, etc.), to identifY himself by name and badge number \nupon request at some point before the end of an encounter with a civilian. \n3.  No Interference with Audio or Video Recordings \nThe  City  of  Atlanta  shall  prohibit  Atlanta  police  officers  from \ninterfering  in  any  way  with  a  citizen's  right  to  make  video,  audio,  or \nphotographic recordings of police activity, as  long as  such recording does \nnot physically interfere with the performance of an officer's duty. \n4.  Documentation of Warrantless Seizures \nWith regard to any warrantless seizure (e.g. Terry stop), warrantless \nfrisk,  or  warrantless  search  of a  person  conducted  by  an  Atlanta police \nofficer inside any residence or commercial building or structure, the City of \nAtlanta shall require the officer to fill out a written or electronic form before \nthe  end  of hislher  shift  documenting  the  specific  crime(s)  of which  the \nindividual  was  suspected;  indicating  the  specific  facts  giving  rise  to \n5 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 6 of 11\nreasonable articulable suspicion regarding that crime; indicating whether the \nindividual was frisked for weapons, and if so giving the specific facts giving \nrise  to  reasonable  articulable  suspicion  that  he  was  both  armed  AND \ndangerous;  indicating  whether  the  individual  was  searched  for  anything \nother than weapons, and if so giving the specific facts  giving rise both to \nprobable  cause  and  exigent  circumstances.  The  requirements  of  this \nparagraph shall not apply if the action is in immediate response to a nonยญ\npolice-officer-initiated 9-1-1  call.  These reports shall be a public record, \nroutinely  available  for  public  inspection  by  electronic  or  other  means, \npursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. \n5.  Documentation of ID Checks \nWith regard to any ID check over the ACIC/GCICINCIC system by \nan  Atlanta  police  officer  and  involving  persons  within  any  residence  or \ncommercial building or structure, the City of Atlanta shall require the officer \nperforming the check to fill out a written or electronic form before the end of \nhislher shift documenting the specific authority for the ID check (whether by \nconsent or pursuant to  a Terry  stop or  arrest),  and  in the  case of checks \npursuant  to  a  Terry  stop,  to  complete  the  form  described  above.  The \nrequirements of this paragraph shall not apply if the action is in immediate \nresponse to a non-police-officer-initiated 9-1-1 call.  These reports shall be a \n6 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 7 of 11\npublic record, routinely available for public inspection by electronic or other \nmeans, pursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. \n6.

Recurring training \non these topics will be given to each sworn officer every two years.  The \ntraining materials used in connection with this training reports shall be a \npublic record, routinely available for public inspection by electronic or other \nmeans, pursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. \n7 \n\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 265-1    Filed 12/08/10   Page 8 of 11\n7. Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints \nThe Atlanta Police Department shall investigate and finally adjudicate \nall citizen complaints of police misconduct of any kind within 180 days of \nthe complaint. \n8.  Investigation of Officer Conduct \nThe  Atlanta Police  Department shall  conduct and  conclude,  within \n180 days of this agreement, a thorough and meaningful investigation into the \nindividual conduct of each officer involved in the planning, execution, and \naftermath of the  \"Eagle Raid\" and  any proceeding arising therefrom with \nregard to  each of the  following  Work Rules  in effect on the  date  of the \nconduct under investigation: \n4.1.03  Truthfulness  (\"Employees  will  be  truthful  in  their \nwritten and spoken words at all time.\") \n4.1.05  Obey the Law (\"Employees will uphold the Constitutions \nof the  United  States  and the  State  of Georgia,  obey all  applicable \nfederal,  state,  and local  laws,  and  comply with all  applicable  court \ndecisions and orders of the courts.\") \n4.2.02  Courtesy  (\"A.

The reasonableness inquiry refers to whether \nthe employees actions are \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the facts \nand circumstances confronting him or her, without regard to their \nunderlying intent or motivation. The \"reasonableness\" of a particular \nuse of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable \nofficer on the scene, and its calculus must embody an allowance for \nthe fact that police officers are often forced to make split second \ndecisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation \n(Graham v.

Whitley, the appointed Special Master in the above-\nreferenced case, in furtherance of the duties imposed by this Court's Order entered \nJune  22,  2016  [Dkt.  No.  309]  (the  \"Special  Master  Order\"),  and  submits  this \nSpecial Master Quarterly Compliance Report dated April 12, 2017 (hereinafter, the \n\"4/12 Report\") setting forth the Special Master's compliance findings as of the date \nof this 4/12 Report:  \nPROLOGUE\nOn  September  29,  2016,  the  Special  Master  filed  the  Special  Master \nQuarterly Compliance Report dated September 29, 2016 [Dkt. No. 324] (the \"9/29 \n1\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 2 of 30\nReport\")1, and on December 30, 2016, the Special Master filed the Special Master \nQuarterly Compliance Report dated December 30, 2016 [Dkt. No. 325] (the \"12/30 \nReport\" and together with the 9/29 Report, the \"Past Compliance Reports\").  In  the \nPast Compliance Reports, the Special Master preliminarily found, except as set \nforth otherwise therein, that the City had complied or attempted in good faith to \ncomply with the requirements of the Court Orders after entry of the 2015 Order \nand generally reserved final judgment, provided the Special Master would be re-\nvisiting  all  preliminary  findings  in  conjunction  with  future  reports,  pending \ndiscovery and evaluation of additional facts. \nAs more fully explained in the Past Compliance Reports, this approach was \nbased on an assumption of continued commitment by the City towards achieving a \nconsensus of compliance with the Court Orders through ongoing efforts under the \nConsent Order Setting Forth Initial Special Master Monitoring, Discovery, and \nDispute Resolution Procedures [Dkt. No. 323], as subsequently modified by the \nConsent  Order  Modifying  Limited  Provisions  of  Consent  Order  Setting  Forth \nInitial Special Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures \n[Dkt. No. 339] (hereinafter, collectively, the \"Procedures Order\").\n1 All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall be attributed the same \nmeanings attributed to them in the 9/29 Compliance Report.\n2\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 3 of 30\nOver the past three months, the Special Master has continued to perfect the \nrecord related to compliance with the assistance of the parties.   Below are the \nSpecial Master's limited findings as of this 4/12 Report regarding compliance with \nthe Court Orders, with a particular focus on the time period between the 12/30 \nReport and the filing of this report, provided the Special Master will be further \ninvestigating, revisiting, and/or supplementing all findings in the next quarterly \ncompliance report, due in June 2017, and those that follow.  \nMETHODOLOGY\n In conducting the Special Master's independent investigation and preparing \nthis report, the Special Master has given consideration to: (i) relevant pleadings, \nfilings, and discovery in the above-styled case, including, but not limited to, the \nCourt  Orders  and  the  Procedures  Order;  (ii)  various  party  and  non-party \ndocuments,  information,  and  accounts  requested  and  received  by  the  Special \nMaster as relevant to the determination of compliance with the Court Orders; and \n(iii)  the  parties'  direct  representations,  as  officers  of  the  Court,  to  the  Special \nMaster, as an officer of the Court. \nWhere possible, evidence has been reviewed according to a preponderance \nof the evidence standard to make a preliminary determination about compliance; \nhowever, no formal evidentiary hearing has been requested or held, and the Special \n3\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 4 of 30\nMaster has not had an opportunity to consider all potentially relevant evidence.  \nAdditionally, in some instances, the Special Master explicitly finds that additional \nevidence  or  time  is  needed  to  formulate  a  complete  opinion  on  compliance.  \nTherefore, these limited findings are subject to further review and revision, and no \nparty is deemed to have waived any evidentiary rights or objections.  \nUltimately, the Special Master intends to move to more formal briefings and \nhearings  in  conjunction  with  efforts  to  apply  applicable  Eleventh  Circuit \ncompliance standards and additional finality; however, at this time, the Special \nMaster continues to believe that additional and more frequent informal meetings \namong the parties will continue to cater to a consensus of complete compliance, as \ncontemplated by the Special Master Order and as discussed more fully below. \nFINDINGS\n  For  purposes  of  this  4/12  Report,  the  Special  Master  is  organizing \ncompliance findings by topic, as referenced in the 2010 Order and the 2011 Order, \nwith references to related issues from the 2015 Order. Utilizing this approach, the \nSpecial Master aims to provide a more comprehensive and wholesome analysis of \nrelated compliance issues arising out of the Court Orders. The Special Master has \nattempted  to  accurately  paraphrase  the  requirements  of  the  Court  Orders  and \nunderstands and acknowledges that compliance with the Court Orders -- not the \n4\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 5 of 30\nSpecial  Master's  short  form  interpretations  thereof  --  is  the  relevant  inquiry. \nAccordingly, nothing in this 4/12 Report, including any paraphrased language, is \nintended to (nor shall it) modify, alter, or amend any of this Court's Orders.  To the \nextent there is any conflict, the Court Orders prevail and are controlling.\n1. REVOCATION  OR  AMENDMENT  OF  UNCONSTITUTIONAL \nPOLICIES [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 1] AND RELATED ISSUES FROM \n2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถยถ 4(a), 4(b), 7, and 8].\nAs more particularly set forth in the Past Compliance Reports, to the best of \nthe  Special  Master's  knowledge,  the  City  timely  complied  with  the  technical  \nrequirements of the Court Orders referenced above, and the Special Master is not \npresently aware of any disputes related to the revocation and/or amendment of \nunconstitutional policies, as required by the Court Orders.\nNotably, on January 6, 2017 and on March 1, 2017, the City of Atlanta \nprovided  affidavits  of  APD  Police  Chief  Erika  Shields  attaching  copies  of  all \nStandard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\") related to the above-captioned matter, \nwhich confirm that the SOPs attached thereto accurately reflect the SOPs then in \neffect and that no changes had been made to those particular SOPs on or after the \ndate they were signed into effect by former Police Chief George N. Turner on May \n29, 2015 in response to the 2015 Court Order.   Further, on or around March 27, \n2017, the Special Master received written confirmation from Plaintiffs' Counsel \n5\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 6 of 30\nconfirming that \"Plaintiffs have no comment about the affidavit submitted by the \nChief.\"  \nHowever, the Special Master notes that the aforementioned affidavits are \nunclear  on  their  face  as  to  whether  all  APD  SOPs  have  been  provided,  as \ncontemplated by the Procedures Order at paragraph 4(A) and as required to make a \nfinal  determination  as  to  compliance  with  the  2011  Order.  Upon  review,  the \nSpecial  Master  did  receive  an  email  from  the  City  seeking  clarification  as  to \nwhether all APD SOPs were requested. Accordingly, consistent with the Special \nMaster's discussion during an April 3, 2017 ex parte conference with the City, the \nSpecial Master hereby clarifies and requests that all SOPs be provided in future \nproductions,  together  with  any  additional  or  amended  affidavits  that  may  be \nnecessary  to  address  the  requirements  set  forth  by  paragraph  4(A)  of  the \nProcedures Order and to monitor compliance with the requirements set forth at Ex. \nA, ยถ 1 of the 2011 Court Order and at ยถยถ 4(a), 4(b), 7, and 8 of the 2015 Order. \nThis  shall  clarify  the  scope  of  paragraph  4(A)  of  the  Procedures  Order  going \nforward until future notice.\nIn sum, additional fact finding and scrutiny are necessary before the Special \nMaster can find that the ADP SOPs, as amended, have fully implemented \"all [] \nrevisions required by [the Court Orders].\"  The Special Master believes a finding \n6\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 7 of 30\nof  compliance  eventually  will  be  appropriate  and  forthcoming;  however,  the \nSpecial Master again withholds or defers any final finding out of necessity at this \ntime. This issue will be re-visited in conjunction with future quarterly reports.\n2. IDENTIFICATION  REQUIREMENT  FOR  APD  OFFICERS  [2011 \nOrder at Ex. A, ยถ 2].\nAs set forth in the Past Compliance Reports, disputes existed and still exist \nas  to  whether  the  City  has  achieved  complete  compliance  with  respect  to  the \nfollowing requirement of the 2010 Order and 2011 Order:\n2. Identification Requirement for APD Officers\nThe City of Atlanta shall require all Atlanta police officers who are in \nuniform, other than a rain slicker or traffic direction vest, to wear a \nconspicuously  visible  nametag,  and  to  require  any  Atlanta  police \nofficer who is in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of \npolice authority (such as a police vest, etc.), to identify himself by \nname and badge number upon request at some point before the end of \nan encounter with a civilian.\nIn conjunction with development of the Procedures Order, the parties agreed \nto implement  and monitor additional procedures that would aid in achieving a \nconsensus of complete compliance with regard to the identification requirements \nfor APD Officers in the Court Orders, including, but not limited to, the ones set \nforth at paragraph 4(D) of the Procedures Order.  Along these lines, on or around \nJanuary 3, 2017, the City provided to Plaintiffs' Counsel and the Special Master a \n7\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 8 of 30\nschedule of routine daily uniform inspections and addresses for the inspections by \nAPD zone, affording the Special Master and/or Plaintiffs' Counsel the opportunity \nto attend daily uniform inspections for monitoring purposes contemplated by the \nCourt Orders.  \nOn March 9, 2017, the Special Master sent staff members to inspect a Zone \n2  daily  roll-call  uniform  inspection  supervised  by  Sergeant  A.  P.  Taddei, \nLieutenant A. Singh, and Major Barry Shaw, among others. At the inspection, the \nSpecial Master's staff observed one individual wearing an APD issue bullet-proof \nvest  but  no  conspicuously  visible  name  tag.  This  individual  was  not  actively \nparticipating in but was present at the APD offices during roll-call. All other APD \npersonnel  present  for  or  participating  in  daily  roll  call  were  confirmed  by  the \nSpecial Master's staff and by APD supervisors to be wearing conspicuously visible \nname tags in conjunction with the daily roll call uniform inspection. \nAfter the inspection, the Special Master's staff interviewed one or more Zone \n2  supervisors  related  to,  among  other  things,  (i)  standard  practices  related  to \ncompliance with the identification requirements, (ii) ramifications of an officer's \nfailure to wear a conspicuously visible name tag during daily roll-call inspections, \nand (iii) the presence of somebody without a conspicuously visible name tag. The \nSpecial Master's staff was informed that the standard practice is to inspect every \n8\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 9 of 30\nofficer's name tag during his/her respective roll call and the ramification for failure \nto  wear  a  conspicuously  visible  name  tag  during  roll-call  is  to  be  sent  home \nwithout pay. When asked about the person present without a name tag, one or more \nsupervisors confirmed that the individual in question was not a member of APD, \nbut instead an intern, who must wear a bullet proof vest by law but would not be \ncovered by the Court Orders and would not be allowed to wear an APD badge or \nother insignia of APD authority.  An intern is not a sworn APD officer.\nBased on this initial inspection and report, the Special Master is generally \nsatisfied with the chain of command supervision of the name tag requirements \nobserved at the March 9, 2017 daily roll call inspection.  Nonetheless, the Special \nMaster  will  continue  to  inspect  daily  roll  call  inspections  and  explore  other \nsituations contemplated by the Court Orders, including any additional concerns \nraised by Plaintiffs.2\n2 On or around November 6, 2016, Plaintiffs' Counsel provided a specific example \nof an APD officer who was photographed by Plaintiffs' Counsel and appears to be \nin  APD  uniform,  other  than  a  rain  slicker  or  traffic  direction  vest,  without  a \nconspicuously  visible  nametag.  Notably,  however,  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  did  not \nprovide identifying information related to the individual, and therefore, the Special \nMaster has limited ability to investigate further. As set forth in this report, the \nSpecial Master continues to assess compliance with the identification requirements \nset forth in the Court Orders utilizing the powers available to him under the Special \nMaster Order and the Procedures Order. Based on presently available information, \nthe Special Master believes that the situation identified by Plaintiffs' Counsel on or \naround November 6, 2016 was most likely an isolated occurrence.   If Plaintiffs' \nCounsel  have  reason  to  believe  it  was  not  an  isolated  occurrence,  the  Special \n9\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 10 of 30\nBy way of example, first, the Special Master has requested a schedule of the \nmore  robust,  periodic  uniform  and  nametag  inspections  required  by  paragraph \n4(D)(ii) of the Procedures Order. The Special Master was advised by the City that \nthese inspections are not scheduled in advance, to preserve the element of surprise; \nhowever, the City has agreed to coordinate one or more inspection(s) with the \nSpecial Master's schedule. The Special Master will coordinate directly with Major \nMcGhee of the APD.  Second, the Special Master would like to review and hereby \nrequests (on a prospective basis) that the City provide to the Special Master and \nPlaintiffs'  Counsel  any  written  records  of  or  related  to  the  paragraph  4(D)(ii) \nnametag inspections, to assist with the Special Master's monitoring efforts related \nto same, including, but not limited to, any completed Watch Commander's Roll \nCall Checklists and/or Roll Call Assignment Sheets, and any other documentation \nthat  tends  to  confirm  (or  not  to  confirm)  compliance  with  the  identification \nrequirements.  Third,  the  Special  Master  hereby  requests  that  the  City  provide \nrecords  sufficient  to  identify  approved  \"second  jobs\"  or  \"extra  jobs\"  for  APD \nofficers and the locations thereof, including, but not limited to, access to the field \ninspection team monitoring same, as contemplated by paragraph 4(D)(iii)(2) of the \nProcedures Order.  Fourth, the Special Master hereby requests an opportunity for \nMaster hereby requests from Plaintiffs' Counsel any additional information that can \nbe provided so the Special Master may investigate the situation more fully.\n10\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 11 of 30\ninspection of the robust nametag inspections contemplated by paragraph 4(D)(ii) of \nthe Procedures Order as they pertain to one or more \"special units\" as identified by \nMajor Schierbaum and Captain Klotzer in the Special Master's April 3, 2017 ex \nparte conference with the City and certain other representatives of APD.   The \nSpecial  Master  presently  intends  to  continue  monitoring  compliance  with  the \nidentification requirements for APD officers and will document his findings to \nPlaintiffs' Counsel, the City, and this Court.\nGenerally, however, as of the filing of this report, the Special Master has no \nbasis to believe that the City is not complying with and/or attempting in good faith \nto  comply  with  the  identification  requirements  for  APD  officers  and  therefore \nagain preliminarily finds that the City is in substantial compliance with the same.  \nNotwithstanding  these  preliminary  findings,  the  Special  Master  has  determined \nthat additional fact finding is necessary before a final finding as to compliance \nwould be appropriate. Accordingly, a final finding of compliance is withheld or \ndeferred out of necessity, pending review of additional evidence by the Special \nMaster, and the issue of complete compliance will be re-visited, as necessary and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.\n11\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 12 of 30\n3. NO  INTERFERENCE  WITH  AUDIO  OR  VIDEO  RECORDINGS \n[2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 3].\nThe  Special  Master  does  not  have  sufficient  evidence  to  make  a \ndetermination related to this requirement and withholds any further discussion until \nthe next quarterly compliance report due in June of 2017.  Plaintiffs' Counsel has \nexpressed potential concerns, which need to be investigated further.  The Special \nMaster hereby requests an ex parte conference with one or more members of the \nPlaintiffs' Counsel team to discuss compliance concerns related to this particular \nrequirement of the Court Orders.  Accordingly, a finding of compliance is withheld \nor deferred out of necessity, pending review of additional evidence by the Special \nMaster, and the issue of complete compliance will be re-visited, as necessary and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.\n4/5. DOCUMENTATION  OF  WARRANTLESS  SEIZURES  AND  ID \nCHECKS  [2011  Order  at  Ex.  A,  ยถยถ  4,  5]  AND  RELATED  ISSUES \nFROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถ 6].\nThe Special Master has reviewed the documentation provided relative to the \nrequirement to document warrantless seizures and ID checks and has identified two \ncritical concerns to be addressed. First, the documents/information provided by the \nCity appear to be insufficient to effectively monitor and to make a determination \nregarding compliance with the above-referenced requirements of the Court Orders.  \nSecond,  although  the  documentation  is  insufficient  to  effectively  monitor \n12\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 13 of 30\ncompliance,  the  Special  Master's  review  and  related  communications  with  the \nparties confirms that the City has not achieved substantial compliance with the \nrequirement to document warrantless seizures and ID checks.   However, on the \nsecond  issue,  the  Special  Master  acknowledges  that  certain  provisions  of  the \nProcedures  Order  and  related  communications  have  contributed  to  the  City's \nunderstanding that they should not train on certain topics related to the above-\ncaptioned case unless or until the training programs are approved by Plaintiffs' \nCounsel.   To be clear, Plaintiffs disagree with any notion that the City has been \nprevented from training on the topic.\nThe City and Plaintiffs' Counsel have both expressed the desire to expedite a \npath  towards  a  consensus  of  complete  compliance,  including,  among  potential \nother strategies, the following: (i) approval and distribution of a \"demographic \nform flowchart\" for reference by APD officers in the field as a compliance tool; (ii) \napproval  and  distribution  of  a  limited  \"roll  call\"  training  program  on  the \nrequirement to document warrantless seizures; (iii) approval and distribution of a \nmore  robust  Calhoun  Training  covering  this  topic,  among  others;  and  (iv) \nprospective monitoring of more limited data sets in shorter time intervals to allow \nfor evaluation of the City's compliance and adjustments to the monitoring process \non a more frequent basis than originally contemplated by the Procedures Order. \n13\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 14 of 30\nHowever, there has not been ample time to fully discuss and reach agreement on \nthese matters prior to the filing of this report. \nGiven the importance of the requirements related to the documentation of \nwarrantless seizures and ID checks to the spirit of the Court Orders, and given both \nparties' stated desire to achieve a consensus of complete compliance, in lieu of any \nsanctions, the Special Master is coordinating and requiring the following: (i) Major \nSchierbaum  and  his  Training  Academy  team  are  asked  to  deliver  to  a  sample \nrecruiting class the \"demographic form flowchart\" approved by Plaintiffs' Counsel \nand the \"demographic form flowchart\" in the format contemplated by the City as \ndiscussed at the April 3, 2017 ex parte meeting for a test-run; (ii) within two \nweeks, Major Schierbaum and his team are to provide the Special Master the test \ndata and results from the recruiting class sampling, to be shared with Plaintiffs' \nCounsel; (iii) contemporaneously with the presentation of the test data and results, \nMajor Schierbaum and his team are asked to present to Plaintiffs' Counsel and the \nSpecial Master a proposed \"roll-call training\" program or agenda for review and \napproval, separate and apart from the Calhoun Training program; (iv) subject to \nreasonable objections by the Plaintiffs' Counsel and/or the Special Master within \nseventy-two hours, the City is directed to disseminate the approved \"demographic \nform flowchart\" and \"roll-call training\" program to all APD personnel as soon as \n14\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 15 of 30\nreasonably possible and to provide documentary confirmation of the roll out to \nPlaintiffs'  Counsel  and  the  Special  Master;  (v)  on  Tuesday,  April  25,  2017  or \nThursday,  April  27,  2017  or  another  date  mutually  acceptable  to  the  parties, \nPlaintiffs  Counsel,  City  Counsel,  the  Special  Master,  and  certain  APD \nrepresentatives present for the April 3, 2017 ex parte conference with the Special \nMaster  will  meet  at  Director  Barrett's  911  Call  Center  facility  to  discuss  the \ndocuments and processes by which Director Barrett, Major Schierbaum, Captain \nKlotzer,  Major  Murphy,  and  Lt.  Spann  recommend  the  Special  Master  and \nPlaintiffs' Counsel monitor compliance with the warrantless seizure and ID check \nrequirements, including, but not limited to, appropriately filtered CAD (Computer \nAided Dispatch) System records, GCIC/NCIC/ACIC records, \"before end of shift\" \ndemographic  forms,  supervisor  approved  demographic  forms,  and  \"audit  trail\" \nreports related to all demographic forms identifying when, if ever, any changes \nwere made to the demographic forms in the City's systems or databases and what \nthose changes entailed; and (vi) after the meeting at Director Barrett's 911 call \ncenter, the City will be required to provide all documentation agreed upon by the \nparties at said meeting in two week intervals and to discuss any compliance issues \nin weekly or bi-weekly in-person meetings between the parties and the Special \nMaster to be scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM to 12:00 Noon at the \n15\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 16 of 30\nLaw  Offices  of  Baker,  Donelson,  Bearman,  Caldwell  &  Berkowitz,  P.C.,  with \nattendance required by at least one authorized representative for each party and any \nnecessary  APD  representatives.   Please  note:  Any  prospective  monitoring \nrequirement is in addition to all other productions required by the other Court \nOrders, the Procedures Order, or by agreement between the Special Master and \nthe City, until further notice or agreement by the parties.\n6. \"CALHOUN\" TRAINING [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 6] AND RELATED \nISSUES FROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถยถ 1, 2, 3].\nAs set forth more fully in the Past Compliance Reports, although there are \ndisputes  related  to  past  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Court  Orders \nrelated to Calhoun Training, the Special Master has been and remains inclined to \nfind  that  the  City  has  achieved  substantial,  technical  compliance  with  the  past \nrequirements related to Calhoun Training, provided that the City confirm its good \nfaith through completion of the procedures related to future training set forth by the \nProcedures Order, resulting in a Calhoun Training program with content and in a \nformat acceptable to Plaintiffs to be delivered to all sworn APD employees within \nthe time frames contemplated by the Court Orders for recurrent Calhoun Training, \non  or  before  August  17,  2017.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  parties' \nprospective focus and approach in the Procedures Order and ongoing collaborative \n16\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 17 of 30\nefforts between the parties. Accordingly, compliance with the Calhoun Training \nrequirements will be revisited in conjunction with future compliance reports.  \nNotably, the City has agreed to circulate a revised Calhoun Training script \non or before April 14, 2017, and the parties are presently scheduled to meet on \nApril  19,  2017  with  the  Special  Master  and  APD  Training  Academy  team  to \naddress any issues related to the then-current content and format of the Calhoun \nTraining  script.  Upon  receipt  of  the  revised  script,  the  Special  Master  hereby \ndirects  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  to  proceed  with  the  \"Materials  for  Consideration\" \nprocess contemplated by the Procedures Order to the extent possible, including \nreview of the revised script to confirm whether all required material is included.  \nTo the extent all issues are not resolved, the Special Master will expect the \nparties to discuss any remaining issues in weekly or bi-weekly in-person meetings \nbetween the parties, the Special Master, and representatives of the APD Training \nAcademy team to be scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM to 12:00 Noon \nat the Law Offices of Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, P.C., \nwith attendance required by at least one authorized counsel representative for each \nparty, until the Calhoun Training program has been approved as to format and \ncontent by Plaintiffs' Counsel.\n17\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 18 of 30\n7. TIMELY RESOLUTION OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS [2011 Order at \nEx. A, ยถ 7] AND RELATED ISSUES FROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order \nat ยถ 5] AND PROCEDURES ORDER.\nAs set forth more fully in the Past Compliance Reports, without making any \nfinal findings, the Special Master preliminarily found that the City achieved, at a \nminimum, technical and substantial compliance with the requirements of the 2015 \nOrder  through  its  initial  production  and  subsequent  curing  of  any  apparent \ndeficiencies, if any, related to the OPS spreadsheet.  However, disputes existed and \nstill exist as to the City's compliance with certain related requirements of other \nCourt Orders, for example, paragraph 7 of Exhibit A to the 2010 Order, which \nprovides:\n7. Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints\nThe Atlanta Police Department shall investigate and finally adjudicate \nall citizen complaints of police misconduct of any kind within 180 \ndays of the complaint.\nAgain, the disputes between the parties appear to relate to two issues.  First, there \nare questions related to the documentation being provided and its effectiveness to \nmonitor compliance. Second, Plaintiffs' Counsel have expressed concerns about the \nCity's  substantive  compliance  (i.e.,  whether  all  citizen  complaints  of  police \nmisconduct of any kind are being investigated and adjudicated within 180 days of \nthe complaint).\n18\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 19 of 30\nIn conjunction with development of the Procedures Order, the parties agreed \nto implement  and monitor additional procedures that would aid in achieving a \nconsensus of complete compliance with regard to the timely resolution of citizen \ncomplaints  required  by  the  Court  Orders,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the \nprocedures  set  forth  at  paragraph  4(B)  of  the  Procedures  Order  and  various \nadditional procedures put in place at the request of the Special Master after review \nof  initial  materials  submitted  by  the  City  under  the  Procedures  Order  and \napplicable Court Orders.\nBased  on  the  City's  initial  and  supplemental  submissions  to  the  Special \nMaster  and  Plaintiffs,  the  Special  Master  generally  believes  and  finds,  as  a \npreliminary matter, that the City has substantially complied with or attempted to \ncomply in good faith with the additional requirements set forth at paragraph 4(B) \nof  the  Procedures  Order  and  related  requests  from  the  Special  Master,  which \ndemonstrates  a  good  faith  commitment  to  accomplishing  the  end  goal  of  a \ncomplete consensus of compliance with the Court Orders.  However, this does not \nnecessarily demonstrate compliance with the Court Orders.\nNotably,  a  comprehensive  project  has  been  commenced  by  the  Special \nMaster to confirm the date that each OPS \"closed file\" referenced on the OPS \nspreadsheets prepared by the City was produced pursuant to paragraph 4(B) of the \n19\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 20 of 30\nProcedures Order and to verify the data set forth on the spreadsheet relative to the \nrequirement in the Court Orders \"to investigate and finally adjudicate all citizen \ncomplaints of police misconduct of any kind within 180 days of the complaint.\"  \nSee  2011  Court  Order  at  ยถ  7.   While  the  review  is  not  complete,  the  Special \nMaster's initial findings tend to support the Special Master's preliminary finding of \ncompliance inasmuch as some 98.5% of OPS citizen complaint files reviewed by \nthe Special Master were investigated and adjudicated within the required 180-day \nperiod. The Special Master will continue the comprehensive review and provide \ncompliance metrics to the parties upon completion of the same.3  Of course, given \nthe incomplete status of the review, these findings are preliminary.  \nNotwithstanding the Special Master's preliminary findings, there also remain \ndisputes between the parties as to the full breadth of the requirements related to the \nresolution  of  citizen  complaints,  and  the  Special  Master  has  determined  that \nadditional fact finding is necessary before a final finding as to compliance with the \n3 Notably, on or around April 3, 2017, the Special Master discussed with certain \nAPD  representatives  the  ongoing  project  and  additional  information  that  could \npotentially expedite the Special Master's review on a prospective basis; however, \nthe City expressed staffing and budgetary concerns that presently limit the City's \nability to agree to any additional voluntary procedures at this time.  Accordingly, \nthe Special Master will continue its review based on the documentation presently \navailable but will revisit this issue any time at the request of the City, in an effort \nto decrease overall costs related to monitoring compliance.\n20\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 21 of 30\nCourt Orders would be appropriate.4 These disputes and the potential ramifications \nthereof require additional consideration by the Special Master. Accordingly, a final \nfinding of compliance is withheld or deferred out of necessity, pending review of \nadditional evidence by the Special Master, and the issue of complete compliance \nwill  be  re-visited,  as  necessary  and  appropriate,  in  conjunction  with  future \nquarterly reports.\nTo the extent all issues are not resolved by agreement between the parties, \nthe  Special  Master  will  expect  the  parties  to  discuss  any  remaining  issues  in \nweekly or bi-weekly in-person meetings between the parties, the Special Master, \nand representatives of the APD to be scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM \nto  12:00  Noon  at  the  Law  Offices  of  Baker,  Donelson,  Bearman,  Caldwell  & \nBerkowitz,  P.C.,  with  attendance  required  by  at  least  one  authorized  counsel \nrepresentative for each party and any appropriate APD representatives, until any \nissues related to the compliance requirements have been fully resolved.\n4  For  example,  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  have  expressed  their  position  that  the \nrequirement to investigate and adjudicate citizen complaints of police misconduct \n\"of any kind\" within 180 days of the complaint must be construed literally and has \nbroad application to citizen complaints \"of any kind.\"  The City's position has been \nthat the Court Orders must be construed more narrowly.\n21\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 22 of 30\n8. INVESTIGATION OF OFFICER CONDUCT [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ \n8].\nThe Special Master is not aware of any disputes related to the requirements \nrelative to the investigation of officer conduct but has not fully investigated the \nmatter.   Therefore, at this time, while the Special Master believes a finding of \ncompliance is appropriate and will be forthcoming, there is not sufficient evidence \nto  make  a  final  determination  related  to  this  requirement,  and  any  further \ndiscussion is withheld until the next quarterly compliance report due in June 2017.\n9. MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL  TASK  FORCE  ASSIGNMENTS  [2011 \nOrder at Ex. A, ยถ 9].\nThe Special Master is not aware of any disputes related to the requirements \nrelative  to  the  multi-jurisdictional  task  force  assignments  but  has  not  fully \ninvestigated the matter.  Therefore, at this time, while the Special Master believes a \nfinding of compliance is appropriate and will be forthcoming, there is not sufficient \nevidence to make a final determination related to this requirement, and any further \ndiscussion is withheld until the next quarterly compliance report due in June 2017.\n10. OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF 2015 COURT ORDER [2015 Order at \nยถยถ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14].\nA.  Paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the 2015 Order.\nParagraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the 2015 Order relate to requests for documents \nand information in conjunction with efforts to monitor compliance under the Court \n22\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 23 of 30\nOrders. With regard to these requirements, the Special Master finds that the City \nhas generally attempted in good faith to comply with the applicable Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, the Local Rules and Standing Orders of this Court, the Court \nOrders,  and  the  Procedures  Order;  however,  the  Special  Master  finds  that \nadditional coordination and collaboration with APD representatives is necessary to \nidentify the documentation needed to monitor compliance efforts, to streamline \nmonitoring efforts, and to achieve a consensus of complete compliance with the \nCourt Orders.  Along these lines, and in an effort to make the monitoring process \nmore  transparent  and  efficient  for  everyone  involved,  the  Special  Master  is \nrequiring additional weekly or bi-weekly in-person meetings between the parties \nand the Special Master to be scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM to 12:00 \nNoon at the Law Offices of Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, \nP.C., with attendance required by at least one authorized counsel representative for \neach party and any necessary APD representatives.\nWith regard to the specific outstanding document and information requests \nset forth in Plaintiffs' Counsel's letter dated March 2, 2017, based on April 3, 2017 \ndiscussions  with  APD  representatives  including  Director  Barrett,  Major \nSchierbaum, Captain Klotzer, Major Murphy, and Lt. Spann, the Special Master \nbelieves and finds that certain documents requested by Plaintiffs' Counsel may and \n23\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 24 of 30\ncertain  documents  may  not  be  appropriate  and/or  reasonable  to  monitor \ncompliance with the Court Orders.  Instead of requiring the City to produce all of \nthe requested documents, the Special Master is requiring the City to present its  \nrecommendation regarding a compliance monitoring program to the Special Master \nand Plaintiffs' Counsel on Tuesday, April 25, 2017 or Thursday, April 27, 2017 or \nanother date mutually acceptable to the parties, including a review and discussion \nof the documents referenced in Plaintiffs' letter request dated March 2, 2017, the \ndocuments referenced in the Special Master's email request dated March 7, 2017, \nand the documents discussed during the April 3, 2017 ex parte conference between \nthe City, APD representatives, and the Special Master, including, but not limited \nto,  appropriately  filtered  CAD  (Computer  Aided  Dispatch)  System  records, \nGCIC/NCIC/ACIC records, \"before end of shift\" demographic forms, supervisor \napproved demographic forms, and \"audit trail\" reports related to all demographic \nforms identifying when, if ever, any changes were made to the demographic forms \nin the City's systems or databases and what those changes entailed.  \nAs set forth above, after the meeting at Director Barrett's 911 call center, the \nCity will be required to provide all documentation agreed upon by the parties at \nsaid meeting in two week intervals and to discuss any compliance issues in weekly \nor bi-weekly in-person meetings between the parties and the Special Master to be \n24\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 25 of 30\nscheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM to 12:00 Noon at the Law Offices of \nBaker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, P.C., with attendance required \nby at least one authorized counsel representative for each party and any necessary \nAPD representatives.  Please note: Any prospective monitoring requirement is in \naddition  to  all  other  productions  required  by  the  other  Court  Orders,  the \nProcedures Order, or by agreement between the Special Master and the City, until \nfurther notice or agreement by the parties.\nWith regard to the matters set forth in the letter from Plaintiffs' Counsel \ndated March 10, 2017, the Special Master has investigated the allegations set forth \ntherein  and  finds  that  although  the  original  affidavit  contained  inaccurate \nstatements,  there  was  no  intent  to  deceive  by  the  affiant  and/or  the  City,  as \nconfirmed  by  the  amended  affidavit.  The  Special  Master's  inquiry  is  ongoing; \nhowever, the initial inaccuracies identified by Plaintiffs' Counsel were not and are \nnot material to the Special Master's duties or compliance with the Court Orders.  \nHowever, the Special Master does encourage the City to increase its attention to \ndetail  and  quality  of  review  prior  to  submissions  to  the  Special  Master,  as  an \nofficer of this Court.\nFurthermore, the Special Master does believe that additional communication \nand transparency are necessary and appropriate to achieve a consensus of complete \n25\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 26 of 30\ncompliance  with  the  Court  Orders.  Along  these  lines,  the  Special  Master \nencourages  the  parties  to  engage  in  more  open  discussion  of  this  and  other \ncompliance  issues  in  the  weekly  or  bi-weekly  in-person  meetings  between  the \nparties and the Special Master to be scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM \nto  12:00  Noon  at  the  Law  Offices  of  Baker,  Donelson,  Bearman,  Caldwell  & \nBerkowitz, P.C.\nB.  Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the 2015 Order.\nThe Special Master has reviewed the record related to paragraph 12 and \nfinds that the City is generally and technically compliant; however, due to the \nongoing nature of the paragraph 12 requirements, a final finding is withheld or \ndeferred  out  of  necessity,  and  this  issue  will  be  re-visited,  as  necessary  and \nappropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.\n  The Special Master has reviewed the record related to paragraph 13 and \nfinds that the City fully complied with the requirement of paragraph 13.\nC.  Paragraph 14 of the 2015 Order.\nParagraph  14  of  the  2015  Order  sets  forth  the  6-year  timeframe \ncontemplated  by  the  2015  Order  and  reiterates  that  the  2015  Order  does  not \noverrule, supersede, or otherwise affect the requirements set forth by the 2010 \n26\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 27 of 30\nOrder and the 2011 Order.  Beyond these general concepts, paragraph 14 does not \nimpose any new or additional requirements on the City.\nDue to the ongoing nature of the paragraph 14 requirements (for 6 years) and \nthe overall applicability to the other requirements of the Court Orders, the Special \nMaster  finds  that  compliance  with  paragraph  14  is  not  presently  ripe  for \ncompliance and that additional fact finding would be necessary for the Special \nMaster to formulate an opinion and basis therefor as to compliance.  Accordingly, \na final finding is withheld or deferred out of necessity, and this issue will be re-\nvisited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future quarterly reports.\nPRELIMINARY CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\nThe Special Master believes that most, if not all, of the disputes between the \nparties  related  to  compliance  with  the  Court  Orders  are  the  direct  result  of \navoidable communication breakdowns.  Recognizing that the burden on the City to \nperform under the Court Orders and Procedures Order is substantial, the Special \nMaster believes that the quickest path to a consensus of complete compliance is \nthrough additional and more effective communications between and among the \nparties and the Special Master.  For this reason, the Special Master is requiring the \nparties to discuss compliance issues more regularly in weekly or bi-weekly in-\nperson meetings between the parties and the Special Master to be scheduled on \n27\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 28 of 30\nFriday  mornings  from  9:00  AM  to  12:00  Noon  at  the  Law  Offices  of  Baker, \nDonelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, P.C., with attendance required by at \nleast one authorized counsel representative for each party and any necessary APD \nrepresentatives.  \nThat  said,  the  Special  Master  is  encouraged  by  the  general  pattern  of \ncompliance  established  by  the  record  and  believes  that  any  concerns  will  be \nresolved by more frequent and effective communications that will lead to quicker \nidentification and resolution of compliance-related disputes toward the end goal of \na consensus of complete compliance. Along these lines, the Special Master will \ncontinue to develop the record related to compliance through additional discovery \nwithin the powers set forth by the Special  Master Order and requests that the \nparties  immediately  make  the  Special  Master  aware  of  any  circumstances  that \nwould prevent a finding of compliance.  \nNotably, the Special Master's strong preference remains to avoid re-visiting \npast  issues  as  counter-productive  and  detrimental  to  the  larger  process  unless \nextraordinary circumstances exist, given the parties' commitment to the approach \nset forth in the Procedures Order and the continued progress being made consistent \ntherewith. However, the Special Master will not deny any party the opportunity to \nbe  heard,  upon  request,  if  the  parties  cannot  reach  a  mutual  understanding \n28\n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 341   Filed 04/12/17   Page 29 of 30\nregarding  the  proper  resolution  of  any  compliance  related  matters.  Any  such \nrequests for a formal hearing should be submitted directly to the Special Master in \nthe form of a motion with appropriate briefing pursuant to the applicable rules of \nthis Court.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Special Master respectfully recommends that \nthe Court adopt this 4/12 Report, imposing the requirements set forth herein but \ndeferring any further action at this time.\nRespectfully submitted by:   /s Joe D.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiffs have become aware that Defendant City of Atlanta (the โCityโ) is \nin violation of the December 15, 2012 Order of this Court (ECF No. 280). Plaintiffs \nare filing this Motion for Contempt to notify the Court of the violations of which \nPlaintiffs are currently aware, and of Plaintiffsโ intention to conduct discovery \nregarding the full extent of the Cityโs non-compliance. When the extent of the \nCityโs non-compliance has been determined through discovery, Plaintiffs will file \nan amended motion for such sanctions as are appropriate in light of the facts. \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 2 of 25\nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \nThis case arose from the unlawful raid of a gay bar by Atlanta police \nofficers in September, 2009 (the โAtlanta Eagle Raidโ). On December 8, 2010, the \nparties concluded a settlement of the above-styled action under which the City \nagreed to undertake certain reforms intended to deter future occurrences of \npolice misconduct such as those that took place during the Atlanta Eagle Raid. \nThese reforms were enumerated in Exhibit A (โReforms of the Atlanta Police \nDepartmentโ) to this Courtโs Settlement Order of December 8, 2010 (the \nโSettlement Orderโ). ECF Nos. 265, 265-1, Dec. 8, 2010. \nBy June, 2011 โ six months after entry of the Settlement Order -- it had \nbecome apparent that the City was not complying with the terms of the \nSettlement Order. Multiple letters, emails, and meetings -- including Plaintiffsโ \noffer to waive attorney fees in return for simple compliance -- failed to persuade \nthe City to comply with the agreement, and on June 16, 2011, Plaintiffs filed a \nmotion for sanctions to enforce the Settlement Order. ECF Nos. 271, 272-1, June \n16, 17, 2011. \nThe Court ordered the parties to appear at a status conference scheduled \nfor December 20, 2011, and in a last minute action to avoid sanctions, just one \nweek before the scheduled conference, the City agreed to: \n  2 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 3 of 25\nโข  Comply with all demands set forth in Plaintiffsโ motion for \nsanctions; \n \nโข  Consent to the conversion of the Settlement Agreement into an \nOrder of the Court; and \n \nโข  Pay $25,000.00 as attorneyโs fees to compensate Plaintiffsโ counsel \nfor the necessity of filing the motion for sanctions.  \n \nJoint Status Report and Consent Agreement, ECF No. 279, Dec. 14, 2011.  \nThe Court issued an Order incorporating the Cityโs commitments on \nDecember 15, 2011, specifically ordering the City to implement the โReforms of \nthe Atlanta Police Departmentโ in the December 8, 2010 Settlement Agreement. \nECF No. 280, Dec. 15, 2011. \nNow, more than three years later, it is apparent that the City is again \nfailing to comply with what is now an Order of this Court. \nIII.  DETAILS OF THE CITYโS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE DECEMBER \n15, 2011 ORDER OF THIS COURT \n \n  The City is in violation of numerous sections of the Order, including those \nrequiring revision of unconstitutional APD Standard Operating Procedures and \nrecurrent training of police officers.  \nIn particular, the City is in violation of the following sections of the Order: \nโข  Section 1: Revocation or Amendment of Unconstitutional Policies  \nโข  Section 2: Identification Requirement for APD Officers \n  3 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 4 of 25\nโข  Sections 4 and 5: Documentation of Seizures and ID Checks \nโข  Section 6: Training \nโข  Section 7: Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints \n1.  Revocation or Amendment of Unconstitutional Policies (Section 1 of the \nCourtโs Order) \n \nSection 1 of the Settlement Order required the City โpermanently to revoke \nor amend all Atlanta Police Department SOPsโ which contained provisions \ninconsistent with Fourth Amendment law, โincluding but not limited toโฆ \nSOP.3065.โ  See ECF No. 280, Dec. 15, 2011 (emphasis added). \nSOP.3065 is the Cityโs โStop and Friskโ procedure.  The version in effect at \nthe time of the Atlanta Eagle Raid instructed police officers to detain and frisk \nโsuspiciousโ individuals without the reasonable articulable suspicion required \nby the Fourth Amendment.  \nThe Cityโs refusal to revise SOP.3065 in accordance with the December 8, \n2010 Settlement Order was one of the failures for which Plaintiffs requested \nsanctions in June, 2011. ECF Nos. 271, 272. As part of the Cityโs last minute bid to \navoid sanctions, the City finally revised SOP.3065 on December 8, 2011, just a \nweek before the scheduled sanctions hearing, to include the following language: \nOfficers may detain an individual only when they have reasonable \narticulable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal \nactivity. If, following the stop, the officer reasonable believes that the \n  4 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 5 of 25\nperson is both armed and presently dangerous, they may frisk for \nweapons. \n \nAPD.SOP 3065, signed 12/8/11, Section 4.1.1., Exhibit A.  \nThe inclusion of this language rendered SOP.3065 constitutional, and \nPlaintiffs informed the Court that โDefendant City of Atlanta promulgated \nrevisions to the Atlanta Police Departments Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOPs) in accordance with specific requests made by the Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that Defendant City of Atlanta is now in compliance.โ ECF No. 279, \np.1. \nPlaintiffs have just recently learned that, after revising the SOP in 2011 to \navoid sanctions, in 2013 the City removed the language it had added.  In other \nwords, although this Court โORDERED the City to implement the terms of \nโฆโReforms of the Atlanta Police Department,โ which specifically included the \nโpermanentโ revision of SOP.3065 on December 15, 2011(ECF No. 280) the City \nun-revised SOP.3065 in 2013 without notice to the Court or Plaintiffs. As a result, \nthe SOP in place today is once again identical to the unconstitutional SOP that \nwas in place at the time of the Atlanta Eagle Raid. (Compare APD.SOP 3065, \nSigned 5/6/13, Section 4.1.1., Exhibit B  with APD.SOP 3065, Signed 9/29/05, \nSection 4.1.1., Exhibit C ) \n  5 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 6 of 25\nIt is hard to imagine a more flagrant example of bad faith, or a more \nshocking example of a cityโs disrespect for its own agreements and the authority \nof a federal court, than a city that waits until the Court and opposing party are \nno longer paying attention and deliberately undoes something it did to avoid \nsanctions, in violation of an order of the Court. \n  As a result of the Cityโ unauthorized change, the version of SOP.3065 that \nis currently in effect incorporates blatantly unconstitutional instructions to \nAtlanta police officers. The SOP instructs officers to โto contact, identify, and \ndocument encounters with suspicious persons and vehiclesโ in order to โremove \nthe anonymity of potential criminals, thereby reducing suppressible crimes.โ \nSOP.3065, Sections 1, 2. But since 1967 it has been unlawful for police officers to \ndetain โsuspiciousโ persons or โpotential criminalsโ โ whatever those terms may \nmean โ without the specific requirement set forth by the Supreme Court: \nreasonable articulable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal \nactivity.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1967). Under Terry and its progeny officers are \nsimply not allowed to intrude on the liberty of โpotential criminalsโ without \nsatisfying this very specific requirement.1  \n                                          \n1 And there is no question that this SOP instructs officers to detain individuals -- \ncommonly known as a โTerry Stopโ -- rather than engage in a consensual citizen \n \n  6 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 7 of 25\nThe SOP further instructs officers to โobtain the person's name, date of \nbirth, address, and identification.โ SOP.3065, Exhibit B, Sections 4.2.1. But since \nBrown v. Texas officers have been prohibited from demanding the name or \nidentification documents of any individual without reasonable articulable \nsuspicion to believe the individual is engaging or has engaged in criminal \nconduct. Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47 (1979). \nPerhaps most bizarrely, the SOP instructs officers that โAfter stopping a \nperson and the officer finds that he or she has a legitimate reason for being at the \nlocation and the officer's suspicions have been satisfiedโฆ officers will tactfully \nalter the encounter into a less formal citizen contact and not detain the person \nany longer than necessary.โ SOP.3065, Exhibit B, Sections 4.3.4. But contrary to \nthe suggestion in this SOP, officers cannot โalterโ a Terry Stop into a consensual \nโcitizen contactโ after the fact; once a Terry Stop has occurred, it has occurred, \nand if the officer did not have reasonable articulable suspicion before detaining \nthe individual the stop is unlawful and the officer is personally liable for civil \ndamages and even potential criminal liability.  \n                                                                                                                                      \ncontact, because the SOP specifically refers to โstopping a person.โ SOP.3065, \nExhibit B, Sections 4.3.4. \n  7 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 8 of 25\nIt is hard to imagine a more flagrant example of a cityโs disrespect for the \nConstitution, or for the rulings of the Supreme Court, than a city that deliberately \nremoves from its police โstop and friskโ regulation the requirement, imposed by \nthe Supreme Court, that police officers may stop an individual and demand \nidentification only with reasonable articulable suspicion that the individual is \ninvolved in criminal activity. \nIt is also shocking that the City would expose its police officers to civil and \neven criminal liability by instructing them to do something that is clearly \nunlawful.  \nThe very essence of this case was the City of Atlantaโs disregard for the \nlaw generally and for the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of the Supreme \nCourt in particular, and it is hard to imagine a clearer example of the Cityโs \ncontinued intention to disregard the law than its deliberate removal of a \nโpermanentโ revision ordered by the Court to remedy an unconstitutional \noperating procedure. \n2.   Identification Requirement for APD Officers (Section 2 of the Courtโs \nOrder) \n \nSection 2 of the Order requires โall Atlanta police officers who are in \nuniform, other than a rain slicker or traffic direction vest, to wear a \nconspicuously visible nametag.โ \n  8 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 9 of 25\nDuring the โFerguson protestsโ in Atlanta in December, 2014, it became \nobvious from press photographs and news reports that many Atlanta police \nofficers were not wearing a nametag as required.2 The City itself has admitted \nthat some Atlanta police officers โassigned to the Ferguson detail did not have \nconspicuous name identification on the riot gear they donned over their regular \nuniforms.โ Email from Karen Thomas to Daniel Grossman, Dec. 10, 2014, Exhibit \nD.  \nPlaintiffs do not yet have sufficient information to know how widespread \nthis problem may have been or whether or not Atlanta police officers have failed \nto wear nametags on other occasions, and therefore Plaintiffs do not know if this \nproblem merits sanctions or merely remedial measures. Plaintiffs firmly believe \nthe identification requirement of this Order is a crucial element of accountability, \nsince a citizen cannot complain or seek redress against a police officer he cannot \nidentify, but it is not possible for Plaintiffs to know if this issue is a widespread \nproblem or an aberration without conducting additional discovery. \n                                          \n2 Jim Burress, Does the Arrest of a Journalist During Atlantaโs Ferguson Rally Point to \nBigger Problems?, WABE 90.1 FM, Dec. 8, 2014, http://wabe.org/post/does-\narrest-journalist-during-atlantas-ferguson-rally-point-bigger-problems \n \n  9 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 10 of 25\n3.  Documentation of Warrantless Seizures and ID Checks (Sections 4 \nand 5 of the Courtโs Order) \n \nSections 4 and 5 of the Order require Atlanta police officers to document \nspecific information in connection with certain types of warrantless seizures and \nID checks. With regard to such seizures, officers are required to โfill out a written \nor electronic form before the end of his or her shiftโ recording the following \ninformation:  \nโข  the specific crime(s) of which the individual was \nsuspected; \n \nโข  the specific facts giving rise to reasonable articulable \nsuspicion regarding that crime;  \n \nโข  whether the individual was frisked for weapons, and if so \nthe specific facts giving rise to reasonable articulable \nsuspicion that he was both armed AND dangerous; \n \nโข  whether the individual was searched for anything other \nthan weapons, and if so giving the specific facts giving rise \nboth to probable cause and exigent circumstances; and \n \nโข  the specific authority for the ID check (whether by consent \nor pursuant to a Terry stop or arrest) \n \nOn December 8, 2014, Plaintiffs asked the City to provide โcopies of all the \nforms completed by APD officers in compliance with the โDocumentation of \nWarrantless Seizuresโ and โDocumentation of ID Checksโ required by the court \norder in Calhoun v. Pennington.โ Email from Daniel Grossman to Robert \n  10 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 11 of 25\nGodfrey, Dec. 8, 2014, Exhibit E. In response the City produced several hundred \ndocuments that it claimed were these forms.3 But not a single one of the \ndocuments produced by the City includes the information required to be \nrecorded by police. Indeed, it appears that the City has not even developed a \nusable โwritten or electronic formโ for officers to record this information if they \nwant to. The โformโ provided by the City is the pre-existing โDemographicsโ \nsection of the standard APD Incident Report, which does not even have the \nappropriate questions or check boxes for officers to supply the required \ninformation. The Cityโs failure even to develop an appropriate form, as required \nby the Order, means the City has not made it possible for conscientious officers \nwho want to comply with the Order to do so. \n4.  Training (Section 6 of the Courtโs Order) \nSection 6 of the Order requires the City to โconduct mandatory, in-person \ntraining for all sworn employees of the Atlanta Police Departmentโ regarding \nโthe changes contained in this agreementโ and โthe law regarding detentions, \narrests, frisks, and searches generallyโ and to provide โrecurring training on \n                                          \n3 Letter from Deputy City Attorney Karen Thomas to Daniel Grossman, Jan. 15, \n2015, para. 4, Exhibit F. Plaintiffs are attaching a few examples of the forms \nproduced by the City. Exhibit G. Plaintiffs will file all documents produced by \nthe City at the Courtโs request. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 12 of 25\nthese topics โฆ to each sworn officer every two years.โ While the City eventually \nprovided the initial training, after Plaintiffs filed their 2011 motion for sanctions, \nit is now apparent that the City has not provided the recurrent training as \nrequired.  \nIn December, 2014, when Plaintiffs became aware of this problem, they \nasked the City if the recurrent training had been accomplished. Letter from \nDaniel Grossman to Cathy Hampton, Dec. 5, 2014, Exhibit H. In response the \nCity provided documents that, the City claimed, demonstrate compliance with \nthis training requirement. Email from Karen Thomas to Daniel Grossman, Dec. \n10, 2015, Exhibit D. But these documents do not show compliance and actually \nsuggest the lack of it.  Therefore, on January 27, 2015, Plaintiffsโ counsel Daniel \nGrossman wrote to Karen Thomas of the Cityโs Law Department and asked: \nPlease confirm that these documents, and those you provided by \nemail on December 10, 2014, represent all information reflecting the \ncityโs attempt to comply with the court orders in these three cases. If \nthere is any additional information we should also take into account, \nplease provide it without delay. \nLetter of Daniel Grossman to Karen Thomas, Jan. 27, 2015, Exhibit I.  \n \nThe City never responded to this inquiry. The only information provided \nby the City, therefore, indicates that the City has not conducted the recurrent \ntraining required by the Order, as discussed in detail below. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 13 of 25\nThe Cityโs failure to train police officers as required by various court \norders, including the one in this case, is viewed as such a serious problem by \npolice officers themselves that Atlantaโs police union, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers Local 623 (the โPolice Unionโ), has addressed a \nletter to this Court and other courts that have issued similar orders. The letter \nstates that โadequate training on these issues appears to have fallen short of the \nintended outcomeโ and that there is a โdisconnectโ between the training \nrequired by these orders and โwhat actual training has been given.โ Letter of \nKen Allen, President of IBPO Local 623, Mar. 13, 2015, Exhibit J. \na.  Training regarding search and seizure  \nAmong the documents provided by the City to show compliance was a \ntraining roster of officers who attended โAgency Training for Course INA00Gโ \non specific dates during 2013. Exhibit K. The City provided no material to \nindicate the contents of โCourse INA00G.โ The City did provide Plaintiffs with \ncopies of two lesson plans (a โSearch and Seizure refresherโ that was \nโPrepared/Completed/Taughtโ on March 13, 2013, and a โUse of Forceโ lesson \nโPrepared/Completed/Taughtโ on April 9, 2013; Exhibits L and M) but there is \nno indication that these lesson plans were included in โCourse INA00G,โ and \nindeed they could not have been: The training roster shows that many Atlanta \npolice officers attended โCourse INA00Gโ in February and early March, 2013, \n  13 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 14 of 25\nand those officers could not have been trained from lesson plans that did not \nexist until mid-March and early April, 2013. \nIt is possible, naturally, that โCourse INA00Gโ included earlier versions of \nsimilar training, and it is equally possible that โCourse INA00Gโ had nothing to \ndo with these subjects at all; there is no way for Plaintiffs to determine that from \nthe information provided by the City, so Plaintiffs will need conduct discovery to \ndetermine what recurrent search and seizure training, if any, was actually \nprovided to Atlanta police officers. \nb.  Training regarding the changes contained in the Settlement \nAgreement \n  The City provided no documents whatsoever to indicate that officers \nreceived the recurrent training required by the Order about โthe changes \ncontained in [the Settlement Agreement].โ For example, the City provided no \ndocuments to suggest that officers received any recurrent training about Section \n3 of the Order (prohibiting โInterference with Audio or Video Recordingsโ) \nbefore December, 2014, when Plaintiffs informed the City about their concerns \nregarding non-compliance.  \nSimilarly, in response to Plaintiffsโ request for all information and \ndocuments demonstrating compliance with the Order, the City provided no \ninformation to suggest that officers have ever received recurrent training about \n  14 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 15 of 25\nSection 2 of the Order (concerning โIdentification Requirement for APD \nOfficersโ), Section 4 of the Order (โDocumentation of Warrantless Seizuresโ), or \nSection 5 of the Order (โDocumentation of ID Checksโ). \n5.  Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints (Section 7 of the Courtโs \nOrder) \n \nSection 7 of the Order requires the Atlanta Police Department to \nโinvestigate and finally adjudicate all citizen complaints of police misconduct of \nany kind within 180 days of the complaint.โ In response to Plaintiffsโ request for \ninformation regarding compliance with this Order, the City provided nothing at \nall to demonstrate compliance with this section of the Order, and Plaintiffs have \nreceived anecdotal information indicating that the City is in violation of this \nrequirement. Plaintiffs will propound a discovery request requiring the City to \ndisclose, with regard to each citizen complaint of police misconduct since the \ndate of the order, the following information:  \na)  the date the complaint was made; \n \nb) the name of the complainant and file number assigned to the \ncomplaint; \n \nc)  the name of the officer against whom the complaint was made; \n \nd) the law, rule, or SOP the officer was alleged to have violated; \n \ne)  the date the complaint was finally adjudicated;  \n \n  15 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 16 of 25\nf)  and the disposition of the complaint (i.e., whether the complaint was \nsustained, not sustained, unfounded, or exonerated).  \n \nIV.  EVEN ATLANTAโS POLICE OFFICERS AGREE: THE CITY MUST \nBE MADE TO OBEY THIS ORDER \nEven Atlantaโs police officers agree that the City should be made to \nprovide training as required by court orders. In its letter to this Court and others \nthe Police Union set forth its concern that training deficiencies can lead to \nmisconduct by even well-intentioned officers: \nIBPO Local 623 fundamentally believes that the CITY of ATLANTA \nshould  adhere  to  and  follow  any  COURT  ORDERED  training  to \nensure that the Rank-and-File of the Atlanta Police Department meet \nand/or exceed the courts expected standards. Any shortcoming in \nthese expectations increases the risk of disciplinary actions towards \nthe officers, and further creates the possibility of criminal and/or \ncivil liabilities. \nIBPO  Local  623  Leadership  agrees  that  these  particular  topics  of \ncourt-ordered  training  are  of  the  utmost  importance  and  ALL \nstandards  must  be  met  and  maintained,  to  prevent  conflicts  of \ninterest and future liabilities. \nAllen Letter , Exhibit J. \n  Plaintiffs fully agree with the Police Unionโs concern: The Cityโs failure to \ntrain officers as required by these orders is fundamentally unfair to the police \nofficers of Atlanta. It is the Cityโs obligation to train its police officers and it is \nunreasonable for any City to send its officers out to do their jobs without \nadequate (and in this case, court ordered) training about search and seizure and \n  16 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 17 of 25\nother important topics, since individual officers themselves face civil and \ncriminal liability -- as well as discipline or dismissal by the City -- if they are not \naware of these laws. Police officers have a right to expect thorough and adequate \ntraining, but the City seems unwilling to train its officers appropriately, even in \nthe opinion of the officers themselves. This Court has the power โ at least with \nregard to the training required by the Order in this case โ to impose effective \nsanctions to coerce and compel such training. \nV.  DISCOVERY \n  Because it is not possible to determine the full measure of the Cityโs \nnon-compliance without conducting discovery, Plaintiffs will conduct discovery \ntoward that end. The scope of discovery in civil matters is governed by Rule \n26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides that โParties \nmay obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any \npartyโs claim or defense โฆ.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). See Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. \nSanders, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978).  The Eleventh Circuit, for example, has found \nthat Rule 26(b)(1) allows a party to conduct discovery for the purpose of \nenforcing a judgment.  Natโl Service Industries, Inc. v. Vafla Corp., 694 F.2d 246, 250 \n(11th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted).  See also Cheeves v. Southern Clays, Inc., 797 F. \nSupp. 1570, 1580 (M.D. Ga. 1992) (โDiscovery under the rules is โฆ available with \nrespect to a wide variety of collateral or ancillary issuesโ) (citations omitted).   \n  17 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 18 of 25\n  Having established that the City is not in compliance with at least certain \naspects of this Courtโs order, Plaintiffs are entitled to discover information \nconcerning the full extent of the Cityโs non-compliance.  Such information will, at \nthe very least, have a bearing on the nature and type of sanctions that Plaintiffs \nwill ask this Court to impose against the City for its contumacious behavior.  See \nUnited States v. United Mine Workers of America, 33 U.S. 258, 304 (1947) (in \nimposing coercive sanctions, court should โconsider the character and \nmagnitude of the harm threatened by continued contumacy, and the probable \neffectiveness of any suggested sanction in bringing about the result desiredโ); \nMercer v. Mitchell, 908 F.2d 763, 769 n.10 (11th Cir. 1990) (contempt sanctions are \nappropriate where โprior conductโ of offending party โindicates that it will not \ncontinue to comply with the courtโs [order]โ).  \nVI.  SANCTIONS  \n \nAfter determining the extent of the Cityโs non-compliance through \ndiscovery Plaintiffs will request such sanctions as seem appropriate and \nnecessary in light of the facts. Plaintiffs will certainly ask the Court to fashion a \nremedy that includes reporting or monitoring to encourage future compliance \nwith the Order of this Court. The City has an established track record of \ncomplying with court orders only when pressed to do so. It took a full year for \nthe City to comply with the December 8, 2010 Settlement Order in this case, and \n  18 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 19 of 25\nthen only because the City faced the threat of sanctions, and as soon as the City \nbelieved the Court and Plaintiffs were no longer paying attention it reversed a \nโpermanentโ SOP change that it had promulgated to avoid sanctions. And \ndespite having paid $25,000.00 of taxpayer money in December, 2011, as attorney \nfees for its initial non-compliance, the City again did nothing to meet its \ncontinuing compliance obligations during the following three years. \nThe Cityโs track record of complying with court orders in similar cases is \nequally dismal. In Anderson v. City of Atlanta, No. 11-CV-3398-SCJ, the Hon. Steve \nC. Jones issued an Order on March 22, 2012, requiring the City to amend a \nparticular SOP to prohibit destruction of photo and video evidence. Exhibit N. \nThe City did not make the required revision until December 18, 2014, two and a \nhalf years later, and then only after the plaintiff in that case expressed concerns \nabout the Cityโs failure to comply with the order.4 The Cityโs failure to comply \nwith the order in Anderson is detailed fully in the Motion for Sanctions that the \nplaintiff in Anderson recently filed against the City, attached hereto as Exhibit O.   \nSimilarly, in Walker v. Reed, No 1:11-CV-3334-CAP, the Hon. Charles A. \nPannell, Jr. issued an Order on March 20, 2012, requiring the City โto conduct \n                                          \n4 Counsel for the plaintiff in Anderson include two of the attorneys who represent \nPlaintiffs here, Gerald Weber and Daniel Grossman. \n  19 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 20 of 25\nmandatory in-person training of all Atlanta police officers every two yearsโ \nregarding the unlawfulness of strip searching suspects in public. Exhibit P. Yet \naccording to the documents provided by the City and referenced in Exhibits D \nand F, the City apparently made no attempt whatsoever to comply with that \norder until December, 2014, again two and a half years later, and again only after \nthe plaintiffs in that case expressed concerns about the Cityโs failure to comply \nwith the order.5 \nGiven the Cityโs track record, at a minimum it seems necessary to impose \non the City the affirmative duty to report to Plaintiffs regarding future \ncompliance. For example, since the City โun-revisedโ a permanent SOP without \nany notice to Plaintiffs, it would seem appropriate to impose an affirmative duty \non the City to advise Plaintiffs of any future revisions to the SOPs covered by the \nOrder in this case. And since the City failed to provide required training, it \nwould seem appropriate to impose an affirmative duty on the City to advise \nPlaintiffs in advance of scheduled training sessions and to allow Plaintiffs to \nattend and video the training sessions to verify compliance. \n \n                                          \n5 Counsel for the plaintiffs in Walker include one of the attorneys who represent \nPlaintiffs here, Daniel Grossman. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 21 of 25\nA.  Monetary or Coercive Sanctions and Attorney Fees \nIt is premature for Plaintiffs to suggest monetary or coercive sanctions \nbefore conducting discovery to determine the extent of the Cityโs non-\ncompliance, but some form of sanctions will likely be appropriate depending on \nthe information obtained during discovery, and Plaintiffs are entitled to recover \nattorney fees in connection with this motion.  \nThe only defense available in a contempt action requires proof that the \ndefendant โeither โฆ did not violate the court order or that he was excused from \ncomplying.โ  Id. (citation omitted). Efforts to comply with a court order must be \ndone with โreasonable diligenceโ in order for it to be considered a defense to \ncontempt.  At a bare minimum, โreasonable diligenceโ means that the offending \nparty must โbecome aware of [its non-compliant behavior] quickly โ through its \nown efforts, not those of [the complainant] โ and to set about correcting them.โ  \nSizzler Fam. Steak Houses v. Western Sizzlin Steak, 793 F.2d 1529, 1537 (11th Cir. \n1986).   \n  It is well-established that โ[c]ourts have inherent power to enforce \ncompliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt.โ  Citronelle-Mobile \nGathering, Inc. v. Watkins, 943, F.2d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing Shillitani v. \nUnited States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966)). Once the court finds a party in contempt it \nis vested with โwide discretion in fashioning an equitable remedy for civil \n  21 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 22 of 25\ncontempt.โ  McGregor v. Chierico, 206 F.3d 1378, 1385 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation \nomitted). Such sanctions may be imposed to achieve โeither or both of two \npurposes: to coerce the defendant into compliance with the courtโs order, and to \ncompensate the complainant for losses sustained.โ  Local 28 of the Sheet Metal \nWorkersโ Intโl Assoc. v.

But the goal of both forms of sanctions, is, in essence, \nthe same: to โvindicat[e] the authority of the court.โ  Chandler v. James, 180 F.3d \n1254, 1268 (11th Cir. 1999) (Tjoflat, J., specially concurring) (citation omitted).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit has found appropriate sanctions in the form of โa coercive \ndaily fine โฆ attorneysโ fees and expenses โฆ and coercive incarceration.โ Watkins, \n943, F.2d at 1304 (citations omitted).    \nVII.  CONCLUSION \n  It is disheartening and depressing that the City of Atlanta does not want to \nprovide its police officers with adequate training and constitutional SOPs \nvoluntarily, simply as a matter of good government. But it is shocking that the \nCity will not do so even when ordered by multiple federal courts. It is in the \ninterest of both the residents and the police officers of Atlanta for the City to \nprovide officers with appropriate guidance and training, and Plaintiffs hope this \nCourt will ultimately fashion a remedy that is sufficiently persuasive to make \nthese continuing problems a thing of the past. \n  22 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 281   Filed 03/17/15   Page 23 of 25\nRespectfully submitted this 17th day of March, 2015. \n         \n/s/ Daniel J.

File No.: \n1 :09-CV-3286-TCB \nRICHARD PENNINGTON, Chief \nof Police for the City of Atlanta, in \nhis official and individual capacities, \net al. \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR ENTRY OF \nCONSENT ORDER AND FOR SANCTIONS \nINTRODUCTION \nEarlier today, Defendant City of Atlanta (\"the City\") wrote to the Court \"to \nrequest the Court's assistance in evaluating the City's compliance with the \nSettlement Agreement and Order.\" To assist the Court in evaluating this matter, \nPlaintiffs respectfully submit the following discussion of the relevant issues \nregarding compliance with the settlement agreement. \n75210161.3 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 2 of 18\nBecause Plaintiffs believe that the City has failed to fully implement actions \nrequired by the settlement agreement within 180 days (i.e., before June 6, 2011), \nPlaintiffs therefore move for entry of a consent order as previously agreed to by the \nCity, requiring Defendant City of Atlanta to implement all the actions set forth in \nExhibit A to the Settlement Order. \nPlaintiffs also respectfully move the Court to sanction Defendant City of \nAtlanta and/or its counsel for falsely advising the Court in the \"Status Report\" filed \non June 6, 2010 that \"the City of Atlanta is in full compliance with the terms of \nExhibit A.\" (Status Report, ECF No. 270, p. 1.) \nI. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT \nOn December 8, 2010, the parties concluded a settlement of the above-styled \naction under which Defendant City of Atlanta agreed to take certain actions \ndescribed in Exhibit A (\"Reforms of the Atlanta Police Department\") to this \nCourt's Order of December 8, 2010 (the \"Settlement Order\"). (ECF Nos. 265, \n265-1, Dec. 8, 2010.) \nOf the eight actions required by Exhibit A to the Settlement Order, six of the \nrequirements took effect immediately upon entry of the Settlement Order; one was \nto be completed \"as soon as practicable\" after the date of the December 8, 2010 \nOrder 6, \"Training,\" Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265-1); and one had a \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  2 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 3 of 18\nspecific deadline of 180 days, which was later extended to June 27, 2011 by \nconsent of the parties (lt 8, \"Investigation of Officer Conduct,\" Reforms of the \nAPD, ECF No. 265-1; Motion to Amend, ECF No. 266; Consent Order, ECF No. \n269.) In addition, and as a self-executing enforcement provision, Defendant City \nof Atlanta agreed \"to the entry of a consent order requiring Defendant City of \nAtlanta to implement the actions set forth in the Exhibit A if these actions have not \nbeen not fully implemented  within one hundred eighty (180) days of the entry of \nthis Order.\" (Settlement Order, ECF No. 265, pp. 3-4.) (Emphasis added.) \nII. THE CITY'S FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIRED ACTIONS \nThe Settlement Order entered on December 8, 2010 required the City of \nAtlanta to implement certain specific reforms, many of which require the adoption, \nrevocation, or revision of APD Standard Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\"). The \nCity has not implemented most of these required changes.' Most egregiously, even \nthe specific SOPs that were identified as unconstitutional in the Settlement Order \nhave still not been changed as required by the terms of the settlement. \nIn an attempt to demonstrate its alleged compliance with the Settlement Order, \nDefendant City of Atlanta provided Plaintiffs' counsel with a computer disc on \nJune 8, 2011, containing the SOPs revised by the APD. The revised SOPs attached \nas exhibits to this motion are from the disc provided by the City. \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  3 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 4 of 18\n1. (cid:9) \"Revocation or Amendment of Unconstitutional Policies\" \n(Paragraph 1 of the Reforms) \nDefendant City of Atlanta agreed that certain specific SOPs were \nunconstitutional and needed to be revoked or amended (including SOP 3020 ยง \n4.3.1(2), SOP 3030, and SOP 3065), but these SOPs have still not been changed to \ncomply with the settlement. Nor, it seems, has the City done anything to remedy \nthe APD's unconstitutional practice of detaining and performing ID checks on all \npersons in a specific location without regard to individual suspicion, although the \nsettlement agreement clearly articulated the constitutional standards for searches \nand seizures.2  (Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265-1, pp. 2-3.) \n The settlement agreement summarized the constitutional standards for,  inter alia, \n2 \nreasonable articulable suspicion, demands for identification, frisks, warrantless \narrests, probable cause, searches of the person, the \"plain feel exception,\" and \nentrance, searches or arrests in the home, as articulated in  Illinois v. Warlaw,  528 \nU.S. 119 (2000); Brown v. Texas,  443 U.S. 47 (1979);  United States v. Sharpe, 470 \nU.S. 675, 682 (1985); Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist.

Tobin,  923 F.2d 1506, 1510 (11th Cir. 1991).) \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  4 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 5 of 18\na. SOP 3020 (Searches) \nThe City specifically agreed to revoke or amend SOP 3020 ยง 4.3.1(2), which \npurports to authorize warrantless searches without requiring (or even mentioning) \nprobable cause. (Reforms of the APD, ECF 265-1,  ยถ 1.)  Yet the \"revised\" SOP is \nnearly identical to the \"old\" SOP that the City was required to amend: \n\"Old\" SOP: \n4.3.1 \n2. To justify a warrantless search, two essential elements must exist: \na.  It must be established that the circumstances at the time of the \nsearch were sufficient to require immediate action, which \nnecessitated not complying with the restrictions of the warrant \nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment. \nb.  The manner and scope of the search that was conducted must be \nreasonably related to the justification of the search. \n(SOP 3020, effective April 1, 2007, Exhibit 1.) \n\"New\" SOP: \n4.3.1 \n2. To justify a warrantless search, two essential elements must exist: \na. It must be established that the exigent circumstances at the time of \nthe search were sufficient to require immediate action, which \nnecessitated not complying with the restrictions of the warrant \nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment. \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  5 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 6 of 18\nb. The manner and scope of the search that was conducted must be \nreasonably related to the justification of the search. \n(SOP 3020, dated June 1, 2011, Exhibit 2.) \nAs a result of this failure to comply with the settlement agreement the \nAPD's Standard Operating Procedure regarding warrantless searches still fails to \ninform police officers that probable cause is a necessary and required element of a \nlawful search.  (See Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265-1, ยถ 1(f).) \nb.  SOP 3030 (Arrests) \nThe City agreed to amend SOP 3030 regarding arrests. (Reforms of APD, \nECF No. 265-1, ยถ 1.)  Yet the newly revised SOP still fails to instruct officers \nthat it is unconstitutional to arrest a suspect inside his home without a warrant or \nexigent circumstances, as happened to Plaintiff David Shepherd during the \"Eagle \nRaid.\"  See \"old\" SOP (Exhibit 3) and \"new\" SOPs (Exhibit 4). \nc.  SOP 3065 (\"Field Interviews\") \nThe City agreed to amend or revoke SOP 3065, which purports to authorize \ninvestigatory detentions, ID checks, and frisks without reasonable articulable \nsuspicion. (Reforms of APD, ECF No. 265-1,  ยถ  1; SOP 3065, Exhibit 5.) This \nunconstitutional SOP, however, is still in effect.  See Exhibit 5. \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  6 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 7 of 18\nSOP 3065 authorizes and instructs Atlanta police officers to detain, frisk \n(\"from the rear with the suspect in a kneeling position\"), and perform ID checks on \n\"suspicious persons\" in order to \"remove the anonymity of potential criminals.\" \n(Exhibit 5, ยงยง 1, 2.) The words \"reasonable suspicion\" or \"reasonable articulable \nsuspicion\" do not appear anywhere in this SOP, nor are police officers instructed \nthat they may lawfully detain only persons whom they reasonably believe are \ninvolved in criminal activity. To the contrary, this SOP encourages officers to \ndetain and question \"potential criminals\" who do not seem to belong in a particular \nplace.3  The May 24, 2011 Memorandum to Chief Turner recommending \n\"Mandated Eagle Reform of Departmental SOPs\" fails to mention SOP 3065 at all. \n(Exhibit 6.) This SOP remains in force and unchanged, despite the City's \nagreement to revoke or amend it. \n The SOP attempts to shift the burden to the detained individual to present a \n3 \n\"legitimate reason\" for his presence at the location: Officers are instructed to \n\"inquire as to what the person was doing and why he or she was observed at a \nparticular location.\" (Exhibit 5, ยง 4.2.1.) The SOP also suggests that when an \nofficer unlawfully stops a person without reasonable suspicion, the officer can \nsomehow convert an unlawful \"second tier\" detention into a voluntary \"first tier\" \ncitizen encounter after the fact: \"After stopping a person and the officer finds that \nhe or she has a legitimate reason for being at the location and the officer's \nsuspicions have been satisfied, the officer will de-escalate the situation by \ncourteously explaining what prompted the stop. Officers will tactfully alter the \nencounter into a less formal citizen contact and not detain the person any longer \nthan necessary.\" (Exhibit 5, ยง 4.3.4.) \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  7 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 8 of 18\nd. APD's Unlawful Custom and Practice to Detain and ID Check \nAll Persons at the Location of a Police Action \nThe Plaintiffs in this action obtained evidence of an unlawful APD custom \nand practice to detain all persons in a given location and perform ID checks \nwithout regard to individualized suspicion, the exercise of which formed the basis \nof this case. The commander of the APD section that conducted the Atlanta Eagle \nRaid, Major Debra Williams, stated: \"Once we're inside a location based on any \nillegal activity, for the safety of not only the citizens of the city of Atlanta but for \nthe safety of the patrons and the officers, we conduct warrant checks on all the \npatrons, on everyone.\" ProjectQAtlanta, Public Forum About Atlanta Eagle Raid, \nYouTuBE, at 0:49 (Dec. 8, 2010), \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPz4e5uJWAo;  also available at \nhttp://www.AtlantaEagleRaid.com. Deputy Police Chief Carlos Banda stated that \nit was APD policy to \"do criminal history checks on everybody when we hit an \nestablishment, no matter what it is....At this point, that's the policy.\"  Id., at 0:13. \nNowhere in the documents produced by the City is there any mention of any \nSOP revision, Command Memorandum, training material, or anything else to \nindicate that the APD has remedied this unconstitutional practice or instructed \nofficers that it is unconstitutional to detain and search individuals simply because \nthey are at a given location, without regard to individualized reasonable suspicion. \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  8 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 9 of 18\n(Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265-1, ยถ1(a) (stating, \"Police officers may not \nlawfully detain any individual without reasonable articulable suspicion, \nparticularized to the person being detained...\").) 4  The City's failure to revoke this \npolicy or countermand this practice is a significant breach of the settlement \nagreement. \n2. (cid:9) \"Identification Requirement for APD Officers\" (Paragraph 2 of \nthe Reforms) \nDefendant City of Atlanta agreed, as of the December 8, 2010 Settlement \nOrder, to require all Atlanta police officers to identify themselves \"upon request at \nsome point before the end of an encounter with a civilian.\" The SOP regarding \nofficer identification was revised by the APD, but the revision materially fails to \ncomply with the terms of the settlement agreement. \nThe provision of the settlement agreement concerning officer identification \nwas intended to remedy a \"loophole\" in the officer identification SOP in effect at \nthe time of the Eagle Raid, which allowed Atlanta police officers to refuse to \nidentify themselves if they felt it would \"compromise their safety or the safety of \nothers due to the nature of their assignment or the task.\" (Exhibit 7, APD SOP \n4  Even the newly added SOP paragraphs regarding identity checks (e.g. SOP 3020 \nยง 4.3.13) fail to instruct officers that they may not lawfully detain or check the \nidentification of persons simply because they are at the scene of a police action. \n(cid:9)\n75210161 3  9 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 10 of 18\n2010, effective December 10, 2007, ยง 4.2.23.)5  To close this loophole, Paragraph 2 \nof the settlement agreement requires that \"any Atlanta police officer who is in \nuniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of police authority (such as a \npolice vest, etc.), to identify herself or himself by name and badge number upon \nrequest at some point before the end of an encounter with a civilian.\" (Reforms of \nthe APD, ECF No. 265-1, ยถ 2.) In other words, whenever an officer holds himself \nout to the public as a police officer (as opposed to working in a covert or \nundercover capacity) he is required, without exception, to identify himself or \nherself upon request. \nRather than amend the officer identification SOP pursuant to the terms of the \nSettlement Order, however, the City \"revised\" the SOP to incorporate the very \nsame wording loophole that the City agreed to abandon as part of the settlement of \nthis action.6  (Exhibit 8, APD SOP 2010, ยง 4.2.23, Effective June 1, 2011; see also, \n5 4.2.23 Giving Identification \nEmployees will identify themselves by name and assignment upon request while \non duty or performing their official duties unless doing so would compromise their \nsafety or the safety of others due to the nature of their assignment or the task. \n(Exhibit 8.) \n The \"revised\" SOP, containing the same language as the previous SOP, states: \n6 \n4.2.23 Giving Identification \n1. Employees shall identify themselves by name, badge number, \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  10 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 11 of 18\nExhibit 6, Memorandum From Lt. Henrietta Smith to Chief George N. Turner, \nMay 24, 2011, p. 1.) \n3.  \"No Interference with Audio or Video Recordings\" (Paragraph 3 of \nthe reforms) \nThe City of Atlanta has complied with this provision of the Settlement \nOrder. \n4. \"Documentation of Warrantless Seizures\" and \"Documentation of ID \nChecks\" (Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Reforms) \nAs of the date of the December 8, 2010 settlement, the City of Atlanta \nagreed to require officers performing certain types of warrantless searches and \ncertain types of ID checks to \"to fill out a written or electronic form before the end \nof his or her shift\" documenting certain information. (Reforms of the APD, ECF \nNo. 265-1, ยถ 4, 5; \"The City of Atlanta shall require...\") When Plaintiffs requested \ncopies of any completed forms, the City of Atlanta admitted that \"no such \nassignment and department issued identification card upon request \nwhile on duty or performing their official duties unless doing so would \ncompromise their safety or the safety of others due to the nature of their \nassignment or the task. \n2. Sworn employees at the rank of Investigator or above shall \nprovide, upon Request, the badge number that was initially assigned to \nthem at the rank of Officer. \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  11 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 12 of 18\ndocuments exist.\" (Exhibit 9, June 8, 2011 letter from Defendant's counsel Robert \nGodfrey to Plaintiffs' counsel Daniel Grossman, p.1.) \nThe City explained that \"the implementation of the use of the forms in the \nfield will follow the training as it is impracticable to have the officers begin to \nutilize the forms properly without the formal training required by the Order.\"  Id. at \n2. In other words, the City, without justification, delayed compliance with \nParagraphs 4 and 5 of the Reforms until the completion of the training required by \nParagraph 6. Nowhere in Exhibit A to the Settlement Order, however, did the City \nreserve the right to delay the implementation of these provisions. Moreover, while \nPlaintiffs understand that instruction is required before officers can begin using \nthese forms, there is no reason this instruction needed to be delayed until \ncompletion of the full program of comprehensive training required by Paragraph 6. \nRather, officers could have been instructed in the proper use of these simple forms \nat any point during the past six months (for example, during the \"roll call training\" \nthat is provided on a regular basis) and the City's intentional failure to document \nwarrantless seizures and ID checks as required by the settlement was a bad faith \nviolation of the terms of the settlement agreement. \n(cid:9)\n75210161 3  12 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 13 of 18\n5. \"Training\" (Paragraph 6 of the Reforms) \nThe City of Atlanta agreed to conduct mandatory, in-person training for all \nsworn officers of the APD \"as soon as practicable\" following the December 8, \n2010 settlement. (Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265-1, ยถ 6.) Rather than conduct \nthis training \"as soon as practicable,\" however, the City did not even approve \nprocurement of a training contract until May 20, 2011, a full 163 days (more than \nfive months) after the date of the Settlement Order. (Exhibit 10, May 20, 2011 \nProcurement Order.) The training is not scheduled to begin until August 22, 2011, \nand according to the calendar produced by the City the training will not be \ncompleted until September 9, 2011โalmost nine months after the date of the \nSettlement Orderโeven assuming the City meets its current schedule. (Exhibit 11, \nProposed Training Schedule.) \nPlaintiffs contend that the City of Atlanta has failed to comply with its \nagreement to conduct training \"as soon as practicable,\" and that as a result of this \nfailure Atlanta police officers may be continuing the same unconstitutional \npractices that gave rise to this litigation. \n6.  \"Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints\" (Paragraph 7 of the \nReforms) \nThe City of Atlanta agreed that \"the Atlanta Police Department shall \ninvestigate and finally adjudicate all citizen complaints of police misconduct of \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  13 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 14 of 18\nany kind within 180 days of the complaint.\" (Reforms of the APD, ECF No. 265- \n1, ยถ 7.) While the plain language of Paragraph 7 imposes a \"hard deadline\" of 180 \ndays to adjudicate citizen complaints of police misconduct, the SOP revisions \nsuggest the APD's intention to disregard this 180-day limit. These revisions \ninclude a procedure to excuse or extend investigations that are not completed \nwithin 180 days: \nSection 4.2.2 Investigative Procedure \n(8) All complaints, regardless of the nature of the complaint, shall be \ninvestigated and adjudicated within one hundred and eighty (180) \ndays of the complaint. In instances whereby an investigation is not \ncompleted within the aforementioned timeframes, a letter outlining \nthe delay, the extension and the new deadline, must be forwarded to \nthe OPS Commander. This documentation will become a part of the \ninvestigative file. \n(Exhibit 12, SOP 2020, effective June 1, 2011.) \nNo procedure for excusing or extending this 180-day deadline is authorized \nunder the settlement negotiated by the parties. \nInformation provided by the APD also seems to indicate that despite the \nterms of the settlement certain complaint files remain open after 180 days. \n(Exhibit 13, Open Records Act Request; Exhibit 14, summary of complaint files \nprovided by City of Atlanta pursuant to Open Records Act (indicating complaints \nopen more than 180 days).) Plaintiffs are unable to determine compliance with this \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  14 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 15 of 18\npart of the agreement, however, because the City failed to provide a complete list \nof all open complaints as Plaintiffs requested. (Exhibit 15, Letter from D. \nGrossman to R. Godfrey, June 6, 2011.) \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that the Court order the City to produce the \ninformation from which compliance or non-compliance can be determined. \n7. \"Investigation of Officer Conduct\" (Paragraph 8 of the Reforms) \nThe parties agreed to extend the deadline for compliance with this \nrequirement until June 27, 2011. (Motion to Amend, ECF No. 266; Consent \nOrder, ECF No. 269.) \nIII. THE CITY OF ATLANTA'S DISHONESTY TO THE COURT \nOn June 6, 2010, the City of Atlanta filed a \"Status Report\" in which the \ncounsel for the City represented to the Court that \"the City of Atlanta is in full \ncompliance with the terms of Exhibit A.\" (Settlement Order, ECF No. 270, at 1.) \nAs set forth above, that statement appears to be knowingly false and dishonest, and \nrepresents a material misrepresentation. The City had not \"fully implement[ed]\" \nthe terms of the settlement when it filed its \"Status Report\" on June 6, 2010: \nunconstitutional SOPs that were required to be revoked or amended still have not \nbeen changed; the documentation of warrantless seizures and ID checks still has \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  15 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 16 of 18\nnot been done; and training that was supposed to be conducted \"as soon as \npracticable\" has not been conducted at all. \nPlaintiffs respectfully move the Court to sanction Defendant and/or its \ncounsel for making this false statement to the Court. Plaintiffs also respectfully \nrequest the Court to consider any other actions that this Court deems advisable to \naddress counsel's breach of their duty of candor to this Court.' \nThe actions of Defendant's counsel also run afoul of Rule 3.3 of the State \nBar of Georgia's Rules of Professional Conduct, which requires that a lawyer show \ncandor to the tribunal. GEORGIA RULES OF PROE'L CONDUCT R. 3.3 (2001). Rule \n3.3 states that \"[a] lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) make a false statement of \nmaterial fact or law to a tribunal.\"  Id. \nThe City's statement that it was \"in full compliance with the terms of \nExhibit A\" was materially false, misleading, and dishonest and an appropriate \nsanction should be imposed to insure the integrity of the judicial process. \n The Status Report purports to be endorsed by all counsel for Defendants, \n7 \nincluding attorneys from the firm of Greenberg Traurig, but the Greenberg Traurig \n(cid:9)\n75210161.3  16 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 271   Filed 06/16/11   Page 17 of 18\nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs move for entry of a consent order \npursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and move the Court to sanction \nDefendant and/or its counsel for making a false statement to the Court. \nThis 16th day of June, 2011. \n/s/ Daniel J.

This chart should not be \nread alone, but should be reviewed together with the analysis that follows. As \nindicated within the report, most of the compliance areas require ongoing review \nand  evaluation,  and  therefore,  although  a  compliance  area  may  be  marked  as \n\"Resolved\"  for  the  limited  purposes  of  this  report,  this  does  not  mean  that \ncompliance has been fully or finally achieved. Instead, a designation of \"Resolved\" \nis intended to convey that this area is not a key compliance concern for the limited \npurpose  of  this  7/14  Report,  provided,  compliance  will  be  revisited  in  future \nreports. \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 3 of 43\n \nII.  HISTORICAL RECAP \n  Approximately one year has passed since Joe D. Whitley was appointed \nSpecial Master and charged with certain duties, including: (i) the duty to monitor \nand  enforce  compliance  with  the  Court  Orders2;  (ii)  the  duty  to  manage  and \nsupervise  discovery  disputes  between  the  parties  and  work  with  the  parties  to \naddress any barriers to compliance; and (iii) the duty to issue written quarterly \nreports on compliance with the Court Orders.  (Special Master Order, Doc. No. \n309, ยถยถ 1, 3).  For purposes of evaluating the status of compliance at the time of \nthis 7/14 Report, a brief historical recap of efforts and compliance findings to date \nis appropriate. \nFirst Three Months \n  The Special Master was appointed on June 22, 2016.  (Special Master Order, \nDoc. No. 309). At the time of his appointment, the Special Master had very limited \nknowledge of the key compliance issues in this case.  From June 22, 2016 through \nthe submission of the Special Master's first Quarterly Compliance Report dated \n                                                 \n2 For purposes of this report, \"Court Orders\" shall collectively refer to this Court's \nOrder entered December 8, 2010 [Doc. No. 265] (if referenced alone, the \"2010 \nOrder\"),  this  Court's  Order  entered  December  15,  2011  [Doc.  No.  280]  (if \nreferenced alone, the \"2011 Order\"), and this Court's Order entered May 19, 2015 \n[Doc. No. 289] (if referenced alone, the \"2015 Order\"). \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 4 of 43\n \nSeptember 29, 2016 [Doc. No. 324] (the \"9/29 Report\"), the Special Master relied \nheavily on the parties' counsel to develop an understanding of the key compliance \nissues,  obstacles  preventing  a  mutual  consensus  of  complete  compliance,  and \npotential strategies to overcome such obstacles.  \n  Through discussions with all parties and ex parte discussions, it became \napparent that structure and predictability was needed to help guide the compliance \nmonitoring process.  This became the Special Master's primary focus for the first \nthree months of his appointment.  (9/29 Report, Doc. No. 324, at pg. 2 \"Prologue\").  \nUltimately, by agreement and compromise, the parties developed an order setting \nforth  initial  monitoring,  discovery,  and  dispute  resolution  procedures  that  the \nparties agreed would help the Special Master fulfil his duties to the Court and help \nestablish a consensus of compliance with the Court Orders.  Id. \n  As indicated in the 9/29 Report, it appeared that significant progress had \nbeen made by the parties in reaching a consent agreement regarding the various \nprocedures  that  would  aid  the  parties  in  achieving  a  mutual  understanding, \nagreement, and consensus of complete compliance with the Court Orders.  Id.  \nBased on the Special Master's report and recommendation, and with the consent of \nthe  parties,  the  Court  entered  the  parties'  Consent  Order  Setting  Forth  Initial \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 5 of 43\n \nSpecial Master Monitoring, Discovery, and Dispute Resolution Procedures [Doc. \nNo. 323] (hereinafter, as modified by subsequent agreement between the parties at \nDoc. No. 339, the \"Procedures Order\").  As of this 7/14 Report, the Procedures \nOrder remains in full force and effect. \nMonths Three to Six \n  From the time of the 9/29 Report through the filing of the Special Master \nQuarterly  Compliance  Report  dated  December  30,  2016  [Doc.  No.  325]  (the \n\"12/30  Report\"), the  parties  began  collecting  documents  and  implementing  the \nadditional procedures set forth in the Procedures Order.  \n  Six months into his appointment, it appeared to the Special Master that the \nparties remained committed to the intent and spirit of the Procedures Order, and \nthe  Special  Master gave substantial deference  to the  City  of  Atlanta's  (\"City\") \napparent  commitment  to the  Procedures Order  as demonstrating  a  \"continuing, \ngood faith commitment to achieving a complete consensus of compliance with the \nCourt.\"  (12/30 Report, Doc. No. 325, at pg. 2-4 \"Prologue\") (internal citations and \nquotations omitted).  Nonetheless, the Special Master reported that certain disputes \nwere  emerging  between  the  parties,  and  the  Special  Master  committed  to \nevaluating the same in the months and quarterly compliance reports to follow.  Id.    \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 6 of 43\n \n  During the three months leading up to the 12/30 Report, the City undertook \nsignificant efforts to produce documents consistent with the requirements of the \nProcedures Order.  However, as of the 12/30 Report, Plaintiffs' Counsel and the \nSpecial Master had not had time to fully evaluate such productions or to determine \nhow  they  might  affect  determinations  of  compliance  with  the  Court  Orders.  \nAccordingly, based on limited findings set forth in the 12/30 Report, the Special \nMaster recommended that the Court defer any immediate action, provided:  \nโฆthe Special Master will continue to develop the record related to \ncompliance through additional discovery within the powers set forth \nby the Special Master Order and requests that the parties immediately \nmake  the  Special  Master  aware  of  any  circumstances  that  would \nprevent a finding of compliance, so the Special Master can evaluate \nthe need for an evidentiary hearing in advance of the next quarterly \ncompliance reportโฆ \n(Id. at pg. 23 \"Preliminary Conclusion and Recommendation\").  Subsequent to this \nreport, the Special Master, with input from all parties, continued to evaluate the \ndocuments  and  information  received  from  the  City  pursuant  to  the  Procedures \nOrder. \nMonths Six to Nine \n  During the months following the 12/30 Report, it became clear that there \nexisted prevailing areas of disagreement between the parties regarding, inter alia, \ncertain requirements of the Court Orders and the appropriate ways to monitor and \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 7 of 43\n \nevaluate compliance with the same. These issues were discussed in the Special \nMaster Quarterly Compliance Report dated April 12, 2017 [Doc. No. 341] (the \n\"4/12 Report\").  \n  Despite the apparent disputes, the Special Master still believed that all issues \ncould  be  resolved,  particularly  because  the  Court  Orders  all  reflect  and \nmemorialize consent agreements reached by the parties with the approval of the \nCourt.  In other words, the parties have repeatedly reached agreements on the \nproper resolutions of disputes in this case dating back to 2010.   \n  Importantly,  it  also  appeared  that  the  parties,  and  specifically  the  City, \nremained committed  to:  (i)  complying with  requirements under the  Procedures \nOrder; (ii) accommodating additional, more frequent, informal meetings among the \nparties  to  resolve  issues;  and  (iii)  taking  additional  steps set  forth  in  the  4/12 \nReport. This demonstrated to the Special Master a continued commitment to taking \nsteps necessary to establish a consensus of complete compliance with the Court \nOrders.   \n  Based on, inter alia, the City's apparent commitments in this regard, the \nSpecial Master set forth a series of requirements aimed at resolving the disputes \nrelated to compliance, and recommended no further action by the Court.  Notably, \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 8 of 43\n \nmost  or  all of the requirements  imposed  on the  City  in the  4/12  Report  were \ndiscussed with and agreed upon by the City prior to submission of the 4/12 Report.  \nThe Special Master also articulated in the 4/12 Report his belief that additional \nmeetings  between  the  parties  would  help  facilitate  resolutions  of  discrete \ncompliance  issues,  and  recommended  weekly  meetings  until  all  issues  were \nresolved. \n  Indeed, the 4/12 Report identified critical concerns regarding compliance \nwith several important requirements of the Court Orders that needed (and still \nneed) to be resolved.  (See e.g., 4/12 Report, Doc. No. 341, at ยถ2 \"Identification \nRequirement for APD3 Officersโฆ\", ยถยถ4/5 \"Documentation of Warrantless Seizures \nand ID Checksโฆ\", and ยถ7 \"Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaintsโฆ\").  For a \nsummary of all outstanding compliance issues as of this 7/14 Report, please see the \nCompliance Reference Chart and Table of Contents at the beginning of this report. \nMonths Nine to Twelve \n  In the three months since the 4/12 Report, it has become clear that there are \nfundamental disagreements between the parties regarding the requirements of the \nCourt  Orders  and  what  documents  and  actions  are  appropriate  to  evaluate \n                                                 \n3 As used in this report, \"APD\" refers to the Atlanta Police Department. \n8 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 9 of 43\n \ncompliance  with  the  Court  Orders.  The  most  pervasive  issues  and  obstacles \npreventing a complete consensus of compliance are addressed by topic below.  \n  Ultimately, this 7/14 Report sets forth the Special Master's recommendation \nto the Court based on all documents and information reviewed to date, including, \nwithout limitation, information covered in the 9/29 Report, the 12/30 Report, and \nthe 4/12 Report (hereinafter, collectively, the \"Past Compliance Reports\"), but with \nparticular emphasis on the three months elapsed since the 4/12 Report, provided, \nthe Special Master will be further investigating, revisiting, and/or supplementing \nall findings in the next quarterly compliance report and those that follow.   \nIII. METHODOLOGY \n   In conducting the Special Master's independent investigation and preparing \nthis report, the Special Master has given consideration to: (i) relevant pleadings, \nfilings, and discovery in the above-styled case, including, but not limited to, the \nCourt Orders, the Procedures Order, and the Past Compliance Reports; (ii) various \nparty and non-party documents, information, and accounts requested and received \nby the Special Master as relevant to the determination of compliance with the \nCourt Orders; and (iii) the parties' direct representations, as officers of the Court, to \nthe Special Master, as an officer of the Court.  \n9 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 10 of 43\n \n  Where possible, evidence has been reviewed according to a preponderance \nof the evidence standard to make a preliminary determination about compliance; \nhowever, no formal evidentiary hearing has been requested or held, and the Special \nMaster has not had an opportunity to consider all potentially relevant evidence.  \nAdditionally, in some instances, the Special Master explicitly finds that additional \nevidence  or  time  is  needed  to  formulate  a  complete  opinion  on  compliance.  \nTherefore, these limited findings are subject to further review and revision, and no \nparty is deemed to have waived any evidentiary rights or objections.   \n  Ultimately, as indicated herein, the Special Master will move to more formal \nbriefings  and  hearings  in  conjunction  with  efforts  to  apply  Eleventh  Circuit \ncompliance standards and finality. Notably, the Special Master continues to believe \nthat cooperation and agreement between the parties remains the most efficient and \nreasonable path towards establishing a consensus of complete compliance with the \nCourt Orders, as contemplated by the parties and the Court. However, if the parties \nare unable to reach agreement, this 7/14 Report sets forth the Special Master's \nlimited findings to date and recommendation to the Court regarding the appropriate \npath ahead. \n10 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 11 of 43\n \nIV. COMPLIANCE FINDINGS \n   For  purposes  of  this  7/14  Report,  the  Special  Master  is  organizing \ncompliance findings by topic, as referenced in the 2010 Order and the 2011 Order, \nwith references to related issues from the 2015 Order, the Procedures Order, and \nthe 4/12 Report.  Utilizing this approach, the Special Master aims to provide the \nmost  essential  analysis  of  related  compliance  issues  arising  out  of  the  Court \nOrders.  \n  The Special Master has attempted to accurately paraphrase the requirements \nof the Court Orders and understands and acknowledges that compliance with the \nCourt Orders -- not the Special Master's short form interpretations thereof -- is the \nrelevant  inquiry.  Accordingly,  nothing  in  this  7/14  Report,  including  any \nparaphrased language, is intended to (nor shall it) modify, alter, or amend any of \nthe Court's Orders.  To the extent there is any conflict, the Court Orders prevail and \nare controlling. \n1.  REVOCATION  OR  AMENDMENT  OF  UNCONSTITUTIONAL \nPOLICIES [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 1] AND RELATED ISSUES FROM \n2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถยถ 4(a), 4(b), 7, and 8]. \n  As more particularly set forth in the Past Compliance Reports, to the best of \nthe  Special  Master's  knowledge,  the  City  timely  complied  with  the  technical  \nrequirements of the relevant Court Orders, and the Special Master is not presently \n11 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 12 of 43\n \naware  of  any  disputes  related  to  the  revocation  and/or  amendment  of \nunconstitutional policies, as required by the Court Orders.  (See e.g., 4/12 Report, \nDoc. No. 341, ยถ1).  In fact, on or around March 27, 2017, the Special Master \nreceived written confirmation from Plaintiffs' Counsel confirming that \"Plaintiffs \nhave no comment about the affidavit submitted by the Chief\" consistent with the \nCity's obligations set forth at paragraph 4(A) of the Procedures Order.  Id.  The \nSpecial Master is not presently aware of any change in this status. \n  In the 4/12 Report, the Special Master clarified the City's responsibilities \nunder  the  Procedures  Order,  articulating  that  all  SOPs4  should  be  provided  in \nfuture productions, together with any additional or amended affidavits that may be \nnecessary  to  address  the  requirements  set  forth  by  paragraph  4(A)  of  the \nProcedures Order and to monitor compliance with the requirements set forth at Ex. \nA, ยถ 1 of the 2011 Court Order and at ยถยถ 4(a), 4(b), 7, and 8 of the 2015 Order.  Id. \n  The Special Master received verbal confirmation from the City in a June 21, \n2017 status conference that all such documentation was provided by the City on or \naround June 1, 2017. The Special Master has not independently verified the extent \nor Constitutionality of all of the SOPs provided, and does not plan to undergo a \n                                                 \n4 As used in this report, \"SOP\" refers to the APD's Standard Operating Procedures. \n12 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 13 of 43\n \ncomprehensive  review  at  this  time,  given  the  representations  of  the  City  and \nPlaintiffs' Counsel, to date, and the lack of any apparent controversy. \n  That  said,  additional  fact  finding  and  scrutiny  are  necessary  before  the \nSpecial Master can find that the ADP SOPs, as amended, have fully implemented \n\"all [] revisions required by [the Court Orders]\", and the requirements relative to \nAPD SOPs are ongoing in nature.  (See e.g., 2015 Order, Doc. No. 289, ยถ 8).  \nAccordingly, the Special Master believes a finding of compliance eventually will \nbe appropriate and forthcoming; however, the Special Master again defers any \nfinal finding out of necessity at this time. This issue will be revisited in conjunction \nwith future reports. \n  In sum, provisions of the Procedures Order appear to be contributing to a \nconsensus  of  compliance,  and,  therefore,  the  Special  Master  recommends  the \nprocedures set forth at paragraph 4(A) of the Procedures Order be extended for \nanother  year.  The  Special  Master  will  file  a  motion  to  extend  the  relevant \nprovisions of the Procedures Order, consistent with this report. \n13 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 14 of 43\n \n2.  IDENTIFICATION  REQUIREMENT  FOR  APD  OFFICERS  [2011 \nOrder at Ex. A, ยถ 2] AND RELATED ISSUES FROM 2015 ORDER \n[2015 Order at ยถยถ 4(a), 4(b)]. \n  As set forth in the Past Compliance Reports, disputes existed and still exist \nas  to  whether  the  City  has  achieved  complete  compliance  with  respect  to  the \nfollowing requirement of the 2010 Order and 2011 Order: \n2. Identification Requirement for APD Officers \nThe City of Atlanta shall require all Atlanta police officers who are in \nuniform, other than a rain slicker or traffic direction vest, to wear a \nconspicuously  visible  nametag,  and  to  require  any  Atlanta  police \nofficer who is in uniform or has displayed a badge or other indicia of \npolice authority (such as a police vest, etc.), to identify himself by \nname and badge number upon request at some point before the end of \nan encounter with a civilian. \n(hereinafter, the \"Identification Requirement\") (See e.g., 4/12 Report, Doc. No. \n341, ยถ2; see also 2011 Order, Doc. No. 280, \"Exhibit A: Reforms of the Atlanta \nPolice Department\", ยถ2). \n  In conjunction with development of the Procedures Order, the parties agreed \nto implement and monitor additional procedures that would aid in achieving a \nconsensus of complete compliance with regard to the Identification Requirement as \nset forth in the Court Orders, including, but not limited to, the procedures set forth \nat paragraph 4(D) of the Procedures Order.  Previously, there had been a lack of \n14 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 15 of 43\n \nclarity among the parties regarding how to establish compliance with the \"shall \nrequire\" element of the Identification Requirement.  Notably, all parties agreed to \nthe Procedures Order as a way to help establish verifiable compliance metrics.  \n  Along  these  lines,  on  or  around  January  3,  2017,  the  City  provided  to \nPlaintiffs' Counsel and the Special Master a schedule of routine daily uniform \ninspections and addresses for the inspections by APD zone, affording the Special \nMaster  and/or  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  the  opportunity  to  attend  daily  uniform \ninspections for monitoring purposes contemplated by the Court's Orders.   \n  In the 4/12 Report, the Special Master articulated findings from a March 9, \n2017  inspection  of  a  daily  roll-call  uniform  inspection  and  reported  general \nsatisfaction  with  the  APD's  handling  of  daily  roll-call  uniform  inspections; \nhowever,  the  Special  Master  still  had  not  witnessed  one  of  the  more  robust, \nperiodic uniform and nametag inspections required by paragraph 4(D)(ii) of the \nProcedures Order (hereinafter, a \"Robust Nametag Inspection\").  Again, the Robust \nNametag Inspection was one in a series of procedures developed (and agreed to by \nthe  parties)  as  a  way  to  create  verifiable  compliance  metrics  related  to  the \nIdentification Requirement set forth at paragraph 2 of the 2011 Order, which the \nparties interpreted differently. \n15 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 16 of 43\n \n  To address this and other gaps in compliance monitoring, the Special Master \noutlined  in  the  4/12  Report  a  series of  additional  requests  or  requirements,  as \nfollows:   \n(cid:129)  First, the Special Master requested a schedule of the more robust, periodic \nuniform  and  nametag  inspections  required  by  paragraph  4(D)(ii)  of  the \nProcedures Order (i.e., Robust Nametag Inspections), and noted that the City \nagreed  to  coordinate  one  or  more  such  inspection(s)  with  the  Special \nMaster's schedule.   \n \n(cid:129)  Second, the Special Master requested (on a prospective basis) that the City \nprovide to the Special Master and Plaintiffs' Counsel written records of or \nrelated to the paragraph 4(D)(ii) nametag inspections (i.e., Robust Nametag \nInspections\") to assist with the Special Master's monitoring efforts related to \nsame, including, but not limited to, any completed Watch Commander's Roll \nCall  Checklists  and/or  Roll  Call  Assignment  Sheets,  and  any  other \ndocumentation tending to confirm (or not to confirm) compliance with the \nidentification requirements.  \n \n(cid:129)  Third, the Special Master requested that the City provide records sufficient \nto identify approved \"second jobs\" or \"extra jobs\" for APD officers and the \nlocations thereof, including, but not limited to, access to the field inspection \nteam  monitoring  same,  as  contemplated  by  paragraph  4(D)(iii)(2)  of  the \nProcedures Order.   \n \n(cid:129)  Fourth, the Special Master requested an opportunity for inspection of the \nRobust  Nametag  Inspections  contemplated  by  paragraph  4(D)(ii)  of  the \nProcedures Order as they pertain to one or more \"special units\" as identified \nby Major Schierbaum and Captain Klotzer in the Special Master's April 3, \n2017 ex parte conference with the City and certain other representatives of \nAPD. \n \n16 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 17 of 43\n \n(4/12  Report,  Doc.  No.  341,  ยถ2).  The  Special  Master  committed  to  continue \nmonitoring compliance with the identification requirements for APD officers and \nto  document  his  findings  to  Plaintiffs'  Counsel,  the  City,  and  the  Court.    Id.  \nNotably,  the  requirements  set  forth  in  the  4/12  Report  generally  track  the \nrequirements of the Procedures Order. \n  To date, despite considerable efforts, the Special Master has not observed a \nRobust Nametag Inspection and is unable to report meaningful compliance by the \nCity with regard to the additional requirements set forth in the 4/12 Report, which \nthe Special Master contemplated as reasonably necessary to fulfill his duties to the \nCourt with regard to monitoring and enforcement of the Court Orders and related \nquarterly  compliance  reporting.    As  a  result,  the  Special  Master  is  unable  to \nconfirm compliance with the Court Orders, because the City has not established, at \na minimum, its compliance with the relevant portions of the Procedures Order.   \n  This is not to suggest that the City has necessarily failed to comply with \nparagraph  2  of  the  2011  Court  Order  (i.e.,  the  Identification  Requirement); \nhowever, the City has failed to establish its compliance with the Procedures Order \nand to appropriately address the additional requests set forth in the 4/12 Report, \n17 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 18 of 43\n \nwhich were designed to assist with performance of the Special Master's duties, as \nset forth above. \n  In sum, due to the City's failure to establish compliance with the Procedures \nOrder, which was developed to create verifiable compliance metrics related to the \nIdentification Requirement, and due to the City's failure to appropriately respond to \nthe 4/12 Report, the Special Master cannot find that the City is in compliance with \nthe  Court  Orders.  Further,  the  Special  Master  questions  the  City's  level  of \ncommitment  to  establishing  compliance  with  the  Identification  Requirement \nthrough steps previously agreed upon by the City. \n  As a result, the Special Master recommends that the Court enter a show \ncause order in the same or substantially similar form as the proposed order attached \nhereto as Exhibit A (the \"Show Cause Order\") without delay.   \n  At a minimum, the Special Master recommends that the procedures set forth \nat  paragraph  4(D)  of  the  Procedures  Order  be  extended  for  another  year.  The \nSpecial  Master  will  file  a  motion  to  extend  the  relevant  provisions  of  the \nProcedures Order, consistent with this report. \n18 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 19 of 43\n \n3.  NO  INTERFERENCE  WITH  AUDIO  OR  VIDEO  RECORDINGS \n[2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 3]. \n  The  Special  Master  does  not  have  sufficient  evidence  to  make  a \ndetermination related to this requirement and withholds any further discussion until \nthe next quarterly compliance report.   \n  As  stated  in  the  4/12  Report,  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  previously  expressed \npotential concern related to the City's compliance with this requirement, and the \nSpecial Master requested an ex parte conference with one or more members of the \nPlaintiffs' Counsel team to discuss compliance concerns related to this particular \nrequirement of the Court Orders, to the extent appropriate.  (4/12 Report, Doc. No. \n341, pp. 12, ยถ3). However, no further communications from Plaintiffs' Counsel \nwere forthcoming on this particular topic. Therefore, unless or until additional \ninformation  is  brought  to  the  Special  Master's  attention,  the  Special  Master  is \noperating under the assumption that the City has established some satisfactory \nlevel of  compliance  with  this  requirement,  while  remaining open  to  additional \nfeedback and suggestions regarding appropriate ways to monitor compliance. \n  However, as this requirement is ongoing in nature, a finding of compliance \nis deferred out of necessity, pending review of additional evidence by the Special \n19 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 20 of 43\n \nMaster, and the issue of compliance will be revisited, as necessary and appropriate, \nin conjunction with future reports. \n4/5.  DOCUMENTATION  OF  WARRANTLESS  SEIZURES  AND  ID \nCHECKS  [2011  Order  at  Ex.  A,  ยถยถ  4,  5]  AND  RELATED  ISSUES \nFROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถ 6]. \n  In the 4/12 Report, the Special Master identified critical concerns relative to \nthe requirement to document warrantless seizures and ID checks, as follows: \n(cid:129)  First,  the  documents/information  provided  by  the  City  appear  to  be \ninsufficient to effectively monitor and to make a determination regarding \ncompliance with the above-referenced requirements of the Court Orders. \n \n(cid:129)  Second, although the documentation is insufficient to effectively monitor \ncompliance, the Special Master's review and related communications with \nthe parties confirms that the City has not achieved substantial compliance \nwith the requirement to document warrantless seizures and ID checks. \n \n(4/12 Report, Doc. No. 341, ยถ2).   \n  Then, the Special Master set forth a series of remedial requirements aimed at \naddressing these critical concerns, in large part, based on the parties' mutually \nexpressed desires to expedite a path towards a consensus of complete compliance, \nincluding, inter alia, the following: (i) approval and distribution of a \"demographic \nform5 flowchart\" for reference by APD officers in the field as a compliance tool; \n                                                 \n5 For purposes of this report, the requirement to document warrantless seizures and \nID checks is sometimes referred to as the \"demographic form\" requirement, and \nany references to the term \"demographic form\" in this 7/14 Report refer to the \n20 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 21 of 43\n \n(ii)  approval  and  distribution  of  a  limited  \"roll  call\"  training  program  on  the \nrequirement to document warrantless seizures; (iii) approval and distribution of a \nmore  robust  Calhoun  Training6  covering  this  topic,  among  others;  and  (iv) \nprospective monitoring of more limited data sets in shorter time intervals to allow \nfor evaluation of the City's compliance and adjustments to the monitoring process \non a more frequent basis than originally contemplated by the Procedures Order \n(hereinafter, collectively, the \"Demographic Form Objectives\").  Id.  However, \nthere had not been ample time to fully discuss and reach agreement on all matters \nrelative to the Demographic Form Objectives and how to accomplish same prior to \nthe filing of the 4/12 Report.  \n  Accordingly,  given  the  importance  of  the  requirements  related  to  the \ndocumentation of warrantless seizures and ID checks to the spirit of the Court \nOrders, and given both parties' stated desire to achieve a consensus of complete \n                                                                                                                                                             \nspecific form utilized by the APD in efforts to comply with the requirement to \ndocument warrantless seizures and ID checks, as set forth in the Court Orders.\n \n6  \"Calhoun  Training\"  refers  to  the  recurrent,  mandatory  training  for  sworn \nemployees  of  the  Atlanta  Police  Department  described  more  particularly  at \nparagraph 6 of Exhibit A to the 2010 Order and 2011 Order and at paragraphs 1, 2, \nand 3 of the 2015 Order.  Compliance with the Calhoun Training requirements is \nevaluated separately at paragraph 6 of this 7/14 Report below. \n21 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 22 of 43\n \ncompliance, in lieu of any sanctions, the Special Master required the following \nsteps in furtherance of the Demographic Form Objectives:  \n(i) Major Schierbaum and his Training Academy team [were asked] to deliver \nto a sample recruiting class the \"demographic form flowchart\" approved by \nPlaintiffs'  Counsel  and  the  \"demographic  form  flowchart\"  in  the  format \ncontemplated by the City as discussed at the April 3, 2017 ex parte meeting for \na test-run;  \n \n(ii) within two weeks, Major Schierbaum and his team [were asked] to provide \nthe Special Master the test data and results from the recruiting class sampling, \nto be shared with Plaintiffs' Counsel;  \n \n(iii) contemporaneously with the presentation of the test data and results, Major \nSchierbaum and his team [were asked] to present to Plaintiffs' Counsel and the \nSpecial Master a proposed \"roll-call training\" program or agenda for review and \napproval, separate and apart from the Calhoun Training program; \n \n(iv)  subject  to  reasonable  objections  by  the  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  and/or  the \nSpecial Master within seventy-two hours, the City [was directed] to disseminate \nthe approved \"demographic form flowchart\" and \"roll-call training\" program to \nall APD personnel as soon as reasonably possible and to provide documentary \nconfirmation of the roll out to Plaintiffs' Counsel and the Special Master;  \n \n(v) on Tuesday, April 25, 2017 or Thursday, April 27, 2017 or another date \nmutually acceptable to the parties, Plaintiffs' Counsel, City Counsel, the Special \nMaster, and certain APD representatives present for the April 3, 2017 ex parte \nconference with the Special Master [were asked] to meet at Director Barrett's \n911  Call  Center  facility  to  discuss  the  documents  and  processes  by  which \nDirector Barrett, Major Schierbaum, Captain Klotzer, Major Murphy, and Lt. \nSpann  recommend  the  Special  Master  and  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  monitor \ncompliance with the warrantless seizure and ID check requirements, including, \nbut  not  limited  to,  appropriately  filtered  CAD  (Computer  Aided  Dispatch) \nSystem records, GCIC/NCIC/ACIC records, \"before end of shift\" demographic \nforms, supervisor approved demographic forms, and \"audit trail\" reports related \n22 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 23 of 43\n \nto all demographic forms identifying when, if ever, any changes were made to \nthe  demographic  forms  in  the  City's  systems  or  databases  and  what  those \nchanges entailed; and  \n \n(vi)  after  the  meeting  at  Director  Barrett's  911  call  center,  the  City  [was \nrequired]  to  provide  all  documentation  agreed  upon  by  the  parties  at  said \nmeeting in two week intervals and to discuss any compliance issues in weekly \nor bi-weekly in-person meetings between the parties and the Special Master to \nbe scheduled on Friday mornings from 9:00 AM to 12:00 Noon at the Law \nOffices  of  Baker,  Donelson,  Bearman,  Caldwell  &  Berkowitz,  P.C.,  with \nattendance required by at least one authorized representative for each party and \nany necessary APD representatives.   \n \n(hereinafter, collectively, the \"Demographic Form Process\") (4/12 Report, Doc. \nNo. 341, ยถ4/5).  Notably, the 4/12 Report states explicitly that \"[a]ny prospective \nmonitoring requirement is in addition to all other productions required by the other \nCourt Orders, the Procedures Order, or by agreement between the Special Master \nand  the  City,  until  further  notice  or  agreement  by  the  parties.\"  Id.    The \nDemographic Form Process was, in large part, discussed with and agreed upon by \nthe City prior to the filing of the 4/12 Report. \n  To  date,  none  of  the  Demographic  Form  Process  and  none  of  the \nDemographic Form Objectives have been accomplished as contemplated by the \n4/12 Report.   \n  The  Special  Master  has  attempted  several  times  to  schedule  meetings \ncontemplated by the Demographic Form Process; however, the City now appears \n23 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 24 of 43\n \ndisinclined to engage in the Demographic Form Process and/or to accomplish the \nDemographic Form Objectives, and has asserted to the Special Master its belief \nthat  the  requirement  to  document  warrantless  seizures  and  ID  checks  is  either \noverly burdensome or unnecessary.  On information and belief, the City may even \nseek relief from the requirement. \n  Notwithstanding, the requirements related to documentation of warrantless \nseizures and ID checks remain in full force and effect as a result of the Court \nOrders,  the  Procedures  Order,  and  the  4/12  Report,  none  of  which  have  been \nmodified, amended, vacated, or superseded as of the filing of this report. \n  Furthermore,  Plaintiffs'  Counsel  have  presented  credible  evidence  to  the \nSpecial Master in ex parte discussions and in meetings with all parties and the \nSpecial Master suggesting that the City may, in fact, be out of compliance with the \nrelevant  requirements.  Notably,  some  portion  of  Plaintiffs' presentation  was ex \nparte, and therefore, the City has not waived any objections or rights to challenge \nsuch evidence, and all parties should be given a fair opportunity to present their \ncomplete  cases  related  to  same.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Special \nMaster has concerns about the City's ability to establish compliance with the Court \nOrders at this time. \n24 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 25 of 43\n \n  For these additional reasons, the Special Master recommends that the Court \nenter a show cause order in the same or substantially similar form as the proposed \nShow Cause Order attached hereto as Exhibit A without delay.  \n  Upon  resolution  of  all  issues  related  to  the  requirement  to  document \nwarrantless seizures and ID checks, including confirmation regarding appropriate \ndocumentation to monitor, evaluate, and report on compliance, the Special Master \nwill file a motion to modify and extend the relevant provisions of the Procedures \nOrder,  as  appropriate,  in  a  continued  effort  to transition this  compliance  issue \ntowards more routine monitoring and reporting. \n6.  \"CALHOUN\" TRAINING [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ 6] AND RELATED \nISSUES FROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order at ยถยถ 1, 2, 3]. \n  As set forth more fully in the Past Compliance Reports, there have been \ndisputes  related  to past  compliance  with  the  requirements of  the  Court  Orders \nrelated  to  Calhoun  Training.    Nonetheless,  the  Special  Master  has  been  and \nremains  inclined  to  find  that  the  City  has  achieved  substantial  or  technical \ncompliance with past requirements related to Calhoun Training, provided that the \nCity confirm its good faith through completion of the procedures related to future \ntraining  set  forth  by  the  Procedures  Order,  to  be  demonstrated  by  a  Calhoun \nTraining program acceptable in format and content to Plaintiffs and delivered to all \n25 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 26 of 43\n \nsworn APD employees within the time frames contemplated by the Court Orders, \non  or  before  August  17,  2017.  This  approach  is  consistent  with  the  parties' \nprospective focus and approach in the Procedures Order and ongoing collaborative \nefforts between the parties related to Calhoun Training. Accordingly, compliance \nwith the Calhoun Training requirements will be revisited in conjunction with future \ncompliance reports.     \n7.  TIMELY RESOLUTION OF CITIZEN COMPLAINTS [2011 Order at \nEx. A, ยถ 7] AND RELATED ISSUES FROM 2015 ORDER [2015 Order \nat ยถ 5] AND PROCEDURES ORDER. \n  As set forth more fully in the Past Compliance Reports, without making any \nfinal findings, the Special Master preliminarily found that the City achieved, at a \nminimum, technical or substantial compliance with the requirements of the 2015 \nOrder  through  its  initial  production  and  subsequent  curing  of  any  apparent \ndeficiencies, if any, related to the OPS7 spreadsheet.  However, disputes existed \nand still exist as to the City's compliance with certain related requirements of other \nCourt Orders, for example, paragraph 7 of Exhibit A to the 2010 Order, which \nprovides: \n                                                 \n7 \"OPS\" refers to the Atlanta Police Department Office of Professional Standards, \nwhich is at least one  mechanism by which citizens  may submit complaints of \npolice  misconduct.  More  information  about  OPS  is  available  online  at \nhttp://www.atlantapd.org/services/office-of-professional-standards.   \n26 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 27 of 43\n \n7. Timely Resolution of Citizen Complaints \nThe Atlanta Police Department shall investigate and finally adjudicate \nall citizen complaints of police misconduct of any kind within 180 \ndays of the complaint. \n(emphasis added) (hereinafter, the \"180 Day Requirement\") (See e.g., 4/12 Report, \nDoc. No. 341, ยถ7; see also 2011 Order, Doc. No. 280, \"Exhibit A: Reforms of the \nAtlanta Police Department\", ยถ7). \n  To  be clear,  there  is  disagreement  regarding  the  meaning  of  โall  citizen \ncomplaints of police misconduct of any kindโ as contemplated by the 2010 Order \nand the 2011 Order.  To paraphrase the issue, Plaintiffs opine that the language is \nintentionally broad and includes types of unspecified citizen complaints that are \nnot necessarily investigated and adjudicated through the OPS system.  In other \nwords, Plaintiffs do not believe the OPS system effectively tracks or monitors \ncompliance with the requirements of the Court Orders.  On the other hand, the City \nopines  that  โcitizen  complaintโ  is  a  \"term  of  art\"  and  expressly  refers  to  and \ncontemplates  the  OPS  system  and  process  and  nothing  more.  In  short,  there \nappears to be a fundamental disagreement regarding what constitutes a \"citizen \ncomplaint\" and, therefore, what is required by the Court Orders. \n27 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 28 of 43\n \n  This fundamental disagreement regarding the meaning of the Court Orders \nboils down to two critical issues for purposes of this report. First, the interpretation \nof the Court Orders necessarily impacts substantive compliance (i.e., whether \"all \ncitizen complaints of police misconduct of any kind\" are being investigated and \nadjudicated  within  180  days  of  the  complaint  as  contemplated  by  the  Court \nOrders). Second, after the scope of substantive compliance is resolved, there are \nundoubtedly questions related to the documentation being provided to the Plaintiffs \nand  the  Special  Master  and  its  completeness  and  effectiveness  to  monitor  and \neffectively evaluate compliance efforts. \n  To address the issue, the Special Master held an informal hearing on May \n25,  2017  and  articulated  to  the  parties  a  procedure  to  resolve  the  dispute,  as \nfollows: \nIf a mutual resolution cannot be reached during these meetings, the \nSpecial Master will issue an informal assessment regarding how he \nbelieves  the  issue  should  be  resolved  based  on  the  information \npresented.  Going forward, if the parties agree with the Special \nMasterโs informal assessment, he will request that they stipulate \nand/or  consent to  any  necessary  amendments to the  Procedures \nOrder to memorialize the partiesโ agreement.  If, however, either \nparty disagrees with the Special Masterโs findings and wishes to \nstand firm, the Special Master will request that the dissenting party \nsubmit for his consideration an appropriate motion.  He will then \nentertain a briefing and hold a formal evidentiary hearing, pursuant \nto a schedule to be determined, so that the Special Master can issue \n28 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 29 of 43\n \na  formal  ruling  consistent  with  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the \nSpecial Master Order and Fed. R. Civ. P. 53.   \n \n(hereinafter,  the  \"Dispute  Resolution  Procedure\")  (See  Holly  Hampton  Email, \n5/23/2017 at 11:49 AM). \n  Consistent with the Dispute Resolution Procedure and the parties' requests to \nprovide guidance on this issue, attached hereto as Exhibit B is a proposed order \naddressing the scope of the 180 Day Requirement (hereinafter, the \"Proposed 180 \nDay Order\"), which sets forth the manner in which the Special Master believes the \nissue should be resolved based on the information and limited argument presented \nby the parties to date. As set forth more fully in the Dispute Resolution Procedure, \nif  the  parties  do  not  oppose  the  Proposed  180  Day  Order,  the  Special  Master \nrequests they consent to its entry.    \n  If,  however,  any  party  disagrees  with  the  Special  Masterโs  findings  and \nwishes  to  stand  on  its  objections,  the  Special  Master  hereby  requests  that  the \ndissenting party file an appropriate motion within 35 days of the filing of this \nreport.  Upon receipt of a timely filed motion, the Special Master will entertain \nbriefing,  hold  a  formal  evidentiary  hearing  pursuant  to  a  schedule  to  be \ndetermined,  and  issue  a  formal  ruling  on  any  such  motion,  subject  to  appeal, \n29 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 30 of 43\n \nconsistent with the procedures set forth in the Special Master Order and Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 53. \n  In the interim, due to probable implications of a ruling regarding the scope \nof the 180 Day Requirement on the scope of documents necessary to monitor \ncompliance efforts, and in the interests of efficiency and economy, the Special \nMaster has placed a temporary hold on his monitoring efforts related to City's OPS \nfiles, including, but not limited to, review of documents being produced pursuant \nto the 2015 Order and the procedures set forth at paragraph 4(B) of the Procedures \nOrder. If the Court Orders contemplate more โcitizen complaintsโ beyond those \nsubmitted or otherwise processed through OPS, any review of documents limited \nonly to OPS compliance is incomplete, and the procedures relative to monitoring \ncompliance must necessarily be reconsidered. Indeed, the City's compliance efforts \nmay require substantial reform if it is determined that OPS is not the appropriate \nmechanism through which to establish compliance with the Court Orders. \n  In sum, for the reasons set forth in the Proposed 180 Day Order, the Special \nMaster opines that the 180 Day Requirement contemplated by the Court Orders is \nbroader in scope than the City's current compliance efforts. However, since there \nare potentially unresolved disputes related to the interpretation of the 180 Day \n30 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 31 of 43\n \nRequirement  that  have  not  been  fully  briefed  and  argued,  a  final  finding  of \ncompliance  is  deferred  out  of  necessity,  and  the  issue  of  compliance  will  be \nrevisited, as necessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future reports.   \n  Upon resolution of the issues related to the 180 Day Requirement, including \nconfirmation regarding appropriate documentation to monitor, evaluate, and report \non compliance, the Special Master will file a motion to modify and extend the \nrelevant provisions of the Procedures Order, as appropriate, in a continued effort to \ntransition this compliance issue towards more routine monitoring and reporting. \n8.  INVESTIGATION OF OFFICER CONDUCT [2011 Order at Ex. A, ยถ \n8]. \n  The Special Master has not been made aware of any disputes related to the \nrequirements  relative  to  the  investigation  of  officer  conduct  but  has  not  fully \ninvestigated the matter.  Therefore, at this time, while the Special Master believes a \nfinding of compliance is appropriate and will be forthcoming, there is not sufficient \nevidence to make a final determination related to this requirement, and any further \ndiscussion is deferred until the next quarterly compliance report. \n9.  MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL  TASK  FORCE  ASSIGNMENTS  [2011 \nOrder at Ex. A, ยถ 9]. \n  The Special Master has not been made aware of any disputes related to the \nrequirements relative to the multi-jurisdictional task force assignments but has not \n31 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 32 of 43\n \nfully investigated the matter.  Therefore, at this time, while the Special Master \nbelieves a finding of compliance is appropriate and will be forthcoming, there is \nnot sufficient evidence to make a final determination related to this requirement, \nand any further discussion is deferred until the next quarterly compliance report. \n10.  OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF 2015 COURT ORDER [2015 Order at \nยถยถ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14]. \n  A.   Paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the 2015 Order. \n  As set forth in the Past Compliance Reports, paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the \n2015 Order relate to requests for documents and information in conjunction with \nefforts  to  monitor  compliance  under  the  Court  Orders.  With  regard  to  these \nrequirements,  the  Special  Master  has  previously  opined  that  the  City  was \nattempting in good faith to comply with the applicable Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, the Local Rules and Standing Orders of the Court, the Court Orders, \nand the Procedures Order.   \n  However, the 4/12 Report expressly articulated that additional coordination \nand  collaboration  with  APD  representatives  was  necessary  to  identify  the \nappropriate documentation needed to evaluate compliance, to streamline efforts \nrelated to monitoring, and to achieve a consensus of complete compliance with the \nCourt Orders.  (4/12 Report, Doc. No. 341, pp. 23, ยถ8).  Along these lines, and in \n32 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 33 of 43\n \nan  effort  to  make  the  monitoring  process  more  transparent  and  efficient  for \neveryone  involved,  the  Special  Master  requested  meetings,  with  attendance \nrequired by at least one authorized counsel representative for each party and any \nnecessary APD representatives. Id.  In the 4/12 Report, the Special Master also \narticulated various documents that needed to be discussed, particularly with regard \nto the requirement to document warrantless seizures and ID checks, discussed in \ngreater detail at paragraph 4/5 above.  Id. \n  To  date,  none  of  the  Demographic  Form  Process  and  none  of  the \nDemographic Form Objectives have been accomplished as contemplated by the \n4/12 Report.   \n  Notably,  the  Special  Master  has  attempted  several  times  to  schedule \nmeetings  contemplated  by  the  Demographic  Form  Process;  however,  the  City \nappears  disinclined  to  engage  in  the  Demographic  Form  Process  and/or  to \naccomplish the Demographic Form Objectives, and has asserted to the Special \nMaster its belief that the requirement to document warrantless seizures and ID \nchecks is overly burdensome.  On information and belief, the City may even seek \nrelief from the requirement. \n33 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 34 of 43\n \n  Notwithstanding, the requirements relative to post-judgment discovery and \ncompliance monitoring remain in full force and effect as a result of the Court \nOrders, the Special Master Order, the Procedures Order, and the 4/12 Report, none \nof which have been modified, amended, vacated, or superseded as of the filing of \nthis report. \n  For these additional reasons, the Special Master recommends that the Court \nenter a show cause order in the same or substantially similar form as the proposed \nShow Cause Order attached hereto as Exhibit A without delay. \n  Upon resolution of the issues discussed in this report, including confirmation \nregarding  appropriate  documentation  to  monitor,  evaluate,  and  report  on \ncompliance,  the  Special  Master  will  file  a  motion  to  modify  and  extend  the \nrelevant provisions of the Procedures Order, as appropriate, in a continued effort to \ntransition this compliance issue towards more routine monitoring and reporting. \n  B.   Paragraph 12 of the 2015 Order. \n  As stated in the Past Compliance Reports, the Special Master has reviewed \nthe record related to paragraph 12 of the 2015 Order and has previously found that \nthe City has been generally complying with the requirements of the 2015 Order \nrelative to the payment of Plaintiffs' counsels' fees; however, since the 4/12 Report, \n34 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 35 of 43\n \nit has become clear that disputes exist as to whether Plaintiffs' counsel are entitled \nto  reimbursement  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1988  and  the  Courtโs  Orders  of  certain \nattorneys' fees related to Plaintiffsโ defense of that certain Petition for Emergency \nRelief from Chief Judge of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of \nGeorgia [Case No. 17-mi-00004-RWS, Doc. No. 1; Case No. 17-cv-00530-RWS, \nDoc. No. 1] (the \"Petition for Emergency Relief\") filed by the City. Notably, the \nSpecial Master has not been made aware of any other disputes regarding any other \nattorneys' fees at this time. \n  With regard to the disputed fees, the Special Master articulated to the parties \nthe Dispute Resolution Procedure and held an informal hearing on May 26, 2017.  \nConsistent  with  the  Dispute  Resolution  Procedure  and  the  parties'  requests  to \nprovide guidance on this issue, attached hereto as Exhibit C is a proposed order \naddressing Plaintiffs' entitlement to attorneys' fees relative to Plaintiffs' defense of \nthe Petition for Emergency Relief (hereinafter, the \"Proposed Fee Dispute Order\"), \nwhich sets forth the manner in which the Special Master presently believes the \nissue should be resolved based on the information and limited argument presented \nat by the parties to date.    \n35 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 36 of 43\n \n  As set forth more fully in the Dispute Resolution Procedure, if the parties \nagree with the Special Masterโs informal assessment in the Proposed Fee Dispute \nOrder, the Special Master requests they consent to its entry.  If, however, any party \ndisagrees with the Special Masterโs findings and wishes to stand on its objections, \nthe Special Master hereby requests that the dissenting party file an appropriate \nmotion within 35 days of the filing of this report.  Upon receipt of a timely filed \nmotion,  the  Special  Master  will  entertain  briefing,  hold  a  formal  evidentiary \nhearing pursuant to a schedule to be determined, and issue a formal ruling on any \nsuch motion, subject to appeal, consistent with the procedures set forth in the \nSpecial Master Order and Fed. R. Civ. P. 53. \n  Since the Special Master has not been made aware of any other disputes \nbetween the parties relative to the requirements set forth at paragraph 12 of the \n2015 Order, except as expressly set forth above and in the Proposed Fee Dispute \nOrder, the Special Master otherwise believes and finds that the City is compliant.  \nHowever, due to the ongoing nature of the paragraph 12 requirements, a final \nfinding is deferred out of necessity, and this issue will be revisited, as necessary \nand appropriate, in conjunction with future reports. \n36 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 37 of 43\n \n  C.   Paragraph 13 of the 2015 Order. \n  The Special Master has reviewed the record related to paragraph 13 of the \n2015 Order and finds that the City has established compliance. \n  D.  Paragraph 14 of the 2015 Order. \n  Paragraph  14  of  the  2015  Order  sets  forth  the  6-year  timeframe \ncontemplated  by  the  2015  Order  and  reiterates  that  the  2015  Order  does  not \noverrule, supersede, or otherwise affect the requirements set forth by the 2010 \nOrder and the 2011 Order.  Beyond these general concepts, paragraph 14 does not \nimpose any new or additional requirements on the City. \n  Due to the ongoing nature of the paragraph 14 requirements (for 6 years) and \nthe overall applicability to the other requirements of the Court Orders, the Special \nMaster  finds  that  compliance  with  paragraph  14  is  not  presently  ripe  for \ncompliance and that additional fact finding would be necessary for the Special \nMaster to formulate an opinion and basis therefor as to compliance.  Accordingly, \na final finding is deferred out of necessity, and this issue will be revisited, as \nnecessary and appropriate, in conjunction with future reports. \n \n \n37 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 38 of 43\n \nV.  PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \n  As  set  forth  herein,  the  Special  Master  has  concerns  about  the  City's \ninterpretation,  understanding,  and  compliance  efforts  with  regard  to  certain \nrequirements of the Court Orders, the Special Master Order, the Procedures Order, \nand the 4/12 Report.  It should be noted that significant progress has been made by \nthe parties with respect to several requirements of the Court Orders, and in some \ninstances, there are no apparent compliance issues. However, with respect to the \nconcerns and requirements discussed in this report, the Special Master believes \nthere is significant and critical work to be done in order to establish a consensus of \ncompliance  with  the  Court's  Orders  and  transition  to  more  routine  compliance \nmonitoring. \n  As stated previously, the Special Master believes that the most expeditious \nand economical path to a consensus of complete compliance is through effective \ncommunications between the parties and the Special Master.  Indeed, the Court \nOrders, the Special Master Order, and the Procedures Order are all decrees entered \nwith the consent of the parties.  However, the City appears disinclined to discuss \nand/or collaborate with Plaintiffs' Counsel regarding outstanding monitoring and \ncompliance  issues,  which  has  contributed,  in  part,  to  the  lack  of  consensus \n38 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 39 of 43\n \nregarding compliance.  If the parties cannot agree on a reasonable resolution of \nmonitoring and compliance issues related to the previously  agreed upon Court \nOrders, the Special Master is concerned that this matter will move away from the \ncollaborative environment contemplated by the parties in the Special Master Order \nand  evolve  into  expensive,  contentious,  and  potentially  counter-productive \nlitigation.   \n  The Special Master's ultimate goal is for the parties to transition this matter \nto a posture of routine compliance monitoring and reporting, consistent with the \nprocess  contemplated  by  the  Procedures  Order  and  the  Special  Master  Order.  \nHowever, this goal cannot be realized until there is a mutual understanding of the \nrequirements of the Court Orders and a mutual willingness to work together to \naccomplish a consensus of complete compliance. For the first three to six months \nof the Special Master's appointment, it appeared the parties were committed to \nworking towards this mutual goal of routine compliance monitoring.  However, the \nSpecial  Master  now  has  reservations  regarding  the  City's  commitment  to  the \nconsent orders to which it previously agreed. \n  There is no doubt that the Procedures Order will require modification in \norder to accomplish the mutual goals of the parties and the Special Master in terms \n39 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 40 of 43\n \nof routine compliance monitoring.  Indeed, it has already been established that \ncertain  documents  contemplated  by  the  Procedures  Order  are  not  sufficient  or \nappropriate to monitor compliance with the Court Orders.  However, the City has \nnot taken the steps necessary to establish what modifications to the compliance \nmonitoring procedures are appropriate. To be clear, the Special Master needs the \nCity's cooperation in establishing the procedures, documents, and other resources \navailable to assist the Special Master in fulfilling his duties to the Court, and the \nSpecial  Master  Order  requires  the  City  to  provide  \"access  to  any  and  all \ndocuments, Atlanta Police Department staff, and any other information as he or she \ndeems necessary to provide the Court with [ ] quarterly compliance reports.\"  The \nSpecial Master is concerned that he is not presently receiving the City's complete \ncooperation in this regard. \n  Accordingly, for all of the reasons set forth in this 7/14 Report, the Special \nMaster  is  additionally  recommending  that  the  Court  enter  the  proposed  order \nattached hereto as Exhibit D without delay.   \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION AND PLEA \n  Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth in this 7/14 Report, the Special \nMaster's complete recommendation and plea to the Court is as follows: \n40 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 41 of 43\n \n  (1)   that the Court enter the Show Cause Order attached hereto as Exhibit \nA without delay; \n  (2)  that the Court adopt the Special Master's proposed Dispute Resolution \nProcedure related to the Proposed 180 Day Order and the Proposed Fee Dispute \nOrder  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  B  and  Exhibit  C,  respectively,  including, \nspecifically, the following: \n  (a)  that, upon receipt of an unopposed motion submitted by the \nSpecial Master and signed by the parties indicating no opposition to the \nProposed  180  Day  Order  or  the  Proposed  Fee  Dispute  Order,  the  Court \nimmediately enter such order;  \n  (b)  that,  to  the  extent  no  motion  is  filed  within  35  days  of \nsubmission  of  this  report  and upon  notification  from  the  Special  Master \nregarding  same,  the  Court  enter  the  Proposed  180  Day  Order  and  the \nProposed Fee Dispute Order in the form or substantially similar form as \nattached hereto as Exhibit B and Exhibit C, respectively;  \n  (c)  that, to the extent any party timely files a motion seeking relief \ndifferent than  what is set  forth  in  the  Proposed  180  Day  Order  and  the \nProposed Fee Dispute Order attached hereto as Exhibit B and Exhibit C, \n41 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 346   Filed 07/19/17   Page 42 of 43\n \nrespectively, the Court adopt the Special Master's proposed procedure to \nentertain  briefing  and  hold  a  formal  evidentiary  hearing,  pursuant  to  a \nschedule to be determined, so that the Special Master can issue a formal \nruling on any such motion, subject to appeal, consistent with the procedures \nset forth in the Special Master Order and Fed.

Smith, Tyrone Taylor, Kelleita Thurman, Stephanie \nUpton, Ronald J. Walker, William Walters, Jared G. Watkins, and Debra A. \nWilliams (collectively, โDefendantsโ), allege as follows:  \nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n2.  This Complaint asserts a civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C ยง \n1983 for damages and declaratory and injunctive relief to redress Defendantsโ \nviolations of Plaintiffsโ rights under the United States Constitution and Georgia \nConstitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to ask \nquestions of and make comments to police officers regarding the discharge of their \nduties.  This Complaint also seeks redress for the numerous state law torts \ncommitted by individual Defendants, including false imprisonment, assault, \nbattery, and trespass. \n3.  Defendants violated the Constitution and committed said torts when, \nwithout search or arrest warrants, officers of the Atlanta Police Department \n(โAPDโ) raided the Atlanta Eagle (โthe Eagleโ) and Rawhide Leather (โRawhideโ) \non September 10-11, 2009 (the โRaidโ). During the Raid, officers of the APD \ndetained all persons who were customers or employees at the Eagle and Rawhide \n(forcing most to lay flat on the ground, many to lay in spilled beer and broken \nglass, and restraining some with handcuffs); used excessive force, including \n4 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 5 of 46\nshoving individuals to the floor and kicking others already on the floor; made \nthreats of improper and excessive violence; made anti-gay slurs; searched all \npersons on the premises; seized the driverโs licenses or other ID documents of \npersons on the premises; and entered the names of persons on the premises into a \npolice computer and checked their names against a police database.  These actions \nwere taken without particularized reasonable suspicion or probable cause to \nbelieve that any individual patron, let alone every person at the establishment, was \ninvolved in any criminal activity whatsoever. \n4.  The only charges against anyone at the Eagle on the night of the Raid \nwere filed against Eagle employees, for Atlanta City Code violations relating to \nallegedly unlicensed adult entertainment, because four dancers were observed, in \nthe words of the arresting officers, allegedly โwearing underwearโ and โdancing.โ \n5.  Each and every patron of the Eagle and Rawhide Leather was \ndetained, searched, and seized during the Raid.  Not a single patron was charged \nwith any crime. \n6.  Plaintiffs seek damages and declaratory and injunctive relief as set \nforth herein. \n5 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 6 of 46\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.

Individual Defendants who were present at the Eagle on September \n10-11, 2009, and who personally participated in the raid conducted that night, are \nreferred to herein as the โRaiding Party.โ \n77.  Because of improper actions taken by Defendants themselves, \nincluding their specific refusal to provides names and badge numbers upon request \nof Plaintiffs, it is impossible for Plaintiffs at this point to allege which particular \nIndividual Defendants did which particular acts.  Plaintiffs believe they will be \nable to identify Defendants through Discovery, and that additionally, Individual \nDefendants are jointly and severally liable for the wrongful acts described in this \nComplaint. \nALLEGATIONS OF FACT \n78.  On the evening of September 10, 2009, at some point before 11:00 \nPM, certain of the Defendants serving as undercover officers of the Atlanta Police \nDepartment entered the Eagle without a search or arrest warrant.  On information \nand belief, these officers were assigned by final decisionmakers for the City to \nconduct an undercover investigation.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 17 of 46\n79.  These officers entered the Eagle pretending to be customers. \n80.  While inside the Eagle, certain of the Defendant undercover officers \nwho later participated in the activities described below consumed alcoholic \nbeverages including Ketel One vodka, Tanqueray gin, Budweiser beer, and Amstel \nLight beer.  \n81.  Later that evening, these Defendant undercover officers without \ndisplaying badges or identifying themselves as members of the Atlanta Police \ndepartment, began screaming at patrons and employees to โhit the floorโ and get \ndown on the ground. \n82.  Several plaintiffs were in terror and feared for their lives, believing \nthat the Eagle was being robbed or invaded by criminals or gay-bashers who might \nkill or injure them. \n83.  Shortly after the Defendant undercover officers inside the Eagle \nordered everyone to lay on the floor, additional Defendant officers of the Atlanta \nPolice Department, including members of the Red Dog Unit, forced their way into \nthe Eagle, also without a search or arrest warrant, without requesting permission or \nconsent to enter the premises, and outside the terms of the Eagleโs invitation to the \npublic.  The Red Dog Unit is a special force of police officers used to โprovide \naggressive police presence in areas that have a high incidence of street drug sales, \n17 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 18 of 46\nuse, and drug related crimes.โ City of Atlanta Police, About Red Dog Unit, \nhttp://www.atlantapd.org/index.asp?nav=RD&menu=42 (last visited Mar. 12, \n2010). \n84.  These additional Defendant officers, many of whom were dressed in \nblack, paramilitary-style uniforms which are not recognizable as police uniforms to \nthose unfamiliar with the Red Dog Unit, stormed into the Eagle with a massive \nshow of force but without verbally identifying themselves as police officers.  They \nscreamed at patrons and employees to lay flat on the floor with their faces against \nthe floor and their hands behind their backs or in front of them and to โshut the \nfuck up.โ   \n85.  Police officers shoved some of the patrons, including some of the \nPatron Plaintiffs, to the ground, and pressed their boots into the back of certain \npatrons, and some patrons were handcuffed by the police. \n86.  Certain patrons, including some of the Patron Plaintiffs, were made to \nlie on the floor in spilled beer and broken glass, and patrons who asked permission \nto move away from the broken glass were told to โstay down and shut the fuck \nup.โ  Some of these patrons received cuts from the glass in which they were forced \nto lie. \n18 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 19 of 46\n87.  During the Raid, patrons were forced to remain flat on the floor, even \nlong after the police officers had searched them and found them to be unarmed. \n88.  Some patrons, including some of the Patron Plaintiffs, who were told \nto move to another part of the Eagle were again made to lay flat on the ground, \nwith their faces against the floor, even after they had been searched, found to be \nunarmed, and moved. \n89.  Patrons, including Patron Plaintiffs were detained, either handcuffed, \nor flat on the ground with their faces against the floor, between thirty minutes and \ntwo-and-a-half hours after the raid began, until they were eventually released one \nby one or in small groups. \n90.  Patrons, including some of the Patron Plaintiffs, who asked questions \nof the police officers, including asking for their names or badge numbers and/or \nwhy they were being detained, were told to โshut the fuck up,โ some were \nthreatened with arrest for disorderly conduct, some were threatened with being \nhandcuffed, some were threatened with violence and physical harm, and some \nwere retaliated against by being forced to remain at the Eagle long after they had \nbeen searched. \n91.  All persons at the Eagle complied fully, promptly, and peacefully with \nall demands made by the officers, no person at the Eagle offered any physical \n19 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 20 of 46\nresistance to the officers whatsoever, and none was charged with obstructing the \nofficers in any way. \n92.  For no legitimate law enforcement purpose, police officers kicked \nsome patrons, including some of the Patron Plaintiffs, who had been forced to lay \non the floor during the Raid. \n93.  During the Raid, police officers kicked down at least one locked door \nat the Eagle (in full sight and sound of nearby patrons) despite the offer by an \nEagle manager to open the door for them. \n94.  During the Raid, police officers broke into and searched a locked, \nnon-public storage area where liquor was stored. \n95.  Officers forcibly and without consent searched patrons, including \nsome of the Patron Plaintiffs, as they lay on the floor, putting their hands in the \npatronsโ pockets and removing keys, cash, wallets, cell phones, driverโs licenses, \nand anything else in the patronsโ pockets, or ordered patrons to empty the contents \nof their pockets onto the floor where they lay. \n96.  Officers took identification documents from every Patron Plaintiff, \neither by forcibly taking the same without consent or by demanding that patrons \nhand over their identification documents.

Based in part on representations by defendantsโ counsel, all Individual \nDefendants other than Richard Pennington and Debra Williams were personally \ninvolved in the planning or execution of the Raid. \n98.  The aforementioned practices in conducting the Raid were done \npursuant to official policy or custom and usage, as admitted by Deputy Chief \nCarlos Banda, in his public statement that everything done at the Eagle was \nstandard practice for Red Dog, which does โthe same thing in each situationโ and \nโ[by the numbers] they do it all the same way, they donโt vary [in how they do it].โ \nCarlos Banda, Deputy Chief, Atlanta Police Depโt, Community Forum at the \nVirginia-Highland Church (Oct. 5, 2009), available at \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjTYf2WHWbw#t=08m43s. In addressing the \npractice of the APD to โdo criminal history checks on everybody, when we hit an \nestablishment, no matter what it is,โ Deputy Chief Banda stated: โAt this point, \nthatโs the policy.โ Id. Deputy Chief Banda also stated that if an APD officer sees a \ncrime being committed in a location, he has probable cause to search โthe whole \nbody [i.e., everyone present], not just one individual.โ Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 22 of 46\n99.  Debra Williams, a Major and senior official with the APD who was in \nultimate command of the Red Dog Unit on September 10-11, 2009, stated publicly \nat a Community Forum at the Virginia-Highland Church on Oct. 5, 2009 that it is \nstandard practice of the APD to take IDs and run ID checks on everyone in an \nestablishment during a โraidโ: โOnce weโre inside a location based on any illegal \nactivity, for the safety of not only the citizens of the City of Atlanta but for the \nsafety of the patrons and the officers, we conduct warrant checks on all the \npatrons, on everyone.โ  When asked about probable cause to run ID checks on the \npatrons, Major Williams referred to probable cause being โbased on the reason for \nbeing there,โ and on โsafety,โ and she commented that, if police did not check the \nIDs of โsubjects that are at the location that we hit, or make an arrest, or in an open \narea also, we allow subjects with warrants, wanted for murder or wanted for other \nthings, to walk away. . . .โ Id.  Williams personally participated in and showed \ndeliberate indifference to the violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional rights by her \nacceptance, acquiescence, and endorsement of these policies. \n100.  As indicated by his comments during a press conference on \nSeptember 14, 2009, Richard Pennington was personally aware of the widespread \npractice within the APD of searching each person at the scene of a โraid,โ and \nperforming ID checks on each person as part of โnormal procedure,โ regardless of \n22 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 23 of 46\nprobable cause or reasonable suspicion, and Pennington personally participated in \nand showed deliberate indifference to the violation of Plaintiffsโ constitutional \nrights by his acceptance, acquiescence, and endorsement of these policies. Richard \nPennington, Chief, Atlanta Police Depโt, Press Conference (Sept. 14, 2009). When \nasked whether officers had โprobable cause to search each and every personโ at the \nEagle during the Raid, or to check their names against a police database, \nPennington replied: โWell, I canโt answer that because, I can only say this, each \nperson would have had to been frisked for the police officersโ safety. . . . Now if \nthey ran the personโs name through, we do that in normal procedures to make sure \nthe person is not wanted.โ Id. And with regard to whether police are required to \nhave consent to search an individual, Pennington replied: โWell, I would say, we \nare required to frisk someone for the safety of the officer. . . .โ Id.   \n101.  Pennington also personally authorized and encouraged the \nunconstitutional searches and seizures of Plaintiffs by personally issuing and \npromulgating official written policy which authorized police officers to conduct \nwarrantless searches without probable cause. See CITY OF ATLANTA, ATLANTA \nPOLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY MANUAL, APD.SOP.3020, ยง 4.3.1(2) SEARCH AND \nSEIZURE (2007) (signed by Richard J.

In sworn testimony before the Atlanta Municipal Court on March 11, \n2010, Defendant Bridges testified that the Red Dog Unit was brought to the \nAtlanta Eagle on the night of the Raid specifically to โhold everyoneโ at the Eagle \nas part of a police department โinvestigation.โ  In other words, Defendant Bridges \nand the other Individual Defendants had already decided to seize everyone present \nat the Eagle before any officer entered the Eagle, had any chance to observe any of \nthe Plaintiffs, or had made any determination with regard to reasonable suspicion \nor probable cause in connection with any of the Plaintiffs.  City of Atlanta v. Kelley \net al., Citation No. 1920907 (Atlanta Mun. Ct. Mar. 11, 2010). \n103.  On information (viz. Richard Pennington, Chief, Atlanta Police Depโt, \nPress Conference (Sept. 14, 2009)) and belief, at least twenty-one officers, were \npresent inside the Eagle on September 10-11, 2009, supported by numerous \nadditional officers outside the Eagle, three Atlanta Police prisoner transport \nvehicles, and numerous police cars and other vehicles.  The true number of officers \ninside and outside the Eagle is not yet known by the Plaintiffs. \n104.  Even after many of the Individual Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Ray were \ntold that they were free to go, and in fact ordered to leave the premises, the \nRaiding Party Defendants continued and prolonged the seizure of plaintiffs by \nblocking their cars preventing their ability to do so by continuing to block their \n24 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 25 of 46\ncars in the parking lot with police vehicles and refusing to move those police \nvehicles when Plaintiffs pointed out that they could not leave. \n105.  During the course of the Raid, police officers searched the premises of \nthe Eagle, including cash registers, beer coolers, the managerโs office, a locked \nliquor storage area, and other private areas. \n106.  Atlanta Police officers also entered the premises of the Rawhide \nLeather store, without a search or arrest warrant, and searched the premises of the \nRawhide Leather store, including the cash register. \n107.  Atlanta Police officers also entered private, nonpublic areas located in \nthe same building as the Eagle without a search or arrest warrant, including the \nprivate office of Ramey & Kelley shareholders Richard Ramey and Robert Kelley, \nand the private residence of Plaintiff Shepherd, who lives in an apartment located \nat the same address as the Eagle. \n108.  Atlanta Police officers entered and searched Plaintiff Shepherdโs \nhome without a search or arrest warrant.   \n109.  Atlanta Police officers arrested Plaintiff Shepherd inside his home \nwithout a search or arrest warrant.  \n110.  No illegal drugs were found on anyone present at the Eagle, Rawhide \nLeather, or in the private home of Plaintiff Shepherd. \n25 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 26 of 46\n111.  No illegal drugs were found on the premises of the Eagle, Rawhide \nLeather, or in the private home of Plaintiff Shepherd. \n112.  Not a single patron of the Eagle or Rawhide Leather was charged with \nany crime.  \n113.  The only charges filed against anyone at the Eagle on the night of the \nRaid were for Atlanta City Code violations relating to alleged unlicensed adult \nentertainment under ATLANTA, GA., CODE ch. 10, art. II, ยง 10-206 (2009), because \nfour dancers were observed, in the words of the arresting officers, allegedly \nโwearing underwearโ and โdancing,โ and ATLANTA, GA., CODE ch. 30, art. III, ยง \n30-55, which is the penalty provision of a city code section on occupational taxes. \nNone of the Plaintiffs, with the exception of Plaintiff Shepherd, was the subject of \nsuch charges. \n114.  A consolidated trial was held on March 11, 2010 for all persons issued \nAtlanta City Code violations on the night of the Raid, as outlined in paragraph 113 \nabove, which trial ended in dismissals and/or acquittals for all defendants, except \nAntonio Benitez, who failed to appear.

Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation in the \nforegoing paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.   \nUnreasonable Seizure \n116.  Defendants had no particularized, reasonable, articulable, or objective \nbasis to suspect that any of the Patron Plaintiffs they seized had committed, or \nwere committing, or were about to commit any criminal offense. \n117.  The detentions of the Individual Plaintiffs were unreasonable seizures \nunder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.   \n118.  Atlanta Police officers had no particularized probable cause to believe \nthat any of the Patron Plaintiffs had committed or were committing any criminal \noffense. \n119.  Each Individual Defendant present during the Raid exercised his/her \nauthority as a police officer to effect the seizure of Plaintiffs. \n27 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 28 of 46\n120.  The seizure of the Individual Plaintiffs was excessive and \nunreasonable in duration and scope. \n121.  The seizure of the Patron Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Ray and Plaintiff \nShepherd constituted an arrest, for which probable cause was required. \n122.  The arrest of the Patron Plaintiffs, Plaintiff Ray and Plaintiff Shepherd \nwas unreasonable. \n123.  Atlanta Police officers intended to confine the Individual Plaintiffs, \ncommitted acts resulting in their confinement, and the Individual Plaintiffs were \naware of their confinement.  The Individual Plaintiffs reasonably did not believe \nthat they were free to leave. \nExcessive Force \n124.  Atlanta police officers used and directed excessive force against the \nPatron Plaintiffs when they were not authorized to utilize any force.   \n125.  Defendantsโ use of force was excessive and unreasonable. \nUnreasonable Search \n126.  Atlanta police officers had no reasonable belief that any of the \nIndividual Plaintiffs was armed and dangerous. \n127.  The pervasive searches of the Patron Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Shepherd \nwere unreasonable. \n28 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 29 of 46\n128.  Atlanta police had neither a warrant, nor probable cause plus exigent \ncircumstances, authorizing a search of any of the Patron Plaintiffs or Plaintiff \nShepherd. \n129.  Each Individual Defendant present during the Raid exercised his/her \nauthority as a police officer to effect the search of Plaintiffs. \n130.  The searches of the Patron Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Shepherd, including \nforcible and unconsented searching of the contents of their pockets, and seizing \npersonal articles including keys, cash, wallets, and driverโs licenses and other \nidentification documents, were unreasonable. \n131.  The search of the personal residence of Plaintiff Shepherd and the \nbusiness premises of Plaintiff Ramey & Kelley, and Plaintiff Rawhide Leather was \nunreasonable.  \n132.  Defendants acted with reckless, deliberate and callous indifference to \nthe constitutionally protected rights of the Plaintiffs. \n133.  Raiding Party Defendants were present during the unreasonable \nsearch and seizure of Plaintiffs and during the application of excessive force to \nPlaintiffs.

It was clearly established on September 10, 2009 that detaining, \narresting, or searching the Patron Plaintiffs, about whom officers had no \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause, simply because they were present at a \nparticular bar, would violate the Patron Plaintiffsโ clearly-established constitutional \nrights.  The Defendants had fair warning that their conduct would violate the \nConstitution, and no reasonable officer could have believed that the detention, \narrest, or search of the Patron Plaintiffs was legal. \n135.  It was clearly established on September 10, 2009 that entering or \nsearching the Eagle or the Rawhide Store in the absence of a warrant or probable \ncause plus exigent circumstances would violate the Corporate Plaintiffsโ clearly-\nestablished constitutional rights.  The Defendants had fair warning that their \nconduct would violate the Constitution, and no reasonable officer could have \nbelieved that the warrantless entry and search of the Eagle or the Rawhide Store \nwas legal. \n136.

The Defendants had fair warning that their \nconduct would violate the Constitution, and no reasonable officer could have \nbelieved that the warrantless arrest of Plaintiff Shepherd in his private home was \nlegal. \n138.  It was clearly established on September 10, 2009 that conducting \nwarrantless raids using mass detentions and searches of patrons and bar premises, \nseizure of patronsโ identity documents, and running warrant checks on all patrons \nwould violate the Plaintiffsโ clearly-established constitutional rights. The \nDefendants had fair warning that their conduct would violate the Constitution and \nany reasonable officer would have known of the binding legal precedent that \nclearly established these rights. \n31 \n\nCase 1:09-cv-03286-TCB   Document 44    Filed 03/17/10   Page 32 of 46\n139.
