    "summary": "<p>On December 6, 2001, a number of healthcare providers and members of the state's Medicaid-established Child Health Management Services (CHMS) program filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas.  Proceeding under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Medicaid Act against the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services (ADHS), the plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the state's proposal to remove certain CHMS programs from the state's Medicaid plan and to cease paying for them violated their substantive and procedural due process rights and the Medicaid Act. Specifically, the state intended to stop paying for CHMS early-intervention day treatment for children who don't have a serious medical problem, but are still considered at risk.  Plaintiffs were represented by private counsel. </p><p>On the same day as they filed their complaint, plaintiffs sought temporary injunctive relief; the state opposed such relief and moved to dismiss the matter altogether for failure to state a claim.  The Court (Judge William R. Wilson) held a four-day trial beginning a week after the complaint was filed, and then, on Dec. 19, 2001, <i>permanently</i> enjoined the state from implementing the proposed spending cuts.  (The court denied the motion for temporary injunctive relief as moot.)  The court held that the Medicaid Act mandated that the state's plan must specifically include in its services early-intervention day treatment.  Judge Wilson announced his ruling from the bench; there is no written opinion.  DHS appealed the decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals that same day. </p><p>On July 15, 2002, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges McMillian, Heaney, and Riley) affirmed that at-risk children have a federal right to early-intervention day treatment when a physician recommends it. However, it reversed the lower court's holding to the extent that it required CHMS early-intervention day treatment services to be specifically included in the state's Medicaid plan. All that is required, the appellate court held, is that the state plan pay part or all of the cost of treatments for conditions discovered by a screening process when those treatments meet the definitions set forth in the Medicaid Act. The case was remanded to the district court with orders to modify its injunction in light of the appellate court's holding, as well as to consider the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim, which the district court initially did not reach in its decision. </p><p>On July 30, 2002, Judge Wilson entered an amended injunction, which did not require the state to specifically include CHMS early-intervention day treatment services in the state plan, but did require it to pay for those services when prescribed by a physician. The state must also inform potential Medicaid recipients about these available services. </p><p>The district court then held a number of hearings on the plaintiffs' procedural and substantive due process claims. On Nov. 27, 2002, Judge Wilson issued an Order and Opinion holding for the plaintiffs on all three of their counts: that the state's proposed plan was in violation of the Medicaid Act; that the state violated plaintiffs' procedural due process by failing to conduct a study about the effect such a change in the program would have had on the efficiency, economy, quality of care, and access to care, as required by the Medicaid Act; and that the state's attempt to move the CHMS services off-plan for cost savings violated plaintiffs' substantive due rights because it \"shocked the conscience.\" </p><p>On December 18, 2002, the Court issued a second Order extending its injunction to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal regulatory authority for the Medicaid program, and ordered that CMS continue to pay federal matching funds to any state expenditure on early-intervention day treatment services, even though CMS was not a party to the suit.</p><p>The state moved to amend the court's judgment and raised the question of whether guidelines published by the Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. (AFMC), the organization contracted by the state to determine the eligibility of CHMS participants, also violated their procedural and substantive due process rights. The plaintiffs requested to amend their complaint to make AFMC a party and directly challenge the legality of those access guidelines. And on Dec. 18, 2002, the Court granted their request. That same day, the state and CMS appealed the Court's Nov. 27, 2002, Order and Opinion to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Throughout 2003 and 2004, the plaintiffs were granted permission to amend their complaint a number of times, which eventually culminated in a fifth amended complaint filed on Jan. 4, 2005.  Meanwhile, on April 16, 2004, the 8th Circuit issued an opinion on the state's and CMS's appeal. It affirmed the lower court's holding that the state violated plaintiffs' procedural due process rights, but reversed district court's decision that the state violated substantive due process rights. It also reversed the district court's enjoining of CMS because the agency wasn't a party to the underlying suit.</p><p>Plaintiffs moved to compel ADHS and AFMC to reveal the names of the peer reviewers responsible for determining when and whether CHMS services are medically necessary. On Nov. 29, 2004, the district court granted the motion. The next month, AFMC appealed the decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.   </p><p>During this period, the district court also considered damages claims against defendants who were current or past high-level supervisors of ADHS. They all moved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity. ADHS contended that it was entitled to absolute immunity under the 11th Amendment because it was an agency of the state of Arkansas. On Feb. 7, 2005, the district court (Judge Wilson) denied all but one of the defendant's motions for summary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity. It was silent as to the ADHS's 11th Amendment claim. The state and remaining defendants appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>On April 17, 2006, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued opinions on both outstanding appeals: AFMC's appeal regarding disclosure of the peer supervisors, and the qualified and absolute immunity claims of the individual defendants and ADHS. The appellate court held that the relevant Medicaid regulations did <i>not</i> require AFMC to reveal the names of its peer supervisors, and so reversed the district court on that count. With regard to the immunity claims, it affirmed the district court's decision rejecting the qualified immunity claims, but ordered that it dismiss ADHS from the suit on 11th Amendment grounds. </p><p>The remaining individual defendants who were not granted qualified immunity appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Apparently the parties settled, because on June 25, 2007, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment because it had become moot.  Selig v. Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 551 U.S. 1142 (2007).</p><p>On Nov. 11, 2008, back in district court, the remaining plaintiffs entered a stipulation of dismissal with the defendants because both sides agreed to an undisclosed settlement agreement. The court then dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>",

At issue was ADHS's plan to remove certain CHMS programs from the state's Medicaid plan, and to stop paying for those services all together. The district court permanently enjoined the state from stopping payment on those services. A number of appeals followed, but that core injunction still held. Eventually, plaintiffs settled with defendants in November 2008 and the court dismissed all remaining claims.",

Arkansas has provided services to\nspecial  needs  children  under  its  Child  Health  Management  Services  (CHMS)\nprogram, a comprehensive program that provides evaluation and therapy in a multi-\ndisciplinary clinical setting.  In November of 2001, the Arkansas Department of\nHuman Services (ADHS) announced that it would significantly alter the program,\nremoving its therapeutic and early intervention day treatment services.  The district\ncourt1 previously enjoined Arkansas from making such changes, and we affirmed in\npart, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.  See Pediatric Specialty\nCare, Inc. v. Ark. Dep’t of Human Servs., 293 F.3d 472 (8th Cir. 2002).  On remand,\nthe district court found that the proposed changes would result in a denial of\nprocedural and substantive due process, and ordered the services to continue without\nany changes.  ADHS now appeals the district court’s adverse rulings on these claims.\n1The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Arkansas.\n-3-\n\nWe affirm the district court’s ruling that ADHS may not alter the CHMS program\nuntil it conducts an impact study to ensure that the changes are consistent with the\nprinciples of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and access to care.  On the basis\nof the record before us, however, we reverse the district court’s ruling as to the\nsubstantive due process claim. \n \nThe federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was not a party\nto the suit below.  Nonetheless, the district court ordered it to continue to subsidize\nthe services that ADHS was providing.  CMS appeals, and we reverse.\nBACKGROUND\nMuch of the historical background to this case was detailed in our prior\ndecision.  See Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 293 F.3d at 475-77.  As part of its state\nMedicaid plan,2 Arkansas has provided medical services to special needs children\nunder the CHMS program.  The program extends diagnostic and evaluative services,\npediatric day treatment, and various therapies to children from six months to six years\nof age.  In November of 2001, ADHS issued a press release announcing its intention\nto restructure the CHMS program, terminating day treatment and therapeutic services\nfrom the plan.\nIn response to this decision, Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., a provider of CHMS\nservices, along with other CHMS providers and parents of recipients of CHMS\nservices (collectively the Plaintiffs), brought suit seeking to bar ADHS from changing\n2Medicaid has been defined as “a cooperative federal-state program through\nwhich the Federal Government provides financial assistance to States so that they\nmay furnish medical care to needy individuals.”  Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S.\n498, 502 (1990).  While participation in Medicaid is voluntary, states that choose to\nparticipate must comply with the requirements for state plans as outlined in 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a.  Ark. Med. Soc’y v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 522 (8th Cir. 1993).\n-4-\n\nthe CHMS program.  The district court found that the Medicaid Act3 entitled children\nto an enforceable right to early intervention day treatment services, and that such\nservices were currently provided under the CHMS program.  It further found, that\nalthough such services would still be available if recommended by a physician,\ncutting the CHMS program would inhibit the ability of children to readily receive the\ntreatment they needed.  Accordingly, the district court enjoined ADHS from changing\nthe program and ordered it to continue to include CHMS early intervention day\ntreatment services in its state Medicaid plan.\nOn appeal, our court agreed that children are entitled to day treatment under the\nMedicaid Act.  Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc, 293 F.3d at 480.  We reversed, however,\nthe district court’s holding “to the extent that it requires CHMS early intervention day\ntreatment services be specifically included in the State Plan.”  Id.  We reasoned that\nalthough the Medicaid Act required early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and\ntreatment (EPSDT) services to be provided as part of the participating state’s plan,\nid. at 479, those services need not be specifically or expressly listed, id. at 480.\nRather, it was sufficient that ADHS continue to provide CHMS-like services when\nprescribed by a physician, without keeping the actual CHMS program.  Id. at 480-81.\nWe remanded the case for modification of the injunction and consideration of the\nPlaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.  Id. at 481.\nOn remand, the district court held further proceedings to consider the Plaintiffs’\nprocedural and substantive due process claims.  By order dated November 27, 2002,\nthe district court found that by seeking to terminate elements of the CHMS program,\nADHS made a decision affecting payment of services.  According to the district court,\nthis invoked 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), which mandates that changes in methods\nand procedures of payment must be consistent with the principles of economy,\nefficiency, quality of care, and equal access.  Since ADHS had done nothing to\n342 U.S.C §§ 1396-1396v.\n-5-\n\ndetermine the effect that terminating elements of the CHMS program would have on\nthese principles, the district court enjoined ADHS from terminating the program until\nit completed an impact study.  The district court further found that for a number of\nyears, Arkansas had been trying to curtail its early intervention day treatment services\nprogram.  The court noted that the decision seemed to be based on improper\nmotivations, and would result in a loss of medical services for needy children.\nFinding that such conduct shocked the conscience, the court enjoined ADHS from\nrestructuring the CHMS program or moving CHMS-like services “off-plan.”4  On\nDecember 18, 2002, the district court extended its injunction to CMS, specifically\nrequiring CMS to continue to provide federal funding for the CHMS program.\nADHS appeals, arguing that they should not be required to complete any study\nbefore changing the CHMS program.  With regard to the substantive due process\nmatter, ADHS notes that this issue was not remanded to the district court, and\nsuggests that our prior opinion permitting ADHS to terminate elements of the CHMS\nprogram precluded the district court from ordering the plan to continue.  It further\nargues that its decision to restructure the CHMS program is supported by a rational\nbasis and thus no substantive due process violation would arise from the change.\nCMS appeals the extension of any injunction to it because it was never a party to the\nunderlying action and did not act in concert with ADHS.\nANALYSIS\nWe review the grant of injunctive relief for an abuse of discretion.  Randolph\nv. Rodgers, 170 F.3d 850, 856 (8th Cir. 1999).  We must necessarily consider the\n4“Off-plan” and “off-planning”  are terms used by the parties to refer to\ntermination of the CHMS program from the state Medicaid plan, recognizing that the\nstate would still be obligated to pay for CHMS-like services even though the services\nare not specifically listed in the state plan.  (See, e.g., Tr. of Sept. 12, 2002,\nEvidentiary Hr’g at 84-85.)\n-6-\n\npredicate facts and law to determine if the district court abused its discretion by\nordering relief at all.  See, e.g., FDIC v. Bell, 106 F.3d 258, 262-63 (8th Cir. 1997).\nA district court abuses its discretion if it issues an injunction based on an incorrect\nunderstanding of the law or reliance on clearly erroneous factual determinations.\nRandolph, 170 F.3d at 856.  \nI. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS\nOn remand, the district court held that ADHS violated the tenets of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A), often referred to as the “equal access provision” of the Medicaid\nAct, see Ark. Med. Soc’y Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 522 (8th Cir. 1993), by\nattempting to alter the CHMS program without first considering how efficiency,\neconomy, quality of care, and access to care would be affected.  It enjoined ADHS\nfrom changing the program until an impact study considering these principles was\ncompleted.\nAt the outset, we dispose of ADHS’s argument that the equal access provision\nof the Medicaid Act cannot support the Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim\nbecause it does not create any constitutionally-recognized property interest.  It is well\nestablished that “[t]he Fourteenth Amendment’s procedural protection of property is\na safeguard of the security interests that a person has already acquired in specific\nbenefits.”  Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576 (1972).  “Property interests,\nof course, are not created by the Constitution.  Rather, they are created and their\ndimensions  are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\nindependent source such as state law–rules or understandings that secure certain\nbenefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.”  Id. at 577; accord\nGoldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 261-62 (1970) (recognizing that federal and state\nregulatory frameworks had created a constitutional property interest in continued\nreceipt  of  welfare  benefits).    Over  ten  years  ago,  our  court  held  that\n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A) created enforceable rights for Medicaid recipients and providers.\n-7-\n\nArk. Med. Soc’y, 6 F.3d at 528.  We find it entirely appropriate for the Plaintiffs to\nbase their procedural due process claim on their clearly established right to have\nequal access to quality medical care as defined by § 1396a(a)(30)(A).\nSection 1396a(a)(30)(A) requires that state Medicaid plans employ “methods\nand procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services”\nas necessary to “assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and\nquality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services\nare available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are\navailable to the general population in the geographic area.”  ADHS suggests that this\nstatute does not apply since the rate it will pay each provider will remain the same.\nWhile the particular rate of payment for  each  provider may remain the same,\n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A) concerns not only the rate, but also the method and process of\npayment for services.5  The district court found that termination of parts of the CHMS\nprogram would result in a change in the level and method of payment for some\nservices.  We agree.  In fact, it is difficult to discern how a decision to eliminate\ncomponents of the CHMS program, but continue to pay for CHMS-like services, is\nanything but a change in the methods and procedures for payment of such services.\n“[T]he remedy for a procedural due process violation is defined by the extent\nof the injury that resulted from the denial of constitutionally required process.”\nHopkins v. Saunders, 199 F.3d 968, 979 (8th Cir. 1999) (citing Carey v. Piphus, 435\nU.S. 247, 263-64 (1978)).  Since this case involves a prospective due process\nviolation, we look to whether the injunction adequately addresses what would\n5ADHS directs us to 42 C.F.R. § 447.205 in support of its position.  We\nrecognize that this regulation requires state Medicaid agencies to provide public\nnotice of proposed changes in its methods for setting payment rates.  We fail to see\nhow this is inconsistent with our view that changes to the methods and procedures\nrelated to payment, as opposed to payment rates, also implicate the principles detailed\nin the equal access provision of the Medicaid Act.\n-8-\n\notherwise be a denial of the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  The district court held\nthat “[b]efore the Defendants can terminate Medicaid payment for [CHMS] services,\nthey must conduct a proper study and assure the citizens of Arkansas that the factors\nof economy, efficiency, quality of care and equal access will not be jeopardized.”\n(Dist. Ct. Order of November 27, 2002, at 12.)  Such an order permits the procedural\ndue process issue to be revisited following completion of the study while remaining\ntrue to the Medicaid Act’s equal access provision.  We find no error in the injunction\nas so limited.\nII. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS\nThe district court found that ADHS sought to terminate portions of the CHMS\nprogram for improper reasons and that this decision would result in a loss of service\nfor developmentally delayed children.  ADHS’s consistent attempts to neglect the\nneeds of developmentally delayed children and its proposed restructuring of the\nCHMS program “shock[ed] the conscience of the court” (Dist. Ct. Order of Nov. 27,\n2002, at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted)), resulting in a substantive due\nprocess violation.  It thus enjoined ADHS from changing the CHMS program, or\nmoving CHMS-like services “off-plan” at all.\nWe must first determine whether the district court’s substantive due process\nruling  has  exceeded  the  contours  of  our  remand.    In  our  earlier  opinion,  we\n“reverse[d] the district court’s holding to the extent that it require[d] that CHMS early\nintervention day treatment services be specifically included in the State [Medicaid]\nPlan.”  Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 293 F.3d at 480.  We permitted ADHS to\nterminate the CHMS program because it was obligated to keep paying for CHMS-like\nservices under the Medicaid Act.  Id.  We then remanded the matter to the district\ncourt with instructions to “consider the plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.”  Id.\nat 481.  We did not provide any direction to the district court as to the Plaintiffs’\nsubstantive due process claim.\n-9-\n\nIt is well settled that when a matter is decided by this court, it becomes the law\nof the case; the district court is not free on remand to reconsider any question finally\ndisposed of by the court of appeals.  Klein v. Arkoma Prod. Co., 73 F.3d 779, 784-85\n(8th Cir. 1996).  The district court remains free, however, to decide any issue “not\nexpressly or impliedly disposed of on appeal.”  In re Usery, 242 B.R. 450, 457\n(B.A.P. 8th Cir. 1999) (citing Paull v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., 313 F.2d 612,\n617 (8th Cir. 1963)).  In our prior opinion, the issue presented was whether “the\nMedicaid Act requires Arkansas to provide early intervention day treatment services,”\nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 293 F.3d at 480, since the district court had specifically\nlimited its earlier ruling to the question of the Plaintiffs’ rights under the Medicaid\nAct,  see  Pediatric  Specialty  Care,  Inc.,  v.  Ark.  Dep’t  of  Human  Servs.,  No.\n4:01CV00830WRW, slip op. at 14 (E.D. Ark. Dec. 18, 2001) (“Because I find in\nfavor of the plaintiffs on the federal statutory claim, I do not need to address the\nprocedural  and  substantive  due  process  claims  made  by  the  plaintiff.”).    Our\ninstruction to the district court to consider the Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim\non remand did not restrict its decision to only that matter.  The Plaintiffs’ substantive\ndue process claim remained unresolved, and it was within the province of the district\ncourt to entertain that claim on remand.\nUnder the rubric of the substantive due process clause, the Constitution\nprohibits “‘the government from engaging in conduct that shocks the conscience or\ninterferes with rights implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.’”  Moran v. Clarke,\n296 F.3d 638, 643 (8th Cir. 2002) (quoting Weiler v. Purkett, 137 F.3d 1047, 1051\n(8th Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\nThus, substantive due process claims are analyzed under two tests.\nFirst, the state is forbidden from infringing certain “fundamental” liberty\ninterests  at  all–no  matter  what  process  is  provided–unless  the\ninfringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\nSecond, the state’s conduct must shock the conscience or otherwise\n-10-\n\noffend our judicial notions of fairness, or must be offensive to human\ndignity.\nBrown v. Nix, 33 F.3d 951, 953 (8th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).\nThe Plaintiffs’ claim does not fall within the first of these categories, for such\nclaims are typically limited to rights that are constitutionally rooted and considered\nfundamental.  See Putnam v. Keller, 332 F.3d 541, 548 (8th Cir. 2003) (detailing the\nrights recognized by the Supreme Court as giving rise to substantive due process\nclaims).  The question then is whether ADHS engaged in such egregious conduct that\nit rightly shocked the district court’s judicial conscience.  The district court found that\nfor years ADHS had been trying to curtail the services to special needs children for\nunsound reasons.  We share the district court’s concern about such conduct, and\nreiterate that “[t]he state may not shirk its responsibilities to Medicaid recipients” by\nmaking services difficult for recipients to access.  Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc., 293\nF.3d at 481.  In our prior opinion, however, we recognized that ADHS was seeking\nto restructure the CHMS program in part “[d]ue to a budget shortfall.”  Id. at 476.\nTestimony and exhibits established that Arkansas expected to realize a four to six\nmillion dollar savings by cutting the program.  ADHS has unequivocally stated that\nit would keep paying for CHMS-like services “off-plan.”  In fact, it is specifically\nrequired to keep providing these services pursuant to our prior opinion.  See id. at\n480-81 (holding that ADHS must continue to provide CHMS-like services, including\nday treatment therapeutic services, under the Medicaid Act’s early and periodic\nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment mandate).   Given these circumstances, we simply\ncannot affirm an injunction based on the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim,\nand reverse the district court on that point.  We stress that this decision is independent\nof our prior ruling that the Plaintiffs enjoyed a right to CHMS-like services under the\nMedicaid Act; ADHS remains bound by that ruling, and this opinion should not be\nread to absolve ADHS of that responsibility.  We further note that if ADHS chooses\nto perform the impact study required by the district court and affirmed herein, new\n-11-\n\nissues may come to light as to whether cutting CHMS services would then result in\na substantive due process violation.  That issue is not before us now, and this opinion\nshould not be read as precluding the Plaintiffs from raising such matters at the\nappropriate time.\nIII.  CMS’S APPEAL\nFollowing  issuance  of  its  order  granting  the  Plaintiffs’  request  for  an\ninjunction, the district court issued a second order extending the injunction to CMS.\nThe order required CMS to continue providing Federal Financial Participation6 for\nCHMS services.  CMS was never a party to the underlying action and did not file any\ndocuments with the district court seeking to void the order.  Instead, it appealed\ndirectly to us.  The Plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal because CMS did not\nintervene below, and this court denied the motion by order dated March 28, 2003.\nThe Plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration.  Having fully considered the matter,\nwe again deny the motion to dismiss because although CMS did not intervene below,\nit is directly and adversely affect by the injunction.  In re Piper Funds, Inc., 71 F.3d\n298, 300-01 (8th Cir. 1995); see also Jenkins v. Missouri, 967 F.2d 1245, 1247 (8th\nCir. 1992) (stating “a non party may appeal an injunction that purports to bind the non\nparty”).\nThe district court extended its earlier injunction regarding the CHMS program\nto CMS pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  But this rule merely binds\ninjunctions on parties and “those persons in active concert or participation with\nthem.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d).  We fail to see how CMS could be considered to have\nworked in concert with ADHS to terminate the CHMS program.  CMS is the federal\n6According to CMS, Federal Financial Participation equates to “essentially\nfederal matching funds” for state programs.  (CMS Br. at 19.)  For a detailed\ndescription of the method by which states receive such payment, see 42 U.S.C. §\n1396b.\n-12-\n\nregulatory authority for the Medicaid program, and is in charge of assuring that states\ncomply with the requirements of the Medicaid Act.  In that capacity, CMS and ADHS\ncorresponded about ADHS’s desire to change its state Medicaid plan, and CMS\neventually agreed to allowed that CHMS-like services be moved “off-plan.”  The fact\nthat CMS approved termination of the CHMS program, however, does not transform\nit  into  an  active  participant  in  the  decision.    Rather,  CMS’s  role  as  federal\nadministrator of the Medicaid program appears supervisory.  This conclusion is\nbuttressed by CMS’s ability to withhold Federal Financial Participation in the event\nof a state’s noncompliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Act.7  Since CMS\nwas not a party to the underlying action and did not actively participate in the\ndecision to terminate the CHMS program within the meaning of Rule 65, we reverse\nthe injunction as it extends to CMS.8\nCONCLUSION\nThe  district  court  enjoined  Arkansas,  through  its  Department  of  Human\nServices, from restructuring its Child Health Management Services program, due to\nprocedural and substantive due process concerns.  We affirm the district court insofar\nas it ordered Arkansas to continue the program until a full impact study on the effect\nof terminating the program is completed.  Because the Plaintiffs remain the prevailing\nparties in their action against ADHS, we affirm the district court’s award of costs and\n7We note that if the injunction were to stand against CMS, the district court\nwould have usurped CMS’s authority to deny payment for CHMS services, even if\nADHS were not entitled to the money due to noncompliance.\n8The practical effect of this ruling may be nominal, since at oral argument the\nparties agreed that CMS had always paid its share for CHMS services, and CMS\naffirmed that it had no intention to cut off Federal Financial Participation for state\nclaims.\n-13-\n\nattorney fees.9  On the basis of the current record, we reverse the district court’s\ninjunction as it related to the Plaintiffs’ substantive due process claim and as it\nextended  to  the  Center  for  Medicare  &  Medicaid  Services.    We  remand  for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\nBYE, Circuit Judge, concurring.\nI fully endorse our analysis and conclusions in resolving this appeal.  I write\nto reiterate the district court's findings of fact which Pediatric I left undisturbed and\nwhich therefore continue to inform the law of the case.  See Pediatric Specialty Care,\nInc. v. Ark. Dep't of Human Servs., 293 F.3d 472, 479 (8th Cir. 2002) (\"Upon review\nof the entire record, we find that the district court's factual findings regarding CHMS\nservices are not clearly erroneous.\").\nFirst, CHMS clinics are the sole providers of early intervention day treatment\nservices in the state of Arkansas.  Id. at 481.  Second, \"therapy services not provided\nin conjunction with CHMS day treatment services will not result in the maximum\nreduction of [recipients'] developmental disabilities or restoration of their best\nfunctional level, as is mandated by § 1396d(a)(13)\" of the Medicaid Act.  Id. at 479.\nIt follows non-CHMS providers lack the capacity to provide the combination of day\ntreatment and therapy services so as to satisfy the statutory mandate.  \nOn the other hand, CHMS clinics do provide such a combination of services.\nId.  Consequently, while the Arkansas Department of Human Services (ADHS) can\ntheoretically comply with its statutory mandate by providing CHMS-like services\nthrough  any  provider,  in  practice  ADHS  must  continue  using  CHMS  clinics\n9ADHS did not challenge the amount awarded by the district court, but rather\nsought an order vacating the award in its entirety in the event that it prevailed on\nappeal.\n-14-\n\nthemselves, at least until such a time as other similarly equipped providers become\navailable.  See id. at 481 (\"Because CHMS clinics are the only providers of early\nintervention day treatment, Arkansas must reimburse those clinics.\").  In turn, any\nstudy of ADHS's proposal to shift services off-plan will necessarily evaluate the\nimpact on CHMS clinics and their ability to continue providing day treatment and\ntherapy services in a manner that complies with the statutory mandate. \nIn summary, § 1396d(a)(13) imposes certain requirements on ADHS, and only\nCHMS  clinics  provide  day  treatment  and  therapy  services  meeting  those\nrequirements.  To comply with the injunction here affirmed and also stay within its\nstatutory mandate, therefore, ADHS must study the impact of its proposal on CHMS\nclinics.\n______________________________  \n-15-",

The Swindle \nfamily resides in Pulaski County, Arkansas. \n7.  Plaintiff Susann Crespino is the mother of Michael Crespino, a minor and \nqualified recipient under the CHMS program.  The Crespino family resides in Marion County, \nArkansas. \n8.  Defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"DHS\") is an agency of the \nState of Arkansas. \n9.  Defendant Kurt Knickrehm is Director of the Arkansas Department of Human \nServices and, based on information and reasonable belief, is a resident of Pulaski County, \nArkansas. \n10.  Defendant Ray Hanley is Director of the Division of Medical Services of the \nArkansas Department of Human Services and, based on information and reasonable belief, is a \nresident of Pulaski County, Arkansas. \n11.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nand contend that the defendants have violated their federal constitutional and statutory rights \nwith regard to their planned termination of funding of the CHMS program which currently exists \nunder the Arkansas Medicaid plan. \n12.  The Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, civil \nrights jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343, and venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nFACTS PRESENTED· \n13.  Title XIX ofthe Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seg. (1992 & Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is a federal-state cooperative program \ndesigned to provide \"medical assistance\" to persons whose income and resources are insufficient \n3 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 1    Filed 12/06/01   Page 4 of 8\nto meet the costs of medical care.  The program is financed by both the federal and state \ngovermnents. \n14.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to the \nHealth Care Financing Administration. \n15.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and DHS is the state agency \ncharged with administration of the Medicaid program in Arkansas. \n16.  Under the Medicaid program, if a State agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that \nsatisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal govermnent will pay a specified percentage of \nthe total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n17.  Federal law requires that in setting reimbursement rates for medical providers \nenrolled in the Medicaid program, the rates must be sufficient to assure efficiency, economy, and \nquality of care, and sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available \nunder the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general \npopulation.  There is a binding obligation on each state to utilize methods and procedures which \nconsider these factors in setting reimbursement rates. \n18.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but once a State chooses to \nparticipate, it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements. \n19.  The Medicaid Act defines \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\".  As a general matter, a State may choose which \nenumerated services to provide, but some services are mandated for most categories of needy \npersons who receive services under the plan. \n20.  Essentially, there are three categories of potential recipients under the Medicaid \nAct:  the \"categorically needy\", the \"medically needy\", and those whose needs are determined in \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 1    Filed 12/06/01   Page 5 of 8\nreference to the poverty level. \n21.  A State plan must provide \"medical assistance\" to the \"categorically needy\", but \nmay choose whether to provide services to the \"medically needy\". \n22.  Among those services for the \"categorically needy\"is early and periodic \nscreening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") for qualified recipients under the age of \n21. \n23.  The CHMS program is set forth under that part of the State plan designated for the \n\"categorically needy\" and under that part of the State plan which relates specifically to EPSDT. \n24.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n25.  On November 30, 2001, the defendants announced a decision they have made to \nredefine the CHMS program and no longer pay for day treatment and therapy services (referred \nto herein as \"the decision\").  According to a press release issued by the defendants, the decision \nwill change how services are delivered to children who do not have serious medical problems but \nwho nonetheless are considered at risk. \n26.  The decision was made by defendants Knickrehm and Hanley while acting under \ncolor of state law. \n27.  The plaintiffs, and all other providers, children, and families involved in the \nCHMS program, will suffer extreme injury, loss, and hardship if the decision is not enjoined. \nCOUNT ONE:  SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n28.  Services currently provided under the CHMS program are mandatory and cannot \nbe limited by the defendants. \n29.  If implemented, the decision will eliminate mandatory services currently provided \nunder the CHMS program. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 1    Filed 12/06/01   Page 6 of 8\n30.  The decision is arbitrary, capricious, and truly irrational, and shocks traditional \nnotions of justice under the law. \n31.  By making the decision, the defendants have violated the plaintiffs' rights to \nsubstantive due process under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \nCOUNT TWO:  PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n32.  If implemented, the decision will result in a zero-dollar reimbursement for day \ntreatment and therapy services provided under the CHMS program. \n33.  If implemented, the decision will severely limit the quality of care offered by \nCHMS providers and have a devastating impact on the level of efficiency and economy which \ncurrently exists in the CHMS program. \n34.

The third party plaintiffs assert against Tommy Thompson, Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in his official capacity; and Mark McClellan, \nAdministrator, CMS, in his official capacity, a claim for federal financial participation for \nmedical assistance payments for Child Health Management Services (\"CHMS\") that are \nrequired by orders of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, \nopinions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, or both, and which \nwould  not  be  made  but  for  such  orders  and  opinions,  regardless  of whether  such \npayments conform to one or more of the following:  (1) Title XIX of the Social Security \nAct  (\"Medicaid\");  (2)  Medicaid  regulations;  (3)  The  Arkansas  Medicaid  State  Plan \napproved by CMS. \nSTATEMENT OF JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n1. Plaintiffs are various Arkansas corporations and individuals. \n2. Defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is an agency of \nthe executive branch of the State of Arkansas, a sovereign entity. \n2 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 169    Filed 07/06/04   Page 3 of 6\n3. Defendants Knickrehm and Jeffus in their official capacities are officials of the \nADHS. \n4.  Defendant Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care (\"A FMC\") is  an Arkansas \nCorporation  with  its  principal  place  of business  in  Fort  Smith,  Arkansas.  AFMC \nperforms Medicaid utilization reviews under contract with ADHS to determine whether \nto authorize CHMS care. \n5. Third party defendant United States Department of Health and Human Services \nCenter for  Medicare and Medicaid  Services  (\"CMS\")  is  a Department of the  United \nStates  of America;  Tommy Thompson is  Secretary of the  Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and Mark McClellan is Administrator, CMS. \n6. Plaintiff has filed a second amended complaint, a copy of which is attached as \nExhibit A.  Among other things, plaintiffs allege that CHMS is medically necessary by \nvirtue  of being  prescribed,  but  that  in  the  course  of performing  utilization  reviews, \nAFMC denies substantial amounts of requested care. Plaintiffs seek a determination that \nsuch denials are in violation of various alleged federal and constitutional rights; and pray \nfor  an  order  directing  AFMC  to  determine  that  all  prescribed  CHMS  is  medically \nnecessary and to automatically approve such care. \n7. The Court has jurisdiction over third party claims as they arise under federal \nlaw. \n8. The Court has jurisdiction of claims against the United States under 28 U.S.c. \n§ 1346 (a)(2). \n9. Venue is proper in the Eastern District of Arkansas under 28 U.S.C.1402 (a). \n3 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 169    Filed 07/06/04   Page 4 of 6\n, \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n10.  Medicaid is  a joint federal-state  program to  provide  medical assistance to \npersons whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of such care. \nII. Medicaid is  financed by state and federal  funds.  The proportion of federal \nfunds is determined separately for each state by application of a formula, the product of \nwhich is the federal medical assistance percentage for that state.  In Arkansas, CMS pays \napproximately seventy-five percent of the cost of medical assistance. \n12.  In order to receive federal Medicaid funding, each state must submit a state \nMedicaid plan to CMS, receive CMS approval of the plan, operale lhe slale's Medicaid \nprogram in compliance with Medicaid laws and regulations, and in conformity with the \napproved Medicaid State Plan. \n13.  The complaint concerns CHMS, a service for children under the Arkansas \nStale Medicaid Plan. \n14.  Third  party  plaintiffs  contracted  with  AFMC  to  determine  the  medical \nnecessity of CHMS.  Under the  contract, AFMC  issues prior approvals for medically \nnecessary CHMS for Medicaid eligible children and denies prior approvals for CHMS \nthat is not medically necessary. \n15. The Medicaid child health program (Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, \nand  Treatment,  or  \"EPSDT\")  requires  that  in  order  to  qualify  for  Medicaid \nreimbursement, EPSDT services must be necessary. \n16.42 U.S.C. § 1396a (a)(30)(A) requires states to implement effective methods \nand procedures limiting Medicaid payments under the State Plan to medically necessary \ncare. \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 169    Filed 07/06/04   Page 5 of 6\n, \n17. Failure by a state to conform to the State Medicaid Plan approved by CMS \nsubjects the state to loss of federal Medicaid funding. \n18.  Payments made in the absence of effective methods to prevent payment for \nunnecessary care generally are not entitled to federal matching funds. \n19. The Arkansas Medicaid State Plan, Attachment 3.1-A, p.  Ii (for categorically \nneedy recipients) and Attachment 3.1-8, p. 2h (for medically needy recipients) provide \nthat \"CHMS treatment requires prior authorization to determine and verify the patient's \nneed for CHMS services.\"  Accordingly, prior authorization must determine and verify \nmedical  necessity  in  order  for  Arkansas  to  remain  in  compliance  with  its  approved \nMedicaid State Plan and thus remain eligible for federal Medicaid funds. \n20.  Federal Medicaid funding  is necessary for  Arkansas to  continue providing \nMedicaid in general, and CHMS in particular. \n21.  Unless CMS is made a party hereto, it may not be enjoined to provide federal \nfinancial  participation  for  CHMS  provided  in  the  absence  of prior authorization that \ndetermines and verifies medical necessity for CHMS. \n22.  Unless CMS is made a party hereto, it may not be enjoined to provide federal \nfinancial participation for CHMS provided in the absence of effective utilization controls. \nCLAIM \n23.  CMS is liable to the third party plaintiff for the  federal  medical assistance \npercentage of Medicaid funds that are paid as a consequence of this litigation. \n24. Any decree causing the third party plaintiff to pay for medically unnecessary \ncare or to suspend activities to determine and verify medical necessity as required by the \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 169    Filed 07/06/04   Page 6 of 6\napproved State Medicaid Plan will require federal action and cooperation to effectuate. \n25. Joinder of CMS as a third party defendant is necessary in order to give effect \nto any order entered in favor of plaintiff. \nWHEREFORE, third party defendants pray that any relief rendered in favor of \nplaintiff include a determination that CMS  is  liable to  the third party plaintiff for the \nfederal medical assistance percentage of Medicaid funds that are paid as a consequence \nof such relief. \nRespectfully submitted, \nARKANSAS DEPARTMENT \nOF HUMAN SERVICES \nd  .4'/7/-/ \n/~~--\nBy: \nBreck G.

PlaintiffSusann Crespino is the mother of Michael Crespino, a minor and \nqualified recipient under the CHMS program.  The Crespino family resides in Marion County, \nArkansas. \n6.  Defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is an agency of \nthe State of Arkansas. \n7.  Defendant Kurt Knickrehm is Director of the Arkansas Department of Human \nServices and, based on information and reasonable belief, is a resident of Pulaski County, \nArkansas. \n8.  Defendant Ray Hanley is Director of the Division of Medical Services of the \nArkansas Department of Human Services and, based on information and reasonable belief, is a \nresident of Pulaski County, Arkansas. \nn\n9.  Defendant Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care, Inc. (nAFMc ) is an Arkansas \ncorporation and has its principal place of business in Sebastian County, Arkansas. \n10.  The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nand contend that the defendants have violated their federal constitutional and statutory rights with \nregard to actions they have taken with respect to the provision of CHMS services under the \nArkansas Medicaid plan. \n11.  The Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, civil \nrights jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 1343. and venue pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 1391. \nF ACTS PRESENTED \n3 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 4 of 18\n12.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. (1992 &  Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is a federal-state cooperative program \ndesigned to provide \"medical assistance\" to persons whose income and resources are insufficient \nto meet the costs of medical care.  The program is financed by both the federal and state \ngovernments. \n13..  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \n14.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and ADHS is the state agency \ncharged witll administration of the Medicaid program in Arkansas. \n15.  Under the Medicaid program, if a State agrees to establish a Medicaid plan that \nsatisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specitied percentage of \nthe total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n16.  Federal law requires that in setting reimbursement rates for medical providers \nenrolled in the Medicaid program, the rates must be sufficient to assure efficiency, economy, and \nquality of care, and sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available \nunder the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general \npopulation.  There is a binding obligation on each state to utilize methods and procedures which \nconsider these factors in setting reimbursement rates. \n17.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but once a State chooses to \nparticipate, it must comply with federal statutory and regulatory requirements. \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 5 of 18\n18.  The Medicaid Act defines \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\".  As a general matter, a State may choose which \nenumerated services to provide, but some services are mandated for most categories of needy \npersons who receive services under the plan. \n19.  Essentially, there are three categories of potential recipients under the Medicaid \nAct:  the \"categorically needy\", the \"medically needy\", and those whose needs are determined in \nreference to the poverty level. \n20.  A State plan must provide \"medical assistance\" to the \"categorically needy\", but \nmay choose whether to provide services to the \"medically needy\". \n21.  Among those services for the \"categorically needy\"is early and periodic screening, \ndiagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") for qualified recipients under the age of 21. \n22.  The CHMS program is set forth under that part of the State plan designated for the \n\"categorically needy\" and under that part of the State plan which relates specifically to EPSDT. \n23.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n24.  On November 30,2001, the defendants announced a decision they have made to \nredefine the CHMS program and no longer pay for day treatment and therapy services (referred \nto herein as \"the decision\").  According to a press release issued by the defendants, the decision \nwill change how services are delivered to children who do not have serious medical problems but \nwho nonetheless are considered at risk. \n25.  The plaintiffs, and all other providers, children, and families involved in the \nCHMS program, will suffer extreme injury, loss, and hardship if the decision is not enjoined. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 6 of 18\n26.  The CHMS program comprises an array of clinic services that are intended to \nprovide full medical multi-discipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for the purpose of \nintervention, treatment, and prevention of long-term disability for eligible recipients. \n27.  Services under the CHMS program are designed for children who have the most \nsignificant medical and developmental diagnoses, and for those who present with multiple, \ncomplex conditions.  Thousands of children are enrolled in the CHMS program at any given \ntime. \n28.  Generally stated, services under the CHMS program can be broken down into \nthree broad categories:  diagnosis and evaluation services, therapy services, and early \nintervention day treatment services. \n29.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, a child could enter the program \nbased on a referral from his or her physician (referred to in Medicaid te=s as a Primary Care \nPhysician or \"PCP\").  Diagnostic and evaluation services were provided at the CHMS clinic. \nCHMS staff developed a treatment plan, and the treatment plan was approved by the PCP.  The \ntreatment plan included therapy services provided in conjunction with early intervention day \ntreatment services designed to result in the maximum reduction of the child's physical and \nmental disabilities. \n30.  Initially, payment for CHMS services was fairly straightforward.  Services \nprovided wIder the treatment plan were billed by procedures codes, and payment was equal to the \namount of time spent in providing the particular service multiplied by the rate for that service \nestablished by ADHS.  Given the nature of this fo=ula, ADHS could reduce payment for CHMS \nservices by limiting the amount of services that could be provided, or by reducing rates. \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 7 of 18\n31.  In the beginning, however, and as previously stated, the amount of services \nprovided to a child was based on the treatment plan developed by the CHMS clinic and approved \nby the PCP.  The only part of the payment formula controlled by ADHS was the rate. \n32.  The amount of therapy services provided to a child depended on the child's \nparticular disabilities.  Therapy services could include physical therapy, speech therapy, \noccupational therapy, or psychotherapy, or a combination thereof \n33.  As for early intervention day treatment services (referred to in Medicaid terms as \n\"core services \"), children generally received a minimum of six hours of core services per day, \nfive days per week.  ADHS routinely reimbursed providers for that amount of core treatment at \nthe rates it established for such services. \n34.  In the fall of 1997, payment for core services was approximately $125.00 per child \nper day.  ADHS, in an effort to reduce payments under the CHMS program, asked CHMS \nproviders if the rates for core services could be reduced or handled in such a way so as to make \nthe program less expensive. \n35.  Based on this call, a work group consisting of ADHS staff and CHMS providers \nwas created.  As a result of their work, an agreement was reached that limited the daily payment \nfor core services to $95.00 per child per day.  This agreement went into effect on April 1, 1998, \nand provided as follows: \nEffective for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1998, the Division of \nMedical Services will implement a $95.00 per day rate for the CHMS-Early Intervention \nServices (ages 0 through 5) procedure codes.  One day of care will be defined as a \nminimum of 6 hours of service that can include the following procedures with maximums \nnoted below. \n99211 \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 8 of 18\n99212 \nZ1570 \nZ1571 (Maximum 3 units) \nZ1572 \nZI575 \n36.  Despite this agreement, ADHS announced in early 1999 that the daily rate for core \nservices would be reduced from $95.00 to $75.00 per child per day. \n37.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley decided to reduce the rate for core \nservices filr purely budgetary reasons and without considering the factors of efficiency, economy, \nquality of care, and equal access as required by federal law.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. \nHanley refused to conduct a study that considered those factors, and a lawsuit was filed against to \nenjoin their decision.  That lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas, Western Division, given Case No. LR-C-99-810, and assigned to the \nHonorable James M. Moody. \n38.  PSCI filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief along with its Complaint.  The \nCourt conducted a hearing with respect to that motion, and ruled that the defendants failed to \nconsider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access before they reduced \nthe daily rate for core services.  The Court concluded that the defendants violated the federal \nstatutory rights ofPSCI as provided by 42 U.S.C. § l396a(a)(30)(A), and temporarily enjoined \nthe rate change just before it went into effect.  An order to that effect was filed with the Court on \nNovember 5, 1999.  See the Order attached hereto and marked as \"Exhibit A\". \n39.  Thereafter, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley submitted an offer of \njudgment to PSCI.  PSCI accepted the offer, and a Judgment ref1ecting the agreement was tIled \non December 14, 1999.  See the Judgment attached hereto and marked as  \"Exhibit B\".  In \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 9 of 18\naccordance with the agreement, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley were permanently \nenjoined from implementing the $75.00 daily rate for core services.  They were also ordered to \nnot reduce rates for services under the CHMS program below the rates in effect on November 6, \n1999, unless such reductions are based on an analysis of the costs incurred by efficient and \neconomic providers of such services and are established in conformity with applicable state and \nfederal laws. \n40.  During that time, on October I, 1999, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley \nimplemented a \"utilization control\" measure that requires \"prior authorization\" for all children \nwho wish enter the CHMS program. \n41.  Generally stated, prior authorization is a form of utilization control by which a \nstate Medicaid agency can verify a patient's need for medical services before services are \nprovided.  Prior authorization does not define the services that are available under a particular \nprogram, but is a tool the agency may use to ensure that only necessary medical services will be \nprovided. \n42.  Since its inception, this \"first layer\" of prior authorization has been administered \nby AFMC and its employees under contract with ADHS.  Referral by the PCP is still required, \nand a treatment plan must still be developed by the CHMS provider and approved by the PCP. \nHowever, the defendants control the admission of each child into the program, regardless of the \nprescription written by the PCP.  Medical reviewers employed by AFMC, including nurses and \ndoctors, decide whether to admit or deny children without deference to the PCP and without \nconducting a physical examination of the child.  They also refuse to admit children with serious \ndevelopmental delays in only one area of function. \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 10 of 18\n43.  On March 1, 2000, within weeks after resolution of the litigation referred to \nabove, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley added a \"second layer\" of prior authorization to \nthe CHMS program.  Unlike the \"first layer\" of prior authorization, which relates solely to the \nadmission of children into the CHMS program, the \"second layer\" controls the type and amount \nof medical services for which ADHS will pay once a child is allowed to enter the program.  The \nprescription written by the PCP no longer determines the types and amounts of services that may \nbe provided.  The defendants do not examine the child and do not give any deference to the \nprescription written by the PCP. \n44.  As with all programs provided by ADHS under the state Medicaid plan, a \nprovider manual has been issued with respect to the CHMS program.  Among other things, the \nCHMS Provider Manual (\"the Manual\") defines the services available to children under the \nprogram.  The Manual makes general reference to the two levels of prior authorization referred to \nabove, but does not set forth any standards or criteria for determining whether a child may be \nadmitted into or removed from the program, or the type and amount of services for which the \ndefendants will pay. \n45.  In fact, the defendants have not promulgated any written guidelines or regulations \nthat govern the process of prior authorization under the CHMS program.  For example, and \nwithout limitation, there are no written guidelines or regulations that define: \na.  The qualifications of those who may be employed by AFMC to make \ndecisions relative to issues of medical care for children with physical and mental \ndisabilities; \n\\0 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 11 of 18\nb.  The standards and criteria to be used by AFMC in deciding which children \nmay be admitted into the CHMS program; \nc.  The standards and criteria to be used by AFMC in deciding the types of \nservices that children mayor may not receive; \nd.  The standards and criteria to be used by AFMC in deciding the amounts of \nservices that children mayor may not receive; \ne.  The standards and criteria to be used by AFMC in deciding whether \nADHS will pay for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy services; \nf  The standards and criteria to be used by AFMC in deciding whether or not \nservices prescribed by a PCP  may be ignored or declined; \ng.  The reports and supporting documentation that CHMS providers must \nsubmit in order to get paid for services they provide; \nh.  The manner in which the defendants may issue new rules that affect the \nprocess of prior authorization; \n1.  The manner in which the defendants must provide notice of such new rules \nto CHMS providers; or \nJ.  The ruJes that govern the process by which decisions made by the \ndefendants may be questioned or appealed. \n46.  The fact that no written guidelines or regUlations exist with respect to the process \nof prior authorization renders the process constitutionally infirm.  The lack of any meaningful \nstandards leaves the entire process of prior authorization subject to arbitrary, capricious, and truly \nirrational decision-making on 'ile part of the defendants. \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 12 of 18\n47.  The absence of written guidelines or regulations is the result of a decision made \nby the defendants.  That decision has resulted in the following: \na.  Denial of admission of eligible children into the CHMS program; \nb.  Removal of eligible children from the CHMS program; \nc.  Denial of services to children enrolled in tbe CHMS program; and \nd.  Limitation or reduction of the types and amounts of services that may be \nprovided to children enrolled in the CHMS program. \n48.  Together and separately the defendants have abused tbe process of prior \nauthorization in this way, and have done so for budgetary reasons and to retaliate against the \nCHMS program.  For example, the defendants have unilaterally reduced the amount of core \nservices available to every child allowed into the program from approximately six hours to 3.5 \nhours per child per day, regardless of the child's medical or psychological condition.  Children \nwill not experience the maximum reduction of their physical and mental abilities with only 3.5 \nhours of core services per child per day.  To ensure they receive this maximum benefit, the \nplaintiffs have continued to provide six hours of core services per child per day and they should \nbe paid for those services. \n49.  Witb respect to physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy \nservices, the defendants have even gone so far as to apply the process of prior authorization only \nafter such services are provided, with the plaintiffs forced to either deny the provision of \nfederally-mandated services or assume the risk that those services will not be approved.  In \naddition, the defendants have issued new rules regarding entitlement to these types of therapy, \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 13 of 18\nwithout notice to the plaintiffs, and used these new rules to deny payment to the plaintiffs and \nfuture services to children. \n50.  Such decisions have been made for budgetary reasons, and to retaliate against the \nCHMS program, without considering the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and \nequal access as required by 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).  These decisions have no medical basis \nand violate prescriptions written by PCPs.  These decisions are inconsistent with community \nstandards of medical care, and in many cases have forced the plaintiffs to provide CHMS \nservices for which the defendants will not pay. \n5!.  While AFMC issues written decisions with respect to children seeking enrollment \nand services under the CHMS program, those decisions are not signed and fail to identify the \npersons who made them.  The plaintiffs have tried to identify and speak with the persons who \nmake these decisions, but the defendants refuse to identify these persons or allow the plaintiffs to \nspeak with them. \n52.  The defendants have acted in this manner for the sole purpose of reducing \npayments under the CHMS program.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley tried to lower the \ndaily rate for core services in 1999, but Judge Moody determined that they violated well-settled \nlaw in the process.  Not able to change rates, they contracted with AFMC to manipulate the other \nhalf of the payment equation by limiting entry into the program and reducing the types and \namounts of services for which ADHS will pay.  They even tried to terminate the CHMS program \naltogether, but this Court has enjoined that effort as well. \n53.  While it is true that the defendants have not reduced rates for services as they tried \nto do in 1999, they have nonetheless reduced payments under the CHMS program by refusing to \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 14 of 18\nadmit children into the program, expelling children from the program, denying services to \nchildren enrolled in the program, and either limiting or reducing the provision of critical medical \nservices mandated by federal law. \n54.  The defendants continue to act in an arbitrary, capricious, and truly irrational \nmanner by changing the rules as they relate to the process of prior authorization without notifying \nCHMS providers that such changes have been made.  The defendants then deny services to \nqualified children based on the failure of CHMS providers to comply with these rules.  The \nplaintiffs have asked the defendants to issue written guidelines or regulations so as to avoid these \nproblems, but the defendants have refused to do so. \n55.  By their conduct, the defendants have violated the plaintiffs rights under 42 \nU.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).  That statute requires the defendants to consider the factors of \nefficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access before payments are reduced under the \nMedicaid program.  The defendants have not considered these factors in any way, and have used \nthe process of prior authorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program for purely \nbudgetary reasons. \n56.  In addition, the defendants have violated the rights of children enrolled in the \nCHMS program, and of those removed or kept out of the program by the defendants, under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13).  That statute requires the defendants to provide services to children \nqualified for enrollment in the Medicaid program that result in the maximum reduction of their \nphysical and mental disabilities.  Children enrolled in the CHMS program, and those who would \nbe enrolled in the program but tor the defendants, have profound disabilities that may be treated \nwith services provided only under the CHMS program. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 15 of 18\n57.  The conduct of the defendants is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, and \nconscious shocking.  As a result, the defendants have violated the federal constitutional rights of \nthe plaintiffs, the children enrolled in the CHMS program, and the children the defendants have \neither removed or kept out ofthe program.  The defendants have violated their rights to due \nprocess and equal protection of the laws, and they should be held liable for all damages resulting \nfrom such conduct. \n58.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious and in knowing \nviolation of the federal statutory and constitutional rights ofthe plaintiffs, the children enrolled in \nthe CHMS program, and the children they have either removed or kept out of the program.  For \nthese reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and \nAFMC so as to prevent similar conduct in the future. \n59.  As for the lack of any written guidelines or regulations as they relate to the \nprocess of prior authorization, the plaintiffs request emergency, temporary, and permanent \ninjunctive relief against the defendants by which the current system of prior authorization is \nenjoined until written guidelines or regulations can be drafted. \n60.  The defendants have violated the rights of the plaintiffs to procedural and due \nprocess. \n61.  At all times described herein, the defendants were acting under color of state law. \nJURY DEMAND \n62.  The plaintiffs demand a jury trial with regard to all issues of fact that may arise \nherein. \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 16 of 18\n\\\\THEREFORE, the plaintiffs, Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. and Child & Youth Pediatric \nDay Clinics, Inc., pray that their request for injunctive relief be granted, that they be awarded \njudgment for compensatory damages against defendants Kurt Knickrelun, Ray Hanley, Dr. \nMichael Moody, and the Jane/John Doe defendants, jointly and severally, that they be awarded \njudgment for punitive damages against Kurt Knickrelun, Ray Hanley, Dr. Michael Moody, and \nthe Jane/John Doe defendants, that they be awarded their costs herein expended, including \nreasonable attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and that they be awarded all other relief to \nwhich they may be entitled. \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 76    Filed 01/06/03   Page 17 of 18\nRespectfully submitted, \nPEDIATRIC SPECIALTY CARE, INC., \nCHILD & YOUTH PEDIATRIC DAY \nCLINICS, INC., TOMORROW'S CHILD \nLEARNING CENTER, LLC, JAMES AND \nSTACEY SWINDLE, AS PARENTS AND \nNEXT BEST FRIENDS OF JACOB AND \nNOAH SWINDLE, MINORS, AND SUSANN \nCRESPINO, AS PARENT AND NEXT BEST \nFRIEND OF MICHAEL CRESPINO, A \nMINOR, Plaintiffs \nARMSTRONG ALLEN, PLLC \n100 Morgan Keegan Drive \nSuite 100 \nLittle Rock, AR  72202 \n(501) 280-0100 i/c/\" \n(SOl) 280-0166(' csimil. \n. .  \"j \n/ \n.  / \n/  // \n~/  / \n. \nBy:  / \n.' \n~PLAN, \nBREWER, MAXEY, & \nHARALSON, P.A. \n415 Main Street \nLittle Rock, AR 7220 I \n(SOl) 372-0400 \n(501) 376-3612 \nI~WW tl~L,-\nBy: \nPhilip E.

Defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is an agency of \nthe S tate of Arkansas. \n7.  Defendant Kurt Knickrehm is Director of the Arkansas Department of Human \nServices and, based on information and reasonable belief, is a resident of Pulaski County, \nArkansas. \n8.

The Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n13.  The Court has civil rights jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343. \n14.  The Court has venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139l. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n15.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq. (1992 & Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is a joint federal and state program designed \nto provide \"medical assistance\" to qualified persons. \n16.  Under the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan (\"State \nplan\") that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal govemment will pay a specified \npercentage of the total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n17.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state elects to \nparticipate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 5 of 29\n18.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). \n19.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and Arkansas Department of \nHuman Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with administration ofthe Medicaid \nprogram in Arkansas. \n20.  The Medicaid Act defines \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\". \n21.  Some services are mandatory and must be provided under the State plan. \n22.  Mandatory services include those provided under the early and periodic \nscreening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") provisions of the Medicaid Act. \n23.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n24.  The CHMS program comprises an array of clinic services that are intended to \nprovide full medical multi-discipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for the purpose of \nintervention, treatment, and prevention of long-term disability for eligible children. \n25.  Generally stated, services under the CHMS program can be broken down into \nthree broad categories:  (1) diagnosis and evaluation services, (2) therapy services, and (3) early \nintervention day treatment services. \n26.  CHMS therapy services include physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and psychotherapy. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 6 of 29\n27.  CHMS early intervention day treatment services include cognitive development \nservices, developmental motor activity services, and self-care and social/emotional \ndevelopmental services. \n28.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, a child could enter the program \nbased on a referral from his or her physician (referred to in Medicaid terms as the Primary Care \nPhysician or \"PCP\"). \n29.  Diagnostic and evaluation services were provided by CHMS staff, and, as \nrequired by EPSDT, individualized treatment plans were developed for the treatment of all \ndevelopmental disabilities that were discovered during the screening process. \n30.  Treatment plans generally included the various CHMS therapy and early \nintervention day treatment services requested by clinic staff, consistent with applicable standards \nof medical practice. \n31.  After a treatment plan was developed for a particular child, it was submitted to the \nCHMS clinic's Medical Director for approval. \n32.  To the extent a treatment plan included physical therapy, speech therapy, or \noccupational therapy, the CHMS clinic was required to obtain a prescription from the PCP. \n33.  If the Medical Director approved the treatment plan, CHMS services were \nprovided in accordance with the plan, the CHMS provider billed ADHS for the services it \nprovided, and ADHS paid the bill. \n34.  Initially, payment for CHMS services was fairly straightforward:  for each service \nprovided under the treatment plan, payment was determined by multiplying the number of units \nof service actually provided by the rate for that service as published by ADHS in the State plan. \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 7 of 29\n35.  Given the nature of this fee-far-service formula, ADHS could reduce payment for \nCHMS services by either reducing the rates for those services, or the number of units of service \nthat could be provided over a certain period of time. \n36.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, CHMS clinics provided, on \naverage, six hours of early intervention day treatment services (referred to in Medicaid terms as \n\"core services \") per child per day, five days a week. \n37.  ADHS routinely reimbursed providers for this amount of core services (six hours \nper child per day, five days per week) at rates published by ADHS in the State plan. \n38.  In the fall of 1997, payment for core services was approximately $125.00 per \nchild per day. \n39.  ADHS, in an effort to reduce payments under the CHMS program, asked CHMS \nproviders if the rates for core services could be reduced or handled in such a way so as to make \nthe program less expensive. \n40.  Based on this call, a work group consisting of ADHS staff and CHMS providers \nwas created. \n41.  As a result of their work, an agreement was reached that limited the daily \npayment for core services to $95.00 per child per day. \n42.  This agreement went into effect on April I, 1998, and provided as follows: \nEffective for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1998, the Division of \nMedical Services will implement a $95.00 per day rate for the CHMS-EarJy \nIntervention Services (ages 0 through 5) procedure codes.  One day of care will be \ndefined as a minimum of 6 hours of service that can include the following \nprocedures with maximums noted below. \n99211 \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 8 of 29\n99212 \nZ1570 \nZ1571 (Maximum 3 units) \nZ1572 \nZ1575 \n43.  Despite this agreement, ADHS announced in early 1999 that the daily rate for \ncore services would be reduced from $95.00 to $75.00 per child per day. \n44.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley decided to reduce the rate for core \nservices for purely budgetary reasons. \n45.  Prior to reducing the daily rate for core services, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. \nHanley failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access as \nrequired by federal law. \n46.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley refused to conduct a study that \nconsidered those factors, and a lawsuit was filed to enjoin their decision. \n47.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nArkansas, Western Division, given Case No. LR-C-99-810, and assigned to the Honorable James \nM.Moody. \n48.  The plaintiff filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief along with its \nComplaint. \n49.  The Court conducted a hearing with respect to the plaintiffs motion, and ruled \nthat the defendants failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and \nequal access before they reduced the daily rate for core services. \n8 \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 9 of 29\n50.  The Court concluded that the defendants violated the federal statutory rights of \nthe plaintiff as provided by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a( a)(30)(A), and issued a preliminary injunction that \nstopped the rate reduction before it went into effect. \n5!.  An order to that effect was filed with the Court on November 5, 1999. \n52.  Thereafter, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley submitted an offer of \njudgment to the plaintiff. \n53.  The plaintiff accepted their offer, and a Judgment reflecting the agreement was \nfiled on December 14, 1999. \n54.  In accordance with this agreement, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley were \npermanently enjoined from implementing the $75.00 daily rate for core services.  They were also \nordered to not reduce rates for services under the CHMS program below the rates in effect on \nNovember 6, 1999, unless the reduction is based on an analysis of the costs incurred by efficient \nand economic providers of such services and are established in conformity with applicable state \nand federal laws. \n55.  During that time, ADHS, acting through Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \ndeveloped a \"utilization control\" program that requires \"prior authorization\" of CHMS services. \n56.  Generally stated, the Medicaid Act recognizes prior authorization as an accepted \nform of utilization control that a State may use to verify a patient's need for Medicaid services \nbefore those services are provided. \n57.  Prior authorization is an inherent state action, which may be conducted by the \nState or a private contractor hired by the State. \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 10 of 29\n58.  According to the prior authorization program developed by Mr. Knickrehm and \nMr. Hanley, there are now two \"layers\" of prior authorization under the CHMS program. \n59.  The first layer of prior authorization applies to the admission of children into the \nCHMS program, and went into effect on October 1, 1999. \n60.  The second layer of prior authorization applies to the number of units of CHMS \nservices a child may receive over a certain period of time, and went into effect on March 1,2000. \n61.  ADHS contracted with AFMC to implement the two layers of prior authorization \ndeveloped by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n62.  The CHMS Provider Manual requires AFMC to consider requests for CHMS \nservices within 15 business days. \n63.  At all times described herein, AFMC was acting as the agent of ADHS for the \npurpose of prior authorizing CHMS services under the State plan. \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n64.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n65.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior authorization to \nlimit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their pre-determined \ncost savings can be achieved. \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 11 of 29\n66.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have only one diagnosed medical, \nbehavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n67.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children diagnosed as suffering any \nmedical, behavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition, not just those \nwith more than one diagnosis. \n68.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with only one diagnosed medical, behavioral, or developmental \ndelay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n69.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with only one diagnosed medical, \nbehavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n70.  Before the defendants can use the first layer of prior authorization to limit \nadmission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings \ncan be achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and \nequal access as required by 42 V.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n71.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n72.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that may not use the first \nlayer of prior authorization to limit admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so \nthat the pre-determined cost savings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of \neconomy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal access. \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 12 of 29\n73.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that ADHS has failed to \nconsider these factors. \n74.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n75.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 13 96a(a)(30)(A). \n76.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n77.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n78.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n79.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 13 of 29\n80.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have only one diagnosed medical, \nbehavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n81.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children diagnosed as suffering any \nmedical, behavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition, not just those \nwi th more than one diagnosis. \n82.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with more than one diagnosed medical, behavioral, or developmental \ndelay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n83.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with only one diagnosed medical, \nbehavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping condition. \n84.  By using the first layer of prior authorization to deny admission into the CHMS \nprogram to children with only one diagnosed medical, behavioral, or developmental delay, \ndisability, or handicapping condition, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the rights of these children to CHMS services mandated by 42 \nU.S.c. § 1396d(a)(13). \n85.  Mr. Knickrehrn, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that they are denying \nmandatory services to children, but continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments \nunder the CHMS program to the level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 14 of 29\n86.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n87.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n88.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n89.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior authorization \nto deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their pre-determined \ncost savings can be achieved. \n90.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n91.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n92.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for up to six hours of core services per child per day, depending on \nthe amount of core services actually provided. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 15 of 29\n93.  Before the defendants can use the second layer of prior authorization to deny \nservices to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-detennined cost savings can \nbe achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal \naccess as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n94.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n95.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that they may not use the \nsecond layer of prior authorization to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program \nso that the pre-detennined cost savings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of \neconomy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal access. \n96.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that ADHS has failed to \nconsider these factors. \n97.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-detennined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n98.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n99.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n100.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \nCOUNT FOUR:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l3) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 16 of 29\n101.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-detennined by them. \n102.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior authorization \nto deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their pre-determined \ncost savings can be achieved. \n103.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n104.  Six hours of CHMS core services per child per day results in the maximum \nreduction of physical and mental disabilities, and restores children to their best-possible \nfunctional level. \n105.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n106.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n107.  The current level of CHMS core services approved by AFMC per child per day \ndoes not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities, and does not \nrestore children to their best-possible functional level. \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 17 of 29\n108.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that the current level of \nCHMS core services approved by AFMC per child per day does not result in the maximwn \nreduction of physical and mental disabilities, and does not restore children to their best-possible \nfunctional level. \n109.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that they are denying \nmandatory services to eligible children, but continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing \npayments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. \nHanley. \n110.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \nIll.  By using the second layer of prior authorization to cut the provision of core \nservices to all children from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, the \ndefendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated the rights of these children to \nCHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n112.  To ensure that the children treated by the plaintiff providers receive the maximum \nreduction of their physical and mental disabilities, and are restored to their best-possible \nfunctional level, they have continued to provide up to six hours of core services per child per \nday. \n113.  The provider plaintiffs are entitled to payment for the provision of such services. \n114.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation ofthe rights of the plaintiffs. \n17 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 18 of 29\n115.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT FIVE:  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n116.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n117.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, directed AFMC to not publish regulations that govern the \nprior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to recipients \nor providers, and use those rules to deny CHMS services to eligible children so that their pre \ndetermined cost savings can be achieved. \n118.  AFMC has refused, and continues to refuse, to publish regulations that govern the \nprior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to recipients \nor providers, and use those rules to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program. \n119.  For example, AFMC has refused to publish regulations that define: \na.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may be \nadmitted into the CHMS program; \nb.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nbe admitted into the CHMS program; \nc.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \n18 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 19 of 29\nd.  The medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \ne.  The infonnation needed by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nreceive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; and \nf.  The medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nreceive the amount ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan. \n120.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the infonnation needed by AFMC \nto detennine whether a child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many \noccasions refused to admit children because their CHMS providers failed to submit infonnation \nthey were never told to provide. \n121.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether \na child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many occasions taken \nadvantage of the lack of published standards to refuse admission to children based on standards \nof its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n122.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the infonnation needed by AFMC \nto detennine whether a child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment \nplan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS providers \nfailed to submit infonnation they were never told to provide. \n123.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether \na child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC has on \nmany occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to children \nbased on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n19 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 20 of 29\n124.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may receive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's \ntreatment plan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS \nproviders failed to submit information they were never told to provide. \n125.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the amount of CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC \nhas on many occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to \nchildren based on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical \npractice. \n126.  Such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and \noffensive to traditional notions of fairness. \n127.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that such conduct is \narbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and offensive to traditional notions of \nfairness, but continue to engage in such conduct for the mere purpose of reducing payments \nunder the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n128.  By such conduct, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n129.  The conduct ofthe defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n130.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n20 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 21 of 29\nCOUNT SIX:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8) \n131.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-detennined by them. \n132.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, have authorized AFMC to not consider requests for services \nwith reasonable promptness so that their pre-detennined cost savings can be achieved. \n133.  AFMC often refuses to follow the regulation set forth in the CHMS Provider \nManual that requires it to process requests for services within 15 business days. \n134.  AFMC often takes at least a month, and sometimes as long as five months, to \nprocess requests for services. \n135.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8), the State Plan \"must ... provide that all \nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to \nall eligible individuals\". \n136.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that they must consider \nrequests for CHMS services with reasonable promptness. \n137.  Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and AFMC understand that they must consider \nrequests for CHMS services within 15 business days. \n21 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 22 of 29\nl3S.  Despite their understanding, AFMC often refuses to consider requests for CHMS \nservices with reasonable promptness to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \nl39.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § l396a(a)(S). \n140.  The conduct ofthe defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n141.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SEVEN:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) \n142.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n143.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children who are \ndenied admission into the CHMS program under the first layer of prior authorization. \n144.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children who have \nCHMS services denied to them under the second layer of prior authorization. \n145.  Although ADHS provides an appeal to CHMS recipients, it does not provide an \nappeal to CHMS providers. \n22 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 23 of 29\n146.  When an appeal is filed, ADHS refuses to teII the CHMS recipient the name of \nthe nurses and doctors employed by AFMC who made the adverse decisions against them. \n147.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who wiII be calIed to testify against the child. \n148.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe basis of the opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who wiII be calIed to testify against \nthe child. \n149.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe information upon which the nurses and doctors relied in forming their opinions. \n150.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to receive a \nfair hearing. \n151.  Several months ago, plaintiffs Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. and Child & Youth \nPediatric Day Clinics, Inc. submitted a request to ADHS pursuant to the Arkansas Freedom of \nInformation Act in which they requested the names ofthe nurses and doctors employed by \nAFMC who make these decisions. \n152.  ADHS refused to provide the requested information, and referred the plaintiffs to \nAFMC. \n153.  The plaintiffs requested the same information from AFMC, and it refused to \nprovide the information as welI. \n154.  In order to get this information, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against AFMC under \nthe Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. \n23 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 24 of 29\n155.  On January 15, 2003, Pulaski County Circuit Judge John Ward ordered AFMC to \nproduce the requested infonnation. \n156.  AFMC filed a motion to reconsider, and Pulaski County Circuit Judge Jay Moody \naffinned Judge Ward's decision in all respects. \n157.  AFMC did not appeal that decision, and the time has run for filing an appeal. \n158.  Since that time, a CHMS recipient suffered an adverse decision at the hands of \nAFMC. \n159.  The CHMS recipient filed an appeal, and asked AFMC to identify the nurses and \ndoctors who issued the adverse decision. \n160.  Although Judge Ward and Judge Moody previously rejected AFMC's legal \nargument that such infonnation was protected from disclosure under federal law, AFMC refused \nto teJl the CHMS recipient the names of the doctors and nurses who issued the adverse decision \nagainst her. \n161.  As the basis for refusing to give such infonnation to the CHMS recipient, AFMC \nrelied on the same argument previously rejected by Judge Ward and Judge Moody. \n162.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-detennined by them, instructed AFMC to not identify the doctors and nurses who issue \nadverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n163.  By refusing to provide such infonnation to CHMS recipients who seek to appeal \nadverse decisions, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated, and \ncontinue to violate, their right to a fair hearing under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n24 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 95    Filed 06/23/03   Page 25 of 29\n164.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n165.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nINCORPORATION OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT \n166.  Because some of the claims set forth by the plaintiffs in their original Complaint \nare presently on appeal, the plaintiffs restate and incorporate by reference all allegations and \nclaims set forth in their original Complaint as though set forth herein in their entirety, word for \nword. \nJURY DEMAND \n167.

The Court has venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n16.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq. (1992 &  Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is a joint federal and state progr,un designed \nto provide \"medical assistance\" to qualified persons. \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 5 of 28\n17.  Under the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan (\"State \nplan\") that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specified \npercentage of the total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n18.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state elects to \nparticipate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. \n19.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). \n20.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and Arkansas Department of \nHuman Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with administration of the Medicaid \nprogram in Arkansas. \n21.  The Medicaid Act defmes \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\". \n22.  Some services are mandatory and must be provided under the State plan. \n23.  Mandatory services include those provided under the early and periodic \nscreening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") provisions of the Medicaid Act. \n24.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n25.  The CHMS program comprises an array of clinic services that are intended to \nprovide full medical mUlti-discipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for the purpose of \nintervention, treatment, and prevention oflong-term disability for eligible children \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 6 of 28\n26.  Generally stated, services under the CHMS program can be broken down into \nthree broad categories:  (I) diagnosis and evaluation services, (2) therapy services, and (3) early \nintervention day treatment services. \n27.  CHMS therapy services include physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and psychotherapy. \n28.  CHMS early intervention day treatment services include cognitive development \nservices, developmental motor activity services, and self-care and social/emotional \ndevelopmental services. \n29.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, a child could enter the program \nbased on a referral from his or her physician (referred to in Medicaid terms as the Primary Care \nPhysician or \"PCP\"). \n30.  Diagnostic and evaluation services were provided by CHMS staff. and, as \nrequired by EPSDT, treatment plans were developed for the treatment of all developmental \ndisabilities that were discovered during the screening process. \n31.  A treatment plan included the various CHMS therapy and early intervention day \ntreatment services requested by clinic staff, and the number of units of service that should be \nprovided over a certain period of time, consistent with applicable standards of medical practice. \n32.  After a treatment plan was developed for a particular child, it was submitted to the \nPCP for approval. \n33.  If the PCP approved the treatment plan, CHMS services were provided in \naccordance with the plan, the CHMS provider billed ADHS for the services it provided. and \nADHS paid the bill. \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 7 of 28\n34.  Initially, payment for CHMS services was fairly straightforward:  for each service \nprovided under the treatment plan, payment was determined by multiplying the number of units \nof service actually provided by !be rate for !bat service as published by ADHS in the State plan. \n35.  Given the nature of this fee-for-service formula, ADHS could reduce payment for \nCHMS services by either reducing the rates for those services, or !be number of units of service \nthat could be provided over a certain period of time. \n36.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, CHMS clinics provided, on \naverage, six hours of early intervention day treatment services (referred to in Medicaid terms as \n\"core services \") per child per day, five days a week. \n37.  ADHS routinely reimbursed providers for this amount of core services (six hours \nper child per day, five days per week) at rates published by ADHS in !be State plan. \n38.  In !be fall of 1997, payment for core services was approximately $125.00 per \nchild per day. \n39.  ADHS, in an effort to reduce payments under !be CHMS program, asked CHMS \nproviders if !be rates for core services could be reduced or handled in such a way so as to make \nthe program less expensive. \n40.  Based on this call, a work group consisting of ADHS staff and CHMS providers \nwas created. \n41.  As a result of their work, an agreement was reached that limited !be daily \npayment for core services to $95.00 per child per day. \n42.  This agreement wenl into effect on April I, 1998, and provided as follows: \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 8 of 28\nEffective for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1998, the Division of \nMedical Services will implement a $95.00 per day rate for the CHMS-Early \nIntervention Services (ages 0 through 5) procedure codes.  One day of care will be \ndefined as a minimum of 6 hours of service that can include the following \nprocedures with maximums noted below. \n99211 \n99212 \nZ1570 \nZI571 (Maximum 3 units) \nZ1572 \n21575 \n43.  Despite this agreement, ADHS announced in early 1999 that the daily rate for \ncore services would be reduced from $95.00 to $75.00 per child per day. \n44.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley decided to reduce the rate for core \nservices for purely budgetary reasons. \n45.  Prior to reducing the daily rate for core services, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. \nHanley failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access as \nrequired by federal law. \n46.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley refused to conduct a study that \nconsidered those factors, and a lawsuit was filed to enjoin their decision. \n47.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nArkansas, Western Division, given Case No. LR-C-99-810, and assigned to the Honorable James \nM.Moody. \n48.  The plaintiff filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief along with its \nComplaint. \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 9 of 28\n49.  The Court conducted a hearing with respect to the plaintiff s motion, and ruled \nthat the defendants failed to consider the factors of effIciency, economy, quality of care, and \nequal access before they reduced the daily rate for core services. \n50.  The Court concluded that the defendants violated the federal statutory rights of \nLhe plaintiff as provided by 42 U.S.C. § J396a(a)(30)(A), and issued a preliminary injunction that \nstopped the rate reduction before it went into effect. \n5!.  An order to that effect was filed with the Court on November 5, 1999. \n52.  Thereafter, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley submitted an offer of \njudgment to the plaintiff \n53.  The plaintiff accepted their offer, and a Judgment reflecting the agreement was \nfiled on December 14, 1999. \n54.  In accordance with this agreement, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley were \npe=anently enjoined from implementing the $75.00 daily rate for core services.  They were also \nordered to not reduce rates for services under the CHMS program below the rates in effect on \nNovember 6, 1999, unless the reduction is based on an analysis of the costs incurred by efficient \nand economic providers of such services and are established in conformity with applicable state \nand federal laws. \n55.  During that time, ADHS, acting through Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \ndeveloped a \"utilization control\" program that requires \"prior authorization\" of CHMS services. \n56.  Generally stated, the Medicaid Act recognizes prior authorization as an accepted \n1'0= of utilization control that a State may use to verify a patient's need for Medicaid services \nbefore those services are provided. \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 10 of 28\n57.  Prior authorization is an inherent state action, which may be conducted by the \nState or a private contractor hired by the State. \n58.  According to the prior authorization program developed by Mr. Knickrehrn and \nMr. Hanley, there are now two \"layers\" of prior authorization under the CHMS program. \n59.  The fust layer of prior authorization applies to the admission of children into the \nCHMS program, and went into effect on October I, 1999. \n60.  The second layer of prior authorization applies to the number of units of CHMS \nservices a child may receive over a certain period of time, and went into effect on March I, 2000. \n61.  ADHS contracted with AFMC to implement the two layers of prior authorization \ndeveloped by Mr. Knickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \n62.  The CHMS Provider Manual requires AFMC to consider requests for CHMS \nservices within 15 working days. \n63.  At all times described herein, AFMC was acting as the agent of ADHS for the \npurpose of prior authorizing CHMS services under the State plan. \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n64.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n65.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehrn, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the fust layer of prior \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 11 of 28\nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n66.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have a developmental delay in only \none area. \n67.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children who are diagnosed as \nsuffering a developmental delay, not just those who have developmental delays in more than one \narea. \n68.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with developmental delays in only one area. \n69.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with developmental delays in only \none area. \n70.  Before the defendants can use the first layer of prior authorization to limit \nadmission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings \ncan be achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and \nequal access as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n71.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n72.  The defendants understand that may not use the first layer of prior authorization \nto limit admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-dctelIDined cost \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 12 of 28\nsavings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of \ncare, and equal access. \n73.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n74.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the first layer of prior \n:mthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n75.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n76.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n77.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n78.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n79.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the fust layer of prior \nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 13 of 28\n80.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the fIrst layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have a developmental delay in only \none area. \n81.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children diagnosed as suffering a \ndevelopmental delay, not just those with developmental delays in more than one area. \n82.  Before the fIrst layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with developmental delays in only one area. \n83.  Before the fIrst layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with developmental delays in only \none area. \n84.  By using the fIrst layer of prior authorization to deny admission into the CHMS \nprogram to children with developmental delays in only one area, the defendants, while acting \nlmder color of state law, have violated, and continue to violate, the rights of these children to \nCHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n85.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to children, \nbut continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \nthe level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n86.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n87.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 14 of 28\nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER nIE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n88.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n89.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n90.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n91.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n92.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n93.  Before the defendants can use the second layer of prior authorization to deny \nservices to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings can \nbe achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal \naccess as required by 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n94.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 15 of 28\n95.  The defendants understand that they may not use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-\ndetermined cost savings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, \nefficiency, quality of care, and equal access. \n96.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n97.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n98.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n99.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n100.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \nCOUNT FOUR:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.c. § 1396d(a)(13) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n101.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n102.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 16 of 28\nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n103.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n104.  Six hours of CHMS core services per child per day results in the maximum \nreduction of physical and mental disabilities, and restores children to their best-possible \nfunctional level. \n105.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n106.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n107.  The current level of CHMS core services approved by AFMC per child per day \ndoes not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities, and does not \nrestore children to their best-possible functional level. \n108.  The defendants understand that the current level ofCHMS core services approved \nby AFMC per child per day does not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisabilities, and does not restore children to their best-possible functional level. \n109.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to eligible \nchildren, but continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS \nprogram to a level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 17 of 28\n110.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \nIll.  By using the second layer of prior authorization to cut the provision of core \nservices to all children from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, the \ndefendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated the rights of these children to \nCHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.c. § l396d(a)(13). \n112.  To ensure that the children treated by the plaintiff providers receive the maximum \nreduction of their physical and mental disabilities, and are restored to their best-possible \nfunctional level, they have continued to provide six hours of core services per child per day. \n113.  The provider plaintiffs are entitled to payment for the provision of such services. \n114.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n115.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehrn, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT FIVE:  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n116.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehrn and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n117.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehrn, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to not publish regulations that \n17 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 18 of 28\ngovern the prior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to \nrecipients or providers, and use those rules to deny CHMS services to eligible children so that \ntheir pre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n118.  AFMC has refused, and continues to refuse, to publish regulations that govern the \nprior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to recipients \nor providers, and use those rules to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program. \n119.  For example, AFMC has refused to publish regulations that define: \na.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may be \nadmitted into the CHMS program; \nb.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nbe admitted into the CHMS program; \nc.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \nd.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \ne.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; and \nf.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amount ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan. \n120.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many \n18 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 19 of 28\noccasions refused to admit children because their CHMS providers failed to submit info=ation \nthey were never told to provide. \n12l.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many occasions taken \nadvantage of the lack of published standards to refuse admission to children based on standards \nof its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n122.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto dete=ine whether a child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment \nplan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS providers \nfailed to submit info=ation they were never told to provide. \n123.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC has on \nmany occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to children \nbased on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n124.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the info=ation needed by AFMC \nto dete=ine whether a child may receive the amounts of CHMS services set forth in the child's \ntreatment plan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS \nproviders failed to submit info=ation they were never told to provide. \n125.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the amount ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC \nhas on many occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to \n19 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 20 of 28\nchildren based on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical \npractice. \n126.  Such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and \noffensive to traditional notions of fairness. \n127.  The defendants understand that such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly \nirrational, conscious shocking, and offensive to traditional notions of fairness, but continue to \nengage in such conduct for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \na level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n128.  By such conduct, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n129.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n130.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SIX:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) \n131.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n20 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 21 of 28\n132.  Based on information and reasonable belief: Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have authorized AFMC to not consider requests for \nservices with reasonable promptness so that their pre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n133.  AFMC often refuses to follow the regulation set forth in the CHMS Provider \nManual that requires it to process requests for services within 15 business days. \n134.  AFMC often takes at least a month, and sometimes as long as five months, to \nprocess requests for services. \n135.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(S), the State Plan \"must ... provide that all \nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to \nall eligible individuals\". \n136.  The defendants understand that they must consider requests for CHl'vlS services \nwith reasonable promptness. \n13 7.  The defendants understand that they must consider requests for CHl'vfS services \nwithin 15 working days. \n13S.  Despite their understanding, AFMC often refuses to consider requests for CHMS \nservices with reasonable promptness to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n139.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(S). \n140.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n21 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 22 of 28\n141.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SEVEN:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.c. Q 1396a(a)(3) \n142.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n143.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children \nwho are denied admission into the CHMS program under the first layer of prior authorization. \n144.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children \nwho have CHMS services denied to them under the second layer of prior authorization. \n145.  Although ADHS provides an appeal to CHMS recipients, it does not provide an \nappeal to CHMS providers. \n146.  When an appeal is filed, ADHS refuses to tell the CHMS recipient the name of \nthe nurses and doctors employed by AFMC who made the adverse decisions against them. \n147.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against the child. \n148.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe basis of the opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against \nthe child. \n22 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 23 of 28\n149.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe information upon which the nurses and doctors relied in forming their opinions. \n150.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to receive a \nfair hearing. \n151.  Several months ago, plaintiffs Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. and Child & Youth \nPediatric Day Clinics, Inc. submitted a request to ADHS pursuant to the Arkansas Freedom of \nInformation Act in which they requested the names of the nurses and doctors employed by \nAFMC who make these decisions. \n152.  ADHS refused to provide the requested information, and referred the plaintiffs to \nAFMC. \n153.  The plaintiffs requested the same information from AFMC, and it refused to \nprovide the information as well. \n154.  In order to get this information, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against AFMC under \nthe Arkansas Freedom of Information Act. \n155.  On January 15,2003, Pulaski County Circuit Judge John Ward ordered AFMC to \nproduce the requested information. \n156.  AFMC filed a motion to reconsider, and Pulaski County Circuit Judge Jay Moody \naffirmed Judge Ward's decision in all respects. \n157.  AFMC did not appeal that decision, and the time has run for filing an appeal. \n158.  Since thallime, a CHMS recipient suffered an adverse decision at the hands of \nAFMC. \n23 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 24 of 28\n159.  The CHMS recipient filed an appeal, and asked AFMC to identify the nurses and \ndoctors who issued the adverse decision. \n160.  Although Judge Ward and Judge Moody previously rejected AFMC's legal \nargument that such information was protected from disclosure under federal law. AFMC refused \nto tell the CHMS recipient the names of the doctors and nurses who issued the adverse decision \nagainst heL \n161.  As the basis for refusing to give such information to the CHMS recipient, AFMC \nrelied on the same argument previously rejected by Judge Ward and Judge Moody. \n162.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and ML Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by them, instructed AFMC to not identifY the doctors and nurses who issue \nadverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n163.  By refusing to provide such information to CHMS recipients who seek to appeal \nadverse decisions, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated, and \ncontinue to violate, their right to a fair hearing under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n164.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n165.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nINCORPORATION OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT \n24 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 144    Filed 05/14/04   Page 25 of 28\n166.

That the Court issue an injunction that prohibits the defendants from denying \nadmission into the CHMS program to children who have a developmental delay in only one area; \nc.

The Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n15.  The Court has civil rights jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. s. C. § 1343. \n16.  The Court has venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n17.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq. (1992 & Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is a joint federal and state program designed \n18.  Under the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan (\"State \nplan\") that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specified \npercentage of the total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 6 of 30\n19.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state elects to \nparticipate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. \n20.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). \n21.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and Arkansas Department of \nHuman Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with administration of the Medicaid \nprogram in Arkansas. \n22.  The Medicaid Act defines \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\". \n23.  Some services are mandatory and must be provided under the State plan. \n24.  Mandatory services include those provided under the early and periodic \nscreening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") provisions of the Medicaid Act. \n25.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n26.  The CHMS program comprises an array of clinic services that are intended to \nprovide full medical multi-discipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for the purpose of \nintervention, treatment, and prevention of long-term disability for eligible children. \n27.  Generally stated, services under the CHMS program can be broken down into \nthree broad categories:  (1) diagnosis and evaluation services, (2) therapy services, and (3) early \nintervention day treatment services. \n28.  CHMS therapy services include physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and mental health services. \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 7 of 30\n29.  CHMS early intervention day treatment services include cognitive development \nservices, developmental motor activity services, and self-care and social/emotional \ndevelopmental services, all of three of which are referred to collectively as cognitive therapy. \n30.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, a child could enter the program \nbased on a referral from his or her physician (referred to in Medicaid terms as the Primary Care \nPhysician or \"PCP\"). \n31.  Diagnostic and evaluation services were provided by CHMS staff, and, as \nrequired by EPSDT, treatment plans were developed for the treatment of all developmental \ndisabilities that were discovered during the screening process. \n32.  A treatment plan included the various CHMS therapy and early intervention day \ntreatment services requested by clinic staff, and the number of units of service that should be \nprovided over a certain period of time, consistent with applicable standards of medical practice. \n33.  After a treatment plan was developed for a particular child, it was submitted to the \nPCP for approval. \n34.  If the PCP approved the treatment plan, CHMS services were provided in \naccordance with the plan, the CHMS provider billed ADHS for the services it provided, and \nADHS paid the bill. \n35.  Initially, payment for CHMS services was fairly straightforward:  for each service \nprovided under the treatment plan, payment was determined by multiplying the number of units \nof service actually provided by the rate for that service that was published by ADHS in the State \nplan. \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 8 of 30\n36.  Given the nature of this fee-for-service fonnula, ADHS could reduce payment for \nCHMS services by either reducing the rates for these services, or by reducing the number of \nunits of service that could be provided over a certain period of time. \n37.  When the CHMS program first went into effect, CHMS clinics provided, on \naverage, six hours of early intervention day treatment services (referred to in Medicaid tenns as \n\"core services\") per child per day, five days a week. \n38.  ADHS routinely reimbursed providers for this amount of core services (six hours \nper child per day, five days per week) at rates published by ADHS in the State plan. \n39.  In the fall of 1997, payment for core services was approximately $125.00 per \nchild per day. \n40.  ADHS, in an effort to reduce payments under the CHMS program, asked CHMS \nproviders if the rates for core services could be reduced or handled in such a way so as to make \nthe program less expensive. \n41.  Based on this call, a work group consisting of ADHS staff and CHMS providers \nwas created. \n42.  As a result of their work, an agreement was reached that limited the daily \npayment for core services to $95.00 per child per day. \n43.  This agreement went into effect on April 1, 1998, and provided as follows: \nEffective for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 1998, the Division of \nMedical Services will implement a $95.00 per day rate for the CHMS-Early \nIntervention Services (ages 0 through 5) procedure codes.  One day of care will be \ndefined as a minimum of 6 hours of service that can include the following \nprocedures with maximums noted below. \n99211 \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 9 of 30\n99212 \nZ1570 \nZ1571 (Maximum 3 units) \nZ1572 \nZ1575 \n44.  Despite this agreement, ADHS announced in early 1999 that the daily rate for \ncore services would be reduced from $95.00 to $75.00 per child per day. \n45.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley decided to reduce the rate for core \nservices for purely budgetary reasons. \n46.  Prior to reducing the daily rate for core services, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. \nHanley failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access as \nrequired by federal law. \n47.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley refused to conduct a study that \nconsidered those factors, and a lawsuit was filed to enjoin their decision. \n48.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nArkansas, Western Division, given Case No. LR-C-99-810, and assigned to the Honorable James \nM.Moody. \n49.  The plaintiff filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief along with its \nComplaint. \n50.  The Court conducted a hearing with respect to the plaintiffs motion, and ruled \nthat the defendants failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and \nequal access before they reduced the daily rate for core services. \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 10 of 30\n51.  The Court concluded that the defendants violated the federal statutory rights of \nthe plaintiff as provided by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), and issued a preliminary injunction that \nstopped the rate reduction before it went into effect. \n52.  An order to that effect was filed with the Court on November 5, 1999. \n53.  Thereafter, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley submitted an offer of \njudgment to the plaintiff. \n54.  The plaintiff accepted their offer, and a Judgment reflecting the agreement was \nfiled on December 14, 1999. \n55.  In accordance with this agreement, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley were \npermanently enjoined from implementing the $75.00 daily rate for core services.  They were also \nordered to not reduce rates for services under the CHMS program below the rates in effect on \nNovember 6, 1999, unless the reduction is based on an analysis of the costs incurred by efficient \nand economic providers of such services and are established in conformity with applicable state \nand federal laws. \n56.  During that time, ADHS, acting through Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \ndeveloped a \"utilization control\" program that requires \"prior authorization\" of CHMS services. \n57.  Generally stated, the Medicaid Act recognizes prior authorization as an accepted \nform of utilization control that a State may use to verify a patient's need for Medicaid services \nbefore those services are provided. \n58.  Prior authorization is an inherent state action, which may be conducted by the \nState or a private contractor hired by the State. \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 11 of 30\n59.  According to the prior authorization program developed by Mr. Knickrelun and \nMr. Hanley, there are now two \"layers\" of prior authorization under the CHMS program. \n60.  The first layer of prior authorization applies to the admission of children into the \nCHMS program, and went into effect on October 1, 1999.  Mr. Knickrelun and Mr. Hanley \ndeveloped the first layer of prior authorization with the intention of reducing payment for CHMS \nservices by approximately $1,200,000.00 for State Fiscal Year 2000. \n61.  The second layer of prior authorization applies to the number of units of CHMS \nservices a child may receive over a certain period of time, and went into effect on March 1,2000. \n62.  ADHS contracted with AFMC to implement the two layers of prior authorization \ndeveloped by Mr. Knickrelun and Mr. Hanley. \n63.  The CHMS Provider Manual requires AFMC to consider requests for CHMS \nservices within 15 working days. \n64.  At all times described herein, AFMC was acting as the agent of ADHS for the \npurpose of prior authorizing CHMS services under the State plan. \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)CA) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n65.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrelun and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n66.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrelun, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 12 of 30\nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n67.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have cognitive delays, and who \ncould thus benefit from early intervention day treatment services, but do not have delays in any \nother area. \n68.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to treat children \nwho suffer cognitive delays, and was not designed to exclude children who suffer cognitive \ndelays but do not need any other form of therapy, i.e. physical therapy, speech therapy, \noccupational therapy, or mental health services. \n69.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children who only suffered cognitive delays. \n70.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children who only suffered cognitive \ndelays. \n71.  Before the defendants can use the first layer of prior authorization to limit \nadmission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings \ncan be achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and \nequal access as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n72.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n73.  The defendants understand that may not use the first layer of prior authorization \nto limit admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 13 of 30\nsavings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of \ncare, and equal access. \n74.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n75.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n76.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n77.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n78.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n79.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n80.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 14 of 30\n81.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have cognitive delays, and who \ncould thus benefit from early intervention day treatment services, but do not have delays in any \nother area. \n82.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to treat children \nwho suffer cognitive delays, and was not designed to exclude children who suffer cognitive \ndelays but do not need any other form of therapy, i.e. physical therapy, speech therapy, \noccupational therapy, or mental health services. \n83.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children who only suffer cognitive delays. \n84.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children who only suffer cognitive delays. \n85.  By using the first layer of prior authorization to deny admission into the CHMS \nprogram to children who only suffer cognitive delays, the defendants, while acting under color of \nstate law, have violated, and continue to violate, the rights of these children to CHMS services \nmandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n86.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to children, \nbut continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \nthe level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n87.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 15 of 30\n88.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n89.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n90.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n91.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day (a full-day program) to \napproximately 3.5 hours per child per day (a half-day program), regardless of the child's medical \nor psychological condition. \n92.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n93.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n94.  Before the defendants can use the second layer of prior authorization to deny \nservices to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings can \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 16 of 30\nbe achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal \naccess as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n95.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n96.  The defendants understand that they may not use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-\ndetermined cost savings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, \nefficiency, quality of care, and equal access. \n97.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n98.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n99.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n100.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT FOUR:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n101.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 17 of 30\n102.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n103.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day (a full-day program) to \napproximately 3.5 hours per child per day (a half-day program), regardless of the child's medical \nor psychological condition. \n104.  Six hours of CHMS core services per child per day (a full-day program) results in \nthe maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities, and restores children to their best \npossible functional level. \n105.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n106.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n107.  The current level ofCHMS core services approved by AFMC per child per day \ndoes not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities, and does not \nrestore children to their best-possible functional level. \n108.  The defendants understand that the current level of CHMS core services approved \nby AFMC per child per day does not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisabilities, and does not restore children to their best-possible functional level. \n17 \n\n..-----------------------------------------------------\n--\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 18 of 30\n109.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to eligible \nchildren, but continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS \nprogram to a level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n110.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n111.  By using the second layer of prior authorization to cut the provision of core \nservices to all children from approximately six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per \nday, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated the rights of these \nchildren to CHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13). \n112.  To ensure that the children treated by the plaintiff providers receive the maximum \nreduction of their physical and mental disabilities, and are restored to their best-possible \nfunctional level, they have continued to provide six hours of core services per child per day. \n113.  The provider plaintiffs are entitled to payment for the provision of such services. \n114.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n115.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \n18 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 19 of 30\nCOUNT FIVE:  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n116.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-detennined by them. \n117.  Based on infonnation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to not publish regulations that \ngovern the prior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to \nrecipients or providers, and use these rules to deny CHMS services to eligible children so that \ntheir pre-detennined cost savings can be achieved. \n118.  AFMC has refused, and continues to refuse, to publish regulations that govern the \nprior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to recipients \nor providers, and use these rules to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program. \n119.  For example, AFMC has refused to publish regulations that define: \na.  The infonnation required by AFMC to detennine whether a child may be \nadmitted into the CHMS program; \nb.  The medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nbe admitted into the CHMS program; \nc.  The infonnation required by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \nd.  The medical standards used by AFMC to detennine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \n19 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 20 of 30\ne.  The information required by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; and \nf.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amount of CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan. \n120.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information required by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many \noccasions refused to admit children because their CHMS providers failed to submit information \nthey were never told to provide. \n121.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many occasions taken \nadvantage of the lack of published standards to refuse admission to children based on standards \nof its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n122.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment \nplan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS providers \nfailed to submit information they were never told to provide. \n123.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC has on \nmany occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to children \nbased on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n124.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may receive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's \n20 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 21 of 30\ntreatment plan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS \nproviders failed to submit information they were never told to provide. \n125.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the amount of CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC \nhas on many occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to \nchildren based on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical \npractice. \n126.  Such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and \noffensive to traditional notions of fairness. \n127.  The defendants understand that such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly \nirrational, conscious shocking, and offensive to traditional notions of fairness, but continue to \nengage in such conduct for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \na level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n128.  By such conduct, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n129.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n130.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \n21 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 22 of 30\nCOUNT SIX:  VIOLA nON OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) \n131.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n132.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have authorized AFMC to not consider requests for \nservices with reasonable promptness so that their pre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n133.  AFMC often refuses to follow the regulation set forth in the CHMS Provider \nManual that requires it to process requests for services within 15 business days. \n134.  AFMC often takes at least a month, and sometimes as long as five months, to \nprocess requests for services. \n135.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), the State Plan \"must ... provide that all \nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to \nall eligible individuals\". \n136.  The defendants understand that they must consider requests for CHMS services \nwith reasonable promptness. \n137.

Despite their understanding, AFMC often refuses to consider requests for CHMS \nservices with reasonable promptness to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n139.  F or these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8). \n140.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n141.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SEVEN:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) \n142.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n143.  Although ADHS allows CHMS recipients to appeal adverse decisions made by \nAFMC, it does not provide a right of appeal to CHMS providers. \n144.  When an appeal is filed, ADHS refuses to tell the CHMS recipient the name of \nthe nurses and doctors employed by AFMC who made the adverse decisions against them. \n145.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against the child. \n23 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 24 of 30\n146.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe basis of the opinions formed by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against \nthe child. \n147.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe information upon which the nurses and doctors relied in forming their opinions. \n148.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to receive a \nfair hearing. \n149.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by them, have instructed AFMC to not identify the doctors and nurses who issue \nadverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n150.  By refusing to provide such information to CHMS recipients who seek to appeal \nadverse decisions, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated, and \ncontinue to violate, their right to a fair hearing under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n151.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n152.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against the defendants so \nas to deter similar conduct in the future. \n24 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 25 of 30\nCOUNT EIGHT:  VIOLATION OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n153.  On May 28, 2004, the District Court issued an Order which states that 42 U.S.C. § \n1320c-9 and 42 C.F.R. § 478.24 protect disclosure of the names ofthe doctors and nurses who' \nissue adverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n154.  Given the District Court's decision, these statutes violate the rights of the \nplaintiffs to procedural due process because they deny CHMS recipients and providers the right \nto a fair hearing with respect to adverse decisions made by the defendants. \n155.  Without the names of the doctors and nurses who issue adverse decisions against \nCHMS recipients, CHMS recipients and providers have no opportunity to speak with these \ndoctors and nurses prior to an appeal hearing to determine the reasons for the denial of CHMS \nservIces. \n156.  Without the names of the doctors and nurses who issue adverse decisions against \nCHMS recipients, CHMS recipients and providers have no opportunity to compel the presence of \nthese doctors and nurses at the appeal hearing, to confront these doctors and nurses at the appeal \nhearing, and cross examine these doctors and nurses with respect to their denial of CHMS \nservIces. \nCOUNT NINE:  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n157.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n25 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 26 of 30\n158.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first and second \nlayers of prior authorization to deny CHMS services to Medicaid-eligible children in Arkansas. \n159.  Nurse reviewers employed by AFMC, at the direction of corporate officers of \nAFMC, have altered decisions made by AFMC physician advisors to admit children into the \nCHMS program, and informed CHMS providers and recipients that AFMC physician advisors \nhave denied admission to these children. \n160.  In addition, nurse reviewers employed by AFMC, at the direction of ADHS and \ncorporate officers of AFMC, have altered decisions made by AFMC physician advisors to \napprove CHMS services for children, and informed CHMS providers and recipients that AFMC \nphysician advisors have denied requested services to these children. \n161.  Such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and \noffensive to traditional notions of fairness. \n162.  The defendants understand that such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly \nirrational, conscious shocking, and offensive to traditional notions of fairness, but continue to \nengage in such conduct for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \na level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n163.  By such conduct, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n164.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n26 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 250    Filed 01/04/05   Page 27 of 30\n165.

No.  119). \nDefendants have responded to each motion (Doc. No. 126).  Several hearings have been held, and \nthe Motion for Temporary Restraining Order will be treated as a Motion for Preliminary Injunction \nunder Rule  65(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff requests an injunction under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to \nenjoin Defendants: (1) from denying admission into the CHMS program to eligible children who \nI  1  5  0 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 2 of 20\nhave only one diagnosed medical, behavioral, or developmental delay, disability, or handicapping \ncondition; (2) from reducing early intervention day treatment services from 6 hours to 3.5 hours per \nchild, per day, regardless of the child's medical or psychological condition; (3) to publish the names \nofp  eer review physicians, upon request, to beneficiaries and providers; and (4) to publish regulations \nthat govern the prior authorization of CHMS services, in order to prevent Defendants from creating \nnew rules without notice to recipients or providers and using the new rules to deny CHMS services \nto eligible children. \nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction, Plaintiff is required to clearly demonstrate a \n\"substantial probability of success at trial by the moving party\" and possible \"irreparable injury to \nthe moving party\" if an injunction is not issued,  or to show that \"there are sufficiently serious \nI \nquestions going to the merits making them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships \ntipping decidedly toward plaintiff.'\"  For the reasons set forth below, I hold that Plaintiffhas not met \nits burden with respect to the first three issues; however, Defendants should be required to publish \nthe criteria upon which prior authorization is based (recognized standardized tests).  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED in \nPART and DENIED in PART. \nII.  THE MEDICAID ACT AND CHMS MODEL \nThe Medicaid program3 is a jointly funded federal-state program established by Congress in \n1965 to enable each State to furnish medical assistance to certain individuals. A state's participation \nFrejlach v. Butler, 573 F.2d 1026, 1027 (8th Cir. 1978). \nI \n,  Campbell \"66\" Exp., Inc. v.

Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, \nand the Arkansas Department of Human Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with \nadministering the program. \nIn 1967, Congress amended the Act to require early and periodic screening, diagnostic and \ntreatment (\"EPSDT\") services to  Medicaid-eligible children. Th<:  EPSDT reforms enacted by \nCongress in 1989 obligate participating states \"to provide a comprehensive package of preventive \nservices that meet reasonable standards of medical necessity.'\"  Under the EPSDT provisions, states \nare required to provide, in addition to screening, vision, dental, and hearing services, other health \ncare, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures which are necessary to correct or ameliorate \ndefects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by screening services, regardless \nof whether those services are covered under the state plan.6  These amendments, therefore, require \nstates to provide Medicaid coverage for any service \"identified as medically necessary through the \nEPSDT program.,,7 \nThe CHMS program is administered by ADHS and is \"the health care model that Arkansas \ncurrently uses to provide early intervention diagnostic and therapy services to Medicaid-eligible \nchildren between the ages of six months and six years.'\"  The CHMS program may be divided into \n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a). \n4 \n5  Rosie D. ex reI.

This goal is accomplished by providing full medical multi-\ndiscipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment in one location to more effectively intervene, treat, \nand prevent long-term disability for eligible children. \nEach CHMS clinic is staffed by a multidisciplinary team of medical professions, including \nnurses, social workers, therapists, and psychologists, who provide diagnostic and evaluation services. \nUnder this program, the primary care physician refers a child to a CHMS clinic for a \"diagnostic \nevaluation consisting of audiology,  medical,  behavioral,  speech,  language,  and psychological \nassessments.\"\"  Once the evaluation is complete, CHMS staff prepare an individualized treatment \nId at 475. \n9 \nId.

The program is meant to serve \n\"children who are not able to function or learn in a normal day can: setting such as Head Start.\"17 \nAlthough Arkansas's State Medicaid Plan need not specifically include CHMS early intervention \nday treatment services, ADHS cannot refuse to pay for the services for categorically needy children \nif they are medically necessary.I' \nJd. at 476. \n12 \nId. at 475.

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \nPlainti ff first contends that the CHMS program is designed to treat children who carry a \nprescription for, at a minimum, early intervention day treatment services and at least one form of \ntherapy19  Since ADHS contracted with AFMC to provide utilization controls of the CHMS \nprogram in 2000, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant AFMC has refused to recognize cognitive, \nadaptive, or personal/social areas of delay, and will only approve children who are severely delayed \nin terms of their motor or communication skills.20  By adopting these standards, Plaintiff contends, \nDefendants only admit children who have been prescribed early intervention day treatment and two \nor more forms of therapy.\"  This procedure, according to Plaintiff, violates the Medicaid Act \nbecause Defendants may not limit CHMS services to only those children with severe delays, and \nbecause admission based on the number of diagnoses ignores the requirement that Medicaid provide \nservices which are medically necessary.'2 \nDuring the hearings held in this matter, Plaintiff acknowledged that a child who has only \n19 \na prescription for early intervention day treatment services or one form of therapy would not be \nsubmitted to AFMC for admission into the CHMS program.  Plaintiff admits that, although early \nintervention day treatment services are available only in a CHMS setting, the services are meant to \nbe provided in conjunction with another form of therapy.  At one time, CHMS services were not \nsubject to any form of utilization review; CHMS services were prescribed by treating physicians, \nprovided and billed by CHMS facilities, and paid for by ADHS. ADHS routinely admitted children \nfor whom early intervention day treatment services and only one form of therapy were prescribed. \n20  Gross motor delays are treated with physical therapy, fine motor delays are treated with \noccupational therapy, and communication delays are treated with speech therapy. \n21  Affidavit of Melissa Thomas at ~ 2, Exhibit A. \n22  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l3) and 1396d(r). \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 7 of 20\nDefendants counter that, under the Medicaid Act, they are pennitted to use peer review \nphysicians to detennine whether prescribed services are medically necessary, in an effort to ensure \nthat  Medicaid funds  are only used for medically necessary treatments.  It is  well-settled that \n\"participating states are not required . . . to fund all medical services falling under one of the \nmandatory coverage categories ... because [Congress has conferred] 'broad discretion on the States \nto adopt standards for detennining the extent of medical assistance\" \"m to ensure that \"the largest \nnumber ofn ecessary medical services to the greatest number ofn eedy people.\"24 The Eighth Circuit, \nin Smith v. Rasmussen,\" recognized that each state is given \"broad discretion ... to adopt standards \nfor detennining the extent of medical assistance,\" as long as the standards are \"reasonable\" and \n\"consistent with the objectives of the Act.,,'6  Thus, a State \"may place appropriate limits on a \nservice based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures.\"\" \nCongress authorized each State to contract with utilization and quality control peer review \norganization to perfonn \"medical or utilization review functions ... with respect to specific services \nor providers.\"28  Under section 1320c-l, a \"utilization and quality control peer review organization \nconsists of licensed doctors of medicine ... engaged in the practice of medicine or surgery in the \nHern v.

If so, the \ntreatment is \"prior authorized\" and the child will be treated at a CHMS clinic. \n29  42U.S.C. § 1320c-\\. \n42 U.S.C. § 1320c-3. \n30 \n42 U.S.C. § 1320c-4. A dissatisfied beneficiary, provider, physician, or other practitioner \n31 \nseeking a reconsideration must submit a written request to the peer review organization that made \nthe initial determination within 60 days after receipt of the notice of an initial determination.  See \n42 C.F.R. §§ 478.18 and 478.20. \n32  42 C.F.R. § 478.24.  This section appears in the regulations governing the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services ofthe Department of Health and Human Services. \n33  See also CHMS Provider Manual, § 242.000, which sets forth the prior authorization \nprocedure to be followed by CHMS providers. \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 9 of 20\nDuring the hearing, AFMC representatives testified that AFMC's nurses and peer reviewers \nfocus on the number of prescriptions which are medically necessary when deciding whether to prior \nauthorize CHMS  services.  Because CHMS  services  are  defined  as  \"multidisciplinary care,\" \nDefendants interpret this to mean that the CHMS program is not designed to provide a single \ntreatment, such as physical therapy alone. Thus, CHMS services are typically approved for children \nwith multiple medical, behavioral, or developmental delays, disabilities, or handicapping conditions \nwho require multidisciplinary treatment.  Children with only a single diagnosis are also approved \nfor CHMS benefits, if the diagnosis is severe enough that multidisciplinary treatment is necessary. \nIf a primary care physician prescribes early intervention day treatment and only one form oftherapy, \nCHMS services are approved ifboth prescriptions are deemed to be medically necessary. However, \nif two treatments are prescribed and a peer reviewer determines that only one is medically necessary, \nCHMS multidisciplinary care is denied.34 \nPlaintiff argues that, because \"the decision of whether or not certain treatment .  IS \n'medically necessary' rests with the individual recipient's physician and not with clerical personnel \nor government officials.\"35  Applying this principle, Plaintiff contends that Defendants may not \nsecond-guess a physician's recommended treatment.  I agree that, ordinarily, \"[tJhe decision of \nwhether or not certain treatment or a particular type of surgery is 'medically necessary' rests with \nthe individual recipient's physician and not with clerical personnel or government officials.\"36 \nA child with only one medically necessary treatment, according to Defendants, may seek \n34 \ntreatment from a Medicaid-enrolled provider who provides that one service. If a CHMS provider \nis properly qualified, and enrolled to furnish the necessary single treatment, a child with only one \nprescription may receive his or her treatment at a CHMS facility. \nWeaver, 886 F.2d at 199. \n35 \nPinneke v. Preisser, 623 F.2d 546, 550 (8th Cir. 1980). \n36 \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 10 of 20\nDefendants maintain that the determination of whether services are medically necessary is \nnot solely reserved for the physician who prescribes the services, but may ultimately be decided by \npeer reviewers.37  I agree. \nCongress has authorized states to contract with peer review organizations for the final \ndetermination of whether services are medically necessary, despite the fact that each health care \npractitioner, physician, hospital or other health care facility, organization, or agency is required \"to \nassure, to the extent of his authority that services or items ordered or provided by such practitioner \nor person to beneficiaries and recipients under this chapter ... will be provided economically and \nonly when, and to the extent, medically necessary.,,3' \nBecause Congress has authorized Arkansas to contract with a peer review organization to \ndetermine whether services are medically necessary, I cannot hold that AFMC is required to approve \nservices for every prescription submitted for prior authorization, so Plaintiff s Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order on this specific point is DENIED39 \nB.  SEVERITY OF DELAY \nPlaintiff next contends that AFMC refuses to recognize a need for any form oft herapy unless \na child is severely delayed.  Before January I, 2003, according to Plaintiff, Defendants recognized \na need for therapy ift he need was equal to or less than a -1.3 standard deviation.40 Moreover, CHMS \n42 C.F.R. § 476.1 defines \"peer review\" as \"review by health care practitioners of services \n37 \nordered or furnished by other practitioners in the same professional field.\" \n42 U.S.C. § B20c-S. \n38 \nOnly after this procedure has been followed maya court review the denial of CHMS \n39 \nservices to determine whether AFMC's decision violates the Medicaid Act. \nAs I understand it, the standard deviation refers to the severity of a child's delay.  For \n40 \nexample, if tests reveal that a child's deviation from a standard norm is -1.3, the child is classified \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 11 of 20\nclinics are required to test each child before the prior authorization expires. Ift he child has improved \nabove a -1.5 standard deviation level, Defendants remove the child from the CHMS program. If the \nchild regresses below the -1.5 standard deviation, the child re-qualifies for CHMS services and is \nreadmitted.  According to Plaintiff, under this system, a child receives sporadic treatment and is \nnever able to obtain the maximum reduction of physical and mental disability and restoration to the \nbest possible functional level. Therefore, Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Defendants from limiting services \nbased on this standard.41 \nDefendants admit that AFMC reviews therapy requests to determine if the applicant's \nimpairment is -1.5 deviations below normal.  Defendants also assert that this impairment level is \ngenerally accepted as the threshold at which therapies become medically necessary, and denies that \nthe thresholdwas ever -1.3, as Plaintiff alleges but did not prove. For the same reasons set forth in \nthe previous section, I am unable to conclude that the standards established by AFMC as part of its \npeer review/prior authorization procedures are arbitrary or capricious. \nThe  Medicaid  Act  requires  that  treatments  administered  under the  Act comply  with \nprofessionally recognized standards4 Although Plaintiff has presented evidence that AFMC once \n' \napproved services for children with only a -1.3 standard deviation, Plaintiff has presented no \nevidence that the -1.5 standard deviation is not the professionally recognized standard at which \ntherapies become medically necessary. Moreover, the Eighth Circuit has recognized that a State may \nas moderately delayed.  A child who scores a -1.5 standard deviation is classified as severely \ndelayed. \n42 U.S.C. I 396d(a)(l 3). \n41 \n42 U.S.C. § B20c-5. \n42 \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 12 of 20\ndeny benefits upon based on the degree of medical necessity.43  Thus, I cannot compel Defendants \nto alter the standards established in the CHMS manual for admission into the program. For the Same \nreasons, I cannot require AFMC to continue to pay for CHMS services once a child improved above \nthe -1.5 standard deviation, although there is evidence that if a child is removed, he or she may \nregress. \nBased on the evidence presented during the various hearings held in this matter, I find that \nPlaintiff has failed to show that a likelihood of success on the merits on this particular issue.  The \nmotion to enjoin Defendants to alter the standards concerning the level at which admission into the \nCHMS program must be permitted is, therefore, DENIED. \nC.  REDUCTION OF EARLY INTERVENTION DAY TREATMENT SERVICES \nPlaintiff also seeks an injunction to prohibit AFMC from reducing early intervention day \ntreatment services from six hours to 3 or 3.5 hours per day, per child.  Plaintiff notes that, before, \nMarch 1, 2000, ADHS required providers to provide a minimum of six hours of early intervention \nday treatment service, depending on the severity of a child's developmental delays. Now AFMC will \nonly approvebetween 3 to 3.5 hours of early intervention day treatment services per child per day, \na level that will not result, Plaintiff contends, in the maximum reduction of physical and mental \nimpairment, and which will not restore the individual to the best possible functionallevel.44 \nPinneke, 623 F .2d at 550. \n43 \n44  Affidavit of Dr. Sharon Ramey at ~ 15, Exhibit B.  According to Dr. Ramey, the collective \nbody of research indicates that early intervention day treatment services result in the maximum \nreduction of physical and mental disability and restoration of an individual to the best-possible \nfunctional level when at least six hours of these services are provided per child per day. In contrast, \nDr. Ramey points out, there is no evidence that such lesser amounts produce any measurable benefits \nat all, much less the maximum reduction of disability or the best possible functional level. \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 13 of 20\nDefendants respond that there is no evidence of an \"across-the-board\" decision to reduce the \nnumber of hours available as part of early intervention day treatment services, and admit that such \na  decision would  violate  the  Medicaid  Act.  Instead,  Defendants  contend that the  six  hour \nrequirement should be altered because: (1) the fixed number is not based on medical necessity, and \ninevitably results in unnecessary services, which violates the Medicaid Act; (2) it wastes resources \nby failing to match needs and services; and (3) it overpays providers for children who need less than \nsix hours of treatment. \nDefendants argue that each child is different, and the determination of the length of early \nintervention day treatment services necessary to ensure the maximum reduction of physical and \nmental impairment and functional restoration should be performed on a case-by-case basis. In other \nwords, the Medicaid Act prohibits the disbursement of funds for services which are not medically \nnecessary.  Because not all children have the same needs, the length of early intervention day \ntreatment services should vary depending on the child's needs. \nI recognize that Plaintiff has presented evidence that indicated that six hours of early \nintervention day treatment results in the maximum reduction of physical and mental disability but \nbased on the principles outlined above, I cannot say that the approval of the number of hours a child \nreceives in early intervention day treatment, if based on an individualized determination of medical \nnecessity, violates the Medicaid Act.  As noted, however, a rule limiting the amount of services for \nall children, regardless of the severity of their delays and  without consideration of a  child's \ndiagnosed condition, his prescribed treatment, and the accumulated knowledge of the medical \ncommunity,\" may well run afoul of the Medicaid Act's requirements that services be based on \nPinneke, 623 F.2d at 549. \n45 \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 14 of 20\nmedical necessity.  To the extent that Plaintiff seeks an order enjoining Defendants from limiting \nservices based on a case-by-case assessment of each prescription for CHMS services, the Motion is \nDENIED. \nD. PUBLICATION OF REGULATIONS \nFinally, Plaintiff contends that AFMC should be enjoined to publish regulations that govern \nthe prior authorization ofCHMS services.  At this time, Plaintiff asserts that AFMC does not do so, \nwhich enables it to create new rules, without notice to CHMS recipients and providers, in order to \ndeny CHMS services to eligible children. As one example, Ms. Bell testified that Defendants often \ndeny prescribed services on the ground that a test used to evaluate a child's needs is not recognized \nby Defendants.  AFM C' s Amy Carson stated during one of the hearings in this matter that a list of \naccepted tests is being put together by different therapy associations, but that the list is incomplete \nand has not been received by AFMC. \nThe Eighth Circuit has already warned that providers are required to \"inform Medicaid \nrecipients about the EPSDT services that are available to them and ... must arrange for the \ncorrective treatments prescribed by physicians.\"46  Defendants are not permitted to \"shirk [their] \nresponsibilities to Medicaid recipients by burying information about available services in a complex \nbureaucratic scheme.\"47 \nDuring the hearing, Ms. Bell testified that the example cited above was only one of many, \nand that obtaining prior authorization from AFMC has become a trial by which the blind are \nessentially leading the blind.  Although Defendants insist that their guidelines are available to \nPediatric Spec. Care, Inc., 289 F.3d at 481. \n46 \nId. \n47 \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 15 of 20\nproviders upon request, they have clearly been denying services based on unpublished criteria. This \nis contrary to  the  Eighth  Circuit  admonition  mentioned  above.  Nor may  Defendants  bury \nrequirements or standards for various services so that providers are unable to comply with those \nrequirements by providing the proper information and  records.  Accordingly,  until AFMC's \nrequirements and standards for CHMS services is published, including the tests required to obtain \nservices, Defendants are enjoined from arbitrarily denying services based on unpublished criteria, \nand from changing its criteria without notice to providers and recipients of Medicaid benefits. \nProviders are also required to certify that the care or services \"wi1l be of a quality which meets \nprofessionally recognized standards of health care ... and will be supported by evidence of medical \nnecessity and quality in such form and fashion and at such time as may reasonably be required by \na reviewing peer review organization in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities.\"\" \nE. DISCLOSURE OF NAMES \nPlaintiff seeks  an Order enjoining Defendants to  reveal  the names of peer reviewers \nresponsible for determining when and whether services are medically necessary.  Congress has \naddressed this point and has stated that peer review organizations are not \"federal agencies\" for \npurposes of the Freedom ofInformation Act, and: \n1 \n[Any  \"data or information acquired by any such organization in the exercise of its \nduties and functions shall be held in confidence and shall not be disclosed to any \nperson except: \n(I) to the extent that may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, \n(2) in such cases and under such circumstances as the Secretary shall by regulations \nprovide to assure adequate protection of the rights and interests of patients, health \ncare practitioners, or providers of health care, or \n42 U.S.C. § 1320c-5. \n48 \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 16 of 20\n(3)  in accordance with subsection (b) of this section.49 \nSubsection (b) lists specific instances where the peer review organization \"shall\" provide date \nan information, none of which includes the scenario set forth by Plaintiff, when Plaintiff wants the \nname to challenge the peer review physician.  Moreover, under subsection ( c), the statute provides \nthat it is illegal to disclose the information for any other reason, and may result in a fine of not more \nthan $1,000 and imprisonment of 6 months, together with the costs ofp rosecution. Section (d) goes \nso far as to specifically provide that \"no patient record in the possession of an organization ... shall \nbe subject to subpoena or discovery proceedings in a civil action.\"50 \nThere is a federal regulation that explains this more effectively, providing that, \"at the request \n1 \nof a provider, practitioner or beneficiary, the [peer review organization  must provide an opportunity \nfor examination ofthe material upon which the initial denial determination was based.\"51 However, \nunder the regulations, the peer review organization is absolutely prohibited from furnishing any of \nthe following: \n(1) A record of the PRO deliberation; or \n(2) The identity of the PRO review coordinators, physician advisors, or consultants who \nassisted in the initial denial determination without their consent. 52 \nI do not cotton to the notion that \"secret doctors\" are able to perform peer reviews; it seems to me \nthat this procedure places Medicaid beneficiaries and providers at an unfair advantage when they \nattempt to challenge the denial of benefits based on a peer reviewers assessment.  Although I do not \n42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9. \n49 \n50  42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9. \n51  42 C.F.R. § 478.24. \nId. \n52 \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 17 of 20\nlike it at all, it appears to be the law, and I therefore DENY Plaintiffs Motion to compel the \npublication of peer reviewer's names. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn previous orders, I have held that the Arkansas Department of Human Services may not \nrefuse to provide CHMS services in all cases under the Medicaid Act.  Now, Plaintiff asks that \n53 \nAFMC be required to approve all prescriptions for CHMS services; to compel Defendants to lower \nthe standards they have set for admission into the program; and to disclose the names of peer \nreviewers who make the decision to deny services.  After reviewing the applicable law, Plaintiffs \nMotion is DENIED with respect to these points. However, it is clear that Defendants deny services \nbased on standards which are not always published (the DAY  C test example). In this regard, I hold \nthat Plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm; therefore, \nPlaintiffs Motion is GRANTED, and Defendants are enjoined from denying services based on an \nunpublished list of accepted testing criteria.  Further, Defendants must forthwith compile a list of \nrecognized tests which establish a need for the various therapies and services provided by CHMS \nproviders. \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (Doc. \nNo. 117) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in PART; however, Plaintiffs Motion to Show Cause \n(Doc. No.  1 J 9) should also be, and hereby is, DENIED.  Notwithstanding this holding, I leave \nThis holding reflects the well-established principle that, although a State has considerable \n53 \ndiscretion in fashioning its Medicaid program, the discretion of the state is not unbridled.  A state \nmay not \"arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, duration, or scope of a required service ... to an \notherwise eligible recipient solely because of the diagnosis, type of illness or condition.\"  Weaver, \n886 F.2d at 197-98. \n17 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 150   Filed 05/28/04   Page 18 of 20\nDefendants with a quote from Salazar v.

PLAINTIFFS \nVS.  CASE NO. 4:01CV00830 WRW \nARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN \nSERVICES; ET AL.  DEFENDANTS \nAMENDED INJUNCTION \nConsistent with the Eighth Circuit's opinion and mandate entered on the district court \ndocket on July 15, 2002, the December 19, 200 I If\\iunction is amended as follows: \nDefendants are not obligated to specifically include Child Health Management Services \nProgram (\"CHMS\") early intervention day treatment services in the Arkansas State Medicaid \nPlan (\"State Plan\").  It is defendants' position that there are no funds specifically dedicated to \nCHMS early intervention day treatment services.  Thus, they contend that they cannot be \nenjoined from cutting funding which does not exist.  If this is the case, then defendant is correct, \ni.e. they cannot be enjoined from cutting funds which do not exist.  Therefore, I enjoin the \ndefendants to pay' for early intervention day treatment services when prescribed by a physician \nfor the purpose stated in the Medicaid Act.  Where defendants get the money, and what \nmechanism they establish to pay for these services, are left up to them,  Moreover, under 42 \n'The Eighth Circuit uses  \"provide,\" \"reimburse,\" and \"pay\" when addressing the \ndefendants' duty regarding early intervention day treatment services,  For  consistency's sake, I \nwill use the verb \"pay,\" \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 41   Filed 07/30/02   Page 2 of 4\nU.S.C'. § 1396a (43) the State has a duty to infonn Medicaid recipients (I) about early and \nperiodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment (\"EPSDT\") services (which include early \nintervention day treatment services), and (2) that the State must arrange for the corrective \ntreatments prescribed by physicians. \nThe Eighth Circuit did not directly discuss defendants' duty to provide  therapy to \nMedicaid recipients because defendant Arkansas Department of Human Services during oral \narguments at the Eighth Circuit stated that CHMS therapists could enroll as Medicaid therapists \nunder the new state plan.  Since the 8th Circuit affirmed my December 19, 2001 Order on all \npoints except the one concerning the naming of CHMS early intervention day treatment services, \nmy ruling that defendants could not cut funding to therapy services stands.  However, to be \nconsistent (and to follow the 8th Circuit's directions), the December 19th Injunction is amended to \nprovide that the defendants do not have to include CHMS therapy in the State Plan, but like the \nearly intervention day treatment services, they do have to pay for the therapy, provide a \nmechanism for this payment, and they must inform Medicaid recipients about the available \ntherapy services. \nThe 8th Circuit stated that it understood that under the State Plan the \ndiagnostic and evaluation leg of CHMS [ would remain] intact, meaning that a \nphysician would still refer a child to aCHMS clinic for an evaluation, the staff at \nthe CHMS clinic would perfonn the evaluation, and a CHMS physician would \nrecommend the needed therapies.2 \nBased on this language, defendants are enjoined to continue to pay for the \"diagnostic and \nevaluation leg\" of CHMS, and to infonn Medicaid recipients in an understandable manner about \n'Pediatric Speciality Care, Inc.  v.

However, like the early intervention day treatment services, and therapy services, \ndefendants may use another mechanism (i.e., other than CHMS) to pay for the \"diagnostic and \nevaluation\" services. \nTo summarize and conclude, defendants do not have to specifically include CHMS early \nintervention day treatment services, therapies and other treatments, or diagnostic and evaluation \nservices, by name, in the State Plan, but they do have to pay for the these services (and provide a \nmechanism for payment) when prescribed by a physician for the purpose stated in the Medicaid \nAct.

The Court has federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n15.  The Court has civil rights jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1343. \n16.  The Court has venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 5 of 29\n17.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1396, et seq. (1992 & Supp. \n2000), commonly referred to as the Medicaid Act, is ajoint federal and state program designed \nto provide \"medical assistance\" to qualified persons. \n18.  Under the Medicaid Act, if a state agrees to establish a Medicaid plan (\"State \nplan\") that satisfies the requirements of Title XIX, the federal government will pay a specified \npercentage of the total amount expended as \"medical assistance\" under the plan. \n19.  Participation in the Medicaid program is voluntary, but if a state elects to \nparticipate, it must do so in accordance with federal statutes and regulations. \n20.  The federal Department of Health and Human Services is charged with \nadministration of the Medicaid program, and has delegated much of its responsibility to Centers \nfor Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). \n21.  Arkansas participates in the Medicaid program, and Arkansas Department of \nHuman Services (\"ADHS\") is the state agency charged with administration of the Medicaid \nprogram in Arkansas. \n22.  The Medicaid Act defmes \"medical assistance\" as \"payment of part or all of the \ncost of [enumerated] care and services\". \n23.  Some services are mandatory and must be provided under the State plan. \n24.  Mandatory services include those provided under the early and periodic \nscreening, diagnostic, and treatment services (\"EPSDT\") provisions of the Medicaid Act. \n25.  EPSDT services include those provided under the CHMS program. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 6 of 29\n26.  The CHMS program comprises an array of clinic services that are intended to \nprovide full medical multi-discipline diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for the purpose of \nintervention, treatment, and prevention oflong-term disability for eligible children. \n27.  Generally stated, services under the CHMS program can be broken down into \nthree broad categories:  (1) diagnosis and evaluation services, (2) therapy services, and (3) early \nintervention day treatment services. \n28.  CHMS therapy services include physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational \ntherapy, and psychotherapy. \n29.  CHMS early intervention day treatment services include cognitive development \nservices, developmental motor activity services, and self-care and social/emotional \ndevelopmental services. \n30.  When the CHMS program fust went into effect, a child could enter the program \nbased on a referral from his or her physician (referred to in Medicaid terms as the Primary Care \nPhysician or \"PCP\"). \n31.  Diagnostic and evaluation services were provided by CHMS staff, and, as \nrequired by EPSDT, treatment plans were developed for the treatment of all developmental \ndisabilities that were discovered during the screening process. \n32.  A treatment plan included the various CHMS therapy and early intervention day \ntreatment services requested by clinic staff, and the number of units of service that should be \nprovided over a certain period of time, consistent with applicable standards of medical practice. \n33.  After a treatment plan was developed for a particular child, it was submitted to the \nPCP for approval. \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 7 of 29\n34.  If the PCP approved the treatment plan, CHMS services were provided in \naccordance with the plan, the CHMS provider billed ADHS for the services it provided, and \nADHS paid the bill. \n35.  Initially, payment for CHMS services was fairly straightforward:  for each service \nprovided under the treatment plan, payment was determined by multiplying the number of units \nof service actually provided by the rate for that service as published by ADHS in the State plan. \n36.  Given the nature of this fee-for-service formula, ADHS could reduce payment for \nCHMS services by either reducing the rates for those services, or the number of units of service \nthat could be provided over a certain period of time. \n37.  When the CHMS program fust went into effect, CHMS clinics provided, on \naverage, six hours of early intervention day treatment services (referred to in Medicaid terms as \n\"core services \") per child per day, five days a week. \n38.  ADHS routinely reimbursed providers for this amount of core services (six hours \nper child per day, five days per week) at rates published by ADHS in the State plan. \n39.  In the fall of 1997, payment for core services was approximately $125.00 per \nchild per day. \n40.  ADHS, in an effort to reduce payments under the CHMS program, asked CHMS \nproviders if the rates for core services could be reduced or handled in such a way so as to make \nthe program less expensive. \n41.  Based on this call, a work group consisting of ADHS staff and CHMS providers \nwas created. \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 8 of 29\n42.  As a result of their work, an agreement was reached that limited the daily \npayment for core services to $95.00 per child per day. \n43.  This agreement went into effect on April 1, 1998, and provided as follows: \nEffective for claims with dates of service on or after April I, 1998, the Division of \nMedical Services will implement a $95.00 per day rate for the CHMS-Early \nIntervention Services (ages 0 through 5) procedure codes.  One day of care will be \ndefined as a minimum of 6 hours of service that can include the following \nprocedures with maximums noted below. \n99211 \n99212 \nZI570 \nZ1571 (Maximum 3 units) \nZ1572 \nZ1575 \n44.  Despite this agreement, ADHS announced in early 1999 that the daily rate for \ncore services would be reduced from $95.00 to $75.00 per child per day. \n45.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley decided to reduce the rate for core \nservices for purely budgetary reasons. \n46.  Prior to reducing the daily rate for core services, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. \nHanley failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and equal access as \nrequired by federal law . \n47.  ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley refused to conduct a study that \nconsidered those factors, and a lawsuit was filed to enjoin their decision. \n48.  The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nArkansas, Western Division, given Case No. LR-C-99-810, and assigned to the Honorable James \nM.Moody. \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 9 of 29\n49.  The plaintiff filed a motion for temporary injunctive relief along with its \nComplaint. \n50.  The Court conducted a hearing with respect to the plaintiff s motion, and ruled \nthat the defendants failed to consider the factors of efficiency, economy, quality of care, and \nequal access before they reduced the daily rate for core services. \n51.  The Court concluded that the defendants violated the federal statutory rights of \nthe plaintiff as provided by 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), and issued a preliminary injunction that \nstopped the rate reduction before it went into effect. \n52.  An order to that effect was filed with the Court on November 5, 1999. \n53.  Thereafter, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley submitted an ofler of \njudgment to the plaintiff. \n54.  The plaintiff accepted their offer, and a Judgment reflecting the agreement was \nfiled on December 14, 1999. \n55.  In accordance with this agreement, ADHS, Mr. Knickrehm, and Mr. Hanley were \npermanently enjoined from implementing the $75.00 daily rate for core services.  They were also \nordered to not reduce rates for services under the CHMS program below the rates in effect on \nNovember 6, 1999, unless the reduction is based on an analysis of the costs incurred by efficient \nand economic providers of such services and are established in conformity with applicable state \nand federal laws. \n56.  During that time, ADHS, acting through Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \ndeveloped a \"utilization control\" program that requires \"prior authorization\" of CHMS services. \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 10 of 29\n57.  Generally stated, the Medicaid Act recognizes prior authorization as an accepted \nfonn of utilization control that a State may use to verify a patient's need for Medicaid services \nbefore those services are provided. \n58.  Prior authorization is an inherent state action, which may be conducted by the \nState or a private contractor hired by the State. \n59.  According to the prior authorization program developed by Mr. Knickrehrn and \nMr. Hanley, there are now two \"layers\" of prior authorization under the CHMS program. \n60.  The first layer of prior authorization applies to the admission of children into the \nCHMS program, and went into effect on October 1, 1999. \n61.  The second layer of prior authorization applies to the number of units of CHMS \nservices a child may receive over a certain period of time, and went into effect on March I, 2000. \n62.  ADHS contracted with AFMC to implement the two layers of prior authorization \ndeveloped by Mr. Knickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \n63.  The CHMS Provider Manual requires AFMC to consider requests for CHMS \nservices within 15 working days. \n64.  At all times described herein, AFMC was acting as the agent of ADHS for the \npurpose of prior authorizing CHMS services under the State plan. \nCOUNT ONE:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 11 of 29\n65.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n66.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n67.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the first layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have a developmental delay in only \none area. \n68.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children who are diagnosed as \nsuffering a developmental delay, not just those who have developmental delays in more than one \narea. \n69.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with developmental delays in only one area. \n70.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with developmental delays in only \none area. \n71.  Before the defendants can use the first layer of prior authorization to limit \nadmission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings \n11 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 12 of 29\ncan be achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and \nequal access as required by 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n72.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n73.  The defendants understand that may not use the first layer of prior authorization \nto limit admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost \nsavings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of \ncare, and equal access. \n74.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n75.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n76.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n77.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n78.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT TWO:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.c. § 1396d(a)(]3) \nUNDER THE FIRST LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n12 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 13 of 29\n79.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the first layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n80.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish this purpose, have directed AFMC to use the first layer of prior \nauthorization to limit the admission of qualified children into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n81.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the fust layer of prior authorization to deny \nadmission into the CHMS program to eligible children who have a developmental delay in only \none area. \n82.  In accordance with EPSDT, the CHMS program was designed to provide therapy \nand early intervention day treatment services to all eligible children diagnosed as suffering a \ndevelopmental delay, not just those with developmental delays in more than one area. \n83.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS did not limit \nCHMS services to children with developmental delays in only one area. \n84.  Before the first layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for services provided to children with developmental delays in only \none area. \n85.  By llsing the first layer of prior authorization to deny admission into the CHMS \nprogram to children with developmental delays in only one area, the defendants, while acting \nllI1der color of state law, have violated, and continue to violate, the rights of these children to \nCHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l3). \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 14 of 29\n86.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to children, \nbut continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \nthe level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n87.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n88.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n89.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n90.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n91.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n92.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 15 of 29\n93.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n94.  Before the defendants can use the second layer of prior authorization to deny \nservices to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre-determined cost savings can \nbe achieved, ADHS must consider the factors of economy, efficiency, quality of care, and equal \naccess as required by 42 U.S.C. § 13 96a(a)(30)(A). \n95.  ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n96.  The defendants understand that they may not use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that the pre \ndetermined cost savings can be achieved unless ADHS considers the factors of economy, \nefficiency, quality of care, and equal access. \n97.  The defendants understand that ADHS has failed to consider these factors. \n98.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrehrn and Mr. Hanley. \n99.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n100.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehrn, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n101.  For these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n15 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 16 of 29\nCOUNT FOUR:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(]3) \nUNDER THE SECOND LAYER OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION \n102.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the second layer of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n103.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to deny core services to children admitted into the CHMS program so that their \npre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n104.  AFMC has used, and continues to use, the second layer of prior authorization to \ncut the provision of core services from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, \nregardless of the child's medical or psychological condition. \n105.  Six hours of CHMS core services per child per day results in the maximum \nreduction of physical and mental disabilities, and restores children to their best-possible \nfunctional level. \n106.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS defined one \nday of care as a minimum of six hours of CHMS core services per child per day. \n107.  Before the second layer of prior authorization went into effect, ADHS routinely \nreimbursed CHMS providers for six hours of core services per child per day. \n108.  The current level ofCHMS core services approved by AFMC per child per day \ndoes not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental disabilities, and does not \nrestore children to their best-possible functional level. \n16 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 17 of 29\n109.  The defendants understand that the current level of CHMS core services approved \nby AFMC per child per day does not result in the maximum reduction of physical and mental \ndisabilities, and does not restore children to their best-possible functional level. \n110.  The defendants understand that they are denying mandatory services to eligible \nchildren, but continue to do so for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS \nprogram to a level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n111.  Despite their understanding, AFMC continues to use the second layer of prior \nauthorization to reduce payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by Mr. \nKnickrelml and Mr. Hanley. \n112.  By using the second layer of prior authorization to cut the provision of core \nservices to all children from six hours per child per day to 3.5 hours per child per day, the \ndefendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated the rights of these children to \nCHMS services mandated by 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(l3). \n113.  To ensure that the children treated by the plaintiff providers receive the maximum \nreduction of their physical and mental disabilities, and are restored to their best-possible \nfunctional level, they have continued to provide six hours of core services per child per day. \n114.  The provider plaintiffs are entitled to payment for the provision of such services. \n115.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights ofthe plaintiffs. \n116.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \n17 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 18 of 29\nCOUNT FIVE:  VIOLATION OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS \n117.  Based on info=ation and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-dete=ined by them. \n118.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have directed AFMC to not publish regulations that \ngovern the prior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to \nrecipients or providers, and use those rules to deny CHMS services to eligible children so that \ntheir pre-dete=ined cost savings can be achieved. \n119.  AFMC has refused, and continues to refuse, to publish regulations that govern the \nprior authorization of CHMS services so that it can create new rules, without notice to recipients \nor providers, and use those rules to deny services to children admitted into the CHMS program. \n120.  For example, AFMC has refused to publish regulations that define: \na.  The info=ation needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may be \nadmitted into the CHMS program; \nb.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nbe admitted into the CHMS program; \nc.  The info=ation needed by AFMC to dete=ine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \nd.  The medical standards used by AFMC to dete=ine whether a child may \nreceive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; \n18 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 19 of 29\ne.  The information needed by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amounts ofCHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan; and \nf.  The medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether a child may \nreceive the amount of CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan. \n121.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many \noccasions refused to admit children because their CHMS providers failed to submit information \nthey were never told to provide. \n122.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may be admitted into the CHMS program, AFMC has on many occasions taken \nadvantage of the lack of published standards to refuse admission to children based on standards \nof its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n123.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment \nplan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS providers \nfailed to submit information they were never told to provide. \n124.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC has on \nmany occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to children \nbased on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical practice. \n125.  By refusing to publish regulations that govern the information needed by AFMC \nto determine whether a child may receive the amounts of CHMS services set forth in the child's \n19 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 20 of 29\ntreatment plan, AFMC has on many occasions denied services to children because their CHMS \nproviders failed to submit information they were never told to provide. \n126.  By refusing to publish the medical standards used by AFMC to determine whether \na child may receive the amount of CHMS services set forth in the child's treatment plan, AFMC \nhas on many occasions taken advantage of the lack of published standards to refuse services to \nchildren based on standards of its own making and clearly inconsistent with accepted medical \npractice. \n127.  Such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly irrational, conscious shocking, and \noffensive to traditional notions of fairness. \n128.  The defendants understand that such conduct is arbitrary, capricious, truly \nirrational, conscious shocking, and offensive to traditional notions of fairness, but continue to \nengage in such conduct for the mere purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to \na level pre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n129.  By such conduct, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights to substantive due process under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. \n13 O.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n131.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SIX:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8) \n20 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 21 of 29\n132.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose ofreducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n133.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have authorized AFMC to not consider requests for \nservices with reasonable promptness so that their pre-determined cost savings can be achieved. \n134.  AFMC often refuses to follow the regulation set forth in the CHMS Provider \nManual that requires it to process requests for services within 15 business days. \n135.  AFMC often takes at least a month, and sometimes as long as five months, to \nprocess requests for services. \n136.  Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \\396a(a)(8), the State Plan \"must ... provide that all \nindividuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have \nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to \nall eligible individuals\". \n137.  The defendants understand that they must consider requests for CHMS services \nwith reasonable promptness. \n138.  The defendants understand that they must consider requests for CHMS services \nwithin 15 working days. \n139.  Despite their understanding, AFMC often refuses to consider requests for CHMS \nservices with reasonable promptness to reduce payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley. \n21 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 22 of 29\n140.  F or these reasons, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have \nviolated, and continue to violate, the plaintiffs' rights under 42 U.S.c. § 1396a(a)(8). \n141.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n142.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, Mr. Jeffus, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SEVEN:  VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3) \n143.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, \nwhile acting under color of state law, developed the process of prior authorization for the \npurpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to a level pre-determined by them. \n144.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children \nwho are denied admission into the CHMS program under the first layer of prior authorization. \n145.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm, Mr. Hanley, and Mr. \nJeffus, in order to accomplish their purpose, have refused to provide a fair hearing to children \nwho have CHMS services denied to them under the second layer of prior authorization. \n146.  Although ADHS provides an appeal to CHMS recipients, it does not provide an \nappeal to CHMS providers. \n147.  When an appeal is filed, ADHS refuses to tell the CHMS recipient the name of \nthe nurses and doctors employed by AFMC who made the adverse decisions against them. \n22 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 23 of 29\n148.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe opinions fonned by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against the child. \n149.  Without such infonnation, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe basis of the opinions fonned by the nurses and doctors who will be called to testify against \nthe child. \n150.  Without such information, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to determine \nthe infonnation upon which the nurses and doctors relied in fonning their opinions. \n151.  Without such infonnation, it is impossible for the CHMS recipient to receive a \nfair hearing. \n152.  Several months ago, plaintiffs Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. and Child & Youth \nPediatric Day Clinics, Inc. submitted a request to ADHS pursuant to the Arkansas Freedom of \nInfonnation Act in which they requested the names of the nurses and doctors employed by \nAFMC who make these decisions. \n153.  ADHS refused to provide the requested infonnation, and referred the plaintiffs to \nAFMC. \n154.  The plaintiffs requested the same infonnation from AFMC, and it refused to \nprovide the infonnation as well. \n155.  In order to get this information, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against AFMC under \nthe Arkansas Freedom of Infonnation Act. \n156.  On January 15,2003, Pulaski County Circuit Judge John Ward ordered AFMC to \nproduce the requested infonnation. \n23 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 24 of 29\n157.  AFMC filed a motion to reconsider, and Pulaski County Circuit Judge Jay Moody \naffirmed Judge Ward's decision in all respects. \n158.  AFMC did not appeal that decision, and the time has run for tiling an appeal. \n159.  Since that time, a CHMS recipient suffered an adverse decision at the hands of \nAFMC. \n160.  The CHMS recipient filed an appeal, and asked AFMC to identify the nurses and \ndoctors who issued the adverse decision. \n161.  Although Judge Ward and Judge Moody previously rejected AFMC's legal \nargument that such information was protected from disclosure under federal law, AFMC refused \nto tell the CHMS recipient the names of the doctors and nurses who issued the adverse decision \nagainst her. \n162.  As the basis for refusing to give such information to the CHMS recipient, AFMC \nrelied on the same argument previously rejected by Judge Ward and Judge Moody. \n163.  Based on information and reasonable belief, Mr. Knickrehm and Mr. Hanley, in \norder to accomplish their purpose of reducing payments under the CHMS program to the level \npre-determined by them, instructed AFMC to not identify the doctors and nurses who issue \nadverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n164.  By refusing to provide such information to CHMS recipients who seek to appeal \nadverse decisions, the defendants, while acting under color of state law, have violated, and \ncontinue to violate, their right to a fair hearing under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3). \n165.  The conduct of the defendants has been willful and malicious, and in knowing \nviolation of the rights of the plaintiffs. \n24 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 25 of 29\n166.  For these reasons, punitive damages should be imposed against Mr. Knickrehm, \nMr. Hanley, and AFMC so as to deter similar conduct in the future. \nCOUNT SEVEN:  VIOLATION OF PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS \n167.  On May 28, 2004, the District Court issued an Order which states that 42 U.S.C. § \n1320c-9 and 42 C.F.R. § 478.24 protect disclosure of the names of the doctors and nurses who \nissue adverse decisions against CHMS recipients. \n168.  Given the District Court's decision, these statutes violate the rights of the \nplaintiffs to procedural due process because they deny CHMS recipients and providers the right \nto a fair hearing with respect to adverse decisions made by the defendants. \n169.  Without the names of the doctors and nurses who issue adverse decisions against \nCHMS recipients, CHMS recipients and providers have no opportunity to speak with these \ndoctors and nurses prior to an appeal hearing to determine the reasons for the denial of CHMS \nservIces. \n170.  Without the names of the doctors and nurses who issue adverse decisions against \nCHMS recipients, CHMS recipients and providers have no opportunity to compel the presence of \nthese doctors and nurses at the appeal hearing, to confront these doctors and nurses at the appeal \nhearing, and cross examine these doctors and nurses with respect to their denial of CHMS \nservIces. \nINCORPORATION OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT \n25 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 173    Filed 07/07/04   Page 26 of 29\n171.

Because the district court’s order is at odds with\nthe relevant Medicaid regulations, we reverse.\n-3-\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe general background to this case is detailed in our prior decisions in\nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc., v. Arkansas Department of Human Services, 293 F.3d\n472 (8th Cir. 2002); Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas Department of Human\nServices, 364 F.3d 925 (8th Cir. 2004); and Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Arkansas\nDepartment of Human Services, No. 05-1668, issued today.  In short, this case stems\nfrom ADHS’s attempts to curtail the services it provides to needy children in\nArkansas pursuant to the Medicaid Act.  ADHS contracts with AFMC to review\napplications for Medicaid services and to determine whether and to what extent\napplicants qualify for those services.  The plaintiffs are applicants for Medicaid\nservices, both as recipients and providers.  They contend that ADHS and AFMC\nmanipulate their system of prior authorization so as to deny medically necessary\nservices to qualified, Medicaid-eligible children solely for the state’s financial\nbenefit.\nAs relevant to this appeal, one of the plaintiffs in this matter, Tomorrow’s\nChild Learning Center, LLC, moved the district court for a temporary restraining\norder requiring AFMC (and, consequently, ADHS) to disclose to Medicaid service\nrecipients  and  providers  the  names  of  the  physician  reviewers  who  made\ndeterminations regarding whether and to what extent children were eligible for\ntreatment.  By order dated May 28, 2004, the court treated this motion as one for a\npreliminary injunction and denied the motion, holding that such disclosure was\nprohibited by applicable Medicaid Act provisions and regulations.  Several months\nlater, the district court informed the parties that it was reconsidering its earlier\ndecision and solicited letter briefs on the matter.  On November 29, 2004, the court\nissued an order reversing its May 28, 2004 decision.  In the decision, the court held\nthat the plaintiffs “may discover the name, qualifications, and identity of each peer\nreview physician and advisor who participated in the denial of medical benefits,\nbased on the premise that the care did not meet medical necessity requirements,” but\n-4-\n\nthat the plaintiffs “may not discover any patient records of non-parties, nor may\nPlaintiffs discover any material produced by [AFMC] that evaluated the failure of a\nparticular medical provider to follow professional standards of care.”  (Dist. Ct. Order\nof Nov. 29, 2004 at 15.)  This appeal followed.\nANALYSIS\n“We review a district court’s grant or denial of preliminary injunctive relief for\nan abuse of discretion or misplaced reliance on an erroneous legal principle.”  Goff\nv. Harper, 60 F.3d 518, 520 (8th Cir. 1995).  This is a “deferential standard,” only\npermitting us to reverse the district court if, “after a thorough review of the record,\nthe proof unmistakably establishes clear error or an abuse of discretion.”  FTC v.\nFreeman Hosp., 69 F.3d 260, 267 (8th Cir. 1995).\nOrdinarily, the district court is to consider four factors in deciding whether to\nissue the preliminary injunction: (1) the threat of irreparable harm, (2) the balance\nbetween that harm and the injury to the non-moving party if the injunction is granted,\n(3) the probability of success on the merits of the claim, and (4) whether granting the\ninjunction would benefit the public interest.  Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc.,\n640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc).\nAFMC and ADHS assert that the district court’s order must be reversed\nbecause it conflicts with provisions of the Medicaid Act, as well as regulations\ninterpreting the Act that protect the confidentiality of peer reviewers.  The plaintiffs\nargue that the district court’s order is not a final appealable matter, because the\ndistrict court did not explicitly go through a Dataphase analysis.  We disagree, and\nthus undertake analysis of whether the order was properly issued.  Accord Baker Elec.\nCo-Op,  Inc.  v.  Chaske,  28  F.3d  1466,  1472  (8th  Cir.  1994)  (characterizing  a\ntemporary  restraining  order  as  a  preliminary  injunction  and  undertaking  a\nDataphase analysis even though the district court failed to do so).\n-5-\n\nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9(a), data and information collected by a peer\nreview organization such as AFMC “shall be held in confidence and shall not be\ndisclosed,”  except  in  very  limited  circumstances.    “No  patient  record  in  the\npossession of [a peer review organization] shall be subject to subpoena or discovery\nproceedings in a civil action.”  § 1320c-9(d).  The statute states more specifically that\ninformation reviewed by a peer review organization in order to determine if the\nprovider’s quality of care meets professional standards is privileged from discovery.\nId. (referencing §§ 1320c-3(a)(1)(B) and 1320c-5(a)(2)).\nThe Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is charged by statute with\nthe authority to promulgate regulations regarding the confidentiality of patient\nrecords held by peer review organizations.  Those regulations must “assure adequate\nprotection of the rights and interests of patients, health care practitioners, or providers\nof health care.”  42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9(a)(2).  HHS has issued such regulations, which\ninterpret  what  information  is  subject  to  disclosure  and  what  information  is\nconfidential.  The regulations deem information confidential if it “explicitly or\nimplicitly identifies an individual patient, practitioner, or reviewer,” and all peer\nreview deliberations.  42 C.F.R. § 480.101(b) (emphasis added).  The regulation\ndefines peer review deliberations to include “review notes, minutes of meetings and\nany other records of discussions and judgments involving matters regarding [peer\nreview] responsibilities and appeals from [peer review organization] determinations,\nin which the opinions of, or judgment about, a particular individual or institution can\nbe discerned.”  § 480.101(b)(4).  Peer review organizations generally may not\ndisclose confidential information, subject to limited exceptions.  See generally 42\nC.F.R.  §§  480.130-480.143  (regulations  regarding  disclosure  of  confidential\ninformation).\nWithin the regulations concerning disclosure of confidential information, it is\nstated that a peer review organization “must not disclose its deliberations,” except to\nfederal governmental agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\n-6-\n\nServices, the Office of the Inspector General, or the General Accounting Office.  42\nC.F.R. § 480.139(a)(1).  The regulations further state that a peer review organization\nmay only disclose “information on a particular practitioner or reviewer at the written\nrequest of or with the written consent of that practitioner or reviewer.”  42 C.F.R. §\n480.133(a)(2)(iii).\nTaken together, these regulations do not permit the disclosure ordered by the\ndistrict court.  They indicate clearly that: (1) nearly all peer review organization\ninformation is confidential; (2) confidential information related to deliberations must\nnot be disclosed, except in circumstances not presented here; and (3) physician\nreviewer identities may be disclosed, but only with the reviewer’s written consent.\nThus, it seems clear under the regulations that the information plaintiffs seek–the\nidentities of physician reviewers in specific cases–is not subject to discovery.  \nThe plaintiffs have not argued, nor do we see any reason why, these regulations\nare not entitled to deference.  See Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).  The district court cited Public Citizen, Inc. v. United\nStates Department of Health & Human Services, 332 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 2003), in\nsupport of the view that we need not follow the agency’s confidentiality regulations.\nThere, the court refused to grant Chevron deference to the confidentiality regulations\nfor a section of the Medicaid Act that was enacted after the regulations were\npromulgated.  Pub. Citizen, 332 F.3d at 659. \n \nWe agree with the proposition that where regulations precede enactment of the\nstatute, they cannot possibly be read as interpreting the statute.  That is not the\nsituation before us, however.  Since § 42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9’s most recent amendment,\nHHS has reconsidered and amended the confidentiality provisions of its regulations,\nsuch that information could now be disclosed with the written consent of a medical\npractitioner or peer reviewer.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 48916, 49266-67 (Aug. 11, 2004)\n(amending  42  C.F.R.  §§  480.133,  480.140).    Thus,  unlike  Public  Citizen,  the\n-7-\n\nconfidentiality regulations at  issue here have been significantly and materially\nchanged subsequent to the statute’s amendment.  \nAccording the regulations the deference required by Chevron, we find the\ninterpretation to be “based on a permissible construction of the statute.”  Chevron,\n467 U.S. at 843.  The statute governing disclosure specifically charges HHS with the\nduty to ensure peer review information is kept confidential through regulations aimed\ntoward protecting “the rights and interests of patients, health care practitioners, [and]\nproviders of health care.” 42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9(a)(2).  The regulations effectuate that\npurpose, as they allow disclosure of the identities of peer reviewers only after\nobtaining written consent of the peer reviewer.  42 C.F.R. § 480.133(a)(2)(iii).  While\nthe plaintiffs may disagree with HHS’s regulation, it is permissible and thus must\nstand. \nCONCLUSION\nThe district court’s order compelling disclosure of the identities of peer\nreviewers conflicts with the applicable enforceable regulations.  For this reason, we\nhave no alternative but to reverse.\n______________________________\n-8-",

In its first appeal, the Arkansas Department of\nHuman Services (ADHS) challenged a district court injunction that forced it to keep\nits Child Health Management Services (CHMS) program as part of its state Medicaid\nplan.  We held that, pursuant to the Medicaid Act, children had an enforceable right\nto early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment (EPSDT) services.  Pediatric\nSpecialty Care, Inc. v. Ark. Dep’t of Human Servs., 293 F.3d 472, 478-79 (8th Cir.\n-2-\n\n2002) (hereinafter Pediatric I).  We reversed the injunction, however, to the extent\nthat it required ADHS to continue the CHMS program as part of its state plan.  Id. at\n480.  So long as the state continued to pay for CHMS-type services when prescribed\nby a doctor, we reasoned, the state fulfilled its obligations under the Medicaid Act.\nId. at 480-81.  We then remanded for further proceedings.\nOn  remand,  the  district  court  considered  the  plaintiffs’  procedural  and\nsubstantive due process claims.  The district court held that ADHS violated the\nprocedural due process rights of the plaintiffs by attempting to change the CHMS\nprogram without first conducting a study about the effect such a change would have\non the efficiency, economy, quality of care, and access to care, as required by 42\nU.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A).  It further held that ADHS had engaged in “conscience\nshocking” behavior by trying to reduce medical services to needy children based on\npolitical and fiscal motivations.  On appeal, we affirmed the district court’s ruling on\nthe plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim.  Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc. v. Ark.\nDep’t of Human Servs., 364 F.3d 925, 929-31 (8th Cir. 2004) (hereinafter Pediatric\nII).  As to the substantive due process claim, however, we held that ADHS’s attempt\nto move CHMS services “off-plan” for cost savings was not conscience shocking, and\nthus reversed the district court’s contrary holding.  Id. at 932.  We again remanded\nfor further proceedings.\nOn remand, the district court considered, among other things, damages claims\nagainst Kurt Knickrehm, Ray Hanley, and Roy Jeffus, all current or past high-level\nsupervisors  of  ADHS.1    Knickrehm,  Hanley,  and  Jeffus  moved  for  summary\njudgment, asserting they were entitled to qualified immunity.  ADHS contended that\nit was entitled to absolute immunity under the Eleventh Amendment because it was\n1Knickrehm has been director of ADHS since January of 1999; Hanley was\ndirector of the Division of Medical Services of ADHS from 1994 through January 6,\n2003; Jeffus has been director of the Division of Medical Services from January 6,\n2003 to the present.\n-3-\n\nan agency of the state of Arkansas.  The district court granted the motion as to\nKnickrehm, but denied it as to Hanley and Jeffus.  Although its order expressly\ndisposed of all of the defendants’ other summary judgment claims, it was silent\nregarding ADHS’s Eleventh Amendment argument.\nOn appeal, Hanley and Jeffus contend that the district court erred in denying\ntheir claim for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.  ADHS argues that\nthe district court erred in failing to grant it summary judgment based on Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.  We find no error in the district court’s conclusion that Hanley\nand Jeffus are not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.  On ADHS’s Eleventh\nAmendment claim, we agree that it must be dismissed from the suit as an agency of\nthe state.  Our review of the record, however, indicates that the plaintiffs have sought\nprospective injunctive relief from ADHS by suing its directors, and ADHS has\nadmitted  that  its  officials  can  be  sued  for  the  purpose  of  seeking  prospective\ninjunctions.  Thus, we affirm in part, but direct the district court on remand to dismiss\nADHS from the suit.\nBACKGROUND\nMuch of the background of this dispute has been recounted in our prior\nopinions of Pediatric I and Pediatric II, and will not be fully restated here.  The\nplaintiffs include medical clinics that provide EPSDT services to special needs\nchildren in Arkansas and recipients of those services.  The services are provided for\nthe purpose of increasing the functional levels of developmentally impaired children.\nThese services have been offered in Arkansas through the CHMS model, which\n“extends diagnostic and evaluative services, pediatric day treatment, and various\ntherapies to children from six months to six years of age.”  Pediatric II, 364 F.3d at\n928.\n-4-\n\nOver the past several years, ADHS has tried to curtail its payments for CHMS\nservices.  In November of 2001, ADHS issued a press release stating that it would\nrestructure the CHMS program, terminating day treatment and therapeutic programs,\nresulting in a savings of several million dollars.  As relevant to this appeal, the\nplaintiffs have alleged2 that Hanley, Jeffus, and the ADHS employed a system\nrequiring prior authorization for CHMS services solely for budget-related reasons\nwithout consideration of the medical necessity of the services.\nThe prior authorization regime was operated by Arkansas Foundation for\nMedical Care (AFMC), an independent organization that contracted to provide this\nservice  to  ADHS.    Beginning  in  July  of  2001,3  AFMC  was  presented  with\napplications for CHMS services, and was tasked with determining whether the\nrequested services were medically necessary based on a review of the child’s medical\nrecords.  First, a nurse reviewer received a CHMS provider’s request for prior\nauthorization.  If the nurse reviewer did not approve the plan, it was sent to a\nphysician reviewer.  If the physician reviewer denied the services, the provider could\nask for reconsideration, and the plan would be reviewed by a second physician.\nNurse reviewers may not override a doctor’s decision to recommend services.\nAt some point while Hanley was director, he changed the prior authorization\nprocess so that the AFMC would review not only whether the service requested was\nof a medically necessary type, but also inquire as to the medically necessary amount\nof the service.  This essentially led to a wholesale reduction in CHMS services from\nsix hours per day, per child to no more than three and one-half to four hours per day,\nper child.\n2These allegations were made through an amended complaint that was filed\nafter the appeal in Pediatrics II was already pending.\n3ADHS entered into two contracts with AFMC, one extending from July 1,\n2001 through June 30, 2003, and another from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2005.\n-5-\n\nThe plaintiffs presented evidence from their expert, Dr. Sharon Ramey.  Dr.\nRamey testified that six hours per day of services is most effective for needy children.\nThe district court believed that Dr. Ramey’s testimony, taken in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, raised an inference that the prior authorization procedure’s\nreduction in CHMS services was based on considerations other than the medical\nnecessity of the children.\nDr. John Whitaker was a doctor reviewer who worked for AFMC.  He testified\nthat AFMC used guidelines that only permitted nurses to approve up to three and one-\nhalf hours of CHMS services for children.  He stated that he would not generally\napprove six hours of CHMS services for a child because, in his view, a child could\nnot be expected to get beneficial results for more than four hours per day of a CHMS\nprogram.  He further testified that, at the request of nurse supervisor Amy Carson, he\nhad developed what he termed “rote denials” or “canned denials,” which were pre-\nscripted denial letters4 that nurses were supposed to use for certain types of claims\nthat were easily disposed of.\nAccording to Dr. Whitaker, it came to his attention in December of 2003 that\none of AFMC’s nurse reviewers, Tilerra Coats, was reducing CHMS services far\ngreater than she should have been, and misusing his denial codes.  Whitaker began\nto institute quality control on Coats’s work, randomly checking the entire file in\nwhich she would recommend reduced services.  On each occasion, Dr. Whitaker\nsubsequently approved the child for more care than Coats had.  In some instances,\ndespite Dr. Whitaker’s direction, the ultimate decision was not changed, and the child\nwould receive less care than Dr. Whitaker had authorized.  Dr. Whitaker also\ndiscovered that Coats was often altering his approvals to provide less service to the\n4Dr. Whitaker clarified in his deposition that although they termed these denial\nletters, they were actually partial approvals of services, but in an amount or to a\ndegree less than requested.\n-6-\n\nchildren.  Dr. Whitaker brought this problem to the attention of Carson, Coats’s\nsupervisor, but nothing was done to correct matters.  In fact, when Dr. Whitaker\naudited some of his past charts, he noticed that Carson had actually signed off on\ncharts that Coats had altered.  On further inquiry, Carson had written on a number of\nthese files what she believed was the rationale for the files not accurately reflecting\nthe services approved by Dr. Whitaker.  Most often her explanation was merely her\nown  opinion  stating  that  she  did  not  believe  the  services  were  necessary,  or\nsupporting Coats’s opinion to that effect.  Neither Coats, Carson, nor any other nurse,\nhowever, is permitted to change a physician’s recommendations for CHMS services.\nDr. Whitaker also discovered that some of his charts had been altered in a manner that\nmade the children under review appear not to qualify for either the extent or degree\nof services he approved.  When Dr. Whitaker sought an explanation for this, written\nnotes on at least one of his charts indicated that his authorized service was not given\nbecause “the directive I5 received from [ADHS] was to only approve 1 unit of 992116\nper day.”  (Whitaker Dep. at 77.)\nDr. Whitaker was also informed that Coats was re-reviewing other nurses’\nwork, and would often change the recommendations to approve fewer services for the\nchildren.  In these instances, Coats would typically erase the prior nurse’s review so\nthat it looked like hers was the only review.  Dr. Whitaker was not aware of any\ninstance in which a nurse reviewer, either intentionally or mistakenly, increased the\namount of services approved over what a physician had recommended.  Dr. Whitaker\neventually reported this wrongdoing to Dr. Susan Keathley, who brought it to the\nattention of Dr. Moody, the medical director for AFMC.\n5It is unclear from the deposition if the “I” in this sentence is Coats or Carson.\n699211 is a procedure code used for CHMS services.  It refers to an office visit\nof an established patient for some reason.  One unit is five minutes.  In this instance,\nDr. Whitaker had approved 40 units per month for a child’s catheterization needs, but\nthat had been reduced by a nurse to 20 units per month.\n-7-\n\nBrenda Gassaway is a registered nurse who was formerly employed as a nurse\nreviewer by AFMC.  She began working for AFMC on April 10, 2000, and was fired\non July 19, 2004.  Gassaway stated that she knew about the problem of Coats\nchanging doctors’ files as early as January of 2002.  Gassaway had been passing on\nthis information to her supervisor, Carson, for a year and a half.  Carson told\nGassaway that they would have to handle matters carefully because Coats and Kenya\nHarbin, director of the review department, were close friends.\nIn early July of 2004, Gassaway was called into a meeting with Harbin and\nSusie  Moore,  the  director  of  human  resources.    The  meeting  concerned  Dr.\nWhitaker’s claims of nurse wrongdoing.  According to Gassaway, Dr. Moody sent the\nmatter back to Harbin for investigation, and she then interviewed each of the nurse\nreviewers  to  determine  who  had  helped  Whitaker  discover  the  altered  files.\nGassaway denied involvement, but told Harbin that she knew Coats was altering\ndoctors’ decisions.  Harbin responded that they had reviewed the matter and found\nthose allegations unsubstantiated.  At that point, Gassaway concluded that the sole\npurpose of the meeting was to determine if Dr. Whitaker had acted inappropriately\nin auditing Coats’s work and if anyone had helped him.  Eventually, Harbin accused\nGassaway of copying charts for Dr. Whitaker, which Gassaway continued to deny.\nAs  the  meeting  concluded,  Gassaway  again  told  Harbin  to  correct  AFMC’s\nwrongdoings.  Harbin’s response was to tell Gassaway not to discuss the meeting\nwith anyone else.7  Gassaway was fired a week later for insubordination and failure\nto follow the chain of command. \n7Similarly, Brenda Gassaway testified in her deposition that she told Michael\nRainwater, attorney for AFMC, about AFMC’s canned-denial procedure, and he\ninstructed her “don’t bring it up” at her deposition.  (Gassaway Dep. at 18.)  Breck\nHopkins, attorney for ADHS, was also present.\n-8-\n\nWhen  asked  at  his  deposition  about  how  AFMC  interacts  with  CHMS\nproviders, Dr. Moody stated that AFMC regularly puts out memos to assist CHMS\nproviders in knowing what kind of documentation is required.  Gassaway disagreed:\nNo,  that  was  not  the  truth.    The  truth  is  no  matter  what  [CHMS\nproviders] ask for you don’t give it to them ever until they beg for it, and\nthen you show up with someone who doesn’t know so that you can say,\n“The person you need is not here.”  That’s the truth.\n(Gassaway Dep. at 22.)\nGassaway believed that Coats was not only changing doctors’ charts, but also\naltering other nurses’ work to reduce approved services.  When asked what might\nmotivate Coats to alter doctors’ and nurses’ files, Gassaway stated, “[b]ecause she’s\ncrazy.”  (Id. at 27.)  She elaborated that Coats had stated that she did not think that\nany child deserved any services whatsoever, and that the CHMS program was just\nexpensive daycare.  When asked again what incentive Coats had to illegally reduce\nthe services, Gassaway speculated that it was because of the cost savings attributable\nto AFMC’s reviews.  Gassaway stated that both Carson (her direct supervisor) and\nHarbin (an AFMC vice president) had stated that AFMC’s cost-savings reports,\nwhich were reports generated and published to ADHS about the amount of money\nAFMC had saved ADHS through the review process, justified ADHS renewing\nAFMC’s contract.  Gassaway termed this as the general sentiment at AFMC, which\nevery employee is aware of.  As she stated, “I worked there for four years and I saw\nthe patterns of how the programs are worked and it just seems that the goal is always\nto cut services and to make [CHMS] centers jump through hoops to get the kids\napproved so that they’ll just quit.”  (Id. at 36.)  She also testified that she received\nwritten and oral directives from Carson, which Carson had in turn received from\nShirley Wilson, a former director of ADHS, that they should generally deny certain\nrequests  for  services,  such  as  those  requested  for  children  with  only  a  single\ndisability.\n-9-\n\nBased in large part upon the deposition testimony of Gassaway and Dr.\nWhitaker, the district court determined that individual defendants Hanley and Jeffus\nwere not entitled to qualified immunity.  The court noted that the plaintiffs sought\ndamages for the violation of clearly established rights to Medicaid services.  As to\nwhether the evidence supported the inference that such a violation occurred, the court\nstated\nPlaintiffs alleged and have offered sufficient evidence that a second\nlayer  of  the  prior  authorization  process  was  implemented  by  the\nindividual capacity defendants resulting in an across-the-board reduction\nin the scope and duration of day treatment recommended by the CHMS\nproviders.  Consequently, all medicaid eligible children were allegedly\ndenied their full array of recommended treatment.  Plaintiffs contend\nthat  this  reduction  has  violated  the  equal  access  provision  of  the\nMedicaid Act as well as entitlement to day treatment in accordance with\n[42 U.S.C.] § 1396d(a)(13).  There is sufficient evidence in the record\n[to] raise a reasonable inference that the conduct of Defendants reduced\nthe quality of care available to low income children as compared to other\nchildren  in  the  general  population.    Moreover,  there  is  sufficient\nevidence that costs for the additional hours of care may be borne by the\nCHMS  providers  to  such  an  extent  that  it  jeopardizes  the  future\navailability of their services.  Finally, according to Ms. Gassaway,\nelimination  of  such  services  is  the  goal  of  the  prior  authorization\npractices  engaged  in  by  AFMC  with  the  encouragement  and  tacit\napproval of Defendants.\n(Dist. Ct. Order of Feb. 7, 2005 at 34-35.)\nThe court did not specifically rule on the issue of whether ADHS, as an\nagency of the state, was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of Eleventh\nAmendment immunity.  This interlocutory appeal by Hanley, Jeffus, and ADHS\nfollowed.\n-10-\n\nANALYSIS\nI. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY OF HANLEY AND JEFFUS.\n“Ordinarily, a party cannot appeal from a denial of summary judgment.”  Pool\nv. Sebastian County, Arkansas, 418 F.3d 934, 937 (8th Cir. 2005).  There is an\nexception to this rule for government officials whose motion for summary judgment\nbased  on  qualified  immunity  is  denied.    Id.    Under  this  exception,  we  may\nimmediately review the issue of whether the defendants engaged in conduct that\nviolated the plaintiffs’ clearly established rights.  Id.; see also Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982)  (holding  that  “government  officials  performing\ndiscretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar\nas their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known”).  \nWe  must  first  consider  whether  the  Medicaid  Act  confers  any  federally\nenforceable rights upon the plaintiffs.  This question has been largely answered by\nour prior opinions in this case.  The claims for damages made by the plaintiffs here\nrelate only to two subsections of the Medicaid Act:  42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) (Count\nFour of the Complaint), and 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A) (Count Three of the\nComplaint).  In Pediatrics I and Pediatrics II, respectively, we specifically held that\neach of these subsections created enforceable federal rights.  Pediatrics I, 293 F.3d\nat 480-81 (holding that § 1396d(a)(13) created enforceable rights for recipient\nbeneficiaries, which CHMS providers could assert on behalf of the beneficiaries);\nPediatrics  II,  364  F.3d  at  930  (“Over  ten  years  ago,  our  court  held  that  §\n1396a(a)(30)(A) created enforceable rights for Medicaid recipients and providers.\nWe find it entirely appropriate for the Plaintiffs to base their procedural due process\nclaim on their clearly established rights to have equal access to quality medical care\nas defined by § 1396a(a)(30)(A).”  (Citation omitted)).  Thus, the argument that there\n-11-\n\nis no federally enforceable rights here is at odds with both the law of the case doctrine\nand the principle of stare decisis.8\n“The law of the case doctrine prevents the relitigation of a settled issue in a\ncase and requires courts to adhere to decisions made in earlier proceedings,” except\nwhere the result would be manifestly unjust.  Kan. Pub. Employees Ret. Sys. v.\nBlackwell, Sanders, Matheny, Weary & Lombardi, L.C., 114 F.3d 679, 687 (8th Cir.\n1997).  Stated another way, when our court considers a case on appeal, every issue\ndisposed of on appeal has thus been finally decided.  Klein v. Arkoma Prod. Co., 73\nF.3d 779, 784 (8th Cir. 1996).  The doctrine is intended to “‘insure uniformity of\ndecisions, protect the expectations of the parties and promote judicial economy.’” In\nre Just Brakes Corp. Sys., Inc., 293 F.3d 1069, 1072 (8th Cir. 2002) (quoting Klein,\n73 F.3d at 784).  The doctrine does not apply, however, where an intervening decision\nof a higher tribunal clearly demonstrates that the prior decision is wrong.  Madison\nv. IBP, Inc., 330 F.3d 1051, 1059 (8th Cir. 2003).\n42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) entitles Medicaid eligible children to\ndiagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services, including\nany medical or remedial services (provided in a facility, a home, or other\nsetting) recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner of\nthe healing arts within the scope of their practice under State law, for the\nmaximum reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of\nan individual to the best possible functional level.  \n8Under the doctrine of stare decisis, one panel may not overrule an earlier\ndecision of the court.  United States v. Mosby, 101 F.3d 1278, 1279 n.3 (8th Cir.\n1996).  Because the analysis of the stare decisis issue on this matter is rendered\nunnecessary by operation of the law of the case doctrine, we have not separately\naddressed it.  See id.\n-12-\n\nIn Pediatrics I, we affirmed the district court’s holding that this subsection of\nthe Medicaid Act created an enforceable federal right to early intervention day\ntreatment when recommended by a physician.  Pediatrics I, 293 F.3d at 477-78.  No\npetition for rehearing was filed by the ADHS.  Cf. Klein, 73 F.3d at 784 n.7\n(“Generally, parties must bring any perceived errors in a panel opinion to the court’s\nattention through a petition for rehearing.”)\nSimilarly, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), commonly referred to as the “equal\naccess provision” of the Medicaid Act, requires state Medicaid plans to employ\nmethods and procedures related to use and payment of care and services as necessary\nto ensure that the state’s payments are “consistent with efficiency, economy, and\nquality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services\nare available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are\navailable to the general population in the geographic area.”  Relying in part on our\nearlier opinion in Arkansas Medical Society, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (8th Cir.\n1993), we held that this part of the Medicaid Act created a clearly established federal\nright to equal access to quality medical care.  Pediatrics II, 364 F.3d at 930.  ADHS\npetitioned for rehearing en banc from this decision, but nowhere in the petition did\nADHS suggest that it was error to find that the equal access provision created an\nenforceable federal right.\nGiven our clear prior panel holdings, the question of whether §§ 1396d(a)(13)\nand 1396a(a)(30)(a) confer enforceable federal rights upon the plaintiffs appears\nsettled in the affirmative.  Although ADHS suggests that Pediatrics I did not finally\nanswer whether CHMS providers had an enforceable right under § 1396d(a)(13), we\nexplicitly stated that the providers have “standing to assert the rights of their CHMS\npatients.”  293 F.3d at 478.  Thus, there is little merit to that argument.\nADHS invites us to overturn our prior decisions based on the view that they are\ninconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536\n-13-\n\nU.S. 273 (2002).  According to ADHS, Gonzaga clarified that an enforceable right\nis only created where the statute explicitly states as much, and is only enforceable by\nthe person or entity that the statute states is the beneficiary.\nAt the outset, we note that Gonzaga was issued on June 20, 2002.  Our decision\nin Pediatrics I was filed ten days earlier, but the mandate did not issue until July 1,\n2002, with no petition for rehearing before that time.  See Fed. R. App. P. 40(a)\n(granting a party fourteen days from the entry of judgment to file a petition for\nrehearing).  Likewise, our decision in Pediatrics II was not issued until April 16,\n2004.  Thus, Gonzaga is not an intervening decision of a superior tribunal, as is\nrequired before we may overturn matters previously settled as the law of the case.\nMadison, 330 F.3d at 1059.\nPerhaps more importantly, we do not read Gonzaga to require a different result\nthan we reached in our earlier decisions.  In Gonzaga, the question presented was\nwhether a student could bring a damages claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for a\nUniversity’s violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974\n(FERPA).  536 U.S. at 276.  FERPA was enacted pursuant to Congress’s spending\npower, and directed the Secretary of Education to withhold funds from institutions\nthat released students’ private information without their consent.  Id. at 278.  A\nstudent at Gonzaga’s school of education sued the school under FERPA when he\nfound out that the school’s teacher certification specialist disclosed allegations of\nsexual  misconduct  to  Washington’s  teacher  certification  agency  without  his\npermission.  Id. at 277.\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist first recognized that there was\nsome circuit and district court discord and confusion about what type of statutory\nrights were enforceable by a § 1983 damages action.  Id. at 278.  The Court noted that\nthe starting point must be an inquiry into whether Congress intended to create a\nfederal right.  Id.  To determine this, one must consider the benefit conferred by the\n-14-\n\nstatute, the intended beneficiary, and whether the statute provides for some type of\nenforcement action short of a private cause of action.  Id. at 285-90.  The Court stated\nthat the creation of such rights must be done “in clear and unambiguous terms.”  Id.\nat 290.  The Court ultimately held that FERPA provisions failed to create privately\nenforceable rights, since it had no explicit “rights-creating language,” spoke in terms\nof aggregate as opposed to individual privacy protections, and directed the Secretary\nof Education to enforce it.  Id.\nADHS would have us read Gonzaga in a manner that forecloses private causes\nof action based on the Medicaid Act.  However, an earlier case, Wilder v. Virginia\nHospital Association, 496 U.S. 498 (1990), has already considered whether (now-\nrepealed) provisions of the Medicaid Act, which required the state to reimburse\nhospitals for costs of certain services, conferred a § 1983 right of action on behalf of\nhealth care providers.  The Court first held that “[t]here can be little doubt that health\ncare providers are the intended beneficiaries” of the provision, since it was about\npayment of services provided by them.  Id. at 510.  The Court then concluded that the\nmandatory language of the provision–requiring some level of payment for the health\ncare providers’ services even though the ultimate amount was left mostly to the\nstate’s discretion–created an enforceable right to payment under § 1983.  Id. at 512-\n13.  Although Gonzaga takes a more restrictive view of rights-creating statutes, it did\nnot overrule Wilder.  Thus, the proposition that the Medicaid Act may create\nenforceable rights, even for health care providers, is far from novel.\nSecondly, the plaintiffs still prevail within the terms of the Gonzaga analytical\nframework.  As to § 1396d(a)(13), the statute calls for state payment of part or all of\nthe costs of diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services when\nrecommended  by  a  doctor  “for  the  maximum  reduction  of  physical  or  mental\ndisability and restoration of an individual to the best possible functional level.”  The\nintended beneficiaries of this subsection are, obviously, the needy child, and by\ncorollary, those who incur costs in providing those services.  Moreover, this portion\n-15-\n\nof the statute does not speak in terms of amorphous concepts; it requires therapeutic\nservices for “an individual.”  Id.  We acknowledge that the federal government is\ncharged with responsibility for supervising a state’s participation in the Medicaid\nprogram, a factor that Gonzaga holds indicative of no private right being created.\nThis, however, cannot overcome the fact that the statute itself indicates positively\nboth the scope of the provision and who is the intended beneficiary.  Thus, a private\ncause of action lies for enforcement of § 1396d(a)(13).\nSimilarly, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A), is intended to benefit both CHMS\nrecipients and providers, and creates enforceable rights for both groups.  That\nsubsection requires states to provide methods and procedures for payment of care and\nservices in a manner that ensures equal access to quality care for needy children.  Id.\nThe beneficiaries are both the recipients of the services and the recipients of the\nstate’s payment, who are the CHMS providers.  The statute is clear on its scope:  to\nensure payments are not too high, but yet high enough to secure the participation of\nenough clinics so that needy children receive equal access to quality health care.  \nIn sum, as our prior cases have held, the rights conferred by §§ 1396d(a)(13)\nand 1396a(a)(30)(A) are clearly established federal rights.  Moreover, even accepting\nADHS’s invitation to reconsider prior established precedent, we find no error in the\ndistrict court’s holding that these provisions of the Medicaid Act are enforceable by\nboth CHMS recipients and providers through a § 1983 private cause of action.\nWe  must  now  consider  whether  the  evidence,  viewed  in  the  light  most\nfavorable to the plaintiffs, Plemmons v. Roberts, 439 F.3d 818, 822 (8th Cir. 2006),\nsupports the view that Hanley and Jeffus violated the plaintiffs’ Medicaid Act rights.\nThe district court found that, taking all evidence and inferences in the plaintiffs’\nfavor, they could show that Jeffus and Hanley manipulated the prior authorization\nsystem in a way that denied children essential medical services solely because they\n-16-\n\nwanted to cut costs.  After carefully reviewing the record, we agree with the district\ncourt.\nThe evidence presented to the district court is recounted fully above, and will\nbe merely summarized here.  There is certainly evidence that documented AFMC’s\nwrongdoing:  Dr. Whitaker testified about how his approvals had been altered by a\nnurse, and Brenda Gassaway, a nurse, testified consistently with that.  When brought\nto the attention of supervisors, nothing was done to correct this misconduct.  To the\ncontrary, Gassaway herself was fired.  \nThe more difficult question is whether ADHS’s directors can be tied to this\nwrongdoing.    Although  disputed  and  certainly  not  proven,  the  inference  of\nwrongdoing is supported by the plaintiffs’ evidence.  Deposition testimony indicated\nthat AFMC’s primary concern was to save ADHS money, and Gassaway stated that\nher superiors told her that this was the reason they were able to maintain the contract\nwith ADHS.  In other words, AFMC won and kept the contract as ADHS’s prior\nauthorization agent because it would deny or reduce a significant number of claims\nwhen compared to the services paid prior to AFMC’s arrival.  There was also\ntestimony that ADHS worked overtly to ensure that claims were denied by sending\ndirectives to AFMC about the extent of services that AFMC could approve.  As\nrecognized by the district court, Hanley and Jeffus “implemented a policy [of prior\nauthorization] that reduced the scope and duration of day treatment for beneficiaries\nof the Medicaid Act.”  (Dist. Ct. Order of Feb. 7, 2005 at 38.)  Taking the evidence\nin the plaintiffs’ favor, one could infer that their primary motivation was to save\nmoney, although the statutes require them to act in the best interest of the needy\nchildren.    That  is  a  violation  of  the  rights  clearly  established  under  the  §§\n1396d(a)(13) and 396a(a)(30)(A) and our prior caselaw, and thus neither defendant\nis entitled to summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity.  The district court\nproperly so held. \n-17-\n\nII. STATE IMMUNITY FROM SUIT\nADHS argues that it must be dismissed from this suit because it is an agency\nof the state, and thus enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity from suits by private\nindividuals.9  The Eleventh Amendment protects states and state agencies from suit\nby private citizens.  Doe v. Nebraska, 345 F.3d 593, 597 (8th Cir. 2003).  According\nto the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), however, state officials may\nstill  be  sued  for  prospective  injunctive  relief  without  violating  the  Eleventh\nAmendment.  Heartland Acad. Cmty. Church v. Waddle, 427 F.3d 525, 530 (8th Cir.\n2005).\nIn this case, ADHS has asserted Eleventh Amendment immunity as a branch\nof the state.  ADHS therefore claims that the district court erred in allowing damages\nclaims to go forward against it.  The plaintiffs responded by stating that they were not\nsuing ADHS for damages, only for prospective injunctive relief.  ADHS argues that\nit is nonetheless entitled to immunity because only state officials, as opposed to state\nagencies, can be sued for prospective injunctive relief.  While that is true, Allen, 5\nF.3d  at  1153  (affirming  dismissal  of  a  state  agency  on  Eleventh  Amendment\ngrounds), the plaintiffs sued not only ADHS, but also Knickrehm and Jeffus in their\nofficial capacities as director of ADHS and director of the Division of Medical\nServices for ADHS, respectively.  To the extent the plaintiffs’ claims are against\nADHS, they must be dismissed, but claims against the directors in their official\ncapacity are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  \n9The district court’s order contains no ruling on this issue, raising a question\nof whether it is properly presented to us.  That said, we review Eleventh Amendment\nissues de novo, Allen v. Purkett, 5 F.3d 1151, 1153 (8th Cir. 1993) (per curiam), and\nneither party has raised a factual dispute related to this issue.  Particularly given the\nlengthy history of this case, which has yet to be tried on its merits, we see no use in\nreturning this matter to the district court for a decision that we would again review\nwith no deference.\n-18-\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe current and former directors of the Arkansas Department of Human\nServices appeal the denial of qualified immunity on the plaintiffs’ claims relating to\ntheir clearly established rights under the Medicaid Act.  Because the evidence\nsupports an inference that they violated the plaintiffs’ clearly established rights to\nprovide and receive medically necessary health care, we affirm the denial of summary\njudgment on that basis.  \nWe agree that claims against ADHS, as an agency, must be dismissed on\nEleventh Amendment grounds.  Because the plaintiffs have also asserted claims\nseeking prospective injunctive relief against state officials, such claims are not barred\nby the Eleventh Amendment.  Accordingly, we affirm in part, and remand with\ndirections to dismiss ADHS from the suit.\n______________________________\n-19-",

It\nis designed to serve children who “have or are at increased risk for chronic physical,\ndevelopmental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and who require health and\nrelated services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally.”1\n1Children are eligible for the program if they have a medical diagnosis such as\nAIDS, cystic fibrosis, child maltreatment syndrome (victim of abuse and neglect),\nDown syndrome, lead poisoning, congenital heart disease, cerebral degeneration, or\nmacroephaly.   See Arkansas Medicaid Manual at II-20.  Children may also be\neligible if they have a developmental diagnosis such as autism, blindness or visual\nimpairment, cerebral palsy, cognitive disorders, deafness or hearing impairment,\n-2-\n\nArkansas Medicaid Manual at II-19.  The services are provided under the State Plan\nas part of the early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment [“EPSDT”]\nmandate in Title XIX of the Social Security Act [“Medicaid Act”], codified at 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(10), 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(a) and 1396d(r) (1994).\nCHMS services may be divided into three categories: (1) diagnostic and\nevaluation  services;  (2)  pediatric  day  treatment;  and  (3)  therapies  and  other\ntreatments.  After a referral by a physician, CHMS clinic staff, including nurses,\nsocial  workers,  therapists,  and  psychologists,  perform  a  diagnostic  evaluation\nconsisting of audiology, medical, behavioral, speech, language, and psychological\nassessments.  Using the results of these evaluations, a CHMS physician prepares an\nindividual treatment plan and prescribes services and treatments for the child. These\ntherapies and treatments are provided at the CHMS clinics and include: nutrition\nservices,  behavior  therapies,  occupational  and  physical  therapies,  speech  and\nlanguage pathology services, psychological  therapies, and early intervention day\ntreatment.  The model, in its current state, facilitates EPSDT by providing the\nevaluation and therapies in multi-disciplinary clinical settings that allow children to\nreceive all their therapies in one location.  Furthermore, the model provides an early\nintervention day treatment program to reinforce the skills children learn in individual\ntherapies.2   There are approximately thirty-nine CHMS clinics in the state, serving\ndevelopmental delay, motor skills disorder, learning disabilities or mental retardation.\nSee id. at II-21. CHMS care is required for children who are diagnosed with three or\nmore medical, developmental, behavioral or environmental conditions/traumas.  Id.\nat II-22.\n2 The early intervention day treatment program is a type of day care program\nrun by early childhood specialists and overseen by medical staff.  The curriculum is\nstructured to ameliorate conditions discovered by the EPSDT evaluations and to\nstrengthen  the  skills  children  learn  in  therapy.    The  teachers  work  closely  in\nconjunction with the therapists, and medical personnel are on hand for emergency\nsituations.  Early intervention day treatment serves children who are not able to\n-3-\n\nthirty of Arkansas’s seventy-five counties.  On any given day, approximately 1500\nArkansas children are eligible to receive CHMS services.  \nDue  to  a  budget  shortfall,  Arkansas  decided  to  reduce  its  Medicaid\nexpenditures by $12 million.  In November  2001, ADHS issued a press release that\noutlined suggested changes to the State Plan and announced its intention to cut some\nof the services available under the CHMS program.  With regard to EPSDT services,\nthe press release stated:\nThe department will amend the Medicaid State Plan to redefine the\n[CHMS]. This will change how treatment services are delivered to\nchildren who don't have a serious medical problem, but are considered\nat risk. The department will continue to pay for diagnostic services, but\nwill no longer pay for CHMS daycare and therapy services. Programs\nsuch as Head Start and Arkansas Better Chance are already providing\nday care services, and will continue to provide this service, in a more\ncost efficient manner than is available at CHMS. Therapies that have\nbeen provided by CHMS are available from private providers . . . . It is\nestimated this action will save the Medicaid program between $4.9\nmillion and $5.7 million annually. Arkansas is the only state that has\nbeen covering CHMS through the Medicaid program.\nAppellant’s App. at 371.3  As we understand the state’s proposal, it would leave the\ndiagnostic and  evaluation leg of CHMS intact, meaning that a physician would still\nrefer a child to a CHMS clinic for an evaluation, the staff at the CHMS clinic would\nperform the evaluation, and a CHMS physician would recommend the needed\ntherapies.  However, the therapies and the early intervention day treatment services\nfunction or learn in a normal day care setting such as Head Start.\n3Ray Hanley, the director of the Division of Medical Services at ADHS,\ntestified that the Department planned to cut day treatment services.  Trial Tr. Vol. 2\nat 198.  \n-4-\n\nwould no longer be part of the CHMS program; thus, they would no longer be listed\nspecifically in the State Plan.4 \n  Shortly after the state announced these cutbacks, Pediatric Specialty Care, Inc.,\na  provider  of  CHMS  services,  along  with  other  CHMS  providers  (“provider\nplaintiffs”)  and  the  parents  of  three  recipients  of  CHMS  services  (“recipient\nplaintiffs”) filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking temporary and permanent\ninjunctive relief on the basis that the ADHS’s proposed cutbacks would violate their\nfederal right to EPSDT services.  \nAfter a full hearing, the district court agreed with the plaintiffs and found that\nthe Medicaid Act gives them an enforceable right to early intervention day treatment\nservices.  In its findings of fact, the court noted that the only early intervention day\ntreatment services provided to children under the current State Plan are those provided\nto children enrolled in CHMS.  The court also found that even though therapy services\nwould be provided by other sources if the budget cuts took place, therapy services “not\nprovided in conjunction with CHMS day treatment services will not result in the\nmaximum reduction of their developmental disabilities or restoration of their best\npossible functional level, as mandated by [§] 1396d(a)(13).”  Pediatric Specialty Care,\nInc., etc. v. Arkansas Dep’t of Human Servs., No: 4:01CV00830WRW, slip op. at 10\n(E.D. Ark Dec. 18, 2001).  In its conclusions of law, the district court held that CHMS\nday treatment is a rehabilitative service, with both medical and remedial components\nunder § 1396d(a)(13).  The court further stated that the day treatment provided through\nCHMS is “treatment for the maximum reduction of disability and for a restoration of\n[a developmentally delayed child] to the best possible functional level.”  Id. at 14\n4The press release indicates that CHMS clinics would no longer be reimbursed\nfor providing therapies or early intervention day treatment.  ADHS clarified at oral\nargument, however, that CHMS therapists could enroll as Medicaid therapists under\nthe new state plan.  Therefore, the decision not to reimburse CHMS early intervention\nday treatment services has the biggest practical impact of the proposed changes.\n-5-\n\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13)).   The court ultimately held that categorically\nneedy children who request medical assistance under § 1396d(a)(13), and for whom\na physician recommends early intervention day treatment, have a federal right to the\ntreatment.  The court then granted a permanent injunction enjoining the CHMS\ncutbacks, reasoning that because early intervention day treatment is not provided for\nelsewhere in the State Plan, the ADHS may not cut its funding of CHMS day\ntreatment.  ADHS appeals.\nII.  Discussion\nWe consider three issues on appeal:  (1) whether the district court erred in\ndetermining that the appellees may bring a § 1983 cause of action; (2) whether the\ndistrict court’s factual findings regarding day treatment services are clearly erroneous;\nand (3) whether the district court erred in determining that the Medicaid Act creates\nan enforceable right to CHMS day treatment services.\nFirst, ADHS argues that the Medicaid Act does not create a federal right that\nappellees may enforce through a § 1983 action.  Section 1983 provides a federal cause\nof action against anyone who, acting pursuant to state authority, violates any “rights\nprivileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United States.\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.  A remedy is available under § 1983 for violations of federal\nstatutory and constitutional law.  Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980).  In order\nto bring a § 1983 claim, however, a plaintiff must assert a violation of a federal right,\nnot just a violation of a federal law.  Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340 (1997)\n(citation omitted).  To determine whether the statute in question gives rise to a federal\nright, we consider three factors: (1) whether the provision in question was “intend[ed]\nto benefit” the putative plaintiff; (2) whether the interest the plaintiff asserts is not so\n“vague and amorphous” that it is beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce;\nand  (3)  whether  the  provision  in  question  creates  a  binding  obligation  on  the\ngovernmental unit.  Id. (citations omitted).  \n-6-\n\nThe district court found that the plaintiffs met these requisites and properly\nasserted a federal right enforceable in a § 1983 action.  ADHS now challenges the\ncourt’s holding that the provider plaintiffs are intended beneficiaries of the EPSDT\nprovisions.  ADHS concedes, however, that the recipient beneficiaries are intended\nbeneficiaries of the statute.  Given this admission, even if we were to find that the\nprovider plaintiffs are not the intended beneficiaries, the recipient plaintiffs may still\nenforce the federal statute.  Furthermore, ADHS does not argue with the proposition\nthat even without individual standing, the provider plaintiffs in this case have standing\nto assert the rights of their CHMS patients.  See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106,\n115-117 (1976) (noting that “where the relationship between the litigant and the third\nparty [is] such that the former is fully, or very nearly, as effective a proponent of the\nright as the latter,” there may be an exception to the third party standing rules).\nTherefore, we find no error in the district court’s holding that the plaintiffs satisfied\nthe “intended beneficiary” prong of the § 1983 test.  \nNext we turn to the issue of whether the Medicaid Act creates a binding\nobligation on the states with regard to EPSDT services and whether that obligation is\nso  vague  and  amorphous  that  its  enforcement  is  beyond  judicial  competence.\nMedicaid  is  a  cooperative  federal-state  program  designed  to  provide  medical\nassistance and rehabilitation services to low-income individuals.  See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396.  The federal government grants funds to the states for the provision of health\ncare services, and the states act as administrators of those funds.  Id.; Smith v.\nRasmussen, 249 F.3d 755, 757 (8th Cir. 2001).  States are not required to participate\nin the Medicaid program, but if they do they must comply with the requirements of the\nMedicaid Act and its regulations.  Id. (citation omitted).  “To qualify for federal funds,\na state must submit a plan to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nwhich complies with [the] fifty-eight subsections outlined in 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a).”\nArkansas Med. Soc’y, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 522 (8th Cir. 1993).  \n-7-\n\nTo determine whether the Medicaid Act  imposes a binding obligation on the\nState of Arkansas, we must determine whether the statutory language is “couched in\nmandatory, rather than precatory, terms.”  Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340.  The language\nin § 1396a is mandatory language.  Section 1396a(a)(10)(A) states that the provision\nof EPSDT services “must” be included in the state plan.5  Section 1396a(a)(43) also\narticulates that a state plan “must” include the provision of EPSDT services.6  These\nEPSDT  services  are  defined  as:  screening  services,  which  must  include  a\ncomprehensive health and development history, a comprehensive unclothed physical\nexam, appropriate immunizations, laboratory tests, and health education;  vision\nservices; dental services; hearing services; and “such other necessary health care,\ndiagnostic services, treatment, and other measures . . . to correct or ameliorate defects\nand physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services,\nwhether or not such services are covered under the State plan.”  42 U.S.C. §1396d(r).\nWe find that this statutory language creates a binding obligation upon ADHS to create\na state plan that includes the provision of EPSDT services as they are defined in §\n1396d(r).  Furthermore, we find that this obligation is not so ambiguous or amorphous\nthat its enforcement strains judicial competence.   Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs\nhave an federal right to EPSDT services that is enforceable in a § 1983 action.\n5Section 1396a(a)(10)(A) mandates that a state plan provide medical assistance,\n“including at least the care and services listed in paragraphs (1) through (5), (17) and\n(21) of section 1396d(a).” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A).  Section 1396d(a) defines the\nterm “medical assistance,” and subpart 4(B) of that subsection includes “early and\nperiodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (as defined in subsection (r) of\nthis section).”  42 U.S.C.  § 1396d(a)(4)(B).  Because § 1396a(a)(10)(a) states that\na state plan must provide at least the medical assistance provided in § 1396d(a) (1)-\n(5), (17), (21), EPSDT services must be included in a state plan. \n6Section 1396a(a)(43) mandates that a state plan provide for screening services,\narrange corrective treatment for disorders uncovered by the screening services, and\ninform all eligible recipients of the availability of EPSDT services.  \n-8-\n\nNext we turn to the issue of whether the district court’s factual findings\nregarding ADHS’s CHMS program are clearly erroneous.  See Love v. Reed, 216 F.3d\n682, 687 (8th Cir. 2000) (noting that we review a district court’s findings of fact for\nclear error).  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when “the reviewing court on the\nentire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.”  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948).\nIn the present case, the district court found that:\n[T]he  day  treatment  services  currently  being  provided  to  children\nenrolled  in  the  CHMS  program,  in  conjunction  with  their  therapy\nservices result in the maximum reduction of their physical and mental\ndisabilities, and restoration of their best possible functional level . . . .\nAccording to the testimony of Mr. Tom Dalton, Dr. Michael Prince, and\nDr. Pat Casey, which I credit, even though the therapy services may still\nbe available to CHMS children from other sources if the decision . . . is\nimplemented, therapy services not provided in conjunction with CHMS\nday treatment services will not result in the maximum reduction of their\ndevelopmental disabilities or restoration of their best possible functional\nlevel, as is mandated by § 1396d(a)(13).   \nPediatric  Specialty  Care,  Inc.,  etc.,  No:  4:01CV00830WRW,  slip  op.  at  10.\nFurthermore, the district court found that “early intervention day treatment is a\nrehabilitative service, with both medical and remedial components.”  Id.\nThe  evidence  presented  at  trial  demonstrated  that  early  intervention  day\ntreatment services provide numerous benefits to children, including increased IQ\nlevels, reduction in developmental disabilities, and a decreased chance of being placed\nin special education classes.  There was evidence that the American Academy of\nPediatrics urges pediatricians to consider early intervention as a beneficial service and\n-9-\n\nto make appropriate diagnostic evaluations and referrals.7  Upon review of the entire\nrecord, we find that the district court’s factual findings regarding CHMS services are\nnot clearly erroneous.\nNext, we must decide whether the Medicaid Act requires Arkansas to provide\nearly intervention day treatment services.  We believe that this question encompasses\ntwo distinct issues.  First, whether the Medicaid Act requires Arkansas to specifically\nprovide for CHMS early intervention day treatment services in the State Plan, and\nsecond, whether the State Plan must reimburse early intervention day treatment\nservices when a physician determines that they are medically necessary for the\nmaximum reduction of a disability.  The district court resolved these issues by holding\nthat: \n[A]  categorically  needy  individual  under  21  who  requests  medical\nassistance under 1396d(a)(6) and 1396d(a)(13), and [for whom] early\nintervention day treatment is recommended by a physician . . . has a\nfederal  right  to  early  intervention  day  treatment.    Because  early\nintervention day treatment is not provided for elsewhere in the State Plan,\n[A]DHS may not cut funding or provision of early intervention day\ntreatment in the CHMS plan.  \nPediatric Specialty Care, Inc., etc., No: 4:01CV00830WRW, slip op. at 14.  \nWe reverse the district court’s holding to the extent that it requires that CHMS\nearly intervention day treatment services be specifically included in the State Plan.  As\nstated, the State Plan must include the provision of EPSDT services as those services\n7We also note that the Medicaid Act itself contemplates that medical assistance\nfor children with disabilities may have an educational component.  See 42 U.S.C. §\n1396b(c) (noting that Medicaid may cover services that are also part of a child’s\nindividual education program or individualized family service plan adopted pursuant\nto the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act).\n-10-\n\nare  defined  in  §1396d(r).    See  §§  1396a(a)(10)(A),  1396d(a)(4)(B);  see  also\n1396a(a)(43).  Section 1396d(r) lists in detail the screening services, vision services,\ndental services, and hearing services that the State Plan must expressly include, but\nwith regard to treatment services, it states that EPSDT means “[s]uch other necessary\nhealth care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described in subsection\n(a) of this section to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses\nand conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are\ncovered under the State plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(r)(5) (emphasis added).  Reading §\n1396a, § 1396d(a), and § 1396d(r) together, we believe that the State Plan need not\nspecifically list every treatment service conceivably available under the EPSDT\nmandate.  \nThe State Plan, however, must pay part or all of the cost of treatments to\nameliorate conditions discovered by the screening process when those treatments meet\nthe definitions set forth in § 1396a.  See § 1396d(r)(5); see also §§ 1396a(a)(10),\n1396a(a)(43), and 1396d(a)(4)(B).   The Arkansas State Plan states that the “State will\nprovide other health care described in [42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)] that is found to be\nmedically necessary to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses\nand conditions discovered by the screening services, even when such health care is not\notherwise covered under the State Plan.” See State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social\nSecurity Act Medical Assistance Program, State of Arkansas at § 4.b.  This provision\nmeets the EPSDT mandate of the Medicaid Act.  \nWe affirm the district court’s decision to the extent that it holds that a Medicaid-\neligible individual has a federal right to early intervention day treatment when a\nphysician  recommends  such  treatment.    Section  1396d(r)(5)  states  that  EPSDT\nincludes any treatments or measures outlined in § 1396d(a).  There are twenty-seven\nsub-parts to § 1396d(a), and we find that sub-part (a)(13), in particular, when read\nwith  the  other  sections  of  the  Medicaid  Act  listed  above,  mandates  that  early\nintervention day treatment be provided when it is prescribed by a physician.  See 42\n-11-\n\nU.S.C. § 1396d(a)(13) (defining medical assistance reimbursable by Medicaid as\n“other diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services, including any\nmedical or remedial services . . . recommended by a physician . . . for the maximum\nreduction of physical and mental disability and restoration of an individual to the best\npossible functional level”).  Therefore, after CHMS clinic staff perform a diagnostic\nevaluation of an eligible child, if the CHMS physician prescribes early intervention\nday treatment8 as a service that would lead to the maximum reduction of medical and\nphysical disabilities and restoration of the child to his or her best possible functional\nlevel, the Arkansas State Plan must reimburse the treatment.  Because CHMS clinics\nare the only providers of early intervention day treatment, Arkansas must reimburse\nthose clinics.\n Finally, we remind the state that it has a duty under 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(43) to\ninform Medicaid recipients about the EPSDT services that are available to them and\nthat it must arrange for the corrective treatments prescribed by physicians.  The state\nmay not shirk its responsibilities to Medicaid recipients by burying information about\navailable services in a complex bureaucratic scheme. \nIII.  Conclusion\n We remand this case to the district court so that it may modify its injunction in\naccordance with our decision today.   Because the district court found in favor of the\nplaintiffs on the federal statutory claim, it did not consider the plaintiffs’ procedural\ndue process claim.  We remand for appropriate consideration of that claim as well.\n8A day treatment program operated by medical and childhood development\nspecialists who are familiar with the children’s diagnoses and therapies and structure\nthe curriculum to help ameliorate each child’s condition.\n-12-\n\nA true copy.\nAttest:\nCLERK, U.

Against my initial instinct that \"secret doctors\" should not be \nallowed to deny medical care when Medicaid beneficiaries could not effectively challenge the \ndenial, I found that 42 U.S.C.§1320c-9 clothed the deliberations of peer review organizations \n(PRO) with a statutory privilege against the formal discovery process in any administrative or \ncivil proceeding.  On reflection, I tentatively changed my mind, but before entering this Order, \nI asked the parties to file letter briefs on the subject.  After reviewing the Defendant's \narguments, I am convinced that the original Order addressing this issue was wrong. \nBackground \nDue to the complexity of the laws and regulations in this case, background information is \nnecessary.  In 1982, Congress amended the Social Security Act by enacting the \"Peer Review \nImprovement Act,\" codified as 42 U.S.C. §1320c, et seq.  The 1982 legislation allowed PROs to \nassume responsibility for the review of health care services funded under Medicare; to determine \n2 4 2  \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 2 of 17\nif those services are medically necessary, efficient, effective; and if they meet professionally \nrecognized standards of care.  The amended statute also contained a number of confidentiality \nprovisions that are in 42 U.S.c.§ 1320c-9. These generally prohibit the disclosure of information \nacquired or produced by a PRO in carrying out its functions under its contracts with the \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS).  At the time the Act was amended, Congress also \nauthorized the Secretary of Health and Ruman Services to create additional regulations \naddressing the confidentiality provision.  The pertinent regulations were originally promUlgated \nin 1985 and have not significantly changed since that time.  See  42 CFR §§ 476.101-133 (1985) \nand 42 CFR §§ 480.101-133 (2002).  Unfortunately, the names of these organizations change \noften,  and what were referred to as peer review organizations (PROs) are now called quality \nimprovement organizations (QIOs).  To avoid any further confusion, I will continue to use the \nold moniker, PRO. \nBy amending the Act as codified in § I 320c-9, and by limiting the formal discovery \nprocess in civil litigation, Congress created a statutory privilege with respect to certain \ninformation in the possession of, or produced by, PROs.  In their letter brief, the Department of \nHuman Services (DRS) claims that \"nothing in Federal law authorizes the disclosure sought by \nplaintiffs.\"  As stated above,  I now disagree. \nPlaintiffs do not have to prove that disclosure of evidence in a civil or administrative \naction is \"authorized.\"  The DRS must show that the disclosure is protected by a privilege. \nPrivileges are not generally favored by federal courts and are narrowly construed so that access \nto truth will not be unnecessarily fettered.  The general rule is  that \"the public has a right to \nevery man's evidence.\" Trammel v.  United States. 445 U.S. (1980) (quoting United States v. \nBryan. 339 U.S. 323, 331 (1950)).  Any infringements on the \"predominant principle of utilizing \n2 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 3 of 17\nall rational means for ascertaining the truth,\" are to be strictly construed.  Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 \nU.S. 1,9 (1996); University ofF a., v. Equal Employment Opportunity Com 'n, 493 U.S. 182 at \n189 (1990).  Tensions arise in the law of privileges when the public benefit of keeping certain \ninformation confidential conflicts with the public benefit of ascertaining the truth of a matter \nthrough the disclosure of all relevant information. See Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50, 100 S.Ct. 906; \nUniversity ofF a, 493 U.S. 182 at 189;  Jaffee, 518 U.S. at 9.  The United States Supreme Court \nsummed up the guiding rule succinctly: \"[A]n asserted privilege must serve the public ends.\" \nUpjohn v.  United States, 449 U.S. 383,389 (1981).  Thus, to recognize a matter as privileged is \nto find that its concealment promotes an important public interest that outweighs the need for \nevidence.  See Trammel, 445 U.S. at 51.  These principles are manifested in 42 U .S.C. § 1320c-\n9( d).  The language of this subsection ofthe Act is unambiguous, and establishes what matters \nare and are not protected from formal discovery process.  It is also clear that this section was \npromulgated by Congress to distinguish the formal discovery process -- together with the \ntraditional subpoena power'-- from FOI requests and other discovery avenues provided to the \ngeneral public.  In other words, this section applies to individuals who are either parties to \nlawsuits or are pursuing administrative remedies. \n, \nThe Compulsory Process Clause confers the right to compel witnesses to appear through \nuse of subpoena power. The right to compel a witness's presence in the courtroom could not \nprotect the integrity of the adversary process if it did not embrace the right to have the witness's \ntestimony heard by the trier of fact. The right to offer testimony is thus grounded in the Sixth \nAmendment even though it is not described in so many words. Us. v. Janis 2004 WL 2421999, \n5 (8th Cir. 2004) \n3 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 4 of 17\nSection 1320c-9( d) reads: \n(d) Subpoena and discovery proceedings regarding patient records \nNo patient record in the possession of an organization having a \ncontract with the Secretary under this part shall be subject to \nsubpoena or discovery proceedings in a civil action. No document \nor other information produced by such an organization in \nconnection with its deliberations in making determinations under \nsection 1320c-3(a)(l)(B) or 1320c-5(a)(2) of this title shall be \nsubject to subpoena or discovery in any administrative or civil \nproceeding; except that such an organization shall provide, upon \nrequest of a practitioner or other person adversely affected by such \na determination, a summary of the organization's findings and \nconclusions in making the determination. 42 U.S.C. § 1320c-9 \n(Emphasis added) \nThere are two types of documents protected under subsection (d) of § l320c-9:  1) \npatient records in possession of the PRO; 2) records produced by the PRO containing \ninformation about its deliberations that specifically deal with matters outlined in subsection \n1320c-3(a)(l )(B) and subsection 1320c-5(a)(2).  Patient records are addressed in the first \nsentence of subsection 1320c-9( d), while materials other than patient records are addressed in \nthe second sentence.  I will discuss these two types of information separately, starting first where \nsubsection (d) begins --patient records. \nDiscussion \nThe DHS argues that the term \"patient records\" means any patient information \nconnected exclusively with medical necessity determinations.  This is not what the sentence \nsays, instead it refers to \"patient records in possession of the PRO\".  42 U.S.C. l320c-9(d),  Peer \nreview organizations have custody and control of individual patient records for a variety of \nreasons, not just for medical necessity determinations. \n4 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 5 of 17\nDefendant DHS, also claims that the term patient records includes records that \ndisclose the identity of any PRO physician who makes medical necessity decisions.  In other \nwords, Defendant has redefined patient records to include medical records of individuals under \nmedical necessity review, and any documents revealing the name of the physicians responsible \nfor medical necessity reviews.  This interpretation is overly broad. \nStatutory interpretation starts with the language of the statute itself; and a statute is \nread applying the \"ordinary, contemporary and common meaning\"  of the words used.  Perrin v. \nUnited States, 444 U.S. 37,42 (1979).  A patient record is a medical record generated by a \ntreating physician for treatment and diagnosis.  This is the common and ordinary usage of this \nterm.  In fact, Federal Regulations routinely interchange the terms \"medical records\" and \n\"patient records\" in rules designed to protect patient privacy.' In short, there is no indication \nthat Congress meant to embellish the common sense definition of \"patient records\" in the \nmanner suggested by Defendant. \nFurther, the first sentence of subsection 1320c-9( d) describes documents created by \nentities other than PROs, because it clearly refers to records in the \"possession of\" these \norganizations.  By contrast, there is no reference to records \"created, produced or generated\" \nby the PRO.  Applying common usage and common sense to the wording of the first sentence, I \nfind that the term patient records includes medical records of treating physicians, not records \ncreated by reviewing physicians working for a PRO. \nMedical or patient records generally contain private information and are owed protection. \nHowever, there is no specific federal privilege protecting the confidentiality of medical records \n'See 38 CFR §1.489;  38 CFR §17.81-82; 38 CFR §403.730 ;42 CFR §403.730; §416.47; \n42 CFR §482.13; 42 CFR §482.24; 42 CFR §486.306; 42 CFR §489.24. \n5 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 6 of 17\nin federal cases.  Federal Rule of Evidence 501 does not recognize a physician-patient (or \nhospital-patient) privilege.  Rule 501 makes federal common law the source of any privileges in \nfederal-question suits unless an Act of Congress provides otherwise.  Northwestern Memorial \nHasp. v. Ashcroft,  362 F.3d 923, (7th Cir. 2004).  Congress would have no need to pass a law to \nprotect a litigant's own medical records from discovery for the obvious reason that the patient \nparty could secure her own records simply by going to the source without resorting to serving \ncostly subpoenas on PROs. \nWhile a patient may secure her own records, she should not be allowed to gain access to \nthe medical records of others because the records may be relevant to her pending lawsuit.  This \nis the public policy rationale for the first sentence of subsection I 320c-9( d).  It is designed to \nprevent parties to civil actions from getting non-party patient records in order to advance a \ntheory of liability or to buttress a claim or defense to a civil action. \nIf, on the other hand, I were to adopt a more expansive interpretation of subsection \nI 320c-9(d ) -- and find that the term patient records exempts from discovery all documents that \nare possessed by a PRO as well as produced by PRO physicians during a review process-- then \nthere would have been no need for Congress to draft the second sentence carving out an \nadditional privilege.  Such an expansive reading would prohibit any litigant at any time,  from \ndetermining what goes on during the review process of a PRO.  In other words, Congress would \nhave created a Star Chamber of the Medicare-Medicaid process. \nHowever, Congress drafted a second sentence that is more specific in the creation of an \nadditional privilege.  In other words, the second sentence in § 1320c-9(d ) sets out what materials \nin addition to patient records are privileged.  An overly broad construction of the terminology in \nthe first sentence would render the second sentence superfluous.  In statutory construction, \n6 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 7 of 17\nwhere specific expressions conflict with general ones, the rule is to give greater effect to the \nspecific expression.  See  Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc. v.  Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp. 374 F.3d \n701,716 (8th Cir. 2004); Sutherland Statutory Construction § 51.05, at 499-500 (N. Singer \ned.1984).  At the very least, specific expressions should inform an interpretation of general \nexpressions.  An expansive construction of the first sentence of § I 320c-9( d) would create a \nprivilege protecting from disclosure all documents as well as the identity of all physicians \nconnected to PROs.  I have reviewed federal case law and have discovered that when faced with \nsimilar questions, federal courts are reluctant to recognize a broad privilege applicable to peer \nreview organizations.3  Because I decline to accept the interpretation of the first sentence \nsuggested by DHS, an examination of the more specific second sentence of subsection 1320c-\n9(d ) is now in order. \nThe second sentence precludes discovery of information described in two other \nsubsections ofthe Amended Act.  These are § 1320c-3(a)(l)(B) and § 1320c-5(a)(2).  In order to \nbetter understand the intent of Congress, it is important to review both subsections in context.  I \nwill begin with the § 1320c-3(a): \n(a)Review of professional activities, determinations of \nreview authority; consultation with professional health care \npractitioners, standards of health care; other duties .... \n(1) The organization shall review some or all of the \nprofessional activities in the area, subject to the \nUniversity ofPa., 493 U.S. at 195;  Virmani v. Novant Health, Inc., 259 F.3d 284 (4th \n3 \nCir. 2001);  Memorial Hasp. For McHenry County, 664 F.2d 1058 (7th Cir. 1981);  Leon v. \nCounty ofS an Diego, 202 F.R.D. 631 (S.D. Cal, 2001);  Nilavar, MD. v. Mercy Health System \nWestern Ohio, 210 F.R.D. 597 (S.D. Ohio, 2002); Public Citizen, Inc.  v: Us. Dept. Of Health \nand Human Services, 332 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir., 2003); Atteberry v. Longmont United Hospital, \n221 F.R.D. 644 (D. Col. 2004). \n7 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 8 of 17\nterms of the contract and subject to the \nrequirements of subsection (d) of this section, of \nphysicians and other health care practitioners and \ninstitutional and noninstitutional providers of health \ncare services in the provision of health care services \nand items for which payment may be made ... for the \npurpose of determining whether-\n(A) such services and items are or were \nreasonable and medically necessary and \nwhether such services and items are not \nallowable under subsection (a)(l) or (a)(9) \nof section 1395y of this title; \n(B) the quality ofs uch services meets \nprofessionally recognized standards of \nhealth care; and \n(C) in case such services and items are proposed to \nbe provided in a hospital or other health care \nfacility on an inpatient basis, such services and \nitems could, consistent with the provision of \nappropriate medical care, be effectively provided \nmore economically on an outpatient basis or in an \ninpatient health care facility of a different type. \n42U.S.C § 1320c-3(a) (Emphasis added). \nClearly, placing §1320c-3(a)(l)(B) in context shows that there are two other categories \nlisted in subsection (A) and (C) which have been excluded from the privilege created in §1320c-\n9( d).  These excluded materials are:  (I) documents gathered for the purpose of making a \nmedical necessity determination; and (2) information gathered to determine feasibility of \noutpatient versus inpatient care.  On the other hand, Congress specifically included information \ngathered by a PRO to determine whether medical providers meet recognized \"standards of care.\" \n42 U.S.C.§ 1320c-3(a)(I)(B). \nThis brings me to a consideration of §1320c-5(a) and a review of the entire subsection: \n(a) Assurances regarding services and items ordered or \nprovided by practitioner or provider \n8 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 9 of 17\nIt shall be the obligation of any health care practitioner and \nany other person (including a hospital or other health care \nfacility, organization, or agency) ... to assure, to the extent \nof his authority that services or items ordered or provided \nby such practitioner or person to beneficiaries and \nrecipients under this chapter--\n(1) will be provided economically and only when, and to \nthe extent, medically necessary; \n(2) will be of a quality which meets professionally \nrecognized standards ofh ealth care; and \n(3) will be supported by evidence of medical necessity and \nquality in such form and fashion and at such time as may \nreasonably be required by a reviewing peer review \norganization in the exercise of its duties and \nresponsibilities.  42 U.S.C.A. § 1320c-5(a) (Emphasis \nadded). \nAgain, there are two additional categories of information outlined in this subsection that \nare not privileged.  These two categories are set out in subsections (1) and (3) and address \ninformation gathered to determine medical necessity and the efficacy of the evidence supporting \nmedical necessity.  The privileged information set out in subsection (2) is information gathered \nto determine if medical providers meet recognized \"standards of care.\" 42 U.S.C.§ 1320c-5(a)(2). \nBoth § 1320c-3(a) and § 1320c-5(a) list three categories of information that a PRO may \ngather.  Only one of these categories of information is designated as privileged by § 1320c-9(d ). \nThe category involves standard ofc are inquiries.  The pertinent language of § 1320 (a)(1 )(B) \nrefers to information that the care provided by the physician is \"of a quality which meets \nprofessionally recognized standards of health care.\"  Likewise, the pertinent language of \n§ J320c-5(a)(2) refers to information that the care provided by the physician is \"of a quality \nwhich meets professionally recognized standards of health care.\"  When a physician fails to \n9 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 10 of 17\n4 \nprovide care that meets recognized standards, he or she has committed malpractice. The use of \nthe phrase standard ofc are makes it clear that this category of information concerns negligence \nmqumes. \nThere are two other categories of information that are excluded from the privilege \nconferred by § 1320c-9( d), and include information gathered for medical necessity and \nfeasibility.  See above §1320c-3(a)(I) (A) and (C); §1320c-5(a) (I) and (3).  I can only conclude \nthat Congress did not intend to protect these categories of information from disclosure, else \nCongress would have listed them.  It follows that Congress intended for information within these \ntwo categories to be non-privileged.  It is sound statutory construction that the express \ndesignation of one thing may properly be construed to mean the exclusion of another.  Where \nCongress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section \nof the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the \ndisparate inclusion or exclusion.  INS v.  Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432, (1987).  See \nalso Singh-Kaur v. Ashcroft 385 F.3d 293, 299 (3,d Cir. 2004) \nSubsections (A) and (C) of §1320c-3 and (I) and( 3) of §1320c-5 refer to information \ngathered by PROs for the purpose of determining that care is medically necessary, is \neconomically effective, and is supported by evidence of medical necessity and quality.  In sum, . \nthe second sentence in I 320c-9( d) protects from disclosure any investigative material associated \nwith findings of possible medical negligence.  Such a protection from disclosure would conform \nwith numerous state laws which protect peer review evaluations made for the purpose of \n4ARKANSAS MODEL JURY INSTRUCTIONS, Instruction 1501 (1999); Dewitt v. \nBrown, 669 F .2d 516 (81h Cir. Ark. 1982) \n10 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 11 of 17\ninvestigating possible malpractice.'  The public interest at play here is the need to encourage \npeer review committees to evaluate candidly a provider's competence or lack thereof, so safety \nissues may be addressed and corrected for the public good.  Congress determined that such \npublic interest is important enough to outweigh the need for evidence, and therefore, justified the \ncreation of a privilege.  Trammel, 455 U.S. at 51. \nThe case repeatedly cited by Defendants in this matter is Armstrong v. Dwyer, 155 F 3d \n211 (3,d Cir. 1998).  The Armstrong case involved a medical malpractice investigation made by \na PRO on behalf of the DHS.  The plaintiff in Armstrong was seeking material from the PRO \nthat investigated the defendant physician's care of the plaintiff.  The court applied the specific \nlanguage of § I 320c-9 and held that such materials were privileged. \nHowever, the facts presented in  Armstrong are clearly distinguishable from a Medicare-\nMedicaid beneficiary pursing a civil action requesting material from the PRO which denied \nbenefits based on medical necessity.  As I have explained above, Congress specifically allows \ndisclosure of such material by excluding it from the list of material protected in the second \nsentence of §1320c-9(d).  The first sentence is not applicable in this situation because the patient \nrecords belong to the beneficiary challenging the denial, and the plaintiffs would not have to \nobtain their own medical records from the PRO, since plaintiffs have a right to those records. \n'See Ark. Code. Ann.  § 25-19- 105(a) et seq. (Supp.1995); Ark.Code Ann. § 16-46-105 \n(RepI.1994)( provides that peer review and quality assurance records shall not be subject to \ndiscovery or admissible in any legal proceeding and shall be absolutely privileged \ncommunications.); Berry v. Saline Memorial Hosp., 322 Ark. 182 (Ark., I 995) \nII \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 12 of 17\nDefendant, Arkansas Foundation for Medical Care (AFMC) bases its argument on \nregulations enacted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  AFMC begins its \nargument by quoting 42 U.S.C.§ 1320c-3(a)(9)(A), which authorizes the Secretary to permit \naccess to any information \"subject to the provisions of 1320c-9 of this title.\"  I agree.  Any \nregulations must be consistent with the intent of Congress as set forth in the statute itself. \nIn two cogent opinions from the District of Columbia Circuit, the District Court and \nCircuit Court refused to accept the Defendant's broad interpretation of the Peer Review \nImprovement Act as evidenced in the PRO manual created by the Department of Human \nServices.  Public Citizen, Inc. v. Department ofH  ealth and Human Service, et al.  151 F.Supp.2d \n64 (D.C.D.C.2001) aff'd 332 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  Instead the District Court ordered the \nDepartment to provide a litigant with substantive information contained in a peer review \ninvestigation.  The District Court pointed out-- and the Circuit Court agreed-- that when a statute \nis clear and unambiguous, consideration of administrative interpretation contrary to such \nlanguage is inappropriate. Id. at lSI F. Supp. 70; 332 F.3d 659 (citing Chevron U.SA. Inc. v. \nNatural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984». \nDefendant, AFMC cites 42 CFR §480.139 (b) (1) which forbids the disclosure of QIO \n(PRO) deliberations and the identity of the physicians, advisors and consultants involved in \ndeliberations.  However, the preceding regulation, 42 CFR §480.138 (b) (1),  sets forth the \napplication of the regulation.  First, confidential material in medical necessity determinations are \nonly mentioned in relation to investigations by state and federal licensing agencies who are \nstudying the patterns of certain practitioners.  Again, this is applicable to professional standards \nmqumes. \n12 \nI \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 13 of 17\nSecond, 42 CFR §430.138(b) (1) states that restrictions on disclosures are not applicable \n\"in the course ofa dministrative hearings held under the Social Security Act. \" Finally, 42 CFR \n§480.138(b)(2) states in pertinent part that \"[AJ QIO must disclose information regarding QIO \ndeliberations and quality review study information only as specified in 42 CFR §480.139\" \n(Emphasis added).  Once again, the words medical necessity are absent.  This, I believe, is an \neloquent silence.  It follows that this exclusion means that  42 CFR §480.l39 applies to quality \nreviews, not medical necessity reviews, except to the extent that medical necessity materials \nreveal patterns of professional conduct or misconduct. \nAFMC strenuously argues that the identity of physicians and others who take part in PRO \ndeliberations are absolutely protected from a formal discovery process by the above cited \nregulation.  As stated, the regulations must be consistent with the intent expressed by Congress \nas unambiguously set out in §1320c-9.  I have read this section of the Peer Review Improvement \nAct carefully.  There is nothing in the language of § 1320c-9 that demonstrates an intent to \nprotect the confidentiality of PRO physicians and advisors.  In fact, §1320c-9(a)(2) declares its \ngeneral purpose is to insure the confidentiality of the following PRO material:  \"[AJny data or \ninformation acquired by any such organization in the exercise of its duties and functions shall be \nheld in confidence and shall not be disclosed to any person.\"  Again, I point out that the use of \nthe term \"acquired\" and the absence of the term \"produced\" is significant.  The word produced \nonly appears in subsection 1320c-9(d ), addressing standard ofc are investigations, which I have \nalready discussed. \nMost importantly, Congress gives the Secretary the right to create exceptions to any \nlimitations imposed by § 1320c-9, but Congress does not give the Secretary the power to expand \n13 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 14 of 17\nthe Act.  The Act requires the Secretary to formulate regulations so that exceptions to the \nconfidentiality rule may be created for the following reasons: \n(1) to the extent that may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this \npart, \n(2) in such cases and under such circumstances as the Secretary \nshall by regulations provide to assure adequate protection of the \nrights and interests of patients, health care practitioners, or \nproviders a/health care.  (emphasis added) \nA close reading of subsection (a)(2), quoted above, indicates that Congress was interested \nin protecting the privacy and interests of patients, health care practitioners,  and other health care \nproviders-not members of PRO organizations.  The court in the Public Citizen case agrees that \nthe Secretary's role with regard to non-disclosure is not expansive: \n[But] § 1320c-9(a)(2) does not permit the Secretary to impose his own non \ndisclosure requirements; rather, it authorizes the Secretary to promulgate \nregulatory exceptions to the general non-disclosure requirement. Public Citizen, \nInc., 332 FJd at 664. \nAlthough the level of deference afforded an agency interpretation is high, courts remain the \nfinal authority in matters of statutory interpretation and must reject administrative constructions \nwhich are contrary to clear congressional intent.  Ragsdale v.  Wolverine Worldwide Inc., 218 \nFJd 933, 936 (8th 2000).  In the instant case, I do not find that the regulation relied on by the \nAFMC to be necessarily in conflict with § 1320c-9.  The conflict arises only if! accept AFMC's \ninterpretation of the regulation, and I do not.  Instead, I find that 42 C.F.R. §480.138,  limits the \napplication of 42 CFR §480.139 to quality investigations that are concerned with possible safety \nissues involving departures from standard of care, and licensing of practitioners. \n14 \n\nCase 4:01-cv-00830-BSM   Document 242   Filed 11/29/04   Page 15 of 17\nConclusion \nIn view of the above, I find that Plaintiffs may utilize all formal discovery tools provided \nby the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Consequently, Plaintiffs may discover the name, \nqualifications, and identity of each peer review physician and advisor who participated in the \ndenial of medical benefits, based on the premise that the care did not meet medical necessity \nrequirements. \nFurther, the Plaintiffs may discover any other relevant material produced by the PRO in \nmaking medical necessity determination in their case.  On the other hand, consistent with the \nintent of § l320c-9 (d),Plaintiffs may not discover any patient records of non-parties, nor may \nPlaintiffs discover any material produced by the PRO that evaluated the failure of a particular \nmedical provider to follow professional standards of care. \nl/llt. \nIT IS SO ORDERED thi~ day of November, 2004 \nUNI1~CT \nJUDGE \nWM.
