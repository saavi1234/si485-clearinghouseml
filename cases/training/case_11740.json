    "summary": "<p>On March 18, 1997, a federal inmate in state custody in Texas filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12111 et seq in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for declaratory relief, injunctive relief and monetary damages, claiming that the defendants had exhibited a deliberative indifference to his medical condition and as such had violated his constitutional and statutory rights.  Specifically, the Plaintiff claimed that when he entered the custody of the Defendants his initial medical screening health questionnaire was incorrectly completed in violation of policy.  The Plaintiff asserted that as a result of the indifferent administration of the initial medical screening health questionnaire, he was incorrectly classified as not disabled which prevented him from receiving the accommodations he required.  Plaintiff in fact has epilepsy, major depression, and a number of other disabling disorders.  The Plaintiff was subsequently housed in the administrative segregation section, rather than in the hospital ward as he claimed was required by his medical condition.  The Plaintiff contends that this initial misclassification upon entry into custody lead to 17 months of being housed in an incorrect unit without access to the proper accommodations he was entitled to as a disabled person.   The Plaintiff claimed that the lack of proper accommodations led to excessive seizures and mental anguish.  Furthermore, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants had been deliberately indifferent to his medical condition and failed to adequately treat the Plaintiff's chronic kidney disorder for 17 months, which had serious implications for his health in violation of the equal protection clause and the due process clause.  Additionally, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants had breached their duty owed to the Plaintiff as a disabled person by compelling him to wear leg irons, despite their use having been restricted because of his orthopedic disability.  Furthermore, the Plaintiff claimed that the defendants had failed to provide him with appropriate medical care to control his diabetes, which led to a partial loss of his vision.  The Plaintiff further contended that as a result of his inadequate medical care and incorrect classification, he stood trial for a federal crime in a diminished mental and debilitative state in violation of his 5th, 6th, 8th and 14th Amendment rights. </p><p>On motion for summary judgment, the District Court first found that Congress did not intend for the Americans with Disabilities Act to apply to the treatment of prisoners within state prisons.  Furthermore, the District Court found that the Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to the Plaintiff's ADA claim.  Pursuant to the 11th Amendment, the District Court dismissed all of the Plaintiff's claims for damages against Defendants in their official capacities. On the Plaintiff's deprivation of medical care claims, the court held that o amount a constitutional deprivation of medical care, the acts or omissions must be \"sufficiently serious to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\"  Negligent failure to supply medical care does not amount to a constitutional deprivation. Consequently, as to the Plaintiff's §1983 claims, the District Court held that Hall was not denied medical care and consistently received medical care throughout his incarceration, therefore even taken as true, the Defendant's acts and omissions did not amount to a constitutional deprivation of medical care.  Therefore, the Plaintiff's §1983 claims were dismissed by the District Court. In the end, the District Court granted all of the summary judgment motions before it, and dismissed a number of claims for failure to state a claim.  </p><p>On appeal to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, the Plaintiff argued that the District Court incorrectly granted the motions for summary judgment and the dismissals for failure to state a claim.  On October 26, 1999, the 5th Circuit affirmed the District Court's orders but also held that the District Court had erred in holding that the ADA does not apply to prisoners incarcerated in state prisons.  Nevertheless, though it held that the ADA applies to the Plaintiff while incarcerated in the County Jail, the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court's decision on grounds of qualified immunity because the Plaintiff failed to show that the Defendants had shown a deliberate indifference to his serious medical need.</p><p></p>",

INTRODUCTION \nThe plaintiff, Robert Arthur Hall (\"Hall\"), instituted the present action \nagainst several employees ofthe Harris County Jail'  and University of Texas Health \n2 \nScience Center at Houston Medical School asserting causes of action under 42 U.S.C.  § \n1983  (\"Section 1983\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  § 12132 \n(\"ADA\").

Having reviewed the motions, the \nSpecifically, Sheriff Tommy Thomas, Major K.W. Berry, Deputy Marcorif \n1 \nThomas, and Major M.W.

THE DISPUTE \nOn February 21,  1995, the United States Marshals Service arrested Hall \npursuant to a parole violator warrant.  At the time of his arrest, Hall had a history of \nmental and physical disabilities including:  neurological and musculoskeletal difficulties, \nepilepsy, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney dysfunction, diabetes, and several mental and \nemotional disorders (Le., bipolar disorder, clinical major depression, and split personality \ndisorder).3  The plaintiff was assigned to the Harris County Jail.  While housed at this \nfacility, Hall claims that his constitutional rights were violated based on the defendants' \nfailure to adequately treat his medical conditions.  Furthermore, Hall claims that he is \nentitled to relief under the ADA. \n3  As a condition of his prior release on September 8,  1993, Hall was ordered \nto participate in an in-patient or out-patient mental health program.  Hall claims he was \nunable to comply with the Special Mental Health Aftercare Condition placed on his \nparole due to \"la[c   ]king government funds.\"  The plaintiff did receive some treatment at \nthe Mental Health Mental Retardation Association. \n2 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 3 of 18\n. \n, \n• \n• \nIII.  ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION \nA.  Applicable Standards ofR  eview \n1.  Standard for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is proper \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,  if any,  show that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is  entitled to a \njudgment as a matter oflaw.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  56(c).  When reviewing the record upon \nwhich the moving party's motion for summary judgment is based, the Court must draw all \ninferences in favor of the non-moving party.  Matsushita Elec.  Indus.  Co.  v.  Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S.  574, 587 (1986) (citing United States v.  Diebold,  Inc., 369 U.S. 654 \n(1962)).  The moving party bears the initial burden of \"informing the [Court]  of the basis \nfor its motion,\" and identifying those portions of the record \"which it believes \ndemonstrate the absence ofa genuine issue of material fact.\"  Celotex Corp.  v.  Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 323  (1986). \nOnce the moving party meets its burden, the nonmoving party must \"go \nbeyond the pleadings\" and designate \"specific facts\"  in the record \"showing that there is  a \ngenuine issue for trial.\"  Id.  at 324.  An issue is \"genuine\" ifthe evidence is  sufficient for \na reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.  Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby, \nInc., 477 U.S.  242,247-49 (1986).  A failure on the part of the nonmoving party to offer \nproof concerning an essential element of its case necessarily renders all other facts \n3 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 4 of 18\n, \n\" \nimmaterial and mandates a finding that no genuine issue of fact exists.  Saunders v. \nMichelin  Tire  Corp.,  942 F.2d 299,301  (Sth Cir.  1991). \nThe primary inquiry here is whether the material facts present a sufficient \ndisagreement as to require a trial, or whether the facts are sufficiently one-sided that one \nparty should prevail, as a matter oflaw.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247.  The substantive law \nof the case identifies which facts are material.  Id.  at 248.  Only disputed facts potentially \naffecting the outcome of the suit under the substantive law of the case preclude the entry \nof summary judgment.  Id. \n2.  Standard for Motion to Dismiss \nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6), a Court is  entitled to dismiss a \ncomplaint when it \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"  In \nreviewing a Rule  l2(b)(6  ) motion, the court must accept as true the factual allegations in \nthe complaint and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Scheuer v. \nRhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974); Colle v.  Brazos County, 981  F.2d 237,243 (Sth Cir. \n1993).  Thus, a complaint must state specific facts,  not simply legal and constitutional \nconclusions in order to survive a motion to dismiss.  Angel v.  City ofF  airfield, 793 F .2d \n737, 739 (Sth Cir.  1986).  A  court should not grant a Rule  l2(b)(6) motion simply \nbecause it disbelieves the complainant's factual  allegations or considers recovery remote \nor unlikely.  Scheuer, 416 U.S.  at 236; Columbia Natural Resources,  Inc.  v.  Tatum,  S8 \nF.3d 1101, 1109 (6th Cir.  1995).  A motion to dismiss, however, shall be granted ifit \n4 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 5 of 18\n• \nappears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that will entitle him to \nrelief, Conley v.  Gibson, 355 U.S. 41,45-46 (1957), or there is  simply no legal theory \nentitling the plaintiff to relief, Walker v.  South Cent.  Bell Tel.  Co.,  904 F.2d 275,277 (5th \nCir.  1990). \nB.  The ADA and Qualified Immunity \nWhen acting in their official capacity, state employees performing \ndiscretionary functions are granted qualified immunity \"insofar as their conduct does not \nviolate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person \nwould have known.\"  Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982); Melear v.  Spears, \n862 F .2d 1177, 1184 n.8 (5th Cir.  1989).  In order to constitute a \"clearly established\" \nright, a reasonable official must understand that what he is doing violates the right. \nAnderson v.  Creighton, 483  U.S.  635,640 (1987).  Thus, the assessment ofa qualified \nimmunity defense requires an examination of two factors.  First, the court must consider \nwhether the plaintiff has alleged the violation of a clearly established right.  Lampkin v. \nCity ofN  acogdoches, 7 F.3d 430,434 (5th Cir.  1993).  Second, the court must consider \nwhether the actions complained of, with reference to the law that existed at the time, were \nobjectively reasonable.  Rankin v.  Klevenhagen,  5 F.3d 103,  108 (5th Cir.  1993). \nIn order to address the first step of the qualified immunity defense, this \nCourt must determine if the provisions of the ADA apply to prisoners.  The applicability \nofthe ADA to state prisons has been a source of much consternation in the circuit courts. \n5 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 6 of 18\n• \n• \n• \nSeveral circuits have found the broadly worded text of the statute clearly applies to \nprisons.  Crawford v.  Indiana Dep't ofC  orrections,  115  F.3d 481,483-87 (7th Cir.  1997); \nDuffy v.  Riveland, 98 F.3d 447,454-55 (9th Cir.  1996); Inmates oft he Allegheny County \nJail v.  Wecht,  93  F.3d 1124 (3d Cir.), vacated and reh 'g en banc granted, 93  F.3d 1146 \n(1996);  see also Harris  Thigpen,  941  F.2d 1495,  1522 nAI (1Ith Cir.  1991) (noting in \nv. \ndicta that Rehabilitation Act, a predecessor to the ADA, was applicable to prisoners). \nOthers have refused to apply the statute to state prisons by virtue of the Eleventh \nAmendment.  Amos v.  Maryland Dep 't ofP  ub.  Safety and Correctional Servs.,  126 F.3 d \n589,594-607 (4th Cir.  1997);  White  v.  Colorado,  82 F.3d 364, 367 (lOth Cir.  1996); see \nalso Onishea  Hopper,  126 F.3d 1323,  1350-51  n.61  (1Ith Cir.  1997) (Cox, J., \nv. \nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (questioning applicability of Rehabilitation Act \nto state prisons and arguing for en banc consideration of issue).  The Fifth Circuit has not \naddressed this issue. \nThe Court's examination of the scope of the ADA must begin with the text \nof the statute itself.  Title II of the ADA provides, in pertinent part, \n[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or denied the benefits of the services, programs, or \nactivities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity. \n42 U.S.C.  § 12132.  Under the ADA, a \"public entity\" is defined as \"any State or local \ngovernment\" and \"any department, agency,  special purpose district, or other \ninstrumentality ofa State or States or local Government.\"  42 U.S.C.  § 12131(1). \nWithout a doubt, the language of the ADA speaks in broad, all-encompassing terms. \n6 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 7 of 18\nIn order to apply the ADA to state prisons, however, Congress must have \nclearly intended to alter the balance of power between the state and federal government. \nThe constitutional system envisaged by the framers delineated powers between the \nfederal and state governments.  The Supreme Court has consistently recognized that \nCongress must speak in \"unmistakably clear\" language in order to alter this balance. \nAtascadero State Hospital v.  Scanlon, 473  U.S. 234, 242 (1985); Pennhurst State Sch. \nand Hospital  Halderman, 465  U.S.  89,99 (1984); Rice  Santa Fe  Elevator Corp.,  331 \nv.  v. \nU.S. 218,230 (1947).  As the Supreme Court stated in Will v.  Michigan Dep't  o/State \nPolice, \"[T]he requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, \nand intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision.\" \n491  U.S. 58, 65  (1989) (citing United States v.  Bass, 404 U.S.  336, 349 (1971)).  When \nfaced with legislation potentially affecting traditional notions of federalism,  a court must \n\"be certain of Congress'  intent before finding that federal  law overrides\" the previously \nestablished balance of power between the federal and state governments.  Gregory v. \nAshcroft, 501  U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (quoting Atascadero State Hospital,  473  U.S. at 243). \nThe management of prisons is a governmental duty traditionally reserved to \nstates.  As the Supreme Court noted in Procunier v.  Martinez, \nOne of the primary functions  of government is the preservation of societal order \nthrough enforcement of the criminal law, and the maintenance of penal institutions \nis  an essential part of that task. \n7 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 8 of 18\n416 U.S. 396,412 (1974), overruled on other grounds,  Thornburgh  v.  Abbott, 490 U.S. \n401,413-14 (1989).  Recognizing the operation of prisons as  a core government concern, \nthe Supreme Court has also observed, \nIt is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one \nthat is more intricately bound up with state laws,  regulations,  and procedures, than \nthe administration of its prisons. \nPreiser v.  Rodriguez, 411  U.S. 475, 491-92 (1973) (emphasis added).  Thus, in order to \ninterpret the breadth of the ADA, this Court must find that Congress considered and \nunambiguously intended to disrupt the previous balance of federal/state authority with \nrespect to the operation and management of state prisons. \nUnguided by the Fifth Circuit and unpersuaded by arguments to the \ncontrary, this Court holds that Congress did not clearly intend that the ADA should apply \nin the context of state prisons.  With respect to the treatment of prisoners housed therein, \nstate prisons do not clearly fall within the proscription of the ADA.  As noted by the \nFourth Circuit, Title II of the ADA is  entitled \"Public Services\" -- a designation not \nreadily applied in the prison context where the public is purposefully excluded.  Amos, \n126 F.3d at 596 (\"'Public Services' -- connotes a ban on discrimination in services \nprovided to the public, not in the prison context where the public is excluded.\") (quoting \nTorcasio v.  Murray,  57 F.3d 1340,  1346-47 n.5  (4th Cir.  1995)). \nWhether a prisoner falls within the ADA's definition of a \"qualified \nindividual\" is  ambiguous at best.  Under the ADA, discrimination against a \"qualified \nindividual with a disability\" who \"meets the essential eligibility requirements for the \n8 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 9 of 18\n• \nreceipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity\" is forbidden.  Both the Fourth and Tenth Circuits have refused to find that a \nprisoner can be characterized as  a \"qualified individual\" for the purposes of the ADA. \nAmos,  126 F.3d at 596;  White,  82 F.3d at 367 (adopting the reasoning of Williams v. \nMeese,  926 F.2d 994,997 (10th Cir.  1991) (holding federal prison was not a program or \nactivity for the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act)); see also Bryant v.  Madigan,  84 F.3d \n246,248 (7th Cir.  1996) (questioning whether prisoner should be considered qualified \nindividual under ADA); but see  Crawford,  115 F.3d at 483  (rejecting Bryant \"qualified \nindividual\" analysis in prisoner context).  Finding the terms \"eligible\" and \"participate\" \nimply some degree ofvoluntariness, the Fourth Circuit found that Congress did not \nclearly intend that the ADA would apply in the context of correctional facilities where \nprisoners are held against their will.  Amos,  126 F.3d at 596. \nWhen examined in light of the entire statutory scheme, this Court is unable \nto clearly discern a congressional intention to include state correctional facilities within \nthe ambit of Title II ofthe ADA.  As such, the actions Hall attributes to the defendants \ncould not have violated a \"clearly established statutory right\" and, thus, do not state a \ncause of action.  In the alternative, due to the ambiguous language of the ADA, lack of \nguidance from the Fifth Circuit, and entrenched disagreement among the sister circuits, \nthis Court finds that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions \nwith respect to Hall's ADA claim.  Certainly, Hall's rights under the ADA were not so \n9 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 10 of 18\nclearly established that a reasonable state prison official would have realized his actions \nconstituted a violation of the ADA.4 \n5 \nC.  Official Capacity Claims  Under Section 1983\nAll claims for money damages against the defendants in their official \ncapacities are dismissed.  The Eleventh Amendment precludes actions for damages \nagainst a state.  Kentucky v.  Graham, 473  U.S.  159,  169 (1985).  Further, claims against \nstate employees in their official capacities are the functional equivalent of suits against \nthe state.  Will,  491  U.S.  at 71.  Therefore, unless specifically abrogated by Congress, the \nEleventh Amendment prohibits claims for monetary damages against state employees \nacting in their official capacity.  Graham, 473  U.S. at  169 (\"[A] judgment against a public \nservant 'in his official capacity' imposes liability on the entity that he represents.\"). \nBecause Congress failed to explicitly override the Eleventh Amendment with respect to \n4  The Court also notes that Hall's allegations merely amount to a claim for \nthe wrongful denial of medical care.  In Bryant, the Seventh Circuit refused to allow \nsimilar claims to proceed under the ADA, stating, \"Even ifthere were (as we doubt) some \ndomain of applicability ofthe [ADA] to prisoners, the  [ADA] would not be violated by a \nprison's simply failing to attend to the medical needs of its  disabled prisoners.\"  84 F .3d \nat 249. \nHall's status as  a federal prisoner held in a state facility does not affect this \n5 \nCourt's analysis of the present dispute.  A state does not become a federal  actor for the \npurposes of liability by agreeing to house state prisoners.  See generally Harper v.  United \nStates,  515  F.2d 576, 578 (5th Cir.  1975) (holding actions of state prison employees not \nimputed to federal government by virtue of contractual relationship).  As  such, Hall must \nestablish liability against the accused officials in their capacity as state, not federal, \nemployees. \n10 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 11 of 18\nactions under Section 1983, Hall's claims against the defendants in their official \ncapacities are, likewise, barred.  Will,  491  U.S. at 64-71. \nD.  Hall's Constitutional Claims  Under Section  1983 \nIn order to set forth  a cause of action under Section 1983, Hall must prove \nthat the defendants, acting under the color of state law, deprived him of a right, privilege, \nor immunity secured by the Constitution.  Monell v.  Dep 't o/Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, \n691-92 (1978).  Mere conclusory allegations will not support a Section 1983  claim. \nBaker v.  Putnal, 75  F.3d 190,  195  (5th Cir.  1996); Schultea v.  Wood,  47 F.3d 1427,  1433 \n(5th Cir.  1995).  Instead, Hall must allege facts specifying the individual defendant's \npersonal involvement in the deprivation.  Murphy v.  Kellar, 950 F.2d 290,292 (5th Cir. \n1992). \nIn Estelle v.  Gamble, the Supreme Court recognized a prison's obligation to \nsupply inmates with medical care.  429 U.S. 97,  104 (1976).  However, in order to \nestablish a violation ofthe prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights, the acts or omissions of \nthe defendant must be \"sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious \nmedical needs.\"  Id.  at 106.  In order to constitute \"an unnecessary and wanton infliction \nof pain,\"  a prison official must have known of and disregarded an excessive risk to the \nprisoner's health or safety.  Farmer v.  Brennan, 511  U.S.  825,  844 (1994); Reeves v. \nCollins, 27 F.3d  174,  176 (5th Cir.  1994).  Only under exceptional circumstances will an \n11 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 12 of 18\n• \nofficial's knowledge ofa substantial risk be inferred by the obviousness of the risk. \nFarmer,  511  U.S. at 842-43, 843  n.8; Reeves, 27 F.3d at 176. \nNegligent failure to supply medical care, standing alone, does not rise to the \nlevel of a constitutional deprivation.  Estelle, 429 U.S.  at 105-06.  Inadvertent failures to \nsupply medical care or negligent diagnoses do not establish deliberate indifference.  Id. \nFurther, a decision by a prison doctor not to perform additional diagnostic tests or to \nprescribe other forms of treatment is a matter of medical judgment and does not constitute \ncruel and unusual punishment.  Id.  at 107-08.  While deliberate indifference may be \nmanifested by a doctor's failure to respond to a prisoner's needs or by prison guards \nintentionally denying or delaying access to medical treatment,6 the alleged facts must \n\"clearly evince the medical need in question and the alleged official dereliction.\" \nJohnson v.  Treen,  759 F.2d 1236,  1238 (5th Cir.  1985). \n1.  Hall's Claims Against the Doctors \nEven if Hall's allegations are taken as true, the acts and omissions ofthe \nDoctors do not amount to a constitutional deprivation of medical care.  Although Hall \nclaims six medical appointments were canceled, Hall was not denied access to medical \ncare and consistently received medical attention throughout his incarceration.  Hall's \nallegations with respect to missed seizure medications do not amount to deliberate \n6 \nSee id.  at  104-05. \n12 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 13 of 18\n• \nindifference.  Once apprised of the low levels of medication in the plaintiffs blood, the \nDoctors attempted to cure the deficiency through alternative approaches to Hall's \ntreatment regimen.  Hall's complaints of kidney problems were not dismissed by the \nDoctors.  In fact,  an inquiry into the cause of Hall's kidney condition lead to the detection \nand management of Hall's previously undiagnosed diabetic condition.  Presented with a \nhistory consistent with herpes, the Doctors' misdiagnosis of Hall ' s sores and rash fails to \namount to a claim of constitutional proportions.  When viewed in the light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, the Doctors' decision not to issue a Special Needs Advisement regarding \nthe use of leg irons on the plaintiff constitutes a professional medical judgment that will \nnot support a Section 1983  claim. \nAlthough potentially negligent, the Doctors'  alleged conduct was not \ndeliberately indifferent to Hall's medical needs.  Deliberate indifference stems from the \nknowledge of a substantial risk of harm and reckless disregard of the presented risk. \nWhen presented with Hall's myriad symptoms, the Doctors attempted to effectively \ndiagnose and treat his conditions.  The role of this Court is not to question the \nprofessional judgment of the medical doctors that treat inmates.  Instead, this Court is \nbound to enforce the dictates of the Constitution.  Hall's complaints do not amount to the \n\"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain\" proscribed by Eighth Amendment and, as \nsuch, must be dismissed.  Estelle, 429 U.S. at  105-06. \n13 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 14 of 18\n2.  Hall's Section 1983 Claims Against Sheriff Thomas and Quinn? \nBased on the allegations set forth in the original complaint and Court \nordered Rule 7(a) reply, the plaintiff has failed state a claim under Section 1983  against \nSheriff Thomas or Quinn.  In order to assert a Section 1983  cause of action against an \nofficial in his individual capacity and overcome an asserted qualified immunity defense, a \nplaintiff must plead specific conduct on the part of each named defendant giving rise to \nan alleged constitutional violation.  Schultea, 47 F.3d at  1434; Murphy, 950 F.2d at 292. \nAlthough Sheriff Thomas and Quinn may be held liable under Section 1983  for failure to \n8 \nproperly train or supervise subordinates, Hall must support the allegations in his \ncomplaint with factual  specificity.  Schultea, 47 F.3d at  1434. \nThe plaintiff has failed to allege individual conduct on the part of Sheriff \nThomas or Quinn tending to establish improper supervision or failure to adequately train. \nThe plaintiffs complaint merely states conclusory allegations of constitutional violations. \nSee  id.  at 1433  (\"[T]he district court must insist that a plaintiff suing a public official \nunder § 1983  file  a short and plain statement of his complaint, a statement that rests on \n?  On July 7,  1997, the plaintiff tendered Requests for Production of \nDocuments to Sheriff Thomas and Quinn.  Sheriff Thomas and Quinn returned responses \nand objections to the plaintiffs requests on August 7,  1997.  On August 20,  1997, Sheriff \nThomas and Quinn produced substantial records to the plaintiff.  On August 19,  1997, \nthis Court entered a protective order (Instrument #33) pursuant to the stipUlations of \nSheriff Thomas, Quinn, Berry, and the plaintiff.  In this protective order, the parties \nagreed that no further discovery with respect to Sheriff Thomas, Quinn, or Berry would \noccur until after the Court ruled on the defendants'  dispositive motions. \n8 \nBaker, 75  F.3d at 199. \n14 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 15 of 18\nmore than conclusions alone.\").  Although given the opportunity, Hall has twice refused \nto support the allegations found in his original complaint with specific evidence of \nconstitutional violations.  In response to Sheriff Thomas' and Quinn's motions for \nsummary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that insufficient discovery had been completed \nand, as such, he was unable to support a proper reply.  In light of the parties'  stipulated \nprotective order,9 this argument cannot preserve the plaintiffs action.  The Court also \noffered the plaintiff the protection of a Rule 7(a) reply with which to support his \ncomplaint.  Again, the plaintiff fell  woefully short of any factual  specificity.  In fact, \n10 \nHall merely asserted that Sheriff Thomas and Quinn were \"generally familiar with the \npolicies and procedures of the Harris County Sheriffs Department.\"  As such, Hall's \nclaims against Sheriff Thomas and Quinn are dismissed pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12 \n(b)(6).1l \n3.  Hall's Section 1983  Claim Against Berry \nWhen viewed as  a whole, the plaintiff s claims against Berry amount to a \nclaim of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.  Although Hall questions the \n9 \nSee supra note 7. \n10  See December 18,  1997 Order (Instrument #56). \nAlthough Sheriff Thomas and Quinn styled their pleadings as  motions for \n11 \nsummary judgment, this Court has not considered any evidence beyond the plaintiffs \noriginal complaint and Rule 7(a) reply in dismissing these claims. \n15 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 16 of 18\n, \n• \n• \nmanner in which he was classified,12 the only individual conduct attributable to Berry for \nSection 1983 purposes relates to a letter sent to the plaintiffs attorney.  In this letter, \nBerry promises to \"review\" the plaintiffs classification and medical needs.  Hall claims \nthat no \"review\" actually occurred and, as a consequence, Hall was deprived of adequate \nmedical care. \nEven when taken as true, the allegations in Hall's complaint fail to state a \ncause of action under Section 1983.  At worst, Berry's failure to conduct a review of the \nplaintiffs medical needs constituted mere negligence.  Estelle, 429 U.S.  at 105-06 \n(holding negligence alone does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference). \nFurthermore, the plaintiff offers no evidence that Berry's failure,  if any, denied or delayed \nthe plaintiffs access to medical treatment.  Estelle, 429 U.S. at  104-05.  In fact,  the record \nis  overwhelmingly clear that Hall has been given appropriate access to doctors and \nmedical treatment throughout his incarceration.  See supra Section III.D .1.  As such, \nHall's claim against Berry must be dismissed under Fed. R.  Civ. P.  12(b)(6). \n12  Hall also questions his initial classification and assignment to \nadministrative segregation.  However, a prisoner has no federally protected liberty \ninterest in \"remaining in a particular prison or a particular unit within a prison.\"  Mitchell \nHicks,  614 F.2d 1016,  1018 (5th Cir.  1980) (emphasis added) (citing Meachum \nv.  v. \nFano, 427 U.S. 215  (1976) and Montanye v.  Haymes, 427 U.S. 236 (1976)).  As such, a \nprisoner must resort to a state law entitlement in order to set forth a right protected by due \nprocess.  Hall cites no state statute, prison regulation, or informal prison policy sufficient \nto create a constitutionally protected due process right with respect to his classification at \nthe Harris County Jail.  Mitchell,  614 F.2d at  1019. \n16 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 17 of 18\n• \n• \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nAlthough the plaintiff obviously suffers from severe mental and physical \nillnesses, this Court refuses to condemn the actions of the defendants.  The plaintiff was \nnot denied access to medical care, and the treatment prescribed by the Doctors was not \ninconsistent with the medical history presented by the plaintiff.  As such factors are \napparent from the record, the Doctors' motion for summary judgment is hereby \nGRANTED.  As the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action against Sheriff Thomas, \nQuinn, and Berry, their respective motions are also GRANTED. \nBased on the foregoing, the plaintiffs Section  1983  claims against the \nDoctors, Sheriff Thomas, Quinn, and Berry, individually, are DISMISSED.  The alleged \nconduct of the Doctors and Berry does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. \nWith respect to Sheriff Thomas and Quinn, the plaintiff has failed to  specify individual \nconduct which caused a deprivation of a constitutional right. \nThe plaintiffs claims under the ADA, 42 U.S.C.  § 12132, are DISMISSED \nwith respect to all named defendants.  The language of the ADA does not provide this \nCourt with the clear congressional intention necessary to alter the existing federal  and \nstate balance of power in the prison context.  Furthermore, the plaintiff has not shown that \na reasonable prison official would have known that his actions constituted a violation of \nthe ADA. \nThe plaintiffs official capacity claims under Section 1983  against all \nnamed defendants are DISMISSED to the extent the plaintiff requests money damages. \n17 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 65    Filed in TXSD on 01/15/98   Page 18 of 18\n• \n• \nAs the plaintiff is presently incarcerated in the Montgomery County Jail, the plaintiff's \nrequest for injunctive relief under Section 1983  is DISMISSED AS MOOT.  The Eighth \nAmendment and prison administrative procedures have adequately protected the prisoner \nthus far.  Further, no evidence of potential retaliatory conduct has been presented to this \nCourt.  Based on these considerations, injunctive relief is, therefore, inappropriate. \nThe sole remaining claims in this dispute are the plaintiff's Section 1983 \ncauses of action against Pamela Wilson, K.  Howard, and MarcorifThomas, individually. \nThe Court takes this opportunity, pursuant to Fed. R.  Civ. P.  4(m), to advise the plaintiff \nthat the time for serving Pamela Wilson and MarcorifThomas has expired.  Barring the \nsubmission of memoranda, within ten days of this date, showing good cause for this \nfailure, the plaintiff's claims against these two defendants will be dismissed for want of \nprosecution. \nSigned this  15th day of January,  19  8. \n~~~MK.~HOYT \nUnited States District Judge \n18 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com",

Houston,  Texas  77026.  Defendant  Wilson  is  named  1n  this  action  in  her  individual  and \nofficial  capacities. \nIV \nFACTS  OF  CLAIM \n(A)  On  9/8/93  Plaintiff  was  released  from  the  custody  of  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons \n(BOP)  and  paroled  to  the  custody  of  the  United  States  Parole  Commission  (USPC)  to  the \nsupervision  of  Mr.  Louis  Brewster,  Chief  Probation  Officer,  Southern  District  of  Texas.  Direct \nsupervision  of  Plaintiff  was  delegated  to  Mr.  Frank  Flanigan,  U.S.  Probation  Officer,  Conroe, \nTexas.  At  the  time  of  release  BOP,  USPC  and  U.S.  Probation  Office  records  adduce  an  ongoing \nhistory  of  serious  physical  and  mental  conditions  that  legally  designated  Plaintiff  as  a  disabled \nperson  pursuant  to  definitions  found  in  the  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act.  (See  42  U.S.C. \nSection  12102  (2)  (A)  (B);  and  28  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  Section  35.104  et  seq.).  These \ndisabilities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  neurological  (brain  damage  at  birth);  epilepsy; \nmusculoskeletal;  hyperthyroidism;  chronic  kidney  dysfunction  (renal  calculi);  diabetes;  mental  and \nemotional  illnesses  of  life  long  nature  such  as  bipolar  disorder  (manic  depressive),  clinical  major \ndepression  and  split  personality.  (See  records  attached  as  Exhibits  58-64).  Plaintiff's  case  history \nand  mental  condition  warranted  Mr.  Brewster's  office  to  seek  and  receive  as  a  condition  of  release \na  \"Special  Mental  Health  Aftercare  Condition\"  which  stipulated  \"you  shall  participate  in  an  in- \npatient  or  an  out-patient  mental  health  program  as  directed  by  your  probation  officer.\"  (See \n§/23/95  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  58). \n(B)  =  Inearly  1994  Plaintiff  experienced  severe  kidney  problems.  Being  indigent \nPlaintiff  applied  at  the  Harris  County  Hospital  District  Regional  Eligibility  Center  for  a  Patient  ID \ncard  known  commonly  as  the  \"Gold  Card.\"  Plaintiff  received  the  gold  card  and  was  designated  to \nthe  Acres  Home  Community  Health  Center.  At  the  center  tests  were  conducted  and  it  was \ndiscovered  that  Plaintiff  had  traces  of  blood  and  ketones  in  a  urine  sample  which  prompted  the \ncenter  to  refer  the  case  to  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  General  Hospital  (LBJGH).  At  LBJGH  it  was\ndetermined  that  with  a  chronic  kidney  infection  that  Plaintiff  had  developed  a  kidney  stone  (renal \ncalculi).  The  LUBJGH  Urology  Staff  triaged  Plaintiff's  case  to  Hermann  Hospital  for  \"Lithotnpsy\" \nto  remove  the  kidney  stone  in  July  1994. \n(C)  Plaintiff  physically  weakened  by  months  of  infection  and  constant  pain  from  the \nkidney  condition,  and  not  receiving  the  therapy  and  treatment  as  ordered  under  the  USPC  Special \nMental  Health  Aftercare  Condition  supposedly  due  to  laking  government  funds,  went  into  major \ndepression.  The  depression  caused  Plaintiff  to  seek  other  avenues  of  the  much  needed \npsychotherapy  and  psychiatric  treatment.  In  September  1994,  Plaintiff  made  contact  with  the \nMental  Health  Mental  Retardation  Association  (MI   RA)  in  Humble,  Texas.  The  MHMR/ A \ndiagnosed  Plaintiff  with  Major  Depression/Organic  Mood  Disorder,  prescribed  the  psychotropic \nmedication  Elavil  but  was  unable  to  provide  individual  counseling  with  a  psychiatrist.  (See \nMHMRA  record  attached  as  Exhibits  64,65)  Still  suffering  from  the  chronic  kidney  condition  and \nuntreated  major  depression,  Plaintiff  was  arrested  on  a  USPC  parole  violator  warrant  and  placed \nin  the  Harris  County  Jail  (HCJ)  as  a  federal  prisoner  on  2/21/95  under  sheriff's  prisoner  number \n615184.  (See  MHI \n{R  record  attached  as  Exhibits  64,  65).  Still  suffering  from  the  chronic  kidney \ncondition  and  untreated  major  depression,  Plaintiff  was  arrested  by  the  Houston  Office  of  the \narshals  Service  on  a  USPC  parole  violator  warrant.  The  Marshals  Service  had \nthe  Plaintiff  placed  in  the  Harris  County  Jail  (HCJ)  as  a  federal  prisoner  on  2/21/95  under  Sheriff's \nPrisoner  Number  (SPN)  615184. \n(D)  HARRIS  COUNTY  SHERIFF'S  DEPARTMENT  (HCSD \n     \nCLASSIFICATION  AND  SCREENING.  1.)  After  being  placed  in  the  HCSD- \nJail  Division  (HCSD-JD)  1301  Franklin  Jail  facility  (1301  facility)  a  medical  screening  health \nquestionnaire  was  incorrectly  completed  by  Defendant  Deputy  Aarcorif  Thomas.  (See  2/22/95 \nrecord  attached  as  Exhibit  49)  Three  correct  answers  were  glossed  over  which  directly  influenced \nclassification  criteria  and  these  three  omissions  discriminated  against  the  Plaintiff's  disabled  status \nby  depriving  him  of  both  immediate  and  needed  physical  and  psychiatric  medical  attention  that \ndate  and  at  later  dates  in  this  complaint.  The  incorrect  answers  are  (a)  as  to  question  number  one: \nonly  hours  after  the  questionnaire  was  completed  the  HCSD-Medical  Division  (HCSD-MD)  and \nLBJGH  medical  records  indicate  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  LBJGH  at  the  consulting  request  of\n  \n             \n  \nDefendant  Dr.  C.  Trinh  as  Plaintiff  was  in  extreme  pain  from  the  chronic  kidney  infection  and \ndysuria.  (See  2/22/95  records  attached  as  Exhibits  1,50).  (b)  as  to  questions  ten  and  eleven: \nanswer  to  twelve  states  yes,  the  Plaintiff  had  previously  been  in  the  HCJ  on  5-18-1988.  Deputy \nThomas  omitted  or  ignored  the  proper  HCSD  policy,  procedure,  program  or  plan  of  reviewing \nthe  1988  HCJ  incarceration.  Verification  of  the  1988  jail  record  would  have  stated  that  Plaintiff \nwas  admitted  to  the  same  HCJ  1301  facility  in  1986  and  placed  on  the  HMRA  jail  floor  and \nconsidered  a  suicide  risk  at  that  trme.  The  record  further  reflects  that  Plaintiff  attempted  suicide  in \nthe  Harris  County  Jail  in  1975.  (See  2/22/75  record  attached  as  Exhibit  59)  The  health \nquestionnaire  is  the  primary  medical  screening  of  incoming  inmates  for  potential  psychiatric \nattention.  The  glossing  over  and  indifferent  answering  techniques  of  the  classification  deputy,  as \nin  this  instance,  lead  to  a  permanent  set  of  misinformation  facts  to  become  a  permanent  part  of \nPlaintiffs  HCSD-MD  Medical  Record  (MR).  This  adversely  effected  Plaintiff's  immediate  and \nsubsequent  treatment  as  a  disabled  person  in  not  being  able  to  realize  any  accomodations  in  the \nHCJ  because  the  initial  medical  screening  is  declaring  no  to  mental  health  problems  when  clearly \nthe  present  records  and  the  past  jail  records  historically  state  the  opposite.  Should  the  questions \nbeen  correctly  answered  then  theoretically  with  a  yes  answer  to  either  question  it  should  have \nactivated  a  \"Red  Flag”  for  the  Plaintiff  to  have  been  interviewed  by  the  MHMRA  staff  at  the  HCJ. \n2.)  On  2/23/95  a  second  health  questionnaire  was  completed  after  Plaintiff  returned  from  LBJGH \nand  repeated  the  same  mistakes  as  on  the  2/22/95  questionnaire.  (See  2/23/95  record  attached  as \nExhibit  55)   P   mitting  to  feeling  suicidal,  was  not  sent  to  the   N   IMRA  floor,  but \nrather  classified  to  the  fifth  floor  of  the  HCJ  1301  facility,  to  be  housed  in  a  single  man \nsegregation  cell  in  cellblock  5B5.  The  2/22/95  questionnaire  states  a  yes  to  question  seven  in  that \nPlaintiff  was  taking  seizure  medications  for  his  epileptic  condition.  Plaintiff  with  the  handicaps  of \nepilepsy,  hyperthyroidism,  kidney  dysfunction  and  life  long  mental  illness  was  not  classified \ncorrectly.  Instead  of  being  placed  in  a  \"hospital  cellblock\"  on  the  MHMRA  floor,  he  was  instead \nplaced  in  the  more  severe  setting  of  administrative  segregation.  The  5B5  cells  were  designated  for \nminimal  contact  with  other  humans.  These  cells  consist  of  four  solid  surrounding  concrete  walls \nwith  a  recessed  metal  sliding  door  with  a  five  inch  slit  window  that  does  not  permit  outside  visual \ninspection  of the  cells  total  interior  area.  Approximately  one-third  of  the  cell's  interior  is  out  of\n        \n     \nthe  visual  sight  line  of  the  supervising  HCSD  Deputy  Sheriff  and  it  is  in  this  section  that  the  wall- \nmounted  steel  bunk  is  located.  (See  example  drawing  attached  as  Exhibit  32)  It  1s  in  this \nunobservable  section  of the  cell  that  Plaintiff  has  been  forced  to  sleep  or  sit  for  more  than  a  year. \nIt  is  against  the  dictates  of  reasonable  correctional/jail  motiffs  in  the  safe  and  orderly  operation  of \nthe  institution,  for  an  epileptic  or  any  seizure  related  medically  diagnosed  inmate  to  be  classified \nand  housed  alone  and  out  of  the  sight  of  all  medical  and  security  personnel  that  could  render \nassistance/aid  to  the  usually  repetitive  cycle  with  seizure  disorders.  3)  On  2/27/95  the  HCSD \nclassification  officers  made  another  error  in  Plaintiff's  case  by  transferring  him  from  the  1301 \nfacility  to  the  701  N.  San  Jacinto  facility  (701  facility).  The  HCSD  policy,  procedure,  program, \nor  plan  on  classification  was  to  keep  all  “inmate  medical  cases\"  similar  to  Plaintiff's  at  the  1301 \nfacility  where  the  main  HCSD-MD  clinic  1s  located.  On  3/9/95,  eleven  days  later,  the \nclassification  officers  at  the  request  of  the  HCSD-MD  701  facility  clinic  corrected  the  mistake  and \nreturned  Plaintiff  as  a  \"medical  case\"  back  to  the  1301  facility.  Though  the  classification  officers \nnow  clearly  recognized  the  medical  status  of  Plaintiff  the  classification  officers  did  not  place \nPlaintiff  in  a  hospital  cellblock  or  on  the  medical  floor,  but  rather  continued  in  the  deprivation  of \nPlaintiff's  serious  medical  needs  by  classifying  him  back  to  5B5-09  administrative  segregation.  4) \nOn  4/18/96  HCSD  grievance  #96-03  was  partially  sustained  to  Plaintiffs  allegations  that  the \nadministration  has  allowed  the  \"overall  conditions\"  of  administrative  segregation  cell  block  5B5- \n09,  where  Plaintiff  as  a  disabled  person  had  been  confined  in  a  segregation  cell  for  over  a  year,  to \nbecome  \"punitive\"  through  discrimination  and  the  loss  of  Plaintiff's  privileges  without  due  process \nof  law.  (See  3/6/96  inmate  Grievance  Form  attached  as  Exhibit  71).  The  promised  administrative \nrelief to  the  granted  grievance  was  never  forthcoming.  (See  4/18/96  IGB-004  Form  attached  as \nExhibit  72)  5)  The  permanent  misinformation  of  Deputy  Thomas  in  the  two  health \nquestionnaires  of  2/22/95  and  2/23/95  are  still  part  of  Plaintiff's  active  MR  and  this  prevented  the \nHCSD-MD  from  making  the  same  type  accomodation  referral  to  the  HC]  MHMRA  Forensic  Unit \nconcerning  Plaintiff's  clinical  depression.  In  paragraph  C  supra  the  Plaintiff  was  diagnosed  at \n.  on  9/01/94  with  major  depression  and  so  had  a  medical  history  and  MR  readily \navailable  to  the  MHI  RA  Forensic  Unit  at  the  HCJ.  Had  not  Deputy  Thomas,  through  negligence \nand  deliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs  as  a  disabled  person,  glossed  over\n     \nthe  answers  to  the  health  questionnaire,  thus  defeating  its  design  and  purpose,  then  Plaintiff  would \nhave  been  referred  to  M  RA  and  his  case  picked  up  and  treatment  for  his  depression  been \nprovided  for.    Ironically  P   laintiffs  MR  at  M HM RA  at  Humble,  Texas  shows  the  MHM RA \nsearching  for  Plaintiff  from  1/10/95  to  3/17/95  which  was  one  (1)  month  after  his  incarceration  in \nRA  record  attached  as  Exhibit  65)  Nearly  a  year  later  Dr.  Guice  documents \nPlaintiff's  ongoing  \"mild  depression\"  in  the  MR.  (See  1/10/96  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  18) \nThe  record  supports  that  Plaintiff  has  suffered  life-long  depression;  was  suffering  major \ndepression  on  9/01/94;  admitted  to  feeling  suicidal  on  being  booked  into  the  HCJ  on  2/22/95;  and \na  general  practioner  notes  a  year  later  on  1/10/96  that  Plaintiff  appeared  to  be  suffering  \"mild \ndepression.\"  The  record  is  silent  to  any  accomodation  of  mental  health  treatment  by  any  agency, \nespecially  the  MHMRA,  during  Plaintiff's  entire  incarceration  in  the  HCJ  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96. \n(E)  The  physical  and  mental  suffering  of  Plaintiff  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96  in  the  HCJ \nwas  the  proximate  result  of  Defendant  M.  Thomas’  egregrious  failure  to  properly  classify  the \nPlaintiff  as  a  disabled  person  and  to  provide  an  adequate  jail  housing  assignment  as  an \naccomodation  that  kept  the  Plaintiff  from  harm,  injury  or  reasonable  fear  thereof,  and  that  this \ncallous  disregard  of  and  deliberate  indifference  to  the  rights,  personal  safety  and  medical  needs  to \nthe  Plaintiff  as  a  disabled  person  and  was  the  direct  result  ofa   pattern  and  practice  of  the  hiring  of \nunqualified  and  incompetent  security  personnel  to  work  in  the  HCSD  classification  section,  the \nmaintenance  of  inadequate  security  measures  and  procedures  to  insure  proper  classification  of \ninmates  in  the  HCJ  and  these  described  circumstances  and  conditions  were  deliberately  and \nknowingly  maintained  by  the  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  and  M.  Thomas  and  each  of  them, \nand  in  total  callous  disregard  of  and  deliberate  indifferences  to  the  rights  and  personal  safety  and \nwell-being  of  the  Plaintiff  thereby  subjecting  Plaintiff,  and/or  causing  him  to  be  subjected  to  an \nunfit  and  dangerous  living  enviornment  and  conditions  pervaded  with  a  high  level  of  injury,  the \nunnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain  that  denied  him  due  process,  was  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment  and  a  denial  of  equal  protection  of  the  law  that  resulted  in  Plaintiff  being  in  diminished \nmental  and  debilatative  physical  states  of  health  for  seventeen  (17)  months  during  which  time \nPlaintiff  was  compelled  to  stand  federal  trial  in  Cause  No.  H-95-201  on  November  29,  1995,  in \nsaid  states  of  health,  and  all  of  the  foregoing  in  violation  of  Plaintiff's  federally  protected  rights  as\n               \n  \ndelineated  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs. \nHCSD -  Initial!  Aedical  Interview-Referral  to  LyndonB.  Johnson  General \n(F) \nAfter  the  2/22/95  classification,  and  that  same  date,  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  the  HCSD-MD \nclinic  in  the  1301  facility  for  a  regular  physical  evaluation  given  to  all  new  arrivals  in  the  HCJ \nsystem.  At  this  evaluation  the  diagnosis  arrived  at  was  1)  Epilepsy,  2)  Hyperthyroidsim,  3) \nhistory  of  Renal  Calculi  (kidney  stones)  and  that  Plaintiff  had  not  urinated  in  some  time  and  was  in \nextreme  discomfort  with  pain  radiating  from  mid-back  to  groin.  Treatment  of  the  kidney \ndysfunction  in  1994  was  noted,  and  that  the  HCSD-MD  staff  had  been  unable  to  void  Plaintiff's \nbladder  with  a  straight  catheter  attempt.  A  request  was  made  by  Defendant  Dr.  C.  Trinh,  HCSD- \nMD,  to  send  Plaintiftfo   LBJGH  by  van  for  a  urology  evaluation.  (See  2/22/95  MR  ent \nas  Exhibit  1)  Prior  to  being  taken  to  LBJGH,  the  HCSD-MD  was  able  to  obtain  a  small  urine \nsample  that  tested  to  have  \"trace  blood  and  small  ketones.\"  (See  2/22/95  consultation  request \nattached  as  Exhibit  50)  The  2/22/95  Consultation  Request  stated  that  Plaintiff  had  been  evaluated \nand  treated  by  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff  in  the  past  (1994). \n(G)  Kidney  Dysfunction  Treatment.  1)  After  the  2/22/95  consultation  was  issued \nthe  Plaintiff  was  transported  by  the  HCSD  to  LBJGH  and  arrived  at  10:00  a.m.  on  2/22/95.  A \nHCHD  Emergency  Department  Record  was  completed  on  Plaintiff.  (See  2/22/95  HCHD  Record \nattached  as  Exhibit  51)  This  record  stated  the  chief  complaint  was  \"Pain/Dysuria/Seizure \nDisorder.\"  The  \"Initial  Assessment\"  category  stated  \"Kidney  stone  crushed  last  July,  pain,  trace \nblood.\"  The  history  category  notes  \"Lithotripsy\"  in  July  1994.  At  the  bottom  of the  record  is  a \ndrawing  and  description  of  Plaintiff's  symptoms.  Directly  under  the  history  is  the  \"Date/Time\"  that \nStates  2/22/95  at  12:45p.m.  the  evaluations  elapsed  time  in  the  overcrowded  county  hospital  was \ntwo  hours  and  forty-five  minutes.  The  bottom  left  hand  corner  of  the  record  bears  the  imprint \nfrom  Plaintiff's  \"Gold  Card\"  patient  ID  which  proves  that  Dr.  Pamela  Wilson  of  the  LBJGH \nUrology  Staff  was  aware  that  it  was  the  same  patient  that  had  been  previously  treated  for  Renal \nCalculi  and  kidney  dysfunction  a  few  months  before  in  1994.  As  a  free  indigent  disabled  person, \nPlaintiff  had  received  moderately  good  medical  attention  from  LBJGH.  In  custody  as  an  indigent \ndisabled  prisoner  Plaintiff  seemingly  ceased  to  exist  as  a  human  being  with  civil  rights  by  the\n     \n                 \n  \nUrology  Staff,  for  the  LBJGH  medical  record  turns  quiet  to  the  needs  of  the  Plaintiff  for  at  12:50 \np.m.  on  2/22/95,  Plaintiff  was  discharged  by  Dr.  Wilson  without  receiving  treatment  whatsoever \nfor  the  same  condition  that  Plaintil  {  had  been  treated  for  at  LBJGH.  (See  HCHD  record  attached \nas  Exhibit  52)  The  disparity  of  the  record  becomes  clear  when  Exhibits  50  and  51  are  compared \nwith  the  HCHD  emergency  center  discharge  instructions  of  Exhibit  52.  These  instructions \nindicate  the  Plaintiff is  to  resume  \"normal  activity\"  though  the  Urology  Staff  knew  of  the  1994 \nkidney  condition  treatment  and  of  the  instant  complaint  that  date  which  urine  samples  showed \n\"traces  of  blood  and  ketones.\"  There  is  no  follow-up  written  orders  concerning  the  kidney \ncomplaint.  The  callous  disregard,  deliberate  indifference  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain  by  Dr. \nWilson  and  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff  against  the  disabled  Plaintiff  was  so  blatant  that  a  doctor \nsigned  in  the  \"Patients  Signature”  space  of  Exhibit  52  and  a  copy  was  not  given  to  the  Plaintiff \neven  though  the  record  exhibits  Plaintiff's  \"P  ff  was  dismissed \nby  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff  without  comment.  From  this  date  forward  there  was  no  further \nfollow-up  orders  or  medical  attention  by  Dr.  Wilson  and  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff  which  resulted \nin  Plaintiff  continuing  to  suffer  physical  pain  and  experience  extreme  distress  with  this  untreated \nkidney  condition  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96.  2)  Plaintiff  was  taken  from  LBJGH  to  the  HCSD-ML \nclinic  at  the  1301  facility.   }   is.  C.  Ware,  LVN,  completed  a  \"Master  Problem  List\"  whic    1s  part \nof  the  Plaintiff's  MR.  (See  2/22/95  Master  Problem  List  attached  as  Exhibit  53) \nThe  }  aster  Problem  List  is  silent  to  Plaintiff's  chronic  kidney  condition  for  it  is  not  listed  as  a \nproblem  though  this  is  the  same  HCSD-MD  clinic  that  sent  Plaintiff  to  LBJGH  a  few  hours  before \nwith  a  consultation  request  issued  by  Dr.  Trinh,  HCSD-MD  that  states:  \"...renal  calculi  presents \n(@  extreme  back  and  abdo.  discomfort,  claims  evaluated  by  LBJ  Urology  in  the  past,  s/p  removal \nof  kidney  stone,  currently  c/o  dysuria,  backpain  @  radiation  to  groin.  Urine  dip:  trace  of  blood, \nsmall  ketones...\"  (See  exhibits  1  &  50).  It  1s  indicative  of  the  deliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiff's \nserious  medical  needs  as  a  disabled  person  that  Dr.  Trinh  sent  Plaintiff  to  LBJGH  based  on  the \nmedical  facts  that:  (a)  The  medical  staff  at  first  had  been  unable  to  obtain  a  urine  sample  with  a \n\"straight  catheter  attempt;”  (b)  once  having  obtained  a  small  urine  sample  it  tested  positive  for  the \npresence  of  trace  blood  and  small  ketones;  (c)  the  medical  staff  was  apprised  of  the  past  history  of \nkidney  and  urinary  tract  conditions  and  that  Plaintiff  stated  he  had  been  evaluated  by  the  LBJ \nLO\n  \n        \n  \nUrology  Staff  which  was  verified  at  LBJGH  on  2/22/95;  (d)  and  that  Plaintiff  was  exhibiting  signs \nof  physical  distress,  pain  and  discomfort.  Dr.  Trinh  neglected  to  provide  proper  medical  care  by  a \nfollow-up  interview  which  would  have  exposed  Plaintiffs'  unchanged  physical  conditions  and  he \nwould  have  seen  by  the  HCHD  medical  paperwork  that  Plaintiff  had  not  been  accomodated  or \ntreated  at  LBJGH  but  rather  had  been  \"shuffled\"  through  by  the  indifferent  Urology  Staff  and  that \nPlaintiff,  as  a  disabled  person,  was  still  in  need  of  serious  medical  attention.  This  failure  to \nprovide  proper  medical  care  through  Dr.  Trinh’ s  deliberate  indifference,  brought  about  the \nneedless  suffering  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain  to  the  Plaintiff.  With  nurse  Ware's  omission  in  the \nmaster  problem  list,  and  with  Dr.  Trinh's  failure  to  follow-up  on  his  own  ordered  consultation \nrequest,  it  is  demonstrated,  as  with  the  foregoing  health  questionnaires  in  part  D  of  this  complaint, \nthat  there  is  a  discernable  pattern  and  practice,  based  on  negligence  of  official  HCSD  Medical \nRecords  with  omitted  or  missing  information  and  over  looked  pertinent  medical  data,  not  making \nits  way  into  Plaintiff's  permanent  HCSD-MD  medical  record.  The  policy,  procedure,  program,  or \nplan  that  the  HCSD-MD  utilizes  in  accurate  record  keeping,  as  charged  by  law,  is  here \ndemonstratably  being  departed  from  and  which  proved  to  be  a  contributing  factor  that \ndetrimentally  affected  Plaintiff's  health  and  well-being  as  a  isabled  person  in  the  subsequent  non- \ntreatment  of  Plaintiff's  chronic  kidney  condition  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96.  3)  The  3/30/95 \nPlaintiffs  MR  describes:  \"burning  urination\"  and  a  4/3/95  M.D.  appointment  is  set.  The  Plaintiff's \nMR  at  4/3/95  describe:  \"chronic  kidney  stones.\"  (See  4/3/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  3)  The \nspecific  kidney  complaint  was  overshadowed  and  completely  forgotten  by  the  misdiagnosis  of  the \n\"Herpes.\"  No  further  follow-up  was  ordered  concerning  the  kidney  condition  and  the  resultant \npain  which  the  plantiff  had  suffered  from  the  untreated  ailment  for  forty-two  (42)  days.  4)  The \n4/14/95  Plaintifi   ' s   MR  describes:  \"dysuria\"  and  again  the  specific  kidney/urinary  condition  was \novershadowed  and  completely  forgotten  by  the  ongoing  misdiagnosis  of  \"Herpes.\"  No  further \nfollow-up  was  ordered  concerning  the  \"dysuria\"  and  the  resultant  pain  which  the  Plaintiff  had  now \nsuffered  from  for  fifty-three  (53)  days.  (See  4/14/95  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  5).  5)  The  6/8/95 \nPlaintiff's  MR  describes:  “back  pain  6-8  wks.\"  A  6/19/96  M.D.  appointment  was  scheduled  for \nPlaintiff  but  was  never  kept  by  the  HCSD-MD.  (See  6/8/95  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  7)  Plaintiff \nhad  now  been  in  back  and  kidney  pain  for  one-hundred  and  nineteen  (119)  days.  6)  The  7/18/95 \nI]\n                    \n  \n     \nPlaintiffs  MR  describes:  \"chronic  back  pain\"  (kidney  area).  Plaintiff  realizing  that  no  adequate \nmedical  care  is  going  to  be  forthcoming  after  five  (5)  months  of  requests  to  the  HCSD-MD,  asks \nfor  an  extra  mattress  and  medications  to  stop  the  pain  in  his  back.  This  patchwork  medical \nrequest  is  granted  and  Plaintiff is  given  a  \"Special  Needs  Advisement\"  (SNA)  for  an  extra \nmattress.  (See  7/18/95  advisement  attached  as  Exhibit  57)  and  a  minor  pain  medication  for  fifteen \n(15)  days.  (See  7/18/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  9)  No  further  follow-up  was  ordered \nconcerning  the  kidney  related  back  pain  which  Plaintiff  had  now  suffered  with  for  one-hundred \nand  forty-eight  (148)  days.  7)  The  11/27/95  Plaintiff's  MR  describes:  \"kidney  pain.\"  A  12/5/95 \nM.D.  appointment  was  made  for  Plaintiff.  The  12/5/95  Plaintiff's  M  .  describes:  \"kidney  pain, \n1994  lithotripsy  at  LBJGH,  a  kidney  stone  was  found.....Kidney  stones  x  2yrs.  (See  12/5/95  MR \nNH \nentry  attached  as  Exhibit  14)  Plaintiff  had  been  with  kidney  and  back  pain  two-hundred  and \neighty-eight  (288)  days.  This  is  the  only  M.D.  appointment  since  Plaintiff's  first  admission  to  jail \non  2/22/95  that  a  urine  test  was  ordered  and  actually  performed  by  the  HCSD-MD.  (See  12/7/95 \nlab  results  attached  as  Exhibit  29)  This  test  accidentally  discovered  a  high  glucose  level  that  led  to \na  diabetes  diagnosis  on  12/7/95.  (See  12/7/95  M  R  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  15)  These  test  results \nhad  the  same  overshadowing  effect  as  in  other  serious  medical  conditions  described  in  this \ncomplaint  in  that  the  kidney  pain  complaint  was  forgotten  as  a  specific  issue  to  be  treated  by  the \nHCSD-MD  and  negligently   is  no  longer  mentioned  in  Plaintiff's  MR  as  late  as  the  6/4/96   MR  \nentry  and  at  which  time  Plaintiff  had  suffered  kidney  and  back  pain  for  over  fifteen  (15)  months. \n(H)  This  inadequate  medical  treatment  of  Plaintiffs  serious  kidney  condition  from \n2/22/95  to  7/12/96  by  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Phi,  Luu  and \nWilson  has  resulted  in  unnecessary  physical  suffering  of  Plaintiff for  a  period  of  over  fifteen  (15) \nmonths  through  an  ongoing  pattern  and  practice  of  arbitrary  and  capricious  discrimination  to  the \nPlaintiff  and  all  the  proximate  result  of  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice, \nPhi,  Luu  and  Wilson's  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  medical  needs  of  the  Plaintiff \namounting  to  the  infliction  of  unnecessary  pain  that  denied  him  due  process,  was  cruel  and \nunusual  punishment,  and  a  denial  of  equal  protection  under  the  law  that  resultted  in Plaintiff  being \nin  diminished  mental  and  debilitative  physical  states  of  health  for  seventeen  (17)  months  and \nduringn  which  time  Plaintiff  was  compelled  to  stand  federal  trial  in  Cause  No.  H-95-201  on \n12\n  \n                 \nNovember  29,  1995,  in  said  states  of  health;  and  all  of  the  foregoing  in  violation  of  Plaintiff's \nfederally  protected  rights  delineated  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs. \n()  |  HCSD-MD  TWO  WEEK  PHYSICAL  AND  MEDICALLY  R ESTRICTED \nUSE  OF  LEG  IRONS. \n1)  On  3/8/95,  and  while  Plaintiff  was  still  incorrectly  housed  by  the  HCSD \nClassification  Section  to  the  701  N.  San  Jacinto  Facility  (701  Facility),  he  was  given  a  mandatory \n\"two-week  physical\".  A  HCSD-MD  \"FE  istory  &  Physical  Examination\"  record  was  completed \n     \nand  signed  by  S.  O'Neall,  R.N.,  and  D.  Klein,  M.D.  which  states  as  a  written  medical  order  under \n\"Comments\"  (See  3/8/95  history  attached  as  Exhibit  56)  Bilateral  Achilles  tendons  surgery.  \"  '75 \n(cannot  wear  leg  irons  for  that  reason)...\"  In  1975  Plaintiff's  achilles  tendons  had  been  severed \nin  both  legs,  and  the  surgical  reattachment  left  the  tendons  short  and  tight  with  minimal  ankle \nrotation  leaving  Plaintiff  with  a  physical  orthopedic  disability  in  both  legs.  Any  contact  or \npressure  from  a  foreign  object  to  this  area  of  the  ankle  causes  pain,  bruising,  spraining,  and/or \ntemporary  loss  of  foot  control  and  impaired  coordination.  By  the  design  nature  and  use,  leg  irons \nwhen  used  on  Plaintiff,  falls  on  the  scar  lines  of  both  legs  and  the  use  of  leg  trons  is  painful  and \ncauses  tenderness,  soreness  and  partial  lameness  for  days  after  their  use.  Nurse  O'Neall  and  Dr. \nKlein  both  correctly  identified  the  physical  orthopedic  disability,  and  the  problems  that  it \npresented,  and  took  appropriate  and  timely  action  by  issuing  the  \"Medical  Restriction\"  on  the  use \nof  leg  irons  on  Plaintiff  as  an  attempt  at  accomodation.  Dr.  Klein  then  failed  to  fill  out  a  Special \nNeeds  Advisement  (SNA)  which  was  the  follow-up  step  in  the  HCSD-MD  policy,  procedure, \nprogram  or  plan  that  would  have  insured  that  the  security  personnel  did  not  use  the  leg  irons  on \nPlaintiff.  Dr.  Klein's  failure  to  follow-up  is  the  cause  of  Plaintiff  having  to  suffer  over  a  year  and \nthree  months  of  pain  from  the  use  of  the  leg  irons  and  the  deprivation  of  Plaintiff's  rights  and \nprivileges  as  a  prisoner  in  the  HCJ. \n2)  On  3/9/95  Plaintiff  was  transferred  back  to  the  HCJ  1301  facility  wearing  leg \nirons  and  was  placed  back  in  administrative  segregation  cellblock  5BS-09.  Since  the  implemen- \ntation  of  this  written  medical  restriction  on  the  use  of  leg  irons  on  3/8/95,  these  legally  given \nmedical  orders/instructions  have  been  deliberately  and  totally  disregarded  by  all  HCSD  personnel. \n                       \n     \n3)  In  support  of  this  part  of  the  complaint  the  Plaintiff  relates  the  following: \n(A)  On  5/12/95  Plaintiff  was  placed  in  leg  irons  by  HCSD  Deputy \nLewellen  and  taken  to  the  1301  facility  clinic  for  Plaintiff  to  receive  some  missed  medications.  At \nthe  clinic  Plaintiff  complained  to  Defendant  Dr.  Mark  Chassay,  HCSD-MD,  that  his  ankles  and \ntendons  were  swollen  from  the  medically  restricted  use  of  leg  irons.  Plaintiff  requested  Deputy \nin  Plaintiff's  MR  the  3/8/95  entry  on  the  F listory  &  Physical \nLewellen  to  ask  Dr.  Chassay  to  verif \nExamination  Record  wherein  Dr.  Klein  and  Nurse  O'Neall  had  given  and  signed  written \norders/instructions,  in  the  comment  section  that  the  leg  irons  were  not  to  be  used  on  Plaintiff. \nDeputy  Lewellen  made  the  request  and  Dr.  Chassay  and  defendent  K.  Howard,  LVN  and  J. \nLewis,  W.C.  briefly  and  indifferently  leafed  through  Plaintiff's  MR  and  because  of  their  negligence \nand  deliberate  indifference  overlooked  the  legitimate  entry  of  Dr.  Klein  and  Nurse  O'Neall  on \n3/8/95.  Dr.  Chassay  then  implied  to  Deputy  Lewellen  that  Plaintiff  was  trying  to  deceive  the \ndeputy.  Plaintiff  protested  that  he  was  telling  the  truth  and  had  personally  witnessed  the  written \ninstructions  of  3/8/95  and  the  signature  on  the  record  by  both  Dr.  Klein  and  Nurse  O'Neall. \nEvidence  of  the  ongoing  pattern  and  practice  of  deliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiff  is  here \ndemonstrated  in  that  Dr.  Chassay  did  not  need  the  medical  record  to  resolve  the  complaint.  As  a \nlicensed  physician  his  own  authority  allowed  him  to  issue  medical  orders,  restrictions,and  issue  a \nSpecial  Needs  Advisement.  Dr.  Chassay  having  Plaintiff  physically  present  needed  only  to \nexamine  Plaintiff's  ankles  and  thereby  resolve  the  issue  of  accomodation  of  the  orthopedic \ndisability.  In  total  apathy  to  Plaintiff's  needs,  Dr.  Chassay  without  any  examination  whatsoever, \ninstructed  Deputy  Lewellen  that  he  was  done  interviewing  Plaintiff’  Deputy  Lewellen  returned  the \nPlaintiff  to  cellblock  5B5  where  he  was  continually  subjected  to  the  painful  use  of  the  still \nmedically  restricted  use  of  leg  trons  for  the  next  one-year  and  three  months. \n(B)  On  5/22/95,  Plaintiff  requested  Deputy  David  Davis,  HCSD- \nClassification  that  the  use  of  leg  irons  be  discontinued.  Plaintiff  explained  to  Deputy  Davis  that \nthe  HCSD-MD  had  on  3/8/95  ordered  that  leg  irons  not  be  used  but  somehow  that  order  had  not \nmade  its  way  to  the  Jail  Division  Of \n‘icials.  Deputy  Davis  informed  Plaintiff  that  he  would  talk \n)  personnel  and  to  Sgt.  T.  Roshto,  HCSD-JD,  Fifth  floor  Supervisor  to  see  if  Sgt. \nRoshto  would  on  his  own  initiate  the  discontinuance  of  the  leg  irons.  Deputy  Davis  was \n14\n  \n                      \n        \nunsuccessful  and  the  use  of  leg  irons  was  enforced  against  the  medical  order/instructions  not  to \n1  Plaintiff. \nuse  them  on  the  disable \n4)  The  use  of leg  irons  continued  from  2/22/95  thru  4/17/96  as  demonstrated  by \ntwo  separate  letters  to  U.S.  Marshal  Al  Solis  from  Plaintiffs  attorney  Mr.  Thomas  Bevans  and \nwhich  are  respectively  dated  4/8/96  (See  4/8/96  Bevans  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  73)  and  4/17/96 \nSee  4/17/96  Bevans  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  74)  each  letter  shows  service  copy  to  U.S.  District \nJudge  Ewing  Werlein,  Jr;  Defendant  Tommy  Thomas,  Sheriff  Harris  County;  and  the  Plaintiff. \nThe  4/8/96  letter  enumerates  Plaintiff's  medical  complications  as:  (a)  diabetic  condition-problem \nwith  feet;  (b)  walking  with  cane  (while  wearing  leg  irons);  (c)  problems  with  achilles  tendon.  The \nBevans  letter  requests  the  accomodations  that  Plaintiff's  feet  not  be  shackled  and  that  the  attorney \nhimself  had  visually  observed  that  the  disabled  Plaintiff  was  compelled  to  wear  the  medically \nrestriced  leg  irons. \n5)  The  4/17/96  Bevans  letter  documents  that  the  HCSD-JD  had  been  deliberately \nindifferent  to  the  medical  need  of  the  disabled  Plaintiff,  even  after  being  put  on  notice  by  the \n4/8/96  Bevans  letter  by  continuing  to  cause  Plaintiffs  needless  suffering  and  the  wanton  infliction \nof  pain  and  the  deliberate  indifference  and  callous  disregard  of  Defendant  Sheriff  Tommy  Thomas \nto  deprive  Plaintiff  of  his  civil  rights.  This  insensibility  of  Sheriff  Thomas  and  Defendant  Major. \nK_S.  Berry,  HCSD,  and  Defendant  Major  M.  W.  Quinn  is  exemplified  in  a  4/15/96  letter  from \nMajor  Berry  to  Mr.  Bevans  that  shows  service  copy  to  Major  Quinn  and  states  that  Berry's  office \nwill  do  an  immediate  review  of  Plaintiff's  classification  and  medical  needs.  (See  4/15/96  Berry \nletter  attached  as  Exhibit  75)  The  MR  of  Plaintiff  shows  he  was  net  directly  seen  by  a  HCSD-MD \nphysician  from  3/19/96  to  6/4/96.  Plaintiff's  MR  validates  that  Sheriff  Thomas,  Major  Berry  and \nMajor  Quinn  took  no  actions  and  completely  ignored  the  Bevan's  letters  requests  for \naccomodation  and  for  medical  attention  of  4/8/96  and  4/17/96. \n6)  A  review  of  Plaintiff's  MR  and    a  comparison  of  HCSD-MD    policy,  procedure, \nprograms  or  plan  statements  indicate  the  primary  causative  factor  in  the\"state  of  confusion\" \nconcerning  the  use  of  leg  trons  is  traced  back  to  the  initial  History  and  Physical  Examination  of \n3/8/95.  Dr.  Klein  failed  to  \"follow-up\"  on  the  written  orders/instructions  under  the  comments \nsection  of  the  record  by  failing  to  take  the  next  HCSD-MD  procedural  step  of  filling  out  and \n[5\n  \n  \n              \n  \nsigning  a  form  M-172  \"Special  Needs  Advisement”.  (See  example  advisement  attached  as  Exhibit \n57)  The  SNA  was  specifically  created  to  serve  the  very  need  of  physical  relief  that  Plaintiff's \ncondition  required  and  which  Dr.  Klein  and  Nurse  O'Neall  readily  admitted  Plaintiff  needed.  Said \nfailure  of  Dr.  Klein  to  follow-up  with  this  accomodation  was  deliberately  indifferent  to  Plaintiff's \nserious  medical  needs  as  a  disabled  person  and  which  resulted  in  one-year  and  three-months  of \nneedless  suffering,  duress,  pain  and  injury  to  Plaintiff  by  his  being  forced  to  wear  the  admittedly \npainful  leg  irons. \n7)  The  foregoing  failure  by  Dr.  Klein  is  exacerbated  in  that  Plaintiff  did  seek  to \nredress  to  the  inadequate  medical  care  by  writing  an  informal  letter  to  Nurse  O'Neall  on  3/13/95. \n(See  3/13/95  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  66)  The  letter  stated  the  indifferent  attitude  of  Dr. \nChassay,  Nurse  Howard,  and  Ms.  Lewis  at  the  3/12/95  interview.  This  letter,  as  an  informal  link \nin  the  administrative  remedy  process  was  placed  in  plantiff's  MR  and  yet  no  SNA  form  was  filled \nout  concerning  the  leg  irons  for  accomodation  of  Plaintiff's  disabled  condition.  Plaintiffs  written \nplea  for  medical  assistance  was  deliberately  ignored  by  the  HCSD-MD  personnel  with  their  fuil \nknowledge  that  it  would  lead  to  needless  suffering  and  the  wanton  infliction  of  pain  to  the \ndisabled  Plaintiff. \n(J)  |  The  medically  restricted  use  of  leg  irons  by  the  HCSD-JD  from  3/8/95  to  6/4/96, \nand  for  fear  of  further  infliction  of  suffering,  pain,  and  injury  prevented  the  Plaintiff  from  attending \nthe  Inmate  Law  Library,  Church,  prayer  groups,  and  recreational  activities  as  afforded  and \nprovided  to  all  other  inmates  housed  in  Administrative  Segregation  cel \nblock  5B5.  Because  of \nthis  ongoing  pattern  and  practice  of  the  arbitrary  and  capricious  discrimination  the  Plaintiff  was \ncompelled  not  to  attend  any  Law  Library  period  or  recreational  activity  during  this  3/8/95  to \n6/4/96  period  of  incarceration.  The  HCJ  Administrations  physically  forced  this  deprivation  of \nPlaintiff's  civil  rights  through  physical  duress  of  the  Plaintiff  that  kept  him  continuously \nincarcerated  twenty-four  (24)  hours  a  day  for  over  a  year  period  in  Administrative  Segregation \nwith  the  exceptions  of  attorney  visits,  clinic  appointments  and  court  appearances  he  was \ncompelled  to  attend.  The  mental  duress,  suffering,  pain  and  injury  to  Plaintiff  by  the  use  of  the \nmedically  restricted  leg  irons  from  3/8/95  in  the  HCSD-JD  was  the  proximate  result  of \nDefendants,  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Quinn,  Seale,  Klein  and  Chassay's  egregrious  failure  to  take  the \n16\n        \n  \nnecessary  steps  to  adequately  protect  the  disabled  Plaintiff  from  discrimination  due  to  his  disability \nand  from  harm,  suffering,  pain,  injury,  or  the  reasonable  fear  thereof,  after  having  been  put  on \nnotice  in  writing  by  the  Plaintiff  in  his  MR  and  by  Plaintiff's  attorney's  written  notice  that \nsuffering,  physical  pain  and  injury  was  befalling  the  Plaintiff  and  their  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nserious  medical  needs,  civil  rights,  and  personal  safety  of  the  Plaintiff  and  was  the  direct  result  of \na  pattern  and  practice  of  not  following  up  on  written  medical  orders/instructions  by  incompetent \nmedical  personnel,  the  maintenance  of  inadequate  HCSD-MD  policies,  procedures,  programs  or \nplans  to  ensure  that  medical  orders/insturctions  are  followed  up  on  by  medical  and  security \npersonnel.  These  described  circumstances  and  conditions  were  deliberately  and  knowingly \nmaintained  by  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Quinn,  Seale,  Klein  and  Chassay,  and  in  total \ncallous  desregard  of  and  deliberate  indifference  to  the  well  being,  personal  safety,  serious  medical \nneeds  and  rights  of  the  disabled  Plaintiff  thereby  subjecting  him,  or  causing  him  to  be  subjected  to \nthe  prohibition  of  the  free  exercise  of  religion  and  to  the  unnecessary  and  wanton  infliction  of \npain  that  denied  him  due  process,  was  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  a  denial  of  equal \nprotection  of  the  law  that  resulted  in  Plaintiff  being  in  a  debilitative  physical  state  of  health  for \nfifteen  (15)  months  and  during  which  time  Plaintiff  was  compelled  to  stand  federal  trial  in  Cause \n N o.  H-95-201  on  November  29,  1995,  in  said    state  of  health;  and  all  of  the  foregoing  in  violation \nof  Plaintiff's  nghts  as  delineated  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs. \n(K)  SEIZURE  DISORDER  -  MEDICAL  NEGLECT  AND  MEDICAL \nOn  2/22/95  Ms.  C.  Ware,  LVN,  placed  a  HCSD-MD  Special  Need  Treatment  Plan \n(SNTP)  for  a  seizure  disorder  in  the  Plaintiff's  MR.  (See  2/22/95  SNTP  attached  as  Exhibit  54) \nThe  SNTP  lays  out  the  medical  criteria  for  the  treament  of  inmate/patients  who  have  seizure \ndisorders  such  as  Plaintiff's  epilepsy.  In  these  terms  the  SNTP  states  the  HCSD-MD  goals  was  to \nkeep  Plaintiff  seizure  free  as  possible  through  the  medications  Dilantin(phenytoin)  and \nPhenobarbital,  that  the  type  and  frequency  of  diagnostic  testing  would  be  blood  tests  every  three \n(3)  months  to  check  the  levels  of  Dilantin/Phenobarbital,  and  that  the  frequency  of  follow  up \nevery  three  (3)  months  to  check  the  effectiveness  of  medications  and \n17\n  \n          \n  \npossible  adjustment  to  plans.  The  SNTP  is  clear  and  concise  that  the  HCSD-MD  knew  the  correct \nand  prescribed  procedure  to  treat  Plaintiffs  seizure  disorder.  In  Plaintiff's  case  to  reach  the  SNTP \ngoal  of  keeping  Plaintiff  seizure  free  as  possible  there  were  in  Plaintiff's  case  three  separate  and \ndistinct  steps  for  medical  personnel  to  follow  and    that  was  medication;    diagnostic  testing;  and  the \nadjustment  of  treatment  modality  based  on  diagnostic  testing  of  the  seizure  medications  found  to \nbe  in  Plaintiff's  blood. \n(L)  MEDICATION \nDuring  Plaintiff's  incarceration  in  the  HCJ  as  a  disabled  federal  prisoner  he  sought  every \navailable  avenue  of  administrative  relief  to  his  obtaining  the  proper  doses  of  the  prescribed  seizure \ndisorder  medications  Dilantin  and  Phenobarbital.  Seizure  disorder  medications  are  considered \nICSD-MD  nurses,  commonly \n\"controlled  medications”  by  the  HCSD-MD  and  are  dispensed  by       \nreferred  to  as  \"Med  Cart  Nurses\",  on  two  regulated  A.M.  and  P.M.  rounds  to  the  cell  blocks \nlocated  on  each  of the  inmate  housing  floors  of  the  HCJ.  The  nurses  have  a  rolling  medical  cart \n(med  cart)  that  they  bring  from  the  1301  facility  clinic  to  the  respective  inmate  housing  floors. \nThe  cellblocks  are  broken  into  four  (4)  alphabetically  designated  quads  A-D.  Each  quad  is  broken \nup  into  cellblocks  numbered  1-6.  On  each  cellblock  and/or  cell  the  respective  location  letters  and \nnumbers  are  printed  in  characters  ten  inches  (10\")  tall  and  are  clearly  visible  and  easy  to  read. \nOnce  on  the  desired  floor,  in  the  correct  quad,  and  at  the  right  cellblock  and  cell  the  N  fed  Cart \nNurse  then  refers  to  a  Medication  Administration  Record  (MAR)  that  is  set  up  by  location  and \nwhich  has  each  individual  inmates  name,  number,  type  drug  to  be  dispensed  and  time  to  be \ndispensed.  (See  MAR  example  attached  as  Exhibits  33-47).  The  MAR  is  designed  that  it  shows \nthe  chronological  order  of  delivery  of  the  controlled  medications  in  the  month,  day  and  A.M.  and \nP.M.  delivery  schedules  as  prescribed  by  the  HCSD-MD  Physicians.  Ifa  particular  dispensation \nof  controlled  med  i cations  is  made  to  the  respective  inmate  then  the  Med  Cart  Nurse  places  his/her \ninitials  in  the  corresponding  box  for  date,  day  and  A.M.  or  P.M.  delivery.  If  dispensation  was  not \nmade  then  the  nurse  either  initials  the  corresponding  box  and  draws  a  circle  around  the  initials,  or \nwrites  \"no\"  and/or  leaves  the  box  unmarked  altogether.  The  MAR  system  is  part  of  the  HCSD- \nMD  policy,  procedure,  program  or  plan  to  track  and  monitor  the  dispensation  of  ordered \nprescription  medications  to  inmates  and  also  for  use  in  keeping  a  record  in  the  inmates  MR  of  all \n18\n                    \nprevious  months  that  controlled  medications  have  been  dispensed.  The  MAR  also  serves  the \nHCSD-MD  Physicians  in  ascertaining  if  his/her  patients  are  receiving  the  proper  amount  of \nmedications. \n(M) \nA  review  of  the  MAR  in  Plaintiff's  }  R  reflect  that  from  02/22/95  to  03/01/96  Plaintiff  did \nnot  receive  the  prescribed  seizure  medication  doses  for  approximately  one  hundred  and  eighty \n(180)  of  the  total  amount  of  doses  ordered  by  the  HCSD-MD  Physicians.  (See  MAR  attached  as \nExhibits  33-47.)  The  MAR  was  indicating  the  inconsistency  in  dispensation  by  the  HCSD-MD \nMed  Cart  Nurses.  The  HCSD-MD  Medical  personnel  were  not  doing  the  customary  follow-up  by \nreviewing  what  the  MAR  was  clearly  indicating  to  all  the  physicians  and  nurses  who  reviewed \nPlaintiff's  MR.  Plaintiff  as  previously  noted  in  this  complaint  on  the  use  of  medically  restricted  leg \nirons,  and  for  that  reason  at  all  times  in  this  complaint,  was  easy  to  locate  within  the  HCJ  1301 \nFacility.  The  use  of  leg  irons  prohibited  Plaintiff  from  attending  all  jail  activities  except  for  the \ncompelled  clinic  and  court  appearances.  Even  for  the  compelled  appearances  the  HCSD-MD \npolicy,  procedure,  program  and  plans  provided  that  Plaintiff  was  to  receive  the  seizure  disorder \nmedication.  At  no  time  during  Plaintiff's  incarceration  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96  is  there  a  reason \nor  excuse  why  the  HCSD-MD  }  led  Cart  Nurses  to  not  have  dispensed  to  Plaintiff  the  daily \nprescribed  A.M.  and  P.M.  seizure  disorder  medications  as  provided  under  the  SNTP  for  seizure \ndisorders. \n(N) \nPursuant  to  the  SNTP  the  second  distinct  step  for  the  HCSD-MD  in  the  \"short  and  long \nterm  goals\"  of  keeping  Plaintiff  as  seizure  free  as  possible  is  the  objective  of  the  type  and \nfrequency  of  diagnostic  testing  to  assure  proper  medication  levels  which  is  accomplished  by  blood \ntests  of Plaintiff  at  intervals  of  three  (3)  months.  In  Plaintiff's  particular  case  the  drugs  being  tested \nfor  are  Phenobarbital  and  Phenytoin  (Dilantin).  The  blood  test  itself  is  a  uniform  procedure  used \nin  general  medicine.  A  small  amount  of  blood  is  drawn  from  Plaintiff  and  then  tested  for  the \nPhenobarbital  and  Phenytoin  (P/P)  levels  found  in  the  sample.  The  tests  are  then  reported  in \nwriting  on  a  HCSD-MD  Laboratory  (lab)  Results  form  under  the  Therapuetic  Drugs  column.  The \n19\n  \n  \n              \nnormal  ranges  are  numerically  15-40  for  Phenobarbital  and  10-20  for  Phenytoin  and  are  printed \non  the  form  near  each  respective  drug.  (See  lab  results  attached  as  Exhibits  22-28)  When  lab \ntechnicians  get  a  test  result  the  numerical  value  is  written  on  the  provided  line  for  each  respective \ndrug  tested.  Since  the  normal  value  ranges  are  printed  adjacent  to  each  respective  therapuetic \ndrug,  the  Lab  Technician  can  tell  at  a  glance  whether  the  respective  therapuetic  drug  level  is  low, \nnormal,  or  high.  Any  value  outside  the  normal  range  is  commonly  referred  to  as  a  \"panic  level\" \nand  is  supposed  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  attending  physician.  By  keeping  the  P/P  levels  in  the \nnomal  ranges  then  would  in  effect  meet  the  SNTP  goals  of  helping  to  keep  Plaintiff  as  seizure  free \nas  possible. \n(O)  LAB  RESULTS.  1)  On  3/30/95,  Lab  Results  #1571  and  #1572  showed  that \nPlaintiff's  P/P  levels  were  low  enough  for  HCSD-MD  Medical  Director  Dr.  Mike  Seale  to  make \nthe  3/31/95  notation  on  the  Lab  form  that  states,  \"Refer  (Plaintiff)  to  M.D.  (medical  doctor).\" \n(See  3/30/95  Lab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  22)  Twelve  (12)  days  later  on  4/12/95,  J.  Fryer, \nW.C.,  set  an  appointment  for  Plaintiff  for  4/19/95,  per  Dr.  Seale's  request  and  notes  \"(See  Lab \nForm)\"  as  the  reason  for  the  appointment.  (See  4/12/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  4)  The \n4/19/95  M.D.  appointment  was  not  kept  by  the  HCSD-MD.  On  4/14/95,  Fryer  set  another \nappointment  in  place  of  the  foregoing  for  4/21/95  and  this  M.D.  appointment  was  also  not  kept  by \nthe  HCSD-MD,  and  in  deliberate  indifference  to  plainiff's  serious  medical  needs,  and  in  violation \nof  the  HCSD-MD  prescribed  SNTP  for  seizure  disorders,  the  HCSD-MD  completely  dropped  any \nfurther  attempts  at  following-up  on  the  Medical  Directors  orders  to  see  that  Plaintiff  was \nmedically  interviewed  by  a  HCSD-MD  Physician  for  the  low  P/P  levels.  2)  On  6/2/95,  and  over \ntwo  months  after  the  first  P/P  levels,  Lab  Results  #3128  and  #3129  showed  that  Plaintiffs  P/P \n  \nlevels  were  still  low  enough  for  Dr.  Seale  to  make  the  6/7/95  notation  on  the  Lab  form,  \"refer  to \nM.D.\"  (See  6/2/95  Lab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  23)  On  6/8/95,  J.  Lewis,  W.C.,  set  an \nappointment  for  Plaintiff  to  see  an  M.D.  on  6/19/95.  (See  6/8/95  N  X  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  7) \nThe  6/19/95  M.D.  appointment  was  not  kept  by  the  HCSD-MD.  On  6/13/95,  J.  Fryer,  W.C.  set \nan  appointment  for  Plaintiff  to  see  an  M.D.  on  6/20/95  at  the  request  of  Dr.  Seale  and  cites,  \" \n(See  Lab  form)\"  as  the  reference  for  the  M.D.  appointment.  (See  6/13/95  MR  entry  attached  as \nExhibit  8)  The  6/20/95  M.D.  appointment  was  not  kept  by  the  HCSD-MD  in  deliberate \n20\n           \n  \n  \n  \nindifference  to Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs  and  in  violation  of  the  HCSD-MD  prescribed \nSNTP  for  seizure  disorders,  the  HCSD-MD  completely  dropped  any  further  attempts  to  follow- \nup  on  the  Medical  Director's  second  order  to  have  Plaintiff  seen  by  a  doctor  for  the  low  P/P \nlevels.  These  Lab  Results  document  that  the  HCSD-MD  knew  beyond  a  doubt  that  Plaintiff's \nseizure  disorder  medication  levels  had  been  in  the  low  panic  range  for  nearly  three  months  and  yet \ntook  no  action  to  get  Plaintiff  to  an  M.D.  3)  On  7/7/95,  Lab  Results  #3128  and  #3129  showed  _ \nthat  Plaintiff's  P/P  levels  were  still  low  enough  for  Dr.  Seale  to  make  the  7/11/95  notation  on  the \nLab  Form,  “Refer  to  M.D.\"  (See  7/7/95  Lab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  24)  The  Lab  Form \nshows  a  handwritten  notation  by  R.  Washington,  W.C.,  that  an  appointment  had  been  scheduled \nbut  failed  to  enter  the  reason  of  the  appointment  into  Plaintiff's  MR. \nfor  Plaintiff  for  7/18/95, \nEleven  (11)  days  later  on  7/18/95,  Washington  was  unable  to  relate  to  the  M.D.  who  saw  Plaintiff \nwhat  the  appointment  was  originally  scheduled  for.  Plaintiff  at  this  time  was  not  privileged  to  any \nof  his  V  R  or  Lab  Results  and  so  could  not  inform  the  M.D.  of  why  Dr.  Seales  wanted  the  doctor \n'.  There  is  no  mention  of  the  low  P/P  Lab  Results  documented  in  Plaintiffs  MR \nto  see  the  Plainti \nthat  date.  (See  7/18/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  9)  On  10/27/95  Lab  Results  #4938  and \n#4939  showed  that  Plaintiff's  P/P  levels  were  low  enough  for  Dr.  Seale  to  make  the  10/30/95 \nnotation  on  the  Lab  Form,  \"Refer  to  MD\"  (See  10/27/95  Lab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  25) \nThis  is  the  fourth  and  last  attempt  by  Medical  Director  Dr.  Seale  to  have  Plaintiff  seen  by  a \nHCSD-MD  Physician  for  the  low  P/P  levels,  which  have  now  been  documented  as  low  for \napproximately  eight  (8)  months.  On  10/31/95,  J.  Fryer,  W.C.  set  an  M.D.  appointment  for \nPlaintiff  at  Dr.  Seale's  request  for  11/3/95.  (See  11/3/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  12)  On \n11/3/95  J.  Lewis,  W.C.  documents  calling  the  Fifth  Floor  of  the  HCJ  three  (3)  times  to  have \nPlaintiff  brought  to  the  1301  Facility  Clinic,  but  the  HCSD  Deputies  would  not  bring  Plaintiff  to \nthe  clinic  and  so  she  reset  the  appointment  to  11/6/95.  (See  11/3/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit \n12)  5)  On  11/6/95  after  four  (4)  attempts  in  eight  (8)  months  the  Plaintiff  was  interviewed  by \nDefendant  Dr.  Luu  for  his  low  levels  of  the  P/P  seizure  disorder  medications.  Plaintiff  explained  - \nto  Dr.  Luu  that  he  was  not  being  dispensed  a  large  part  of  the  seizure  disorder  medications  by  the \nHCSD-MD  Med  Cart  Nurses.  Dr.  Luu  confirmed  in  the  MA  .  that  Plaintiff  was  telling  the  truth \nby  looking  at  only  one  (1)  page  of  the  MAR.  In  an  unethical  attempt  to  breakthrough  the \n21\n          \n  \nincompetency  of  the  Med  Cart  Nurses,  Dr.  Luu  nearly  doubled  the  doses  of  seizure  disorder \nmedications.  (See  11/6/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  12)  On  11/8/95  Dr.  Luu  ordered  Lab \nResults  #5132  to  ascertain  the  P/P  levels  of  the  \"double  dose  treatment  technique.\"  (See  11/8/95 \nLab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  26)  Dr.  Luu  failed  to  take  into  consideration  that  at  the  time  of \nthe  11/6/95  prescription  that  the  HCSD-MD  had  a  policy,  procedure,  program  or  plan  that  filled \n\"new\"  prescriptions  after  two  (2)  days.  Thus  the  12/8/95  Lab  test  came  before  the  new  double \ndose  prescription  had  started.  Dr.  Luu  nor  Dr.  Seale  made  any  notations  on  the  Lab  form \nconcerning  the  11/8/95  Lal  Results.  6)  On  1/10/96  Lab  Results  #184,  #185  showed  that \nPlaintiffs  P/P  levels  were  low.  Dr.  Guice  initials  the  Lab  Results.  (See  1/10/96  Lab  Results \nattached  as  Exhibit  27)  Dr.  Guice  notes  the  levels  in  Plaintiffs  MR  and  orders  a  repeat  test.  (See \n1/19/96  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  18)  Plaintiff  was  not  interviewed  by  Dr.  Guice  on  this \nmatter  of  the  consistently  low  P/P  levels  of  Plaintiff.  7)  On  1/30/96  Lab  Results  #540,  #541 \nshowed  that  Plaintiff's  P/P  levels  were  low  and  Dr.  Guice  initials  the  results  but  makes  no  entry \ninto  the  Plaintiffs  MR  concerning  the  test.  (See  1/30/96  Lab  Results  attached  as  Exhibit  28) \nPlaintiff's  MR  documents  seven  (7)  blood  tests  taken  to  determine  the  proper  P/P  levels  and  all \ntests  showed  low  results  and  outside  the  normal  range.  For  approximately  seven  (7)  months  the \nPlaintiff's   { R  reflects  that   M edical  Director  Dr.  Seale  was  ordering  M.D.  appointments  for \nPlaintiff's  serious  medical  condition.  Through  incompetence  and  negligence,  the  HC  SD-MD \nMedical  personnel  assigned  this  duty  failed  to  make  the  follow-up  on  Dr.  Seale's  orders.  This \ndeprivation  of  the  doctor  ordered  appointments  through  deliberate  indifference  and  callous \ndisregard  brought  about  the  continuing  unnecessary  suffering,  wanton  infliction  of  pain  and  injury \nto  Plaintiff  through  the  continuing  pattern  and  practice  of  the  denial  of  adequate  medical  attention \nof  the  HCSD-MD  Med  Cart  Nurses  not  consistently  dispensing  the  prescribed  seizure  disorder \nmedication.  Had  any  of  the  many  missed  M.D.  appointments  been  kept  Plaintiff's  deprivation  of \nthe  prescribed  medication  could  have  come  to  light  and  thus  a  remedy  to  the  problem  could  have \nbeen  effected  by  the  HCSD-MD. \n(P)  ADJUSTMENT  OF  MODALITY.  The  HCSD-MD  was  not  monitoring  the \nMAR  nor  following  through  with  follow-up  medical  evaluations  even  when  confronted  with  the \nlab  result  of  the  Diagnostic  Testing  that  indicated  Plaintiff's  blood  levels  of  P/P  to  be  in  the  low \n22\n        \n  \npanic  range  for  one  year  in  Plaintiff's  case  and  therefore  there  could  not  have  been  any \n\"Adjustment  of  Treatment  Modality\"  by  the  HCSD-MD. \n(Q)  In  all  three  major  areas  of  the  HCSD-MD  SNTP  for  seizure  disorders  in  Plaintiff's \ninstant  case,  the  HCSD-MD  failed  through  incompetence,  negligence  and  deliberate  indifference \nto  Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs  to  see  that  Plaintiff  as  a  disabled  person:  (a)  received  the \nproper  amount  of  seizure  disorder  medication  at  the  proper  time;  (b)  that  proper  diagnostic \ntesting  was  performed  on  Plaintiff  with  the  proper  follow-up  on  any  abnormal  test  results;  and  (c) \nand  to  make  the  necessary  adjustment  in  Plaintiff's  treatment  modality  once  the  low  blood  test \nresults  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  HCSD-MD  Med  Cart  Nurses  were  being  derelict  in  their \nofficial  medical  duties.  Plaintiff's  MR  documents  daily  seizure  activity.  (See  MR  entries  4/3/95 \nattached  as  Exhibit  3;  6/9/95  attached  as  Exhibit  8;  2/8/96  attached  as  Exhibit  19)  Daily  seizure \nactivity  can  be  directly  contributable  to  the  HCSD-MD  not  following  the  HCSD-!  AD  SNTP  for \nSeizure  Disorders.  The  mental  duress  suffered  and  the  physical  pain  and  injury  that  has  befallen \nPlaintiff  by  the  HCSD-MD's  failure  to  follow  the  SNTP  from  2/22/95  to  7/12/96,  was  the \nproximate  result  of  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Howard,  Phi  and \nLuu's  egregious  failure  to  follow  the  implemented  steps  and  safeguards  as  provided  for  in  the \nHCSD-) MD  SNTP  for  Seizure  Disorders.  This  caused  any  and  all  excessive  amounts  of  seizure \nactivity  for  over  one  (1)  year  in  the  HCJ  and  was  the  proximate  result  of  Defendant's  T.  Thomas, \nBerry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Phi  and  Luu’s  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  medical \nneeds  of  the  Plaintiff  amounting  to  the  infliction  of  unnecessary  pain  and  and  suffereing  that \ndenied  him  due  process,  was  cruel  and  unusual  punishment  and  a  denial  of  equal  protection  of  the \nlaw  that  resulted  in  Plaintiff  being  in  diminished  mental  and  debilitative  physical  states  of  health \nfor  over  one  (1)  year  and  during  which  time  Plaintiff  was  compelled  to  stand  federal  trial  in  Cause \nNo.  H-95-201  on  November  29,  1995,  in  said  states  of  health;  and  all  of  the  foregoing  in  violation \nof  Plaintiff's  federally  protected  rights  as  delineated  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs. \n(R)  HERPES  MISDIAGNOSIS/DIABETES  DIAGNOSIS  1)  On  2/22/95  when \nthe  Plaintiff  was  admitted  to  the  HCJ  he  was  initially  interviewed  by  the  HCSD-MD  and  referred \nto  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff  for  Dysuria,  Renal  Calculi,  and  complaints  of  extreme  back  pain  in \nPlaintiff's  mid-back  radiating  to  the  groin.  (See  2/22/95  MR  entries  attached  as  Exhibits  1,50,51) \n23\n  \n        \nAfter  a  deliberately  indifferent  interview  by  the  LBJGH  Urology  Staff,  Plaintiff  was  returned  to \nthe  HCSD-MD,  where  complaints  of  physical  pain  and  discomfort  were  treated  with  deliberate \nindifference.  He  was  medically  cleared  to  be  indifferently  housed  by  HCSD-JD  Classification \nSection  Deputies  in  Administrative  cellblock  5B5-09.  2)  On  3/8/95  the  two-week  physical \nexamination  was  performed  on  Plaintiff  and  because  Plaintiff  had  lost  a  large  part  of  his  vision,  it \nis  noted  on  the  History  and  Examination  Record  that  Plaintiff  was  having  trouble  with  his  vision \nand  needed  to  see  an  Optometrist.  (See  3/8/95  History  attached  as  Exhibit  56)  3)  The  3/30/95 \nPlaintiffs  M  .  described  that  Plaintiff  had  sores  and  a  skin  rash  that  would  not  heal.  (See  3/30/95 \nMR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  2)  It  was  also  stated  by  Plaintiff  that  he  was  still  having  trouble \nwith  his  vision  this  date.  4)  The  4/3/95  Plaintiff's  MR  describes  sores  that  won't  heal;  muscle \naches;  and  chronic  kidney  stones.  Dr.  Guice,  from  a  mere  visual  observation,  diagnosed  the \nunhealing  open  sores  as  \"Herpes.\"  Dr.  Guice  writes  some  prescriptions  and  ends  the  interview \n l  ow-up  orders  for  diagnostic  testing  to  verify  if  the  sores/rash  was  in  fact  Herpes. \nwith  no  other  fo \n(See  4/3/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  3)  5)  The  4/14/95  Plaintiffs  MR  describes:  \"herpes \ngetting  worse;  states  sores  worse  and  dysuria.\"  Dr.  Trinh  notes:  \"Here  for  gential  lesions, \ntreated  for  herpes”  and  offers  the  second  opinion  based  solely  on  visual  observation,  that  the \ncondition  is  a  \"probable  chancroid.\"  Dr.  Trinh  orders  some  medications  and  ends  the  interview \nwith  no  follow-up  orders  for  diagnostic  testing  to  determine  what  these  sores/rash  of  nearly  a  two \n(2)  month  duration  are.  (See  4/14/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  5)  The  4/19/95  Plaintiff's  MR \ndescribes:  \"Groin  lesion  appears  unchanged.\"  Dr.  Guice  orders  some  medications  but  makes  no \nother  follow-up  orders  for  diagnostic  tests  to  determine  what  these  sores/rash  of  two  (2)  months \nare.  (See  4/19/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  6)  6)  On  or  about  8/15/95,  Reverend  Ronald \nCloutier,  HCSD  Catholic  Chaplain  made  his  first  attempt  to  obtain  adequate  medical  attention  for \nthe  Plaintiff  with  the  HCSD-N  [D,  due  to  the  overall  appearance  of  Plaintiff  with  sores  that  would \nnot  heal  and  a  physical  state  that  was  indicative  of  declining  health.  The  HCSD-MD  did  not  heed \nhis  request  for  Plaintiff's  N  .  1s  silent  to  any  action  taken  on  behalf  of  Plaintiff  by  the  HCSD-MD \nthat  date.  7)  The  8/28/95  Plaintiffs  MR  describes:  \"Swollen  glands;  states  he  has  swollen \nglands  for  months;  painful  urination;  left  side  of  testicles  swollen,  reddish.\"  The  doctor  notes: \n“swelling;  dysuria\"  and  orders  some  medications  but  makes  no  other  follow-up  orders  for \n24\n             \n     \niagnostic  testing  to  determine  the  cause  of  the  swollen  glands,  sores  and  dysuria,  which  has  now \nbeen  documented  in  the  Plaintiff's  MR  for  over  half  a  year.  (See  8/28/95  MR  entry  attached  as \nExhibit  10)  The  9/26/95  Plaintiff's  N  .  describes:  \"swollen  testicles;  open  sores  on  scrotal  sac; \nalso  nm.  (numerous)  open  sores\"  and  makes  a  third  guess  diagnosis  that  this  condition  is \n\"epididimitis.\"  The  doctor  prescribes  some  medications  but  makes  no  follow-up  orders  for \ndiagnostic  tests  to  determine  what  is  causing  the  eight  (8)  month  long  condition  of  open  sores  that \nwill  not  heal.  (See  9/26/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  11)  8)  On  or  about  10/02/95,  Rev. \nRonald  Cloutier  made  a  second  attempt  to  obtain  treatment  for  Plaintiff's  debilitated  condition  of \nopen  sores;  loss  of  vision  and  other  symptoms  that  needed  immediate  medical  attention  from  the \nHCSD-MD.  Rev.  Cloutier  was  unsuccessful  in  getting  the  HCSD-MD  to  treat  Plaintiff's  serious \nmedical  needs,  for  Plaintiff's  MR  1s  silent  this  date  to  any  medical  help  betng  forthcoming  to  the \nPlaintiff  from  the  HCSD-MD  that  month.  9)  The  11/27/95  Plaintiffs  MR  describes:  \"Kidney \npain\"  which  led  to  the  12/05/95  appointment  with  Dr.  Guice  who  describes  in  Plaintiff's  MR: \n\"Kidney  pain;  kidney  stones;  overweight\"  and  orders  some  medications  and  for  the  first  time  in \nnine  months  of  complaints,  orders  a  common  urine  test.  (See  11/27/95  and  12/5/95  MR  entries \nattached  as  Exhibit  14)  The  Plaintiff's  MR  indicates  the  Urine  Test  Results  were  returned  to  Dr. \nGuice  on  12/7/95  with  the  glucose  at  336,  when  the  normal  range  was  60-110.  (See  12/7/95  Lab \nResults  attached  as  Exhibit  29)  10)  The  12/7/95  Plaintiff's  MR  describes  that  Plaintiff  was \nbrought  to  the  1301  Facility  Clinic  based  on  the  discovery  of  the  high  glucose  level.  Dr.  Guice \nnon  glucose  test  of  a  \"finger  stick\"  performed  on  Plaintiff  which  showed  a  high  of \n     \n380  which  1s  nearly  three  (3)  times  the  normal  level.  Dr.  Guice  then  told  Plaintiff  he  was  a \ndiabetic  and  ordered  some  medications,  other  follow-up  tests  and  a  diabetic  diet  for  Plaintiff.  (See \n2/7/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibits  15,16)  Subsequent  treatment  with  diabetic  medications \nresulted  in  the  sores  on  Plaintiff's  body  disappearing,  his  glands  became  unswollen,  part  of  his \nvision  returned,  the  thirst  for  liquids  and  dysuria  came  under  better  control. \n(S)  TREATOMF DEIANBETTES   1)  On  12/7/95,  Dr.  Guice  informed  Plaintiff  that \nthe  HCSD-MD  would  perform  regular  glucose  testing  on  Plaintiff  to  monitor  glucose  levels  in  the \nPlaintiff's  blood.  From  12/7/95  to  7/12/96  only  two  such  tests  were  performed.  (See  12/8/95 \nglucose  test  attached  as  Exhibit  30  and  /6/96  glucose  test  attached  as  Exhibit  31)  2)  Dr.  Guice \n25\n                \n     \nalso  informed  Plaintiff  that  the  HCSD-  MD  would  see  that  Plaintiff  was  placed  on  a  diabetic  diet. \nOn  12/19/95  Plaintiffs  MR  describes  an  interview  with  Ms.  C.  Nichols,  R.D./L.D.  wherin  Plaintiff \nwas  placed  on  a  diabetic  diet.  (See  12/19/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibits  16,17)  From \n12/19/95  to  7/12/96  Plaintiff's  diabetic  diet  was  sporadically  delivered  to  Administrative \nSegregation  cellblock  5B5-01.  Plaintiff  was  compelled  by  HCSD  Deputies  to  accept  a  regular \nmain  line  diet  when  his  diabetic diet  was  not  forthcoming  to  the  fifth  floor  of  the  HCJ  1301 \nFacility.  On  3/20/96  Plaintiff  wrote  a  letter  to  Ms.  Nichols  seeking  administrative  relief  in \nobtaining  his  ordered  diabetic  diet.  There  was  no  response  to  Plaintiff  from  Ms.  Nichols  office. \n3)  Plaintiff's  attorney,  Mr.  Thomas  Bevans,  directed  a  4/17/96  letter  to  U.S.  Marshal,  Al  Solis \nwith  service  copy  to  Sheriff  Thommy  Thomas.  This  letter  addressed  the  overall  continuing  decline \nof  Plaintiff's  general  health  but  was  never  answered  by  the  HCSD-Administration.  (See  4/17/96 \nBevans  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  74)  4)  On  6/4/96,  in  an  interview  at  the  1301  Facility  Clinic, \nPlaintiff  stated  to  Medical  Director,  Dr.  Mike  Seale  since  the  diagnosis  of  diabetes  on  2/7/95  that \nsubsequently  a  medically  needed  diabetic  diet  had  been  ordered  but  the  full  benefits  of  the  diet  had \nnot  been  realized,  as  often  diet  trays  were  not  delivered  and/or  scheduled  sandwiches  and  milk \nwere  stolen  by  inmate  floor  workers  and  that  the  HCSD  Deputies  of the  fifth  floor  of  the  HCJ \n1301  Facility  were  apathetic  and  did  not  intervene  in  such  thefts  or  provide  proper  supervision \nover  meal  distribution  to  the  inmates  housed  in  Administrative  Segregation  cellblock  5B5-01.  Dr. \nSeale  asked  Plaintiff  had  a  grievance  been  filed  in  the  matter  and  Plaintiff  produced  the  3/20/96 \nletter  directed  to  Ms.  C.  Nichols,  R.D./L.D.  and  which  was  referenced  \"Dietary  needs  not  being \nmet  by  HCSD.\"  Dr.  Seale  said  that  the  Nichols  letter  (written  two  months  prior)  had  as  yet \ncrossed  his  desk.  Dr.  Seale  suggested  to  Plaintiff  to  file  a  grievance  on  the  matter  for  the \npreparation  and  delivery  of  diets  was  beyond  his  control. \n(T)  The  causative  factors  in  Plaintiff's  misdiagnosis  of  Herpes  and  the  resultant \nsuffering  with  uncontrolled  diabetes  for  over  nine  (9)  months  are  1)  The  failure  of  the  HCSD-MD \nto  set  and  keep  scheduled  medical  doctor  appointments  with  Plaintiff,  2)  The  failure  of  the \nHCSD-MbD  to  follow  policy,  program,  procedure  or  plans  in  the  treatment  of  open  wounds  and \nsores  that  will  not  heal  as  was  in  Plaintiff's  case;  3)  The  failure  of  the  HCSD-MD  physicians  of \nupon  seeing  the  open  sores/rash  that  would  not  heal  that  was  accompanied  by  chronic  swollen \n26\n  \n  \nglands  to  order  diagnostic  testing  or  to  have  referred  Plaintiff  to  a  hospital  in  the  HCHD  to \ndetermine  the  cause  of  these  symptoms;  4)  The  failure  of  the  HCSD-MD  physicians  to  order  any \nfollow-up  treatment  for  Plaintiff's  disease  of  a  nine  (9)  month  duration,  such  as  appointments  to \nsee  if  the  chronic  condition  had  come  under  control  due  to  the  effectiveness  of  their  last  medical \norders  and  respective  treatment  plans;  5)  The  failure  of  the  HCSD-MD  physicians  to  adequately \nread  Plaintiff's  MR  and  note  that  the  unhealed  open  sores  had  plagued  Plaintiff  for  months  and \nhad  been  visually  misdiagnosed  three  separate  times  (Herpes,  Chancroids,  Epiditimitis)  and  to \nthereby  have  ordered  lab  tests  in  a  timely  manner;  6)  The  failure  of  the  HCSD-MD  physicians, \ndue  to  all  the  foregoing,  to  properly  diagnose  one  of  the  most  common  diseases  of  diabetes, \nespecially  in  the  light  of  all  the  symptoms  that  were  readily  present  and  visible  in  Plaintiff's  case, \ni.e,  dysuria,  excessive  thirst,  unhealed  sores,  and  loss  of  vision;  7)  The  failure  of  Lyndon  B. \nJoh r  son  General   H ospital  to  have  given  adequate  medical  attention  to  Plaintiff  on  2/22/95  and  the \nfailure  to  have  ordered  follow-up  appointments  for  examinations  and  tests  as  the  Plaintiff  had  a \nreadily  indentifiable  medical  history  of  genitourinary  and  thyroid  problems  prior  to  2/22/95, \n(U)  This  inadequate  medical  treatment  by  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Seale,  Quinn, \nTrinh,  Chassay,  Guice,  Howard,  Phi,  Luu,  and  Wilson  has  resulted  in  that  Plaintiff  suffered \nmentally  for  nine  (9)  months  thinking  he  had  contracted  an  incurable  social  disease;  and  suffered \nthe  physical  loss  of  vision  and  the  painful  covering  of  sores  and  the  internal  discomfort  of  swollen \nglands  and  organs  for  months  due  to  the  extensively  long  period  of  time  that  Plaintiff  endured  the \nuncontrolled  disease  of  diabetes  and  as  a  result  his  vision  did  not  completely  return  to  normal  and \nPlaintiff  now  walks  with  a  cane  due  to  poor  circulation  and  resultant  numbness  to  the  lower  legs. \nAll  of  this  pain,  suffering  and  injury  was  the  proximate  result  of  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry, \nSeale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Chassay,  Guice,  Howard,  Phi,  Luu  and  Wilson's  deliberate  indifference  to  the \nserioius  medical  needs  of  the  Plaintiff  that  denied  him  due  process,  was  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment  and  a  denial  of  equal  protection  of  the  law  that  resulted  in  Plaintiff  being  in  diminished \nmental  and  debilitative  states  of  health  for  over  nine  (9)  months  and  during  which  time  Plaintiff \nwas  compelled  to  stand  federal  trial  in  Cause  No.  H-95-201  on  November  29,  1995.  in  said  states \nof  health;  and  all  of  the  foregoing  in  violation  of  Plaintiff's  federally  protected  rights  delineated  in \nthe  succeeding  paragraphs. \n27\n             \n  \n  \n(V)  ADMIN  ISTRATIVE  REMEDY  -  MEDICATIONS  AND MEDICAL \nATTENTION \nPlaintiff,  with  the  disability  as  a  life  long  epileptic,  was  aware  that  the  needed  medications \nwere  not  being  properly  dispensed  to  him  by  the  HCSD-MD  Med  Cart  Nurses.  The  Defendants \ndocumented  into  Plaintiff's  MR  a  year  long  effort  by  the  Plaintiff  to  verbally,  through  letters, \nfamily  phone  calls,  personal  intervention  by  a  HCSD  Catholic  Chaplain,  and  by  grievance \nprocedures  to  seek  from  the  HCSD  both  informal  and  formal  administrative  remedy  and  relief  in \nefforts  to  obtain  adequate  medical  care  and  specifically  the  serious  medical  need  of  receiving  the \nmuch  needed  epilepsy  medications  as  an  accomodation  to  his  disability  at  the  proper  time  each \nday.  These  informal  and  fon  nal  attempts  by  the  Plaintiff  and  others  acting  on  his  behalf  are  as \n   \nfollows:  1)  On  3/12/95  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  the  1301  Facility  Clinic  where  he  informed  Dr. \nChassay  that  in  the  first  twenty  (20)  days  of  incarceration  in  the  HCJ  that  he  had  not  been \ndispensed  twenty-two  separate  A.M  and  P.M.  doses  of epilepsy  medication  by  the  Med  Cart \nNurses.  (See  2/22/95  MAR  attached  as  Exhibit  33)  Dr.  Chassay  ordered  a  double  dose  (600mg. ) \nof  Dilantin  be  given  to  Plaintiff  for  a  makeup  re \nnedy.  (See  3/12/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit \n2)  Though  the  MAR  substantuated  Plaintiffs  complaint  of the  twenty-two  (22)  missing  doses,  Dr. \nChassay  made  no  note  in  the  MR,  was  not  concerned  about  the  potentially  dangerous  situation \nand  with  deliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs,  returned  Plaintiff  to \nAdministrative  Segregation  Cellblock  5B5.  2)  On  4/3/95  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  the  1301  Facility \nClinic  where  he  inforn  issed  a  lot  of  his  epilepsy  medication.  Dr. \nied  Dr.  M.  Guice  that  he  had  mi \n     \nGuice  documented  in  the  record  \"...8-9  day  of  meds  x  =  30  days.\"  (See  4/3/95  MR  entry  attached \nas  Exhibit  3)  Dr.  Guice  had  Plaintiff's   MI  .  before  him  and  should  have  looked  at  the   M AR  of \n2/22/95  (Exhibit  33)  and  he  would  have  realized  that  in  the  first  twenty-eight  (28)  days  of  the \nSNTP  for  Seizure  Disorders  that  Plaintiff  had  not  been  dispensed  thirty-four  (34)  separate  doses \nof  the  A.)  {.  and  P.M.  Seizure  Disorder  Medications  by  the  Med  Cart  Nurses.  Dr.  Guice  noted  8-9 \ndays  had  been  missed  and  then  made  no  further  entry  into  Plaintiffs  MR  about  medical  concerns  — \nto  this  deliberate  indifference  by  the  Med  Cart  Nurses  to  dispense  prescribed  Seizure  Disorder \nMedications  correctly.  3)  On  6/1/95  and  6/13/95  Plaintiff  complained  to  Nurse  O'Quinn  that  he \nwas  not  getting  his  Seizure  Medications  as  ordered.  (See  Daily  Segregation  Rounds  Record \n28\n  \n        \n  \nattached  as  Exhibit  48)  Plaintiff  had  been  in  the  HCJ  approzimately  one-hundred  and  eleven  (111) \ndays  and  the  MAR  for  this  period  showed  the  nurses  had  failed  to  dispense  to  Plaintiff  sixty  (60) \nseparate  doses  of  the  prescribed  Seizure  Disorder  Medications.  On  6/14/95  Nurse  K.  Howard, \nLVN,  responding  to  Plaintiff's  complaint  to  Nurse  O'Quinn  of  6/13/95  deliberately  made  a  false \nentry  into  Plaintiff's  MR  that  date  that  stated  \"  Pt  (patient)  has  received  all    doses  of  this  med \n(medication).\"  It  is  clear  that  Nurse  Howard  was  basing  such  a  conclusion  of  the  review  of  the \nnich  indicated  that  there  were  sixty  (60)  of  the  missed  doses  of  Seizure \nMR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  9  and  compare  to  MAR  attached  as \n   \nthe  3/12/95  interview  with  Dr.  Chassay  (Exhibit  2).  The  interview  where  the  \"double  dose\"  of \nSeizure  Medications  were  given  to  Plaintiff  to  make  up  for  the  twenty-two  (22)  doses  that  were \nmissed  in  the  first  twenty  (20)  days  of  incarceration.  Jurse  Howard's  own  documentation  into  the \nrecord  of  the  3/12/95  interview  states  awareness  and  knowledege  of  Plaintiff's  problem  in  not \nreceiving  the  proper  amount  of  doses  of  seizure  medication.  The  6/14/95  entry  signals  an  “at  all \ncost\"  conspiracy  to  cover  up  any  wrong  doing  or  medical  neglect  by  the  HCSD-MD  in  the \nprevious  months.  4)  On  6/8/95  and  between  the  two  complaints  of  Plaintiff  to  Nurse  O'Quinn  of \n6/1/95  and  6/8/95,  Plaintiff  was  interviewed  by  Nurse  K.  Howard  wherein  it  was  documented  into \nthe  Plaintiff's  MR  that  \"meds  (medications)  being  missed  by  Med  Cart  Nurse  \"and\"  missed  meds \nmedications.\"  (See  6/8/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  7)  Nurse  Howard  felt  on  6/8/95  that  the \nproblem  was  serious  enough  to  warrant  Plaintiff  seeing  a  Medical  Doctor  and  so  requested  in  the \n6/8/95  entry.  Six  (6)  days  later  this  1s  the  same  Nurse  Howard  who  stated  in  Plaintiff's  MR  in \nreply  to  Plaintiff's  complaints  that  \"patient  has  received  all  doses  of  this  medication.\"  5)  On \n6/9/95  Plaintiff's  MR  reflects  he  had  a  seizure  and  was  carried  by  stretcher  to  the  1301  Facility \nClinic  where  he  was  seen  by  W.  Nelson,  LVN.  Nurse  Nelson  documented  into  the  that \nPlaintiff  was  having  seizure  activity  in \nAdministrative  Segregation  due  to  not  getting  the \nprescribed  Seizure  Disorder  Medications.  Nurse  Nelson  referred  Plaintiff  to  Defendant  Dr.  A.  Phi \nto  whom  Plaintiff  repeated  the  same  complaint  about  not  receiving  all  the  epilepsy  medications  in \na  routine  manner  by  the  Med  Cart  Nurses.  Dr.  Phi  stated  that  this  was  something  he  could  not \ncontrol  and  he  sent  Plaintiff  back  to  Administrative  Segregation  without  making  any  references  to \n29\n  \n     \n  \nthe  source  of  the  complaint.  Dr.  Phi's  entry  into  Plaintiff's  MR  is  directly  below  Nurse  Nelson's \nentry  on  the  same  page  yet  Dr.  Phi's  entry  1s  void  of  any  comment  of  the  possible  wrongdoing  of \nthe  other  HCSD-MD  personnel.  (See  6/9/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  8)  6)  On  or  about \n8/15/95  Reverend  Ronaid  Cloutier,  HCSD  Catholic  Chaplain,  and  due  to  the  overall  appearance \nof  Plaintiff  that  was  indicative  of  declining  health,  personally  interceded  with  the  HCSD-MD  to \nobtain  adequate  medical  attention  for  the  Plaintiff.  HCSD-MD  personnel  did  not  heed  his  request, \nfor  Plaintiff's  MR  is  silent  as  to  any  action  taken  on  behalf  of  Plaintiff  by  the  HCSD-MD  this  date. \nThe  MAR  of  Plaintiff's  MR  reflects  on  this  date  that  Plaintiff  had  been  deprived  of  ninety-six  (96) \nseparate  doses  of  his  ordered  setzure  medication  by  the  HCSD-MD  Med  Cart  Nurses.  7)  On \n8/23/95  Plaintiff  sent  a  letter  to  the  HCSD-MD  Hospital  Administrator  that  stated  \"...sent  multiple \nrequests...\"  some  of  which  concerned  his  seizure  disorder  medications  not  being  properly \ndispensed  by  the  HCSD-MD  nurses  and  \"  I  have  become  increasingly  ill  while  your  department \nhas  been  indifferent  to  my  valid  needs.\"  Plaintiff  at  the  time  of  this  letter  was  being  made  to  wear \nthe  medically  restricted  leg  irons  that  had  a  crippling  effect,  was  still  untreated  for  the  original \nkidney  complaint,  had  been  deprived  of  ninety  ~  six  (96)  doses  of  epilepsy  medications  in  a  six \nmonth  period,  was  covered  in  open  sores  that  would  not  heal,  and  looked  so  physically \ndeteriorated  that  a  Catholic  Chaplain  was  alarmed  enough  to  make  a  personal  trip  to  the  1301 \nFacility  Clinic  on  Plaintiff's  behalf  to  obtain  adequate  medical  attention  for  his  serious  medical \nneeds.  All  of  which  caused  Plaintiff  to  write  his  first  letter  for  assistance  to  the  Hospital \nAdministrator  (Defendant  Major  M.W.  Quinn).  Plaintiff's  letter  was  not  answered  by  the  Hospital \nAdministrator.  There  is  evidence  that  the  8/23/95  letter  invoked  the  concern  of  Mr.  John \nGoodejohn  who  answers  grievances  for  the  HCSD-MD  Administration.  8)  On  8/25/95  Mr. \nGoodejohn  filled  out  a  \"Complaint  Reply  Form\"  (CRF)  and  placed  it  in  Plaintiff's  MR  without \ngiving  Plaintiff  a  copy.  (See  8/25/95  CRF  attached  as  Exhibit  68)  The  CRF  blatantly  falsified  the \nfacts  of  Plaintiff's  treatment  by  stating  \"Inmate  has  received  care  consistent  to  special  needs \ntreatment  plan  for  seizure  disorder...\"  signed  by  Mr.  Goodejohn  and  most  condemnably  of  all  by  © \nHCSD-MD  Medical  Director  Mike  Seale  who  noted  \"Reviewed;  agree  with  above\"  who  also \nsigned  the  CRF.  On  the  date  of  Dr.  Seale's  agreement  with  Mr.  Goodejohn  that  the  SNTP  for \nPlaintiff's  seizure  order  had  been  met  the  Plaintiff's  MAR  in  their  respective  possession  for  review \n30\nindicated  there  had  been  one-hundred  (100)  missed  seizure  medication  dispensations  in  Plaintiff's \ncase  in  one-hundred  and  eighty-three  (183)  days  of  incarceration.  9)  On  9/20/95  Plaintiff  having \nnot  received  adequate  medical  attention  by  the  HCSD-MD  wrote  a  letter  to  U.S.  Marshall  Ray \nBright  which  was  made  part  of Plaintiffs  MR.  (See  9/20/95  Bright  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  69) \nThe  letter  stated  the  ongoing  pattern  and  practice  of  deliberate  indifference  to  the  serious  medical \nneed  of  Plaintiff  and  listed  that  Plaintiff  had  written  seven  (7)  Inmate  Requests  and  three  (3) \ngrievance  letters  to  the  HCSD-MD  in  the  seven  (7)  months  of  his  incarceration  (2/22/95-9/20/95)  \nand  as  to  that  date  had  not  received  adequate  medical  attention  from  the  Defendant's.  10)  On  or \nabout  10/2/95  Rev.  Ron  Cloutier,  HCSD  Catholic  Chaplain  made  a  second  attempt  to  obtain \nadequate  medical  care,  for  Plaintiff's  physical  condition  was  visually  growing  worse.  As  with  the \nfirst  attempt  on  8/15/95,  he  again  failed  to  obtain  the  needed  medical  care  for  Plaintiff's  serious \nmedical  needs  from  the  HCSD-MD.  11)  On  11/6/95,  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  the  1301  Facility \nClinic  to  be  interviewed  by  Defendant  Dr.  Luu.  Plaintiff  had  been  called  by  Dr.  Luu  in  reference \nto  a  lab  test  that  showed  Plaintiff's  blood  to  have  low  levels  of  the  needed  Seizure  Disorder \nmedications  Dilatin  (phenytoin)  and  Phenobarbital.  (See  10/27/95  Lab  results  attached  as  Exhibit \n25)  Plaintiff  referred  Dr.  Luu  to  the  M  .R  sheets  in  his  MR  that  on  that  date  indicated  one- \nhundred  and  twenty-two  (122)  missed  doses  of  these  prescribed  medications.  (See  MAR  attached \nas  Exhibit  33-43)  Dr.  Luu  reviewed  the  MAR  and  then  noted  in  Plaintiff's  MR  that  his  \"review \n(of)  records  pt.  (patient)  missed  his  med.  (medications).\"  Dr.  Luu  stated  to  Plaintiff  that  he  could \nnot  make  the  HCSD-\\  [D  nurses  consistently  deliver  Plaintiffs  medications  because  this  was  an \narea  out  of  his  control.  In  a  dangerous  and  highly  illegal  and  unethical  patchwork  medical \ntreatment  plan,  Dr.  Luu  said  that  the  only  medical  procedure  he  could  utilize  to  overcome  the \nnegligent  and  incompetent  Med  Cart  Nurses  not  consistently  dispensing  A.M.  and  P.M.  seizure \ndisorder  medications  was  to  double  the  daily  doses  and  perhaps  the  extra  over-medication  process \nwould  make  up  for  the  missed  medications.  Dr.  Luu  then  doubled  the  Phenobarbital  to  an  A.M. \nand  P.M.  delivery  and  added  and  extra  200mg.  of  Dilantin  in  the  P.M.  to  the  existing  300mg. \nA.M.  dosage.  (See  11/6/95  MR  entry  attached  as  Exhibit  12)  This  practice  was  extremely \ndangerous  for  the  Plaintiff  then  found  himself  at  times  overmedicated.  Overmedication  can,  like \nundermedication,  trigger  seizure  activity.  With  Dr.  Luu's  unethical  treatment  plan,  Plaintiff  found \n31\n        \nimself  on  a  \"Roller-coaster  ride”  of  under,  normal,  and  overmedicated  days  that  lasted  from \n11/6/95  to  7/12/96.  12)  On  or  about  12/1/95,  Plaintiff  having  been  denied  medical  treatment  by \nhaving  missed  six  (6)  doctors  appointments  at  the  HCSD-MD  1301  Facility  Clinic  (See  medical \nrecords  entries  at:  4/12/95  attached  as  Exhibit  4;  4/14/95  attached  as  Exhibit  5;  6/19/95  attached \nas  Exhibit  7;  6/20/95  attached  as  Exhibit  8;  11/3/95  attached  as  Exhibit  12;  12/01/95  attached  as \nExhibit  13)  through  incompetent  scheduling  and  fo llow-up  by  HCSD-MD  personnel  then  filed \ngrievance  #95-1083  against  J.  Lewis,  W.C.  (ward  clerk),  HCSD-MD,  who  in  the  presence  of \nPlaintiff  deliberately  cancelled  the  12/01/95  scheduled  doctor's  appointment  and  then  misled  the \niff  by  saying  that  she  would  recall  him  to  the  1301  Facility  Clinic  later  that  date  to  see  the \ndoctor.  The  recall  appointment  was  not  forthcoming  and  this  was  a  deliberate  pattern  and \npractice  of  the  HCSD  MD  of  denying  Plaintiff  adequate  medical  care  as  demonstrated  by  the  five \n(5)  previous  recall  appointments  of  4/12/95  thru  11/03/95  that  also  were  not  forthcoming  as  is \ndocumented  in  Plaintiff's  ..  13)  On  3/13/96,  U.S.  Marshall  Lisa  Griffis  sent  a  fax  of  a \nGovernment  N  lemorandum  to  Major  M.W.  Quinn  and  Linda  Parker,  HCSD-MD,  requesting  them \nto  look  into  complaints  concerning  Plaintiff's  medications.  (See  3/13/96  memorandum  attached  as \nEx hi bi t  70)  Six  (6)  days  later  on  3/19/96  Plaintiff  was  seen  by  Dr.  Guice  who  makes  no  entry  in \nPlaintiff's  MR  about  missed  seizure  disorder  medications.  (See  3/19/96  MR  entry  attached  as \nExhibit  21)  The  MAR  in  Plaintiff's  MR  indicated  that  one-hundred  and  eighty  (180)  separate \ndoses  of  seizure  disorder  medications  had  been  missed  by  the  !  Med  Cart  Nurses  in  approximately \none  year.  14)  On  4/15/96,  in  answer  to  Plaintiff's  attorney's  letter  of  4/08/96,  Major  K.W.  Berry \ndirected  a  letter  to  Plaintiff's  attorney  that  stated  \"  This  office  will  have  an  immediate \nreview....medical  needs....  if  there  is  a  need...  make  special  arrangements.....due  to  medical \nreasons.\"  (See  4/15/96  Berry  letter  attached  as  Exhibit  75)  Service  copy  was  sent  to  Major  M.  W. \nQuinn-Hospital  Administrator,  HCSD-M   ).  The  Plaintiffs  MR  demonstrates  the  ill  will    and \ndeliberate  indifference  of  Berry  and  Quinn  had  towards  the  disabled  Plaintiff  and  his  serious \nmedical  needs  in  this  systematic,  arbitrary  and  capricious  denial  of  medical  attention,  in  that  the \nnext  entry  in  Plaintiff's  MR  1s  5/24/96,  and  that  for  a  blood  test  wherein  he  did  not  see  a  HCSD- \nM  D  Physician.  Had  Major  Berry  or   M ajor  Quinn  reviewed  Plaintiff's  MR  on  4/15/96,  as  the \nBerry  letter  suggests,  they  would  have  found  that  the  disabled  Plaintiff  was  being  made  to  wear \n32\n                     \n     \nthe  medically  restricted  leg  irons,  that  a  number  of  M.D.  appointments  had  been  scheduled  and \nnot  kept,  and  that  the  MAR  indicated  over  one-hundred  and  eighty  (180)  missed  doses  of  seizure \ndisorder  medication  in  Plaintiff's  case.  15)  On  4/17/96,  Plaintiff's  attorney  sent  a  second  letter  to \nU.S.  Marshal,  Al  Solis  in  support  of  his  first  letter  of  4/08/95  citing  Plaintiff's  declining  health  and \nhis  epileptic  condition.  (See  4/8/96  and  4/17/96  Bevans  letters  attached  as  Exhibits  73,  74) \nNeither  the  U.S.  Marshal's  service  nor  the  HCSD  gave  any  kind  of  response  of  relief  to  Plaintiff's \nserious  medical  needs  as  a  disabled  person.  16)  On  6/4/96,  Plaintiff  was  taken  to  the  1301  Facility \nClinic  wherein  the  Plaintiff  spoke  at  two  separate  interviews  with  Defendants  Dr.  M.  Seale  and \nDr.  A.  Phi,  concerning  his  low  blood  levels  of  Phenobarbital  and  Phenytoin.  At  each  interview  the \nPlaintiff  showed  both  doctors  in  the  MAR  that  he  had  missed  about  ninety  (90)  days  and  one- \nhundred  and  eighty  (180)  doses  of  the  seizure  medications  and  not  being  able  to  consistently \nreceive  the  seizure  medications  prescribed  pursuant  to  the  SNTP  on  seizure  disorders  was  the \nprobable  cause  for  the  blood  tests  to  regularly  show  low  levels  of  these  medications.  Dr.  Seale  nor \nDr.  Phi  made  any  suggestions  or  offered  any  remedies  how  this  medical  problem  of  not  receiving \nthe  prescribed  seizure  medications  from  the  Med  Cart  Nurses  could  be  solved.  (See  6/4/96 \naffidavit  attached  as  Exhibit  76)  17)  The  foregoing  sixteen  (16)  references  portray  Plaintiff,  and \nothers  acting  on  the  behalf  of  Plaintiff,  making  persistent  and  reasonable  efforts  to  obtain  his \nneeded  seizure  disorder  medication  for  sixteen  (16)  months.  It  is  remarkable  that  the  Defendants \nthemselves  documented  into  Plaintiff's  MR  eleven  (11)  entries  pertaining  to  where  Plaintiff  either \nspoke  with  HCSD-MD  doctors  and  nurses;  wrote  letters;  had  administrative  replies  placed  in  the \nMR;  or  U.  S.  Marshal's  sent  fax  messages.  Outside  the  MR  is  Plaintiff's  grievance  #95-1083  and \nPlaintiff's  attorney's  two  letters  of  4/8/96  and  4/17/96  and  the  two  personal  attempts  by  Fr.  Ron \nCloutier.  All  these  concerted  efforts  to  break  through  the  medical  neglect  and  deliberate \nindifference  to  the  serious  medical  needs  of the  Plaintiff  by  the  HCSD-MD  that  resulted  in  the \nsuffering  and  wanton  infliction  of  pain  and  callous  disregard  for  the  health  and  well  being  of  the \nPlaintiff. \nV. \nLEGAL  CLAIMS \n33\n(A)  The  facts  related  above  disclose  a  concerted  and  systematic  effort  by  the \nDefendants  and  their  agents  to  deprive  Plaintiff  of  constitutionally  guaranteed  nights,  privileges \nand  immunities,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  enumerated  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs; \nFIRST  CAUSE  OF  ACTION  | \n(A)  The  Defendants  T.  Thomas,  Berry  and  M.  Thomas,  and  each  of  them,  breached \ntheir  legal  duty,  under  color  of  law,  that  is  owed  to  the  Plaintiff,  a  disabled  person,  by  unqualified \nand  incompetent  security  personnel  being  allowed  to  work  in  the  HCSD  Classification  Section \nand  by  the  maintaining  of  inadequate  security  measures  and  prodecures  to  ensure  that  proper \nClassification  and  Medical  Screening  policy  is  followed  in  the  intake  process  on  new  prisoners  to \nthe  HCSD  Jail  Division,  thereby  subjecting  Plaintiff,  or  causing  him  to  be  subjected  to  an  unfit  and \ndangerous  living  environment  and  conditions  of  confinement  for  seventeen  (17)  months  in \ndeliberate  indifference  to  Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs  as  a  disabled  person  in  that  the \nDefendants  classified  Plaintiff  into  Administrative  Detention  and  made  no  accomodations  for \nPlaintiffs  mental  and  physical  disabilities  such  as  classification  of  Plaintiff  to  a  hospital  section \nand/or  medical  cellblock  of  the  HCSD  Jail  Division.  This  deliberate  indifference  in  the \nclassification  of  the  Plaintiff  caused  him  needless  mental  duress,  suffering,  physical  illness  and \nwanton  infliction  of  pain  and  injury  in  not  being  seen  by  proper  mental  health  personnel,  and \nresulted  in  extended  and  untreated  depression;  and  by  not  being  housed  in  a  hospital  section  or \nmedical  cellblock  having  then  to  suffer  excessive  seizure  activity;  and  the  further  denial  of  due \nprocess  rights  and  discrimination  against  a  disabled  person  by  Plaintiff  being  compelled  to  stand \ncriminal  trial  in  the  case  styled,  the  United  States  vs.  Robert  Arthur  Hall,  Cause  No.  H-95-201,  on \nNovember  29,  1995,  in  the  Honorable  Ewing  Werlein's  Federal  District  Court  of  the  Southern \nDistrict  of  Texas,  while  Plaintiff  was  in  this  diminished  mental  and  debilitative  state,  in  violation  of \nhis  rights  secured  by  the  Fifth,  Sixth,  Eighth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to  the  United  States \nConstitution,  42  United  States  Code,  Section  1983  and  42  United  States  Code,  Section  12132. \n34\nSECOND  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(B)  The  Defendant's,  T.

Thomas,  Berry,  Quinn,  Seale,  Trinh,  Chassay,  Guice,  Howard, \nPhi  and  Luu,  and  each  of  them,  breached  their  legal  duty,  under  color  of  law,  owed  to  Plaintiff,  a \ndisabled  person,  by  deliberate  indifference  to  his  serious  medical  needs  by  subjecting  Plaintiff,  or \ncausing  him  to  be  subjected  to,  needless  mental  duress,  suffering,  physical  illness  and  wanton \ninfliction  of  pain  and  injury  by  compelling  Plaintiff  to  wear  leg  irons  for  fifteen  (15)  months  and \nthat  said  use  of  leg  irons  had  been  medically  restricted  due  to  Plaintiffs  orthopedic  disability.  The \nuse  of  leg  irons  by  the  Defendants  prevented  Plaintiff  from  the  free  exercise  of  his  religion  in  not \nbeing  able  to  attand  religious  services  and  the  exercise  of  his  due  process  rights  in  having \nil  access  to  the  courts  by  not  being  able  to  atend  law  library  periods  and  by  further \ndenial  of  due  process  rights  and  discrimination  against  a  disabled  person  by  Plaintiff  being \ncompelled  to  stand  criminal  trial  in  the  case  styled,  the  United  States  vs.  Robert  Arthur  Hall, \n35\n  \n        \n  \n  \nCause  No.  H-95-201,  on  November  29,  1995,  in  the  Honorable  Ewing  Werlein's  Federal  District \nCourt  of  the  Southern  District  of  Texas,  while  wearing  the  medically  restricted  leg  irons  in \nviolation  of  Plaintiff's  rights  secured  under  the  First,  Fifth,  Sixth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  to \nthe  United  States  Constitution,  42  United  States  Code,  Section  1983  and  42  United  States  Code, \nSection  12132. \nIX \nFOURTH  CAUSE  OF  ACTION \n(D)  The  Defendants,  T.

Hall \nCR  H-95-201 \nMy  File  #95- \nDear  Mr.  Solis: \nPlease  make  reference  to  my  letter  of  which  a  copy  is  attached. \nOn  4/15/96  I  visited  Mr.  Hall  at  the  Harris  County  Jail  at  which  time  his  feet  were  again  in \nshackles. \nMr.  Hall  entered  the  Harris  County  Jail  on  2/22/95.  On  or  about  12/5/95  after  numerous \ncomplaints  concerning  his  health  Mr.  Hall  was  diagnosed  a  diabetic.  The  diabetes  is  in  addition  to \nhis  seizure  disorder  and  hyperthyroidism. \nWhen  Mr.  Hall  entered  the  Harris  County  Jail  his  weight  was  228  pounds  and  his  weight \nlast  recorded  in  his  medical  record  on  3/19/96  was  278  pounds. \nMr.  Hail  does  not  look  well  to  me.  I  am  not  a  medical  doctor  but  it  1s  generally  known \nthat  a  diabetics  blood  sugar  should  be  monitored  on  a  regular  basis,  some  diabetics  blood  sugar  is \nmonitored  daily  and  some  more  than  once  datly.  Since  Mr.  Hall  was  diagnosed  a  diabetic  on \n12/5/95  his  medical  record  reflects  that  his  blood  sugar  was  monitored  on  two  occasions. \n  \nBased  on  the  fact  that  Mr.  Hall  is  an  epileptic,  has  hyperthyroidism  and  has  been \ndiagnosed  a  diabetic  I  don't  belive  he  should  be  housed  in  an  isolation  cell  5-B-5-1  but  should  be \nhoused  on  a  medical  floor  and/or  medical  facility.  Your  office  is  responsible  for  the  case  of  Mr. \n  \nHall  and  you  have  contracted  this  responsibility  away  to  the  Harris  County  Shenff's  Office.  Mr. \nHall  is  not  receiving  proper  medical  care  in  the  Harris  County  Jail.  If  the  Harris  County  Sheriff's \nOffice  cannot  provide  Mr.  Hall  proper  medical  care  I  ask  that  he  be  transferred  to  a  Federal \nMedical  facility. \n \n  \n  \nYours, \nTIB/bg \nenclosure \nU.

Section \n39,103  definitions. \nMEDICAL  INTERVIEW \nOn  June  4,  1996,  affiant  was  taken  from  Administrative  Segregation  Cell  block  5B5-01  to \nthe  HCSD-Medical  Division  clinic  located  on  the  second  floor  of  the  HCSD,  1301  Franklin  Jail \nFacility  (1301  Facility).  Upon  arrival  at  the  clinic  affiant  was  placed  in  a  curtained  inmate  patient \ninterview  area  in  the  main  room of the  clinic. \nStanding  nearby  were,  Dr.  M.  Seale,  HCSD  Medical  Director,  and  Mr.  Andrew  Johnson, \nthird  year  medical  student  -  University  of  Texas.  Dr.  Seale  and  Mr.  Johnson  had  affiant's  medical \nrecord  (MR)  open  and  Dr.  Seale  was  explaining  to  Mr.  Johnson  that  affiant’s  last  blood  test,  taken \nby  C.D.  Ware,  LVN,  on  5/24/96,  had  came  back  with  phenobarbital  and  phenytoin  (epilepsy \nseizure  medications)  below  normal  Jevels  and  near  and  in  the  panic  value  ranges.  Since  the  low \nlevels  of  this  type  test  have  been  a  sixteen  month  long  problem,  apparently  Dr.  Seale  was  going  to \nhave  Mr.  Johnson  talk  with  affiant  about  this  ongoing  problem. \nAffiant  asked  to  talk  with  Dr.  Seale  that  he  might  shed  light  on  the  source  of  the  problem \nof  the  chronic  low  drug  levels  of  seizure  medications.  Dr.  Seale  was  shown  by  affiant  that  the \nAdministrative  Medical  Records  (AMR)  tn  affiant's  MR  showed  that  the  probable  cause  of the \nlow  test  results  was  that  in  the  previous  year  period  that  the  HCSD-Medical  Division  Drug  Cart \nNurses,  who  dispense  controlled  medications,  had  not  been  delivered  for  approximately  ninety \n(90)  of  those  days  and  which  represented  approximately  one-hundred  and  eighty  (180)  doses  of \nseizure  medication.  After  reviewing  an  AMR  page,  that  confirmed  the  90  day/180  dose  scenario, \nDr.  Seale  was  at  a  loss  to  explain  how  the  medical  record  supported  affiant's  claim,  and  made  no \nsuggestions  or  offered  any  remedies  how  the  problem  might  be  resolved  by  his  office. \nAffiant  then  related  to  Dr.  Seale  that  on  3/8/95,  Dr.  D.  Klein,  M.D.  had  signed  orders  that \naffiant  not  be  made  by  the  HCSD  to  wear  leg  irons  because  of  a  bilateral  achilles  tendon  operation\n  \nPNPad oCeame e   AOAR tahA   vOoT ma aieOt R MAhASikP  ABYO OaP   PMheSii n gReak  rae Pne A CReTsoibn ti } FT4   RRPOaRPIeNESd  R A  fEEaEreE    TPRT ASXY ASC)AP RN   AVaS PD P  EwSAeSSaSD    SE baGAaN  ee?f  YS  Shbo eaSevAyeM sAR es   FPoF OEUOA    gA2aSpES    ACoEb  OaPaaEe d  \n“MS \n“s ‘ \nS \n:  .  .  oe \n“ .  i  *.  .  as  >w s  so  _ \n  \nperformed  on  affiant  by  Ben  Tz  1b  Hospital  in  1975.  A  fiant  then  related  to  Dr.  Seale  that  after \nthe  written  order  Dr.  Klein  had  ‘orgot  to  follow  up  anc  fill  out  a  \"Special  Needs  Advisement.” \nThis  resulted  in  affiant  having  t  .  wear  leg  irons  for  the  »revious  sixteen(16)  months  and  which \nwas  a  contributing  factor  in  affi  int  having  to  walk  witl  the  assistance  of  a  cane.  Dr.  Seale  was  at \na  loss  to  explain  the  reason  Dr.  Klein  had  failed  to  folk  w  up  with  the  Special  Needs  Advisement \nand  which  resulted  in  needless  ;:ain  to  affiant. \n     \n\\ffiant  further  explained  to  Dr.  Seale  that  the  M{R  documented  for  ten  months  affiant  was \nerroneously  treated  for  a  \"herpes\"  condition  that  was  based  solely  on  visual  diagnosis  with  no \nsupporting  diagnostic  testing.  The  misdiagnosed  herpes  condition  could  not  be  brought  under \ncontrol  until  by  accident  it  was  discovered  that  affiant  was,  and  had  been  for  the  previous  two \nyears,  suffering  from  diabetes.  Dr.  Seale  was  at  a  loss  to  explain  why  afhant  had  not  received \nproper  medical  tests  so  as  the  HCSD  Medical  Division  could  have  reached  the  correct  diagnosis \nand  have  prevented  needless  pain  and  suffering  to  affiant. \nAffiant  finally  stated  to  Dr.  Seale  that  since  the  diagnosis  of  diabetes  on  12/7/95  that  a \nmedically  ordered  diabetic  diet  had  been  ordered  but  the  full  benefits  of  the  diet  had  not  been \nrealized  as  often  diet  trays  were  not  delivered  and/or  scheduled  sandwiches  and  milk  were  stolen \nby  inmate  floor  workers  and  that  the  floor  deputies  were  apathetic  and  did  not  intervene  in  such \nthefts.  Dr.  Seale  asked  affiant  had  he  filed  a  grievance  in  the  matter.  Afhant  produced  a  March \n20,  1996  letter  written  to  Ms .    C.  Nichols,  R.D./L.D.  and  is  referenced  \"Dietary  needs  not  being \nmet  by  HCSD.\"  Dr.  Seale  said  that  the  Nichols'  letter  had  as  of  yet  crossed  his  desk.  Dr.  Seale \nsuggested  to  affiant  to  file  a  grievance  on  the  matter  for  the  preparation  and   d elivery  of  diets  was \nbeyond  his  control. \nDr.  Seale  left  and  Mr.  Johnson  came  over  to  talk  to  affiant  concerning  the  low  test  results \nof  seizure  medications.  Again  afhant  referred  Mr.  Johnson  to  the  AMR  and  the  90  day/180  dose \nvariable  of  missing  seizure  medications.  Mr.  Johnson  candidly  agreed  that  in  his  opinion  that  this \nwould  certainly  be  the  cause  for  low  blood  levels  of  seizure  medications  in  the  test  results. \nDr.  Phi  (pronounced  Fee)  came  quickly  over  and  took  the  interview  away  from  Mr. \nJohnson.  Dr.  Phi  was  then  shown  the  AMR  with  the  90  day/180  dose  variable  of  missing \nmedications.  To  drive  the  point  home  affiant  produced  a  \"Laboratory  Results  -  Therapeutic \nDrugs\"  example  page  that  give  the  average  of  five  similar  tests  on  blood  levels  for  seizure \nmedications  dated  3/30/95  to  11/08/95  that  all  tested  out  for  low  blood  levels  of  seizure \nmedication  due  to  the  lack  of  affiant  not  receiving  the  prescribed  medication.  Dr.  Phi  was  unable \nto  expalin  why  affiant  did  not  at  times  receive  his  legally  prescribed  medication  while  housed  in \n5B5-01  of  the  Harris  County  Jail. \nAffiant  explained  to  Dr.  Phi  that  Dr.  Luu  had  doubled  the  doses  of  seizure  medication  on \n11/6/95,  in  an  attempt  to  \"break  through\"  and  overmedicate  affiant  enough  to  compensate  for  the \nirregularly  delivered  seizure  medication.  Dr.  Phi  pointed  out  that  such  a  policy  of  overmedication \nbrings  on  high  toxitity  that  can  bring  on  seizures  and  therefore  can  be  as  harmful  as  affiant  not \nreceiving  enough  medication.  Dr.  Phi  inquired  what  affiants  present  daily  seizure  rate  was  that \nwas  being  experienced.  Affiant  stated  daily  petite  mol  and  irregular  grand  mol  seizuires.  Affiant \n  \n               \n    \n™ ®.;   \n  \ndescribed  to  Dr.  Phi  and  Mr.  Johnson  that  in  the  admini:  trative  segregation  cell  he  was  in  that  he \nwas  primarily,  because  of  the  construction  design  and  arrangement  of  the  cell,  out  of  view  of  all \nHCSD  personnel  and  inmates,  and  therefore,  was  alone  when  he  suffered  seizures,  and  had  to  do \nfor  himself  and  make  the  best  of  a  bad  classification  housing  assignment. \nAffiant  summarized  to  Dr.  Phi  and  Mr.  Johnson  that  tor  over  a  year  that  he  had  not \nreceived  seizure  medication  a  large  portion  of  the  time  while  suffering  from  the  undiagnosed  and \nuntreated  diabetes  and  at  that  instant  was  not  receiving  his  diabetic  needs  which  had  caused  a \nserious  bodily  weight  increase.  The  MR  tn  their  hands  reflected  that  affiant  had  went  from  228 \npounds  to  284  pounds  that  date.  Dr.  Phi  indifferently  told  affiant  that  when  medications  were  not \ngiven  or  diets  not  delivered  to  tell  a  floor  Deputy  Sheriff.  Affiant  told  Dr.  Phi  and  Mr.  Johnson \nthat  he  had  tried  that  avenue  of  relief  but  the  Deputies  did  not  care  and  stated  it  was  not  their \nproblem.  Dr.  Phi  nodded  his  head  that  he  understood  and  smiled  knowingly  and  said  that  he  was \ndone  with  the  interview. \n    \n    \n    \n‘Robert  Arthur  Hall \nSTATE  OF  TEXAS \nCOUNTY  OF  HARRIS \nOr \nAND  SWORN  TO  BEFORE \nSUBSCRIBED  ME  on  the  day  of  _' \n  \nay.  ,  ,  S  hana. \nayx   c \n3 \nrast \n2  ”  .  ‘  a  y  3 \n4  ”  ;  5  4  .  _  bs \n.

Defendant Wilson is named in this action in her individual and \nofficial capacities. \nIV \nFACTS OF CLAIM \n(A)  On 9/8/93  Plaintiff was released from the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons \n(BOP) and  paroled to the custody of the United  States Parole Commission (USPC) to the \nsupervision ofMr. Louis Brewster,  Chief Probation Officer,  Southern District of Texas.  Direct \nsupervision of Plaintiff was delegated to Mr.  Frank Flanigan,  U.S.  Probation Officer,  Conroe, \nu.s. \nTexas.  At the time of release BOP,  USPC  and  Probation Office records adduce an ongoing \nhistory of serious physical  and  mental conditions that legally designated Plaintiff as  a disabled \nperson pursuant to definitions found  in the Americans With Disabilities Act.  (See 42  U.s.c. \nSection  12102 (2) (A) (B);  and  28  Code of Federal Regulations Section 35.104 et  seq.).  These \ndisabilities include,  but are not limited to:  neurological  (brain damage at birth);  epilepsy; \nmusculoskeletal; hyperthyroidism;  chronic kidney  dysfunction (renal calculi);  diabetes;  mental and \nemotional illnesses oflife long nature such as  bipolar disorder (manic depressive);  clinical major \ndepression and  split  personality.  (See records attached as  Exhibits  58-64).  Plaintiff's case history \nand  mental condition warranted Mr.  Brewster's office to  seek and  receive as  a condition of release \na \"Special Mental Health Aftercare Condition\"  which stipulated  \"you  shall  participate in an in \npatient or an out-patient mental health program as  directed by your probation officer.\"  (See \n5/23/95  letter attached as Exhibit  58). \n(B)  In early  1994 Plaintiff experienced severe kidney problems.  Being indigent \nPlaintiff applied at the Harris County Hospital District Regional Eligibility Center for  a Patient 10 \ncard known commonly as the  \"Gold  Card.\"  Plaintiff received the gold card and  was designated to \nthe Acres Home Community Health Center.  At the center tests were conducted and it was \ndiscovered that  Plaintiff had traces of blood  and  ketones in a urine sample which prompted the \ncenter to  refer the case to Lyndon B.  Johnson General Hospital (LBJGH).  At LBJGH it was \n4 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 5 of 129\ndetermined that with a chronic kidney infection that Plaintiff had developed a kidney  stone (renal \ncalculi).  The LBJGH Urology Stafftriaged Plaintiff's case to Hermann Hospital for  \"Lithotripsy\" \nto remove the kidney stone in  July  1994. \n(C)  Plaintiff physically weakened by months of infection and constant pain from the \nkidney condition,  and  not receiving the therapy and treatment  as  ordered under the USPC Special \nMental Health Aftercare Condition supposedly due to laking government funds,  went into major \ndepression.  The depression caused Plaintiff to seek other avenues of the much needed \npsychotherapy and psychiatric treatment.  In September 1994, Plaintiff made contact with the \nMental Health Mental Retardation Association (  ) in Humble,  Texas.  The \ndiagnosed Plaintiff with Major Depression/Organic Mood Disorder,  prescribed the psychotropic \nmedication Elavil but was unable to provide individual counseling with a psychiatrist.  (See \nrecord attached as Exhibits 64,65)  Still suffering from the chronic kidney condition and \nuntreated major depression,  Plaintiff was arrested on a USPC  parole violator warrant and placed \nin the Harris County Jail (HCJ) as  a federal  prisoner on 2/21/95  under sheriff's prisoner number \n615184.  (See MHMR record attached as Exhibits 64,  65).  Still  suffering from the chronic kidney \ncondition and untreated major depression,  Plaintiff was arrested by the Houston Office of the \nUnited States Marshals Service on a USPC parole violator warrant.  The Marshals Service had \nthe Plaintiff placed in the Harris County Jail (HCJ) as a federal  prisoner on 2121195  under Sheriff's \nPrisoner Number (SPN) 615184. \n(D)  HARRIS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT (HCSD) \nI.)  After being placed in the HCSD \nJail Division (HCSD-JD)  1301  Franklin Jail facility  (1301  facility)  a medical screening health \nquestionnaire was incorrectly completed by Defendant Deputy Marcorif Thomas.  (See 2/22/95 \nrecord attached as  Exhibit 49) Three correct answers were glossed over which directly influenced \nclassification criteria and these three omissions discriminated against the Plaintiff's disabled status \nby depriving him of both immediate and needed physical  and psychiatric medical attention that \ndate and at later dates in this complaint.  The incorrect answers are (a) as to question number one: \nonly hours after the questionnaire was completed the HCSD-Medical Division (HCSD-MD) and \nLBJGH medical records indicate Plaintiff was taken to LBJGH at the consulting request of \n5 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 6 of 129\nDefendant Dr.  C.  Trinh as Plaintiff was in extreme pain from the chronic kidney infection and \ndysuria.  (See 2122/95  records attached as Exhibits  1,50).  (b)  as to questions ten and eleven: \nanswer to twelve states yes,  the Plaintiff had previously been in the HCJ on 5-18-1988.  Deputy \nThomas omitted or ignored the proper HCSD policy,  procedure, program or plan of reviewing \nthe  1988 HC}  incarceration.  Verification of the  1988 jail record would have stated that Plaintiff \nwas admitted to the same HCJ 1301  facility in  1986 and placed on the  jail floor and \nconsidered a suicide risk at that time.  The record further reflects that Plaintiff attempted suicide in \nthe Harris County Jail in  1975.  (See 2/22/75  record attached as Exhibit 59) The health \nquestionnaire is the primary medical  screening of incoming inmates for potential psychiatric \nattention.  The glossing over and indifferent answering techniques of the classification deputy,  as \nin this instance, lead to a permanent set  of misinformation facts to become a permanent part of \nPlaintiffs HCSD-'MD Medical Record (MR).  This adversely effected Plaintiffs immediate and \nsubsequent treatment as a disabled person in not being able to realize any accomodations in the \nHCJ because the initial medical screening is declaring no to mental health problems when clearly \nthe present records and the past jail records historically state the opposite.  Should the questions \nbeen correctly answered then theoretically with a yes answer to either question it  should have \nactivated a \"Red Flag\"  for the Plaintiff to have been interviewed by the  staff at  the HCJ. \n2.)  On 2/23/95  a second health questionnaire was completed after Plaintiff returned from LBJGH \nand repeated the same mistakes as on the 2/22/95  questionnaire.  (See 2/23/95 record attached as \nExhibit 55) Plaintiff,  after admitting to feeling  suicidal, was not sent to the  floor,  but \nrather classified to the fifth  floor of the HCJ 1301  facility,  to be housed in  a single man \nsegregation cell  in cellblock 5B5.  The 2/22/95  questionnaire states a yes to question seven in that \nPlaintiff was taking seizure medications for his epileptic condition.  Plaintiff with the handicaps of \nepilepsy,  hyperthyroidism,  kidney dysfunction and life long mental  illness was not classified \ncorrectly.  Instead of being placed in  a  \"hospital cellblock\"  on the  floor,  he was instead \nplaced in the more severe setting of administrative segregation.  The SBS  cells were designated for \nminimal contact with other humans.  These cells consist of four  solid  surrounding concrete walls \nwith a recessed metal sliding door with a five  inch slit window that does not pelmit outside visual \ninspection of the cells total interior area.  Approximately one-third of the cell's interior is  out of \n6 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 7 of 129\nthe visual  sight line  of the supervising HCSD Deputy Sheriff and it  is  in this section that the wall \nmounted  steel bunk is located.  (See example drawing attached as Exhibit 32)  It is  in this \nunobservable section of the cell that Plaintiff has been forced to sleep  or sit for more than a year. \nIt is  against the dictates of reasonable correctional/jail motiffs in the safe and orderly operation of \nthe institution, for  an epileptic or any  seizure related medically diagnosed inmate to be classified \nand housed alone and out of the sight  of all  medical and  security personnel that could render \nassistance/aid to the usually repetitive cycle with seizure disorders.  3)  On 2/27/95 the HCSD \nclassification officers made another error in Plaintiffs case by transferring him from the  1301 \nfacility to the 701  N.  San Jacinto facility  (701  facility).  The HCSD policy,  procedure, program, \nor plan on classification was to keep all  \"inmate medical  cases\"  similar to Plaintiffs at the  1301 \nfacility  where the main HCSO-MD clinic  is located.  On 3/9/95,  eleven days later,  the \nclassification officers at the request of the HCSD-MD 701  facility clinic corrected the mistake and \nreturned Plaintiff as a \"medical case\" back to the  1301  facility.  Though the classification officers \nnow clearly recognized the medical status of Plaintiff the classification officers did  not place \nPlaintiff in  a hospital cellblock or on the medical floor,  but rather continued in the deprivation of \nPlaintiffs serious medical  needs by  classifYing  him back to 5B5-09 administrative segregation.  4) \nOn 4/18/96 HCSD grievance #96-03  was partially sustained to Plaintiffs allegations that the \nadministration has allowed the  \"overall conditions\"  of administrative segregation cell block 5B5-\n09,  where Plaintiff as a disabled person had been confined in  a segregation cell for over a year,  to \nbecome \"punitive\"  through discrimination and the loss of Plaintiffs privileges without due process \noflaw.  (See 3/6/96  Inmate Grievance Form attached as Exhibit  71).  The promised administrative \nreliefto the granted grievance was never forthcoming.  (See 4/18/96 IGB-004 Form attached as \nExhibit 72)  5)  The permanent misinformation of Deputy Thomas in the two health \nquestionnaires of 2122/95  and 2123/95  are still part of Plaintiffs active MR and this prevented the \nHCSD-MD from  making the same type accomodation referral to the HC}  Forensic Unit \nconcerning Plaintiffs clinical  depression.  In paragraph C  supra the Plaintiff was diagnosed at \non 9/0 I /94 with major depression and  so had a medical history and MR readily \navailable to the \nForensic Unit at the HCl  Had not Deputy Thomas, through negligence \nVll\"\\.n \nand  deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs serious medical needs as a disabled person, glossed over \n7 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 8 of 129\nthe answers to the health questionnaire,  thus defeating its design and purpose, then Plaintiff would \nhave been referred to  and  his case picked up  and treatment for his  depression been \nprovided for.  Ironically Plaintiffs MR at  at Humble,  Texas shows the \nH'.LLLH \nsearching for Plaintiff from  1110/95  to 3117/95  which was one (1) month after his incarceration in \nthe HCJ.  (See MHMRA record attached as Exhibit 65) Nearly a year later Dr.  Guice documents \nPlaintiffs ongoing  \"mild depression\"  in the MR.  (See  1/10/96 MR entry attached as Exhibit  18) \nThe record supports that Plaintiff has suffered life-long depression;  was suffering major \ndepression on 9/01/94; admitted to feeling  suicidal  on being booked into the HCI  on 2/22/95;  and \na general practioner notes a year later on  1/10/96 that Plaintiff appeared to be suffering \"mild \ndepression.\"  The record is  silent to any accomodation of mental  health treatment by any agency, \nespecially the MHMRA,  during Plaintiffs entire incarceration in the HCI from  2122/95  to 7112/96. \n(E)  The physical and mental suffering of Plaintiff from  2/22/95 to 7/12/96 in the HCI \nwas the proximate result  of Defendant M.  Thomas' egregrious failure to properly classify the \nPlaintiff as  a disabled  person and to provide an adequate jail housing assignment as an \naccomodation that kept the Plaintiff from  harm,  injury or reasonable fear thereof,  and that this \ncallous disregard of and deliberate indifference to the rights,  personal  safety and  medical needs to \nthe Plaintiff as a disabled person and was the direct result  of a pattern and  practice of the hiring of \nunqualified and incompetent security personnel to work in the HCSD classification section, the \nmaintenance of inadequate security measures and procedures to insure proper classification of \ninmates in the HCI  and these described circumstances and  conditions were deliberately and \nknowingly maintained by the Defendants T.  Thomas,  Berry,  and M.  Thomas and  each of them, \nand in total callous disregard of and deliberate indifferences to the rights and personal safety and \nwell-being of the Plaintiff thereby subjecting Plaintiff,  and/or causing him to be subjected to an \nunfit  and dangerous living enviornment and  conditions pervaded with a high level of injury, the \nunnecessary and  wanton infliction of pain that denied him due process, was cruel and unusual \npunishment and a denial  of equal protection of the law that resulted in Plaintiff being in diminished \nmental and debilatative physical  states of health for  seventeen (17) months during which time \nPlaintiff was compelled to stand federal  trial in  Cause No.  H-95-201  on November 29,  1995, in \nsaid  states of health,  and all  of the foregoing in violation of Plaintiff's federally protected rights as \n8 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 9 of 129\ndelineated in the succeeding paragraphs. \n(F)  HCSD - Initial Medical Interview-Referral to Lyndon B. Johnson General \nHospital \nAfter the 2122/95  classification,  and that same date, Plaintiff was taken to the HCSD-MD \nclinic in the  1301  facility for  a regular physical evaluation given to all  new arrivals in the HCJ \nsystem.  At this evaluation the diagnosis arrived at was 1) Epilepsy,  2) Hyperthyroidsim, 3) \nhistory of Renal Calculi (kidney stones) and that Plaintiff had not urinated in  some time and was in \nextreme discomfort with pain radiating from  mid-back to groin.  Treatment of the kidney \ndysfunction in  1994 was noted,  and that the HCSD-MD staff had been unable to void Plaintiffs \nbladder with a straight catheter attempt.  A request was made by Defendant Dr.  C.  Trinh,  HCSD \nMD, to send Plaintiff to LBJGH by van for a urology evaluation.  (See 2/22/95 MR entry attached \nas Exhibit  1) Prior to being taken to LBJGH, the HCSD-MD was able to obtain a small urine \nsample that tested to have \"trace blood and  small ketones.\"  (See 2122/95  consultation request \nattached as Exhibit  50) The 2122/95  Consultation Request stated that Plaintiff had been evaluated \nand treated by the LBJGH Urology Staffin the past (1994). \n(G)  Kidney Dysfunction Treatment.  1)  After the 2/22/95  consultation was issued \nthe Plaintiff was transported by the HCSD to LBJGH  and arrived at  10:00 a.ill.  on 2122/95.  A \nHCHI) Emergency Department Record was completed on Plaintiff.  (See 2122/95  HCRD Record \nattached as  Exhibit  51) This  record stated the chief complaint was \"PainiDysuriaiSeizure \nDisorder.  The \"Initial Assessment\"  category stated  \"Kidney stone crushed last July,  pain,  trace \nII \nblood.\"  The history category notes IlLithotripsy\"  in July  1994.  At the bottom of the record is a \ndrawing and description of Plaintiffs symptoms.  Directly under the history is the IIDate/Time\"  that \nstates 2/22195  at  12:45p.ill.  the evaluations elapsed time in the overcrowded county hospital was \ntwo hours and forty-five  minutes.  The bottom left hand  corner of the record bears the imprint \nfrom Plaintiffs \"Gold Card\"  patient ID which proves that Dr.  Pamela Wilson of the LBJGH \nUrology Staff was aware that it  was the same patient that had been previously treated for Renal \nCalculi and kidney dysfunction a few months before in  1994.  As  a free  indigent disabled person, \nPlaintiff had received moderately good medical  attention from LBJGH  In custody as an indigent \ndisabled prisoner Plaintiff seemingly ceased to exist as a human being with civil rights by the \n9 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 10 of 129\nUrology Staff,  for the LBJGH medical record turns quiet to the needs of the Plaintiff for at  12:50 \np.m.  on 2122/95,  Plaintiff was discharged by Dr.  Wilson without receiving treatment whatsoever \nfor the same condition that Plaintiff had been treated for at LBJGH.  (See HCHD record attached \nas Exhibit 52) The disparity of the record becomes clear when Exhibits 50 and  51  are compared \nwith the HCHI) emergency center discharge instructions of Exhibit 52.  These instructions \nindicate the Plaintiff is to resume \"normal activity\" though the Urology Staff knew of the 1994 \nkidney condition treatment and of the instant complaint that date which urine samples showed \n\"traces of blood and ketones.\"  There is  no follow-up  written orders concerning the kidney \ncomplaint.  The callous disregard,  deliberate indifference and  wanton infliction  of pain by Dr. \nWilson and the LBJGH Urology Staff against the disabled  Plaintiff was so blatant that a doctor \nsigned in  the  \"Patients Signature\"  space of Exhibit 52  and a copy was not given to the Plaintiff \neven though the record exhibits Plaintiff's \"Patient ID\",  name and number.  Plaintiff was dismissed \nby the LBJGH Urology Staff without comment.  From this date forward there was no further \nfollow-up  orders or medical attention by Dr.  Wilson and the LBJGH Urology  Staffwhich resulted \nin  Plaintiff continuing to suffer physical pain and experience extreme distress with this untreated \nkidney condition from 2122/95  to 7/12/96.  2) Plaintiff was taken from LBJGH to the HCSD-MD \nclinic at the  1301  facility.  Ms.  C.  Ware,  L VN,  completed a \"Master Problem List\"  which is part \nof the Plaintiff's MR.  (See 2/22/95 Master Problem List attached as Exhibit  53) \nThe Master Problem List is  silent to Plaintiff's chronic kidney condition for it is  not listed as a \nproblem though this is the same HCSD-MD clinic that sent Plaintiff to LBJGH a few hours before \nwith a consultation request issued by Dr.  Trinh,  HCSD-MD that states:  \" ... renal calculi presents \n@ extreme back and abdo.  discomfort,  claims evaluated by LBJ Urology in the past,  sip removal \nof kidney stone,  currently c/o dysuria,  backpain @ radiation to groin.  Urine dip:  trace of blood, \nsmall  ketones ... \" (See exhibits  I  &  50).  It is  indicative of the deliberate indifference to Plaintiff's \nserious medical needs as  a disabled  person that Dr.  Trinh sent Plaintiff to LBJGH based on the \nmedical facts  that:  (a)  The medical  staff at  first  had been unable to obtain a urine sample with a \n\"straight catheter attempt;\"  (b)  once having obtained a small urine sample it tested positive for the \npresence of trace blood and small  ketones;  (c) the medical  staff was apprised of the past history of \nkidney and urinary tract conditions and that Plaintiff stated he had been evaluated by the LBJ \n10 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 11 of 129\nUrology Staff which was verified at LBJGH on 2122/95;  (d) and that Plaintiff was exhibiting signs \nof physical distress,  pain and discomfort.  Dr.  Trinh neglected to provide proper medical care by a \nfollow-up  interview which would have exposed Plaintiffs' unchanged physical conditions and he \nwould have seen by the HCB I) medical paperwork that Plaintiff had  not been accomodated or \ntreated at LBJGH but rather had been \"shuflled\"  through by the indifferent Urology Staff and that \nPlaintiff,  as  a disabled person,  was still in need of serious medical attention.  This failure to \nprovide proper medical care through Dr.  Trinh's deliberate indifference,  brought about the \nneedless suffering and wanton infliction of pain to the Plaintiff.  With nurse Ware's omission in the \nmaster problem list,  and with Dr.  Trinh's failure to follow-up  on his  own ordered consultation \nrequest,  it  is  demonstrated,  as with the foregoing  health questionnaires in part D of this complaint, \nthat there is  a discernable pattern and  practice, based on negligence of official HCSD Medical \nRecords with omitted or missing information and over looked pertinent medical data,  not making \nits way into Plaintiff's permanent HCSD-MD medical record.  The policy,  procedure,  program, or \nplan that the HCSD-MD utilizes in  accurate record keeping,  as charged by law,  is  here \ndemonstratably being departed from  and which proved to be a  contributing factor that \ndetrimentally affected Plaintiff's health and well-being as  a disabled person in the subsequent non \ntreatment of Plaintiff's chronic kidney condition from  2/22/95  to 7112196.  3) The 3/30/95 \nPlaintiff's MR describes:  \"burning urination\"  and a 4/3195  M.D.  appointment is  set.  The Plaintiff's \nMR at 4/3/95  describe:  \"chronic kidney stones.\"  (See 4/3/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 3)  The \nspecific kidney complaint was overshadowed and  completely forgotten by the misdiagnosis of the \n\"Herpes.\"  No further follow-up  was ordered concerning the kidney condition and the resultant \npain which the plantiff had suffered from the untreated ailment for forty-two  (42) days.  4) The \n4/14/95  Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"dysuria\"  and  again the  specific kidney/urinary condition was \novershadowed and completely forgotten by the ongoing misdiagnosis of \"Herpes.\" No further \nfollow-up was ordered concerning the \"dysuria\"  and the resultant pain which the Plaintiff had now \nsuffered from  for fifty-three  (53) days.  (See 4114/95  entry attached as Exhibit  5).  5) The 6/8/95 \nPlaintiff's MR describes:  \"back pain 6-8  wks.\"  A 6119/96  M.D.  appointment was scheduled for \nPlaintiff but was never kept by the HCSD-MD.  (See 6/8/95  entry attached as Exhibit 7) Plaintiff \nhad  now been in  back and  kidney pain for one-hundred and nineteen (119) days.  6) The 7/18/95 \n11 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 12 of 129\nPlaintiff's MR describes:  \"chronic back pain\"  (kidney area).  Plaintiff realizing that no adequate \nmedical care is going to be forthcoming  after five  (5) months of requests to the HCSD-MD,  asks \nfor  an extra mattress and  medications to stop the pain in  his  back.  This patchwork medical \nrequest is  granted and Plaintiff is given a \"Special Needs Advisement\"  (SNA) for an extra \nmattress.  (See 7/18/95  advisement attached as Exhibit 57) and a minor pain medication for fifteen \n(15) days.  (See 7/18/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 9) No further follow-up  was ordered \nconcerning the kidney related back pain which Plaintiff had  now suffered with for one-hundred \nand forty-eight  (148) days.  7)  The  11127/95  Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"kidney pain.\"  A  12/5/95 \nM.D.  appointment was made for Plaintiff.  The  12/5/95  Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"kidney pain, \n1994 lithotripsy at LBJGH,  a kidney stone was found ..... Kidney stones x 2yrs.\"  (See  12/5/95 MR \nentry attached as Exhibit  14) Plaintiff had been with kidney and back pain two-hundred and \neighty-eight (288) days.  This is the only M.D.  appointment since Plaintiffs first  admission to jail \non 2122/95  that a urine test was ordered and actually performed by the HCSD-MD.  (See  12/7/95 \nlab  results attached as Exhibit  29) This test accidentally discovered a high glucose level that led to \na diabetes diagnosis on  12/7/95.  (See  12/7/95 MR entry attached as  Exhibit  15) These test results \nhad the same overshadowing effect as in other serious medical  conditions described in this \ncomplaint in that the kidney pain complaint was forgotten as a specific issue to be treated by the \nHCSD-MD and negligently is  no longer mentioned in Plaintiff's MR as late as the 6/4/96 MR \nentry and at which time Plaintiff had  suffered kidney and back pain for over fifteen  (15) months. \n(H)  This inadequate medical treatment of Plaintiffs serious kidney condition from \n2/22/95 to 7112/96  by Defendants T.  Thomas, Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Phi,  Luu and \nWilson has resulted in unnecessary physical  suffering of Plaintiff for  a period of over fifteen (15) \nmonths through an ongoing pattern and practice of arbitrary and capricious discrimination to the \nPlaintiff and all the proximate result of Defendants T.  Thomas, Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice, \nPhi,  Luu and Wilson's deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of the Plaintiff \namounting to the infliction of unnecessary pain that denied  him due process,  was cruel and \nunusual punishment,  and  a denial of equal protection under the law that resultted in Plaintiff being \nin diminished  mental and debilitative physical  states of health for  seventeen (17) months and \nduringn  which time Plaintiff was compelled to stand federal  trial in Cause No.  H-95-20 1 on \n12 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 13 of 129\nNovember 29,  1995,  in  said  states of health;  and all of the foregoing in violation ofPlaintitrs \nfederally  protected rights delineated in the succeeding paragraphs. \n(I)  HCSD-MD TWO WEEK PHYSICAL AND MEDICALLY RESTRICTED \nUSE OF LEG IRONS. \n1)  On 3/8/95, and while Plaintiff was still incorrectly housed by the HCSD \nClassification Section to the 701  N.  San Jacinto Facility (701  Facility),  he was given a mandatory \n\"two-week physical\".  A HCSD-MD  \"History &  Physical Examination\"  record was completed \nand  signed by  S.  O'Neall,  R.N.,  and D.  Klein,  M.D.  which states as a written medical order under \n\"Comments\"  (See 3/8/95  history attached as Exhibit 56)  Bilateral Achilles tendons surgery.  \"'75 \n(cannot wear leg irons for that reason)  ... \"  In  1975 Plaintiff's achilles tendons had been severed \nin  both legs,  and the surgical reattachment left the tendons short and tight with minimal ankle \nrotation leaving Plaintiff with a physical orthopedic disability in both legs.  Any contact or \npressure from a foreign object to this area of the ankle causes pain, bruising,  spraining,  and/or \ntemporary loss of foot  control and impaired coordination.  By the design nature and use,  leg irons \nwhen used on Plaintiff,  falls  on the scar lines of both legs and the use of leg irons is painful and \ncauses tenderness,  soreness and  partial lameness for days after their use.  Nurse O'Neall and Dr. \nKlein both correctly identified the physical  orthopedic disability,  and the problems that it \npresented,  and took appropriate and timely action by issuing the \"Medical Restriction\"  on the use \nofleg irons on Plaintiff as an attempt at  accomodation.  Dr.  Klein then failed  to fill  out a Special \nNeeds Advisement (SNA) which was the follow-up  step in the HCSD-MD policy,  procedure, \nprogram or plan that would have insured that the security personnel did not use the leg irons on \nPlaintiff.  Dr.  Klein's failure  to follow-up  is the cause of Plaintiff having to suffer over a year and \nthree months of pain from the use of the leg irons and the deprivation of Plaintiff's rights and \nprivileges as a prisoner in the HCl. \n2)  On 3/9/95 Plaintiff was transferred back to the HCJ  1301  facility wearing leg \nirons and was placed back in  administrative segregation cellblock SB5-09.  Since the implemen \ntation of this written medical restriction on the use of leg irons on 3/8/95, these legally given \nmedical orders/instructions have been deliberately and totally disregarded by all  HCSD personnel. \n13 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 14 of 129\n3)  In support of this part of the complaint the Plaintiff relates the following: \n(A)  On 5/12/95 Plaintiff was placed in leg irons by HCSD Deputy \nLewellen and taken to the  1301  facility  clinic for Plaintiff to receive some missed medications.  At \nthe clinic Plaintiff complained to Defendant Dr.  Mark Chassay,  HCSD-MD,  that his ankles and \ntendons were swollen from the medically restricted use of leg irons.  Plaintiff requested Deputy \nLewellen to ask Dr.  Chassay to verify in Plaintiffs MR the 3/8/95  entry on the History &  Physical \nExamination Record wherein Dr.  Klein  and Nurse O'Neall had given and  signed written \norders/instructions,  in the comment section that the leg irons were not to be used on Plaintiff. \nDeputy Lewellen made the request and Dr.  Chassay and defendent K.  Howard, LVN and J. \nw.e. \nLewis,  briefly and indifferently leafed through Plaintiffs MR and because of their negligence \nand deliberate indifference overlooked the legitimate entry of Dr.  Klein  and Nurse O'Neall on \n3/8/95.  Dr.  Chassay then implied to Deputy Lewellen that  Plaintiff was trying to deceive the \ndeputy.  Plaintiff protested that he was telling the truth and had personally witnessed the written \ninstructions of 3/8/95  and the signature on the record by both Dr.  Klein and Nurse O'Neall. \nEvidence of the ongoing pattern and  practice of deliberate indifference to Plaintiff is here \ndemonstrated in that Dr.  Chassay did not need the medical record to resolve the complaint.  As a \nlicensed physician his own authority allowed him to issue medical orders,  restrictions,and issue a \nSpecial Needs Advisement.  Dr.  Chassay having Plaintiff physically present needed only to \nexamine Plaintiffs ankles and thereby resolve the issue of accomodation of the orthopedic \ndisability.  In total apathy to Plaintiffs needs,  Dr.  Chassay without any examination whatsoever, \ninstructed Deputy Lewellen that he was done interviewing Plaintiff.  Deputy Lewellen returned the \nPlaintiff to cellblock 5B5  where he was continually subjected to the painful use of the still \nmedically restricted use of leg irons for the next one-year and three months. \n(B)  On 5122/95,  Plaintiff requested Deputy David Davis,  HCSD \nClassification that the use of leg irons be discontinued.  Plaintiff explained to Deputy Davis that \nthe HCSD-MD had on 3/8/95 ordered that leg irons not be used but somehow that order had not \nmade its way to the Jail Division Officials.  Deputy Davis informed Plaintiff that he would talk \nwith HCSD-MD personnel and to Sgt.  T.  Roshto,  HCSD-JD, Fifth floor  Supervisor to see if Sgt. \nRoshto would on his  own initiate the discontinuance of the leg irons.  Deputy Davis was \n14 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 15 of 129\nunsuccessful  and the use of leg irons was enforced against the medical orderlinstructions not to \nuse them on the disabled Plaintiff. \n4)  The use of leg irons continued from 2122/95  thru 4/17/96 as  demonstrated by \ntwo  separate letters to U.S.  Marshal AI  Solis from Plaintiff's attorney Mr.  Thomas Bevans and \nwhich are respectively dated 4/8196  (See 4/8/96 Bevans letter attached as Exhibit  73) and 4117/96 \n(See 4117/96 Bevans letter attached as Exhibit  74) each letter shows service copy to US. District \nJudge Ewing Werlein,  Jr;  Defendant Tommy Thomas,  Sheriff Harris County; and the Plaintiff. \nThe 4/8/96 letter enumerates Plaintiff's medical complications as:  (a) diabetic condition-problem \nwith feet;  (b) walking with cane (while wearing leg irons);  (c) problems with achilles tendon.  The \nBevans letter requests the accomodations that Plaintiff's feet  not be shackled and that the attorney \nhimself had visually observed that the disabled Plaintiff was compelled to wear the medically \nrestriced leg irons. \n5) The 4117/96 Bevans letter documents that the HCSD-JD had been deliberately \nindifferent to the medical need of the disabled Plaintiff,  even after being put on notice by the \n4/8/96 Bevans letter by continuing to cause Plaintiffs needless  suffering and the wanton infliction \nof pain and the deliberate indifference and callous disregard  of Defendant Sheriff Tommy Thomas \nto deprive Plaintiff of his civil  rights.  This insensibility of Sheriff Thomas and Defendant Major. \nKS. Berry, HCSD,  and Defendant Major M.W.  Quinn is  exemplified in  a 4115/96  letter from \nMajor Berry to Me Bevans that  shows service copy to Major Quinn and  states that Berry's office \nwill  do an immediate review of Plaintiff's classification and  medical needs.  (See 4/15/96 Berry \nletter attached as  Exhibit  75) The MR of Plaintiff shows he was not directly seen by a HCSD-MD \nphysician from  3/19/96 to 6/4196.  Plaintiff's MR validates that Sheriff Thomas, Major Berry and \nMajor Quinn took no  actions and completely ignored the Bevan's letters requests for \naccomodation and  for medical  attention of 4/8/96 and  4117/96. \n6)  A review of Plaintiff's MR and a comparison of HCSD-MD policy,  procedure, \nprograms or plan statements indicate the primary causative factor in the\"state of confusion\" \nconcerning the use of leg irons is traced back to the initial History and Physical Examination of \n3/8/95.  Dr.  Klein failed  to \"follow-up\"  on the written orderslinstructions under the comments \nsection of the record by failing  to take the next HCSD-MD procedural step of filling  out and \n15 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 16 of 129\nsigning a form M-I72 \"Special Needs Advisement\".  (See example advisement attached as Exhibit \n57)  The SNA was specifically created to serve the very need of physical relief that Plaintiff's \ncondition required and which Dr.  Klein and Nurse ONeall readily admitted Plaintiff needed.  Said \nfailure  of Dr.  Klein to follow-up with this accomodation was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's \nserious medical needs as a  disabled  person and which resulted in one-year and three-months of \nneedless suffering,  duress,  pain and injury to Plaintiff by his  being forced to wear the admittedly \npainful leg irons. \n7)  The foregoing failure by Dr.  Klein is exacerbated in that Plaintiff did  seek to \nredress to the inadequate medical  care by writing an  informal letter to Nurse O'Neall on 3/13/95. \n(See 3/13/95 letter attached as Exhibit 66) The letter stated the indifferent attitude of Dr. \nChassay, Nurse Howard, and Ms.  Lewis at the 3/12/95  interview.  This letter,  as an informal link \nin the administrative remedy process was placed in plantiff's MR and yet no  SNA form was filled \nout concerning the leg irons for accomodation of Plaintiff's disabled condition.  Plaintiffs written \nplea for medical assistance was deliberately ignored by the HCSD-MD personnel with their full \nknowledge that it would lead to needless suffering and the wanton infliction of pain to the \ndisabled Plaintiff. \n(J)  The medically restricted use ofleg irons by the HCSD-JD from 3/8/95  to 6/4/96, \nand for fear of further infliction of suffering,  pain,  and injury prevented the Plaintiff from attending \nthe Inmate Law Library,  Church,  prayer groups,  and recreational activities as  afforded and \nprovided to all  other inmates housed in Administrative  Segregation cellblock 5B5.  Because of \nthis ongoing pattern and practice of the arbitrary and capricious discrimination the Plaintiff was \ncompelled not to attend any Law Library period or recreational activity during this  3/8/95 to \n6/4/96 period of incarceration.  The HC] Administrations physically forced this deprivation of \nPlaintiff's civil  rights through physical duress of the Plaintiff that kept him continuously \nincarcerated twenty-four (24) hours a day for over a year period in  Administrative Segregation \nwith the exceptions of attorney visits,  clinic appointments and court appearances he was \ncompelled to attend.  The mental duress,  suffering,  pain and injury to Plaintiff by the use of the \nmedically restricted leg irons from 3/8/95  in  the HCSD-JD was the proximate result of \nDefendants,  T.  Thomas, Berry,  Quinn,  Seale,  Klein and Chassay's egregrious failure to take the \n16 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 17 of 129\nnecessary steps to adequately protect the disabled Plaintiff from discrimination due to his disability \nand from  harm,  suffering,  pain,  injury,  or the reasonable fear thereof,  after having been put on \nnotice in writing by the Plaintiff in his MR and by Plaintiffs attorney's written notice that \nsuffering,  physical pain and injury was befalling the Plaintiff and their deliberate indifference to the \nserious medical needs,  civil  rights,  and personal safety of the Plaintiff and was the direct result of \na pattern and  practice of not following up on written medical orders/instructions by incompetent \nmedical  personnel,  the maintenance of inadequate HCSD-MD policies,  procedures,  programs or \nplans to ensure that medical orders/insturctions are followed  up  on by medical and security \npersonnel.  These described circumstances and conditions were deliberately and knowingly \nmaintained by Defendants T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Quinn,  Seale,  Klein  and  Chassay,  and in total \ncallous desregard of and  deliberate indifference to the well being,  personal safety,  serious medical \nneeds and rights of the disabled Plaintiff thereby subjecting him,  or causing him to be subjected to \nthe prohibition of the free  exercise of religion  and to the unnecessary and wanton infliction of \npain that denied him due process,  was cruel and unusual punishment and  a denial of equal \nprotection of the law  that  resulted in Plaintiff being in  a debilitative physical  state of health for \nfifteen  (15) months and during which time Plaintiff was compelled to stand federal  trial in Cause \nNo.  H-95-201  on November 29,  1995,  in  said state of health;  and all  of the foregoing in violation \nof Plaintiffs rights as  delineated in the  succeeding paragraphs. \n(K)  SEIZURE DISORDER - MEDICAL NEGLECT AND MEDICAL \nMALPRACTICE \nOn 2/22/9) Ms.  C.  Ware,  L VN,  placed a HCSD-MD  Special Need Treatment Plan \n(SNTP) for a seizure disorder in the Plaintiffs MR.  (See 2/22/95  SNTP attached as Exhibit 54) \nThe SNTP lays out the medical criteria for the treament of inmate/patients who have seizure \ndisorders such as Plaintiffs epilepsy.  In these terms the  SNTP states the HCSD-MD goals was to \nkeep Plaintiff seizure free  as possible through the medications Dilantin(phenytoin) and \nPhenobarbital,  that the type and frequency  of diagnostic testing would be blood tests every three \n(3) months to check the levels of DilantiniPhenobarbital,  and  that the frequency of follow up \nmedical evaluations of every three (3) months to check the effectiveness of medications and \n17 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 18 of 129\npossible adjustment to plans.  The SNTP is clear and concise that the HCSD-MD knew the correct \nand  prescribed procedure to treat Plaintiffs seizure disorder.  In Plaintiffs case to reach the SNTP \ngoal of keeping Plaintiff seizure free  as  possible there were in Plaintiffs case three separate and \ndistinct  steps for  medical personnel to follow and that was medication;  diagnostic testing;  and the \nadjustment of treatment modality based on diagnostic testing of the seizure medications found to \nbe in Plaintiffs blood. \n(L)  MEDICA TION \nDuring Plaintiffs incarceration in the HC] as a disabled federal  prisoner he sought every \navailable avenue of administrative relief to his obtaining the proper doses of the prescribed seizure \ndisorder medications Dilantin and Phenobarbital.  Seizure disorder medications are considered \n\"controlled medications\"  by the HCSD-MD and  are dispensed by HCSD-MD nurses,  commonly \nreferred to as  \"Med Cart Nurses\", on two regulated AM.  and P.M.  rounds to the cell blocks \nlocated on each of the inmate housing floors  of the HCl  The nurses have a rolling medical cart \n(med cart) that they bring from the  1301  facility  clinic to the respective inmate housing floors. \nThe cellblocks are broken into four (4) alphabetically designated quads A-D.  Each quad is broken \nup  into cellblocks numbered  1-6.  On each cellblock and/or cell  the respective location letters and \nnumbers are printed in characters ten inches (10\") tall  and are clearly visible and easy to read. \nOnce on the desired floor,  in the correct quad,  and at the right cellblock and cell the Med Cart \nNurse then refers to a Medication Administration Record (MAR) that is  set up by location and \nwhich has each individual inmates name,  number,  type drug to be dispensed and time to be \ndispensed.  (See MAR example attached as Exhibits 33-47).  The MAR is designed that it  shows \nthe chronological order of delivery of the controlled medications in the month,  day and AM.  and \nP.M.  delivery schedules as prescribed by the HCSD-MD Physicians.  Ifa particular dispensation \nof controlled medications is  made to the respective inmate then the Med Cart Nurse places his/her \ninitials in  the corresponding box for  date,  day and  AM.  or P.M.  delivery.  If dispensation was not \nmade then the nurse either initials the corresponding box and draws a circle around the initials,  or \nwrites \"no\"  and/or leaves the box unmarked altogether.  The MAR system is  part of the HCSD \nMD policy,  procedure,  program or plan to track and  monitor the dispensation of ordered \nprescription medications to inmates and  also for use in  keeping a record in the inmates MR of all \n18 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 19 of 129\nprevious months that controlled medications have been dispensed.  The MAR also  serves the \nHCSD-MD Physicians in  ascertaining if his/her patients are receiving the proper amount of \nmedications. \n(M) \nA review of the MAR in Plaintiffs MR reflect that from 02122/95  to 03/01196 Plaintiff did \nnot receive the prescribed seizure medication doses for  approximately one hundred and eighty \n(180) of the total amount of doses ordered by the HCSD-MD Physicians.  (See MAR attached as \nExhibits 33-47.)  The MAR was indicating the inconsistency in  dispensation by the HCSD-MD \nMed Cart Nurses.  The HCSD-MD Medical personnel were not doing the customary follow-up  by \nreviewing what the MAR was clearly indicating to all  the physicians and nurses who reviewed \nPlaintiffs MR.  Plaintiff as previously noted in this complaint on the use of medically restricted leg \nirons,  and for that reason at  all times in this complaint,  was easy to locate within the HC] 1301 \nFacility.  The use of leg irons prohibited Plaintiff from attending all jail activities except for the \ncompelled clinic and court appearances.  Even for the compelled appearances the HCSD-MD \npolicy,  procedure,  program and  plans provided that Plaintiff was to receive the seizure disorder \nmedication.  At no time during Plaintiffs incarceration from  2122/95  to 7112/96  is there a reason \nor excuse why the HCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses to not have dispensed to Plaintiff the daily \nprescribed AM.  and P.M.  seizure disorder medications as provided under the SNTP for seizure \ndisorders. \n(N) \nPursuant to the SNTP the second distinct  step for the HCSD-MD in the \"short and long \nteIm goals\"  of keeping Plaintiff as seizure free  as possible is  the objective of the type and \nfrequency of diagnostic testing to assure proper medication levels which is accomplished by blood \ntests of Plaintiff at  intervals of three (3) months.  In Plaintiffs particular case the drugs being tested \nfor are Phenobarbital and Phenytoin (Dilantin).  The blood test itself is  a uniform procedure used \nin  general medicine.  A  small  amount of blood is  drawn from Plaintiff and then tested for the \nPhenobarbital and Phenytoin (PIP) levels found  in the sample.  The tests are then reported in \nwriting on a HCSD-MD Laboratory (lab) Results form  under the Therapuetic Drugs column.  The \n19 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 20 of 129\nnm mal  ranges are numerically  15-40 for Phenobarbital and  10-20 for Phenytoin and are printed \non the form  near each respective drug.  (See lab  results attached as Exhibits 22-28) When lab \ntechnicians get a test result the numerical value is written on the provided line for each respective \ndrug tested.  Since the nOlmal  value ranges are printed adjacent to each respective therapuetic \ndrug,  the Lab Technician can tell at a glance whether the respective therapuetic drug level is  low, \nnOlmal,  or high.  Any value outside the nonnal range is  commonly referred to as a \"panic level\" \nand is  supposed to draw the attention of the attending physician.  By keeping the PIP  levels in the \nnomal ranges then would in effect meet the  SNTP goals of helping to keep Plaintiff as  seizure free \nas  possible. \n(0)  LAB RESULTS.  1)  On 3/30/95, Lab Results #1571  and #1572 showed that \nPlaintiffs PIP  levels were low enough for HCSD-MD Medical Director Dr.  Mike Seale to make \n·' \nthe 3/31/95 notation on the Lab fOlIn  that states,  \"Refer (Plaintiff) to M.D.  (medical doctor).\" \n(See 3/30/95 Lab Results attached as Exhibit 22)  Twelve (12) days later on 4/12/95, 1.  Fryer, \nW.e., set an appointment for Plaintiff for 4/19/95,  per Dr.  Seale's request and  notes  \"(See Lab \n• \nForm)\"  as the reason for the appointment.  (See 4112/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 4) The \n4119/95  M.D.  appointment was not kept by the HCSD-MD.  On 4114/95, Fryer set another \nappointment in place of the foregoing for 4/21/95 and this M.D.  appointment was also not kept by \nthe HCSD-MD, and in deliberate indifference to plainiffs serious medical needs,  and in violation \nof the HCSD-MD prescribed  SNIP for seizure disorders,  the HCSD-MD completely dropped any \nfurther attempts at following-up  on the Medical Directors orders to see that Plaintiff was \nmedically interviewed by a HCSD-MD Physician for the low PIP  levels.  2)  On 6/2/95, and over \ntwo months after the first  PIP  levels,  Lab Results #3128 and  #3129 showed that Plaintiffs PIP \nlevels were still  low enough for Dr.  Seale to make the 6/7/95  notation on the Lab form,  \"refer to \nM.D.\"  (See 6/2/95  Lab Results attached as Exhibit 23) On 6/8/95, 1.  Lewis,  W.C.,  set an \nappointment for Plaintiff to  see an M.D.  on 6/19/95.  (See 6/8/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit 7) \nThe 6119/95  M.D.  appointment was not kept by  the HCSD-MD.  On 6/13/95,1. Fryer, W.e.  set \nan appointment for Plaintiff to see an M.D.  on 6/20/95 at the request of Dr.  Seale and cites,  \" \n(See Lab form)\"  as the reference for the M.D.  appointment.  (See 6113/95  MR entry attached as \nExhibit  8)  The 6/20/95  M.D.  appointment was not kept by  the HCSD-MD in  deliberate \n20 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 21 of 129\n• \n• \nindifference to Plaintiffs serious medical needs and in violation of the HCSD-MD prescribed \nSNTP for seizure disorders,  the HCSD-MD completely dropped any further attempts to follow \nup on the Medical Director's second order to have Plaintiff seen by a doctor for the low PIP \nlevels.  These Lab Results document that the HCSD-MD knew beyond a doubt that Plaintiffs \nseizure disorder medication levels had been in the low panic range for nearly three months and yet \ntook no  action to get Plaintiff to an M.D.  3)  On 7/7/95, Lab Results #3128 and  #3129 showed \n• \nthat Plaintiffs PIP  levels were still  low enough for Dr.  Seale to make the 7/11/95  notation on the \nLab Form,  \"Refer to M.D.\"  (See 7/7/95 Lab Results attached as Exhibit 24) The Lab Form \nshows a handwritten notation by R  Washington,  W.C, that an  appointment had been scheduled \nfor Plaintiff for  7/18/95, but failed  to enter the reason ofthe appointment into Plaintiffs MR \nEleven (11) days later on 7/18/95,  Washington was unable to relate to the M.D.  who  saw Plaintiff \n.' \nwhat the appointment was originally scheduled for.  Plaintiff at this time was not privileged to any \nof his MR or Lab Results and  so could not infonll the M.D.  of why Dr.  Seales wanted the doctor \nto see the Plaintiff.  There is  no  mention of the low PIP  Lab Results documented in Plaintiffs MR \n, \nthat date.  (See 7/18/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 9) On  10/27/95 Lab Results #4938 and \n#4939 showed that Plaintiffs PIP  levels were low enough for Dr.  Seale to make the  10/30/95 \nnotation on the Lab  Form,  \"Refer to MD\"  (See  10127/95  Lab Results attached as Exhibit 25) \nThis is  the fourth  and  last attempt by Medical Director Dr.  Seale to have Plaintiff seen by a \nHCSD-MD Physician for the low PIP  levels,  which have now been documented as low for \napproximately eight (8) months.  On  10/31/95,1. Fryer,  W.C set an M.D.  appointment for \nPlaintiff at Dr.  Seale's request  for  1113/95.  (See  1113/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit  12) On \n11/3/95 1.  Lewis,  W.C documents calling the Fifth Floor of the HC] three (3) times to have \nPlaintiff brought to the  1301  Facility Clinic,  but the HCSD Deputies would not bring Plaintiff to \nthe clinic and  so  she reset the appointment to  1116/95.  (See  1113/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit \n12)  5)  On  1116/95  after four (4) attempts in eight (8) months the Plaintiff was interviewed by \nDefendant Dr.  Luu for his  low levels of the PIP  seizure disorder medications.  Plaintiff explained \nto Dr.  Luu that he was not being  dispensed a large part of the seizure disorder medications by the \nHCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses.  Dr.  Luu confirmed in the MAR that Plaintiff was telling the truth \nby looking at only one (1)  page of the MAR  In an unethical attempt to breakthrough the \n21 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 22 of 129\n• \n• \nincompetency of the Med Cart Nurses, Dr.  Luu nearly doubled the doses of seizure disorder \nmedications.  (See  1116/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit  12) On 1118/95  Dr.  Luu ordered Lab \nResults #5132 to ascertain the PIP  levels of the \"double dose treatment technique.\"  (See 1118/95 \nLab Results attached as Exhibit 26) Dr.  Luu failed  to take into consideration that at the time of \nthe  11/6/95  prescription that the HCSD-MD had  a policy,  procedure,  program or plan that filled \n\"new\"  prescriptions after two (2) days.  Thus the 12/8/95 Lab test came before the new double \ndose prescription had started.  Dr.  Luu nor Dr.  Seale made any notations on the Lab form \nconcerning the  11/8/95 Lab Results.  6)  On  1110/96 Lab Results #184, #185  showed that \nPlaintiffs PIP  levels were low.  Dr.  Guice initials the Lab Results.  (See  1/10/96 Lab Results \nattached as Exhibit 27)  Dr.  Guice notes the levels in Plaintiffs MR and orders a repeat test.  (See \n1/19/96 MR entry attached as Exhibit  18)  Plaintiff was not interviewed by Dr.  Guice on this \n.' \nmatter of the consistently low PIP  levels of Plaintiff  7)  On  1/30/96 Lab Results #540,  #541 \nshowed that Plaintiffs PIP  levels were low and Dr.  Guice initials the results but makes no entry \ninto the Plaintiffs MR concerning the test.  (See  1130/96 Lab Results attached as Exhibit 28) \n• \nPlaintiffs MR documents seven (7) blood tests taken to detellnine the proper PIP  levels and  all \ntests showed low results and outside the normal  range.  For approximately seven (7) months the \nPlaintiffs MR reflects that Medical Director Dr.  Seale was ordering M.D.  appointments for \nPlaintiffs serious medical condition.  Through incompetence and negligence, the HCSD-MD \nMedical personnel assigned this duty failed  to make the follow-up  on Dr.  Seale's orders.  This \ndeprivation of the doctor ordered appointments through deliberate indifference and callous \ndisregard brought about the continuing unnecessary suffering,  wanton infliction of pain and injury \nto Plaintiff through the continuing pattern and practice of the denial of adequate medical attention \nof the HCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses not consistently dispensing the prescribed seizure disorder \nmedication.  Had any of the many missed M.D.  appointments been kept Plaintiffs deprivation of \nthe prescribed medication could have come to light and thus a remedy to the problem could have \nbeen effected by the HCSD-MD. \n(P)  ADJUSTMENT OF MODALITY.  The HCSD-MI) was not monitoring the \nMAR nor following through with follow-up  medical  evaluations even when confronted with the \nlab result  of the Diagnostic Testing that indicated Plaintiffs blood levels of PIP  to be in the low \n22 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 23 of 129\n• \npanic range for one year in Plaintiffs case and therefore there could not have been any \n\"Adjustment of Treatment Modality\"  by the HCSD-MD. \n(Q)  In all  three major areas of the HCSD-MD SNTP for  seizure disorders in Plaintiffs \ninstant case,  the HCSD-MD failed  through incompetence, negligence and deliberate indifference \nto Plaintiffs serious medical needs to see that Plaintiff as a disabled person:  (a) received the \nproper amount of seizure disorder medication at the proper time;  (b)  that proper diagnostic \ntesting was performed on Plaintiff with the proper follow-up on any abnormal test results;  and (c) \nand to make the necessary adjustment in Plaintiffs treatment modality once the low blood test \nresults led to the conclusion that the HCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses were being derelict in their \nofficial medical duties.  Plaintiffs MR documents daily  seizure activity.  (See MR entries 4/3/95 \nattached as Exhibit 3;  6/9/95  attached as Exhibit 8;  2/8/96 attached as Exhibit  19)  Daily seizure \n.' \nactivity can be directly  contributable to the HCSD-MD not following  the HCSD-MD SNTP for \nSeizure Disorders.  The mental duress suffered and the physical pain and injury that has befallen \nPlaintiff by the HCSD-MD's failure  to follow the SNTP from  2122/95  to 7112/96,  was the \n• \nproximate result of Defendants T.  Thomas,  Berry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Howard, Phi and \nLuu's egregious failure  to follow the implemented steps and safeguards as provided for in the \nHCSD-MD SNTP for  Seizure Disorders.  This caused any and all  excessive amounts of seizure \nactivity for  over one (1) year in the HCJ and was the proximate result of Defendant's T.  Thomas, \nBerry,  Seale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Guice,  Phi and Luu's deliberate indifference to the serious  medical \nneeds of the Plaintiff amounting to the infliction of unnecessary pain and  and suffereing that \ndenied him  due process,  was cruel and unusual punishment and a denial of equal protection of the \nlaw that resulted  in Plaintiff being in  diminished  mental and debilitative physical states of health \nfor over one (1) year and during which time Plaintiff was compelled to stand federal  trial  in  Cause \nNo.  H-95-201  on November 29,  1995,  in  said states of health;  and all  of the foregoing in violation \nof Plaintiffs federally protected rights as  delineated  in the succeeding paragraphs. \n(R)  HERPES MISDIAGNOSISIDIABETES DIAGNOSIS  1)  On 2/22/95  when \nthe Plaintiff was admitted to the HCJ he was initially interviewed by the HCSD-MD and referred \nto the LBJGH Urology Staff for Dysuria,  Renal Calculi,  and  complaints of extreme back pain in \nPlaintiffs mid-back radiating to the groin.  (See 2/22/95 MR entries attached as Exhibits  1,50,51) \n23 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 24 of 129\n• \nAfter a deliberately indifferent interview by the LBIGH Urology Staff,  Plaintiff was returned to \nthe HCSD-MD, where complaints of physical pain and discomfort were treated with deliberate \nindifference.  He was medically cleared to be indifferently housed by HCSD-JD Classification \nSection Deputies in  Administrative cellblock 5B5-09.  2)  On 3/8/95 the two-week physical \nexamination was performed on Plaintiff and because Plaintiff had lost a large part of his vision,  it \nis  noted on the History and Examination Record that Plaintiff was having trouble with his vision \nand needed to see an Optometrist.  (See 3/8/95 History attached as Exhibit  56)  3)  The 3/30/95 \nPlaintiff's MR described that Plaintiff had sores and  a skin rash that would not heal.  (See 3/30/95 \nMR entry attached as  Exhibit 2)  It was also  stated by Plaintiff that he was still having trouble \nwith his vision this date.  4)  The 4/3/95 Plaintiff's MR describes sores that won't heal;  muscle \naches;  and chronic kidney stones.  Dr.  Guice,  from a mere visual  observation,  diagnosed the \n\" \nunhealing open sores as \"Herpes.\"  Dr.  Guice writes some prescriptions and ends the interview \nwith no  other follow-up  orders for diagnostic testing to verify if the sores/rash was in fact Herpes. \n(See 4/3/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 3)  5)  The 4114/95  Plaintiff's MR describes:  \"herpes \n• \ngetting worse;  states sores worse and dysuria.\"  Dr.  Trinh notes:  \"Here for gentiallesions, \ntreated for herpes\"  and offers the second opinion based  solely on visual observation, that the \ncondition is  a  \"probable chancroid.\"  Dr.  Trinh orders some medications and  ends the interview \nwith no follow-up  orders for diagnostic testing to determine what these sores/rash of nearly a two \n(2) month duration are.  (See 4114/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 5)  The 4/19/95 Plaintiff's MR \ndescribes:  \"Groin lesion appears unchanged.\"  Dr.  Guice orders some medications but makes no \nother follow-up  orders for diagnostic tests to detellnine what these sores/rash of two (2) months \nare  (See 4119/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit 6)  6)  On or about 8115/95,  Reverend Ronald \nCloutier, HCSD Catholic Chaplain made his first  attempt to obtain adequate medical attention for \nthe Plaintiff with the HCSD-MD, due to the overall appearance of Plaintiff with sores that would \nnot heal  and  a physical state that was indicative of declining health.  The HCSD-MD did not heed \nhis request for Plaintiffs MR is  silent to any action taken on behalf of Plaintiff by the HCSD-MD' \nthat date.  7)  The 8/28/95 Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"Swollen glands;  states he has swollen \nglands for  months;  painful urination;  left  side of testicles swollen,  reddish.\"  The doctor notes: \n\"swelling;  dysuria\"  and orders some medications but makes no other follow-up  orders for \n24 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 25 of 129\n.  . \ndiagnostic testing to deteIlnine the cause of the swollen glands,  sores and dysuria,  which has now \nbeen documented in the Plaintiffs MR for over half a year.  (See 8/28/95  MR entry attached as \nExhibit  10) The 9/26/95 Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"swollen testicles;  open sores on scrotal sac; \nalso nm.  (numerous) open sores\"  and makes a third guess diagnosis that this condition is \n\"epididimitis.\"  The doctor prescribes some medications but makes no follow-up  orders for \ndiagnostic tests to determine what is  causing the eight (8) month long condition of open sores that \nwill  not  heal.  (See 9/26/95  MR entry attached as Exhibit  11)  8)  On or about  10/02/95, Rev. \nRonald Cloutier made a second attempt to obtain treatment for Plaintiffs debilitated  condition of \nopen sores;  loss of vision and other symptoms that needed immediate medical attention from the \nHCSD-MD.  Rev.  Cloutier was unsuccessful in getting the HCSD-MD to treat Plaintiffs serious \nmedical needs,  for Plaintiffs MR is  silent this date to any medical help being forthcoming to the \n\"  Plaintiff from the HCSD-MD that month.  9)  The  11127/95  Plaintiffs MR describes:  \"Kidney \npain\"  which led  to the  12/05/95  appointment with Dr.  Guice who describes in Plaintiffs MR.: \n\"Kidney pain;  kidney stones;  overweight\" and orders some medications and for the first time in \n, \n• \nnine months of complaints,  orders a common urine test.  (See  11127/95  and  12/5/95 MR entries \nattached as Exhibit  14)  The Plaintiffs MR indicates the Urine Test Results were returned to Dr. \nGuice on  12/7/95  with the glucose at  336,  when the normal  range was 60-110.  (See  12/7/95 Lab \nResults attached as Exhibit 29)  10)  The  12/7/95 Plaintiffs MR describes that Plaintiff was \nbrought to the  1301  Facility Clinic based on the discovery of the high glucose level.  Dr.  Guice \nthen had a common glucose test of a \"finger stick\"  performed on Plaintiff which showed a high of \n380 which is  nearly three (3) times the normal level.  Dr.  Guice then told Plaintiff he was a \ndiabetic and  ordered some medications,  other follow-up  tests and  a diabetic diet for Plaintiff  (See \n12/7/95 MR entry attached as Exhibits  15,16)  Subsequent treatment with diabetic medications \nresulted in the sores on Plaintiffs body disappearing,  his glands became unswollen,  part of his \nvision returned,  the thirst for liquids and dysuria came under better control. \n(S)  TREATMENT OF DIABETES 1)  On  12/7/95, Dr.  Guice infonned Plaintiff that \nthe HCSD-MD would perform regular glucose testing on Plaintiff to monitor glucose levels in the \nPlaintiffs blood.  From  12/7/95 to 7112/96  only two such tests were performed.  (See  12/8/95 \nglucose test attached as Exhibit 30 and  1/6/96 glucose test attached as Exhibit 31)  2)  Dr.  Guice \n25 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 26 of 129\n• \nalso informed Plaintiff that the HCSD- MD would see that Plaintiff was placed on a diabetic diet. \nOn  12/19/95 Plaintiffs MR describes an interview with Ms.  C.  Nichols, RD.lLD. wherin Plaintiff \nwas placed on a diabetic diet.  (See  12119/95 MR entry attached as Exhibits  16,17)  From \n12119/95  to 7/12/96 Plaintiffs diabetic diet was sporadically delivered to Administrative \nSegregation cellblock 5B 5 -0 1.  Plaintiff was compelled by HC SD Deputies to accept a regular \nmain  line diet when his  diabetic diet· was not forthcoming to the fifth floor of the HC] 1301 \nFacility.  On 3120/96 Plaintiff wrote a letter to Ms.  Nichols seeking administrative reliefin \nobtaining his  ordered diabetic diet.  There was no  response to Plaintiff from Ms.  Nichols office. \n3)  Plaintiffs attorney, Mr.  Thomas Bevans,  directed a 4117/96  letter to US. Marshal,  AI Solis \nwith service copy to Sheriff Thomrny Thomas.  This letter addressed the overall continuing decline \nof Plaintiffs general health but was never answered by the HCSD-Administration.  (See 4117/96 \nBevans letter attached as Exhibit 74)  4)  On 6/4/96,  in  an  interview at the  1301  Facility Clinic, \nPlaintiff stated to Medical Director, Dr.  Mike Seale since the diagnosis of diabetes on 217/95  that \nsubsequently a medically needed diabetic diet had been ordered but the full  benefits of the diet had \n• \nnot been realized,  as often diet trays were not delivered and/or scheduled sandwiches and milk \nwere stolen by inmate floor workers and that the HCSD Deputies of the fifth  floor of the HC] \n1301  Facility were apathetic and did  not intervene in  such thefts or provide proper supervision \nover meal  distribution to the inmates housed in Administrative Segregation cellblock 5B5-01.  Dr. \nSeale asked Plaintiff had  a grievance been filed  in the matter and Plaintiff produced the 3/20/96 \nletter directed to Ms.  C.  Nichols, RD.IL.D.  and which was referenced  \"Dietary needs not being \nmet  by HCSD.\"  Dr.  Seale said that the Nichols letter (written two months prior) had as yet \ncrossed his desk.  Dr.  Seale suggested to Plaintiff to file  a grievance on the matter for the \npreparation and delivery of diets was beyond his controL \n(T)  The causative factors  in Plaintiffs misdiagnosis of Herpes and the resultant \nsuffering with uncontrolled diabetes for over nine (9) months are 1)  The failure  of the HCSD-MD \nto  set and  keep scheduled medical  doctor appointments with Plaintiff;  2)  The failure of the \nHCSD-MD to follow policy,  program,  procedure or plans in  the treatment of open wounds and \nsores that will  not heal as was in Plaintiffs case;  3)  The failure of the HCSD-MD physicians of \nupon seeing the open soreslrash that would not  heal that was accompanied by chronic swollen \n26 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 27 of 129\n• \nglands to order diagnostic testing or to have referred Plaintiff to a hospital in the HCHI) to \ndetermine the cause of these symptoms;  4)  The failure of the HCSD-MD physicians to order any \nfollow-up  treatment for Plaintiff's disease of a nine (9) month duration,  such as appointments to \nsee if the chronic condition had come under control due to the effectiveness of their last medical \norders and  respective treatment plans;  5)  The failure  of the HCSD-MD physicians to adequately \nread Plaintiff's MR and note that the unhealed open sores had plagued Plaintiff for months and \nhad been visually misdiagnosed three separate times (Herpes,  Chancroids, Epiditimitis)  and to \nthereby have ordered lab tests in a timely manner;  6)  The failure  of the HCSD-MD physicians, \n• \ndue to all  the foregoing,  to properly diagnose one of the most common diseases of diabetes, \nespecially in the light of all  the symptoms that were readily present and visible in Plaintiff's case, \ni.e,  dysuria,  excessive thirst,  unhealed  sores,  and loss of vision;  7)  The failure  of Lyndon B . \n• \n• \nJohnson General Hospital to have given adequate medical attention to Plaintiff on 2/22/95 and the \nfailure to have ordered follow-up  appointments for examinations and tests as the Plaintiff had a \nreadily indentifiable medical  history of genitourinary and thyroid problems prior to 2/22/95. \n(U)  This inadequate medical treatment by Defendants T.  Thomas, Berry,  Seale, Quinn, \nTrinh,  Chassay,  Guice,  Howard,  Phi,  Luu,  and Wilson has  resulted in that Plaintiff suffered \nmentally for nine (9) months thinking he  had contracted an incurable social disease; and  suffered \nthe physical  loss of vision and  the painful covering of sores and the internal discomfort of swollen \nglands and  organs for  months due to the extensively long period of time that Plaintiff endured the \nuncontrolled disease of diabetes and as a result  his  vision did  not completely return to normal and \nPlaintiff now walks with a cane due to poor circulation and resultant numbness to the lower legs. \nAll  of this  pain,  suffering and  injury was the proximate result of Defendants T.  Thomas,  Berry, \nSeale,  Quinn,  Trinh,  Chassay,  Guice,  Howard, Phi,  Luu and Wilson's deliberate indifference to the \nserioius medical needs of the Plaintiff that denied him due process,  was cruel and unusual \npunishment and a denial of equal  protection of the law that resulted in Plaintiff being in diminished \nmental and debilitative states of health for over nine (9) months and during which time Plaintiff  . \nwas compelled to stand federal  trial in  Cause No.  H-95-201  on November 29,  1995,  in  said states \nof health;  and all  of the foregoing  in  violation of Plaintiff's federally  protected rights delineated in \nthe succeeding  paragraphs. \n27 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 28 of 129\n• \n• \n(V)  ADMINISTRA TIVE REMEDY - MEDICATIONS AND MEDICAL \nATTENTION \nPlaintiff,  with the disability as a life long epileptic,  was aware that the needed medications \nwere not being properly dispensed to him by the HCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses.  The Defendants \ndocumented into Plaintiff's MR a year long effort by the Plaintiff to verbally,  through letters, \nfamily phone calls,  personal intervention by a HCSD Catholic Chaplain,  and by grievance \nprocedures to seek from the HCSD both informal and formal  administrative remedy and relief in \nefforts to obtain adequate medical  care and specifically the serious medical need of receiving the \nmuch needed epilepsy medications as  an accomodation to his  disability at the proper time each \nday.  These informal and fOllnal  attempts by the Plaintiff and  others acting on his behalf are as \nfollows:  1)  On 3/12/95 Plaintiff was taken to the  1301  Facility Clinic where he informed Dr. \nChassay that  in  the first  twenty (20) days of incarceration in  the HC} that he had not been \ndispensed twenty-two separate AM and P.M.  doses of epilepsy medication by the Med Cart \nNurses.  (See 2/22/95  MAR attached as Exhibit 33) Dr.  Chassay ordered a double dose (600mg.) \n• \nofDilantin be given to Plaintiff for a makeup remedy.  (See 3/12/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit \n2) Though the MAR substantuated Plaintiffs complaint of the twenty-two (22) missing doses,  Dr. \nChassay made no note in  the MR,  was not concerned about the potentially dangerous situation \nand with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs serious medical needs,  returned Plaintiff to \nAdministrative Segregation Cellblock 5B5.  2)  On 4/3/95 Plaintiff was taken to the  1301  Facility \nClinic where he infOlmed  Dr.  M.  Guice that he had missed  a lot of his  epilepsy medication.  Dr. \nGuice documented in  the record \" ... 8-9 day of meds x  30 days.\"  (See 4/3/95 MR entry attached \n= \nas Exhibit 3) Dr.  Guice  had Plaintiffs MR before him and  should have looked at the MAR of \n2/22/95  (Exhibit  33) and he would have realized that in  the first  twenty-eight (28) days of the \nSNTP for  Seizure Disorders that Plaintiff  had not been dispensed thirty-four (34)  separate doses \nof the A.M.  and P.M.  Seizure Disorder Medications by the Med Cart Nurses.  Dr.  Guice noted 8-9 \ndays had been missed and then made no further entry into Plaintiffs MR about medical concerns  . \nto this deliberate indifference by the Med Cart Nurses to dispense prescribed Seizure Disorder \nMedications correctly.  3)  On 6/1/95 and 6/13/95  Plaintiff complained to Nurse O'Quinn that he \nwas not getting his  Seizure Medications as ordered.  (See Daily Segregation Rounds Record \n28 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 29 of 129\n• \nattached as Exhibit 48) Plaintiff had been in the HC] approzimately one-hundred and eleven (111) \ndays and the MAR for this period showed the nurses had failed to dispense to Plaintiff sixty (60) \nseparate doses of the prescribed Seizure Disorder Medications.  On 6/14/95 Nurse K.  Howard, \nL VN,  responding to Plaintiffs complaint to Nurse O'Quinn of 6/13/95 deliberately made a  false \nentry into Plaintiffs MR that date that stated\" Pt (patient) has received all  doses of this med \n(medication).\"  It is clear that Nurse Howard was basing such a  conclusion of the review of the \nMAR in Plaintiffs MR which indicated that there were sixty (60) of the missed doses  of  Seizure \nmedication.  (See 6/14/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit 9  and compare to MAR attached as \nExhibits 33-38) Plaintiffs MR demonstrates that it is this same Nurse Howard that documented \nthe 3/12/95 interview with Dr. Chassay (Exhibit 2).  The interview where the \"double dose\"  of \nSeizure Medications were given to Plaintiff to make up for the twenty-two (22) doses that were \n.' \nmissed in the first  twenty (20) days of incarceration.  Nurse Howard's own documentation into the \nrecord of the 3/12/95 interview states awareness and knowledege of Plaintiffs problem in not \nreceiving the proper amount of doses of seizure medication.  The 6/14/95  entry signals an \"at all \n• \ncost\" conspiracy to cover up any wrong doing or medical neglect by the HCSD-MD in the \nprevious months.  4)  On 6/8/95  and between the two complaints of Plaintiff to Nurse O'Quinn of \n6/1/95  and 6/8/95, Plaintiff was interviewed by Nurse K.  Howard wherein it was documented into \nthe Plaintiffs MR that \"meds (medications) being missed by Med Cart Nurse \"and\"  missed meds \nmedications.\"  (See 6/8/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit 7) Nurse Howard felt  on 6/8/95 that the \nproblem was serious enough to warrant Plaintiff seeing a Medical Doctor and so requested in the \n6/8/95 entry.  Six (6) days later this is the same Nurse Howard who stated in Plaintiffs MR in \nreply to Plaintiffs complaints that \"patient has received all  doses of this medication.\"  5)  On \n6/9/95 Plaintiffs MR reflects he had a  seizure and was carried by stretcher to the  1301  Facility \nClinic where he was seen by W.  Nelson, L VN.  Nurse Nelson documented into the MR that \nPlaintiff was having seizure activity in Administrative Segregation due to not getting the \nprescribed  Seizure Disorder Medications. Nurse Nelson referred Plaintiff to Defendant Dr.  A.  Phi \nto whom Plaintiff repeated the same complaint about not receiving all  the epilepsy medications in \na  routine manner by the Med Cart Nurses.  Dr.  Phi stated that this was something he could not \ncontrol and he sent Plaintiff back to Administrative Segregation without making any references to \n29 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 30 of 129\n• \nthe source of the complaint.  Dr.  Phi's entry into Plaintiffs MR is  directly below Nurse Nelson's \nentry on the same page yet Dr.  Phi's entry is  void  of any comment of the possible wrongdoing of \nthe other HCSD-MD personnel.  (See 6/9/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit 8)  6)  On  or about \n8/15/95  Reverend Ronald Cloutier,  HCSD Catholic Chaplain,  and due to the overall appearance \nof Plaintiff that was indicative of declining health,  personally interceded with the HCSD-MD to \nobtain adequate medical attention for the Plaintiff HCSD-MD personnel did not heed his request, \nfor Plaintiffs MR is silent as to any action taken on behalf of Plaintiff by the HCSD-MD this date. \nThe MAR of Plaintiffs MR reflects on this date that Plaintiff had been deprived of ninety-six (96) \nseparate doses of his ordered seizure medication by the HCSD-MD Med Cart Nurses.  7)  On \n8/23/95  Plaintiff sent a letter to the HCSD-MD Hospital Administrator that stated\" ... sent multiple \nrequests ... \" some of which concerned his seizure disorder medications not being properly \n.' \ndispensed by the HCSD-MD nurses and\" I have become increasingly ill while your department \nhas been indifferent to my  valid needs.\"  Plaintiff at the time of this letter was being made to wear \nthe medically  restricted leg irons that had a crippling effect,  was stilI  untreated for the original \n• \nkidney complaint,  had been deprived  of ninety - six (96) doses of epilepsy medications in a six \nmonth period,  was covered in open sores that would not heal,  and looked so physically \ndeteriorated that a Catholic Chaplain was alarmed enough to make a personal trip to the 1301 \nFacility Clinic on Plaintiff's behalf to obtain adequate medical  attention for his serious medical \nneeds.  All  of which caused Plaintiff to write his first  letter for  assistance to the Hospital \nAdministrator (Defendant Major M. W.  Quinn).  Plaintiffs letter was not answered by  the Hospital \nAdministrator.  There is  evidence that the 8/23/95  letter invoked the concern of Mr. John \nGoodejohn who answers grievances for the HCSD-MD Administration.  8)  On 8/25/95 Mr. \nGoodejohn filled  out a \"Complaint Reply Form\"  (CRF) and  placed it in Plaintiffs MR without \ngiving Plaintiff a copy.  (See 8/25/95  CRF attached as Exhibit 68)  The CRF blatantly falsified the \nfacts of Plaintiffs treatment by  stating \"Inmate has received care consistent to special needs \ntreatment  plan for  seizure disorder ... \" signed by Mr. Goodejohn and most condemnably of all by \nHCSD-MD Medical Director Mike Seale who noted \"Reviewed; agree with above\" who also \nsigned the CRF.  On the date of Dr.  Seale's agreement with Mr.  Goodejohn that the SNTP for \nPlaintiffs seizure order had been met the Plaintiffs MAR in their respective possession for review \n30 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 31 of 129\n• \nindicated there had been one-hundred (l00) missed seizure medication dispensations in Plaintiff's \ncase in  one-hundred and eighty-three (183) days of incarceration.  9)  On 9/20/95 Plaintiff having \nu.s. \nnot received adequate medical attention by the HCSD-MD wrote a letter to  Marshall Ray \nBright which was made part of Plaintiffs MR.  (See 9120/95  Bright letter attached as Exhibit 69) \nThe letter stated the ongoing pattern and  practice of deliberate indifference to the serious medical \nneed of Plaintiff and listed that Plairitiffhad written seven (7) Inmate Requests and three (3) \ngrievance letters to the HCSD-MD in  the seven (7) months of his incarceration (2/22/95-9/20/95) \nand as  to that date had  not received adequate medical attention from the Defendant's.  10)  On or \nabout  10/2/95  Rev.  Ron Cloutier,  HCSD Catholic Chaplain made a second attempt to obtain \nadequate medical care,  for Plaintiffs physical condition was  visually growing worse.  As with the \nfirst  attempt on 8115/95,  he again failed  to obtain the needed medical care for  Plaintiffs serious \nmedical needs from  the HCSD-MD.  11)  On  11/6/95, Plaintiff was taken to the  1301  Facility \nClinic to be interviewed by Defendant Dr.  Luu.  Plaintiff had been called by Dr.  Luu in reference \nto a lab test that showed Plaintiffs blood to have low levels of the needed  Seizure Disorder \n• \nmedications Dilatin (phenytoin) and  Phenobarbital.  (See  10/27/95 Lab results attached as Exhibit \n25) Plaintiff referred Dr.  Luu to the MAR sheets in his MR that on that date indicated one \nhundred and twenty-two (122) missed doses of these prescribed medications.  (See MAR attached \nas Exhibit 33-43)  Dr.  Luu reviewed the MAR and then noted in Plaintiffs MR that his  \"review \n(ot) records pt.  (patient) missed his  med.  (medications).\"  Dr.  Luu stated to Plaintiff that he could \nnot make the HCSD-MD nurses consistently deliver Plaintiffs medications because this was an \narea out of his  control.  In a dangerous and  highly illegal and unethical patchwork medical \ntreatment plan,  Dr.  Luu said that the only medical  procedure he could utilize to overcome the \nnegligent and  incompetent Med Cart Nurses not consistently dispensing AM. and P.M.  seizure \ndisorder medications was to double the daily doses and  perhaps the extra over-medication process \nwould  make up for the missed medications.  Dr.  Luu then doubled the Phenobarbital to an AM. \nand P.M.  delivery and added and extra 200mg.  ofDilantin in the P.M.  to the existing 300mg. \nA.M.  dosage.  (See  11/6/95 MR entry attached as Exhibit  12)  This practice was extremely \ndangerous for the Plaintiff then found  himself at times overmedicated.  Ovennedication can,  like \nundellnedication,  trigger seizure activity.  With Dr.  Luu's unethical treatment plan,  Plaintiff found \n31 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 32 of 129\n• \nhimself on a  \"Roller-coaster ride\"  of under,  nonnaI,  and ovennedicated days that lasted from \n11/6/95 to 7/12/96.  12)  On or about  12/1195, Plaintiff having been denied  medical treatment by \nhaving missed six (6) doctors appointments at the HCSD-MD  1301  Facility Clinic (See medical \nrecords entries at:  4/12/95 attached as Exhibit 4;  4/14/95 attached as Exhibit 5;  6/19/95 attached \nas Exhibit  7;  6120/95  attached as Exhibit 8;  1113/95 attached as Exhibit  12;  12/01195  attached as \nExhibit  13) through incompetent scheduling and follow-up  by HCSD-MD personnel then filed \ngrievance #95-1083  against  1.  Lewis,  W.e.  (ward clerk),  HCSD-MD, who in the presence of \nPlaintiff deliberately cancelled the  12/01195  scheduled doctor's appointment and then misled  the \nPlaintiff by saying that  she would recall him to the  1301  Facility Clinic later that date to see the \ndoctor.  The recall appointment was not forthcoming and this was a deliberate pattern and \npractice of the HCSD MD of denying Plaintiff adequate medical care as demonstrated by the five \n.' \n(5) previous recall appointments of 4112/95  thru  11103/95  that also were not forthcoming as is \ndocumented in Plaintiffs MR.  13)  On 3113/96,  U.S.  Marshall Lisa Griffis  sent a fax  of a \nGovernment Memorandum to Major M. W.  Quinn and Linda Parker, HCSD-MD, requesting them \n• \nto look into complaints concerning Plaintiffs medications.  (See 3/13/96 memorandum attached as \nExhibit  70) Six (6) days later on 3/19/96 Plaintiff was seen by Dr.  Guice who makes no  entry in \nPlaintiffs MR about missed  seizure disorder medications.  (See 3/19/96 MR entry attached as \nExhibit 21)  The MAR in  Plaintiffs MR indicated that one-hundred and eighty (180) separate \ndoses of seizure disorder medications had been missed by the Med Cart Nurses in approximately \none year.  14)  On 4/15/96,  in  answer to Plaintiffs attorney's letter of 4/08/96, Major K. W.  Berry \ndirected a letter to Plaintiffs attorney that stated  \" This office will  have an  immediate \nreview .... medical needs ....  if there is  a need ... make special  arrangements ..... due to medical \nreasons.\"  (See 4/15/96 Berry letter attached as Exhibit  75) Service copy was sent to Major M.  W. \nQuinn-Hospital Administrator,  HCSD-MD.  The Plaintitrs MR  demonstrates the ill will  and \ndeliberate indifference of Berry and Quinn  had towards the disabled Plaintiff and  his  serious \nmedical  needs in  this systematic,  arbitrary and  capricious denial  of medical attention, in that the \nnext  entry in Plaintiffs MR is  5/24/96,  and that for a blood test wherein he did  not  see a HCSD \nMD Physician.  Had Major Berry or Major Quinn reviewed Plaintitrs MR on 4/15/96,  as the \nBerry letter suggests,  they would have found  that  the disabled Plaintiff was being made to wear \n32 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 33 of 129\nthe medically restricted leg irons,  that a number of M.D.  appointments had been scheduled and \nnot kept,  and that the MAR indicated over one-hundred and  eighty (180) missed doses of seizure \ndisorder medication in Plaintiffs case.  15)  On 4/17/96,  Plaintiffs attorney sent a second letter to \nUS. Marshal,  Al  Solis in  support of his first  letter of 4/08/95  citing Plaintiffs declining health and \nhis epileptic condition.  (See 4/8/96 and  4117/96 Bevans letters attached as Exhibits  73,74) \nNeither the US. Marshal's service nor the HCSD gave any  kind  of response of relief to Plaintiffs \nserious medical  needs  as a disabled  person.  16)  On 6/4/96,  Plaintiff was taken to the  l301  Facility \nClinic wherein the Plaintiff spoke at  two separate interviews with Defendants Dr.  M.  Seale and \nDr.  A  Phi,  concerning his  low blood levels of Phenobarbital and Phenytoin.  At  each interview the \nPlaintiff showed both doctors in the MAR that he  had  missed about ninety (90) days  and  one \nhundred and eighty (180) doses of the  seizure medications and  not being able to consistently \n• \n•  receive the seizure medications prescribed pursuant to the  SNTP on seizure disorders was the \nprobable cause for  the blood tests to regularly show low levels of these medications.  Dr.  Seale nor \nDr.  Phi made any suggestions or offered any remedies how this medical problem of not receiving \n•  the prescribed seizure medications from  the Med Cart Nurses could be solved.  (See 6/4/96 \naffidavit attached as Exhibit  76)  17)  The foregoing  sixteen (16) references portray Plaintiff,  and \nothers acting on the behalf of Plaintiff,  making persistent and  reasonable efforts to obtain his \nneeded  seizure disorder medication for  sixteen (16) months.  It is  remarkable that the Defendants \nthemselves documented  into Plaintiffs MR.  eleven (11) entries pertaining to where Plaintiff either \nspoke with HCSD-MD doctors and  nurses; wrote letters; had administrative replies  placed in the \nMR.;  or U  S.  Marshal's sent fax  messages.  Outside the .MR is Plaintiffs grievance #95-1083  and \nPlaintiffs attorney's two letters of 4/8/96 and 4117/96 and the two personal attempts by Fr.  Ron \nCloutier.  All  these concerted efforts to  break through the medical neglect and deliberate \nindifference to the serious medical  needs of the Plaintiff by the HCSD-MD that resulted in the \nsuffering and  wanton infliction of pain and  callous disregard  for the health and  well being of the \nPlaintiff. \nv. \nLEGAL CLAIMS \n33 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 34 of 129\n• \n(A)  The facts  related above disclose a concerted and systematic effort by the \nDefendants and their agents to deprive Plaintiff of constitutionally guaranteed rights,  privileges \nand immunities,  including,  but not limited to,  those enumerated in the succeeding paragraphs; \nVI. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION· \n(A)  The Defendants T.

Hall. \nMr.  Hall is presently incarcerated in the Harris County Jail under Spin 00615184, \nUSM#38261-079 and  housed in  Cell Block 5-B-5.  Since Mr. Hall has been incarcerated he has \ndeveloped diabetes,  has developed problems with his feet  and has been given a cane to walk \nbecause of swelling of his feet.  Mr. Hall  has also  developed  problems with his  achilles tendon. \nThe purpose of this letter is to request that Mr. Hall's feet  not be shackled while being \ntransported by the U.  S.  Marshall service and/or within the Harris County Jail. \nOn each occasion that I have visited Mr. Hall in  the Harris County Jail  his feet  have been \nshackled when moving from his  cell to the area in which attorney visits are held. \nMr. Hall  has an  escaped attempt in the past,  some 20 years ago.  Mr.  Hall is  an  \"old con,\" \n\"he knows the drill\"  and  if we treat Mr.  Hall  with common courtesy and give him the respect due \nhim,  he will  respond  in  kind.  I do not believe Mr. Hall is  an escape risk,  therefore I believe the \nuse of shackles are not necessary in the Harris County Jail  and/or in transporting Mr. Hall.  I \nrequest that feet  shackles not be used  on Mr.  Hall and that your office convey this request to the \nproper authorities in  the Harris County Sheriffs Office.  , \n, \nI \nI \n! \n, \nThank you  for your time and cooperation. \nYours, \n:1 \nI \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 122 of 129\nEXHIBIT \nIcc:  U.

Hall \nCR H-95-201 \n/ \nMy File #95-\nDear Mr. Solis: \nPlease make reference to my letter of which a copy is attached. \nOn 4/15/96 I visited Mr.  Hall  at the Harris County Jail  at which time his feet  were again in \nshackles. \nMr. Hall entered the Harris County Jail  on 2/22/95.  On or about  12/5/95 after numerous \ncomplaints concerning his health Mr. Hall was diagnosed a diabetic.  The diabetes is in addition to \nhis seizure disorder and hyperthyroidism. \nWhen Mr. Hall entered the Harris County Jail  his weight was 228 pounds and his weight \nlast recorded in his medical record on 3/19/96 was 278 pounds. \nMr. Hall does not look well to me.  I am not a  medical  doctor but it is generally known \nthat a diabetics blood sugar should be monitored on a regular basis,  some diabetics blood sugar is \nmonitored daily and some more than once daily.  Since Mr.  Hall was diagnosed a diabetic on \n12/5/95 his medical record reflects that his blood sugar was monitored on two occasions. \nBased on the fact that Mr. Hall is an epileptic,  has hyperthyroidism and has been \ndiagnosed a diabetic I don't belive he  should be housed in an isolation cell  5-B-5-1  but should be \nhoused on a medical floor and/or medical facility.  Your office is responsible for the case of Mr. \nHall  and you have contracted this responsibility away to the Harris County Sheriffs Office.  Mr. \nHall  is not receiving proper medical care in the Harris County Jail.  lfthe Harris County Sheriffs \nOffice cannot provide Mr.  Hall  proper medical care I ask that he be transferred to a Federal \nMedical facility. \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 124 of 129\nEXHIBIT \nPage 2 \nThank you for your time and cooperation. \nYours, \ngj. \nTJBlhg \nenclosure \nIcc:  U.

Section \n39, 103  definitions, \nMEDICAL INTERVIEW \nOn June 4,  1996, atnant was taken from Administrative Segregation Cell block 5B5-0 1 to \nthe HCSD-Medical Division clinic located on the second floor of the HCSD,  1301  Franklin Jail \nFacility (1301  Facility),  Upon arrival  at the clinic affiant was placed in a  curtained inmate patient \ninterview area in the main room of the clinic. \nStanding nearby were,  Dr.  M.  Seale,  HCSD Medical Director, and Mr.  Andrew Johnson, \nthird year medical student - University of Texas,  Dr.  Seale and Mr.  Johnson had  affiant's medical \nrecord (MR) open and Dr.  Seale was explaining to Mr.  Johnson that affiant's last blood test,  taken \nby C.D,  Ware,  LVN, on 5/24/96,  had came back with phenobarbital and phenytoin (epilepsy \nseizure medications) below normal levels and near and  in  the panic value ranges,  Since the  low \nlevels of this type test have been a sixteen month long problem,  apparently Dr.  Seale was going to \nhave Mr.  Johnson talk with affiant about this ongoing problem. \nAffiant  asked to talk with Dr.  Seale that he might shed light on the source of the problem \nof the chronic low drug levels of seizure medications,  Dr.  Seale was shown by affiant that the \nAdministrative Medical Records (AMR) in  affiant's MR showed that the probable cause of the \nlow test results was that in  the previous year period that the HCSD-Medical Division Drug Cart \nNurses,  who dispense controlled medications,  had not been delivered for approximately ninety \n(90) of those days and which represented approximately one-hundred and  eighty (180) doses of \nseizure medication.  After reviewing an AMR page, that confirmed the 90 day/180 dose scenario, \nDr,  Seale was at  a loss to explain how the medical  record supported affiant's claim,  and made no \nsuggestions or offered any remedies how the problem might be resolved by his  office, \nAffiant then  related to Dr.  Seale that on 3/8/95,  Dr.  0, Klein,  M.D,  had signed orders that \naffiant not be made by the HCSD to wear leg irons because of a bilateral achilles tendon operation \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 1    Filed in TXSD on 03/18/97   Page 128 of 129\nEXHIBIT \nperformed on affiant  by Ben Ie Ib  Hospital  in  1971)  P  fiant  then related to Dr.  Seale that after \nthe written order Dr.  Klein had  tnrgot to follow  up  an(  fill  out  a \"Special Needs Advisement.\" \nThis resulted in  affiant  having t  ' wear leg  irons fnr the  )revious sixteen( 16) months and which \nwas a contributing factor in  affi  lOt  having to walk wid  the  assistance of a cane.  Dr.  Seale was at \na loss to explain the reason Dr.  Klein  had failed  to foH(  w  up with the  Special Needs Advisement \nand  which resulted in  needless  .ain to affiant. \nAffiant further explained to  Dr.  Seale that the l\\1R documented for ten months affiant was \nerroneously treated for a \"herpes\"  condition that was based solely on visual  diagnosis with no \nsupporting diagnostic testing.  The misdiagnosed herpes condition could not be brought under \ncontrol until by accident  it  was discovered that affiant  was,  and  had been for the previous two \nyears,  suffering from  diabetes.  Dr.  Seale was at  a loss  to explain why affiant  had  not  received \nproper medical  tests so  as the HCSD Medical Division  could have reached the correct diagnosis \nand  have  prevented needless pain and  suffering to affiant. \nAffiant finally  stated to Dr.  Seale that  since the diagnosis of diabetes on  1217/95  that a \nmedically ordered diabetic diet  had been ordered but the full  benefits of the diet  had not been \nrealized  as  often diet  trays were not delivered  and/or scheduled  sandwiches and  milk were stolen \nby  inmate floor workers and that the floor deputies were apathetic and did not intervene in  such \nthefts.  Dr.  Seale asked affiant  had  he  filed  a grievance in  the matter.  Affiant  produced a March \n20,  1996 letter written to Ms.  C.  Nichols,  R.D.lL.D.  and is  referenced  \"Dietary needs not being \nmet by  HCSD.\"  Dr.  Seale said that the Nichols' letter had as of yet  crossed his  desk.  Dr.  Seale \nsuggested to affiant to file  a grievance on the matter for the preparation and delivery of diets was \nbeyond his  control. \nDr.  Seale left  and Mr.  Johnson  came over to talk to affiant concerning the low test results \nof seizure medications.  Again affiant  referred Mr.  Johnson to the AMR and the 90  day/I80 dose \nvariable of missing  seizure medications.  Mr.  Johnson candidly agreed that  in  his opinion that this \nwould certainly be the cause for  low blood levels of seizure medications in the test results. \nDr.  Phi  (pronounced Fee) came quickly over and took the interview away from Mr. \nJohnson.  Dr.  Phi  was then  shown the AMR with the 90 day/I 80  dose variable of missing \nmedications.  To drive the point  home  affiant  produced a \"Laboratory Results - Therapeutic \nDrugs\"  example page that  give the average offive similar tests on blood levels for  seizure \nmedications dated  3/30/95 to  11/08/95 that all  tested out for low blood levels of seizure \nmedication due to the lack of affiant  not  receiving the prescribed medication.  Dr.  Phi was unable \nto expalin why  affiant  did  not at  times  receive his  legally  prescribed medication while  housed in \n5B5-01  of the Harris County Jail. \nAffiant  explained to Dr.  Phi that Dr.  Luu had doubled the doses of seizure medication on \n1116/95,  in  an  attempt to  \"break through\"  and overmedicate affiant enough to compensate for the \nirregularly delivered  seizure medication.  Dr.  Phi  pointed out that such a policy of overmedication \nbrings on high toxitity that can bring on seizures and therefore can be as  harmful as  affiant  not \nreceiving enough medication.  Dr.  Phi inquired what affiants present  daily  seizure rate was that \nwas being experienced.  Affiant  stated daily  petite mol  and irregular grand mol  seizuires.

THOMAS, et al  § \nDefendants.  § \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nOF MAJOR MICHAEL QUINN \nIN HIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \nDefendant Major Michael  W.  Quinn (\"Major Quinn\"),  in his  individual  capacity,  now files  his \nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment  pursuant  to  Rule  56,  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  and  would \nrespectfully show this Court as follows: \nBACKGROUND \n1.  This  is  an action brought pursuant to 42  U.S.  C.  section 1983  by Plaintiff Robert Arthur \nHall  (\"Plaintiff'),  a  former  federal  prisoner  in  the  Harris  County  Jail.  Plaintiff,  alleges  that  Major \nQuinn  violated  his  constitutional  rights  by  improperly  classifying  him,  by  not  rendering  adequate \nmedical care, and by requiring him to wear leg  irons.  Plaintiff also  apparently asserts a claim pursuant \nUs.c. \nto  the  Americans  With  Disabilities  Act,  42  12111,  ct.  seq  (\"the  ADA\").  Plaintiff has  sued \nMajor Quinn in both his official and individual capacities. \n2.  Major  Quinn  is  entitled  to  judgment  on  Plaintiffs  Section  1983  against  him  in  his \nindividual  capacity because  Plaintiff has  failed  to  meet the  heightened pleading  standard required  as  a \nresult of Major Quinn's assertion of the qualified immunity defense,  and because Plaintiff has failed to \nI : WQRD611\\M EB\\H ALL WQ-M-D I S\\6] 2 70(O( I() )\\b;Jr\\KI2KftJ 7  1 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 2 of 10\nallege that Major Quinn was personally involved in the constitutional deprivation.  Major Quinn is also \nentitled to judgment on Plaintiffs ADA claim because  an individual  may  not be  held  liable  under the \nADA  and  because  his  qualified  immunity  shield  defeats  Plaintiffs  cause  of  action.  There  is  no \ngenuine issue of material fact,  and Major Quinn is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nTHE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \n3.  A  movant  seeking  a  summary judgment in  federal  court must initially  inform the  court \nof the  basis  for  his  motion  and  point  out  those  portions  of the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to \ninterrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file  which  demonstrate  the  absence  of a  genuine  issue  of material \nfact  and show that he  is  entitled to judgment as  a matter of law.  See  FED.  R.  CIv.  PRO.  56(C  );  Celotex \nCorp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317,  323  (1986).  The  movant need  not negate  the  opposing party's claims \nnor produce  evidence  showing  an absence  of a  genuine  factual  issue,  but  may  rely  on the  absence  of \nevidence to  support essential elements of the opposing party's claims.  See International Association of \nMachinists  &  Aerospace  Workers,  Lodge No.  2504 v.  Intercontinental Mfg.  Co.,  812  F.2d 219,222 (5 th \nCir.  1987). \n4.  The  burden  then  shifts  to  the  non-movant  to  set  forth  specific  facts  and  competent \nsummary judgment evidence to  raise a  genuine  issue of material  fact  on each essential  element of any \nclaim  on  which  he  bears  the  burden  of proof at  trial.  FED.  R.  CIv.  P.  56(c).  The  substantive  law \ngoverning the  suit identifies the essential  elements of the  claims at issue and therefore  indicates which \nfacts  are  material.  See  Anderson v.  Liberty Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  248  (1986).  The  non-moving \nparty  may  not  rest  on  mere  allegations  or  denials  in  his  pleadings  but  must  produce  affirmative \nevidence and specific facts.  Anderson, 477 U.S.  at 256-56.  He meets this burden only ifhe shows that \nI: WQRD(,O\\MEB\\HALL \\MQ·M -0 I 5\\63 27 0«( )110 )\\bar\\KI2 Kl97 \n2 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 3 of 10\na  \"reasonable jury could return a verdict for the  non-moving party\".  A  mere  scintilla of evidence will \nnot preclude granting of a motion for summary judgment.  Id.  at 252. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES \nA.  Plaintiffs Section 1983  Claim \n5.  Plaintiff  contends  that  Major  Quinn,  in  his  individual  capacity,  violated  his \nconstitutional  rights  by  improperly  classifying  him,  by  not  rendering  adequate  medical  care,  and  by \nrequiring  him  to  wear  leg  irons.  The  distinction  between  a  suit  against  a  government  official  in  his \nindividual  capacity  and  one  in  his  official  capacity  is  not  merely  a  pleading  device.  Rather,  the \ndistinction  impacts  the  requirements  for  pleading  and  proving  a  cause  of action.  See  Hafer  v.  Melo, \n502  U.S.  21,112  S.  Ct.  3581,116 L.Ed.2d  301  (1991);  Kentucky  v.  Graham,  473  U.S.  159,  105  S.Ct. \n3099, 87 L.Ed.2d  114 (1985). \n6.  When a plaintiff sues a public official under Section  1983, the district court must \nth \ninsist on heightened pleading from  the  Plaintiff.  See Morin  v.  Caire,  77  F.3d  117,  121  (5 Cir.  1996), \nth \nciting Schultea v.  Wood,  (\"Schultea II\")  47 F.3d  1427 (5 Cir.  1995) (en banc).  The Fifth Circuit held \nin  Morin  that  the  Court  \"...  must  first  demand  that  a  plaintiff file  a  short  and  plain  statement  of his \ncomplaint, a complaint that rests on more than conclusions alone.\"  Morin at 121. \n7.  Further,  because  individual  capacity  suits  seek  to  impose  personal  liability  on \npublic officials for actions taken under color of law, they can only be established by a showing that the \nofficial,  acting  under  color of law,  caused  the  deprivation  of a  federal  right.  Graham,  supra.  Thus, \nMajor  Quinn can only  be  found  liable  in his  individual  capacity  if he  were  personally  involved  in the \nacts  causing  a  deprivation  of Plaintiffs constitutional  rights,  or if a  causal  connection  exists  between \nhis  acts  and  a  constitutional  violation.  See  Baker  v.  Putnal,  75  F.3d  190,  199  (5 th  Cir.  1996); \nI:WORD60\\MEB\\HALL\\MQ-M.DIS\\(,3270(IK)())\\bar\\8128197 \n3 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 4 of 10\nth \nThompkins  v.  Belt,  828  F.2d  298  (5 Cir.  1987).  Plaintiffs  Complaint  does  not  make  either of these \nshowings, and should be dismissed for  those reasons. \n8.  First,  Plaintiff  has  completely  failed  to  comply  with  the  Fifth  Circuit's \nrequirement that he present a specific,  factual  pleading which gives fair  notice of the  basis upon which \nPlaintiff  seeks  to  hold  Major  Quinn  liable.  While  Plaintiffs  extremely  voluminous  and  repetitive \ncomplaint  mentions  Major  Quinn,  the  allegations  are  of a  highly  conclusory  nature,  which  is  clearly \ninadequate  under  Morin  and  Schultea  II.  Plaintiff mentions  Major  Quinn  in  the  factual  allegations \nsection of the  Complaint in  five  places.  He  contends that  Major Quinn:  (1)  engaged  in  a  pattern and \npractice  of  not  following  up  on  written  medical  orders  and  instructions  by  incompetent  medical \npersonnel  (page  17);  (2)  egregiously  failed  to  follow  the  steps  and  safeguards  for  the  treatment  of \nseizure  disorders  (page  23);  (3)  provided  inadequate medical  treatment of sores  (page  27);  (4)  did  not \nanswer a  letter written  by  Plaintiff (page  30);  and  (5)  received a fax  from  the  United  States  Marshal's \nOffice  and  a  copy  of a  letter  from  Plaintiffs attorney  (page  32).  Plaintiff does  not  allege  that  Major \nQuinn,  whom  he  describes  in  the  Complaint as  the  Hospital  Administrator,  treated  any  of Plaintiffs \nmaladies,  that  he  himself  directed  certain  treatment,  withheld  treatment  or  failed  to  follow  up  on \nmedical  instructions.  He  does  not allege  the  manner in which Major Quinn was  allegedly  involved  in \nproviding  inadequate  medical  treatment of sores  or seizure disorders.  Additionally,  he does  not allege \nthat a causal connection exists between Major Quinn's conduct and the constitutional violation. \n9.  The  Complaint  is  devoid  of any  allegation  whatsoever  that  Major  Quinn  was \npersonally  involved  with  determining  Plaintiffs  classification  status.  Similarly,  Plaintiff makes  no \nspecific  allegations  as  to  the  manner  in  which  Major  Quinn  was  involved  in  the  requirement  that  he \nwear  leg  irons,  although  he  pleads  in  a  conclusory  manner  that  Major  Quinn  was  deliberately \nI: WOR[)()O\\MEB illALL \\MQ-M- D JS  \\(,J 2 70(000 )lbar\\HI2 K/'J7 \n4 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 5 of 10\nindifferent to his condition.  This is simply unacceptable under the heightened pleading standard set out \nby the Fifth Circuit in Schultea IL  and Major Quinn is  entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \n10.  In addition to  the  above,  Major  Quinn's qualified  immunity  shield protects  him \nfrom any  liability.  Government officials performing discretionary functions  are  shielded from  liability \nfor  civil  damages  insofar  as  their  conduct  does  not  violate  \"clearly  established  statutory  or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. \nth \n800,  102  S.  Ct.  2727, 2738,  73  L. Ed.  2d 396 (1982); Jacquez v.  Procunier,  801  F.  2d 789, 791  (5 Cir. \nth \n1986);  Elliot v.  Perez,  751  F.  2d  1472,  1477 n.  13  (5 Cir.  1985). \n11.  A two  step analysis  is  employed when applying the qualified immunity defense. \nSiegert v.  Gilley,  500 U.S.  226,  111  S.  Ct.  1789,  1793,  114  L.  Ed.  2d  277  (1991);  Salas  v.  Carpenter, \n980  F.  2d  299,  305  (5 th  Cir.  1992).  The  court  first  determines  whether  the  plaintiff has  alleged  the \nviolation of a clearly  established constitutional or statutory right.  Siegert,  111  S.  Ct.  at  1793; Salas  at \n305;  King  at  656.  If  so,  the  court  analyzes  whether  the  defendant's  conduct  was  objectively \nunreasonable,  because  \"even  if an  official's  conduct  violates  a  constitutional  right,  he  is  entitled  to \nqualified immunity if the  conduct was  objectively reasonable.\"  Salas,  at  305-6.  Whether the  conduct \nof which  a  plaintiff complains  violated  clearly  established  law presents  an  essentially  legal  question. \nMitchell v.  Forsyth,  472  U.S.  511,  105  S.  Ct.  2806,  86 L. Ed.  2d 411  (1985).  Officials and officers  are \nimmune from  suit unless the law clearly proscribes the action they took.  Mitchell,  105  S.  Ct.  at 2816. \n12  Although  Plaintiff s  claim  is  inadequate  under  the  heightened  pleading \nrequirement  set  out  by  the  Fifth  Circuit,  Plaintiff  has  alleged  the  violation  of  clearly  established \nconstitutional  rights.  The analysis  then proceeds to  a  determination of the  objective reasonableness of \nthe conduct. \nI :W   ORD()II\\MEB \\HALL \\MQ-M -0 I S\\6:1 2 71  )\\bar\\KI2K/IJ 7 \n)(1)11()  5 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 6 of 10\n13.  As  set  forth  above,  Plaintiff  alleges  broadly  that  Major  Quinn  provided \ninadequate  medical  treatment  for  his  seizure  disorder  and  sores,  that he  failed  to  follow  up  on written \nmedical orders and instructions, and that he received copies of certain correspondence.  Plaintiff cannot \nshow, however, that Major Quinn's conduct was objectively unreasonable because he cannot show that \nMajor  Quinn  engaged  in  any  specific  conduct.  Plaintiffs  broad  allegations  about  Major  Quinn's \ndeliberate  indifference  are  unsupported.  His  conduct  can  thus  not  be  shown  to  be  objectively \nunreasonable. \n14.  Similarly,  Plaintiff claims broadly that  Major Quinn was  deliberately  indifferent \nto  his  proper classification  status  and  to  the  requirement  that  he  wear  leg  irons.  However,  he  raises \nabsolutely no  facts  which would establish that deliberate indifference on either claim.  Because there  is \nno  conduct to  analyze from  an objective reasonableness  standard,  Major Quinn is  entitled to judgment \nas  a matter of law by  virtue of his qualified immunity shield. \nB.  Plaintiffs ADA Claim \n15.  Plaintiff also argues that his rights and this case arise under the ADA.  Title II  of \nthe  ADA generally prohibits discrimination against the  disabled by  public entities.  However,  whether \nthe  provisions  of the  ADA  apply  to  a  county jail  is  not  clear.  See  Torcasio  v.  Murray,  57  F.3d  1340 \nth \n(4 Cir.  1995)  (Any rights which inmates may have under the ADA were not clearly established at  the \ntime of suit since Congress has  not specifically  stated that the  ADA applies  to  prisons and since  courts \nare  in  disagreement  over  the  ADA's  application  to  prisons);  Garrett  v.  Anselone,  940  F.  Supp.  933 \n(W.D.  Va  1996) (Defendants'  conduct did  not violate  any clearly established right under the  ADA and \nDefendants are  entitled to  qualified immunity.)  While there  is  other case law which might support the \napplication  of the  ADA  to  the  Harris  County  Jail,  there  is  no  authority  in  the  Fifth  Circuit  which \nI: WORD60\\MEB\\HAL L\\ MQ·M·D  I 8\\6] 2 71 1(001 I) \\bar\\X12X/97 \n6 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 7 of 10\ndirectly  addresses  this  issue.  Major  Quinn  asserts  that  the  provisions  of Title  II  of the  ADA  do  not \napply to the Harris County Jail. \n16.  Even  assuming  that  the  ADA  applies  to  the  Harris  County  Jail,  however,  there \nare  two  reasons  Plaintiffs ADA claim against Major Quinn  should be  dismissed.  First,  the  law under \nTitle I of the ADA does not permit an action against an individual employee.  The law under Title II  of \nthe  ADA  should  be  consistent  with  this  principle.  Alternatively,  Major  Quinn's  qualified  immunity \nshield  bars  any  recovery  by  Plaintiff against  him  in his  individual  capacity.  Each of these  points  will \nbe considered in turn. \n17.  The  courts  have  held  under  Title  I of the  ADA that the  ADA provides  only  for \nemployer  liability,  and  not  for  individual  liability.  See  Mason  v.  Stallings,  82  F.  3d  1007  (lIth  Cir. \n1996)  (county  commissioners  could  not  be  held  liable  in  their  individual  capacities  for  ADA \nviolations);  Fernandez  v.  Community  Asphalt,  Inc.,  934  F.  Supp.  418  (S.D.  Fla.  1996)  (suit  against \nindividuals  is  not allowed  under Title  VII,  the  ADEA,  or the  ADA).  This  principle  of liability  should \nbe applied consistently to  an action under the ADA's Title  II.  The ADA claim against Major Quinn in \nhis individual capacity should thus be dismissed. \n18.  In  analyzing  the  application  of Major  Quinn's  qualified  immunity  shield  to  the \nassertion of a  statutory right,  the  Court undertakes  the  two  step analysis  set  out Siegert,  inquiring  first \nwhether  there  has  been  an  allegation  of a  clearly  established  constitutional  or  statutory  right.  In  this \ncase,  there  is  no  violation by  Major Quinn of a  clearly  established statutory right.  Plaintiff apparently \nasserts his status as  a disabled person under the ADA is based on his alleged chronic kidney condition, \nepilepsy, depression,  and hyperthyroidism  Any rights  Plaintiff may have under the ADA with regard \nI. \nPlaintiff repeatedly contends throughout the Complaint that he  had the condition of hyperthyroidism.  Plaintiffs medical \nI \nrecords clearly  indicate that his condition was hypothyroidism. \nI:WORO(nl\\MEB\\HALL\\MQ-M-DlS\\(IJ27IJ(I'OIJ)\\b<lr\\X/2'dN7  7 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 35    Filed in TXSD on 08/28/97   Page 8 of 10\nto  the  application  of the  ADA  to  a  county jail  facility  were  not  clearly  established  at  the  time  of the \nincidents  made  the  basis  of Plaintiffs  lawsuit,  and  are  not  established  at  this  time.  See  Torcasio; \nGarrett,  supra.  Where there  is no  violation of a clearly established statutory right,  qualified immunity \napplies,  and operates to be Plaintiffs ADA claim. \nCONCLUSION \n19.  There  is  no  genuine  issue  of material  fact  on  Plaintiff s  claims against  Major Quinn in \nhis individual capacity, and Major Quinn is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw. \nWHEREFORE,  PREMISES  CONSIDERED,  Defendant Major Michael  W.  Quinn respectfully \nprays  that  this  Court  grant  him  summary judgment  on  Plaintiffs  claim  against  him  in his  individual \ncapacity, and for  such other and further relief which to this Court shall seem just and proper. \nRespectfully submitted, \nMICHAEL P.

H-97-874 \nVS. \n§ \nSHERIFF TOMMY B. THOMAS, et al  § \nDefendants.  § \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nOF SHERIFF TOMMY B. THOMAS \nIN HIS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY \nDefendant  Sheriff Tommy  B.  Thomas  (\"Sheriff  Thomas\"),  in  his  individual  capacity, \nnow  files  his  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  pursuant  to  Rule  56,  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure, and would respectfully show this Court as  follows: \nBACKGROUND \n1.  This  is  an  action  brought pursuant to  42  U.S.C.  Section  1983  by  Plaintiff Robert \nArthur Hall (\"Plaintiff'), a former inmate of the Harris County Jail.  Essentially, Plaintiff alleges \nthat Sheriff Thomas violated his constitutional rights by improperly classifying him,  by requiring \nthe  use  of leg  irons,  and  by  denying  him  adequate  medical  care.  Plaintiff also  asserts  a  claim \npursuant to the Americans With Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),  42  U.S.C.  12111  et.  seq.  Plaintiff has \nsued Sheriff Thomas in both his official and individual capacities. \n2.  Sheriff Thomas  is  entitled  to  judgment  on  Plaintiffs  claims  against  him  in  his \nindividual  capacity.  First,  Plaintiff has  not  plead  his  case  against  Sheriff  Thomas  with  the \nstandard of specificity required in a case,  as this  one,  in which the  Sheriff Thomas has raised his \nI ' WO  R [)60\\ME8\\HAL L \\I T- M-D IS\\(.) 27 0(1 KMI )\\bar:NI2MjI)7 \n1 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 2 of 9\nqualified  immunity  defense.  Second,  Plaintiff is  not entitled to  proceed  against  Sheriff Thomas \non the basis of respondeat superior, and Plaintiff has not alleged the personal  involvement which \nwould be required to hold Sheriff Thomas personally liable under Section 1983.  Additionally the \nADA  is  not  applicable  to  individuals.  Finally,  Sheriff  Thomas'  qualified  immunity  shield \nprotects him from both Plaintiffs Section 1983  and his ADA claim.  There is no genuine issue of \nmaterial fact,  and Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nTHE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD \n3.  A  movant seeking a  summary judgment in federal  court must  initially  inform the \ncourt  of the  basis  for  his  motion  and  point  out  those  portions  of the  pleadings,  depositions, \nanswers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file  which  demonstrate  the  absence  of a  genuine \nissue  of material  fact  and  show that  he  is  entitled  to judgment as  a  matter  of law.  See  FED.  R. \nClY.  PRO.  56(c);  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317,  323  (1986).  The  movant  need  not \nnegate  the  opposing  party's  claims  nor  produce  evidence  showing  an  absence  of  a  genuine \nfactual  issue,  but  may  rely  on  the  absence  of evidence  to  support  essential  elements  of the \nopposing  party's  claims.  See  International  Association  of Machinists  &  Aerospace  Workers, \nth \nLodge No.  2504 v.  Intercontinental Mfg.  Co.,  812 F.2d 219,222 (5 Cir.  1987). \n4.  The burden then shifts to the non-movant to  set forth  specific facts  and competent \nsummary judgment evidence to  raise a genuine issue of material fact on each essential element of \nany claim on which he  bears the  burden of proof at trial.  FED.  R.  CIY.  P.  56(c).  The substantive \nlaw  governing  the  suit  identifies  the  essential  elements  of the  claims  at  issue  and  therefore \nindicates  which  facts  are  material.  See  Anderson  v.  Liberty  Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  248 \n(1986).  The  non-moving  party  may  not  rest  on mere  allegations  or denials  in  his  pleadings  but \nI :W  ORD61 hMEB \\HALL \\ IT· M·Di S\\(.] 2711( 11011 )\\bar: H12X/t)7 \n2 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 3 of 9\nmust produce affirmative  evidence  and  specific  facts.  Anderson, 477  U.S.  at  256-56.  He meets \nthis  burden  only  if he  shows  that  a  \"reasonable jury  could  return  a  verdict  for  the  non-moving \nparty\".  A  mere  scintilla  of evidence  will  not  preclude  granting  of a  motion  for  summary \njudgment.  Jd.  at 252. \nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES \nA.  Plaintiffs Section 1983  Claim \n5.  The distinction between the suit against a government official in his or her \nindividual  or  official  capacities  is  not merely  a pleading  device.  Rather,  the  distinction  impacts \nthe requirements for pleading and proving a cause of action.  See Hafer v.  Melo,  502 U.S.  21,  112 \nS.  Ct.  3581,  116  L.Ed.2d  301  (1991);  Kentucky  v.  Graham,  473  U.S.  159,  105  S.Ct.  3099,  87 \nL.Ed.2d  114 (1985). \n6.  When  a  plaintiff sues  a  public  official  under  Section  1983,  the  district \ncourt  must  insist  on  heightened  pleading  from  the  Plaintiff.  See  Morin  v.  Caire,  77  F.3d  117, \nth  th \n121  (5 Cir.  1996),  citing  Schultea  v.  Wood,  (\"Schultea  II\")  47  F.3d  1427  (5 Cir.  1995)  (en \nbanc).  The Fifth Circuit held in Morin that the Court\" ...  must first  demand that a plaintiff file  a \nshort  and  plain  statement  of his  complaint,  a  complaint  that  rests  on  more  than  conclusions \nalone.\"  Morin at  121. \n7.  Because  individual  capacity  suits  seek  to  impose  personal  liability  on \npublic officials for actions taken under color of law, personal liability in Section  1983  actions can \nonly  be  established  by  a  showing  that  the  official,  acting  under  color  of  law,  caused  the \ndeprivation of a federal  right.  Graham,  supra.  Further, Sheriff Thomas can only be found  liable \nin  his  individual  capacity  if he  were  personally  involved  in  the  acts  causing  a  deprivation  of \nI : WORD60\\MEB\\HAL L \\I  T- M-DlSV,:\\ 2 70(tKM) )\\bar: !'I/2K/'n  3 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 4 of 9\nPlaintiff s  constitutional  rights,  or  if  a  causal  connection  exists  between  his  acts  and  a \nth \nconstitutional  violation.  See  Baker  v.  Putnal,  75  F.3d  190,  199  (5 Cir.  1996);  Thompkins  v. \nth \nBelt,  828  F.2d 298 (5 Cir.  1987). \n8.  Plaintiffs  Complaint  does  not  make  either  of  those  showings.  First, \nPlaintiff has  completely  failed  to  comply  with  the  Fifth  Circuit's  requirement  that  he  present  a \nspecific, factual  pleading which gives fair notice of the basis upon which he seeks to hold  Sheriff \nThomas  liable.  Morin  at  121.  In  the  factual  allegations  portion  of the  Complaint,  Plaintiff \nmentions  Sheriff Thomas  eight times,  alleging  that  he:  (1)  engaged  in  a  pattern and practice  of \nthe  hiring  of unqualified  personnel  to  work  in  classification  (page  8);  (2)  engaged  in a  pattern \nand practice, based on negligence, to omit or overlook medical  data (page  11)1;  (3)  inadequately \ntreated  Plaintiffs  kidney  condition  from  February  22,  1995  to  July  12,  1996  (page  12);  (4) \nreceived  copies  of two  letters  to  the  United  States  Marshal's  office  from  Plaintiffs  counsel \nregarding Plaintiffs complaints (page  15);  (5)  failed  to  protect Plaintiff from  discrimination due \nto  his  disability  (page  16);  (6)  engaged  in  a pattern and  practice  of not  following  up  on  written \nmedical  instructions  by  incompetent medical  personnel  (page  17);  (7)  failed  to  follow the  steps \nand  safeguards  necessary  for  the treatment  of seizure  disorders  (page  23);  and  (8)  inadequately \ntreated Plaintiffs sores (page 27). \n9.  What  is  most  noteworthy  about  Plaintiffs  allegations  against  Sheriff \nThomas  is  what  he  does  not  allege.  Plaintiff  does  not  allege  that  Sheriff  Thomas  himself \noverlooked medical  data,  or recommended,  provided,  or  withheld  medical  treatment,  whether as \nSheriff Thomas is  entitled to judgment on this issue,  as to establish deliberate  indifference, a plaintiff must present \nI \nfacts tending to demonstrate actual  knowledge or awareness of the serious medical need on the part of the named \ndefendant.  See Farmer v.  Brennan,  51  I U. S.  825,  I 14  S.  Ct.  1970,  128  L.  Ed. 2d 81  I (1994). \noou \n1-WOR [)60\\MEB \\H AL L\\  IT- M-O IS  \\ (.12701  )\\bu' Xml/1J7 \n4 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 5 of 9\nto  Plaintiffs  kidney  condition,  seizure  disorder,  or  sores.  He  also  does  not  allege  that  Sheriff \nThomas was  involved in any manner in his alleged improper classification, or in the requirement \nthat  Plaintiff wear  leg  irons.  Plaintiff has  failed  to  allege  the  type  of personal  involvement \nnecessary to  hold Sheriff Thomas individually liable.  Baker at  199. \n10.  When Plaintiff s allegations about Sheriff Thomas are examined, it is  clear \nthat  he  is  seeking  to  hold  Sheriff Thomas  liable  on  respondeat  superior  grounds.  However,  a \nsupervisor  such  as  Sheriff  Thomas  cannot  be  held  vicariously  liable  for  the  actions  of  a \nth \nsubordinate under Section  1983.  See  Doe  v.  Taylor lSD,  15  F.3d 443,454-55  (5 Cir.  1994)  (en \nbane). \n11.  In  addition,  Sheriff Thomas'  qualified  immunity  shield protects  him  from \nany liability.  Government officials performing discretionary functions  are  shielded from  liability \nfor  civil  damages  insofar  as  their  conduct  does  not  violate  \"clearly  established  statutory  or \nconstitutional  rights  of which  a  reasonable  person  would  have  known.\"  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald, \n457  U.S.  800,  102  S.  Ct.  2727,  2738,  73  L.  Ed.  2d 396  (1982);  Jacquez  v.  Procunier,  801  F.  2d \nth  th \n789,791  (5 Cir.  1986); Elliotv.  Perez, 751  F.  2d  1472,  1477 n.  13  (5 Cir.  1985). \n12.  A  two  step  analysis  is  employed  when  applying  the  qualified  immunity \ndefense.  Siegert v.  Gilley,  500 U.S.  226,  111  S.  Ct.  1789,  1793,  114 L.  Ed.  2d 277 (1991); Salas \nth \nv.  Carpenter,  980 F.  2d 299,305 (5 Cir.  1992).  The court first determines whether the plaintiff \nhas  alleged the violation of a clearly established constitutional  or statutory right.  Siegert,  111  S. \nCt.  at  1793; Salas at 305;  King at 656.  If so, the  court analyzes whether the defendant's conduct \nwas  objectively reasonable,  because \"even if an official's conduct violates  a  constitutional  right, \nhe  is  entitled to  qualified  immunity  if the  conduct was  objectively  reasonable.\"  Salas,  at  305-6. \nI : WOR[)6U\\M EB \\HALL \\ IT- M-DI 5\\612 70(OOU )\\bnr KJ2 Ki97  5 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 6 of 9\nWhether the  conduct of which a  plaintiff complains  violated  clearly  established  law presents an \nessentially legal  question.  Mitchell v.  Forsyth,  472  U.S.  511,105  S.  Ct.  2806,  86 L.  Ed.  2d 411 \n(1985).  Officials and officers  are  immune from  suit unless  the  law clearly proscribes the  action \nthey took.  Mitchell,  105  S.  Ct.  at 2816. \n13.  Although  Plaintiffs  claim  is  inadequate  under  the  heightened  pleading \nrequirement  set  out by the  Fifth Circuit,  Plaintiff has  alleged the  violation of clearly  established \nconstitutional  rights.  Having  met  that  standard,  the  Court  must  determine  the  objective \nreasonableness of the conduct.  Salas at 305-6. \n14.  Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that  Sheriff Thomas'  conduct was objectively \nunreasonable  because  he  cannot  demonstrate  that  Sheriff  Thomas  engaged  in  any  specific \nconduct at  all.  Plaintiff s  claims  against Sheriff Thomas are broad and conclusory.  With regard \nto  his  deprivation  of medical  care  claim,  Plaintiff cannot  show  that  Sheriff Thomas  provided \ninadequate treatment, or that he personally failed to follow up on written medical orders. \n15.  Similarly,  Plaintiff claims  broadly  that  Sheriff Thomas  was  deliberately \nindifferent  to  his  proper  classification  status  and  to  the  requirement  that  he  wear  leg  irons. \nHowever,  he  raises  absolutely  no  facts  which  would  establish  that  deliberate  indifference  on \neither  claim.  Because  Plaintiff  has  alleged  no  specifics,  there  is  no  conduct  which  can  be \ndetennined  to  have  been  objectively  unreasonable.  Sheriff Thomas  is  entitled  to  judgment  on \nPlaintiffs Section  1983  claims by virtue of his qualified immunity shield. \nB.  Plaintiffs ADA Claim \n16.  Plaintiff also  argues  that  his  rights  and  this  case  arise  under  the  ADA. \nTitle  II  of the  ADA  generally  prohibits  discrimination  against  the  disabled  by  public  entities. \nI: WORO(IO\\MEB\\H ALL \\I T•  M·O I S\\6~ 27 { )(01 H) )\\bar: KI2K/Y7  6 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 7 of 9\nHowever,  whether the provisions of the  ADA  apply to  a county jail is not clear.  See  Torcasio \nv. \nMurray,  57  F.3d  1340 (4th  Cir.  1995)  (Any rights  which inmates may have  under the ADA were \nnot clearly established at the time of suit since Congress has not specifically stated that the ADA \napplies  to  prisons  and  since  courts  are  in disagreement  over the  ADA's application  to  prisons); \nGarrett v.  Anselone,  940  F.  Supp.  933  (W.D.  Va  1996) (Defendants'  conduct did not violate any \nclearly  established  right  under  the  ADA  and  Defendants  are  entitled  to  qualified  immunity.) \nWhile  there  is  other  case  law  which  might  support  the  application  of the  ADA  to  the  Harris \nCounty Jail,  there is no  authority in the  Fifth Circuit which directly addresses this issue.  Sheriff \nThomas asserts that the provisions of Title II  of the ADA do not apply to the Harris County Jail. \n17.  Even  assuming  that  the  ADA  applies  to  the  Harris  County  Jail,  however, \nthere  are  two  reasons  Plaintiff s ADA claim against  Sheriff Thomas  should be  dismissed.  First, \nthe  law under Title I of the ADA does not permit an  action against an individual employee.  The \nlaw  under  Title  II  of the  ADA  should  be  consistent  with  this  principle.  Alternatively,  Sheriff \nThomas'  qualified  immunity  shield  bars  any  recovery  by  Plaintiff against  him  in  his  individual \ncapacity.  Each of these points will be considered in tum. \n18.  The courts have held under Title I of the ADA that the ADA provides only \nfor  employer  liability,  and  not  for  individual  liability.  See  Mason  v.  Stallings,  82  F.  3d  1007 \n(11 th  Cir.  1996) (county commissioners  could  not  be  held  liable in their individual  capacities for \nADA violations);  Fernandez v.  Community Asphalt,  Inc\"  934  F.  Supp.  418  (S.D.  Fla.  1996) (suit \nagainst  individuals  is  not  allowed  under  Title  VII,  the  ADEA,  or  the  ADA).  This  principle  of \nliability  should  be  applied  consistently  to  an  action  under  the  ADA's  Title  II.  The  ADA  claim \nagainst Sheriff Thomas in his individual capacity should thus be dismissed. \nI: WORD(.( I\\MEB\\H ALL \\ IT•  M -D 15\\6:1 17( I(oe II I) \\bar: K!2K/Y7 \n7 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 8 of 9\n19.  In analyzing the application of Sheriff Thomas'  qualified immunity  shield \nto  the  assertion  of a  statutory  right,  the  Court  undertakes  the  two  step  analysis  set  out Siegert, \ninquiring  first  whether  there  has  been  an  allegation  of a  clearly  established  constitutional  or \nstatutory  right.  In  this  case,  there  is  no  violation  by  Sheriff Thomas  of a  clearly  established \nstatutory  right.  Plaintiff apparently  asserts  his  status  as  a  disabled  person  under  the  ADA  is \n2\nbased on his  alleged chronic kidney  condition, epilepsy,  depression,  and hyperthyroidism Any \n• \nrights  Plaintiff may  have  under the  ADA  with regard  to  the  application of the  ADA to  a  county \njail facility  were  not clearly  established  at the  time  of the  incidents  made  the  basis  of Plaintiff s \nlawsuit,  and  are  not  established  at  this  time.  See  Torcasio;  Garrett,  supra.  Where  there  is  no \nviolation of a  clearly  established statutory right,  qualified  immunity applies,  and  operates to  bar \nPlaintiffs ADA claim. \nCONCLUSION \n20.  There  is  no  genuine  issue  of material  fact,  and  Sheriff  Thomas  is  entitled  to \njudgment as a matter oflaw on Plaintiffs claims. \nWHEREFORE,  PREMISES  CONSIDERED,  Defendant  Sheriff  Tommy  B.  Thomas \nrespectfully  prays  that  this  Court  grant  him  summary judgment,  and  for  such  other  and  further \nrelief which to  this Court shall seem just and proper. \nPlaintiff repeatedly contends throughout the Complaint that he had the condition of hyperthyroidism.  Plaintiffs \n2 \nmedical records clearly indicate that his condition was hypothyroidism. \nI:  WOR D('O\\'MEB\\HAL L\\  IT· M·D IS\\{,] :2 711(1 MM I ) \\bar: >l12K/I)7 \n8 \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 36    Filed in TXSD on 08/29/97   Page 9 of 9\nRespectfully submitted, \nMICHAEL P.

R.  Civ.  P.  file  this  motion  for  summary  judgment  in  the  above \nreferenced case.  In support thereof,  Defendants would show as follows: \nI. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiff,  Robert Arthur Hall,  a fonner prisoner confined in  the Harris County Jail in Houston, \nTexas,  filed  this  lawsuit  pursuant  to  42  U. S. C.  §  1983. 1  In  this  action,  Plaintiff claims  that  the \nDefendant  doctors  violated  his  Eighth  Amendment  right  to  be  free  from  cruel  and  unusual \npunishment,  in  that  the  doctors  were  deliberately  indifferent  to  Plaintiff's  serious  medical  needs. \n2 \nPlaintiff sues the Defendants in both their official and individual  capacities.\nPlaintiff states he was arrested on a federal parole violator warrant and placed in the Harris County Jail as \nI \na federal prisoner on February 21,  1995.  Plaintiffs Original Complaint, p.  5. \nDuring the period of time relevant to Plaintiff's allegations,  the Defendants were employed by the University \n2 \nof Texas Health Science Center at Houston Medical School (UT-H MS) and were providing medical services to inmates \nin the Harris County Jail pursuant to a contract between UT-H MS and Harris County. \n1 \nRC   Lllhall. msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 2 of 246\nPlaintiff s voluminous complaint asserts what is  essentially four  separate claims of deliberate \nindifference against the Defendant doctors.  First,  Plaintiff claims that the doctors failed to provide \nhim with adequate medical  care for  a  chronic kidney  condition.  Second,  Plaintiff alleges that the \ndoctors were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs because Plaintiff did not receive all  of his \nseizure  medications  from  the  medical  cart  nurses.  Third,  Plaintiff claims  that  he  had  a  medical \nrestriction against wearing leg restraints and that certain Defendant doctors failed to prevent security \npersonnel from  forcing  Plaintiff to wear leg  irons in  violation  of this  medical  restriction.  Finally, \nPlaintiff complains  that  an  open  sore  was  mis-diagnosed  as  \"herpes\"  when  in  fact  Plaintiff was \nsuffering from diabetes. \nIn  their  original  answers,  the  Defendants  have  denied  Plaintiff's  allegations  of deliberate \nindifference and have asserted their entitlement to qualified immunity. \nII. \nMOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nPursuant toPED. R.  CIv. P.  56(b),  Defendants now move for summary judgment.  Plaintiff's \nallegations are insufficient to carry his evidentiary burden of establishing a genuine issue of material \nfact for trial. \nIII. \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE \nDefendants attach the foHowing  as  summary judgment evidence: \nExhibit A - Affidavit of Dr.  Michael  Seale. \nExhibit B - Plaintiff's Harris County Sheriff's Department medical records. \n2 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 3 of 246\nIV. \nSPECIFIC CLAIMS \nIn  his  original  complaint,  Plaintiff makes  the  following  specific  allegations  of deliberate \nindifference against the individual Defendant doctors. \nA.  Chronic Kidney Condition \nPlaintiff claims that when he was placed in  the Harris County Jail,  he was suffering from  a \nchronic kidney condition.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  5.  Plaintiff claims that from February 22, \n1995, to July 12,  1996, doctors Seale, Trinh,  Guice, Phi,  and Luu failed to provide him with adequate \ntreatment for this alleged serious medical problem.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  12. \nPlaintiff  finds  particular  fault  with  Dr.  Trinh,  claiming  that  Dr.  Trinh  was  deliberately \nindifferent to this serious kidney condition because he did  not order a follow-up  exam after referring \nPlaintiff to LBJ  General Hospital for further  evaluation of this  alleged  kidney problem.  Plaintiff's \nOriginal Complaint,  p.  11. \nB.  Missed Seizure Medications \nPlaintiff complains that doctors Seale,  Trinh,  Phi,  Guice,  Chassay,  and Luu were deliberately \nindifferent to  his  serious medical needs because the medical cart nurses did  not assure that Plaintiff \nreceived all of his seizure disorder medications.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  28  &  33.  Plaintiff \nfmds fault with doctors Seale and Phi because they allegedly offered no solutions as to how to remedy \nthe problem of the medical cart nurses allegedly not delivering all  of Plaintiff's seizure medications. \nPlaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  29 &  33. \nPlaintiff finds fault with Dr.  Guice because Plaintiff told him that he was not getting all  of his \nseizure  medications  and  Dr.  Guice  allegedly  showed  no  concern  about  this  problem.  Plaintiff's \nOriginal Complaint,  p.  28. \n3 \nRCLllhaIl.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 4 of 246\nPlaintifffinds fault with Dr.  Chassay who,  after ordering a double dose of seizure medication \nin  an effort  to  increase the level  of these  drugs  in  Plaintiff's  system,  failed  to  make  any  notes  in \nPlaintiff's medical records regarding this problem.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  28. \nPlaintiff finds fault with Dr. Luu who ordered that Plaintiff's seizure medications be increased \nafter the doctor confinned that Plaintiff did not have the prescribed level  of these drugs in his  system. \nPlaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  31.  Plaintiff complains that this increase in his seizure medications \nwas dangerous and resulted in Plaintiff being over medicated.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  31. \nC.  Medical Restriction Against Wearing Leg Irons \nPlaintiff states that although Dr.  Klein correctly determined that Plaintiff should not wear leg \nirons  due  to  a  prior  surgery  to  Plaintiff's  Achilles  tendon,  and  although  Dr.  Klein  issued  an \nappropriate medical  restriction  against  Plaintiff wearing  these  security  restraints,  the  doctor was \nnonetheless deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's serious medical needs because the doctor failed  to \ninsure that security personnel did not force Plaintiff to wear leg irons.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, \np.  13.  Plaintiff asserts that Dr.  Klein should have followed-up  on his purported written orders and \ninstructions that Plaintiff was not to wear leg irons by filling  out a \"Special Needs Advisement\" which \nwould have become part of Plaintiff's medical records.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  15  &  16. \nPlaintiff alleges that Dr.  Chassay was deliberately indifferent to this serious medical need when \nthe doctor \"briefly and indifferently\" looked through Plaintiff's medical records and missed seeing Dr. \nKlein's purported medical  restriction that  Plaintiff was  not to  wear leg irons.  Plaintiff's  Original \nComplaint, p.  14.  Plaintiff also finds fault with Dr.  Chassay because Plaintiff believes that the doctor \nshould have performed an independent medical examination which would have shown that Plaintiff \nshould not wear leg irons.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  14. \n4 \nRCLllhaU.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 5 of 246\nD.  Mis-diagnosis of \"Herpes.\" \nPlaintiff claims that Dr.  Guice mis-diagnosed an open sore as  \"herpes\" when in fact Plaintiff \nwas suffering from diabetes.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  24.  Plaintiff also complains that Dr. \nGuice did not diagnose his diabetes for approximately nine (9).  Plaintiff's Original Complaint,  p.  25. \nV. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nThe following facts  are  supported by Defendants'  summary judgment evidence. \nA.  The Alleged Chronic Kidney Condition \n1.  When Plaintiff entered  the Harris  County Jail  on or about February 22,  1995,  Dr. \nTrinh performed a \"new house evaluation\"  of Plaintiff.  As part of this intake evaluation,  Dr.  Trinh \nassessed Plaintiff's complaint of urinary problems.  Dr.  Trinh referred Plaintiff to specialty care at LBJ \nGeneral  Hospital  on  the  same  day  through  the  emergency  room  so  that  Plaintiff's  subjective \ncomplaints of urinary problems could be thoroughly evaluated.  Exhibit A,  p.  1;  and Exhibit B, p.  36. \n2.  The  physician  at  LBJ  Hospital  performed  a  urinalysis,  the  results  of which were \nnormal.  As a result,  the LBJ physician did not diagnose any type of kidney or urinary problems and \ntherefore  did not recommend  any  specific treatment or follow-up  evaluations.  This  decision was \nbased upon LBJ Hospital's medical history of Plaintiff,  their physical examination of Plaintiff,  and \ntheir laboratory test results.  Exhibit A,  p.  2;  and Exhibit B,  p.  189,  191, &  192. \n3.  At his  14-day health assessment on March 8,  1995, Plaintiff did not complain about \nany  kidney  or  urinary  problems.  Plaintiff had  ample  opportunity  to  make  such  a  complaint  as \nevidenced by the fact that Plaintiff did  state a history of positive TB skin test,  a  seizure disorder,  a \nthyroid  condition,  a  history of leg  surgery,  and  a request for an evaluation by  an eye doctor.  This \nhistory was noted in Plaintiff's medical records.  Exhibit A,  p.  2;  and Exhibit B,  p.  7-8. \n5 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 6 of 246\n4.  On March 30,  1995, Plaintiff was given a nursing triage evaluation.  Plaintiff described \nto  the  nurse  a  sore  in  his  groin  area  and  a  rash.  Plaintiff did  not mention  any  kidney  or urinary \nproblems despite having the opportunity to do so.  In fact,  when asked specific questions regarding \n3 \nthe  sore  and  rash,  Plaintiff told the  nurse that he was  not having  any  burning when he urinated. \nExhibit A,  p.  2;  and Exhibit B, p.  34. \n5.  On April  3,  1995,  Plaintiff was seen by Dr.  Guice who diagnosed the groin sore as \nherpes.  Dr.  Guice prescribed Zovirax for this condition.  Dr.  Guice also noted PlaintiiP s statement \nof a past history of kidney stones.  Again,  Plaintiff made no  specific complaint about current urinary \nor kidney problems.  Exhibit A,  p.  2 &  3;  and Exhibit B,  p.  33. \n6.  On April  14  and  19,  1995,  PlaintiiPs genital  skin lesion was further evaluated.  Dr. \nTrinh's  assessment  on  April  14,  1995,  was  that  the  lesion  represented  a  chancroid.  Dr.  Guice \nreevaluated the skin lesion on April  19,  1995,  and although Plaintiff stated that the lesion was better, \nDr.  Guice documented that the lesion appeared unchanged.  Plaintiff was still taking the medications \nprescribed  by Dr.  Trinh.  Again,  Plaintiff voiced  no  specific  complaints  about  kidney  problems. \nExhibit A,  p.  3 &  8;  and Exhibit B,  p.  30 &  31. \n7.  Between April and  September of 1995,  Plaintiff was seen by the medical staff several \ntimes  for  various  medical  complaints.  It was  not  until  September  20,  1995,  that  Plaintiff again \ncomplained of urinary difficulties.  This was the first complaint of this problem since PlaintiiPs initial \nintake evaluation on February 22,  1995.  Exhibit A,  p.  3;  and Exhibit B, p.  26. \nIn his complaint,  Plaintiff mistakenly interprets the March 30,  1995,  entry as stating that Plaintiff did \n3 \ncomplain of ''burning urination\" on this date.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  11.  Plaintiff, however, fails to realize \nthat the symbol \"0\" which immediately precedes the words \"burning urination\" is a medical abbreviation meaning \"no.\" \nExhibit B, p.  34. \n6 \nRCLlihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 7 of 246\n8.  On this date,  September 20,  1995, Plaintiff told a triage nurse that his glands had been \nswollen for  a month and  that he had  painful urination  and  testicular swelling.  The nurse  referred \nPlaintiff to Dr.  Phi for further evaluation of these complaints.  Exhibit A,  p.  3;  and Exhibit B,  p.  26. \n9.  Dr.  Phi  examined Plaintiff that very  day,  September 20,  1995.  At this  evaluation, \nPlaintiff told Dr.  Phi that his testicle had been swollen for  three (3)  months but denied  any painful \nurination.  Dr.  Phi diagnosed the problem as infection in the soft tissue,  not a urinary problem,  and \nprescribed appropriate medications.  Exhibit A,  p.  3;  and Exhibit B,  p.  26. \n10.  Plaintiff was again evaluated for testicular swelling and  skin lesions six (6) days later \non  September  26,  1995.  The  doctor  who  examined  Plaintiff made  a  diagnosis  of epididymitis \n(inflammation  of the  epididymis  which  overlies  the  testicle)  and  prescribed  further  medications. \nExhibit A,  p.  3;  and Exhibit B,  p.  25. \n11.  The next complaint of kidney pain by Plaintiff was on November 27,  1995, at which \ntime Plaintiff also  stated that his urination was painful.  A doctor's appointment was scheduled for \nPlaintiff for further evaluation of this complaint.  This appointment was scheduled for December 1, \n1995.  Exhibit A,  p.  3;  and Exhibit B,  p.  23. \n12.  On December 1,  1995, Plaintiff was called three (3) times for his doctor's appointment \nbut did not show up for this scheduled examination.  Dr.  Guice rescheduled Plaintiff's appointment \nto December 5,  1995.  Exhibit B,  p.  22. \n13.  Dr.  Guice  examined  Plaintiff on December 5,1995.  As  part of his  examination to \nevaluate Plaintiff's claim of urinary problems,  Dr.  Guice ordered an x-ray to look for  urinary tract \nstones, blood work to assess Plaintiff's kidney function,  and a urinalysis to assess whether the urine \nwas infected or bloody due to damage from possible urinary tract stones.  Dr.  Guice also  prescribed \nantibiotics in case Plaintiff did have a urinary tract infection.  The interpretation of the abdominal x-\n7 \nRCLIlhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 8 of 246\nray  showed no  abnormality.  The urinalysis was significant for  glucose,  not blood,  which led to  a \ndiagnosis  of diabetes.  Plaintiff was  not  diagnosed  with  any  type  of urinary  or kidney  problems. \nExhibit A,  p.  4;  and Exhibit B,  p.  20,21,23,47,48,49,50, &  51. \n14.  As shown by the medical records,  Plaintiff had multiple evaluations by multiple health \ncare providers during the remainder of his  stay in the Harris County Jail.  After December 5,  1995, \nPlaintiff  never  again  complained  of  urinary  or  kidney  problems.  Plaintiff  was  given  ample \nopportunities  to  access  the  medical  system  at  the  Harris  County  Jail  and  did  in  fact  bring  other \ncomplaints  to  the  attention  of the  medical  staff.  Plaintiff,  however,  was  never  diagnosed  with  a \nchronic  urinary  or  kidney  condition  despite  being  seen  and  evaluated  by  medical  personnel  on \nnumerous occasions.  Exhibit A,  p.  4. \nB.  The Missed  Seizure Medications \n15.  The Medication Administration Record (MAR) is a form used in the Harris County \nJail to document the administration of prescribed non-keep-on-person medications.  The MAR also \ndocuments which doses of medication an inmate misses and why.  Exhibit A,  p.  4. \n16.  Inmates in the Harris County Jail are responsible for responding to the medication cart \nnurses as they make their rounds on each housing floor.  Occasional doses are missed if the patient \nis in court or is otherwise outside the jail.  If the inmate does not respond to three (3) medication calls \nby the cart nurses,  no  medication can be given and the lack of timely administration is noted in the \nMAR.  Exhibit A,  p.  4 &  5. \n17.  Plaintiff's MAR documents that Plaintiff failed  to respond on multiple occasions to \nthe  cart  nurses'  medication  calls.  The  MAR  further  documents  that  Plaintiff  actually  refused \nappropriate medication for his  seizure disorder on the following  twenty-eight dates:  February 24, \n1995,  February 27,  1995,  March  1,  1995,  November 27,  1995, November 28,  1995,  December  1, \n8 \nRCL lihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 9 of 246\n1995, December 2,  1995, December 3,  1995,  December 9,  1995,  December  10,  1995, December 11, \n1995, December 12,1995, December 15,1995, December 16,1995, December 17,  1995,  December \n18,  1995, December 22,  1995, January 5,  1996, January 7,  1996, January  12,  1996, January  13,  1996, \nApril 2,  1996,  April  5,  1996,  April 7,  1996,  April  8,  1996,  April 9,  1996,  April  10,  1996,  and April \n12,  1996.  Exhibit A,  p.  5;  and Exhibit B,  p.  60 - 173. \n18.  The medical personnel could not force Plaintiff to take the medication prescribed by \nthe  physicians.  Plaintiff's  own noncompliance with the  prescribed medication regimen  adversely \nimpacted the medical staff's ability to keep his medication levels within the therapeutic range.  Exhibit \nA,  p.  5. \n19.  In increasing Plaintiff's medication dosage,  Dr.  Chassay and Dr.  Luu simply made an \neffort  to  adjust  the  regimen  to  compensate  for  missed  medications  and  sub-therapeutic  levels, \nrespectively.  Dr.  Luu  even  ordered  a  repeat  medication  level  one week  after  adjustment  of the \nmedication regimen to determine the appropriateness of the  dosing.  The adjustment of Plaintiff's \nseizure  medications  by  Dr.  Chassay  and  Dr.  Luu  was  reasonable.  The  adjustments  were  not \ndangerous as Plaintiff claims in his  complaint.  Nor is  there any evidence that these adjustments ever \nresulted in Plaintiff being over medicated as Plaintiff claims.  Exhibit A,  p.  5. \n20.  Throughout  his  stay  at  the  Harris  County  Jail,  Plaintiff's  medication  levels  were \nfrequently monitored.  This often prompted a follow-up physician evaluation in an effort to adjust the \nregimen or otherwise detennine the reason for  sub-optimal medication levels.  This monitoring and \nthe  follow-up  physician  evaluations  and  adjustments  are  well  documented  in  Plaintiff's  medical \nrecords.  Again,  at  no  time  were  Plaintiff's  medication  levels  inappropriately  high.  At  the  last \nphysician evaluation by Dr.  Phi on June 4,  1996, Plaintiff had \"no complaints\" and stated that his last \nseizure had occurred some eight months previously.  Exhibit A,  p.  5 &  6;  and Exhibit B,  p.  13. \n9 \nRCLlIhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 10 of 246\n21.  Even assuming that the medical cart nurses were purposefully not giving Plaintiff all \nof his  seizure medications--a claim that is refuted by the MAR--the Defendant doctors would have \nhad no responsibility for these improper actions.  There is no  evidence nor does Plaintiff even allege \nthat the Defendant doctors directed or approved any such practice.  Exhibit A,  p.  6. \nC.  The Purported Medical Restriction Against Wearing Leg Irons \n22.  On March 8,  1995, a medical history of Plaintiff was taken which resulted in a health \nassessment  form  being  completed.  Dr.  Klein  reviewed  this  health  assessment  form  but  did  not \nactually examine Plaintiff  The nurse who took the history and completed the health assessment form \nnoted that Plaintiff described  a past history of bilateral Achilles tendon repair in  1975.  The nurse \nfurther noted that Plaintiff claimed that he could not wear leg irons because of this surgery that was \nperformed  some  twenty  (20)  years  ago.  Again,  this  history  was  presented  by Plaintiff and  was \nPlaintiff's  own subjective  conclusion  as  to whether he was physically  able  to wear leg  restraints. \nExhibit A,  p.  6;  and Exhibit B,  p.  7 & 8. \n23.  This was not an objective diagnosis nor an opinion expressed by either the nurse or \nDr.  Klein.4  In fact,  the  nurse who  assessed  Plaintiff noted that Plaintiff had  not had  any  type  of \nsurgery within the past six (6) months and that Plaintiff's extremities (i.e.  feet,  legs,  hands,  and aIms) \nwere nonnal.  Plaintiff's chief complaint to the nurse at the health assessment on March 8,  1995, was \nthat he wanted to see  an eye doctor.  Plaintiff had an eye examination two (2) days later on March \n10,  1995.  Exhibit A,  p.  6;  and Exhibit B,  p.  7 - 8 and 203  - 204. \n24.  If Dr.  Klein  had  determined  through  his  review  of the  information  on the  health \nassessment form that Plaintiff required a Special Needs Advisement or physician follow-up  regarding \nwhether Plaintiff was physically able to wear leg restraints,  the doctor would have documented these \nIn his complaint, Plaintiff mistakenly interprets the health assessment form to read that Dr.  Klein ordered \n4 \nthat Plaintiff be medically restricted from wearing leg restraints.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  14  -16. \n10 \nRCLI Ihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 11 of 246\ninstructions  in the  medical  records.  He did  not.  Therefore,  in  Dr.  Klein's medical judgment,  no \nfurther  action was necessary.  This judgment was based on the information before Dr.  Klein in the \nhealth assessment, including the information that Plaintiff had not had surgery within the past six (6) \nmonths and that Plaintiff's extremities were normal.  Exhibit A,  p.  6 - 7;  and Exhibit B,  p.  7 - 8. \n25.  Despite Plaintiff's claim,  Dr.  Chassay could not have been deliberately indifferent to \nPlaintiff's serious medical needs because he missed seeing Dr.  Klein's restriction prohibiting Plaintiff \nfrom wearing leg restraints.  There was no  such restriction for Dr.  Chassay to miss.  Despite having \nmultiple opportunities to access medical personnel and having had multiple evaluations during which \nother medical issues were addressed,  Plaintiff did  not again  express any concern about wearing leg \nrestraints until a year later on March 19,  1996.  On that date, Plaintiff described to Dr.  Guice a history \nof previous  leg  injuries.  Dr.  Guice  examined  Plaintiff and  merely  recommended  that  Plaintiff be \nissued a cane.  Despite this independent medical  evaluation of Plaintiff's leg complaints,  Dr.  Guice \ndid  not  recommend  that  Plaintiff be  restricted  from  wearing  leg  restraints.  Exhibit  A,  p.  7;  and \nExhibit B,  p.  15. \nD.  The Alleged Herpes Mis-diagnosis \n26.  There is  no  support in the medical records for  Plaintiff's claim that Dr.  Guice mis-\ndiagnosed an open sore as \"herpes\" when in fact it was related to diabetes.  In fact,  Dr.  Guice made \nthe diagnosis of diabetes as  a result of his  ordering a blood work-  up for Plaintiff's alleged history of \nkidney disorder.  Exhibit A,  p.  7;  and Exhibit B,  p.  20,  21,  23,  47,  48,  49,  50, &  5l. \n27.  At nursing triage on March 30,  1995, Plaintiff described a sore and rash in the groin \narea and a history of unprotected sex  some months previously.  Dr.  Guice's note on April 3,  1995, \ndocuments that Plaintiff admitted to having this unprotected sex with a prostitute.  The history and \nlesion were consistent with herpes infection according to Dr.  Guice's note.  Based on this history and \n11 \nRCLlIhaIl.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 12 of 246\nthe appearance of the lesion,  Dr.  Guice appropriately prescribed Zovirax to treat the herpes lesion. \nExhibit A,  p.  7;  and Exhibit B,  p.  33  - 34. \n28.  Given the history of unprotected sex with a prostitute and a skin lesion on exam,  Dr. \nGuice's  diagnosis  was  consistent with  a  sexually-transmitted  disease  and  not  diabetes.  A  visual \ndiagnosis of herpes without confitming laboratory tests is common and completely reasonable.  This \nis especially so where a patient presents the type of history as  presented by Plaintiff  Exhibit A,  p. \n7 - 8. \n29.  On follow-up  with Dr.  Trinh on April  14,  1995, Plaintiff stated the Zovirax was not \nproviding him with relief  Given the lack of response to Zovirax,  Dr.  Trinh's assessment was that the \nlesion represented chancroid.  Dr.  Trinh adjusted Plaintiff's medication accordingly.  Exhibit A,  p. \n8;  and Exhibit B,  p.  31. \n3 0.  On follow-up  on April  19,  1995,  Dr.  Guice reevaluated the skin lesion,  and although \nPlaintiff stated that the lesion was better, Dr.  Guice documented that the lesion appeared unchanged. \nAt that point,  Plaintiff was still taking the medications as prescribed by Dr.  Trinh.  Exhibit A,  p.  8; \nand Exhibit B,  p.  30. \n31.  Plaintiff did  not  again  complain  of genital  issues  for  some  five  (5)  months.  On \nSeptember 20,  1995, Plaintiff described a one month history of swollen glands and testicular swelling. \nThis  complaint  was  evaluated  by  Dr.  Phi  on the  same  day.  Dr.  Phi  diagnosed  the  condition  as \ncellulitis of the scrotum and prescribed antibiotics.  Exhibit A,  p.  8;  and Exhibit B, p.  26. \n32.  Plaintiff was seen  in follow-up  by Dr.  Schilder six  (6)  days  later on September 26, \n1995.  Dr.  Schilder noted that in addition to the swollen testicle,  Plaintiff had small open sores on the \nleft  scrotal  sac  which  appeared  \"secondary  to  mechanical  irritation.\"  Dr.  Schilder  diagnosed  the \nswollen testicle as  epididymitis and  appropriately changed Plaintiff's antibiotics at this time.  Given \n12 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 13 of 246\nthat there was no definitive diagnosis of the initial genital lesion,  it is inaccurate to characterize the \ndiagnosis made by Dr.  Guice as a mis-diagnosis.  Exhibit A,  p.  8;  and Exhibit B, p.  25. \n33.  Moreover, during the eight month period of time between the initial complaint of the \ngenital lesion and the diagnosis of diabetes, Plaintiff never presented the typical symptoms of a person \nwith diabetes mellitus.  (i.e.  excessive thirst,  excessive urination,  excessive hunger,  weight loss and \nfatigue).  If a patient has no typical symptoms of diabetes mellitus,  the diagnosis must be made based \non routine laboratory screening.  In Plaintiff's case,  Dr.  Guice was able to make the diagnosis only \nas a result of the laboratory tests that Dr.  Guice had ordered to further evaluate Plaintiff's complaint \nofa kidney problem.  Exhibit A,  p.  8 - 9;  and Exhibit B,  p.  20,  21,  23,  47, 48,  49,  50,  &  51. \nVI. \nLEGAL ISSUES \n1.  The  Defendants'  summary judgment evidence establishes that Plaintiff received  an \nabundance of medical care and that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to Plaintiff's claim that \nthe Defendant doctors were deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff serious medical needs. \n2.  The Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity against Plaintiff's claims,  as Plaintiff \nhas  failed  to  produce  competent  summary  judgment  evidence  that  the  Defendants'  actions  in \nexamining and treating Plaintiff were objectively unreasonable. \n3.  Because no genuine issue of material fact  exist for trial,  the Defendant doctors are \nentitled to summary judgment. \n13 \nRCLIlhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 14 of 246\nVII. \nBRIEF IN SUPPORT \nA.  The Standard for Summary Judgment \nFED.  R.  ClV.  P.  56(c)  provides that  a  summary judgment  shall  be  rendered  if \"there is  no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and  . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as  a matter \nof law.\"  FED.  R.  ClV.  P.  56(s).  By its very terms,  the rule permits summary judgment even if the \nparties  disagree  as  to  some  facts.  Anderson,  477  US  at  247-248,  106  sect.  at  2510.  Summary \njudgment is precluded under Rule 56( c)  only when the facts in  dispute might affect the outcome of \nthe  suit under governing law and the dispute is genuine.  Anderson,  477 US  at 248,  106  S.Ct.  at \n2510.  Where the record would preclude a rational trier offact from finding  for the non-moving party, \nthere is no genuine issue for trial.  Matsushita Elec.  Indus.  Co.  v.  Zenith Radio Corp.,  475  US.  574, \n587,  106  S.Ct.  1348,  1356 (1986).  Should it appear that there is no genuine issue of material fact \nand that the moving party is  entitled to judgment as  a matter oflaw, the district court should grant \nsummary judgment.  Speaks v.  Trikora Lloyd P. T,  838  F.2d  1436,  1438-39 (5th Cir.  1988). \nThe movant need  not disprove the non-moving party's claim in order to secure a  summary \njudgment.  Summary judgment is proper whenever the movant demonstrates \"an absence of evidence \nto support the non-moving party's case.\"  Celotex Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477 US. 317,  106  S.Ct.  2548, \n2554  (1986);  accord Slaughter v Allstate Ins.  Co.,  803  F.2d 857,  860 (5th Cir.  1986).  Thus,  the \ndefendants  are  entitled to summary judgment when the plaintiff \"fails to make a showing sufficient \nto establish the existence of an element essential to the plaintiffs case,  and  on which [the plaintifl], \nwill  bear  the  burden  of proof at  trial.\"  Celotex,  477  US.  at  322,  106  S.Ct.  at  2552;  accord \nMatsushita Elec.  Indus.  Co.,  475  US.  at  587 (the burden is  not  on the moving  party to  produce \n14 \nRCLlihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 15 of 246\nevidence showing the absence of genuine issue of material fact).  See Reese v.  Anderson,  926 F. 2d \n494,  498  (5th Cir.  1991); International Ass'n ofM  achinists and Aerospace  Workers No.  2504 v. \nInternationalMfg.  Co.,  812F.2d219, 222 (5thCir.  1987). \nTo avoid summary judgment, the non-moving party must produce admissible evidence which \ncreates  a  fact  issue  concerning  the  existence  of every  essential  component  of that  party's  case; \nunsubstantiated assertions of actual dispute will not suffice.  Thomas v.  Price,  975 F.2d 231,235 (5th \nCir.  1992), citing Celotex Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477 U.S.  317,  323,  (1986).  The Supreme Court's key \nteaching in Celotex is that the party responding to a motion for  summary judgment must support his \nresponse with specific,  non-conclusory affidavits or other competent summary judgment evidence. \nth \nReese v.  Anderson,  926 F.2d 494,495 (5 Cir.  1991).  Mere conclusory allegations are insufficient \nto create a genuine issue of material fact,  as the summary judgment stage requires evidence.  Id  at \nth \n496.  See Slaughter v.  Allstate Ins.  Co.,  803  F.2d 857,860 (5 Cir.  1986).  Not only must the non \nmovant produce competent summary judgment evidence, he must also  articulate the \"precise manner\" \nth \nin which the evidence supports his claim.  Forsyth v.  Barr,  191527,  1537 (5 Cir.  1994) cert.  denied, \n115  S.  Ct.  195  (1994). \nIn  the  instant  case,  the  summary judgment evidence  submitted  by the Defendant  doctors \nnegates Plaintiff s claim that the Defendants were deliberately indifferent to his  serious medical needs. \nThus,  the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \nB.  Official Capacity Claims \nPlaintiff has  sued the Defendant doctors under 42 U.S.c.  §  1983  in both their official  and \nindividual capacities.  Section 1983  provides that,  \"Every person who ... shall be liable to the party \ninjured in an action at law,  suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"  (Emphasis added.) \n15 \nRCLlihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 16 of 246\nConsidering  this  language,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  neither  a  state  nor its \nofficials while acting in their official capacities are \"persons\" who may be liable under § 1983.  Will \nv.  Michigan Dept.  of State Police,  491  US. 58, 71  (1989).  Thus,  the Defendant doctors are entitled \nto summary judgment as to any claims for damages that Plaintiff purports to bring against the doctors \n5 \nin their official capacities. \nC.  Deliberate Indifference Claims \nIt is well established that no recovery may be had under § 1983  absent proof of deprivation \nof a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United  States.  Baker v.  McCollan,  443  US. \n137,  140 (1979).  Thus, the first  inquiry in any suit brought under 42 U.S.C.  §  1983  is whether the \nPlaintiff has been deprived of a federally secured right.  Baker,  443  US.  at  140. \nTo state a cognizable medical claim under § 1983  and the Eighth Amendment,  a Plaintiff must \nallege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to a  serious medical \nneed.  Estelle v.  Gamble,  429 U.S.  97,106,97 S.Ct.  285,  292 (1976); Cay v.  Estelle,  789 F.2d 318 \n(5th  Cir.  1986).  The  state  of mind  necessary  to  support  a  claim  of deliberate  indifference  was \nidentified  by the Supreme Court in Farmer  v.  Brennan,  511  US.  825,114 S.Ct.  1970 (1994). \nWhile  state officials can be sued under  §  1983  in their official  capacities,  the  relief sought  must be for \n5 \nprospective injunctive relief to prevent a  continuing violation of federal  law.  Green  v.  Mansour,  474 U.S.  64,68 \n(1985); and Edelman v.  Jordan,  415 U.S.  651,666-68 (1974).  In the instant case, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to \nprohibit the Defendants from retaliating against Plaintiff and to have Plaintiff placed in the custody of the sheriff of \nMontgomery County,  Texas.  Plaintiff's Original Complaint, p.  37 - 38.  Because Plaintiff is no longer incarcerated \nin the Harris County Jail,  his claim for injunctive relief is moot.  Furthermore, even if Plaintiff were still confined in \nthe Harris County Jail,  he offers no evidence that the Defendants are taking any adverse action against Plaintiff for \nbringing this lawsuit.  Plaintiff therefore fails  to show a continuing violation of federal law to justify his request for \ninjunctive relief.  For these reasons,  summary dismissal of Plaintiff's official capacity claims for injunctive relief is \nappropriate. \n16 \nRCL1!ha1l.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 17 of 246\nWhile Justice Souter noted that the official need not act with \"the very purpose of causing \nharm or with the knowledge that harm will result,\" it was also made clear that the standard requires \n\"something  more  that  mere  negligence.\"  Farmer,  ] 14  S.Ct.  at  ]978.  The  Court  settled  on \nrecklessness as the appropriate standard,  holding that a prison official cannot be found liable under \nthe Eighth Amendment unless the official  knows of and  disregards an excessive risk to the inmate's \nhealth or safety.  Again,  the official must both be aware offacts from which the inference could be \ndrawn that a  substantial risk of serious harm exists,  and he must also draw that inference.  Farmer, \n114 S.Ct.  at 1979. \nIn the case at bar,  Defendants'  summary judgment evidence shows that Plaintiff's medical \ncomplaints  were  throughly  addressed  with  an  abundance  of medical  evaluations  and  treatments. \nThus, the summary judgment evidence establishes that the Defendant doctors were not deliberately \nindifferent to Plaintiff's serious medical needs. \nPlaintiff's claim of deliberate indifference to an alleged chronic kidney condition fails  because \nthe summary judgment evidence shows that Plaintiff never actually had a  serious kidney or urinary \ntract  condition.  Banuelos  v.  McFarland,  41  F.3d  232,235  (5th  Cir.  1995)(trial  court  properly \ndismissed inmate's claim of deliberate indifference where evidence showed the complained of medical \ncondition was not serious).  Nowhere is  it  documented that Plaintiff ever had any type of chronic \nkidney condition.  On February 22,  1995,  LBJ General Hospital examined Plaintiff and performed a \nurinalysis  at Dr.  Trinh's request.  The results  of the  examination and urinalysis were negative for \nurinary or kidney problems. \n17 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 18 of 246\nDespite having  ample opportunities to do so,  Plaintiff did not complain of kidney problems \nagain until November 27,  1995.  In response to this complaint,  Dr.  Guice ordered an  x-ray to look \nfor urinary tract stones,  blood work to assess Plaintiff's kidney function,  and a urinalysis to assess \nwhether the urine  was infected  or bloody  due to  damage  from  possible urinary tract  stones.  Dr. \nGuice  also  prescribed  antibiotics  as  a  precaution  against  a  possible  urinary  tract  infection.  The \ninterpretation  of the  abdominal  x-ray  showed  no  abnormality.  The  urinalysis  was  significant  for \nglucose,  not blood.  This led to  a  diagnosis  of diabetes,  not urinary or kidney problems.  Plaintiff \nmade no further complaints of urinary problems and no such diagnosis was ever made.  Thus, Plaintiff \nhas failed  to show a serious medical condition with respect to his claim of deliberate indifference to \nan alleged  chronic kidney problem.  Moreover,  as the medical records document, the doctors were \nnot deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's complaints of urinary problems.  Rather, these claims were \nthoroughly evaluated by the medical staff. \nPlaintiff has also failed  to show a serious medical condition with respect to his claim that he \nwas forced  to wear leg irons in violation of his  medical restrictions.  Dr.  Klein reviewed Plaintiff's \nhealth  assessment  on March  8,  1995,  and,  based  on the  information  contained  therein,  found  no \nreason to medically restrict Plaintiff from wearing leg restraints.  In fact,  a year later when Plaintiff \ndescribed  a  history  of  leg  injuries  to  Dr.  Guice,  Dr.  Guice  examined  Plaintiff  and  merely \nrecommended that Plaintiff be issued a cane. \nNeither  Dr.  Guice  nor  any  other  health  care  provider  at  the  Harris  County  Jail  ever \nrecommended  that  Plaintiff  not  wear  leg  restraints.  Plaintiff's  assertion  that  Dr.  Chassay  was \ndeliberately indifferent because he missed  seeing such a restriction in  Plaintiff's medical records is \nwholly without merit.  There was no  such restriction and this  claim is  based  on nothing more than \n18 \nRCLlihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 19 of 246\nPlaintiffs misinterpretation of the medical records.  Dr.  Chassay therefore did not act with deliberate \nindifference. \nFurthermore,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Dr.  Guice  mis-diagnosed  Plaintiff's  open  sore  as \n\"herpes\"  when in  fact the  sore was a  symptom of Plaintiff's  diabetes.  The symptoms and  history \npresented by Plaintiff were entirely consistent with a  sexually-transmitted disease.  They were not \nconsistent with diabetes.  In fact,  during the period  of time between Plaintiff's initial complaint of the \ngenital sore and the diabetes diagnosis,  Plaintiff never presented the typical  symptoms of diabetes. \nDr.  Guice  diagnosed Plaintiff as  a  diabetic  only  as  a  result  of the blood  work that the doctor had \nordered to evaluate Plaintiff's claim of urinary problems.  Thus,  this claim of deliberate indifference \nagainst Dr.  Guice is without merit. \nFinally,  Plaintiff's  claim  of deliberate  indifference  based  on his  complaint  that  he  did  not \nreceive  all  of his  seizure medications is without merit.  The summary judgment evidence submitted \nby the Defendants shows that when Plaintiff missed his medication,  it was because Plaintiff failed  to \n6 \nrespond to the medical  cart nurses as  they made their medication rounds. Moreover,  the medical \nrecords document that on twenty-eight occasions Plaintiff outright refused appropriate medication \nfrom the nurses.  The medical staff could not force Plaintiff to take the medications that the doctors \nhad prescribed. \nThe upward adjustments of Plaintiff' s seizure medications by Dr.  Chassay and Dr.  Luu were \nnot  dangerous  as  Plaintiff subjectively  concludes.  The  adjustments  were  made  in  an  effort  to \ncompensate  for  the  lower level  of medications  in  Plaintiff's  blood  stream which  was  a  result  of \nEven ift he medical cart nurses were purposefully refusing Plaintiff his medications--a claim that is refuted \n6 \nby the medical records--the defendant doctors would have had no responsibility for these improper actions.  Plaintiff \nhas not alleged nor is there any evidence that the defendant doctors condoned any such alleged practice. \n19 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 20 of 246\nPlaintiff not responding to the medical  cart nurses calls and Plaintiff's outright refusal to take all of \nhis medication.  These adjustments were reasonable under the circumstances and  did not,  as Plaintiff \nalleges,  result in Plaintiff being over medicated. \nThe  documented  medical  records  of the  Defendant  doctors  examining,  diagnosing,  and \nproviding appropriate treatment to Plaintiff negates a  showing of deliberate indifference to serious \nmedical needs.  Bass v.  Sullivan,  550 F.2d 229 (5th Cir.  1977); see also McCord v.  Maggio,  910 F.2d \n1248,  1251  (5th Cir.  1990) (neither deliberate indifference to medical needs nor wanton infliction of \npain is  shown when there exist medical records documenting assessment and treatment of an inmate's \nmedical compJaints);Martinez v.  Griffin,  840 F.2d 314 (5th Cir.  1988) (dismissal appropriate where \nevidence  reflected  that  prisoner  received  adequate  medication  and  treatment).  Moreover,  any \ndisagreement  that  Plaintiff might  have  with  the  doctors'  diagnoses  and  treatment  of his  medical \ncomplaints  is  not  actionable under  §  1983.  Banuelos v.  McFarland,  41  F.3d  232,  235  (5th Cir. \n1995)(d  isagreement between inmate and his physician concerning whether certain medical  care was \nappropriate is actionable under § 1983  only under exceptional circumstances). \nEven assuming arguendo that the Defendant doctors were somehow negligent in providing \nPlaintiff with  medical  care,  claims  of negligence  are  not  actionable  under  §  1983.  Daniels  v. \nWilliams,  474 U.S.  326,  331-34,  106 S.Ct.  662,  664-7 (1986); Davidson v.  Cannon,  474 U.S.  344, \n347-48,  106  S.  Ct.  668,  670-71  (1986).  There  is  no  basis  for  Plaintiff's  self-serving,  conclusory \nallegations  of deliberate indifference.  The Defendant doctors  and  other medical  personnel at the \nHarris  County  Jail  provided  Plaintiff with  an  abundance  of medical  care.  The  Defendants  are \ntherefore entitled to summary judgment. \n20 \nRCLIlhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 21 of 246\nD.  The Defendants Are Entitled to  Qualified Immunity \nDefendants  are  entitled  to  the  defense  of qualified  immunity  in  actions  brought under 42 \nUS.C.  §  1983.  Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  US.  800,  818,  102  S.Ct.  2727,  2738  (1983).  \"The \ndoctrine  of qualified  immunity  shields  public  officials  like  the  respondents  from  damages  actions \nunless their conduct was unreasonable in  light  of clearly established law.\"  Elder v.  Holloway,  510 \nUS. 510,  114 S.Ct.  1019 (1994).  Once a defendant official  asserts this defense,  the burden shifts to \nthe plaintiff to overcome it.  Whatley  v.  Philo,  817 F.2d  19  (5th Cir.  1987).  In order to overcome \nthis  defense,  the  defendant  official's conduct must be shown to have violated  \"clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional rights  of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow,  457 \nUS. at 818,  102  S.Ct.  at 2738; Anderson v.  Creighton,  483  US.  635,  641,  107  S.Ct.  3034,  3042 \n(1987);  Bennett v.  City of Grand Prairie,  883  F.2d 400,408 (5th Cir.  1989). \nThe first hurdle a plaintiff must clear,  however, is to state a claim of constitutional dimension. \nSiegert  v.  Gilley,  111  S.Ct.  1789,1793  (1991).  As  set  out  above,  Plaintiff has  not  cleared  that \nhurdle.  Therefore, this Court need not further address the question of qualified immunity.  Even so, \nassuming arguendo that the  actions of one or more  of the Defendant doctors  could  somehow be \nconstrued as  a constitutional violation,  the competent summary judgment evidence shows that the \ndoctors'  actions  did  not  violate  \"clearly  established  statutory  or constitutional  rights  of which  a \nreasonable person would have known.\"  Harlow,  457 US. at 818,102 S.Ct.  at 2738. \nThe appropriate standard for  detennining qualified immunity is the objective reasonableness \nof an official's conduct as measured by reference to clearly established law.  Anderson v.  Creighton, \n483  U.S.  at 641,107 S.Ct.  at 3040; Bigfordv.  Taylor,  896 F.2d 972,974 (5th Cir.  1990); Pfannstiel \nv.  City ofM  arion,  918  F.2d  1178,  1182 (5th Cir.  1990).  This  standard requires that a  court first \n21 \nRCLJ Ihall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 22 of 246\ndetermine if the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right,  and if such \nan allegation is  found,  then decide whether the public  official's actions could reasonably have been \nthought consistent with the constitutional right.  Rankin v.  Klevenhagen,  5 F.3d  103  (5th Cir.  1993); \nEnlow v.  Tishomingo County,  Mississippi,  962 F.2d 501,508 (5th Cir.  1992). \nIt is Plaintiff's burden to overcome the Defendant doctors'  entitlement qualified immunity. \nSalas v.  Carpenter,  980 F.2d 299 (5th Cir.  1992); Elliott v.  Perez,  751  F.2d  1472,  1476-79 (5th Cir. \n1985).  Plaintiffs  are  held  to  heightened  pleading  standards  and  must  allege  with particularity  all \nmaterial facts establishing their right to recovery, including facts which negate the official's qualified \nimmunity defense.  Jacquez v.  Procunier,  801  F.2d 789,  791  (5th Cir.  1986); Elliott v.  Perez, 751 \nF.2d  1472,  1478-79,1482 (5th Cir.  1985).7 \nIn the instant case, Plaintiff has failed to show a violation of a clearly established constitutional \nright.  However,  even if such a violation were assumed,  there must also  exist evidence sufficient to \ncreate a genuine issue as to whether the Defendant doctors'  actions were objectively unreasonable. \nRankin,S F.3d at 105; Salas v.  Carpenter,  980 F.2d 299,310 (5th Cir.  1992).  It is Plaintiff's burden \nto come forward with evidence,  not mere conclusory allegations,  that the diagnoses and treatment \nby the Defendant doctors was objectively unreasonable.  Salas v.  Carpenter,  980 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. \nLeathennan v.  Tarrant County Narcotics  Unit,  507 U.S.  163,  113  S.Ct.  1160 (1993) (unanimous decision), \n7 \nis not to the contrary.  Leatherman struck down the heightened pleading requirement in cases against municipalities, \nwhich are not entitled to the official immunity defense.  Id.  at 1162.  The Supreme Court explicitly refused to strike \ndown the heightened pleading requirement in cases involving qualified immunity.  Id.  The Court, moreover removed \nheightened pleading in municipal liability cases because it conflicted with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which \nrequires only notice pleading.  !d.  at 1163.  This justification cannot apply in cases involving the substantive defense \nof innnunity because the Rules Enabling Act does not penn  it the Rules of Procedure to  \"abridge, enlarge or modifY any \nsubstantive right.\"  28 U.S.C.  § 2072(b).  In cases involving official immunity from suit, heightened pleading standards \nare the immune official's substantive right, designed to effectuate the policies of immunity from suit.  See Jacquez v. \nProcunier, 801  F.2d 789 (5th Cir.  1986); Elliott v.  Perez,  751  F.2d 1472 (5th Cir.  1985).  Hence,  heightened pleading \nstandards are still appropriate in cases involving qualified immunity in this Circuit, if not in all Circuits.  See  also \nBurns-Toole v.  Byrne,  11  F.2d 1270 (5th Cir.  1994). \n22 \nRCLIlhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 23 of 246\n1992)  (plaintiffs  have the burden to come forward  with summary judgment evidence  sufficient  to \ncreate a genuine issue as to whether the defendant official's conduct was objectively unreasonable \nin light of clearly established law) citing Pfannstiel v.  City ofM  arion,  918 F.2d  1178,  1183  (5th Cir. \n1990). \nOn  motion  for  summary  judgment,  a  court  must  determine  whether  a  given  action  is \nobjectively legally reasonable \"in light of clearly established law and the information the ... [official] \npossessed.\"  Anderson, 483  U.S.  at 641,  107 S.Ct.  3040; see also Saldana v.  Garza,  684 F.2d  1159, \n1163  n.14 (5th Cir.  1982) (explaining burdens of pleading and proof for  qualified immunity), cert. \ndenied,  460 U.S.  1012 (1983).  The summary judgment evidence submitted by the Defendants shows \nthat Plaintiff received  an  abundance  of medical  care  and  that  the  Defendant  doctors's  actions  in \nproviding  this  health  care  were  objectively  reasonable.  On  the  other  hand,  Plaintiff has  offered \nnothing more than  self-serving,  conclusory allegations  as  evidence of the unreasonableness of the \nDefendants'  actions.  Moreover,  these  allegations  are  based  in  large  part  on  Plaintiff's \nmisinterpretation of his medical records.  Thus,  because  the summary judgment evidence shows that \nthe Defendant doctors'  actions were objectively reasonable,  they are entitled to qualified immunity \nagainst Plaintiff's claims of deliberate indifference. \nVII. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants have produced evidence showing that no genuine issue of material fact  exists in \nthis  case.  Plaintiff's  allegations  of deliberate  indifference  are  insufficient  to  carry  his  evidentiary \nburden of establishing  a genuine issue  of material  fact  for  trial.  Moreover,  Plaintiff has  failed  to \nproduce evidence to defeat the Defendants'  entitlement to qualified immunity. \n23 \nRCLllhall.msj \nClibPDF - www.fastio.com\n\nCase 4:97-cv-00874   Document 45    Filed in TXSD on 10/10/97   Page 24 of 246\nACCORDINGLY, Defendants pray that their motion for summary judgment be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \nDAN MORALES \nAttorney General of Texas \nJORGE VEGA \nFirst Assistant Attorney General \nDREW DURHAM \nDeputy Attorney General \nfor Criminal Justice \nANN KRAATZ \nAssistant Attorney General \nChief,  Law Enforcement Defense Division \n, \n• \n• \nRALPHC. \nAssistant Attorney General \nState Bar No.  00794184 \nSouthern District Admission No.  20417 \nP.O.

Section 1985 and 42 U.S.C. Section 12132 becsuse the comp-\nlaint raises s federal question, whether the defendants violated\nthe plsintiff's rights under the U. S. Constitution and the\n\nAmericsns with Dissbilities Act (ADA). This Court hss sppellste\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291 becsuse the grsnt of\nsummary judgment is a final judgment. Said finsl judgment wss\nentered on June 9, 1998, sod the plaintiff's Notice of Appesl was\nfiled on June 19, 1998.\nStatement of Issues Presented _or Review\n1. Whether the district court, in grsnting summsry judgment\nsod motions to dismiss, improperly decided that the ADA did not\nspply to the pleintiff while he was s prisoner in the Hsrris\nCounty Jail, Houston, Texas.\n2. Whether the district court, in grsnting summary judgment\nend motions to dismiss, improperly decided factusl issues in.....\nwhether plaintiff hsd ststed s claim under the ADA.\n3. Whether the district court improperly granted qualified\nimmunity to the defendants.\n4. Whether the district court improperly dismissed plsin-\ntiff's 42 U.S.C. SeCtion 1983 action because plaintiff's factual\nallegstions of \"deliberste indifference to his serious medical\nneeds by the defendants\" raised s material issue under the Eighth\nAmendment snd subsequently under the First, Fifth, Sixth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA. Ststement of Proceedings\nOn _srch 18, 1997, the pleintiff filed civil suit under 42\nU.S.C. Sections 1983 and 12132 and slleges that his serious\n\nmedical needs, as a disabled person, were not met due to the\ndeliberate indifference of the defendants. On January 16, 1998,\nthe district court in a Memorandum Opinion (see Doc 65, pgs. 1-!8)\nand Order (see Doc 66, pgs. I-2) granted summary judgment and\nmotions to dismiss for the defendants on the following grounds:\nI) The district court dismissed with prejudice plaintiff's\nclaims under the ADA (42 U.S.C. Section 12132) by ruling that the\nprovisions of the ADA did not apply to the plaintiff as a prisoner.\n(See Doc. 65, pgs. 5-10 and Doc. 66, p.1)\n2) The district court dismissed with prejudice plaintiff's\nclaims for relief under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 against all the\nnamed defendants in their official capacities by stating that the\ndefendants medical treatment was \"potentlally negllgent\" but not\ndeliberately indifferent to plaintiff's serious medical needs.\n(See Doc. 65, pgs. 11-18)\nB. Statement of Facts\nOn February 21, 1995, U.S. Marshals arrested the plaintiff\non a parole warrant. At the time the disabled plaintiff had a\nhistory of mental and physical disabilities (See Doc. 65, p.2 at\nTHE DISPUTE). The plaintiff was assigned to the Harris County\nJail in Houston, Texas. While housed at that facility, the dis-\nabled plaintiff claims that his Constitutional rights were violated\nbased on the deliberate indifference of the defendants to adequately\ntreat his serious medical conditions. The plaintiff filed civil\nsuit under 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983 and 12132 seeking damages\nagainst the named defendants.\n\nOn October 10, 1997, defendants Seale, Guice, Trinh, Phi,\nLuu, Chassay and Klein filed a motion for summary judgment in this\naction (See Doc. 45, pgs. 1-13). As an Exhibit Dr. Mike Seale\nsubmitted an affidavit. No other affidavits were submitted, at\nany other time, by any other defendant doctor in this action.\nOn November 25, 1997, the plaintiff submitted an Answer to\nDefendant Doctor's Motion for Summary Judgment. With the Answer\nwas a supporting Brief, Affidavit of Robert Arthur Hall an_ a\nnotarized letter of Dr. William J. Riley (See Doc. 50, pgs.\ni-13; see also Exhibits A-C attached thereto).\nSummary of Argument\nThe plaintiff's affidavit (Doc 50, Exhibit B) squarely contra-\ndicted the factual allegations of the defendants, and the facts it\nalleged would have supported a judgment for the plaintiff under the\nEighth Amendment and subsequently the First, Fifth, Sixth and Four-\nteenth Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Summary\njudgment was therefore improper on the record before the district\ncourt.\n•ARGUMENT\nPOINT I\nTHE DISTRICT COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE DISMISSED PLAINTIFF\"S ADA CLAIM\nSummary judgment is to be granted only if the record before the\ncourt shows \"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.\" Rule 56(c), Fed.R.Civ.P. Whether a party is entitled to\na summary judgment is a question of law over which this Court\nexercises plenary review. (See Tobey v. Extel/JWP, Inc., 985\nF.2d 330, 332 (7th Cir. 1993)\nA. The district court improperly dismissed plaintiff's claims\nunder the ADA.\n(I) Plaintiff's affidavit and brief (See Doc. 50, Exhibits\nA and B) stated that the ADA applied to him while he was confined\nas a prisoner in the Harris County Jail at the time of the com-\nplaint and that there were a number of genuine issues as to\nmaterial fact when the complaint was viewed in light of the pro-\nvisions of the ADA.\n(2) On January 16, 1998, the district court improperly dis-\nmissed plaintiff's claims as a prisoner under the ADA. (See Doc.\n65, pgs. 5-10; and Doc. 66, p. I)\n(3) On June 15, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a\"unani-\nmous ruling in Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 118\nF.3d 168 (3rd Cir. 1997), aff'd 1998 LEXIS 5888. Affirming that\n\"...the plain text of Title II of the ADA unambiguously extends\nto state prison inmates...\" Id. at 11. Writing for the Court,\nJustice Scalia stated:\n\"...the statues language unmistakeably includes\nstate prisons and prisoners within its coverage.\nId. at 5\n\"...the ADA plainly covers state institutions with-\nout any exception that could cast the coverage of\nprisons into doubt. Title II of the ADA provides\nthat:\n\n\"Subject to the provisions of this subchapter,\nno qualified individual with a disability shall,\nby reason of such disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of\nthe services, programs, or activities of a pub-\nlic entity, or be subjected to discrimination\nby any such entity.\" 42 U.S.C. Section 12132.\nState prisons fall squarely within the statutory\ndefinition of public entity which includes \"any\ndepartment, agency, special purpose district, or\nother instrumentality of a State or States or\nlocal government.\" Section 12131 (B).\nId. at 6\nThe statute defines theterm to include anyone\nwith a disability...who...meets the essential\neligibility requirements for the receipt of\nservices or the participation in programs or\nactivities provided by a public entity.\" 42 U.S.C.\nSection 12132 (2).\n(4) Plaintiff's complain_ describes that, due to the delibe-\nrate indifference of the defendants, that as a \"qualified indivi-\ndual with a disability\" that he was \"excluded from participation\nin\" and \"denied the benefits of the services, programs, or acti-\nvities of\" the Harris County Sheriff's Department-Jail Division\nthat were available to jail inmates. Namely the medical services,\nreligious services, law library services and all recreational\nactivities benefiting inmates in the jail for a sixteen (16)\nmonth period. (See Doc. I, pgs. 13-16)\n(5) The record supports that the defendants were informed\na number of times that the plaintiff had a physical disability\nin both legs. (See Doc.1, pgs. 13-17; See Exhibits 56, 66, 74,\nattached thereto) With deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's\n\nserious medical needs, the defendants failed to accomodate his\ndisabled person in medical services, religious services and\nrecreational activities for a sixteen (16) month period in the\nHarris County Jail and in violation of the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 12132. The district court\nimproperly dismissed plaintiff's claims under the ADA in light\nof the foregoing.\nPOINT 2\nTHE COMPLAINT STATES A CLAIM UNDER THE ADA\nAt 28 C.F.R. Section 35.149 Discrimination prohibited, it\nstates in part:\n\"....no qualified individual with a disability\nshall...be excluded from participation in, or\nbe denied the benefits of the services, programs,\nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected\nto discrimination by any such entity.\"\nA. The plaintiff's claim to being a \"qualified individual\" under\nthe ADA.\n(I) The plaintiff cites the Memorandum Opinion of the dis-\ntrict court to establish his standing as a qualified individual\nwith a disablity. In the Opinion (See Doc. 65, p.2) at part II.\nTHE DISPUTE the district court finds:\n\n\"At the time of his arrest, Hall had a history\nof mental and physical disabilities including;\nneurological and musculoskeletal difficulties,\nepilepsy, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney dys-\nfunction, diabetes, and several mental and emo-\ntional disorders (i.e. bipolar disorder, clinical\nmajor depression, and split personality disorder).\"\nThe district court states at Doc. 65, p. 17:\n\"...the plaintiff obviously suffers from severe\nmental and physical illnesses...\"\n(2) The district court's descriptions above define the plain-\ntiff's mental and physical conditions as severe (serious) and\nqualify him as a \"disabled person\" under the ADA definitions found\nin 28 C.F.R. Part 35 as follows:\nSection 35.101 Purpose.\nThe purpose of this part is_oeffectuate sub-\ntitle A of Title II of the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131), which\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability by public entities.\nSection 35.104 Definitions.\nDisability means, with respect to an individual,\na physical or mental impairment that substantially\nlimits one or more of the major life activities\nof such individual; a record of such impairment;\nor being regarded as having such an impairment.\n(I)(i) The ph#ase physical or mental impairment\nmeans-\n(A) Any physiological disorder or condition...\naffecting one or more of the following body systems:\nNeurological, musculoskeletal...genitourinary...\n(B) Any mental or psychoIQgical disorder_suchas.0 •\nemotional or mental illness...;\n(3) The plaintiff is a \"qualified individual with a disability\nwho...meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt\nof services or the participation in programs or activities provided\nby a public entity.\" The plaintiff's complaint, Brief and affidavit\n\nhas claimed, and supported with Exhibits, that the defendants et\nal, who represented the Harris County Sheriff's Department as a\npublic entity, excluded the plaintiff from participation in, and\ndenied him the benefits of the services, programs, and activities\nthat were afforded to other inmates in the Harris County Jail and\nthis states a claim under the ADA.\nB. A reasonable prison official would have known that his actions\nconstituted a violation of the ADA.\nThe disabled plaintiff's Original Complaint describes in\ndetail a sixteen (16) month period of incarceration in the Harris\nCounty Jail where:\n(a) The disabled plaintiff was mis-classified upon his entry\ninto the jail and placed in Administrative Detention where the\ndefendants made no accomodations for his mental and physical dis-\nabilities. Such accomodations should have been the classification\nof the plaintiff to a hospital section and/or medical cellblock\nin the jail.\n(b) The mis,classification of the plaintiff by the defendants\nresulted in:\nI) the plaintiff not being seen by proper mental health personnel;\n2) the plaintiff having extended and untreated depression;\n3) the plaintiff not receiving treatment for his bipolar disorder;\n4) the plaintiff having to suffer excessive seizure activity that\nfor the most part went unnoticed and untreated.\n(c) The disabled plaintiff's orthopedic and muscul0skeletal\ndisabilities were not accomodated by his having to wear medically\n\nrestricted leg irons (See Doc. I, Exhibit 56). The use of the leg\nirons, and the pain and injury produced thereby, prevented the\nplaintiff from:\nI) the free exercise of his religion in not being able to attend\nreligious services;\n2) and from the exercise of plaintiff's rights to having meaningful\naccess to the courts by his not being able to attend all library\nperiods for sixteen (16) months;\n3) and from attending all recreational activities for sixtee_ (16)\nmonths.\n(d) While in Administrative Detention, and during the six-\nteen month period of the complaint, the plaintiff:\nI) suffered an untreated kidney dysfunction for months; and\n2) had a misdiagnosis of herpes and which after months of suffer-\ning was diagnosed as out of control diabetes;\n3) the months that the out of control diabetes went undiagnosed.\nleft the plaintiff covered in sores, with swollen glands and_a\npartial loss of vision and at the same time he was deprived of _\n180 doses of seizure medications which caused the plalntiffto\nhave excessive and dangerous seizure activity.\n(e) A reasonable prison official would not have placed the\nmentally disabled plaintiff, who had a history of suicide attempts\nin that jail system, had clinical depression, bipolar disorder and\nsplit personality disorder in Administrative Detention.\nA reasonable prison official would not have placed the physi-\ncally disabled plaintiff, who had orthopedic and musculoskeletal\nI0\n\ndifficulties, epilepsy, hypothyroidim, chronic kidney dysfunction\nand had swollen glands and was covered in sores in Administrative\nDetention.\nA reasonable prison official would have accomodated the mental\nand physical disabilities of the plaintiff by having him placed\nin the mental health ward of the Harris County Jail and or in one\nof the medical cellblocks designated for this purpose and also\nfound within the Jail. A reasonable prison official would have\nseen that al___lmledications prescribed for the disabled plaintiff\nwere actually given to the plaintiff for the treatment of his\ndisabilities.\nUnreasonablness of Defendants Documented in Original Complaint\n(f) In the plaintiff's Medical Records, attached to the\nOriginal Complaint (Doc. I), the defendants have placed copies of\nletters that the plaintiff, and others acting on behalf of the\nplaintiff, sent to the Harris County Sheriff's Department-Medical\nDivision and U.S. Marshals Office, and which prove the defendants\nknew the plaintiff was not receiving reasonable and adequate medi-\ncal services from the defendants. These letters are excerpted as\nfollows:\nI) August _23, 1995, letter from plaintiff to Hospital Administra-\ntor states:\n\"Having sent multiple requests...I have become\nincreasingly ill while your department has been\nindifferent to my needs.\" (Doc. I, Exhibit 67)\n2) September 20, 1995, letter from plaintiff to U.S. Marshal Ray\nBright, and which was service copied to the defendants, stated the\n11\n\nplaintiff had attempted and failed to obtain medical attention on\nten (10) different dates and that even a Jail chaplain was also\ntrying to get the plaintiff medical attention but without success.\n(See Doc. I, Exhibit 69, pgs. I-3)\n3) On March 13, 1996, a U.S. Government Memorandum was sent from\nActing Chief Deputy Lisa Griffis to defendant Major Quinn which\nstated that \"Hall is a diabetic and is having problems with lack\nof monitoring of his medication doses...\" (See Doc. I, Exhibit 70)\nThe defendants were unreasonable for they knew the disabled\nplaintiff had been laying on a bunk for months, in a Administrative\nDetention cell, (a) covered with sores, (b) with swollen glands,\n(c) suffering untreated clinical depression, (d) suffering with\nan untreated bipolar disorder (e) and suffering an un_reated\nsplit personality disorder. The defendants also knew the plaintiff\nwas suffering pain from (f) his unaccomodated orthopedic and\nmusculoskelatal difficulties, (g) suffering from kidney dysfunc-\ntion and (h) suffering excessive seizure activity through his not\nreceiving 180 doses of seizure medication for his disability of\nepilepsy. The defendants, therefore, acted unreasonably and knew\ntheir actions or inactions Violated the Americans with Disabilities\nAct.\nPlaintiff's complaint stated a claim under the ADA. The\ndistrict court improperly dismissed plaintiff's claim under the ADA.\n12\n\nPOINT 3\nTHE DISTRICT COURT SHOULD NOT HAVE GRANTED\nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY TO THE DEFENDANTS\nA. The district court stated in its Memorandum Opinion:\n\"Thus, the assessment of a qualified immunity\ndefense requires an examination of two factors.\nFirst, the Court must consider whether the\nplaintiff has alleged the violation of a\nclearly established right...Second, the Court\nmust consider whether the actions complained of\nwith reference to the law that existed at the\ntime, were objectively reasonable.\nIn order to address the first step of the\nqualified immunity defense, this Court must\ndetermine if the provisions of the ADA apply\nto prisoners.\" (See Doc. 65, P.5)\nThe district court then erroneously describes in the Opinion\nhow the ADA does not apply to prisoners and ends granting the\ndefendants qualified immunity in the following tentative manner:\n\"When examined in light of the entire statutory\nscheme, this Court is unable to clearly discern\na congressional intention to include state cor-\nrectional facilities within the ambit of Title\nII of the ADA. As such, the actions Hall at-\ntributes to the defendants could not have violated\na \"clearly established statutory right\" and, thus,\ndo not state a cause of action. In the alternate,\ndue to the ambiguous language of the ADA, lack of\nguidance from the Fifth Circuit, and entrenched\ndisagreement among the sister circuits, this\nCourt finds that the defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity for their actions with respect\nto Hall's ADA claim. (See Doc. 65, p. 9)\nThe district court granted qualified immunity to the defendants\nbased solely on the wrong conclusion that the ADA did not apply to\nprisonerssuch as the plaintiff. As cited in POINT I supra the\n13\n\nunanimous Supreme Court ruling in Pennsylvania Dept of Corrections\nv. Yeske_, (citation omitted) affirmed that \"...the plain text of\nTitle II of the ADA unambigously extends to state prison inmates...\"\nThus, in effect, removing the only claim the defendants had to\nqualified immunity from the plaintiff's complaint brought under the\nADA.\nB. As demonstrated in the complaint, and in this appeal above,\nover the months of the complaint the defendants had received a num-\nber of documented requests from the plaintiff, plaintiff's family,\nplaintiff's attorney, a jail chaplain and a U.S. Marshal concern-\ning the complained of deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's\nserious medical needs and then the defendants failed to act as a\nreasonable person would in the instances complained of.\nThe above defeats the defendants cliams to qualified immunity\nfor state employees performing discretionary functions in their\nofficial capacity are granted qualified immunity only \"insofar as\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.\" Melear v. Spears, 862 F.2d 1177, 1184 n.8 (5th Cir. 1989)\nPOINT 4\nTHE COMPLAINT STATES A CLAIM UNDER THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that \"deliberate indifference to\nserious medical needs of prisoners\" is cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n(See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976). The plaintiff's\ncomplaint alleges facts that state a claim under this standard.\n14\n\nA. The plaintiff's claim to \"serious medical needs\" under the\nEighth Amendment.\n(I) Courts have acknowledged that conditions that cause sig-\nnificant pain are \"serious medical needs.\" (See McGuckin v. Smith,\n974 F.2d 1050, 1060 (9th Cir. 1992); Boretti v. Wiscomb, 930 F.2d\n1150, I15_-55 (6th Cir. 1991)(needless pain is actionable even if\nthere is no permanent injury); Dean v. Cou_hlin, 623 F, Supp. 392,\n404 (S.D.N.Y. 1985)(\"conditions that cause pain, discomfort, or\nthreat to good health\" are serious.) This is true because a chief\npurpose of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause is to prevent\nthe \"unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\" Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. at 104 (citation omitted)_ The plaintiff's complaint,\nbrief, and affidavit alleges that he suffered significant and re-\ncurrent pain from his untreated physical and mental disabilities\nfor a sixteen (16) month period due to the deliberate indifference\nof the defendants to his serious medical needs. This pain is more\nthan sufficient to make the plaintiff's medical needs \"serious\"\nunder an Eighth Amendment application.\n(2) Courts generally agree that a medical need is \"serious\"\nif it \"has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment...\"\n(See Johnson v. Busbee, 953 F.2d 349, 351 (ath Cir. 1991); see also\nGaudreault v. Municipalit Z of Salem i Mass., 923 F.2d 203, 208 (Ist\nCir. 1990),. Plaintiff's claim, replete with attached medical\nrecords (See Doc. I, Exhibits 1-21), shows be had been \"diagnosed\nby a physician as mandating treatment\" on several disabilities\nand medical conditions that were \"serious.\"\n15\n\n(3) A medical condition is serious if it \"significantly affects\nan individuals daily activitie%\" McGuckin v. Smith, supra. The\nplaintiff's overall mental and physical conditions that were ig-\nnored and left untreated, had serious consequences for him. Be -_\nsides pain and suffering, the complaint alleges that these condi-\ntions were so serious that for sixteen (16) months they prevented\nhim from leaving his cell to participate in services and activities\nprovided for inmates at the Harris County Jail. Thus, the serious\nmedical conditions \"significantly affected\" the plaintiff's daily\nactivities.\nB. The defendants' conduct amounts to deliberate indifference to\nthe plaintiff's serious medical needs.\n(I) The complaint alleges that the jail doctors prescribed\nmedications to control the plaintiff's epilepsy, and that in a\n360'day period the plaintiff did not receive 180 doses of this\nseizure medication due to the defendant doctors deliberate indif4\nference in not taking action once they were informed of the mis-\nsed medications. (See Doc. I, pgs. 17-23) \"Intentionally inter-\nfering with treatment once prescribed\" is one of the forms of\ndeliberate indifference cited by the Supreme Court. Estelle v.\nGamble, 429 U.S. at 105. Many decisions have held that failing\nor refusing to provide medication prescribed by physicians con-\nstitute deliberate indifference. (See Aswegan v. 8ruhl, 965 F.2d\n676, 677-78 (8th Cir. 1992); Hill v. Marshal, 962 F.2d 1209, 1213-\n14 (6th. Cir. 1992); Johnson v. Hay, 931 F.2d 456, 461 (8th Cir.\n1991)\n16\n\n(2) During the complained of 360 day period and in reference\nto the 180 missed seizure medications, the plaintiff, and others\nacting on his behalf, spoke to or wrote the defendant doctors con L\ncerning the ever growing number of missed seizure medications.\nThese efforts are graphically described by Exbibits in the Original\nComplaint (See Doc. I, pgs. 28-33) which concludes at part 17)\nwith:\n\"The foregoing sixteen (16) references portray\nPlaintiff, and others acting on the behalf of : :\nPlaintiff, making persistent and reasonable\nefforts to obtain his needed seizure medication\nfor sixteen (16) months. It is remarkable that\nthe Defendants themselves documented into\nPlaintiff's MR (medical record) eleven (II):\nentries pertaining to where Plaintiff either\nspoke with HCSD-MD doctors and nurses, wrote\nletters; had administrative replies in the MR;\nor U.S. Marshals sent fax messages. Outside\ntbe MR is Plaintiff's grievance #95-1083 and\nPlaintiff's attorney's two letters of 4/8/96\nand 4/17/96 and the two personal attempts by\nFr. Ron Cloutier. All these concerted efforts\nto break through the medical neglect and deli-\nberate indifference to the serious medical\nneeds of the Plaintiff by the HCSD-MD that\nresulted in the suffering and wanton infliction\nof pain and callous disregard for the health\nand well being of the Plaintiff.\"\nSeveral courts have held that \"repeated examples of negligent acts\nwhich disclose a pattern of conduct by the prison staff\" may add\nup to deliberate indifference. (See Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559,\n575 (lOth Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1041 (1981); accord,\nHarris v. Thi_pen, 941 F.2d 1495, 1505 (llth Cir. 1991); DeGidio v.\nPung, 920 F.2d 525, 533, (8th Cir. 1990)(consistent pattern of\nreckless or negligent conduct establishes deliberate indifference.\n17\n\nThe plaintiff has demontrated above, that in his original com-\nplaint that he, and others acting on his behalf, repeatedly\nover the months of the complaint, talked to and/or wrote the\ndefendant doctors describing to them a sixteen (16) month period\nwherein 180 doses of seizure medicatin had not been given tO\nthe plaintiff for his serious medical condition of epilepsy.\nThese long running examples of negligent acts disclosed a pat-\ntern of conduct by thedefendant doctors that adds up to\ndeliberate indifference to the plaintiff's serious medical\nneeds and states a claim for the plaintiff under the Eighth\nAmendment.\n(3) Deliberate indifference can be demonstrated by acts\nor statements by prison personnel directly showing an indifferent\nor hostile attitude towards prisoners' medical needs. (See Hughes\nv. Joliet Correctional Center, 931_F.2d 425, 428 (7th Cir. 1991);\nWhite v. Napolean, 897 F.2d 103, 109 (3rd Cir. 1990); Kersh v.\nDerozier, 851 F.Zd 1509, 1510, 1513 (Sth Cir. 1988). In the\ninstant case, and over a sixteen (16) month period, the com-\nplaint reflects that plaintff spoke directly to Medical Director\nMike Seale, and other defendant doctors, concerning his serious\nmedical needs, including the 180 missed seizure medications.\nHowever, Dr. Seale, and the other defendant doctors, were deli-\nberately indifferent to those needs and took little or no action\nin each instance recorded. (See Doc. l, pgs. 28-33)\n(4) Courts focus on facts tha_ show that professional judg-\nment was either not exercised or was not followed after it was\n18\n\nexercised. In those fact situations, good intentions are not a\ndefense. AS one court stated:\n\"Deliberate indifference can be proved by\nshowing a prison officials mental state.\nBut deliberate indifference is also a stan-\ndard for measuring the adequacy of prison\nofficials' responses to the known medical\nneeds of inmates and their system for allow-\ning inmates to make their needs known.\"\nDean v. Cou6hlin, 623 F. Supp. 392 at 402\nPlaintiff's c0mplaint more than demonstrates that \"professional\njudgment was ....not exercised or was not followed after it Was\nexercised\" for the defendants' response to the known serious\nmedical needs of the plaintiff was deliberate indifference_tc\nthose needs. (See_Doc. I, pgs. 28-33)\n(5) There are several familiar fact patterns that courts\nhave held constitute deliberate indifference:\n(a) Delay or denial of access to medical attention. (See Estelle\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. at 104: Fields v. City of South Houston, Texas,\n922 F.2d 1183, 1192 n. 10 (5th Cir. 1991) The defendants granted\na grievance that plaintiff filed on December 5, 1995, concerning\nhim not being seen by medical doctors for a number of months. The\ndistrict court recognized this claim but refused to see the serious\nimplications of the ongoing pattern and practice of deliberate in-\ndifference manifested by the defendants failure to respond to the\nplaintiff's serious medical needs by the keeping of dcotor appoint-\nments. (See Doc. 65, p. 12)\n(b) Failure to inquire into essential facts that are necessary to\n19\n\nmake a professional judgment. As one court put it, \"We will\ndefer to the informed judgment of prison officials as to an\nappropriate form of medical treatment. But if an informed\nJudgment has not been made, the court may find that an Eighth\nAmendment claim has been stated.\" Tillery v. Owens, 719 F.\nSupp. 1256 at 1308. The complaint now on appeal, states that\nthe defendant doctors failed to inquire into essential facts\nthat were necessary to make a professional judgment. Plain-\ntiff's complaint explained in detail to the district court how\nthe Medication Administration Record (MAR) worked. (See Doc.\n1, pgs. 18-19) Copies of the MAR from plaintiff's medical\nrecords were attached to the Original Complaint as Exhibits 53-\n47 for the district court to review and ascertain that indeed\n180 doses of seizure medications were not dispensed to the\nplaintiff. The \"essential facts\" that the defendant doctors\nneeded to \"make a professional judgment\" were contained in the\nMAR. However, the defendant doctors never reviewed the MAR in\ndeliberate indifference to the plaintiff's serious medical needs\nin having the doses of seizure medication monitored by the doctors\nso as to keep him in safe ranges of this epilepsy medication.\n(c) Failure to carry out medical orders. Such cases often\ninvolve the failure to provide prescribed medications. Aswegan v.\nBruhl, 965 F.2d at 677-78; Hill V. Marshal, 962 F.2d 1209, 1213\n(6th Cir. 1992), cert. denied 113 8.Ct. 2992 (1993); Johnson v.\nHay, 931 F.2d 456, 461 (8th Cir. 1991) The defendants failed\n2O\n\nfor sixteen (16) months, through deliberate indifference, to\nreview the MAR of plaintiff's medical records and ascertain\nthat he had missed 180 doses of the seizure medications. The\ndefendants refused to review these records even after the\nplaintiff, plaintiff's family, plaintiff's attorney, a jail\nchaplain and a U.S. Marshal reported the problem to them.\n(See Doc. I, pgs. 28-33)\nThe Medication Administration Records present evidence,\ndocumented by the defendants, that the plaintiff was subjected\nto an Eighth Amendment violation through the \"unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain\" by the defendants deliberate indif-\nference to the plaintiff's serious medical needs of having his\nseizure disorder treated correctly.\n(d) Extreme cases of bad judgment by medical personnel\nconstitute deliberate indifference. One federal appeals court\nhas held that treatment \"so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or\nexcessive as to shock the conscience\" or \"so inappropriate as\nto evidence intentional maltreatment\" violates the Eighth Amend-\nment. (See Rogers v. Evans, 792 F.2d 1052, 1058 (11th Cir. _1986)\n(emphasis supplied); accord, Howell v. Evans, 922 F.2d 712,719\n(11th Cir. 1991); Smith v. Jenkins, 919 F.2d 90, 93 (8th Cir.\n1990 _) Plaintiff's complaint of 180 doses of missed seizure medi-\ncations while suffering kidney dysfunction, orthopedic problems\nand out of control diabetes state an extreme case of bad judgment\nby the defendants and which constitutes deliberate indifference.\non the part of the defendants.\n21\n\n° f\nFor the foregoing demonstrated applications of \"deliberate\nindifference\" the district court should not have dismissed the\nplaintiff's 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 action against the defendant•\ndoctors.\nCONCLUSION\nRelief Requested\nFor the foregoing reasons, the grant of summary judgment\nand/or motions to dismiss should be reversed and the case should\nbe remanded to the district court for trial.\nDate: August 28, 1998\nT ARTHUR HALL /\n#38261-079\nU.S. Penitentismy\nP.O.

THOMAS, Sheriff; ET AL., \nDefendants,\nTOMMY B. THOMAS, Sheriff; K.W. BERRY, Major; MIKE SEALE, \nDoctor; M.W. QUINN, Major; C. TRINH, Doctor; DONALD KLEIN, \nDoctor; MARK CHASSAY, Doctor; K. HOWARD, Nurse; M. GUICE, \nDoctor; A. PHI, Doctor; KHAM LUU, Doctor,\nDefendants-Appellees.\n_______________________________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Southern District of Texas\n_______________________________\nSeptember 28, 1999\nBefore POLITZ, DeMOSS and BENAVIDES, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant Robert Arthur Hall (“Hall”) appeals the decision\nof the district court dismissing his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12132,\nclaims for failure to state a claim against appellees Sheriff\nTommy B. Thomas (“Sheriff Thomas”), Major K.W. Berry (“Major\nBerry”), Major M.W. Quinn (“Major Quinn”) and Nurse K. Howard\n(“Nurse Howard”), and on the merits as to Drs. Mike Seale, C.\nTrinh, Donald Klein, Mark Chassay, M. Guice, A. Phi and Kham Luu\n\n(collectively, “the doctors”).  We affirm.\nI.     Factual and Procedural Background\nThe United States Marshals arrested Hall on February 21,\n1995, for a violation of the terms of his parole.  They promptly\ndelivered Hall to the custody of the Harris County Jail (“HCJ”).\nWhile incarcerated, Hall objected to the quality of the medical\ntreatment he received.  So, on March 18, 1997, alleging that the\nHCJ had violated § 1983 and the ADA, Hall filed suit.  He averred\nthat the HCJ medical staff was deliberately indifferent to his\nkidney condition, to his orthopedic pains, to his diabetes, and\nto his epilepsy.  \nThe district court granted summary judgment for the\ndefendants on January 15, 1998.  In its opinion, the court found\nthat Hall had failed to state a claim against Sheriff Thomas,\nMajor Berry or Major Quinn because Hall had failed to specify any\nconduct on the part of these individuals that contributed to a\ndeprivation of a constitutional right.1  With respect to the\ndoctors, the court held that Hall had not presented any evidence\nof conduct that constituted deliberate indifference to a serious\nmedical need.  The district court also dismissed the ADA claims\n1 In a supplemental opinion dated June 5, 1998, the district court\ndismissed Hall’s case against Nurse Howard on the grounds that Hall had not\nset forth a claim against Nurse Howard that was not foreclosed by the January\n15, 1998 opinion.\n2\n\nagainst all defendants because it held that the ADA did not apply\nto prisons.  Finally, the district court held that even if the\nADA did apply to prisons, the defendants would be qualifiedly\nimmune from suit thereunder because Hall’s rights under the ADA\nwere not clearly established at the time of the alleged\nviolations.\nHall filed a pro se appeal.\nII.     Standard of Review\nWe apply de novo review to a district court’s decision to\ngrant summary judgment.  See Prytania Park Hotel, Ltd. v. General\nStar Indem. Co., 179 F.3d 169, 173 (5th Cir. 1999).  Summary\njudgment is proper if “the pleadings, depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c); see also Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  “Under this\nstandard, all fact questions must be viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, and questions of law are\nreviewed de novo.”  Horton v. City of Houston, 179 F.3d 188, 191\n(5th Cir. 1999).\nWe likewise review the district court’s decision to dismiss\na complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) de novo.  Lowrey v. Texas A & M\nUniv. Sys., 117 F.3d 242, 246 (5th Cir. 1997).  This disfavored\n3\n\nmotion should not be granted unless “it appears beyond a doubt\nthat the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his\nclaim which would entitle him to relief.”  Conley v. Gibson, 355\nU.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).  In so determining, the district court\nmust liberally construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff\nand assume that all facts pleaded in the complaint are true.  See\nBrown v. Nationsbank Corp., — F.3d — (5th Cir. 1999), available\nat 1999 WL 695692 (5th Cir. (Tex)), *4.\nIII.     The ADA Claim and Qualified Immunity\nHall argues that Pennsylvania Dep’t of Corrections v.\nYeskey, 118 S. Ct. 1952 (1998), mandates reversal of the district\ncourt’s dismissal of his ADA claim.  Moreover, Hall maintains\nthat the district court erred when it found the defendants were\nentitled to qualified immunity.  The defendants counter that,\nthough Yeskey alters one of the district court’s holdings, it\ndoes not disturb the lower court’s alternative holding regarding\nqualified immunity because Hall’s right to sue under the ADA was\nnot clearly established prior to Yeskey.\nYeskey squarely and unmistakably holds that “the ADA plainly\ncovers state institutions without any exception that could cast\nthe coverage of prisons into doubt.”  Id. at 1953.  Thus, the\ndistrict court did err, though understandably so, when it held\nthat the ADA did not apply to prisons.\nNevertheless, we need not reverse the outcome.  The district\n4\n\ncourt correctly held that the defendants were entitled to\nqualified immunity.  The wrongful act here alleged is the \nadministration of medical care to Hall; this is a discretionary\nfunction.  “[G]overnment officials performing discretionary\nfunctions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages\ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established\nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818\n(1982).  To determine “reasonableness” for purposes of this\nstandard, we look to the legal rules that were clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.  Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987).  “Objective reasonableness\nis a matter of law for the courts to decide[.]”  Williams v.\nBramer, 180 F.3d 699, 702 (5th Cir. 1999).\nUnder Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226 (1991), we must apply\na two pronged test to ascertain the viability of a defendant’s\nassertion of qualified immunity.  First, we must examine whether\nHall has pleaded an ADA violation.  See id. at 232; see also\nPetta v. Rivera, 143 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir. 1998).  The district\ncourt found that Hall had not stated a claim under the ADA.  We\nagree.  At no place in the complaint does Hall allege that a\ndefendant’s specific, individual conduct discriminated against\nhim because of his disability.  In fact, Hall claims that an\nunserved defendant, Deputy Sheriff Marcorif Thomas, mistakenly\n5\n\nindicated that Hall was not disabled (or, at least, not as\ndisabled as he was) upon his admission to HCJ in February, 1995. \nThus, any alleged discriminatory conduct could not have been\n“because of” Hall’s disability, since the relevant actors were\nnot apprised of Hall’s status as a disabled person.\nEven if Hall had stated a claim under the ADA, however, the\ndefendants would still be entitled to qualified immunity.  Under\nthe second prong of the Siegert test, we must ask whether the\ndefendants’ conduct was objectively reasonable in light of\n“clearly established” law at the time of the alleged violation. \nSiegert, 500 U.S. at 231-32; see also Evans v. Ball, 168 F.3d\n856, 860 (5th Cir. 1999).  The clearly established law prior to\nYeskey did not include the principle that the ADA applied to\nprisons because neither the Fifth Circuit nor the Supreme Court\nhad spoken on the issue.  See Gunaca v. State of Texas, 65 F.3d\n467, 475 (5th Cir. 1995) (“The right . . . was not clearly\nestablished at the time [defendant] allegedly violated it because\nneither the Fifth Circuit nor the Supreme Court had addressed\n[it.]”).  Moreover, a circuit split existed on the very question. \nCompare, e.g., Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corrections, 115 F.3d\n481, 487 (7th Cir. 1997) (ADA applies to prisons) with Amos v.\nMaryland Dep’t of Pub. Safety and Correctional Servs., 126 F.3d\n589, 601 (4th Cir. 1997), judgment vacated by 118 S. Ct. 2339\n(1998) (ADA does not apply to prisons).  And we have consistently\n6\n\nand “decisively rejected the retroactive application of new legal\nstandards to . . . claims involving qualified immunity.”  Harper\nv. Harris County, Texas, 21 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir. 1994). \nTherefore, Hall’s right to be free from discrimination on the\nbasis of his disability in prison was not clearly established at\nthe time of the alleged violations, and the defendants could not\nreasonably have known that their actions might incur liability\nunder the ADA.  For these reasons, the defendants are entitled to\nqualified immunity, and we therefore affirm the decision of the\ndistrict court on this point.\nIV.     The § 1983 Claim\nHall argues that his complaint states an Eighth Amendment\nclaim because it alleges that the medical staff failed to\nadminister 180 doses of his seizure medicine over a one year\nperiod, and that such a lapse evinces deliberate indifference to\na serious medical need.2  Hall further complains that Drs.\nChassay and Luu unethically doubled his dosage to compensate for\nthe missed medication.  The doctors counter by arguing that Hall\nhimself refused to take his seizure medication on 28 separate\noccasions, and, at other times, refused to appear when the nurse\n2 Since Hall did not argue on appeal that the medical treatment he\nreceived for his chronic kidney ailment, his orthopedic pain or his diabetes\nconstituted deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, he has\nabandoned any claims he had with respect to these matters.  See Yohey v.\nCollins, 985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993) (“[Appellant] has abandoned\nthese arguments by failing to argue them in the body of his brief.”). \n7\n\narrived to dispense the medication.  The doctors also argue that\nthe double dosages of medication were not dangerous, that they\nadequately monitored Hall’s progress on the medicine, and that no\nevidence suggests that Hall was ever over-medicated.\nThe district court found that Hall’s allegations, even if\ntrue, did not describe deliberate indifference to a serious\nmedical need.  We agree.  “To violate the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause, a prison official must have a ‘sufficiently\nculpable state of mind.’” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\n(1994) (quoting Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 297 (1991)).  “In\nprison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of ‘deliberate\nindifference’ to inmate health or safety.”  Id.  “Deliberate\nindifference to serious medical needs of prisoners,” for\ninstance, “constitutes the ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of\npain’ proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.”  Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153,\n173 (1976), order vacated by 429 U.S. 875 (1976)).  To be\ndeliberately indifferent, a prison official must “know[] of and\ndisregard[] an excessive risk to inmate health or safety[.]”\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837; see also Stewart v. Murphy, 174 F.3d\n530, 533 (5th Cir. 1999).  For this reason, allegations of\nmalpractice or negligence will never state a claim under the\nEighth Amendment.  See Estelle, 429 U.S. at 105 (“[A] complaint\nthat a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a\n8\n\nmedical condition does not state a valid claim of medical\nmistreatment under the Eighth Amendment.”); see also Stewart, 174\nF.3d at 534 (“[A]lthough inadequate medical care may, at a\ncertain point, rise to the level of a constitutional violation,\nmalpractice or negligent care does not.”).\nThe summary judgment evidence reveals that Hall refused to\ntake his seizure medicine on 28 occasions.  Moreover, Dr. Seale\ntestified that the efforts of Drs. Chassay and Luu to bring\nHall’s medication levels within therapeutic limits were not\ndangerous, and that Hall was not over-medicated.  Dr. Seale\nfurther testified that even if the nurses were intentionally\nrefusing to dispense the seizure medication to Hall–a contention\nthat Dr. Seale vigorously opposed–the doctors Hall sued were not\nresponsible for these acts, since such conduct would have been in\nclear contravention of the prison’s policy and the doctors’\nmandate.  Finally, at a doctor’s appointment on June 4, 1996,\nHall told Dr. Phi that he had “no complaints” with his seizure\nmedication.  Hall also confided that his last seizure occurred\neight months prior, presumably in November, 1995, a month in\nwhich Hall refused to take his seizure medication for two days in\na row.  In response to this testimony, Hall cites only his own\nconclusory pleadings.  Yet Hall’s subjective complaints,\nunsupported by evidence, are insufficient to defeat the doctors’\nsummary judgment evidence.  See Morris v. Covan World Wide\n9\n\nMoving, Inc., 144 F.3d 377, 380 (5th Cir. 1998) (“[T]he nonmoving\nparty may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of its\npleading, and unsubstantiated or conclusory assertions that a\nfact issue exists will not suffice.”).  \nThe overwhelming evidence demonstrates that Hall had access\nto his doctors, who prescribed a helpful medication, the dosage\nof which varied, at least in part, because of Hall’s own conduct. \nAny additional causes for Hall missing his seizure medication\ncannot be attributed to Hall’s doctors.  And despite the lower\ndosages, Hall was seizure free between November 1995 and June\n1996.  He even told his doctors he had “no complaints.”  This is\nsimply not a scenario consistent with deliberate indifference to\na serious medical need.  At its most egregious, Hall’s evidence\nmay suggest negligence, but that is insufficient to support an\nEighth Amendment claim.  We therefore agree with the district\ncourt and affirm its grant of summary judgment to the doctors.\nV.     Conclusion\nThe district court erred in finding that the ADA did not\napply to prisons, but we AFFIRM because the defendants are\nentitled to qualified immunity.  Moreover, we AFFIRM the grant of\nsummary judgment to the doctors because Hall did not present\nevidence of facts consistent with a deliberate indifference to a\nserious medical need.\n10\n\nAFFIRMED  \n11",

Hall sued the Doctors in both their official and individual capacities)\nHall's voluminous complaint asserts what is essentially four separate claims of deliberate\nindifference against the Doctors. First, Hall claims that the Doctors failed to provide him with\nadequate medical care for a chronic kidney condition. Second, Hall alleges that he did not receive\nall of his seizure medications from the medical cart nurses. Third, Hall asserts that he had a medical\nrestriction against wearing leg restraints and that certain Doctors failed to prevent security personnel\nfrom forcing him to wear leg irons in violation of this medical restriction. Finally, Hall complains\nthat an open sore was mis-diagnosed as \"herpes\" when in fact Hall was suffering from diabetes.\nIn their original answers, the Doctors denied Hall's allegations of deliberate indifference and\nasserted their entitlement to qualified immunity.\nIII.\nARGUMENT\nThis Court reviews a district court's grant of summary judgment under the same standard\napplied by the district court and in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. Woods v.\nEdwards, et al., 51 F.3d 577, 580 (5th Cir. 1995). If the movant has shown that no genuine isst_e\nof material fact remains and that he is entitled tojudgrnent as a matter of law, the non-movant must\ngo beyond the pleadings and designate the specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\ntrial. Id.\nA. The ADA and Qualified Immunity\nThe appropriate standard for determining qualified immunity isthe objective reasonableness\nof an official's conduct as measured by reference to clearly established law. Anderson v. Creighton,\n483 U.S. at 641, 107 S. Ct. at 3040; Bigford v. Taylor, 896 F.2d 972,974 (5th Cir. 1990); Pfannstiel\nv. City of Marion, 918 F.2d 1178, 1182 (5th Cir. 1990). This standard requires that a court first\ndetermine if the Hall has alleged a violation of a clearly established constitutional right, and if such\n2 Hall was arrested on a federal parole violator warrant and placed in the Harris County Jail as a federal\nprisoner on February 21, 1995. R 65, p. 2.\n3 During the period of time relevant to Hall's allegations, the Doctors were employed by the University of\nTexas Health Science Center at Houston Medical School (UT-H MS) and were providing medical services to inmates\nin the Harris County Jail pursuant to a contract between UT-H MS and Harris County.\nRCLI/hall.brf/Page 2\n\n• ,; , : .\"\nan allegation is found, then decide whether the public official's actions could reasonably have been\nthought consistent with the constitutional right. Rankin v. Klevenhagen, 5 F.3d 103 (5th Cir. 1993);\nEnlow v. Tishomingo County, Mississippi, 962 F.2d 501,508 (5th Cir. 1992).\nHall has alleged a violation under 42 U.S.C. § 12132, the ADA. At the time of this suit, there\nwas a split of authority among the Circuits as to whether the ADA applied to prison or jail inmates.\nAt the time of the alleged incidents which form the basis of Hall's lawsuit, the Fifth Circuit and the\nSupreme Court had not yet addressed this issue. Thus, it was not \"clearly established\" that Hall,\nas an inmate, enjoyed any protection under the ADA.\nThe Fifth Circuit has directed the district courts to examine only Supreme Court and Fifth\nCircuit precedent in determining whether a right is \"clearly established\" for qualified immunity\npurposes. Brady v. Fort Bend County, 58 F.3d 173, 175-76 (5thCir. 1995). Noting this disagreement\namong the circuits, and that the Fifth Circuit had not addressed the issue, the district court reasoned\nthat \"prisons do not clearly fall within the proscription of the ADA\" and properly held that Hall did\nnot clear the first hurdle under qualified immunity. R 65, p. 8.\nHall relies on Pennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, for the proposition that\nprisoners enjoy protection under the ADA. Brief, p. 5. However, his reliance on this case is\nmisplaced. Because Yeskey was decided in June of 1998, itdoes not support the notion that Hall had\na clearly established right at the time of the alleged violation of his purported rights under the ADA.\nPennsylvania Department of Corrections v. Yeskey, 118 S. Ct. 1952 (1998). Hall cannot rely on a\nretroactive application of this Supreme Court decision to overcome the Doctors entitlement to\nqualified immunity for claims brought under the ADA.\nAs the district court properly held, \"Hall's rights were not so clearly established that'a\nreasonable state prison official would have realized his actions constituted a violation of the ADA.\"\nR 65, p. 9-10. Because Hall failed to produce authority showing that he had clearly established\nrights under the ADA, the Doctors were entitled to qualified immunity against this claim. Therefore,\nsummary judgment was appropriately entered on this issue.\nB. Constitutional Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nIt is well established that no recovery may be had under § 1983 absent proof of deprivation\nof a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S.\n137, 140 (1979). Thus, the first inquiry in any suit brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is whether the\nHall has been deprived of a federally secured right. Baker, 443 U.S. at 140.\nTo state a cognizable medical claim under § 1983 and the Eighth Amendment, a Hall must\nallege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to a serious medical\nneed. Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285,292 (1976); Cay v. Estelle, 789 F.2d 318\n(5 _ Cir. 1986). In Farmer v. Brennan, the Supreme Court stated that in a claim for deliberate\nindifference the proper test is whether a prison official knows of and consciously disregards an\nRCLl&all.bffOa_3\n\n• _.• J\nexcessive risk to the inmate's health or safety. 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1979 (1994). Further, the prison\nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk\nof serious harm exists, and he must draw that inference, ld.\nIn the case at bar, the Doctors' summary judgment evidence shows that Hall's complaints\nwere thoroughly addressed with an abundance of medical evaluations and treatments. R 45, p. 27-\n34. 4 Hall has failed to come forward with any competent evidence to the contrary:\nHall complained of a chronic kidney condition upon his intake into the Harris County Jail\non February 22, 1995. That same day, Dr. Trinh ordered Hall be admitted to LBJ General Hospital,\nwhere an examination and urinalysis were performed, the results of which were negative for urinary\nor kidney problems. R 45, p. 73. Despite having several opportunities during subsequent medical\nexaminations, Hall did not reassert his belief that he had a kidney condition until November 27,\n1995, some nine months later. R 45, p. 60. Dr. Guice responded by ordering an x-ray to look for\nurinary tract stones, blood work to assess Hall's kidney function, and a urinalysis, ld. The results\nshowed no indication of kidney or urinary conditions, but did reveal that Hall had diabetes. R 45,\np. 57, 58, 60, 84, 87, 88. Thus, the medical records document that the Doctors were not deliberately\nindifferent to Hall's complaints. Rather, these claims were thoroughly evaluated by the medical\nstaff.\nHall also failed to show a serious medical condition with respect to his claim that he was\nforced to wear leg irons in violation of his medical restrictions: Neither Dr. Guice, nor any other\nhealth care provider at the Harris County Jail ever recommended that Hall not wear leg restraints.\nHall's assertion that Dr. Chassay was deliberately indifferent because he missed seeing such a\nrestriction in Hall's medical records is wholly without merit. There was no such restriction and this\nallegation is based on nothing more than Hall's misinterpretation of medical records. R 45, p. 32,\n52.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence to support Hall's contention that an open sore he claims\nwas a symptom of diabetes, was mis-diagnosed by Dr. Guice as \"herpes.\" Hall's symptoms and\nhistory were consistent with a sexually transmitted disease. R 45, p. 32. Hall did not exhibit any\nsymptoms consistent with diabetes. As previously noted, Dr. Guice discovered Hall's diabetes as\na result of blood work that the doctor had ordered to evaluate Hall's claim of urinary problems.\n4 See also the Doctors motion for summary judgment for a detailed summary of Hall's medical evaluations\nand treamaents. R 45, p. 5-13.\n5Hall, inhis brief, repeatedly points tohis own complaint and affidavit as evidence to support his allegations.\nBrief, p. 4, 6-7, 8-9, 14, 15. However, Hall's subjective complaints and conclusory allegations as set forth in his\npleadings are not competent summary judgment evidence. Morris v. Covan World Wide Moving, Inc., 144 F.3d 377,\n380 (5_Cir. 1998) citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 256, 106 S. Ct. at 2514.\n6 Hall alleges in his brief that injury from wearing leg irons prevented him from \"the free exercise of his\nreligion,\" and \"meaningful access to the courts.\" Brief, p. 10. To the extent that Hall purports to assert claims under\nthe First and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution for the first time inthis appeal, this Court has held that issues briefed\non appeal which were not raised in the district court are not considered by the reviewing court. U.S.v. Allegheny-\nLudlum Industries Inc., 517 F.2d 826, 840 (5_Cir. 1975).\nRCL1/hall.brf/Page 4\n\nFinally, Hall's claim of deliberate indifference based on the complaint that he did not receive\nall of his seizure medication is without merit. The Doctors' summary judgment evidence shows that\nif Hall did not receive all of his medication, it was because Hall failed to respond to the medical cart\nnurses as they made their rounds. 7 In fact, the medical records document twenty-eight instances of\nHall refusing medication from the nurses. R 45, p. 97-210. Doctors Chassay and Luu increased\nHall's dosages to compensate for the low level of medication in Hall's bloodstream in an attempt\nto counter Hall's own refusal to take his medication. R 45, p. 18-19. 8 These adjustments were\nappropriate in the professional medical judgment of the Doctors and reasonable under the\ncircumstances. There is no basis for Hall's assertion that he was over medicated as result of the\nDoctors attempt to compensate for Hall's own refusal to take his medication.\nThe documented medical records of the Doctors examining, diagnosing, and providing\nappropriate treatment to Hall negates a showing of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\nBass v. Sullivan, 550 F.2d 229 (5th Cir. 1977); see alsoMcCordv. Maggio, 910 F.2d 1248, 1251\n(5th Cir. 1990) (neither deliberate indifference to medical needs nor wanton infliction of pain is\nshown when there exist medical records documenting assessment and treatment of an inmate's\nmedical complaints); Martinez v. Griffin, 840 F.2d 314 (5th Cir. 1988) (dismissal appropriate where\nevidence reflected that prisoner received adequate medication and treatment). Moreover, any\ndisagreement that Hall might have with the Doctors' diagnoses and treatment of his medical\ncomplaints is not actionable under § 1983. Banuelos v. McFarland, 41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.\n1995)(disagreement between inmate and his physician conceming whether certain medical care was\nappropriate is actionable under § 1983 only under exceptional circumstances).\nEven assuming arguendo that the Doctors were somehow negligent in providing Hall with\nmedical care, claims of negligence are not actionable under § 1983. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S.\n326, 331-34, 106 S. Ct. 662, 664-7 (1986); Davidson v. Cannon, 474 U.S. 344, 347-48, 106 S. Ct.\n668, 670-71 (1986). There is no basis for Hall's self-serving, conclusory allegations of deliberate\nindifference. As evidenced by Hall's voluminous medical records, the Doctors and other medical\npersonnel at the Harris County Jail provided Hall with an abundance of medical care.\nThe district court correctly stated that its function is not to question the professional medical\njudgment of Doctors who treat inmates, but to enforce the dictates of the Constitution. R 65, p. 13.\nRelying on Estelle, the district court properly held that, \"Hall's complaints do not amount to the\n'unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain' proscribed by the Eighth Amendment and as such, must\nbe dismissed.\" 429 U.S. at 105-06. ld. Therefore, because the summary judgment evidence\nestablished there was no genuine issue of material fact for trial, the district court properly granted\nthe Doctors' motion for summary judgment.\n7Even if the nurses purposefully refused toadminister Hall's medication, a claim that isrefuted by the medical\nrecords, the Doctors would not be responsible for the nurses' actions. Hall has not produced any evidence that the\nDoctors condoned this alleged practice.\nsThis fact also appears inthe Doctors' summary judgment evidence. Exhibit A, Affidavit of Dr. Michael Seale,\nat 5.\nRCL 1/hall.brf/Page 5\n\nr\nIn addition, the Doctors are entitled to qualified immunity from Hall's claims of\nconstitutional deprivations. The competent summary judgment evidence shows the Doctors' actions\ndid not violate \"clearly established constitutional or statutory fights of which a reasonable person\nwould have known.\" Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818, 102 S. Ct. at 2738. It is Hall's burden to come\nforward with evidence, not mere conclusory allegations, that the diagnoses and treatment by the\nDoctors was objectively unreasonable. Salas v. Carpenter, 980 F.2d 299 (5thCir. 1992) (Halls have\nthe burden to come forward with summary judgment evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue\nas to whether the defendant official's conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly\nestablished law) citing Pfannstiel v. City of Marion, 918 F.2d 1178, 1183 (5_ Cir. 1990). Hall\npresented no evidence to defeat the Doctors entitlement to qualified immunity and the district court\ntherefore properly granted summary judgment.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Doctors request that the Court affirm summary judgment\nin their favor.\nRespectfully submitted,\nDAN MORALES\nAttorney General of Texas\nJORGE VEGA\nFirst Assistant Attorney General\nDREW T.
