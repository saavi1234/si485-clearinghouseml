The case was filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on December 19, 2012, where it was assigned to District Judge Patrick J. Duggan. Represented by the ACLU of Michigan, the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, the National Immigration Law Center, and a private law firm, the plaintiffs alleged that the Secretary's policy of refusing to issue drivers licenses to DACA beneficiaries violated federal law under several theories. First, they argued that the Secretary violated Michigan state law by refusing to issue licenses to people \"authorized under federal law to be present in the United States\" and sued under the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201) to have the court declare this was the case. Second, they claimed that the Secretary's actions were preempted by federal action, in violation of the Supremacy Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. Finally, they alleged that the Secretary's actions violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Under both of the latter theories, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief as well.</p><p>The plaintiffs did not need to litigate these claims. On February 1, 2013, the Secretary announced that Michigan would change its policy and issued drivers licenses to DACA recipients. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case.</p>",

Her parents had moved the family from their\nnative Lebanon to the Congo only a year before to secure their personal safety.\n“Michigan’s governor has said that his goal is to become the most ‘pro-\nimmigration’ governor in the country; there is nothing more pro-immigration\nthan allowing young people to fulfill their dreams of working and going to school,”\nsaid Miriam Aukerman, staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan, which filed the\ncomplaint with the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project and the National\nImmigration Law Center. “Secretary Johnson’s argument that someone can be\nauthorized to work, however, somehow not authorized to be present in this\ncountry, defies commonsense and breaks the law.”\nThe federal lawsuit seeks to require Michigan Secretary of State Ruth Johnson to\nissue driver’s licenses to young immigrants who qualify for the federal Deferred\nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and who are otherwise qualified\nfor a license. The DACA program allows some DREAMers – a term commonly\nused for a certain group of immigrant youth who were brought here as children –\nto live and work in the United States for a renewable period of two years, without\nfear of deportation. Johnson has refused to issue licenses to individuals granted\ndeferred action under DACA even though Michigan law requires her to issue\nlicenses to qualified residents who are authorized under federal law to be in the\ncountry, and even though the state issues licenses to all other immigrants who\nreceive deferred action.\n“Michigan should not join Arizona and Nebraska in standing in the way of talented\nyoung immigrants who want to pursue their educational and career goals,” said\nMichael Tan, staff attorney with the ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project. “We need\nto remove obstacles that prevent our youth from supporting their families,\nsucceeding at school and contributing to a country they call home, and instead\nfocus on common sense immigration reform.”\nAn estimated 1.76 million youth in the United States are eligible for the DACA\nprogram, including about 15,000 in Michigan. The ACLU, NILC and other\ncoalition partners already filed a lawsuit challenging a similar policy in Arizona on\nNovember 29.\n“Secretary Johnson’s policy denying driver’s licenses to these Michiganders is\ntotally wrong,” said Linton Joaquin, general counsel of the National Immigration\nLaw Center.  “The plaintiffs in this case, and other young people like them, want\nto continue contributing to the communities they know and love. We hope that\nthe state will move quickly to reverse its position and do what’s best for\neveryone.”\nThe complaint asks for a ruling that DACA recipients are legally authorized to be\nin the U.S. and, therefore, are eligible for licenses.  The complaint also states that\nMichigan’s policy violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by\ninterfering with federal immigration law, and violates the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause by discriminating against certain\nnoncitizens. The case, One Michigan v. Ruth Johnson, was filed in the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Detroit.\nFor more information about the lawsuit, including a copy of the\ncomplaint: www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/one-michigan-v-ruth-johnson\n \nOne Michigan v.

This lawsuit challenges the decision of the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth \nJohnson, announced on October 8, 2012, to deny driver’s licenses and personal identification \ncards to immigrant youth whom the federal government has authorized to live and work in the \nUnited States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (“DACA”) program.  Defendant \nJohnson consistently has maintained that she will issue driver’s licenses and identification cards \nto all noncitizens who are authorized under federal law to be present in the United States.  \nHowever, she refuses to grant licenses and identification cards to DACA recipients, contending \nthat although DACA recipients are authorized to live and work in the United States, DACA \nrecipients are not authorized to be present in the United States.   \n\n2.  Defendant has stated that if DACA recipients are authorized under federal law to be \npresent in the United States, she will issue them Michigan driver’s licenses and personal \nidentification cards (“ID cards”). \n3.  Plaintiffs now ask this Court to declare that under federal law DACA recipients are \nindeed authorized to be present in the United States.  Plaintiffs further ask this Court to find that \nDefendant’s policy of denying them driver’s licenses and ID cards violates the Supremacy \nClause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. \n4.  This action is brought by One Michigan, an organization of immigrant youth, and \nseveral individual Plaintiffs, who are young immigrants brought to the United States at an early \nage by their families in the hope that they could have a better life.  They have overcome many \nobstacles and worked diligently in order to succeed in school, to help their families, and to enrich \ntheir communities.  \n5.  As the President of the United States has recognized, these young immigrants “are \nAmericans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.”1  He explained, \n“it makes no sense” to deport “[t]hese . . . young people who study in our schools, . . . play in our \nneighborhoods, [a]re friends with our kids, [and] pledge allegiance to our flag.”2 \n6.  On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) announced a new program of administrative immigration relief for young \nimmigrants who came to the United States as children.  The DACA program was established to \nallow these young immigrants to remain in the United States without fear of deportation for a \nspecified, renewable period, and thus continue to contribute to American society.  \n                                                 \n1 President Barack Obama, Remarks on Immigration Reform and an Exchange with \nReporters, 2012 DAILY COMP. PRES. DOC. 1 (June 15, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/DCPD-201200483/pdf/DCPD-201200483.pdf. \n2 Id. \n2 \n \n\n7.  Under DACA, certain immigrant youth are eligible to obtain “deferred action” from \nthe federal government.  Deferred action is a mechanism used by the federal government in a \nwide variety of contexts to prevent the removal of noncitizens who would otherwise be subject to \ndeportation, and to allow those noncitizens to remain in the United States for a specified period \nof time.   \n8.  By establishing DACA, the federal government created a program under which youth \nwho meet specific criteria, such as earning a high school diploma and passing a rigorous criminal \nbackground check, can be granted deferred action.  Persons granted deferred action under DACA \nmay stay in the United States for a renewable period of two years, are shielded from removal \nproceedings during that time, and are generally eligible for federal employment authorization \nand a Social Security Number. \n9.  As a result of the federal government’s DACA program, the individual Plaintiffs, \nmembers of One Michigan, and many other Michigan immigrant youth have been granted \ndeferred action, and have received federal employment authorization and a Social Security \nNumber.  It is estimated that there are approximately 15,000 DACA-eligible youth residing in \nMichigan.3 \n10.  Under Michigan law, an otherwise qualified noncitizen residing in Michigan is \neligible for a driver’s license or ID card if she or he is authorized under federal law to be present \nin the United States.  M.C.L. §§ 257.307(1)(b); 257.307 (15); 28.291(5), 28.291(9). \n11.  As a result of being granted deferred action, individual Plaintiffs are legally present in \nthe United States because the federal government has authorized their presence and given \nPlaintiffs permission to work for a renewable period of two years.  Despite this explicit federal \n                                                 \n3 American Immigration Council, Immigration Policy Center, Who and Where the \nDREAMers Are, Revised Estimates (Oct. 16, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/who-and-where-dreamers-are-revised-estimates.  \n3 \n \n\nauthorization, Defendant now contends that the individual Plaintiffs, and all other DACA \nrecipients, are not authorized under federal law to be present in the United States.   \n12.  Prior to the federal announcement of the DACA program, the Michigan Secretary of \nState routinely issued driver’s licenses and ID cards to all noncitizens granted deferred action \nwho are otherwise qualified.  In particular, the Secretary routinely accepted federally-issued \nemployment authorization documents (“EADs”) presented by noncitizens with deferred action as \nproof that the applicant is authorized under federal law to be present in the United States. \n13.  However, after the federal government announced the DACA program, Defendant \nrevised its policy and practice to deny driver’s license and ID cards to individuals granted \ndeferred action if, and only if, that deferred action was issued pursuant to DACA.  Defendant \nalso revised its policy and practice to bar the acceptance of federally-issued employment \nauthorization documents as proof of legal presence if, and only if, those documents were issued \npursuant to DACA.  Defendant continues to accept federally-issued EADs as proof of legal \npresence from all other noncitizens. \n14.  Defendant communicated these changes to branch office staff in an October 8, 2012, \nmemorandum (hereinafter “DACA Exception Memo”), which instructed her staff not to issue \ndriver’s licenses or ID cards to DACA recipients.4   \n15.  Defendant has made it very clear that the denial of driver's licenses and ID cards to \nDACA recipients is mandatory and not subject to any exercise of discretion on the part of her \nstaff.  The office of the Michigan Secretary of State has stated repeatedly that the policy barring \nissuance of driver’s licenses and ID cards is based on the Secretary’s view that DACA recipients \nare not authorized under federal law to be present in the United States.   \n                                                 \n4 A copy of the October 8, 2012 DACA Exception Memo is attached as Exhibit 1. \n4 \n \n\n16.  Thus, Defendant’s position is that although the federal government has authorized \nDACA recipients to work in the United States, it has not authorized them to be present in the \nUnited States.  This position not only violates common sense; it also violates federal law. \n17.  In fact, under federal law, DACA recipients—like all other recipients of deferred \naction—are authorized by the federal government to be present in the United States.  Indeed, the \nindividual Plaintiffs, as DACA recipients, are not only authorized under federal law to be \npresent, but also have been issued Social Security Numbers by the federal government and have \nbeen authorized for employment by the federal government. \n18.  As a result of Defendant’s policy and practice, DACA grantees in Michigan, \nincluding individual Plaintiffs and members of One Michigan, are unable to obtain licenses to \ndrive in Michigan even though other noncitizens with deferred action and employment \nauthorization are able to obtain licenses.  This makes it difficult, and in some cases, impossible, \nfor DACA grantees in Michigan to take advantage of the employment authorization they have \nreceived from the federal government pursuant to the DACA program.  It also makes it difficult \nfor them to accomplish essential aspects of daily life, such as going to the grocery store, \nattending religious worship services, and attending school.  Moreover, proper identification \ndocuments—whether in the form of a driver’s license or personal identification card—are \nrequired for many purposes, whether to open a bank account, get on an airplane, or enter a \nfederal building.  \n19.  Defendant’s policy and practice of denying licenses and ID cards to DACA recipients \nis based on an erroneous interpretation of federal law, namely the view that individuals granted \ndeferred action under DACA are not legally present in the United States. \n5 \n \n\n20.  Defendant’s policy and practice of denying licenses and ID cards violates the \nSupremacy Clause of the United States Constitution because it is preempted by federal \nimmigration law and the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate immigration.  \n21.  Defendant’s policy and practice also violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal \nProtection Clause because it denies driver’s licenses and ID cards to DACA recipients without \nany valid justification, including even a rational basis, while continuing to provide such \ndocuments to all other individuals granted deferred action and to all other individuals with \nfederally-issued EADs. \n22.  Plaintiffs ask that this Court grant them declaratory relief and preliminary and \npermanent injunctive relief. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23.  Plaintiffs bring this action under the Constitution and laws of the United States, under \n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and under Michigan state law.   \n24.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343 over \nPlaintiffs’ federal constitutional claims.  \n25.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 over Plaintiffs’ \nstate-law claim because that claim necessarily raises a disputed and substantial question of \nfederal law, and because a decision on that question of federal law will resolve this case. See \nGrable & Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng’g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005). \n26.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202, by Fed. R. Civ. P. 57 and 65, and by the legal and equitable powers of this Court.  \n27.  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).   \n \n6 \n \n\nPARTIES \n \nPlaintiffs \n28.  One Michigan is a youth-led immigrant organization whose mission is to provide \nresources to immigrant communities, particularly undocumented youth, through organizing, \neducation and empowerment.  One Michigan focuses its organizing and advocacy efforts on \nintegrating immigrant youth into Michigan’s educational system and economy to the fullest \nextent possible.  One Michigan trains immigrant community organizers, educates immigrant \nyouth about their rights, and promotes passage of the Development, Relief, and Education for \nAlien Minors (“DREAM”) Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for qualifying \nimmigrant youth raised in the United States.   \n29.  Since the establishment of DACA, One Michigan has focused on educating \nimmigrant youth about the program.  Most of One Michigan’s members are undocumented \nyouth or DACA recipients who have grown up in the United States.   \n30.  Defendant’s decision to deny driver’s licenses and ID cards to DACA grantees has \nadversely impacted both One Michigan and its members.  Most of One Michigan’s members \neither have applications for DACA, work authorization, and a Social Security Number pending \nor have already been approved for DACA and been granted work authorization and a Social \nSecurity Number.  As a result of Defendant’s denial of driver’s licenses, many of One \nMichigan’s members are unable to drive legally in Michigan, making it difficult or impossible \nfor them to function normally in the community—including getting to and from work and \nschool.   \n7 \n \n\n31.  As a result of Defendant’s decision, several members of One Michigan are \nconsidering leaving the state.  This will decrease One Michigan’s ability to engage in its \noutreach and education activities.   \n32.  Defendant’s decision impedes One Michigan’s ability to carry out its mission, as One \nMichigan has been forced to divert its limited resources from its primary advocacy projects in \norder to assist affected individuals, such as responding to inquiries and requests for assistance \nregarding driver’s license issues.  In addition, the inability of DACA recipients to drive limits \nthe ability of many One Michigan members to participate in One Michigan activities, as well as \nthe organization’s ability to recruit potential new members to come to events, thereby restricting \nthe growth and functioning of the organization.   \n33.  Leen Nour El-Zayat is a 20-year-old resident of Dearborn, Michigan, who has lived \nin the United States since age eight. She was born in Belgium but lived in Lebanon until she was \nseven, when her family moved to the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) where her father \nhad a work visa.  When war was about to break out in the DRC, Ms. El-Zayat and her family \ncame to the United States.  On November 2, 2012, she was granted deferred action under the \nDACA program, and shortly thereafter received an EAD and a Social Security Number.  Ms. El-\nZayat graduated from Fordson High School in 2010.  She is currently a third-year pre-medical \nstudent at Wayne State University, and plans to attend medical school upon graduation.  Since \nreceiving employment authorization, Ms. El-Zayat has been looking for work in a doctor’s office \nor hospital so that she can learn the skills required for her future medical career.  Ms. El-Zayat \nfears that she will be unable to accept any offered employment and will be unable to continue her \neducation if she cannot obtain the driver’s license she needs to get to work and school.  Due to \n8 \n \n\nDefendant’s decision to deny driver’s licenses to DACA recipients, Ms. El-Zayat is precluded \nfrom obtaining a license.   \n34.  Javier Contreras is a 17-year-old resident of Ann Arbor, Michigan who came to the \nUnited States from Mexico when he was four years old.  Mr. Contreras is a senior honor roll \nstudent at Skyline High School.  He was elected homecoming king this year.  On October 26, \n2012, he was granted deferred action under the DACA program, and shortly thereafter received \nan EAD and a Social Security Number.  Mr. Contreras plans to pursue a career in mechanical \nengineering and/or computer science, and hopes to first study and then work in Michigan.  Mr. \nContreras’ college choices are limited by the fact that he cannot obtain a driver’s license, and not \nall colleges have ready access to public transportation.  Moreover, Mr. Contreras plans to work \nhis way through college, as his family cannot afford tuition.  His ability to do so is severely \ncompromised by his inability to obtain a driver’s license.  Due to Defendant’s decision to deny \ndriver’s licenses to DACA recipients, Mr. Contreras is precluded from obtaining a license.  Mr. \nContreras, a minor, brings this suit through his next friend, José Contreras. \n35.  Resilda Karafili is a 22-year old resident of Saline, Michigan who has lived in the \nUnited States since she was ten years old.  Ms. Karafili was born in Albania but came to live \nwith her aunt and uncle in Michigan in 2000.  Three years later, Ms. Karafili’s mother joined her \nin Michigan.  Ms. Karafili is currently a senior at the University of Michigan, pursuing a triple \nmajor in political science, psychology and sociology.  She would like to go to law school in the \nnear future.  On October 24, 2012, she was granted deferred action under the DACA program, \nand shortly thereafter received her EAD and Social Security Number.  Ms. Karafili fears that \nwhen she graduates in May and looks for a job to support herself and save for law school, she \nwill be unable to accept any offered employment if she cannot obtain the driver’s license \n9 \n \n\nshe needs to get to work.  Due to Defendant’s decision to deny driver’s licenses to DACA \nrecipients, Ms. Karafili is precluded from obtaining a license.   \nDefendant \n \n36.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendant Ruth Johnson has been the Secretary \nof State of Michigan.  As Secretary of State, Defendant directs the agency with the authority to \nissue driver’s licenses and personal identification cards.  M.C.L. §§ 28.291; 257.301 et seq.  As \nSecretary of State, Defendant implemented the policy and practice of denying driver’s licenses \nand personal identification cards to DACA recipients in Michigan.  Defendant is sued in her \nofficial capacity. \n \nBACKGROUND \n \nDeferred Action \n \n37.  Deferred action is a longstanding form of prosecutorial discretion in which the federal \ngovernment decides, based on humanitarian or other reasons, to refrain from seeking an \nindividual noncitizen’s removal and to authorize her continued presence in the United States.  A \ngrant of deferred action indicates that the noncitizen’s presence in the United States is known to \nthe federal government, and that the federal government has made a discretionary determination, \nbased on a review of the individual’s case, not to remove her but rather to allow her to remain in \nthe United States during a specified period. \n38.  Recipients of deferred action are eligible to receive employment authorization under \nfederal law upon a showing of economic necessity.  See 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14). \n39.  The Secretary of Homeland Security’s authority to grant deferred action to otherwise \nremovable noncitizens derives from her statutory authority over “administration and \nenforcement” of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), including the power to “perform \n10 \n \n\nsuch . . . acts as [s]he deems necessary for carrying out [her] authority.”  8 U.S.C. §§ 1103(a)(1), \n1103(a)(3).  That discretion granted by Congress includes the discretion to “decide whether it \nmakes sense to pursue removal at all.”  Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012).  \nDeferred action is simply one example of the federal government’s exercise of the discretionary \nauthority granted by Congress in immigration matters.  Indeed, Congress repeatedly has \nrecognized in the INA and other legislation that the Executive Branch has discretion to grant \ndeferred action under the immigration laws. \n40.  For four decades, the federal government has used deferred action to authorize a wide \nrange of different groups of immigrants to live and work in the United States for a temporary \nperiod.  Deferred action has been made available to victims of human trafficking and sexual \nexploitation; to relatives of victims of terrorism; to surviving family members of a legal \npermanent resident member of the armed forces; to spouses and children of U.S. citizens or \nlawful permanent residents who are survivors of domestic violence; to surviving spouses of U.S. \ncitizens; to foreign students affected by Hurricane Katrina; and to applicants for certain types of \nvisas.  In addition, federal immigration authorities may grant deferred action on an individual \nbasis, including, for example, to a person whose continued presence is desired by law \nenforcement for an ongoing investigation. \n41.  Immigrant youth brought to the country as children are thus only the most recent \nbeneficiaries of deferred action under federal immigration law. \n42.  The rationale for the DACA program is consistent with the federal government’s \nlongstanding use of deferred action to permit certain noncitizens to remain in the country.  In \nannouncing the DACA program, the DHS Secretary explained that “[o]ur Nation’s immigration \nlaws . . . are not designed to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual \n11 \n \n\ncircumstances of each case.  Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to \ncountries where they may not have lived or even speak the language.  Indeed, many of these \nyoung people have already contributed to our country in significant ways.”5   \n43.  Similarly, the President stated that the federal government decided to make deferred \naction available to immigrant youth who came to the United States as children because “it makes \nno sense . . . to expel these young people who want to staff our labs or start new businesses or \ndefend our country.”6  He explained, these individuals are “talented young people, who, for all \nintents and purposes, are Americans—they’ve been raised as Americans, understand themselves \nto be part of this country.”7 \n44.  The DACA program is intended “to lift the shadow of deportation from these young \npeople” and “to mend our Nation’s immigration policy to make it more fair, more efficient, and \nmore just.”8  \n45.  Under DACA, young immigrants who entered the United States as children and who \nmeet educational and residency requirements may apply for deferred action.  Noncitizens are \neligible for DACA if they: a) were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; b) came to the United \nStates before reaching their 16th birthday; c) have continuously resided in the United States since \nJune 15, 2007, up to the present time; d) were physically present in the United States on June 15, \n2012, and at the time of making the request for consideration of deferred action with United \nStates Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”); e) entered without inspection before \nJune 15, 2012, or had an expired lawful immigration status as of June 15, 2012; f) are currently \n                                                 \n5 Janet Napolitano, Memorandum on Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to \nIndividuals Who Came to the United States as Children 2 (June 15, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-\ncame-to-us-as-children.pdf.  \n6 President Barack Obama, Remarks on Immigration Reform, supra note 1. \n  7 Id. \n8 Id. \n12 \n \n\nin school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained \na general educational development (“GED”) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran \nof the Coast Guard or Armed Forces of the United States; and g) have not been convicted of a \nfelony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise \npose a threat to national security or public safety.9   \n46.  The DACA application process includes extensive criminal background checks.  \nUnder the DACA program, deferred action is available for a period of two years, subject to \nrenewal, and applicants who are approved may obtain employment authorization, and if such \nauthorization is granted, a Social Security Number.10 \n47.  The federal government routinely grants employment authorization to deferred action \nrecipients, including DACA recipients.  Noncitizens granted work authorization are issued \nfederal EADs, such as I-766 cards. \n48.  As of December 13, 2012, immigrant youth had filed over 350,000 DACA \napplications with USCIS.  Although the majority of those applications are still in process, USCIS \nhas granted deferred action to at least 102,965 individuals nationwide pursuant to the DACA \nprogram.11 \n                                                 \n9 USCIS, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Process—Frequently \nAsked Questions (Sept. 14, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextc\nhannel=3a4dbc4b04499310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&vgnextoid=3a4dbc4b04499310V\ngnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD.   \n10 See id. \n11 USCIS, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Process (Aug. 15 – Dec. 13, 2012) \navailable at http://www.uscis.gov/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration \n%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/DACA%20MonthlyDEC%20Report%20P\nDF.pdf.pdf. \n13 \n \n\nMichigan Practice With Respect to Driver’s Licenses and Personal Identification Cards. \n \n49.  Michigan law provides that if an applicant for a driver’s license or personal \nidentification card “is not a citizen of the United States, the applicant shall provide, and the \ndepartment shall verify, documents demonstrating his or her legal presence in the United States.” \nM.C.L. § 257.307(1)(b) (driver’s licenses); M.C.L. § 28.291(5) (personal identification cards). \n50.  Michigan law further provides that the Secretary of State may enter into agreements \nwith the United States government to verify whether an applicant for a driver’s license or \npersonal identification card who is not a citizen of the United States “is authorized under federal \nlaw to be present in the United States.”  M.C.L. § 257.307(15) (driver’s licenses); M.C.L. § \n28.291(9) (personal identification cards).  Thus, for driver’s license purposes, Michigan law \nequates a noncitizen’s “legal presence in the United States” (M.C.L. § 257.307(1)(b)) with \n“authoriz[ation] under federal law to be present in the United States” (M.C.L. § 257.307(15)). \n51.  Accordingly, in order for an otherwise qualified noncitizen residing in Michigan to be \neligible for a driver’s license or personal identification card, he or she must be authorized under \nfederal law to be present in this country.   \n52.  Consistent with the statutory requirement that noncitizens be legally present “under \nfederal law,” the policy and practice of the Michigan Secretary of State is that questions about \nwhether an individual is authorized to be present in the United States under federal law must be \ndecided by the federal government based on federal immigration law.  The Secretary of State has \nmaintained this position both prior to and after the federal government announced the DACA \nprogram.  \n53.  The policy and practice of Defendant prior to the announcement of the DACA \nprogram was that a federal EAD was sufficient to prove that an applicant’s presence was legal \n14 \n \n\nand authorized under federal law.  Specifically, the Secretary of State’s SOS-428 Form, which \nlists the documents required to obtain a driver’s license or ID card, provided that federally-issued \nEADs were acceptable proof of legal presence in the United States.12   \n54.  Because deferred action recipients are eligible for employment authorization under \nfederal law, see 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(14), in the past Defendant routinely issued driver’s \nlicenses and ID cards to deferred action recipients, as well as other noncitizens, who submitted \nfederally-issued employment authorization documents as proof of legal or authorized presence.  \nThus, under Defendant’s previous policy, DACA recipients would have been able to meet the \nrequirement that they are “authorized under federal law to be present in the United States” by \nsubmitting their EADs. \n55.  After the federal government announced the DACA program, staff in the Secretary of \nState’s office reviewed the eligibility of DACA recipients for Michigan driver’s licenses and ID \ncards.  The Secretary of State’s staff determined that the federal authorization documents being \nprovided to DACA recipients were documents that the Secretary of State accepts as proof of \nlegal presence in the United States.  Specifically, the Secretary of State’s staff noted that the \nSecretary accepted as proof of legal presence the I-766 Employment Authorization Card and the \nI-797 Notice of Action.13  The federal government issues both of these documents to qualified \nDACA recipients, as well as many other categories of legally present immigrants.  \n56.   However, Defendant subsequently carved out an exception to deny driver’s licenses \nand ID cards to DACA recipients even though they have the same federally-issued documents as \nother deferred action recipients to whom the Secretary of State continued to issue driver’s \n                                                 \n12 A copy of the SOS-428 Form from June 2012, which states that a valid, unexpired \nEmployment Authorization Card is proof of legal presence, is attached as Exhibit 2. \n13 Attached as Exhibit 3 is a copy of August 23, 2012 emails between Secretary of State \nemployees Ardiana Cera and Fred Woodhams, which state that “we currently do accept these \ndocuments as proof of legal residence.”  \n15 \n \n\nlicenses and ID cards.  On October 8, 2012, Defendant, through her senior staff, issued the \nDACA Exception Memo instructing employees to deny driver’s licenses and ID cards to \nindividuals granted deferred action under DACA.  \n57.  Defendant subsequently amended the SOS-428 Form to create an exception, \ndistinguishing DACA recipients from other residents who can demonstrate legal presence by \npresenting federally-issued EADs.  The SOS-428 Form now states that a federally-issued EAD is \naccepted as proof of legal presence, unless the federal government issued the document under \nDACA.14  In other words, under Defendant’s new policy, EADs presented by DACA recipients \nwill not be accepted as proof of legal presence for a driver’s license or identification card.  \nHowever, for all other immigrants, including all other recipients of deferred action, EADs will \ncontinue to be accepted as proof of legal presence.  \n58.  Defendant has consistently affirmed in public statements that the question of whether \na noncitizen is legally present is a question of federal law, and that individuals who are legally \npresent as a matter of federal law are eligible for a Michigan driver’s license or ID card.  For \nexample, Defendant, through her spokesperson, has stated that “[w]e rely on the federal \ngovernment to tell us who is legally here in the United States and who is not,”15 that “[w]e rely \non the feds to determine whether someone is here legally or not,”16 and that “[w]e rely on the \nfederal government to tell us who is here legally; we don't determine that.”17 \n                                                 \n14 A copy of the SOS-428 Form from October 2012, which states that a valid, unexpired \nEmployment Authorization Card is proof of legal presence except if issued to a DACA recipient, \nis attached as Exhibit 4.  The current SOS-428 Form is also posted publicly on the SOS website \n(http://www.michigan.gov/documents/DE40_032001_20459_7.pdf). \n15 Jonathan Oosting, Michigan Immigrants Rally at Capitol, Seeking Driver’s Licenses \nfor Those Allowed to Work, MLIVE  (Nov. 20, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2012/11/michigan_immigrants_rally_at_s.html (quoting \nRuth Johnson’s spokeswoman, Gisgie Gendreau).  \n16 Niraj Warikoo, Immigrants Cleared to Work in Michigan, But Not to Drive, DETROIT \nFREE PRESS (Nov. 20, 2012), available at \nhttp://www.freep.com/article/20121120/NEWS05/311200089/Immigrants-cleared-to-work-in-\n16 \n \n\n59.  Defendant’s decision to deny driver’s licenses and personal identification cards to \nDACA recipients is ostensibly based on a statement contained on the website of the USCIS \nindicating that “deferred action does not confer any lawful status.”18  This interpretation of the \nUSCIS webpage is erroneous and is based on a lack of understanding of federal law.  The USCIS \nwebpage refers to “lawful status” as a term of art under federal immigration law indicating \nspecific formal status categories, such as non-immigrant visas.  The USCIS language does not \nmean that immigrants with deferred action are unlawfully present.  Indeed, the USCIS website \nitself states that “[t]here is a significant difference between ‘unlawful presence’ and ‘unlawful \nstatus,’”19 and explains that DACA recipients are not “unlawfully present.”20  Moreover, USCIS \nhas explained that under the DACA program, “[i]f your case is deferred, you will not accrue \nunlawful presence during the period of deferred action.”21  \n60.  Federal immigration law treats legal presence and formal “immigration status” as \ndistinct issues.  An “immigration status” refers to a specific set of federal immigration \nclassifications for persons admitted as “non-immigrants,” such as recipients of business and \ntourist visas; those admitted as “immigrants,” such as permanent residents; and other limited \nclassifications established by federal law, like temporary protected status.  Individuals who lack \na specified “lawful status” may still be explicitly authorized to live and work in this country \nunder federal law, and therefore be legally present in the United States. \n61.  Defendant has consistently affirmed that if DACA recipients are legally present under \nfederal law, then DACA recipients are eligible for driver’s licenses and ID cards in Michigan.  \n                                                                                                                                                             \nMichigan-but-not-to-drive (quoting Ruth Johnson’s spokeswoman, Gisgie Gendreau).  \n17 Serena Maria Daniels, Michigan’s Immigrant Youths Put in Limbo, DETROIT NEWS \n(Dec. 2, 2012), available at http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20121203/METRO/212030340. \n18 See supra note 9 at Q6. \n19 Id. \n20 Id. at Q5. \n21 Id. at Q5. See also id. at Q1, Q6. \n17 \n \n\nHowever, Defendant misinterprets federal law by concluding that individuals granted DACA are \nnot legally present in the United States, while all other immigrants who receive deferred action \nand all other immigrants who receive federal employment authorization are legally present.  In \nfact, federal immigration law treats all recipients of deferred action the same in terms of their \nlegal authorization to be in the United States.  Federal immigration law also treats all recipients \nof federal employment authorization as legally present.    \n62.  Nearly every state in the nation, including Michigan, requires a showing by driver’s \nlicense applicants that they are authorized to be present in the United States under federal law.  \nThe overwhelming majority of states deem deferred action recipients with employment \nauthorization and Social Security Numbers eligible for driver’s licenses and personal \nidentification cards, without an exception for DACA grantees.  Aside from Michigan, only \nArizona and Nebraska have announced an intention to deny driver’s licenses to DACA grantees. \n \nGENERAL ALLEGATIONS \nDefendant’s Policy Harms Plaintiffs. \n \n63.  Defendant’s policy and practice of denying driver’s licenses to DACA recipients \nimposes onerous restrictions on the daily lives of individual Plaintiffs and members of Plaintiff \nOne Michigan.    \n64.  The ability to drive is, in most areas of the United States, a necessity of modern life.  \nDriving is essential to the ability to work, particularly in Michigan, where access to public \ntransportation is very limited.  U.S. Census Bureau statistics indicate that more than 91 percent \n18 \n \n\nof Michiganders drive to work.22  Denying driver’s licenses to DACA recipients in Michigan \nseverely frustrates their ability to obtain employment and achieve economic self-sufficiency.   \n65.  The necessity of driving to a place of employment and/or school is so important that \nMichigan provides licenses in a diverse range of circumstances.  For example, Michigan \nprovides a restricted license allowing use of a motor vehicle for employment purposes to many \nindividuals who are otherwise denied the right to operate a motor vehicle because their licenses \nhave been suspended or revoked.  See, e.g., M.C.L. § 257.304(4). \n66.  Defendant’s policy and practice cause substantial and irreparable harm to individual \nPlaintiffs and to One Michigan’s members.  Because they are not licensed to drive, they are, \ninter alia, prevented from being able to drive legally in order to go to work, school, religious \nworship services, medical appointments; to take on employment requiring a driver’s license; and \nto conduct many basic activities of daily life.  In order to manage these basic activities, \nindividual Plaintiffs and One Michigan’s members are often forced to rely on rides from others.  \nIndividual Plaintiffs and One Michigan’s members are also harmed by having an \nunconstitutional policy enforced against them. \n67.  In addition, Defendant’s unlawful policy and practice harms One Michigan’s ability \nto carry out its mission and forces it to divert resources to efforts from its primary advocacy \nprojects in order to assist members who are adversely affected by the inability to obtain a \ndriver’s license.  Defendant’s practice also harms both One Michigan as an organization and its \n                                                 \n22 U.S. Census Bureau, 2011 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates, available at \nhttp://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml (then at Quick Start Enter: Means \nof Transportation to Work Michigan, and on page 3 Click: B08301 MEANS OF \nTRANSPORTATION TO WORK) \n(http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_1Y\nR_B08301&prodType=table). \n19 \n \n\nindividual members by limiting the ability of One Michigan’s members and potential members \nto travel to events related to One Michigan’s mission and by making such travel more costly.   \nInjunctive and Declaratory Relief Is Required to Remedy the Harm Suffered by Plaintiffs. \n \n68.  The wrongful denial of driver’s licenses and ID cards to individual Plaintiffs and One \nMichigan’s members causes irreparable harm.  Such harm is irreparable because no reasonable \nremedy can make a person whole after he or she has been denied a license or ID card for a period \nof time. \n69.  Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law against Defendant’s \ndecision to deny driver’s license and ID cards to DACA recipients.   \n70.  Unless this Court grants injunctive and declaratory relief, Plaintiffs will continue to \nsuffer irreparable injury and continue to be hampered in conducting these basic activities of \neveryday life. \n \nCOUNT ONE: \n \nDeclaratory Judgment – DACA Recipients are  \nLegally Authorized under Federal Law to be Present in the United States \n(Violation of State Law Raising Disputed and Substantial Federal Question) \n \n71.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs of this complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n72.  An individual who is “authorized under federal law to be present in the United States” \nand who has “documents demonstrating his or her legal presence in the United States” is eligible \nfor a Michigan driver’s license or a personal identification card.  M.C.L. §§ 257.307(15); \n28.291(9); 257.307(1)(b); 28.291(5). \n73.  By refusing to grant driver’s licenses to DACA recipients, Defendant is in violation \nof state law. \n20 \n \n\n74.  The violation of Plaintiffs’ rights under the Michigan driver’s license statutes turns on \nan embedded question of federal law: namely, whether DACA recipients are “authorized under \nfederal law to be present in the United States” (i.e., “legally present in the United States”).  That \nquestion implicates significant federal interests, is disputed and is substantial. \n75.  Indeed, Defendant herself has maintained that federal law determines whether an \nindividual is authorized under federal law to be present in the United States.  Defendant has \nfurther maintained that if DACA recipients are authorized under federal law to be present in the \nUnited States, she will issue driver’s licenses and ID cards to them. \n76.  Under the federal immigration system, deferred action recipients, including DACA \ngrantees, are authorized to remain in the United States for the period of the deferred action grant.  \nDeferred action recipients, including DACA grantees, who obtain employment authorization are \nauthorized not only to reside in the United States but are also authorized to work in the United \nStates during the period of their deferred action.   \n77.  Noncitizens granted deferred action pursuant to the DACA program are thus \nauthorized under federal law to be present in the United States during the two-year deferred \naction period, and during any extensions of the grant.   \n78.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to declare that they are authorized under federal law to be \npresent in the United States.  Plaintiffs seek only a declaratory judgment on this embedded \nquestion of federal law that is necessary for the proper application of the state law.  Plaintiffs do \nnot seek injunctive relief with respect to this claim. \n \n21 \n \n\nCOUNT TWO: \nDefendant’s Policy is Preempted \n(Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Clause 2, of the United States Constitution) \n \n79.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs of this complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n80.  The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides: “This \nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and \nall Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the \nsupreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  United States Constitution, \nArticle VI, clause 2. \n81.  Pursuant to the Supremacy Clause, federal law preempts state regulation of any area \nover which Congress has expressly or impliedly exercised exclusive authority or which is \nconstitutionally reserved to the federal government.  Any state law that conflicts or interferes \nwith federal law is also preempted. \n82.  The federal government has sole and exclusive power to regulate immigration.  The \nfederal government’s exclusive power over immigration matters is inherent in the nation’s \nsovereignty, and derives from the U.S. Constitution’s grant to the federal government of the \npower to “establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,” id., art. I, § 8, cl. 4, and to “regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations,” id., art. I, § 8, cl. 3. \n83.  As part of its immigration power, the federal government has exclusive authority to \nenact and to enforce regulations concerning which noncitizens to admit, exclude, remove, or \nallow to remain in the United States.  The federal government also has exclusive authority over \nthe terms and conditions of a noncitizen’s stay in the United States.  Further, the federal \n22 \n \n\ngovernment has exclusive authority to classify noncitizens, which includes determining the \ncategories of noncitizens that are granted federal authorization to be present in the United States.  \nIn contrast, state governments have none of these powers. \n84.  Pursuant to its powers, the federal government has established a comprehensive \nsystem of laws, regulations, procedures, and administrative agencies that determine, subject to \njudicial review, whether and under what conditions a noncitizen may enter and live in the United \nStates, when a noncitizen may be subject to removal, and when a noncitizen may be eligible for \nrelief from removal, either temporarily or permanently. \n85.  Under that system, Congress delegated to the federal Executive broad discretion over \nthe manner of the execution of the immigration laws, including the manner of their enforcement.  \nThat discretion includes the discretion to decide not to pursue the removal of a noncitizen who \nmay be removable and to authorize such persons to be present in the United States, including by \ngranting deferred action. \n86.  The State of Michigan has elected to condition the eligibility of a noncitizen for a \ndriver’s license or ID card on whether the noncitizen is authorized to be in the United States \nunder federal law.  Having decided to determine eligibility for driver’s licenses based on federal \nimmigration law, Michigan may not create its own classifications regarding which immigrants \nare authorized to be present in the United States.  Therefore, Defendant’s policy of denying \ndriver’s licenses and personal identification cards to DACA recipients is preempted by federal \nlaw. \n87.  Defendant’s policy of distinguishing between DACA recipients and other recipients \nof deferred action impermissibly regulates immigration by, inter alia, creating a new, state-based \nclassification of noncitizens that treats DACA recipients as though they were unauthorized to be \n23 \n \n\nin the United States and unlawfully present here.  However, DACA recipients, like other \nrecipients of deferred action, are legally present and authorized to be in the United States during \nthe deferred action period.   \n88.  Through the DACA Exception Memo, Defendant has created her own state \nclassification of noncitizens whose presence in the United States is “authorized” or “legal,” and \nerroneously classified DACA recipients as lacking federal authorization to be present in the \nUnited States.  Defendant’s creation of its own immigration classification impermissibly intrudes \non the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate immigration, and therefore violates \nthe Supremacy Clause. \n89.  Defendant’s policy is further preempted because it conflicts with, frustrates, and \nserves as an obstacle to federal immigration law, goals, and policies.  For example, Defendant’s \nclassification of DACA recipients as unauthorized and not legally present conflicts with their \ntreatment under federal immigration law and frustrates Congress’s intent that the federal \ngovernment alone have discretion to determine whether to authorize a noncitizen to remain in the \nUnited States.  Defendant’s misclassification of DACA recipients directly and fundamentally \nconflicts with federal law, in violation of the Supremacy Clause. \n90.  In sum, because Defendant’s policy is preempted by federal law, it violates the \nSupremacy Clause and is unconstitutional. \n \nCOUNT THREE: \n \nDefendant’s Policy Violates Equal Protection  \n(Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution) \n   \n91.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate all of the allegations contained in the previous \nparagraphs of this complaint as though fully set forth herein. \n24 \n \n\n92.  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “[n]o \nState shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”   \n93.  Defendant’s policy of denying driver’s licenses and ID cards to DACA recipients \nconstitutes impermissible discrimination against certain noncitizens on the basis of alienage and \ndeprives them of equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution. \n94.  Defendant’s decision to single out and deny driver’s licenses and ID cards to \nindividuals granted deferred action under the DACA program, while granting licenses and ID \ncards to all other individuals granted deferred action or other forms of temporary authorization to \nremain in the United States, and to all other individuals granted federal employment \nauthorization, does not further any legitimate state goal.  Because Defendant’s differential \ntreatment of DACA recipients has no valid justification, not even a rational basis, it violates the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for the following relief: \nA.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 that Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals grantees are authorized under federal law to be present in the United \nStates.  \nB.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 that Defendant’s policy and \npractice of denying driver’s licenses and personal identification cards to Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals grantees is unlawful and invalid because it is preempted under the \nSupremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  \n25 \n \n\nC.  A declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 that Defendant’s policy and \npractice of denying driver’s licenses and personal identification cards to Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals grantees is unlawful and invalid because it violates the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  \nD.  A preliminary and permanent injunction under Counts Two and Three enjoining \nDefendant, her officials, agents, employees, assigns, and all persons acting in concert or \nparticipating with her from implementing or enforcing the illegal policy and practice of \ndenying Michigan driver’s licenses and personal identification cards to Deferred Action \nfor Childhood Arrivals grantees who are otherwise qualified.  \nE.  An order awarding Plaintiffs’ costs of suit, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and any other applicable law. \nF.  Such other and further relief as the Court deems equitable, just, and proper. \n   \n26 \n \n\nRespectfully submitted,   \nMiriam J.
