Indeed, plaintiffs' ability to recover for Title IX violations are wholly separate from the determination of whether defendant was in violation of Title IX.

    "summary": "<p>On December 18, 2003, current and former female wrestlers at the University of California-Davis (\"UC Davis\") filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The plaintiffs sued UC Davis on behalf of all current and future female Davis students denied equal athletic participation opportunities and scholarships. The plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under Title IX and also asserted equal protection claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.</p><p>During the 2000-2001 academic year, Davis eliminated all women from the wrestling team. After the students protested to administrators and filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), Davis agreed to permit women again to participate in varsity wrestling, conditioned on their ability to beat male wrestlers in their weight class, using men's collegiate wrestling rules. As a result of these new requirements, the female students were unable to qualify for the wrestling team and lost the benefits associated with varsity status, including scholarships and academic credit.</p><p>In April 2006, just before the scheduled hearing on class certification, the plaintiffs requested a stay due to their attorney's serious illness. During the ten-month stay, the only named plaintiff still attending Davis graduated.  The plaintiffs moved to add as plaintiffs three students, all then enrolled at Davis. On March 20, 2007, the District Court (Judge Frank C. Damrell) denied the motion, holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet the good cause required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 when such a motion is filed after the issuance of a scheduling order. Without any named plaintiffs currently attending Davis, the plaintiffs stipulated to dismissal of the class claims for injunctive relief.</p><p>In April 2008, the District Court dismissed the § 1983 claim as \"subsumed\" by the Title IX claim. The District Court then granted the University's motion for summary judgment, holding that the students had failed to perfect their Title IX claim by failing to give Davis advance notice and the opportunity to cure.</p><p>The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On February 8, 2010, in a published opinion (amended on April 20, 2010), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that (1) the plaintiffs' challenge to the district court's denial of their motion to add additional plaintiffs was moot; (2) the plaintiffs were not required to give university notice and an opportunity to cure an alleged Title IX violation before bringing suit; (3) genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment on the plaintiffs' Title IX ineffective accommodation claim; (4) Title IX did not preclude claim under § 1983 to enforce rights under Equal Protection Clause; and (5) § 1983 claim was not barred by statute of limitations. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.  602 F.3d 957 (9th Cir. 2010).</p><p>On December 8, 2010, the Court (Judge Frank C. Damrell, Jr.) denied the University's renewed motion for summary judgment.  A fifteen day bench trial was held beginning May 2011.  </p><p>On August 3, 2011, District Judge Frank C. Damrell, Jr., J., held that the university failed to effectively accommodate athletic interests and abilities of members of both sexes.  However, the plaintiffs lost on their other theories of Title IX liability, as well as their Equal Protection Clause claims. Specifically, Judge Damrell held that (1) the university's failure to sponsor separate women's team did not contravene Title IX; (3) the assistant athletic director could not be held liable for alleged Equal Protection violations; and (4) other officials were entitled to qualified immunity as to alleged Equal Protection violations. 816 F. Supp. 2d 869 (E.D. Cal. 2011).</p><p>On December 8, 2011, the Court ordered this case be set for a settlement conference to decide damages. After months of negotiations, the parties and their counsels reached agreement on all major terms of the settlement. The university agreed to pay $1,350,000 in attorneys' fees and costs incurred during the lengthy case. On April 6, 2012, the action was dismissed without prejudice and the case was closed. </p>",

After the District Court dismissed the § 1983 claim and granted summary judgment to the defendants on the Title IX claim, the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for further proceedings. By August 2011, the District court found for the plaintiffs, based on Davis's failure to demonstrate a continuing practice of program expansion. The plaintiffs lost on their other theories of Title IX liability, as well as other Equal Protection Clause claims.

Defendants provide male students with substantially \n25  more opportunities to participate in varsity intercollegiate athletics than they provide to female \n26  students.  Defendants also provide some sports for males but not females even though there are \n27  females who want to participate (e.g., wrestling).  By discriminating against females in this way, \n28  Defendants deny them equal opportunity to participate in intercollegiate athletics, to receive \n1 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 2 of 15\n1  athletic financial assistance, and to receive all the benefits commensurate with such athletic \n2  participation (e.g., preferred admissions, priority registration, coaching, tutoring, access to \n3  facilities, weight and conditioning training, medical services, equipment, transportation, \n4  competition scheduling, etc.). \n5  Named plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian, Lauren Mancuso, and Nancy Chiang are, or at all \n6  times relevant herein, were female students at UCD who sought but were denied the opportunity to \n7  participate in varsity intercollegiate athletics and to receive athletic financial assistance.  More \n8  particularly, Plaintiffs participated in the varsity wrestling program at UCD until Defendants \n9  eliminated women but not men from the program.'  Despite numerous complaints and public \n10  protests, Defendants continue to refuse to reinstate a women's wrestling program.  See \n11  accompanying declarations. \n12  There are many other prospective and future UCD female students who participate in \n13  women's wrestling in California and elsewhere.  There are more than 1,000 females who \n14  participate on boys' high school wrestling teams in California alone.  Ex. A.  There are even more \n15  females who participate on girls' high school and club wrestling teams.  Others participate as \n16  individuals in open meets as part of USA Wrestling, the United States Girls' Wrestling Association \n17  the California Women's Wrestling Association, and other groups.  Even after Defendants quite \n18  publicly eliminated the women's wrestling program and eliminated the women's division of the \n19  UCD Aggie Open wrestling tournament, women continued to seek wrestling opportunities at UCD \n20  Ex. B, Deposition of new wrestling coach Le1111ie Zalesky at pp. 24-28 ..  Although it is not possibl \n21  to determine exactly how many of these females would apply to UCD ifit offered women's \n22  wrestling, given the small number of college opportunities available to women, it is likely that the \n23  vast majority of them would do so.  Most, ifnot all, are deterred from applying or enrolling so Ion \n24  as UCD fails to offer it.  Certainly, none will be recruited to wrestle at UCD so long as UCD fails \n25 \n26 \n,/  Named plaintiff Christine Ng also participated in wrestling at UCD and was also denied \n27  equal opportunity when Defendants eliminated women's wrestling, but she graduated \nshOlily before the filing of this action.  Thus, she is not proposed as a class \n28 \nrepresentative.  Complaint,-r,-r 12, 52-58. \n2 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 3 of 15\nI  to provide the opportunity. \n2  Defendants also fail and refuse to provide athletic participation and scholarship \n3  opportunities for females in other sports, even though there are females who have the interest and \n4  ability to participate in such varsity intercollegiate sports as wrestling, bowling, field hockey, and \n5  rugby.  Five years of UCD club sport rosters produced by Defendants indicate that hundreds of \n6  UCD female students participate in these sports at the club level each and every year even without \n7  recruiting, without scholarships, and without varsity benefits: \n8  10-15 females \n9  10-47 females \n10  10-24 females \nII  70-90 females \n12  15-30 females \n13  15-34 females \n14  Horse Polo  =  10-39 females \n15  Rugby  54-62 females \n16  Skating  II-IS females \n17  Skiing  =  10-25 females \n18  See UCD club sport rosters for 2000-2001 through 2004-2005 at Exs. C-G.  See also UCD \n19  women's bowling rosters at Ex. H.  Female students have participated in some of these clubs for \n20  more than 30 years.  Many have formally requested varsity status without success.  See sample \n21  portions of varsity sport proposals at Exs. I (bowling), J (field hockey), K (rugby), L (horse polo). \n22  These club sport athletes, unlike varsity athletes, must fund their own sports, hire their own \n23  coaches, arrange their own schedules, find practice and competition facilities, and pay for their \n24  own transportation.  Defendants do not provide them with any of the benefits of varsity status or \n25  with athletic scholarships.  The fact that these women's club teanlS have existed for so long \n26  without any of these benefits, each year attracting new students, confirms the high level of interest \n27  that UCD's female students have in participating in these sports. They want to play so badly that \n28  they are willing to pay to do it rather than be paid (via scholarships).  Yet, Defendants continue to \n3 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 4 of 15\n1  deny them opportunity to do so on a varsity level. \n2  Many prospective and future UCD female students throughout California and elsewhere \n3  also participate in these sports.  There are more than 5,000 who participate on ClF -sanctioned high \n4  school teams and still more who participate on club teams and as individuals, including 4500 in \n5  badminton, over 2900 in field hockey, and 432 in skiing.  Ex. A.  All of these females are or will \n6  be denied the opportunity to participate in these sports at UCD unless and until Defendants are \n7  ordered to increase the number of female athletic participation opportunities in order to achieve \n8  gender equity. \n9  More than 11,000 female undergraduates attend ucn every year, about 56% of the total \n10  undergraduate population.  But Defendants provide them with less than 400 varsity athletic \nII  opportunities.  Thus, there is a huge untapped pool of females who are denied the opportunity to \n12  participate in athletics or to receive athletic scholarships and who receive the message of second \n13  class status that discrimination against them and their female classmates sends.  Ex. M (enrollment \n14  and participation numbers from recent UCD disclosures under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure \n15  Act; Defendants have not yet produced the EADA form for 2004-2005). \n16  So long as Defendants continue to fail and refuse to provide females with equal opportuni \n17  to participate in athletics, to receive athletic financial assistance, and to receive the benefits \n18  commensurate therewith, they will continue to violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n19  1972 (20 U.S.C. 1621 et seq.), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \n20  U.S. Constitution (as enforced through 42 U.S.C. 1983), and various California state laws. \n21  Plaintiffs filed this class action in order to remedy this sex discrimination against \n22  themselves and the proposed class of current, prospective, future, and deterred female students wh \n23  are denied equal opportunity in athletics.  On behalf of the class and themselves, they seek \n24  declaratory relief that identifies Defendants' discriminatory actions and injunctive relief that \n25  requires Defendants to increase athletic participation and scholarship opportunities for women by \n26  adding women's varsity sports, including wrestling. On behalf of themselves only, the named \n27  plaintiffs seek incidental monetary damages associated with tile elimination of their own athletic \n28  participation and scholarship opportunities.

She participated in wrestlin \n27  in high school and eurolled at UCD for the purpose of participating in varsity wrestling.  She did s \n28  until Defendants eliminated women from the program.  She complained about Defendants' \n5 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 6 of 15\nI  elimination of women from the program and Defendants' withdrawal of her athletic financial \n2  assistance.  She still seeks reinstatement of women's wrestling and elimination of Defendants' \n3  discrimination against females in the UCD athletic program. See accompanying Declaration of \n4  Lauren Mancuso. \n5  Named plaintiff Arezou Mansourian was a female student at UCD at the time she filed this \n6  class action complaint, at the time she provided Defendants with notice of the class action, and at \n7  all times relevant herein.  She also participated in wrestling .in high school and also emolled at \n8  UCD for the purpose of participating in varsity wrestling. She did so until Defendants eliminated \n9  women from the program.  She also complained about Defendant' elimination of women from the \n10  program and Defendants' withdrawal of her athletic financial assistance.  She also seeks \nII  reinstatement of women's wrestling and elimination of Defendants' discrimination against females \n12  in the UCD athletic program.  See accompanying Declaration of Arezou Mansourian. \n13  Named plaintiff Nancy Chiang was a female student at UCD and participated in varsity \n14  wrestling until Defendants eliminated women from the wrestling program.  She left UCD when it \nIS  eliminated women's wrestling.  She now takes classes part time at Sacramento City College, but \n16  she would return to UCD and participate in women's wrestling if Defendants reinstated the \n17  program. \n18  Plaintiffs filed this class action in December, 2003.  They sought to file a motion for class \n19  certification in the spring of 2004, but entered into an agreement with Defendants to delay doing s \n20  until Defendants could engage in discovery, including depositions of the named plaintiffs. \n21  Accordingly, Plaintiffs instead filed a notice of class action status to further preserve their rights. \n22  By the time of the hearing on this matter, Defendants will have completed all such depositions. \n23  ARGUMENT \n24  The COUli should certifY the proposed class because Class Plaintiffs meet the requirements \n25  ofFRCP 23(a) and (b)(2).

THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES THE FOUR REOIDREMENTS OF \nRULE 23(a) \n10 \n11  Rule 23(a) provides that a proposed class must satisfY four requirements: \nre \n12  One or more members of a class may sue or  sued as representative \nparties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder \n13  of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative \n14  parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the \nrepresentative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests \n15  ofthe class. \n16  The proposed class satisfies all  these requirements. \n17  1.  The proposed class is numerous and joinder of all class members is \nimpracticable \n18 \n19  The proposed class is too numerous for joinder.  As set forth above, it includes hundreds 0 \n20  current female students and thousands of prospective and future female students.  A common \n21  sense assessment of the number of females who participate or want to participate in sports not \n22  offered for women at UCD confirms the impracticability of joinder. Moeller v.

Defendants either engage in \n16  sex discrimination or they do not.  They either violate Title IX and the other civil rights laws or \n17  they do not.  They either fail to offer equal athletic participation and scholarship opportunities for \n18  females or they do not.  If they do, then Defendants will have to remediate their discrimination by \n19  adding new sports and new opportunities for females.  If they do not, then they need not do so. \n20  Walters v. Reno, 145 F.3d 1032, 1047  (9th Cir. 1998);  United States v.

Buchanan, 416 F.Supp. 328, \n23  337 (D.Del. I 976)(danger of inconsistent verdicts). \n24  The factual issues in this case are also common to all class members.  All proposed class \n25  members seek to participate in sports that UCD does not offer for females.  They all want UCD to \n26  provide participation and scholarship opportunities in their sports.  They are all currently denied \n27  those opportunities. \n28 \n10 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 11 of 15\nI  In sum, all class members suffer the exact same harm, all seek the same remedy, and all \n2  rely on the same legal theories of sex discrimination to obtain that remedy - more varsity athletic \n3  participation and scholarship opportunities for females.  The proposed class clearly satisfies the \n4  requirements of Rule 23(a)(2). \n5  3.  The class representatives' claims are typical of those of \nthe class \n6 \nTypicality merely requires that the claims of the class representatives are typical of or \n7 \n\"reasonably coextensive with\" those of the class as a whole.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d \n8 \nlOll,  1020 (9th Cir. 1998).  Typicality exists when \"each cbss member's claim arises from the \n9 \nsame course of events, and each class member makes similar legal arguments to prove the \n10 \ndefendant's liability.\"  Armstrong, 275 F.3d at 868.  It is established whenever the class members \n11 \nall suffer from a discriminatory policy or practice that is applied to the whole class.  Armstrong, \n12 \n275 FJd at 869; Ballard, 186 F.R.D. at 595 (class representative's claim is typical ifit ariases fro \n13 \nthe same event, practice, or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of the class). \n14 \nPlaintiffs' claims here are not only typical, but identical, to those ofthe class.  All want to \n15 \nparticipate in and to receive athletic scholarships for sports that Defendants do not offer for \n16 \nwomen.  All are denied access to this educational opportunity (varsity athletics) because \n17 \nDefendants fail to offer equal athletic participation and scholarship opportunities for females.  All \n18 \nclaim that this denial constitutes sex discrimination  in violation of Title IX, the Equal Protection \n19 \nClause, and various California state laws.  The legal claims and remedies are exactly the same. \n20 \n21  4.  The named plaintiffs and their counsel are adequate class \nrepresentatives \n22 \n23  Class representation is adequate if\"(I) the attorney representing the class is qualified and \n24  competent; and (2) the class representatives do not have interests antagonistic to the remainder of \n25  the class.\" Haley, 169 F.R.D. at 649-650.  This requirement ensures that the representatives \n26  do not have any conflicts with the other class members and they vigorously have prosecuted and \n27  will continue to prosecute this action.  Hanlon, 150 F 3d at 1020, citing Lerwill v. Inflight Motion \n28  Pictures, Inc., 582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir. 1978). \n11 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 12 of 15\n1  Class counsel in this case has litigated complex cases for more than 15 years and is \n2  experienced in Title IX class actions as both lead and advisery counsel (e.g., Fritson v. Minden; \n3  Thomsen y. Fremont; Erickson v. Holdrege; Praster v. North Platte; Sabel v. Danbury; and Price v. \n4  Wilton;). Counsel lectures widely on Title IX and has taught classes and continuing legal educatio \n5  on the subject. See accompanying Declaration of Kristen Galles .. \n6  Class plaintiffs do not have any conflicts with the class.  They all want to enjoin \n7  Defendants to comply with gender equity laws and to add more athletic participation and \n8  scholarship opportunities for women.  Class plaintiffs have also already vigorously prosecuted this \n9  case for two years, have responded to hundreds of document requests, have responded to extensive \n10  interrogatories posed by each defendant, and have sat for depositions.  They have more than \n11  demonstrated their commitment to exposing Defendants' discrimination and to fixing it. \n12  B.  THE PROPOSED CLASS SATISFIES RULE 23(b)(2) \n13  In addition to satisfYing the Rule 23(a) requirements, Plaintiffs must satisfY one of the thre \n14  categories of Rule 23(b).  This action falls squarely under Rule 23(b)(2), under which a class is \n15  certifiable if: \n16  the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final \n17  injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect \nto the class as a whole .... \n18 \n19  Here, Defendants have acted on grounds applicable to the class in that they have \n20  discriminated against and continue to discriminate against females by failing to provide them with \n21  equal opportunity in varsity athletics.  In other words, Defendants choose to allocate more \n22  opportunities and more resources to males than females.  The class seeks declaratory and injunctiv \n23  relief to expose this discrimination .and to remedy it. \n24  Subsection 23(b )(2) was specifically added by Congress in 1966 to reaffirm that civil rights \n25  cases such as this one could be brought as class actions.  See 7A   Wright & Miller, Federal Practice \n26  and Procedure, § 1776, at p. 495 (1984 & Supp. 1994); Penson v. Terminal Transport Co., 634 \n27  F.2d 989, 993 (5th Cir. 1981). The advisory committee notes to Rule 23(b)(2) state that the rule is \n28  satisfied \"even if the action or inaction 'has taken effect or is threatened only as to one or a few \n12 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 13 of 15\n1  members oft he class, provided it is based on grounds which have general application to the class.'\" \n2  Santiago, 72 F .RD. at 626, citing Advisory Committee's Notes to proposed Rules of Civil \n3  Procedure, 39 F.RD. 69, 102 (1966).  Thus, even ifthe named plaintiffs were the only female \n4  athletes immediately threatened by Defendants' discriminatory practices, this action would satisfY \n5  the requirements of Rule 23(b )(2) because the discriminatory practices are generally applicable to \n6  all members of the prospective class. \n7  Lawsuits alleging class-wide discriminatory practice8 are particularly well-suited for class \n8  treatment, especially under Rule 23(b )(2), because they involve the same legal and factual issues \n9  and are subject to a single injunctive remedy.  EEOC v. General Telephone Company of the \n10  Northwest, Inc., 599 F.2d 322 3228-329 (9th Cir. 1979)(discrimination cases are inherently class-\n11  based); Senter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 525 (6th Cir. 1986). \n12  In order to effectively eradicate such discrimination and to implement the broad remedial \n13  purposes of civil rights statutes, courts liberally apply all the requirements ofFRCP 23 to such \n14  cases.

See also Crumon v. University of Chicago, 441 \n24  U.S. 677, 706 (1979)(discusses broad remedial purpose of Title IX). \n25  The inherent class nation of discrimination cases is even more apparent in athletics cases, \n26  because the educational progranl itself is sex segregated.  Defendants offer entirely separate \n27  athletic programs for males and females.  Males compete against other males on male teams and \n28  females compete with against other females.  Males and females do not compete against each \n13 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 14 of 15\n1  other.  Thus, Defendants have complete control over how many athletic opportunities to provide \n2  only for males and how many to provide only for females.  They do this by deciding which sports \n3  to offer and how many participation opportunities to provide for each sport (based upon the nature \n4  of the sport itself).  Defendants also have complete control over how many athletic scholarships to \n5  offer to male and athletes and how many to offer to female athletes. \n6  Because Defendants have acted in a discriminatory manner with respect to all class \n7  members, and because the named plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy that \n8  discrimination, the proposed class is properly certifiable under Rule 23 (b)(2). \n9  CONCLUSION \n10  The class is so numerous, diverse, and fluid that joinder is impracticable.  This action \n11  involves facts and issues that are common to all class members, namely whether Defendants \n12  discriminate against females in the allocation of athletic participation opportunities and athletic \n13  financial assistance.  The claims of the named class representatives are typical of those ofthe \n14  proposed class, because Defendants denied them the opportunity to participate in a varsity sport \n15  wrestling and to receive athletic financial assistance for that sport.  The named plaintiffs and their \n16  counsel will also provide adequate representation for the class as they already have for thus far in \n17  this litigation.  Accordingly, Class Plaintiffs request that this Court certifY this case as a class \n18  action as set forth herein. \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n14 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 69    Filed 12/08/05   Page 15 of 15\n1  Dated: December 7, 2005  AREZOU MANSOURIAN, et aI., \nPlaintiffs. \n2 \n3 \n4 \nKristen Galles \n5  Cal.

For the reasons set forth\n3 below,2 defendants’ motion is GRANTED.\n4 BACKGROUND3\n5 In the 1990s, varsity wrestling at UCD included both women\n6 and men.  (DRAF ¶ 53.)  Plaintiffs Mansourian, Mancuso, and Ng\n7 are former female wrestlers at UCD.  (DRAF ¶ 3.)  In 2000, UCD\n8 ordered that all women be removed from the wrestling program. \n9 (DRAF ¶ 4.)\n10 Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a number of complaints with\n11 the U.S. Department of Education’s (“DOE”) Office for Civil\n12 Rights (“OCR”).  Plaintiff Ng filed the first complaint on April\n13\n14\n1 Plaintiff Nancy Nien-Li Chiang voluntarily dismissed\nall claims in this action on June 12, 2007.  (See Mem. & Order\n15\n(Docket #195), filed July 12, 2007.)\n16\n2 Because oral argument will not be of material\nassistance, the court orders these matters submitted on the\n17\nbriefs.  E.D. Cal. L.R. 78-230(h).\n18\n3 Unless otherwise noted, the facts contained herein are\nundisputed.  (See Pls.’ Response to Defs.’ Stmt. of Undisputed\n19\nFacts (“PRUF”), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  Where the facts are\ndisputed, the court recounts plaintiffs’ version of the facts. \n20\n(Defs.’ Response to Pls.’ Stmt. of Additional Disputed Facts\n(“DRAF”), filed Mar. 31, 2008.) \n21\nThe court notes that both parties filed motions to strike\n22\nand numerous objections, objecting to various aspects of evidence\nsubmitted in support of and in opposition to the motion for\n23\nsummary judgment.  (See Pls.’ Mot. to Strike (Docket #320), filed\nMar. 6, 2008; Pls.’ Opp’n to Judicial Notice (Docket #323), filed\n24\nMar. 6, 2008; Pls.’ Objections to Evidence (Docket #338), filed\nMar. 6, 2008; Defs.’ Objections to Evidence (Docket #344), filed\n25 Mar. 31, 2008; Defs.’ Mot. to Strike (Docket #348), filed Mar.\n31, 2008; Pls.’ Objections to Evidence (Docket #366), filed Apr.\n26 17, 2008.)   Except where otherwise noted herein, the court finds\nthe parties’ objections irrelevant to the motion, as the court\n27 does not rely upon the subject evidence in rendering its\ndecision.  As such, the parties’ motions to strike are DENIED and\n28 the objections of both parties are OVERRULED as moot.\n2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 3 of 22\n1 25, 2001, alleging “[t]he Athletic Administration will not allow\n2 me to wrestle, nor any other female, and I strongly believe it is\n3 due to my sex.”  (PRUF ¶ 93; Defs.’ Ex. GGG, filed Jan. 11, 2008,\n4 at W46.)4  Plaintiff Ng filed a second supplemental complaint\n5 with the OCR on May 14, 2001, which included allegations that UCD\n6 “recruits ‘student-athletes’ for its wrestling program but\n7 prohibits such recruitment of females,” “prohibits females from\n8 participating in regularly scheduled competition,” “denies women\n9 wrestlers the use of the ‘intercollegiate training room,’” and\n10 “denies women wrestlers the services of its athletic trainers.” \n11 (PRUF ¶ 95; Defs.’ Ex. HHH, filed Jan. 11, 2008, ¶¶ 1-4.)  On\n12 June 26, 2001, plaintiff Ng submitted a third supplemental\n13 complaint on behalf of herself and plaintiffs Mansourian and\n14 Mancuso.  (PRUF ¶ 96.)  This complaint alleged the “UC-Davis\n15 athletic department granted the male members of the wrestling\n16 team the scholarships awarded by wrestling coach, Mike Burch in\n17 June 2001, but not to the females.”  (Defs.’ Ex. KKK, filed Jan.\n18 11, 2008, at W419.)  Finally, plaintiff Mansourian filed a fourth\n19 supplemental complaint on August 13, 2001, alleging the “firing\n20 [of Mike Burch] was in retaliation against him and us, because he\n21 fought to keep us on UCD’s intercollegiate wrestling team.” \n22\n23 4 Plaintiffs object to defendants’ Exhibit GGG as\nimproperly authenticated and hearsay.  (See Pls.’ Objections to\n24\nEvidence at 39:6-8 (Docket # 338), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  However,\nbecause plaintiffs also submitted this evidence, (Pls.’ Ex. A:80\n25 (Docket #330-2), filed Mar. 6, 2008), it is self-authenticating,\nOrr v. Bank of Am., 285 F.3d 764, 777 n.20 (9th Cir. 2002);\n26 Alexander Dawson, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 586 F.2d 1300, 1302 (9th Cir.\n1978).  Moreover, the court considers the evidence not for the\n27 truth of the matters asserted, but rather for the effect they had\non UCD (i.e. notice).  United States v. Payne, 944 F.2d 1458,\n28 1472 (9th Cir. 1991).  Plaintiffs’ objection is overruled.\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 4 of 22\n1 (Defs.’ Ex. LLL, filed Jan. 11, 2008, at W417.)\n2 Following an investigation by the OCR, UCD posed and the OCR\n3 accepted a voluntary resolution plan.  (DRAF ¶ 82.)  The plan\n4 required UCD to permit female athletes to try out for the\n5 wrestling team.  (DRAF ¶ 83.)  Plaintiffs Ng and Mancuso\n6 subsequently competed for a spot on the wrestling team, but\n7 neither plaintiff was given a spot on the team.  (DRAF ¶ 93.)  \n8 On December 18, 2003, plaintiffs filed the instant action on\n9 behalf of themselves and a putative class, asserting six claims\n10 for relief: (1) violation of Title IX based on unequal\n11 opportunities; (2) violation of Title IX based on unequal\n12 financial assistance; (3) retaliation in violation of Title IX;\n13 (4) violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (5) violation of the\n14 California Unruh Civil Rights Act; and (6) violation of public\n15 policy.  Defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal\n16 Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on March 5, 2004.  (Defs.’ Mot.\n17 to Dismiss (Docket #13-15), filed Mar. 5, 2004.)  The court\n18 denied the motion on May 6, 2004.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #25),\n19 filed May 6, 2004).\n20 Unfortunately, both defendants’ and plaintiffs’ counsel\n21 suffered illnesses throughout the course of the litigation.  As a\n22 result, both parties stipulated to extend deadlines and to stay\n23 proceedings.  In August 2006, plaintiffs obtained new counsel. \n24 (Notice of Appearance (Docket #134), filed Aug. 18, 2006.)  The\n25 parties submitted a joint status report on January 19, 2007, and\n26 active litigation resumed.  (Joint Status Report (Docket #154),\n27 filed Jan. 19, 2007.)\n28 /////\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 5 of 22\n1 On February 2, 2007, plaintiffs’ filed a motion to amend the\n2 complaint to add new plaintiffs and allegations.  (Pls.’ Mot. to\n3 Amend (Docket #158), filed Feb. 2, 2007.)  The court denied the\n4 motion on March 20, 2007.5  (Mem. & Order (Docket #175), filed\n5 Mar. 20, 2007.)  The parties thereafter stipulated to dismiss the\n6 class claims.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #195), filed June 12, 2007.)\n7 On June 5, 2007, defendants filed a motion for judgment on\n8 the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). \n9 (Defs.’ Mot. for J. on Pleadings (Docket #188), filed June 5,\n10 2007.)  The court granted the motion for all claims, except\n11 plaintiffs’ claim for ineffective accommodation.  (Mem. & Order\n12 (Docket #226), filed Oct. 18, 2007.)  Defendants’ filed the\n13 instant motion on January 11, 2008.  (Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J.\n14 (Docket #280), filed Jan. 11, 2008.)\n15 STANDARD\n16 The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for summary\n17 judgment where “the pleading, depositions, answers to\n18 interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\n19 affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n20 material fact.  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c); see California v.\n21 Campbell, 138 F.3d 772, 780 (9th Cir. 1998).  The evidence must\n22 be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \n23\n5 Specifically, the court denied plaintiffs’ request to\n24\namend the complaint to assert claims for denied opportunities in\nwomen’s rugby and field hockey.  The court found that “[w]hile\n25 the plaintiffs may has sought to bring challenges on behalf of\nall women athletes at UC Davis . . . [t]he factual allegations in\n26 the original complaint related only to the opportunities\navailable for women to participate in the UC Davis wrestling\n27 program and plaintiffs alleged inability to receive the benefits\nof being a varsity wrestler.”  (Mem. & Order at 11:13-20 (Docket\n28 #175), filed Mar. 20, 2007.)\n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 6 of 22\n1 See Lopez v. Smith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir. 2000) (en\n2 banc).\n3 The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating\n4 the absence of a genuine issue of fact.  See Celotex Corp. v.\n5 Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).  If the moving party fails to\n6 meet this burden, “the nonmoving party has no obligation to\n7 produce anything, even if the nonmoving party would have the\n8 ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.  Nissan Fire & Marine\n9 Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., 210 F.3d 1099, 1102-03 (9th Cir. 2000). \n10 However, if the nonmoving party has the burden of proof at trial,\n11 the moving party only needs to show “that there is an absence of\n12 evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.”  Celotex Corp.,\n13 477 U.S. at 325.\n14 Once the moving party has met its burden of proof, the\n15 nonmoving party must produce evidence on which a reasonable trier\n16 of fact could find in its favor viewing the record as a whole in\n17 light of the evidentiary burden the law places on that party. \n18 See Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D Co., 68 F.3d 1216, 1221 (9th\n19 Cir. 1995).  The nonmoving party cannot simply rest on its\n20 allegations without any significant probative evidence tending to\n21 support the complaint.  See Nissan Fire & Marine, 210 F.3d at\n22 1107.  Instead, through admissible evidence the nonmoving party\n23 “must set for specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n24 issue for trial.”  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(e).\n25 ANALYSIS\n26 Defendants assert that plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation\n27 claim must fail because plaintiffs have not alleged they gave\n28 defendant notice and an opportunity to remedy any purported\n6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 7 of 22\n1 systemic non-compliance with Title IX.  Defendants’ argument\n2 presents an issue of first impression in this jurisdiction.  The\n3 court concludes that money damages cannot be awarded unless a\n4 plaintiff has given notice of and an opportunity to rectify the\n5 specific violation alleged by a Title IX plaintiff.  The court\n6 also concludes that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a\n7 triable issue of fact regarding whether such notice and\n8 opportunity were given in this case.\n9 A. Notice and Opportunity to Cure in Title IX Cases\n10 Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in education programs,\n11 including athletic programs, at institutions receiving federal\n12 funding.  20 U.S.C. § 1861 (West 2008).  Although the statute is\n13 silent on the question of private remedies, the Supreme Court has\n14 held that Title IX provides individuals with a private cause of\n15 action.  Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 717 (1979). \n16 However, because a private cause of action is judicially implied,\n17 a court must “shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports\n18 with the statute.”  Id. \n19 The express system of enforcement in Title IX provides a\n20 robust administrative remedial scheme.  Bruneau v. S. Kortrigth\n21 Ctr. Sch. Dist., 163 F.3d 749, 756 (2d Cir. 1998).  Under the\n22 enforcement scheme, injured persons can file a complaint with the\n23 DOE, which is required to investigate the allegations.  34 C.F.R.\n24 § 100.7(b)-(c); Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756.  The DOE is also\n25 permitted to conduct periodic compliance reviews without a\n26 complaint.  34 C.F.R. § 100.7(a).  If the DOE concludes based on\n27 its investigation of a complaint or a periodic review that an\n28 institution has violated Title IX, it may terminate federal\n7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 8 of 22\n1 funding to the institution or institute other proceedings\n2 authorized by law.  20 U.S.C. § 1682.  Significantly, the DOE may\n3 not initiate any enforcement proceedings until it “has advised\n4 the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with\n5 the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be\n6 secured by voluntary means.”  Id.  Similarly, the administrative\n7 regulations require resolution of compliance issues “by informal\n8 means wherever possible,” id. § 100.7(d)(1), and prohibit\n9 enforcement proceedings absent a showing the aid recipient “has\n10 been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be\n11 taken to effect compliance,” id. § 100.8(d).6  Thus, both the\n12 statute and its implementing regulations condition enforcement\n13 proceedings on notice and an opportunity to cure non-compliance.\n14 “A central purpose of requiring notice of the violation . .\n15 . and an opportunity for voluntary compliance before\n16 administrative enforcement proceedings can commence is to avoid\n17 diverting education funding from beneficial uses where a\n18 recipient was unaware of discrimination in its programs and is\n19 willing to institute prompt corrective measures.”  Gebser v. Lago\n20 Vista Ind. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 289 (1998).  When an\n21 institution’s athletic program is out of compliance with Title\n22 IX, knowledge of the violation cannot be imputed to the\n23 institution simply because it oversees the program.  Grandson v.\n24 Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568, 575 (8th Cir. 2001).  Even if\n25 knowledge of failure to provide full and effective accommodation\n26\n6 The court notes that the cited regulations pertain to\n27 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  However, the\nimplementing regulations of Title IX expressly incorporate by\n28 reference these provisions.  See 34 C.F.R. § 106.71.\n8\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 9 of 22\n1 of interest could be imputed, an institution may otherwise be in\n2 compliance with Title IX because (1) there is substantial\n3 statistical proportionality between athletic participation and\n4 enrollment rates of an underrepresented sex; or (2) the\n5 institution has a continuing practice of program expansion to\n6 accommodate an underrepresented sex.  Neal v. Bd. of Trustees of\n7 Cal. St. Univs., 198 F.3d 763, 767-68 (9th Cir. 1999) (listing\n8 three ways in which an institution may comply with Title IX: (1)\n9 full and effective accommodation interest; (2) substantial\n10 statistical proportionality between participation and enrollment;\n11 or (3) continuing practice of program expansion).  Thus, failure\n12 to provide notice prior to filing suit may result in the type of\n13 harm the notice requirement is intended to prevent, that is, a\n14 court order diverting education funds where an institution is\n15 unaware of the violation and willing to take corrective measures. \n16 Moreover, “[i]t would be unsound . . . for a statute’s\n17 express system of enforcement to require notice to the recipient\n18 and an opportunity to come into voluntary compliance while a\n19 judicially implied system of enforcement permits substantial\n20 liability without regard to the recipient’s knowledge or its\n21 corrective actions upon receiving notice.”  Gebser, 524 U.S. at\n22 289-90 (emphasis in original).  This is particularly true given\n23 that Congress has conditioned the statute’s most severe sanction\n24 -- termination of federal funding -- upon notice and an\n25 opportunity for voluntary compliance.  20 U.S.C. § 1682; 34\n26 C.F.R. §§ 100.7(d)(1), 100.8(d).  The court does not find that\n27 Congress intended to create an implied enforcement scheme that\n28 may impose greater liability, in the form of monetary damages\n9\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 10 of 22\n1 potentially exceeding the level of federal funding, absent\n2 comparable conditions.  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290.  “Because the\n3 express remedial scheme under Title IX is predicated upon notice\n4 to an ‘appropriate person’ and an opportunity to rectify any\n5 violation . . . [the court] conclude[s], in absence of further\n6 direction from Congress, that the implied damages remedy should\n7 be fashioned along the same lines.”  Id.   \n8 In similar circumstances, the Eighth Circuit has also held\n9 that notice and an opportunity to cure alleged violations of\n10 Title IX are required to sustain a private damages action. \n11 Grandson, 272 F.3d at 575-76.  In Grandson, female student\n12 athletes filed actions for monetary relief claiming a funding\n13 disparity between the men’s and women’s soccer teams and\n14 ineffective accommodation.  Id.  Relying on Gebser, the Eighth\n15 Circuit upheld the district court’s grant of summary judgment to\n16 the University of Minnesota because “[t]here was no allegation of\n17 prior notice of [plaintiffs’] complaints to appropriate UMD\n18 officials, no allegation of deliberate indifference by such\n19 officials, and no allegation [plaintiffs] afforded UMD a\n20 reasonable opportunity to rectify the alleged violations.”  Id. \n21 Because defendants in this case also seek summary judgment on the\n22 basis plaintiffs failed to provide notice and an opportunity to\n23 cure an ineffective accommodation claim, Grandson  provides\n24 persuasive support for the court’s conclusion that notice and an\n25 opportunity to cure are required to sustain a private damages\n26 action.\n27 In asserting that notice is not required because plaintiffs\n28 are asserting a claim for ineffective accommodation, plaintiffs\n10\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 11 of 22\n1 argue the court’s reliance on Gebser is misplaced.  Specifically,\n2 plaintiffs contend the Supreme Court’s holding in Gebser is\n3 limited to cases of sexual harassment because, in such cases, the\n4 institution may not be aware of the alleged violation. \n5 Plaintiffs contend an institution necessarily has knowledge of an\n6 ineffective accommodation violation because it oversees the\n7 athletic program.  Thus, plaintiffs assert they may seek damages\n8 without giving notice to the institution and an opportunity to\n9 cure.  However, the Gebser Court’s reasoning applies equally to\n10 both sexual harassment and ineffective accommodation claims.  The\n11 Supreme Court in Gebser was concerned about creating a judicially\n12 implied remedial system that was broader than the express\n13 enforcement scheme created by Congress, particularly where\n14 damages may exceed a recipient’s level of federal funding.  524\n15 U.S. at 289-90.  The Court therefore required that the remedial\n16 scheme for private plaintiffs mirror the remedial scheme mandated\n17 for federal enforcement agencies.  Id.  If the court adopted\n18 plaintiffs’ position, it would create an implied enforcement\n19 scheme with the potential to impose greater liability on an\n20 institution without conditions comparable to the express remedial\n21 scheme provided by Congress.  See id.  The Supreme Court’s\n22 analysis in Gebser is therefore equally applicable to this case.\n23 Moreover, there is nothing in the statute or its\n24 implementing regulations to support the argument that Congress\n25 intended a different remedial scheme to apply based on the nature\n26 of the Title IX claim.  Section 902 broadly advises that no\n27 remedial actions shall be taken by a federal enforcement agency\n28 until it “has advised the appropriate person or persons of the\n11\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 12 of 22\n1 failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that\n2 compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.”  20 U.S.C. §\n3 1682.  Similarly, the regulations instruct agencies to resolve\n4 matters “by informal means wherever possible” and abstain from\n5 taking action until “the responsible Department official has\n6 determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means\n7 [and] the recipient or other person has been notified of its\n8 failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect\n9 compliance.”  34 C.F.R. §§ 100.7(d)(1), 100.8(d).  Notably absent\n10 from these provisions is language limiting their application to\n11 sexual harassment claims.  The court will not infer an intent on\n12 the part of Congress to create an implied scheme differentiating\n13 between sexual harassment and ineffective accommodation claims\n14 where the express scheme contains no such distinction.\n15 Plaintiffs argue that under Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of\n16 Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 642 (1999), and Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of\n17 Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 174 (2005), notice is not required where an\n18 institution intentionally violates Title IX.  However, Davis and\n19 Jackson implicitly support the conclusion that notice and an\n20 opportunity to cure specific violations are prerequisites for\n21 private damages claims under Title IX.  In Davis, the Supreme\n22 Court held that an institution can be liable for student-to-\n23 student sexual harassment where it exhibited “deliberate\n24 indifference to known acts of harassment.”  526 U.S. at 643\n25 (emphasis added).  In that case, the complaint alleged that the\n26 defendants had knowledge of the alleged violation because\n27 plaintiff or her mother reported each of the incidents to the\n28 classroom teacher, another classroom teacher, and the school\n12\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 13 of 22\n1 principle over several months.  Id. at 634-35.  Further, the\n2 institution had an opportunity to cure the violation over several\n3 months after such notice was given, but it deliberately failed to\n4 take action.  Id. at 635, 644.  Rather, it was only after more\n5 than three months of reported harassment, that plaintiff was\n6 allowed to change her classroom seat so that she no longer sat\n7 next to petitioner.  As such, the Supreme Court’s holding in\n8 Davis supports the holding that notice and an opportunity to cure\n9 is required.  \n10 Similarly, in Jackson, the Court held an institution is\n11 liable for retaliation against a coach that complains of sex\n12 discrimination.  544 U.S. at 183.  In that case, the complaint\n13 alleged that the defendant had knowledge of the alleged violation\n14 because the plaintiff basketball coach complained to his\n15 supervisors about the unequal treatment of the girls’ basketball\n16 team at the institution.  Id. at 171.  The plaintiff’s complaints\n17 went unanswered.  Id. at 171.  Subsequently, instead of\n18 addressing the complaints or curing the alleged violations, the\n19 defendant allegedly retaliated against the plaintiff by giving\n20 him negative work evaluation and , ultimately, removing him from\n21 his position as the girls’ basketball coach.  Id. at 172.  Thus,\n22 in Jackson, the defendant had an opportunity to cure the alleged\n23 violations, but chose to take retaliatory action instead. \n24 Therefore, like Davis, the Court’s holding in Jackson supports,\n25 rather than refutes, the court’s holding that notice and an\n26 opportunity to cure are required in Title IX cases.     \n27 Finally, plaintiffs contend that any reliance on Grandson is\n28 misplaced because “it stands alone in applying Gebser to a claim\n13\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 14 of 22\n1 of intentional discrimination.”  (Pls.’ Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. for\n2 Summ. J. (Docket #342), filed Mar. 6, 2008, at 37).  However,\n3 plaintiffs fail to recognize that there are less than two dozen\n4 reported Title IX cases, and Grandson is the only reported case\n5 to address the specific issue of notice and opportunity to cure\n6 presented by this case.  While Grandson is not controlling on\n7 this court, it is persuasive authority for addressing whether\n8 notice and an opportunity to rectify specific violations of Title\n9 IX are required to sustain a private damages action.\n10 B. Notice and Opportunity to Cure in this Case\n11 Having concluded notice and an opportunity to cure specific\n12 violations alleged by Title IX plaintiffs are required to sustain\n13 a private damages action, the court considers whether plaintiffs\n14 have raised a triable issue of fact as to notice and opportunity\n15 to cure in this case.  Alleged violations of Title IX are\n16 generally divided into two categories of claims: unequal\n17 treatment claims and ineffective accommodation claims.  Unequal\n18 treatment claims focus on, inter alia, inequalities of\n19 scholarships, coaches’ salaries, facilities, training, and travel\n20 between male and female athletic programs.  See 34 C.F.R. §\n21 106.37(c), 106.41(c)(2)-(10); Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213\n22 F.3d 858, 865 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000).  Ineffective accommodation\n23 claims determine whether equal athletic opportunities for members\n24 of both sexes are available and effectively accommodate the\n25 interest and abilities of members of both sexes.  See 34 C.F.R. §\n26 106.41(c)(1); Pederson, 213 F.3d at 865 n.4.  \n27 The undisputed evidence establishes that plaintiffs did not\n28 provide defendants with notice and an opportunity to cure a\n14\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 15 of 22\n1 violation of Title IX for ineffective accommodation.  Plaintiffs’\n2 complaints filed with the OCR provide no indication of a claim\n3 for a failure to provide sufficient athletic opportunities for\n4 women.  Plaintiff Ng’s complaints allege unequal treatment in\n5 recruiting, scholarships, competitive schedules, facilities, and\n6 services at UCD.  (Defs.’ Ex. HHH ¶¶ 1-4;Defs.’ Ex. KKK at W419.) \n7 Similarly, plaintiff Mansourian’s complaint alleges “ongoing\n8 sexual discrimination” and asks for “equal rights, as women, so\n9 that we can again wrestle on UCD’s intercollegiate wrestling\n10 team.”  (Defs.’ Ex. LLL at W417.)  Thus, the complaints do not\n11 indicate that plaintiffs were challenging UCD’s entire athletic\n12 program.7  Rather, the complaints allege specific acts of unequal\n13 treatment with respect to women’s wrestling.8  Plaintiffs\n14\n7 Plaintiffs argue that UCD was given adequate notice of\n15\nan ineffective accommodation claim with respect to the wrestling\nteam and, thereby, was given notice of a challenge to the\n16\nathletic program.  Assuming arguendo a challenge to a single team\nwould notify an institution of a challenge to its entire athletic\n17\nprogram, plaintiffs’ proffered evidence does not support their\nassertion.  Plaintiffs’ complaints to defendants and the OCR do\n18\nnot set forth an ineffective accommodation claim with respect to\neither wrestling or UCD’s entire athletic program.  Rather,\n19\nplaintiffs’ complaints allege unequal treatment of female\nwrestlers. \n20\n8 In its Memorandum and Order addressing defendants’\n21\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, the court construed that\nplaintiffs’ allegation that UCD violated Title IX by “choosing to\n22\nmake fewer athletic opportunities to female students than to male\nstudents” as sufficient to state a claim for ineffective\n23\naccommodation.  (Mem. & Order at 23:2-7 (Docket #226), filed Oct.\n18, 2007 (citing Pls.’ Compl. ¶ 129 (Docket #1), filed Dec. 18,\n24\n2007.))  However, it was not clear until oral argument on\ndefendants’ motion that plaintiffs were pressing such a claim. \n25 As such, in keeping with the spirit of liberal notice pleading,\nthe court allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on\n26 this issue due to the failure to incorporate such arguments with\nany type of specificity or particularity in the moving papers. \n27 In this supplemental briefing, defendants argued they were not\naware plaintiffs were pressing this theory of liability.  (See\n28 Defs.’ Reply to Pls.’ Supplement Br. at 1:12-18 (Docket #212),\n15\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 16 of 22\n1 complaints therefore fail to raise a triable issue of fact as to\n2 whether defendants received notice and an opportunity to cure an\n3 ineffective accommodation claim.\n4 Plaintiffs argue they are not required to file a complaint\n5 with the OCR to satisfy notice and opportunity to cure.  The\n6 court agrees.  Indeed, plaintiffs could have satisfied these\n7 requirements in any number of ways.  However, the only evidence\n8 of potential notice, beyond the complaints filed with the OCR, is\n9 a meeting that occurred in January 2001 between defendant\n10 Warzecka and plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng.  (DRAF ¶ 70.)  The\n11 deposition testimony of Mansourian and Ng indicates the parties\n12 discussed why women were removed from the wrestling team. \n13 Specifically, Mansourian and Ng assert the parties discussed that\n14 women wrestlers were “way too much liability for the UC,” that\n15 female wrestlers could not waive liability, that the NCAA does\n16 not support mixed wrestling teams, and that women interested in\n17 wrestling needed to “do the club sports.”  (See Pls.’ Ex. B:33 at\n18 189-199 (Docket #334), filed Mar. 6, 2008; Pls.’ Ex. B:38 at 173-\n19 76 (Docket #335), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  Thus, the evidence fails\n20 to establish plaintiffs notified defendants of a complaint for\n21 ineffective accommodation during the meeting with Warzecka. \n22 Accordingly, plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue of fact\n23 as to whether they otherwise provided UCD notice and an\n24 opportunity to cure.\n25 Plaintiffs also assert that requiring notice of specific\n26 violations of Title IX imposes an unprecedented burden on\n27\n28 filed Aug. 17, 2007.)\n16\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 17 of 22\n1 plaintiffs to allege violations with a high degree of specificity\n2 in OCR complaints.  Plaintiffs contend that requiring potential\n3 litigants to distinguish between an unequal treatment claim and\n4 an ineffective accommodation claim is a burden not contemplated\n5 by the statute or even required by the pleading standard set\n6 forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Contrary to\n7 plaintiffs’ assertion, the court’s holding does not require Title\n8 IX plaintiffs to plead their allegations with precision or\n9 specificity.  However, the allegations must provide some\n10 indication of the basis for the institution’s non-compliance so\n11 that an institution may attempt to remedy the situation\n12 voluntarily.  The evidence simply fails to establish that\n13 plaintiffs gave defendants notice of a Title IX claim for failing\n14 to provide enough athletic opportunities to female athletes.  \n15 In the alternative, plaintiffs contend that even if they did\n16 not provide notice of an ineffective accommodation claim,\n17 defendants should have been on notice that plaintiffs were making\n18 such a claim because the OCR actively investigated program-wide\n19 non-compliance with Title IX as a result of plaintiffs’\n20 complaints.9  However, the evidence proffered by plaintiffs fails\n21 to support this assertion.  Moreover, even if the OCR conducted\n22\n9 Plaintiffs implicitly argue that if defendants knew of\n23\nthe alleged ineffective accommodation violation, the absence of\nany complaints directed at this specific type of violation by\n24\nplaintiffs is immaterial.  The court notes that this argument\nneglects the requirement that defendants be given an opportunity\n25 to cure the violations alleged by an aggrieved party.  However,\nbecause, as set forth infra, plaintiffs have not presented\n26 evidence that the OCR actively investigated a complaint of\nprogram-wide violations, that defendants were aware the OCR was\n27 conducting such an investigation, or that defendants were\ninformed by the OCR that there were any such violations, the\n28 court need not reach the merits of this argument.  \n17\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 18 of 22\n1 an investigation into alleged program-wide violations, plaintiffs\n2 fail to present evidence that defendants were on notice of any\n3 program-wide violation as a result. \n4 First, plaintiffs cite to the deposition testimony of\n5 Swanson, which they allege demonstrates that “the majority of the\n6 [OCR investigation] was spent on the issue of women’s\n7 opportunities.”  (Pls.’ Ex. B:55 at 104:19-20 (Docket #336),\n8 filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  The deposition testimony does not support\n9 this assertion.  Swanson’s testimony establishes that the OCR\n10 investigated the issue of women’s athletic opportunities in\n11 wrestling:\n12 I think that the meeting was much more directed to the\nopportunity for women on the team, what had taken place\n13 in the past, what we were willing to do from this point\nforward.  Concerns that had we really discriminated \n14 against these women, had we taken away the opportunity\nto be involved as they had been in the past.\n15\n  \n16 (Pls.’ Ex. B:55 at 104:1-8.)  Swanson’s testimony does not\n17 establish that the OCR investigated the athletic program’s\n18 compliance with Title IX.  Therefore, plaintiffs have not raised\n19 a triable issue of fact as to notice and opportunity to cure\n20 based on this testimony.\n21 Second, plaintiffs cite a letter from a UCD official in\n22 support of their contention that the OCR investigated program-\n23 wide compliance with Title IX.  The letter opens, “[UCD]\n24 welcome[s] the opportunity to have the [OCR] review [UCD’s]\n25 athletic gender equity compliance with Title IX.”  (Pls.’ Ex.\n26 A:35 (Docket #335), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  This statement is\n27 merely an introductory paragraph containing a basic salutation to\n28 the OCR, not a concession that UCD was aware of a claim for\n18\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 19 of 22\n1 ineffective accommodation.  In fact, the very next paragraph of\n2 the letter begins, “I would like to take this opportunity to\n3 respond to the sexual discrimination complaint filed by three UC\n4 Davis female students who participate with our NCAA Division I\n5 men’s wrestling team.”  (Pls. Ex. A:35 ¶ 2.)  Thus, the letter\n6 indicates the OCR investigated discrete acts of discrimination\n7 with respect to women’s wrestling.  Plaintiffs therefore have not\n8 raised a genuine issue of material fact on the basis of this\n9 letter.\n10 Third, plaintiffs argue the deposition testimony of Warzecka\n11 establishes that the OCR investigated the amount of athletic\n12 opportunities UCD provided all female athletes.  In his\n13 deposition, Warzecka was asked whether the OCR investigated all\n14 Title IX issues at UCD or merely the issues surrounding women’s\n15 wrestling.  (Pls.’ Ex. B:65 at 368:24-369:1 (Docket #337), filed\n16 Mar. 6, 2008.)  Warzecka responded:\n17 [The OCR] responded to a complaint that the four women\nmade.  And did their--did they take latitude to look at\n18 other things outside of that complaint?  Yes, they did.\n. . .  And I feel a lot of the questions they asked\n19 helped them provide background of how we do things at\nUC Davis and how we handle club sports.\n20\n21 (Pls.’ Ex. B:65 at 369:2-12.)  While Warzecka’s response\n22 indicates the OCR asked questions about matters outside the\n23 complaints, it does not establish the OCR investigated program-\n24 wide compliance with Title IX.  Rather, Warzecka indicates he\n25 understood such questions to provide necessary background\n26 information.  Because Warzecka’s testimony does not establish the\n27 OCR investigated program-wide compliance or that UCD understood\n28 the OCR was conducting such an investigation, plaintiffs have\n19\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 20 of 22\n1 failed to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to actual\n2 notice and opportunity to cure.\n3 Plaintiffs’ assertion that the OCR investigated program-wide\n4 compliance also fails because the voluntary resolution plan\n5 adopted by the OCR following its investigation made no findings\n6 with respect to program-wide violations.  Instead, the plan dealt\n7 exclusively with women’s wrestling.  Specifically, the plan\n8 required UCD, inter alia, to encourage all men and women “to\n9 compete for a position on the wrestling team,” to “recruit the\n10 best qualified wrestlers, irrespective of gender,” to allow\n11 members of the club wrestling team to practice concurrently with\n12 members of the varsity wrestling team, to provide the club\n13 wrestling team medical insurance service and use of facilities\n14 equal to other university club sports, and to encourage members\n15 of the club wrestling team to participate in the open wrestling\n16 tournament sponsored by UCD.  (Pls.’ Ex. A:34 at 2 (Docket #327-\n17 5), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)10  The OCR found that by taking these\n18 steps, a “rapid resolution of the issues” could be reached. \n19 (Pls.’ Ex. A:34 at 1.)  The plan’s limited subject matter and\n20 finding that issues could be resolved through action directed\n21 solely at the wrestling team indicates that no investigation was\n22 taken into UCD’s program-wide compliance.  At the very least, it\n23 indicates that UCD was not on notice of any program-wide\n24 violation as a result of the OCR’s investigation.  Thus, there is\n25\n26 10 Plaintiffs object to defendants’ request for judicial\nnotice of the cited evidence.  (See Pls.’ Opp’n to Judicial\n27 Notice (Docket #323), filed Mar. 6, 2008.)  The court overrules\nthis objection as plaintiffs also submitted the very evidence to\n28 which it objects.  \n20\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 21 of 22\n1 no evidence to support the assertion that the OCR investigated\n2 anything other than the unequal treatment of female wrestlers at\n3 UCD.  \n4 Finally, plaintiffs contend that UCD was on notice of an\n5 ineffective accommodation claim due to the public outcry in\n6 response to removal of females from the wrestling team.  However,\n7 “[a] vigorous public debate on these issues does not demonstrate\n8 that [the university] knew of systemic non-compliance.” \n9 Grandson, 272 F.3d at 575.  The evidence submitted by plaintiffs\n10 demonstrates that the public outcry in this case was in response\n11 to the allegedly gender biased and discriminatory removal of\n12 women from the wrestling team.  None of the evidence relating to\n13 the public’s response contains allegations or statements relating\n14 to program-wide compliance or the failure of UCD to sufficiently\n15 provide athletic opportunities to women.11  Accordingly, the\n16 cited evidence is not sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact\n17 as to notice and opportunity to cure.\n18 The court is mindful that Congress enacted Title IX to\n19 prevent the use of federal resources to support sex-based\n20 discrimination.  20 U.S.C. § 1681; Cannon, 441 U.S. at 704. \n21 There is no question that student athletes are discriminated\n22\n23 11 Defendants’ object to various letters, flyers,\nnewspaper articles, and other evidence of the public’s outcry\n24\nfollowing the removal of women from the wrestling team as\nhearsay.  (See Defs.’ Objections to Evidence ¶¶ 1-10 (Docket\n25 #344), filed Mar. 31, 2008.)  However, the court does not\nconsider the subject evidence for the truth of the matter\n26 asserted, but rather for the effect it had on UCD (i.e. notice). \nPayne, 944 F.2d at 1472.  Moreover, consideration of this\n27 evidence does not prejudice defendants as it is not sufficient to\nraise a triable issue of fact as to notice.  Defendants’\n28 objection is overruled.\n21\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 368    Filed 04/23/08   Page 22 of 22\n1 against and suffer harm when subject to unequal treatment or\n2 ineffective accommodation on the basis of their sex.  However,\n3 the limited issue presented by the facts of this case on this\n4 motion is whether an institution may be held liable for damages\n5 for a claim of ineffective accommodation, absent a showing of\n6 notice by plaintiffs and an opportunity for defendants to rectify\n7 the alleged non-compliance.  Given Title IX’s express enforcement\n8 scheme, the Supreme Court’s analysis in Gebser, and the Eighth\n9 Circuit’s opinion in Grandson, the court concludes a suit for\n10 private damages cannot be sustained until notice and opportunity\n11 to cure are given to an institution allegedly out of compliance\n12 with Title IX.  Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate a triable\n13 issue of fact regarding whether such notice and opportunity were\n14 given in this case.\n15 CONCLUSION\n16 For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion for summary\n17 judgment is GRANTED.  The Clerk is directed to close the file.\n18 IT IS SO ORDERED\n19 DATED: April 23, 2008. \n20\n21                                    \nFRANK C.

The case has been considerably narrowed via a series of motions.  Plaintiffs abandoned \n6  their attempt to have the case certified as a class action. Defendants' motion to dismiss disposed of all \n7  but one claim.  The sole claim for relief remaining is for alleged violation of Title IX under a theory of \n8  ineffective accommodation of athletic interests and abilities of female students at UC Davis. \n9  This case  is  an  attack  on  a women's  athletic  program that has  long been a  leader among \n10  institutions of higher education in providing and promoting equitable opportunities for female student \n11  athletes. The basis for the remaining claim asserted by MANSOURIAN, NG and MANCUSO arises \n12  out of their participation, or attempted participation, in the wrestling program at UC Davis. During the \n13  time Michael Burch was the head wrestling coach, the few women who came out for the wrestling team \n14  were  not  required  to  earn  a  spot  on  the  team  roster  via  a  hallmark  of varsity  athletics  -- the \n15  demonstration of sufficient skill and ability to compete at the varsity level. Plaintiffs did not complain \n16  about this differential treatment; to the contrary, they insisted and continue to insist to this day that they \n17  had an entitlement to membership on the team throughout their college career because they are female \n18  and should not have been required to earn a spot on the roster as male students must do. \n19  The focus of this motion is on the UNIVERSITY's compliance with what is known as  Title \n20  IX's three-pronged test.  The UNIVERSITY meets prong two of the test as it has a history and practice \n21  of continuous  expansion  of its  women's  athletic  program,  thus  defeating  Plaintiffs'  ineffective \n22  accommodation claim.  The claim also fails because they cannot show there was  sufficient interest, \n23  ability, or expectation for intercollegiate competition to support a separate women's wrestling team. \n24  Title IX law makes it very clear that in the absence of sufficient interest, ability, or expectation of \n25  competition for an intercollegiate team, a university need not establish a new  team simply because a \n26  few  students make  a request for  one.  Finally, Plaintiffs'  claim fails  on the issue of notice,  as the \n27  complaints  two  of them  filed  with  the  Office  for  Civil  Rights  (OCR)  focused  solely  on  their \n28  experiences with the wrestling team -- they did not contain the wholesale attack on the entire women's \n1 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 7 of 46\n1  athletic program that Plaintiffs now attempt to mount.  The narrow focus of the OCR complaints, as \n2  well as the scope of the allegations set forth in the complaint filed with this Court, was one of the \n3  reasons the Court denied Plaintiffs' attempt earlier this year to add new party plaintiffs who are current \n4  students  interested  in  varsity  sports  other  than  wrestling.  In  denying  the  motion  to  amend  the \n5  Complaint Judge Darnrell stated: \n6  \"While plaintiffs may have sought to bring challenges on behalf of all women athletes at \nUC Davis, the plaintiffs only alleged that they had experience and sought opportunities in \n7 \nwrestling.  The  factual  allegations  in  the  original  complaint  related  only  to  the \nopportunities  available for  women  to  participate  in  the  UC  Davis  varsity  wrestling \n8 \nprogram and plaintiffs' inability to  receive  the  benefits of being a varsity wrestler.\" \n9  (Order dated 3/20107, Docket item 175, emphasis added.) \n10 \nFor the reasons  set  forth  below,  the  UNIVERSITY requests that the  Court grant  summary \n11 \njudgment in its favor on the sole remaining claim. \n12 \nII \n13 \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY RELEVANT TO THIS MOTION \n14 \nThis  action  was  filed  on  December  18,  2003.  Plaintiffs  asserted  six  claims  for  relief:  (I) \n15 \nviolation of Title IX based on a theory that female athletes are not afforded the same opportunities as \n16 \nmale athletes; (2) violation of Title IX based on a theory that female athletes are not provided with the \n17 \nsame opportunities for financial assistance as male athletes; (3) retaliation in violation of Title IX and \n18  its interpretive regulations; (4) violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983 based on an equal protection clause;  (5) \n19  violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act; and (6) a claim of violation of \"public policy\" based \n20  on various California statutes including Article I, section 7 of the State Constitution, Article I, section \n21  31  of the State Constitution, and Education Code sections 221.7, 262.3, 66101, 67620 and 66252.  On \n22  October 18,  2007 the  Court issued its order on Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings \n23  (Docket item 226), granting the motion in all respects except for one aspect of the first claim for relief. \n24  Plaintiffs' first claim for relief under a theory of unequal treatment was dismissed, but the motion was \n25  denied in regard to the other theory asserted in the first claim for relief (ineffective accommodation of \ninterests).  As a result of this order, all remaining claims for relief have been dismissed as a matter of \n26 \nlaw, including the claims asserted against the individual Defendants. \n27 \nFaced with strong opposition to  their  motion for  class  certification and the  denial  of their \n28 \n2 \nMemorandum oCPoints and Authorities in Support oCDeCendant's Motion Cor Summary Judgment \n{0053774l.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 8 of 46\n1  motion to add new party plaintiffs, Plaintiffs moved to dismiss their class claims earlier this year.  In \n2  March, 2007 NANCY CHIANG voluntarily dismissed her claims.  (Docket item 178.) \n3  III. \n4  SCOPE OF THIS MOTION \n5  In its ruling on Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court identified the first \n6  claim  for  relief as  stating  both  a theory  of unequal  treatment  based  on  gender,  and  a theory  of \n7  ineffective accommodation of the Plaintiffs'  athletic interests.  On page 9 of its order (Docket item \n8  226), the Court noted that the unequal treatment claim was based on (1) issuance of what Plaintiffs call \n9  the \"No Females Directive\"! in the fall of2000; (2) an alleged broken promise in June 2001 to reinstate \n10  women to the wrestling team; (3) the failure to renew the contract of wrestling coach Mike Burch; and \n11  (4) requiring women to compete for membership on the wrestling team in the fall of 2001 under the \n12  same terms and conditions as male students.  The Court held that all of these events were time-barred \n13  and  granted the  motion insofar as  the theory of unequal treatment is  concerned.  In regard to  the \n14  surviving  theory  of ineffective  accommodation,  the  Court  based  its  ruling  on  allegations  in  the \n15  Complaint that Plaintiffs \"were able and ready to wrestle at UCD and that sufficient interest existed in \n16  the female  student population at UCD to field a women's wrestling team.\" Id.  at p.  24.  This ruling \n17  defines the scope of the remaining claim. \nIB  IV. \n19  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n20  A.  Varsity Intercollegiate Wrestling at DC Davis \n21  During the time period in issue in  this  case,  UC  Davis  was  a National  Collegiate Athletic \n22  Association (NCAA) Division II school.  However, its wrestling team competed at the Division I level \n23  because  of a  lack  of available  competition  among  Division  II  schools  in  its  geographic  area. \n(Undisputed Material Fact (UMF) 7)  UC Davis wrestles in the Pac-l 0 Conference. The other schools \n24 \n25  that are members of the Pac-! 0 Conference for the sport of wrestling are Arizona State, Boise State, Cal \n26 \n27 \nThis moniker was coined by the attorney representing the Plaintiffs at the time the suit was filed.  Plaintiffs \n28  admitted in interrogatory responses that they never saw or heard anything issued by the UNIVERSITY or its employees \nentitled \"No Females Directive.\" \n3 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774!.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 9 of 46\n1  Poly, Cal State Bakersfield, Cal State Fullerton, Oregon, Oregon State, Portland State and Stanford. \n2  (UMF 8)  UC Davis has not declared wrestling to be a contact sport.  Accordingly, students of both \n3  genders may tryout for the team.  (UMF 9) The head coach of the wrestling team is solely responsible \n4  for determining which students will be awarded a slot on the team roster based on his assessment of \n5  which  candidates  are  most  skilled  and  qualified to  participate  in collegiate  level  wrestling  at  the \n6  Division I level.  (UMF  10)  Any student who is selected for the wrestling team must meet NCAA \n7  eligibility  requirements,  comply  with  all  applicable  NCAA  regulations  relating  to  wrestling,  and \n8  comply with UC Davis athletic eligibility requirements.  (UMF 11) \n9  The  UC  Davis  wrestling team  competes  in  a  set  schedule  of competition  each year.  The \n10  competition  includes  dual  meets  with other schools  in the  Pac-10  conference and  participation in \n11  invitational  tournaments,  one  or  two  open  tournaments,  and  NCAA  championship  events  (if \n12  applicable).  Collegiate style wrestling rules are used in dual meets and NCAA sponsored tournaments. \n13  The wrestling team practices and competes in those events using collegiate style rules, not freestyle or \n14  folk-style rules. (UMFs 12, 14) \n15  B.  Women and Varsity Wrestling at UC Davis \n16  There has never been a separate women's wrestling team at UC Davis.  (UMF 15)  Women's \n17  wrestling has always had an \"unofficial status\" on campus. This is reflected in the media guides issued \n18  by the Department of Intercollegiate Athletics.  The 1996/97 wrestling media guide included a section \n19  on \"women's freestyle wrestling.\" Two graduate students, Afsoon Roshanzamir and Jennifer Martin, \n20  were described as members of the Davis Wrestling Club, a local city freestyle club.  The description \n2 \n21  of the wrestling team in the 1996/97 media guide is devoid of any mention of women wrestlers; the \n22  focus is solely on male wrestlers.  There were no women listed on the team roster in the guide.  (UMFs \n23  16-18)  The 1997/98 wrestling media guide described wrestling as \"the only NCAA Division I men's \n24  sport on the UC Davis campus.\" (Emphasis added.)  Page 11 of that year's guide states: \"For several \n25  years UC Davis has had women participate in its program. Women's amateur wrestling is a new but \n26  rapidly growing sport in the U.S., with championships at the national and international level. At UC \n27 \n28  In her deposition, Ms. Roshanzamir (now known as Afsoon Johoston) testified that the \"Davis Wrestling Club\" \nwas actually some members of the varsity wrestling team and \"some older guys who had already graduated\" who were \npracticing in the off-season. \n4 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 10 of 46\n1  Davis, women's wrestling has an unofficial status, but women are encouraged to participate to develop \n2  their skills.\" The roster listed in the media guide for that year did not contain any women. (UMF 19) \n3  Women are included on the roster in  the 1998/99 media guide. There was nothing that would \n4  signify the existence of a separate women's wrestling team, such as a separate roster for them.  Women \n5  continued to be described as having unofficial status.  The records for the 1997/98 season which are \n6  included in the 1998/99 guide do not contain any information about women.  (UMF 20)  The 1999/00 \n7  media guide continued to describe women's wrestling as having unofficial status.  No women were \n8  listed on the  roster in the  guide  and there  were  no  entries for  women in the  section setting forth \n9  individual results for the previous year.  (UMF  21)  No women were included on the roster in the \n10  2000/01 media guide, nor was there any reference to women in the summary of individual records.  In \n11  this guide, there was a reference to the \"women's wrestling club program,\" which goes on to reiterate \n12  the same language contained in previous guides about women's wrestling having unofficial status at \n13  UC Davis.  (UMF 22) \n14  There has never been a separate budget for a purported women's wrestling team. (UMF 23) \n15  There  has  never been a competition schedule  submitted by  a head wrestling coach  indicating the \n16  existence of a separate women's wrestling team. (UMF 24) \n17  Afsoon Johnston (nee Roshanzamir) was a member of the  first women's national wrestling \n18  team3  in high school.  She earned a place on the national team by competing against other women. \n19  (UMF 26)  Johnston entered UC Davis in the fall of 1990 and graduated in 1995. (UMF 27)  When she \n20  entered UC Davis, she advised the coach (Bob Grant) that her interest was in pursuing wrestling to \n21  compete on the national level. Throughout the time she attended UC Davis, her participation in dual \n22  meets4 was limited to an exhibition match with a female Chico State wrestler and an open meet with \n23  San Francisco State. (UMF 28) \n24  During Johnston's first and second year at UC Davis, she was the only woman who participated \n25  with the wrestling team.  In her senior year,  veterinary school student Jennifer Martin trained  with \n26 \n27  The women's national wrestling team is part of USA Wrestling.  It is not associated with UC Davis. \n28  A dual meet is a contest between two school teams.  An open meet or tournament is one where members of a \nschool team wrestle \"unattached\" to their school; anyone can compete in an open tournament. \n5 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 11 of 46\n1  Johnston.  (UMF 29)  After Burch became the head wrestling coach in 1995, Johnston continued to be \n2  ilie  only woman who  participated on the  team.  Johnston  never participated in  a match or a meet \n3  wearing a UC Davis uniform.  Burch did not provide her with coaching for any nationaJ or international \n4  tournaments.  Johnston considered herself to be a member of the UC Davis wrestling team only during \n5  her freshman year because after that she was a member of the USA Wrestling national team.  (UMF 30) \n6  The primary focus of her wrestling activities was to train so that she could compete with the national \n7  team, not with the UC Davis team.  She was not interested in being affiliated with the UC Davis team \n8  after her freshman year because doing so would adversely affect her standing on the national team. \n9  (UMF 31) \n10  Samanilia Reinis entered UC Davis in September, 1997.  She participated on the wrestling team \n11  in 1998/99, but did not wrestle at aJl in 1999/00 and 2000/01 because of a chronic injury.  (UMF 32) \n12  While she was at UC Davis, the only match or tournament iliat she competed in was ilie Aggie Opens. \n13  She attempted to wrestle in a tournament hosted by Southern Oregon, but could not do so because she \n14  did not have an opponent.  She never competed in a UC Davis uniform.  (UMF 33) \n15  Former plaintiff Nancy Chiang entered UC Davis as a freshman in the fall of 1998.  (UMF 35) \n16  Chiang was not cleared to practice with the team until well into the season because she did not obtain \n17  her required medical clearance until January  1999.  (UMF  36)  Chiang was not given a UC  Davis \n18  uniform, nor did she ever observe a woman wrestler in one.  (UMF 37)  The only match or tournament \n19  she participated in during her freshman year was the Aggie Open in January 1999.  Chiang wrestled \n20  against a woman from a wrestling club and was defeated.  (UMF 38)  The only match or tournament \n21  that Chiang participated in during her second year was the 2000 Aggie Open. She wrestled against two \n22  women,  using  freestyle  rules  and  was  defeated both times.  (UMF  39)  During  that  school  year \n23  (1999/00), Chiang struggled with heaJth problems that eventually deteriorated to the point where she \n24  barely attended classes. She emolled in classes for the spring quarter, but only went to one class and \n25 \n26 \nFor a number of years the wrestling team held an annual open tournament called the Aggie Open.  This event was \n27  primarily a fundraiser but also provided opportunities for wrestlers from  other schools or clubs to compete in an open \ntournament (as opposed to a scheduled meet).  In recent years, UC Davis has discontinued the  Aggie  Open wrestling \n28  tournament because it conflicted with Big West conference basketball games.

Chiang attempted to return to UC Davis in the fall  of 2000 but left again in mid \n2  October.  She did not return again and was deemed academically ineligible for intercollegiate sports as \n3  of January, 2001. (UMF 40)  Chiang never participated in world wrestling championships, the Pan \n4  American Games, nor has she ever tried out for the U. S. Olympic Wrestling team. (UMF 41) \n5  A  student  named  Abby  Schwartzburg  is  identified  in  the  wrestling  team  media  guide  for \n6  1999/2000.  Schwartzburg  appeared  to  be  participating  with  the  team,  but  had  not  completed the \n7  necessary paperwork to do so.  This came to the attention of Compliance Officer Jennifer Cardone in \n8  the spring of 2000, who in turn alerted Associate Athletic Director Pam Gill-Fisher of the issue. Gill \n9  Fisher met with Schwartzburg and Reinis (who was also missing required paperwork) to have them \n10  complete the documentation.  (UMF 42)  Schwartzburg had entered UC Davis as a transfer student in \n11  the fall of 1999.  She was no longer registered as a student at UC Davis as of February, 2001.  (UMF \n12  43)  A student named Stacey Massola trained with the UC Davis wrestling team in 1996/97 but then \n13  quit.  A student named Alexis Bell participated in the wrestling program for a very short period of time \n14  (two months) in 2000101.  (UMF 44) \n15  During the years Burch was the head coach of the wrestling team, there were never more than \n16  four women at anyone time participating in the wrestling program.  (UMF 45)  Other than the pre \n17  season practices and the try-outs (wrestle-off) that MANCUSO and NG attended in the fall of2001 (see \n18  below), no women have tried out for the wrestling team since that time.  (UMF 46)  Neither Burch nor \n19  his successor, Lennie Zalesky, are aware of any NCAA Division I school that has a separate women's \n20  wrestling team.  (UMF 47) \n21  C.  While  Plaintiffs  MANSOURIAN  and  NG  Did  Participate  With  the  Wrestling  Team \nDuring the Years Burch was the Head Coach, They Were Not Required to Demonstrate \n22 \nthe Skills Necessary to Wrestle at the Varsity Level, Nor Did They Compete at the Same \n23  Level as Other Members of the Team. \n24  Burch was hired as  the  head wrestling coach for UC  Davis in  1995.  He continued in  that \n25  position until June 2001, at which time his contract expired and was not renewed.  Lennie Zalesky was \n26  then hired as the head coach for the UC Davis wrestling team and remains in that position today. \n27  A fundamental aspect of coaching is holding try-outs for walk-on (non-recruited) students who \n28  hope to gain a spot on a varsity team roster.  (UMF 49, 109) At the collegiate varsity level, there is a \n7 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 13 of 46\n1  presumption that those student-athletes who earn a spot on the team have a skill level commensurate \n2  with varsity competition.  Conducting wrestle-offs (one-on-one competitions between wrestlers in a \n3  weight class) is the process by which a coach determines which students in each weight class have the \n4  skills and abilities necessary to compete with the other schools in the conference.  (UMF 49) Coach \n5  Zalesky, who has competed on the national and international level, and has coached high school and \n6  collegiate wrestling, has always conducted try-outs to determine which students will be placed on the \n7  team.  During the pre-competition practice period, students who hope to obtain a spot on the tearn must \n8  come to practice, engage in conditioning and weight training, and participate in drills.  Shortly before \n9  the competition season begins, he conducts wrestle-offs so he and the assistant coaches can determine \n10  which student-athletes are the most skilled in each weight class. (UMF 51)  Under Burch's leadership \n11  of the wrestling tearn, women were not required to engage in a wrestle-off or any type of competition to \n12  earn a spot on the tearn.  Burch knew they did not have the skill necessary to  compete even at the \n13  lowest weight class. (UMF 48) In his opinion, none of the women had the strength or skills to compete \n14  with males;  specifically, he stated that they \"didn't have a prayer in beating the men on this tearn.\" \n15  (UMF 50)  Burch did not provide the women with UC Davis wrestling uniforms. (UMF 53) \n16  When asked in a deposition why the  media guides did not contain any  information about \n17  accomplishments of women wrestlers, Burch stated that the women were not large enough to compete \n18  in even the lowest weight class of 125 pounds. (UMF 52) The 1999/00 wrestling media guide contains \n19  an extensive discussion about the hopes for the team that year. Coach Burch is quoted as saying this \n20  was the best tearn he had had.  The guide goes on to describe the contenders in each weight class -- the \n21  description is devoid of any mention of women, even in the lightest weight class.  (UMF 54)  Similarly, \n22  the 2000/01  media guide contains an \"Outlook\" section that touts the hopefuls for that year. Again, \n23  there is no mention of women.  Coach Burch is quoted as saying \"The guys are hungry.  They believed \n24  that for the past five years we've been building. We are still building but now it is time to see some of \n25  the fruits of that labor.  We want to see more dual meet wins, more Pac-IO place-winners and more \n26  national qualifiers this year.\"  (UMF 55) \n27  The primary types of competition engaged in by the UC Davis wrestling tearn are dual meets \n28  (against  tearns  in  the  Pac-l 0),  invitational  tournaments  and  post-season  championships.  Open \n8 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 14 of 46\n1  tournaments are attended at most only once or twice per year.  Any person can compete in an open \n2  tournament, whether associated with a team or not.  During the time Burch was the head wrestling \n3  coach,  the  only  type  of competition the  women wrestlers  participated  in  was  open  tournaments, \n4  primarily the Aggie Open. The only exception was Reinis' attempt to wrestle in one dual meet, which \n5  was thwarted because she had no competition. (UMFs 12,13,33,38,63,69) \n6  Prior to the 1998/99 school year, UC Davis could not offer athletic scholarships to its students \n7  per the rules of the conference it belonged to at the time.  Thereafter, the campus moved to a different \n8  conference  and  grants-in-aid consistent  with NCAA  guidelines  were  available  to  student-athletes. \n9  (UMF  57) Burch submitted grant-in-aid (athletic scholarship) worksheets for  1998/99,  1999100 and \n10  2000101.  He never offered any scholarships to women via this process. (UMF 58)  On May 29, 2001 \n11  Burch learned that his contract was not going to be renewed.  Two weeks later (just shortly before he \n12  departed UC Davis) he sent an e-mail to Compliance Coordinator Jennifer Cardone and attempted, for \n13  the first time, to award scholarship money to MANSOURIAN, NG and MANCUSO.  In light of the \n14  belated submission of tlris request, the status of the wrestling team budget, and the fact that the request \n15  was made only after Burch learned his contract would not be renewed, Athletic Director Warzecka \n16  made the decision to hold the request in abeyance, pending hiring of a new coach. (UMF 59) \n17  All student-athletes who participate in any manner in varsity athletics must complete certain \n18  required paperwork such the NCAA Student-Athlete Statement and Drug-Testing Consent Form, and \n19  the UC Davis required Academic Plan Form. Failure to submit the required paperwork means that a \n20  student is not eligible to  practice or compete in intercollegiate athletics.  Burch did not believe the \n21  women needed to complete the mandated paperwork (such as an Academic Plan Form) because the \n22  NCAA does not recognize women's wrestling.  (UMF 60) \n23  MANSOURIAN entered UC Davis in the fall of 2000 and graduated in June 2004. (UMF 61) \n24  During  her  first  year  at  UC  Davis  (2000/2001),  she  observed  only  one  other  female  actively \n25  participating in wrestling -- CHRISTINE NG.  (UMF 62)  MANSOURIAN did not compete at any dual \n26  meets during the 2000/2001  season.  The only tournament she competed in was the Aggie Open in \n27  January 2001.  MANSOURIAN wrestled against two women in the tournament and lost to both.  (UMF \n28  63)  She has never wrestled in a national wrestling tournament, has never participated in the Pan \n9 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774IDOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 15 of 46\n1  American  games,  never  tried  out  for  the  U.S.  Olympic  team,  and  never  held  any  national  or \n2  international rankings as a wrestler.  (UMF 64) 6 \n3  MANSOURIAN did not try out for a place on the wrestling team in the fall  of 2001.  On \n4  October 10,2001 she sent an e-mail to Coach Zalesky in which she stated that she had a new job and a \n5  heavy class load.  MANSOURIAN wrote \"I have found it extremely exhausting to wrestle as well.  I \n6  am thinking that maybe intercollegiate wrestling is too much for me right now and that I would rather \n7  be  in  a  club  (like  you  suggested  earlier)  blc  I  only  have  time  for  practice  about  3  times  a \n8  week ... however, I do not by any means want to stop wrestling. I can just not commit to it as much.\" \n9  (UMF 65) \n10  NG entered UC Davis in the fall of 1998 and graduated in September 2002.  (UMF 67)  During \n11  the three years she participated in wrestling, NG competed in only one match or tournament -- the \n12  National Girls Wrestling tournament in Michigan held in the spring of 2000.  Burch did not accompany \n13  her to the tournament, she did not wear a UC Davis uniform while she competed, and she did not place. \n14  NG signed up for the Aggie Open wrestling tournament in her freshman and sophomore years at UC \n15  Davis, but no one in her weight class showed up to compete and thus she did not participate.  (UMF 69) \n16  During the 1998/99 season, NG was ineligible to practice or compete from the start of the season in \n17  November until February 1999 because she failed to turn in an Academic Plan Form. (UMF 68) \n18  NG had  no  desire  to  practice  or wrestle  against  men;  she  was  more  interested  in  simply \n19  working out than she was in competing.  She testified during her deposition that \"I guess the thing is for \n20  me, like I have a fear of competing. And so I tend to avoid it when I can.  So that's why I'm not exactly \n21  up for competing.\"  (UMF 70)  NG has never been a member of the U.S. National Wrestling Team, has \n22  never participated in the Pan American Games,  and has never participated in the  World  Wrestling \n23 \n24 \n25 \nIn paragraphs 85 and 86 of their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that before the purported end of women participating \n26  in wrestling at UC Davis \"female wrestlers had the opportunity to participate in wrestling ... and to improve their skills to \nsuch an extent that some became nationally ranked, participated in national women's wrestling tournaments, participated at \n27  members of the U.S. National women's wrestling team, fmished high in the Pan-American games and World Wrestling \nChampionships and are expected to be members of the United States Olympic team in 2004 when women's wrestling \n28  becomes a gold medal sport for the fIrst time.  Without the benefIts obtained from their participation as female wrestlers at \nUC Davis, these nationally and internationally ranked female wrestlers would not likely have achieved such a high level of \nsuccess on their own.\" (Exhibit A, 'If'lf 85-86.) None of the Plaintiffs have ever reached such levels in wrestling. \n10 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 16 of 46\n1  Championships.  She has never tried out for the U. S. Olympic team nor does she have any plans to do \n2  so.  (UMF 71) \n3  As of the spring of her junior year (2001), NG was aware of only herself and MANSOURIAN \n4  as  female  UC  Davis  students interested in wrestling.  Samantha Reinis  was  graduating  and  Abbey \n5  Schwartzburg had left school, as had Chiang.  (UMF 72)  In the fall of2001, NG and MANSOURIAN \n6  spoke to Coach Zalesky. They told him they did not have the strength or skills necessary to compete \n7  against  males  for  a  place  on  the  team.  In  light  of these  statements,  he  urged  them  to  consider \n8  developing their skills by participating on a wrestling club sport team.  Coach Zalesky did not preclude \n9  the women from trying out.  NG understood that Coach Zalesky required all hopefuls to engage in a \n10  wrestle-off to determine who would make the team.  She participated in a wrestle-off with incoming \n11  freshman Plaintiff MANCUSO, who pinned her.  (UMFs 73,82) \n12  D.  MANCUSO Was Never a Member of the Wrestling Team \n13  MANCUSO wrestled in high school and competed in various high school tournaments and \n14  competitions.  She also once competed in the U. S. National Wrestling Championships while in high \n15  school, using freestyle rules, and participated in fue Aggie Open tournament in early 2001, also while \n16  still in high schoo!.  (UMF 74) \n17  MANCUSO entered UC Davis in the fall of2001 and received her degree in September, 2006. \n18  Her eligibility to participate in varsity athletics expired in June, 2006. (UMFs 75)  MANCUSO was \n19  gone from the Davis campus most of her college career. She spent her junior year (2003/04) abroad \n20  studying in New Zealand and then spent November 2004 through January,  2005  traveling in New \n21  Zealand and working fuere while she was on a planned educational leave from UC  Davis.  She re \n22  emolled as a full-time student in February 2005, took classes, and then went to Ireland for a SUlllffier \n23·  session.  MANCUSO returned from Ireland in September 2005 and attended a program in Washington, \n24  D.C. from September through December 2005.  (UMF 76-77) \n25  MANCUSO, who was the most skilled of the Plaintiffs in regard to wrestling, admitted she \n26  could not defeat any of the males who were trying out for the team in the fall of2001 and testified that \n27  she had no desire to wrestle against men at the collegiate level because \"they would squash me.\" (UMF \n28  81)  Consistent with his usual practice and the agreement approved by fue  OCR (see infra), Coach \n11 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{OOS3774l.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 17 of 46\n1  Zalesky held try-outs for the wrestling team in the fall of 2001  by having students in the same weight \n2  class engage in wrestle-offs against each other. Coach Zalesky had MANCUSO engage in a wrestle-off \n3  against  NG  first,  as  both  were  in  the  lightest  weight  class  and  comparable  in  their  weights. \n4  MANCUSO pinned NG quickly and went on to wrestle-off against a male in the same weight class. \n5  The male student pinned MANCUSO within 30 seconds.  (UMF 82) \n6  As a result of the wrestle-offs, Coach Zalesky cut a number of students, including NG and \n7  MANCUSO, as well as the male who defeated MANCUSO in the wrestle-off and several other males. \n8  These students were cut because they did not have the skills and abilities to  wrestle at the NCAA \n9  Division I level.  Coach Zalesky was allowed a roster maximum of thirty wrestlers and filled that roster \n10  with the most skilled and competitive wrestlers in each weight class. (UMF 83)  MANCUSO has never \n11  participated in a world wrestling competition or the Pan American Games, nor has she made any effort \n12  to do so.  (UMF 84) \n13  E.  Events in 2000/2001 \n14  UC Davis Athletic Director Greg Warzecka instituted a roster management program. Under the \n15  terms of the program, each men's varsity team had an upper limit on the number of student-athletes \n16  who could be on the team roster. Although both sexes can try out for a place on the UC Davis wrestling \n17  team, it is considered a men's sport because the NCAA only sponsors men's wrestling and thus subject \n18  to roster management. The purpose of roster management, which is used for both budgetary and gender \n19  equity purposes,  is to  limit spending on men's teams.  The head coaches of all men's teams were \n20  notified in writing of this requirement. (UMF 85) \n21  In the fall of 2000, Burch was told via a letter from Warzecka that the limit on the size of the \n22  wrestling team roster was thirty student-athletes. Burch had advised the students that because of the \n23  roster management program, \"it could might come down to some people who really want to be out here \n24  not being able to be out here.\"  He did not say this to the women because in his opinion, the roster cap \n25  did not apply to females. (UMF 86)  After receiving the letter, Burch sent an e-mail to Warzecka asking \n26  him to raise the roster maximum to 32-34 spots.  Warzecka agreed to increase the cap to 34.  Burch \n27  filled all 34 roster spots with males.  (UMF 87)  Warzecka did not care whether Burch had all men, or \n28  men and women on the wrestling team roster so long as the total number of student-athletes did not \n12 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774 I DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 18 of 46\n1  exceed the expanded maximum of 34.  He considered the roster management program, including roster \n2  maximums or caps, to  apply to  all members of the men's team no  matter what the  gender of any \n3  particular athlete was.  In his opinion, if women who did not have the skill necessary to earn a spot on \n4  the team were permitted to remain on a team over and above the roster cap, that would be unfair to \n5  males who were not selected for the team because they did not have the necessary skill.  (UMF 88) \n6  Warzecka and Burch had a discussion about the wrestling team roster in October, 2001.  Burch \n7  contends that Warzecka requested he move the women to club sport status.  Warzecka contends they \n8  discussed Burch's roster and his request to increase the allowable number.  During the course of the \n9  discussion, Warzecka asked Burch what he was going to do with the women as they were not included \n10  on his proposed roster.  Burch responded that they were not competitive, and that he did not have the \n11  time to devote to them 7•  Warzecka replied that in that case, a wrestling sport club should be formed so \n12  the  women  could  participate  in  wrestling  at  a level  that  was  commensurate  with  their  skills  and \n13  abilities. (UMF 89)  On October 30, 2001  Burch submitted a roster of 34.  None of the 34 student \n14  athletes listed were women. (UMF 90)  At the end of October or early November 2000, Burch told \n15  MANSOURIAN, NG and Bell that the administration was not supportive of women's wrestling and \n16  that he had been told to take them off the team.  He also told them that notwithstanding the fact they \n17  were not on the team, they could continue coming to practices, which they did.  (UMF 91)  Burch did \n18  not tell the women about the imposition of the roster limit or that he had not allotted any of the limited \n19  spots to them. (UMF 92) \n20  F.  OCR Complaints \n21  On April 25, 2001 NG and MANSOURlAN submitted a written complaint to the OCR. They \n22  alleged they had been subject to gender discrimination because they were told they could no longer \n23  participate on the wrestling team.  (UMF 93)  Warzecka and Associate Athletic Directors Swanson and \n24  Gill-Fisher were  notified  of the  existence  of the  complaint  in early  May  via a memo  from  NG, \n25  MANSOURlAN and Reinis dated April 30, 2001. This was the first notice they had of the complaint. \n26  This was also the first complaint relating to gender issues in the intercollegiate athletic program that the \n27 \n28 \nBurch was one of several part-time head coaches.  In addition to his coaching duties, he also had obligations \nassociated with his position as a lecturer in the Religious Studies department. \n13 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774l.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 19 of 46\n1  campus had received during Director Warzecka' s employment. The campus administrators understood \n2  the complaint to relate solely to the wrestling team, not to the intercollegiate athletic program as a \n3  whole.  (UMF 94) \n4  On May 14,2001 NG and MANSOURIAN filed a second (supplemental) OCR complaint.  This \nS  complaint contains a list of allegations pertaining to  the wrestling program and the participation of \n6  women in it.  (UMF 95)  On June 26, 2001  NG submitted a third complaint to  OCR on behalf of \n7  herself, MANSOURIAN, and MANCUSO.  This complaint was based on athletic scholarships issued \n8  to various members of the wrestling team, and Warzecka's response to Burch's effort to give female \n9  wrestlers scholarship money only after he leamed his contract would not be renewed. (UMF 96) In \n10  August 2001, MANSOURIAN filed a fourth OCR complaint.  This one was based on the decision not \n11  to renew Burch's contract.  Plaintiffs contended that decision constituted retaliation against women \n12  wrestlers.  (UMF 97) \n13  After OCR representatives advised members of the Athletic Department administration of the \n14  substance of the  April 25,  2001  complaint, Associate Vice  Chancellor Robert Franks conducted an \nlS  inquiry into the allegation made by MANSOURIAN and NG that the Athletic Director had removed \n16  the women from the wrestling team roster. He spoke with a number of people regarding the allegation \n17  including Warzecka, Dennis Shimek (the campus Title IX compliance officer), Swanson, Gill-Fisher \n18  and Burch.  As a result of his investigation, Franks concluded that Burch had submitted a roster for the \n19  2000/01  season that did not include the women wrestlers and, thus, they were indeed not part of the \n20  wrestling team.  Burch denied removing the women from the team, as did Warzecka.  It was Franks' \n21  opinion that Burch had not included the women on the roster that year because there was a roster cap, \n22  and he had wrestlers more qualified than the women that he wanted to use to fill the limited roster \n23  spots.  (UMF 98)  The women had not been told of this decision.  (UMF 92) \n24  On May 9, 2001, Warzecka sent a letter to Burch requesting that he add NG, MANSOURIAN, \n2S  Reinis and CHIANG to the team roster provided they met NCAA, UC Davis, and Burch's requirements \n26  for membership on the team.  Burch declined to do so; accordingly, Vice Chancellor Franks notified the \n27  women of the decision. When he made this offer to the women, it was Franks' understanding that if the \n28  women desired to remain on the team the following year, they would have to compete for a position \n14 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 20 of 46\n1  just like any other student who wanted to be a member of a varsity team.  (UMF 99)  On May 14, 200 I, \n2  Shimek sent a letter to  the OCR investigator advising her that the  women had been placed on the \n3  wrestling team roster for the 2000/200 I school year.  As a result of this notification, the OCR closed \n4  the initial complaint.  (UMF 100) \n5  Franks met with MANSOURIAN and NG on May 16, 2001.  Plaintiffs asked if the campus \n6  would consider having two  roster caps for the  wrestling team -- one  for  men and one for  women. \n7  Franks passed on their inquiry to Gill-Fisher, Warzecka and Shimek.  (UMF 101)  They consulted with \n8  others, including legal counsel, to determine whether such a suggestion was feasible.  The conclusion \n9  was that it was not, for a variety of reasons.  Of those reasons, the foremost was that as a practical \n10  matter, not all students who are interested in participating in varsity athletics have the skill necessary to \n11  earn a spot on the team and not all  students who want to  be  a member of a varsity team can be \n12  accommodated. Each year, the Athletic Department receives eligibility forms from many more students \n13  who want to participate in intercollegiate sports than can actually be accommodated on the varsity \n14  teams.  There was an upper limit to the total number of student athletes who could be on the wrestling \n15  team,  which  was  the  roster  cap  assigned  by the  Athletic  Director.  (UMF  102,105,106)  Franks \n16  communicated this to Plaintiffs in an e-mail.  (UMF 103)  Plaintiffs asked whether the campus would \n17  waive the minimum number of participants necessary for a club sport team because they did not know \n18  if they could come up with the ten female students who were interested in wrestling, which was the \n19  minimum number of participants required for a club sport.  Franks advised them via e-mail that the \n20  minimum would be waived for them. (UMF 104) \n21  Mr. Shimek advised the OCR that he believed a resolution could be reached that addressed the \n22  issues raised by the supplemental complaint. (UMF 107) As a result, UC Davis and the OCR entered \n23  into  a Voluntary  Resolution  Plan.  The  campus  administration  chose  to  enter  into  the  Voluntary \n24  Resolution Plan because in its opinion, the marmer in which Burch had dealt with the issue of women \n25  who  wanted  to  participate  on  the  varsity  wrestling  team  had  created  confusion.  The  Voluntary \n26  Resolution Plan was not an admission by the campus that there had been any violation of state or \n27  federal law; rather, it was a specific plan to develop wrestling as a club sport and, where warranted by \n28  the eligibility and qualifications of female student-athletes, support their participation on the wrestling \n15 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774l.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 21 of 46\n1  team.  The  Voluntary Resolution Plan contained the following  points,  among others:  (1) male  and \n2  female students will be encouraged to compete for a position on the varsity wrestling team.  The coach \n3  of the wrestling team will select those athletes eligible for the final  squad list who demonstrate the \n4  highest skill  and competitive ability in their weight class;  and (2)  the  coach will  recruit the  best \n5  qualified wrestlers, regardless of gender, for the varsity intercollegiate (ICA) team.  (UMF 108) \n6  V. \n7  DURING THE TIME PERIOD IN QUESTION, UC DAVIS MET PRONG TWO OF THE \nTHREE PRONGED TEST AND THUS EFFECTIVELY ACCOMMODATED THE \n8 \nINTERESTS AND ABILITIES OF ITS FEMALE STUDENTS \n9 \n10  Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 holds that no person shall, on the basis of sex, \n11  be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n12  education  program  receiving  federal  financial  assistance.  20.  U.S.C.  §  1681(a).  The  Regulation \n13  implementing Title IX as it relates to athletics is found at 34 C.F.R. Part 106: \"No person shall, on the \n14  basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from \n15  another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any  interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or \n16  intramural athletics offered by a recipient [of federal funding] and no recipient shall provide any such \n17  athletics  separately  on  such  basis.\"  Subsection  (c)  requires  that  an  institution  which  operates  or \n18  sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics do  so in a manner that provides \n19  equal athletic opportunity to members of both sexes.  In determining whether equal opportunities are \n20  available, the Director (of the Office for Civil Rights, which is primarily charged with investigating and \n21  making findings on Title IX allegations) will consider, among other factors, \"whether the selection of \n22  sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both \n23  sexes,\" \n24  In 1979, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a Policy Interpretation on the \n25  athletics  aspect of Title IX.  See  44  Fed.  Reg.  71,413.  This Policy Interpretation set forth  what is \n26  referred  to  as  the  three-prong  test  for  compliance.  \"A university's  athletic  program  is  Title  IX-\n1 : \n27  compliant if it satisfies one of the following conditions [prongs  (l) intercollegiate level participation \n28  opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their \n16 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 22 of 46\n1  respective enrollments,  or  (2)  where  the  members of one  sex have been and  are underrepresented \n2  among intercollegiate athletes, ... the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program \n3  expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members of \n4  that sex, or (3) where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and \n5  the institution cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, ... it \n6  can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and \n7  effectively accommodated by the current program.\"  Neal v.  Board of Trustees of the California State \n8  University, 198 F.3d 763,768 (9th Cir. 1999).  The three-prong test has been universally accepted by \n9  the courts (see e.g. Cohen v.  Brown University [Cohen IV), 101 F. 3d 155 (lst Cir.1996)) and the courts \n10  have given substantial deference to the Department's interpretation of its own regulations.  Roberts v. \n11  Colorado State Bd. OfA  griculture, 998 F.2d 824, 828 (loth Cir. 1993).  Equally accepted by the courts \n12  is the authority of the Department of Education and its Office for Civil Rights to issue ·Clarifications on \n13  the  implementing  regulation.  These  Clarifications,  as  well  as  OCR's  1990  \"Title  IX  Athletics \n14  Investigator's Manual,\" have been used by courts as sources of guidance for OCR investigators and for \n15  courts that are faced with making a determination on whether an institution is in compliance with Title \n16  IX  in regard to  a claim of ineffective accommodation.  Cohen  v.  Brown  University [Cohen I},  809 \n17  F .Supp. 978, 983-84 (D. Rhode Is. 1992). \n18  The UNIVERSITY contends that as a matter of law, it is and has been during the time period in \n19  issue in this case in compliance under prong two.  The 1996 \"Clarification ofIntercollegiate Athletics \n20  Policy  Guidance:  The  Three-Part  Test\"  issued  by  OCR  provides  the  roadmap  for  determining \n21  compliance.  See Nat 'I.  Wrestling Coaches Ass 'n.  v.  Dep't.  of Education,  263  F .Supp.2d 82,  92-93 \n22  (D.C.  2003).  In what is  commonly referred to  as the \"Dear Colleague\" letter from Norma Cantu, \n23  Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, that accompanied the Clarification, Cantu noted the Clarification \n24  confirmed that a school need only comply with one of the three prongs, and that prong two involves \"an \n25  examination of an institution's good faith expansion of athletic opportunities through its response to \n26  developing interests of the underrepresented sex at that institution.\" She also stated \"the Clarification \n27  does not provide strict numerical formulas or 'cookie cutter' answers to the issues that are inherently \n28  case-and fact-specific. Such an effort not only would belie the meaning of Title IX, but would at the \n17 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 23 of 46\n1  same time deprive institutions of the flexibility to which they are entitled when deciding how best to \n2  comply with the law.\"  The 1996 Clarification itself states as follows in regard to prong two: \n3  \"There  are  no fixed  intervals  of time  within  which  an  institution  must have  added \nparticipation opportunities.  Neither is a particular number of sports dispositive. Rather, \n4 \nthe focus is on whether the program expansion was responsive to the developing interests \nand abilities of the underrepresented sex. \" (emphasis added) \n5 \n6  \"OCR will consider the following factors, among others, as evidence that may indicate a \nhistory of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests \n7 \nand  abilities  of  the  underrepresented  sex:  [I]  an  institution's  record  of  adding \n8  intercollegiate  teams,  or  upgrading  teams  to  intercollegiate  status,  for  the \nunderrepresented sex; [2] in institution's record of increasing the numbers of participants \n9  in intercollegiate  athletics  who  are members of the underrepresented  sex;  and  [3]  an \ninstitution's  affirmative  response  to  requests  by  students  or  others  for  addition  or \n10 \nelevation of sports.\" (emphasis added) \n11 \n\"OCR will consider the following factors, among others, as evidence that may indicate a \n12 \ncontinuing  practice  of program  expansion  that  is  demonstrably  responsive  to  the \ndeveloping interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex: [1] an institution's current \n13 \nimplementation of a nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the addition of \n14  sports  (including  the  elevation  of  club  or  intramural  teams)  and  the  effective \ncommunication of the policy or procedure to students; and [2]  an institution's current \n15 \nimplementation of a plan of program expansion that is responsive to developing interests \nand abilities.\"  (emphasis added) \n16 \n17  In the 1996 Clarification, the OCR provided hypothetical examples to illustrate the principles \n18  set forth in the document.  One such hypothetical is: \n19  \"At the inception of its women's program in the mid-1970s, Institution C established \nseven teams for  women.  In  1984  it  added a women's varsity team at  the request of \n20 \nstudents and coaches. In 1990 it upgraded a women's club sport to varsity team status \nbased on a request by the club members and an NCAA survey that showed a significant \n21 \nincrease  in  girls  high  school  participation  in  that  sport.  Institution  C  is  currently \n22  implementing a plan to add a varsity women's team in the spring of 1996 that has been \nidentified by a regional study as an emerging sport in the region.  The addition of these \n23 \nteams resulted in an increased percentage of women participating in varsity athletics at \nthe institution. Based on these facts,. OCR would find Institution C in compliance with \n24 \npart two because it has a history of program expansion and is continuing to expand its \n25  program for women to meet their developing interests and abilities.\" \n26 \nThe few courts that have addressed the issue of compliance under prong two were faced with \n27 \nwomen's intercollegiate athletic programs that bear no  resemblance to the women's  intercollegiate \n28 \nathletic program at UC Davis. The seminal case of Cohen  v.  Brown, supra,  is illustrative.  Brown \n18 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(00537741.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 24 of 46\n1  University downgraded two longstanding women's varsity teams (gymnastics and volleyball) to club \n2  status in 1991. Almost all women's varsity teams at Brown were created between 1971 and 1977. The \n3  only women's team created after that period was winter track in 1982.  908 F.Supp. at p. 981.  When \n4  the District Court first ruled on the request for a preliminary injunction in 1992, it found that Brown did \n5  not meet the criteria for prong two compliance. The Court of Appeal did not disturb that finding.  991 \n6  F.2d at p. 903.  In Roberts v. Colorado State Bd. OfA  griculture, supra, suit was filed in June 1992 after \nthe university discontinued its women's fast pitch softball team and did not replace it with another \n7 \nsport. The District Court issued an injunction reinstating the team.  Both the District Court and the \n8 \nCourt of Appeal found that the university could not claim compliance under prong two because, apart \n9 \nfrom  creating a women's sports program in the  1970's consisting of eleven sports and then adding \n10 \nwomen's golf in 1977, it had done nothing more to expand the program. To the contrary, Colorado had \n11 \ndropped three women's sports and its overall opportunities for women had decreased by 34%. In sum, \n12 \nColorado had not added any new teams between 1977 and 1992 and had dropped three teams during \n13 \nthat time. \n14 \nLouisiana State University was sued for  ineffective accommodation in  1994.  Pederson  v. \n15 \nLouisiana  State  University,  912  F.Supp.  892  (M.D.  LA.  1996).  Women's intercollegiate  athletics \n16 \nstarted at LSU in 1977.  Fast pitch softball was added in 1979, but was dropped following the 1982/83 \n17 \nseason \"with no credible reason given.\" No additional women's sports were added until 1993 when the \n18 \ndecision was made to add fast pitch softball and soccer in the 1995 season.  By the time the District \n19 \nCourt ruled in 1996, the softball and soccer teams had been established but, per an agreement with the \n20 \nSoutheastern Conference schools, actual competition had been delayed.  LSU's prong one (substantial \n21 \nproportionality between intercollegiate athletic participation numbers  for men and women and their \n22 \nrespective enrollments) numbers were staggeringly disproportionate: 51% of the student body was male \n23 \nand 49% female, but the male athletic participation rate was 71 % while the female participation rate \n24 \nwas 29%.  In addressing prong two and finding that LSU was not in compliance under that test, the \n25 \nCourt stated \"this Court finds that historically LSU has demonstrated a practice not to expand women's \n26 \nathletics at the university before it became absolutely necessary to do so.\" Id.  at p. 916.  Prior to the \n27 \ndecision made in 1993, no new women's teams had been added for 14 years.  In addition, although \n28 \nsoftball and soccer were added after the 1993 decision, by the time the Court ruled those teams were \n19 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774LDOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 25 of 46\n1  both  operating  under  \"considerable  handicaps\"  which  called  into  issue  the  adequacy  of LSU's \n2  commitment to expansion.  Finally, in Barrett v.  West  Chester  University,  2003  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS \n3  21095 (E.D. Pa. 2003), the school announced in 2003 that it was dropping women's gymnastics and \n4  men's  lacrosse.  Several  members  of the  gymnastics  team  sued  for  an  injunction  mandating  the \n5  reinstatement of the team.  The university made the decision to drop gymnastics notwithstanding a \n6  strong recommendation against doing so by the campus' Sports Equity Committee which oversees Title \n7  IX issues. This was one of the factors considered by the District Court in coming to the conclusion that \n8  the school did not meet prong two. The school had last added a new women's sport (soccer) in 1992. \n9  Prior to that, its last addition ofa women's sport was in 1979. \n10  In contrast to Brown University, LSU, Colorado State and West Chester University, UC Davis \n11  has demonstrated both a history and practice of program expansion for women.  UC Davis had an \n12  established women's sports program prior to the passage of Title IX. The teams in this program were \n13  akin to competitive club teams that competed with comparable teams from other schools.  UC Davis \n14  was a founding member of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AlAW  ) which was, \n15  in the 1970's, the national governing body for women's intercollegiate athletics. (UMF 113) To the \n16  best recollection of persons who were involved in women's athletics at UC Davis when Title IX went \n17  into effect, the  women's teams that existed at that time  were basketball,  field hockey,  swimming, \n18  softball,  tennis, volleyball and track/field. These teams competed under AlA W rules and, thus, were \n19  considered varsity sports. Women's gymnastics, which had previously been a club team, was added in \n20  1974.  Women's cross-country, which had also previously been a club team, was added in 1977.  (UMF \n21  114) \n22  When the NCAA agreed to  sponsor championships in certain women's sports in 1981, UC \n23  Davis  switched its  membership  in the  AlAW    to  the NCAA,  in regard to  women's intercollegiate \n24  athletics. (UMF 115)  The only women's varsity sport that has been eliminated at UC Davis since the \n25  passage of Title IX is field hockey. The field hockey team last competed in the 1982/83 school year.  It \n26  was dropped as a varsity sport because all other schools in the conference that UC Davis was in at the \n27  time had dropped the sport, causing a lack of competition. There was also a decrease in interest in that \n28 \n20 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774 1D  OC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 26 of 46\n1  sport at the high school level.  In the fall of 1983 UC Davis replaced field hockey with varsity women's \n2  soccer, which was a much more popular sport at the high school and collegiate level. (UMF 116) \n3  In the mid 1990's the entire University of Cali fomi a system was undergoing severe budget cuts. \n4  These budget cuts threatened to significantly affect the intercollegiate and recreational sport programs \n5  on campus. A vote was put to the student body via a referendum process in 1994 and as a result, an \n6  initiative called the Student Activities and Services Initiative (SASI) was passed. The effect of the \n7  SASI  was  to  increase  student fees,  with  the  extra money  being  used  for  intercollegiate  athletics, \n8  intramural and club sports, recreation programs, the Equestrian Center, the Student Health Center, and \n9  the Women's Resource and Research Center. (UMF 117) \n10  As a result of the passage of SASI, there were funds available to  expand the intercollegiate \n11  athletics program.  In the spring of 1995, consideration was  given to  adding new varsity teams for \n12  women. The campus had a formal written process for evaluating information relating to new varsity \n13  teams and for obtaining proposals from students or other persons who were advocating on behalf of a \n14  particular sport.  (UMF 118)  Proponents of five sports (water polo, crew, badminton, lacrosse and field \n15  hockey),  all  of which  had  existing  club  sport  teams  except  badminton,  submitted  proposals  for \n16  elevation to varsity status. After receiving input from various student athlete groups, the Director of \n17  Intramural and Club Sports, and the New Women's Sports Advisory Committee the Acting Athletic \n18  Director (Keith Williams) recommended that women's water polo, lacrosse, and crew be elevated to \n19  varsity status. These three sports became varsity sports in the fall of 1996.  (UMF 119) \n20  Indoor and outdoor track are two different sports. There are different requirements for them \n21  under NCAA regulations.  When Deanne Vochatzer, the head coach for women's track and field at UC \n22  Davis started in her position in 1991, the campus only had an outdoor track team.  In her opinion, the \n23  lack of an indoor track team adversely affected her ability to  recruit student-athletes to UC Davis. \n24  Vochatzer met with the Athletic Director in order to make a proposal and to obtain authorization to \n25  have women student-athletes compete in indoor track events.  She received the authorization to do so as \n26  long as the cost of entering such events came out of the outdoor track budget. (UMF 120)  Women first \n27  started  competing  in  indoor track  events  in  approximately  1994,  but  the  sport  was  not  actually \n28  established as a team at UC Davis until 1999.  At that time, there were a sufficient number of student-\n21 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774 I DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 27 of 46\n1  athletes to meet the NCAA minimum requirements for an indoor team.  The indoor track events that the \n2  women  competed  in  prior  to  1999  and  continuing  through  today  were  and  are  all  head-to-head \n3  competitions with other Division II (now Division I) teams.  (UMF 121) \n4  In 2003, another call was made for proposals to consider adding a new women's varsity sport. \n5  Again, this was done pursuant to a formal process with written guidelines that specifically set forth the \n6  process and the criteria used to select a new sport. Those criteria include (l) the overall impact on \n7  gender equity; (2) interest level;  (3) sport sponsorship and available competition; and (4) facilities. \n8  Proposals were submitted on behalf of five women's sports: bowling, field hockey, golf!, horse polo \n9  and rugby. (UMF 122) Ms. Gill-Fisher chaired a committee consisting of a representative of Athletic \n10  Administration Advisory Committee, a representative of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee, and \n11  a representative of the Sports Club Council.  The committee met with a representative of each sport that \n12  submitted a proposal, reviewed the written proposals, and then summarized the information.  (UMF \n13  123) This information was passed on to Athletic Director Warzecka who reviewed it and made the \n14  recommendation that women's golf be added as a varsity sport.  The reasons he  recommended golf \n15  over the other sports proposed are (1)  golf is a championship sport in the Big West Conference and per \n16  Conference rules, UC Davis was required to add sports that are already part of that conference before \n17  adding non-conference sports;  (2) women's golf was  offered by 451  universities nationally, which \n18  reflects the interest level in the sport; (3) the NCAA has a golf championship in all three divisions; (4) \n19  UC Davis received many inquiries from female high school students who were interested in golf; and \n20  (5) the local community had indicated a strong support of golf, including use of the El Macero Country \n21  CI ub  in Davis. Funding for this additional team came from the intercollegiate athletics budget.  In \n22  addition,  start-up  costs  and  additional  funding  were  provided by  supporters  of women's  golf and \n23  alumni donations. Warzecka set forth the basis for his recommendations in a memorandum to the Vice \n24  Chancellor for Student Affairs.  (UMF 124)  Since an NCAA championship existed for women's golf, \n25 \n26  Plaintiffs have made much ado about the fact that the proposal for women's golf was prepared by Associate \nAthletic Director Robert Bullis, rather than by a student.  There is no requirement that such proposals be submitted by a \n27  particular person. The 1996 Clarification refers to an institution's response to requests by students or others for addition or \nelevation of sports.  Mr. Bullis supervised the sport of men's golf.  There was no women's golf club team (golf club teams \n28  are rare because of the need for a golf course on which to play and practice), so it made sense for Mr. Bullis to submit the \nproposal.  (See Exhibit G, Declaration of Robert Bullis, 1I2.) The fact that a proposal was submitted by Mr. Bullis has no \nimportance to a prong two analysis. (Exhibit J, Declaration of Christine Grant, 1115.) \n22 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 28 of 46\n1  it was not unusual to add it as a varsity sport in the absence of an existing club sport team.  (UMF 125) \n2  Women's golf was selected as the new varsity sport.  Kathy DeYoung was appointed as the head coach \n3  for the team in 2004.  She spent the 2004/2005 school year developing and recruiting a team, and the \n4  team started competition in the 2005/2006 school year.  (UMF 127) \n5  Every Court that has decided the issue of prong two compliance has made its decision based on \n6  facts pertaining to the history of the women's athletic program in issue.  The Courts of Appeal have \n7  recognized that a determination by a District Court on the issue of whether a school is in compliance \n8  under one of the three  prongs is  a judgment call which will not be  disturbed  absent a finding  of \n9  unreasonableness. Cohen v. Brown University [Cohen II}, 991 F.2d. 888, 903 (1st Cir. 1993).  The facts \n10  relating to the addition of new varsity sports for women at UC Davis are not in dispute.  In the early \n11  1970's there were seven teams. A team was added in 1974 and another in 1977.  Field hockey was \n12  discontinued after the  1982/83 season and replaced by soccer in the fall of 1983. Three sports were \n13  added in  1996.  Indoor track was added in  1999. Golf was added in 2004 and began competing the \n14  following year. This pattern shows a continuing expansion of the women's intercollegiate program, and \n15  is consistent with the hypothetical set forth in OCR's 1996 Clarification, particularly in regard to the \n16  changes made between 1996 and 2005.  While it is true new sports were not added as frequently prior \n17  to 1996, the law does not require an institution to \"leap to gender parity in a single bound.\" Cohen v. \n18  Brown [Cohen II}, supra at p. 898.  Plaintiffs did not enter UC Davis until 1998 at the earliest (NG) and \n19  2001 at the latest (MANCUSO).  To the extent they attempt to argue the campus was not in compliance \n20  in the 1970's and 1980's, they will be unable to show that had any impact on them.  See Pederson, \n21  supra at p. 907 [LSU's violation of Title IX did not personally impact three of the plaintiffs.] \n22  Both sides in this case have expert witnesses on the issue of whether U C Davis complies with \n23  prong two.  Defendant contends that based on the facts set forth above alone, the Court can determine \n24  whether UC Davis complies under prong two. However, the expert's positions may assist the Court in \n25  coming to a conclusion. \n26  The UNIVERSITY's expert is Dr. Christine Grant.  Dr. Grant served as the Women's Athletic \n27  Director at the University ofIowa between 1973 and 2000.  She holds a Ph.D. and a bachelor's degree \n28  in physical education, and has taught extensively on the issue of Title IX and gender equity in athletics. \n23 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 29 of 46\n1  She has coached at the high school, collegiate, and international levels.  (UMF  13 3)  Dr.  Grant has \n2  served as  the  President of the Association for  Intercollegiate Athletics  for  Women,  which was  the \n3  governing body for women's intercollegiate athletics before the NCAA.  She also served as a member \n4  of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Collegiate Women Athletic Administrators \n5  (NACWAA), and then as NACWAA's President between 1987 and 1989. (UMF 134)  Dr. Grant has \n6  received numerous awards  and recognitions  for  her work in  women's  intercollegiate  athletics,  has \n7  published extensively on the subject, and has been consulted by the Department of Education on Title \n8  IX issues.  She has served as and qualified as an expert on Title IX issues in numerous cases including \n9  the seminal case of Cohen v. Brown University.  (UMF 135) \n10  Plaintiffs' expert is Dr. Donna Lopiano who was, until recently, the Chief Executive Officer of \n11  the Women's Sports Foundation.  Dr. Lopiano usually finds herself on the same side of a case as Dr. \n12  Grant. Their opinions on many issues in this case are harmonious. They agree that a school has many \nl3  options regarding compliance with Title IX. There is nothing in Title IX that mandates that a college or \n14  university have every sport available for both genders. (UMF 138) They agree there is nothing in the \n15  Regulations or Clarifications pertaining to Title IX that delineates how often a school must add a new \n16  sport  in  order to  comply  under prong two.  (UMF  139)  They  both  disagree  with  the  prong  two \n17  hypothetical set forth in the  1996 Clarification to the extent it indicates the addition of a new team \n18  every six years is acceptable for a school that is not in compliance on prong one.  Grant and Lopiano \n19  believe that a more reasonable span is two to three years.  (UMF 139) \n20  In Dr. Grant's opinion, UC Davis is in compliance under prong two because of its demonstrated \n21  history and practice of program expansion.  She focuses on the fact that UC Davis voluntarily added \n22  three new women's varsity sports at one time in 1996 (crew, lacrosse and water polo), followed by the \n23  addition of women's indoor and women's golf.  This qualifies as a history of program expansion that \n24  complies with prong two. (UMF 142)  UC Davis was under no obligation to add three sports at one \n25  time -- it could have elected to phase in each new sport every six years (if OCR's example is accepted) \n26  or  every  three  years  (if the  positions  of Lopiano  and  Grant  are  accepted).  Instead,  it  voluntarily \n27  established the three new sports at the same time, significantly expanding participation opportunities \n28  for women.  Dr. Grant is of the opinion that the addition of the three sports in 1996 should be viewed \n24 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 30 of 46\n1  the same as if it had added one new sport in 1996/96, one in  1998/99, and one in 2001102.  To do \n2  otherwise would have the result of penalizing prong two  schools that add more than sport at once. \n3  (UMF 143) \n4  Lopiano rejects this approach and contends the addition of three sports at once has the same \n5  effect as  the  addition of one  sport.  Her position is  contrary to  purpose of Title IX.  If Lopiano's \n6  approach is followed, schools that rely on prong two for compliance will be strongly discouraged from \n7  adding more than one new women's sport at any point in time because they will lose the ability to rely \n8  on the single addition of multiple sports as evidence of a history of program expansion.  Instead, those \n9  schools will add the new sports one at a time, spaced out over two to three year intervals, which will \n10  result  in  the  unnecessary  delay  of program  expansion  and  the  unnecessary  loss  of competitive \n11  opportunities for young women, the majority of whom have only  a four year window in which to \n12  compete at the varsity level.  (UMF  144)  There is nothing in the  Title IX  statute, Regulation or \n13  Clarification that delineates how a school can comply under prong two. To the contrary, the OCR has \n14  specifically chosen to  avoid a \"cookie cutter\" approach and instead allows  flexibility.  Dr.  Grant's \n15  approach is consistent with OCR's approach. \n16  Dr.  Grant  also  found  that  UC  Davis  has  a  continuing practice  of program  expanSIOn,  III \n17  addition to a history of expansion, based on the following: (1) the campus has a formalized procedure \n18  for considering proposals to add new varsity sports, including a list of the criteria used to assess the \n19  proposals and the process that must be followed; (2) this procedure has been used to determine which \n20  new women's sports should be added; (3) UC Davis established a Title IX Coordinator position and a \n21  Title IX Workgroup in the 1980's, at a time when most universities were ignoring Title IX; (4)  UC \n22  Davis has had an Athletic Administrative Advisory Committee and a Coach's Advisory Committee for \n23  many years indicating a commitment to broad-based input on athletics issues; (5) the campus conducted \n24  self-assessments on its women's athletics program in the 1980's, even when Title IX was not being \n25  enforced at all because of the Grove City College v.  Bell  case; and (6) the campus has a Title IX \n26  grievance process available  to  students.  All  of these factors  are  indicative of an institution that is \n27  dedicated to the ongoing expansion of athletic opportunities for women.  (UMF 145) \n28  Plaintiffs contend prong two carmot be used when a school has eliminated a team. This is not \n25 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774l.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 31 of 46\n1  correct.  Per the  1996  Clarification,  \"in  the  event that  an  institution  eliminated  any  team  for  the \n2  underrepresented sex,  OCR would evaluate the  circumstances  surrounding this  action in assessing \n3  whether the institution could satisfy part two of the test.\"  One of the hypothetical examples of prong \n4  two compliance in the 1996 Clarification includes a school that eliminates a team for a valid reason. \n5  UC Davis eliminated women's field hockey because of a lack of competition and a lack of interest in \n6  the  sport at  that time.  Field hockey was  replaced by  soccer,  which was  much more popular with \n7  students. (UMF 116)  Unlike LSU, which dropped women's softball \"without a credible explanation\" \n8  for its actions and without replacing it with another sport, UC Davis had a rationale for its actions. \n9  Certain sports  can decrease in popularity, which in turn  leads  to  a lack of student interest and a \n10  corresponding lack of available competition. (UMF 147) The fact that UC Davis dropped varsity field \n11  hockey  and  replaced it with  women's varsity  soccer is  not  indicative  of a failure  to  demonstrate \n12  program expansIOn. \n13  In a prong two analysis, another issue that must be considered is whether (notwithstanding a \n14  history of program expansion) there has been a decrease in the number of participation opportunities. \n15  The presence of a decrease does not preclude reliance on prong two; rather, the reason for the decrease \n16  must be examined.  The OCR will consider a valid reason for a decrease.  (UMF  148)  When  first \n17  approached about testifying for UC Davis, Dr. Grant noted there were fluctuations in the number of \n18  women participating in intercollegiate athletics at UC Davis between 1995 and 2004 per the Equity in \n19  Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) reports.  She inquired as to the reason and was satisfied with the \n20  information provided which was that the campus had eliminated \"B\" or junior varsity water polo and \n21  lacrosse teams because of lack of available competition.  Dr. Grant, who has considerable experience as \n22  an Athletic Director, is well aware of the problem of lack of available competition for intercollegiate \n23  junior varsity teams, and was surprised to find that UC Davis maintained its JV teams for as long as it \n24  did. (UMF 149) \n25  The experience of the water polo team demonstrates this point. When the water polo team was a \n26  club team, in addition to the \"A\" team, it also had a \"B\" or secondary team which was equivalent to a \n27  JV team.  After water polo became a varsity sport, it became increasingly difficult to find competition \n28  for the \"B\" team. Other schools within UC Davis' geographic competition area were dropping their \n26 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support or Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 32 of 46\n1  junior varsity teams and junior colleges did not want to compete with a Division II team.  In addition to \n2  lack of competition, it became logistically challenging for the head coach try to maintain practices for \n3  both teams which in turn adversely affected the quality of the coaching and experience that the student \n4  athletes were receiving.  (UMF 128)  At the end of the 2001 season, head coach Jamey Wright, with the \n5  agreement of the leaders of the \"B\" water polo team, worked with the \"B\" team members to reestablish \n6  the water polo club team and have those athletes compete at the club level where there was available \n7  competition for them. As a result, the number of student-athletes on the roster for the varsity water polo \n8  team changed from a number in the forties to a number in the high twenties or low thirties.  In the \n9  coach's opinion, the quality of the varsity experience for the members of the team increased as a result \n10  of the change in the roster size, as he is able to spend more time coaching each athlete.  (UMF 129) \n11  Notwithstanding the fluctuations in the participation numbers, in less than one decade (1995-\n12  2004), UC Davis increased women's participation in varsity sports from 32% to  50%, despite being \n13  challenged by the fact that the female undergraduate population has increased at greater rates than the \n14  male undergraduate population. In Dr. Grant's expert opinion, this is good progress and indicative of \n15  continuous program expansion under prong two.  (UMF 150) \n16  In conclusion, U C Davis has exercised its right to comply with Title IX under prong two and \n17  has demonstrated a continuing history of program expansion at a pace that is compliant with the statute, \n18  as well as a continuing practice of expansion. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' ineffective accommodation claim \n19  is without basis. \n20  VI. \n21  UC DAVIS DID NOT \"ELIMINATE\" A WOMEN'S WRESTLING TEAM OR \nOPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO TRY OUT FOR THE WRESTLING TEAM \n22 \n23 \nPlaintiffs claim UC Davis violated Title IX and eliminated their opportunity to participate in \n24 \nwrestling by requiring them to try out for a spot on the team roster under the same terms and conditions \n25  as male students. Their argument is based on the fact that Burch did not require MANSOURIAN or NG \n26  to  do  so.  Burch's  preferential  treatment  of MANSOURIAN  and  NG  did  not  entitle  them,  or \n27  MANCUSO (who entered Davis after Burch departed) to a guaranteed spot on the roster for each year \n28  they were undergraduate students. \n27 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774IDOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 33 of 46\n1  Coach Zalesky requires hopefuls for the wrestling team to demonstrate they have the skill and \n2  ability necessary to wrestle at the NCAA Division I level before they will be given a place on the team. \n3  Competition is the cornerstone of intercollegiate competition -- it begins with team try-outs.  The head \n4  coach of an intercollegiate team has the sole responsibility of determining which students have the \n5  skills necessary to earn a spot on the team.  In wrestling, that determination is made by conducting \n6  wrestle-offs.  (UMFs 10,49,51,109) Trying out for a team is an integral part of varsity athletics.  Not \n7  everyone who wants to be on a team can be. (UMF 109)  The privilege of being a member of a varsity \n8  team is  earned via demonstration of the necessary skill and ability to  compete at the varsity level. \n9  Those who do not possess the skills at the varsity level may pursue their athletic interests at the club \n10  sport level.  (UMF 109)  The club sport program at UC Davis is very robust. Club teams compete at \n11  the Recreational, Competitive II and Competitive I levels. Recreational teams focus on instruction and \n12  recreational activities on campus. Competitive II teams travel and compete against teams from other \n13  schools and amateur organizations. Competitive I teams also travel and compete with teams from other \n14  schools,  but  in  a  format  leading  up  to  a  national  championship.  Similar  to  varsity  sports,  most \n15  Competitive I and Competitive II club sports belong to a conference.  In some sports, such as co-ed \ncycling, the Competitive I club team is equivalent to a varsity team in regard to the level of competition \n16 \nbecause it is the highest level of intercollegiate competition offered for that sport.  (UMF 110, Ill) \n17 \n18  Any enrolled student may participate in a club sport. (UMF 112)  Thus, there are many participation \nopportunities available for those who  have not reached the elite level  of skill that is necessary for \n19 \nvarsity intercollegiate athletics. \n20 \nCoach Zalesky'S approach to selection of team members is not only consistent with the method \n21 \nfollowed almost universally by coaches whose teams exist in the highly competitive environment of \n22 \nintercollegiate athletics but also with the Plan approved by the OCR: \"The coach of the wrestling team \n23 \nwill select those athletes eligible for the wrestling team's final squad list who demonstrate the highest \n24 \nskill and competitive ability in their weight classes.\"  (UMF  108,  Exhibit 24)  The  reason it was \n25 \nnecessary to put this basic premise into writing was because Burch (whom Plaintiffs hold up as their \n26 \nchampion) did not require women to tryout for the team, nor did he hold them to the same standards as \n27 \nmales  who  wanted  to  wrestle.  (UMF  48)  In his  opinion,  the  women  were  not competitive  at  the \n28 \nintercollegiate level. (UMFs 48, 50)  Burch was willing to allow them to practice and to compete in an \n28 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 34 of 46\n1  occasional open tournament, but his willingness to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk regarding \n2  women ended at that point.  He did not provide the women with uniforms, nor did they compete in \n3  regular intercollegiate competition (dual meets) as the male wrestlers did.  He did not offer the women \n4  any scholarship money, except for a belated attempt to do so after he found out that his contract was not \n5  going to be renewed.  (UMFs 33, 37, 38, 53, 58, 59, 63, 69)  When Warzecka told Burch (and the \n6  coaches of the other men's teams) that they must comply with roster limits in the fall of 2000, Burch \n7  did not allot any of his limited roster spots to the women, even after he was given four more spots at his \n8  request.  (UMFs 87, 90)  The reason Burch did so is understandable; NO and MANSOURIAN did not \n9  even have the skills to earn a spot on the team, no less compete against UC Davis' wrestling rivals. \n10  While Burch may have been willing, prior to the enforcement of roster management, to have \n11  female students on the team who could only compete at the open tournament level, Zalesky is not.  The \n12  UC Davis wrestling team participates in very few open tournaments. Its primary form of competition is \n13  dual  meets  with other Pac-lO  schools and the NCAA championships.  Coach Zalesky would never \n14  recruit or otherwise give a place on the varsity roster to a student, regardless of gender, who was solely \n15  interested in participating in open tournaments.  Although all wrestlers selected for the team may not \n16  always compete (such as when they are red-shirting), it is his expectation that every wrestler selected \n17  for the team will at some point be able to viably compete in dual meets and championships. (UMFs 12, \n18  13) Those students who try out for the team but cannot demonstrate the necessary level of wrestling \n19  skill are cut, regardless of their gender. (UMF 83) \n20  Burch's approach to the women did not bind the campus or his replacement, nor does Title IX \n21  require that a school treat females preferentially as opposed to equally. There is nothing in 34 CFR \n22  106.41 (b) or any case interpreting Title IX that requires a coach to place students on a varsity team \n23  simply because they are female and want to participate in the sport.  Title IX does not mandate that \nwomen be treated preferentially, nor does it require that women who try out for a team that is also \n24 \n25  populated by men be allowed to do so under differential criteria. (UMF 161) \nThe drafters of Title IX and its Regulations recognized there are differences between males and \n26 \nfemales  and that those differences may affect the  ability of members of one  sex to  compete with \n27 \nmembers of the other sex. 34 CFR part 106.4I(b) states that schools may operate sex-segregated teams \n28 \n29 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 35 of 46\n1  for members of each sex where selection for membership on the team is based on competitive skill or \n2  where the activity involved is a contact sport. Despite the fact that OCR considers wrestling to be a \n3  contact sport, UC Davis has always allowed women to tryout for the team.  (UMF 9)  Per subsection \n4  (b), if a school has a team for one sex but not the other and athletic opportunities for that sex have \n5  previously been limited, \"members of the excluded sex9 must be allowed to try-out for the team offered \n6  unless the sport involved is a contact sport.\"  There is no requirement that members of the \"excluded \n7  sex\" be placed on a team simply because they are female, or because they cannot otherwise earn a spot \n8  on the team based on skill and ability.  All that is required is an opportunity for a student to show that \n9  she or he has the necessary skill and ability, in the opinion of the coach, to warrant inclusion on the \n10  team. Judge Roberts of the Western District of Missouri summed it up succinctly in the context of a \n11  equal protection argument arising from a girl's desire to tryout for a boys' middle school football team: \n12  \"Nichole Force obviously has no legal entitlement to a starting position on the Pierce City Junior High \n13  School eighth grade football team, since the extent to which she plays must be governed solely by her \n14  abilities, as judged by those who coach her. But she seeks no such entitlement here. Instead she seeks \n15  simply a chance, like her male counterparts, to display those abilities. She asks, in short, only the right \n16  to try.\" Force v. Pierce City R-VI School Dist., 570 F.Supp.1020, 1031(D. Mo. 1983).  Plaintiffs and all \nother wrestling team hopefuls were given the right to try. \n17 \nThere is no statutory or constitutional right to participate in college athletics or to be given a \n18 \nspot on a particular team simply because a student desires to participate in that sport.  Miami University \n19 \n20  Wrestling Club v.  Miami University, 302 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir. 2002); Burrows v.  Ohio High Sch. \nAthletic Ass 'n,  891  F.2d  122,  125  (6th Cir.  1989).  Under Plaintiffs'  theory,  they were absolutely \n21 \nentitled to a place on the intercollegiate wrestling team throughout their college careers because the \n22 \nformer coach permitted them to  practice with the team and because they participated in one  open \n23 \ncompetition.  Title IX does support their claim of entitlement.  Participation in intercollegiate athletics \n24 \nis a privilege, not a right. Lesser v. Neosho County Comm. College, 741 F.Supp. 854, 861. \n25 \nPlaintiffs also argue females should not be counted under a team's roster cap or maximum. \n26 \n27 \n28 \nThis reference most often applies to women, not men. \n30 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(00537741.D0C) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 36 of 46\n1  Roster management or \"capping\" is used for both budgetary and gender equity purposes. (UMF 85) \n2  There are no established limits on caps; rather, the decision is again left up to the institution. (UMFs \n3  105, 106)  While the practice of limiting the number of males on a team for gender equity purposes \n4  passes constitutional muster (see Neal v.  Trustees, supra) there is nothing in Title IX or its regulations \n5  that requires a school to put otherwise unqualified women on a varsity team over and above the roster \n6  maximum established for the team.  Roster management is based on the understanding that there is a \n7  limit to the number of students who can participate on a varsity team -- not everyone who wants to do \n8  so can be a member of a varsity team.  By its nature, intercollegiate athletics is not an \"all comers\" \n9  event. The size of a team is determined by a competitive process that narrows down the squad to the \n10  size that is right for the institution. (UMF 106)  Athletic Director Warzecka did not care whether the \n11  wrestling  coach  filled  the  roster  spots  with  males  or  females,  so  long  as  he  did  not  exceed  the \n12  maximum. If UC Davis allowed women who do not have the skill or ability to earn one of the roster \n13  spots to be on the intercollegiate team nonetheless, it would be discriminating against males who are \n14  not given a roster spot because they too lack the requisite abilities. (UMF 88) \n15  Finally, to  the extent Plaintiffs argue that a separate women's wrestling team existed at UC \n16  Davis and was later \"eliminated\", this is simply not borne out by the facts.  There has never been a \n17  separate  schedule of competition for  women.  There  has  never  been a separate media guide  for  a \n18  women's wrestling team.  The media guides for the wrestling team consistently described women's \n19  wrestling as having unofficial status. (UMFs 19,20,21,2224)  The women never wrestled in a UC \n20  Davis  uniform  or  competed  in  dual  meets  with  other members  of the  conference.  At most,  they \n21  participated or attempted to participate in a fundraiser tournament once a year. (see above)  The UC \n22  Davis wrestling team was not a mixed varsity team as the women did not compete against other varsity \n23  teams. A mixed gender team is one that has both male and female members, and both male and female \n24  members of the team compete against male and  female  members of comparable teams from  other \n25  schools. (UMF 159)  The situation that existed during the Burch years was that a few female students \n26  participated in a very limited manner with the other members of the team, all of whom were male. That \n27  limited participation did not morph into a separate team for women.  Since there was no separate team, \n28  there is no basis to the claim that UC Davis eliminated a women's wrestling team. \n31 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774LDOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 37 of 46\n1  VII. \n2  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF INTENTIONAL \nDISCRIMINATION OR DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE BY THE UNIVERSITY \n3 \n4 \nA  Title  IX  plaintiff may  not  recover  damages  absent  proof of intentional  discrimination. \n5 \nAlexander v.  Sandoval,  532  U.S.  275,  280-81,  121  S.  Ct.  1511,  1516 (2001); Ferguson  v.  City  of \n6 \nPhoenix,  157  F.3d 668,  674-75  (9th Cir.  1998).10  Since Plaintiffs have  dismissed  their class  and \n7 \ninjunctive claims (and only damage claims remain), fuey  must provide sufficient evidence that any \n8 \nalleged Title IX violations were \"intentional\" in order to proceed to trial.  See Horner ex reI. Horner v. \n9 \nKentucky High Sch. Ath. Ass'n, 206 F.3d 685,696-97 (6th Cir. 2000) (granting summary judgment on \n10 \nTitle IX claim due to lack of evidence of intentional discrimination).  In the alternative, they may prove \n11  that an educational institution is \"deliberately indifferent\" to a plaintiffs Title IX rights.  Gebser v. \n12  Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290,118 S. Ct. 1989, 1999 (1998).  Deliberate indifference \n13  occurs where a defendant's actions are \"clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" \n14  Reese v.  Jefferson Sch.  Dist.  No.  14J, 208 F.3d 736,  139 (9th Cir 2000).  There is no evidence that \n15  representatives of the UNIVERSITY acted with the intent to discriminate against Plaintiffs or that their \n16  actions were \"clearly unreasonable in light of the know circumstances.\" \n17  A.  The UNIVERSTlY Acted Promptly Upon Receiving Notice of the OCR Complaint and \nResolved the Matter to the Satisfaction of OCR. \n18 \n19  When the UNIVERSITY learned of the OCR complaint filed by MANSOURIAN and NG, it \n20  quickly  took  steps  to  investigate  the  accusations  and,  with  the  guidance  of the  OCR,  develop  a \n21  resolution. (UMFs 94-104, 107-108)  The resolution did not include any finding by the OCR that the \n22  UNIVERSITY violated  Title  IX,  and  resulted  in  a  Voluntary  Resolution  Plan  which  specifically \n23  delineated that  male  and  female  students would  be  encouraged to  compete  for  a  position  on the \n24  intercollegiate team, and that the coach would select those students who demonstrate the highest skill \n25  and competitive ability in their weight class. (UMF 108) This Court may consider the letter issued by \n26 \n27  10  Both Sandoval and Ferguson discuss the requirement of intentional discrimination in the context of Title VI. \nWith one inconsequential exception,  Title VI and Title IX use identical language to describe the benefited class.  Cannon v. \n28  University of Chicago, 441  U.S. 677, 694-96, 99 S. Ct.  1946, 1956-57 (1979).  Accordingly, the statutes are interpreted \nconsistently.  Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 122 S. Ct. 2097,2100 (2002). \n32 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 38 of 46\n1  the  OCR (Defendant's Exhibit 24)  and  its conclusions, along  with the Voluntary Resolution Plan. \n2  Nelson  v.  Pima Community College,  83  F.3d  1075,  1080 (9th Cir.  1996).  In the fall  of 2000 and \n3  thereafter, UC Davis complied with the Plan by having Coach Zalesky conduct try outs and select those \n4  students  who  demonstrate  the  highest  skill  and  competitive  ability  for  membership  on  the \n5  intercollegiate team. (UMFs 82-83)  Compliance with a Plan approved by the OCR carmot be used as \n6  the basis for a claim of intentional discrimination. Grandson v.  Univ.  of Minn., 272 F.3d 568, 576 (8th \n7  Cir 2001).  Holding try-outs and selecting the most skilled athletes for the team is an approach that \n8  courts have recognized as valid and fair.  See Pederson v.  LSU, supra at p. 906 [\"Whether the Pinedas \n9  are in that group  [who make the team]  depends,  in part, upon the level of competition among the \n10  athletes who desire to get on the team and the subjective evaluations made by the university\"]' The fact \n11  that Plaintiffs do  not agree with the plan accepted by the  OCR also does  not equate to deliberate \n12  indifference. \n13  B.  Declination of the Request for Separate Roster Caps Was Reasonable. \n14  UC Davis declined Plaintiffs' request to create separate roster caps for males and females on the \n15  wrestling team. This is not evidence of intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference.  Neal v. \n16  Board of Trustees of the California State University, supra, is the Ninth Circuit's imprimatur for the use \n17  of roster management.  The problem arose in this case not because of the use of roster management, but \n18  because Burch did not tell MANSOURIAN and NG in the fall of 2000 that roster management for the \n19  wrestling team was in effect and that he had not allotted any of the limited roster spots to them. (UMF \n20  92)  The proposal posited by Plaintiffs for a \"separate roster cap\" for women is nothing more than a \nII \n21  request for preferential treatment, something that is not required by law. Coalition for Economic Equity \n22  v.  Wilson, 122 F.3d 692,708 (9th Cir. 1997) [\"Impediments to preferential treatment do not deny equal \n23  protection.  ...  While  the  Constitution  protects  against  obstructions  to  equal  treatment,  it  erects \n24  obstructions to preferential treatment by its own terms\"].  The UNIVERSITY considered Plaintiffs' \n25  request, researched the issue, and concluded that the request was not well founded. (UMF 102-103) \n26 \n27 \n11  The dispute between Burch and Warzecka about what each said, or did not say during their meeting in the fall of \n28  2000 about the status of the women wrestlers is not material for the purpose of the sole remaining issue in this case.  It is \nundisputed that even though they were not on the roster for that season, to some extent MANSOURIAN and NG continued \nto come to practices. \n33 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n(OOS37741.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 39 of 46\n1  c.  There is Insufficient Interest to Establish a Women's Varsity Wrestling Team \n2  That  UC  Davis  has  not created a women's varsity  wrestling  team  is  also  not evidence  of \n3  intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference. The fact that a few female students were interested \n4  in varsity wrestling does not mandate that UC Davis create a team for them.  As stated by the Women's \n5  Sports Foundation, \"Remember, if a complaint is filed, the investigator must find if there is interest by \n6  the underrepresented sex in adding opportunities.  It is not enough for you and one or two friends to scry \n7  you want to play soccer -- there have to be enough females interested to form a team.\"  (UMF  151) \n8  The issues of interest level and available competition playa large role in Title IX compliance.  Per the \n9  1979 Clarification, institutions are not required to upgrade teams to intercollegiate status or otherwise \n10  develop intercollegiate sports absent a reasonable expectation that intercollegiate competition in the \n11  sport will be available within the school's normal competitive regions. Federal Reg.  Vol.  44, No.  239, \n12  p.  7I  418.  The 1996 Clarification states that the OCR will consider whether there is unruet interest in a \n13  sport, sufficient interest to sustain a team in the sport, and a reasonable expectation of competition for \n14  the team. \n15  There have never been more than a few women who wanted to participate on the wrestling \n16  team. (UMF 45)  When MANSOURIAN and NG met with Vice Chancellor Franks in the spring of \n17  2001, they asked if the campus would waive the minimum number of students required to form a club \n18  sport team (l0), leading to the conclusion the interest level was low enough that even that minimum \n19  requirement could not be met. (UMF 104)  The \"indifference\" appears to exist on the part of female \n20  students who  purportedly have an interest in a varsity wrestling team.  When UC  Davis asked for \n21  proposals for  addition of new women's varsity sports,  neither Plaintiffs nor  any  other students  or \n22  representatives submitted one on behalf of women's wrestling.  (UMF 119, 122)  Surveys of freshmen \n23  students conducted by UC Davis in 2004 and 2005 showed almost non-existent interest in wrestling at \n24  the intercollegiate level by female students.  (UMF 132) \n25  Even though wrestling is an \"individual\" sport (meaning that wrestlers compete on a one-on \n26  one basis in each contest) this does not mean that a school has an obligation to establish a varsity team \n27  for just a handful of students.  In Roberts v.  Colorado, supra at fn.  10, the Court dismissed the notion \n28  that one  or two  students could demand the  creation of a varsity team.  \"The Investigator's Manual \n34 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 40 of 46\n1  addresses and obviates the possibility that one talented softball player could force the creation of an \n2  entire  team.  The  Manual  instructs  investigators  ...  to  review  'whether  the  institution  failed  to \n3  accommodate 'expressed interest,' for example, athletes of the underrepresented sex participating in a \n4  club sport express interest in intercollegiate ... competition or sufficient numbers of individuals to form \n5  a team request that a sport be offered.\" (Emphasis in original.) Similarly, in Pederson v.  LSU, the \n6  Court stated \"the existence of one or two students with interest and ability to participate in sports likely \n7  would not constitute a basis for a claim of ineffective accommodation and thus, violation of Title IX.\" \n8  Id.  at p. 906.  See also Wieker v.  Mesa County Valley School, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  11956, *25-26 \n9  (D. Co. 2007) [summary judgment granted for school because plaintiff failed to demonstrate sufficient \n10  interest in volleyball to sustain a team]. \n11  Although a men's wrestling team at an NCAA member school may have women wrestlers on it, \n12  the NCAA does not sponsor women's wrestling as a sport.  (UMF 1)  The NCAA has identified certain \n13  sports for women as \"emerging sports.\"  The criteria for consideration as an NCAA emerging sport are: \n14  (a) the activity in issue must meet the definition of a sport, there must be scheduled individual or team \n15  head-to-head competitions (at least five) within a defined competitive season, and standardized rules \n16  ratified by official agencies or governing bodies; (b) there must be 20 or more varsity teams and/or \n17  competitive club teams that currently exist on college campuses for the sport; (c) data must exist that \n18  demonstrates  support  for  the  sport  such  as  collegiate  or  intramural  sponsorship,  high  school \n19  sponsorship, non-scholastic competitive programs and associational and organizational support; (d) a \n20  demonstrated understanding that if the  sport is  identified as  an emerging sport, all NCAA member \n21  institutions wishing to  sponsor the sport will abide by NCAA rules and regulations;  (e) a proposal \n22  setting forth suggestions for championship rules and a format for the sport must be submitted; and (f) \n23  10 letters of support from the president or athletic directors of member institutions confirming they will \n24  sponsor the sport as an emerging sport must be submitted; the letters must be dated within one year of \n25  the submission of the proposal requesting identification as  an emerging sport. Archery, badminton, \n26  equestrian, rugby, squash, synchronized swimming and team handball are emerging sports. Women's \n27  wrestling has never been included on the list of emerging sports, nor has any organization or person \n28 \n35 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 41 of 46\n1  submitted a proposal meeting the above criteria for consideration of women's wrestling as an emerging \n2  sport.  (UMFs 2-4) \n3  Neither the NCAA nor the NAIA offers a women's wrestling championship. (UMF 156) The \n4  head coach of the wrestling team has never seen a woman compete for any of the teams that UC Davis \n5  regularly competes against in its conference. (UMF  154)  To the knowledge of Defendant's expert, \n6  there are only approximately five women's collegiate wrestling teams in the country. Plaintiffs' expert \n7  does not know what UC Davis' normal geographic competition is for the sport of wrestling, nor does \n8  she know of any intercollegiate athletic conferences that sponsor women's wrestling. (UMF 153)  An \n9  important consideration on the  issue  of adding new sports is  whether the  sport is  sponsored by  a \n10  conference,  as  that  guarantees  a number  of scheduled  matches.  (UMF  126)  The  one  collegiate \n11  women's wrestling team that exists at a California college is a club team. (UMFs 155)  This does not \n12  constitute a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition at the varsity level. \n13  While there has been a gradual increase in the number of female students in California who \n14  participate in wrestling at the high school level,  those numbers pale in comparison to high school \n15  participation  in  other  sports.  For  example,  according  to  the  California  Interscholastic  Federation \n16  website, in 2001  out of a total of 271,214 female high school students, 752 participated in wrestling \n17  while  4,588  high school  girls  participated  in  golf that  year.  In  2005,  1,230  girls  participated  in \n18  wrestling, as compared to 5,972 in golf. (UMF 6)  The decision as to which sports a school will sponsor \n19  lies solely within the discretion of the administration and/or the Athletic Director. (UMF 152) \n20  In the past twelve years, UC Davis has elected to add water polo, rowing, lacrosse, indoor track and \n21  golf because there is sufficient interest in those sports and regular competition is available. (UMF s 119, \n22  122, 123, 124)  Due to the lack of sufficient interest to field a team and the lack of available regular \n23  competition (as opposed to  a few  open tournaments),  the campus has chosen not to  add women's \n24  wrestling as a varsity sport at this time. \n25  In conclusion, the  UNIVERSITY's handling of the  issue of the  women wrestlers  does  not \n26  constitute intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference. UC Davis is not mandated to maintain \n27  parallel sports for both sexes. \"In the selection of sports, the regulation does not require institutions to \n28  integrate their teams nor to provide exactly the same choice of sports to men and women.  44Fed. Reg. \n36 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 42 of 46\n1  Vol.  44, No. 239, p.  71417-8.  Intentional discrimination is demonstrated where the defendant intended \n2  to treat women differently. Pederson v.  LSU, supra at p.  881.  UC Davis treated males and females \n3  exactly the same in  regard to earning a place on the varsity wrestling team.  Those students who \n4  possess exemplary skills are placed on the team.  Those students whose skill levels are not at the varsity \n5  level may participate at the club sport level, or chose not to wrestle at all. \n6  VIII. \n7  PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM OF ENTITLEMENT TO DAMAGES IS \nBARRED BECAUSE OF THEIR LACK OF NOTICE TO THE UNIVERSITY \n8 \nThe Supreme Court has held that under Title IX, an institution receiving federal funding may \n9 \nnot  be  held liable  for  damages  unless  an official of the  institution who  has  the  authority  to  take \n10 \ncorrective action was given actual notice of the specific Title IX violation alleged and was deliberately \n11 \n12  indifferent to it. Gebser v.  Lago Vista Indep .. School Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 118 S. Ct. 1989 (1998).  The \nTitle IX statute (20 U.S.c. § 1682) prohibits the OCR, as the enforcing agency, from taking action \n13 \nagainst a recipient of federal funds until the OCR has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with \n14 \n15  section 901 and has determined that compliance cannot be obtained by voluntary means.  In Grandson \n16  v.  Univ.  ofM  inn., supra, the Court upheld the dismissal of a Title IX damages claim because there was \nno evidence the plaintiffs gave prior notice of their complaints to university officials, that the university \n17 \nhad a reasonable opportunity to  rectify the alleged violations, or that the officials were deliberately \n18 \nindifferent to the allegations.  In reaching its conclusion, the Grandson Court used the same reasoning \n19 \n20  as  the  Supreme  Court.  Recovery  of damages  for  an  alleged Title  IX  violation is  the  result of a \njudicially implied system of enforcement, while the OCR's authority to enforce is expressly stated in \n21 \n22  the  statute.  It would  be  unsound  to  allow  for  the  recovery  of damages  without  notice  and  an \n23  opportunity to rectifY, while the same is required by the express wording of the statute. \n24  MANSOURIAN and NO admitted in the OCR complaint they filed in late April 2001 that they \n25  had  not  tried  to  resolve  their  complaint  through  the  school's  internal  grievance  procedure.  The \n26  complaint makes reference only to the wrestling team and their experience with it.  (UMF 93)  The May \n27  14, 2001  supplemental complaint also refers only to wrestling, as does the June 26, 2001  complaint. \n28  (UMF 95-96)  A claim of ineffective accommodation encompasses the entire athletic program for the \n37 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{0053774I.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 43 of 46\n1  underrepresented sex -- not just one specific aspect.  See Cohen v.  Brown [Cohen IJ supra at p. 989 \n2  [\"There is no rule of number of disparities that when reached constitutes a violation. Generally, the \n3  determination is whether, in reviewing the program as a whole, the disparities add up to a denial of \n4  equal opportunity to athletes of one sex\"]; Cohen v.  Brown [Cohen IIJ, supra at p. 906 [\"Title IX does \n5  not require institutions to find any particular number or type of athletic opportunities -- only that they \n6  provide those  opportunities in  a nondiscriminatory fashion  if they wish to  receive  federal  funds\"]. \n7  There is nothing in the OCR complaints filed by MANSOURIAN and NG that notified UC Davis they \n8  were making an allegation that the intercollegiate athletic program fails to effectively accommodate the \n9  interests  and  abilities  of female  students.  There  is  no  evidence  that  MANSOURIAN  or NG  ever \n10  participated in, or attempted to participate in, any varsity sport other than wrestling.  MANCUSO used \n11  sponsorship via the soccer coach to gain entry to UC Davis after she was initially not accepted as a \n12  student, but had no interest in participating in varsity soccer and was cut from the team before she ever \n13  became a member of it. She was never a member of the varsity soccer team. (UMFs 78-80) The OCR \n14  complaints contain only allegations pertaining to Plaintiffs' experiences with wrestling, which is the \n15  limited extent of their involvement in intercollegiate athletics at UC Davis. \n16  UC Davis would have no reason to believe a program-wide failure to accommodate claim was \nl7  being made.  The OCR complaint filed by MANSOURIAN and NG was the first complaint Warzecka \n18  and the Title IX compliance officer had received about UC Davis' athletic program. They understood \n19  the complaint related solely to an unusual set of circumstances involving women and the wrestling \n20  team  (UMF  94)  The  UC  Davis  women's  intercollegiate  athletic  program  has  received  national \n21  recognition for excellence.  Sports Illustrated for Women named UC  Davis as  the best Division II \n22  school for women athletes in  1999 and 2000.  UC Davis  has produced no  less than three NCAA \n23  Women of the Year winners since that program started in 1991.  The Woman of the Year Award is \n24  given  to  senior student-athletes  who  distinguish themselves in the  area  of academic  achievement, \n25  athletics, service and leadership.  Its women athletes have many national championships, and more than \n26  250 female student athletes at UC Davis have been named as All-Americans. (UMF 163)  The campus \n27  sponsors fourteen women's varsity teams: basketball, cross-country, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, rowing, \n28  soccer, softball, swimming/diving, tennis, indoor track, outdoor track, volleyball and water polo. (UMF \n38 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 44 of 46\n1  164) This is far more than the national average of 8.45.12  In 2002, Assembly Member Thomson named \n2  Senior Associate Athletic Director Gill-Fisher her Assembly District \"Woman of the Year\" because of \n3  Gill-Fisher's efforts and  accomplishments  in the  area of women's collegiate athletics.  (UMF  165) \n4  These milestones are reflective of a women's sports program that embodies the spirit and substance of \n5  Title IX. \n6  In  conclusion,  Title IX  worked  as  it was  designed to  work  in  this  case  in  regard to  the \n7  allegations pertaining to  the  wrestling team.  Plaintiffs  MANSOURIAN  and  NG made  a  specific \n8  complaint relating to the wrestling team to the OCR. UC Davis responded to the complaint and with the \n9  blessing of the OCR, devised a plan to ensure that all students understand that selection for inclusion on \n10  the varsity intercollegiate wrestling team requires competition with the other students who want to be \n11  on the team and demonstration of the requisite skills and abilities.  There was no notice to UC Davis of \n12  an  alleged  program-wide  failure  of effective  accommodation.  Accordingly,  Plaintiffs'  claim  for \n13  damages is barred. \n14  IX. \n15  CONCLUSION \n16  \"Opportunity is the possibility of participation, not the guarantee of participation.\" Pederson v. \n17  LSU, supra at p. 905.  Plaintiffs had the possibility of participation, as did other students who were \n18  interested in being part of the varsity wrestling team.  At the time they tried out for the team, Plaintiffs' \n19  wrestling abilities had not developed to the point where they were skilled enough to compete at the \n20  Division I level. Plaintiff NG did not even have a desire to compete. Their demand for preferential \n21  treatment  in  the  form  of inclusion on the  varsity team in the  absence  of the  requisite  skill is not \n22  mandated by Title IX, and UC Davis' declination of their demand for preferential treatment is not a \n23  violation of the statute. \n24  Plaintiffs MANSOURIAN and NG place great weight on the fact they were members of the \n25  team for a year or two during Burch's tenure.  Their participation on the team was not at all comparable \n26  to the participation level of the male members of the team.  The women never wrestled in a dual meet \n27 \n28  12  See \"Women in Intercoliegiate Sport: A Longitudinal, National Study Twenty Seven Year Update (]977-2006)\" \nby Linda Jean Carpenter and R. Vivian Acosta in conjunction with the National Association ofColiegiate Women Athletic \nAdministrators. \n39 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment \n{00537741DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 284    Filed 01/11/08   Page 45 of 46\n1  against another Pac-! 0 school.  They never wrestled in a UC Davis unifonn.  They didn't use collegiate \n2  wrestling rules. At most, once a year they participated in the Aggie Open fundraiser tournament. The \n3  media guides do not contain any infonnation about their wrestling records because they didn't have \n4  any. They were not given scholarships. At first blush, one may think this difference would fonn the \n5  basis for a claim by Plaintiffs that gender inequity existed. Not so.  Plaintiffs have no interest in being \n6  held to the same standards as the male members of the team.  Instead, they want to be varsity wrestlers \n7  and reap the benefits of that privilege without having to earn a spot on the team via competition with \n8  other students who have the same desire.  Fonner coach Burch's lax approach to the women, and their \n9  acceptance of it, did not guarantee Plaintiffs a spot on the varsity roster throughout their college career. \n10  The UNIVERSITY requests that the Court issue judgment in its favor on the sale remaining \n11  claim in this case. \n12  Dated:  January  -l-t-,2008  PORTER SCOTT \n13 \n::4:;;JE-~ \n-\n14 \n15 \nGeorge A.

INTRODUCTION \n2   Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 23(e), plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian and \n3 Lauren Mancuso hereby seek an Order approving the dismissal of their class claims in this action, by \n4 which they originally sought injunctive relief on behalf of persons similarly situated.   Subject to such \n5 approval, plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso, along with plaintiff Christine Wing-Si Ng, intend to \n6 pursue this action in their individual capacities only.1  Plaintiffs further seek an Order that notice to class \n7 members is not required as a condition of the dismissal of the class claims, based upon the fact that the \n8 proposed class has not yet been certified and based upon a finding that no class member will be bound \n9 by or prejudiced by the dismissal of the class claims.     \n10   Plaintiffs filed this proposed class action in December of 2003, seeking injunctive relief for the \n11 University of California, Davis’ (“UC Davis”) ongoing violations of federal and state civil rights laws.  \n12 Specifically, plaintiffs have alleged violations of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 \n13 U.S.C. § 1621 et seq.), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n14 Constitution (as enforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983), and various state statutes based upon defendants’ \n15 failure to provide women students at UC Davis with an equal opportunity to participate in varsity \n16 athletics and to receive varsity athletic scholarships.  In addition to classwide injunctive relief, plaintiffs \n17 seek damages on behalf of the individual named plaintiffs arising from defendants’ termination of their \n18 participation in varsity wrestling at UC Davis.  \n19   This motion is prompted by a series of events leading to the conclusion that it is now in the best \n20 interest of the class and of plaintiffs that this action be prosecuted as an individual action for damages on \n21 behalf of the named plaintiffs only, rather than as a class action with plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso \n22 as class representatives.  First, as the result of unavoidable delays in the prosecution of this action due to \n23 the serious illness of counsel and the eventual substitution of plaintiffs’ counsel, more than three years \n24 have elapsed since the filing of this action.  In the interim, plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso both \n25\n                                                           \n26\n1   Plaintiffs Nancy Nien-Li Chiang and Christine Wing-Si Ng filed this action in their individual \ncapacities only.  Plaintiff Chiang’s claims were dismissed in their entirety by stipulation of the parties on \n27\nMarch 29, 2007. \n1 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 5 of 13\n \n1 graduated from UC Davis and are no longer eligible to participate in varsity sports at UC Davis even if \n2 their sport, women’s wrestling, were reinstated.  Although plaintiffs sought classwide injunctive relief \n3 beyond the reinstatement of varsity women’s wrestling, defendant Regents has challenged plaintiffs’ \n4 standing to seek any injunctive relief, as well as their capacity to represent the proposed class, on the \n5 basis that they are no longer UC Davis students.    \n6   Second, in order to strengthen the class allegations, clarify the scope of the class claims and \n7 address defendants’ arguments concerning the standing of plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso to seek \n8 injunctive relief on behalf of the proposed class, plaintiffs sought leave from this Court to file a First \n9 Amended Complaint.  Among other things, the First Amended Complaint would have added three \n10 additional plaintiffs and proposed class representatives, Laura Ludwig, Jessica Bulala, and Kelsey Brust, \n11 each of whom are currently enrolled students at UC Davis.   On March 20, 2007, this Court denied \n12 plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file the proposed amended complaint.  \n13   Third, following the Court’s denial of leave to amend the complaint to add proposed plaintiffs \n14 Ludwig, Bulala, and Brust, those individuals have decided to file their own action on behalf of currently \n15 enrolled women at UC Davis based upon the Regents continuing failure to provide equal athletic \n16 opportunities for women at UC Davis, in violation of Title IX.   \n17   The combination of these events justify the dismissal of the class claims in this case and the \n18 continued prosecution of the case by plaintiffs in their individual capacities for damages.  Since \n19 voluntary dismissal of the class claims is sought prior to certification, no members of the proposed class \n20 will be bound by the dismissal of the class claims.  Moreover, no proposed class member will be \n21 prejudiced by the dismissal of the action.  The individuals who sought to enter this case in plaintiffs’ \n22 motion to amend now intend to file their own action for relief against the Regents.  Plaintiffs’ class \n23 claims in this case never sought damages on behalf of the members of the class, limiting class relief on \n24 all claims to equitable relief in the form of an injunction and declaratory relief.  Any members of the \n25 proposed class will either be in the position of the current plaintiffs, having graduated from UC Davis \n26\n27\n2 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.

No proposed class member will have relied to her detriment \n5 on the existence of this action as a class action. Nor will any class member have any basis to object to \n6 the dismissal of the class claims in this action and the pursuit of those claims in a separate action \n7 involving current students as class representatives. Accordingly, plaintiffs request that this Court \n8 approve the dismissal of the class claims from this action without requiring notice to the class.  \n9 II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n10   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on December 18, 2003.  (Docket # 1.)  Defendants filed a motion \n11 to dismiss the case under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on March 5, 2004  \n12 (Docket # 13-15), which this Court denied on May 6, 2004 (Docket # 18-21, 25).   \n13   Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification on December 7, 2005 to be heard on February \n14 24, 2006.  (Docket # 62-70.)  The hearing was continued to April 21, 2006.  (Docket # 82 & 93.)  \n15 Defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on April 4, 2006.  (Docket # \n16 103-107.)  Thereafter, the hearing on class certification was set for April 27, 2007, with supplemental \n17 briefing to be filed prior to the hearing.  (Docket # 156.)  By stipulation of the parties, approved by the \n18 Court, the hearing was further continued to May 25, 2007, the date on which it is now set. (Docket # \n19 179.) \n20   On April 18, 2006, for good cause shown, the Court granted a motion by plaintiffs for a stay of \n21 all deadlines and scheduling matters due to the serious health problems of plaintiffs’ counsel, Kristen \n22 Galles of Equity Legal.  (Docket # 125.)  In order to allow sufficient time for Ms. Galles to find \n23 substitute or additional counsel, the Court vacated all deadlines and stayed the action until a status \n24\n                                                           \n25 2   Although plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso, as recent graduates, no longer have a personal \nstake in the reinstatement of a wrestling team at UC Davis or other injunctive relief, they contend that \nthey continue to have standing to represent the class for such relief under the doctrine of inherently \n26\ntransitory claims.  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 52 (1991).  Defendants contend \notherwise, however.  Given the desire of other women at UC Davis to pursue an action for classwide \n27\ninjunctive relief on behalf of current students, there is no reason to litigate the issue in this case. \n3 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 7 of 13\n \n1 conference on June 16, 2006.  (Id.)  In response to a Stipulation by the parties, and a subsequent motion \n2 by plaintiffs, the Court extended the stay until a status conference on September 8, 2006.  (Docket # \n3 137.) \n4   Attorneys at The Sturdevant Law Firm and Equal Rights Advocates entered a Notice of \n5 Appearance as new lead counsel for plaintiffs on August 18, 2006.  (Docket # 140.)  Monique Olivier of \n6 The Sturdevant Law Firm and Noreen Farrell of Equal Rights Advocates immediately conferred with \n7 Nancy Sheehan, counsel for defendants, about pending scheduling matters.  On August 23, 2006, the \n8 Court granted the parties’ stipulation to extend the stay and continue the status conference to November \n9 3, 2006.  (Docket # 143.)  On October 20, 2006, the Court granted the parties’ further stipulation to \n10 extend the stay and continue the status conference to January 26, 2007.  (Docket # 149.) \n11   The parties submitted their Joint Status Report on January 19, 2007.  (Docket # 154.)  In this \n12 report, plaintiffs advised the Court of their desire to seek leave to amend the Complaint to add an \n13 additional plaintiff and proposed class representative, and to add related allegations.  (Id. at 2:4-7.)  On \n14 January 22, 2007, the Court vacated the status conference set for January 26, 2007 and stated it would \n15 issue a written order.  (Docket # 155.)  On January 24, 2007, the Court issued the 2nd Amended Status \n16 (Pretrial Scheduling) Order (Docket # 156), which granted plaintiffs’ request to move for leave to amend \n17 the Complaint (id. at 1:27-2:9).  Thereafter, the motion for leave to amend was filed and fully briefed by \n18 the parties. (Docket # 158-161, 164-169.)  On March 20, 2007, this Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for \n19 leave to file the proposed amended complaint.  (Docket # 175.) \n20 III.  ARGUMENT \nA.  Subject to Court Approval, a Class Action or Class Claims in an Action May Be \n21 Dismissed Prior to Certification Where There Is No Prejudice to Class Members. \n22   Rule 23(e)(1)(A) requires court approval of “any settlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise \n23 of the claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(A).  Although the rule, by \n24 its terms, appears to apply only to the dismissal or settlement of a certified class, the majority of circuits \n25 considering the issue, including the Ninth Circuit, have held that it applies to the pre-certification \n26 dismissal or settlement of any action which includes class allegations.  Diaz v. Trust Territory of Pac. \n27 Islands, 876 F.2d 1401, 1408 (9th Cir. 1989); Baker v. America’s Mortgage Servicing, Inc., 58 F.3d 321, \n4 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 8 of 13\n \n1 324 (7th Cir. 1995) (citing Glidden v. Chromalloy Am. Corp., 808 F.2d 621, 626 (7th Cir. 1986)); Kahan \n2 v. Rosenstiel, 424 F.2d 161, 169 (3d Cir. 1970).  But see Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d 1298, 1303 \n3 (4th Cir. 1978) (taking the approach that a case with class allegations should not be considered a true \n4 class action until the class has been certified). \n5   The purpose of the requirement under Rule 23(e) that court approval be obtained for the \n6 dismissal of class claims is “to discourage the use of the class action device by the individual \n7 representative plaintiff to secure an unjust private settlement and to protect the absent class members \n8 against the prejudice of discontinuance.”  3 Conte & Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 8:18, p. 219 \n9 (4th ed. 2002); see, e.g., Yaffe v. Detroit Steel Corp., 50 F.R.D. 481, 482-83 (N.D. Ill. 1970) (denying a \n10 Rule 15(a) amendment as a matter of course where the amendment dismissing the class claims would \n11 have clearly subverted the purpose of Rule 23(a)).  The concern arises almost exclusively in the context \n12 of a negotiated settlement or understanding between the parties, where the named plaintiff agrees to \n13 dismiss or severely compromise the class claims and, as a result, receives a more advantageous \n14 settlement than she otherwise might have obtained.  \n15   Notwithstanding the fact that Rule 23(e) applies to pre-certifications dismissals as well as efforts \n16 to dismiss or compromise the claims of a certified class, a court’s “duty to inquire into a settlement or \n17 dismissal differs before and after certification.  Before certification, the dismissal is not res judicata \n18 against the absent class members and the court does not need to perform the kind of substantive \n19 oversight required when reviewing a settlement binding upon the class.”  Diaz, 876 F.2d at 1408 \n20 (citation omitted); see Larkin Gen. Hosp., Ltd. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 93 F.R.D. 497, 501 (E.D. Pa. \n21 1982) (when a dismissal is early in the action and prior to the certification period, “the judicial inquiry \n22 under [Rule 23(e)] can be much more modest than it typically is after certification”).  \n23   “In no pre-certification dismissal would the court reject the dismissal and require anything more \n24 than notice to the class and an opportunity to intervene.”  Diaz, 876 F.2d at 1408.  This is the case \n25 because  “any order entered in the uncertified case binds solely the individual plaintiff and not absentee \n26 class members.”  Id. at 1407 (citing Shelton v. Pargo, Inc., 582 F.2d at 1303).  Moreover, where, as here, \n27\n5 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 9 of 13\n \n1 the proposed dismissal of class claims is unconnected to any settlement favoring the named plaintiffs, no \n2 abuse of the class action mechanism has occurred and the underlying purposes of Rule 23 are satisfied. \n   \n3 B.  Court Approval of the Dismissal of the Class Claims in this Case Is Appropriate \nBecause the Rights and Interests of the Putative Class Will Not Be Prejudiced in \n4 Any Way And, in Fact, Will Be More Effectively Advanced in a Separate Action. \n5   The proposed dismissal of the claims of the putative class in this action is unrelated to any \n6 pending or suggested settlement or compromise of the claims asserted.  Instead, it is the logical response \n7 to plaintiffs’ unsuccessful effort to amend the complaint to add new class representatives who are \n8 current UC Davis students.  Rather than engage in extensive litigation in this action over the issue of \n9 their standing to pursue injunctive relief on behalf of the class and their ability, as non-students, to \n10 represent the interests of the proposed class, the named plaintiffs propose that the class claims be \n11 dismissed from this action and pursued in a related action by current UC Davis students.  Thus, there can \n12 be no suggestion of collusion on the part of plaintiffs and defendants and no possibility that the named \n13 plaintiffs will benefit in any manner, at the expense of the class, by the dismissal of the class claims.  \n14 Instead, plaintiffs Mansourian, Mancuso, and Ng will simply continue to pursue their claims in this \n15 action in their individual capacities, seeking individual damages only, while the class claims for \n16 injunctive relief are litigated in the related action.   \n17   Nor will there be any other prejudice to members of the putative class resulting from the \n18 dismissal of the class claims in this action.  First, as discussed above, since no class has yet been \n19 certified in this case, the proposed class members are not bound by any decision of this court, including \n20 a decision approving the dismissal of the class claims in their entirety.  Second, the only relief this action \n21 seeks on behalf of the class is injunctive relief based upon the alleged continuing violations by UC \n22 Davis of Title IX and other applicable laws.  No damages claims have ever been asserted on behalf of \n23 the class.  Accordingly, no argument can be made that dropping the class claims will result in the loss of \n24 damages for individual class members.  Further, since the entitlement to injunctive relief is based upon \n25 the facts at the time such relief is sought, any class member’s ability to file an action for injunctive relief \n26 is unaffected by the dismissal of the class claims for injunctive relief in this action.  \n27\n6 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 10 of 13\n \n1   Finally, any doubt that the interests of the class are being protected in connection with the \n2 voluntary dismissal of the class claims in this case is extinguished by the proximate filing of a related \n3 action on behalf of current UC Davis women students seeking injunctive relief based upon the same type \n4 of claims as asserted in this action.  In this new action, several current women athletes at UC Davis, \n5 including those who would have become named plaintiffs and proposed class representatives in this \n6 action had plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend the complaint been granted, will assert claims on behalf \n7 of similarly situated individuals.  As in this action, those claims are based upon the Regents’ failure to \n8 provide women students at UC Davis with an equal opportunity to participate in varsity athletics and to \n9 receive varsity athletic scholarships.  Just as in this case, the claims alleged in that case include \n10 violations of Title IX, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \n11 Constitution (as enforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983), and violations of state statutes and public policy.  \n12 Thus, there is no possibility that class members whose claims plaintiffs are proposing to have dismissed \n13 will go unrepresented on those claims.  To the contrary, their claims will be fully litigated in the new \n14 action, unencumbered by the issues raised in this case regarding the named plaintiffs’ standing to seek \n15 the relief sought or their adequacy as class representatives. \n16   The dismissal of the class claims in this case is fair and reasonable because it is without any \n17 benefit to the named plaintiffs, is sought prior to any certification of the class, will not  prejudice the \n18 rights of absent potential class members, and will occur in the context of a new action being filed on \n19 behalf of current UC Davis women students seeking the same relief.  For each of these reasons, approval \n20 of the dismissal of the class claims in this action should be granted. \n   \n21 C.  Notice to the Class Is Not Required and Should Not Be Ordered as a Condition of \nApproving Dismissal of the Class Claims. \n22  \n23 Although Rule 23(e) requires notice in all certified class actions, notice to the class is not \n24 necessarily required or appropriate in the case of a pre-certification dismissal.  Diaz, 876 F.2d at 1408; \n25 see George W. v. U.S. Dept. of Educ., 149 F. Supp. 2d 1195, 1202 (E.D. Cal. 2000) (“Notice serves no \n26 purpose when judgment is entered against a plaintiff before a class has been properly certified and \n27\n7 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 11 of 13\n \n1 notified, for it is binding only on the named Plaintiff.”  (citing Besinga v. United States, 923 F.2d 133, \n2 136 (9th Cir. 1991))). \n3   Under Diaz, notice of pre-certification dismissal has three purposes.  First, it protects a defendant \n4 by preventing a plaintiff from appending class allegations to extract a more favorable settlement.  \n5 Second, it protects the class from objectionable relief or depletion of limited funds available to pay class \n6 claims.  Third, notice protects the class from prejudice it would otherwise suffer if class members have \n7 refrained from filing suit because of knowledge of the pending class action.  Diaz, 876 F.2d at 1409-10.  \n8 Where “no one’s rights are being cut off and no potential abuses are present,” the Rule 23 notice \n9 requirement should not be enforced.  Sheinberg v. Fluor Corp., 91 F.R.D 74, 75 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) \n10 (citations omitted). \n11   Based on all of these factors, notice is not required in this case.  Plaintiffs are asking the Court to \n12 dismiss the class claims without prejudice to those claims and without settlement of their individual \n13 claims.  Plaintiffs are obtaining no benefit at all from dismissal of the class claims.  There is, therefore, \n14 no risk that plaintiffs used class allegations to obtain a more favorable settlement or that the class claims \n15 are being dismissed in connection with a settlement that includes objectionable relief or depletion of \n16 limited funds.  \n17   The only remaining inquiry for the Court is whether potential class members have refrained from \n18 filing suit because of knowledge of the pending class action and will be prejudiced by relying on the \n19 existence of this action.  Diaz, 876 F.2d at 1409.  Since no damages claims were ever asserted in this \n20 case on behalf of the proposed class members, no putative class members could have relied upon the \n21 pendency of this action for the potential recovery of any damages claims they might have had.  With \n22 respect to class wide injunctive relief, any female students at UC Davis who continue to be affected by \n23 the defendants’ alleged unlawful conduct will benefit as absent class members in the class litigation filed \n24 by other current students.  See, e.g., Shinsato ex rel. Shinsato v. Abbott Laboratories, No. C-02-1015 \n25 MMC, 2003 WL 22114265, *1 (N.D. Cal. Sep. 5, 2003) (pendency of other class actions seeking the \n26 same relief is a factor justifying the voluntary dismissal without notice to class members).  Moreover, \n27 even if new class litigation on the same claims were not being pursued, such individuals would remain \n8 \n28\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF COURT APPROVAL OF DISMISSAL OF CLASS CLAIMS, WITHOUT NOTICE  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 184    Filed 04/26/07   Page 12 of 13\n \n1 free to bring their own action for injunctive relief as long as the alleged unlawful conduct persists.  \n2 Finally, to the extent that putative class members in this action are no longer directly affected by the \n3 defendants’ ongoing violations of law (e.g., because they have graduated from or no longer attend UC \n4 Davis), they would not benefit from classwide injunctive relief in this case and are, therefore, unaffected \n5 by the dismissal of the class claims seeking such relief.  The potential for prejudicial reliance on \n6 plaintiff’s action by any putative class members, therefore, is virtually non-existent. \n7   The conclusion that notice is not required here is consistent with a number of cases that have \n8 held that no notice is required when a voluntary dismissal of an action is without prejudice to absent \n9 class members and, therefore, consistent with the purpose of Rule 23(e).

The panel's decision simply re-\nmands the case to the district court for trial, but UCD seeks a further delay by erroneously claiming that the decision \nexpressed “statements” that conflict with established Title IX standards and must be revisited. (Petition for Rehearing \n(“PFR”) 1.) \n \nNone of the issues raised by UCD demonstrates the exceptional circumstances that would warrant en banc review or \npanel rehearing. UCD does not argue that the decision presents any inter- or intra-circuit conflict. Indeed, it concedes \nthat there is no appellate case law on the issues it argues here. Instead, UCD points to the very agency interpretation \nthat the Court applied and argues that the Court got it wrong. Rehearing is not, however, a remedy for a party that \nmerely does not like the outcome of a decision. \n \nUCD's petition is framed by several fundamental misunderstandings regarding the posture of the case, the holdings of \nthe Court, and the reach of this decision. The case came to this Court on review of an order granting summary \njudgment in favor of UCD on the basis that Plaintiffs were required, but failed, to give notice to UCD before seeking \ndamages under Title IX. The Court reversed that order, and UCD does not seek review here of that determination. \n \nInstead, UCD argues that the Court erred when it then considered and rejected UCD's own argument that summary \njudgment should be affirmed on the alternative ground that it was in compliance with Option Two of Title IX's \nthree-part participation test because it proved a history and continuing practice of program expansion for female \nstudents. UCD's petition contends that the Court “held,” contrary to accepted Title IX standards, that program ex-\npansion must be measured by an increase in the number of female athletes as opposed to the number of participation \nopportunities, thus precluding an institution from double counting, i.e., counting an athlete that plays on two teams as \ntwo participation opportunities. But this Court made no such holding. Rather the Court properly applied the Title IX \nstandards, as to which all parties and the panel agree, and held that UCD was not entitled to summary judgment be-\ncause it failed to prove as a matter of law on an undisputed factual record that it has a history and continuing practice \nof program expansion for women's athletics. (Op. 2227.) \n \nUCD concedes that the Court properly articulated the standards (PFR 1-2), but claims that it went awry by focusing on \nthe number of athletes rather than the number of participation opportunities when it considered and rejected UCD's \nclaim that the addition of a new indoor track team was evidence of program expansion. As UCD acknowledges, \nhowever, this argument presupposes that a new team was actually added. (PFR 2 (“[i]f a new team is added, the op-\nportunities created by that addition count toward Option Two compliance”).) But the issue on this factual record was \nwhether a new team was created or whether, as in Cohen v. Brown Univ. (Cohen I), 809 F. Supp. 978, 991 (R.I. 1992), \naff'd, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1993), UCD was improperly attempting to claim credit for a team, and thus participation \nopportunities, that did not exist. The issue was not, as UCD attempts to cast it now, how to count participation op-\nportunities if there are in fact two teams. And it certainly was not, as amici would have this Court believe, a pro-\nnouncement that an institution can never double count athletes for purposes of compliance with Title IX's participation \nrequirements. \n \nThe issue actually presented in UCD's petition, therefore, is not the appropriate legal standard to employ, but how that \nstandard applies to the facts in the summary judgment record. Equally important is which version of the facts controls. \nWhile UCD clearly wants the Court to accept its version of the facts that it “added” an indoor track team and therefore \n“added” participation opportunities (as is apparent from its improper recitation of its version of the facts both in its \nAnswering Brief on the merits and again in the petition), the operative facts are those in which all reasonable infe-\nrences favor Plaintiffs, the non-moving party. \n \nWhat's more, UCD does not even attempt to argue that the grounds it raises here would change the outcome of this \nCourt's decision. That is, even if the Court gave UCD “credit” for adding indoor track, that finding would not alter the \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 4 \nultimate conclusion that UCD failed to meet its burden on summary judgment. \n \nThe other arguments that UCD raises similarly do not justify review of the panel decision. Its claim that the decision \nconflates two parts of the three-part test is simply incorrect. Its claim that the addition of golf should be viewed as \nresponsive to female student interest is another factual inquiry that does not raise a legal issue for this Court's recon-\nsideration. \n \nTo the extent that UCD believes it has additional facts it can raise on its behalf at trial, nothing in the Court's decision \nprecludes it from doing so. En banc review, however, should be reserved for fully developed legal conflicts, not the \nuniquely factual question this Court considered and addressed in its decision. \n \nPlaintiffs are entitled to their day in court without further delay. The petition should be denied. \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. THE COURT'S APPLICATION OF ESTABLISHED TITLE IX STANDARDS TO THIS FACT INTENSIVE \nRECORD IS SOUND AND DOES NOT WARRANT EN BANC REVIEW. \n \nA. UCD Fails to Demonstrate the Extraordinary Circumstances that Call for En Banc Review. \n \nUCD has not and cannot demonstrate that: (1) consideration by the full court is necessary to secure or maintain un-\niformity of the court's decisions, or (2) the proceeding involves a question of exceptional importance. Fed. R. App. P. \n35(a) & (b); 9th Cir. R. 35-1; United States v. Hardesty, 977 F.2d 1347, 1348 (9th Cir. 1992) (en banc). \n \nUCD concedes, as it must, that there is no conflict whatsoever between the panel *4 decision and any other appellate \ncourt decision. Instead, it claims that the panel decision “contradicts” two district court decisions and agency regula-\ntions interpreting certain Title IX standards and therefore presents “an issue of exceptional importance.” (PFR 1, 2.) \nNot only does UCD's argument reach well beyond circumstances where en banc review would be warranted, but it \nstarts with the faulty premise that the panel decision conflicts with any published statutory, regulatory or other law \nconstruing the Title IX standards. There are no circumstances presented here that justify en banc review. \n \nB. The Court Properly Considered and Ruled on UCD's Alternative Grounds for Summary Judgment. \n \nThroughout its petition, UCD repeatedly suggests that it was inappropriate for the Court to consider and address \nwhether UCD was entitled to summary judgment on the basis that it was in compliance with Option Two, claiming \nthat the Court did not have the benefit of “plenary briefing.” (PFR 1, 14.) But in its Answering Brief, UCD itself urged \nthat the Court affirm summary judgment on the alternate ground that it complied with Option Two. (Appellees' \nAnswering Brief (“AAB”) 60.) In fact, although it sought supplemental briefing, UCD argued that it was in com-\npliance with Option Two and also stated that “there is sufficient evidence in the record on which this Court may affirm \nthe District Court's judgment in favor of Defendants other than on the notice issue.” (Id.) There is no credible dispute \nthat the Court had the authority to consider and address UCD's alternative ground for summary judgment.[FN1] \n \nFN1. Interestingly, UCD urged the Court on appeal to consider an issue - qualified immunity - that it was \nforced to concede neither party had the opportunity to brief in the district court. (See AAB 29,32-33.) \n \nMoreover, the matter was fully briefed (with a factual record of over 5,000 pages) in the court below. Thus, this Court \nhad the benefit of a complete factual and legal record on this issue as well as additional briefing on appeal. After a \ncareful review, the Court held that UCD was not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground that it *5 \ncomplied with Option Two of the three-part test. (Op. 2227.) As demonstrated below, that conclusion was correct and \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 5 \nin no way warrants rehearing. \n \nC. The Court Properly Considered and Did Not Credit UCD's Claim on Summary Judgment that It Had “Added” an \nIndoor Track Team. \n \nUCD's primary contention is that the Court, in discussing and applying Option Two of the three-part test to measure \neffective athletic accommodation, “made statements regarding how Title IX compliance is measured that disturb \nsettled law and conflict with authoritative agency interpretations of Title IX.” (PFR 1.) The Court did no such thing. It \nthoughtfully and correctly applied the law to a full factual record presented to this Court on the de novo review of a \nsummary judgment order. \n \nUCD's argument is based primarily on this passage: \nUCD represents that it created another women's varsity team, indoor track, in 1999. The addition of indoor track, \nhowever, cannot be considered evidence of program expansion. It did nothing to expand the number of female athletes, \nas all the women participating in indoor track also participated in an existing varsity sport. See Cohen v. Brown Univ., \n809 F.Supp. 978, 991 (R.I. 1992), aff'd, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1993) (dismissing the alleged addition of winter track as \n“a sport that merely involved providing indoor space to the existing women's track team”). \n \n(Op. 2229.) UCD claims that this language is a departure from settled law because it suggests that a school cannot \ncount students who participate on two teams as separate participation opportunities for purposes of Title IX. Amici, \nthe NCAA and a selection of colleges, take this one step further and argue that the decision lays down a rule of law that \na university can never double count athletes (i.e., count an athlete who participates on two teams as two participation \nopportunities rather than one) for the purpose of determining compliance with Title IX's participation test. \n \nBut the Court's statement - made as part of a comprehensive Option Two analysis - does nothing of the sort. As the \ndense factual record demonstrates, the issue with respect to indoor track was not whether to count twice a student who \nparticipated in track and another team, but whether UCD in fact had an indoor track team, that offered any *6 addi-\ntional participation opportunities. \n \nIn order to fully understand the Court's statement, a review of its complete analysis is necessary. Tellingly, there is no \ndispute between the parties, or the parties and the Court, about the appropriate analysis for an effective accommoda-\ntion violation under Title IX. The Title IX regulations require institutions to “provide equal athletic opportunity for \nmembers of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). (Addendum to Appellants' Opening Brief (“AD”) 4.) The critical \naspect of that requirement in this case is “[w]hether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively ac-\ncommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1). (AD 4.) \n \nWhether an institution has met its “effective accommodation” duty is determined using a three-part test drawn from \nthe Department of Education's 1979 Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 et seq. (1979) (the “Policy Interpre-\ntation”) (AD 6-16), which is further explained in a 1996 Clarification (AD 17-29). The test provides institutions three \noptions for demonstrating compliance with Title IX. In the district court and in this Court, UCD claimed to have \nsatisfied Option Two by proving that it has a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demon-\nstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of its female students. \n \nThe Court accurately set forth the legal framework in its decision. (Op. 2218-22.) Citing the 1996 Clarification, this \nCourt noted that the focus is “on whether an institution has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation \nopportunities for women,” but provides institutions “flexibility” in choosing which teams are added,” and that the \nnumber of “participation opportunities” for women “is defined by the number of female athletes actually playing \nintercollegiate sports.” (Op. 2221.) That is, it is the number of actual “participation opportunities” that is key. All \ncircuit courts discussing the legal standard for Option Two are in accord. See Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 \nF.2d 824, 828 (10th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted); Neal v. Bd. of Trs., 198 F.3d 763, 767-68 (9th Cir. 1999); Cohen v. \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 6 \nBrown Univ. (Cohen II), 991 F.2d 888, 897-98 (1st Cir. 1993). \n \n*7 In assessing compliance with Option Two, the Court followed the 1996 Clarification - which UCD agrees is con-\ntrolling - and reviewed both UCD's history “of adding female participation opportunities” and its “current ‘plan of \nprogram expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities' of women.” (Op. 2227.) It \nalso specifically considered and applied the factors identified in the Clarification for Option Two: UCD's record of \nadding women's intercollegiate teams; UCD's record of increasing the number of women participants on intercolle-\ngiate teams; and UCD's affirmative responses to requests by students or others for the addition or elevation of sports. \n(Op. 2227-28.) \n \nIt was in this context that the Court considered - and rejected - UCD's claim that it had offered undisputed facts on \nsummary judgment providing that it created a women's indoor track team in 1999. The record supports that finding. \nFirst, UCD's athletics personnel offered contradictory statements about when, and if, indoor track was added. (See, e.g., \nER 4289:2-13 (women's track coach believed indoor track season was added in 1994), 4302:6-21, 4305:20-25 (men's \ntrack coach testified that it was 1997), 4340:18-4341:2 (athletic director testified that it was 1997 or 1998).) \n \nSecond, UCD's own documents and testimony indicate that it treated indoor and outdoor track as one sport with an \nextended season. (ER 1208-09 ¶¶ 23-26, 2758-68, 4419:11-4424:5 (“they were saying that here at UC Davis, we treat \nit as kind of one budget, one sport”), 4306:9-10 (the season expansion was only approved if it did not require addi-\ntional funds).) UCD publicized one track schedule with indoor and outdoor meets combined, and UCD's media guides \ntreat indoor and outdoor track as one sport. (ER 4417:2-4418:2,2119-22; see also ER 2123-46.) UCD awarded only \none grant-in-aid per athlete to cover both the indoor and outdoor season. (ER 4415:10-15, 4416:10-13.) \n \nThird, UCD's facts at best demonstrated that the outdoor track season included some indoor track meets for some \nathletes because it increased the coaches' ability to *8 recruit athletes to the existing team and it was convenient, not \nbecause it increased athletic opportunities for women. (ER 4288:11-12, 4744:1-6, 1177-79 ¶ 120; see also ER \n4413:22-4414:1.) In fact, UCD conceded that it did not follow its formal process for adding indoor track. (ER \n4286:19-4289:1, 4289:17-22; see also ER 4304:17-4305:16, 4306:4-4307:7, 4308:4-4309:1,4438:15-4439:12.) In-\nstead, the coach asked the athletic director to add some indoor track meets to the outdoor track season for some ath-\nletes. (ER 4286:19-4289:22,4304:17-4305:16, 4306:4-4307:7, 4438:15-4439:12.) The athletic director agreed, on the \ncondition that any funding came from the already existing budget. (Id.) \n \nIt was upon this record, then, that the panel properly concluded that UCD's purported addition of indoor track “cannot \nbe considered evidence of program expansion” and cited to Cohen, noting that in that case, the district court dismissed \nthe alleged addition of winter track as “a sport that merely involved providing indoor space to the existing women's \ntrack team.” (Op. 2229.) Obviously, if indoor track was not a new team or new sport, it could not provide meaningful \nparticipation opportunities. (AD 24-26.) \n \nContrary to UCD's and amici's argument,[FN2] therefore, the decision does not announce a new or conflicting rule \nregarding duplicate counting. There simply was a factual dispute as to whether indoor track had been created as a new \nteam offering new participation opportunities for women at UCD. In the end, what UCD really takes issue with is not \na new rule of law, but the proper application of the law to the facts before the Court. This is precisely the type of issue \n- review of a factual record on summary judgment - that is not appropriate for en banc review. \n \nFN2. Amici simply restate UCD's argument. Amici also did not have the benefit of knowing any of the \nfactual record before submitting their brief. \n \nThis is particularly the case where, as here, UCD does not contend (nor could it) *9 that the Court's holding would be \nany different regardless of the outcome of any rehearing. The Court's statements with respect to indoor track were part \nand parcel of a comprehensive analysis of the entire history of UCD's athletics program as it pertains to participation \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 7 \nopportunities for women. Even if UCD were to get “credit” for the addition of indoor track, the factual record on \nsummary judgment was that UCD still did not have a history of expanding opportunities. \n \nBetween 1998 and 2005, female enrollment at UCD went from 10,596 to 12,834, adding over 2,200 women to UCD. \n(See ER 1209 ¶ 27.) At the same time, 63 female participation opportunities were dropped at UCD, a drop that UCD's \nexpert conceded was “drastic.” (ER 1209 ¶¶ 27, 29.) By 2005, athletic participation for women, even including \nnumbers for indoor track, was at the lowest point since 1997. (ER 1209 ¶ 27, 1091:18-1092:2, 1961.) It was during this \ntime that UCD removed Plaintiffs from the wrestling team. These facts remain constant regardless of how this Court \ntreats indoor track. Because UCD eliminated opportunities at a time when its record was at best stagnant, even under \nUCD's version of the facts, it is not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of Title IX compliance. (Op. 2230-31.) \nSee AD 29 n.2; Barrett v. West Chester Univ. of Pa., 2003 WL 22803477, at *7 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (elimination of \nwomen's gymnastic team was evidence of non-compliance with part two); Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 897-98 (elimination of \nwomen's volleyball and gymnastic teams was evidence non-compliance with part two); Roberts, 998 F.2d at 828-30 \n(elimination of women's softball team was evidence of non-compliance with part two). \n \nFinally, UCD's claim that the decision improperly considers the relative percentages of females participating in ath-\nletics as compared to their undergraduate enrollment as part of the Option Two analysis fails. (PFR 13-14.) Although \nproportionality is the hallmark of the Option One test, it does not stand to reason that it is not relevant to the Option \nTwo inquiry. All three options in the three-part test have the same goal, that institutions provide equal participation \nopportunities to women. Option *10 One is essentially a statistical analysis: Does an institution provide athletic op-\nportunities for male and female students that are substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments? An \n“athletic opportunity” under Option One is necessarily the same as an “athletic opportunity” under Option Two. And \nthe 1996 Clarification specifically references the percentages of women participating in athletics as a measurement of \nOption Two compliance. (AD 25.) The Court properly considered the number of women students at UCD relative to \nthe number of athletic opportunities as a measure of UCD's program expansion. Surely if the number of women \nenrolled at UCD dropped off sharply, UCD would claim a lesser burden in expanding women's athletics. UCD's \nsuggestion to the contrary makes no sense. \n \nIn sum, the Court's decision does not set any higher or different bar for institutions seeking to comply with Title IX. An \ninstitution - and a court - must look at the athletic opportunities for women students overall, and must do so in the \ncontext of that particular institution's conduct. \n \nD. There Is No Conflict with Any Appellate Decision Regarding the Court's Application of Title IX Standards. \n \nUCD fails to identify a single appellate case that is at odds with the holding of this Court and would create an inter- or \nintra- circuit conflict justifying en banc review. Moreover, UCD ignores entirely the several circuit cases that discuss \nor apply the same Option Two legal analysis that the Court employs here. See Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, Pa., \n998 F.2d 168, 176 (3d Cir. 1993) (Title IX requires “continued affirmative steps” by institutions to achieve equity, \nwhich “ ‘ [i]n most cases ... will entail development of athletic programs that substantially expand opportunities for \nwomen to participate and compete at all levels' ” (quoting Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,414 (AD 7))); see \nalso Roberts, 998 F.2d at 828-30; Neal, 198 F.3d at 767-68; Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 897-98; Barrett, 2003 WL \n22803477, at *7. The only cases upon which UCD relies for its “conflict” argument are two district court cases pre-\nsenting entirely *11 different issues and facts than are present here. \n \nThe case of Miller v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2008 WL 203025 (S.D. Ohio 2008) is an unpublished district court case that \nconsidered whether a university was in compliance with Option One of the three-part test. The only evidence before \nthe court was the university's roster statistics. Plaintiffs argued that the university should be required to count an \nathlete only once regardless of how many different sports she plays. Id. at *7. The court disagreed. The court also \nrejected plaintiffs' argument that track and field should be counted as one sport, rather than broken out into separate \nsports. Because plaintiffs offered no evidence on this point, the court relied solely upon statements from the De-\npartment of Education, rather than any evidence specific to any circumstances at the university, to reach its conclusion. \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \nId. \n \nIn Biediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 616 F. Supp. 2d 277 (D. Conn. 2009), the court made no finding regarding duplicated \ncounting. In dicta, it noted that plaintiffs did “not appear likely to prevail” in the argument that the university cannot \nuse duplicated counting. As in Miller, the court did not look to any evidence specific to the university's program but \ninstead made generalized statements that indoor track, outdoor track, and cross-country are different sports. Id. at 295. \n \nThe difference between these cases and the case here underscores the intensely factual nature of inquiry. As the 1996 \nClarification explains, the goal of the three-part test is to ensure that an institution complies with Title IX by providing \nmeaningful athletic participation opportunities to women. (See AD 29 n.2.) Whether or not a team was actually added, \nand opportunities actually provided, is plainly a question of fact that will vary by institution. See, e.g., AD 24-26; \nCohen I, 809 F. Supp. at 981-82. \n \nE. The Court Properly Considered and Rejected UCD's Claim on Summary Judgment that the Addition of Golf Was \nResponsive to the Developing Interests of Female Students. \n \nUCD tries to foment yet another “conflict” to entice en banc review by claiming that the Court improperly discounted \nUCD's addition of its women's golf team in 2003. *12 As with its indoor track argument however, the full record \ndiscloses that there was a factual dispute as to whether the addition of golf was, as Title IX requires, demonstrably \nresponsive to the developing interests of female students. UCD was not entitled to the inference it seeks. \n \nThe 1996 Clarification states that the focus of an Option Two analysis “is on whether the program expansion was \nresponsive to developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.” (AD 24.) UCD argues that the Court \nconstrued “developing interests” too narrowly to include only interests that already existed at UCD, instead of also \nconsidering UCD's evidence that golf was popular among high school students and had competition among other \nuniversities and an NCAA championship. (PFR 11-12.) UCD also claims that the Court improperly looked at the small \nsize of the golf team in considering UCD's current plan of expansion. Neither contention is correct. \n \nAgain, the facts are instructive, and dispositive. In determining whether the addition of golf was demonstrably res-\nponsive to student interest, the Court noted the following: UCD had a process for adding varsity teams that is con-\nsistent with what the Title IX regulations and agency interpretations suggest is necessary. (Op. 2231.)[FN3] In 2003, it \nreceived, pursuant to that process, applications from four women's club sport teams seeking elevation to varsity status, \nincluding field hockey, which had also sought but was denied varsity status in 1995. Field hockey's application in 2003 \nwas again denied, even though in 1995 UCD's Title IX advisory group had noted that field hockey had “strong interest \nfrom students,” was “a relatively strong NCAA sport,” and was “a prime candidate for addition to the ICA program in \nthe future.” (Op. 2232.) In fact, UCD rejected all club sport applications and instead picked golf, for which there was \nno club sport team and no student request for varsity status, at the behest of the men's golf *13 coach. (Id.) In addition, \ngolf added only seven opportunities for women athletes, whereas any of the other pre-existing club teams that applied \nfor varsity status would have added considerably more participation opportunities. (ER 1208 ¶ 22, 1212 ¶40.)[FN4] \n \nFN3. UCD touted that process as being responsive to student interest because it involved having students \nsubmit applications for varsity status. (See ER 1177 ¶ 118,1179 ¶ 122.) \n \nFN4. The golf application was completed by the UCD administration. (ER 1211 ¶ 39.) A full year of \noff-campus recruitment was required before UCD could field a golf team. (ER 1211 ¶¶ 38-39.) Although \nUCD claimed that golf was selected to comply with a Big West Conference rule, that selection criterion was \nnever communicated to applicants for varsity status. (ER 1211 ¶ 38.) UCD admitted that it deviated from its \nselection criteria for new sports when it added golf. (ER 1177-79 ¶ 122.) \n \nThe Court correctly applied the law to these facts in determining that UCD failed to demonstrate that the addition of \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 9 \ngolf was demonstrably responsive to student interest. As an initial matter, UCD relies upon language regarding “de-\nveloping interests” in the agency interpretation that addresses the third part of the three-part test, not Option Two. \n(PFR at 11; AD 27.) Moreover, the Court properly recognized that current student interest is one, but not the only, \nfactor to consider in addressing an institution's responsiveness to allow institutions flexibility in their approach. (AD \n24-26.) This Court, in fact, considered those factors. It found that although universities are free to consider applica-\ntions from individuals other than students and to evaluate high school as well as current student interest, the fact that \nthere was no student interest in varsity (or even club) golf at a time when there was significant interest in several other \nsports suggested that adding golf was not a response to female student interest. (Op. 2232.) The Court noted the small \nnumber of opportunities added by golf only in light of UCD's stated priority of improving gender equity through its \nvarsity elevation process, not as an independent test of Option Two compliance. (Op. 2231, 2233.) \n \nIn contrast to the factually sensitive inquiry in which the Court engaged, UCD asks for rehearing to establish bright \nline rules that a court in addressing Option Two compliance: (1) cannot place “undue emphasis” (whatever that means) \non current student interest; and (2) cannot consider the number of participation opportunities *14 provided by the \naddition of a sport. (PFR 12.) Such legal rulings would only impede the accurate assessment of whether an institution's \nprogram expansion is “responsive to developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.” (AD 24.)[FN5] \n \nFN5. UCD quotes the letter that accompanied the 1996 Clarification to stress that flexibility is required, but \ntellingly leaves out the statement that these issues are “inherently case-and fact-specific.” (PFR 13; AD 18.) \n \nMoreover, as with UCD's indoor track issue, rehearing or review of the Court's treatment of golf would not yield a \ndifferent holding. Nor would it have any legal significance beyond this case. The summary judgment record discloses \nthat between 1976 and 1995, UCD dropped two women's sports and added only one (ER 1207-1208 ¶¶ 17-20, 1276 ¶ \n116), thus failing to demonstrate a history of program expansion. Although UCD expanded opportunities for women \nin 1995, it then waited ten more years before adding golf during which time women's wrestling was cut, thus failing to \ndemonstrate a history or continuing practice of program expansion. (See AD 26; see also ER 3246:3-3247:4 & \n3436:4-17 (both parties' Title IX experts agree that an institution must add participation opportunities every two to \nthree years).) Thus even if UCD is given “credit” for adding golf, the Court's holding that UCD failed to present \nundisputed facts to compel summary judgment in its favor would remain unchanged. \n \nII. UCD IS LIKEWISE NOT ENTITLED TO PANEL REHEARING. \n \nPanel rehearing is also not warranted by any of the issues raised by UCD. As demonstrated above, the Court's legal \nanalysis was correct. To the extent that UCD is arguing that panel rehearing is justified because material facts were \noverlooked (PFR 14-16), UCD fails to appreciate that it is not entitled to this Court's consideration of the version of \nfacts favoring UCD on review of a summary judgment motion. All of its arguments cannot prevail against that stan-\ndard. \n \nIts argument that the Court fails to “mention important undisputed summary judgment evidence” is of no moment. \n(PFR 14.) Similarly, its claim that the decision is *15 internally inconsistent because it views the EADA reports dif-\nferently for Option One and for Option Two is without merit. (PFR 15.) UCD conceded that it was not in compliance \nwith Title IX by using Option One. (AAB 15-16 & n.8, 58.) That UCD listed indoor track on its EADA reports, in any \nevent, simply begs the question in light of the full factual record as to whether UCD added indoor track as a new sport. \n \nUCD invited the Court to affirm on the alternative ground that, as a matter of law, it complied with Option Two of the \nthree-part test. The Court properly found that the “record before us does not contain undisputed facts showing a history \nand continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to women's interests.” (Op. 2233.) UCD is not entitled \nto rehearing because it is unhappy with that result. \n \nCONCLUSION \n\n2010 WL 1232004 (C.A.9)   Page 10 \n \nPlaintiffs filed this case more than seven years ago. This panel correctly concluded that the case must be remanded for \ntrial, a holding that UCD does not contest. Dissatisfied with the result it obtained, UCD now seeks a second bite of the \napple by claiming that the Court issued a new and conflicting rule of law. But UCD has failed to identify any basis for \nen banc review or for panel rehearing. Its petition should be denied. \n \n \nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs/Appellants, v.

Plaintiffs,  three  former  and  one  current \n4  undergraduate  students  at  U.c.  Davis  have  sued  the  REGENTS  OF  THE  UNIVERSITY  OF \n5  CALIFORNIA (\"UNIVERSITY\"); the Chancellor ofU.C. Davis, the U.C. Davis Athletic Director and \n6  two Assistant Athletic Directors, and a former Associate Vice Chancellor.  They assert the following \n7  claims for relief: \n8  I.  Violation of Title IX in regard to equal athletic participation opportunities.  This claim is \n9  asserted  only  against  the  UNIVERSITY.  Plaintiffs  MANSOURIAN  and  MANCUSO,  who  are \n10  described in the Complaint as the \"class plaintiffs\" (Exhibit A, Complaint, ~ 107) assert this claim on \n11  behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated under F.R.C.P. 23(a) and (b)(2). Plaintiffs NG and \n12  CHIANG assert this claim on behalf of themselves only.  Plaintiffs contend that \"they and all present \n13  and future female students at U.C.  Davis should have equal access and opportunity to receive these \n14  same  benefits  that  male  students  at  U.C.  Davis  already  have,  including  athletic  participation \n15  opportunities in wrestling.\"  (Exhibit A, ~ 127) \n2.  Violation  of Title  IX in regard  to  equal  athletic  financial  assistance.  This  claim  is \n16 \n17  asserted against the UNIVERSITY only.  MANSOURIAN and MANCUSO assert this claim on behalf \n18  of the putative class, while Plaintiffs NG and CHIANG assert it only on behalf of themselves.  Plaintiffs \n19  contend that \"they and all present and future female students at U.C. Davis should have equal access to \n20  athletic scholarship funding and  should receive the same benefits that male students at U.C.  Davis \n21  already have, including athletic scholarships for wrestling.\" (Exhibit A, ~ 138) \n3.  Retaliation in violation of Title IX.  This claim is asserted against the UNIVERSITY \n22 \n23  only and is not alleged on behalf of any putative class. \n4.  Violation of 42 U.S.C. section 1983 for alleged discrimination on the basis of gender in \n24 \nregard  to  athletic  participation opportunities,  financial  assistance,  and wrestling opportunities.  This \n25 \nclaim is  asserted against the UNIVERSITY but only for injunctive relief, and against all individual \n26 \nDefendants.  MANSOURIAN and MANCUSO assert this claim on behalf of the putative class, while \n27 \nPlaintiffs NG and CHIANG assert it only on behalf of themselves. \n28 \n1 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 7 of 42\n1  5.  Violation  of the  California  Unruh  Civil  Rights  Act.  This  claim  is  brought  by \nMANSOURIAN and MANCUSO on behalf of the putative class and by the remaining Plaintiffs on \n2 \n3  behalf of themselves.  It is asserted against all Defendants.  Plaintiffs contend they were denied equal \n4  opportunities in athletic participation, financial assistance, and opportunities to participate in wrestling. \n5  6.  The sixth claim for relief is entitled \"California Public Policy.\"  It is asserted against all \n6  Defendants by MANSOURIAN and MANCUSO on behalf of the putative class and by the remaining \n7  Plaintiffs on behalf of themselves.  Relying on various sections of the California Education Code and \n8  two portions of the California Constitution, Plaintiffs contend they were denied equal opportunities in \n9  athletic participation, financial assistance, and opportunities to participate in wrestling. \nDefendants filed an answer denying Plaintiffs' claims and that they are entitled to damages or \n10 \n11  injunctive relief.  This case is set for trial on November 28, 2006.  Dispositive motions must be filed \nby June 30, 2006 and the final pre-trial conference is on September 29, 2006. \n12 \nBy way of their motion, Plaintiffs seeks certification of the following class: \n13 \n14  \"All current, prospective, and future female students at the University of \nCalifornia, Davis, who are denied, and all females who are deterred from \n15 \nenrolling  at  U.C.  Davis  because  they  would  be  denied,  an  equal \nopportunity  to  participate  in  varsity  intercollegiate  athletics  and/or  to \n16 \nreceive athletic financial assistance because of their sex.\" \n17 \n18  For the reasons set forth below, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' motion should be denied. \nII. \n19 \n20  FACTS PERTAINING TO CLASS CERTIFICATION MOTION \n21  A.  Intercollegiate athletics, sport clubs, and intramural sports at U.C.Davis \n22  U.C. Davis is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (N.C.A.A.) member institution.  It is a \n23  Division I( school in all intercollegiate sports except women's gynmastics and wrestling2  The campus \nis in the process of moving from Division II to  Division I,  a transition that should be completed by \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \nIn general, the status of an institution in a particular N.C.A.A. division depends on the number of teams sponsored by the \n1 \n28  institution.  There are also requirements regarding competition and scheduling, and the availability of athletic financial aid. \n2 See below.  Those sports have competed in Division I for over ten years. \n2 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 8 of 42\n1  February 2007.  This change was supported by a student referendum that was passed in 2002, known as \n2  Campus Expansion Initiative.  (Exhibit K, Declaration of GREG WA  RZEKCA, ~ 2) \n3  U.C. Davis sponsors 26 varsity (intercollegiate athletic) teams. The teams are: baseball, men's \n4  basketball, women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, football, men's golf, women's golf, \n5  women's gymnastics, women's lacrosse, women's rowing,  men's soccer,  women's soccer,  softball, \n6  men's and women's swimming and diving, men's tennis, women's tennis, men's and women's indoor \ntrack,  men's  and  women's  outdoor  track,  volleyball,  men's  water  polo,  women's  water  polo  and \n7 \n8  wrestling.  In total, there are twelve men's varsity sports and fourteen women's varsity sports.  (Exhibit \n9  K, ~ 3)  This is signifi.cantly more than the national average of 8.45 women's sports per college or \n10  university (See \"Women in Intercollegiate Sport: A Longitudinal, National Study Twenty Seven Year \nUpdate (1977-2006)\" by Linda Jean Carpenter and R. Vivian Acosta in conjunction with the National \n11 \nAssociation of Collegiate Women Athletic Administrators, Exhibit G). \n12 \n13  There are also many sport clubs at U .C. Davis.  The sport club program is designed to provide \nstudents with the opportunity to learn sports skills, develop an individual potential in a particular sport, \n14 \nbecome physically fit, engage in competition with teams from other colleges, universities and amateur \n15 \nclubs, and to engage in social interaction and leadership opportunities.  (Exhibit X, Declaration of Gary \n16 \n17  Colberg, ~ 4)  There are three levels of competition for  sport clubs.  Recreational teams focus  on \ninstruction and recreational  activities on campus.  Competitive  II  teams  travel and  compete against \n18 \nteams from other universities, colleges and amateur organizations.  Competitive I teams also travel and \n19 \ncompete against teams from  other universities, colleges and amateur organizations but in a format \n20 \nleading up to  a  national  championship.  There  are  national  championships  for  badminton,  cycling, \n21 \ngymnastics, horse polo, men's roller hockey,  women's soccer, men's and women's ultimate sports, \n22 \nmen's and women's volleyball and water skiing.  Most of the Competitive I and Competitive II club \n23 \nsports belong to a conference, compete within that conference, and follow that conference's rules. In a \n24 \n25  number of sports, the Competitive I club team is the equivalent to a junior varsity team.  (Exhibit X, ~ \n2) \n26 \nAny undergraduate student may participate in a club sport or submit an application to establish a \n27 \nclub sport. In general, the purpose of the club must be consistent with the sport club program; the club \n28 \n3 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 9 of 42\n1  must engage in sporting activity; there must be a minimum of ten students interested in participating in \n2  the  club;  suitable  facilities  must  be  available for  practice  and  competitions;  and  the  club  must be \n3  financially self-reliant.  There are some funds available for distribution to sport clubs, but the bulk of \n4  financial  support  for  each  club  sport  is  the  result  of fundraising.  The  sport  clubs  use  campus \n5  recreational facilities and may use University vehicles for  transportation to meets and tournaments. \n6  (Exhibit X, ~ 3; Exhibit Y, Criteria for starting club sport and application). \nThere are currently 35 active sport clubs on campus. An application has been submitted to add \n7 \njudo as a sport club this spring.  The current club sports are alpine skiing, badminton, baseball, boxing, \n8 \n9  Brazilian Ju Jitsu, men's crew, cycling, equestrian, fencing, field hockey, gymnastics, horse polo, men's \n10  ice hockey, kendo, kung fu, men's and women's lacrosse, racquetball, men's roller hockey, men's and \n11  women's rugby, men's and women's soccer, softball, squash, table tennis, tae kwon do, triathlon, men's \n12  and  women's ultimate,  men's and  women's  volleyball,  men's and  women's water  polo  and  water \n13  skiing.  Twenty-four of the teams are at the Competition I level; five are at the Competition II level; and \n14  six are at the recreational level.  The Competition I club sports include field hockey, horse polo and \n15  women's rugby.  There are 1,139 participants among the 35 active clubs.  (Exhibit X, ~ 4) \n16  There is also an extensive intramural sports program available to students.  For most intramural \n17  sports, there are a variety of leagues offered from \"AA\" to \"c\" for men's, women's and coed play. \n18  \"AA\"  teams  are  primarily  made  up  of  highly  skilled,  experienced  (intercollegiate,  club  and \n19  professional)  and  competitive team  members.  \"A\" teams  consist primarily of athletes  with  above \n20  average skills and a limited number of experienced members.  \"B\" teams are designed for the average \n21  athlete; no experienced players are permitted on the team.  \"c\" teams are for beginners in a sport. \n22  There are intramural teams for badminton, basketball (3-aside and 5-aside), flag football (4-aside, 7-\n23  aside  and  8-aside),  floor  hockey,  dodgeball,  grass  volleyball,  indoor soccer,  innertube  water  polo, \nkickball,  poker,  racquetball,  soccer  (9-aside  and  7-aside),  tennis,  table  tennis,  ultimate  frisbee, \n24 \n25  volleyball, and wiffleball.  For the university calendar year 2004-2005, there were 2528  intramural \n26  teams with a total of 12,961  unique intramural participants among the 22 sports offered.  (Exhibit H, \n27  Declaration of Laura Hall, ~ 2) \n28  U.C.  Davis  has  received  prominent  recognition  for  the  quality  of its  athletic  program  for \n4 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 10 of 42\n1  women.  In 1999 and 2000, it was named as the best Division II school for women athletes by Sports \n2  Illustrated for  Women.  U.c. Davis has produced no  less than three N.C.A.A.  Women of the  Year \n3  winners since that program started in 1991.  The Woman of the Year Award is given to senior student \n4  athletes  who  distinguish  themselves  in  the  area  of academic  achievement,  athletics,  service  and \n5  leadership.  U.C. Davis was the N.C.A.A. Division II champion in women's tennis in 1990 and 1993; in \n6  women's rowing in 2002  and 2003; and  in softball in 2003.  It has  produced N.C.A.A.  individual \nchampions in women's swimming (2003), women's indoor track (1996 and 2000), and diving (1996). \n7 \nSix  members of the women's gymnastics team have  won thirteen individual championships at  the \n8 \nU.S.A.G. Collegiate National championships.  Eleven U.c. Davis women's teams have participated in, \n9 \n10  or been represented at,  fifty-nine N.C.A.A. Division II  championships and one N.C.A.A. Division I \nchampionship since 1995.  Between 1995 and 2005, U.C. Davis female student-athletes received a total \n11 \n12  of 253  All-American awards.  This status is  determined either by order of finishing in the national \nchampionships or via selection by coaches, media or another organization.  (Exhibit I, Declaration of \n13 \n14  Mike Robles, ~ 2) \nThe  N.C.A.A.  sponsors  the  following  sports  for  men:  baseball,  basketball,  cross  country, \n15 \nfencing, football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, indoor \n16 \ntrack, outdoor track, volleyball, water polo and wrestling.  It sponsors the following sports for women: \nl7 \nbasketball, bowling, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, rifle, \n18 \nrowing,  skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, indoor track,  outdoor track, volleyball and water \n19 \npolo.  It  also  sponsors mixed gender teams  for  fencing  and rifle.  The N.C.A.A. does not  sponsor \n20 \n21  women's wrestling as  a separate sport.  (Exhibit J,  Declaration of Wendy Walters, ~ 3)  All of the \n22  varsity sports sponsored by U.C. Davis are N.C.A.A. sponsored sports.  (Exhibit K, ~ 3). \nThe change from Division II status to Division I status will also include a change in Conference \n23 \nmembership for U.C. Davis.  It will become a full member of the Big West Conference in July 2007 \n24 \nafter it obtains Division I status.  The Big West Conference covers men's and women's basketball, \n25 \nbaseball, women's volleyball, softball, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's cross country, \n26 \nmen's and women's swimming and diving, men's and women's golf, men's and women's tennis and \n27 \nmen's  and  women's  track  and  field.  The  remaining  U.C.  Davis  teams  compete  in  various  other \n28 \n5 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 11 of 42\n1  conferences.  (Exhibit K, ~ 4) \n2  B.  The V.c. Davis wrestling team \n3  In 1993, V.C. Davis made the decision to have its women's gymnastics team and the wrestling \n4  team compete in Division I rather than Division II because of lack of available competition in Division \n5  II schools in this geographic area.  (Exhibit L, Declaration of Michelle Roppeau, ~ 4)  The V.C. Davis \n6  wrestling team competes in the Pac-IO conference. (Exhibit M, Declaration of LARRY SW ANSON, ~ \n7  3) \n8  Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. section 106.41, an educational institution that receives federal funds may \n9  operate separate teams for members of each sex where selection for inclusion on the team is based on \n10  competitive skill or the sport is a contact sport.  Contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice \n11  hockey, football, basketball and any other sports that have a purpose or major activity that involves \n12  bodily contact.  If a school has a team for members of one sex but not the other, and opportunities for \n13  the  latter sex to participate in athletics have previously been limited, members of that sex must be \n14  allowed to tryout for the team unless it is a contact sport.  There is no requirement that the students be \n15  placed on the team-they simply must be given a chance to try out, unless the sport is a contact sport. \n16  Although wrestling is considered a contact sport under this regulation, for a number of years U.C. Davis \n17  has permitted women to try out for the team.  (Exhibit M, ~ 2).  If, in the opinion of the head coach, a \n18  woman has the necessary skills and abilities to earn a spot on the team, she will be given one.  Selection \n19  of members of the team on any varsity sport is the prerogative of the head coach. \n20  The V.C. Davis wrestling team is counted as a men's sport for purposes of compliance with \n21  N.C.A.A. regulations.  (Exhibit M, ~ 2)  There has never been a women's varsity wrestling team at V.C. \n22  Davis.  To the knowledge of the Associate Athletic Director who oversees the sport of wrestling, none \n23  of the schools in the Pac-lO have a women's varsity wrestling team.  (Exhibit M, ~ 3) \n24  During the time that Michael Burch was the head wrestling coach at V.C. Davis (l995-June, \n25  2001) he allowed women to work out with the team and to be part of the team, even though they did not \n26  have to tryout or compete for a place on the roster (see subsection F, below).  In 1998, V.C. Davis \n27  instituted a roster management program designed to limit the number of team members in men's sports. \n28  This was done in order to comply with the requirements of Title IX and for budgetary reasons.  The \n6 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 12 of 42\nAthletic  Director  gave  the  head  coaches  of the  men's  teams  some  time  to  adjust  to  the  roster \n1 \nmanagement program, but by the fall of 2000 was requiring compliance with the upper limits assigned \n2 \nto each team.  The wrestling team was limited to 30 members on its roster.  Burch petitioned Athletic \n3 \nDirector  WA  RZECKA  to  add  four  more  spots.  His  request  was  granted.  Burch  filled  all  of the \n4 \nadditional  spots  with  men.  (Exhibit F,  deposition of Mike  Burch,  p.  308:12-p.309:5; p.  310:2-21); \n5 \nExhibit CC , e-mail from Burch to W ARZEKCA)  The issue of what Burch did, or did not do, with the \n6 \nstatus of the women wrestlers after that is a key issue in the case of Burch v. Regents, et. aI., which is \n7 \npending before Judge Shubb.  Defendants in that case (who are the same as the Defendants in this case) \n8 \ncontend Burch wrongfully told the women wrestlers the Athletic Department administration did not \n9 \nwant them on the team, when the truth was that Burch did not want to allot any of his limited roster \n10 \nspots to the women because he knew they did not have the skills necessary to compete at the varsity \n11 \nlevel.  Burch's actions came to light in May 2001 when NG and MANSaURIAN filed a complaint with \n12 \nthe affice for Civil Rights. After conducting an investigation and working with a.C.R., the campus \n13 \nagreed to reinstate the women to the wrestling team for what remained of the 2000/2001 season and set \n14 \nforth criteria for selection for membership on the team for all candidates in the future. Consistent with \n15 \nthe past practice, students of both genders may try out for the team.  The head coach retains the sale \n16 \ndiscretion to  select those who are most qualified for a place on the team.  a.C.R. approved of this \n17 \napproach.3  (Exhibit HH, Letter from a.C.R.) \n18 \nIn the spring of 2000, Assistant Athletic Director GILL-FISHER had spoken with some of the \n19 \nwomen wrestlers and asked them if they were interested in forming a women's wrestling club team so \n20 \nthat they could actually spar against and compete against other women, rather than being a small, non \n21 \ncompetitive part of the primarily male wrestling team.  Their response was to eschew the offer because \n22 \na, \n23  they claimed they were \"varsity athletes\".  (Exhibit  Declaration of PAM GILL-FISHER, ~ 4) \nIII \n24 \nIII \n25 \n26 \n27 \n3  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that O.C.R. found that U.C. Davis had discriminated against them on the basis of \n28  gender.  This allegation is reiterated in the declaration submitted by MANSOURIAN in support ofthis motion.  At a recent \nhearing on an issue pertaining to discovery from the O.CR., Plaintiffs' counsel admitted that no such finding had ever been \nmade.  See Defendants' objections to evidence submitted by Plaintiffs. \n7 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 13 of 42\n1  C.  Process for consideration of club sports for varsity status \nThe Intercollegiate Athletics program is funded to a large degree by student fees as authorized \n2 \n3  by various campus initiatives.  The  Athletic  Director,  in conjunction with the  Vice  Chancellor for \nStudent Affairs, has the authority to consider the addition of a new varsity sport if there is sufficient \n4 \nroom in the budget to fund the sport. (Exhibit K,  7) Money is always an issue. When W ARZECKA \n5  ~~5, \nbecame the Athletic Director in 1995, the Athletic Department budget was in a deep deficit.  It took \n6 \nuntil 2003 to eliminate the deficit.  The budget for 2005/2006 is approximately $150,000.00 in the red. \n7 \nIn considering whether to add a new varsity sport, one of the factors taken into account is the budget. \n8 \nUnfortunately, there has never been enough money in the budget to field a team in every sport that a \n9 \n10  student or group of students might be interested in.  (Exhibit K, ~ 5) \nU.C. Davis has a detailed procedure that is followed when proposals for the addition of new \n11 \nvarsity sports are made.  This process is specific to adding new women's varsity sports; there have not \n12 \nbeen any newly added men's teams in many years.  The club sport or organization seeking elevation to \n13 \nvarsity  status  must  prepare  a  written  proposal.  It is  the  responsibility  of those  students  who  are \n14 \ninterested in having a sport considered for elevation to take the time and effort to prepare the proposal \n15 \nor request that another person prepare it for them, and complete the entire review process.  After the \n16 \nproposals are received, the Athletic Director or his designee meets with the  sport representative.  A \n17 \ncommittee comprised of representatives from  the Athletic Administrative Advisory Committee, the \n18 \nStudent Athletic Advisory Committee, the Sports Club Council and the Athletic Administration reviews \n19 \nthe proposals and makes a recommendation to the Athletic Director.  The Athletic Director then makes \n20 \na recommendation to the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs.  The recommendation is also reviewed \n21 \n22  by the campus Title IX workgroup.  (Exhibit K, ~ 6) \nIn 1995, a call was made to add new varsity sports for women.  Proposals were submitted for \n23 \nwater polo, crew, badminton, lacrosse and field hockey. There was no proposal submitted on behalf of \n24 \nwomen's  wrestling.  After going  through the  review process,  the  decision was  made  to  add  crew, \n25 \nlacrosse and water polo, all of which had long histories as a club sport on campus and a solid source of \n26 \ncompetition from other schools within the geographic area.  (Exhibit K,  7)  In 2003, another call was \n27  ~ \nmade for proposals to consider adding new women's varsity sports.  Five women's sports submitted \n28 \n8 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 14 of 42\n1  proposals: bowling, field hockey, golf, horse polo and rugby.  Neither the Plaintiffs nor anyone else \n2  submitted a proposal on behalf of women's wrestling.  (Exhibit 0, ~ 2;  Exhibit DD,  Proposals for \n3  Elevation to  Varsity Status).  The Committee prepared a review and summary of the proposals and \n4  submitted  it  to  the  Athletic  Director.  (Exhibit  0, ~ 3;  Exhibit  EE,  Report  to  Athletic  Direc.) \n5  WARZECKA recommended to the Vice Chancellor that women's golf be added as a new varsity sport. \n6  The reasons he recommended golf over the other sports proposed were that golf is a championship sport \nin the Big West Conference and per Conference rules, U.C.  Davis is required to add sports that are \n7 \n8  already part of that conference before adding non-conference sports; women's golf is offered by 451 \n9  universities,  27  community  colleges,  and  639  California  high  schools;  the  N.C.A.A.  has  a  golf \n10  championship in all three divisions;  U.C.  Davis received  many  inquiries from  female  high school \n11  students who are interested in golf; and the local community had indicated a strong support of golf, \n12  including use of a golf course.  (Exhibit K,  ~ 7;  Exhibit FF,  Recommendation to Vice Chancellor). \n13  Women's golf was added as a varsity sport with competition starting in the 2005/2006 school year. \n14  D.  Interest in wrestling at the high school and collegiate level \nThe  National  Federation  of State  High  School  Associations  the  national  servICe  and \n15  IS \n16  administrative organization for  high school  athletics  (see  www.nfhs.org).  Each  year it conducts a \nnationwide survey of the participation levels in sports at the high school level.  In 2002,  3,405 high \n17 \nschool girls participated in wrestling.  The number of participants in that sport was much lower than \n18 \nother girls' high school sports, such as basketball (456,169), volleyball (395,124) or even field hockey \n19 \n(60,737) which was rated tenth out of ten of the top sports for girls that year.  (Exhibit 0, NFSHSA \n20 \n2002 Survey Results)  In 2004, the number of girls participating in wrestling nationwide increased to \n21 \n4,334 but it still lagged far behind the tenth out of ten most popular sports for that year, which was golf \n22 \n(64,245).  Girls' wrestling never came close to breaking into the top ten most popular sports.  (Exhibit \n23 \nR, NFSHSA 2004 Survey Results) \n24 \nThe California Interscholastic Federation (C.I.F.) gathers participation numbers for high school \n25 \nstudents in the state of California, which is where the vast majority of students who attend U.C. Davis \n26 \nlive.  During the 2004/2005 school year, there were  1,230 girls who participated in wrestling in this \n27 \nstate.  (Exhibit  S,  C.I.F.  Survey)  That  number  was  exceeded by  the  number of girls  who  played \n28 \n9 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 15 of 42\n1  badminton  (4,500),  golf (5,972)  and  most  other  sports,  which  had  participation  numbers  111  the \n2  thousands or tens of thousands. \n3  During the time  Burch coached the  wrestling team, there  were never more  than five  or six \n4  female students who expressed an interest in wrestling.  Lennie Zalesky took over as the head wrestling \n5  coach in the fall of 200 1.  In the four and a half years that he has held that position he has received only \n6  somewhere between five to ten inquiries from  female  students, both at the high school and college \n7  level, regarding participation in the wrestling program.  (Exhibit N, Declaration of Lennie Zalesky, ~ \n8  7) \n9  The number of women participating in wrestling at the collegiate level is very small, compared \n10  to other sports.  The N.C.A.A. does not sponsor women's wrestling as a separate sport.  There are a few \n11  schools that have women's teams, such as Menlo College, but those wrestlers compete primarily in \n12  open tournanlents or with teanlS in Canada.  (Exhibit T, Deposition of Lee Allen, p. 48: 1-17; p. 72: 10-\n13  17;  Exhibit V,  Menlo College team schedule.)  The participation numbers for  women in N.C.A.A. \n14  sponsored sports that are not currently varsity sports at U.C. Davis are notably larger than the number \n15  of women who wrestle at the college level.  In short, Plaintiffs are attempting to force the campus to \n16  establish a varsity program for a sport that has very little interest among its students. \n17  The limited nature of interest in women's wrestling at the collegiate varsity level, as compared \n18  to other sports, is also reflected by the fact that it is not even considered an \"emerging sport\" by the \n19  N.C.A.A.  That entity has identified certain sports for women as \"emerging sports\".  In order to be \nconsidered an \"emerging sport\", the sport must meet the following criteria: (I) the activity must be \n20 \ndefined as a sport and there must be regularly scheduled head to head competition within a defined \n21 \ncompetitive season and standardized rules ratified by regulatory agencies; (2) there must be twenty or \n22 \nmore varsity teams and/or competitive club teams that currently exist on college campuses in the sport; \n23 \n(3)  data  must  exist  that  demonstrates  support  for  the  sport;  (4)  there  must  be  a  demonstrated \n24 \nunderstanding by potential participant schools that if the sport is identified as an emerging sport, all \n25 \nN.C.A.A. member institutions will comply with that entity's regulations, and there must be a proposal \n26 \nsubmitted to the N.C.A.A. outlining suggestions for championship rules and a format for the sport; and \n27 \n(5)  ten  letters  of support  must  be  submitted  by  the  president  or  athletic  directors  from  member \n28 \n10 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 16 of 42\n1  institutions confirming they will sponsor the sport.  The women's sports that are currently identified as \n\"emerging\" are archery, badminton, equestrian (Division I and II only), rugby, squash, synchronized \n2 \n3  swinuning and team handball.  Women's wrestling has never been included on the list of emerging \n4  sports, nor has any organization (such as USA Wrestling) submitted a proposal requesting that it be \n5  considering as an emerging sport. (Exhibit J, , 4) \n6  E.  Plaintiffs \n1.  AREZOU MANSOURIAN \n7 \nMANSOURIAN started wrestling in her sophomore year in high school.  (Exhibit B, Deposition \n8 \n9  of MANSOURIAN, p. 66: 1-11).  She was on the junior varsity team, and was not required to engage in \n10  a wrestle-off' to secure a spot on the team, as was done for the varsity team.  (Exhibit B, p. 70:17-24; p. \n11  71:18-21)  Plaintiff entered U.C. Davis in the fall of 2000 and graduated in June 2004. (Exhibit B, p. \n12  22:24-p.23:6)  She  carried  a  full  load  of classes  throughout  the  time  she  was  in  attendance  and \n13  graduated in four years.  (Exhibit B, p. 119:9-13; p. 53: 1-6) \n14  Per MANSOURIAN,  Burch told her that  if she  attended U.C.  Davis  she  could  be  on  the \n15  wrestling team but would not have to compete against any males. (Exhibit B, p. 103:13-24) He did not \n16  encourage her to  develop  her skills  to  the  point where  she  could compete against  males,  nor did \n17  MANSOURIAN really have an interest in doing so.  (Exhibit B, p.  105:1-12)  Burch did not require \n18  MANSOURIAN to compete against any other wrestler to earn a spot on the team, nor was she required \n19  to compete with any other wrestler to determine who would be a starter in her weight class.  (Exhibit B, \n20  p. 147:8-16).  In Burch's opinion, none of the women had the strength or skills to compete with males. \n21  (Exhibit F, p. 218: 16-24; p. 372:22-24) \n22  During her first  year at  U.C.  Davis  (2000/2001),  MANSOURIAN observed only one  other \n23  female actively participating in wrestling - CHRISTINE NO.  She and NO sparred with each other at \n24  practices;  they  did  not  practice  with  the  men  on  the  team.  (Exhibit  B,  p.  139:1-p.140:1) \n25  MANSOURIAN and NO were never provided with team uniforms.  (Exhibit B, p. 144:8-11; Exhibit C, \n26  Deposition of NO, p. 127:19-22, p. 138:8-10)  MANSOURIAN did not compete in any of the matches \n27 \n28 \n4  A wrestle-off is a one on one competition between two wrestlers in the same weight class to determine who will make \nthe team. \n11 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 17 of 42\n1  or meets during the regular 2000/2001  season.  The only tournament she competed in was the Aggie \nOpen in January 2001.  MANSOURIAN wrestled against two women in the tournament and lost to \n2 \n3  both.  (Exhibit B, p. 27:23-p.29:5) \nMANSOURIAN did not compete for a place on the wrestling team in the fall  of 200 I, after \n5  Burch was gone.  (Exhibit N, ~ 4)  Burch had sent an e-mail to NO, MANSOURIAN and MANCUSO \n6  urging  them  to  \"make\"  new  head  coach  Zalesky cut them  from  the  team  \"because  [the  women 1 \n7  supposedly  can't  compete  with  the  men.\"  In  Burch's  opinion,  this  would  \"help  their  case\". \n8  MANSOURIAN did not even bother to  tryout.  (Exhibit B,  p.  326-327, Exhibit 00, e-mail from \n9  Burch) She has never wrestled in a national wrestling tournament, has never participated in the Pan \n10  American  games,  never  tried  out  for  the  U.S.  Olympic  team,  and  never  held  any  national  or \n11  international rankings as a wrestler.  (Exhibit B, p. 32:20-p.34:3)s \n2.  CHRISTINE NG \n12 \n13  NO started wrestling in her senior year of high school as part of the school team. (Exhibit C, p. \n14  44:8-14)  She was unable to defeat either the boys or the girls that she wrestled against at the high \n15  school level.  (Exhibit C, p. 51 :9-20)  NO was not recruited by any school at the college level.  (Exhibit \n16  ~, p. 51 :21-24)  She entered U.C. Davis as a freshman in the fall of 1998 and graduated in September \n17  2002.  (Exhibit C, p. 16: 14-21) \n18  NO had no desire to practice or wrestle against men; she was more interested in simply working \n19  out than she was in competing.  (Exhibit C, p. 122:21-p.123:7).  She admitted during her deposition that \n20  \"I guess the thing is for me, like I have a fear of competing. And so I tend to avoid it when I can.  So \n21  that's why I'm not exactly up for competing.\" (Exhibit C, p. 131:12-15) \n22  NO was not required to compete for a place on the U.C. Davis wrestling team or engage in a \nwrestle-off.  (Exhibit  C,  p.  135:19-p.136:12;  p.  146:19-24)  She  was  never  given  a  uniform  or \n23 \nequipment.  (Exhibit C, p.  127:19-p. 128:12; p.  138:8-16)  During the three years she participated in \n24 \n25 \nIn paragraphs 85 and 86 of their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that before the purported end of women participating in \n5 \n26  wrestling at U.C. Davis \"female wrestlers had the opportunity to participate in wrestling ... and to improve their skills to \nsuch an extent that some became nationally ranked, participated in national women's wrestling tournaments, participated at \n27  members of the U.S. National women's wrestling team, finished high in the Pan-American games and World Wrestling \nChampionships and are expected to be members of the United States Olympic team in 2004 when women's wrestling \n28  becomes a gold medal sport for the frrst time.  Without the benefits obtained from their participation as female wrestlers at \nU.c. Davis, these nationally and internationally ranked female wrestlers would not likely have achieved such a high level \nof success on their own.\" (Exhibit A.\"  85-86) None of the Plaintiffs have ever reached such levels in wrestling. \n12 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 18 of 42\n1  wrestling when Burch was the coach, NG participated in only one match or tournament - the National \nGirls Wrestling tournament in Michigan, held in the spring of 2000.  (Exhibit C,  p.  98:14-p. 99:4) \n2 \n3  Burch did not accompany her to the tournament, she did not wear a U.C. Davis uniform during it, and \nshe did not place. (Exhibit C, p. 5-11; p. 25:22-p.26:5; p. 26:13-p.27:7)  She signed up for the Aggie \n4 \n5  Open wrestling tournament in her freshman  and sophomore years  at U.C.  Davis but no one in her \n6  weight class showed up to compete and thus she did not participate.  (Exhibit C, p. 99:5-p.100:8) \n7  As of the spring of her junior year (200 I), NG was aware of only herself and MANSOURIAN \nas female U.C.  Davis students interested in wrestling.  Samantha Reinis and Abbe Schwartzburg had \n8 \n9  participated in wrestling in  the past, but Reinis was  graduating and  Schwartzburg had  left school. \n10  CHIANG had also left school, due to mental health reasons.  (Exhibit C, p. 211:1-18) \n11  NG tried out for the team in the fall of 2001.  She understood that Coach Zalesky required all \n12  hopefuls to engage in a wrestle-off to determine who would make the team.  (Exhibit C, p.  211:23-\n13  p.212:24;  p.  245:14-20)  NG  participated  in  a  wrestle-off  with  incoming  freshman  Plaintiff \n14  MANCUSO, who pinned her.  (Exhibit C, p. 254:22-p.255:20)  NG was eliminated from a place on the \n15  team after this defeat.  She did not pursue Zalesky's suggestion that she consider wrestling at the club \n16  sport level because she only wanted to be a varsity wrestler.  (Exhibit C, p. 258:14-p.259: 4) \n3.  NANCY CHIANG \n17 \nCHIANG did  not wrestle  until  her  senior year  of high school.  (Exhibit D,  Deposition of \n18 \nCHIANG,  p.  113:25- p.  114:  4;  p.  123:22-25)  She  participated  in  only  one  wrestling  match  or \n19 \ntournament in high school, losing once by decision and once by pin.  (Exhibit D, p. 126: 13-p.127:23) \n20 \nBurch did not sponsor her for admission, nor was she recruited.  (Exhibit D, p.  134:23-p.136:1; \n21 \np.  138: 21-24; p.  169:16-p.170:3)  Plaintiff entered U.C. Davis as a freshman in the fall of 1998 and \n22 \ntook a full load of classes.  (Exhibit D, p.  93:25-p.94:1; p.  164:21-24)  CHIANG was not cleared to \n23 \npractice  with the  team  until  well  into  the.  season,  because  she  didn't obtain her  required  medical \n24 \nclearance until January 1999.  Prior to that time, she could only work out by herself.  (Exhibit D, p. \n25 \n185 :9-p.186: 11)  Burch required the male students to engage in a wrestle-off to attain a spot on the \n26 \nteam, but did not make the women do so.  (Exhibit D, p. 157:6-25; p. 158: 1-4). \n27 \nCHIANG was not given a U.C. Davis uniform, nor did she ever observe a woman wrestler in \n28 \n13 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 19 of 42\nlone. (Exhibit D, p. 154:10-22)  The only match or tournament she participated in during her freshman \n2  year was the Aggie Open in January 1999.  CHIANG wrestled against a woman from a wrestling club \n3  and was defeated.  (Exhibit D, p. 196:10-13; p. 190:1-p.191:2) \n4  Contrary to  a principle rule of collegiate athletics, particularly at an institution such as  U.c. \ns  Davis that prides itself on its students' academic success above all other interests, CHIANG purposely \n6  flunked out of her general chemistry class during the winter of her freshman year because it conflicted \n7  with wrestling practice and she knew she could take the course again.  She also failed her introduction \n8  to literature class because she didn't go to class.  (Exhibit D, p. 200:2-14; p. 166:1-20) \n9  CHIANG started her sophomore year in the fall of 1999.  She attended wrestling practices, but \n10  again was not required to engage in a wrestle-off for a place on the team as the male students were \n11  required to do.  (Exhibit D, p. 231:19-21; p. 234:11-14)  The only match or tournament that CHIANG \n12  participated in during her second year was the 2000 Aggie Open.  She wrestled against two women, \nl3  using freestyle rules, and was defeated both times.  (Exhibit D, p. 218:7-p.219:22; p. 224:16-22) \n14  During  her second year  at  U.c.  Davis,  CHIANG struggled with pre-existing mental  health \n15  issues.  Her mental health deteriorated to the point where she barely attended classes.  (Exhibit D, p. \n73:3-p.74:1; p. 75:8-13).  CHIANG emolled in classes for the spring quarter, but went to only one class \n16 \n17  and then withdrew.  She  chose  instead to  concentrate on working  at  her job at the  Bakers  Square \nrestaurant because \"it was more beneficial for me to work than to go to school at that time.\"  (Exhibit \n18 \n19  D, p. 251: 7-p.252:2; p. 249: 19-23).  In the summer of 2000, CHIANG was hospitalized following a \n20  suicide attempt.  (Exhibit D, p.  75:17-p.76:22).  She attempted to return to U.c. Davis in the fall of \n21  2000 but left again after in mid-October.  Before leaving, CHIANG reverted to her practice of failing to \n22  attend class.  She dropped one course because she didn't like the instructor and he made her sleepy. \n23  (Exhibit D, p. 80:13-p.81:23) \nCHIANG never returned  to  U.C.  Davis.  Since 2001,  she  has  been employed  full  time. \n24 \n(Exhibit D, p.  19:23-p.21: 24).  In the summer of 2002, CHIANG started attending Sacramento City \n25 \nCollege, and is still doing so.  Sacramento City College has a wrestling team but she has never tried out \n26 \nfor it because she does not have the time and is not certain she wants to wrestle at this point in her life. \n27 \n(Exhibit D, p. 47:3-p.48:6; p. 274:6-24) \n28 \n14 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICA TION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 20 of 42\n1  CHIANG has never participated in any world wrestling cbampionship, nor has she participated \nin the Pan American Games.  She never competed in the World Wrestling Championships or tried out \n2 \n3  for  the  Olympic  wrestling  team.  CHIANG has  never  held  a national  or  international  ranking  in \n4  wrestling.

LAUREN MANCUSO \n6  MANCUSO  attend  St.  Francis  High  School,  which  did  not  have  its  own  wrestling  team. \n(Exhibit E, Deposition of Lauren Mancuso p.  59: 10 -11; p. 72:9-21)  She practiced with the wrestling \n7 \n8  teams at Jesuit and Ponderosa High Schools.  (Exhibit E. p.72:19-p.73:II)  MANCUSO participated in \n9  several tournaments at the high school level.  (Exhibit E, p.  33:16-17; p.  58:19-25)  She also was a \n10  member of the St. Francis soccer team for four years. (Exhibit E, p. 72:22-73:4) \n11  Plaintiff applied to U.C.  Davis in her senior year, but was not accepted initially.  (Exhibit E, \n12  p.1l7:27-118:24)  She had a G.P.A. of3.38 and SAT scores of 1100, well below the median scores for \n13  accepted freshmen.  (Exhibit E. p.  97:10-12; 99:25-100:6)  MANCUSO spoke to  Burch,  who made \n14  arrangements for her to be sponsored for admission by Mary Claire Robinson, the coach of the varsity \n15  women's soccer team at U.C. Davis.  MANCUSO understood that if she was sponsored for admission \n16  by the soccer coach she was expected to tryout for the soccer team in a competitive process.  Armed \n17  with  this  sponsorship,  she  was  then  admitted.  (Exhibit  E,  p.120:2-121:1;  126:15-21;  132:10-21) \nNotwithstanding  her  promise  to  make  a  good  faith  effort to  tryout for  soccer  because  she  was \n18 \nsponsored by Robinson for admission,  MANCUSO  used the  sponsorship solely as  a  vehicle to  be \n19 \nadmitted so that she could participate in the wrestling program; she was not really interested in playing \n20 \nsoccer.  (Exhibit E, p.  132:19-133:23)  MANCUSO was never a member of the varsity soccer team at \n21 \nU.C. Davis. (Exhibit E, p. 136:10-21)  She was cut from the soccer team after attending a few practices \n22 \nand was not disappointed that she was. (Exhibit E, p.  134:6-25; 135:12-19)  MANCUSO did not want \n23 \nto  compete with men or wrestle against them; she simply wanted to use the wrestling facilities and \n24 \ncoaching staff at U.C. Davis to work toward her goal of reaching the Olympics. (Exhibit E, p.  184:21-\n25 \n185:23; 188:15-23) \n26 \nMANCUSO entered U.C. Davis as a freshman in the fall of 2001.  She took a full-time course \n27 \nload throughout her four and a half years at the campus.

She contends that in May 2001, either MANSOURIAN, Burch or a \n8 \nfriend named Beau Weiner told her that the campus had agreed to \"reinstate opportunities in wrestling \n9 \nas part of a resolution with O.C.R.\"  MANCUSO believed this included an agreement that the women \n10 \nwould be permitted to wrestle with the team, receive coaching and use the facilities as they had when \n11 \nBurch was the head coach.  She did not know whether the University had actually agreed to this. \n12 \n(Exhibit E, p.  152:23-153:17)  In fact, the campus had made no such agreement.  As noted above, the \n13 \nAthletic Department administration learned that Burch had not told the women the truth about their \n14 \nstatus.  The campus entered into a Voluntary Resolution Plan with O.C.R. that stated: (I) all men and \n15 \nwomen athletes are encouraged to try out for a position on the wrestling team.  The coach will select \n16 \nthose athletes who demonstrate the highest skill and competitive ability in their weight class for a place \n17 \non the roster; (2) the coach will recruit the best qualified athletes for the team, regardless of gender; and \n18 \n(3) in order to further the development of wrestling and to ensure opportunities for women to engage in \n19 \ncompetitive wrestling, a wrestling sport club would be formed and operated along the same lines as all \n20 \nother sport clubs. (Exhibit HH)  There was no promise made that persons coming out for the team in the \n21 \nfall of 200 I would not have to compete for a spot on the team, or that women would be permitted to try \n22 \nout using freestyle rules.  MANCUSO tried out for the wrestling team in the fall of 200 I, under Coach \n23 \nZalesky.  She admitted she did not have the skill to beat any of the men who tried out. (Exhibit E, p. \n24 \n192:25-193:4)  MANCUSO and NG engaged in a wrestle-off match; MANCUSO prevailed with a pin. \n25 \n(Exhibit E, p. 228:10-16)  She then wrestled off against a male and was pinned. (Exhibit E, p. 229:1-\n26 \n230:3)  MANCUSO was cut from the team as was the male who defeated her because neither had the \n27 \nnecessary skills.  (Exhibit N, ~ 4)  MANCUSO  was never a member of the wrestling team or any \n28 \n16 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 22 of 42\n1  varsity team at U.C. Davis.  (Exhibit E, p. 233:17-21; 257:2-7) \n2  In her declaration in  support of this  motion, MANCUSO  claims that  the  fact  she  was not \n3  personally alerted to the date of the Aggie Open wrestling tournament in January 2002 shows some \n4  type of systemic discrimination against women.  She admitted she did not ask Zalesky about the 2002 \n5  Aggie Open. (Exhibit E, p. 265:7-10)  The Aggie Open is advertised in a number of places, including \n6  the  school  newspaper  and the  wrestling  team  web  site.  (Exhibit N,  ~ 6;  Exhibit  B,  p.  302:9-12) \n7  MANCUSO found out about the date of the Open and attended it.  After she sent an accusatory e-mail \n8  to the Chancellor and SWANSON because they didn't personally invite her to the Open, Zalesky sent a \n9  message back to her pointing out the errors in her assumptions. (Exhibit N, ~ 6;  Exhibit II, e-mail; \n10  Exhibit E, p. 289:11-14) \n11  MANCUSO  has  never participated 111  World  Wrestling  Championships,  the  Pam American \n12  Games or held a national or international ranking.  MANCUSO has never tried out for the Olympic \n13  team but \"plans to in the future\". (Exhibit E, p. 91:5-92:10) \n14  III. \n15  OVERVIEW OF LEGAL ISSUES PERTAINING TO THIS MOTION \n16  A.  Title IX and the three part test \nAlthough a motion for class certification is not addressed to the merits of the case, in ruling on \n17 \nthe motion the Court takes into account the elements of the plaintiffs' claims and the proof necessary on \n18 \nthem in order to envision the form  the trial would take.  Elliot v.  ITT Corp,  150 F.R.D.  569,  572 \n19 \n(D.Il1.1992).  Courts have looked to the three prong test established by Department of Education's \n20 \nOffice for Civil Rights regulations in determining whether an institution is in compliance with Title IX \n21 \nand is offering equal athletic opportunities for men and women. \"A university's athletic program is \n22 \nTitle IX-compliant if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) intercollegiate level participation \n23 \nopportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their \n24 \nrespective  emollments,  or (2)  where the members of one sex  have been and  are  underrepresented \n25 \namong intercollegiate athletes, ... the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program \n26 \nexpansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members of \n27 \nthat sex, or (3) where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and \n28 \n17 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 23 of 42\n1  the institution cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, ... it can \nbe  demonstrated  that  the  interests  and  abilities  of the  members  of that  sex  have  been  fully  and \n2 \n3  effectively accommodated by the current program.\"  Neal v. Board of Trustees of the California State \n4  University,  198  FJd 763,  768  (9th  Cir.  1999).  U.C.  Davis  has  demonstrated  a  commitment  to \n5  continuous expansion of its women's intercollegiate athletic program (prong 2).  In  1994, women's \n6  indoor track and field was  added.  Three women's varsity sports were  added in  1996 (water polo, \nrowing and lacrosse). Women's golf was added in 2005.  Each addition provided more opportunities for \n7 \n8  female students to participate in varsity athletics. \n9  There is no statutory or constitutional right to participate in college athletics or to be given a \n10  spot on a particular team simply because a student desires to participate in that sport.  Miami University \n11  Wrestling Club v. Miami University, 302 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir. 2002); Burrows v.  Ohio High Sch. \n12  Athletic Ass'n, 891 F.2d 122, 125 (6th Cir. 1989).  An educational institution is not required to field a \n13  team in any particular sport;  the  decision on which teams will be  sponsored lies  solely within the \n14  discretion of the school.  \"Title IX does not require institutions to fund any particular number or type of \n15  athletic opportunities -only that they provide those opportunities in a non-discriminatory fashion if they \n16  wish to receive federal funds.\"  Cohen v. Brown University, 991 F.2d 888,906 (lst Cir.1983). \nB.  Class Certification Standards \n17 \nA party seeking to  certify a class must demonstrate that it has  met all  four requirements of \n18 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), and at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b).  Valentino v. \n19 \nCarter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227,1234 (9th Cir. 1996).  The Rule 23(a) factors are: (l) the class is so \n20 \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to \n21 \nthe class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of \n22 \nthe class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \n23 \nThese requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy effectively \"limit the class \n24 \nclaims to those fairly encompassed by the named plaintiffs' claims by ensuring that the named plaintiffs \n25 \nhave suffered the same injury and possess the same interest as the other class members.\"  Gen'l Tel. v. \n26 \nFalcon, 457 U.S. 147, 156 (1982).  If the moving parties establish the preliminary criteria ofF.R.C.P. \n27 \n23(a), they must then establish at least one of the criteria ofF.R.C.P. 23(b). Plaintiffs contend this case \n28 \n18 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 24 of 42\n1  falls within the parameters of subsection (b)(2).  In Falcon, the Court signaled that plaintiffs cannot rely \non conclusory and speculative assertions in support of their class petitions. \"After General Telephone \n2 \nCo. v. Falcon, allegations alone of a pattern and practice of discrimination ... are inadequate to satisfy \n3 \nthe commonality requirement. What is necessary is a specific showing of underlying facts which might \n4 \n5  raise an inference of a common question of pattern and practice through allegations of specific incidents \nof discrimination, supporting affidavits or evidence at the class certification hearing.  Pleadings should \n6 \nbe factual and specific.  Newberg on Class Actions, sec.24.21, at 24-89-95 (3rd  ed.  1992) (emphasis \n7 \nadded) \n8 \nPlaintiffs' motion should be denied because (1) the interests of the Plaintiff conflict with the \n9 \ninterests  of the  proposed  class,  thus  defeating  commonality  and  typicality  requirements;  (2)  the \n10 \nindividual nature of Plaintiffs' claims predominates, causing a conflict of interest with any potential \n11 \nclass members; (3) the proposed class representatives lack standing; and (4) the scope of the proposed \n12 \nclass,  and  the  identified  class  representatives,  exceeds  the  scope  of the  class  and  representatives \n13 \nidentified in the Complaint. \n14 \nIV. \n15 \nTHE CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN PLAINTIFFS AND OTHER FEMALE \n16 \nSTUDENT ATHLETES DEFEATS COMMONALITY AND TYPICALITY REOUIREMENTS \n17 \nCommonality and typicality are closely related issues, but there are differences.  Commonality \n18 \nrequires an examination of the relationship of common facts and legal issues among the class members. \n19 \nTypicality requires  an  examination of the  relationship  of facts  and  legal  issues  between  the  class \n20 \nrepresentatives and the class members. Conte and Newberg on Class Actions, Vol. I at p. 411  (4th Ed.) \n21 \nPlaintiffs' motion fails to establish the commonality requirement.  They contend that all current \n22 \nand future female student athletes at U.C. Davis have been subjected to the same alleged discriminatory \n23 \ntreatment,  but  offer  no  evidence  to  support  their  argument  other  than  the  declarations  of \n24 \nMANSOURIAN and MANCUSO  and  statistics  about  the  number of women participating in  club \n25 \nsports.  The declarations of MANSOURlAN and MANCUSO delineate their unique experiences with \n26 \nthe wrestling program.  There are no declarations from current or potential future female students who \n27 \nare interested in sports other than wrestling.  There are no declarations from anyone other than these \n28 \n19 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 25 of 42\n1  two Plaintiffs setting forth allegations that the UNIVERSITY allegedly discriminates against women in \nregard to athletic opportunities.  There is no evidence that any other female students demanded to be \n2 \n3  allowed to participate on a varsity team, even though they did not have the requisite skills or abilities to \n4  earn a spot on the roster.  To the contrary, the common or typical experience of a student who wants a \n5  place on a varsity team is that she must compete with other hopefuls and that the head coach ultimately \n6  makes a selection based on the skills and abilities demonstrated by the students during the try-outs. \nThe fact that there are  other female  student athletes attending the school  is  not sufficient to \n7 \nestablish commonality.  Scofield v. Board of Trustees, 65 F.R.D.595, 602 (D.C.Miss.1975).  Where the \n8 \n9  experiences of the class representatives is different than those of the putative class, or where the trier of \n10  fact would be required to make individual findings on each claim, commonality is not satisfied.  See \n11  e.g. Lowery v. Adams, 344 F.Supp.446,459 (D.C.Ky.  1972) [civil rights actions arising out of actions \n12  of four university students who were disciplined for disrupting a school event could not be maintained \n13  as  class actions  because actions were  unique to  the plaintiffs];  Jamerson v.  Board of Trustees,  80 \n14  F.R.D.744, 746 (D.C.Ala.1978) [\"But as to the class issue, the first question is whether others exist who \n15  are  similarly  situated  and  who  may  pose  the  same  or  similar  questions  as  their  self-proclaimed \n16  representative.  Thus, the scope of this study [o n commonality] is limited to determining whether there \n17  are others like the named plaintiff and whether the class method suits the action.\"] \n18  Typicality  is  also  a  problem  for  Plaintiffs.  In  Rappaport  v.  Katz,  62  F.R.D.  512,513-514 \n19  (D.N.Y.1974),  the  court relied  on  Wright &  Miller  in denying  certification of a class that would \n20  potentially include persons who met the definition of the proposed class but did not have the same \n21  interests  as  the  class  representative.  A  putative  class  representative  cannot  meet  the  typicality \nrequirement simply by alleging that gender discrimination has occurred, as Plaintiffs do here.  Alston v \n22 \nVirginia High School League,  184  F.R.D.  587,  579 (D. Va.  1999).  When considering the  issue  of \n23 \ntypicality the district court should seek to \"uncover conflicts of interests between named parties and the \n24 \nclass they seek to represent\" and ask whether class representatives \"possess the same interest and suffer \n25 \nthe same injury\" as the class members.  Id. at p.  578.  In Alston the district court refused to certify a \n26 \nclass where it was evident that most of the girls who would be included in the class did not have the \n27 \nsame  interest  in  reclassifying  the  scheduling  of girls'  high  school  athletics  as  the  proposed  class \n28 \n20 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 26 of 42\n1  representatives did.  \"This conflict prevents plaintiffs from satisfying the typicality requirement as well \nas  the  adequacy  of representation  requirement.  Plaintiffs  have  presented  nothing  to  dispel  the \n2 \n3  defendant's suggestion that there is a schism between girls who may benefit from reclassification and \n4  those who are injured by reclassification.  A girl who could not previously play two sports because they \n5  occurred in the same season may be able to play those two sports when a school is reclassified and the \n6  seasons for some sports change.  Such girls would not bring claims like the  ones  brought here  by \n7  plaintiffs.  Thus it cannot be said that as goes the claim of these plaintiffs, so go the claims of all others \n8  in the class.\"  Id .. at p. 579. \n9  Where the class representatives have interests different than the members of the proposed class, \n10  due  process issues are  implicated.  Hansberry v.  Lee,  311  U.S.32,  45  (1940).  Members of a rule \n11  23(b )(2)  class may not opt out of the class.  Thus,  the due process concerns of those who will be \n12  included  in  the  class  become  paramount,  as  they  will  be  bound  by  any  finding  in  the  case.  In \ndetermining whether due process will be afforded to the class members, the Court must consider two \n13 \nquestions: (I) do the class representatives and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other \n14 \n15  class members; and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel vigorously prosecute the action on \nbehalf of all class members.  Hanlon v. Chrysler Chevrolet, 150 FJd 1011, 1020 (9th Cir.1998).  In this \n16 \ncase, the answers to those questions are \"Yes\" and \"No, they cannot because their interests are different \n17 \nthan the interests of other female  student athletes.\"  Plaintiffs'  interest is  in establishing a separate \n18 \nwomen's wrestling team for the purpose of providing them with coaching and experience so they can \n19 \ncompete  in  open tournaments  rather than  in  conference competition.  Instead of going  through  the \n20 \nestablished process for submitting a proposal to establish women's wrestling as a varsity sport, they are \n21 \nattempting to jump to the front of the line via this suit.  Their interests and actions are completely at \n22 \nodds  with  the  interests  of the  club  sports  that  went  through  the  effort  to  submit  proposals  for \n23 \nconsideration for varsity status and want to  establish teams  in their own sports.  For example, the \n24 \nwomen wrestlers would be competing with the women's field hockey club team.  The latter has an \n25 \nestablished track record as a club sport (women's wrestling does not), is an N.C.A.A. sponsored sport in \n26 \nall three divisions (women's wrestling is not), is part of a conference (women's wrestling is not) and \n27 \nhas  far  more  participants  nationally  (5,296  athletes  among  252  N.C.A.A.  teams)  than  women's \n28 \n21 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 27 of 42\n1  wrestling.  (Exhibit DD)  These facts distinguish women's wrestling and suggest that there is a greater \nand sustained level of interest in sports other than women's wrestling, one of the factors that must be \n2 \n3  considered by U.C. Davis in determining whether a new varsity sport should be added.  See 44 Fed. \n4  Reg.  71413,71418(1979).  Therefore, an inherent conflict exists between Plaintiffs and their goal of \n5  establishing a female wrestling program and the goals of women participating in other club sports.  The \n6  irreconcilable nature of this conflict precludes Plaintiffs from representing the putative class. \n7  The  I.C.A.  program  is  funded  by  a  finite  budget.  (Exhibit  K,  ~ 5).  Plaintiffs  would  be \n8  competing for limited funding with women who participate or are interested in participating in other \n9  sports.  The court in Bryant v.  Colgate,  1996 U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  8393  (D.N.Y.  1996) recognized the \n10  inherent conflict in the battle for limited funds:  \"In an era of static enrollment and increasing financial \n11  demands on institutions of higher learning, the resources available for intercollegiate athletics are finite \n12  and subject to larger budgetary concerns .... It would seem that where the number of programs available \n13  are limited, plaintiffs' interests would be antagonistic to those of other interested and able athletes who \n14  might desire elevation of their own sport.  Such circumstances could render plaintiffs' representation \n15  inadequate under Rule 23(a).\" Id.  Further, there are conflicts between women's wrestling and those \n16  sports that are parts of a conference and are N.C.A.A. sponsored.  The Athletic Director at U.C. Davis \n17  would be very hesitant to recommend adding a varsity sport that is not part of a conference because of \n18  the difficulties in scheduling competition.  If the money was available to add a new sport, he would be \n19  more inclined to recommend addition of a sport that is either a N.C.A.A. championship sport or an \n20  emerging sport.  Women's wrestling does not fall within either category.  (Exhibit K, ~ 8) \n21  Finally, many, if not all, of the women athletes participating in other sports that are not yet at the \n22  varsity level would not consider Plaintiffs' attitudes or experiences to represent their concept of varsity \n23  athletics.  NG is afraid of competition, one of the hallmarks of varsity athletics.  NG, MANSOURIAN \nand CHIANG did not have to tryout for the wrestling team under Burch's coaching.  A competitive \n24 \nselection process to ensure that the most skilled athletes comprise the team's roster is an essential part \n25 \n26  of varsity  sports.  The  women wrestlers  never  competed  in  regular  meets  or  matches;  they  only \nparticipated in one or two open tournaments.  Members of true varsity teams engage in head to head \n27 \ncompetition in  a regular season schedule.  Perhaps most importantly, many women athletes  in the \n28 \n22 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 28 of 42\n1  existing club sports may well be offended by Plaintiffs' efforts to bypass the process for elevating a \n2  sport to varsity status and their insistence that they are entitled to a place on a team even though they do \n3  not have the skills or ability to  earn one.  This conclusion is bolstered by the absence of even one \ndeclaration from a member of a club sport in support of this motion. \n4 \n5  The fact that Plaintiffs are seeking establishment of a women's wrestling program via injunctive \nrelief sets  them  apart from  other female  students who may be  interested in having a varsity  team \n6 \nestablished for another sport.  This conflict defeats typicality.  O'Connor v. Boeing North America, 180 \n7 \n8  F.R.D. 359,375 (D.Cal. 1997).  It would be impossible for MANSOURIAN, MANCUSO or CHIANG \nto adequately represent the interests of female field hockey players, female bowlers, female horse polo \n9 \nplayers or any  other female  athletes  because Plaintiffs will put their interest in  having a women's \n10 \nwrestling program established before all other interests.  If the Court were to issue injunctive relief in \n11 \nthe form of ordering U.C. Davis to add one more women's varsity sport, Plaintiffs would argue for the \n12 \naddition of wrestling.  The due process rights of the other members of the class they seek to represent \n13 \nwould be trampled as the women interested in establishing other varsity sports would be bound by the \n14 \norder, without having had a chance to make an argument for the addition of a different sport.  Such a \n15 \nconflict is fatal to Plaintiffs quest to have this action certified.  Greene v.  Southland Corp., 83 F.R.D. \n16 \n117, 123 (D.Tex. 1979). \n17 \nMANSOURIAN has already graduated from U.c. Davis, CHIANG dropped out of U.C. Davis, \n18 \nand MANCUSO will graduate this June.  Their.eligibility to participate in intercollegiate athletics has \n19 \nexpired (in the case of MANSOURIAN and CHIANG) or will shortly (in the case of MANCUSO). \n20 \nBased on this status, it cannot be said that they have the same interests as currently eligible female \n21 \nstudents, or students who may become eligible in the future. \n22 \nIn conclusion, Plaintiffs' unique experiences set them apart from other female student athletes, \n23 \nas does their quest to establish a varsity team in a sport that does not have sufficient competition in the \n24 \nlocal area and is not an N.C.A.A. sanctioned sport.  This case consists of individual claims, not a class \n25 \nclaim. \n26 \n/II \n27 \n/II \n28 \n23 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAJNTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 29 of 42\n1  A.  Even  if the  Court limited  the class  to  women wrestlers, Plaintiffs cannot establish the \nrequisite uumerosity \n2 \nFaced with the problems attendant to their typicality and commonality issues, Plaintiffs may \n3 \nrevert to the definition of the class asserted in the complaint (see infra) and instead ask the Court to \n4 \n5  define the class to include only current and future female students at V.C. Davis who are eligible to, and \nwant to, participate in intercollegiate varsity wrestling.  Even if this definition was used, Plaintiffs still \n6 \nfail to establish the necessary showing for certification. \n7 \nRule 23(a)(1) raises the issue of numerosity; are there so many members of the proposed class \n8 \nthat joinder would be impracticable?  While there is no specific minimum number of members in the \n9 \n10  class, Plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating the existence of the persons they seek to represent \nand cannot rely on speculation or conclusory allegations to do so.  Gevedon v. Purdue Pharmaceuticals, \n11 \n212 F.R.D. 333, 338 (D.Ky.2002). Plaintiffs engage in significant speculation by arguing that \"the vast \n12 \nmajority\" of the 1,000 or so high school girls who participate in wrestling in California would apply to \n13 \nV.C.  Davis for  admission.  While it is  theoretically possible that the \"vast majority\" might apply, \n14 \nstatistically, very few would meet the rigorous criteria for admission to U.C. Davis.  In the past four \n15 \nyears, V.C. Davis received 30,000-32,000 freshmen applications per year.  Overall, 55-65% of those \n16 \napplicants (approximately 17,000-18,000) are offered admission.  Of those offered admission, 24-26% \n17 \n18  (4,300-4,600) actually enroll.  (Exhibit V, Declaration of Judy Sakaki, ~ 2).  Per the California Master \nPlan for Higher Education, only 12.5% of the state's public high school graduates should be considered \n19 \nfor admission to the Vniversity of California system.  The competition for admission to V.C. Davis is \n20 \nstringent; the class entering in 2005 had a median grade point average of3.92 and a median SAT score \n21 \n22  of 1,270. (Exhibit V, ~~ 3, 4)  A student who is recruited to the campus because of athletic skills still \n23  must meet V.C. eligibility standards. (Id. ~ 4) \nWhen these  figures  are  applied  to  Plaintiffs'  speculative  argument,  its  weaknesses  become \n24 \nobvious. The C.I.F. survey showed 1,230 girls wrestled in this state last year.  There is no indication of \n25 \nhow many of those girls were seniors and of that group, how many enrolled at a college or university \n26 \nafter they graduated.  Plaintiffs have not made any showing on how many of those girls have a median \n27 \ngrade point average of 3.92 or a median SAT score of 1,270.  Absent these specific factors, Plaintiffs \n28 \n24 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 30 of 42\n1  cannot rely on raw numbers.  See Kohn v. Mucia, 776 F.Supp. 348, 353 (D.Ill.199l).  Even if one were \n2  to  engage  in  hypotheticals  and  gross  speculation,  the  numbers  do  not  satisfy  the  numerosity \n3  requirement.  If all of the girls who wrestled last year intended to go to college and if all 1,230 applied \nto the University of California system (which is statistically improbable), per the California Master Plan \n4 \n5  only 12.5% or 153 would even be considered for admission to the U.C. system.  There is no way to \n6  determine how many of the theoretical  153 would apply to U.C. Davis, as opposed to the other nine \n7  U.C. campuses.  Even in the statistically improbable event that all  153  applied, only 50% would be \n8  offered admission (see Exhibit U), bringing the number to 76.  Of that 76, statistically only 25% would \n9  actually enroll, bringing the number to 19.  Of this small number, there is no guarantee that all would be \n10  interested in wrestling at the collegiate level.  Due to the heightened skill level required for participation \n11  in  varsity sports at the collegiate level  as  compared with the skills necessary to participate in  high \n12  school sports, as well as many other reasons such as the rigors of college academics, many students \n13  choose not to continue their athletic pursuits at the college level.  Per the deposition testimony of the \n14  Plaintiffs,  between  1998  and  2001  there  were  only  six  women  who  demonstrated  an  interest  in \n15  wrestling.  Numbers in this low range are not sufficient to meet the numerosity requirement. \n16  Citing to the number of women participating in sport clubs on campus does not help Plaintiffs \n17  either.  In Siles v. ILGWU Nat'l Retirement Fund, 783 F.2d 923,930 (9th Cir.1986) the Ninth Circuit \n18  affirmed the lower court's denial of a request for class certification on the grounds that the plaintiff \n19  offered evidence only that within certain years, 31,000 employees covered under the pension plan in \n20  issue lost their jobs.  The plaintiff failed to demonstrate how many of these employees failed to receive \n21  a  pension or  met  the  criteria to  receive  one.  Thus,  numerosity  was  not  satisfied.  Similarly,  in \nStambaugh v. Kansas Dep't of Corrections, 151 F.R.D.664, 671  (D.Kan.1993), the court did not accept \n22 \nthe plaintiffs' argument that simply because there were 794 female employees in the department, all \n23 \nmust have been subject to  gender discrimination.  \"The wide gap between an individual's claim of \n24 \ndiscrimination and the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury cannot be \n25 \nbridged by conclusory allegations of several instances of discrimination in a single D.O.C. facility.\" Id. \n26 \nat p. 676.  Here, Plaintiffs cannot bridge the gap between their claim that they were treated differently \n27 \nin regard to the wrestling team under the lead of a coach other than Burch and their claim that the entire \n28 \n25 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 31 of 42\n1  varsity sports program at U.C.  Davis discriminates against women.  They have not established the \nrequisite numerosity. \n2 \n3  V. \n4  THE CLAIMS OF THE PUTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFFS ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE \n5  DEFENSES AND ARE NOT TYPICAL OF ANY CLAIM THAT MIGHT BE RAISED BY A \n6  CLASS MEMBER \n7  In considering the issue of typicality the Court must look at the issues of whether focus on the \nclass issues will be subsumed by the individual claims and whether the claims made by the putative \n8 \n9  class representatives are subject to unique defenses that threaten to become the focus of the litigation. \nHanon v. Dataproducts Corp\" 976 F.2d 497 (9th Cir. 1992).  The test of typicality \"is whether the other \n10 \n11  members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is based on conduct which is not unique to \n12  the  named  plaintiffs,  and  whether other class  members  have  been  injured  by  the  same  course  of \n13  conduct. [citation].\" Id. at p. 508.  This is in keeping with the Supreme Court's directive that \"A class \n14  representative must be part of the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as the \n15  class members.\" Gen'l Tel. Of the West v. Falcon, supra at p.  156 . Plaintiffs in this case cannot meet \n16  this standard because their experiences with the wrestling team are unique and have no application to, \n17  or relevance to, the experiences of any female student athletes seeking to establish a sport as a varsity \n18  team for  purposes of intercollegiate competition.  The primary focus  of this  litigation is  Plaintiffs' \n19  disparate treatment contentions that are based on the events that took place in the fall of 2000. \nA.  Plaintiffs' claims and experiences are different than any potential claim by a  putative \n20 \nclass member \n21 \nPlaintiffs purport to speak on behalf of, and represent the interests of, female student-athletes \n22 \nwho  are  currently  participating  in  a  number  of club  sports  or who  have  an  interest  in  doing  so, \n23 \nnotwithstanding the fact their motion is devoid of even one declaration from a current or future U.C. \n24 \nDavis female student (other than the Plaintiffs) who believes she has been denied the opportunity to \n25 \nparticipate in athletics.  There is a vast difference between the experiences of the Plaintiffs in regard to \n26 \ntheir efforts to either be part of the wrestling team or to have the school establish a separate women's \n27 \nwrestling program so that they can train for open meets, and the experiences of women who want to, or \n28 \n26 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 32 of 42\ndo, tryout for a place on the roster on a women's varsity team in an N.C.A.A. sanctioned sport. \n1 \nNG, CHIANG and MANSOURIAN were never required to tryout for a place on the wrestling \n2 \n3  team.  This  is  an aberration in the world of varsity sports.  The general process followed by head \n4  coaches in selecting members of a varsity team is to have the candidates engage in competition with \n5  each other to determine which athletes demonstrate exceptional skills.  (Exhibit K, ~ 9).  Former coach \n6  Burch was of the opinion that none of the Plaintiffs had the skills necessary to actually make the team. \nThey were permitted to practice with the team, but it is questionable whether they had a true varsity \n7 \n8  experience when their only taste of competition was one open meet, if that.  There is a very significant \n9  factual dispute as to the events that took place in the fall of 2000 which led to the women being left off \n10  of the  roster for  the  wrestling team.  The  Plaintiffs  and  their former  coach contend  some  of the \nDefendants told the coach that women were not permitted to be on the team.  Defendants contend that \n11 \nBurch was  unwilling  to  allot  any  of his  limited  roster spots  to  the  women,  who  could not come \n12 \nanywhere close to competing against wrestlers in Division I schools.  However, rather than tell them the \n13 \ntruth about his assessment of their skills and his unwillingness to  give up a spot to them that could \n14 \notherwise go to a competitive male wrestler, Burch lied to the women and told them they were off the \n15 \nteam because of the desires of the Athletic Department administration.  During this same period of \n16 \ntime, Burch was in an ongoing dispute with his employer because he wanted a full-time appointment as \n17 \nthe head wrestling coach.  It is Defendants' belief that Burch used the issue of the women wrestlers for \n18 \nhis own purposes to attempt to leverage more pay for him6  Plaintiffs contend that the roster cap should \n19 \nnot apply to them because of their gender.  Defendants dispute this.  If women who could not earn a \n20 \nplace on  the team by their skills  were permitted to  remain on  the roster,  they would  be receiving \n21 \npreferential treatment over males who could not make the team based on their skills. \n22 \nThese factual disputes constitute the bulk of this case.  The focus of the case will be on the very \n23 \nunique experiences ofNG, CHIANG, and MANSOURIAN, who contend they were \"varsity wrestlers\" \n24 \nyet never had to tryout for a place on the team and engaged in no regular conference competition.  The \n25 \nfocus will also be on the very unique experience of MANCUSO, who used a soccer sponsorship to gain \n26 \n27 \n28  6  The extent of the factual dispute on this issue is reflected by the motion for summary judgment filed in the suit filed by \nBurch (Burch v. Regents of the Unversity of California, et. ar.,  [#S 04-38 WBS/GGHj See accompanying request for \njudicial notice. \n27 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 33 of 42\n1  admittance to U.C. Davis even though she had no intention of actually trying to make the soccer team. \nInstead, relying on hearsay (and erroneous hearsay at that) from others, she assumed she could simply \n2 \nbecome part of the wrestling team without having to compete for one of the limited roster spots.  The \n3 \ncoach who  replaced  Burch followed  the  long-standing tradition used  in every competitive sport to \n4 \n5  require those interested in obtaining a place on the team to demonstrate their athletic skills and abilities \nand show they are the best qualified.  These experiences are far different than the experiences of any yet \n6 \nunnamed or identified female student athletes who tryout for a place on a women's varsity team. \n7 \nCases  that are  fact-specific  such as  this  one  are  not  appropriate for  class action status.  In \n8 \nPinkard v Pullman, 678 F.2d 1211, 1214 (5th Cir. 1982), four African-American plaintiffs sought class \n9 \ncertification in an action where they claimed systemic discrimination.  The district court's denial of \n10 \ncertification was upheld by the Fifth Circuit, which stated \"It is well settled that, where a case requires \n11 \ndetailed investigations of the circumstances surrounding the claims of the individual class members, \n12 \nthat case does not lend itself to treatment as a class action.\"  Judge Levi's opinion in Stevens v. Hamer, \n13 \n213 F.R.D. 358, 367 (E.D.Cal. 2002) is also instructive on this point.  The plaintiffs alleged they were \n14 \nentitled to certification of their claims as a class action against the California Youth Authority, even \n15 \nthough the claims arose out of different situations involving different wards at different institutions. \n16 \nJudge  Levi  noted  that  the  plaintiffs  provided  only  minimal  information  concerning  their  right  to \n17 \nequitable relief, and that \"nor are many of the claims for class-wide equitable relief tightly connected to \n18 \nthe present circumstances of the individual named plaintiffs.\"  Id. at p. 367.  After decrying the fact that \n19 \nthe plaintiffs had been content to simply allege one past violation at one CY A facility and then claim \n20 \nstanding and imminent harm on a system-wide basis, Judge Levi held that \"in the absence of specific \n21 \nfactual allegations connecting the named plaintiffs' individual claims to particular CY A policies and \n22 \nprocedures, the complainant's class allegations provide no additional insight into whether the named \n23 \nplaintiffs face a sufficient individual likelihood of future injury to pursue equitable relief.\"  Id. at p. \n24 \n368-9. \n25 \nB.  Plaintiffs' claims are subject to unique defenses such as the statute of limitations \n26 \nVarious affirmative defenses raised by Defendants threaten to  shift the focus  away from  the \n27 \nclass.  The statutes of limitations for a Title IX claim and a claim under 42 U.S.C. section 1983  are \n28 \n28 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 34 of 42\n1  derived from the state law limitation for personal injury claims.  Stanley v. Trustees of the California \n2  State University, 443  F.3d 1129,  1134 (9th Cir.  2006).  California Code of Civil Procedure section \n3  335.1, which sets forth a two year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, becarne effective on \n4  January 1,2003.  Jones v. Blanas, 393 FJd 918, 927 (9th  Cir. 2004). Prior to that date the statute of \n5  limitations for such claims was one year.  The new two year statute does not apply retroactively.  rd. \n6  Claims that accrued prior to that date are governed by the former one year statute.  Abreu v. Ramirez, \n284 F.Supp.2d 1250, 1255 (D.CaI.2003).  The statute of limitations on a claim begins to run when the \n7 \n8  plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the alleged injury which forms the basis of the action.  Stanley, \nsupra at p. 1136. \n9 \n10  MANSOURIAN  and NG contend that in October 2000,  they were told by  Burch that  \"the \nadministration\" did not want women on the wrestling team and thus they could not have a spot on the \n11 \nroster.  CHIANG was not at the meeting when he made this statement, but was still enrolled at U .C. \n12 \nDavis at the time and heard about it from her co-plaintiffs.  MANCUSO entered U.C. Davis in the fall \n13 \nof 2001.  Per the requirements of the new wrestling coach, all persons seeking a place on the roster of \n14 \nthe wrestling tearn had to compete with other hopefuls in a wrestle-off.  MANCUSO participated in the \n15 \nwrestle-offs but was defeated and not selected for the tearn.  N G was also not selected because she was \n16 \ndefeated by MANCUSO.  MANSOURIAN did not bother to tryout for the team in the fall of 2001 and \n17 \nCHIANG failed to return to school that quarter.  This suit was not filed until December 18, 2003.  The \n18 \nclaims of MANSOURI AN and CHIANG had expired by October 2001.  At the latest, the claims ofNG \n19 \nand MANCUSO ripened on the day they were cut from the tearn, which was October 30,2001.  Their \n20 \nclaims expired on October 30, 2002.  All of these claims were \"dead\" when the complaint was filed on \n21 \nDecember 18, 2003 as they all fell within the previous one year statute of limitations.  Litigation of this \n22 \nissue will playa key role in this case. \n23 \nVI. \n24 \nPLAINTIFFS DO NOT HAVE STANDING TO BE CLASS REPRESENTATIVES \n25 \nCHIANG  and  MANSOURIAN  contend  they  can  adequately  represent  the  interests  of the \n26 \nproposed class.  Whether that class  is  the  class of current or future  female  students who  might be \n27 \ninterested in wrestling at the collegiate level, or whether it is the more broad definition suggested by \n28 \n29 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 35 of 42\n1  Plaintiffs in this motion, CHIANG and MANSOURIAN do not fall  into the proposed class because \n2  they have both graduated and exhausted their athletic eligibility under N.C.A.A. rules.  MANCUSO's \n3  eligibility has not currently expired, but it will by June 2006 (see below).  Even if the Court were to \ncertify a class, Defendants would move to decertify it upon MANCUSO's actual graduation. \n4 \ns  A plaintiff in a Title IX case must have standing to assert each and every claim she makes in her \n6  complaint.  Beasley v. Alabama State University, 3 F.Supp. 2d 1325,1343 (D. Ala. 1998).  A plaintiffs \n7  claim must be live not only at the time the suit is filed, but throughout the litigation.  If a plaintiff loses \nher standing during the pendency of the suit, she loses the right to assert the claim.  Id. at p. 1344.  A \n8 \n9  student-athlete who had N.C.A.A. eligibility and thus standing at the time a suit was filed, but whose \n10  eligibility expires before the end of the suit and before a class is certified no  longer has standing to \n11  assert Title IX and related discrimination claims.  Ibid.  Similarly, a student who has graduated lacks \n12  standing to  complain  about  a school's athletic  program.  Ritacco  v.  Norwin  School  District,  361 \nF.Supp.930,  931  (D.Pa.1973);  Cook  v.  Colgate,992  F.2d  17,18(2d  Cir.1993)[compiling  cases  on \n13 \nmootness of Title IX cases based on graduation].  The wrestling team at U.C.  Davis is an N.C.A.A. \n14 \n15  sponsored sport.  Student-athletes who participate in intercollegiate athletics at U.C. Davis are subject \n16  to  that entity's eligibility  rules.  (Exhibit L,  ~~ 3-4).  As  a general  rule,  a student-athlete  cannot \nparticipate in a Division I sport for more than four seasons of intercollegiate competition.  Further, a \n17 \nstudent-athlete must complete his/her seasons of eligibility within five years of the first quarter in which \n18 \nthe student is registered as a full-time student.  (Id.)  While the N.C.A.A. rule on this issue is couched in \n19 \nterms  of calendar  years,  as  a  practical  matter  it  applies  to  academic  years  because  there  is  no \n20 \nintercollegiate competition or required practices in the summer months.  MANSOURIAN entered U.C. \n21 \nDavis in the fall of 2000 as a full-time student and graduated in June of 2004.  Her N.C.A.A. eligibility \n22 \n23  expired in June of2005.  (Exhibit L, ~ 5)  None of the exceptions to the five year rule (military service, \nreligious missions, Peace Corps service or pregnancy) apply to her.  CHIANG entered U.C. Davis in \n24 \nthe fall  of 1998 as a full  time student.  Her eligibility expired in June of 2003.  Her ineligibility is \n25 \nfurther compounded by  the fact  in the  Winter Quarter of 2001  she became academically ineligible \n26 \nbecause of her poor grades.  (IQJ \n27 \nMANCUSO has never been a member of the varsity wrestling team, or any other team, at U.c. \n28 \n30 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 36 of 42\n1  Davis. (Exhibit E,  p.  233:17-21; 257:2-7)  She entered U.C.  Davis in the fall  of 2001  and filed to \ngraduate in November 2005. By the time this motion is heard, MANCUSO should have received her \n2 \n3  degree and graduated.  Her N.C.A.A. eligibility expires in June 2006 (Exhibit L, ~5) \nNone of the Plaintiffs can demonstrate that they are entitled to the injunctive relief they seek \n4 \nbecause none of them can show that they face exclusion from participation in varsity wrestling (or any \n5 \nother sport) at U.c. Davis in the future.  Without this essential element, there is no basis for injunctive \n6 \nrelief and no basis for claiming they can act as class representatives.  City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 \n7 \nU.S.95,  105-106 (1983);  Doe v.  District of Columbia, 216  F.R.D.  5,  12  (D.D.C.  2003).  Plaintiffs \n8 \ncannot show they face imminent injury or damage.  Courts are very hesitant to inject themselves into \n9 \nthe operation of state agencies under such circumstances. \"In general, injunctive relief is to be used \n10 \nsparingly, and only in a clear and plain case, especially when the court is enjoining the conduct of a \n11 \nstate  agency.  [citation]  The  rigorous  preconditions  to  such  injunctions reflect  both  federalism  and \n12 \nseparation of powers principles .... Thus, the requirement that plaintiffs establish a particularized risk of \n13 \nimminent injury before seeking prospective relief ensures that federal courts refrain from intervening in \n14 \nthe administration of state institutions absent a clearly defined legal dispute.\" Stevens v. Harper, 213 \n15 \nF.R.D. 358,367 (E.D.Cal. 2002) \n16 \nIn Grandson v. University of Michigan, 272 F.3d 568 (8th Cir. 2001) the university was notified \n17 \nby the  Office for  Civil Rights  in  September  1996 that an  administrative complaint had  been  filed \n18 \nagainst it alleging it was not effectively accommodating the athletic interests and abilities of its female \n19 \nstudents; that it failed to provide female athletes with proportional athletic financial assistance; and it \n20 \nfailed to provide female athletes with equal services such as training, travel and recruiting.  In February \n21 \n1997, plaintiff/student Julie Grandson filed suit against the University of Michigan, seeking injunctive \n22 \nand monetary damages due to  alleged  gender discrimination.  She was  a member of the women's \n23 \nvarsity soccer team.  Three months later, plaintiffs Thompson, Lindahl, and Jeffries (known collectively \n24 \nas the \"Thompson plaintiffs\") filed suit on behalf of themselves and a purported class of all similarly \n25 \nsituated female  students.  Grandson's claims were dismissed by the trial court because she failed to \n26 \ndemonstrate that she complained to University officials about alleged disparate treatment and failed to \n27 \nshow  intentional discrimination or  deliberate  disregard  for  women's athletics  in  regard  to  funding \n28 \n31 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 37 of 42\nissues.  The claims of the Thompson plaintiffs were dismissed because they either had not played a \n1 \nvarsity sport or because their N.C.A.A. eligibility had expired.  In upholding the trial court's rulings, \n2 \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals did not share the plaintiffs' vision that the judicial system act as \"a \n3 \nde-facto super-athletic department director.\" Id.  at p.  573.  Although the class certification issue was \n4 \n5  decided on a timeliness basis rather than the merits, the Court held that plaintiffs Grandson, Thompson \nand Jeffries had no standing to seek prospective injunctive relief because they had no further N.C.A.A. \n6 \neligibility, and that Lindahl lacked standing for such relief because she never played on a varsity team. \n7 \nIn this case, neither MANSOURIAN nor CHIANG have standing to seek the relief identified in their \n8 \nComplaint because their N.C.A.A. eligibility has long expired.  MANCUSO was never a member of a \n9 \nvarsity team at U.C.  Davis,  and her N.C.A.A.  eligibility will expire  prior to the time the  issue  of \n10 \ninjunctive relief will be before the Court. \n11 \nWhere class certification is sought under rule 23(b )(2), any claim for monetary damages \n12 \n13  asserted must be secondary to the claim for irljunctive or declaratory relief. Molski v. Gleich, 318 F.3d \n937,947 (9th Cir. 2003).  If Plaintiffs do not have standing to claim entitlement to injunctive relief, their \n14 \ndamages claim is limited to their request for monetary damages, which would become predominant and \n15 \nwould render a rule 23(b )(2) class improper, given the unique factual allegations giving rise to their \n16 \ndamages claim. \n17 \nSince Plaintiffs lack standing, they are not adequate class representatives. \n18 \nVII. \n19 \nPLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO CONSIDERATION OF THE PROPOSED CLASS \n20 \nAND REPRESENTATIVES IDENTIFIED IN THE COMPLAINT \n21 \nThe scope  of the pleadings defines  the  issues to  be  adjudicated in a case, including issues \n22 \n23  pertaining to  a putative class.  Wilson v.  Zarhadnick,  534  F.2d  55,  57  (5th  Cir.  1976).  In  their \n24  Complaint, the \"class plaintiffs\" allege they \"seek to represent the class of all present and future female \n25  students at U.C.  Davis who are denied equal athletic participation opportunities and scholarships in \n26  women's wrestling by Defendants'  discriminatory actions.\" (Exhibit A, ,; 108, emphasis added).  A \n27  perusal of the allegations in the Complaint shows that the vast majority of them pertain to wrestling at \n28  U.C.  Davis, not other sports.  By this motion Plaintiffs seek to  have a different class certified: \"all \n32 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 38 of 42\n1  current, prospective, and future female students at the University of California, Davis, who are denied, \n2  and all females who are deterred from enrolling at U.C. Davis because they would be denied, an equal \n3  opportunity  to  participate  in  varsity  intercollegiate  athletics  andlor  to  receive  athletic  financial \n4  assistance because of their sex.\"  This proposed definition greatly exceeds the definition set forth in the \n5  Complaint as it includes females who do, or might, have an interest in participating in any sport at U.C. \n6  Davis, not just wrestling.  While there are passing references in the Complaint about alleged inequities \n7  in athletic participation opportunities and financial assistance for females as a whole, the clear gist of \n8  the  Complaint  is  directed  toward  women  participating  in  wrestling  at  U.C.  Davis.  The  only \ndeclarations submitted in support of the motion for class certification are those of MANSOURIAN and \n9 \nMANCUSO.  Their declarations focus solely on wrestling; there is no reference to any other sport. \n10 \nNotably missing is even one declaration from a current or prospective female U.c. Davis student who \n11 \nclaims she did not or will not have the opportunity to participate in a sport other than wrestling, or was \n12 \ndenied athletic financial assistance. \n13 \nThere is also a disparity between the allegations made in the Complaint about which Plaintiffs \n14 \nshould be class representatives and the proposal regarding representatives made in this motion.  In the \n15 \nComplaint under the heading \"Class Action Allegations\", it is alleged that \"Plaintiffs MANSOURIAN \n16 \nand MANCUSO (the \"Class Plaintiffs\") bring claims I, 2, 4, 5, and 6 on behalf of themselves and on \n17 \nbehalf of those similarly situation under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(2).\"  (Exhibit \n18 \n19  £b ~ 107) CHIANG is not identified as a \"class plaintiff'.  In each of the five claims for relief asserted \non behalf of both the Plaintiffs and the putative class, the following allegation is made: \"Class Plaintiffs \n20 \nbring this claim on behalf of themselves and the above-defined class.  Plaintiffs CHRISTINE NG and \n21 \n22  NANCY CHIANG bring this claim on behalf of themselves only.\" (Exhibit A, ~~ 126,137,162,171 and \n181).  Plaintiffs have never moved to amend the Complaint to include CHIANG as a \"class plaintiff' \n23 \nand the time for doing so has long expired. (See Pre-Trial (Scheduling) Order, as amended) \n24 \nFor purposes of this motion, Plaintiffs should be bound by the definition of the proposed class \n25 \nand the identification of proposed class representatives pled in the Complaint. \n26 \n1// \n27 \n//1 \n28 \n33 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 39 of 42\n1  VIII. \n2  THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSED CLASS IS SPECULATIVE AND OVERBROAD \nMembers of an identifiable class may be determined by reference to objective criteria but not if \n3 \nmembership is contingent on the prospective member's state of mind.

Corp.,  127 F.R.D. 655, 659 (D.Il1.l989) the court declined to certify a class \nconsisting of all African Americans who were deterred or discouraged from applying for a job with the \n6 \ndefendant because it would have required an inquiry into each putative class member's state of mind. \n7 \nSimilarly, in Price v. Wilton Public Sch. District, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23139, the Court declined to \n8 \ninclude \"all future female athletes who participate, seek to participate or are deterred from participating \n9 \nin athletics\" as part of a proposed class on the ground that including such unknown persons in the class \n10 \nwould render it too broad.  In this case, the Court would have to engage in speculation on whether any \n11 \nof the girls who are currently wrestling at the high school level have an interest in pursuing the sport at \n12 \nthe collegiate level, and if so, whether they are interested in and can obtain admission to U. C. Davis. \n13 \nAs noted above, the requirements for admission to U.c. Davis are very strict.  There is no way \n14 \nto meaningfully peer into the mind of these high school girls and determine which, if any, plan to apply \n15 \nto and attend U.c. Davis, and of those, which will be admitted.  Even if the Court considered the much \n16 \nbroader proposed class of all female athletes, it would still have to engage in speculation as to which \n17 \nmembers of that class have been \"deterred\" from enrolling at U. C.  Davis because of alleged gender \n18 \ndiscrimination in athletics. \n19 \nIn addition to being speculative, the class proposed by this motion is over-broad.  In  Bryant v. \n20 \nColgate University, supra, several members of the Colgate women's ice hockey sport club brought a \n21 \nTitle IX action seeking to have ice hockey elevated to a varsity sport and claiming that Colgate did not \n22 \nprovide adequate athletic opportunities for its female students.  They sought to have the following class \n23 \ncertified:  \"all  present  and  future  Colgate  University  women  students  and  potential  students  who \n24 \nparticipate,  seek  to  participate,  and/or  are  deterred  from  participating  in  Colgate'S  intercollegiate \n25 \nathletics program.\"  The court denied certification, finding  that the proposed class included female \n26 \nstudent athletes whose interests were already being accommodated.  Further, it found that the suit was \n27 \nfocused  on  the  ice  hockey  team;  there  was  no  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  would justify \n28 \n34 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICA TION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 40 of 42\n1  declaratory or injunctive relief for any female athletes except those in the ice hockey club.  This holding \n2  is directly applicable to the issues before this Court.  Notwithstanding the broad reach of the proposed \n3  class, the focus of this litigation is on women wrestlers, not all women athletes at U.C. Davis. \n4  This action does not support certification of any proposed class.  However, if the Court has any \n5  inclination to certify a class, it should be limited to current or future female students who meet the \ncriteria for admission to U.C. Davis and who are interested in and able to participate in wrestling at the \n6 \n7  collegiate level but are unable to do so because there is not a separate women's varsity wrestling team. \n8  See Bryant v. Colgate University, supra at p. *26-28.  Plaintiffs should be required to provide further \nevidence of numerosity before such relief is granted. Id. \n9 \n10  IX. \nCONCLUSION \n11 \nThis case revolves around the experiences of four women who  participated in the wrestling \n12 \nprogram under criteria not applied to male members of the team or any other student athletes regardless \n13 \nof gender.  They did not have to tryout for the team and did not participate in regularly scheduled \n14 \n15  competition.  After a change in coaches, the women were required to try out like all other hopefuls. \nThey did not make the team.  Rather than choosing to engage in their sport at the club sport level, \n16 \nincrease their skills and then submit a proposal for elevation of women's wrestling to varsity status, \n17 \nthey filed a lawsuit.  This suit relates to their unique experiences, not the interests of a purported class \n18 \nof women athletes. \n19 \nThe women's intercollegiate athletics program at U. C. Davis is one of the best in the nation. \n20 \nNo women other than the Plaintiffs have an interest in making this a class action or having any of the \n21 \n22  Plaintiffs represent their interests.  Defendants respectfully request that the motion be denied in its \nentirety. \n23 \n1/1 \n24 \n11/ \n25 \n1/1 \n26 \n11/ \n27 \n11/ \n28 \n35 \nDEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICA TION \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 103    Filed 04/04/06   Page 41 of 42\n!f-, \n1 \nDated: April  2006  .

REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\ntunities for women in the nation’s schools and universities, so\nmuch so that a company that sells women’s athletic apparel\nnow mimics its name. See www.titlenine.com. Despite that\nrenown, the district court in this case held that a university\nthat receives federal funds cannot be held liable in damages\nfor failing effectively to accommodate the athletic interests of\nboth men and women unless the aggrieved women first pro-\nvide the appropriate university officials with notice of their\ndisadvantageous treatment and an opportunity to cure it.\nWe disagree and so, with respect to the central issue in this\ncase, reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment\non that ground. We hold as well that the defendant university\nis not entitled to summary judgment on the alternative ground\nthat it has complied with Title IX. We also reverse the order\ndismissing the plaintiffs’ equal protection claim and remand\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nArezou Mansourian, Lauren Mancuso, and Christine Wing-\nSi Ng (hereafter plaintiffs or students) are women who wres-\ntled in high school and chose to attend the University of Cali-\nfornia,  Davis  (UCD)  so  they  could  participate  in  the\nuniversity’s  acclaimed  wrestling  program,  which  had  long\nprovided opportunities for women.1 The plaintiffs participated\nin varsity wrestling and enjoyed the benefits associated with\nvarsity status: training, coaching, and laundry services; aca-\ndemic tutoring; insurance; and access to varsity facilities and\nequipment.2 UCD did not operate separate wrestling teams for\n1Nancy Chiang, an additional plaintiff named in the complaint, was on\na leave of absence from UCD when the complaint was filed. She dis-\nmissed her claims in June 2007. Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso graduated\nfrom UCD during the course of the litigation. \n2UCD disputes the very existence of a women’s varsity wrestling pro-\ngram, insisting that the plaintiffs were merely “permitted to practice with\nthe wrestling team.” UCD acknowledges, however, that the plaintiffs “par-\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2215\nmen and women; a handful of women wrestlers participated\nin what was largely a men’s team, practicing with the men\nand receiving coaching from Coach Mike Burch. \nDuring the 2000-2001 academic year, UCD eliminated all\nwomen from the wrestling team. After the students protested\nto UCD administrators and filed a complaint with the Office\nfor Civil Rights (OCR),3 UCD agreed to permit women again\nto participate in varsity wrestling. Their participation, how-\never, was conditioned on their ability to beat male wrestlers\nin their weight class, using men’s collegiate wrestling rules.\n(Prior to their elimination from the team, women wrestlers at\nUCD had competed only against other women and used inter-\nnational freestyle rules.) As a result of the new requirement\nthat they compete against men under men’s rules, the female\nstudents were unable to participate on the wrestling team and\nlost  the  benefits  associated  with  varsity  status,  including\nscholarships and academic credit. \nThe students then filed a class action against UCD and sev-\neral UCD officials in their individual and official capacities,\non  behalf  of  all  current  and  future  female  UCD  students\ndenied equal athletic participation opportunities. The plain-\ntiffs sought damages and injunctive relief under Title IX and\nalso asserted equal protection claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.4\nticipated in wrestling” and that Mansourian, at least, was “on the wrestling\nteam roster” and received varsity-associated benefits. Moreover, UCD\nlisted four female varsity wrestlers in its 1999-2000 athletics report pursu-\nant to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). View-\ning the facts in favor of the plaintiffs on UCD’s motion for summary\njudgment, we conclude that the plaintiffs were varsity wrestlers for pur-\nposes of Title IX. \n3OCR is the division of the United States Department of Education\ncharged with enforcing Title IX. \n4The Title IX claims are asserted only against the university. The indi-\nvidual  defendants  are  Larry  Vanderhoef,  University  Chancellor;  Greg\nWarzecka, Athletic Director; Pam Gill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson,\nAssociate Athletic Directors; and Robert Franks, Associate Vice Chancel-\nlor for Student Affairs. We refer to the individual defendants and the Uni-\nversity collectively as “UCD.” \n\n2216 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nJust before the scheduled hearing on class certification, the\nplaintiffs requested a stay due to their attorney’s serious ill-\nness. During the ten-month stay, Mancuso, the only named\nplaintiff still attending UCD at that point, graduated. As soon\nas the stay ended, the plaintiffs moved to add as plaintiffs\nthree  students,  Kelsey  Brust,  Laura  Ludwig,  and  Jessica\nBulala, all still enrolled at UCD. The district court refused to\nallow the amendment, holding that the plaintiffs failed to meet\nthe good cause required under Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\ndure 16 when such a motion is filed after the issuance of a\nscheduling order. See Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc.,\n975 F.2d 604, 607-08 (9th Cir. 1992). Without any named\nplaintiffs currently attending UCD, the plaintiffs stipulated to\ndismissal of the class claims for injunctive relief. \nThe district court subsequently dismissed the § 1983 claim\nas “subsumed” by the Title IX claim, citing Middlesex County\nSewer Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass’n., 453 U.S.\n1 (1981). The district court then granted UCD’s motion for\nsummary judgment, holding that the students were required,\nto perfect their claim, to give UCD notice in advance of filing\nsuit of the alleged Title IX violation and an opportunity to\ncure it, and had failed to do so. The students timely appealed.\nANALYSIS\nWe review de novo the district court’s dismissal on the\npleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), Dunlap v. Credit Protection\nAss’n, L.P., 419 F.3d 1011, 1012 n.1 (9th Cir. 2005), as well\nas the grant of summary judgment. Avista Corp. Inc. v. Wolfe,\n549 F.3d 1239, 1246 (9th Cir. 2008). We review the denial of\na motion to amend under Rule 16(b) for abuse of discretion.\nNoyes  v.  Kelly  Servs.,  488  F.3d  1163,  1174  n.6  (9th  Cir.\n2006). \nBefore proceeding to discuss the merits of this case, we\nconsider whether we have jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs’\nchallenge to the district court’s denial of their motion to add\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2217\nBrust, Bulala, and Ludwig as plaintiffs. We hold that this\nissue is moot and so beyond our jurisdiction, for the reasons\nwe now explain. \n[1] After  the  district  court  denied  the  motion,  Brust,\nBulala, and Ludwig initiated a separate lawsuit against UCD.\nThe district court certified a class of “[a]ll present, prospec-\ntive, and future women students at [UCD] who seek to partici-\npate  in  and/or  who  are  deterred  from  participating  in\nintercollegiate athletics at [UCD].” Stipulated Judgment and\nOrder at 1, Brust v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 07-1488\n(E.D. Cal. Oct. 19, 2009). The parties to the Brust action\nreached a settlement, approved by the district court, which\n“resolves all class member claims for injunctive relief.” Id. at\n10. Moreover, Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala have now graduated\nfrom UCD. It is therefore apparent that, even if the district\ncourt had erred in denying the motion to add Brust, Ludwig,\nand Bulala initially, which we do not decide, they would no\nlonger be appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation for the pur-\nposes of injunctive relief, as the current plaintiffs recognize.\nSee Flint v. Dennison, 488 F.3d 816, 824 (9th Cir. 2007)\n(“Generally, once a student graduates, he no longer has a live\ncase or controversy justifying declaratory and injunctive relief\nagainst a school’s action or policy, and his case is therefore\nmoot.”); Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch., 228 F.3d 1092,\n1099 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding, where the two original plain-\ntiffs had graduated and a third, later-joined plaintiff subse-\nquently  graduated  before  the  appeal,  that  all  three  lacked\nstanding to seek injunctive relief).\nThe plaintiffs contend, however, that the Brust settlement\ndoes not preclude current female students from seeking the\nspecific injunctive relief — not awarded as part of the Brust\nsettlement — of restoring the women’s wrestling program.\nThat may be so; we need not decide whether it is or not. There\nare no current students in this case seeking that relief; no\nidentified, current students looking to intervene in this case to\nseek that relief; and no identified, current students whom the\n\n2218 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nplaintiffs seek to add to the case for purposes of obtaining that\nrelief. \n[2] We therefore may not reach the merits of the claim that\nthe district court improperly denied the motion to add new\nplaintiffs,  as  there  is  presently  no  cognizable  dispute  that\nwould be affected by such a determination.5 See, e.g., McQuil-\nlion v. Schwarzenegger, 369 F.3d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(holding that a prisoner’s successful habeas petition and sub-\nsequent  relief  rendered  moot  his  claim  for  injunctive  and\ndeclaratory relief under § 1983); Porter v. Jones, 319 F.3d\n483, 489 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that a case or issue becomes\nmoot when “the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in\nthe outcome” (quotation omitted)); Di Giorgio v. Lee (In re\nDi Giorgio), 134 F.3d 971, 974 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that\ntenants’ challenge to a state statute permitting their eviction\nwas moot after they voluntarily vacated the property).\n[3] Turning to the merits of the students’ damages claims,\nwe begin by setting out the statutory and regulatory frame-\nwork governing Title IX athletics cases. Title IX provides that\n[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of\nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n5The parties did not inform this court before oral argument that (1) the\nputative additional plaintiffs had also all graduated and (2) those plaintiffs\nhad settled their separate lawsuit for class injunctive relief and were await-\ning approval of that settlement by the district court. We as judges take our\nresponsibilities  seriously,  preparing  carefully  before  argument  on  all\nissues presented in the briefs. Where, as here, the complexion of the case\nhas entirely changed while the appeal is pending, counsel for both parties\nhave an obligation to so inform the court. That is so even if a party\nbelieves it has a basis for arguing that the issue should still be decided. \nNo such notice of changed circumstances was given here. Instead, the\npanel learned only at argument that Brust, Ludwig, and Bulala had gradu-\nated, and learned only after independent post-argument research that there\nwas a motion pending, to be heard in a matter of days, for approval of a\nsettlement for broad-ranging injunctive relief in the Brust litigation. \n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2219\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance.\n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). As applied to intercollegiate athletics,\nthe Department of Education’s Title IX regulations interpret\nthe statute as requiring funding recipients to “provide equal\nathletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 106.41(c).6 \n[4] The regulations establish two components of Title IX’s\nequal athletic opportunity requirement: “effective accommo-\ndation”  and  “equal  treatment.”  “Effective  accommodation”\nTitle IX requirements derive from the Title IX regulation at\n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1), which bases Title IX compliance in\npart on whether “the selection of sports and levels of competi-\ntion  effectively  accommodate  the  interests  and  abilities  of\nmembers of both sexes.”7 The “equal treatment” Title IX stan-\ndard, in contrast, derives from 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)-(10),\nwhich has been interpreted by OCR to require “equivalence\nin the availability, quality and kinds of other athletic benefits\nand  opportunities  provided  male  and  female  athletes.”8\n6The existence of a private right of action to enforce Title IX is well-\nestablished and not at issue in this case. See Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago,\n441 U.S. 677 (1979). \n7“Effective accommodation” as a doctrine within Title IX jurisprudence\nis analytically distinct from similarly titled doctrines under other statutes\n— for example, the obligation to “mak[e] reasonable accommodations to\nthe known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individ-\nual with a disability” under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12112(b)(5). \n8The regulation requires OCR to consider, in assessing whether equal\nopportunities are available to students of both sexes: \nThe provision of equipment and supplies; [s]cheduling of games\nand practice time; [t]ravel and per diem allowance; [o]pportunity\nto receive coaching and academic tutoring; [a]ssignment and\ncompensation of coaches and tutors; [p]rovision of locker rooms,\npractice and competitive facilities; [p]rovision of medical and\ntraining facilities and services; [p]rovision of housing and dining\nfacilities and services; [p]ublicity. \n34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c). \n\n2220 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nDepartment of Education Office for Civil Rights, Clarification\nof Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part\nTest  (Clarification)  (1996),  available  at  http://www.ed.gov/\nabout/offices/list/ocr/docs/clarific.html.  Effective  accommo-\ndation claims thus concern the opportunity to participate in\nathletics, while equal treatment claims allege sex-based differ-\nences in the schedules, equipment, coaching, and other factors\naffecting participants in athletics. See McCormick v. Sch. Dist.\nof Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 299 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding\nthat a competition schedule permitting male but not female\nhigh school soccer players to participate in state and regional\nchampionships  deprived  female  players  of  equal  treatment\nunder Title IX); see also Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213\nF.3d 858, 865 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000) (explaining the relationship\nbetween  effective  accommodation  and  equal  treatment\nclaims); Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 115 n.1 (2d\nCir. 1999) (same). So “an institution may violate Title IX\nsolely by failing to accommodate effectively the interests and\nabilities of student athletes of both sexes,” even if the benefits\nprovided athletes of both sexes are equivalent.

See supra note 8.\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2221\nsee Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 612 (1974), and the\nresulting three-part test gives universities three options for\ndemonstrating compliance with Title IX: (1) showing substan-\ntial proportionality (the number of women in intercollegiate\nathletics is proportionate to their enrollment); (2) proving that\nthe institution has a “history and continuing practice of pro-\ngram expansion” for the underrepresented sex (in this case,\nwomen); or (3) where the university cannot satisfy either of\nthe first two options, establishing that it nonetheless “fully\nand effectively accommodate[s]” the interests of women. 44\nFed. Reg. 71,418.\n[5] Funding recipients can satisfy any of the three options\nto comply with Title IX. UCD claims to have satisfied the\nsecond option by showing a history and continuing practice of\nprogram expansion.11 Compliance with this option “focuses\non whether an institution has expanded the number of inter-\ncollegiate  participation  opportunities”  for  women,  but  pro-\nvides institutions “flexibility in choosing which teams [they]\nadd[ ].” Clarification nn. 2-3. The number of “participation\nopportunities” for women is defined by the number of female\nathletes actually playing intercollegiate sports.\nThe district court determined that the plaintiffs had ade-\nquately pleaded a claim for effective accommodation under\nTitle IX by alleging that UCD “chooses to make fewer ath-\nletic participation opportunities [available] to female students\nthan to male students.” The district court did not, however,\nreach the merits of whether UCD complied with Option Two,\ninstead concluding that “money damages cannot be awarded\nunless a plaintiff has given notice of and an opportunity to\nrectify the specific violation alleged by a Title IX plaintiff.”\nFinding that the plaintiffs had failed to provide such notice,\nthe district court granted summary judgment to UCD. \n11The record does not demonstrate that UCD has complied with either\nOption One or Option Three, and UCD does not contend that it has. \n\n2222 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nThis circuit has yet to address whether any such require-\nment applies in the athletics context. We conclude that it does\nnot. \n[6] UCD’s notice argument, adopted by the district court,\nproceeds  by  analogy  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  holding  that\nnotice and an opportunity to cure a violation is an essential\nprecursor to a sexual harassment suit for damages under Title\nIX. We therefore begin by discussing the pertinent Title IX\nsexual harassment cases. As will appear, the analogy between\nthis case and those is not apt.\nThe starting point for this inquiry is Franklin v. Gwinnett\nCounty Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), in which the\ndefendant  school  district  was  aware  of  a  teacher’s  sexual\nharassment of a student but took no action to stop it. The\nCourt recognized that Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.\nHalderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28-29 (1981), precludes the award of\ndamages for unintentional violations of statutes, like Title IX,\nenacted  pursuant  to  Congress’s  spending  authority.  See\nFranklin, 503 U.S. at 74. Franklin held, however, that the\nfailure to halt harassment of which a school district is aware\nconstitutes  intentional  discrimination  for  which  monetary\ndamages are an appropriate remedy. Id. at 75-76. \nGebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S.\n274 (1998), further defined the scope of a school’s monetary\nliability under Title IX for inaction in the face of serious sex-\nual harassment. In Gebser, the Court held that principles of\nrespondeat superior and constructive notice are inadequate to\nimpose Title IX liability on a school district for a teacher’s\nsexual abuse of a high school student. Id. at 285. Noting that\nTitle IX’s express enforcement scheme, termination of federal\nfunding, requires “an opportunity for voluntary compliance”\nbefore  suspending  or  terminating  funding,  see  20  U.S.C.\n§ 1682, Gebser held that the judicially implied private right of\naction similarly should not impose liability “without regard to\nthe  recipient’s  knowledge  or  its  corrective  actions  upon\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2223\nreceiving notice.” Id. at 289. Monetary damages premised on\nconstructive notice or respondeat superior for sexual harass-\nment, the Court held in Gebser, would entail a risk that “the\nrecipient of funds was unaware of the discrimination.” Id. at\n287. Rather, \nin cases like this one that do not involve official pol-\nicy of the recipient entity, . . . a damages remedy will\nnot lie under Title IX unless an official who . . . has\nauthority to address the alleged discrimination and to\ninstitute corrective measures . . . has actual knowl-\nedge of discrimination . . . and fails adequately to\nrespond.\nId. at 290 (emphasis added). \n[7] Critically for present purposes, Gebser does not make\npre-litigation notice of an alleged violation a prerequisite to\nrecovery  in  every  Title  IX  case,  or  even  in  every  sexual\nharassment case. Proof of actual notice is required only when\nthe alleged Title IX violation consists of an institution’s delib-\nerate indifference to acts that “do not involve official policy\nof the recipient entity.” Id. In sexual harassment cases, it is\nthe deliberate failure to curtail known harassment, rather than\nthe harassment itself, that constitutes the intentional Title IX\nviolation.12 See Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526\nU.S. 629, 641 (1999) (holding that Gebser permits the plain-\ntiff “to hold the Board liable for its own decision to remain\nidle in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its\nschools.”). The Tenth Circuit has held that a corollary of this\nprinciple is that where the official policy is one of deliberate\nindifference to a known overall risk of sexual harassment,\nnotice of a particular harassment situation and an opportunity\n12The harassment itself may be actionable under state law or 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 292. \n\n2224 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nto cure it are not predicates for liability. See Simpson v. Univ.\nof Colo. Boulder, 500 F.3d 1170 (10th Cir. 2007).13 \n[8] Consistent with the reasoning underlying Gebser, the\nSupreme Court has made clear that no notice requirement is\napplicable to Title IX claims that rest on an affirmative insti-\ntutional decision. Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education,\n544 U.S. 167 (2005), held that a high school athletics coach\nfired in retaliation for complaining about discrimination in\nathletics funding had a private right of action under Title IX.\nThe Court held that no pre-litigation notice is required in the\nretaliation context. In Gebser and Davis, the Court stated, “we\nemphasized that [the notice] limitation on private damages\nactions is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient inten-\ntionally violates the statute.” Id. at 182 (quotation omitted).\nAs retaliation is “easily attributable to the funding recipient\nand it is always — by definition — intentional,” id., the Court\nallowed Jackson’s retaliation claim to proceed without regard\nto whether adequate pre-litigation notice and opportunity to\ncure the violation had been provided.\n[9] Universities’  decisions  with  respect  to  athletics  are\neven more “easily attributable to the funding recipient and . . .\nalways — by definition — intentional,” id. at 183, than the\nretaliation  in  Jackson.  Institutions,  not  individual  actors,\n13 Simpson concerned two female University of Colorado (CU) students\nsexually assaulted by football players and high school football recruits.\nThe Tenth Circuit held that Gebser’s notice standard did not apply. The\nrecord supported the finding that the head football coach was aware of\n“the serious risk of sexual . . . assault during college-football recruiting\nefforts [and] that such assaults had indeed occurred during CU recruiting\nvisits,” Simpson, 500 F.3d at 1184, and that, although the Boulder District\nAttorney’s office had recommended a policy to curb such assaults after a\nprevious incident involving recruits, the policy was not followed and CU\ncontinued to sponsor an “unsupervised player-host program to show high-\nschool recruits ‘a good time.’ ” Id. The court held this sequence of events\nsatisfied  the  “official  policy”  element  of  Gebser  and  that  a  woman\nassaulted thereafter need provide no separate notice and opportunity to\ncure before filing suit. \n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2225\ndecide how to allocate resources between male and female\nathletic teams. Decisions to create or eliminate teams or to\nadd or decrease roster slots for male or female athletes are\nofficial decisions, not practices by individual students or staff.\nAthletic programs that fail effectively to accommodate stu-\ndents of both sexes thus represent “official policy of the recip-\nient  entity”  and  so  are  not  covered  by  Gebser’s  notice\nrequirement. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290.\nMoreover, a judicially imposed notice requirement would\nbe superfluous in light of universities’ ongoing obligations to\ncertify compliance with Title IX’s athletics requirements and\nto track athletics gender equity data. OCR regulations require\nfunding recipients to evaluate their policies and certify, as a\ncondition for receiving funds, that they are “tak[ing] whatever\nremedial action is necessary . . to eliminate . . . discrimina-\ntion.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.4; see also id. § 106.3. UCD and other\nfunding recipients therefore have an affirmative obligation to\nensure compliance with at least one prong of the three-part\neffective accommodation test. \nThe Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) further\nrequires federally funded universities to report to the Depart-\nment of Education and make available to students the number\nof undergraduates and athletes, broken down by sex, as well\nas sex-segregated data on operating expenses, coach salaries,\nathletic scholarships, recruiting expenditures, and revenues.\n20 U.S.C. § 1092(g). UCD’s EADA reports contain ample\ndata demonstrating that it could not satisfy the substantial pro-\nportionality option and that the trend of increasing female ath-\nletic participation reversed after 2001, indicating that UCD\nmay not have had a continuing practice of program expansion.\nThus, where the alleged harm is unequal provision of athletic\nopportunity, the notice requirement would not supply univer-\nsities  with  information  of  which  they  are  legitimately\nunaware. See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 289. \n[10] We  conclude  for  these  reasons  that  pre-litigation\nnotice and opportunity to cure is not necessary in cases alleg-\n\n2226 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\ning unequal provision of athletic opportunities in violation of\nTitle  IX.  Applying  the  notice  requirement  to  institutional\ndecisions would contravene the clear language of Gebser and\nits progeny. It would also be inconsistent with funding recipi-\nents’  affirmative  obligations  to  provide  nondiscriminatory\nathletic participation opportunities and continually to assess\nand certify compliance with Title IX. \nThe Fifth Circuit has reached the same conclusion we do,\nholding that\nthe requirement in the sexual harassment cases —\nthat the academic institution have actual knowledge\nof the sexual harassment — is not applicable for pur-\nposes of determining whether an academic institu-\ntion intentionally discriminated on the basis of sex\nby denying females equal athletic opportunity. . . . In\nthe instant case, it is the institution itself that is dis-\ncriminating.\nPederson, 213 F.3d at 882. The Eighth Circuit, the only other\ncircuit to address the issue, has assumed, without any analy-\nsis, that Gebser’s notice requirement applies equally to Title\nIX cases where plaintiffs allege discrimination in the adminis-\ntration of an athletic program. Grandson v. Univ. of Minn,,\n272  F.3d  568,  575  (8th  Cir.  2001).  But  the  plaintiffs  in\nGrandson did not argue otherwise, id., and the Eighth Circuit\nreached the merits of a later Title IX athletics case without\nmentioning Grandson, Gebser, or the notice requirement. See\nChalenor, 291 F.3d 1042. It is therefore far from clear that\nGrandson is controlling even in the Eighth Circuit. If it is,\nthen the circuits are already split on the issue, and we find the\nFifth Circuit’s holding (and that of the Tenth Circuit in Simp-\nson, on a different but related issue) the more persuasive, for\nreasons already surveyed. \n[11] We therefore join the Fifth Circuit in holding that\nGebser’s notice requirement is inapplicable to cases alleging\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2227\nthat a funding recipient has failed effectively to accommodate\nwomen’s  interest  in  athletics.  The  district  court’s  decision\ngranting summary judgment on that basis is reversed.\nUCD also moved for summary judgment on the grounds\nthat the record demonstrated “a history and continuing prac-\ntice of program expansion” for women that satisfied Option\nTwo of the three-part test. Although the district court granted\nsummary judgment on the notice grounds discussed above,\nUCD contends that we could, alternatively, affirm the district\ncourt’s decision on the merits. See Atel Fin. Corp. v. Quaker\nCoal Co., 321 F.3d 924, 926 (9th Cir. 2003). That is so, but\nonly if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nstudents, there are no genuine issues of material fact concern-\ning UCD’s compliance with Option Two. See, e.g., Becerril\nv. Pima County Assessor’s Office, 587 F.3d 1162, 1163 (9th\nCir. 2009). On the record before us we cannot affirm on this\nalternative ground.\n[12] In assessing compliance with Option Two, we must,\nunder the Clarification, focus on both the institution’s record\nof adding female participation opportunities and its current\n“plan of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive\nto the developing interests and abilities” of women. “History”\nand “continuing practice” thus constitute two separate inqui-\nries. We conclude that the undisputed facts fall short of dem-\nonstrating  UCD’s  compliance  with  either  facet  of  Option\nTwo.\n[13] The  Clarification  specifies  the  following  factors  as\nevidence of an institution’s history of program expansion:\n[A]n  institution’s  record  of  adding  intercollegiate\nteams, or upgrading teams to intercollegiate status,\nfor [women]; an institution’s record of increasing the\nnumber  of  participants  in  intercollegiate  athletics\nwho are [women]; and an institution’s affirmative\n\n2228 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nresponses to requests by students or others for addi-\ntion or elevation of sports. \nThe Option Two analysis focuses primarily, but not exclu-\nsively, on increasing the number of women athletes rather\nthan increasing the number of women’s teams. “OCR will\nassess whether past actions of the institution have expanded\nparticipation opportunities for the underrepresented sex . . .”\n(emphasis added). The number of “participation opportuni-\nties” is defined by the number of female athletes actually\nplaying intercollegiate sports.\nUCD had seven women’s teams in 1970 and added another\nin 1974, thereby increasing the number of female varsity ath-\nletes. The record indicates that UCD did not further expand\nparticipation opportunities for women until 1996. The 1991\nReport of the UCD Title IX Review Committee (Report) indi-\ncated that UCD did not comprehensively review its compli-\nance with Title IX between 1976 and 1991. The Report also\nstated that since 1976, UCD had added two women’s sports\n(soccer and cross country track) but dropped two (golf and\nfield  hockey).14  The  Report  concluded  that  UCD’s  record\n“cannot be termed a demonstrably responsive process of pro-\ngram expansion . . . particularly when female participation\nrelative to male participation has been decreasing over the\npast three years.” Internal UCD memoranda from directors of\nthe athletics program suggest that the numerical participation\ngap continued to grow over the next two years.15\n14UCD does not dispute that it eliminated field hockey but denies that\nit eliminated a women’s golf team, asserting that UCD “attempted” to start\na women’s golf team in the 1970s that “never got off the ground.” Draw-\ning all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs, as we must, we\ncredit UCD’s internal report as accurately describing the elimination of a\nwomen’s golf team. \n15In 1992 an associate athletic director warned of a “backward slide in\ncompliance,” and in 1993 UCD’s acting athletic director noted that “the\nratio of women participating has decreased slightly in recent years.” \n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2229\nIn 1995, UCD decided to add three women’s varsity teams.\nThe university reviewed proposals from five women’s club\nteams and elevated water polo, crew and lacrosse to varsity\nstatus. When the three new teams began competing the fol-\nlowing year, the number of female athletes rose from 211 to\n348,  with  the  difference  between  female  enrollment  and\nfemale participation in athletics dropping from twenty percent\nto eleven percent. \nUCD represents that it created another women’s varsity\nteam, indoor track, in 1999. The addition of indoor track,\nhowever, cannot be considered evidence of program expan-\nsion. It did nothing to expand the number of female athletes,\nas all the women participating in indoor track also partici-\npated in an existing varsity sport. See Cohen v. Brown Univ.,\n809 F. Supp. 978, 991 (D.R.I. 1992), aff’d, 991 F.2d 888 (1st\nCir. 1993) (dismissing the alleged addition of winter track as\n“a sport that merely involved providing indoor space to the\nexisting women’s track team”). Nonetheless, the number of\nwomen athletes did continue to rise. In the 1999-2000 school\nyear, women varsity athletes at UCD reached a historic high\nin both total numbers and proportion of female athletes to\nenrolled women students.\nSubsequently,  however,  the  number  of  women  playing\nintercollegiate athletics dropped sharply. Meanwhile, in the\nten  years  since  UCD  last  added  a  significant  number  of\nfemale varsity slots, the number of female students at UCD\ngrew by 35%. Rather than keeping pace with this growth in\nwomen’s enrollment, the number of female athletes fluctuated\nbut never regained the apex it reached in 2000. \n[14] In  sum,  UCD  expanded  varsity  opportunities  for\nwomen only between 1996 and 2000. UCD’s elimination of\nwomen from the varsity wrestling team thus took place in the\ncontext of an overall contraction of female athletic participa-\ntion  opportunities  that  began  in  2000.16  UCD’s  post-2000\n16As noted, supra note 2, the plaintiffs have submitted sufficient facts\nshowing the existence of female varsity wrestling opportunities to survive\n\n2230 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nstrategy for sports equality between the sexes appears to have\nconsisted of reducing varsity athletics overall, and in the pro-\ncess reducing men’s participation more than women’s partici-\npation  by  using  “roster  management”  to  limit  the  size  of\nmen’s teams. The Clarification explicitly precludes consider-\ning such reductions as evidencing program expansion:\nOCR will not find a history and continuing practice\nof program expansion where an institution increases\nthe  proportional  participation  opportunities  for\n[women] by reducing opportunities for [men] alone\nor by reducing participation opportunities for [men]\nto a proportionately greater degree than for [women].\n. . . [Option Two] considers an institution’s good\nfaith remedial efforts through actual program expan-\nsion. . . . Cuts in the program for [women], even\nwhen coupled with cuts in the program for [men],\ncannot be considered remedial because they burden\nmembers of the sex already disadvantaged by the\npresent program.\n[15] An institution that has eliminated some participation\nopportunities for women can still satisfy Option Two if the\nsummary judgment. UCD’s subsequent decision to permit women to com-\npete against men for a slot on the team does not affect our analysis. By\nrequiring women to prevail against men, the university changed the condi-\ntions under which women could participate in varsity wrestling in a man-\nner that foreseeably precluded their future participation. \nUCD’s contention that it “ha[d] not declared wrestling to be a contact\nsport” does not advance its position. First, wrestling is a contact sport\nunder OCR regulations. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b). While women must be per-\nmitted to try out for all-male teams if there is no women’s team in that\nsport, this requirement is waived for contact sports. Id. But the contact-\nsport “exemption did not give [UCD] license to discriminate against [the\nplaintiffs] because of their sex once [UCD] decided to allow [them] to join\nthe team.” Mercer v. Duke Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 202 (4th Cir. 2005) (cita-\ntion omitted). \n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2231\nelimination is offset by a strong history of program expansion.\nIn UCD’s case, however, the elimination of women’s wres-\ntling opportunities occurred in the context of a women’s ath-\nletics program that was, at best, stagnant. We therefore hold\nthat UCD has not had a history of program expansion for\nwomen and so did not satisfy Option Two through such a his-\ntory.\nThe 1996 Clarification lists two factors that may indicate a\ncontinuing practice of program expansion: \n[A]n institution’s current implementation of a non-\ndiscriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the\naddition of sports (including the elevation of club or\nintramural teams) and the effective communication\nof the policy or procedure to students; and an institu-\ntion’s current implementation of a plan of program\nexpansion that is responsive to developing interests\nand abilities.\nThe record contains undisputed evidence that UCD has a\nprocedure for requesting additional varsity sports and effec-\ntively communicates that procedure to students. According to\nthe procedure distributed to students, the “primary factor” in\nUCD’s evaluation of proposals to create new varsity teams is\nthe “[o]verall impact on intercollegiate program gender equi-\nty.” In 2003, UCD received detailed applications from mem-\nbers of four women’s club sports (bowling, horse polo, field\nhockey, and rugby) seeking elevation to varsity status. These\napplications indicate that students are aware of the opportu-\nnity to request new varsity athletic opportunities.17 \n17UCD points to its Title IX Compliance Officer and grievance proce-\ndure as evidence of a practice of program expansion. As both are required\nby OCR regulations, 34 C.F.R. § 106.8, and neither affects the number of\nfemale athletes or teams, they do not indicate program expansion for pur-\nposes of Option Two. \n\n2232 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nThe 2003 application was the field hockey club team’s sec-\nond attempt to regain varsity status. An earlier application\nwas rejected in 1995. At that time, the Title IX Advisory\nCommittee  advocated  elevating  lacrosse  rather  than  field\nhockey to varsity status but noted that field hockey had “de-\nveloped strong interest from students” and was “a relatively\nstrong NCAA sport,” with three Division I teams competing\nat  nearby  universities.  The  committee  recommended  that\n“[s]hould gender equity not be achieved by the addition of the\nthree sports proposed, and funding be available in the future,\nfield hockey would be considered a prime candidate for addi-\ntion to the ICA program in the future.” \nWhen field hockey club players applied for varsity status in\n2003, however, their application was again denied. In fact,\nUCD rejected all four club team applications, even though all\napplicants were evaluated as “successful” and “active” club\nteams with “a long tradition of participation.” Instead, UCD\ndecided to create a women’s golf team at the behest of the\nmen’s golf coach.\nUCD contends that the fact that golf was proposed by the\nmen’s golf coach rather than female students is irrelevant. We\ndisagree. Universities are free to consider applications from\nindividuals other than students, and it is appropriate to evalu-\nate interest at the high school level as well as among current\nUCD students. A funding recipient can only satisfy Option\nTwo,  however,  by  showing  an  expansion  of  participation\nopportunities that is “demonstrably responsive to [women’s]\ndeveloping interests and abilities . . . includ[ing] interests that\nalready exist at the institution.” The fact that there were no\nwomen currently attending UCD who were interested enough\nin golf to participate at the club level or to request varsity sta-\ntus suggests that the addition of golf instead of field hockey,\nbowling,  horse  polo  or  rugby  was  not  “demonstratively\nresponsive” to the interests of current female students.\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2233\nMoreover,  UCD’s  selection  of  golf,  which  added  only\nseven participation opportunities for women, was at odds with\nits stated priority of taking a significant step toward overall\ngender equity. Elevating horse polo, rugby or field hockey\nwould have added far more female varsity athletes.18 \nWe recognize that budgetary constraints often prevent uni-\nversities from creating new teams and adding varsity slots.\nBut  “Title  IX  does  not  require  that  a  school  pour  ever-\nincreasing  sums  into  its  athletic  establishment.”  Cohen  v.\nBrown  Univ.,  991  F.2d  at  898-99  n.15.  Universities  may\nachieve compliance by reducing men’s athletic slots until par-\nticipation  rates  become  substantially  proportionate  to  the\nundergraduate population. Id.; Neal, 198 F.3d at 771; Kelley,\n35 F.3d at 270; Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830. They may not, how-\never, maintain varsity teams for male students while denying\nfemale students comparable “opportunities to enjoy the thrill\nof victory, the agony of defeat, and the many tangible benefits\nthat flow from just being given a chance to participate in\nintercollegiate athletics.” Neal, 198 F.3d at 773. \n[16] UCD took a significant step towards Title IX compli-\nance by adding three women’s teams in 1996, but Option Two\nrequires more than a single step. It requires evidence of con-\ntinuous progress toward the mandate of gender equality that\nTitle IX has imposed on funding recipients for the past thirty\nyears. The record before us does not contain undisputed facts\nshowing a history and continuing practice of program expan-\nsion that is responsive to women’s interests. \n[17] We conclude that the grant of summary judgment to\nUCD cannot be affirmed on the alternative merits ground that\nUCD complies with Title IX’s requirement of providing equal\nathletic opportunities to students of both sexes.\n18UCD’s review committee estimated that field hockey would add 22\nfemale athletes; horse polo, 35; rugby, 30 to 40. Bowling would have\nadded 12 to 15. \n\n2234 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\nThe students also sue under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that\nUCD violates the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining an\nathletics program that discriminates on the basis of gender.\nThe district court dismissed the claim because it determined\nthat “Title IX’s enforcement scheme is sufficiently compre-\nhensive to . . . demonstrate that Congress intended to preclude\n§ 1983 claims when it enacted this statute.” \n[18] Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee, 129 S. Ct.\n788 (2009), decided after the district court dismissed the stu-\ndents’ claims, held, to the contrary, that Title IX does not bar\n§ 1983  suits  to  enforce  rights  under  the  Equal  Protection\nClause. As in Fitzgerald, the plaintiffs here invoke § 1983 to\nseek damages for violations of constitutional rights. See id. at\n796-97 (explaining distinctions between the rights created by\nTitle IX and those afforded by the Equal Protection Clause).\nThe defendants concede that the district court ruling does\nnot survive Fitzgerald but urge us to affirm dismissal of the\n§ 1983 claim on other grounds. We decline to do so, for rea-\nsons we now explain.\nUCD first contends that the § 1983 claim for damages is\nprecluded by the statute of limitations and that the district\ncourt did not address this argument. In fact, the district court\nconsidered and rejected the statute of limitations defense as to\nboth the Title IX effective accommodation and § 1983 equal\nprotection claims in response to UCD’s original motion to\ndismiss. The court held that because the students claimed that\nthey were “currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly\nsex discriminatory practices . . . their claims accrue each and\nevery day they are denied equal access to athletic participa-\ntion.” \n[19] The district court was quite correct. Section 1983 “is\npresumptively available to remedy a state’s ongoing violation\nof federal law.” AlohaCare v. Haw. Dep’t. of Human Servs.,\n572 F.3d 740, 745 (9th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted). A\n\nMANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 2235\nplaintiff  has  adequately  pled  an  ongoing  claim  if  she  can\n“show a systematic policy or practice that operated, in part,\nwithin  the  limitations  period  —  a  systematic  violation.”\nDouglas v. Cal. Dep’t. of Youth Auth., 271 F.3d 812, 822 (9th\nCir. 2001) (quotation omitted); see also Gutowsky v. County\nof Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding plain-\ntiff’s § 1983 claims timely because she alleged “widespread\npolicy and practices of discrimination [that] continued every\nday of her employment, including days that fall within the\nlimitation period”).19 A university’s ongoing and intentional\nfailure to provide equal athletic opportunities for women is a\nsystemic violation. As the plaintiffs were students and there-\nfore subject to the policy that allegedly discriminated on the\nbasis of sex at the time they filed their complaint, their § 1983\nclaim is not time-barred.\n[20] UCD next urges this court to conclude that the § 1983\nclaim against the individual defendants is precluded by the\ndoctrine of qualified immunity. The defendants, however, did\nnot raise a qualified immunity defense in any of their disposi-\ntive  motions  before  the  district  court.20  Our  discretion  to\naffirm on grounds other than those relied on by the district\ncourt extends to issues raised in a manner providing the dis-\ntrict court an opportunity to rule on it. See Proctor v. Vishay\nIntertechnology, Inc., 584 F.3d 1208, 1226 (9th Cir. 2009);\nWashington  v.  Confederated  Bands  and  Tribes  of  Yakima\nIndian Nation, 439 U.S. 463, 478 n.20 (1979) (“[T]he prevail-\ning party . . . was of course free to defend its judgment on any\nground properly raised below whether or not that ground was\nrelied upon, rejected, or even considered by the District Court.\n19Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002), held\nthat each “[d]iscrete act[ ] such as termination, failure to promote, denial\nof transfer or refusal to hire . . . constitutes a separate actionable ‘unlawful\n. . . practice’ ” for the purposes of triggering the statute of limitations\nperiod in a Title VII case. Morgan left undisturbed our case law governing\ncontinuing systemic violations. \n20UCD raised a qualified immunity defense in its answer to the stu-\ndents’ complaint but never litigated it thereafter. \n\n2236 MANSOURIAN v. REGENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\n. . .”) (emphasis added). As the district court has had no\nopportunity to rule on the individual defendants’ qualified\nimmunity defense, we will not affirm on that basis. The dis-\nmissal of the students’ § 1983 claim is therefore reversed.\nCONCLUSION\n[21] For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion to\namend  their  complaint  is  dismissed  as  moot.  The  district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the\nTitle IX claim is reversed. The district court’s order dismiss-\ning the equal protection § 1983 claim is also reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.",

(ER 7-28.)[FN1] That final judgment was entered on April 23, 2008. (ER 6.) Plaintiffs timely filed their \nnotice of appeal on May 22, 2008. (ER 1-5.) Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). \n \nFN1. References to “ER” are to Appellants' Excerpts of the Record, which are being filed concurrently he-\nrewith. \n \nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES FOR REVIEW \n \n1. DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN GRANTING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS \nUNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983 FOR DAMAGES BASED UPON VIOLATIONS OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION \nCLAUSE? \n(YES.) \n2. DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT TO \nADD CURRENTLY ENROLLED STUDENTS? \n(YES.) \n3. DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN APPLYING THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT OF TITLE IX SEXUAL \nHARASSMENT CASES TO PLAINTIFFS' CLAIM THAT DEFENDANT VIOLATED TITLE IX BY FAILING \nTO PROVIDE EQUAL ATHLETIC OPPORTUNITIES? \n(YES.) \n4. DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR IN HOLDING THAT NO MATERIAL ISSUE OF FACT EXISTED AS TO \nWHETHER ANY SUCH NOTICE WAS GIVEN IN THIS CASE? \n(YES.) \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nThis case is rooted in the University of California at Davis' (“UCD”) long history of discriminating against women by \nfailing to provide equal athletic opportunities to its female students, including Plaintiffs, as required by the Equal \nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendments, as enforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Title IX of the Education \nAmendment of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et. seq. Despite a continuing and steady growth of women's interest in sports \nsince the enactment of Title IX, UCD has repeatedly refused to “fully and effectively accommodate” that interest as \nthat law requires. For Plaintiffs, this case is about UCD's denial of their opportunity to fully participate in campus life \nat UCD because they are women. It is about the denial of their opportunity to participate in women's wrestling - an \nopportunity that existed for years for women at UCD - which was arbitrarily stripped away from them and never \nrestored, and about UCD's refusal to equally accommodate women in its athletics program as a whole. \n \nPlaintiffs filed their Complaint as a proposed class action on December 18, 2003. (ER 6407-62.) The Complaint \ncharged that Defendant Regents of the University of California and certain officials at UCD had been and were con-\ntinuing to discriminate against women in UCD's athletics program.[FN2] (Id.) Plaintiffs were then students at UCD who \nattended UCD, in significant part, because of its wrestling program. Two of the Plaintiffs were terminated from the \nvarsity wrestling team solely because they were women; the third was never allowed to participate on the team. \nPlaintiffs alleged that Defendants' conduct was part of an overall failure to comply with UCD's affirmative obligations \nunder Title IX, and also violated the Equal Protection Clause and various California civil rights and education laws. \n \nFN2. Defendant Regents shall be referred to herein as “UCD” herein because the events of this case took \nplace on the campus of the University of California at Davis. \n \nOn March 5, 2004, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on several grounds, which was denied. In \nDecember 2005, Plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. After the motion was filed, the Court issued two \nseparate stays of the action due to the unforeseen and serious health issues of both Defendants' and Plaintiffs' counsel. \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \nThe stay was lifted on January 26, 2007 after new counsel for Plaintiffs substituted into the action. Plaintiffs then \nmoved to amend the Complaint to add current UCD students. The court denied this request on two bases: first, that \nPlaintiffs were not diligent in seeking the amendment; second, that the amendment would be prejudicial to Defendants. \n(ER 73-84.) \n \nOn June 5, 2007, Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, asking the court to dismiss a number of Plaintiffs' \nclaims. On October 18, 2007, the district court issued a decision dismissing some of Plaintiffs' claims, and refusing to \ndismiss others. (ER 29-72.) Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims were among those dismissed, with the court holding that “Title \nIX's enforcement scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to subsume plaintiffs' section 1983 claims and demonstrate \nthat Congress intended to preclude § 1983 claims when it enacted this statute.” (ER 36:7-10.)[FN3] \n \nFN3. The district court also dismissed what it considered to be a Title IX claim for denial of equal treatment \nin athletics, finding it to be barred by the statute of limitations under a Title VII case, Ledbetter v. Goo-\ndyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2162, 2169 (2007). However, Plaintiffs did not assert an equal \ntreatment claim, only an effective accommodation claim. Since Defendants did not raise a statute of limita-\ntions defense with respect to the latter claim, Plaintiffs are not briefing this issue. (ER 48:13-21:6; 51 n.12.) \nPlaintiffs nevertheless note that Ledbetter was never applicable to this case, and that it has recently been \noverruled by Congress with the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Pub. L. 111-2, 123 Stat. \n5 (Jan. 29, 2009) If this Court believes that analysis of the district court's statute of limitations ruling is per-\ntinent to the issues, Plaintiffs respectfully request leave to address it in a supplemental brief. \n \nDefendants then filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Title IX equal accommodation claim, which the \ndistrict court granted. (ER 7-28.) First, relying on Supreme Court Title IX sexual harassment cases that require actual \nnotice of discrimination, “[t]he court conclude[d] that money damages cannot be awarded unless a plaintiff has given \nnotice of and an opportunity to rectify the specific violation alleged by a Title IX plaintiff.” (ER 13:2-5.) Second, the \ndistrict court held that “[t]he undisputed evidence establishes that plaintiffs did not provide defendants with notice and \nan opportunity to cure a violation of Title IX for ineffective accommodation.” (ER 20:27-21:1.) \n \nThis appeal was timely filed on May 22, 2008. (ER 1-5.) \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nI. The Framework for Evaluating a Title IX Claim of Ineffective Accommodation.[FN4] \n \nFN4. The legal framework is included in the Statement of Facts to provide the Court with the legal context in \nwhich to understand the relevant facts. \n \nTitle IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs that, like UCD, receive federal funding. This broad \nprohibition extends to any education program or activity, including intercollegiate athletics. The regulations prom-\nulgated pursuant to Title IX require institutions to “provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.” 34 \nC.F.R. § 106.41(c) (emphasis added). (AD 4.)[FN5] \n \nFN5. References to “AD” are to the Addendum attached hereto pursuant to C.R. 28-2.7. \n \nThe critical aspect of that requirement in this case is “[w]hether the selection of sports and levels of competition \neffectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.” 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1). (AD 4.) It is \nwell-established that “an institution may violate Title IX simply by failing to accommodate effectively the interests \nand abilities of student athletes of both sexes.” Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 828 (10th Cir. 1993) \n(citation omitted); Neal v. Bd. of Trs., 198 F.3d 763, 767-68 (9th Cir. 1999); Cohen v. Brown Univ. (Cohen II), 991 \nF.2d 888, 897-98 (1st Cir. 1993). \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 9 \n \nIn 1979, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) issued a Policy Interpretation to provide \nguidance on the meaning of equal athletic opportunity under an effective accommodation claim.[FN6] Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972; a Policy Interpretation; Title IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 et \nseq. (1979) (the “Policy Interpretation”). (AD 8-16.) The Policy Interpretation sets forth a three-part test for deter-\nmining whether a school is in compliance with the regulatory mandate: \n \nFN6. The Department of Education, acting through the OCR, is the administrative agency charged with \nadministering Title IX. Neal, 198 F.3d at 770 (citations omitted). The Policy Interpretation is a “considered \ninterpretation” of the applicable regulations, and is entitled to deference by the courts. Id. \n \n(1) Whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers \nsubstantially proportionate to their respective enrollments; or \n \n(2) Where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, whether the \ninstitution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the \ndeveloping interest and abilities of the members of that sex; or \n \n(3) Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot \nshow a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, whether it can be demonstrated that the \ninterests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present pro-\ngram. \n \nPolicy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418, Part VII.C.5.a. (AD 11.) The three-part test is further explained in a \nClarification of Intercollegiate Athletic Policy Guideline: The Three-Part Test (hereafter “1996 OCR Clarification”) \nissued by OCR in 1996. (AD 17-29.) A school can demonstrate compliance by meeting any one of the three prongs. \n \nII. UCD's Athletic Program. \n \nDefendant UCD is charged with overseeing the administration and operation of the University, including its athletics \nprogram. (ER 1204 ¶ 1; 1996-97 ¶ 4; 2004-07 ¶ 5.) As an institution that receives federal funds, UCD is subject to Title \nIX's requirement that it provide equal athletic opportunities to its female athletes. (ER 1204 ¶ 2; 6413:8-22.) As a state \nuniversity, UCD is subject to the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and thus to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nDefendants Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, Athletic Director Greg Warzecka, former Associate Athletic Directors Pam \nGill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson, and former Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Robert Franks are or \nwere the UCD officials responsible for implementing UCD's policies and practices during the time relevant to this \naction. \n \nA. UCD's Failure to Provide Women's Athletic Participation Opportunities Proportionate to Women's \nEnrollment. \n \nBecause UCD admits that it has never provided females with athletic opportunities that are substantially proportionate \nto their enrollment, it is not in compliance with Prong One, the proportionality prong, of the three-part test. (ER 1205 \n¶ 5; 1710-13; 2279:1-18; 2289:11-2290:8; 3181:25-3182:9; 3195:25-3196:3; 5944 ¶14.) In 1995, the number of \nwomen who would have had to have been provided with varsity opportunities to achieve a ratio proportionate to \nwomen's enrollment was 267. (ER 1961.) In 2004, UCD was still short of achieving proportionality by over 100 \nwomen's varsity opportunities. (Id.; AD 23-24 (explaining that a school is not in compliance with Prong One where \nthe opportunities available for women are not proportionate and there is a “significant number” of unaccommodated \nwomen at that school, such that a “viable sport could be added”).) \n \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 10 \nB. UCD's Failure to Expand Participation Opportunities for Women Athletes \n \nUCD also fails to comply with Prong Two of the three-part test. (See AD 29 n.2 (“Part two focuses on whether an \ninstitution has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation opportunities provided to the underrepresented \nsex.”).) Between the passage of Title IX in 1972 and 1996, UCD failed to expand athletic opportunities for women at \nall. (ER 1207 ¶ 17; 1209 ¶ 27; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; 1453; 1493; 1549; 1613; 1710-13; 1961; 4132.) In 1976, UCD \nissued an internal report showing serious deficiencies in Title IX compliance, yet took no steps to address these de-\nficiencies for nearly twenty years. (See ER 1206 ¶¶7-9; 1710-13.) In 1983, UCD dropped women's field hockey de-\nspite the fact that there were existing teams, active interest, ability, and available competition. (ER 1208 ¶¶ 19-20; \n1710-13; 2324; 4541-42; 4543-51.) It also dropped women's golf. (Id.) Between 1989 and 1991, UCD eliminated \nnearly 100 women's varsity opportunities. (ER 1207-08 ¶ 18; compare 1710 with 2317.) \n \nAn internal report issued in 1991 again warned of deficiencies in Title IX compliance. (ER 1206 ¶¶7-9; 1710-13.) In \n1996, when female participation rates were 20% lower than female enrollment, UCD finally added three women's \nvarsity teams. (ER 1207 ¶ 12; 1208 ¶ 21; 1345-46; 1354-55; 1961.) Even so, the participation rates of women re-\nmained disproportionate to their enrollment by 11%. (Id.) Then in 2000, UCD removed all women from the varsity \nwrestling program (ER 1204 ¶ 4; 2644-45; 2935:9-2939:16; 2945:19-2946:18; 3027:22-3028:2; 3029:21-3030:14; \n3665:14-3666:8; 3841:18-3842:21), and denied Plaintiffs' pleas, and the entreaties of their coach, for reinstatement \n(see ER 1221 ¶ 77; 2433-54). \n \nIn 2002, the participation rates of women remained disproportionate by nearly 10%. (ER 1207 ¶ 15; 1829.) The actual \nnumber of participation opportunities for women athletes at UCD dropped by approximately 60 varsity slots between \n1999-2005. (ER 1209 ¶ 27; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; 1453; 1493; 1549; 1961.) \n \nIn fact, UCD has provided fewer, not more, opportunities for women athletes over time, even though its enrollment of \nwomen has grown. In 1999-2000, UCD had a female enrollment population of 10,446 with 424 female varsity athletes \n(ER 1961), yet in 2004-2005, UCD's female enrollment had soared to 12,834 but with only 368 female athletes (ER \n1091:15-1092:11; 1508, 1549). The actual number of women athletes in 2005 was less than what it was in 1999, even \nthough over 2, 200 more women students attended UCD in 2005 than in 1999. (Compare ER 1961 with 1561 & 1601.) \nUCD knew about the significant reduction in varsity opportunities for women, but did not replace the eliminated \nparticipation opportunities or expand opportunities during this time period. (ER 1210-11 ¶¶ 34-35; 1620; 1622; 1786; \n1790; 1795-96; 1829; 3214:3-9; 3248:3-11; 4129:17-21; 4130:18-24; 4138:7-24; 4139:4-14; 4146:14-4147:11.) \n \nIn 2005, two years after this lawsuit was filed, UCD added women's varsity golf. (ER 1208 ¶ 22; 1601; 2053 ¶ 5; 2055 \n¶ 2.b.; 2343-44; 5867.) Golf added only seven opportunities for women athletes. (Id.) Any of the pre-existing club \nteams that sought varsity status would have added considerably more participation opportunities. (ER 1212 ¶ 40; \n3874:3-3875:10; 4225:24-4226:1; 5775; 5797; 5884-85) \n \nC. UCD's Refusal to Fully and Effectively Accommodate the Interests and Abilities of Its Female Students. \n \nUCD has also not complied with Prong Three of the three-part test: it has not fully and effectively accommodated the \ninterests and abilities of its female students. (ER 1212 ¶ 42; 1713; 4400.) Although a report in 1991 urged UCD to \nconduct a survey to determine the interest and ability of women in varsity athletics, it waited 13 years to do so. (ER \n1206 ¶¶7-9; ER 1208 ¶ 22; 1601; 1710-13; 2055 ¶ 2.b.) In 1996, UCD denied requests by the women's badminton and \nfield hockey club teams to be elevated to varsity status. (ER 1212 ¶ 44; 2323-24; 2329-30; 2662-63.) Between 1995 \nand 2003, UCD never communicated to female students that they could seek the addition of a new women's varsity \nsport. (ER 1212 ¶ 45; 3263:16-3264:24; 4125:22-4127:5; 4411:6-9.) In 2003, UCD solicited and received applications \nfor elevation to varsity status from field hockey, rugby, equestrian, bowling, and badminton club teams. The appli-\ncations demonstrated strong interest, a high level of ability, and competitive opportunities at the varsity level for each \nsport. (ER 1211 ¶ 36; 1601; 5763-893.) UCD rejected all of these applications. (ER 1211 ¶ 37; 5763-893.) \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 11 \n \nD. UCD's Elimination of Existing Women's Wrestling Varsity Opportunities. \n \n1. UCD's Women's Wrestling Program. \n \nSince 1992, when women first began wrestling at UCD, the varsity wrestling program included both men and women, \neach competing against their respective sex. (ER 1212-13 ¶ 46; 3369:9-3372:3; 3376:18-3377:8; 3397:19-20; \n6593-610.) In 1995, UCD hired Michael Burch as a wrestling coach. (ER 1213 ¶ 47; 2874:17-25; 2875:9-22; \n3397:19-20; 3369:9-3371:3; 3376:18-3377:8.) Women wrestled at UCD as varsity athletes under Coach Burch \nthroughout his tenure. (ER 1213 ¶ 48; 2878:15-18; 3137:24-3138:2.) \n \nUCD, including Athletic Director Warzecka, admits that Plaintiffs were varsity athletes on the wrestling roster. (ER \n1217 ¶ 58-59; 1871-76; 3137:24-3138:2; 3150:10-19; 4200:23-25; 4201:12-19; 4470:15-4475:19; 4479:12-16; \n4533:12-22; 4661 ¶ 6.) Women wrestlers at UCD received highly qualified coaching (ER 1213 ¶ 50; 3691:20-3692:5; \n3987:21-23), wrestled women using women's freestyle rules (ER 1213 ¶ 49; 2891:11-21; 3036:11-24; 3626:15-3627:1; \n3682:8-18), and received all of the benefits of varsity status including training services, medical services, and aca-\ndemic support services (ER 1213 ¶ 49; 2891:11-21; 3018:1-7; 3036:11-24; 3626:15-3627:1; 3658:22-3659:1; \n3682:8-18; 3830:25-3831:3; 4150:25-4152:7). UCD sponsored a women's division in its annual Aggie Open wrestling \ntournament. (ER 1213 ¶ 51; 2372-427; 2474-77; 2896:25-2897:6; 2921:19-23.) \n \nAs members of the varsity program, women wrestlers attended practice regularly and had the same responsibilities as \nany male team member. (ER 1213-14 ¶ 52; 3015:1-4; 3024:7-13; 3383:17-19; 3385:19-20; 3969:13-21; 3986:1-23.) \nThe women wrestlers were listed as varsity athletes on participation lists, roster lists, and in the Aggie Open programs. \n(ER 1215-16 ¶ 55; 2394-95; 2398; 2403; 2405; 4148:12-4149:9; 4462:7-23; 4469:14-4470:1; 6611-998.) \n \n2. Plaintiffs' Attendance at UCD with the Desire and Intent to Wrestle. \n \nPlaintiffs  chose  to  attend  UCD  to  contribute  to  its  strong  tradition  of  women's  wrestling.  (ER  1204  ¶  3; \n3556:18-3557:5; 3558:18-3559:6; 3626:15-3627:1; 3628:15-3629:24; 3797:13-21.) Plaintiffs Ng and Mansourian \nwere both high school wrestlers who selected Davis because it offered them the opportunity to wrestle. (ER \n3628:15-3629:24; 3791:3-3793:14; 3797:13-21.) In fact, Plaintiff Mansourian selected UCD over a prestigious pro-\ngram that would have put her on track for acceptance at medical school, because only at UCD would she have the \nopportunity to wrestle. (ER 1218 ¶ 62; 3628:13-3629:24.) Plaintiffs Ng and Mansourian actively participated in the \nwrestling program, including regularly attending practice six days a week, receiving benefits as varsity team members, \nand being dedicated members of the team. (ER 1218 ¶ 61 & 63; 3656:12-3659:1; 3816:14-17; 3825:23-3826:8; \n3832:15-3833:2; 3839:5-14.) \n \nPlaintiff Mancuso also chose to attend UCD because it afforded her the opportunity to continue wrestling. (ER 1218 ¶ \n64; 3541:2-11; 3556:18-3557:5; 3558:18-3559:6; 3569:9-15; 3570:22-23.) She was a highly-skilled wrestler in high \nschool who planned to train for the Olympic team. (ER 1218 ¶ 65; 2879:1-5; 2890:5-10; 3553:8-14; 3569:19-24; \n3576:19-23.) Prior to coming to UCD in 2001, she was aware of the controversy about women's wrestling, but un-\nderstood that the women had been reinstated on the team. (ER 1218-19 ¶ 66; 3582:24-3583:15; 3586:9-3587:5; \n3596:23-3597:13.) She entered in 2001 and attended practices in the fall of 2001 along with Ng and Mansourian. (ER \n1219 ¶ 67; 3580:12-25; 3582:6-8; 3588:1-13; 3590:7-3592:7.) However, when she was forced to wrestle-off against a \nman in order to participate on the team, she was cut from the wrestling program. (Id.) \n \n3. UCD's Removal of Women Wrestlers from the Varsity Wrestling Program. \n \nIn October 2000, the UCD athletic department administration instructed Coach Burch to remove the women from the \nwrestling team. (ER 1219 ¶ 68; 2644-45; 2935:9-2939:16; 2945:19-2946:18; 3027:22-3029:2; 3029:21-3030:14; \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 12 \n3665:14-3666:8; 3841:18-3842:21.) Although Burch protested against this instruction, he informed the women \nwrestlers of the directive. (Id.) Burch permitted the women to continue practicing with the wrestling team. (Id.) \nMansourian was injured during a practice in January 2001 and received assistance from a varsity trainer. (ER 1219 ¶ \n69; 3677:8-12; 3678:4-25; 3845:16-20.) When the administration learned of Mansourian's use of this varsity benefit, \nWarzecka met with the women wrestlers and directed them not to participate in wrestling. (ER 1219 ¶ 70; \n3669:24-3670:13.) He also told them that they could not participate on the wrestling team because they were a liability \nto UCD. (ER 1219 ¶ 71; 3082:15-18; 3085:2-9; 3592:21-3593:8.) \n \nUCD eliminated women's varsity wrestling despite the strongest possible evidence of interest and ability in the sport, \nand a reasonable expectation of competition: women were participating on the team and competing in open events.[FN7] \nCoach Burch testified that he could have easily recruited enough women to field several women's varsity teams. (ER \n1219-20 ¶ 72; 2680:16-23; 3442:16-3443:13; 4167:20-4168:4; see supra note 7.) \n \nFN7.  (ER  1220 ¶   73;  2428-32;  2455-59;  2479-81;  2498:23-2499:27;  2508-10;  2817:12-2818:4; \n2822:18-2823:19;  2837:11-2838:1;  2841:24-2843:16;  2889:9-25;  3728:20-3730:13;  3733:22-3734:19; \n3738:3-24; 3909:11-3910:20; 3915:23-3919:9; 3951:20-25; 4069:5-11.) \n \nNumerous individuals with knowledge of women's wrestling agree that there was sufficient interest to field a colle-\ngiate team at UCD in 2001. (ER 1220 ¶ 74; 3742:11-3744:11; 3748:24-3749:17; 3753:18-3756:2; see also supra note \n7.) Ample intercollegiate competition for women's wrestling existed throughout UCD's competitive regions with over \n40 colleges and universities fielding varsity women programs or wrestlers. (Id.) Despite this interest, ability, and \navailable competition for women wrestlers, UCD admits that it did not consider interest in women's wrestling before it \nremoved women from the program. (ER 1220-21 ¶ 75; 2154-267; 4379:12-4380:7; 4390:5-10; 4390:23-4391:1; \n4404:17-22; 4483:4-10; 4489:17-4493:14.) \n \nIn April 2001, Ng and Mansourian submitted a complaint to the OCR, charging that they had been subject to sex \ndiscrimination due to the elimination of intercollegiate athletic opportunities for women. (ER 1221 ¶ 77; 2433-54.) \nSubsequently, Ng, Mancuso, and Mansourian filed supplemental complaints of sex discrimination with OCR. (Id.) \nSoon after the OCR complaints were filed, UCD fired Burch for his support of women's wrestling. (ER 1221 ¶ 81; \n2890:19-23; 2946:9-13; 2957:23-2958:9.) \n \nOCR never interviewed a single plaintiff, or any other women wrestler. (ER 1221 ¶ 78; 3035:2-13; 3037:1-5; \n3685:7-3686:1; 3861:2-6.) Instead, after discussions solely between UCD and OCR, OCR accepted the “voluntary \nresolution” of Plaintiffs'complaints that was suggested by UCD, in which UCD agreed to reinstate the women to the \nwrestling program. (ER 1222 ¶ 82; 1857-58; 2482-89.) However, the plan conditioned reinstatement on Plaintiffs' \nability to compete against men for a varsity slot - a condition that had never previously existed. (ER 1222 ¶ 83; \n1857-58.) Significantly, UCD never advised the OCR that the women wrestlers had previously only competed against \nother women. (ER 1222 ¶ 84; 1857-58; 4480:10-4481:20.) \n \nIn May 2001, after the wrestling season was over, the women were once again placed on the roster for the wrestling \nteam. (ER 1222 ¶ 85; 3589:15-24; 3687:1-19.) However, that fall, UCD required the women to wrestle-off against \nmen for a spot on the team. UCD told them that this was necessary because slots on the team were limited by roster \ncaps, even though roster caps were intended to limit the number of men participating in order to move toward gender \nequity. (ER 1222 ¶¶ 86-87; 1620-22; 2512; 3688:9-17.) UCD's expert testified that forcing women to be counted \nwithin a roster cap for the men's team and to compete against men to be on the team is the effective elimination of \nwomen's opportunities. (ER 1222-23 ¶ 88; 3295:5-13; 3297:1-3298:3.) Roster caps have never been applied to any \nother women's team at UCD. (ER 1223 ¶ 89; 1693:23-27.) \n \nIn the fall of 2001, Plaintiffs attended wrestling practices with the rest of the team. (ER 1223 ¶ 90; 3580:12-25; \n3581:15-18; 3582:6-8; 3709:9-25; 3867:17-25.) At the practices, the new coach was hostile to the women and did not \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 13 \nprovide them with any coaching, tips, or support. (ER 1223 ¶ 91; 3594:1-14; 3598:17-3599:1; 3700:18-3701:3; \n3703:5-12; 3862:17-3863:7; 3863:15:-3864:13.) Feeling unwelcome and humiliated, Mansourian stopped attending \npractices. (ER 1223 ¶ 92; 3709:9-3710:5; 3711:1-3712:8.) Ng wrestled off against Mancuso, who beat her. (ER 1223 \n¶ 93; 3589:4-3592:7; 3869:12-20; 3870:1-12.) Mancuso then wrestled off against a male wrestler, who beat her. (Id.) \n \nPlaintiffs were devastated by their dismissal from varsity wrestling. (ER 1223 ¶ 94; 3601:9-24; 3630:21-22; \n3667:23-3668:20; 3843:7-3844:1.) They filed suit, requesting reinstatement of the women's wrestling program, equal \naccommodation of women in UCD's athletics program, and damages. UCD continues to refuse to provide wrestling \nopportunities to women, even though high schools girls from throughout the state continue to inquire about wrestling \nat UCD. (ER 1224 ¶ 95; 2455-59; 2479-81; 2432; 4515:9-15; 4516:11-4517:8; 4518:24-4519:14.) \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n \nThree erroneous rulings of the district court are before this Court on appeal, the first of which has been resolved by an \nintervening Supreme Court decision. In the first ruling, which was in response to Defendants' Motion for Judgment on \nthe Pleadings, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against all Defendants for dis-\ncrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause on the basis that Title IX is the exclusive remedy for sex dis-\ncrimination by educational institutions. On January 21, 2009, the United States Supreme Court reached the opposite \nconclusion in Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., 129 S. Ct. 788, 2009 WL 128173 (Jan. 21, 2009), holding that \nTitle IX does not preempt constitutional claims under § 1983, and that remedies under both statutes can be pursued. \nTherefore, the order of the district court dismissing Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims must be reversed. \n \nSecond, the district court erroneously denied Plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint to add current students at UCD. \nThe proposed amendment was limited and reasonable in light of unforeseen stays of the action, and necessary to \nPlaintiffs' diligent prosecution of this action. The court abused its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs had not estab-\nlished good cause under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 16(b) and that the proposed amendment was prejudicial \nunder rule 15(a). \n \nThird, the district court erroneously held that the actual notice required in Title IX sexual harassment cases seeking \ndamages was required here and had not been provided. It concluded, therefore, that UCD was not liable for violations \nof Title IX in its athletics program. This holding is legally untenable. The concern in the Title IX sexual harassment \ncases on which the district court relied is not present here. That concern is ensuring that an educational institution will \nnot be held liable for damages for the behavior of rogue employees, as opposed to its own actions. E.g., Gebser v. Lago \nVista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 287-88 (1998) (funding recipient must have actual notice of teacher's sexual \nharassment of student to which it responds with deliberate indifference). \n \nIn this case, UCD itself is not innocent of sex discrimination while rogue employees secretly committed improper acts. \nInstead, UCD itself has been discriminating against women in its athletics program for decades. It has continually and \ndirectly failed to provide equal opportunities for its female students to participate in sports. \n \nThis case thus has nothing in common with Gebser. It is UCD's own actions in administering its athletics program - \nincluding dropping the women's wrestling program - that are at issue, and those actions fall far short of its affirmative \nobligations under Title IX's three-part test. Institutions receiving federal funds have long been on notice that they are \nsubject to liability for their own violations of Title IX. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 \n(1981); Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60 (1992). \n \nMoreover, even assuming that Plaintiffs were somehow required to show that UCD had actual notice that it was \ndiscriminating against them on the basis of sex, they met that standard. The substantial record of evidence establishes \nthat UCD had ample notice that it was not providing Plaintiffs and its other female students with equal athletic par-\nticipation opportunities. Prior to bringing suit, Plaintiffs repeatedly complained that UCD was denying them and other \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 14 \nwomen athletes at UCD the opportunity to participate fully in varsity athletics. Plaintiffs even filed complaints with, \nand attempted resolution through, the OCR long before they filed their Complaint in court. Moreover, all of this \noccurred against the backdrop of a University that repeatedly told itself over the course of decades, in internal reports \nand memos, that it was failing to live up to its obligations under Title IX. The district court's conclusion that the notices \nthat Plaintiffs (and others) gave UCD were not adequate because they focused too heavily upon wrestling rather than \nthe broader failure of UCD to provide equal accommodation to female athletes only shows the court's misunders-\ntanding of the applicable Title IX regulations and policies. Even if notice were required - which it was not - UCD had \nit. \n \nThe importance of correcting the district court's errors is particularly acute in this case because the record below makes \nclear that UCD violated Title IX by failing to meet any prong of the three-part test for determining whether a school is \nproviding its female students with equal opportunities to play sports. By denying Plaintiffs the opportunity to make \ntheir case, the district court's error compounds the inequities that they and other female students at UCD have faced for \nyears and continue to face. As Plaintiffs will show on remand, UCD also violated the Equal Protection Clause by \ndiscriminating against women in its provision of educational programs and they should also be allowed to pursue those \nclaims. \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS' EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMS. \n \nA. Applicable Standard of Review. \n \nThe dismissal of a complaint from a judgment on the pleadings is reviewed de novo. Ventress v. Japan Airlines, 486 \nF.3d 1111, 1114 (9th Cir. 2007). On a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the allegations of the complaint must be \naccepted as true. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 (1972). “A court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no \nrelief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.” Swierkiewicz v. \nSorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 514 (2002) (citation omitted). \n \nB. The District Court Erred in Dismissing Plaintiffs' § 1983 Claims for Monetary Damages Against the Indi-\nvidual Defendants. \n \nIn response to Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' claims for \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking monetary \ndamages against Defendants Vanderhoef, Warzecka, Swanson, Gill-Fisher, and Franks on the sole basis that these \nclaims were precluded by Title IX. On January 21, 2009, however, the United States Supreme Court held in Fitzgerald \nv. Barnstable that there is no such preclusion. Specifically, the Court stated that: \nTitle IX was not meant to be an exclusive mechanism for addressing gender discrimination in schools, or a substitute \nfor § 1983 suits as a means of enforcing constitutional rights. Accordingly, we hold that § 1983 suits based on the \nEqual Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools. \n \nFitgerald, 2009 WL 128173, at *8. Because the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims on the sole basis that \nsuch claims are precluded by Title IX, in light of Fitzgerald, the district court must be reversed and Plaintiffs' § 1983 \nclaims against the individual defendants must be reinstated. \n \nC. The District Court Erred in Dismissing Plaintiffs' § 1983 Claim for Injunctive Relief Against UCD. \n \nIn their Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, Defendants also sought dismissal of Plaintiffs' claim for violation of \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 seeking injunctive relief against \nDefendant UCD on the sole basis that this claim was precluded by Title IX. Rather than dismissing on that ground, the \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 15 \ndistrict court sua sponte dismissed Plaintiffs' § 1983 claim against UCD on the ground that Plaintiffs did not have \nstanding to assert a claim for injunctive relief as they were no longer current students at UCD. (ER 61 n.15.) Plaintiffs' \nlack of standing, however, was the direct result of the district court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend to \nadd plaintiffs who were current UCD students. As discussed infra, the court erred in denying Plaintiffs leave to amend \nto add current students. Had it not been for this error, Plaintiffs would have had standing to maintain their § 1983 claim \nagainst UCD for injunctive relief. And in light of Fitzgerald, UCD has no other argument on appeal that the dismissal \nof this claim was proper. Accordingly, Plaintiffs must be allowed to reassert their § 1983 claim against UCD for \ninjunctive relief upon a showing of standing in the district court. \n \nII. THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN DENYING PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO AMEND TO ADD CUR-\nRENT STUDENTS TO THE LAWSUIT. \n \nThe district court erred in denying Plaintiffs leave to amend their Complaint to add three current students as plaintiffs \nand proposed class representatives before the hearing on class certification and long before the close of discovery. \nPlaintiffs sought the amendment eight months before the close of discovery, eleven months before the dispositive \nmotion deadline and fifteen months before trial. (See ER 85-91.) The court held, however, that: (1) Plaintiffs lacked \ngood cause to modify the scheduling order because they failed to be diligent in seeking the modification, as required \nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 16 (ER 80:17-82:5); and (2) Plaintiffs' proposed amendments to the Complaint would be prejudicial \nto Defendants, even under the very liberal standards of Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 (ER 82:6-84:11). Both findings are erro-\nneous, and are premised on a misapplication of the standards, as well as a misapprehension of the gravamen of \nPlaintiffs' Complaint. The court's order should, accordingly, be reversed. \n \nA. Applicable Standard of Review \n \nAn abuse of discretion standard governs review both of a district court's denial of a request to modify a pretrial \nscheduling order, and of its denial of a motion for leave to amend a pleading. Noyes v. Kelly Servs., 488 F.3d 1163, \n1174 (9th Cir. 2007); Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 609 (9th Cir. 1992). Because of the strong \npolicy favoring leave to amend, denials of leave to amend, however, are “strictly” reviewed. Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux \nTribe v. United States, 90 F.3d 351, 355 (9th Cir. 1996). \n \nB. The Court Erred in Refusing to Allow Plaintiffs to Modify the Scheduling Order. \n \nThe district court's finding that Plaintiffs lacked good cause to modify the scheduling order was based on its conclu-\nsion that Plaintiffs should have foreseen the need to bring current students into the lawsuit and their failure to do so \nearlier was due to a lack of diligence. (ER 80:17-82:5.) This was, however, a misapplication of Rule 16's standard \nwhich looks to the reasonable diligence of the moving party and her reasons for modification. Johnson, 975 F.2d at \n609-10. Where the non-moving party is already on notice of the reasons for the proposed modification, good cause can \nbe found. Sousa v. Unilab Corp. Class II (Non-Exempt) Members Group Benefit Plan, 252 F. Supp. 2d 1046, 1059 \n(E.D. Cal. 2002). Failing to understand the scope of the lawsuit and its posture as a Title IX class action seeking broad \ninjunctive relief, the district court committed two distinct errors in finding that Plaintiffs lacked good cause. \n \n 1. The Court Misapprehended the Scope of the Original Complaint by Finding that Plaintiffs Should Have \nSought Amendment Upon Receipt of Program-Wide Discovery. \n \nThe court misapprehended the scope of Plaintiffs' Complaint by finding that they should have sought to amend to \ninclude plaintiffs interested in other sports when they “discovered” evidence about discrimination involving other \nsports. (ER 81:9-23.) Plaintiffs' Complaint has always included a Title IX claim of ineffective accommodation, which \nnecessarily requires a program-wide analysis of UCD's athletics program, and therefore necessarily involves other \nwomen athletes. (ER 6441:1-6443:19.) \n \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 16 \nThe court found that Plaintiffs “had notice that the named plaintiffs in this action only alleged that they participated or \nwished to participate in a varsity wrestling program.” (ER 81:17-20.) This finding demonstrates the court's error. The \ngravamen of the Complaint is that Defendants were refusing to equally accommodate women in athletics and ex-\nacerbated  this  discrimination  by  eliminating  women's  varsity  wrestling  opportunities.  (ER  6417:17-6434:12; \n6441:1-6443:19.) Plaintiffs challenged UCD's overall failure “to provide equitable athletic participation and scho-\nlarship opportunities for women, despite the athletic interests and abilities of UC-Davis female students and high \nschool female students who will become UC-Davis students in the future.” (ER 6408:20-24.) Plaintiffs sought in-\njunctive relief on behalf of all female athletes. (ER 6409:9-24.) \n \nThe court also ignored critical allegations in the Complaint that defined the proposed class to include all women \nstudent athletes, including wrestlers.[FN8] (ER 6409:1-8.) These allegations are consistent with Plaintiffs' December \n2005 class certification motion, which defined the class to compasses all female athletes. (ER 6405:22-25.) Plaintiffs' \nstatus as wrestlers did not preclude them from adequately representing a class of women athletes interested in various \nsports. Adding current students with a variety of athletic interests simply was consistent with the original allegations \nof the Complaint and with the program-wide scope of an ineffective accommodation claim. \n \nFN8. Notably, the pleading requirements under Rule 8 are non-technical and extremely liberal. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a) & (e). (See infra note 14.) \n \nIndeed, as UCD repeatedly acknowledged, the court is required to analyze Plaintiffs' Title IX ineffective accommo-\ndation claim involving the athletics program as a whole. Title IX looks at compliance on a programmatic rather than \nsport-specific basis. Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417, Part VII. B.5. (AD 10.) Assessment is according to \nwhether the institution's “program as a whole” is satisfactory. Id.; see also id. at 71,422, App. B, Resp. to Add'l \nComments (8). (AD 15.) “Title IX protects the individual as a student-athlete, not as a basketball player, or swimmer.” \nId. at 71,422 (AD 15); see Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, Pa., 998 F.2d 168, 174-75 (3d Cir. 1993) (Title IX \nregulations require inquiry regarding overall opportunities rather than opportunities in a particular sport). Any remedy \nnecessarily will affect the entire student body of women athletes. Cohen v. Brown Univ. (Cohen II), 991 F.2d 888, 897 \n(1st Cir. 1993). \n \nPlaintiffs' proposed amendment sought to add new plaintiffs with the same claims against the same defendants who \nwere suffering the same injury as the original Plaintiffs: denial of a right to equal accommodation in athletics. Indeed, \nproposed Plaintiff Ludwig was another wrestler. Moreover, the proposed amendments did not seek to “add” field \nhockey and rugby because the experience of female student athletes interested in different varsity opportunities has \nalways been integral to the analysis in this case. The court's failure to recognize the scope of Plaintiffs' proposed class \naction led it to erroneously conclude that Plaintiffs did not diligently seek to modify the scheduling order. \n \n 2. The Court Ignored the Impact of Intervening Factors on Class Certification to Deny Plaintiffs a Routine \nAmendment to Strengthen Representation of the Class. \n \nIn refusing to modify the scheduling order, the district court also failed to recognize the impact of an unexpected stay \nof the case on the timing of class certification. Plaintiffs' proposed amendment merely sought to add plaintiffs and \nproposed class representatives who were current students at UCD to address the fact that Plaintiff Mancuso had \ngraduated during the unforeseen delay of the case. \n \nPlaintiffs filed their class certification motion in December 2005, while Mancuso was still a UCD student. Mancuso \nwould have still been a current student had class certification been heard as scheduled in April 2006. (ER 75:3-20; \n6102:5-8; 6405.) Shortly before the class certification hearing, however, the court stayed the action at the request of \nPlaintiffs' counsel, who had been diagnosed with cancer. (ER 6384-89.) The action was stayed until January 2007 to \nallow Plaintiffs to secure other counsel. (Id. & ER 76:1-23.) Mancuso graduated during the stay and before resolution \nof class certification. (ER 6102:5-8.) \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 17 \n \nPlaintiffs immediately advised the Court of their intent to amend the Complaint once the stay was lifted. (ER 6373:4-7.) \nIn February 2007, Plaintiffs moved to amend their Complaint to add three current students as named Plaintiffs and \nproposed class representatives: Laura Ludwig, a wrestler and UCD club rugby player, as well as Jessica Bulala and \nKelsey Brust, both of whom were UCD club field hockey players. (ER 6327:4-28.) Plaintiffs also sought to add al-\nlegations to reflect the continuing nature of UCD's discrimination (ER 6339:13-6340:11) and to amend the class \ndefinition to conform to the allegations and relief sought in the original Complaint and to the class definition set forth \nin Plaintiffs' class certification motion (ER 6324: 24-27; 6405). \n \nAlthough the original Plaintiffs continued to have standing to prosecute this action and represent the proposed class, it \nwas appropriate to seek the addition of current student once Mancuso had graduated during the unforeseen delay. \nPlaintiffs' counsel has a duty to protect the class, even at the precertification stage. It is routine to permit amendment of \na complaint to add additional representatives where appropriate to strengthen representation. Bromley v. Mich. Educ. \nAss'n, 178 F.R.D. 148, 156-60 (E.D. Mich. 1998) (amendment allowed to cure standing problem); In re Cal. Micro \nDevices Sec. Litig, 168 F.R.D. 276, 277-78 (N.D. Cal. 1996) (class representatives added to address court's concern \nover adequacy of representation). \n \nThe district court misapplied the diligence standard, finding that Plaintiffs knew before the stay that Mancuso's \ngraduation was imminent.[FN9] Mancuso's eventual graduation, even if imminent, is not determinative of whether \nPlaintiffs were diligent. But for the unforeseen delay in resolution of class certification, Mancuso would have been a \ncurrent student when class certification was decided. The addition of current students as plaintiffs and proposed class \nrepresentatives was intended to protect the class, and did not enlarge the case in any way. These circumstances thus \nwere good cause to modify the scheduling order. See, e.g., Merrithew/Howell v. Park Pointe Realty, Inc., 2007 WL \n129040, at *2 (D. Idaho Jan. 12, 2007) (finding good cause because delays were result of unforeseen circumstances). \n \nFN9. The district court noted testimony by Mancuso that she filed an “intent to graduate” in the Fall of 2005. \n(ER 79:26-28.) However, the record does not support any assumption that this action would result in a \ngraduation date before June 2006. \n \nThe proposed amendment was limited, reasonable, and timely. Plaintiffs' proposed amendment was well before the \ndiscovery cut-off. This fact alone contrasts sharply with the cases relied on by the court below, where bad faith \namendments were sought after close of discovery See, e.g., Jackson v. Bank of Haw., 902 F.2d 1385, 1388 (9th Cir. \n1990) (request to add new defendants and new claims fourteen months after advising defendants of intent to file \namended complaint and one year after close of discovery); Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Network Solutions, Inc., 194 \nF.3d 980, 983, 986 (9th Cir. 1999) (request to add new claims made after discovery closed); Acri v. Int'l Ass'n of \nMachinists & Aeorspace Workers, 781 F.2d 1393, 1395 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding undue delay and bad faith for plain-\ntiffs' request to add new theory of liability at summary judgment hearing, where plaintiffs admitted delay as a “tactical \nchoice”). \n \nThe court abused its discretion in finding that Plaintiffs had not established good cause under Rule 16(b). Kaisha v. \nBASF Corp., 2007 WL 39313, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 4, 2007) (good cause where discovery ongoing). \n \nC. The District Court Erred in Concluding that Plaintiffs' Proposed Amendments Would Prejudice Defen-\ndants. \n \nOnce Plaintiffs have shown good cause under Rule 16, the next inquiry is whether the amendment is proper under Rule \n15(a). Johnson, 975 F.2d at 608. When a party seeks to amend her pleading, leave shall be freely given “when justice \nso requires.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). “This policy is to be applied with extreme liberality” in consideration of factors \nsuch as prejudice, bad faith, undue delay and futility of the amendment. Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc., 316 \nF.3d 1048, 1051, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). The burden of proof falls on the party opposing the \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 18 \namendment. Id. \n \nThe district court erroneously found prejudice to Defendants. The court concluded that the addition of other female \nathletes would burden Defendants with defending against an entirely new theory of liability. (ER 82:6-84:3.) But this \nconclusion is flawed because, as explained above, Plaintiffs' ineffective accommodation claim necessarily requires an \nanalysis of UCD's accommodation of female interest program-wide. Further, any injunctive relief would necessarily \nimpact all women athletes at UCD. \n \nThe proposed amendment did not allege any new theories of liability or change the scope of the action; it merely \nwould have added three current women athletes at UCD who were ready and willing to serve as class representatives. \nDiscovery regarding the availability of opportunities in other sports had already been conducted and relied upon by \nexperts in the case. (E.g., ER 5939-68; 6108-20; 6201-39.) In addition, Defendants had eight months before the close \nof discovery to conduct any discovery specific to the new plaintiffs. And Defendants knew Plaintiffs' Title IX claim \ninvolved the entire athletics program. The test for allowing amendment is not whether defendants will be disadvan-\ntaged at all, but whether they would be “unfairly disadvantaged or deprived of the opportunity to present facts or \nevidence which it would have offered had the amendments been timely.” In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 217 F.R.D. 34, \n36 (D.D.C. 2003) (citations omitted); Hartford Ins. Co. v. Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahirya, 422 F. Supp. 2d \n203, 206 (D.D.C. 2006). \n \nGiven the scope of the case, the discovery already conducted, and the amount of time remaining to litigate this case, \nthe court abused its discretion in denying the motion to amend under Rule 15(a). See Bertrand v. Sava, 535 F. Supp. \n1020, 1023 (S.D.N.Y. 1982), rev'd on other grounds, 684 F.2d 204 (2d Cir. 1982). \n \nIII. THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO UCD ON PLAIN-\nTIFFS' TITLE IX CLAIM. \n \nA. Applicable Standard of Review. \n \nThis Court reviews all grants of summary judgment de novo. See Clicks Billiards, Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc. (Billiards), \n251 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party . . . and \ndrawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, [the Court] must determine whether the district court correctly applied \nthe relevant substantive law and whether there are any genuine issues of material fact.” (citations omitted)). The \ndistrict court's interpretation of Title IX is reviewed de novo. Neal, 198 F.3d at 766. Summary judgment may be \nrendered only if all evidence shows “that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled \nto judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 56(c). \n \nAll evidence submitted on behalf of the non-moving parties must be believed and all justifiable inferences must be \ndrawn in their favor. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Easter v. Am. \nWest Fin., 381 F.3d 948, 949, 960 (9th Cir. 2004). The weighing of evidence is a jury functions not suitable for res-\nolution on summary judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986); Soremekun v. Thrifty \nPayless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007). \n \nB. The District Court Erred in Applying the Notice Requirement of Title IX Sexual Harassment Cases to \nPlaintiffs' Ineffective Accommodation Claim. \n \nThe district court held that Plaintiffs' claim for damages under Title IX is barred as a matter of law because Plaintiffs \ndid not give UCD actual notice of their ineffective accommodation charge. This holding is legally and factually in \nerror. The court's error was, in significant part, caused by its failure to recognize two distinct concepts of notice in Title \nIX jurisprudence - notice required under the Spending Clause to an institution of potential liability for its own Title IX \nviolations when it accepts federal funds (Pennhurst notice), and actual notice to the institution when the acts of third \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 19 \nparties, e.g., a teacher or a student, who engaged in sexual harassment are at issue (Gebser notice). There is no ques-\ntion that UCD had Pennhurst notice that it was subject to liability for violations of the Title IX athletics regulations \nand policies. And there is no reasonable interpretation of Gebser that would cause it to be applied here. \n \n 1. Title IX Imposes No Actual Notice Requirements on Plaintiffs Challenging an Institution's Discrimination \nin its Athletics Program. \n \nPlaintiffs seek to hold UCD liable under Title IX for its own acts in administering its athletics program. Title IX \nexplicitly provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, \nbe denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.” 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). (AD 1.) As the Supreme Court explained in Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 17, \nlegislation such as Title IX that is enacted pursuant to the Constitution's Spending Clause is in the nature of a contract: \n“in return for federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.” Those conditions must be \nclear, as there is “no knowing acceptance if a State is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is ex-\npected of it.” Id. In accepting federal funds, UCD accepted its obligation under Title IX not to discriminate against \nwomen in the operation of its programs. That this includes the obligation not to discriminate in athletics, as defined by \nthe longstanding Title IX athletics regulations and policies, is not reasonably subject to dispute. Plaintiffs are not \nattempting to hold UCD liable for some novel theory of discrimination. Instead, they have alleged a straightforward, \nestablished claim that UCD has failed to provide equal participation opportunities in its athletics program. \n \nFurther, UCD has been on notice since Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 667 (1979), that it is subject to suit under \nTitle IX by individuals, and since Franklin, 503 U.S. 60, that those suits can subject it to liability for monetary \ndamages. See Franklin, 503 U.S. at 75 (“Congress surely did not intend for federal moneys to be expended to support \nthe intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe.”); Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ, 544 U.S. 167, 182 \n(2005) (“Funding recipients have been on notice that they could be subjected to private suits for intentional sex dis-\ncrimination under Title IX since 1979, when we decided Cannon.”). \n \nAs the Supreme Court recently stated, “Title IX has no administrative exhaustion requirement and no notice provi-\nsions. Under the implied private right of action, plaintiffs can file directly in court, . . . and can obtain the full range of \nremedies, . . .” Fitzgerald, 2009 WL 128173, at *7. Thus, while the express enforcement mechanism of Title IX is an \nadministrative procedure resulting in the withdrawal of federal funds from institutions that are not in compliance, see \n20 U.S.C. § 1682, the implied right of action operates independently, and allows private plaintiffs to seek both in-\njunctive relief and damages. Id. \n \n 2. The Actual Notice Requirement in Sexual Harassment Cases. \n \nIn Gebser, the Court addressed whether a school district could be held liable for a student's sexual harassment by a \nteacher who involved her in a secret sexual relationship. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 274. The student sought to hold the \nschool district liable for the teacher's conduct by applying two alterative theories of agency liability: either respondeat \nsuperior, that the teacher was aided in carrying out the sexual harassment by his position of authority, irrespective of \nthe district's knowledge of the harassment; or constructive notice, where the district knew or should have known about \nthe harassment but failed to uncover and eliminate it. Id. at 282. \n \nThe Court concluded that these agency principles did not apply to attach liability to the school district for the teacher's \nunlawful conduct. Instead, for the district to be liable for damages for the acts of the teacher, the Court established the \nrequirement that an authorized employee or official have actual notice of the sexual harassment and react with deli-\nberate indifference to that harassment. Gebser, 524 U.S. at 290-91. Thus, in a case that seeks to hold the funding \nrecipient liable for money damages not for its own actions, but for the acts of third parties, the recipient should only be \nliable for the rogue conduct of an employee if the recipient knew of the conduct and failed to address it. Id. at 287-91. \n \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 20 \nIn Davis ex rel. LaShonda v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ. (Davis), 526 U.S. 629, 639-40 (1999), the Supreme Court \nreaffirmed that the type of notice explained in Gebser is required only where - unlike here - a plaintiff seeks to hold a \nfunding recipient liable for the independent conduct of third parties. The Court held that, as in Gebser, a funding \nrecipient can be liable for “its own decision to remain idle in the face of known student-on-student harassment in its \nschools.” 526 U.S. at 641 (emphasis in original). \n \nNothing in these decisions suggests that the difficult standard of deliberate indifference to actual knowledge of dis-\ncrimination applies to situations where - as here - the funding recipient itself is intentionally violating Title IX by \nexcluding persons from, denying benefits to, or subjecting persons to discrimination on the basis of sex in its own \noperation of its programs or activities. Id. at 640-41. \n \n 3. The District Court's Erroneous Application of Gebser. \n \nThat the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis required actual notice to a funding recipient of the sexual harassment by \na teacher or a student of another student and deliberate indifference to that harassment before holding the recipient \nliable in a suit for money damages imposes no unmet burden on Plaintiffs in this effective accommodation case. \n \nFirst, Gebser notice is only required in cases of sexual harassment by a third party, because the Supreme Court con-\ncluded that agency principles are not applicable in Title IX cases. See Davis, 526 U.S. 629 (1999); Reese v. Jefferson \nSch. Dist., 208 F.3d 736, 739 (9th Cir. 2000). Plaintiffs do not seek to recover for sexual harassment by a teacher or a \nstudent. \n \nSecond, Plaintiffs do not, and need not, rely on any type of agency theory to establish UCD's violation of Title IX \nbecause Plaintiffs claim that UCD itself has been discriminating and continues to discriminate against women in the \noperation of its athletic program. UCD is fully and uniquely responsible for the level and extent of athletic oppor-\ntunities it provides and decides how many opportunities to provide to its female and to its male students. It has af-\nfirmative obligations to comply with Title IX in the provision of these opportunities - obligations that it has utterly \nfailed to meet in this case.[FN10] Thus, in cases such as this where the funding recipient itself is charged with sex dis-\ncrimination, individuals bringing suit under Title IX do not have a separate obligation to inform the funding recipient \nof its own discriminatory conduct. \n \nFN10. In fact, under the 1994 Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, UCD must annually file and make publicly \navailable a report with the United States Department of Education detailing information about its athletics \nprogram. See 20 U.S.C. § 1092. In effect, as its name suggests, the law requires universities to perform an \nannual self-audit of many of Title IX's requirements. Among other data, UCD must report the number of \nfemales and males enrolled, and the number and gender of participants on each varsity team that it sponsors. \nThe notion that it is not on “notice” of the gender equity, or lack thereof, in its athletics program thus is \nnonsensical. \n \nThe district court's reliance on Title IX's administrative process to avoid this conclusion is misplaced. As the Supreme \nCourt recently reiterated, Title IX has no exhaustion requirement; its administrative scheme is independent of its \nimplied right of private action. Fitzgerald, 2009 WL 128173, at *1, 7. The language in Gebser that referenced the \nadministrative scheme simply underscored the concern with holding the funding recipient liable for acts of which it \nwas unaware. See Gebser, 524 U.S. at 289-90 (implied right of action should not permit “substantial liability without \nregard to the recipient's knowledge”). \n \nThird, the district court never suggests that UCD somehow did not know that it was not providing equal athletic op-\nportunities to its women students, but is instead imposing a requirement that Plaintiffs were obliged to give formal \nnotice of that fact before they could sue for damages. This requirement goes beyond the Gebser standard, has no \nfoundation in reason or precedent, and is in direct conflict with the express terms of the three-part test, which states \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 21 \nthat a school is not in compliance if it cannot meet one of the three prongs. That is precisely the situation UCD finds \nitself in. \n \nWhere, as here, UCD itself is responsible for all relevant aspects of its athletics program, including the obligation to \nensure its compliance with Title IX, no additional notice is required before a student may bring a private right of action \nfor damages for the University's failure to meet its Title IX obligations. It is necessarily on notice of its own conduct. \n(ER 1204 ¶¶ 1-2; 1996-97 ¶ 4; 2004-07 ¶ 5; 6413:8-22.) See generally Pederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, \n878-83 (5th Cir. 2000) (holding university accountable for Title IX damages on equal accommodation theory). \n \nThe Pederson case is directly on point. It addressed whether the notice requirements in Title IX sexual harassment \ncases applied where the claim was a university's failure to provide equal athletic opportunities. The court held: “In the \ninstant case, it is the institution itself that is discriminating. The proper test is not whether it knew of or is responsible \nfor the actions of others, but is whether Appellees intended to treat women differently on the basis of their sex by \nproviding them unequal athletic opportunity, and, as we noted above, we are convinced that they did.” Id. at 882. This \nconclusion, of course, goes hand in hand with UCD's affirmative obligations to comply with Title IX's provisions. See, \ne.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.4(a). \n \nIn this case, therefore, this Court should make clear that the district court's application of Gebser notice was erroneous \nand that its reliance on Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568 (8th Cir. 2001) is entirely misplaced. Grandson is \nneither controlling nor persuasive.[FN11] Prior to the district court's decision, Grandson stood alone in applying Gebser \nto an athletics case. The reason for this is evident. As Davis makes plain, Gebser applies only in sexual harassment \ncases seeking damages where there is a question as to whether the federal recipient itself engaged in discrimination. \nSee, e.g., Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287-88 (it is “sensible to assume that Congress did not envision a recipient's liability in \ndamages” when the recipient “was unaware of the discrimination”); Davis, 526 U.S. at 643 (Gebser sought “to \neliminate any risk that the recipient would be liable in damages not for its own official decision but instead for its \nemployees' independent actions” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). \n \nFN11. In fact, a decision by the Eighth Circuit the year after Grandson was decided that addressed an inef-\nfective accommodation claim under Title IX made no reference to Grandson or to Gebser. See Chalenor v. \nUniv. of N.D., 291 F.3d 1042 (8th Cir. 2002). \n \nRecognizing this concept, this Court has applied Gebser and Davis only in the context of sexual harassment claims. \nSee, e.g., Reese, 208 F.3d at 739. The district court's decision is also contrary to those of other courts in this Circuit. \nSee Johnson v. Clovis Unified Sch. Dist., 2007 WL 1456062, at *3 (E.D. Cal. May 17, 2007); Michelle M. v. Dunsmuir \nJoint Union Sch. Dist., 2006 WL 2927485, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2006). \n \nFinally, as established below, even if the Grandson case correctly stated the legal principles, it is distinguishable. \nWhereas Grandson accepted the district court's questionable determination that administrators at the defendant \ncampus somehow were unaware of the unequal treatment of women in athletics, Grandson, 272 F.3d at 575-76, the \nevidence here plainly establishes that UCD was well aware of its obligations and of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs' \nineffective accommodation claim. \n \nC. The Evidence Establishes That UCD Was on Notice of Plaintiffs' Ineffective Accommodation Charge. \n \nPlaintiffs should not have to provide notice to an institution of its own Title IX violations. Even if the Court accepts the \ndistrict court's holding that Plaintiffs were required to provide UCD with some sort of “notice” of its violations of Title \nIX, however, evidence abounds that UCD was on notice both of Plaintiffs' claims and of its ineffective accommoda-\ntion of women athletes long before the commencement of this suit. \n \nQuite unlike the school district that was oblivious to a teacher's covert abuse of a student in Gebser, the evidence here \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 22 \nestablishes that UCD had direct oversight and responsibility for all aspects of its athletic program relevant to Plaintiffs' \nineffective accommodation claim, including ensuring the University's compliance with Title IX. (ER 1204 ¶¶ 1-2; \n1996-97 ¶ 4; 2004-07 ¶ 5; 6413:8-22.) UCD admits, as it must, that it received notice of Plaintiffs' OCR complaints. \n(ER 1831; see also infra. note 12.) The district court held that this notice was insufficient, however, because Plaintiffs' \ncomplaints related to wrestling and were not general enough. (See ER 21:12-13 (“the complaints allege specific acts of \nunequal treatment with respect to women's wrestling”).) The court held that this, as a matter of law, was not enough to \ndemonstrate that “defendants received notice and an opportunity to cure an ineffective accommodation claim.” (ER \n22:2-3.) \n \nThe district court's position is erroneous and should be reversed. First, the court plainly took every inference against \nPlaintiffs (the non-moving party in the summary judgment proceedings), by interpreting a direct notification of sex \ndiscrimination relating to women's wrestling as not being a notification of “ineffective accommodation.” But the \ndistrict court's must view all evidence in favor of the non-moving party. Billiards, 251 F.3d at 1257. \n \nSecond, the district court's conclusion cannot be reconciled with the applicable standards under Title IX, which require \nan analysis of compliance on a programmatic rather than sport-specific basis. Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at \n71,417, Part VII. B.5. (AD 10.) See also id. at 71,422, App. B, Resp. to Add'l Comments (8). (AD 15.) Plaintiffs' OCR \ncomplaints about UCD's failure to effectively accommodate women in the varsity wrestling program were therefore \nnecessarily a complaint that UCD was failing to effectively accommodate women in its athletics program in violation \nof Title IX. The distinction drawn by the district court is untenable. \n \nThird, the record below makes clear that in addition to Plaintiffs' OCR complaints (ER 1221 ¶ 77; 2433-54), UCD was \non notice of Plaintiffs' complaints of discrimination, from, among other things, Plaintiffs' meetings and attempted \nmeetings with Defendants Warzecka, Franks, and Vanderhoef,[FN12] the involvement of state legislators, the student \nsenate, and the media (see ER 1221 ¶ 76; 1831-32; 1886-88; 1889-1939; 2158-2267; 3103:5-3104:1; 4087:9-23), and \nthe filing of both Coach Burch's and plaintiffs' civil rights complaints. In addition, UCD knew about the protests, \nflyers, letters, news articles and possible legislative sanction generated by UCD's elimination of women's varsity \nwrestling. (See id. & supra note 12.)[FN13] These events raised broad questions about UCD's sex discrimination and \nTitle IX compliance in regards to its athletic program. (Id.) \n \nFN12. (ER 1165-68 ¶ 93; 1205-6 ¶¶ 6-11; 1620-22; 1710-13; 1778-842; 1831-32; 1883-947; 2269-74; \n3103:5-3104:1; 3151:15-3152:9; 4087:9-23; 4105:15-4106:3.) \n \nFN13. When the decision by UCD to eliminate women's wrestling became public, there was a strong public \nbacklash. (ER 1221 ¶ 76; 1886-88; 1889-1939; 2158-2267; 3103:5-3104:1; 4087:9.23.) Assemblywoman \nHelen Thomson threatened to withhold significant funding towards a UCD building, a protest was held, \nflyers and petitions were distributed, campus and statewide newspapers published news articles, and UCD's \nadministration was contacted by concerned alumni. (Id) \n \nAgain, erroneously taking every inference against the non-moving party, the district court held that all of these noti-\nfications from Plaintiffs to UCD that it was engaged in sex discrimination in its sports program were supposedly so \nspecific to wrestling as not to place UCD on notice of the broader issue. (E.g., ER 22-25.) In fact, however, the evi-\ndence shows that UCD regarded the OCR complaints and OCR's investigation as a program-wide grievance. (ER \n1221 ¶ 80; 1871; 4197:14-4198:5; 4199:4-9; 4202:10-13; 4203:1-9; 4204:1-8; 4204:18-20; 4377:24-4378:12.) \n \nThe district court's distinction between notices related to wrestling and broader Title IX violations is also inexplicable \nin light of the district court's own earlier statement that the “gravamen” of the Complaint in this case revolved around \nUCD's handling of its women's wrestling program. (ER 44:24-27.) Moreover, on February 2, 2007, the district court \ndenied Plaintiffs' permission to amend their Complaint because the original Complaint related “only” to opportunities \nfor women in the wrestling program, but the amendments would involve other sports. The district court's switches in \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 23 \nposition leave the Plaintiffs whipsawed - on the one hand, their claims only relate to wrestling and other issues may not \nbe raised; on the other hand, their notices to UCD of sex discrimination in sports supposedly only related to wrestling \nrather than to broader issues and therefore were insufficient as a matter of law to allow this case to proceed. The only \nconsistent element to the district court's approach is that no matter what Plaintiffs said or did, they could not win. \n \nMoreover, UCD's awareness of its program-wide noncompliance is evidenced by dozens of internal memos and \nofficial reports in which UCD admits that it is concerned about its compliance with Title IX. (Supra note 12.) Reports, \nmemoranda, and emails from 1976, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2002 acknowledge and warn \nof UCD's failure to comply with Title IX. (Id.) In 1976, UCD issued an internal report showing serious deficiencies in \nTitle IX compliance. (See ER 1703.) In 1991, UCD issued a report by a committee studying compliance with Title IX \nin UCD athletics. (ER 1710-13.) The Report warned of “resistance within the Athletic Program to UC Davis's efforts \nto ensure total compliance with Title IX.” (ER 1703.) The Report also revealed that “participation by females [in \nvarsity athletics] is clearly not substantially proportionate to their enrollment” at UCD. (ER 1711 (emphasis in \noriginal).) In 1997, an internal committee at UCD again stated that participation levels “are not substantially propor-\ntionate to the undergraduate population of the institution. This suggests potential non-compliance with Title IX par-\nticipation level requirements.” (ER 1620.) In 1998, Defendant Warzecka acknowledged that a gender imbalance in the \nathletic department “is not a new issue.” (ER 1624.) Indeed, UCD's Chief Title IX Compliance Officer admitted that \nhe had a continuing concern about UCD's female participation rates throughout his tenure and believed UCD should \nbe doing more to achieve Title IX compliance, stating “we could and should be doing more.” (ER 1207 ¶ 16; \n4095:19-4097:6; 4144:20-4145:15; 4161:24-4162:4.) \n \nAll of this evidence contradicts the district court's holding that UCD had not received enough notice to “provide some \nindication of the basis for the institution's non-compliance so that an institution may attempt to remedy the situation \nvoluntarily.” (ER 23:9-12.) UCD was clearly aware of its broad problem of noncompliance with Title IX. This was \nhardly a secret known only to a handful of women wrestlers who refused to let the world know; this was a fact that was \nhammered by UCD's own personnel to administrators time and time again. At a minimum, the evidence established a \nquestion of material fact that needed to be resolved by the jury. See, e.g., Gray v. First Winthrop Corp., 82 F.3d 877, \n881 (9th Cir. 1996) (inquiry notice is a matter for the jury). \n \nFurther, the distinction relied upon by the district court is also inconsistent with UCD's own statements throughout this \nlitigation, which demonstrate that it knows that a complaint from women athletes about unequal accommodation is a \ncomplaint that goes to UCD's athletic program as a whole. As UCD stated in its briefing in the district court: “A claim \nof ineffective accommodation encompasses the entire athletic program for the underrepresented sex - not just one \nspecific aspect.” (ER 6058:28-6059:1.) Its expert also examined compliance by looking at the athletics program as a \nwhole. (ER 5939-59.) \n \nFinally, when this Court examines the notice requirement demanded by the district court, it becomes clear that it \nimposes upon ordinary students an extraordinary burden. The crux of the court's holding is not that Plaintiffs gave \nUCD no notice of sex discrimination, but rather that Plaintiffs' OCR complaints were insufficiently comprehensive \nand failed to specify the exact legal theories that would later be pursued, such that UCD only concerned itself with \nwrestling team issues. To require OCR complaints to allege exhaustive facts and legal theories with such particularity \nwould be to import into Title IX a far more burdensome standard than applies even to pleadings prepared by counsel \nunder Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.[FN14] Especially in light of the remedial intent of Title IX, this \ncannot possibly be the law. Particularly since it is undisputed that Plaintiffs' OCR complaints asserted Plaintiffs' right \nto participate on the varsity wrestling team - a right that by UCD's own analysis does not exist independently of \nprogram-wide noncompliance with Title IX - the district court erred in finding that UCD was ignorant of allegations of \nTitle IX violations and, on that basis, stamping out Plaintiffs' ineffective accommodation claim as a matter of law. \n \nFN14. Pleading requirements under Rule 8 are - by express congressional design - nontechnical and ex-\ntremely liberal. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) & (e). Exhaustive pleading is not required; indeed, “a complaint is not \nrequired to allege all, or any, of the facts logically entailed by the claim.” Bennett v. Schmidt, 153 F.3d 516, \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 24 \n518 (7th Cir. 1998) (citation, internal quotation marks, and emphasis omitted). A complaint need not even \nspecify the precise nature of the claim asserted where the facts alleged put the defendant on notice. Self Di-\nrected Placement Corp. v. Control Data Corp., 908 F.2d 462, 466 (9th Cir. 1990). The district court's re-\nquirement of such specificity conflicts with its earlier statement that the United States Supreme Court had \n“rejected applying a heightened pleading standard to discrimination claims.” (ER 53:17-18 (citing Swier-\nkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 511).) \n \nIV. AFTER THE NOTICE DEFENSE IS STRIPPED AWAY, IT IS CLEAR FROM THE RECORD THAT \nUCD DISCRIMINATES AGAINST FEMALE ATHLETES IN VIOLATION OF TITLE IX AND § 1983. \n \nThe stakes involved in the forgoing discussion of the notice defense to Plaintiffs' Title IX claim and the dismissal of \nthe § 1983 claims become clearer when they are placed in the broader context of this case: the record establishes that \nUCD has plainly not provided the opportunities to women athletes required by federal law. \n \nA. UCD Discriminated Against Female Students, Including Plaintiffs, By Failing All Three Prongs of Title IX's \nThree-Part Test for Measuring Equal Accommodation. \n \nUCD has failed to provide female students, including Plaintiffs, with an equal opportunity to participate in varsity \nathletics. The evidence established that UCD was not in compliance with Title IX under any of the three prongs, or (at \nleast) that a material issue of fact existed on this point. \n \nThe three-part test should be viewed as a whole: \nPut another way, Part (1) provides that if institutions have not distributed athletic opportunities in numbers ‘substan-\ntially proportionate’ to the gender composition of their student bodies, they have presumptively violated Title IX. The \nrest of the test recognizes that there are circumstances under which, as a practical matter, something short of sub-\nstantial proportionality will suffice to rebut the presumption that Title IX has been violated. \n \nNeal v. Bd. of Trs., 1997 WL 1524813, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 26, 1997). \n \nBecause of the historic discrimination against females in athletics, Title IX requires “continued affirmative steps” by \ninstitutions to achieve equity, which “ ‘[i]n most cases . . . will entail development of athletic programs that substan-\ntially expand opportunities for women to participate and compete at all levels.’ ” Williams, 998 F.2d at 176 (quoting \nPolicy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,414) (AD 7). \n \n 1. UCD Admits Its Failure to Satisfy Both Prong One and Prong Three of the Three-Part Test, Because It Has \nNeither Achieved Substantial Proportionality Nor Effectively and Fully Accommodated Female Interest in \nAthletics. \n \nUCD has conceded that it cannot rely on Prongs One or Three of the three-part test as a basis for establishing com-\npliance with Title IX in this case. First, UCD admits, and the evidence establishes, that at all times relevant to this case, \nthe participation rates of women in varsity athletics were short of substantial proportionality by hundreds of varsity \nslots. (ER 1205 ¶ 5; 1710-13; 2279:1-18; 2289:11-2290:8; 3181:25-3182:9; 3195:25-3196:3; 5944 ¶14.) Indeed, in \n2001-2002, the very year that UCD forced women wrestlers to compete against men, UCD's female participation \nproportionality rates fell to their worst level since 1997, with a shortfall of 156 varsity opportunities for women. (ER \n1961.) Thus, no claim can be made that Prong One's proportionality test was satisfied. \n \nSecond, UCD also admits that it failed to fully and effectively accommodate the interest and ability of female students \nin varsity athletics in violation of Prong Three. (ER 1212 ¶ 42; 1713; 4400.) Hundreds of female students have sought \nvarsity status at UCD, only to be rejected time and time again. UCD's own admissions establish that it has known for \ndecades that it does not accommodate the significant interest and ability of women in athletics. (Supra note 12.) Thus, \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 25 \nthe legality of UCD's conduct turns on whether UCD has established, by evidence of undisputed material facts, that it \nwas in compliance with Prong Two and is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. UCD cannot establish as a matter of \nlaw that it satisfied Prong Two's requirement of having a history and continuing practice of program expansion for \nwomen during the periods relevant to this case, much less that it acted responsively to the developing interests of its \nfemale students. To the contrary, undisputed and disputed facts support Plaintiffs' contention that UCD failed to \nsatisfy those requirements. \n \n 2. UCD Did Not Satisfy the Requirements of Prong Two Because It Has Never Had a History and Continuing \nPractice of Program Expansion for Women. \n \nThe intensely factual nature of a Prong Two analysis coupled with the significant disputes in material fact should have \nprecluded summary judgment here. Prong Two saves non-proportional schools from violation if they can show “a \nhistory and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and \nabilities of the members of that sex.” Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418, Part VII.C.5.a. (2) (emphasis \nadded). (AD 11.) OCR's 1996 Clarification of the three-part test provides, in part: “In effect, part two looks at an \ninstitution's past and continuing remedial efforts to provide nondiscriminatory participation opportunities through \nprogram expansion.” (AD 24.) Of paramount importance is not the addition of teams, but rather whether “an institu-\ntion has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation opportunities provided to the underrepresented sex.” \n(AD 29 n.2.) Both parties' Title IX experts agree that an institution must expand actual participation opportunities for \nwomen every two to three years to remain in compliance with Prong Two. (ER 1962; 3200:13-18; 3216:25-3217:16; \n3246:3-3247:4; 3436:4-17; 3459:17-3460:11; 3488:13-3489:5.) Both the OCR and the few courts that have addressed \nProng Two have confirmed that it is a factually intensive analysis, which considers the number of students partici-\npating in athletics, as well as the developing interest and abilities of other students. (AD 24-26.) Cohen v. Brown Univ. \n(Cohen I), 809 F. Supp. 978, 981-82 (D.R.I 1992), aff'd, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1993). Court decisions have not de-\nfined  the  permissible  outer  limits  of  non-expansion  under  Prong  Two,  but  have  confirmed  that  periods  of \nnon-expansion in excess of nine years is too long. Cohen I, 809 F. Supp. at 979-80 (court approval of preliminary \ninjunction to stop elimination of team where no expansion from 1982 to 1991); Barrett v. West Chester Univ. of Pa., \n2003 WL 22803477, at *7 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (“periods in excess of a decade are too long to constitute continued ex-\npansion”). Notably, Plaintiffs are unaware of any court decision affirming a Prong Two defense asserted by an in-\nstitution. \n \nUCD bears the burden of proof to establish compliance with Prong Two. Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418, \nPart VII.C.5.a.(2) (AD 10); Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830. UCD has not met its burden on summary judgment where its \nown documents and other admissions establish that: (1) UCD did not expand opportunities for women whatsoever \nfrom 1971 to 1996, and (2) female participation opportunities actually contracted from 1997 to 2005, regardless of \nwhat teams UCD claims it added during this period, in large part because UCD eliminated existing varsity oppor-\ntunities in wrestling and other sports. (ER 1207 ¶ 17; 1209 ¶ 27; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; 1453; 1493; 1549; 1613; \n1710-13; 1961; 4132.) Additionally, even if the evidence established that UCD has expanded athletic opportunities for \nwomen, which it does not, UCD did not do so in a manner that was demonstrably responsive to the developing interest \nand abilities of women. UCD rejected applications for varsity status from hundreds of UCD female club sports athletes \nbetween 1995 and 2005 (ER 1211 ¶ 37; 5763-893), as well as terminated existing varsity opportunities, including \nPlaintiffs' (ER 1209 ¶ 27; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; 1453; 1493; 1549; 1961). \n \n a. UCD Has No History or Continuing Practice of Program Expansion. \n \nTitle IX's enactment did nothing to prompt UCD to expand its women's program to ensure equity. UCD did not expand \nfemale participation opportunities from 1972 to 1996. (ER 1207 ¶ 17; 1613; 1710-13; 4132.) Instead, UCD eliminated \nwomen's golf and women's field hockey during this time period. (ER 1208 ¶ 19; 1710-13; 2324.) Though UCD added \nwomen's soccer in 1983 after it eliminated women's field hockey, UCD admits that the addition did not result in \nprogram expansion for women. (ER 1207 ¶ 17; 1613; 1710-13; 4132.) \n \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 26 \nUCD also did not expand actual female opportunities from 1999 to 2005. (ER 1209 ¶ 27; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; \n1453; 1493; 1549; 1961.) Rather, UCD eliminated dozens of varsity opportunities, without replacing them or en-\ngaging in further expansion, during a time period in which female enrollment grew by over 2, 200 students. (Id.) \n \nIn the court below, UCD claims “expansion” because the percentage of women athletes relative to their enrollment \nincreased between 1995 and 2005. But this fact alone tells an incomplete story. In 1995, UCD was out of compliance \nby 20%. For a brief period, until 1999, it increased the actual athletic opportunities for women as well as narrowed the \nmargin between the percentage of women athletes relative to the percentage of women students. But from 1999 until \n2005, that margin fluctuated (it improved in 2000, but then worsened in 2001, 2002, 2003, and again in 2005), and the \nactual number of women's athletic opportunities declined - from 426 in 1999 to 368 in 2005. Moreover, the reason that \nmargin improved at all between 1999 and 2005 was because UCD was using roster caps to reduce the number of men's \nvarsity opportunities at the same time they were eliminating women's opportunities, thus improving the appearance, \nbut not the reality, of women's athletics at UCD. As conceded by UCD's Title IX expert, reductions in the men's \nathletic  program  is  not  program  expansion  for  women  under  Prong  Two.  (ER  3184:17-3185:3;  3280:8-14; \n4212:16-4313:5.) See OCR's 1996 Clarification (AD 25) (OCR will not find compliance with Prong Two “where an \ninstitution increases the proportional participation opportunities for the underrepresented sex by reducing opportuni-\nties for the overrepresented sex alone.”) (AD 25.) See Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830. (“[T]he ordinary meaning of the word \n‘expansion’ may not be twisted to find compliance under this prong when schools have increased the relative per-\ncentages of women participating in athletics by making cuts in both men's and women's sports programs.”) \n \nThe evidence establishes that UCD added three teams in 1996, but then rested on its laurels until prompted by this \nlitigation to add another team in 2005. In the meanwhile, UCD dropped female participation opportunities on existing \nvarsity teams, such as women's lacrosse, water polo, and wrestling. (ER 1204 ¶ 4; 1210 ¶ 33; compare ER 1388 with \n1401 and 1427; 2644-45; 2945:19-2946:18; 3206:8-3213:16; 3241:11-14; 3248:3-6.) UCD took no action to replace \nthese eliminated participation opportunities much less engage in program expansion. Between 1998 and 2005, female \nenrollment added over 2,200 women to UCD. (ER 1209 ¶¶ 27 & 29; 1375; 1388; 1401; 1427; 1453; 1493; 1549; 1961; \n3206:8-3212:16; 3241:11-14; 3248:3-6.) At the same time, 63 female participation opportunities were dropped at \nUCD, a drop that UCD's expert conceded was “drastic.” (Id.) By 2005, the athletic participation rates for women were \nat the lowest point since 1997. (Id.) UCD's failure to expand opportunities is determinative of the Prong Two analysis, \nor at the least, it is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact. \n \n b. UCD Eliminated Existing Female Participation Opportunities, Including Women's Varsity Wrestling. \n \nUCD's elimination of women's wrestling at a time when it was not otherwise complying with Title IX also precluded \nits reliance on Prong Two on summary judgment. Where an institution is not in compliance with Title IX, its elimi-\nnation of existing and viable female participation opportunities is evidence that Prong Two is not satisfied and con-\nstitutes a further violation of Title IX. See Barrett, 2003 WL 22803477, at *7 (elimination of women's gymnastic team \nwas evidence of non-compliance with Prong Two where institution was not otherwise in compliance with Title IX); \nCohen II, 991 F.2d at 897-98 (elimination women's volleyball and gymnastic teams was evidence non-compliance \nwith Prong Two); Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830 (elimination of women's softball team was evidence of non-compliance \nwith Prong Two). \n \nUCD's contended below that its elimination of the women's varsity wrestling program was not discriminatory because \nPlaintiffs had the opportunity to try out for the men's wrestling team. Requiring that women compete against men in a \ncontact sport, in order to have a varsity athletic opportunity, is hardly nondiscriminatory. If such a policy were gen-\nerally permitted there would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls thereby denying them a real \nopportunity to compete. This is precisely why courts have repeatedly upheld separate but equal athletic programs \nunder Title IX as constitutionally permissible. See, e.g., O'Connor v. Bd. of Educ, 449 U.S. 1301 (1980).[FN15] \n \nFN15. In fact, UCD's failure to create a separate women's wrestling team upon Plaintiffs' requests beginning \nin 2001 is a distinct violation of Title IX. For purposes of Title IX, wrestling is a contact sport. 34 C.F.R. § \n\n2009 WL 2444218 (C.A.9)   Page 27 \n106.41(b), 45 C.F.R § 86.41(b). OCR's 1979 Title IX Policy Interpretation explains that, with respect to \ncontact sports: \nEffective accommodation means that if an institution sponsors a team for members of one sex in a contact \nsport, it must do so for members of the other sex under the following circumstances: (1) The opportunities for \nmembers of the excluded sex have historically been limited; and (2) There is sufficient interest and ability \namong the members of the excluded sex to sustain a viable team and a reasonable expectation of intercolle-\ngiate competition for that team. \n \nPolicy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418, Part VII.C.4.a. (AD 11.) In the court below, UCD disregarded \nthis aspect of Title IX in its entirety. Instead, it claimed that it had no obligation to allow women to try out for \nthe men's wrestling team, but did so anyway, suggesting that in doing so it exceeded its obligations under \nTitle IX. Because wrestling is a contact sport from which women have been historically excluded, and be-\ncause, as the evidence demonstrates, there was and continues to be sufficient interest, ability and competition \nto sustain a viable women's wrestling team, UCD violated Title IX by refusing to field a women's wrestling \nteam after being asked repeatedly by Plaintiffs to do so. (See ER 1831; 2432; 2498:23-2499:27; 2889:9-25; \n3733:22-3734:19.) \n \nPlaintiffs were varsity wrestlers who were eliminated from the wrestling program because of their sex, and were then \nrefused the creation of a separate women's team by UCD. (ER 2512; 2935:9-2939:16; 3665:14-3666:8.) UCD elim-\ninated equal opportunities and replaced them with discriminatory requirements for continued participation. This vi-\nolates Title IX. \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should reverse: (1) the district court's order dismissing Plaintiffs' § 1983 \nclaims against all Defendants; (2) the district court's order denying Plaintiffs' leave to modify the scheduling order and \nto amend to add current students at UCD; (3) the district court's order granting summary judgment to UCD on Plain-\ntiffs' Title IX claim; and (4) the judgment for Defendants in this case. The case should be remanded for trial. \n \nAppendix not available. \n \nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs/Appellants, v.

INTRODUCTION \n2 Plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian, Christine Ng, and Lauren Mancuso are former students at the \n3 University of California at Davis (“UCD”) who were kicked out of the varsity wrestling program \n4 because they are women at a time when UCD was unlawfully depriving hundreds of other women an \n5 equal chance to play sports.  Plaintiffs hereby oppose the motions for summary judgment filed by \n6 individual Defendants Larry Vanderhoef, Robert Franks, Greg Warzecka, and Pam Gill-Fisher \n7 (collectively, “Defendants”) seeking judgment in their favor on the claim that they violated the \n8 Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which \n9 prohibits sex discrimination by state actors, when they took or approved the acts at issue in this case.     \n10 Defendants seek judgment in their favor based on the incredible argument that they did not \n11 single out Plaintiffs for mistreatment based on their gender or, alternatively, that the law prohibiting \n12 sex discrimination in athletics was not clearly established in 2000.  Defendants’ motions are an \n13 exercise in revisionist history based on heavily disputed facts not suitable for resolution on summary \n14 judgment.  Defendants were high ranking employees at UCD who, by their own admissions, \n15 participated in or approved of the decisions at issue in this case.  Defendants admitted to being well-\n16 trained in laws requiring gender equity in intercollegiate athletics and/or were responsible for \n17 ensuring that UCD’s athletic program treated women equally.  They either authored or had \n18 knowledge of UCD reports that revealed that UCD was not treating men and women equally in \n19 terms of varsity athletic participation opportunities program-wide.  Each knew that Plaintiffs and \n20 other women were competing against other women in the varsity wrestling program.  Each knew that \n21 Plaintiffs and other women were removed from the roster.  Each then either decided that Plaintiffs \n22 and other women would have to compete against men for their reinstatement in the varsity program, \n23 or ratified this decision.   \n24 Defendants not only miscast the misconduct alleged by Plaintiffs, they ignore evidence of \n25 their own unlawful acts, previous orders of this Court, and settled law establishing the constitutional \n26 rights at issue.  These strategies are fatal to each motion and accordingly, each motion should be \n27 denied.       \n28\n1\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 9 of 46\n \n1 II.  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n2 Plaintiffs contend that Defendants violated their equal protection rights in three ways.  First, \n3 Defendants afforded Plaintiffs fewer opportunities to compete in varsity athletics than they did men \n4 program-wide.  Second, Defendants purposefully removed Plaintiffs from the varsity wrestling \n5 program based on gender.  Third, Defendants imposed permanent barriers to the participation of \n6 Plaintiffs in the varsity wrestling program through their graduation from UCD.    \n7 Defendants present three flawed arguments to support their claim of entitlement to summary \n8 judgment.  First, they argue that Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim fails as a matter of law.  \n9 Defendants contend that Plaintiffs sought a guaranteed spot on a men’s team and otherwise refused \n10 to develop women’s wrestling at the club level as some other women’s varsity teams had done.  The \n11 facts establish, however, that Plaintiffs were already members of UCD’s varsity wrestling team \n12 competing against other women.  Demotion to the club level would have meant loss of significant \n13 varsity benefits.  Defendants next attempt to shift blame onto wrestling coach Michael Burch for the \n14 removal of the women from the wrestling program.  Yet, the evidence also shows that Warzecka and \n15 Gill-Fisher, not Burch, removed women from the program in 2000.  And, although Defendants \n16 contend that Plaintiffs were not skilled enough to make the wrestling team in 2001, the facts \n17 establish that each Defendant ratified the decision to fundamentally change the terms of Plaintiffs’ \n18 participation by requiring them to wrestle off against men for a spot in the program.  Thus, under the \n19 new terms of the program imposed by Defendants in 2001, it would have been nearly impossible for \n20 Plaintiffs to continue to participate in the varsity wrestling program, regardless of their wrestling \n21 skills.  Finally, the evidence shows that Defendants were also providing women, including Plaintiffs, \n22 with fewer varsity athletic opportunities than they afforded men relative to their enrollment.  \n23 Construing all facts in Plaintiffs’ favor, the Court should find that each Defendant deprived Plaintiffs \n24 of equal protection under the law.   \n25 Second, Defendants contend that even if Plaintiffs could establish a constitutional violation, \n26 each is entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law because it was not clearly established that \n27 their conduct violated the Constitution.  The United States Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit Court \n28\n2\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 10 of 46\n \n1 of Appeals, and other federal circuit courts of appeals hold otherwise.  Not only was the right to be \n2 free from sex discrimination under the Constitution clearly established decades before the period \n3 relevant to this case, its reach has extended to dozens of cases challenging sex discrimination in the \n4 context of high school and college athletics.  Defendants’ purported lack of knowledge or \n5 understanding of the law is belied not only by their own admissions, but also by evidence that \n6 Defendants deliberately ignored a protracted public outcry challenging their actions as \n7 discriminatory.  Moreover, Plaintiffs challenge through competent evidence the reasonableness of \n8 Defendants’ purported reliance on the resolution they reached unilaterally with the Office for Civil \n9 Rights (“OCR”), which neither considered constitutional claims nor adequately investigated \n10 Plaintiffs’ claims.  \n11 Third, Defendants analogize Plaintiffs’ equal protection claims to Title IX equal treatment \n12 claims to argue that the constitutional claims are time-barred.  Putting aside that Plaintiffs have never \n13 alleged Title IX equal treatment claims in this case, this Court expressly rejected this analogy in \n14 denying the statute of limitations argument on Defendants’ motion to dismiss the equal protection \n15 claim.  The Court refused to revisit this prior ruling on Defendants’ motion for judgment on the \n16 pleadings.  The Ninth Circuit is in accord.  The Court should refuse Defendants’ attempt at a  fourth \n17 bite at the apple, and deny their motions on this ground as well \n18 III.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n19 Plaintiffs filed suit on December 18, 2003.  (Dkt. # 1.)  On March 5, 2004, Defendants \n20 moved to dismiss a number of Plaintiffs’ claims, including their equal protection claim on the \n21 grounds that it was time-barred.  This Court denied the motion in its entirety, and expressly rejected \n22 Defendants’ argument that the equal protection claim was time-barred.  (Dkt. # 25.)  Defendants then \n23 filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings challenging Plaintiffs’ various state law, statutory and \n24 constitutional claims.  (Dkt. # 188-89.)  On October 18, 2007, this Court issued a decision \n25 dismissing some of Plaintiffs’ claims, and refusing to dismiss others.  (Dkt. # 226.)  Plaintiffs’ Equal \n26 Protection Clause claims (as enforced under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 ) were among those dismissed based \n27 on the Court’s finding that those claims were subsumed by the Title IX claim.  However, the Court \n28\n3\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 11 of 46\n \n1 refused to re-visit its finding with respect to the timeliness of the § 1983 claim.  (Dkt. # 226.)  \n2 Defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Title IX equal accommodation \n3 claim, which the Court granted on the grounds that Plaintiffs had not provided adequate notice of \n4 their Title IX claims before filing a suit for damages. (Dkt. # 368.) \n5 Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of the equal protection claim on the motion for judgment on \n6 the pleadings and the dismissal of the Title IX claim on summary judgment.  (Docket item # 376.)  \n7 Defendants once again raised their timeliness arguments with respect to the equal protection claim.  \n8 They also asked the Ninth Circuit to find them immune from suit on this claim based on qualified \n9 immunity.  On April 20, 2010, the Ninth Circuit issued its decision, reversing its dismissal of the \n10 Title IX and the section 1983 claims.  Mansourian v. Regents of the University of California, 602 \n11 F.3d 957 (9th Cir. 2010).  It noted this Court’s prior rejection of the § 1983 statute of limitations \n12 argument and held that Plaintiffs’ claims were not time-barred.  Id. at 973-74.  It also declined to \n13 rule on the qualified immunity defense because it was raised for the first time on appeal.  Id. at 974. \n14 IV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n15 A.  Defendants’ Authority in UCD’s Varsity Athletic Program.  \n16 Defendants Larry Vanderhoef, Robert Franks, Greg Warzecka and Pam Gill-Fisher \n17 (collectively, “Defendants”) were or are high ranking employees of Defendant Regents of the \n18 University of California (“Regents”) who were charged with overseeing the administration and \n19 operation of the varsity athletics program1 at the University of California at Davis (hereafter \n20 “UCD”).   (Plaintiffs’ Statement of Additional Disputed Facts in Support of Plaintiffs’ Opposition to \n21 Defendants’ Motions For Summary Judgment (“ADF”) 1.)   \n22 As the Chancellor of UCD, Defendant Larry Vanderhoef was ultimately responsible for \n23 UCD’s intercollegiate or varsity athletics program and compliance with gender equity requirements.  \n24 (ADF 65; Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Response to Defendants’ Separate Statements of “Undisputed” \n25 Material Facts in Support of the Motions for Summary Judgment, Vanderhoef (“Response to \n26                                                  \n1  The varsity athletic program at UCD has also been referred to as the “intercollegiate” \n27 athletic program.  The varsity/intercollegiate program is distinct from UCD’s club program.  \n28\n4\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

(ADF 66.)  In fact, \n3 Vanderhoef testified that the “buck” stopped with him.  (ADF 67.) \n4 Defendant Robert Franks was a senior administrator at UCD from 1994 to 2004, charged \n5 with oversight of the athletic department and actively involved in the events at issue in this case.  \n6 (ADF 76.)  As the Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Franks directly supervised the \n7 Athletic Director, met with him weekly, and could overrule his decisions.  (ADF 77, 78.)  Franks \n8 was responsible for ensuring that men and women were treated equally in the athletic department.  \n9 (ADF 79.)  He admitted that he was expected to understand laws prohibiting sex discrimination.  As \n10 a former practicing lawyer, he was also familiar with the equal protection guarantees of the United \n11 States Constitution.  (ADF 80, 81, 82.)   \n12 Defendant Greg Warzecka has been UCD’s Athletic Director since 1995, responsible for the \n13 overall direction, leadership, and management of the UCD Intercollegiate Athletic Program.  \n14 (ADF 100, 101, 102.)  He considered himself trained on gender equity issues, taught classes on the \n15 subject, and kept himself abreast of relevant developments in the law.  (ADF 103.)   \n16 From approximately 1985 to 2003, Defendant Pam Gill-Fisher was the Associate Athletic \n17 Director and Supervisor of Physical Education.  In 2003, Gill-Fisher was the Senior Associate \n18 Athletic Director and Senior Woman Administrator with significant responsibility in the \n19 intercollegiate athletic department.  Gill Fisher had a particular expertise in Title IX and had \n20 responsibility for UCD’s compliance with gender equity laws.  (ADF 126.)  Historically, she \n21 authored or significantly contributed to nearly every report related to gender equity at UCD, \n22 including reports that acknowledged UCD athletic department’s gender equity failings.  (ADF 127.)  \n23 She understood that UCD was prohibited from discriminating against women in their athletic \n24\n                                                 \n25 2  Plaintiffs’ Responses to the Separate Statement of “Undisputed” Material Facts of the other \nDefendants will similarly be called “Response to Franks UMF”, “Response to Gill-Fisher UMF”, \n26 and “Response to Warzecka UMF”.  All such responses are contained in Plaintiffs’ Consolidated \nResponse to Defendants’ Separate Statements of “Undisputed” Material Facts in Support of the \n27 Motions for Summary Judgment and separated by Defendant. \n28\n5\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

She was also the only consistent member of UCD’s Title IX workgroup, \n2 aside from the Title IX officer.  (ADF 129.)  Defendants Vanderhoef, Franks, and Warzecka relied \n3 on Gill-Fisher given her purported gender equity expertise.  (ADF 130-132.) \n4 B.  UCD’s Women’s Varsity Wrestling Program.  \n5 Plaintiffs are former UCD students who wrestled in high school and attended UCD, in large \n6 part, to wrestle.  (ADF 2.)  There was a long-standing women’s varsity or intercollegiate wrestling \n7 program at UCD.  (ADF 3.)  Since 1992, when women first began wrestling at UCD, the varsity \n8 wrestling program included both men and women, each competing against their respective sex.  \n9 (ADF 5.) Women wrestlers at UCD received highly-qualified coaching, wrestled using women’s \n10 freestyle rules rather than men’s collegiate rules, and received all of the benefits of varsity status.  \n11 (ADF 6.)  UCD sponsored a women’s division in its annual Aggie Open wrestling tournament.  \n12 (ADF 7.)   \n13 In 1995, UCD hired Michael Burch as a wrestling coach.  (ADF 8.)  Burch was interviewed \n14 for the job by a panel that included Afsoon Johnston, a female wrestler at UCD.  (Id.)  Johnston \n15 asked Burch during his interview whether he would be supportive of women’s wrestling; he assured \n16 the panel that he would be.  (Id.)  Women continued to wrestle at UCD as varsity athletes under the \n17 coaching of Burch throughout his tenure.  (ADF 9.)  As members of the team, women wrestlers \n18 attended practice regularly and had the same responsibilities as any other team member.  (ADF 10.)  \n19 They received coaching and attention unique to the needs of women wrestlers.  (ADF 11.)   \n20 UCD, including Defendants Franks, Warzecka and Gill-Fisher, admits that they were aware \n21 that Plaintiffs and other women were varsity wrestlers, who were listed on participation lists, official \n22 rosters, and the UCD wrestling event programs.  (ADF 4, 13, 89, 113, 111.)  Warzecka also admits \n23 that women wrestlers were counted by UCD as women varsity participants in official reports \n24 submitted by UCD to OCR.  (ADF 111.)  Defendants Franks, Gill-Fisher, and Warzecka admit that \n25 Plaintiffs were competing against other women in the varsity program.  (ADF 4, 89, 111.)  Plaintiffs, \n26 like the other women wrestlers, received benefits attendant to varsity status, including lockers, \n27 trainer services, academic support services, laundry services, and varsity coaching.  (ADF 12.)  Club \n28\n6\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Plaintifs also attended the end of the year \n2 team banquet and received honors from the coach.  (ADF 14.)  The NCAA certification paperwork, \n3 not required of club athletes, was required of the women wrestlers.  (ADF 15.)   \n4 C.  Defendants Remove Women from the Varsity Wrestling Program.    \n5 In October 2000, the women wrestlers were removed from the wrestling roster at the request \n6 of Warzecka, whose decision was directly influenced by Gill-Fisher.  (ADF 16, ADF 133, 134.)  \n7 Franks admits that he learned at some point that women had been removed from the wrestling roster.  \n8 (ADF 92.)  Franks also admits that Burch told him that Gill-Fisher did not want women wrestling \n9 and that Warzecka directed the removal of the women from the roster.  (ADF 92, 133, 134.)    \n10 Although Burch objected, he informed the women wrestlers of the athletic department’s \n11 directive.  (ADF 92, 133, 134.)  Burch permitted the women to continue to practice with the \n12 wrestling team.  (Id.)  Plaintiff Arezou Mansourian was injured during a wrestling practice in \n13 January 2001 and sought assistance from a varsity trainer.  (ADF 17.)  When Warzecka learned that \n14 one of the Plaintiffs was seeking trainer services after he ordered her removal from the team roster, \n15 he confronted Plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng to confirm that they were not to participate in wrestling \n16 because they were a liability to the university.  (ADF 18, 19, 116.)  He was loud, irritated, and \n17 intimidating to the Plaintiffs.  (ADF 117.)   \n18 Warzecka told Burch and the Plaintiffs that the women should form a club team if they \n19 wanted to wrestle.  (ADF 118.)  Franks admits that the Plaintiffs told him that they considered a \n20 move to club status to be a “demotion.”  (ADF 91.)  While Warzecka admitted that transfer from \n21 varsity to club status resulted in a loss of significant varsity benefits (ADF 119), he suggested that \n22 the women should view the formation of a club team as an opportunity, not a demotion (ADF 120).  \n23 The female wrestlers were distraught over the elimination of their wrestling opportunities.  \n24 (ADF 20.)  They complained to Burch, Franks, and Warzecka and requested that they be reinstated \n25 to the varsity wrestling program on the same terms as they had been previously, i.e., practicing and \n26 competing against women.  (ADF 21, 22.)  In April 2001, Mansourian and Ng submitted a complaint \n27 of sex discrimination with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”).  (ADF \n28\n7\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 15 of 46\n \n1 23.)  They charged they had been subject to gender discrimination due to the elimination of \n2 intercollegiate athletic opportunities for women.  (Id.)  Subsequently, Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso \n3 filed supplemental complaints of sex discrimination with OCR.  (Id.)  Each of the complaints was \n4 based on the UCD’s acts of sex discrimination in violation of Title IX.  (Id.)  Vanderhoef, Franks, \n5 Warzecka and Gill-Fisher were aware of Plaintiffs’ OCR complaints.  (ADF 21, 31, 97, 121, 138.)  \n6 Franks, Warzecka and Gill-Fisher were actively involved in formulating UCD’s defense to \n7 Plaintiffs’ various complaints about their removal from the wrestling program.  (Id.)  After the OCR \n8 complaints were filed, the OCR never interviewed any of the Plaintiffs or any other women \n9 wrestlers.  (ADF 24.)  Similarly, UCD’s Chief Title IX Compliance Officer, Dennis Shimek, admits \n10 he did not speak to the Plaintiffs and that the UCD did not independently investigate the Plaintiffs’ \n11 complaints.  (ADF 25.)  At the same time, soon after the OCR complaints were filed, UCD fired \n12 Burch for his support of women’s wrestling.  (ADF 27.)   \n13 Soon thereafter, each of the individual Defendants was bombarded by public outcry \n14 protesting the removal and continued exclusion of women from the varsity wrestling team.  (ADF \n15 28-30, 71-73, 123, 139.)  Students, student government, UCD employees, parents, members of the \n16 public, and legislators alike expressed their strong concerns that Defendants’ actions toward the \n17 women wrestlers were unfair and discriminatory through press, emails, protests, and petitions.  \n18 (ADF 29.)  Assemblywoman Helen Thomson challenged UCD’s efforts to demote the women \n19 wrestlers to club status as “separate but equal” treatment and threatened to withhold a significant \n20 source of funding on a UCD building in protest.  (Id.)  Vanderhoef, Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-\n21 Fisher were actively involved in responding to various complaints by others about UCD’s treatment \n22 of the women wrestlers.  (ADF 72-73, 93, 123, 136.) \n23 Despite the legal challenges by Plaintiffs and charges by many that removal of women from \n24 the wrestling program was sex discrimination, neither Franks nor Warzecka was aware of UCD \n25 hiring any outside consultant to evaluate their compliance with gender equity laws.  (Response to \n26 Franks UMF 19; Response to Warzecka UMF 42.)  All Defendants agree that they ignored the \n27 advice given by the one gender equity expert they did consult, Donna Lopiano, who suggested that \n28\n8\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

(ADF 74, 94, 125.)  \n3 D.  Defendants Deny Women Wrestling Opportunities By Insisting that They \nWrestle-Off Against Men for a Spot on the Roster.  \n4\nIn May 2001, UCD reinstated the women to the team by placing them on the roster list.  \n5\n(ADF 30.)  This reinstatement was meaningless as it occurred after the 2000-2001 wrestling season \n6\nwas over and there were no opportunities for the women to participate.  (Id.)    \n7\nIn September/October 2001, the OCR, unilaterally and without consultation with Plaintiffs, \n8\nnegotiated with Defendants a “voluntary resolution” of Plaintiffs’ OCR complaints.  (ADF 31.)  \n9\nDefendants Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher agreed to reinstate the women on the team as a \n10\nresolution of Plaintiffs’ complaints, conditioned on Plaintiffs’ ability to compete against men for \n11\nslots in the wrestling program using different competitive rules unique to male wrestling.  (ADF 32.)  \n12\nSignificantly, in reaching this resolution, UCD did not advise the OCR that the women wrestlers had \n13\npreviously only competed against other women.  (ADF 33.) \n14\nDefendants Warzecka and Gill-Fisher justified the requirement that Plaintiffs compete \n15\nagainst men in a try-out using male rules on the purported grounds that spots in the program were \n16\nlimited by roster caps.  (ADF 34.)  Yet significantly, Warzecka admits that the purpose of roster caps \n17\nwas to limit the number of male athletes so that UCD could address unequal treatment of men and \n18\nwomen in the program in terms of participation opportunities.  (Response to Franks UMF 8.)  Other \n19\nthan UCD’s women wrestlers, roster caps have never been applied to any women’s team at UCD.  \n20\n(ADF 37.)  Plaintiffs inquired whether, as females, they would have to comply with a roster cap \n21\nintended to limit the number of men participating in order to move toward gender equity in \n22\nparticipation opportunities.  (ADF 35.)  The women were told that they would have to comply with \n23\nthe male roster caps.  (Id.)  Franks researched the issue and approved the decision to require that \n24\nwomen be counted as participants under the male roster cap, despite agreeing that Plaintiffs’ request \n25\nthat there be a separate cap for men and women was not unreasonable.  (ADF 96.)  UCD’s expert \n26\ntestified that forcing women in a women’s program to be counted within a roster cap for the men’s \n27\nteam and to compete against men to be on the team is the effective elimination of the women’s \n28\n9\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

In fact, the Title IX expert consulted by Defendants3 later testified, “in this \n2 particular situation, U.C. Davis did something I’ve never seen before which was to count women as \n3 men and to apply the roster cap to the underrepresented sex as part of their designation as male … it \n4 just was inconceivable to – I’ve never seen women counted as men and had roster caps applied that \n5 way. …  It was pretty amazing.”  (Response to Franks UMF 8.)  \n6 The requirement that Plaintiffs be able to defeat male wrestlers for a spot on the team where \n7 they would compete against women only was not only unprecedented in the history of women in the \n8 program, it was an impossible hurdle.  (ADF 38.)  In the fall of 2001, Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso \n9 attended wrestling practices with the team.  (ADF39.)  At practice, Coach Zalesky was hostile to the \n10 women and did not provide them with any coaching, tips, or support.  (ADF 40.)  Feeling \n11 unwelcome and humiliated, Mansourian stopped attending practices.  (ADF 41.)  Ng wrestled off \n12 against Mancuso, who beat her.  (ADF 42.)  Mancuso then wrestled off against a male wrestler, who \n13 beat her.  (Id.)  Unable to compete against college-age male wrestlers, Plaintiffs were eliminated \n14 from the varsity wrestling program altogether.  (ADF 43.)  Thomson called Defendants’ resolution \n15 of Plaintiffs’ complaints “hollow” given the terms of the sham reinstatement.  (ADF 44.)  Plaintiffs \n16 Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso were devastated by their dismissal from varsity wrestling.  (ADF 20.)   \n17 Vanderhoef was aware of UCD’s actions regarding the elimination of women from the \n18 varsity wrestling team and subsequent “reinstatement” of them on unequal terms.  (ADF 72, 75; \n19 Response to Vanderhoef UMF 8, 11.)  Although he offered to allow a blue ribbon panel of experts to \n20 evaluate whether UCD’s actions with respect to the women wrestlers ran afoul of the law, \n21 Vanderhoef never convened such a committee.  (ADF 74.)  Significantly, despite his having the \n22 ultimate authority to overrule the decisions of Warzecka, Franks, or Gill-Fisher, Vanderhoef chose \n23 not to do so.  (ADF 75.) \n24 E.  Defendants Eliminate Women’s Wrestling as Gender Inequities Persist in \nAthletic Opportunities Program-Wide.       \n25\nDefendants Gill-Fisher, Warzecka, and Franks, and Vanderhoef admit that it was their \n26\n                                                 \n27 3  This Title IX expert, Donna Lopiano, is now Plaintiffs’ expert in this case. \n28\n10\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

(ADF 65-67, 79, 101-102, 126.)  \n2 Defendants Gill-Fisher, Warzecka, and Franks directly oversaw and/or directed the addition and \n3 elimination of teams and participated in gender equity committees.  (ADF 83-84, 105-106, 129-131.)  \n4 These three Defendants regularly monitored the number of varsity athletic participation \n5 opportunities provided to men as compared to women relative to their respective enrollments.  They \n6 prepared, reviewed, and/or verified Equity and Disclosure Act (“EADA”) Reports reflecting these \n7 figures.  (ADF 86, 107, 127.)  Defendant Vanderhoef admits that he frequently reviewed the issue of \n8 whether UCD was providing men and women equitable athletic participation opportunities as well.  \n9 (ADF 66.) \n10 UCD’s elimination of Plaintiffs’ varsity wrestling opportunities occurred against the \n11 backdrop of Defendants’ long and continuous history of failing to provide equal athletic \n12 opportunities for its female students.  (ADF 45.)  Defendants admit that UCD has never provided \n13 females with athletic opportunities that are substantially proportionate to their enrollment.  (ADF \n14 46.)  Between 1971 and 1996, UCD added no women’s teams whatsoever.  (ADF 49.)  For over 30 \n15 years, including since 1996, Defendants have provided men anywhere between 65 and hundreds of \n16 more varsity opportunities than they did women relative to enrollment number.   (ADF 47.)  Rather \n17 than ensuring equal treatment of men and women in terms of participation opportunities, Defendants \n18 have rejected varsity applications from hundreds of women club team members since 1995 alone.  \n19 (ADF 48, 50, 62-64, 106.) \n20 Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher admit that they were providing women with fewer \n21 proportionate varsity athletic opportunities than they provided men.  (ADF 48, 108.)  They \n22 understood that adding three teams in 1996 was not enough to address UCD’s significant gender \n23 equity concerns.  (ADF 51.)  In 1994, Gill-Fisher stated that UCD’s responsibility towards gender \n24 equity was incomplete, despite the addition of new teams.  (ADF 52.)  In 1998, Warzecka \n25 acknowledged that a gender imbalance in the athletic department “is not a new issue.”  (ADF 53.)  In \n26 October 2000, shortly before women were removed from the wrestling roster, Warzecka \n27 acknowledged in a letter to Coach Burch that it “remains a challenge” for UCD to achieve its gender \n28\n11\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Warzecka, Gill-Fisher and Franks either authored or reviewed other \n2 internal reports and memos that revealed that women were being provided proportionally fewer \n3 athletic opportunities.  (ADF 46.).   \n4 Despite having actual knowledge that they were not treating male and female students \n5 equally in terms of athletic participation opportunities, none of the Defendants took any action to \n6 remedy these glaring gender disparities.  Warzekca’s contention that indoor track for women was \n7 added in 1999 is disputed.  (ADF 56; Response to Warzecka UMF 2.)  Regardless of whether \n8 women’s indoor track was added as a new sport in 1999 (which it was not), UCD dropped a total of \n9 63 female participation opportunities from its athletic department during the period of 1999 and \n10 2005, enough to field several women’s varsity teams.  (ADF 57-59.)  UCD’s expert agrees the drop \n11 during this time period was “drastic.”  (ADF 60.).  Notably, although the number of women athletes \n12 was decreasing, female student enrollment experienced significant growth.  (ADF 61.)  From 1999-\n13 2005, UCD experienced an increase of over 2,200 women students.  (Id.)  To provide women with as \n14 many athletic opportunities as provided to men relative to their enrollment, UCD would have had to \n15 add at least 100 additional opportunities for women athletes in any given year between 1999 and \n16 2005.  (Id.)  Between 1995 and 2003, Defendants did not even communicate to female students that \n17 they could seek the addition of a new women’s varsity sport, or the process for doing so.  (ADF 62.)  \n18 Despite persisting gender inequities and further elimination of 64 varsity slots for women, \n19 Defendants did not add female varsity athletic opportunities until 2005, after they removed women \n20 from the varsity wrestling program and Plaintiffs filed suit.  (ADF 54, 63, 110.)  Defendants’ \n21 addition of women’s varsity golf added only seven opportunities for women at UCD.  (ADF 55.)  \n22 Notably, UCD did not have an existing women’s golf team.  Defendants had to spend a year \n23 recruiting before they could fill at team.  (ADF 55.)  At the same time, Defendants rejected five out \n24 of six applications received from women club teams that sought varsity status.  In so doing, the \n25 individual Defendants denied hundreds of interested female students the chance to play varsity \n26 sports.

Summary Judgment Should Be Denied Because Settled Law and Disputed Facts \nEstablish A Violation By Each Defendant of Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights.      \n3\nDefendants have not met their burden of establishing with undisputed facts that their removal \n4\nand permanent exclusion of women from the varsity wrestling program did not violate Plaintiffs’ \n5\nconstitutional rights, especially given the gender disparities in athletic opportunities program-wide.  \n6\nDefendants may not prevail on summary judgment on the equal protection claim if a material issue of fact \n7\nexists for trial.  Warren v. City of Carlsbad, 58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir. 1995).  Federal Rules of Civil \n8\nProcedure, Rule 56(c) states that summary judgment may be rendered only if   \n9\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \n10\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \n11\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \n12\nAll such evidence submitted must be interpreted in the light most favorable to the non-\n13\nmoving parties (here, Plaintiffs Mansourian, Ng and Mancuso).  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n14\n477 U.S. 242, 262 (1986); Gammoh v. City of La Habra, 395 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2005).

The nonmoving party need not \n18\nproduce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.  \n19\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).  However, evidence submitted by the moving \n20\nparty that would be inadmissible at trial may not be considered on a motion for summary judgment.  \n21\nSoremekun v.

Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d \n25\n1092, 1117 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Glenn K. Jackson Inc. v.

Co., 391 U.S. 253, 288-89 (1968); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, \n4 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).   \n5 Finally, each of the Defendants – not Plaintiffs– has “the burden of showing the absence of a \n6 genuine issue as to any material fact.”  Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970).  As \n7 set forth below, none of the Defendants have met this burden.  Summary judgment should be denied \n8 with respect to each Defendant, accordingly.   \n9 1.  At the Very Least, Plaintiffs Raise Genuine Issues of Material Fact as to \nWhether Each Defendant Violated a Constitutional Right.   \n10\na.  Defendants’ characterization of the claim at issue here is disputed. \n11\nDefendants’ motions are premised on the argument that the Constitution does not guarantee \n12\nwomen “special” treatment, including a guaranteed spot on a men’s athletic team.  Plaintiffs sought \n13\nneither.  The undisputed and disputed facts of this case, weighed in Plaintiffs’ favor, establish that:  \n14\n(1) Plaintiffs were members of UCD’s varsity wrestling program, competing against other women, \n15\njust as women had for years (ADF 2-15); (2) Warzecka and Gill-Fisher removed Plaintiffs from the \n16\nvarsity wrestling program based on their gender, and Franks and Vanderhoef ratified this decision  \n17\n(ADF 18, 75, 78, 96, 112, 133-143); (3) Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher ensured the permanent \n18\nexclusion of Plaintiffs from the program by imposing the discriminatory requirement that they \n19\nwrestle off men for a spot on the team, and Vanderhoef ratified this decision  (ADF 75, 98, 122, 135-\n20\n136); and (4) during this same period, Defendants were not treating women equally with respect to \n21\nathletic opportunities program-wide and were cutting opportunities in other women’s sports as well.  \n22\n(ADF 45-46, 57-61.)  These facts establish a violation of the equal protection clause of the United \n23\nStates Constitution, which prohibits sex discrimination in athletic programs. \n24\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \n25\nmandates that a state actor shall not “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection \n26\nof the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.  The Equal Protection Clause is enforced through 42 \n27\nU.S.C. § 1983 (“section 1983”), which provides: \n28\n14\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

As such, state officials may be held \n8 liable under section 1983 if there is, at minimum, an underlying constitutional tort.  Johnson v. City \n9 of Seattle, 474 F.3d 634, 638-39 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing Monnell v. Dep’t of Soc. Serv. of the City of \n10 New York, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978)).   \n11 Defendants were all state actors within the meaning of the statute.  (ADF 1.)  Plaintiffs \n12 contend and have presented evidence to establish that the Defendants violated their equal protection \n13 rights in three ways.  First, Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs equal protection of the law by \n14 denying them an equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.  Defendants, who decide which \n15 teams to add and which teams to eliminate, afforded men more varsity opportunities proportionate to \n16 their enrollment for decades through the time of Plaintiffs’ graduation.  (ADF 45-49, 57, 61.)  \n17 Second, Defendants purposefully removed Plaintiffs from the varsity program based on gender.  \n18 Third, Defendants permanently excluded Plaintiffs from the varsity wrestling program based on their \n19 gender.  Although Plaintiffs sought reinstatement to the program so they could continue competing \n20 against women, Defendants ensured their permanent exclusion from the program by requiring that \n21 they wrestle off against men for a spot in the program using different rules unique to male wrestling.  \n22 (ADF 75, 98, 122, 135-136.)  Notably, Defendants did not remove any men from the roster in 2000 \n23 and they did not impose comparable obstacles on male participation in 2001, by requiring, for \n24 example, that they wrestle off against larger football players for a spot in the wrestling program.  \n25 Plaintiffs contend that this gender-based mistreatment deprived them of equal protection of the law.  \n26 The United States Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have affirmed that the Equal \n27 Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution creates the right to \n28\n15\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

This prohibition extends to various forms \n2 of sex discrimination in both the spheres of employment and education.   Mississippi Univ. of \n3 Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 731 (1982) (denial of school admission to male applicants); United \n4 States v.  Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 519 (1996) (denial of admission of female applicants); Bator v. \n5 Hawaii, 39 F.3d 1021, 1029 (9th Cir. 1994) (sexual harassment in employment); Oona v. McCaffrey, \n6 143 F.3d 473, 474-75 (9th Cir. 1998) (peer sexual harassment in schools); Lindsey v. Shalmy, 29 \n7 F.3d 1382, 1386 (9th Cir. 1994) (sex discrimination at work shown by denial of promotion in favor \n8 of male candidate). \n9 The availability of this constitutional claim for Plaintiffs challenging gender-based decisions \n10 in high school and college athletics is well-settled.  See, e.g., Haffer v. Temple Univ., 678 F.Supp. \n11 517, 523, 526-27 (E.D. Pa. 1987), and cases cited therein; Brenden v. Indep. School District, 477 \n12 F.2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1973) (striking regulation barring girls from competing against boys in certain \n13 sports); Communities for Equity v. Michigan High School Athletic Ass’n, 459 F.3d 676, 693-95 (6th \n14 Cir. 2006 ) (affirming district court judgment for Plaintiffs on Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection and Title \n15 IX claims challenging high school athletic association’s decision to change scheduling of female \n16 athletes seasons); Alston v. Virginia High School League, Inc., 144 F. Supp. 2d 526, 533-34, 538 \n17 (W.D. Va. 1999) (denying Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ 1983 claims in \n18 case involving schedule change for women’s teams but not men’s teams.)  The case of Haffer v. \n19 Temple University is directly on point.  The court there denied defendants’ motion for summary \n20 judgment on an equal protection claim brought by female students who alleged that defendants \n21 offered men more intercollegiate athletic opportunities than female opportunities proportionate to \n22 enrollment, and thus deprived women of an equal opportunity to participate.  678 F. Supp. at 523, \n23 526-27.   \n24 In fact, the Ninth Circuit and other Circuits have repeatedly affirmed that there is an \n25 important government interest in promoting equality of opportunity and in redressing past \n26 discrimination against women in athletics, even if this means decreasing opportunities for men.   \n27 Clark  v. Arizona Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1982) (holding that the policy \n28\n16\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Noting in dicta that boys would \n4 have an “undue advantage” if allowed to compete against women for positions on the volleyball \n5 team); Neal v. Bd. of Trs. of Cal. State Univ., 198 F.3d 763, 769-72 (9th Cir. 1999) (rejecting \n6 constitutional challenge brought by male wrestlers whose team was eliminated by school attempting \n7 to achieve gender equity); Miami Univ. Wrestling Club v. Miami Univ., 302 F.3d 608  (6th Cir. \n8 2002) (holding that men’s rights not violated when institution eliminates a male team to achieve \n9 gender equity in compliance with Title IX.)   \n10 The Supreme Court has held that a party seeking to uphold a gender-based classification \n11 “must carry the burden of showing an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for that classification.”  \n12 Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 724. The state must show that the sex-based classification \n13 serves an important governmental objective and that its means are substantially related to the \n14 achievement of those objectives.  Id.   Here, Defendants present no evidence or argument to justify \n15 their failure to ensure that women have equal opportunities to participate in intercollegiate athletics, \n16 or their exclusion of women from the wrestling program.  Nor do they contend that the elimination \n17 of the women’s intercollegiate wrestling opportunities at UCD served an important governmental \n18 objective.  Defendants similarly make no effort to establish a direct relationship between an \n19 important government objective and the elimination of the female wrestling opportunities.  Indeed, \n20 Defendants cannot justify the elimination of female wrestling opportunities, where they were  \n21 eliminating (rather than adding) female opportunities elsewhere in the program.   (ADF 57-61.)   \n22 Instead of providing a legal justification for their removal and exclusion of Plaintiffs from the \n23 wrestling program, as they must, Defendants deny any involvement with the removal of the women \n24 from the roster in 2000.  This assertion is not only disputed, it is not determinative here where \n25 Defendants admittedly required Plaintiffs to wrestle off against men for their reinstatement.   \n26 (Response to Franks UMF 8, Gill-Fisher UMF 11, Vanderhoef UMF 7, Warzecka UMF 18.)   \n27 Defendants next mischaracterize Plaintiffs’ claim as one for preferential treatment that is not \n28\n17\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

They argue that allowing women on the team when they lacked the skills \n2 to beat men would have been discriminatory against men trying to make the team.  However, the \n3 ability of women does have to be equal to that of men where they compete against women using \n4 different rules.  (Response to Franks UMF 31.)  To the extent that Defendants suggest that the \n5 women were not skilled even as competitors against women, this is disputed, not to mention \n6 irrelevant.  (Response to Warzecka UMF 6, 8, 20, 46, 47.)  Warzecka and UCD’s experts both agree \n7 that the varsity program includes athletes of varying skills levels.  (Response to Warzecka UMF 6.)   \n8 Finally, Defendants suggest that Plaintiffs were never “true varsity” athletes in the program and that \n9 they sought either the creation of a new team or an exception for them in the roster cap of the men’s \n10 team.  Each of these contentions is disputed. (Response to Franks UMF 8, Gill-Fisher UMF 10.)   \n11 Defendants do not cite any other cases which actually support their position.  Their reliance \n12 on Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668 (9th Cir. 2001) is curious, at best.  There, the Court, \n13 applying rational basis review to a disability discrimination claim found there was no violation of the \n14 equal protection clause.  Id. at 687.  Lee does not discuss qualified immunity, or even gender \n15 discrimination, and therefore, has no relevance to the matters at issue here.  Force v. Pierce City R-\n16 VI School Dist., 570 F. Supp. 1020, 1031 (W.D. Mo. 1983) is similarly distinguishable.  First, this \n17 non-precedential district court case does not address qualified immunity and applied an outdated \n18 standard of review to a claim of gender discrimination.  Id. at 1029.  Additionally, unlike the \n19 plaintiff in Force, who sought the right to spot on the boys’ football team without a try-out, Plaintiffs \n20 sought neither the right to join a men’s team nor preferential treatment.  \n21 Defendants then proceed to vaguely argue that there is no constitutional right to participate in \n22 school athletics, citing Gonyo v. Drake University, 837 F. Supp. 989 (S.D. Iowa 1993) and Miami \n23 University Wrestling, 302 F.3d 608.  Not only are Plaintiffs’ claims here far more nuanced than this \n24 proposition, these cases are factually distinguishable.  In Gonyo, plaintiffs were male wrestlers \n25 challenging the constitutionality of their team’s elimination.  837 F. Supp. at 991. The court denied \n26 plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction ordering defendants to reinstate men’s wrestling, \n27 finding that injunctive relief might undermine the remedial purpose of Title IX to protect women’s \n28\n18\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Id. at 995-996.  \n2 Similarly, in Miami University Wrestling Club, the court simply affirmed the well-settled law that a \n3 school does not violate a male student’s constitutional equal protection rights by eliminating a male \n4 sports team in the effort to comply with Title IX.  302 F.3d at 614-616. \n5 Defendants’ arguments demonstrate the inappropriateness of summary judgment in this case.  \n6 Each of their contentions is a gross distortion of the facts of this case and contradicted by the \n7 plethora of disputed facts that defeat summary judgment.  \n8\nb.  Defendants’ reliance on Title IX jurisprudence is misplaced.  \n9 Defendants’ reliance on regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of \n10 1972 and interpreting case law does not support their motions.  Different standards apply to a Title \n11 IX and equal protection claim.  See, e.g., Jeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1226-27 (9th Cir. 1994) \n12 (citing Canterino v. Wilson, 546 F. Supp. 174, 210 (W.D. Ky. 1982), vacated on other grounds, 869 \n13 F.2d 948 (6th Cir. 1989)).  Even if there were no Title IX violations, which there are, it does not \n14 mean that the Defendants’ actions were in all respects lawful.  See, e.g., Mississippi Univ. for \n15 Women, 458 U.S. at 732 (although Title IX expressly permitted traditionally single-sex university, \n16 sexual segregation at the university violated the 14th amendment).   \n17 Defendants advance the unremarkable proposition that Title IX does not require that a school \n18 provide the same sports for men and women and allows a school to determine which sports to \n19 sponsor.  Plaintiffs do not dispute this contention.  This is, however, entirely irrelevant to whether \n20 UCD’s actions in removing and demoting existing female varsity athletics were constitutional.  \n21 Defendants then argue that Title IX does not require the establishment of a separate team for a few \n22 interested women, citing Cohen v. Brown University, 991 F.2d 888, 898 (1st Cir. 1993) and Roberts \n23 v. Colorado State Board of Agriculture, 998 F.2d 824, 830 n.10 (10th Cir. 1993).  Again, \n24 Defendants’ argument is misplaced.  Here, Plaintiffs sought reinstatement back into the program on \n25 the same terms, not the creation of new varsity opportunities.   \n26 The misconduct actually alleged by Plaintiffs is sufficient to establish a violation of the equal \n27 protection clause.  Even if Defendants had never eliminated women wrestling opportunities in \n28\n19\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Haffer, 678 F. Supp. at 526-27 (E.D. \n3 Pa. 1987).  Because Plaintiffs raise sufficient disputed facts on this motion to support their claims \n4 and Defendants’ Title IX arguments are off-base, no Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.   \n5 2.  Plaintiffs Raise A Genuine Issue of Material Fact With Respect to The \nIndividual Liability of Each Defendant.     \n6\nUnable to avoid facts giving rise to a constitutional violation, each of the Defendants try to \n7\nside-step personal liability for the misconduct at issue this case.  However, the record contains \n8\nsufficient evidence for a jury to find that Defendants Vanderhoef, Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher \n9\nacted with an unconstitutional motive.  “To survive summary judgment on the issue of motive, the \n10\nplaintiff must “put forward specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that establish improper \n11\nmotive.”  Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d. 895, 907 (9th Cir. 2001) (quoting Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 \n12\nU.S. 574, 598 (1998)); Bingham v. City of Manhattan Beach, 341 F.3d 939, 948-49 (9th Cir. 2003) \n13\n(holding that plaintiff needs evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable trier of fact to find by a \n14\npreponderance of the evidence that the individual Defendant’s conduct was motivated by gender \n15\ndiscrimination.)   \n16\nDefendants’ singled Plaintiffs out for mistreatment based on the gender by removing them, \n17\nnot men, from the program in 2000.  They also imposed discriminatory barriers on Plaintiffs and \n18\nother women to prevent their future participation in the program and without imposing comparable \n19\nbarriers on men.  They were also personally responsible for deciding that UCD should provide \n20\nPlaintiffs and other women fewer opportunities than men to participate in varsity athletics program-\n21\nwide.  Notably, no Defendant has presented evidence or even argument that their conduct served an \n22\nimportant government interest.  The following disputed and undisputed facts establish intentional \n23\ndiscrimination by each Defendant sufficient to defeat summary judgment:   \n24\na.  Disputed Facts Establish Defendant Vanderhoef’s Liability.   \n25\nChancellor Vanderhoef contends that he should not be held liable for the claims at issue in \n26\nthis case because although he was aware of the alleged misconduct here, he was not directly \n27\ninvolved in decision-making.  Vanderhoef relies on the wrong standard of liability for constitutional \n28\n20\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 28 of 46\n \n1 claims.  In a binding precedential decision establishing the standard for qualified immunity of \n2 supervisors, the Ninth Circuit has held that that “direct, personal participation is not necessary to \n3 establish liability for a constitutional violation.”  al-Kidd v. Ashcroft, 580 F.3d 949, 965 (9th Cir. \n4 2009).  The Court explained:  \n5\nSupervisors can be held liable for the actions of their subordinates (1) for \nsetting in motion a series of acts by others, or knowingly refusing to terminate \n6\na series of acts by others, which they knew or reasonably should have known \n7 would cause others to inflict constitutional injury; (2) for culpable action or \ninaction  in  training,  supervision,  or  control  of  subordinates;  (3)  for \n8 acquiescence  in  the  constitutional  deprivation  by  subordinates;  or  (4)  for \nconduct that shows a “reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.” \n9\nLarez v. City of Los Angeles, 946 F.2d 630, 646 (9th Cir.1991) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Any one of these bases will suffice to establish the \n10\npersonal involvement of the defendant in the constitutional violation.  Id. at \n11 965.  \nVanderhoef admits that he was responsible for UCD’s athletics program and compliance with \n12\ngender equity requirements.  (ADF 65, 67.)  He admits that he tracked UCD’s Title IX compliance \n13\nand met frequently with officials regarding gender equity.  (ADF 66.)  He admits that at some point \n14\nhe was aware that Plaintiffs and other women had been removed from varsity wrestling roster and \n15\nthat the other Defendants subsequently “reinstated” the Plaintiffs on unequal terms. (ADF 71.)  He \n16\nalso admits that he knew that many people challenged these actions as discriminatory, including \n17\nPlaintiffs and their Assemblywoman Helen Thomson.  He admits that he was actively involved in \n18\nresponding to Thomson’s complaint.  (ADF 72-73.)  For example, although he offered to convene a \n19\nblue ribbon panel of experts to evaluate whether UCD’s actions with respect to the women wrestlers \n20\nran afoul of the law, Vanderhoef never convened such a committee.  (ADF 74.)  Significantly, \n21\ndespite Vanderhoef having the ultimate authority to overrule the decisions of Warzecka, Franks, or \n22\nGill-Fisher to remove women from the roster and to impose discriminatory conditions for \n23\nreinstatement, he chose not to do so.  (ADF 75.)  Vanderhoef’s limited contact with some of the \n24\nPlaintiffs is not material to the issue of his liability where these facts established that he ratified \n25\ndiscriminatory conduct, which deprived Plaintiffs of equal protection of law.  al-Kidd, 580 F.3d at \n26\n965.   \n27\nVanderhoef, like Franks, Warzecka and Gill-Fisher, contends that he reasonably relied on \n28\n21\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 29 of 46\n \n1 UCD’s voluntary resolution with OCR as a lawful resolution of Plaintiffs’ claims arising under Title \n2 IX of Education Amendments of 1972.  (Response to Vanderhoef UMF 21.)  However, the OCR did \n3 not reach any conclusion that Defendants’ actions were lawful, even applying Title IX standards.  \n4 (ADF 31.)  Even if there were no Title IX violations, which there are, it does not mean that the \n5 Defendants’ actions were in all respects lawful.  See, e.g. Mississippi Unive. for Women, 458 U.S. at \n6 732.  As discussed above, different standards apply to Title IX and equal protection claims.  \n7 Moreover, the OCR did not and cannot consider constitutional questions.  Garber v. City of Clovis, \n8 698 F. Supp. 2d 1204, 1214 (E.D. Cal. 2010).   \n9 Plaintiffs also have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the OCR \n10 process to resolve any claims, much less an equal protection claim.  The OCR failed to interview the \n11 Plaintiffs, other women wrestlers or Burch before entering into a Voluntary Resolution Plan with \n12 UCD.  (ADF 24, 31.)  Moreover, Defendants never advised The OCR that the women previously \n13 competed against women in the program, not men.  (ADF 33.)  Without knowledge of this \n14 significant fact, The OCR agreed to a resolution premised on the inaccurate assumption that \n15 Plaintiffs were being reinstated on the same terms. \n16 Despite his responsibility, Vanderhoef took no affirmative steps to ensure that the athletic \n17 department complied with laws requiring gender equity.  (ADF 68.)  Instead, he simply trusted those \n18 around him.  (ADF 69.)  Thus, Vanderhoef knowingly refused to terminate the acts of his \n19 subordinates despite serious concerns about the constitutionality of their acts.  He failed to supervise \n20 them and ultimately acquiesced to their constitutional violations.  Weighing the facts in Plaintiffs’ \n21 favor, the Court should find sufficient facts to take to a jury regarding Vanderhoef’s individual \n22 liability.  al-Kidd, 580 F.3d at 965. \n23\nb.  Disputed Facts Establish Defendant Franks’ Liability.   \n24 Franks’ attempts to distance himself from the intentional discrimination at issue in this case \n25 are contradicted by his admissions, and thus preclude summary judgment.  He contends that he had \n26 no involvement in the day to day operation of UCD’s athletic teams, or in the selection of students to \n27 fill team rosters or receive grants in aid.  (Response to Franks UMF 2, 3.)  However, he was charged \n28\n22\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 30 of 46\n \n1 with oversight of the athletic department and met with the Athletic Director weekly to discuss issues \n2 arising in the department.  (ADF 76-78.)  He also admits that he was responsible for ensuring that \n3 men and women were treated equally in the athletic department.  (ADF 79, 83, 84, 87.)  It was his \n4 job to ensure that coaches or his subordinates did not rely on discriminatory criteria in selecting team \n5 members or grant in aid recipients.  (Response to Franks UMF 3.)   \n6 Franks denies that he intentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs, contending that he “had \n7 no involvement” in determining who would fill the spots on the wrestling team roster in the fall of \n8 2000 or in try-outs for the team in the fall of 2001.  (Franks MPA (Dkt. #434) 14.)  However, his \n9 denial is a disputed material fact.  Franks assumed the lead role on behalf of UCD in responding to \n10 Plaintiffs’ discrimination complaints about: (1) their removal from the team; (2) the requirement that \n11 they wrestle off against men for their reinstatement; (3) the inclusion of women in roster caps; and \n12 (4) the attempt to “demote” them to club status without significant varsity benefits.  (ADF 91.)   \n13 Franks argues that it cannot be found by a jury that he intentionally discriminated against \n14 Plaintiffs because his response to the OCR complaint “can hardly be classified as “deliberate \n15 indifference.”  (Franks MPA (Dkt. #434) at 16.)  That Franks responded to a complaint is not the \n16 determinative factor for a jury.  Rather, the jury must evaluate how he responded to this complaint.  \n17 Plaintiffs present sufficient evidence to establish that Franks responded to Plaintiffs’ complaint with \n18 additional acts of gender discrimination, and thus, defeat summary judgment.  (Response to Franks \n19 UMF 6, 7.) \n20 First, rather than place the women back on the roster immediately after learning that they had \n21 been removed, Franks suggested that they form a club team despite acknowledging that this would \n22 result in the loss of significant varsity benefits.  (Response to Franks UMF 5, 16; ADF 11-14.)  Any \n23 suggestion that the women wanted a demotion to club status is disputed.  (Response to Franks UMF \n24 14.)  Notably, Franks did not suggest that any existing male member of the varsity wrestling \n25 program move to club status.  Franks argues that his offer of a club team to Plaintiffs was \n26 appropriate because “the primary process” for the development of a varsity team was development at \n27 the club level first.  Not only is Defendants’ characterization of this supposed process disputed \n28\n23\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 31 of 46\n \n1 (Response to Franks UMF 21), it is also disputed because Plaintiffs were already members of the \n2 varsity program and thus were not seeking to develop new varsity opportunities.  (Response to \n3 Franks UMF 20, 21.)   \n4 Second, Franks’ testimony that the women were initially removed from the roster because of \n5 a “misunderstanding” is disputed.  While Franks placed the women back on the wrestling roster in \n6 May 2001 after the season was completed, this did not resolve Plaintiffs’ complaints in an equitable \n7 manner.  The reinstatement occurred after the 2000-2001 wrestling season was over and there were \n8 no opportunities for the women to participate.  (Response to Franks UMF 9; ADF 30, 38.) \n9 Third, Franks approved the decision to apply a single roster cap that was inclusive of men \n10 and women, even though he believed Plaintiffs’ position that men should be within a separate cap \n11 was reasonable.  He was also unable to articulate a reason for this decision other than that a separate \n12 cap was purportedly not required.  (ADF 96.)  When pressed, Franks admitted that he did not \n13 personally contact any gender equity experts on this point and admitted that he had no idea whether \n14 any of them supported his decision on roster caps.  (Response to Franks UMF 15.)  Indeed, UCD’s \n15 own expert decried the application of a single roster cap inclusive of female opportunities because \n16 this would lead to the effective elimination of the women’s program.  (Response to Franks UMF 8; \n17 ADF 36.)   \n18 Fourth, Franks responded to Plaintiffs’ discrimination complaint by imposing on them the \n19 impossible requirement that they beat men using different rules for an opportunity in the program, \n20 despite the fact that they competed only against women.  (ADF 98.)  This is akin to forcing female \n21 track athletes to compete against male track athletes in their events as a condition of the participation \n22 in the program.  While Franks imposed new and impossible burdens on the participation of women \n23 in the program, he did not change the terms of male participation by, for example, forcing them to \n24 pin much larger football players for a spot on the team.  While Franks contends that he had “no \n25 involvement” with try-outs for the wrestling team in the fall of 2001, he admitted that he meant only \n26 that he was not physically present during the try-out.  (Response to Franks UMF 24, ADF 98.)  \n27 Franks approved UCD’s decision to impose the requirement that Plaintiffs wrestle off against men \n28\n24\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 32 of 46\n \n1 for their reinstatement in the program.  (ADF 98.)    \n2 Franks suggests that he should not be held liable because he did not have multiple or \n3 substantive contacts with all of the Plaintiffs.  However, his liability does not hinge on his direct \n4 contact with Plaintiffs.  al-Kidd, 580 F.3d at 965 (“direct, personal participation is not necessary to \n5 establish liability for a constitutional violation”).  Franks was involved in and approved decisions \n6 that harmed all of the Plaintiffs, including UCD’s removal of the women from the varsity wrestling \n7 roster in 2000 and the decisions requiring a wrestle off against men in 2001.  (Response to Franks \n8 UMF 3, 29, 34; ADF 97, 98.)  Similarly, Franks’ purported lack of direct contact with the OCR is of \n9 no import where he admits that he directed UCD’s response to the OCR complaint.  (Response to \n10 Franks UMF 23; ADF 95, 97.)    \n11 Finally, a jury may find that Franks intentionally discriminated against Plaintiffs by ensuring \n12 the elimination of female wrestling opportunities at a time when he was not providing women equal \n13 opportunities program-wide.  Franks admits that he reviewed UCD’s proposed addition or \n14 elimination of teams and that he was responsible for ensuring that UCD was providing women with \n15 equitable athletic participation opportunities.  (ADF 84, 87.)  Nonetheless, Franks took no action \n16 when faced with memos expressing serious concern about UCD’s compliance with gender equity \n17 laws in terms of participation opportunities or EADA reports that confirmed that UCD was short by \n18 hundreds of female opportunities.  (ADF 86, 88, 46, 47, 50, 57-59, 61; see also Evid A:48 at 11 & \n19 appendix A to ADF.)  While Franks and the other Defendants revere UCD’s club sport program, \n20 club sports do not offer the vast and significant benefits of the intercollegiate/varsity sports program.  \n21 (Response to Warzecka UMF 3.)  Franks ignored the advice of a gender equity expert, Donna \n22 Lopiano, to convene a panel of experts to evaluate the lawfulness of his actions.  (ADF 14.)  Indeed, \n23 as Plaintiffs were being excluded from wrestling, EADA reports (that Franks carefully reviewed) \n24 revealed that the athletic department was cutting dozens of female opportunities in other women’s \n25 sports despite an increase in female student enrolment.  (ADF 57-61.)  Franks’ failure to ensure that \n26 female students, including Plaintiffs, had an equal opportunity to participate in varsity athletics is \n27 sufficient to establish a violation of the equal protection clause.  Haffer, 678 F.Supp. at 526-27. \n28\n25\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

(ADF 24, 31-33; Response to Franks UMF 23.)  Indeed, \n4 if proven at trial, the many facts cited above are sufficient to establish that Franks violated the \n5 constitutional rights of Plaintiffs. \n6 c.  Disputed Facts Establish Defendant Warzecka’s Liability.   \nWarzecka has been responsible for the overall direction, leadership, and management of the \n7\nUCD Intercollegiate Athletic program since 1995.  (ADF 101.)  Warzecka was responsible for \n8\nensuring gender equity in the athletic department.  (ADF 102, 104-106.)  Warzecka was well aware \n9\nthat UCD was offering women far fewer intercollegiate participation opportunities than it did men \n10\nbased on these EADA Reports and other documents reviewed or prepared by him.  (ADF 46, 47, 50, \n11\n57-9, 61, 107, 108; see also Evid A:48 at 11 &  appendix A to ADF.)  Indeed, in October 2000, \n12\nshortly before women were removed from the wrestling roster, Warzecka acknowledged in a letter to \n13\nCoach Burch that it “remains a challenge” for UCD to achieve its gender equity goals.  (ADF 109.)  \n14\nWhile Warzecka admits that the addition of opportunities every 4-6 years was required of UCD to \n15\nachieve gender equity compliance (ADF 110), he failed to respond to the drastic reduction in female \n16\nopportunities over a nearly ten year period including the elimination of female wrestling \n17\nopportunities.  These disputed facts alone are sufficient to defeat summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ \n18\nclaim that Warzecka intentionally treated them differently because of their gender.  Haffer, 678 \n19\nF.Supp. at 526-27. \n20\nWarzecka admits that he knew that women were participating in the varsity wrestling \n21\nprogram competing against women.  (ADF 111.)  Yet, in October 2000, Warzecka ordered Burch to \n22\nremove the women wrestlers, which resulted in their loss of significant varsity benefits.  (ADF 112, \n23\n116-117, 119-120).  Burch denies Defendants’ contention that the women were removed because \n24\nthey were supposed to be counted under a single roster cap for the program.  (Response to Franks \n25\nUMF 8.)  This disputed fact lies at the very heart of this case.  Warzecka ordered the removal of the \n26\nwomen from the roster because they were women and only later relied on caps to justify his actions.  \n27\n(Response to Warzecka UMF 4, 15, 17.)  Warzecka admits that he later confirmed with the women \n28\n26\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 34 of 46\n \n1 directly that they were no longer part of the program.  Plaintiffs testified that he did so in a loud, \n2 angry and intimidating manner.  (ADF 116-117.)  Notably, Warzecka did not order the removal of \n3 any men from the program.  Nor did he suggest that any men from the roster join a club team, as he \n4 suggested to the female Plaintiffs.  (ADF 119-120.)  Warzecka’s removal of women from the roster \n5 (ADF 112, 116-117) and his suggestion that they accept a demotion to the club level instead (ADF \n6 118-120) are disputed facts that are also sufficient to defeat summary judgment.  (See Response to \n7 Warzecka UMF 3, 4, 13, 30-33.) \n8 A jury may also find that the insistence of Warzecka and other Defendants in 2001 that \n9 Plaintiffs wrestle off against men using male wrestling rules as a condition of their continued \n10 participation in the program was intentional gender discrimination.  (ADF 122; Response to \n11 Warzecka UMF 4.)  For the reasons set forth above, the fact that UCD’s unilateral agreement with \n12 the OCR with respect to Plaintiffs’ Title IX claims contained this requirement does not absolve \n13 Warzecka’s constitutional misconduct, especially where Warzecka admits that he does not recall \n14 advising the OCR that women previously competed against women, not men.  (ADF 33.) \n15 Warzecka contends that the requirement that they wrestle off against men was the only way \n16 to ensure that the most skilled wrestlers fell within the single roster cap for the program.  He also \n17 argues that the requiring Plaintiffs to wrestle off against men did not deprive them of equal \n18 protection of the law because men were also required to try out for a spot in the varsity program.  \n19 (Warzecka MPA (Dkt. #452-3) at 12.)  Yet, men were required to wrestle off against their own \n20 gender while the women were required to wrestle off against the opposite gender.   \n21 Like Gill-Fisher, Warzecka even goes so far as to claim that UCD would have been engaging \n22 in reverse discrimination against men if Plaintiffs were allowed on the team without the skills to beat \n23 men.  This argument fails, however, because it was Warzecka’s decision to impose a single roster \n24 cap that included female members of the team, contrary to the gender equity purposes of the cap.  \n25 (ADF 113-115; Response to Warzecka UMF 21, 22.)  Further, UCD has never previously or since \n26 imposed roster caps on its women’s intercollegiate varsity teams.  (Response to Franks UMF 8, \n27 Response to Warzecka UMF 15.)   \n28\n27\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 35 of 46\n \n1 Nothing prevented Warzecka or anyone else at UCD from simply allowing women the \n2 continued opportunity to wrestle by not counting women members in a men’s roster cap.  Plaintiffs \n3 dispute that UCD’s wrestling program was a “men’s team” or that they wanted a guaranteed spot on \n4 a men’s team.  They wanted to continue to compete against women using rules unique to women’s \n5 wrestling.  Thus, Warzecka’s contention that he did not engage in sex discrimination because he also \n6 required men to wrestle off men for a spot on the team rings hollow.  The ability of women does not \n7 have to be equal to that of men where they compete against women and use different competitive \n8 rules.  (Response to Franks UMF 31).  At a time when Warzecka approved the elimination of female \n9 participation opportunities program-wide (ADF 112, 114, 122), disputed facts establish that \n10 Warzecka purposefully changed the terms of Plaintiffs’ previous participation in order to exclude \n11 them from the varsity program.  Again, Warzecka did not similarly require male wrestlers to \n12 compete against football players or similarly disproportionately skilled athletes.  These disputed \n13 facts also preclude summary judgment.   \n14 d.  Disputed Facts Establish Defendant Gill-Fisher’s Liability.   \nDefendant Pam Gill-Fisher was the Senior Associate Athletic Director with significant \n15\nresponsibility in the intercollegiate athletic department.  She was deeply involved in gender equity \n16\nissues in the department and relied on by the other Defendants for her purported expertise.  (ADF \n17\n126-132.)  Like other Defendants, she was well aware of the failure of UCD to provide women with \n18\nthe same opportunity to play varsity sports as it did men.  (ADF 46, 47, 50, 57-59, 61, 127, 107, 108; \n19\nsee Evid A:48 at 11 & Appendix A to ADF for reports reflecting inequities).) These disputed facts \n20\nare sufficient to defeat summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.  Haffer, 678 F. \n21\nSupp. at 526-27. \n22\nGill-Fisher also influenced the decision to remove women from the wrestling program and \n23\nterminate the coach once he complained of sex discrimination.  (ADF 133, 134.)  Gill-Fisher’s \n24\nunusual hostility towards the women wrestlers was a factor in the steps taken by UCD that ensured \n25\nthat women no longer had the opportunity to wrestle at the varsity level.  (ADF 134.)  Significantly, \n26\nwhile Gill-Fisher contends that she had “no involvement” with wrestling try-outs in 2001, she was a \n27\nkey member of the decision making team that forced the women to wrestle off against men for a spot \n28\n28\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

After the women were \n2 removed from the roster by UCD administrators, Gill-Fisher was also integral to UCD’s response, \n3 which included the decision to refuse to allow women to be reinstated on the team on equal terms.  \n4 (ADF 136.)  For example, she had numerous meeting with Franks and Warzecka, prepared \n5 memoranda, gathered related facts, and took follow-up steps.  (ADF 137.)  She met with the OCR \n6 representatives and was one of the decision-makers who developed UCD’s resolution with the OCR.  \n7 (ADF 138.)  Finally, she went so far as to meet with local Assemblywoman Helen Thompson to \n8 present UCD’s version of events.  (ADF 139.)   \n9 Gill-Fisher admits that she thought the women should be demoted to a club level, because in \n10 her opinion that was a preferable method to develop the sport of women’s wrestling.  Her post ad-\n11 hoc justification for her actions is not credible and not relevant, especially where disputed facts \n12 establish that she refused to actually review any materials Coach Burch provided her about women’s \n13 wrestling and otherwise had no knowledge of the level of interest in women’s wrestling.  (Response \n14 to Gill-Fisher UMF 9, 10.)  Gill-Fisher’s inadmissible opinion about available competition for \n15 women wrestlers is also disputed.  (Response to Gill-Fisher UMF 9.)  Gill-Fisher’s opinions \n16 assumed the disputed contention that the Plaintiffs were not already varsity athletes.  (ADF 4.)  The \n17 fact that Gill-Fisher never advocated for the demotion of less skilled male athletes in the program to \n18 the club level or otherwise urged their exclusion from the program raises a genuine issue of as to \n19 whether she intentionally singled Plaintiffs out for mistreatment based on their gender.  \n20 Like Warzecka, Gill-Fisher’s attempts to justify the wrestle off requirement by relying on \n21 UCD’s roster management program and by suggesting that it would have been reverse \n22 discrimination to allow women in the program who were not skilled enough to beat men.  These \n23 arguments are red herrings.  Under a separate male cap, male athletes would not have been impacted \n24 whatsoever by female participation in the program.  Defendants themselves imposed a single cap \n25 because it wanted to justify the wrestle off, not because a single cap was required by any law or \n26 policy.4  UCD has never imposed roster caps on women’s opportunities because its purpose for the \n                                                 \n27\n4  Gill-Fisher’s testimony that she supposedly relied on unnamed experts in reaching her opinions \n28 (continued on next page) \n29\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Additionally, as noted above, Plaintiffs wanted \n3 to compete against women, not men.  Their ability to compete against men was irrelevant.  Again, \n4 the failure of UCD to advise OCR of this fact is but one reason (among many) to discount her \n5 purported reliance on the agreement reached with OCR in taking her actions.  (ADF 33.)  \n6 Gill-Fisher relies heavily on her history as a female athlete and other accolades to suggest \n7 that she did not intentionally discriminate against Plaintiffs.  These facts are not material, given the \n8 competent evidence that establishes Gill-Fisher’s misconduct toward Plaintiffs based on gender.  If \n9 anything, it simply explains why UCD administrators relied on Gill-Fisher to inform their \n10 understanding of gender equity and the decisions in this case.  (ADF 140.)  Her insistence that \n11 women should be required to wrestle off against men in order to continue wrestling at UCD was  a \n12 primary reason UCD’s created this new requirement.  (ADF 141.)   \n13 Finally, Gill-Fisher’s limited contact with some of the Plaintiffs is not material to the issue of \n14 her liability where these facts establish that she wanted the women removed from the varsity \n15 program and imposed the discriminatory wrestle off requirement.  Plaintiffs raise a genuine issue of \n16 material fact as to Gill-Fisher’s intentional discrimination and her motion should be denied \n17 accordingly. \n18 B.  Defendants’ Qualified Immunity Defense Does Not Pass Muster on Summary \nJudgment. \n19\nDefendants seek summary judgment on the alternative ground that they are entitled to \n20\nqualified immunity from suit.  They argue that Plaintiffs seek the vindication of rights that were not \n21\nclearly established in 2000.  They also contend that they acted reasonably in believing that their \n22\nactions were lawful.  Defendants’ arguments fall flat in the face of years of precedent affirming the \n23\nconstitutional right to be free from sex discrimination, even in athletics.  They also contradict a \n24\nplethora of undisputed and disputed facts, including Defendants’ own admissions about their \n25                                                                                                                                                                    \n(Footnote continued from previous page) \n26\nabout caps lacks foundation and is inadmissible hearsay.  (See Plaintiffs’ Objections to Defendant’s \nEvidence Submitted in Support of Reply Brief and Amended Objections to Defendant’s Evidence \n27\nSubmitted in Support of Motion For Summary Judgment, filed herewith.)  \n28\n30\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 38 of 46\n \n1 knowledge of the law (ADF 80-82, 103, 128), facts establishing ample notice to Defendants that \n2 their actions were unlawful (ADF 28-29, 45-47, 51, 54, 71, 93-94, 123-124), and facts that would \n3 allow a trier of fact to find their reliance on the OCR resolution unreasonable (ADF 24-27, 30-38, \n4 70, 96, 122, 134, 137).  Well-settled law and material issues of fact preclude summary judgment in \n5 Defendants’ favor on the qualified immunity defense. \n6 The parties agree that the test for qualified immunity is whether a plaintiff has alleged facts \n7 of a violation of a constitutional right, and whether that constitutional right was “clearly established” \n8 at the time of the violation.  Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 811 (2009).  If the official is \n9 alleged to have violated a clearly established constitutional right, the official is not entitled to \n10 qualified immunity.  Id. at 816.  The Supreme Court has clarified that lower court judges are \n11 permitted to exercise their discretion in determining which of the two prongs of the qualified \n12 immunity analysis should be addressed first in light of the circumstances of the particular case at \n13 hand.  Id. at 818, 821-22.  \n14 Regardless of the order of the inquiry, Defendants’ qualified immunity defense fails.   \n15 1.  Plaintiffs Allege Facts Of A Constitutional Right. \nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs allege facts of a constitutional right.  Defendants’ \n16\nconstruction of this case as narrowly seeking a guaranteed spot on a male wrestling team not only \n17\nmisstates the right at issue, but also is contradicted by disputed facts, as set forth above.  Correctly \n18\nviewed, Plaintiffs have three bases for their constitutional claim.  First, Plaintiffs allege that \n19\nDefendants provided them and other women fewer opportunities to participate in the athletic \n20\nprogram than they did men.  Second, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants stripped them of varsity status \n21\nbased on their gender.  Third, Defendants imposed barriers that ensured their permanent exclusion \n22\nfrom the wrestling program based on their gender.  There can be no doubt that this alleged \n23\nmisconduct violates a constitutional right, where, as noted in Section V.A.1 above, the United States \n24\nSupreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have affirmed that the Equal Protection Clause of the \n25\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution creates the right to be free from purposeful \n26\nsex discrimination by state actors.  Mississippi Univ. of Women, 458 U.S. at 731; United States v. \n27\nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 519; Bator, 39 F.3d at 1029; Oona, 143 F.3d at 474-75; Lindsey, 29 F.3d at \n28\n31\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Rights Were Clearly Established in 2000.  \n3 Defendants also fail on the inquiry regarding whether the rights at issue in this case were \n4 clearly established at the time of their alleged misconduct.  Relying inappropriately on Title IX \n5 standards, Defendants contend that no case clearly establishes a constitutional right to be a member \n6 of a team without the requisite skill and competitive ability.  Since this is not the alleged misconduct \n7 at issue, the absence of case law on this particular point is irrelevant.  Plaintiffs allege that they were \n8 kicked out and kept out of the wrestling program because they were women and that UCD was not \n9 giving women a fair share of athletic opportunities program-wide.  These allegations state a claim of \n10 sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause that was clearly established at the time \n11 of the alleged misconduct.   \n12 In 1971, the Supreme Court recognized that a law that treats women unequally violates the \n13 Equal Protection Clause.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971) (statutory preference for men as estate \n14 administrators); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975) (different parental support obligations for sons \n15 and daughters); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (different requirements for entitlement \n16 to fringe benefits for spouses of male armed services members and spouses of female armed services \n17 members).  In 1979, the Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause conferred a “federal \n18 constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination” in the workplace at the hands of \n19 government actors, including a discriminatory termination.  Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 234-35 \n20 (1979).  The Supreme Court extended this finding to the educational context long before the events \n21 at issue in this case.  Mississippi Univ. of Women, 458 U.S. at 731 (1982 case regarding denial of \n22 school admission to male applicants); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 519 (1996 case \n23 regarding denial of admission by female applicants).   \n24 Citing these cases, the Ninth Circuit repeatedly denied claims of qualified immunity by 2000 \n25 on the basis that equal protection claims of gender discrimination implicate well-established \n26 constitutional rights.  Oona, 143 F.3d at 476 (denying in 1998 a qualified immunity claim by a \n27 school official because the right to be free from gender discrimination by state actors was clearly \n28\n32\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Davis, \n3 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976)); Bator, 39 F.3d at 1027-28 (1994 decision denying qualified immunity for \n4 employer who subjected employee to discrimination on basis of sex); Lowe v. City of Monrovia, 775 \n5 F.2d 998, 1011 (9th Cir.1985) (denying qualified immunity), amended on other grounds, 784 F.2d \n6 1407 (9th Cir.1986).   \n7 Defendants suggest that they are entitled to qualified immunity unless a case has held it is \n8 unconstitutional to remove existing female members of a varsity wrestling program because they are \n9 women.  However, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that closely analogous preexisting case law is \n10 not required to show that a right was clearly established.  White v. Lee, 227 F.3d 1214, 1238 (9th Cir. \n11 2000).  “For a legal principle to be clearly established, it is not necessary that ‘the very action in \n12 question has previously been held unlawful. …’”  Rather, “[t]he dispositive inquiry is ‘whether it \n13 would be clear to a reasonable [official] that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he \n14 confronted’.”  Tennison v. City and County of San Francisco, 548 F.3d 1293, 1303, 1305 (9th Cir. \n15 2009) (citations omitted).  In LSO, LTD v. Stroh, 205 F.3d 1146, 1158 (9th Cir. 2000), the Ninth \n16 Circuit rejected a defendant’s effort to define the right allegedly violated too narrowly, stating:  \n17 “[T]he Officials’ formulation is too particularized.  To phrase the ‘right allegedly violated’ in such \n18 detail and in terms so closely paralleling what allegedly happened here would be to allow [the \n19 Officials], and future defendants, to define away all potential claims.”  Id. at 1148 (citing Kelley v. \n20 Borg, 60 F.3d 664, 667 (9th Cir.1995)). \n21 The reach of the Equal Protection Clause to challenge gender discrimination is athletics was \n22 well-settled in 2000.  Haffer, 678 F.Supp. at 526-27 (1987 decision confirming application of the \n23 equal protection clause where denial of equal athletic opportunities and citing numerous cases \n24 decided since 1973 that have held that regulations that prohibit girls from participating in particular \n25 sports deny girls equal protection).  The Ninth Circuit embraced the important governmental interest \n26 in equality in athletic opportunities and in redressing past discrimination before 2000.  Clark, 695 \n27 F.2d at 1131 (1982 decision); Neal, 198 F.3d at 769-72 (1999 decision).       \n28\n33\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 41 of 46\n \n1 A long line of cases decided well before 2000 also affirmed that an institution’s elimination \n2 of a women’s sports team and its refusal to provide equal athletic opportunities program-wide is a \n3 form of sex discrimination in violation of Title IX.  See, e.g., Roberts, 998 F.2d at 828 (1993 case \n4 held:  “It is well-established that ‘an institution may violate Title IX simply by failing to \n5 accommodate effectively the interests and abilities of student athletes of both sexes”); Cohen, 991 \n6 F.2d at 897-98 (1993 decision); Favia v. Ind. Univ. of Pa., 812 F. Supp. 578, 584-85 (W.D. Pa. \n7 1993), aff’d, 7 F.3d 332 (3d Cir. 1993).  The Ninth Circuit has held that the development of \n8 jurisprudence under other laws prohibiting the same conduct is relevant to its analysis of whether a \n9 constitutional right was “clearly established.”  In Bator, 39 F.3d at 1028, the Ninth Circuit affirmed \n10 that the development of jurisprudence under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act clearly \n11 established a constitutional prohibition against gender discrimination, stating:     \n12\nTitle VII cases are relevant to the discussion of when the constitutional right \nto be free of sexual harassment became clearly established because Title VII \n13\nand equal protection cases address the same wrong: discrimination. Title VII \n14 case law establishes that sexual harassment is prohibited sex discrimination, \nand it reflects our collective understanding of what conduct violates a person's \n15 rights.   \n16 This authority is sufficient to establish that UCD’s actions violated a constitutional right that \n17 was clearly established in 2000.  Indeed, Defendants admitted that they knew that sex discrimination \n18 in athletics was prohibited by law.  (ADF 65, 80-82, 103, 128.)  Some expressly admitted that they \n19 knew that the Constitution also prohibited sex discrimination.  (Id.)  Most admitted that they were \n20 well-trained in laws requiring gender equity.  (Id.)  They admitted that they were aware that UCD \n21 was not providing men and women the same number of athletic opportunities.  (ADF 51-53.)  \n22 Defendants’ misconduct continued for years.  A jury could find that it was unreasonable for \n23 Defendants to ignore, not only the public outcry about their actions, but also the advice of gender \n24 equity expert Donna Lopiano, who strongly suggested that they convene a “blue ribbon panel” of \n25 gender equity experts to evaluate the lawfulness of their conduct. \n26 Defendants argue that that they reasonably relied on OCR’s Voluntary Resolution Plan to \n27 assume that their actions were lawful.  However, as noted above, OCR did not consider or resolve \n28\n34\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 42 of 46\n \n1 the constitutional questions presented here, which are governed by different legal standards as set \n2 forth above.  Moreover, Plaintiffs raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the \n3 OCR process to resolve any claims.   Moreover, the evidence suggests that Defendants never advised \n4 the OCR that the women previously competed against women in the program, not men.  (ADF 24, \n5 31, 33)  These facts certainly prevent Defendants from relying on this process to establish qualified \n6 immunity on the constitutional claim on summary judgment.   \n7 Defendants rely on Vasquez v. De La Rosa, 414 F. Supp. 2d 124, 133 (D.P.R. 2006) for the \n8 premise that reliance on the OCR settlement agreement was reasonable.  However, Vasquez is \n9 readily distinguishable.  In Vasquez, plaintiffs alleged that they were terminated based on their \n10 political affiliation in violation of due process.  Id. at 127.  The court found sufficient evidence that \n11 plaintiffs’ constitutional rights were violated, but held that defendants’ decision to terminate \n12 plaintiffs’ employment was not unreasonable because defendants initiated the terminations due to \n13 concerns that plaintiffs’ appointments violated existing law.  Id. at 132-33.  Conflicting mandates of \n14 the law, combined with the fact that the defendants conducted a thorough internal investigation, and \n15 the fact that the Secretary of Justice, a human resources expert, and an external legal advisor all \n16 recommended the same course of action distinguish Vasquez from this case.  Defendants failed to \n17 conduct an independent investigation into the female wrestlers’ allegations and failed to assess these \n18 complaints, despite their knowledge that they were providing women fewer athletic opportunities \n19 overall.  The Vasquez defendants were concerned that the plaintiffs’ job appointments violated state \n20 law, which the court found to be a valid justification for the terminations.  Id. at 127.  Here, \n21 defendants have offered no such justification.   \n22 Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to establish not only a constitutional violation, but also a right \n23 that was clearly established in 2000.  Accordingly, the Court should reject Defendants’ qualified \n24 immunity defense.   \n25\nC.  The Court Should Also Deny Summary Judgment Because It Has Already \nConsidered and Rejected Defendants’ Timeliness Challenge to Plaintiffs Equal \n26\nProtection Claim.   \n27\nDefendants boldly ignore multiple orders of this Court as well as the Ninth Circuit in seeking \n28\n35\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 482    Filed 11/09/10   Page 43 of 46\n \n1 dismissal of the equal protection claim on statute of limitations grounds yet again.  This Court has \n2 previously considered and rejected Defendants’ statute of limitations defense when it ruled on their \n3 first motion to dismiss.  Significantly, the Ninth Circuit also considered and rejected this same \n4 argument.  Mansourian, supra, 602 F.3d 957.   \n5 Specifically, the Ninth Circuit found that Plaintiffs in this case had adequately pled that \n6 Defendants had alleged an “ongoing violation” that constitute a “systemic violation,” rather than a \n7 one-time act.  Id. at 974.  Remarkably, Defendants acknowledge that the Ninth Circuit found that \n8 Plaintiffs alleged a systemic policy of discrimination denying them opportunity each day they \n9 attended the university.  (Warzecka MPA (Dkt. #452-3) at 7.)  Yet despite the ruling of the Ninth \n10 Circuit, with this argument regarding timeliness, Defendants (incorrectly) seek to convince this \n11 Court that Defendants’ acts were not systemic by presenting the same unmeritorious argument. \n12 Similarly, in ruling on the motion to dismiss, this court previously held:  \n13\nPlaintiffs  Mansourian  [and  Mancuso  allege  that  they]  are  current  UCD \nstudents  who  are  currently  being  subjected  to  Defendants’  allegedly  sex \n14\ndiscriminatory practices. (Compl. [Dkt. #1] at ¶¶ 9-11, 22, 85-86, 88, 89.)  As \n15 UCD students, their claims accrue each and every day they are denied equal \naccess to athletic participation and scholarship opportunities.  At the time \n16 Plaintiffs filed the instant complaint, Plaintiffs allege they should have been \nwrestling for UCD and receiving all the varsity benefits and scholarships \n17\nprovided to male wrestlers but Defendants refused, and continue to refuse, to \ndate, to allow their participation.  (Id. at ¶¶ 9-12, 32, 42, 66, 88-89.)  \n18\n(Dkt. 25.)  This Court then concluded that Plaintiffs’ allegations thus “sufficiently state facts within \n19\nthe applicable statute of limitations (one or two years) to sustain claims under Section 1983.  (Id.)   \n20\nTo side-step this Court’s previous order on the motion to dismiss, Defendants point the Court \n21\nto its order on their motion for judgment on the pleadings.  That order, however, did not address the \n22\nstatute of limitations on Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim at all.  The Court declined Defendants’ \n23\nrequest to revisit this ruling on their motion for judgment on the pleadings.  (Dkt. #376.)   \n24\n1.  The Fact that Plaintiff’s (Non-existent) Unequal Treatment Claim may \n25\nhave been Time-barred is Irrelevant to the Timeliness of Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection Claim.   \n26\nDefendants now try to take a fourth bite at the apple, contending that Plaintiffs’ equal \n27\nprotection claim against the Defendants is time-barred because this Court determined that Plaintiffs’ \n28\n36\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

Significantly, \n2 Plaintiffs never alleged a Title IX equal treatment claim.5  Moreover, whatever conclusion this Court \n3 reached with respect to Plaintiffs’ (non-existent) equal treatment claim under Title IX, it has held \n4 that Plaintiffs’ Title IX ineffective accommodation claim is timely.  (Dkt. # 25.)  The allegations in \n5 the complaint that support Plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claim are the same ones that \n6 support Plaintiffs’ equal protection claim, which are the same allegations upon which the district \n7 court relied in rejecting Defendants’ statute of limitations defense the first time, i.e., that Plaintiffs \n8 were being denied equal access to athletics each and every day they were students at UCD.  \n9 (Dkt. # 1.)  Defendants’ failure to seek reconsideration of this finding is fatal to its request that the \n10 Court do so now.  \n11 2.  Disputed and Undisputed Facts Establish that Each Individual \nDefendants Created, Participated in, and Maintained the Ongoing Policy \n12 of Discrimination Against the Plaintiffs.   \n13 Defendants argument that, notwithstanding this Court’s and the Ninth Circuit’s ruling that \n14 UCD’s discriminatory acts against the Plaintiffs were ongoing, the acts of the individual Defendants \n15 are one-time, is nonsensical.  As the facts in this case illustrate, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \n16 were the policy-makers for UCD who implemented and then continued to enact decisions that denied \n17 Plaintiffs the ongoing opportunity to wrestle.  (See, e.g., ADF 18, 65, 76-79, 101-102, 126, 133.)  \n18 See also Heyne v. Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools, 686 F. Supp. 2d 724, 733 (2009) (holding \n19 that individual employees who enforced school district’s policy that allegedly violated equal \n20 protection could be held liable).  Thus, the contention that these acts were systemic and ongoing by \n21 UCD, yet one-time acts that could be time-barred for the individual Defendants, is entirely \n22 inconsistent.     \n23 Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants’ acts in this regard created a discriminatory policy of \n24 failing to provide equal athletic participation opportunities to women in violation of the Equal \n                                                 \n25\n5  As Plaintiffs have indicated, they did not plead a Title IX unequal treatment case.  Unequal \n26 treatment claims look to whether students who already play varsity athletics are treated equally in \nseveral specific categories delineated in the regulations, e.g., equipment, scheduling, traveling, and \n27 medical and training services.

Plaintiffs were still students, and thus were continuing to be denied \n2 equal opportunities, at the time the complaint was filed.  It is axiomatic that a plaintiff who is being \n3 harmed by a facially discriminatory policy at the time she has filed a lawsuit challenging that policy \n4 has pled a timely claim.  See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Local 350, Plumbers & Pipefitters, 998 F.2d 641, 645 \n5 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that facially discriminatory policy may be challenged at any time); Reed v. \n6 Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 613 F.2d 757, 760-61 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that plaintiff stated timely \n7 claim by alleging policy of discrimination under Title VII that pervaded employer’s personnel \n8 decision).  \n9 Defendants only cite inapposite case law.  For example, their reliance on Cherosky v. \n10 Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2003), is misplaced.  Cherosky involved the specific denial of a \n11 request for accommodation that the parties agreed occurred outside of the limitations period.  Id. at \n12 1247.  Moreover, the reasoning of National  Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 \n13 (2002) with respect to “discrete acts” such as a denial of a promotion, does not extend to situations \n14 where, as here, individuals are being subjected to an ongoing policy of discrimination.  \n15 Because Plaintiffs had a right each and every day of their enrollment to equal access to \n16 educational benefits, their equal protection claim continued to accrue until they left UCD.  As each \n17 Defendants’ acts created the policy and continued to deny Plaintiffs the equal opportunity to \n18 participate in athletics, the individual Defendants’ acts are not time-barred.   \n19 /// \n20 /// \n21 /// \n22 /// \n23 /// \n24 /// \n25 /// \n26 /// \n27 /// \n28\n38\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

CONCLUSION \n2 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the motions for summary judgment \n3 by Defendants’ Vanderhoef, Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher seeking judgment as a matter of law \n4 on Plaintiffs’ claim that they violated their constitutional rights.  Plaintiffs also request that the Court \n5 decline to afford any Defendants qualified immunity from suit on these motions. \n6\nDATED:  November 9, 2010       Respectfully submitted, \n \n7\nTHE STURDEVANT LAW FIRM \n8 A Professional Corporation \n \n9 EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES \n \n10\nDUCKWORTH PETERS LEBOWITZ \nOLIVIER LLP \n11\n \n12 EQUITY LEGAL \n \n13                By:  /s/ Noreen Farrell         \n              Noreen Farrell \n14\n              Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n39\n \nPLTFS’ CONSOLIDATED OPPOSITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS’ MTNS FOR SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT; CASE NO.

For the reasons set forth below,1 plaintiffs’\n2 motion to deny defendants’ bill of costs is GRANTED.\n3 BACKGROUND\n4 This case arises out of the lack of opportunities for female\n5 students to participate in varsity wrestling at the University of\n6 California, Davis (“UCD”) and, more generally, the effective\n7 accommodation of athletic opportunities for women at UCD.\n8 Plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian (“Mansourian”), Lauren Mancuso\n9 (“Mancuso”), and Christine Wing-Si Ng (“Ng”) (collectively\n10 “plaintiffs”)2 are former female wrestlers at UCD.  Plaintiffs\n11 filed this action on behalf of themselves and a putative class on\n12 December 18, 2003.  Plaintiffs named as defendants in their\n13 individual and official capacities the following parties: the\n14 Regents of the University of California; the Chancellor of the\n15 University, Larry Vanderhoef; the Athletic Director at the\n16 University, Greg Warzecka; Associate Athletic Directors of the\n17 University, Pam Gill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson; and former\n18 Associate Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs, Robert Franks.\n19 On December 18, 2003, plaintiffs filed a complaint on behalf\n20 of themselves and a putative class, asserting six claims for\n21 relief: (1) violation of Title IX based on unequal opportunities;\n22 (2) violation of Title IX based on unequal financial assistance;\n23 (3) retaliation in violation of Title IX; (4) violation of 42\n24\n25 1 Because oral argument will not be of material\nassistance, the court orders these matters submitted on the\n26 briefs.  E.D. Cal. L.R. 78-230(h).\n27 2 Plaintiff Nancy Nien-Li Chiang (“Chiang”) voluntarily\ndismissed all claims in this action on June 12, 2007.  (Mem. &\n28 Order (Docket #195), filed July 12, 2007).\n2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 3 of 8\n1 U.S.C. § 1983; (5) violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights\n2 Act; and (6) violation of public policy.  Defendant filed a\n3 motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n4 12(b)(6) on March 5, 2004.  (Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (Docket #13-\n5 15), filed Mar. 5, 2004.)  The court denied the motion on May 6,\n6 2004.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #25), filed May 6, 2004.)\n7 On February 2, 2007,3 plaintiffs’ filed a motion to amend\n8 the complaint to add new plaintiffs and allegations.  (Pls.’ Mot.\n9 to Amend (Docket #158), filed Feb. 2, 2007.)  The court denied\n10 the motion on March 20, 2007.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #175), filed\n11 Mar. 20, 2007.)  The parties thereafter stipulated to dismiss the\n12 class claims.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #195), filed June 12, 2007.)\n13 On June 5, 2007, defendants filed a motion for judgment on\n14 the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). \n15 (Defs.’ Mot. for J. on Pleadings (Docket #188), filed June 5,\n16 2007.)  The court granted the motion for all claims, except\n17 plaintiffs’ claim for ineffective accommodation.  (Mem. & Order\n18 (Docket #226), filed Oct. 18, 2007.)  Defendants filed a motion\n19 for summary judgment on the sole remaining claim on January 11,\n20 2008.  (Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. (Docket #280), filed Jan. 11,\n21 2008.)  On April 23, 2008, the court granted defendants’ motion\n22 on the grounds that plaintiffs had failed to give adequate notice\n23 of their more general claim of ineffective accommodation and\n24\n3 Unfortunately, both defendants’ and plaintiffs’ counsel\n25 suffered illnesses throughout the course of the litigation.  As a\nresult, both parties stipulated to extend deadlines and to stay\n26 proceedings.  In August 2006, plaintiffs obtained new counsel. \n(Notice of Appearance (Docket #134), filed Aug. 18, 2006.)  The\n27 parties submitted a joint status report on January 19, 2007, and\nactive litigation resumed.  (Joint Status Report (Docket #154),\n28 filed Jan. 19, 2007.)\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 4 of 8\n1 entered judgment.  (Mem. & Order (Docket #368), filed Apr. 23,\n2 2008; Judgment (Docket #369), filed Apr. 23, 2008.)  \n3 Defendants submitted a bill of costs, requesting an award of\n4 $32,353.84.4  Plaintiffs object to defendants’ bill of costs.\n5 ANALYSIS\n6 Pursuant to Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil\n7 Procedure, a prevailing party should be awarded costs, unless “a\n8 court order provides otherwise.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 (2008).  As\n9 such, “the rule creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs\n10 to a prevailing party.”  Ass’n of Mexican-American Educators\n11 (“AMAE”) v. State of California, 231 F.3d 572, 592 (9th Cir.\n12 2000) (en banc) (citing Nat’l Info. Servs., v. TRW, Inc., 51 F.3d\n13 1470, 1471 (9th Cir. 1995)); Champion Produce, Inc. v. Ruby\n14 Robinson Co., Inc., 342 F.3d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 2003) (“[C]osts\n15 are to be awarded as a matter of course in the ordinary case.”). \n16 The losing party bears the burden of making a showing that the\n17 award of costs would be inequitable under the circumstances. \n18 Nat’l Info. Servs., 51 F.3d at 1472.  While a district court has\n19 discretion to deny costs, it must “specify reasons,” explaining\n20 “why a case is not ‘ordinary’ and why, in the circumstances, it\n21 would be inappropriate or inequitable to award costs.”  Champion\n22 Produce, 342 F.3d at 1022.\n23 The district may consider nonpunitive reasons for denying\n24 costs to a prevailing party.  AMAE, 231 F.3d at 592. \n25\n4 This amount reflects the requested costs after\n26 defendants reduced the initially requested amount by $4,314.49\ndue to the erroneous inclusion of costs associated with plaintiff\n27 Chiang’s claims as well as other items.  (Defs.’ Response to\nPls.’ Preliminary Objections (Docket #390), filed July 3, 2008,\n28 at 20.)\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 5 of 8\n1 Specifically, while costs may be denied to punish a prevailing\n2 party’s misconduct, the Ninth Circuit has also approved as\n3 appropriate reasons for denying costs: (1) the losing party’s\n4 limited financial resources and the degree of economic disparity\n5 between the parties; (2) “the chilling effect of imposing such\n6 high costs on future civil rights litigants”; (3) the losing\n7 party’s litigation in good faith; and (4) the closeness and\n8 difficulty of the issues raised in the case.  Id. at 592-93.\n9 While there is no evidence that defendants engaged in any\n10 misconduct in the course of litigation, a combination of several\n11 other factors weighs against the award of costs to defendants in\n12 this case.  First, although plaintiffs have not presented\n13 evidence of actual indigence, they have sufficiently demonstrated\n14 that they are graduate students and recent college graduates with\n15 limited financial resources.5  Plaintiff Mansourian recently\n16 graduated from graduate school and has accrued a substantial\n17 amount of debt as a result of both student loans and other debts. \n18 Her current salary barely covers her monthly expenses, and the\n19 anticipated increase in interest rates will also increase her\n20 monthly expenses.  Plaintiff Ng is a graduate student.  Her\n21 current income is insufficient to meet her monthly expenses. \n22 Similarly, plaintiff Mancuso is a recent college graduate whose\n23 current income does not cover her monthly expenses.  She will\n24 also begin graduate school in the fall.  Moreover, in contrast, \n25 /////\n26\n27 5 The court has reviewed the evidence filed by plaintiffs\nunder seal.  The court discusses the evidence in general terms in\n28 order to protect the privacy of plaintiffs.\n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 6 of 8\n1 UCD has a substantial budget.  As such, there is a significant\n2 economic disparity between plaintiffs and defendants.6 \n3 Second, the imposition of the cost bill on plaintiffs would\n4 lead to a harsh result that could chill student litigants from\n5 vindicating important civil rights under Title IX.  See Stanley\n6 v. Univ. of Southern California, 178 F.3d 1069, 1080 (9th Cir.\n7 1999).  This litigation raised important issues regarding\n8 discrimination against individual female athletes and the\n9 effective accommodation of varsity athletic opportunities for\n10 women generally.  Title IX litigation will frequently be brought\n11 by students, who, as defendants concede, must often finance\n12 education with a significant amount of student loans.  Risking\n13 the imposition of thousands of dollars in costs in addition to\n14 these loans in order to vindicate rights they are guaranteed as\n15 students would likely deter potential litigants from “test[ing]\n16 the boundaries of our laws” and making progress in the realm of\n17 Title IX civil rights.  See id.  Moreover, there was great public\n18 concern for the conduct that was the impetus of this litigation. \n19 Thus, while this litigation may not affect the entire state of\n20 California or the public education system as a whole, plaintiffs\n21 sought to vindicate important public interests that had garnered\n22\n6 Defendants argue that the court should disregard cases\n23\nconsidering the disparity between the parties because UCD is not\na private corporation, but a public entity paid with money\n24\nbelonging to the citizens of California.  However, in AMAE, the\nNinth Circuit upheld the district court’s reasons for denying\n25 recovery, which included the economic disparity between the\nplaintiffs and the State of California.  231 F.3d at 593; see\n26 also Washburn v. Fagan, No. 03-0869, 2008 WL 361048 (Feb. 11,\n2008) (denying costs to the defendants because, inter alia,\n27 “there exists a significant economic disparity between\n[p]laintiff and the City and County of San Francisco”).  As such,\n28 defendants’ argument is without merit.\n6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 7 of 8\n1 the attention of UCD students, the community, and the media.  See\n2 Washburn, 2008 WL 361048 at *2 (holding that the great public\n3 concern over defendants conduct helped demonstrate that, while\n4 the issues were not of the magnitude of the civil rights relief\n5 in AMAE, plaintiffs sought to vindicate important civil rights by\n6 bringing suit).\n7 Finally, plaintiffs pursued this litigation in good faith\n8 and presented issues that were both difficult and close.  From\n9 the outset of this litigation, the court has been presented with\n10 legal issues of first impression in the Ninth Circuit, including\n11 issues over which other Circuits are split.  Both plaintiffs and\n12 defendants argued meritful positions.  In the end, the court\n13 found defendants’ positions to be persuasive on dispositive\n14 issues.  However, at no time during this litigation, did\n15 plaintiffs press frivolous claims or arguments.7 \n16 Considering the totality of the circumstances, plaintiffs\n17 have overcome the presumption in favor of costs by sufficiently\n18 demonstrating that this is an extraordinary circumstance in which\n19 an award of costs would be inequitable.  Therefore, the court, in\n20 its discretion, declines to award costs in this matter.\n21 /////\n22 /////\n23 /////\n24 /////       \n25\n26 7 Moreover, because the court found that plaintiffs’\nclaims failed with respect to primarily legal issues, such as the\n27 statute of limitations, preemption, and the requirement of notice\nand the opportunity to cure, it never reached the gravamen of the\n28 factual basis for plaintiffs’ claims. \n7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 400    Filed 07/15/08   Page 8 of 8\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motion to deny\n3 defendants’ bill of costs is GRANTED. \n4 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n5 DATED: July 15, 2008\n6\n7                                    \nFRANK C.

(2) violation of Title IX based on a theory that female athletes are not provided with the same \n14  opportunities for financial assistance as male athletes (asserted against the UNIVERSITY only); (3) \n15  retaliation in violation of Title IX and its interpretive regulations (asserted against the UNIVERSITY \n16  only);  (4) violation of 42  U.S.C.  §1983  based on an equal protection clause (asserted against the \n17  UNIVERSITY for injunctive relief and against the individual Defendants for damages); (5) violation \n18  of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (asserted against all Defendants); and (6) a claim of violation \n19  of \"public policy\" based on various California statutes including Article I,  section 7 of the State \n20  Constitution, Article I, section 31 of the State Constitution, and Education Code sections 221.7, 262.3, \n21  66101,67620 and 66252  (asserted against all Defendants). \n22  Pursuant to Federal Rule 12(c), Defendants move to dismiss all claims as stated below. \n23  II \n24  FACTUAL SUMMARY \n25  The gist of Plaintiffs' Complaint is that the UNIVERSITY effectively ended all opportunities \n26  for female students to participate in intercollegiate varsity wrestling when they were initially cut from \n27 \n28 \n1  Plaintiff CHIANG recently voluntarily dismissed all claims. \n1 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 10 of 29\n1  the team in the Fall of2000 (Ex. A, Complaint, ~60) and then later in the Fall of2001, when they were \n2  required  to  compete  for  a  sport  on  the  team  by  engaging  in  tryouts  under the  same  terms  and \n3  conditions as male athletes (Id. at ~~ 77-78). \n4  The alleged events forming the basis of the claims began in Fall of 2000.  Plaintiffs allege they \n5  participated in the wrestling program at U.C. Davis. (Id. at ~~ 30, 40, 48, 57.)  They contend that in the \n6  Fall of 2000, Michael Burch, then the head coach of the wrestling team, told them \"that Defendants \n7  had terminated all wrestling athletic participation opportunities for female students, but not for male \n8  students.\"  (Id. at ~~ 59-60.)  Plaintiffs refer to this alleged act as the \"No Female Directive.\"  (Id. at ~ \n9  60)  They  further  allege  that  as  a result  of the  purported  \"Directive,\"  they  lost  various  benefits \n10  including  insurance,  laundry,  medical  services,  wrestling  practice,  early  registration,  and  the \n11  opportunity to receive academic credit for wrestling.  (Id. at ~ 61.) Plaintiffs met with WARZECKA, \n12  who  suggested they form  a club  for  women wrestlers.  (Id.  at ~ 63.)  In  April  2001,  the women \n13  wrestlers filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, \n14  which is the entity charged with investigating complaints of alleged violations of Title IX. (Id. at ~ 67; \n15  Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. E,jiled concurrently with this Motion.) Plaintiffs contend \n16  that in June 2001, the UNIVERSITY agreed to reinstate them to the team. (Id. at ~~ 74-75.) In the Fall \n17  of 2001, they attended wrestling practice and were informed they would be required to compete for a \n18  spot on the team on the same terms and conditions as male athletes.  (Id. at ~~ 75-78.) \n19  The Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\") received several complaints from the women wrestlers. \n20  (See Request for  Judicial Notice, Ex.'s E,  G.)  The initial complaint was filed on April 25,  2001. \n21  Plaintiffs alleged they were discriminated against on the basis of sex because they were cut from the \n22  team.  (Exhibit  A,  Complaint,  ~60-67; Request  for  Judicial  Notice,  Exhibit  E.)  In  response,  the \n23  UNIVERSITY advised the OCR on May 14, 2001 that the Director of Athletics had communicated \n24  with the coach of the wrestling team, telling him to add the four women students to the team roster \n25  immediately, and that the four students had been advised of this. (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit \n26  F.)  In its letter issued to the Chancellor on May 31, 2001, the OCR stated \"the OCR has learned that \n27  the  allegations have been resolved by the  action taken by the  University to  re-instate the women \n28  wrestlers to the wrestling team. OCR has therefore determined that there are no current allegations \n2 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 11 of 29\n1  appropriate for resolution by OCR. OCR is closing the complaint as of the date of this letter.\" (Request \n2  for Judicial Notice, Exhibit G.)  A second complaint was filed on May 14,2001 by NG. NG alleged \n3  claims of disparate treatment on the basis of gender in regard to the wrestling team.  (Request for \n4  Judicial  Notice,  Exhibit H.)  After  completing  an  investigation that  included  a  campus  visit  and \n5  interviews, the  OCR issued its report on this  and the remaining complaints on October  16,  2001. \n6  (Request for  Judicial Notice, Exhibit 1.) The OCR indicated it was closing the complaint due to  a \n7  Voluntary Resolution Plan submitted by the UNIVERSITY in  which the  UNIVERSITY agreed to \n8  allow the women to participate on the team on the same terms and conditions as the male athletes. \n9  The OCR noted that: \"[i]nasmuch as the University has chosen to provide an intercollegiate athletic \n10  wrestling team that is open to both men and women, it has undertaken to provide equivalent benefits, \n11  services and opportunities, as required.\" (Id. at p. 3) \n12 \nIII \nl3 \nTHE ALLEGED \"SECOND ELIMINATION\" OF WOMEN'S \n14 \nWRESTLING WAS, AS A MATTER OF LAW, A LAWFUL ACT \n15 \nPlaintiffs contend the UNIVERSITY discriminated against them by requiring that \"they could \n16 \nonly participate in wrestling as part of the men's team and only if they could beat male wrestlers using \n17 \nmen's collegiate style wrestling rules rather than women's freestyle rules.\"  (Exhibit A, Complaint, pp. \n18 \n21 :11-15, 42:3-7.)  They  refer to  this  act  as  the \"second elimination of female  wrestling athletic \n19  participation  opportunities.\"  (Id.  at  21 :24-22:2.)  Plaintiffs  cannot  seek redress  for  this  alleged \n20  \"second elimination\" because, as a matter oflaw, Defendants' policy of equal treatment was lawful. \n21  While case law in this area is sparse, it is unanimous in concluding (directly or in dicta) that \n22  educational institutions need only allow women athletes to try out for a team -- not guarantee them a \n23  place on  the roster.  Fortin v.

Nebraska School Activities Association, 341  F .Supp. \n9  258,262 (D.Neb. 1972) (holding the plaintiffs right was not \"the right to play golf.  Her right is to be \n10  treated the same as boys unless there is a rational basis for being treated differently\"). An allegation \n11  that the UNIVERSITY only allowed the female wrestlers to wrestle \"if they could beat male wrestlers \n12  using men's collegiate style wrestling rules\" is simply an allegation of equal 'treatment not intentional \n13  discrimination.  Plaintiffs'  contentions that  they  never  had  to  tryout in  prior  years  do  not  make \n14  Defendants' later actions any less lawful: \"Impediments to preferential treatment do not deny equal \n15  protection.\" Coalition for Economic Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 708 (9th Cir. 1997). \n16  Plaintiffs' contention that the \"second elimination\" is discriminatory is further undermined by \n17  the fact that the OCR approved of the UNIVERSITY's policy.  After conducting an investigation, the \n18  OCR informed the UNIVERSITY that it was closing the female wrestlers' complaint contingent on \n19  the UNIVERSITY implementing the  approved  Voluntary Resolution Plan (\"VRP\").  (Request for \n20  Judicial Notice, Exhibit I.) The VRP contained a provision stating that: \n21  All men and women athletes are encouraged to compete for a position on the Wrestling \nTeam.  The coach of the Wrestling Team (\"Coach\") will select those athletes eligible for \n22 \nthe Wrestling Team's final squad list who demonstrate the highest skill and competitive \nability in their weight class.  (Id.) \n23 \n24  The VRP unambiguously states that the UNIVERSITY is only required to select athletes with \n25  the highest skill level -- the very allegation the Plaintiffs contend is a discriminatory policy.  Thus, the \n26  \"second  elimination\"  allegation  is  nothing  more  than  a contention that  the  UNIVERSITY  acted \n27  unlawfully by implementing a policy of equal treatment of male and female students who want to \n28  wrestle.  However, \"the efforts [the UNIVERSITY]  made in fulfilling  its commitments under the \n4 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957,DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 13 of 29\n1  compliance agreement with OCR, preclude a finding that [it] has been deliberately indifferent to its \n2  overall compliance obligations under Title IX.\" Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568, 576 (8th \n3  Cir 2001). \n4  \"Title IX does not establish a right to participate in any particular sport at the college of one's \n5  choice.\"  Harper v. Board of Regents, 35 F.Supp.2d 1118, 1123 (C.D. Ill.  1999). Nor does Title IX \n6  require \"any education institution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to the members of one \n7  sex on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of \n8  persons of that sex participating in or receiving the benefits of any federally supported program or \n9  activity .... \"  20 U.S.C. § 1681(b); Neal v.  Board of Trustees,  198 F.3d 763, 771  (9th Cir.  1999). \n10  Further, the statutes pertain to  sex discrimination do not require \"reasonable accommodations\" for \n11  persons who lack the appropriate qualifications. Bronk v. Ineichen, 54 F.3d 425, 429, fn 5 (7th Cir. \n12  1995)  (\"it is  not  accommodation  but equal  treatment that is  mandated\").  Plaintiffs  never  had  an \n13  absolute right to participate on the U.C. Davis wrestling team.  They only had a right to compete for a \n14  spot on the roster on the same terms and conditions as  male  students -- something the complaint \n15  expressly concedes occurred. The alleged \"second elimination,\" as a matter of law, does not allege any \n16  action  \"showing  that  [Plaintiffs]  are  entitled  to  relief.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  Pro  8(a).  Accordingly, \n17  Defendants request that the Court dismiss all claims based on the \"second elimination\" (i. e.  the Fall \n18  2001 tryouts).2 \n19  IV \n20  SINCE NO CONTINUING VIOLATION EXISTS, \nALL FEDERAL LAW BASED CLAIMS ARE UNTIMELY \n21 \nAs the Ninth Circuit has observed, \"a plaintiff may plead herself out of court.\"  Weisbuch v. \n22 \nCounty of Los Angeles, 119 F.3d 778, 783 (9th Cir. 1997). Plaintiffs previously escaped dismissal via \n23 \na  Rule  12(b)(6)  motion  on  the  statue  of limitations  by  relying  on  conclusory  allegations  of a \n24 \n25 \n2  Previously, the standard in a judgment on the pleading was that \"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state \n26  a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would \nentitle him to relief.\"  The Supreme Court recently held that \"after puzzling the profession for 50 years, this famous \n27  observation has earned its retirement.\"  Bell At!. Corn. v. Twombly. 2007 U.S. LEXIS 5901, *35 (2007).  Thus, \"a wholly \nconclusory statement of claim\" coupled with the metaphysical possibility that the claim could survive on some undisclosed \n28  set of facts no longer suffices. (ld. at 33.) As to the Fall 2001 try-outs, Plaintiffs have only disclosed that they were treated \nthe same as the male athletes.  The conclusory characterization of the \"second elimination\" as discriminatory is of no \nconsequence. \n5 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{OOS009S7.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 14 of 29\n1  \"continuing violation.\"  A  further  examination of the  complaint in light of the above  discussion \n2  warrants a different conclusion.  Once an entity discontinues an allegedly discriminatory policy, the \n3  clock starts running, even under the \"pattern and practice\" discrimination theory.  Gifford v. Atchison, \n4  T. & S. F. R. Co., 685 F.2d 1149, 1153-54 (9th Cir. 1982). \n5  The applicable statute of limitations for all federal law based claims asserted is one year.  See \n6  Stanley v. Trs. of the Cal. State Univ., 433 FJd 1129, 1136 (9th Cir. 2006) (Title IX); Silva v. Crain, \n7  169 FJd 608,  610 (9th Cir.  1999) (42  U.S.C.  §  1983); also see  Gatto v.  County of Sonoma,  98 \n8  Cal.App.4th 744, 760 (2002) (Unruh Act).  Plaintiffs seek damages in all three Title IX claims for \n9  relief based on what they call the \"No female directive\" issued in the Fall of 2000 (Ex. A, Complaint, \n10  ~~ 135,  146,  160),  an alleged  broken promise  in June 2001  regarding  reinstatement of wrestling \n11  opportunities for women (Id. at ~~ 74-75), the failure to renew the contract of their coach (Id.  at ~ \n12  157),  and  being required  to  compete for  a spot on the  wrestling team  under the  same terms and \n13  conditions as male students in the Fall of 2001. (Id. at ~~ 75-78,155-156.)  All actions which form the \n14  basis of Plaintiffs' claims for damages in their complaint were completed by Fall 2001.  The complaint \n15  was not filed until December 18, 2003. \n16  The conclusory allegations about \"continuing violations\" cannot salvage the untimely claims as \n17  the complaint admits that the UNIVERSITY implemented a policy that was non-discriminatory in Fall \n18  2001.  The new policy effectively ended any purported continuing violation towards women wrestlers. \n19  All  prior  claims  based  on  \"discrete  acts\"  are  untimely.  Since  the  complaint  admits  that  the \n20  UNIVERSITY implemented a non-discriminatory policy, the continuing violations doctrine does not \n21  apply. \n22  With respect to the retaliation claim, the alleged \"directive\" took place in Fall 2000, before the \n23  protected activity of filing an OCR complaint took place in the Spring of2001. (Exhibit A, Complaint, \n24  ~~ 59-60,  153.)  The  only  change  that  took  place  after  the  OCR  complaints  were  filed  was  a \n25  confirmation that all students who tryout for the wrestling team will be treated equally.  (Id. at ~~ 155-\n26  156.)  The failure to change an existing policy after a plaintiff complains does not morph a systemic \n27  discrimination claim into a systemic retaliation claim.  Lever v. Northwestern Univ., 979 F.2d 552, \n28  556 (7th Cir.  1992).  More importantly, there are no allegations (conclusory or factually supported) \n6 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 15 of 29\n1  that the University had a systemic policy of retaliating against female athletes who complain about sex \n2  discrimination.  EEOC v. Custom Cos., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5950 *34-37 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (without \n3  proof of systemic retaliation Morgan bars untimely claims); Allen v. Chicago Transit Auth., 2000 U.S. \n4  Dist. LEXIS 11499 * 17-18 (E.D. Ill. 2000) (noting that \"there are no allegations that the CT A engaged \n5  in a pattern or practice of retaliation.  The only allegations of retaliation are  the  incidents against \n6  individual plaintiffs\"). Plaintiffs cannot bootstrap later allegedly retaliatory \"individualized decisions\" \n7  that had no systemic effect to allegedly pre-existing systemic discriminatory acts to extend the statute \n8  oflimitations on the later acts.  Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir. 2003). \n9 \nV \n10 \nPLAINTIFFS CANNOT SEEK REDRESS \n11 \nFOR THE NON-RENEWAL OF BURCH'S CONTRACT \n12 \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  \"Defendants'  termination  of wrestling  coach  Michael  Burch  also \n13 \nconstituted  retaliation  against  Plaintiffs  and  not  just  against  Coach  Burch,  because  Mr.  Burch \n14 \nsupported women's wrestling and was willing to coach women wrestlers.\"  (Exhibit A, Complaint, ~ \n15 \n157.) Their attempt to seek redress for an employment decision pertaining to Burch fails as matter of \n16  law to constitute a claim for retaliation under Title IX. \n17 \nA.  Plaintiffs Do Not Have Standing to Seek Redress For Actions Taken Against Others \n18  Absent \"exceptional situations,\" a plaintiff \"may not seek redress for injuries done to others.\" \n19  Moose Lodge No.  107 v. Irvis 407 U.S.  163, 166,92 S. Ct. 1965, 1968 (1972).  The Supreme Court \n20  has determined that third party standing is proper only where:  (I) the litigant has suffered an '''injury \n21  in fact,' thus giving him or her a 'sufficiently concrete interest' in the outcome of the issue in dispute\"; \n22  (2) \"the litigant must have a close relation to the third party\" and (3) \"there must exist some hindrance \n23  to the third party's ability to protect his or her own interests.\"  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400,411, III \n24  S. Ct. 1364, 1370-71 (1991).  Plaintiffs have not alleged a sufficiently close relationship to Burch to \n25  justify third party standing.  Further, Burch had no \"hindrance\" to protect his rights as he filed his own \n26  lawsuit over this issue.  (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit 1.) \n27  In interpreting Title IX, other courts disallowed similar, but \"reversed,\" claims based on the \n28  standing  concerns.  These  cases  involve  situations  where  a  coach  sues  based  on  allegedly \n7 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 16 of 29\n1  discriminatory acts taken against students.  Lowrey v. Texas A &  M Univ. Sys., 117 F .3d 242, 251 \n2  (5th Cir.  1997) (\"were we asked to afford Lowrey a remedy for the rights of her students, we would \n3  hold that she does not have standing to assert the rights of third persons under Title IX\"); Hankinson v. \n4  Thomas County Sch. Dist., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25576, * 7-8 (M.D. Ga. 2005) (\"Plaintiff does not \n5  have  standing  to  bring  a  Title  IX  claim  on  behalf of the  students  participating  in  the  softball \n6  program\"). \n7  B.  As a Matter of Law and Sound Judicial Policy, Plaintiffs Cannot Base Their Claims on \nActions Relating to Their Coach. \n8 \n9  Even if Plaintiffs contend that they are seeking redress for injuries done to them resulting from \n10  Burch's departure, the retaliation claim still lacks merit.  In Shaposhnikov v. Pacifica Sch. Dist., 2006 \n11  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18330 *25, n 9 (N.D. Cal. 2006), the Northern District rejected a claim under Title \n12  IX  based on actions taken against others. There, the plaintiff asserted a Title IX retaliation claim \n13  because of \"defendants' 'apologetic' communications with the parents of the harassers and because \n14  one of the harassers had his suspension reduced and was placed in a 'peer helper' class.\"  The Court \n15  found that such assertions could not form the basis of a retaliation claim noting that \"[t]he Court does \n16  not  agree  that  these  actions  can  qualifY  as  retaliation,  as  they  did  not  involve  plaintiff.\"  (Id.) \n17  Similarly, employment actions taken against Burch did not involve Plaintiffs. \n18  In Choike v. Slippery Rock Univ. of Pa. of the State Sys. of Higher Educ., 2006 U.S. Dist. \n19  LEXIS 49886, *38-39 (W.D. Pa. 2006), the Eastern District of Pennsylvania took a similar position. \n20  There, a coach sought relief under Title IX where allegedly discriminatory decisions to cut women's \n21  sports teams resulted in the loss of his coaching position on the cut teams. Coach Yeamans reasoned \n22  that he had a viable Title IX discrimination claim because \"he has lost his coaching positions as a \n23  result of discrimination on the basis of sex.\" (Id.  at 38.) The Court disagreed:  \"Yeamans'  loss of \n24  coaching jobs was  a mere  by-product  of its  decisions  to  eliminate the  women's  swimming  and \n25  women's  water polo  teams.  No  intentional  discrimination was  directed  to  Yeamans.\"  (I4J  Any \n26  injuries that  resulted  from  Burch's departure  were  similarly a \"mere by-product\"  of the  decision \n27  related to Burch's employment. \n28  The Court should also be guided by other policy considerations.  First, Title IX is a spending \n8 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 17 of 29\n1  clause statute.  In crafting the scope of spending clause claims, Courts have required that the federal \n2  government clearly delineate the scope of the cause of action to state entities that accept funds from \n3  the federal government.  Penhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S. Ct. 1531, \n4  1540 (1981).  Thus, a state entity can only be liable for claims \"if the funding recipient is on notice \n5  that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature.\"  Barnes v. Gorman, 536 \n6  U.S.  181,  187, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 2101  (2002).  The Supreme Court has determined that the Penhurst \n7  doctrine is not violated in allowing a direct victim of Title IX retaliation to sue for damages.  Jackson \n8  v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S.  167, 182, 125 S. Ct.  1497, 1509 (2005).  However, Jackson \n9  cannot be interpreted as permitting claims based on secondary effects to \"indirect victims.\"  Choike, \n10  2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49886 at *38.  Allowing Plaintiffs' claims based on Burch's non-renewal to \n11  proceed would mean that every time a teacher, coach or counselor is terminated and the terminated \n12  employee asserts a Title IX claim, a school could face lawsuits by dozens (or possibly even hundreds) \n13  of students who claim they were affected by the discriminatory personnel decision.  Surely, federal \n14  funding recipients could not have contemplated such liability in accepting federal funds. \n15  Second, allowing Plaintiffs to seek redress for Burch's non-renewal will create a \"trial within a \n16  trial.\"  To combat Plaintiffs' contention that Burch's contract was not renewed in retaliation for their \n17  protected activity, Defendants would be required to set forth the legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for \n18  Burch's non-renewal-- reasons which Plaintiffs would most likely seek to dispute.  Resolving this one \n19  alleged \"adverse action\" would necessarily require trying the entire Burch lawsuit in this case. This \n20  \"trial  within a trial\" would  unduly  burden this  Court and the  parties  and  would  also  result in  a \n21  duplication of the efforts made by the parties who have already litigated and resolved the Burch case \n22  short of trial 3 \n23  Plaintiffs \"cannot rest [their]  claim to relief on the legal rights or interest of third parties.\" \n24  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 499, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2205 (1975).  The decision not to renew Burch's \n25  contract was one discrete act which affected only Burch's employment relationship. As a matter of \n26  standing law and the policy in favor of judicial efficacy, Defendants respectfully request the Court rule \n27 \n28 \nIndeed, on January 30, 2004, the Court determined that this matter and the Burch case were not sufficiently \nconnected to warrant consolidating them.  (Request for Judicial Notice, Exhibit B, Non-Related Case Order.l  . \n9 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(OOS00957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 18 of 29\n1  that Plaintiffs cannot seek redress for Burch's non-renewal as an \"adverse action.\" \n2  c.  Burch's Non-Renewal Was Not a Materially Adverse Employment Action \n3  In Burlington Northern and  Santa Fe Ry.  Co.  v.  White,  126 S.  Ct. 2405,  2414, (2006) the \n4  Supreme Court held that in order to constitute a retaliatory adverse action, \"a plaintiff must show that \n5  a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse.\"  A retaliation \n6  claim does not contemplate providing redress for \"petty slights or minor annoyances.\"  (lQJ  Further, \n7  the Court views the materiality requirement from the \"objective\" point of view of a reasonable person \n8  in the plaintiff s circumstances.  (lQJ  Even if Plaintiffs could seek redress for damages suffered as a \n9  result of Burch's non-renewal, such damages do not meet the materiality test. \n10  The complaint alleges that \"Coach Michael Burch informed the women that Defendants had \n11  terminated  all  wrestling  athletic  participation  opportunities  for  female  students  but  not  for  male \n12  students (the 'No Females Directive''').  (Exhibit A, ~ 60.)  Plaintiffs further contend that as a result of \n13  the \"directive\" they were denied the benefits given to varsity wrestlers.  (Id. at ~~ 61-62.)  They further \n14  contend that Defendants initially \"refused\" to rescind the alleged directive after they protested it.  (Id. \n15  at ~ 63.)  Eventually, the women wrestlers were reinstated.  (Id. at ~ 74.)  However, the Plaintiffs were \n16  informed they could only wrestle if they beat any competing male wrestlers.  (Id. at ~ 77.) \n17  The  complaint  does  not  explain  how  the  decision  not  to  renew  Burch's  contract  caused \n18  Plaintiffs any \"material\" harm.  Notwithstanding the fact that Burch did not seem inclined to treat \n19  males  and  females  equally by  requiring both  genders to  try  out for  spots  on the  team,  it  is  this \n20  requirement that forms the basis of Plaintiffs' allegations.  Plaintiffs cannot recover on a theory that \n21  they were entitled under Title IX to a coach who gave preferential treatment to women by holding \n22  them to lower standards for making the team than the standards applied to male students. \n23 \nVI \n24 \nPLAINTIFFS CANNOT RECOVER PUNITIVE \n25 \nDAMAGES AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY UNDER TITLE IX \n26 \nPlaintiffs seek punitive damages \"to the extent permitted by law.\" (Exhibit A, Complaint, p. \n27 \n55:2-3.)  All claims for punitive damages under federal law are barred by Newport v. Fact Concerts, \n28 \nInc. (1981) 453 U.S. 247, 271,101 S. Ct. 2748, 2762, an opinion in which the Supreme Court held that \n10 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 19 of 29\n1  punitive damages are not available against government entities under 42 U.S.c. § 1983.  Other Courts \n2  have determined that Newport is equally applicable to Title IX claims.  Landon v. Oswego Unit Sch. \n3  Dist.  308,  143 F.Supp.2d 1011,  1014 (N.D. Ill. 2001); Crawford by Jefferson v.  School Dist.  1998 \n4  U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8064 (E.D. Pa. 1998); also see A.M.J. v. Royalton Pub. Sch., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n5  90532, *6-7 (D. Minn. 2006). \n6  Plaintiffs' punitive damage claims under Title IX are also barred by the Barnes v. Gorman, 536 \n7  U.S. 181, 122 S. Ct. 2097 (2002) opinion. In Barnes, the Court held that \"Title VI funding recipients \n8  have not, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.\"  (Id. at \n9  188, 2102.)  Barnes also noted that the \"Court has interpreted Title IX consistently with Title VI.. .. \" \n10 \nId. at 185,2100.  Thus, Barnes' holding as to Title VI is equally applicable to Title IX.  Mercer v. \n11 \nDuke Univ., 401  FJd 199,202 (4th Cir. 2005) (noting in a Title IX suit that \"the Supreme Court's \n12 \ndecision in Barnes compelled us to vacate Mercer's punitive damage award.\"); Frechel-Rodriguez v. \n13 \nP.R. Dep't ofEduc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21020, *20 (D.P.R. 2007). \n14 \nVII \n15 \nPLAINTIFFS CANNOT RECOVER EMOTIONAL \n16  DISTRESS DAMAGES AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY UNDER TITLE IX \nIn Barnes, the Supreme Court noted that under \"Title IX, which contains no express remedies, \nl7 \n18  a recipient of federal funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, [citation], and \n19  injunction, [citation], forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.\"  Barnes, \n20  536 U.S. at 187,2101 (emphasis added).  In supporting this conclusion, the Supreme Court cited to the \n21  Restatement Second of Contracts.  As  to  claims for  emotional distress,  the Restatement (Second) \n22  indicates that \"Recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also  caused \n23  bodily harm or the contract or the breach is of such a kind that serious emotional disturbance was a \n24  particularly  likely result.\"  Restatement  (Second)  of Contracts  §  353  (1981);  also  see  Erlich  v. \n25  Menezes,  21  Cal.4th 543,  558  (1999)  (\"damages  for  mental  suffering  and  emotional  distress are \n26  generally not recoverable in an action for breach of an ordinary commercial contract in California\"). \n27  The Restatement clarifies that \"common examples\" of cases where emotional distress damages can be \n28  recovered in a contract claim include \"contracts of carriers and innkeepers with passengers and guests, \n11 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 20 of 29\n1  contracts  for  the carriage or proper disposition of dead  bodies,  aDd  contracts  for  the  delivery of \n2  messages concerning death.\" (lsL Comments & Illustrations: Comment a.)  The Restatement adds that \n3  breaches \"resulting for example in sudden impoverishment or bankruptcy\" may also justify damages \n4  for emotional distress damages where \"this was a particularly likely risk .... \"  (IQJ \n5  The gravamen of the complaint is that the Plaintiffs were not allowed to participate on the \n6  wrestling team unless they  could defeat a male student to  earn a sport on the roster.  (Exhibit A, \n7  Complaint, p. 42.)  As noted above, emotional distress damages cannot be recovered for a breach of \n8  contract absent extreme circumstaDces relating to matters such as impoverishment or death.  Even \n9  taking all allegations in the complaint as true, nothing in the complaint meets the threshold set out in \n10  the  Restatement.  Jennings  v.  NathaDson,  404  F.Supp.2d 380, 396  (D.  Mass.  2005)  (interpreting \n11  Massachusetts law aDd  noting \"the showing that a plaintiff must make  is  quite high\" to  recover \n12  emotional distress in a contract claim). \n13  In Davis v. Momoe County Bd. of Ed., 526 U.S. 629, 119 S. Ct. 1661 (1999), Gebser v. Lago \n14  Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U.S. 274,  118  S.  Ct.  1989 (1998), aDd  Franklin v.  Gwinnett \n15  County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60,  117 L. Ed.2d 208, 112 S.  Ct.  1028 (1992) the Supreme Court \n16  authorized claims for damages under Title IX without discussing whether such available damages \n17  encompassed non-economic damages.  Even assuming those cases impliedly approve of emotional \n18  distress claims under Title IX, they are reconcilable with Barnes aDd the Second Restatement because \n19  subjecting  a  student  to  \"severe,  pervasive,  aDd  objectively  offensive\"  harassment  (or  being \n20  \"deliberately indifferent\" to  severe harassment)  is  the type of a breach of an obligation of which \n21  \"serious emotional disturbaDce was a particularly likely result.\"  Thus, the standard set out by the \n22  above Title IX trilogy is perfectly consistent with a contract-type emotional distress damage staDdard. \n23  VIII \n24  PLAINTIFFS' 42 U.S.C. §1983 CLAIM IS SUBSUMED BY TITLE IX \n25  \"When the remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they \n26  may  suffice to  demonstrate  congressional  intent to  preclude the  remedy  of suits under  §  1983.\" \n27  Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. Nat'l Sea Clammers Ass'n, 453  U.S.  1,20, 101  S.  Ct. 2615, \n28  2626 (1981).  There is a split in authority on whether Title IX claims pre-empt 42  U.S.C.  § 1983 \n12 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 21 of 29\n1  claims based on the same facts.  Many courts have held that such claims are pre-empted.  Boulahanis \n2  v. Board of Regents, 198 F.3d 633,640 (7th Cir. 1999); Bruneau v. South Kortright Cent. Sch. Dist., \n3  163 F.3d 749, 758 (2nd Cir. 1998) (\"a § 1983 claim based on the Equal Protection Clause is subsumed \n4  by Title IX\"); Waid v. Merrill Area Pub. Sch., 91  F.3d 857,862 (7th Cir. 1996) (a plaintiff may not \n5  claim that a single set of facts leads to causes of action under both Title IX and § 1983\"); Pfeiffer v. \n6  Marion Ctr. Area Sch. Dist., 917 F.2d 779, 789 (3rd Cir.  1990) (same); Freche1-Rodriguez v.  P.R. \n7  Dep't of Educ., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21020, *15 (D.P.R. 2007); McCarthy v. Underhill, 2006 U.S. \n8  Dist. LEXIS 25555 *9-19 (D. Nev. 2006) (finding that Title VI claims subsume § 1983 claims based \n9  on the same facts); Doe v. Town of Bourne, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10021 (D. Mass. 2004) (\"to the \n10  extent the Does pursue § 1983 claims premised on equal protection violations or on violations of Title \n11  IX, they are precluded by Title IX\"); Levine v. Regents of the Univ., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26091, \n12  *10-11  (N.D. Cal. 2003); Hendrichsen v. Ball State Univ., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3710, *7-8 (S.D. \n13  Ind.  2003);  and  Henkle  v.  Gregory,  150  F.Supp.2d  1067,  1074  (D.  Nev.  2001)  (\"it  would  be \n14  inconsistent and contrary to the  above  authority to allow plaintiff  to pursue constitutional claims \n15  through § 1983 based on the identical facts as the Title IX claims\").  Other courts have held that Title \n16  IX has no pre-emptive effect on 42 U.S.C. section 1983 claims.  See e.g. Crawford v. Davis, 109 F.3d \nl7  1281, 1284 (8th Cir. 1997); Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1233 (10th Cir. 1996). \n18  This issue was recently decided by the Eastern District.  In Travis v. Folsom Cordova Unified \n19  Sch.  Dist., 2007 U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  11566 (E.D.  Cal.  2007),  Judge England ruled that \"Title VI is \n20  sufficiently comprehensive to evince congressional intent to foreclose a § 1983 remedy.\"  Id.  at 15. \n21  Judge England noted that Title VI has various interpretive regulations that provide administrative \n22  remedies to enforce the statute and pointed out that the Supreme Court has also found that Congress \n23  implied a private right of action. Id. at 15.  The Court further noted that the Supreme Court's most \n24  recent pronouncement on the § 1983 pre-emption issue, City of Rancho Palos Verdes, Cal. v. Abrams, \n25  544 U.S. 113, 125 S. Ct. 1453, (2005), held that a more limited remedial scheme militated in favor of \n26  pre-emption.  The Court correctly noted that Title VI's remedies are narrower in scope than 42 U.S.C. \n27  § 1983.  Travis, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11566 *15-16. \n28  Judge England's reasoning is equally applicable to Plaintiffs' Title IX claims.  The Supreme \n13 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 22 of 29\n1  Court has treated Title IX and Title VI as being virtually interchangeable and acknowledged that both \n2  statutes share the same remedial administrative scheme. Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441  U.S. \n3  677,694-96,99 S. Ct. 1946, 1956-57 (1979) (\"Except for the substitution of the word 'sex' in Title IX \n4  to replace the words 'race, color, or national origin' in Title VI, the two statutes use identical language \n5  to  describe  the  benefited  class.  Both  statutes  provide  the  same  administrative  mechanism  for \n6  terminating federal  financial  support for institutions engaged  in prohibited discrimination\").  Since \n7  Plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim is based on the same facts as their Title IX claim, it is pre-empted. \n8  Plaintiffs may contend that Travis is inapplicable because they are only asserting 42 U.S.C. § \n9  1983 claims against the individual Defendants.  However, Judge England noted that the § 1983 claims \n10  against individuals are also pre-empted as \"[a] llowing Plaintiffs to plead around the detailed statutory \n11  scheme created by Title VI by pleading a § 1983 claim against the defendant in his individual capacity \n12  would be inconsistent with Congress' creation of restrictions on Title VI claims.\" Travis, 2007 U.S. \n13  Dist. LEXIS 11566, at * 16. \n14  IX \n15  THE UNIVERSITY IS IMMUNE TO ALL STATE LAW CLAIMS \n16  The UNIVERSITY is an arm of the state for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.  Thompson \n17  v.  Los  Angeles,  885  F.2d  1439,  1442-43  (9th Cir.  1989).  Accordingly,  it is  immune to  state  law \n18  claims in federal court unless the state has consented to such jurisdiction.  Stanley v. Trs. of the Cal. \n19  State Univ., 433 FJd 1129, 1133-34 (9th Cir. 2006) (holding that enactment of the Unruh Act \"does \n20  not specifically consent to federal court actions\"); BV Engineering v. University of California, 858 \n21  F.2d 1394, 1395 (9th Cir.  1988).  All claims asserted against the UNIVERSITY based on state law \n22  must be dismissed. \n23 \nX \n24 \nTHERE IS NO CLAIM FOR RELIEF FOR DAMAGES UNDER \n25 \nARTICLE I, SECTION 7 OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n26 \nArticle I, Sections 7 is \"self-executing\" and creates a private right of action \"against a proper \n27 \ndefendant for declaratory relief or for  injunction.\"  Katzberg v.  Regents  of the Univ.  of Cal.,  29 \n28 \nCal.4th 300, 306-07 (2002).  However, California courts have determined \"there is no evidence of any \n14 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 23 of 29\n1  intent on the part of the voters to  permit the recovery of personal injury damages as a result of a \n2  violation of the equal protection provisions of the California Constitution.\" Gates v. Superior Court, 32 \n3  Cal.App.4th 481,518 (1995); also see Katzberg, 29 Cal.4th 329 [same as to Article I, Section 7's due \n4  process component].  Accordingly, all claims for damages based on this provision must be dismissed. \nS  XI \n6  TWO OF THE EDUCATION CODE PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH \nPLAINTIFFS SUE DO NO AUTHORIZE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION \n7 \nPlaintiffs' sixth claim for relief is premised on various state statutes. \n8 \nEducation Code §66016 provides that: \n9 \n\"It is the intent of the Legislature that opportunities for participation in intercollegiate \n10 \nathletic programs in the community colleges, in the campuses of the California State \nUniversity, and in the campuses of the University of California be provided on as equal \n11 \na basis as is practicable to male and female students.  The costs of providing these equal \n12  opportunities may vary according to the type of sports contained within the respective \nmen's and women's athletic programs. Therefore, it is also the intent of the Legislature \n13 \nthat additional sources of revenue should be determined to provide additional funds for \nthese equal opportunity programs.\" \n14 \nlS  Education Code §66030 provides that: \n16  (a)  It is the intent of the Legislature that public higher education in California strive \nto provide educationally equitable environments which give each Californian, regardless \n17 \nof ethnic origin, race, gender, age, disability, or economic circumstance, a reasonable \nopportunity to develop fully his or her potential. \n18 \n19  (b)  It is the responsibility of the governing boards of institutions of higher education \nto  ensure  and  maintain  multicultural  learning  environments  free  from  all  forms  of \n20 \ndiscrimination and harassment, in accordance with state and federal law. \n21 \n22  Neither Education Code § 66016 nor § 66030 provide an express legislative grant of a private \n23  right  of action.  Compare  with Education Code  §66292.4  (expressly authorizing a civil action for \n24  violations of the Education Code sections within that Chapter). \"[W)hen neither the language nor the \n2S  history of a statute indicates an intent to  create a new private right to  sue,  a party contending for \n26  judicial recognition of such a right bears a heavy, perhaps insurmountable, burden of persuasion.\" \n27  Crusader Ins.  Co.  v.  Scottsdale Ins.  Co\" 54 Cal.App.4th 121,  133  (1997);  Rosales v.  City of Los \n28  Angeles,  82  Cal.App.4th 419,  428  (2000)  (\"The fact that a remedy or penalty for violation of its \n15 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 24 of 29\n1  mandates was not included in the statute is a strong indication that such a right was not intended\"); \n2  Vikco Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Ohio Indemnity Co., 70 Cal.App.4th 55, 62-63 (1999) (same). \n3  The California Court of Appeal had, many years ago, adopted the three-part test used by the \n4  Restatement  of Torts,  Second,  to  determine  whether a statute  implies  a private  remedy  \"(1)  the \n5  plaintiff belongs to the class of persons the statute is intended to protect; (2) a private remedy will \n6  appropriately further the purpose of the legislation; and (3) such a remedy appears to be needed to \n7  assure the effectiveness of the statute.\"  Jacobellis v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 120 F.3d 171, 174 \n8  (9th Cir. 1997). The key factor in the test is whether \"a private right of action is needed to assure the \n9  effectiveness of the statute.\" Arriaga v.  Lorna Linda University,  10 Cal.App.4th 1556, 1564 (1992) \n10  (emphasis original) superseded by statute as stated in Blumhorst v. Jewish Family Services of Los \n11  Angeles,  126 Cal.App.4th 993, 1002 (2005). The California Court of Appeal has suggested that this \n12  test may not be valid after the California Supreme Court's decision in Moradi-Shalal v.  Fireman's \n13  Fund Ins. Companies, 46 Cal.3d 287 (1988). Arriaga, 10 Cal.App.4th at 1564. To the extent the Court \n14  believes this test is still \"useful for evaluating the appropriateness of a private cause of action\" (see \n15  Jacobellis, 120 F.3d at 174), the test does not favor Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs have sued to enforce the same \n16  right under Title IX, the Unruh Act, and various Education Code sections that already authorize a \n17  private right of action. Therefore, recognizing a private right of action under these sections is wholly \n18  unnecessary. \n19  XII \n20  VARIOUS STATE PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH PLAINTIFFS SUE DO NOT \nAUTHORIZE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS \n21 \n22 \nEven with the sections that expressly (or impliedly) authorize a private right of action, there \n23 \nstill remains the question of whether a private right of action for damages exists against the individual \n24 \nDefendants.  Recently, the California Supreme Court indicated that the mere fact that a statute creates \n25  liability against an entity does not mean that any of the entities, agents, or employees is also subject to \n26  liability under that statute.  Reynolds v. Bement, 36 Cal.4th 1075, 1086 (2005) (holding that managing \n27  agents are not personally liable for wage and hour violations under the Labor Code). \n28  In Reynolds, the Supreme Court determined that the \"best indicator\" to determine whether the \n16 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 25 of 29\n1  California Legislature intended to hold individuals liable is \"the language of the provision itself.\"  Id. \n2  at  1086.  The  statutes at issue in Reynolds required \"an employer\" to  pay overtime under certain \n3  conditions and authorized a private right of action to enforce that right without specifying who could \n4  be held liable for violating that right.  After reviewing the statute, applicable regulations, and common \n5  law principles, the Court concluded that \"[hl ad the Legislature meant in section 1194 to expose to \n6  personal civil liability any corporate agent who' exercises control' over an employee's wages, hours, \n7  or working conditions, it would have manifested its intent more clearly than by mere silence after the \n8  IWC's promulgation of Wage Order No.9.\"  Id. at 1086-88.  Thus, individual liability is not presumed. \n9  Thornburg v.  Superior Court,  138  Cal.App.4th 43,  52  (2006) (\"[w]hen agents and employees  are \n10  acting in their official capacities on behalf of their principals and not as individuals for their own \n11  advantage, their acts are generally privileged and do not give rise to liability in tort or under statutes \n12  which impose duties on their principals\"). \n13  The key inquiry as to the text of the provisions at issue shows no evidence of an intent to hold \n14  individuals liable: \n15  1.  California  Constitution,  Article  I,  §  31 (a)  provides  that  \"The  state  shall  not \n16  discriminate\" based on the enumerated characteristics.  The \"state\" is defined to include various public \n17  entities without making a single reference to an individual.  Cal Const, Art I § 31(f). \n18  2.  California  Education  Code  §  220  provides  that:  \"No person  shall  be  subjected  to \n19  discrimination on the basis of sex ... in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution \n20  that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or emolls pupils who receive state student \n21  financial aid.\" \n22  3.  California Education Code § 221.7 provides in, pertinent part, that: \n23  \"(a) The Legislature finds and declares that female pupils are not accorded opportunities \nfor participation in school-sponsored athletic programs equal to  those accorded male \n24 \npupils. It is the intent of the Legislature that opportunities for participation in athletics be \nprovided equally to male and female pupils. \n25 \n26  (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other provisions  of law,  no  public  funds  shall  be  used  in \nconnection with any athletic program conducted under the auspices of a school district \n27 \ngoverning board, or any student organization within the district, which does not provide \nequal opportunity to both sexes for participation and for use of facilities. Facilities and \n28 \nparticipation  include,  but  are  not limited to,  equipment  and  supplies,  scheduling  of \n17 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n(00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 26 of 29\n1  games  and  practice  time,  compensation  for  coaches,  travel  arrangements,  per diem, \nlocker rooms, and medical services.\" \n2 \n3  4.  California Education Code § 66016 (Text is set out above on page 15.) \n4  5.  California Education Code § 66030 (Text is set out above on page 15.) \n5  6.  California Education Code § 66251 provides, in pertinent part, that: \"It is the policy of \n6  the State of California to afford all persons, regardless of their sex ... equal rights and opportunities in \n7  the post-secondary institutions of the state. The purpose of this chapter is to prohibit acts that are \n8  contrary to that policy and to provide remedies therefore.\" \n7.  California Education Code § 66252 provides, in pertinent part, that: \n9 \n\"(a) All students have the right to participate fully in the educational process, free from \n10 \ndiscrimination and harassment. \n11 \n(b) California's post-secondary educational institutions have an affirmative obligation to \n12 \ncombat racism, sexism, and other forms of bias, and a responsibility to provide equal \n13  educational opportunity. \n14 \n(f) It is  the intent of the  Legislature that each post-secondary educational institution \n15  undertake educational activities to counter discriminatory incidents on school grounds \nand, within constitutional bounds, to minimize and eliminate a hostile environment on \n16 \nschool grounds that impairs the access of students to equal educational opportunity. \n17 \n(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that this chapter shall be interpreted as consistent \n18 \nwith Article 9.5 [commencing with Section 11135] of Chapter I of Part I of Division 3 \nof Title 2 of the Government Code, Title VI of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n19 \nU.S.C. Sec.  1981, et seq.), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. \n20  Sec.  1681, et seq.), Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973  (29 U.S.C. \nSec.  794(a», the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C.  Sec. \n21 \n1400 et seq.), the Federal Equal Educational Opportunities Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1701, et \nseq.),  the  Unruh  Civil  Rights  Act  (Sees.  51  to  53,  incl.,  Civ.  C.),  and  the  Fair \n22 \nEmployment and Housing Act (Pt. 2.8 [commencing with Sec. 12900), Div. 3, Gov. C.], \n23  except where this chapter may grant more protections or impose additional obligations, \nand that the remedies provided herein shall not be the exclusive remedies, but may be \n24 \ncombined with remedies that may be provided by the above statutes.\" \n25 \nThe first five provisions make absolutely no suggestion that any individual could be held liable \n26 \nfor damages arising from a violation of the statute.  The second and third provisions do not even apply \n27 \nto the UNIVERSITY or its employees as they only govern elementary and \"secondary\" (high) schools. \n28 \nSee Education Code §§  52,210-210.1.  The fifth provision makes no direct reference to  individual \n18 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 27 of 29\n1  liability, but does incorporate the remedies of other state and federal anti-discrimination statutes.  It \n2  further states that it should be \"interpreted consistently\" with the cited statutes.  The most pertinent \n3  statute is Title IX.  Cases interpreting Title IX have consistently held that Title IX only creates liability \n4  for federal funding recipients, not individuals.  Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dis!., 171 FJd 607,610-\n5  11  (8th Cir.  1999); Smith v. Metropolitan Sch. Dis!. Perry Twp.,  128 F.3d 1014, 1019-20 (7th Cir. \n6  1997); Bowers v. Baylor Univ., 862 F.Supp. 142, 146 (W.D. Tex. 1994); also see Miller v. Maxwell's \n7  Int'l, 991 F.2d 583, 587-88 (9th Cir. 1993) (no individual liability under Title VII or the ADEA); Reno \n8  v. Baird, 18 Cal.4th 640, 663 (1998) (\"individuals who do not themselves qualify as employers may \n9  not  be  sued  under  the  FEHA  for  alleged  discriminatory  acts\").  Since  none  of the  above-cited \n10  provisions suggest that any of the individuals may be subject to a private right of action for damages, \n11  Defendants respectfully  request that  the  Court  dismiss  all  claims  under  these  statutes  against  all \n12  individual Defendants. \n13  XIII \n14  THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TO DISCRETIONARY IMMUNITY \n15  California Government Code §820.2 states: \n16  Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury \nresulting from  his  act or omission where the act or omission was the  result  of the \n17 \nexercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused. \n18 \nGovernment Code § 820.2 immunity applies where a public employee makes a discretionary, \n19 \nas  opposed to a ministerial, decision.  A decision is  discretionary where an employee consciously \n20 \nbalances risks and advantages of such a decision.  Johnson v. State, 69 Cal.2d 782, 795 (1968).  An act \n21 \nis said to be ministerial when it amounts \"only to an obedience to orders, or the performance of a duty \n22 \nin which the public employee is left no choice of his own.\" McCorkle v. Los Angeles, 70 Cal.2d 252, \n23 \n261 (1969). \n24 \nTo  the  extent  any  state  claims  survIve,  they  are  barred  by  discretionary  immunity.  The \n25 \ncomplaint alleges that \"each of the individual defendants has authority over the athletic programs at \n26 \nUC-Davis and has participated in the discriminatory actions and decisions ....\"   (Exhibit A, Complaint, \n27 \np. 10:1-4.)  The complaint goes on to allege Plaintiffs version of the events, including an alleged \"no \n28 \nfemale  directive\" prohibiting the  women wrestlers from  participating on the team (Id.  at  18: 1-7), \n19 \nMemorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings \n{00500957.DOq \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 189    Filed 06/05/07   Page 28 of 29\n1  discussions with WA  RZECKA about the matter (Id. at 18: 13-20), a suggestion by WARZECKA that \n2  the women wrestlers form a club team (Id. at 18:17-20), a meeting with FRANKS (Id. at 19:16-20), \n3  Defendants' participation in a Student Senate meeting on the issue (Id. at 19:21-24), significant media \n4  publicity  (Id.  at  20: 1-5),  interactions with a member of the  State Legislature who  \"threatened to \n5  withhold state funding\" over the matter (Id. at 20:6-11), and, finally, the creation and implementation \n6  of a policy that the female wrestlers could tryout for the wrestling team based on the same terms and \n7  conditions as male athletes (Id. at 21: 11-15) made in conjunction with the OCR (Request for Judicial \n8  Notice, Exhibits E-K.).  The allegations in the complaint and the evidence provided via judicial notice \n9  leave no  room  for  doubt that Defendants made  discretionary decisions with respect to  Plaintiffs' \n10  demands  after  much  deliberation  and  in  light  of  many  external  factors  such  as  legislative, \n11  administrative, and media intervention.  As a matter of law, the individual Defendants are entitled to \n12  discretionary immunity as to all state law claims.  Caldwell v.

A ruling on these issues will eliminate the need to \n18  address them in a later motion for summary judgment which will focus on issues of mixed law and \n19  fact. \n20  Dated: June ~, 2007  PORTER, SCOTT, WEIBERG & DELEHANT \nA Professional Corporation \n21 \n22 \nBy  ~/]4 (  (t.J:_ _C  /!

Morgan left undisturbed our \ncase law governing continuing systemic vi-\nolations. \n \n[26][27] UCD next urges this court to conclude \nthat the § 1983 claim against the individual defendants \nis precluded by the doctrine of qualified immunity. \nThe defendants, however, did not raise a qualified \nimmunity defense in any of their dispositive motions \nbefore the district court.FN23 Our discretion to affirm \non grounds other than those relied on by the district \ncourt extends to issues raised in a manner providing \nthe district court an opportunity to rule on it. See \nProctor v. Vishay Intertechnology, Inc., 584 F.3d 1208, \n1226  (9th  Cir.2009);  Washington  v.  Confederated \nBands and Tribes of Yakima Indian Nation, 439 U.S. \n463, 478 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. 740, 58 L.Ed.2d 740 (1979) \n(“[T]he prevailing party ... was of course free to de-\nfend its judgment on any ground properly raised be-\nlow whether or not that ground was relied upon, re-\njected, or even considered by the District Court. ...”) \n(emphasis added). As the district court has had no \nopportunity  to  rule  on  the  individual  defendants' \nqualified immunity defense, we will not affirm on that \nbasis. The dismissal of the students' § 1983 claim is \ntherefore reversed. \n \nFN23. UCD raised a qualified immunity de-\nfense in its answer to the students' complaint \nbut never litigated it thereafter. \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs' motion to \namend their complaint is dismissed as  moot. The \ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment to the de-\nfendants on the Title IX claim is reversed. The district \ncourt's order dismissing the equal protection § 1983 \nclaim is also reversed, and the case is remanded for \nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. ",

The Ninth Circuit previously held that \nplaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact re-\ngarding UCD's compliance with Title IX. \nThrough this motion, as set forth infra, \nplaintiffs  have  also  presented  sufficient \nevidence  that  each  individual  defendant \nwas responsible for ensuring gender equity, \nwas aware of the alleged lack of com-\npliance with both Title IX and gender eq-\nuity generally, and failed to take or direct \nany conduct to remedy the allegedly dis-\ncriminatory situation. \n \nFurther, defendants' reliance on the OCR \nsettlement is irrelevant to the issue before \nthe court in this case.

INTRODUCTION \n2  Arezou Mansourian, Lauren Mancuso, and Christine Wing-Si Ng (hereafter “Plaintiffs”) \n3  were denied their right to a full and equal public education by the University of California at Davis \n4  (“UCD”).  These committed women wrestlers participated in high school wrestling and chose to \n5  attend UCD because its prestigious women’s varsity wrestling program that would allow them to \n6  participate at the national and intercollegiate level, just as other UCD female students had before \n7  them.  Indeed, UCD had offered women’s wrestling opportunities for years, producing several \n8  nationally and even internationally acclaimed female wrestlers.   \n9  Arezou Mansourian declined admission to the University of California, Riverside’s medical \n10  program in order to wrestle at UCD.  Chris Ng wanted to wrestle because of the confidence it gave \n11  her for other facets of her life.  Lauren Mancuso was a wrestling powerhouse who planned to wrestle \n12  at UCD to prepare her for 2004 Olympics.  All three women had such passion for wrestling that they \n13  fought significant barriers to wrestle at high school.  All three looked forward to continuing this life-\n14  enhancing part of their educational experience at UCD.   \n15  Unfortunately, after Plaintiffs arrived at UCD they were subjected to long-standing sex \n16  discrimination in Defendants’ varsity athletic program.  For decades, Defendants had a policy of \n17  denying women an equal opportunity to participate in the educational program of varsity athletics.  \n18  Although Defendants lawfully separated its varsity athletic opportunities by sex (i.e., men’s \n19  basketball & women’s basketball), it unlawfully failed and refused to allocate those opportunities in \n20  a nondiscriminatory manner.  Defendants had long offered hundreds of opportunities to male \n21  students, but had never added enough opportunities to female students to reach equity or to meet \n22  women’s already existing and developing interests.  Defendants exacerbated this program-wide \n23  discrimination when it reduced women’s opportunities in the late 1990s and early 2000s and when it \n24  eliminated women’s wrestling opportunities entirely, without replacing them, yet retained \n25  opportunities for men. \n26  While Plaintiffs and other female students sought for access to varsity athletic participation \n27  opportunities, Defendants did not listen.  Instead, they spent millions of dollars to start offering \n28  athletic scholarships, to move UCD’s athletic program from NCAA Division II to Division I, and to \n1\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Rather than creating equal \n2  opportunity, Defendants focused on their own dreams of moving UCD into “big time” athletics. \n3  In 2003, Plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso were female students at UCD who wanted to \n4  participate in women’s wrestling but were barred from doing so by Defendants’ discriminatory \n5  policies.  Plaintiff Ng was a recent graduate who had unsuccessfully fought Defendants’ \n6  discrimination to no avail.  All three women wanted equal access to educational athletics for \n7  themselves and for all of UCD’s female students.  All wanted UCD to add athletic opportunities for \n8  women, including wrestling.  All wanted to hold UCD accountable for its discrimination so that no \n9  other women would be subjected to it.  Defendants’ refusal to restore wrestling or any other \n10  opportunities for women triggered this legal action.1 \n11  Plaintiffs allege and will demonstrate at trial that Defendants’ longstanding discriminatory \n12  policies violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and the \n13  Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as enforced \n14  through 42 U.S.C. § 1983.   \n15  Plaintiffs will prevail on their Title IX claim because UCD:  (1) stipulates or otherwise \n16  agrees through undisputed facts that it does not offer female students opportunities to participate in \n17  varsity athletics in numbers substantially proportionate to their enrollment, (2) cannot establish a \n18  history and continuing practice of athletic program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the \n19  developing – or already existing – athletic interests of its female students, and (3) stipulates or \n20  otherwise agrees through undisputed facts that it does not fully and effectively accommodate the \n21  athletic interests and abilities of its female students.2  Unfortunately, UCD has never provided \n                                                 \n22  1 When Plaintiffs filed this action, they primarily sought injunctive relief on behalf of a class \nof all female students who were denied equal access to varsity athletics at UCD.  Plaintiffs were \n23  denied leave to amend the complaint to add additional plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs maintain claims for \ndeclaratory relief to vindicate their cause and money damages to remedy the harm they endured. \n24 \n2 Defendant UCD’s stipulation with respect to Prongs One and Two were filed with the Court \nin the Joint Pretrial Statement and Plaintiffs believe these unamended stipulations remain operative.  \n25 \nPlaintiffs plan to seek clarification regarding the omission of this filed stipulation in the Court’s \nlatest Amended Pretrial Conference Order.  (Dkt. 549.)  Regardless, however, of whether a \n26 \nstipulation is on file, undisputed facts establish UCD’s failure to comply with Prongs One (Dkt. 549, \n§ III Undisputed Facts (hereinafter “UF”) ¶ 21 & Appendix A thereto) and Prong Three (UF ¶¶ 22-\n27 \n25). \n28 \n2\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Notably, \n2  Defendant Regents of the University of California (“Regents”) has the burden of proof on the one \n3  issue to which it has not already conceded noncompliance.  No school has ever met this burden.  Nor \n4  can Defendant Regents here. \n5  Plaintiffs will prevail on their Equal Protection Claim because the Individual Defendants are \n6  high ranking UCD officials who had direct responsibility for or direct involvement in operating \n7  UCD’s athletic program and in ensuring gender equity at the university.  Instead of providing that \n8  equity, the Individual Defendants have chosen to discriminate on the basis of sex in the allocation of \n9  varsity athletic participation opportunities and in offering varsity wrestling opportunities to men but \n10  not women.  The sex discrimination is clear and indisputable.  It is facially apparent in the disparate \n11  allocation of athletic opportunities (as reported by UCD to the Department of Education) and in its \n12  refusal at the same time to provide opportunities at all for women in wrestling.  Thus, the trial of \n13  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claim will turn on whether the Individual Defendants can demonstrate \n14  an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for their disparate treatment of male and female students.  \n15  To-date, the Individual Defendants have failed to provide any justification, let alone an exceedingly \n16  persuasive reason. \n17  Finally, as this Court has already held, the Individual Defendants cannot escape \n18  responsibility for their actions through qualified immunity.  Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to be free \n19  from sex discrimination in education was and remains well settled.  It has been 30 years since the \n20  Supreme Court told the Mississippi University for Women that it could not offer nursing school \n21  opportunities only to women (not men) and nearly 20 years since the Ninth Circuit held that that the \n22  Equal Protection Clause may be violated when athletic opportunities are unequal or when there is \n23  inequality in opportunity in a given sport.  Yet, the Individual Defendants willfully ignored these \n24  constitutional mandates and, despite numerous complaints and public outcry, refused to provide \n25  Plaintiffs and other female students the opportunities they deserved – and to which they were legally \n26  entitled.  The Individual Defendants’ actions deprived Plaintiffs of their right to a public university \n27  experience on the same terms offered to men, and thus deprived Plaintiffs of a full and equal public \n28  education. \n3\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

STATEMENT OF FACTS \n2  Defendants Regents, Vanderhoef, Franks, Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher cultivated a systemic \n3  discriminatory policy that did not expand female intercollegiate3 athletic opportunities responsive to \n4  interest and that excluded women from their fair share of those opportunities.  Defendants’ long \n5  history of discriminating against women and Plaintiffs in the provision of intercollegiate \n6  participation opportunities will speak for itself at trial. \n7  A.  The Parties. \n8  Plaintiffs Ng, Mansourian, and Mancuso were three young women who wrestled in high \n9  school and came to UCD to join a long tradition of women wrestling at the intercollegiate level.  For \n10  Plaintiffs, wrestling was a formative part of their scholastic experience, and one that developed their \n11  strong work ethic and tenacity as young adults. Ng entered UCD in 1998 and graduated in 2002.  \n12  (UF ¶ 6.)  Mancuso entered UCD in 2000 and graduated in 2004.  (UF ¶ 7.)  Mancuso entered UCD \n13  in 2001 and graduated in 2006.  (UF ¶ 8.) \n14  The Individual Defendants were/are high ranking officials at UCD.  Defendant Vanderhoef \n15  was the chancellor of the entire university who was responsible for all UCD’s programs (including \n16  athletics) and for UCD’s compliance with civil rights laws.  (See UF ¶ 10.)  Defendant Warzecka is \n17  UCD’s athletic director.  (UF ¶ 12.)  He runs the daily operation of UCD’s athletic programs and \n18  makes the ultimate decisions about which programs it will offer.  (Id.)  Defendant Gill-Fisher has \n19  spent nearly her entire adult life at UCD.  (UF ¶ 13.)  She was a UCD student and has worked at \n20  UCD since graduation.  She was the associate athletic director and the senior woman administrator, \n21  responsible for ensuring gender equity.  (Id.)  Given her 40 years in the program, she carried great \n22  weight and influence over its direction.  Defendant Franks was the assistant vice chancellor with \n23  direct responsibility over UCD’s athletic program.  (UF ¶ 11.)  He participated in strategic decisions \n24  about the athletic department and was personally involved in making or ratifying many of the \n25  decisions relevant to this legal action.  (See id.) \n                                                 \n26 \n3 “Intercollegiate” refers to varsity and junior varsity teams, as opposed to club or intramural \nteams, which do not receive coaching or athletic scholarships and other benefits listed in the \n27 \nregulations.

Historic Discrimination in UCD’s Athletic Program.  \n2  While this suit was brought in 2003 by women wrestlers, its history begins decades before.  \n3  UCD’s record confirms that while UCD started sponsoring men’s intercollegiate teams in 1909, it \n4  took several decades for the first woman’s team to be added.  After the passage of Title IX, UCD \n5  added no opportunities for women until it added soccer in 1983 (while simultaneously ending field \n6  hockey.)4  Plaintiffs will also present evidence that UCD dropped women’s golf around the same \n7  time.  Yet, throughout the 1970’s, UCD women expressed interest in or participated in \n8  intercollegiate bowling, rifle, badminton, and synchronized swimming.  Over 30 years later, none of \n9  these sports have been promoted to varsity status.  Throughout the 1980’s, more women created \n10  competitive club sports teams in water polo, equestrian, and crew.  The former varsity field hockey \n11  players also set up a club team of their own.  Women also continued to participate in badminton and \n12  bowling.5  Despite this large, existing evidence of women’s interest in competitive, intercollegiate \n13  athletics, UCD failed to add new varsity opportunities for women throughout the 1970’s, 1980’s, and \n14  early 1990’s. \n15  At trial, Plaintiffs will establish that in 1991, Defendant Pam Gill-Fisher and other UCD \n16  administrators evaluated UCD’s gender equity compliance for the first time since 1976.  The \n17  evaluation concluded that UCD did not provide women with substantially proportionate athletic \n18  participation opportunities and that its record “cannot be termed a demonstrably responsive process \n19  of program expansion … particularly when female participation relative to male participation has \n20  been decreasing over the past three years.”  The committee also noted “resistance within the Athletic \n21  Department to UC Davis’s efforts to ensure total compliance with Title IX.”  Meanwhile, UCD \n22  eliminated over 100 women’s opportunities between 1989 and 1991. \n23  Even though UCD recognized that it was not complying with Title IX and was not allocating \n24                                                   \n4 Plaintiffs will show that Defendants added women’s cross country in 1971, but anticipate \n25  that Defendants will claim this sport was actually added at a later date.  Plaintiffs will establish that \nregardless of when this sport was added, UCD’s own records reflect that this sport did not add \n26  opportunities.   \n5 Exhibit A attached hereto reflects the level of participation of women in club sports at UCD \n27 \nfrom 1981, when UCD began to record this data through 1999. \n28 \n5\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 12 of 38\n \n1  athletic participation opportunities equitably, Plaintiffs will demonstrate that the situation worsened.  \n2  In 1992, an associate athletic director warned of a “backslide in compliance,” and in 1993, UCD’s \n3  acting athletic director noted that the ratio of women participating had decreased slightly in recent \n4  years.  Nevertheless, UCD took no action to replace (let alone expand) women’s opportunities until \n5  1995.  By that time, UCD’s gap between female enrollment and female athletic participation was \n6  20%.  (See Ex. B., attached hereto.)6 \n7  Despite UCD’s woefully inadequate record on gender equity and despite 20 years of unmet \n8  women’s interest, UCD added only three new women’s sports (crew, water polo, and lacrosse).  (UF \n9  ¶ 23.)  Even after the addition of these sports, UCD’s participation gap exceeded 11%.  (See Ex. B.)  \n10  Yet, UCD refused to promote other club sports that wanted varsity status, and it failed to devise a \n11  plan to add them over time despite their knowledge of the continued disparity.  Plaintiffs will prove \n12  that after this one-time addition, UCD stopped taking any affirmative steps to address its \n13  longstanding, systemic, program-wide discrimination against female students in the allocation of \n14  varsity athletic participation opportunities.   \n15  In 1994, Congress passed the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (“EADA”), which required \n16  schools that offered intercollegiate athletics to submit participation reports each year, beginning in \n17  October 1996 (for the 1995-1996 school year).  Each and every year thereafter, UCD continued to \n18  allocate participation opportunities through the sports it decided to offer and the sex to whom it \n19  decided to offer those sports.   And each year, it reported those choices on its EADA reports.  Those \n20  reports glaringly show UCD’s discrimination.   \n21  C.  Defendants Continued Its Practice of Non-Expansion With The Elimination of \nFemale Participation Opportunities, Including Wrestling.   \n22 \nShortly after its one-time addition of sports, UCD not only failed and refused to add athletic \n23 \nopportunities for women, but started to backslide again, eliminating 63 women’s opportunities.  At \n24 \nthe same time, women’s enrollment at UCD grew by more than 2,200 students.  As a result, UCD’s \n25 \nparticipation gap grew even more.  UCD’s participation gap exceeded 100 opportunities in the years \n26 \n                                                 \n6 Exhibit B is an excerpt of facts undisputed by Defendants (UF ¶ 21) reflecting the athletic \n27 \nparticipation and enrollment figures UCD by gender starting in 1995. \n28 \n6\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 13 of 38\n \n1  prior to 2003.  \n2  In fall 2000, Plaintiffs will establish that Defendants exacerbated this growing inequity by \n3  ordering the elimination of all women’s wrestling opportunities.  Defendant Warzecka expressly \n4  ordered wrestling coach Mike Burch to eliminate all women wrestlers from the program.  He did not \n5  order the removal of any men … just women.  Burch submitted new participation lists under protest, \n6  duly noting that “the women have been removed per your request.”  Defendant Warzecka’s order \n7  was discriminatory on its face and became the start of UCD’s facially discriminatory policy to \n8  prevent women from wrestling at the varsity level.  Plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng were among the \n9  women removed from the program. \n10  Defendants admit that women were varsity athletes in the wrestling program before their \n11  removal.  (UF ¶¶ 30-41.)  They practiced and sometimes competed under the guidance of the varsity \n12  coach.  (Id.)  They were required to satisfy all of the academic and other requirements of varsity \n13  athletes.  (Id.)  They appeared on official team lists.  (Id.)  They were entitled to all the benefits of \n14  varsity status, including medical insurance, trainers, facilities, lockers, laundry services, and \n15  academic counseling.  (Id.)   \n16  At trial, Plaintiffs will prove that the women wrestlers tried to convince Defendant Warzecka \n17  to reinstate the women’s wrestling program.  He refused and insisted that to continue to wrestle, they \n18  should do it on their own or start a club.  Notably, he did not demote or eliminate the male wrestlers \n19  in the same way.   The women researched starting a club (despite the demotion), but realized they \n20  would lose the benefits of varsity status, including highly qualified coaching.  They tried again for \n21  reinstatement, but were again refused.    \n22  Defendants’ elimination of women’s wrestling provoked massive protests, not just among the \n23  male and female wrestlers, but among the student body as a whole and the state legislature.  Finally, \n24  in late May, 2001, faced with this outcry, Defendants promised to “reinstate” women’s wrestling.  \n25  Defendants, however, did not reinstate women’s wrestling on the same terms and conditions in \n26  which it had previously existed.  Instead, women wrestlers were required to compete against men, \n27  using men’s rules, for spots on the men’s team.  Defendants have never subjected any other women’s \n28  team to this requirement.  They only applied this new tactic to the women wrestlers in order to \n7\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 14 of 38\n \n1  ensure that women’s wrestling at UCD was eliminated. \n2  Plaintiffs will prove at trial that in devising this scheme, Defendants threw both equity and \n3  safety out the window.  The women wrestlers were substantially smaller than the male wrestlers – by \n4  more than 25 pounds in the case of Christine Ng.  While male wrestlers compete in weight classes \n5  with other males who weigh within 4-7 pounds, UCD ordered the women to compete against males \n6  up to 30 pounds heavier.  The male wrestlers were Division I, Pacific 10 Athletic Conference \n7  athletes.  They, thus, were not just larger, stronger, heavier male wrestlers; they were among the best \n8  wrestlers in the nation.  Defendants knew that no woman – not even the best women wrestlers in the \n9  world – could beat the best male wrestlers.  Defendants depended upon this fact, because they never \n10  intended the women to make the men’s team.  Plaintiffs will provide testimony of UCD’s own \n11  trainers and doctor stating that women could not beat men at such levels due to genuine biological \n12  differences.  Plaintiffs will also submit testimony of UCD’s coaches that women in their sports could \n13  not earn spots on the men’s teams.  Plaintiffs will present evidence to establish that sports are sex \n14  segregated in order to ensure that women are given the opportunity to participate.   \n15  UCD’s wrestle-off requirement was merely a restatement of its policy to exclude women \n16  from wrestling.  Plaintiffs Mansourian, Ng, and Mancuso were all removed from the wrestling \n17  program again before competitions even began.  Neither Plaintiffs nor any other female student has \n18  ever been allowed to participate in wrestling at UCD again.    \n19  As Defendants pursued other costly endeavors for the athletic department, providing female \n20  students an equal chance to play remained the lowest of Defendants’ priorities, as it has for decades.  \n21  When Plaintiffs filed this action in 2003, Defendants still discriminated against female students, still \n22  allocated too few athletic opportunities to women, and still failed and refused to offer any women’s \n23  opportunities in wrestling.   Defendants failed to take any steps to add new sports or to replace the \n24  more than 60 women’s opportunities it had cut in the preceding years.  Defendants continued to deny \n25  Plaintiffs the equal opportunity to participate in sports, including the equal opportunity to participate \n26  in wrestling, up through their respective graduations from UCD. \n27  III.  SUMMARY POINTS OF LAW \n28  Plaintiffs will prevail on their Title IX claim against Defendant Regents and will prevail on \n8\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Plaintiffs Will Prevail on Their Title IX Claim.   \n4  Plaintiffs will prevail on their Title IX claim because UCD discriminates against female \n5  students in the allocation of athletic participation opportunities and because it eliminated the \n6  educational opportunity for females (but not males) to participate in wrestling.  Plaintiffs’ case will \n7  rely on undisputed facts, stipulations, judicial admissions, and other evidence presented at trial.  Law \n8  of the case, including factual findings regarding participation and enrollment figures and the status \n9  of women wrestlers as varsity team members by the Ninth Circuit in Mansourian v. Regents of the \n10  University of Cal., supra, 602 F.3d 957, will also compel a judgment in favor of Plaintiffs at trial.    \n11  1.  The Legal Framework for Evaluating Title IX Effective Accommodation \nClaims. \n12 \nNearly thirty years before this suit was filed, Title IX was enacted to prohibit institutions that \n13 \nreceived federal financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of sex.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  \n14 \nTitle IX’s mandate applies to all educational programs and activities at institutions that receive \n15 \nfederal funds, including intercollegiate athletics.  20 U.S.C. § 1687.  Congress intended that it be \n16 \ninterpreted broadly in order to best achieve its purpose.  North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456 U.S. \n17 \n512, 521, 102 S. Ct. 1912 (1982); Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S. Ct. 1946 (1979).  \n18 \nA private right of action to enforce Title IX is well settled.  Cannon, 441 U.S. at 709. \n19 \nTitle IX was passed to address rampant sex discrimination in athletics.7  In order to assure the \n20 \n                                                 \n7 In 1971, over 3 million boys competed in interscholastic athletics in the United States.  \n21 \nMeanwhile, less than 300,000 girls had the opportunity to participate in interscholastic athletics.  \nThe high school athletic participation numbers are from the National Federation of High School \n22 \nAthletic Associations, which annually tracks high school participation in each state.  See \nhttp://www.nfhs.org/Participation/HistoricalSearch.aspx (use drop-down menu title “Year,” and \n23 \nselect “1971-72”) (last visited May 5, 2011).  The NCAA lobbied against Title IX at the collegiate \nlevel, despite the fact that in 1971 only 31,852 women participated in intercollegiate athletics as \n24 \ncompared to 172,447 men did so.  Similarly, women received only 2% of college athletic budgets in \n1971and virtually no athletic scholarships. The college athletic participation numbers are from the \n25 \nUnited States Department of Education publication, “Achieving Success Under Title IX,” \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/pubs/TitleIX/part5.html (last visited May 5, 2011).  For the scholarship \n26 \ninformation, see United States Department of Education publication, “The Secretary of Education’s \nCommission on Opportunity on Athletics: Open to All, Title IX at Thirty” (Feb. 28, 2003), found at \n27 \nhttp://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/athletics/title9report.pdf (last visited May 5, 2011). \n28 \n9\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Bd. of \n12  Trustees, 198 F.3d 763, 767 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, 998 F.2d \n13  168, 175 (3rd Cir. 1993)).  It has further recognized that “male athletes had been given an enormous \n14  head start in the race against their female counterparts for athletic resources, and Title IX would \n15  prompt universities to level the proverbial playing field.”  Neal, 198 F.3d at 767. \n16  The importance of quickly leveling that playing field is reflected in the Title IX athletics \n17  regulation’s mandate that elementary schools comply with their athletics obligations within one year \n18  of the effective date of the Title IX regulations (by July 1976) and that high schools and colleges \n19  “comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years \n20  from the effective date of this regulation” (by July 1978).  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(d).  Since then, the \n21  Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) of HEW (and then the Dep’t of Educ. (“DOE”)) has issued \n22  extensive guidance to help schools comply with the law.9  The 1975 OCR Guidance expressly \n23                                                   \n8 HEW published the original Title IX regulations at 45 C.F.R Part 86.  However, when \n24  Congress created the Department of Education, authority over education issues was transferred from \nHEW to DOE and the regulations were republished at 34 C.F.R. Part 106.  Dept. of Educ. \n25  Organization Act, Pub.L.No. 96-88, 93 Stat. 669 (1979), codified at 20 U.S.C. § 3401-3510. \n9 The Ninth Circuit has considered the Title IX regulations and OCR’s interpretations of \n26 \nthem and have given them substantial deference.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 965 (and citations \ntherein).  Plaintiffs, either jointly with Defendants or by separate request, seeks judicial notice of this \n27 \nguidance, which includes: \n28  (continued on next page) \n10\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Such participation claims are \n4  particularly important because having the opportunity to participate “lies at the core of Title IX’s \n5  purpose.”  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 897.  Courts recognize that Title IX’s affirmative obligations will in \n6  most cases “entail development of athletic programs that substantially expand opportunities for \n7  women to participate and compete at all levels.”  Williams, 998 F.2d at 176 (quoting 1979 Policy \n8  Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,414). \n9  The 1979 Policy Interpretation outlined several ways for determining whether a school \n10  provides such equal opportunity, including an analysis of  \n11  (1)  Whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students \nare provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments; or \n12 \n(2)   Where the members of one sex have been and are under-represented among \n13 \nintercollegiate athletes, whether the institution can show a history and continuing \npractice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing \n14 \ninterests and abilities of the members of that sex; or \n15 \n(3)  Where the members of the one sex are under-represented among intercollegiate \n16  athletes, and the institution cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion \nsuch as that cited above, whether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities \n17  of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the \npresent program. \n18 \n1979 Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71418.  This analysis is commonly referred to as the \n19 \n“Three Part Test.”  See, e.g., Neal, 193 F.3d 765.  Title IX’s intent requirement does not require a \n20 \ndiscriminatory animus.  A plaintiff need only establish that the institution made a decision to treat \n21 \nwomen differently in the provision of athletic opportunities.10   \n22 \n                                                 \n23  10 In other words, all that is required is that UCD behaved volitionally, as opposed to \naccidentally, with regard to its treatment of women athletes.  Pederson v. La. State Univ. (Pederson \n24  II), 213 F.3d 858, 881 (5th Cir. 2000) (university need not have intended to violate Title IX to be \nheld liable for damages).  Thus, a university’s “intentional decision not to accommodate effectively \n25  the interests of their female students by not providing sufficient athletic opportunities” is intentional \ndiscrimination in violation of Title IX.

UCD Did Not Comply With Title IX Through Prongs One or Three. \n1 \nUCD has stipulated, or otherwise agrees through undisputed facts, that it was not in \n2 \ncompliance with Prong One or Prong Three during the time period relevant to this case.   \n3 \nUndisputed participation and enrollment figures establish that UCD did not comply with \n4 \nTitle IX through Prong One.  This data proves that UCD did not provide women participation \n5 \nopportunities that were substantially proportionate to their enrollment for the period of 1995 to 2005.  \n6 \nIndeed, in 2001-2002, the year that UCD forced women to compete against men in wrestling, UCD’s \n7 \nfemale participation ratios fell to their worst level since 1997.  (UF ¶ 21 & Appendix A thereto; see \n8 \nalso Ex. B, hereto.)  When Defendants eliminated women’s wrestling, UCD would have needed to \n9 \nadd 156 varsity opportunities for women to make up for its proportionality shortfall.  (Id.)   \n10 \nUCD were also not in compliance with Prong Three.  UCD consistently failed to elevate \n11 \nnumerous club teams throughout its history.  (UF ¶¶ 23-25.)  Between 1995 and 2005, UCD rejected \n12 \napplications for varsity status from women club athletes in field hockey, badminton, rugby, horse \n13 \npolo, and bowling, thereby denying intercollegiate status to hundreds of interested women on \n14 \ncampus.  (Id.)  These facts reflect a flagrant disregard of women’s interest in intercollegiate athletics.   \n15 \nGiven Title IX’s passage some thirty years before Plaintiffs were UCD students, the law’s \n16 \naffirmative obligations, and its call for immediate compliance, UCD’s failings with respect to Prongs \n17 \nOne and Three are telling.  Moreover, as set forth below, UCD cannot establish Prong Two, a failing \n18 \non which this case against UCD will turn.   \n19 \n3.  UCD Cannot Prove Compliance with Prong Two of the Three Part Test.       \n20 \nUnder Part Two of the “Three Part Test,” Defendant has the burden of proving that it has a \n21 \nhistory and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the \n22 \ndeveloping interests and abilities of the members of the under-represented sex.  1979 Policy \n23 \nInterpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418; Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 830 (10th \n24 \nCir. 1993).  The 1996 Clarification makes clear that Part Two two requires an examination of both \n25 \n26                                                                                                                                                                     \n(Footnote continued from previous page) \n27 \nclassification of intercollegiate athletic teams on the basis of gender). \n28 \n13\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

The Ninth Circuit has emphasized that “[h]istory” and \n3  “continuing practice” constitute two separate inquiries.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 969.   In addition, \n4  an institution that eliminates existing opportunities without otherwise replacing and expanding \n5  opportunities cannot claim compliance under Prong Two.  1996 OCR Clarification at 7-8; see also \n6  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 971. \n7  Defendant cannot meet these burdens. \n8  i.  UCD Cannot Demonstrate a History of Program Expansion for \nWomen. \n9 \nIn addition to the foregoing legal framework, under “history of program expansion,” courts \n10 \nmust examine: \n11 \n(a)   an institution’s record of adding intercollegiate teams or upgrading teams to \n12  intercollegiate status; and \n13  (b)  an institution’s record of increasing the numbers of participants in intercollegiate \nathletics; and \n14 \n(c)  an institution’s affirmative responses to requests by students or others for addition or \n15 \nelevation of sports \n16  1996 Clarification at 7-8.   \n17  The Ninth Circuit has held that Prong Two focuses primarily on increasing the number of \n18  women’s athletic opportunities rather than increasing the number of women’s teams:  “‘OCR will \n19  assess whether past actions of the institution have expanded participation opportunities for the \n20  underrepresented sex …’ (emphasis added).”  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 969 (citing 1996 OCR \n21  Clarification at 5).  Moreover, Part Two must be read with Title IX’s immediate mandates in mind.  \n22  OCR did not intend schools to casually add new sports at sporadic and distant intervals.   Schools \n23  were required to add all sports for which interest and ability existed by 1978.  Thereafter, schools \n24  were required to add new sports for women as soon as their interests and abilities developed.  At \n25  UCD, those interests and abilities already existed and were never met.  Over its 30-year history, \n26  those interests have continued to develop, but as set forth herein, UCD has never “caught up” with \n27  its legal obligations.  No school has successfully defended an action by relying on Part Two.  \n28  Defendant Regents cannot do so here either. \n14\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 22 of 38\n \n1  will prove at trial.  The Court has rejected UCD’s effort to excise this portion of its discriminatory \n2  history from consideration in its Prong Two defense, finding that UCD’s entire history is relevant. \n3  As set forth below in greater deal, and recognized by the Ninth Circuit in its evaluation of \n4  undisputed participation and enrollment numbers, UCD’s one time expansion in 1995 did not come \n5  close to carry UCD’s burden of establishing a history of expansion.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 993.  \n6  One positive step is simply not enough claim a history of expansion, especially given a nine-year \n7  gap in expansion after the 1995 teams were added.   \n8  ii.  UCD Cannot Demonstrate a Continuing Practice of Program \nExpansion that Is Demonstrably Responsive to the Developing \n9  Interests of Its Female Students. \n10  Plaintiffs will also establish that UCD fell far short of Prong Two’s requirements after 1995 \n11  and thus had no continuing practice of expansion.  As the Ninth Circuit has made clear, the Court \n12  must evaluate both whether UCD had a continuing practice of expansion and if there was expansion, \n13  whether expansion was responsive to developing interests and abilities.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at \n14  969; 1996 OCR Clarification at 5-6.  UCD must satisfy both.  It fails on both fronts. \n15  Under “continuing practice of program expansion,” courts must examine  \n16  (a)  an institution’s current implementation of a nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for \nrequesting the addition of sports (including the elevation of club or intramural teams) \n17  and the effective communication of the policy or procedure to students and \n18 \n(b)  an institution’s current implementation of a plan of program expansion that is \nresponsive to developing interests and abilities \n19 \n1996 OCR Clarification at 2. \n20 \nUCD cannot claim a continuing practice of program expansion where Defendants failed to \n21 \nestablish a means by which existing club sport teams could request varsity status.  When Defendants \n22 \nfinally asked for proposals in 1995, five club sport teams presented proposals.  (UF ¶¶ 22-23.)  \n23 \nWhen Defendants were forced to ask for more proposals after the filing of this action, four more club \n24 \nteams submitted proposals.  (UF ¶ 24.)  Yet, Defendants rejected all of them and instead decided to \n25 \nadd women’s golf, a sport for which no club existed and which no female student requested.  (UF ¶ \n26 \n25.)  UCD’s athletic administration filled out the golf proposal itself.  (UF ¶ 24.)   \n27 \nAdditionally, UCD did not meet the requirement that an institution have a remedial plan in \n28 \n16\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 23 of 38\n \n1  place to expand women’s opportunities.  1996 OCR Clarification at 2.  UCD failed to create an \n2  expansion plan to meet the 1978 Title IX athletics deadline.  It failed to create an expansion plan \n3  during the 1980s or 1990s.  When UCD finally added three teams in 1995, it subsequently failed to \n4  institute a plan to add other female sports teams as a continuous practice.  Its failure to create \n5  concrete steps towards future compliance is especially notable here where its one-time expansion did \n6  not compensate for 25 years of non-expansion and did not bring UCD close to substantial \n7  proportionality.   \n8  After its one-time expansion, UCD engaged in roster management of men’s teams, which \n9  sole function is to contract men’s teams.  Yet, UCD’s roster management cannot be relied upon as \n10  evidence of program expansion for women in this case.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 971 (citing 1996 \n11  OCR Clarification).  Roster management efforts are thus irrelevant to Prong Two’s requirement of \n12  expansion for females. \n13  As a result of Defendants’ refusal to implement a plan for program expansion, the number of \n14  female participation opportunities fell 17% after 1999, even as the number of women enrolled at the \n15  university had grown by 19%.  (See Ex. B, hereto.)  UCD’s own expert called the drop “drastic.”  As \n16  noted by the Ninth Circuit:  “There were four varsity participation opportunities for every hundred \n17  female students in 2000, but only three in 2006.”  Id. at 970; see generally Ollier v. Sweetwater \n18  Union High Sch. Dist., 604 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1272-73 (S.D. Cal. 2009) (holding that a school did \n19  not comply with Prong Two where school experienced fluctuations up and down in their female \n20  participation numbers rather than continuous expansion and where school dropped 50 participation \n21  opportunities in the five years before suit was filed).  \n22  Plaintiffs will present the testimony of Donna Lopiano, a highly respected Title IX expert, so \n23  esteemed that UCD sought her advice when first faced with public outrage over its removal of \n24  women wrestlers.  Dr. Lopiano will offer importance guidance on Prong Two, including her opinion \n25  based on her many years of experience as a Title IX expert and applicable law, that while it is \n26  normal to see a fluctuation in participation opportunities of 4-7 athletes program-wide at an \n27  institution in any given year, these minimal fluctuations may be acceptable under Prong Two only if \n28  made up for immediately and expanded upon.  Both the volume drop in participation rates and its \n17\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 24 of 38\n \n1  continuous contraction disqualifies UCD from relying on Prong Two.   \n2  Based on participation and enrollment figures, the Ninth Circuit concluded that UCD \n3  eliminated women’s varsity athletic opportunities “in the context of a women’s athletics program \n4  that was, at best, stagnant.” Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 971.  This finding of the Ninth Circuit should \n5  be conclusive here and compel a finding that UCD violated Title IX.  See Thomas v. Bible, 983 F.2d \n6  152, 154 (9th Cir. 1993); Cohen v. Brown Univ. (Cohen III), 101 F.3d 155 (1st Cir. 1996). \n7  Finally, Defendants will be unable to prove that they expanded in a manner that was \n8  demonstrably responsive to developing interests and abilities.  For example, Plaintiffs will show that \n9  Defendants failed to survey students and prospective students for interest until after this case was \n10  filed.  Moreover, it is undisputed that UCD rejected numerous applications for varsity status from \n11  women club athletes between 1995 and 2005.  (UF ¶¶ 23-25.) \n12  In sum, UCD never caught up with the unmet athletic interests of its female students.  It \n13  never established a plan to continuously expand athletic opportunities to meet those interests.  And it \n14  never took steps to assess those interests (until after the filing of this action).  From 1995 to 2005, \n15  UCD entirely failed to expand women’s opportunities.  To the contrary, they reduced opportunities \n16  in existing sports and eliminated women’s wrestling.   \n17  4.  UCD Cannot Rely on Prong Two Where It Reduced Women’s Athletic \nParticipation Opportunities and Eliminated All Women’s Opportunities \n18  in Wrestling.   \n19  In the early 2000’s, Defendants eliminated all women’s opportunities in the sport of \n20  wrestling and eliminated women’s athletic opportunities in other sports, resulting in an overall \n21  decline in women’s athletic participation opportunities of over 60 athletes.  (See Ex. B.)   \n22  That Defendants’ actions deprived Plaintiffs and other women female participation \n23  opportunities in intercollegiate wrestling will be established at trial.  To refute this, UCD will likely \n24  suggest a wide variety of erroneous arguments.   \n25  For example, UCD may claim that Plaintiffs must prove its elimination of a separate \n26  women’s team or a woman’s program in order to prevail on Title IX liability.  However, as this \n27  Court has found, UCD’s compliance with Title IX must be assessed on a program-wide basis and is \n28  not dependent on the actions taken with respect to wrestling specifically.  (Dkt. 549.)   \n18\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 25 of 38\n \n1  To the extent Defendants assert Plaintiffs lacked standing or injury, Plaintiffs need only be \n2  students interested in intercollegiate participation opportunities to be affected by UCD’s Title IX \n3  violation.11  Pederson II, 213 F.3d at 869-71 (finding that a student need only show “that she is able \n4  and ready to complete for a position on an unfielded team” to establish injury).  The evidence will \n5  establish that Plaintiffs Ng, Mansourian, and Mancuso meet that standard. \n6  Although not necessary, Plaintiffs have already established much more than mere interest in \n7  intercollegiate athletic opportunities.  (UF ¶¶ 23-25.)  For nearly 9 years, UCD offered women \n8  students the opportunity to participate in varsity wrestling.  (UF ¶¶ 27-41.)  In the early 2000’s, \n9  Defendants eliminated varsity women’s wrestling opportunities in their entirely.  (UF ¶ 43.)  As \n10  noted by the Ninth Circuit:  “By requiring women to prevail against men, the university changed the \n11  conditions under which women could participate in varsity wrestling in a manner that foreseeably \n12  precluded their future participation.”  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 970 n.18.  Defendants have failed and \n13  refused to add or reinstate women’s wrestling despite demands that they do so.   \n14  Because Defendants eliminated a women’s sport shortly before this action was filed, they \n15  cannot rely on prong two of the Three-Part Test.  See Barrett v. West Chester Univ. of Pa., 2003 WL \n16  22803477, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2003) (elimination of women’s gymnastic team was evidence of \n17  violation of Title IX and non-compliance with Prong Two where institution was not otherwise in \n18  compliance with Title IX); Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 897-98 (elimination women’s volleyball and \n19  gymnastic teams was evidence of violation of Title IX and non-compliance with Prong Two); \n20  Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830 (elimination of women’s softball team was evidence of violation of Title IX \n21  and non-compliance with Prong Two.)   \n22  Defendants apparently realize this, because they now claim that they didn’t “really” offer \n23  women’s wrestling opportunities or that the women who participated were somehow not worthy of \n24  varsity status.  Defendants’ rewriting of history fails on many levels because (1) the women \n25 \n                                                 \n26  11 Plaintiffs anticipate that Defendants will also argue they must prove evidence of interest, \nability, and competition in wrestling.  Plaintiffs have filed a motion in limine that seeks to exclude \n27  this evidence and argument related to interest, ability, and competition in women’s wrestling as a \nmisrepresentation of the applicable standing standard.   \n28 \n19\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 26 of 38\n \n1  wrestlers met the definition of varsity participants for purposes of Title IX, (2) the women wrestlers \n2  participated in varsity wrestling to the same extent as most of the male varsity wrestlers, and (3) the \n3  women wrestlers participated in varsity wrestling to the same extent as athletes whom Defendants \n4  count as varsity in other sports.  (UF ¶¶ 30-41.)  They were no different than the varsity female crew \n5  members, lacrosse players, or swimmers who practiced alongside their male counterparts (even if \n6  they were not in the top tier who actually competed in matches) and who received the same benefits \n7  and coaching as their male counterparts, but who also competed only against other women.  \n8  The 1979 Policy Interpretation identifies those students who qualify as varsity athletes by \n9  defining the “participants” as those \n10  a.  Who are receiving the institutionally-sponsored support normally provided to athletes \ncompeting at the institution involved, e.g., coaching, equipment, medical and training \n11  room services, on a regular basis during a sport’s season; and \n12 \nb.  Who are participating in organized practice sessions and other team meetings and \nactivities on a regular basis during a sport’s season; and \n13 \nc.  Who are listed on the eligibility or squad lists maintained for each sport; or \n14 \n15  d.  Who, because of injury, cannot meet a, b, or c above but continue to receive financial \naid on the basis of athletic ability. \n16 \n1979 Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71415. \n17 \nThe 1996 OCR Clarification further expounds on this definition by stating that participants \n18 \nalso include: \n19 \n(1)  those athletes who do not receive scholarships (e.g., walk-ons); \n20 \n(2)  those athletes who compete on teams sponsored by the institution even though the \n21 \nteam may be required to raise some or all of its operating funds; and \n22 \n(3)  those athletes who practice but may not compete. \n23 \n1996 OCR Clarification at 4. \n24 \nThe women wrestlers who participated in UCD’s women’s wrestling program easily fall \n25 \nwithin this definition.  They received varsity coaching, attended practices, received varsity benefits \n26 \nand access to varsity facilities and services.  (UF ¶¶ 27-41.)  They were subject to the same rules as \n27 \nother varsity athletes.  (See id.)  They were included on official team lists and counted on EADA \n28 \n20\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Notably, the 1996 OCR Clarification definition includes athletes \n2  who are walk-ons and those who do not complete.12  This definition is entirely consistent, as \n3  Plaintiffs will establish at trial, with the manner in which UCD counts all of its other varsity athletes.  \n4  Various UCD witnesses acknowledge that there are students of varying skills on men and women’s \n5  teams.  Its mockery now of Plaintiffs’ skill level is suspect, where there is no indication that UCD \n6  evaluated the skill level of other females in its intercollegiate program.  UCD’s selective critique of \n7  Plaintiffs’ abilities is nothing more than a blatant degradation of Plaintiffs and a post ad hoc \n8  justification for removing women from the program, and a discriminatory one at that.   \n9  Accordingly, because Defendants contracts its opportunities for women, including the \n10  complete elimination of varsity women’s wrestling, Defendants cannot claim Prong Two \n11  compliance. \n12  B.  Plaintiffs Will Prevail on Their Equal Protection Claim.    \n13  Plaintiffs will present evidence at trial establishing that Defendants Vanderhoef, Franks, \n14  Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher (the “Individual Defendants”) violated Plaintiffs’ equal protection rights \n15  by denying them the opportunity to wrestle on the basis of their gender at a time when they were \n16  also failing to provide equal athletic opportunities program-wide.  This evidence will demonstrate \n17  that Defendants engaged in this facially apparent and systemic discrimination for decades and that \n18  this discrimination harmed Plaintiffs throughout their years at UCD.  \n19  To prevail at trial, Plaintiffs must show that Individual Defendants intentionally created a \n20  classification based on sex.  This burden is easily satisfied:  the Individual Defendants stripped \n21  Plaintiffs of their varsity status based on gender and continued to deny them varsity wrestling \n22  opportunities all the while depriving equal participation opportunities for women program-wide.  \n23  The only way the Individual Defendants would be able to defeat Plaintiffs’ claim is to prove an \n24  exceedingly persuasive justification for this sex-based classification, that the classification serves an \n                                                 \n25 \n12Additionally, both Plaintiffs’ and Defendants’ experts agree that that it is acceptable for \nvarsity athletes in a developing sport to obtain competition in open or amateur events.  In a another \n26 \ncase, UCD’s expert testified that “it was good for student athletes to compete in championship meets \nno matter who sponsored them, or how prestigious they might be, and that whether or not it was the \n27 \nNCAA that sponsored them should not be a factor.”  Favia, 812 F. Supp. at 582. \n28 \n21\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

The Individual Defendants will not be able to meet this burden.13  The record will \n3  compel a finding of liability as to each Individual Defendant. \n4  1.  The Legal Framework for Equal Protection Claims. \n5  The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \n6  states that \n7  No state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection \nof the law. \n8 \nU.S. Const. amend, XIV, § 1. \n9 \nThis Clause is enforced through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which states:   \n10 \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, \n11  or usage of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or \ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within \n12  the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or \nimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party \n13 \ninjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for \nredress. \n14 \nThis is “essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.” City of \n15 \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S. Ct. 3249 (1985).   \n16 \nThe Equal Protection Clause applies whenever a state actor discriminates on the basis of sex \n17 \nor otherwise treats males differently from females.  The standard of liability for Plaintiffs’ Equal \n18 \nProtection Claim is set forth in Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases that addressed schools’ \n19 \nunwillingness to provide certain types of educational programs to one sex and other forms of sex \n20 \ndiscrimination in education.  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33, 116 S. Ct. 2264 (1996) \n21 \n(women denied access to all-male military educational program); Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, \n22 \n458 U.S. 718, 724, 102 S. Ct. 3331 (1982) (male denied access to all-female nursing program); Oona \n23 \nv. McCaffrey, 143 F.3d 473, 474-75 (9th Cir. 1998) (peer sexual harassment in schools).   \n24 \nIndeed, the law is well-established in the area of school athletics.  Where a university decides \n25 \n26 \n                                                 \n13 Individual Defendants may also attempt to argue that they are entitled to qualified \n27 \nimmunity.  The Court has, however, already conclusively resolved this issue.  (Dkt. 509.) \n28 \n22\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 29 of 38\n \n1  “to sponsor intercollegiate athletics as part of its educational offerings, this program ‘must be made \n2  available to all on equal terms.’” Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 974 (quoting Haffer v. Temple Univ., 678 \n3  F. Supp. 517, 525 (E.D. Pa. 1998)).  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that not only must “overall \n4  athletic opportunities … be equal” to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause, but that “denial of an \n5  opportunity in a specific sport, even when overall opportunities are equal, can be a violation of the \n6  equal protection clause.” Clark v. Ariz. Interscholastic Ass’n, 695 F.2d 1126, 1130-31 (9th Cir. \n7  1982); see Hoover v. Meiklejohn, 430 F. Supp. 164, 170 (D. Colo. 1977) (noting that the standard \n8  under the Equal Protection Clause “should be one of comparability, not absolute equality,” where \n9  male and female teams are given “substantially equal support” for “substantially comparable \n10  programs”); Leffel v. Wis. Interscholastic Athletic Ass’n, 444 F. Supp. 1117, 1122 (E.D. Wis. 1978) \n11  (“the defendants may not afford an educational opportunity to boys that is denied to girls”).  The \n12  availability of this constitutional claim to challenge gender-based decisions in high school and \n13  college athletics is also well-settled.  See, e.g., Haffer, 678 F. Supp. at 526-27 (and cases cited \n14  therein); Brenden v. Indep. Sch. Dist., 477 F.2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1973) (striking regulation barring girls \n15  from competing against boys in certain sports); Cmtys. for Equity, 459 F.3d at 693-95 (affirming \n16  district court judgment for Plaintiffs on Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection and Title IX claims challenging \n17  high school athletic association’s decision to change scheduling of female athletes seasons); Alston \n18  v. Va. High Sch. League, Inc., 144 F. Supp. 2d 526, 533-34, 538 (W.D. Va. 1999) (denying \n19  defendants’ motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ section 1983 claims in case involving \n20  schedule change for women’s teams but not men’s teams.)   \n21  In fact, the Ninth Circuit and other circuits have repeatedly affirmed that there is an \n22  important government interest in promoting equality of opportunity and in redressing past \n23  discrimination against women in athletics, even if this means decreasing opportunities for men.   \n24  Clark, 695 F.2d at 1131 (holding that the policy of excluding boys from a girls high school \n25  volleyball team did not violate the Equal Protection clause because it was a permissible means of \n26  attempting to promote equality of opportunity for girls in Arizona interscholastic sports and \n27  redressing past discrimination; noting in dicta that boys would have an “undue advantage” if allowed \n28  to compete against women for positions on the volleyball team); Neal, 198 F.3d at 769-72 (rejecting \n23\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Wrestling Club v. Miami Univ., 302 F.3d 608  (6th Cir. \n3  2002) (holding that men’s rights not violated when institution eliminates a male team to achieve \n4  gender equity in compliance with Title IX). \n5  Under this standard, Defendants must prove that their different treatment of males and \n6  females “serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \n7  substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”  In addition, Defendants’ reasons for \n8  their sex discrimination must be “exceedingly persuasive.”  Miss. Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 724.  \n9  Defendants cannot meet this burden. \n10  2.  The Individual Defendants Violated Plaintiffs’ Constitutional Right to Be \nFree from Sex Discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. \n11 \ni.  Defendants’ Policies Were Facially Discriminatory. \n12 \nDefendants Vanderhoef, Franks Warzecka, and Gill-Fisher were high-ranking UCD officials \n13 \nresponsible for UCD’s athletic program who are/were state actors who acted under color of law for \n14 \nall purposes relevant to this action.  (UF ¶¶ 10-13.)  Accordingly, they are subject to liability under \n15 \nthis statute for their violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Plaintiffs will readily meet their initial \n16 \nburden at trial to establish that the Individual Defendants intentionally created a sex-based \n17 \nclassification that deprived them of equal protection.  The Individual Defendants’ discriminatory \n18 \npolicy is facially apparent in its disparate allocation of athletic opportunities (as reported by UCD to \n19 \nthe Department of Education) and in its refusal to provide opportunities for women in wrestling.  \n20 \nThis policy deprived Plaintiffs and other women an equal opportunity to participate in athletics, \n21 \nincluding in wrestling.   \n22 \nSpecifically, the Individual Defendants lawfully segregated students in to male and female \n23 \nathletic teams because of their inherent biological differences, but they then unlawfully allocate \n24 \nthose opportunities in favor of males.  The Individual Defendants themselves decided which sports \n25 \nUCD would offer to the members of which sex (i.e., men’s basketball and women’s basketball).  The \n26 \nIndividual Defendants then dictated the number of opportunities in each sport.  Their decision to \n27 \nallot women fewer of those sports opportunities constitutes facial discrimination.  A university must \n28 \n24\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 31 of 38\n \n1  make its athletic program available to all on equal terms.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 974 (quoting \n2  Haffer, 678 F. Supp. at 525).  Haffer v. Temple University, supra, is directly on point. The court \n3  there denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment on an equal protection claim brought by \n4  female students who alleged that defendants offered men more intercollegiate athletic opportunities \n5  than female opportunities proportionate to enrollment, and thus deprived women of an equal \n6  opportunity to participate.  678 F. Supp. at 523. \n7  Plaintiffs will establish the extension of this discriminatory policy to Plaintiffs and other \n8  women wrestlers.  The Individual Defendants removed women from the roster based on their gender \n9  in 2000 without justifying this decision, as they must.  Although the Individual Defendants may \n10  attempt to convince this Court that Plaintiffs’ removal were the result of the actions of a rogue \n11  coach, there is no dispute that the Individual Defendants knew the women were removed, ratified \n12  that decision, and then continued to deny Plaintiffs the opportunity to wrestle by, among other \n13  things, imposing the newly concocted requirement that women must wrestle men for a varsity spot.  \n14  The Ninth Circuit concluded that this requirement necessarily precluded the future participation of \n15  women in varsity wrestling.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 970 n.18.  UCD continued to deprive \n16  Plaintiffs of wrestling opportunities, as women competing against women, through their graduation \n17  and the filing of this suit. \n18  While Defendants offer the same opportunities to males and females (e.g., men’s and \n19  women’s basketball, men’s and women’s tennis, men’s and women’s swimming, men’s and \n20  women’s water polo), they have failed and refused to offer women the opportunity to participate in \n21  wrestling at a time when they were not ensuring equity program-wide.  This decision constitutes sex \n22  discrimination on its face.  The Ninth Circuit has recognized that not only must “overall athletic \n23  opportunities … be equal” to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause, but that “denial of an opportunity \n24  in a specific sport, even when overall opportunities are equal, can be a violation of the equal \n25  protection clause.”  Clark, 695 F.2d at 1130-31.   \n26  ii.  The Individual Defendants Were Responsible for Creating and \nMaintaining Discriminatory Policies. \n27 \nBecause Defendants operate a sex segregated and facially discriminatory athletic program, \n28 \n25\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 561    Filed 05/05/11   Page 32 of 38\n \n1  they are liable for their disparate treatment of the men’s and women’s programs (i.e., the disparate \n2  allocation of opportunities) if they cannot carry their burden of proof on the reasons for their \n3  discrimination.  Plaintiffs do not have to show malicious or nefarious intent by the Individual \n4  Defendants in order to prevail.  They only have to show that the Individual Defendants were those \n5  who made or ratified the facially discriminatory decisions that created the facially discriminatory \n6  athletic program.  al-Kidd v. Ashcroft, 580 F.3d 949, 965 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting Kwai Fun Wong v. \n7  United States, 373 F.3d 952, 966 (9th Cir. 2004)).   \n8  The Individual Defendants are responsible for this discrimination because they either made \n9  the discriminatory decisions themselves (Defendants Warzecka and Gill-Fisher) or they ratified them \n10  (Defendants Franks and Vanderhoef).  Defendants have already admitted that all of the Individual \n11  Defendants have the delegated authority to make decisions relating to the UCD athletic department.  \n12  (See UF ¶¶ 10-13.)  Those were the daily responsibilities of Defendants Warzecka and Gill-Fisher.  \n13  (UF ¶¶ 12-13.)  Defendants have also admitted that Defendants Vanderhoef and Franks had direct \n14  control and supervision over the athletic department.  (UF ¶¶ 10-11.)  In this case, Plaintiffs ask the \n15  Court to hold them liable for their direct participation in the discriminatory decisions, for their \n16  ratification of those decisions, and for their refusal to use their authority to reverse those decisions \n17  despite repeated requests that they do so. \n18  iii.  The Individual Defendants Offer No Justification for Their \nDiscrimination, Much Less an Exceedingly Persuasive One. \n19 \nFinally, the Individual Defendants have not offered a justification for their failure to ensure \n20 \nthat women have equal opportunities to participate in intercollegiate athletics, or their exclusion of \n21 \nwomen from the wrestling program.  Nor do they contend that the elimination of the women’s \n22 \nintercollegiate wrestling opportunities at UCD served an important governmental objective.  \n23 \nSimilarly, Defendants have failed to show that these discriminatory practices are substantially \n24 \nrelated to any purportedly important government objectives.  Indeed, the Individual Defendants \n25 \ncannot justify the elimination of female wrestling opportunities where they were eliminating (rather \n26 \nthan adding) female opportunities elsewhere in the program.  \n27 \n28 \n26\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

The Individual Defendants Cannot Establish Qualified Immunity From \n1 \nSuit. \n2 \nTo the extent that the Individual Defendants intend to raise the defense of qualified immunity \n3 \nat trial, they will not be able to meet their burden of proof.  This is especially true in light of the \n4 \nCourt’s prior rulings on this issue:  “Determining whether officials are owed qualified immunity \n5 \ninvolves two inquiries: (1) whether, taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, \n6 \nthe facts alleged show the officer's conduct violated a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the \n7 \nright was clearly established in light of the specific context of the case.”  al-Kidd, 580 F.3d at 964 \n8 \n(citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001)). \n9 \nIn its ruling on the qualified immunity defense raised in the Individual Defendants’ motion \n10 \nfor summary judgment, this Court held:    \n11  At the time of the alleged discriminatory conduct in this case, the law, as set \nforth by the United States Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit, was clear that \n12 \nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment creates the right to \nbe free from purposeful discrimination in education by state actors. \n13 \nMississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 731; Oona, R.S., 143 F.3d at 476 \n14  (holding that it was clearly established well prior to 1988 that the Equal \nProtection clause proscribed any purposeful discrimination by state actors on \n15  the basis of gender).  More specifically, as early as 1982, the Ninth Circuit \nrecognized that the Equal Protection Clause may be violated when overall \n16 \nathletic opportunities are unequal as well as when there is inequality in \nopportunity in a given sport.  Clark, 695 F.2d at 1130-31 (acknowledging the \n17 \nEqual Protection right, but holding that the discrimination in favor of an all \n18  girls volleyball team was substantially related to an important governmental \ninterest).   \n19 \n(Dkt. 509 at 32:25-33:12.) \n20 \nThese legal findings will be determinative at trial.  The Court’s holding that Plaintiffs alleged \n21 \na constitutional right that was clearly established precludes the Individual Defendants from relying \n22 \non the qualified immunity defense at trial.   \n23 \n/// \n24 \n/// \n25 \n/// \n26 \n/// \n27 \n/// \n28 \n27\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ TRIAL BRIEF; CASE NO.

Plaintiffs oppose\n24 defendants’ motion.  The court heard oral argument on the motion\n25 on July 27, 2007 and allowed the parties to submit supplemental\n26 briefing addressing new arguments raised at the hearing.  Based\n27 upon the submissions of the parties and the arguments made by\n28 counsel, and for the reasons set forth below, defendants’ motion \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 2 of 44\n1 for judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED in part and DENIED in\n2 part.\n3 BACKGROUND1\n4 Plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian (“Mansourian”), Lauren Mancuso\n5 (“Mancuso”), and Christine Wing-Si Ng (“Ng”) (collectively\n6 “plaintiffs”)2 are former female wrestlers at the University of\n7 California, Davis (“UCD”).  (Pls.’ Compl. [Docket #1] \n8 (“Compl.”), filed Dec. 18, 2003, at 5-7.)  Plaintiffs filed this\n9 action on behalf of themselves and a putative class on December\n10 18, 2003.  Plaintiffs named as defendants in their individual and\n11 official capacities the following parties: the Regents of the\n12 University of California (“UCD”); the Chancellor of the\n13 University, Larry Vanderhoef; the Athletic Director at the\n14 University, Greg Warzecka; Associate Athletic Directors of the\n15 University, Pam Gill-Fisher and Lawrence Swanson; and former\n16 Associate Vice Chancellor, Student Affairs, Robert Franks\n17 (collectively, the “individual defendants”).  (Compl. at 2.) \n18 In the 1990s, varsity wrestling at UCD included both women\n19 and men.  (Id. at ¶ 82.)  Female wrestlers at UCD received high\n20 quality coaching, wrestled under women’s freestyle rules rather\n21 than men’s collegiate rules, and received the various benefits of\n22 varsity status.  (Id. at ¶¶ 82, 85.)  Some of UCD’s female\n23 wrestlers went on to national and international acclaim after\n24 having trained at and received the benefits of wrestling at UCD. \n25\n1 The following facts are primarily derived from\n26 plaintiffs’ complaint filed December 18, 2003.\n27 2 Plaintiff Nancy Nien-Li Chiang (“Chiang”) voluntarily\ndismissed all claims in this action on June 12, 2007.  (Mem. &\n28 Order [Docket #195], filed July 12, 2007).\n2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 3 of 44\n1 (Id. at ¶¶ 85-87.)  \n2 Plaintiffs participated in high school wrestling and chose\n3 to attend UCD because it offered them the opportunity to\n4 participate in wrestling while in college.  (Compl., ¶¶ 9-11, 24-\n5 51.)  Mansourian and Ng filled out the NCAA and UCD paperwork\n6 necessary for intercollegiate athletics, completed the weight\n7 certification requirements for intercollegiate wrestling, and\n8 participated in UCD’s wrestling program for about 2 years.  (Id.\n9 at ¶¶ 27-30, 46-50, 55-59.)  As varsity wrestlers, plaintiffs\n10 received benefits such as medical and athletic training services,\n11 laundry services, academic tutoring services, strength and\n12 conditioning coaching, wrestling coaching, insurance, access to\n13 the weight room, and access to varsity facilities.  (Id. at ¶¶\n14 33, 51, 58.)  Mancuso was recruited to wrestle for UCD and\n15 awarded an athletic scholarship.  (Id. ¶ 39.)  She enrolled,\n16 filled out the necessary paperwork, and received the required\n17 certifications to participate in intercollegiate wrestling.  (Id.\n18 at ¶¶ 40-42.)  Shortly thereafter, however, defendants eliminated\n19 women from UCD’s wrestling program, and Mancuso was denied her\n20 scholarship.  (Id. at ¶¶ 59-60.)\n21 During the 2000-2001 academic year, defendants eliminated\n22 wrestling athletic participation opportunities for female, but\n23 not male, students (the “No Females Directive”).  (Id. at ¶¶ 60-\n24 62.)  Plaintiffs and then-wrestling coach Michael Burch protested\n25 this decision.  Plaintiffs met with and/or complained to\n26 defendants, asserting that the No Females Directive constituted\n27 illegal sex discrimination.  Defendants ignored the complaints.\n28 (Id. at ¶¶ 63-69.)  Plaintiffs filed a complaint with the Office\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 4 of 44\n1 for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education\n2 (“OCR”) in the Spring of 2001.  (Id. at ¶ 67.)  Defendants later\n3 agreed to rescind the No Females Directive and to allow women to\n4 participate in wrestling.  (Id. at ¶ 70-74.)\n5 Plaintiffs, including newcomer Mancuso, enrolled at UCD for\n6 the 2001-2002 academic year in reliance upon defendants’ promised\n7 reinstatement of female wrestling participation opportunities. \n8 They filled out their NCAA and UCD eligibility paperwork,\n9 completed the weight certification requirements for varsity\n10 wrestling, and were deemed eligible.  (Id. at ¶ 75.) \n11 Unfortunately, plaintiffs returned to a wrestling team with a new\n12 coach who did not support women wrestlers and failed to coach\n13 them or treat them like the male wrestlers.  (Id. at ¶¶ 75-76.) \n14 Defendants informed plaintiffs that to participate in wrestling\n15 they would have to be part of a mixed gender team and would have\n16 to beat the men at their weight class under men’s collegiate-\n17 style rules, even though the women had previously only\n18 participated as part of a women’s wrestling program (not a mixed\n19 gender team) using international freestyle wrestling rules.  (Id.\n20 at ¶ 77.)  Plaintiffs again complained, but defendants refused\n21 and continue to refuse to remedy the situation and to provide\n22 women’s wrestling opportunities.  (Id. at ¶¶ 75-79.)  As a\n23 result, to date, no women are allowed to participate in UCD\n24 wrestling.  (Id.)\n25 As a result of defendants’ actions, plaintiffs could not\n26 attend wrestling practice, could not use the wrestling facilities\n27 or weight room, lost their laundry benefits, lost their insurance\n28 they received as wrestling athletes, were banned from receiving\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 5 of 44\n1 instruction from the UCD coaching staff, and were denied athletic\n2 training and other medical benefits they received as UCD\n3 wrestlers.  (Id. at ¶ 61.)  Plaintiffs also lost the academic\n4 credit associated with UCD wrestling athletes, and were denied\n5 early class registration.  (Id. at ¶ 62.)  \n6 Subsequently, plaintiffs brought this action and alleged six\n7 claims for relief: (1) violation of Title IX for failure to\n8 provide equal athletic opportunities for women; (2) violation of\n9 Title IX for failure to provide equal athletic financial\n10 assistance to women; (3) retaliation in violation of Title IX;\n11 (4) violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on the Equal Protection\n12 clause of the U.S. Constitution; (5) violation of the California\n13 Unruh Civil Rights Act; (6) violation of public policy based upon\n14 violations of the California Constitution and the California\n15 Education Code.  (Id. at 35-53).  Defendants filed a motion to\n16 dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on\n17 March 5, 2004.  (Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss [Docket #13-15], filed\n18 March 5, 2004.)  The court denied the motion on May 6, 2004. \n19 (Mem. & Order [Docket #25], filed May 6, 2007.)  \n20 Unfortunately, throughout the course of this litigation,\n21 both defendants’ and plaintiffs’ counsel have suffered illnesses. \n22 In October 2005, both parties stipulated to an extension of\n23 deadlines due to defendants’ lead counsel’s illness, which made\n24 her unavailable to travel to depositions over the following two\n25 months.  (Stipulation [Docket #57], filed Oct. 28, 2005.)  On\n26 April 14, 2006, one week before plaintiffs’ motion for class\n27 certification was to be heard by the court, plaintiffs’ counsel\n28 filed an ex parte motion to stay and extend scheduling based upon\n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 6 of 44\n1 plaintiffs’ counsel’s serious health issues.  (Ex Parte Mot. to\n2 Stay [Docket #117], filed Apr. 14, 2006.)  The court granted\n3 plaintiffs’ motion, and thereafter, on June 6, 2006, the parties\n4 stipulated to extend the stay and related scheduling matters.  \n5 (Order [Docket #125], filed Apr. 18, 2006; Stipulation to Extend\n6 Stay and Related Scheduling Matters [Docket #130], filed June 6,\n7 2006.)  On July 21, 2006, plaintiffs moved to extend the stay in\n8 order to find new counsel because of plaintiffs’ counsel’s\n9 serious medical condition, which the court granted.  (Motion to\n10 Extend [Docket #134], filed July 21, 2006; Order [Docket #137],\n11 filed July 24, 2006.)  On August 18, 2006, Monique Oliver filed a\n12 notice of appearance on behalf of plaintiffs.  (Docket #140,\n13 filed Aug. 18, 2006.)  On August 23, 2006, and October 19, 2006,\n14 the parties stipulated to extend the stay based upon the\n15 appearance of new counsel in this matter.  (Docket #141, 147.)\n16 On February 2, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the\n17 complaint to add new plaintiffs, who would also be class\n18 representatives, and related allegations.  (Pls.’ Mot. to Amend\n19 [Docket #158], filed Feb. 2, 2007.)  The court denied plaintiffs’\n20 motion.  (Mem. & Order [Docket #175], filed Mar. 20, 2007.) \n21 Subsequently, by stipulation of both parties, the class claims in\n22 this action were dismissed on June 12, 2007.  (Mem. & Order\n23 [Docket #195], filed June 12, 2007.)  Defendants filed the\n24 instant motion on June 5, 2007.  (Docket #188.)  At oral\n25 argument, plaintiffs’ counsel conceded that plaintiffs no longer\n26 seek injunctive relief.  However, plaintiffs do claim that they\n27 are entitled to monetary and punitive damages for defendants’\n28 denial of educational benefits, lost scholarship money, and the\n6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 7 of 44\n1 humiliation, emotional distress, and related harm caused by\n2 defendants’ sex discrimination.  (Id. at 55-56.)  \n3 STANDARD\n4 Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides,\n5 in relevant part, that “[a]fter the pleadings are closed but\n6 within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move\n7 for judgment on the pleadings.”  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(c). \n8 Moreover, Rule 12(h)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\n9 provides in relevant part that a defense of failure to state a\n10 claim upon which relief can be granted, may be made by motion for\n11 judgment on the pleadings.  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(h).\n12 When considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings\n13 presenting a defense of failure to state a claim upon which\n14 relief can be granted, a court should employ those standards\n15 normally applicable to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n16 claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\n17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Enron Oil Trading &\n18 Transp. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., Ltd., 132 F.3d 526, 528-29 (9th\n19 Cir. 1997); 5B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,\n20 Civil § 1368 at 515-16 (3d ed. 2007).  On a motion to dismiss,\n21 the allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true.  Cruz\n22 v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 (1972).  The court is bound to give\n23 plaintiff the benefit of every reasonable inference to be drawn\n24 from the “well-pleaded” allegations of the complaint.  Retail\n25 Clerks Int’l Ass’n v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746, 753 n.6 (1963). \n26 Thus, the plaintiff need not necessarily plead a particular fact\n27 if that fact is a reasonable inference from facts properly\n28 alleged.  See id.  \n7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 8 of 44\n1 Nevertheless, it is inappropriate to assume that the\n2 plaintiff “can prove facts which it has not alleged or that the\n3 defendants have violated the . . . laws in ways that have not\n4 been alleged.”  Associated Gen. Contractors of Calif., Inc. v.\n5 Calif. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 526 (1983). \n6 Moreover, the court “need not assume the truth of legal\n7 conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations.”  United\n8 States ex rel. Chunie v. Ringrose, 788 F.2d 638, 643 n.2 (9th\n9 Cir. 1986).\n10 Ultimately, the court may not dismiss a complaint in which\n11 the plaintiff has alleged “enough facts to state a claim to\n12 relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\n13 Twombly, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974 (2007).  Only where a plaintiff has\n14 not “nudged [his or her] claims across the line from conceivable\n15 to plausible,” is the complaint properly dismissed.  Id.  “[A]\n16 court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief\n17 could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved\n18 consistent with the allegations.”  Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,\n19 534 U.S. 506, 514 (2002) (quoting Hudson v. King & Spalding, 467\n20 U.S. 69, 73 (1984)). \n21 In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the court may consider\n22 only the complaint, any exhibits thereto, and matters which may\n23 be judicially noticed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201. \n24 See Mir v. Little Co. Of Mary Hospital, 844 F.2d 646, 649 (9th\n25 Cir. 1988); Isuzu Motors Ltd. v. Consumers Union of United\n26 States, Inc., 12 F. Supp. 2d 1035, 1042 (C.D. Cal. 1998).\n27 /////\n28 /////\n8\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 9 of 44\n1 ANALYSIS\n2 I. Title IX\n3 Alleged violations of Title IX in the area of athletics are\n4 typically divided into claims of either equal treatment or\n5 effective accommodation.  Pederson v. Louisiana State Univ., 213\n6 F.3d 858, 865 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000).  This division arises from\n7 regulations promulgated by Title IX.  Id.  Claims under an equal\n8 treatment theory “derive from the Title IX regulations found at\n9 34 C.F.R. §§ 106.37(c) 106.41(c)(2)-(10), which call for equal\n10 provision of [] athletic benefits and opportunities among the\n11 sexes.”  Boucher v. Syracuse Univ., 164 F.3d 113, 115 n.2 (2d\n12 Cir. 1999).  Claims brought under an effective accommodation\n13 theory stem from the implementing regulations that provide:\n14 in determining whether equal athletic opportunities for\nmembers of both sexes are available, the Office of\n15 Civil Rights of the Department of Education (the office\ncharged with enforcement of Title IX) will consider,\n16 among other factors, “[w]hether the selection of sports\nand levels of competition effectively accommodate the\n17 interests and abilities of members of both sexes.”\n18 Pederson, 213 F.3d at 865 n.4 (citing Boucher, 164 F.3d at 115\n19 n.1; 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1)).\n20 As clarified by both arguments made at hearing and the\n21 supplemental submissions of the parties, plaintiffs are asserting\n22 claims against defendant UCD under both an unequal treatment\n23 theory and an ineffective accommodation theory.  Defendant UCD\n24 moves for judgment on the pleadings as to both theories.\n25 A. Unequal Treatment Claims   \n26 Pursuant to an “unequal treatment” theory, plaintiffs seek\n27 damages arising out of the No Females Directive issued in the\n28 fall of 2000; an alleged broken promise in June 2001 to reinstate\n9\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 10 of 44\n1 the female wrestling program at UCD; the failure to renew the\n2 contract of their wrestling coach; and requiring females to\n3 compete for membership on the UCD wrestling team under the same\n4 terms and conditions as male athletes in the fall of 2001. \n5 Plaintiffs contend that these were discriminatory acts made by\n6 defendant pursuant to a “policy and practice” of discrimination,\n7 and as such, these allegations establish a “continuing violation”\n8 of federal law.  (Pl.’s Opp’n, filed July 13, 2007, at 5.) \n9 Conversely, defendant asserts that plaintiffs merely allege a\n10 series of discrete acts.  (Def.’s Reply to Pl.’s Opp’n (“Reply”),\n11 filed July 20, 2007, at 4-6.)  According to defendant UCD, the\n12 last discrete act occurred on October 16, 2001 with the\n13 resolution of plaintiffs’ OCR complaint, and thus, plaintiffs’\n14 claims tolled in October 2002.  Id. at 5.   \n15 1. Discrete Acts\n16 “A discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act ‘occurred’ on\n17 the day that it happened.”  National R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\n18 Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002).  Where a discrete act is the\n19 basis for a discrimination claim, the timely filing period begins\n20 to run from that date.  Id.  Such acts “are not actionable if\n21 time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely\n22 filed charges.”  Id. at 113. \n23 In Morgan, the Supreme Court found that, with regard to the\n24 applicability of the continuing violation doctrine, the term\n25 “practice” does not convert related discrete acts into a single\n26 unlawful practice for the purposes of timely filing.  536 U.S.\n27 101, 111 (2002).  The Court defined a “discrete act” of\n28 discrimination as one that constitutes a separate, actionable\n10\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 11 of 44\n1 unlawful employment practice that is temporally distinct.  Id. at\n2 114.  In the employment context, the Court pointed to\n3 “termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, [and]\n4 refusal to hire” as examples of such discrete acts.  Id.  The\n5 Court held that the cause of action accrued when the discrete,\n6 unlawful action occurred, and that “a new violation does not\n7 occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the\n8 occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail\n9 adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.”  See\n10 Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2162,\n11 2169 (2007) (discussing the Court’s holding in Morgan and other\n12 related cases).  \n13 Subsequently, the Supreme Court has reiterated that the\n14 current effects of discriminatory conduct “cannot breathe life\n15 into [that] prior, uncharged conduct.”  Id.  In Ledbetter, a\n16 female retiree sued her former employer under Title VII and the\n17 Equal Pay Act for alleged sex discrimination reflected in\n18 negative evaluations, which resulted in her receiving lower\n19 paychecks than her male counterparts.  Id. at 2163-64.  The\n20 plaintiff argued that each of the paychecks she received\n21 constituted a new, actionable discriminatory act.  Id. at 2169. \n22 The Court rejected this argument, holding that the actionable\n23 discrete conduct occurred when the pay decision was made, not\n24 when a paycheck was issued pursuant to that allegedly\n25 discriminatory decision.  Id. at 2175-76.\n26 In this case, the heart of plaintiffs’ Title IX claims based\n27 upon an unequal treatment theory stems from discrete acts taken\n28 against three women wrestlers over roughly a year’s time. \n11\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 12 of 44\n1 Plaintiffs claim that defendant UCD first blatantly excluded them\n2 from the wrestling program and then failed to give them a fair\n3 opportunity to obtain a position on the team by requiring them to\n4 compete against men, using men’s rules.  These claims are akin to\n5 a claim of termination and failure to hire or promote in the\n6 employment context.  As such, they are appropriately\n7 characterized as discrete acts.  Plaintiffs further claim that\n8 the discriminatory acts continued because they were unable to\n9 wrestle each and every day that they were students at UCD. \n10 However, this inability was merely the effect of defendant’s\n11 prior, allegedly discriminatory conduct.  As set forth in\n12 Ledbetter, the current effects of discriminatory conduct “cannot\n13 breathe life into [that] prior, uncharged conduct.”  127 S. Ct.\n14 at 2169.      \n15 The rationale applied by the Ninth Circuit in Cherosky v.\n16 Henderson is similarly applicable to this case.  330 F.3d 1243\n17 (9th Cir. 2003).  In Cherosky, current and former employees\n18 brought suit against the United States Postal Service under the\n19 Americans with Disabilities Act, challenging the denial of their\n20 requests to wear respirators while on duty.  Id. at 1244-45.  The\n21 Ninth Circuit found that the heart of the plaintiffs’ complaint\n22 stemmed from the individualized decisions to deny the plaintiffs’\n23 requests and, as such, were discrete acts.  Id. at 1247. \n24 Similarly, in this case, the gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint\n25 stems from individualized decisions by defendant regarding the\n26 UCD wrestling program, which affected each individual plaintiff. \n27 As such, these decisions are discrete acts.\n28 /////    \n12\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 13 of 44\n1 Plaintiffs contend that the reasoning of Morgan, Ledbetter,\n2 and Cherosky does not apply in this case because each of those\n3 cases arose out of an employment relationship between the\n4 plaintiffs and the defendants.  (Pls.’ Supp. Mem., filed Aug. 10,\n5 2007, at 7-9.)  The crux of plaintiffs’ argument is that because\n6 Title VII claims arise in the employment context, the Supreme\n7 Court’s holdings in Morgan and Ledbetter should not control the\n8 analysis of plaintiffs’ Title IX unequal treatment claims.3 \n9 Plaintiffs’ argument is unpersuasive.  Title VII and Title\n10 IX are sufficiently analogous that the “discrete discriminatory\n11 acts” analysis prescribed in Morgan applies to the unequal\n12 treatment claims brought by plaintiffs in this case.  Both Title\n13 VII and Title IX address sex discrimination, and the legislature\n14 has emphasized the close relationship between the two. \n15 Specifically, the House Report on Title IX explicitly referenced\n16 the relationship between Title VII and Title IX: \n17 Title VII . . . specifically excludes educational\ninstitutions from its terms. [Title IX] would remove\n18 that exemption and bring those in education under the\nequal employment provision.\n19\n20 Education Amendments Act of 1972, Pub. L. No. 92-318, 1972\n21 /////\n22 /////\n23\n3 Plaintiffs, citing Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. School\n24 Dist., assert that under Title IX, courts “have a measure of\nlatitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme that best comports\n25 with the statute.”  524 U.S. 274, 284 (1998).  This motion does\nnot raise issues regarding remedies, and thus, plaintiffs’\n26 reliance on Gebser in this context is misplaced.  While Gebser\ndemonstrates the “manifest” difference between Title VII and\n27 Title IX in terms of available remedies, the Court’s analysis in\nGebser did not address the analytical framework for assessing a\n28 Title IX claim on the merits.  Id. \n13\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 14 of 44\n1 U.S.C.C.A.N. (86 Stat. 253) 2462, 2512.4  The purposes that\n2 Titles VII and Title IX are both intended to serve, eliminating\n3 discrimination and providing protection against it, suggest that\n4 Title VII’s analytical framework with respect to discrete acts\n5 should be applied to a Title IX claim for sex discrimination. \n6 See Mabry v. State Bd. of Community Colleges & Occupational\n7 Educ., 813 F.2d 311, 316 n. 6 (10th Cir. 1987) (“Because Title\n8 VII prohibits the identical conduct prohibited by Title IX, i.e.,\n9 sex discrimination, we regard it as the most appropriate analogue\n10 when defining Title IX’s substantive standards . . . .”), cert.\n11 denied, 484 U.S. 849 (1987); see also Patricia H. v. Berkeley\n12 Unified School Dist., 830 F. Supp. 1288, 1293 (N.D. Cal. 1993)\n13 (“As the Supreme Court acknowledged in [Franklin], a student\n14 should have the same protection in school that an employee has in\n15 the workplace.”). \n16 Further, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Cherosky reinforces\n17 the conclusion that the Morgan Court’s significant restriction of\n18 the continuing violations doctrine applies outside the Title VII\n19 context.5  330 F.3d at 1246.  “Although Morgan involved Title VII\n20 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Supreme Court’s analysis of\n21 the continuing violations doctrine is not limited to Title VII\n22 actions.  It applies with equal force to the Rehabilitation Act\n23 and to actions arising under other civil rights laws.”  Id.\n24\n4 On the day Title IX was enacted, Senator Bayh stated,\n25 “this amendment [applies] Title VII’s widely recognized standards\nof equality of employment opportunity to educational\n26 institutions.”  118 Cong. Rec. 5807 (1972).\n27 5 In restricting the continuing violations doctrine, the\nCourt applied the “discrete discriminatory acts” analysis. \n28 Morgan, 536 U.S. at 122.\n14\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 15 of 44\n1 (emphasis added); see e.g., RK Ventures, Inc. v. City of Seattle,\n2 307 F.3d 1045 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying Morgan’s rationale in an\n3 action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983); Kaster v. Safeco\n4 Ins. Co. of Am., 212 F. Supp. 1264 (D. Kan. 2002) (applying\n5 Morgan’s rationale to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act).\n6 Therefore, plaintiffs’ claims under the unequal treatment\n7 theory arise out of a series of discrete acts and do not arise\n8 out of a continuing violation of federal law.\n9 2. Pattern and Practice\n10 Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that the Court’s holding in\n11 Morgan does not apply to their case because they are alleging a\n12 pattern or practice theory of the type explicitly excluded from\n13 the Court’s analysis and opinion in Morgan.  536 U.S. at 115 n.9. \n14 Defendant contends that, while evidence of such a claim can\n15 support an individual’s claim of discrimination, the pattern or\n16 practice method of proof cannot apply to a private, non-class\n17 cause of action.  Whether individual plaintiffs can rely on a\n18 pattern or practice method of proof is an issue that has not been\n19 addressed by the Ninth Circuit.  \n20 “A pattern or practice case is not a separate and free-\n21 standing cause of action, . . . but is really ‘merely another\n22 method by which disparate treatment can be shown.”  Celestine v.\n23 Petroleos de Venezuela SA, 266 F.3d 343, 355 (5th Cir. 2001)\n24 (citing Mooney v. Aramco Servs. Co., 54 F.3d 1207, 1219 (5th Cir.\n25 1995).  Specifically, a pattern or practice theory of\n26 discrimination carries with it a different method of proof than\n27 an individual claim of discrimination.  See Int’l Brotherhood of\n28 Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 334-40; Lowery v.\n15\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 16 of 44\n1 Circuit City Stores, Inc., 158 F.3d 742, 759 (1998) (overruled on\n2 other grounds).  In these cases, typically, the government\n3 (either through the EEOC or the Attorney General) or a plaintiff\n4 class charges systematic discrimination against a protected\n5 group.  Lowery, 158 F.3d at 759; see Bacon v. Honda of Am. Mfg.,\n6 Inc., 370 F.3d 565, 575 (6th Cir. 2004); Celestine, 266 F.3d at\n7 355 (5th Cir. 2001).  The plaintiff bears the initial burden of\n8 demonstrating a prima facie case by a preponderance of the\n9 evidence that the defendant’s standard operating procedure\n10 included discriminatory practices.  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336. \n11 “At this initial ‘liability’ stage, the [plaintiff] is not\n12 required to prove that any particular employee was a victim of\n13 the pattern or practice; it need only establish a prima facie\n14 case that such a policy existed.”  Lowery, 158 F.3d at 760\n15 (citing Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 360).  Once such a prima facie\n16 case is established, the burden shifts to the defendant to\n17 demonstrate that the plaintiff’s showing is either inaccurate or\n18 insignificant.  Id.  If the defendant fails to rebut the\n19 plaintiff’s case “the resulting finding of a discriminatory\n20 pattern or practice gives rise to an inference that all employees\n21 subject to the policy were its victims and are entitled to\n22 appropriate remedies.”  Id. at 759 (citing Teamsters, 431 U.S. at\n23 362).  Such a finding justifies an award of prospective relief,\n24 but if individual relief is sought, the plaintiff must\n25 demonstrate that the individual employees were actual victims of\n26 the policy.  Id.   \n27 Although plaintiffs no longer assert class claims or seek\n28 prospective injunctive relief, they assert that they may still\n16\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 17 of 44\n1 press a pattern or practice theory of relief.  “The Supreme Court\n2 has never applied the Teamsters method of proof in a private,\n3 non-class suit.”  Id. at 761.  “Rather, the Court has noted that\n4 there is a ‘manifest’ and ‘crucial’ difference between an\n5 individual’s claim of discrimination and a class action alleging\n6 a general pattern or practice of discrimination.”  Id. (quoting\n7 Cooper v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, 467 U.S. 867, 876\n8 (1984).  Where the government or plaintiff class must first\n9 litigate the common question of whether there was a\n10 discriminatory policy, individual plaintiffs must litigate “the\n11 discrete question of whether the employer discriminated against\n12 that plaintiff in a specific instance.”  Id. (citing McDonnell\n13 Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973)). \n14 Pattern or practice class-action suits also differ from\n15 individual, private discrimination suits because of the “nature\n16 of remedies.”  Id.  Pattern or practice class-action suits\n17 typically seek to cure systemic discrimination and the harm\n18 suffered by the group subjected to that discrimination.  Id. \n19 Therefore, plaintiffs typically seek injunctions for broad\n20 relief, and the “need for such remedies can be determined without\n21 referring to matters such as the qualifications of a particular\n22 employee.”  Id.  Conversely, in an individual discrimination\n23 case, the plaintiff generally seeks damages specific to the\n24 individualized harm inflicted upon him, such as reinstatement,\n25 hiring, back-pay, or damages.  Id.  “Such remedies typically\n26 require the examination of the circumstances surrounding a single\n27 employment action involving the plaintiff.”  Id.\n28 /////\n17\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 18 of 44\n1 Because a pattern or practice theory of recovery is focused\n2 on establishing a policy of discrimination and not on individual\n3 decisions affecting specific plaintiffs, “it is inappropriate as\n4 a vehicle for proving discrimination in an individual case.” \n5 Bacon, 370 F.3d at 575; see Celestine, 266 F.3d at 356 (holding\n6 that the pattern and practice method of proof was inapplicable to\n7 an individual claim of discrimination “given the nature and\n8 purpose of the pattern and practice method of proof”). \n9 Therefore, the court holds that the pattern or practice method of\n10 proof set forth in Teamsters and excluded from the Court’s\n11 analysis in Morgan is not available to individual plaintiffs.  As\n12 such, plaintiffs’ claims based upon unequal treatment that stem\n13 from discrete acts by defendant UCD are not exempt from the\n14 timely filing analysis set forth in Morgan and Ledbetter. \n15 3. Applicable Statute of Limitations\n16 Defendant UCD moves for judgement on the pleadings as to \n17 plaintiffs’ Title IX unequal treatment claims on the basis that\n18 they are barred by the statute of limitations.  Title IX, 20\n19 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., does not specify a limitations period. \n20 When Congress fails to specify a statute of limitations for a\n21 federal claim for relief, courts must apply the most closely\n22 analogous statute of limitations under state law.  Reed v. United\n23 Transp. Union, 488 U.S. 319, 323 (1989).  The Ninth Circuit has\n24 not considered the issue under Title IX; however, the other\n25 federal appellate courts that have considered the issue are in\n26 accord that a Title IX claim is most closely analogous to a\n27 common law action for personal injury.  Doe v. Howe Military\n28 School, 227 F.3d 981, 987 (7th Cir. 2000); M.H.D. v. Westminster\n18\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 19 of 44\n1 Schools, 172 F.3d 797, 803 (11th Cir. 1999); Lillard v. Shelby\n2 County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 729 (6th Cir. 1996); Egerdahl\n3 v. Hibbing Community College, 72 F.3d 615, 618 (8th Cir. 1995);\n4 Bougher v. University of Pittsburgh, 882 F.2d 74, 77-78 (3d Cir.\n5 1989).  Moreover, in Taylor v. Regents of the University of\n6 California, 993 F.2d 710, 712 (9th Cir. 1993), the Ninth Circuit\n7 came to the same conclusion with respect to a Title VI claim.  In\n8 light of this authority, and the fact that Title IX is to be\n9 construed consistently with Title VI,6 the court applies\n10 California’s statute of limitations for personal injury actions\n11 to plaintiffs’ Title IX claims.7\n12 In California, an aggrieved party must commence an action\n13 for personal injury caused by an alleged wrongful act or neglect\n14 within two years of the act.  Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 335.1.  The\n15 two-year limitations period is a fairly recent development. \n16 Before 2003, the limitations period for personal injury claims\n17 was one year.  Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340(3), repealed.  Section\n18 335.1 became effective January 1, 2003.  This amendment impacts\n19 this case, which was filed December 18, 2003.\n20\n21 6 Since Title IX has identical statutory language to\nTitle VI, except for the substitution of the word “sex” in Title\n22 IX to replace the words “race, color, or national origin” in\nTitle VI, the Supreme Court has interpreted both statutes\n23 interchangeably.  Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677,\n694-99 (1979).\n24\n7 Plaintiffs’ argument to the contrary, based on one\n25 Northern District of California decision, is unavailing.  Kramer\nv. Regents of the University of California, 81 F. Supp. 2d 972\n26 (N.D. Cal. 1999) (applying California’s three-year statute of\nlimitations for actions “upon a liability created by statute” to\n27 ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims).  In the Title IX context, it\nis contrary to the weight of the authority described above, most\n28 particularly Taylor.\n19\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 20 of 44\n1 A legislative extension of the statute of limitations period\n2 will extend the limitations period of an actionable claim if the\n3 extension occurs before the claim for relief becomes time barred\n4 under the old limitations period.  Douglas Aircraft Co. v.\n5 Cranston, 58 Cal. 2d 462, 465 (1962).  On the other hand, once a\n6 claim is time barred it will not be revived by the extension to\n7 the applicable limitations period unless the legislature\n8 expressly declared that the amendment of the limitations period\n9 applied retroactively.  Bartman v. Estate of Bartman, 83 Cal.\n10 App. 3d 780, 787-78 (1978).  Such an expression of retroactivity\n11 was made here only for victims of the terrorist attacks of\n12 September 11.  Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.10(b).\n13 Plaintiffs’ first claim for relief alleges that defendant\n14 UCD violated Title IX by failing to provide equal athletic\n15 opportunities.  Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendant\n16 (1) chooses “to make fewer athletic participation opportunities\n17 to female students than to male students;” and (2) intentionally\n18 discriminates against female students by only providing male\n19 students with the opportunity to wrestle and by issuing the No\n20 Females Directive.  (Compl. ¶¶ 129-30).  Viewing the complaint in\n21 the light most favorable to plaintiffs, their first claim for\n22 relief alleges both (1) an ineffective accommodation theory; and\n23 (2) an unequal treatment theory under Title IX.  As set forth\n24 above, plaintiffs’ unequal treatment claims stem from discrete\n25 discriminatory acts by defendant.  The last discrete\n26 discriminatory act alleged by plaintiffs occurred, at the latest,\n27 /////\n28 /////\n20\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 21 of 44\n1 in October 2001, when their OCR complaint was resolved.8  The\n2 statute of limitations then in effect was one year, and thus,\n3 plaintiffs’ claims were required to be filed no later than the\n4 Fall of 2002.  Therefore, plaintiffs’ first claim for relief for\n5 unequal treatment is barred by the statute of limitations, and\n6 defendant UCD’s motion with respect to this claim is GRANTED.9\n7 Plaintiffs’ second claim for relief alleges that defendant\n8 UCD violated Title IX by failing to provide equal athletic\n9 financial assistance by offering athletic scholarship funding to\n10 male students and by intentionally discriminating against female\n11 students by choosing to make less athletic financial assistance\n12 available.  In order to allege a claim under Title IX with\n13 respect to scholarships, the plaintiff must be a member of a\n14 varsity team.  See Pederson, 213 F.3d at 872 (finding that\n15 “[s]tanding to challenge effective accommodation does not\n16 automatically translate into standing to challenge the treatment\n17 of existing varsity athletes” with respect to claims for unequal\n18 treatment in scholarship opportunities).  At the latest,\n19 plaintiffs were members of the varsity team in the Fall of 2001. \n20 The statute of limitations then in effect was one year, and thus,\n21 plaintiffs’ claims were required to be filed no later than the\n22 Fall of 2002.  Therefore, plaintiffs’ second claim for relief for\n23\n8 Here, the existence of plaintiffs’ OCR complaints may\n24\nbe judicially noticed by this court.  See e.g., Pavone v.\nCiticorp Credit Services, 60 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1045 (S.D. Cal.\n25\n1997).  The truth of the allegations contained therein, however,\nis not subject to judicial notice.  See Southern Cross Overseas\n26\nAgencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping Group Ltd., 181 F.3d 410,\n427 (3d Cir. 1999). \n27\n9 The court addresses the viability of plaintiffs’\n28\nineffective accommodation claims, infra.\n21\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 22 of 44\n1 unequal treatment is barred by the statute of limitations, and\n2 defendant UCD’s motion with respect to this claim is GRANTED.   \n3 Plaintiffs’ third claim for relief alleges that defendant\n4 UCD retaliated against plaintiffs.  Specifically, plaintiffs\n5 allege four “retaliatory” acts, the last of which occurred in the\n6 Fall of 2001: (1) defendant instituted the No Females Directive\n7 in the Fall of 2000; (2) defendant reneged on the promise to\n8 remedy the No Females Directive in the Fall of 2001; (3)\n9 defendant did not renew Michael Burch’s contract in mid-2001; and\n10 (4) defendant allowed the female wrestlers a chance to wrestle\n11 against the male wrestlers for a position on the men’s wrestling\n12 team in the Fall of 2001.10  Again, the statute of limitations\n13 then in effect was one year, and thus, plaintiffs’ claims were\n14 required to be filed no later than the Fall of 2002.  Therefore,\n15 plaintiffs’ third claim for relief for retaliation is barred by\n16 the statute of limitations, and defendant UCD’s motion with\n17 respect to this claim is GRANTED.11        \n18\n10 Again, plaintiffs allege that this retaliation resulted\n19\nin a policy of discrimination.  (Compl. ¶ 150).  As set forth\nabove, however, the heart of plaintiffs’ complaint relates to\n20\nthese discrete acts against the individual plaintiffs.  (Compl.\n¶¶ 151-57).  Plaintiffs have cited no authority for the\n21\nproposition that an ineffective accommodation claim can be raised\nthrough a retaliation claim.\n22\n11 Plaintiffs argue that this court should follow the\n23\nrationale in its prior Memorandum and Order, filed May 6, 2004,\nwhich found that plaintiffs’ claims, as alleged, were timely and\n24\nwhich directed the parties to further brief the statute of\nlimitations issues on a motion for summary judgment.  Since that\n25\norder, there have been substantial changes in this litigation,\nnamely the dismissal of class allegations.  Moreover, the\n26\nparties’ arguments and submissions have further clarified the\nlegal theories advanced by plaintiffs.  The court’s prior order\n27\nreflected its analysis of plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation\nclaim, as set forth infra.  The court did not specifically\n28\n(continued...)\n22\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 23 of 44\n1 B. Ineffective Accommodation\n2 In their first claim for relief, plaintiffs allege that\n3 defendant UCD violated Title IX by “choosing to make fewer\n4 athletic participation opportunities to female students than to\n5 male students.”  (Compl. ¶ 129).  The court construes that by\n6 this allegation, plaintiffs are alleging an ineffective\n7 accommodation claim.  Defendant argues that plaintiffs’\n8 ineffective accommodation claim should be dismissed because\n9 plaintiffs (1) alleged insufficient facts to support standing for\n10 an ineffective accommodation claim; (2) failed to give s notice\n11 of their claims; and (3) cannot assert a claim for damages based\n12 specifically upon the lack of opportunity to wrestle.12 \n13 1. Standing\n14 Defendant UCD contends that plaintiffs have not alleged\n15 sufficient facts to set forth an ineffective accommodation claim. \n16 Specifically, defendant contends that (1) plaintiffs failed to\n17 allege that there was sufficient interest and ability among\n18 females at UCD to field a women’s wrestling team; (2) plaintiffs\n19 have failed to allege that there was a reasonable expectation of\n20 intercollegiate competition in women’s wrestling; and (3)\n21 plaintiffs were allowed to try out for the wrestling team on an\n22 equal basis with male students.\n23 /////  \n24\n11(...continued)\n25\naddress plaintiffs’ unequal treatment claims.  However, to the\nextent that this order is inconsistent with the court’s\n26\nMemorandum and Order, filed May 6, 2004, the court reconsiders\nthat Order.  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 54(b). \n27\n12 Defendant does not argue that plaintiffs’ ineffective\n28\naccommodation claims are barred by the statute of limitations.\n23\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 24 of 44\n1 The allegations in the complaint adequately demonstrate that\n2 there was sufficient interest and ability among females at UCD to\n3 field a team.  The complaint contains allegations that in the\n4 early 1990s UCD began providing wrestling opportunities to female\n5 students, including a women’s division in the university’s annual\n6 “Aggie Open” wrestling tournament.  Some of UCD’s female\n7 wrestlers went on to national and international acclaim after\n8 having trained at and received the benefits of wrestling at UCD. \n9 Plaintiffs chose to attend UCD because of that history and\n10 because of the promise of opportunities to participate in\n11 wrestling at UCD.  Mansourian, Chiang, and Ng filled out the NCAA\n12 and UCD paperwork necessary for intercollegiate athletics,\n13 completed the weight certification requirements for\n14 intercollegiate wrestling, and participated in UCD’s wrestling\n15 program for about 2 years.  Mancuso similarly fulfilled the NCAA\n16 and UCD requirements and attended UCD in order to wrestle. \n17 Plaintiffs also allege that there are nearly 1,000 female\n18 students who participate in wrestling at California high schools,\n19 and there are other female students who participate in wrestling\n20 at California community colleges.  As such, viewing the\n21 allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and drawing\n22 all reasonable inferences therefrom, plaintiffs allege that they\n23 were able and ready to wrestle at UCD and that sufficient\n24 interest existed in the female student population at UCD to field\n25 a women’s wrestling team.\n26 With respect to defendant’s assertion that plaintiffs have\n27 failed to allege with particularity that there is a reasonable\n28 expectation of intercollegiate competition, defendant asks this\n24\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 25 of 44\n1 court to impose too heavy a burden on plaintiffs at this stage in\n2 the litigation.  On a motion challenging the sufficiency of the\n3 pleadings, plaintiffs are not required to plead specific facts\n4 establishing a prima facie case of ineffective accommodation. \n5 Swierkiewicz, 534 U.S. at 510-11.  Rather, all that is required\n6 is a plain statement of the facts sufficient to give the\n7 defendant notice of the claims against it.  Id. at 514.  In\n8 Swierkiewicz, the Court of Appeals had affirmed the district\n9 court’s dismissal of a case brought by an employee against his\n10 former employer under Title VII and the ADEA because the\n11 plaintiff failed to allege the elements of a prima facie case of\n12 discrimination in his complaint.  Id. at 509-10.  The Supreme\n13 Court reversed the dismissal, holding that pursuant to Federal\n14 Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), a complaint requires only a “short\n15 and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\n16 entitled to relief” in order to survive a motion to dismiss. Id.\n17 at 510-11.  The Court rejected applying a heightened pleading\n18 standard to discrimination claims.  Id. at 511.  Even if\n19 plaintiffs have not specifically alleged a reasonable expectation\n20 of intercollegiate competition, plaintiffs have complied with\n21 Rule 8(a) and given sufficient notice to defendant of the basis\n22 for their claims.  Therefore, defendant’s motion to dismiss on\n23 this basis is without merit.\n24 Finally, defendant contends that plaintiffs do not have\n25 standing to bring an ineffective accommodation claim because they\n26 allege that they were able to compete with men on an equal basis\n27 for a position on the wrestling team.  However, the crux of\n28 plaintiffs’ claim is that this accommodation was not effective\n25\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 26 of 44\n1 because they were forced to compete in a contact sport against\n2 men using men’s rules.  At this stage in the litigation, viewing\n3 the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,\n4 the court cannot find as a matter of law that defendant’s\n5 proffered opportunity constituted an effective accommodation.\n6 Therefore, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n7 with respect to plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claim on\n8 the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing to sue is DENIED. \n9 2. Notice\n10 Defendant UCD asserts that plaintiffs’ ineffective\n11 accommodation claim must fail because plaintiffs “have not\n12 alleged that they gave defendant notice or opportunity to remedy\n13 any purported systemic non-compliance with Title IX.”  (Defs.’\n14 Reply to Pls.’ Supp. Brief. at 5, filed August 17, 2007.) \n15 Defendant cites Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568 (8th\n16 Cir. 2001), in support of their assertion.  Id.  In Grandson, the\n17 Eighth Circuit affirmed dismissal of similar damage claims\n18 without leave to amend because the complaint made “no allegation\n19 of prior notice of their complaints to appropriate UMD officials,\n20 no allegation of deliberate indifference by such officials, and\n21 no allegation they had afforded UMD a reasonable opportunity to\n22 rectify the alleged violations.”  Grandson, 272 F.3d at 575.\n23 Plaintiffs allege that they filed a complaint with the OCR\n24 in the Spring of 2001.  (Id. at ¶ 67.)  Contrary to defendant’s\n25 assertions, under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, this allegation\n26 reasonably supports the inference that plaintiffs did provide\n27 notice to defendant of their ineffective accommodation claim. \n28 ///// \n26\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 27 of 44\n1 Defendant requests that the court take judicial notice of\n2 letters and reports from the OCR relating to plaintiffs’\n3 complaints.  Rule 201 permits a court to take judicial notice of\n4 an adjudicative fact “not subject to reasonable dispute,” in that\n5 the fact is either “(1) generally known within the territorial\n6 jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and\n7 ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot\n8 reasonably be questioned.”  Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).  The court can\n9 take judicial notice of matters of public record, such as\n10 pleadings in another action and records and reports of\n11 administrative bodies.  Emrich v. Touche Ross & Co., 846 F.2d\n12 1190, 1198 (9th Cir. 1988).  Here, the existence of plaintiffs’\n13 OCR complaints may be judicially noticed by this court.  See\n14 e.g., Pavone v. Citicorp Credit Services, 60 F. Supp. 2d 1040,\n15 1045 (S.D. Cal. 1997).  The truth of the allegations contained\n16 therein, however, is not subject to judicial notice.  See\n17 Southern Cross Overseas Agencies, Inc. v. Wah Kwong Shipping\n18 Group Ltd., 181 F.3d 410, 427 (3d Cir. 1999).  Because the court\n19 cannot take judicial notice of the content of the OCR documents,\n20 the court cannot determine whether plaintiffs provided defendant\n21 with notice of their OCR complaint.  Moreover, none of the\n22 proffered documents includes plaintiffs’ complaint to the OCR;\n23 rather, the only relevant documents contain the OCR’s\n24 characterizations and descriptions of plaintiffs’ complaint.  The\n25 accuracy of the OCR’s conclusions is a factual dispute that must\n26 be resolved on summary judgment or at trial.\n27 /////\n28 /////  \n27\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 28 of 44\n1 Therefore, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n2 on the basis that plaintiffs provided insufficient notice of\n3 their ineffective accommodation claim is DENIED.13\n4 3. Damages\n5 Finally, defendant argues that plaintiffs’ ineffective\n6 accommodation claim must fail because the damages they seek are\n7 too speculative.  (Defs.’ Reply at 5-7, filed August 17, 2001.) \n8 Specifically, defendant argues that plaintiffs cannot assume that\n9 they would have been able to wrestle at UCD if it had been in\n10 compliance with Title IX. \n11 This case is analogous to the Fifth Circuit’s decision in\n12 Pederson, 213 F.3d 858, where the court found that plaintiffs,\n13 female soccer players, had standing to sue for damages under an\n14 ineffective accommodation theory.  In Pederson, the plaintiffs\n15 alleged that Louisiana State University discriminated against\n16 females by ineffectively accommodating female students in the\n17 provision of teams and facilities for intercollegiate\n18 competition.  213 F.3d at 863.  The court held that under an\n19 ineffective accommodation theory, the injuries to a plaintiff\n20 “resulted from the imposed barrier – the absence of a varsity\n21 team for a position on which a female student should be allowed\n22 to try out.”  Id. at 871.  Therefore, so long as a plaintiff\n23 alleged that she was willing and able to compete for a position\n24 on that team, the injury and resulting damages were not unduly\n25\n26\n13 For the purposes of this motion and because plaintiffs\nhave made sufficient allegations with respect to defendant’s\n27\nargument, the court assumes, without deciding, that Title IX\nrequires that a plaintiff give a defendant notice and an\n28\nopportunity to respond.\n28\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 29 of 44\n1 speculative such that plaintiffs’ claims should be dismissed on\n2 the pleading.  Moreover, the court held that to the extent “LSU\n3 violated the individual rights of the plaintiffs by failing to\n4 accommodate effectively the interests and abilities of female\n5 students” and to the extent such violations caused actual\n6 damages, the plaintiffs were entitled to be compensated for those\n7 damages.  Id. at 875.\n8 In this case, viewing the allegations in the light most\n9 favorable to plaintiffs and drawing all reasonable inferences\n10 therefrom, plaintiffs allege that they suffered actual damages\n11 because of the absence of a varsity team, specifically a\n12 wrestling team, for a position on which a female student should\n13 be allowed to compete.  Therefore, based upon the rationale of\n14 the Fifth Circuit in Pederson, plaintiffs’ claim for damages are\n15 not unduly speculative.\n16 Defendant relies primarily on National Wrestling Coaches\n17 Association v. Department of Education, 366 F.3d 930 (D.C. Cir.\n18 2004), in support of its assertion that plaintiffs’ claim must\n19 fail because damages are too speculative.  However, the facts in\n20 National Wrestling Coaches are distinguishable from the facts in\n21 this case.  In National Wrestling Coaches, the plaintiffs\n22 represented athletics organizations that supported college\n23 wrestling.  Id. at 933.  These organizations asked the court to\n24 declare Title IX’s three-part test invalid because it allegedly\n25 encouraged universities to cut male wrestling programs.  Id. at\n26 936-37. The court reasoned that “[e]ven if the court invalidated\n27 the department’s three-part test, schools might nevertheless\n28 continue to eliminate or cap men’s wrestling teams in order to\n29\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 30 of 44\n1 comply with Title IX or the 1975 regulations or for some other\n2 unrelated reason.  Save for their speculation about ‘better\n3 odds,’ appellants would be no better off than they are under the\n4 department’s current policies.”  Id. at 944.  Therefore, the\n5 court found that plaintiffs lacked standing because they failed\n6 to show that their alleged injury could be redressed by\n7 invalidating the challenged policy.  Id. \n8 Conversely, in this case, plaintiffs seek monetary and\n9 punitive damages for injury resulting from lost opportunities\n10 while they were students at UCD.  Plaintiffs allege actual\n11 injury, including lost educational opportunities, increased\n12 education expenses, and emotional distress, all arising from\n13 defendant’s alleged violations of Title IX.  As such, plaintiffs\n14 have sufficiently demonstrated that the monetary relief sought in\n15 this case would sufficiently redress their alleged injury. \n16 Therefore, defendant’s reliance on National Wrestling Coaches is\n17 misplaced. \n18 Thus, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n19 regarding plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claim based upon\n20 an unduly speculative claim for damages is DENIED.\n21 C. Punitive Damages\n22 Defendant UCD argues that plaintiffs’ claims for punitive\n23 damages under Title IX must be dismissed because they are not\n24 permitted under federal law.  In discussing the available\n25 remedies under Title IX and by comparison, Title VI, the Supreme\n26 Court has found that “[a] funding recipient is generally on\n27 notice that it is subject not only to those remedies explicitly\n28 provided in the relevant legislation, but also to those remedies\n30\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 31 of 44\n1 traditionally available in suits for breach of contract.”  Barnes\n2 v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 187 (2002) (citing Franklin v. Gwinnett\n3 County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 76 (1992)).  The Court has also\n4 noted that “punitive damages, unlike compensatory damages and\n5 injunction, are generally not available for breach of contract.” \n6 Id. (citations omitted).  Therefore, the Court has held that\n7 “Title VI funding recipients have not, merely by accepting funds,\n8 implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.”  Id. at\n9 188.  It is well established that Title IX is modeled after Title\n10 VI and is interpreted and applied in the same manner.  See id. at\n11 185; see also Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S.\n12 274, 286 (1998).  As such, because the Supreme Court has found\n13 that punitive damages may not be awarded in private suits under\n14 Title VI, it follows that they may not be awarded in private\n15 suits under Title IX.  See id. at 185-90; see also Mercer v. Duke\n16 Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 202 (4th Cir. 2005) (stating that punitive\n17 damages are not available under Title IX); Frechel-Rodriguez v.\n18 Puerto Rico Dept. of Educ., 478 F. Supp. 2d 191, 198-99 (D.P.R.\n19 2007) (same); Hooper v. North Carolina, 379 F. Supp. 2d 804, 811\n20 (M.D.N.C. 2005) (same); Alston v. North Carolina A & T Univ., 304\n21 F. Supp. 2d 774, 784 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (same).  Moreover, this\n22 conclusion is supported by the Supreme Court’s “traditional\n23 presumption against imposition of punitive damages on government\n24 entities.”  Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United States ex\n25 rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 784-85 (2000); Newport v. Fact\n26 Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 262-63 (1981). \n27 Plaintiffs contend that punitive damages are not unavailable\n28 for Title IX claims as a matter of law.  However, plaintiffs\n31\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 32 of 44\n1 wholly fail to address the Supreme Court’s analysis in Barnes. \n2 The only cases cited by plaintiffs in support of their position\n3 are cases that pre-date the Court’s decision in Barnes by at\n4 least five years.  Such sparse analysis is unpersuasive in light\n5 of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Barnes and the decisions of\n6 subsequent courts that have addressed this issue.14 \n7 Therefore, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n8 regarding plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages under Title IX\n9 is GRANTED.     \n10 D. Emotional Distress Damages\n11 Defendant UCD also argues that plaintiffs’ claims for\n12 emotional distress damages under Title IX must be dismissed\n13 because they are not permitted under federal law.  Specifically,\n14 defendant contends that relief under Title IX is limited to the\n15 forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of\n16 contract and that, absent extreme circumstances, emotional\n17 distress damages are not normally recoverable in contract claims. \n18 However, defendant fails to cite any case law to support its\n19 position that emotional distress damages are not recoverable in\n20 an ineffective accommodation claim under Title IX.  Rather,\n21 defendant acknowledges that the Supreme Court has implicitly\n22 approved of damages claims for emotional distress in sexual\n23 harassment claims brought pursuant to Title IX.  Davis v. Monroe\n24\n25\n14 Plaintiffs also contend that it is improper for this\ncourt to consider the viability of remedies on a motion for\n26\njudgment on the pleadings.  This contention is without merit. \nThe treatise cited by plaintiffs in support of their argument\n27\ndoes not support their assertion.  Further, partial judgment on\nthe pleadings serves to expedite the litigation and narrow the\n28\nclaims for discovery and trial.   \n32\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 33 of 44\n1 County Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999); Gebser, 524 U.S. 274;\n2 Franklin, 503 U.S. 60.  Defendant simply argues that those cases\n3 are inapplicable because the alleged breach of a duty to provide\n4 equal accommodation in athletic programs is not sufficiently\n5 severe to justify the award of emotional damages.  \n6 At this stage in the litigation, in the absence of any\n7 authority on point, the court cannot find as a matter of law that\n8 plaintiffs are not entitled to emotional distress damages. \n9 Therefore, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n10 regarding plaintiffs’ claims for emotional distress damages is\n11 DENIED.                \n12 II. 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n13 Plaintiffs bring claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the\n14 individual defendants for monetary damages based upon alleged\n15 violations of the Equal Protection Clause.15  Defendants argue\n16 that plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim must be dismissed because it is\n17 subsumed by Title IX.  Alternatively, plaintiffs claim that their\n18 section 1983 claim can coexist with their Title IX claims.  \n19 There is presently a split in circuit authority as to\n20 whether Title IX subsumes a claim under § 1983.  Compare Bruneau\n21 v. South Kortright Cent. Sch. Dist., 163 F.3d 749, 758 (2d Cir.\n22 1998) (“[A] § 1983 claim based on the Equal Protection Clause is\n23 subsumed by Title IX), and Waid v. Merrill Area Pub. Sch., 91\n24 F.3d 857, 862 (7th Cir. 1996) (holding that a plaintiff may not\n25\n26\n15 Plaintiffs brought this claim against defendant UCD for\ninjunctive relief only and against the individual defendants for\n27\nall available remedies.  Because plaintiffs conceded that they\nare no longer seeking injunctive relief, plaintiffs’ § 1983\n28\nclaims against defendant UCD are DISMISSED.\n33\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 34 of 44\n1 claim that a single set of facts leads to causes of action under\n2 both Title IX and section 1983), and Pfeiffer v. Marion Ctr. Area\n3 Sch. Dist., 917 F.2d 779, 789 (3d Cir. 1990) (same), and Travis\n4 v. Folsom Cordova Unified Sch. Dist., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11566\n5 (E.D. Cal. 2007) (holding that “Title VI is sufficiently\n6 comprehensive to evince congressional intent to foreclose a §\n7 1983 remedy”), with Crawford v. Davis, 109 F.3d 1281, 1284 (8th\n8 Cir. 1987) (holding that Title IX has no preemptive power over\n9 section 1983 claims), and Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1233\n10 (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that plaintiff has independent rights\n11 under Title IX and under § 1983), and Lillard v. Shelby County\n12 Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 722-23 (6th Cir. 1996) (holding that a\n13 § 1983 claim seeks to enforce distinct and independent\n14 substantive due process rights).\n15 Section 1983 does not create substantive rights, but\n16 provides the procedural framework for a plaintiff to bring suit\n17 for violations of federal rights.  “Section 1983 supplies a cause\n18 of action to a plaintiff when a person acting under the color of\n19 state law deprives that plaintiff of any ‘rights, privileges, or\n20 immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United\n21 States.’”  Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 1983). \n22 However, § 1983 does not provide a remedy for violations of all\n23 federal statutes.  “When the remedial devices provided in a\n24 particular Act are sufficiently comprehensive, they may suffice\n25 to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of\n26 suits under § 1983.”  Middlesex County Sewerage Auth. v. Nat’l\n27 Sea Clammers Ass’n, 453 U.S. 1, 20 (1981).  While the Ninth\n28 Circuit has not decided the specific issue of whether § 1983\n34\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 35 of 44\n1 claims are subsumed by Title IX, it has recognized that federal\n2 statutes may preclude a § 1983 remedy if they are sufficiently\n3 comprehensive.  See, e.g., Dittman v. California, 191 F.3d 1020,\n4 1028 (9th Cir. 1999); Dep’t of Educ. v. Katherine D., 727 F.2d\n5 809, 820 (9th Cir. 1983).   The court agrees with the reasoning\n6 of the Second Circuit in Bruneau that, under the Sea Clammers\n7 doctrine, Title IX’s enforcement scheme is sufficiently\n8 comprehensive to subsume plaintiffs’ section 1983 claims and\n9 demonstrate that Congress intended to preclude § 1983 claims when\n10 it enacted this statute.  See Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756-57.\n11 Title IX’s administrative enforcement scheme is complex and\n12 designed to ensure compliance with its mandates.  Id. at 756. \n13 Under the enforcement scheme, injured persons can file a\n14 complaint with the Department of Education (“DOE”), see 34 C.F.R.\n15 § 100.7(b) (1997), and the DOE must then investigate the\n16 allegations.  Id. § 100.7(c); Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756.  The DOE\n17 may also periodically conduct its own compliance reviews without\n18 a complaint.  Id. § 100.7(a); Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756.  If the\n19 DOE concludes that a complaint has merit or discovers violations\n20 stemming from its own reviews, the DOE will notify the\n21 institution and attempt to reconcile the situation through\n22 informal means.  Id. § 100.7(d); Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756.  If\n23 the DOE is unsuccessful, it may ultimately terminate federal\n24 funding to the institution after an administrative hearing.  Id.\n25 § 100.8; Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 756.  As such, Title IX provides a\n26 comprehensive administrative remedial scheme.\n27 Further, in addition to the robust administrative remedial\n28 scheme, the Supreme Court has held that Title IX provides\n35\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 36 of 44\n1 individuals with a private cause of action.  See Cannon v. Univ.\n2 of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 709 (1979).  “Once in court, the Title\n3 IX plaintiff has access to a full panoply of remedies including\n4 equitable relief and compensatory damages.”  Bruneau, 163 F.3d at\n5 756 (citing Franklin, 503 U.S. 60, 73-76 (1992)).  The fact that\n6 Title IX provides a private remedy in the courts provides further\n7 support for Congress’ intent to subsume a section 1983 remedy\n8 with Title IX. \n9 Therefore, given Title IX’s administrative and judicial\n10 remedies, the court adopts the rationale of the Second Circuit\n11 and finds that it was Congress’ intent “that a claimed violation\n12 of Title IX be pursued under Title IX and not § 1983.”  Bruneau,\n13 163 F.3d at 757; see Pfeiffer, 917 F.2d at 789; Travis, 2007 U.S.\n14 Dist. LEXIS 11566 at *15-16 (holding that Title VI precludes\n15 claims brought pursuant to § 1983 arising from the same facts).\n16 Plaintiffs contend that Title IX does not provide a remedy\n17 for constitutional rights and thus, it cannot subsume a claim for\n18 violation of their rights to equal protections.  In support of\n19 their assertion, plaintiffs cite the decisions from the Sixth,\n20 Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, which have carved out an exception to\n21 the Sea Clammers doctrine for constitutional rights.  See\n22 Crawford, 109 F.3d at 1284; Seamons, 84 F.3d at 1233; Lillard, 76\n23 F.3d at 722-23.  Generally, these Circuits reasoned that although\n24 the claims may arise from the same factual basis, the Equal\n25 Protection clause gives rise to distinct and independent\n26 substantive due process rights separate and apart from those\n27 rights protected by Title IX.\n28 ///// \n36\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 37 of 44\n1 Plaintiffs’ argument is unpersuasive.  In Sea Clammers, the\n2 Supreme Court focused on the available remedies in deciding\n3 whether a claim under § 1983 was precluded by a federal statutory\n4 scheme.  453 U.S. at 13, 20.  The constitutional right exception\n5 focuses on the nature of the underlying right, an inquiry not\n6 focused upon by the Court in Sea Clammers.  Rather, in Smith v.\n7 Robinson, the Supreme Court found that the Education of The\n8 Handicapped Act (“EHA”) provided a sufficiently comprehensive\n9 enforcement scheme, such that it demonstrated Congress’ intent to\n10 preclude a claim under § 1983 for an alleged Equal Protection\n11 Clause violation.  468 U.S. 992, 101316 (“We conclude, therefore,\n12 that where the EHA is available to a handicapped child asserting\n13 a right to a free appropriate public education, based either on\n14 the EHA or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\n15 Amendment, the EHA is the exclusive avenue through which the\n16 child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.”)\n17 (emphasis added).  Therefore, the court finds that there is not\n18 an exception to the Sea Clammers doctrine based upon plaintiffs’\n19 assertion of a constitutional right. \n20 Plaintiffs also argue that their § 1983 claim cannot be\n21 subsumed by their Title IX claim because their § 1983 claim is\n22 pressed against different defendants, the individual defendants,\n23 not UCD.  Plaintiffs misconstrue the doctrine of preemption.  See\n24 Boulahanis v. Bd. of Regents, 198 F.3d 633, 640 (7th Cir. 1999). \n25\n16 Congress subsequently amended the EHA to explicitly\n26\nprovide that the EHA is not the exclusive remedy.  20 U.S.C. §\n1415(f).  However, this subsequent amendment to statute does not\n27\nmodify the analysis of the Supreme Court and its clear indication\nthat there is not a constitutional exception to the Sea Clammers\n28\ndoctrine.\n37\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 38 of 44\n1 Through the enactment of Title IX and its remedial scheme,\n2 Congress created a regime “for the redress of sex discrimination\n3 in athletic opportunities at federally-funded institutions.”  Id. \n4 That regime need not include the ability to press claims against\n5 both the institution and the individuals involved.  Id.  Rather,\n6 “[t]he fact that individual claims are not available under Title\n7 IX means that Congress has chosen suits against institutions as\n8 the means of redressing such wrongs.”  Id. (citing Sea Clammers,\n9 435 U.S. at 20); see also Waid v. Merrill Area Pub. Sch., 91 F.3d\n10 857, 862 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Congress intended to place the burden\n11 of compliance with civil rights law on educational institutions\n12 themselves, not on the individual officials associated with those\n13 institutions.”); Travis, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11566 at *16\n14 (“Allowing Plaintiffs to plead around the detailed statutory\n15 scheme created by Title VI by pleading a § 1983 claim against\n16 [the defendant] in his individual capacity would be inconsistent\n17 with Congress’ creation of restrictions on Title VI claims.”). \n18 As such, plaintiffs’ argument that their § 1983 claim is not\n19 subsumed by Title IX because it is asserted against the\n20 individual defendants, not UCD, is without merit.\n21 Therefore, because plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim is subsumed by\n22 Title IX, defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n23 regarding plaintiffs § 1983 claim is GRANTED.   \n24 III. State Law Claims  \n25 Finally, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ state law claims\n26 against them should be dismissed because they are immune from\n27 suit.  Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that Eleventh\n28 Amendment immunity applies to bar their state law claims against\n38\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 39 of 44\n1 UCD.  The individual defendants contend that they are immune from \n2 suit based upon the discretionary immunity accorded public\n3 employees pursuant to California Government Code § 820.2.17\n4 Section 820.2 provides immunity to a public employee for\n5 injuries resulting from “his act or omission where the act or\n6 omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested\n7 in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.”  Cal. Gov’t\n8 Code § 820.2 (West 2007).  Generally, “a discretionary act is one\n9 which requires the exercise of judgment or choice.”  Kemmerer v.\n10 County of Fresno, 200 Cal. App. 3d 1426, 1437 (1988).  However,\n11 California courts have not set forth a definitive rule which\n12 resolves every case.  Id.  Rather, the California Supreme Court\n13 has adopted an analysis that relies on the “policy considerations\n14 relevant to the purpose of granting immunity to the governmental\n15 agency whose employees act in discretionary capacities.”  Id.\n16 (internal citations omitted).\n17 Immunity is reserved for those basic policy decisions\nwhich have been expressly committed to coordinate\n18 branches of government, and as to which judicial\ninterference would thus be “unseemly.”  Such areas of\n19 quasi-legislative policy-making are sufficiently\nsensitive to call for judicial abstention from\n20 interference that might even in the first instance\naffect the coordinate body’s decision-making process.\n21\n  \n22 Barner v. Leeds, 24 Cal. 4th 676, 685 (2000) (emphasis added). \n23 “Immunity applies only to deliberate and considered policy\n24 decisions in which a conscious balancing of risks and advantages\n25\n17 Defendants assert numerous arguments in support of\n26\ntheir assertion that plaintiffs’ state law claims against them\nshould be dismissed.  However, as set forth infra, because the\n27\ncourt finds that discretionary immunity applies to defendants’\nalleged conduct, the court does not address the merits of those\n28\narguments.\n39\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 40 of 44\n1 took place.”  Caldwell v. Montoya, 10 Cal. 4th 972, 981 (1995)\n2 (internal quotation omitted).  As such, the California Supreme\n3 Court has drawn a distinction “between the ‘planning’ and\n4 ‘operational’ levels of decision-making.”  Johnson v. State, 69\n5 Cal. 2d 782, 795 (1968).\n6 The California Supreme Court has also noted that in order\n7 for § 820.2 immunity to apply, a decision by the public employee\n8 need not be “a strictly careful, thorough, formal, or correct\n9 evaluation.”  Caldwell, 10 Cal. 4th at 983 (“[C]laims of improper\n10 evaluation cannot divest a discretionary policy decision of its\n11 immunity.”).  The Caldwell court reasoned that “[s]uch a standard\n12 would swallow an immunity designed to protect against claims of\n13 carelessness, malice, bad judgment, or abuse of discretion in the\n14 formulation of policy.”  Id. at 983-84.      \n15 A fair reading of the complaint reveals allegations that the\n16 individual defendants made actual, conscious, and considered\n17 collective policy decision.  See id. at 984.  Plaintiffs allege\n18 that “each of the individual defendants has authority over the\n19 athletic programs at UC Davis and has participated in the\n20 discriminatory actions and decisions” set forth in the complaint. \n21 (Compl. ¶ 21).  As such, plaintiffs have alleged that the conduct\n22 was within the scope of the individual defendants’ duties. \n23 Plaintiffs also allege that they spoke or tried to speak to\n24 various individual defendants regarding reinstatement of women’s\n25 wrestling, but defendants either refused to change their policies\n26 or refused to meet with them.  (Compl. ¶¶ 63-64).  This\n27 allegation reveals that the individual defendants were at least\n28 aware and informed of plaintiffs’ opposition to their decisions. \n40\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 41 of 44\n1 Further, plaintiffs allege that each of the individual defendants\n2 was “instrumental in the decision to eliminate wrestling\n3 participation and scholarship opportunities for female students.”\n4 (Compl. ¶ 22).  As such, plaintiffs have alleged that defendants\n5 made actual, conscious decisions relating to the alleged\n6 discriminatory conduct.\n7 Moreover, plaintiffs’ allegations demonstrate that the\n8 alleged discriminatory decisions made by the individual\n9 defendants were policy decisions.  Plaintiffs allege that the No\n10 Females Directive issued by the individual defendants denied “the\n11 then-current female wrestlers and all future female wrestlers the\n12 many benefits obtained by these female alumni from participating\n13 in wrestling at UC Davis.”  (Compl. ¶ 88).  As such, the\n14 allegations in the complaint allege that defendants’ conduct\n15 resulted in a wide-spread effect, not only to the plaintiffs, but\n16 also to all future female wrestlers.  Plaintiffs’ allegations\n17 also describe the public response to the individual defendants’\n18 decisions.  The media supported plaintiffs, writing articles in\n19 newspapers and attending the 2001 Student Senate meeting. \n20 (Compl. ¶ 70).  A member of the California state assembly\n21 expressed her concerns about the individual defendants’ decision\n22 to eliminate women’s athletic participation opportunities and\n23 threatened to withhold state funding if the decision was not\n24 reversed.  (Compl. ¶ 71).  Thus, it is clear from the face of the\n25 complaint that the elimination of a female wrestling program is a\n26 “sensitive” issue with “fundamental policy implications.” \n27 Caldwell, 10 Cal. 4th at 983.\n28 /////\n41\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 42 of 44\n1 Plaintiffs contend that the court cannot find that § 820.2\n2 immunity applies to the individual defendants at the pleading\n3 stage because the allegations in the complaint do not reveal the\n4 process by which defendants made their decision and thus, do not\n5 establish a considered decision.  However, the Supreme Court of\n6 California rejected this argument in Caldwell. 10 Cal. 4th at\n7 983.  In Caldwell, the court upheld defendants’ demurrer based\n8 upon § 820.2 immunity where board members allegedly voted to\n9 replace the superintendent based upon improper motives of race\n10 and age.  Id. at 976.  The court held that the complaint need not\n11 disclose a “strictly careful, thorough, formal, or correct\n12 evaluation.”  Id. at 983.  Rather, the court found that the\n13 application of § 820.2 immunity could be decided at the pleading\n14 stage where “a fair reading of the complaint” demonstrate that\n15 the defendant’s conduct “involved an actual exercise of\n16 discretion.”  Id.  In this case, as set forth above, plaintiffs’\n17 allegations demonstrate that the conduct by defendants\n18 constituted “actual, conscious, and considered” collective policy\n19 decisions.  Id. at 984. \n20 Finally, plaintiffs assert that defendants’ actions were\n21 operational decisions, not policy decisions.  In support of this\n22 assertion, plaintiffs argue that defendants’ actions contravened\n23 existing policies established under the California Education Code\n24 and Title IX.  However, the policies at issue in this case are\n25 not those set forth by the legislature, but rather, the policies\n26 of the University, as promulgated by the individual defendants. \n27 Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that defendants’ actions had a\n28 wide-spread effect at UCD by eliminating athletic opportunities\n42\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 43 of 44\n1 for women.  Such conduct is not the mere implementation of an\n2 already established policy, but the creation of a new, allegedly\n3 discriminatory policy.  As such, plaintiffs’ assertion that\n4 alleged conduct of defendants were operational decisions is\n5 without merit.        \n6 Therefore, because a fair reading of plaintiffs’ complaint\n7 reveals allegations that the individual defendants made actual,\n8 conscious, and considered collective policy decisions, the\n9 individual defendants are entitled to immunity pursuant to 820.2. \n10 Thus, defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding\n11 plaintiffs’ state law claims18 is GRANTED.\n12 CONCLUSION\n13 For the foregoing reasons, defendants’ motion for judgment\n14 on the pleadings is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n15 (1) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n16 regarding plaintiffs’ first claim for relief under\n17 Title IX based upon a theory unequal treatment is\n18 GRANTED.\n19 (2) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n20 regarding plaintiffs’ first claim for relief under\n21 Title IX based upon a theory of ineffective\n22 accommodation is DENIED.\n23\n18 The Supreme Court has explicitly found that § 820.2\n24\nprovides immunity against a public policy tort.  Caldwell, 10\nCal. 4th at 984.  Moreover, § 820.2 immunity will only fail to\n25\napply to basic policy decision where there is a “clear indication\nof legislative intent that statutory immunity is withheld or\n26\nwithdrawn” in a particular case.  The court has found nothing in\nthe Unruh Civil Rights Act which clearly evinces such an intent. \n27\nSee id. at 987-88 (finding that FEHA did not carve out an\nexception to immunity through the phrase “[e]xcept as otherwise\n28\nprovided by statute”). \n43\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 226    Filed 10/18/07   Page 44 of 44\n1 (3) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n2 regarding plaintiffs’ second claim for relief under\n3 Title IX is GRANTED.\n4 (4) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n5 regarding plaintiffs’ third claim for relief for\n6 retaliation in violation of Title IX is GRANTED.\n7 (5) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n8 regarding plaintiffs’ claims for punitive damages under\n9 Title IX is GRANTED.\n10 (6) Defendant UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings\n11 regarding plaintiffs’ claims for emotional distress\n12 damages under Title IX is DENIED.\n13 (7) The individual defendants’ motion for judgment on the\n14 pleadings regarding plaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant\n15 to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 is GRANTED.\n16 (8) Defendants’ motion for judgement on the pleadings\n17 regarding plaintiffs’ state law claims is GRANTED.\n18 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n19 DATED: October 18, 2007\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n44",

RULE 35(b) STATEMENT \n \nThe panel's opinion decided an appeal from a summary judgment in an action that contends the University of Cali-\nfornia at Davis (“University”) denied plaintiffs equal athletic participation opportunities in violation of Title IX, 20 \nU.S.C § 1681. The panel reversed the district court on the ground on which the lower court had granted summary \njudgment-whether plaintiffs were required to give the University notice of their Title IX contentions and an oppor-\ntunity to cure. This petition does not challenge that ruling. \n \nThe panel also, however, decided a point that the district court had not reached-whether the University's athletic \nprogram complied with Option Two of the alternative three part test by which schools can establish compliance with \nTitle IX's “effective accommodation” obligation. Defendants (collectively “Appellees” or “University”) had urged the \npanel to remand that issue if it reversed on the notice ground. (Appellee's brief “AB” 57-60) Alternatively, the Uni-\nversity requested an opportunity to submit supplemental briefing if the panel elected to review the issue. (AB 60-61) In \ndeciding the issue without the benefit of either a district court decision or plenary briefing, the panel made statements \nregarding how Title IX compliance is measured that disturb settled law and conflict with authoritative agency inter-\n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 3 \npretations of Title IX. \n \nIn assessing the University's compliance under Option Two, the panel held that the addition of women's indoor track \ndid not constitute program expansion because it did not result in an increase of the number of female athletes. [Op. 18] \nThis holding contradicts existing case law as well as authoritative agency interpretations. Agency interpretations of \nTitle IX-*2 which the panel recognized command deference [Op. 9 n.9]-are clear that it is expansion of participation \nopportunities that matter under Option Two, as opposed to the expansion of the number of athletes. If a new team is \nadded, the opportunities created by that addition count toward Option Two compliance even if the roster for the new \nteam is filled in whole or in part with athletes who also participate in another sport. By focusing on the number of \nathletes rather than the number of opportunities, the panel disregarded the impact of the addition of indoor track on the \nUniversity's compliance under Option Two. Similar discrepancies between the panel's standards and standards pre-\nviously articulated appear in the Opinion and are discussed further below. \n \nEn banc review is necessary because the conflict between the Title IX standards the panel announced and previously \narticulated standards is an issue of exceptional importance. All schools that receive federal funding must comply with \nTitle IX on an ongoing basis. These institutions rely on authoritative agency interpretations and the small body of case \nlaw on Title IX in developing their programs. Certainty and predictability about which standards control is, therefore, \nessential. Accordingly, Appellees petition for rehearing en banc [see Part III, supra] or panel rehearing [see Part IV, \nsupra]. \n \nII. BACKGROUND PERTINENT TO PETITION \n \nPrior to Title IX's enactment in 1972, the University had an established women's intercollegiate sports program that \nincluded basketball, field hockey, swimming, softball, tennis, volleyball and track/field teams. It was a *3 founding \nmember of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, which was the national governing body for \nwomen's intercollegiate athletics in the 1970s. (Excerpts of Record “ER” 4739:22-4740:23; 4699:22-4701:3) \n \nThe University added women's gymnastics as an intercollegiate team in 1974, and women's cross-country in 1977. In \n1983, it replaced its field hockey team with varsity women's soccer in response to other schools in its conference \ndropping field hockey, the growth in popularity of women's soccer and a parallel decline in popularity of field hockey. \n(ER 4699:22-4701:10; 5075:13-5079:7) In 1996, the University added women's water polo, lacrosse and crew as \nvarsity sports. Women's indoor track was added in 1999, followed by women's golf in 2003. (ER 4724:22-4726:7; \n4743:22-4745:7;4677:22-28 ;4682:27-4683:5; 4683:14-4685:7; 5262-5263) \n \nThe University's intercollegiate wrestling team competes at the NCAA Division I level with other schools in the \nPac-10 Conference. (ER 4659-4661:9). Since no schools in the Pac-10 have separate women's wrestling teams, a \nfemale athlete on the wrestling team would have to compete against a male in her weight class in Conference com-\npetition. (ER 4659-4661:7) \n \nBetween 1995 and 2000, University wrestling coach Michael Burch allowed a handful of women to work out with the \nwrestling team and receive other benefits associated with varsity status. (Op. at 4; ER 1143:4-7; 1148:5-9; 1152:20-24; \n1154:18-25). As a result of roster management, the size of the wrestling team was limited to 34 spots for the \n2000/2001 school year. Burch filled the spots with male wrestlers; the women were not selected because they did not \nhave the skills to compete at the Division I level. (ER4677:23-27; 4678:21-4679:24; 4768, 4803:7-24; 4805:18-21; \n4808:13-*4 25) Two of the women filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights \n(“OCR”). OCR investigated and entered into a resolution plan with the University that included a provision that \nstudents of both genders may try out for the wrestling team, and that the coach would select for membership on the \nteam those students who demonstrated the highest level of skill and competitive ability in their weight class. (ER \n4724:22-4725:5; 4726:13-4727:23; 5155-5159) The following fall Plaintiffs Ng and Mancuso tried out for the team \nbut were not selected. Plaintiff Mansourian did not try out. (ER 4670:22-4671:9;4672:16-4673:5; 4965, 5003:14-18; \n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 4 \n5005:12-25; 4888; 4925:8-11; 5238) \n \nPlaintiffs sued the University and several University officials. Their claims included an assertion that the University \nfailed to provide “effective accommodation,” a Title IX concept that is governed by a test that provides universities \nthree alternative measures to demonstrate compliance. See Op. 8-10). \n \nThe university moved for summary judgment on the grounds inter alia that (1) plaintiffs were required, but had failed, \nto provide the University pre-suit notice of their claimed Title IX violation and an opportunity to cure it, or (2) un-\ndisputed facts established that the University complied with the Option Two test for establishing effective accom-\nmodation. That test focuses on “whether past actions of the institution have expanded participation opportunities for \nthe underrepresented sex ...” (Op. 17) The district court granted summary judgment on the first ground without \nreaching the second ground, involving the Option Two test. \n \nThe University fully briefed the notice issue on appeal. But, citing *5 Fitzgerald v. Barnstable, 129 S.Ct. 788, 798 \n(2009) (“Ordinarily, ‘we do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.”), the University argued that if \nthe Court reversed on the notice issue, it should remand the question of whether the University had established its \ncompliance with Option Two. (AB 57-59) Alternatively, the University requested that, if the Court elected to review \nthe Option Two question de novo, it should request supplemental briefing on the issue. (AB 59) \n \nThe panel elected to review the Option Two issue, but did not request supplemental briefing on it. It held that the \nUniversity's addition of a varsity indoor women's track team was not evidence of program expansion because the \naddition “did nothing to expand the number of female athletes, as all the women participating in indoor track also \nparticipated in an existing varsity sport.” Op. 18. The panel also stated “[t]he Option Two analysis focuses primarily, \nbut not exclusively on increasing the number of women athletes rather than increasing the number of women's teams.” \n(Op. 17.) After applying similar standards to the University's addition of a women's golf team in 2003, the panel held \nthe summary judgment could not be affirmed on the alternative ground that the University complies with Title IX's \neffective accommodation duties. \n \nAs a result of this decision, one of the leading public universities in the world-and a pioneer in intercollegiate women's \nathletics-has been publicly branded a potential Title IX violator based on an analysis of the Option Two issue that the \ndistrict court did not reach and the University did not fully brief on appeal because of the district court's narrow ruling. \nGiven the exceptional importance of the issue and the conflict with previously settled law noted *6 below, this con-\nclusion is worth a second look. \n \nIII. THE COURT SHOULD REHEAR EN BANC THE PANEL'S TITLE IX OPTION TWO ANALYSIS TO RE-\nSOLVE THE CONFLICT THE ANALYSIS INJECTS INTO PREVIOUSLY SETTLED LAW \n \nTitle IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 holds that no person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program receiving \nfederal financial assistance. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n \nThe Title IX concept of “effective accommodation” is derived from a Department of Education (“DOE”) regulation \nthat bases compliance in part on whether “the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodates \nthe interests and abilities of members of both sexes.” See 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1). (Op. 8) Whether a funding reci-\npient has met its “effective accommodation” duty is determined using a three part test drawn from the OCR's 1979 \nPolicy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (Dec 11, 1979). (Op. 9) The test is further explained in a 1996 OCR Cla-\nrification. (Id.); (Addendum to AB, pp. 14-25). \n \nThe test gives universities three options for demonstrating compliance: (1) showing the number of women in inter-\ncollegiate athletics is proportionate to their enrollment, (2) proving that the institution has a “history and practice of \n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 5 \nprogram expansion” for the underrepresented sex; or (3) where the university cannot satisfy either of the first two \noptions, establishing that it nonetheless “fully and effectively accommodates” the interests of women. (Op. 9; 44 Fed. \nReg. 71,418) As the panel noted [Op. 9 n. 9], the courts give *7 substantial deference to the DOE's 1979 Policy In-\nterpretation and its 1996 Clarification in applying this three-part test. \n \nIn the 1996 Clarification, the OCR provided hypothetical examples to illustrate the principles stated in the document. \nOne such hypothetical is: \nAt the inception of its women's program in the mid-1970s, Institution C established seven teams for women. In 1984 it \nadded a women's varsity team at the request of students and coaches. In 1990 it upgraded a women's club sport to \nvarsity team status based on a request by the club members and an NCAA survey that showed a significant increase in \ngirls high school participation in that sport. Institution C is currently implementing a plan to add a varsity women's \nteam in the spring of 1996 that has been identified by a regional study as an emerging sport in the region. The addition \nof these teams resulted in an increased percentage of women participating in varsity athletics at the institution. Based \non these facts, OCR would find Institution C in compliance with part two because it has a history of program expan-\nsion and is continuing to expand its program for women to meet their developing interests and abilities. \n \nIn the district court, the University sought summary judgment in part on the ground that it had established compliance \nunder Option Two because it showed a history and practice of program expansion very similar to the hypothetical \nnoted above. Although the court did not reach that issue, the panel reviewed it and held the University had not estab-\nlished Option Two compliance. The panel held the University's 1999 addition of a women' s indoor track team was not \nevidence of program expansion because the new team “did nothing to expand the number of female athletes, as all the \nwomen *8 participating in indoor track also participated in an existing varsity sport.” (Op. 18) \n \nThis conclusion conflicts with well established law. “Participation” is determined based on the number of roster spots \nthat student-athletes fill on each team and not-as the panel stated-by the number of athletes in the athletic program as a \nwhole. Accordingly, each available spot is counted as a “participation opportunity.” A student-athlete who participates \nin three sports is counted three times for participation purposes. \n \nThis principle is as old as Title IX and was first set forth in the 1979 Policy Interpretation, which defined participants \non a team-by-team basis and contained no exclusion for an individual who had been counted as part of another team. \nSee 44 Fed. Reg. at 71415. The 1996 Clarification likewise focused on “participation opportunities”: “In effect, part \ntwo looks at an institution's past and continuing remedial efforts to provide nondiscriminatory participation oppor-\ntunities through program expansion.” (Addendum to AB, p. 20) (emphasis added); see alo Addendum to AB, p. 24, \nn2). \n \nLest there were any doubt, the Clarification plainly stated that it is the number of roster spots, not the number of \nathletes participating, that count: “In determining the number of participation opportunities for the purposes of the \ninterests and abilities analysis, an athlete who participates in more than one sport will be counted as a participant in \neach sport in which he or she participates. (Addendum to AB, p. 19). \n \nBased on that plain statement, which is entitled to deference [Op. 9 n. 9], two recent cases have rejected arguments that \neach athlete should be counted only once even if she plays multiple sports. In *9Miller v. University of Cincinnati, \n2008 WL 203025, at *7 (S.D.Ohio, Jan. 22, 2008), the district court, relying upon the Clarification, held: “Plaintiffs' \nargument depends on using the unduplicated count of athletes, that is, counting an athlete only once, regardless of how \nmany different roster spots that athlete occupies on different teams. Plaintiffs offer no authority for using the undup-\nlicated count and, to the contrary, the Department of Education prescribes the duplicated count.” (Id.) The court added: \nPlaintiffs assert that the University also incorrectly reports the number of male and female athletes by counting indoor \ntrack and field, outdoor track and field, and cross-country as separate sports. The Department of Education has es-\ntablished this format, however....The current Department of Education reporting of “All Track Combined,” http:// \nope.ed.gov/athletics/InstDetail.asp, does not change that approach. Thus, it is proper for the University to count an \n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 6 \nathlete who competes on the cross-country team, indoor track team and outdoor track team as competing on three \nseparate teams. Id. \n \nIn Biediger v. Quinnipiac University, 616 F.Supp.2d 277, (D.Conn. 2009), the court employed a similar analysis in the \npreliminary injunction context, stating “the plaintiffs do not appear likely to prevail in their arguments that Quinnipiac \ncannot ‘triple count’ its women track athletes .... Cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track have separate NCAA \nchampionships and are, at their heart, different sports.” Id. at 295. \n \nMoreover, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA), 20 U.S.C. § 1092(g) similarly requires institutions to \nreport participation numbers on a team by team basis as part of an annual report that must be filed with the DOE. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1092(g)(1)(B)(i). Although not identical, the regulations *10 implementing the EADA define the term \n“participants” in a manner that is similar to the Policy Interpretation. 34 CFR §668.47(b)(3). \n \nEducational institutions across the country understand and report participation on this basis. The panel's holding \ninjects a serious conflict into that previously settled understanding. The exceptional importance of this issue cannot be \nunderstated. The opinion raises doubt about a previously settled manner in which schools nationwide have been de-\ntermining their Title IX compliance. The Court should grant rehearing en bane to settle this issue before it roils the \noperations of our nation's schools. \n \nThe district court case cited by the panel, Cohen v. Brown Univ., 809 F. Supp. 978, 991 (D.R.I. 1992), aff'd 991 F.2d \n888 (1st Cir. 1993), does not support its conclusion that addition of the indoor track team should not be counted toward \nOption Two compliance. On the contrary, in Cohen, the district court acknowledged winter track was added 10 years \nprior to the commencement of the litigation, but concluded the university had failed to establish the requisite program \nexpansion because the only previous expansion occurred in the 1970's. This decision was issued four years before the \n1996 Clarification. Accordingly, in its second decision on this case in 1996, the First Circuit focused its attention on \nthe number of participants on each team (without discounting multiple sport athletes). Cohen, 101 F.3d at 173. \n \nThe panel made further errors that have broad significance in its analysis of the University's 2003 addition of a golf \nteam. The panel discounted the addition on the grounds that “the fact that there were no women currently attending the \nUniversity who were interested enough in golf to participate at the club level or to request varsity status suggests that \nthe addition of golf instead *11 of field hockey, bowling, horse polo or rugby was not ‘demonstratively responsive’ to \nthe interests of current female students.” (Op. 21) The panel said the golf addition was not expansion because “the \nUniversity's selection of golf, which added only seven participation opportunities for women, was at odds with its \nstated priority of taking a significant step toward overall gender equity. Elevating horse polo, rugby or field hockey \nwould have added far more female varsity athletes.” (Op. 22) \n \nThe definition of “developing interests” is not so narrow as construed by the panel. The 1996 Clarification states: \n“Developing interests include interests that already exist at the institution. [footnote omitted].” Addendum to AB, p. \n20). “[I]nclude” is not the same as “are” or “limited to.” While an Option Two analysis should consider interests \nexpressed on campus, in the Clarification OCR was clear that such interests are not the only factor: “In addition [to \ncampus based interests], OCR will look at participation rates in sports in high schools, amateur athletic associations, \nand community sports leagues that operate in areas from which the institution draws its student in order to ascertain \nlikely interest and ability of its students and admitted students in particular sport(s).” (Addendum to AB, p. 23). \n \nConsistent with this approach, three examples of acceptable program expansion that OCR provided include the addi-\ntion of sports based in whole or in part on national trends or surveys. (See: Discussion of “Institution C”: adding a team \nbased on a request and an NCAA survey showing increased high school participation in the sport; “Institution E”: \nadding sport based on nationwide survey of most popular sports, and “Institution F”: adding a sport based on survey of \ncurrent and admitted students and a regional survey of most *12 popular sports). (Addendum to AB, p. 21-22). In \nCohen, the First Circuit also held that a university may consider interests from outside the campus to inform its pro-\n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 7 \ngram expansion. 991 F.2d at 898 (“For example, so long as a university is continually expanding athletic opportunities \nin an ongoing effort to meet the needs of the underrepresented gender, and persists in this approach as interest and \nability levels in its student body and secondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two is satisfied...”). \n \nThe panel made no mention of the factors considered by Athletic Director Warzecka in recommending the addition of \ngolf over other proposed sports, which included numerous expressions of interest in golf from high school students, \nthe existence of an NCAA championship, and the vast number of universities that offered women's golf which pro-\nvided sources for competition. (ER 4677:22-27; 4784:1-4685:6; 5262-5263) \n \nThe panel's undue emphasis on campus interest conflicts with the principles previously articulated by OCR. The same \nis true of the panel's statement that the University should have added a sport with a greater number of roster spots than \ngolf. Option Two only requires continuous expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the \nunderrepresented sex. It does not require that expansion be achieved by adding the sport with the largest roster or by \nelevating an existing club team. The fact that addition of a large roster sport may boost proportionality compliance \nunder Option One is not a consideration for Option Two compliance because the two tests are distinct alternatives. \n \nThe panel's analysis of the golf expansion conflicts with one of the most important precepts of Option Two. As Norma \nCantu, Assistant Secretary for *13 Civil Rights, emphasized in a letter that accompanied the 1996 Clarification, Op-\ntion Two affords a university broad flexibility to decide how best to comply with the law: “the Clarification does not \nprovide strict numerical formulas or ‘cookie cutter’ answers... Such an effort would not only belie the meaning of Title \nIX, but would at the same time deprive institutions of the flexibility to which they are entitled when deciding how best \nto comply with the law.” (Addendum to AB, p. 15. The Clarification also recognizes that an institution may heed the \nviews of its coaches and other leaders: “OCR will look for interest by the underrepresented sex as expressed through \nthe following indicators, among others: ...interviews with students, admitted students, coaches, administrators and \nothers regarding interest in particular sports; ...” (Id. p.23). \n \nAs the Clarification recognizes, to achieve Title IX's salutary goals schools must be free to expand athletic programs \nby choosing sports that are viable, have sufficient local intercollegiate competition, and respond to expressions of \ninterest. The addition of golf in 2003 is an example of this. The panel's opinion, by contrast, encourages universities \nnot to be truly “responsive” or innovative, but rather to look to roster size only when considering the addition of a new \nsport. That shadow that the panel's opinion casts over Title IX flexibility adds to the exceptional importance of the \nissues presented, and warrants rehearing en banc. \n \nFinally, the panel's opinion creates further conflicts and confusion because it conflates Option Two with the other \nalternative Options for establishing compliance. Option Two is not measured against the relative percentages of fe-\nmales participating in athletics as a percentage of their *14 undergraduate enrollment, as the panel erroneously sug-\ngested. (Op. 18). This statistical assessment relates to a proportionality determination under Option One. Option Two, \nby contrast, is based on steady progress in a university's offerings for the underrepresented sex. As the First Circuit \nexplained in Cohen, “[t]he second and third parts of the accommodation test recognize that there are circumstances \nunder which, as a practical matter, something short of this proportionality is a satisfactory proxy for gender balance. \nFor example, so long as a university is continually expanding athletic opportunities in an ongoing effort to meet the \nneeds of the underrepresented gender, and persists in this approach as interest and ability levels in its student body and \nsecondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two is satisfied and Title IX does not require that the university leap to \ncomplete gender parity in a single bound.” Cohen, 991 F.2d at 898. \n \nBecause there are relatively few decisions applying an Option Two analysis, the panel's erroneous conflation of the \nOption One and Two analyses poses a problematic risk of unsettling the law in this area. This is another reason why \nrehearing en banc is warranted. \n \nIV. THE PANEL SHOULD REHEAR THIS MATTER TO FURTHER CONSIDER ITS OPTION TWO ANALYSIS \n\n2010 WL 1232003 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \n \nAt a minimum, the panel should grant rehearing to clarify some of the above points. Due to the lack of plenary briefing \non the issue, the Court did not have before it many of the above points. Nor does the opinion mention important un-\ndisputed summary judgment evidence, such as the evidence explaining that the fluctuations in the number of female \nparticipants was *15 connected directly to the elimination of junior varsity or “B” program for water polo years after \nother institutions had taken that action and available competition for that team had gradually disappeared, or the fact \nthat the 1996 Clarification expressly recognizes that a school can still comply with Option Two even if it eliminates a \nsport. (ER 4747:22-4748:22; Addendum to AB, p. 21) \n \nThe opinion also is internally inconsistent. For example, the panel relied upon the reports submitted by the University \nunder the EADA in concluding there was data demonstrating the University could not satisfy the substantial propor-\ntionality prong. Thus, the panel implicitly accepted the well established version of “participation” in that portion of the \ndecision discussing the notice issue. (Op. 14) The EADA reports list male and female athletes as participants for each \nteam on which they competed (including both indoor and outdoor track). The panel's later conclusion that the addition \nof indoor track does not constitute program expansion because the student-athletes already participate in another sport \nis internally inconsistent with its reliance upon the traditional notion of “participation” as contained in the EADA \nreports. \n \nWhen all of the undisputed evidence is considered, against the correct legal standards, the University's program \ncompares favorably to the example OCR gave in its 1996 Clarification of a compliant program. See example quoted pp. \n6-7, ante. But regardless of what the panel concludes about the propriety of summary judgment on this issue, the panel \nshould at least consider whether any of the above noted points warrant modification of the opinion-irrespective of \nwhether the modification changes the outcome. \n \n*16 There are only a few cases that have conducted a thorough Option Two analysis, and the points of law discussed \nabove are central to how many educational institutions measure Title IX compliance. Because these points are im-\nportant to the operations of the entire University of California system, as well as that of many other schools, the \nUniversity appreciates this opportunity to present the above points, which were not fully covered in the briefing in this \nappeal. The University respectfully requests that the panel consider whether these points warrant further rehearing or \nany modification of the opinion. \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be granted. \n \n \nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v.

Plaintiffs assert that the relevant time period\n1\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 545    Filed 04/29/11   Page 2 of 6\n1 for analyzing whether defendant has a history and continuing\n2 practice of program expansion should extend back to 1972. \n3 Conversely, defendant asserts that the relevant time period for\n4 assessing Title IX compliance is between 1995 and 2006.\n5 Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., provides, “No person in\n6 the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\n7 participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n8 discrimination under any education program or activity receiving\n9 Federal financial assistance.”  In 1975, the Department of\n10 Education (the “DOE”) issued the Title IX regulation pertaining\n11 to athletics, 34 C.F.R. 106.41, which further clarifies that\n12 “[n]o person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\n13 participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated\n14 differently from another person or otherwise be discriminated\n15 against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or\n16 intramural athletics offered by a recipient.”  In 1979, the\n17 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare1 issued a Policy\n18 Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, to assist schools with\n19 compliance with Title IX.2 \n20 A university’s athletics program is Title IX-compliant if it\n21 satisfies one of the following conditions:\n22 (1) . . . [I]ntercollegiate level participation\nopportunities for male and female students are provided\n23\n24\n1 The OCR later was authorized by Congress to issue Title\n25 IX's regulations with respect to athletic opportunities.  See\nPub.L. No. 93–380, 88 Stat. 612 (1974).\n26\n2 The Ninth Circuit has held that both the Policy\n27 Interpretation and the Clarification are entitled to deference. \nMansourian v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 965 n.9\n28 (9th Cir. 2010).\n2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 545    Filed 04/29/11   Page 3 of 6\n1 in numbers substantially proportionate to their\nrespective enrollments; or\n2\n(2) Where the members of one sex have been and are\n3 underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, . . .\nthe institution can show a history and continuing\n4 practice of program expansion which is demonstrably\nresponsive to the developing interest and abilities of\n5 the members of that sex; or\n6 (3) Where the members of one sex are underrepresented\namong intercollegiate athletes, and the institution\n7 cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion\nsuch as that cited above, . . . it can be demonstrated\n8 that the interests and abilities of the members of that\nsex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the\n9 present program.\n10 Neal v. Bd. of Trustees of the Cal. State Univ., 198 F.3d 763,\n11 769 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting 44 Fed. Reg. 71,418).  This three\n12 part test reinforces that “Title IX is a dynamic statute, not a\n13 static one.  It envisions continuing progress toward the goal of\n14 equal opportunity for all athletes.”  Id.  In this case,\n15 defendant is relying on its alleged compliance with the second\n16 prong of the three part test.\n17 In its 1996 Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics\n18 Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test (the “Clarification”), the\n19 OCR stated that under the second prong of the three part test, an\n20 institution can demonstrate compliance with Title IX by showing\n21 “that it has a history and continuing practice of program\n22 expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing\n23 interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.”  (Ex. B to\n24 Def.’s Trial Brief, at 5.)  The Clarification also expressly\n25 provides the analysis the OCR will conduct to assess compliance\n26 with the history of program expansion component of prong two. \n27 Specifically, it provides, “OCR will review the entire history of\n28 the athletic program, focusing on the participation opportunities\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 545    Filed 04/29/11   Page 4 of 6\n1 provided for the underrepresented sex.”  (Id. (emphasis added).) \n2 However, “[t]here are no fixed intervals of time within which an\n3 institution must have added opportunities” nor “is a particular\n4 number of sports dispositive.”  (Id.)  “Rather, the focus is on\n5 whether the program expansion was responsive to developing\n6 interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.”  (Id.)  The\n7 OCR considers, inter alia, (1) “an institution’s record of adding\n8 intercollegiate teams, or upgrading teams to intercollegiate\n9 status, for the underrepresented sex”; (2) “an institution’s\n10 record of increasing the number of participants in\n11 intercollegiate athletics who are members of the underrepresented\n12 sex”; and (3) “an institution’s affirmative responses to requests\n13 by students or others for addition or elevation of sports.”  (Id.\n14 at 6.)\n15 The 1996 Clarification also provides examples of what may\n16 constitute compliance with the second prong, which demonstrate\n17 that while analysis focuses on the entire history of a\n18 University’s athletic program, the relevant time period for\n19 finding compliance may be shorter based upon more recent\n20 aggressive expansion.  For instance:\n21 Institution F started its women’s program in the early\n1970s with four teams.  It did not add to its women’s\n22 program until 1987 when, based on requests of students\nand coaches, it upgraded a women’s club sport to\n23 varsity team status and expanded the size of several\nexisting women’s teams to accommodate significant\n24 expressed interest by students.  In 1990 it surveyed\nits enrolled and incoming female students; based on\n25 that survey and a survey of the most popular sports\nplayed by women in the region, Institution F agreed to\n26 add three new women’s teams by 1997.  It added a\nwomen’s team in 1991 and 1994.  Institution F is\n27 implementing a plan to add a women’s team by the spring\nof 1997.  Based on these facts, OCR would find\n28 Institution F in compliance with part two.  Institution\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 545    Filed 04/29/11   Page 5 of 6\n1 F’s program history since 1987 shows that it is\ncommitted to program expansion for the underrepresented\n2 sex and it is continuing to expand its women’s program\nin light of women’s developing interests and abilities.\n3\n4 (Id. at 7.)  The handful of decisions that have examined the\n5 second prong both before and after the 1996 Clarification is\n6 consistent with this approach.  See Cohen v. Brown Univ., 809 F.\n7 Supp. 978, 981, 991 (D.R.I. 1992), aff’d, 991 F.2d 888 (1st Cir.\n8 1993) (examining the defendant university’s history of program\n9 expansion from the late 1970s); Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of\n10 Agriculture, 998 F.2d 824, 830 (10th Cir. 1993) (examining\n11 university’s history of program expansion for women starting in\n12 the 1970s); Bryant v. Colgate Univ., 1996 WL 328446, at *10-11\n13 (N.D.N.Y. June 11, 1996) (examining the defendant university’s\n14 history of program expansion from 1972 when the university first\n15 offered women’s sports); Barrett v. West Chester Univ., 2003 WL\n16 22803477, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2003) (considering entire\n17 history of expansion, where the first team was added in 1979).\n18 Based upon the principles of Title IX, the guidance provided\n19 in the 1996 Clarification, and case law discussing prong two of\n20 the three part test, the court concludes that the court must\n21 review the entire history of the athletic program in determining\n22 whether defendant was compliant with Title IX when plaintiffs\n23 were students.  While a shorter, more current period of\n24 aggressive remedial efforts may be highly relevant to\n25 establishing compliance with prong two, the “dynamic” nature of\n26 Title IX, which calls for continuing progress toward the goal of\n27 equal opportunity, requires that the court look at the entirety\n28 of the program as a whole.  See Neal, 198 F.3d at 769. \n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 545    Filed 04/29/11   Page 6 of 6\n1 Defendant’s argument relating to standing is inapposite. \n2 Both plaintiffs and defendant agree that plaintiffs may only\n3 recover based upon demonstration of actual harm.  Indeed,\n4 plaintiffs’ ability to recover for Title IX violations are wholly\n5 separate from the determination of whether defendant was in\n6 violation of Title IX.  As such, defendant’s argument in support\n7 of a truncated time period is without merit.    \n8 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n9 DATED: April 29, 2011\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n6",

Through their efforts, the women’s athletic program at U.C. Davis has developed and \n6  expanded to the point that it is recognized nationwide as an example of what a fair and equitable \n7  athletic program for women should be. The U.C. Davis women’s athletic program has produced three \nNCAA Woman of the Year award winners, a record tied by only one other university in the United \n9.  States. It was twice honored as the best NCAA Division II school for women by Sports Illustrated for \n10  Women. The championship accomplishments of its female student athletes speak loudly to the fact \n11  that women at U.C. Davis who have the skill and abilities to compete at the intercollegiate level thrive \n12  and excel in their sport. \n(cid:9)\n13  Why then, one may ask, is the UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA and four of its employees \n14  under attack for alleged violation of Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States \n15  Constitution? The evidence will show that Plaintiffs’ claims are the result of a misunderstanding (at \n16  best) or a deliberate effort to mislead (at worst) by the former head coach of the men’s wrestling team, \n17  and a sense of entitlement on the part of Plaintiffs to a guarantee that they would have a spot on the \n18  wrestling team roster throughout their college career-something that no student athlete, male or \n19  female, receives. \n(cid:9)\n20  Between 1995 and 2006, 4,086 female student-athletes participated in intercollegiate athletics \n21  at U.C. Davis, Consistent with the basic tenets of intercollegiate sports, those women competed for a \n22  place on the team roster, attended practices, competed against opponents from other schools in \n23  regularly scheduled competition in their sport, and often went on to . compete in post-season \n24  championship bouts. This lawsuit is brought by two women who had \"unofficial status\" on the men’s \n25  wrestling team and never competed in interscholastic competition at the collegiate level, and one who \n26  was cut from the team because she (as well as several males) did not have the skills necessary to earn a \n27  spot on the team roster. \n(cid:9)\n28  In addition to suing the UNIVERSITY, Plaintiffs have accused four long-term U.C. Davis \n2 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 7 of 43\n1  employees of intentionally discriminating against them on the basis of gender. They make this claim \n2  notwithstanding the fact that they never even met some of the individual Defendants prior to filing this \n3  suit. Perhaps the greatest irony is that Plaintiffs have sued former Senior Associate Athletic Director \n4  PAM GILL-FISHER. Years before Plaintiffs were born, GILL-FISHER was advocating for equal \n5  treatment for female student athletes and coaches, a quest she continued throughout her long career as \n6  a multi-sport athlete, a coach, and an administrator. Plaintiffs have also sued GREG WARZECKA, \n7  the Athletic Director at U.C. Davis who oversaw the athletic program during its greatest period of \nB  expansion for women’s sports; ROBERT FRANKS, a former Associate Vice Chancellor who worked \n9  tirelessly to find a way to develop funding to add more sports at a time the State of California \n10  decimated state funding for UNIVERSITY athletics; and LARRY VANDERHOEF, the former \nit  Chancellor of U.C. Davis who led the campus from a NCAA Division II program to a Division I \n12  program that provides top level competitive opportunities for male and female athletes. \n(cid:9)\n13  This suit has diminished significantly in scope since it was filed in 2003. All but two of the \n14  original claims for relief have been eliminated. One of the Plaintiffs dropped out, and Plaintiffs \n15  dismissed their claims against a former Associate Athletic Director. They voluntarily dismissed their \n16  class action claims, and with that their claims for injunctive relief. The Court has ruled that the core \n17  discrete events that form the heart of Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the statute of limitations because \n18  they did not file their suit in a timely manner. The sole claims remaining for trial are for (1) alleged \n(cid:9)\n19  of Title lix, against the UNIVERSITY, for ineffective accommodation of athletic interests; \n20  and (2) alleged violation of 42 U.S. C. §1983 against the individual Defendants based on the Equal \n21.  Protection Clause. Plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages, and, of course, attorney’s fees. \n(cid:9)\n22  The Court will also have the opportunity to hear testimony from two of the leading experts in \n23  Title IX law on the issue of whether the U.C. Davis campus was in compliance with Title IX under \n24  prong two of the three-part test established by the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of \n25  Education. Defendants’ expert, Dr. Christine Grant, is renowned in Title IX circles for her work in \n26  gender equity in athletics. She has testified in many landmark cases in this area (such as  Cohen and \n27  Barrett) - always for the student plaintiffs. This case is particularly significant because it is the first \n28  time Dr. Grant has agreed to testify on behalf of a school and its employees. \n3 \n(cid:9)\nDEFENDANTS’  BRIEF \n(0088 1772.DoC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 8 of 43\nAlthough being sued is never an enjoyable situation, Defendants welcome the opportunity to \n2  have a neutral finder of fact finally listen to the entire story of the events relating to the women \n3  wrestlers, free of media spin and other distortions. \n(cid:9)\n4  II, \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n(cid:9)\n6  A. (cid:9) U.C. Davis and Women’s Intercollegiate Athletics \n(cid:9)\n7  U.C. Davis is one of ten campuses of the University of California, and one of eight of those \n8  campuses that has an intercollegiate (or varsity) athletic program for male and female undergraduates. \n9  The women’s intercollegiate athletic program started in 1947, with the hiring of Mayra Welch, its first \n10  female athletics staff member. Twenty-five years before the passage of Title IX and at a time when \n1(cid:149)  1  many universities would not even consider spending money on women’s sports, U.C. Davis stood out \n12  from the pack. At the time Title IX passed in 1972, it had seven varsity women’s sports. Varsity \n13  gymnastics for women was added by 19. 74. (cid:9) Women’s cross-country was upgraded to a varsity sport in \n14  1978, and began competing in the fall of 1979, to the best recollection of the former coach of that \n15  sport.’ The campus was a founding member of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for \n16  Women. It became a member of the NCAA for purposes of women’s athletics in 1981, which is the \n17  first year that organization sponsored championships for women’s athletics. \n(cid:9)\n18  By the time the first Plaintiff (NG) entered U.C. Davis in the fall of 1998, the women’s athletic \n(cid:9)\n19  was far more developed and far more expansive than it was in the early years after the passage \n20  of Title IX. This was largely due to the actions of GILL-FISHER, FRANKS, and several other U, C. \n21  Davis employees who urged the campus to continue its efforts in regard to gender equity in athletics. \n22  GILL-FISHER was tasked early in her administrative career with reporting on Title IX compliance \n23  issues. Though she never had the power or authority herself to implement changes, she tirelessly \n24  identified areas for improvement and spoke out about them at a time when those who did so were not \n25  always well received by their peers. This situation was not unique to U.C. Davis-Title IX has always \n26  been viewed by some with suspicion. However, in contrast to universities that simply refused to \n27 \n(cid:9)\n28  1  Due to the passage of time, retirement, and aging of those who were at U.C. Davis in the early years after the passage  of \nTitle IX, there is some degree of lack of certainty as to the specific dates when new sports were added. However, the former \ncross-country coach is fairly confident about the accuracy  of these dates. \n4 \nMITITM \n{0o88 1772DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 9 of 43\n1  acknowledge its passage, after the passage of the law, U.C. Davis continued a course of improving \n2  athletics for its female students. \n(cid:9)\n3  In 1992, when Plaintiffs were still in grade school, Keith Williams took over as the acting \n4  Athletic Director at U.C. Davis. During his three-year tenure, he faced the twin challenges of dealing \n5  with unprecedented budget cuts, including removal of all state funding for intercollegiate athletics, and \n6  the need to provide equitable participation opportunities. In the spring of 1993, U.C. Davis \n3(cid:216)t}) \n7  administrators learned that at the end of the fiscal year (June   the campus would be facing a dire \n8  cut in state funding. The situation was so severe that strong consideration was given to eliminating the \n9  intercollegiate athletic program entirely. The program was \"saved\" temporarily by the passage of the \n10  Student Services Maintenance Fee referendum in 1993. This would be the first of several votes taken \n11  by the student body on a number of issues including the fate of athletics at the intercollegiate, club, and \n12  recreational sport level. In essence, the students had to decide whether to do without these programs or \n13  impose added expense on themselves in the form of increased fees. \n(cid:9)\n14  The \"temporary save\" was not sufficient, as further budget reductions continued to rain down on \n15  U.C. campuses. FRANKS worked closely with student leaders to develop another referendum, known \n16  as the Student Activities and Support Initiative. In June 1994, U.C. Davis students were given a choice \n17  of (1) diminishing the intercollegiate athletics program to the Division II minimum of four women’s \n18  and four men’s teams; (2) reducing the intercollegiate athletic program from 20 sports to 17 sports; or \n19  (3) increasing the intercollegiate athletic program to 23 sports by adding three new sports for women. \n20  Each option came with a different impact on student fees. The students voted for the 23 sport option. \n21  In addition to increasing athletic opportunities for women, the campus continued with gender equity \n22  efforts by decreasing opportunities for males. Eventually, all junior varsity teams were eliminated, \n23  including the junior varsity football team which had contributed to the imbalance between enrollment \n24  and participation ratios. \n(cid:9)\n25  In early 1995, three and one-half years before the first Plaintiff entered U.C. Davis, Mr. \n26  Williams began the selection process for the three new sports. A call was made for proposals. After \n27  thorough vetting by committees that included students, coaches, and administrators, the decision was \n28  made to add women’s lacrosse, crew, and water polo. The three teams were added all at once, tripling \n5 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{0088 1772DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 10 of 43\n1  the number of participation opportunities at the outset. This period of aggressive expansion took place \n2  two years before NG entered U.C. Davis, four years before MANSOURIAN entered, and five years \n3  before MANCUSO entered. \n4  WARZECKA became the U.C. Davis Athletic Director in August 1995. Despite being saddled \n5  with daunting budget problems, with the assistance of his administration team (including GILL-\n6  FISHER) and the coaches, he ensured that the newly added teams developed into viable, full-fledged \n7  intercollegiate competitors. In the 1998/1999 school year, WARZECKA expanded funding for \n8  women’s indoor track, which allowed the coach of that team to expand competition opportunities for \n9  her athletes. He also instituted a roster management program designed to (1) control expenses so that \n10  all existing intercollegiate teams could be adequately funded; and (2) control the number of participants \n11  on men’s intercollegiate teams. As of the time the last Plaintiff graduated in 2006, U.C. Davis \n12  sponsored 14 intercollegiate sports for women, far more than the Division II average. \n13  During WARZECKA’S tenure, U.C. Davis produced the three NCAA Woman of the Year \n14  award winners referenced above. Only one other school (University of Tennessee) has produced an \n15  equal number of female student-athletes who reached that pinnacle of intercollegiate success. Three \n16  other female U.C. Davis student athletes were state or national finalists for the Woman of the Year \n17  award. In 1999 and 2000, the campus was named as the best Division  112  school for women athletes by \n18  Sports Illustrated for Women. \n19  U.C. Davis women have won championships in tennis, rowing, softball, swimming, and track. \n20  Its women’s basketball team earned two berths to the Women’s National Invitational Tournament, and \n21  this year captured the Big West Conference championship, which took the Aggies to the first round of \n22  the NCAA championship games. Over the years U.C. Davis female student-athletes have won more \n23  than 250 All-American awards. Accomplishments such as these do not occur by happenstance-they are \n24  the result of the efforts of talented athletes who have the skills to compete at the intercollegiate level, \n25  dedicated coaches, and an administration that strongly supports women’s athletics. \n26 \n2  During the time period in issue in this case, U.C. Davis was an NCAA Division H member, with the exception of men’s wrestling and \n27  women’s gymnastics, which competed at the Division I level due to lack of available local competition at the Division H level. In 2003, \nU.C.Davis started the process of moving to Division I for all sports. It completed a rigorous evaluation process by the NCAA, including a \n28  gender equity assessment, and started competing in Division I in all other sports in 2007. \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 11 of 43\n(cid:9)\n1  B. (cid:9) Plaintiffs and U.C. Davis \n(cid:9)\n2  NO entered U.C. Davis in the fall of 1998 and graduated in September 2002. During the three \n3  years she participated in wrestling, NO competed in only one match or tournament -- the National Girls \n4  Wrestling tournament in Michigan held in the spring of 2000. She did not wear a U.C. Davis uniform \n5  while she competed, and she did not place. NO signed up for the Aggie Open wrestling tournament in \n6  her freshman and sophomore years, but no one in her weight class showed up to compete. Thus, she \n7  did not participate. \n(cid:9)\n8  NO had no desire to practice or wrestle against men; she was more interested in simply working \n9  out than she was in competing. She testified during her deposition that \"I guess the thing is for me, like \n10  I have a fear of competing. And so I tend to avoid it when I can. So that’s why I’m not exactly up for \n11  competing.\" This mindset is in stark contrast to that of other female student-athletes at U.C. Davis who \n12  embrace the notion of competition, which is the essence of intercollegiate athletics. \n(cid:9)\n13  In their Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that \"female wrestlers [at U.C. Davis] had the opportunity \n14  to participate in wrestling ... and to improve their skills to such an extent that some became nationally \n15  ranked, participated in national women’s wrestling tournaments, participated as members of the U.S. \n16  National women’s wrestling team, finished high in the Pan-American games and World Wrestling \n17  Championships and are expected to be members of the United States Olympic team in 2004 when \n18  women’s wrestling becomes a gold medal sport for the first time. Without the benefits obtained from \n19  their participation as female wrestlers at UC Davis, these nationally and internationally ranked female \n20  wrestlers would not likely have achieved such a high level of success on their own\" While it is true \n21  that one woman wrestler, Afsoon Roshanzamir (now Johnston) achieved that level of success, she did \n22  so because of her membership on the USA Women’s Wrestling team and her desire to engage in \n23  competition. NO has never been a member of the U.S. National Wrestling Team, has never \n24  participated in the Pan American Games, and has never participated in the World Wrestling \n25  Championships. She also never tried out for the U. S. Olympic team. \n(cid:9)\n26  NO tried out for the U.C. Davis wrestling team in the fall of 2001. She faced off against \n27  MANCUSO and was quickly pinned. \n(cid:9)\n28  MANSOURIAN entered U.C. Davis in the fall of 2000 and graduated in June 2004. The only \n7 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \nI  (00881772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 12 of 43\n1  tournament she competed in was the Aggie Open in January 2001. MANSOURIAN wrestled against \n2  two women in the tournament and lost to both. She has never wrestled in a national wrestling \n3  tournament, has never participated in the Pan American games, never tried out for the U.S. Olympic \n4  team, and never held any national or international rankings as a wrestler. \n(cid:9)\n5  In the fall of 2001, MANSOURIAN sent an e-mail to the wrestling team coach (Lennie Zalesky, \n6  who was hired in the summer of that year) and said that she was extremely exhausted because of the \n7  demands of her classes and a job, and that she thought intercollegiate wrestling was \"too much for me \nright now.\" Instead, she expressed an interest in wrestling at the club sport level, and filled out the \n9  necessary paperwork for doing so. The Court will have an opportunity to assess MANSOURIAN’s \n10  credibility, as she now claims that she really did want to wrestle at the intercollegiate level and thus was \n11  not truthful in what she wrote in the e-mail. \n(cid:9)\n12  MANCUSO entered U.C. Davis in the fall of 2001. She did not meet the criteria for admission \n13  based on her grades and test scores, but was able to gain admission by being sponsored by the coach of \n14  the women’s soccer team. (MANCUSO participated in wrestling and soccer during high school). She \n15  accepted the offer of sponsorship, which came with the understanding that she would make a good faith \n16  effort to try out for a place on the women’s intercollegiate soccer team. MANCUSO performed in a \n17  lackluster manner during soccer try-outs and was eventually cut. MANCUSO tried out for the U.C. \n18  Davis wrestling team in the fall of 2001. She wrestled-off against NG and pinned her, then went on to \n19  wrestle-off against a male in her weight class, who in turn pinned MANCUSO. NO, MANCUSO, and \n20  several males were cut from the team at the end of the try-out period. \n(cid:9)\n21  Defendants do not deny that Plaintiffs wrestled to various extents in high school, or that they \n22  were interested in wrestling while they attended U.C. Davis. They take issue with Plaintiffs’ position \n23  that they were entitled to a guaranteed spot on the men’s wrestling team, or in the alternative, the \n24  creation of a separate intercollegiate women’s wrestling team. By their very nature, intercollegiate \n25  athletics involve demonstrations of the highest level of athletic skill. Not everyone can be a varsity \n26  athlete. That is why U.C. Davis has such a broad array of sports options for its students. \n(cid:9)\n27  7/ \n(cid:9)\n28  7/ \n8 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL \n(0088 1772.

Davis \n(cid:9)\n2  Men’s wrestling U.C. Davis started as an intercollegiate sport in the 1980’s. In the mid 1990’s \n3  it was headed for elimination (along with other sports) because of budget cuts but ultimately was saved \n4  because of passage of the student referenda. Unfortunately, in the spring of 2010 the budget cuts took \n5  their toll and wrestling was eliminated along with three other sports. Prior to that time, the team \ncompeted in the PAC-1 0 conference. \n(cid:9)\n7  In the early 1990’s a few women worked out with the men’s wrestling team. This continued \n8  after Michael Burch was hired as the head wrestling coach in 1995. Contrary to assertions later made \n9  by Burch and by the Plaintiffs, the Athletic Department administration had no objection to this. It is the \n10  prerogative of the head coach to determine how to conduct practices, and to select members of his/her \n11  team, so long as the coach complies with U.C. Davis and NCAA eligibility rules. \n(cid:9)\n12  Although women practiced with the men’s wrestling team and were included on the roster for a \n13  few years during Burch’ s tenure, there was never a separate women’s wrestling team. The schedule of \n14  competition set up by Burch included only matches for the male wrestlers, with the exception of the \n15  annual \"Aggie Open\" wrestling tournament, which had a women’s division. An open tournament is \n16  literally open to anyone, as compared to head to head competition within a conference or in post-season \n17  championship play. The media guides for wrestling for 1996 through 2000 describe women’s wrestling \n18  as having \"unofficial\" status, something that was never challenged or questioned by NG, \n19  MANSOURIAN, or Burch .3  \n(cid:9)\n20  At most, there were four female students at any one time who expressed an interest in \nwrestling. They sparred with each other during practices, using freestyle wrestling techniques rather \nthan the collegiate style wrestling used by the males. They did not wrestle on behalf of U.C. Davis at \n23  any NCAA wrestling meets. Women’s wrestling is not an NCAA sponsored sport, or even an NCAA \n24  emerging sport. \n(cid:9)\n25  As the trier of fact, the Court will have to make conclusions about the credibility of witnesses. \n26  Burch’s credibility is placed squarely in issue on a number of points. He claims that GILL-FISHER \n27 \n28 \nMANCUSO did not enter U.C. Davis until the fall of 2001. By that time Lennie Zalesky was the head coach of the men’s \nwrestling team. \n9 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \nI  {00881772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 14 of 43\ntold him he could not recruit women or sponsor them for admission. This is untrue. Neither GILL- \n2  FISHER, WARZECKA, or any other administrator ever restricted any coach from recruiting or \n3  sponsoring a student-athlete so long as they complied with applicable rules and regulations. Burch also \n4  claims that GILL-FISHER was hostile to the concept of women’s wrestling. This too is untrue. As \n5  will be established by the evidence, GILL-FISHER has advocated for equality for girls and women in \n6  sports since her grade school years. \n(cid:9)\n7  As noted above, WARZECKA instituted a roster management program. The presence of a few \n8  women at wrestling team practices prior to the enforcement of the roster management program did not \n9  impact the manner in which Burch ran the team. There was no real limit on the number of athletes he \n10  placed on the roster. Since Burch did not schedule any separate competition for the women, or provide \n11  them with athletic scholarships, their presence did not impact his budget. The situation changed in the \n12  fall of 2000. WARZECKA set a maximum roster size for all men’s teams and held the coaches strictly \n13  to it. The initial maximum for the wrestling team was 30. Burch pleaded with WARZECKA to extend \n14  this to 34 so that he could accommodate all of the male wrestlers whom he believed had the talent to \n15  compete at the Division I level. WARZECKA acceded to this request. \n(cid:9)\n16  Burch’s credibility will be tested in another area. He claims that WARZECKA and GILL- \n17  FISHER prohibited him from awarding any of his limited roster spots to women. This is yet another \n18  lie. The head coach of intercollegiate teams at U.C. Davis has the sole discretion to select members of \n19  the team. WARZECKA and GILL-FISHER have never told a coach who they may, or may not, select \n20  for their teams. It did not matter to WARZECKA who was on the roster for the wrestling team so long \n21  as Burch did not exceed his assigned. limit. During the course of a discussion about Burch’s choice to \n22  award all of his roster spots to men, WARZECKA asked him what he planned to do with the few \n23  women who practiced with the team. Burch responded that they were not competitive and that he \n24  \"didn’t give a damn\" about them.  WARZECKA  suggested that Burch speak to the women about \n25  forming a wrestling club team so they could continue participating in their sport. U.C. Davis has a \n26  robust club sport program, that includes levels of competition ranging from the equivalent of junior \n27  varsity teams to a more recreational approach. Many of the sports that have evolved to intercollegiate \n28  status at Davis over the years started at the club sport level. \n10 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 15 of 43\n(cid:9)\n1  Burch did not tell the women about the roster limit or that he had not allotted any of the roster \n2  spots to them. Instead, he lied again and told them that the Athletic Department administration ordered \n3  him to remove them from the team. He allowed them to continue to work out with the team \n4  nonetheless. The women were apparently content with the situation, as they did not make any \n5  complaint to WARZECKA, GILL-FISHER, FRANKS, VANDERHOEF, any other administrator, or \n6  the Office for Civil Rights despite being told that they had allegedly been \"ordered off the team.\" \n(cid:9)\n7  It is important to note that despite the fact that Burch never scheduled regular competition for \n8  the women wrestlers with other women, and never thought to offer them athletic scholarships until \n9  shortly before his appointment ended, Plaintiffs view him as their hero. They do not accuse him of \n10  discriminating against them on the basis of their gender. They have no complaints about the \"unofficial \n11  status\" of women’s wrestling during his tenure. Based on the false statements made by Burch that \n12  members of the Athletic Department administration \"forced him\" to remove the women from the team, \n13  Plaintiffs accuse only the individual Defendants of violating their civil rights. \n(cid:9)\n14  In January 2001, MANSOURIAN suffered an injury during a practice. This came to the \n15  attention of GILL-FISHER because Plaintiff sought services from the trainers, who noticed that she \n16  was not on the team roster, Since GILL-FISHER was out of town WARZECKA met with \n17  MANSOURIAN and NG in order to find out why they were practicing with the wrestling team when \n18  Burch had not put them on the roster. Based on his suggestion to Burch the previous fall that Burch \n19  urge the women to develop a club sport team, WARZECKA thought that was the course that had been \n20  taken. The Court will also have to make another credibility decision in regard to this meeting. \n21  WARZECKA will testify that the meeting was cordial in nature, and that the women seemed confused \n22  about their status on the team which, in hindsight, was understandable because Burch had misled them \n23  on that point. He told them they were not on the roster and thus were not covered by the insurance \n24  provided to intercollegiate athletics. Notwithstanding their status, WARZECKA told them they could \n25  continue to receive ice and taping services from the intercollegiate athletics trainers, and urged them to \n26  speak to the Director of Club sports about developing a women’s wrestling club sport team. Plaintiffs \n27  claim that WARZECKA \"yelled and screamed\" at them during this meeting, and said something along \n28  the lines of \"Newsflash! You were never on the team.\" This is untrue-WARZECKA has never spoken \nIi \nTRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 16 of 43\n1  to a student in that manner. It is interesting to note that despite Plaintiffs’ claimed version of this \n2  meeting, they did not file any complaint of alleged gender discrimination at that time. That did not \n3  occur until several months later, when Burch suspected that his appointment as the wrestling coach \n4  would not be renewed. \n(cid:9)\n5  D. (cid:9) The Events in the Spring. Summer. and Fall of 2001 \n(cid:9)\n6  1. Plaintiffs’ OCR Complaint is Made and Quickly Addressed \n(cid:9)\n7  On April 24, 2001, months after Burch falsely told the women that WARZECKA and GILL- \n8  FISHER had ordered him to remove them from the team roster, NG and MANSOURIAN filed a \n9  complaint with the Office for Civil Rights, claiming they were subjected to gender discrimination in \nID  regard to their participation on the wrestling team. On May 1 or 2, 2001 they delivered a memo to \n11  GILL-FISHER, WARZECKA, FRANKS and others in which they stated that they had been subjected \n12  to \"sexual discrimination\" in the form of being removed from the wrestling team roster, and hoped to \n13  be reinstated soon. (cid:9) Of note is the fact that neither this complaint, nor any of the others filed \n14  subsequently by Plaintiffs, accused U.C. Davis of having a women’s athletic program that did not \n15  provide equal opportunities for women as a whole. That accusation was not raised until years later, \n16  when Plaintiffs filed this suit. \n(cid:9)\n17  U.C. Davis has had a Title IX Compliance Officer since the early 1980’s. Dennis Shimeic \n18  occupied that role from its inception through the time in issue in this case. The campus took immediate \n19  (cid:149) action in response to Plaintiffs’ notice. Based on the confusion caused by Burch’s misrepresentations, \n20  the decision was made to place the women on the roster for the rest of the  2000/2001  season.4  On May \n21  9, 2001 WAECKA sent a memo to Burch instructing him to reinstate the women. He refused, \n22  claiming that he was not responsible for them not being on the roster in the first place. FRANKS sent \n23  an e-mail to the women the following day, advising them that they were on the team roster and offering \n24  to meet with them. NO and MANSOURIAN wrote back, thanking him for his concern, but said they \n25  could not accept the reinstatement they sought until they spoke with their attorney. Shimek advised \n26  OCR of the action that had been taken, and that agency responded that it considered the matter closed. \n27 \n(cid:9)\n28  Plaintiffs claim this offer was illusory because the regular wrestling season was over, That fact would not impact them at \nall because they did not compete in any of the contests that the rest of the team participated in, Members of intercollegiate \nsport teams can and do continue to practice after the end of their regular season. \n12 \nTRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772.D0C) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 17 of 43\n(cid:9)\n1  Thereafter began a series of demands by Plaintiffs that they be afforded preferential treatment. \n2  They insisted that since Burch did not require them to compete for a spot on the team prior to the \n3  imposition of roster management, that they were entitled to ongoing membership on the team under that \n4  same condition. FRANKS met with MANSOURIAN and NG on May 16, 2001. Plaintiffs asked if the \n5  campus would consider having two roster caps for the wrestling team -- one for men and one for \n6  women. He passed on their inquiry to GILL-FISHER, WARZECKA and Shimek. They consulted with \n7  others, including legal counsel, to determine whether such a suggestion was feasible. The conclusion \n8  was that it was not, for a variety of reasons. Of those reasons the foremost was that as a practical \n9  matter, not all students who are interested in participating in varsity athletics have the skill necessary to \n10  earn a spot on the team and not all students who want to be a member of a varsity team can he \n11  accommodated. Each year the Athletic Department receives eligibility forms from many more students \n12  who want to participate in intercollegiate sports than can actually be accommodated on the varsity \n13  teams. There was an upper limit to the total number of student athletes who could be on the wrestling \n14  team, which was the roster cap assigned by the Athletic Director. FRANKS communicated this to \n15  Plaintiffs in an e-mail. Plaintiffs then asked whether the campus would waive the minimum \n16  requirement of ten students for creation of a club sport team, because they did not know if they could \n17  come up with that many female students who were interested in wrestling. \n(cid:9)\n18  2. (cid:9) Protests, Press, and Politicians \n(cid:9)\n19  Fueled by Burch’s false statement that the Athletic Department administration forced him to \n20  remove the women from the team roster, Plaintiffs NG and MANSOURIAN, along with some of the \n21  male members of the wrestling team, embarked on a series of protests and demonstrations. They snuck \n22  into the Aggie Auction, which is the largest annual fundraiser for intercollegiate athletics and disrupted \n23  it by stripping off their clothes and handing out leaflets while dressed in wrestling singlets. They held \n24  some demonstrations outside Mrak Hall, where the Chancellor’s office is housed. Plaintiffs contend \n25  that the individual Defendants were deliberately indifferent because they did not immediately accede to \n26  Plaintiffs’ demands in the face of these protests. As the Court is no doubt aware, the University of \n27  California was the birthplace of the free speech movement-protests on campus about a wide variety of \n28  issues are a regular occurrence. The wrestlers were afforded the same free speech rights as all other \n13 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n00 8 8 1772 .DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 18 of 43\n1  groups who engaged in that activity. \n2  NG, MANSOURIAN and Burch engaged the assistance of the Chief of Staff of a local \n3  Assembly Member. The Chief, Craig Reynolds, was a former wrestler and one of Burch’s friends. The \n4  Assembly Member (Helen Thomson) sent a letter to Chancellor VANDERHOEF on May 3, 2001 \n5  accusing the campus of discriminating against women wrestlers. In what was to become a pattern, \n6  Thomson and her staff did not contact WARZECKA or any member of the Athletic Department to hear \n7  the other side of the story before sending out accusatory letters or press releases. VANDRHOEF was \n8  out of the state at the time the letter was sent. When Thomson did not receive a response in a manner \n9  that she deemed timely, she asked the Chair of the Assembly Budget Committee to withhold funding \n10  for a new building on the campus. (When she was deposed years later Thomson described this move as \n11  nothing more than an \"attention-getter.\") Reynolds would not permit WARZECKA or GILL-FISHER \n12  to have access to Thomson. He did allow the Chancellor and FRANKS to meet with him and \n13  Thomson. During the course of the meeting, Reynolds presented them with a list of demands that \n14  included establishing a separate women’s intercollegiate wrestling team; hiring a full-time head \n15  wrestling coach 5; and building a dedicated wrestling facility. VANDERHOEF and FRANKS attempted \n16  to explain to Reynolds and Thomson why their demands ran afoul of fair treatment for all student \n17  athletes, including those on established club sport teams who were seeking intercollegiate status. \n18  A number of the long-term, highly experienced coaches of women’s intercollegiate sports at \n19  U.C. Davis became very upset over what they perceived was one-sided press releases by Thomson and \n20  media coverage, which included accusing WARZECKA and GILL-FISHER of being biased against \n21  female athletes. These coaches understood that a school does not create an intercollegiate sport team \n22  simply because three or four students want to participate. There must be sufficient local competition at \n23  the intercollegiate level and sufficient interest in order to field a viable team. They also understood that \n24  Plaintiffs’ demands that they be guaranteed a. spot on the men’s wrestling team without having to earn \n25  that spot via a demonstration of skill ran afoul of the very nature of intercollegiate athletics, and was \n26  unfair to the members of the female members of the club sports that were seeking intercollegiate status \n27 \n28  Burch was one of several part-time head coaches at U.C. Davis. He had been pushing for many months for full-time \nstatus, and became very upset when he was told that due to Title IX requirements, the part-time coach of a women’s team \nwould be made full-time before his status would change. \n14 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772DOC} (cid:9)\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 19 of 43\n1  as well as to males who wanted to be on the varsity team but did not have the requisite skills. Sue \n2  Williams and Sandy Simpson, the coaches of the cross-country and women’s basketball teams, drafted \n3  a letter setting forth the coaches’ position. Through repeated efforts, Williams was finally able to get \n4  Thomson to agree to meet with her and GILL-FISHER to listen to what they had to say. The meeting \n5  took place on June 8, 2001. During the course of the meeting Williams mentioned the letter, the fact \n6  that it was signed by a number of influential head coaches of women’s sports, and that they intended to \n7  release it to the media that day. Per her request, Thomson was provided with a copy of the letter. \nB  Thereafter she immediately issued a press release stating that the matters relating to the women \n9  wrestlers had \"been resolved.\" This ended her involvement until March 2002, when (ironically) she \n10  named GILL-FISHER as her Assembly District’s \"Woman of the Year\" for all of GILL-FISHER’s \n11  accomplishments in the area of women’s athletics. \n(cid:9)\n12  3. A Change in Coaches and Try-Outs in the Fail of 2001 \n(cid:9)\n13  Burch’s appointment as head coach was not renewed, and his term ended on June 30, 2001  6 \n14  Zalesky was hired as his replacement. \n(cid:9)\n1  NG and MANSOURIAN filed several more complaints with OCR during the late spring and \n16  summer of 2001. OCR investigators came to campus and conducted an investigation. It did not find \n17  any violation of Title IX in regard to the women wrestlers (as noted above, Plaintiffs’ complaints \n18  focuses solely on themselves-they never alleged that the athletic program as a whole failed to provide \n19  equal participation opportunities for women). In order to clear up any confusion that may have existed \n20  about the manner in which members of the wrestling team are selected, the campus entered into a \n21  Voluntary Resolution Plan (VRP) with OCR that outlined that process. This includes having the head \n22  coach select those student-athletes who are the most skilled in their weight class. The VRP also \n23  provided that the campus would support the formation of a wrestling club team for those students (male \n24  and female) who do not have the skills necessary to make the intercollegiate team. \n(cid:9)\n25  As noted above, MANSOURIAN did not try out for the team in 2001. NG and MANCUSO did \n26  try out, but were not selected, along with several males. Plaintiffs insisted that they should not have to \n27 \n28 \nPlaintiffs asserted in claims filed with OCR and in this lawsuit that the non-renewal was an act of retaliation against \nthem, The Court has dismissed that claim. \n15 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{008817721)OC} \n\n(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 20 of 43\n1  try out for the men’s wrestling team by competing against males, and that they should be allowed to use \n2  freestyle wrestling rules and techniques rather than the collegiate rules used by male wrestlers. Coach \n3  Zalesky conducted the try-outs in a manner consistent with the VRP, and held all students to the same \n4  standards. \n(cid:9)\n5  Plaintiffs did not try out for the team in any subsequent years, nor did they participate at the \n6  club sport level.

Plaintiffs base their \n23  first claim for relief on the assertion that the UNIVERSITY intentionally discriminated against female \n24  students by: (1) choosing to make fewer participation opportunities in intercollegiate athletics available \n25  to women; (2) providing male students, but not female students, with the opportunity to participate in \n26 \n27 \n28 \nFormer Defendant LARRY SWANSON was voluntarily dismissed on November 8, 2010, [Docket item 465] \n16 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772.

Davis wrestling \n10  team in the fall of 2001 under the same terms and conditions applied to male students. [See Docket \n11  item 226, p.  9-10 and section V below] The sole issue remaining for trial under Title IX is whether, \n12  during the time period in issue, there was a systemic failure by U.C. Davis to effectively accommodate \n13  the athletic interests of its female undergraduate students. \n(cid:9)\n14  Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 holds that no person shall, on the basis of sex, \n15  be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n16  education program receiving federal financial assistance. (20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), Exhibit 1 to Joint \n17  Request for Judicial Notice filed concurrently with the parties’ trial briefs) The Regulation \n18  implementing Title IX as it relates to athletics is found at 34 C.F.R. §106.41: \"No person shall, on the \n19  basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from \n20  another person or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or \n21  intramural athletics offered by a recipient [of federal funding] and no recipient shall provide any such \n22  athletics separately on such basis.\" (Exhibit 2 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  p.  1.) Subsection \n23  (C)(1) requires that an institution which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or \n24  intramural athletics do so in a manner that provides equal athletic opportunity to members of both \n25  sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the Director (of the Office for Civil \n26 \n(cid:9)\n27  This is a term used by Plaintiffs to describe their allegation that the individual Defendants \"terminated all wrestling \nparticipation opportunities for female students but not for male students.\" (Complaint, ¶60) \n28 \nThis ruling effectively eliminated the second claim for relief asserted in the Complaint. \n17 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \nF  {00881772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 22 of 43\n1  Rights, which is primarily charged with investigating and making findings on Title TX allegations) will \n2  consider, among other factors, \"whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively \n3  accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.\"  (Id.  at p.  2.) This regulation \n4  became effective on July 21, 1975. Of importance to this case is that the regulation states \"where a \n5  recipient [of federal funds] operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but \n6  operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members \n7  of that sex have been previously limited,  members  of the excluded sex must be allowed to try-out \n8  for the team  offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. 10 Exhibit 2 to Joint Request for \n\" (\n9  Judicial Notice, p.  10 [emphasis added].) As early as 1975, OCR acknowledged that (1) a school need \n10  not operate identical teams in all sports for males and females; and (2) that the \"right\" involved is one \n11  to try out and to compete for a place on the team; there is no \"right\" or \"entitlement\" to a roster spot on \n12  a specific team if a student does not meet the qualifications in the opinion of the coach. One court \n13  succinctly summed this up in the context of a equal protection argument arising from a girl’s desire to \n14  try out for a boys’ middle school football team: \"Nichole Force obviously has no legal entitlement to a \n15  starting position on the Pierce City Junior High School eighth grade football team, since the extent to \n1(5  which she plays must be governed solely by her abilities, as judged by those who coach her. But she \n17.  seeks no such entitlement here. Instead she seeks simply a chance, like her male counterparts, to display \n18  those abilities. She asks, in short, only the right to try.\"  (Force v. Pierce City R-V1 School Dist.,  570 \n19  F.Supp.1020, 1031(W.D. Mo. 1983).) \n20  In 1979 the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued a Policy Interpretation on the \n21  Title IX regulation.  See  44 Fed. Reg. 71,413. (Exhibit 3 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice.) The \n22  Pohey n’ terpretation established what is known as the three-part test for compliance: \n23  \"A university’s athletic program is Title TX-compliant if it satisfies one of the following \nconditions [prongs] : (1) intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and \n24 \nfemale students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective \n25  enrollments, or (2) where the members of one sex have been and are underrepresented \namong intercollegiate athletes, ... the institution can show a history and continuing \n26  practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing \ninterests and abilities of the members of that sex, or (3) where the members of one sex are \n27 \n28 \n’(cid:176) The regulation defines contact sports to include wrestling.

Board of Trustees of the California  State University,  198 F.3d 763, 768 (9th Cit. 1999). \n4 \nThe 1979 Policy Interpretation also addressed the issue of contact sports: \n5 \n\"Effective accommodation means that if an institution sponsors a team for members of one sex \n6 \nin a contact sport, it must do so for members of the other sex under the following \ncircumstances: \n7 \n(1) The opportunities for members of the excluded sex have historically been limited; and \n8  (2) There is sufficient interest and ability among the members  of the excluded sex to \nsustain a viable team and a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition for \n9 \nthat team.\" \n10  (Exh. 3 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  p.  10, emphasis added.) \n11  The three-part test has been universally accepted by the Courts of Appeals (see e.g.  Cohen v. \n12  Brown University [Cohen IV],  101 F. 3d 155 (1st Cir.1996)) and they have given substantial deference \nto the Department’s interpretation of its own regulations.  (Roberts v. Colorado State Bd.  Qf \n].. 3 \nAgriculture,  998 F.2d 824, 828 (10th Cir. 1993).) Equally accepted by the courts is the authority of the \n14 \nDepartment of Education and its Office for Civil Rights to issue Clarifications on the implementing \n15 \n(cid:149) regulation. These Clarifications, as well as OCR’s 1990 \"Title IX Athletics Investigator’s Manual,\" \n16 \nhave been used by courts as sources of guidance for OCR investigators and for courts that are faced \n17 \nwith making a determination on whether an institution is in compliance with Title IX regarding a claim \n18 \nof ineffective accommodation.  (Cohen v. Brown University [Cohen If  809 F.Supp. 978, 983-84 (D. \n19 \nR.I. 1992).) \n20 \nEducational institutions had little guidance on how to comply with Title IX in regard to \n21 \nintercollegiate athletics until years after it was originally passed in 1972. It took the government three \n22 \nyears to issue the implementing regulation. The regulation provided little in the way of specifics-it \n23 \nsimply stated that an institution needed to provide equal opportunities for both sexes via the selection of \n24 \nsport and the level of competition provided, in 1979, the year the oldest of the Plaintiffs (NO) was \n25 \nborn, athletic administrators such as GILL-FISHER were working on understanding the newly \n26 \ndelineated three-part test. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in  Grove City College v. \n27  Bell,  465 U.S.  555  (1984), which effectively suspended enforcement of Title IX as it applies to \n28 \nathletics, until the passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988. The evidence will show that \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{0088 I772DO} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 24 of 43\n1  during this period of time, when many universities shut down any gender equity efforts, U.C. Davis \n2  continued to work in that area. \n(cid:9)\n3  Notwithstanding the issuance of the 1979 Policy Interpretation, more than twenty years after the \n4  passage of Title IX, OCR felt it was necessary to issue a clarification of its interpretation. The 1996 \n5  \"Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test\" is helpful in that it \n6  provides usable, concrete examples of how OCR interprets the three-part test. (Exhibit 4 to Joint \n7  Request for Judicial Notice.) WARZECKA and other administrators relied on this Clarification, as \n8.  expected by the federal government, in assessing whether U.C. Davis was in compliance under prong \n9  two. \n(cid:9)\n10  In what is commonly referred to as the \"Dear Colleague\" letter from Norma Cantu, Assistant \n11  Secretary for Civil Rights, which accompanied. the Clarification, Cantu noted the Clarification confirms \n12  that a school need only comply with one of the three prongs, and that prong two involves \"an \n13  examination of an institution’s good faith expansion of athletic opportunities through its response to \n14  developing interests of the underrepresented sex at that institution.\" (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for \n15  Judicial Notice, pp.  1-2.) For purposes of the Title IX claim made against it in this case, the REGENTS \n16  stipulates that during the time period in issue, the ratio of male to female undergraduate enrollment was \n17  not always \"substantially proportionate\" to the ratio of male to female intercollegiate athletic \n18  participation (prong one). The REGENTS is defending the Title IX claim on the basis that it complied \n19  with prong two (history and practice of program expansion for women). \"[Aln institution is in \n20  compliance if it meets any one of the three prongs of the test.\"  (McCormick v. Sch, Dist.  of \n21  Mamaronec,  370 173d 275, 300 (2nd Cir, 2004).) This concept is so important that OCR emphasized it \n22  again in its 2003 \"Further Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance Regarding Title IX \n23  Compliance\": \"Each of the three prongs is thus a valid, alternative way for schools to comply with Title \n24  IX. ... each of the three prongs of the test is an equally sufficient means of complying with Title IX, \n25  and no one prong is favored.

(cid:9) Application of Prong Two  to This Case \n(cid:9)\n27 \nIn its 1996 Clarification, OCR stated \"the Clarification does not provide strict numerical \n28 \nformulas or ’cookie cutter’ answers to the issues that are inherently case-and fact-specific. Such an \n20 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n008 8 1 772.

It also provided this guidance in regard to prong two: \n4  There are no  fixed intervals  of time within which an institution must have added \nparticipation opportunities. Neither is a particular number of sports dispositive. Rather, \n5 \nthe focus is on whether the program expansion was responsive to the developing interests \nand abilities of the underrepresented sex. \n6 \n7  OCR will consider the following factors, among others, as evidence that may indicate a \nhistory of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests \n8 \nand abilities of the underrepresented sex: [1] an institution’s record of adding \n9  intercollegiate teams, or upgrading teams to intercollegiate status, for the \nunderrepresented sex; [2] in institution’s record of increasing the numbers of participants \n10  in intercollegiate athletics who are members of the underrepresented sex; and [3] an \ninstitution’s affirmative response to requests by students or others for addition or \n11 \nelevation of sports. \n12 \nOCR will consider the following factors, among others, as evidence that may indicate a \n13 \ncontinuing practice of program expansion that is demonstrably responsive to the \ndeveloping interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex: [I] an institution’s current \n14 \nimplementation of a nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the addition of \n15  sports (including the elevation of club or intramural teams) and the effective \ncommunication of the policy or procedure to students; and [21 an institution’s current \n16 \nimplementation of a plan of program expansion that is responsive to developing interests \nand abilities. \n17 \n18  (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  pp.  5-6, emphasis added.) \n19 \nIn essence, \"part two looks at an institution’s past and continuing remedial efforts to provide \n20 \nnondiscriminatory participation opportunities through program expansion.\"  (Id.  at  p.  5.)  The \n21 \nClarification states that \"OCR will review the entire history of the athletic program\" in making a prong \n22 \ntwo assessment. However, the examples it included in the Clarification make it clear that early periods \n23 \nof less than optimal expansion will not result in a finding that prong two does not apply so long as the \n24 \nschool can show a history and effort of program expansion that is responsive to developing interests \n25 \n(see below). This Court has ruled that it will look at the entire history of women’s athletics at U.C. \n26 \nDavis in deciding this claim. However, it also noted that \"a shorter, more current period of aggressive \n27 \nremedial efforts may be highly relevant to establishing compliance with prong two... .\" (Docket item \n28 \n545, p. 5] \n21 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL \n(0088 1772.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 26 of 43\n1  Two of the illustrations provided by OCR in the 1996 Clarification are directly relevant to this \n2  case. The first involves a school that did not expand its women’s program for 17 years after the \n3  passage of Title IX, but then started taking action in the late 1980’s: \n4  \"Institution F started its women’s program in the early 1970s with four teams. It did not \nadd to its women’s program until 1987 when, based on requests of students and coaches, \n5 \nit upgraded a women’s club sport to varsity team status and expanded the size of several \n6  existing women’s teams to accommodate significant expressed interest by students. In \n1990 it surveyed its enrolled and incoming female students; based on that survey and a \n7  survey of the most popular sports played by women in the region, Institution F agreed to \nadd three new women’s teams by 1997. It added a women’s team in 1991 and 1994. \n8 \nInstitution F is implementing a plan to add a women’s team by the spring of 1997. Based \n9  on these facts, OCR  would find Institution F in  compliance with part two. \nInstitution F’s program history since  1987 shows that it is committed to program \n10  expansion for the underrepresented sex  and it is continuing to expand its women’s \nprogram in light of women’s developing interests and abilities.\" \n11 \n12  (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  p.  7, [emphasis added].) \nAnother example detailed an institution that complied with prong two based on adding three \n13 \nteams at six-year intervals: \n14 \n\"At the inception of its women’s program in the mid-1970s, Institution C established. \n15 \nseven teams for women. In 1984 it added a women’s varsity team at the request of \n16  students and coaches. In 1990 it upgraded a women’s club sport to varsity team status \nbased on a request by the club members and an NCAA survey that showed a significant \n17 \nincrease in girls high school participation in that sport. Institution C is currently \nimplementing a plan to add a varsity women’s team in the spring of 1996 that has been \n18 \nidentified by a regional study as an emerging sport in the region. The addition of these \n19  teams resulted in an increased percentage of women participating in varsity athletics at \nthe institution. Based on these facts, OCR would find Institution C in compliance with \n20 \npart two because it has a history of program expansion and is continuing to expand its \nprogram for women to meet their developing interests and abilities.\" \n21 \n22  (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice, p.  6.) \n23  The few courts that have addressed the issue of compliance under prong two were faced with \n24  women’s intercollegiate athletic programs that bear no resemblance to program at U.C. Davis. The \n25  seminal case of Cohen v. Brown is  illustrative. Brown University downgraded two longstanding \nwomen’s varsity teams (gymnastics and volleyball) to club status in 1991. Almost all women’s varsity \n26 \nteams at Brown were created between 1971 and 1977. The only women’s team created after that period \n27 \n28  was winter track in 1982.  (Cohen I, supra,  at p.  981.) When the District Court first ruled on the \nrequest for a preliminary injunction in 1992, it found that Brown did not meet the criteria for prong-two \n22 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n10088 1772.Doc} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 27 of 43\n1  compliance. The Court of Appeal did not disturb that finding. (991 F.2d at p.  903.) U.C. Davis has not \n2  downgraded any women’s intercollegiate teams to club status. Rather, it has upgraded three club sports \n3  to intercollegiate status. In  Roberts v. Colorado State Bd  of Agriculture, supra, suit was filed in June \n4  1992 after the university discontinued its women’s fast pitch softball team and did not replace it with \n5  another sport. The District Court issued an injunction reinstating the team. Both the District Court and \n6  the Court of Appeal found that the university could not claim compliance under prong two because, \n7  apart from creating a women’s sports program in the 1970’s consisting of eleven sports and then adding \nwomen’s golf in 1977, it had done nothing more to expand the program. To the contrary, Colorado had \nB \ndropped three women’s sports and its overall opportunities for women had decreased by 34%. In \n9 \ncontrast, U.C. Davis added soccer at the same time it discontinued field hockey in  198311,  then added \n10 \nmore participation opportunities by the addition of new sports and in less than one decade, it increased \n11 \nparticipation by female student athletes from 32% to  50%. \n12 \n(cid:9) Louisiana State University was sued for ineffective accommodation in 1994.  (Pederson v. \n13 \nLouisiana State University,  912 F.Supp. 892 (M.D. La. 1996).) Women’s intercollegiate athletics \n14 \nstarted at LSU in 1977. Fast pitch softball was added in 1979, but was dropped following the 1982/83 \n15 \nseason \"with no credible reason given.\" No additional women’s sports were added until 1993 when the \n16 \ndecision was made to add fast-pitch softball and soccer in the 1995 season. By the time the District \n17 \nCourt ruled in 1996, the softball and soccer teams had been established but, per an agreement with the \n18 \nSoutheastern Conference schools, actual competition had been delayed. LSU’s prong one numbers \n19 \nwere staggeringly disproportionate:  51%  of the student body was male and 49% female, but male \n9 f \nathletes constituted 71% of total athletes at the school. In addressing prong two and finding that LSU \n21 \nwas not in compliance under that test, the Court stated \"this Court finds that historically LSU has \n22 \ndemonstrated a practice  not to expand women’s athletics at the university before it became absolutely \n23 \nnecessary to do so.\"  (Id.  at p.  916.) Finally, in Barrett v. West Chester University,  2003 U.S. Dist. \n24 \nLEXIS 21095 (E.D. Pa. 2003), the school announced in 2003 that it was dropping women’s gymnastics \n25 \nand men’s lacrosse. Several members of the gymnastics team sued for an injunction mandating the \n26 \nreinstatement of the team. The university made the decision to drop gymnastics notwithstanding a \n27 \n28 \nIn the opinion of the athletic administrators at the time, there was a decline in interest and available competition in field \nhockey. At this same time, interest in soccer at the high school and collegiate level was exploding. \n23 \nTRIAL BRIEF \n(00881 772DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 28 of 43\nstrong recommendation against doing so by the campus Sports Equity Committee which oversees Title \n(cid:9)\n2  issues. This was one of the factors considered by the District Court in coming to the conclusion that \n3  the school did not meet prong two. The school had last added a new women’s sport (soccer) in 1992. \n4  Prior to that, its last addition of a women’s sport was in 1979. \n(cid:9)\n5  In contrast to Brown University, LSU, Colorado State and West Chester University, the \n6  evidence will show that U.C. Davis has demonstrated both a history and practice of program expansion \n7  for women. It had an established women’s sports program prior to the passage of Title IX and was a \n8  founding member of national governing body for women’s intercollegiate athletics before the NCAA. \n9  Prior to the passage of Title IX the campus established a philosophy known as \"The Davis View\" that \n10  included the importance of gender equity in athletics. (Joint Trial Exhibit 14.) Following the passage \n11  of Title IX, several more sports were added. \n(cid:9)\n12  The Court will hear evidence that during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, the Title IX \n13  workgroup and often GILL-FISHER emphasized the need for more expansion of women’s athletics or, \n14  in the alternative, decreasing male participation opportunities so that the ratio between male and female \n15  intercollegiate athletes was more proportionate to their respective enrollment percentages. Some of the \n16  memoranda on these issues are strongly worded, and again are primarily authored by GILL-FISHER. \n17  The Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs heeded her urgings, as did Interim Athletic Director Williams \n18  and FRANKS when he took on responsibility for overseeing intercollegiate athletics and other issues \n19  relating to student life. \n(cid:9)\n20  As noted in section IL A. above, despite unprecedented budget cuts that threatened the existence \n21  of the entire intercollegiate athletic program, U.C. Davis was able to add three sports for women in \n22  1996 as a result of the student referenda. These sports were well established by the time Plaintiffs \n23  entered their last year of high school and began considering attending U.C. Davis. \nThe addition of three sports at one time is a daunting challenge for any institution, particularly \n25  one dependant on the uncertainty of whims of legislative funding. U.C. Davis committed to supporting \n26  the three new teams and building them into viable, competitive sports competitors, consistent with its \n27  long-standing philosophy that each of its intercollegiate teams should be treated equally and strive to \n28  became competitive at the highest levels. At the same time this was happening, WARZECKA was \n24 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 29 of 43\n1  continuing to push down the number of male participation opportunities (in the face of equally \n2  unprecedented increases in the number of female undergraduates) and improve the quality of the \n11 \n3  existing teams for women by upgrading part-time head coaches to full-time status. \n(cid:9)\n4  The Court will hear testimony from the experts retained by both sides. Plaintiffs’ expert, Donna \n5  Lopiano, contends that the addition of three sports at once is no different than adding a single sport for \n6  that year, for purposes of prong two compliance. She contends that the campus therefore did not show \n7  sufficient expansion to invoke compliance under that test. Defendants’ expert, Christine Grant, offers a \nB  much more reasonable opinion. She will testify that the addition of three sports at once by a school the \n9  size of U.C. Davis is almost unheard of, and that the campus should be lauded, not penalized, for \nlb choosing to add the teams all at once rather than spread the start dates out over time. If U.C. Davis had \n11  done so, women who wanted to participate in the sports that were not started immediately would have \n12  forever lost the chance to do so because they would have graduated or have been close to graduating \n13  before the next addition. The experts will also offer differing opinions on whether what the few women \n14  wrestlers did, in regard to participating on the team as part of the \"unofficial status\" of women’s \n15  wrestling, constitutes a true varsity experience. While the 1996 Clarification states that walk-ons and \n16  those students who practice but do not compete will be counted as participants on a team so long as \n17  they receive the normal institutional support for varsity athletes including coaching, regularly attend \n18  practice, and are listed on the team roster, the cover letter from Ms. Cantu also states that \"participation \n19  opportunities must be real, not illusory\". If the Court relies on the expert testimony, it will have to \n20  make a decision on which expert opinion is more credible and viable. \n(cid:9)\n21  WARZECKA also responded to track coach Dee Vochatzer’s request that the track program be \n22  expanded to include regular competition in indoor events. Vochatzer, who has extensive intercollegiate \n23  coaching experience as well as experience as an Olympics coach, realized that the lack of an indoor \n24  track program adversely impacted her ability to attract quality athletes to U.C. Davis, particularly since \n25  Davis did not begin to offer athletic scholarships until the late 1990’s. She made a proposal to Keith \n26  Williams when he was the Athletic Director that her student athletes be permitted to compete in indoor \n27  track events. He agreed, so as long as the cost of entering such events came out of the outdoor track \n29  budget. At the time that was possible because the University of Nevada-Reno had a decent indoor track \n25 \nTRIAL BRIEF \n{0088 I 772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 30 of 43\n1  facility. By the time WARZECKA took over as Athletic Director the track in that facility had become \n2  so run down that it was no longer safe. The only way Vochatzer could continue to provide additional \n3  participation opportunities for women in indoor track was to obtain increased funding from \n4  WARZECKA so that the athletes could travel to indoor track in venues located in Seattle, Boise and \n. 5  Albuquerque. He agreed to provide that funding for both the men’s and women’s track team in \n6  1998/1999, which was the same year indoor and outdoor track started to be counted as separate sports \n7  on the EADA’2  reports. \n8  When the Ninth Circuit initially issued its opinion in this case, it stated that \"the number of \n9  participation opportunities is defined by the number of female athletes actually playing intercollegiate \n10  sports\" and that the addition of indoor track \"did nothing to expand the number of female athletes as all \n11  the women participating in indoor track also participated in an existing varsity sport.\"  (Mansourian v. \n(9tl \n12  Regents, el. al. 594 F,3d 1095,1107   Cir. 2010).) The Court erroneously believed that participation \n13  opportunities were counted by counting bodies. OCR has made it clear that if one student is a member \n14  of two intercollegiate teams, this counts as two participation opportunities.  See Miller v. University qf \n15  Cincinnatti, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4339, 20-21 (S.D. Ohio, Jan. 22,2008): \n16  \"Plaintiffs assert that the University also incorrectly reports the number of male and \nfemale athletes by counting indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and cross-\n17 \ncountry as separate sports. The Department of Education has established this format, \nhowever. ... The current Department of Education reporting of ’All Track Combined,\" \n18 \nhttp://ope.ed.gov/athletics/InstDetail.asp,   does not change that approach. Thus, it is \n19  proper for the University to count an athlete who competes on the cross-country team, \nindoor track team and outdoor track team as competing on three separate teams.\" \n20 \n21  After the REGENTS filed a petition for rehearing based on the erroneous conclusions about counting \n22  indoor track opportunities, the Ninth Circuit issued an amended opinion that omitted that statement. \n23  (See Mansouirian v. Regents,  602 F.3d 957, (9th Cir. 2010).) WARZECKA’s agreement to provide \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  2  This refers to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, which requires institutions to submit an annual report delineating \ninformation pertaining to intercollegiate participation numbers and other related issues. \n26 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772,DoC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 31 of 43\n1  additional funding so that female indoor track athletes could continue to compete constitutes further \n2  evidence of a commitment to expanding opportunities.  3  \n3  In 2003, another call was made for proposals to consider adding a new women’s varsity sport. \n4  This was done according to the same process used in  1995, which included specific criteria used for \n5  selection. Those criteria include (1) the overall impact on gender equity; (2) interest level; (3) sport \n0  sponsorship and available competition; and (4) facilities. Proposals were submitted on behalf of five \n7  women’s sports: bowling, field hockey, golf; horse polo and rugby. There was no proposal submitted \n8  on behalf of women’s wrestling, just as there had been no proposal for that sport in 1995. GILL-\n9  FISHER chaired a committee consisting of a representative of Athletic Administration Advisory \n10  Committee, a representative of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee, and a representative of the \n11  Sports Club Council. The committee met with a representative of each sport that submitted a proposal, \n12  reviewed the written proposals, and then summarized the information. This information was passed on \n13  to WARZECKA who reviewed it and made the recommendation that women’s golf be added as a \n14  varsity sport. The reasons he recommended golf over the other sports proposed are: (1) golf is a \n15  championship sport in the Big West Conference and per Conference rules, U.C. Davis was required to \n16  add sports that are already part of that conference before adding non-conference sports; (2) women’s \n17  golf was offered by 451  universities nationally, which reflects the interest level in the sport; (3) the \n18  NCAA has a golf championship in all three divisions; (4) U.C. Davis received many inquiries from \n19  female high school students who were interested in golf; and  (5) the local community had indicated a \n20  strong support of golf; including use of the El Macero Country Club in Davis. The Vice Chancellor \n21  for Student Affairs agreed with WARZECKA’s recommendation. \n22  Plaintiffs attack the selection of golf, and the fact that WARZECKA gave its newly appointed \n23  coach, Kathy DeYoung, a year to set up a program and recruit a team that could be competitive at the \n24  Division I level. DeYoung, a very seasoned coach, will testify about the realities of establishing a team \n25  in anew intercollegiate sport and why that cannot be done overnight. Her instincts were good-within a \n26  few years the women’s golf team was competing at the championship level. \n27 \n28  13 Unlike schools that have been in the newspaper and under court scrutiny lately for very questionable practices regarding \ncounting of athletic participation opportunities, U.C. Davis has never forced its track and field athletes to run cross-country \nin order to participate in the former sport, and it has always had separate coaches for those two sports. \n27 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772.DOC} (cid:9)\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 32 of 43\n(cid:9)\n1  Plaintiffs contend prong two cannot be used when a school has eliminated a team. This is not \n2  correct. Per the 1996 Clarification, \"in the event that an institution eliminated any team for the \n3  underrepresented sex, OCR would evaluate the circumstances surrounding this action in assessing \n4  whether the institution could satisfy part two of the test.\" (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial \nNotice, p.  6) One of the hypothetical examples of prong two compliance in that Clarification includes \n6  a school that eliminates a team for a valid reason. (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  p.  6 \n7  [Institution D example].) U.C. Davis eliminated women’s field hockey because of a lack of \ncompetition and a lack of interest in the sport at that time. Field hockey was replaced by soccer, which \n9  was much more popular with students. The fact that UC Davis dropped varsity field hockey and \n10  replaced it with women’s varsity soccer is not indicative of a failure to demonstrate program expansion. \n(cid:9)\n11  In a prong-two analysis, another issue that must be considered is whether (notwithstanding a \n12  history of program expansion) there has been a decrease in the number of participation opportunities. \n13  The presence of a decrease does not preclude reliance on prong two; rather, the reason for the decrease \n14  must be examined and a valid explanation will be accepted. (Exhibit 4 to Joint Request for Judicial \n15  Notice, p.  6.) Dr. Grant will testify that the reason for the fluctuation at U.C. Davis was the legitimate \n16  elimination of \"B\" or junior varsity water polo and lacrosse teams because of lack of available \n17  competition. She has considerable experience as an Athletic Director, and is well aware of the problem \n19  of lack of available competition for intercollegiate junior varsity teams. Dr. Grant was surprised to find \n19  that U.C. Davis maintained its JY teams for as long as it did. \n(cid:9)\n20  It is unclear whether the question of prong two compliance is one of law or one of fact. Most \n21  decisions on that issue have been made either by OCR in the absence of litigation, or by a court in the \n22  context of an application for a temporary restraining order or a motion for summary judgment. In either \n23  event, the question is well suited for this case as the Court will make combined findings of fact and \n24  law. \n(cid:9)\n25  Defendant REGENTS believes the evidence will show that it had both a history and practice of \n26  program expansion for women, including an intense period of expansion during a time period that \nactually has some relevance to the Plaintiffs. While it is true new sports were not added as frequently \nprior to 1996, the law does not require an institution to \"leap to gender parity in a single bound.\" \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772DoC} \n\n(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)(cid:9)\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 33 of 43\n1  (Cohen v. Brown University [Cohen II]  991 F.2d. 888,  898(1s’  Cit. 1993).) It is difficult to conceive \n2  how a lack of adequate expansion in the early 1970’s (before Plaintiffs were born), or the 1980’s (when \n3  they were toddlers and children), or even the first few years of the 90’s (when they were in grade \n4  school and junior high) could have any impact on Plaintiffs. \n(cid:9)\n5  B. (cid:9) Section 1983 (Equal Protection) Claim \n(cid:9)\n6  1, (cid:9) Introduction \n(cid:9)\n7  At the Final Pretrial Conference the Court asked whether a stipulation entered into by \n8  Defendant REGENTS had any impact on the Equal Protection Clause claim asserted against the \n9  individual Defendants. (The Equal Protection Claim is not asserted against the REGENTS.) The \n(cid:9)\n10  is the one set forth in Defendants’ points of law section of the Joint Final Pretrial \n11  Statement, specifically that during the time period relevant to the Title IX claim asserted against the \n12  REGENTS, the ratio of male and female participants in intercollegiate athletics was not always \n13  substantially proportionate to the ratio of male and female undergraduate enrollment at U.S. Davis. \n(cid:9)\n14  The answer to the Court’s inquiry is that \"substantial proportionality\" is a concept that exists \n15  only in the realm of a Title IX claim. It is the first prong of the three part test for effective \n16  accommodation of the athletic interests of the underrepresented sex. The fact that athletic participation \n17  opportunities may not have been substantially proportionate to undergraduate enrollment ratios during \n18  the time period in issue does not  ipso facto mean that the individuals sued in this case engaged in \n19  intentional discrimination against Plaintiffs on the basis of gender. The regulations pertaining to Title \n20  IX, the Interpretation and Clarification issued by the Office for Civil Rights, and case law all make it \n21  very clear that (1) an educational institution has the full discretion to select which of the three prongs it \n22  chooses to ensure that athletic interests are effectively accommodated; and (2) that compliance under \n23  prong one (substantial proportionality) is not required so long as the school demonstrates compliance \n24  under prong two or prong three, it is inconceivable that an individual who is employed by a university \n25  could be held liable for violating the Equal Protection Clause because the school’s athletic \n26 \nadministration as a whole chose to comply with Title IX by expanding opportunities for women rather \n27 \nthan cutting opportunities for men in order to make the participation numbers more proportional. \n28 \n29 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(00881772,130C) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 34 of 43\n1  The regulations, Interpretation, Clarification, and case law also make it clear that a school (and \n2  thus the employees of a school) does not have an obligation to establish identical teams for both \n3  genders: \n4  \"As noted above, there is not provision for the requirement of identical programs for men \nand women, and no such requirement will be made by the Department. ... In addition, the \n5 \nsport specific concept overlooks two key elements of the Title IX regulation. First, the \nregulation states that the selection of sports is to be representative of student interests and \n6 \nabilities. [citation]. A requirement that sports for the members of one sex be available or \n7  developed solely on the basis of their existence or development in the program for \nmembers of the other sex could conflict with the regulation where the interests and \n8 \nabilities of male and female students diverge. Second, the regulation frames the general \n9  compliance obligations of recipients in terms of program-wide benefits and opportunities. \n[citation] As implied above, Title IX protects the individual as a student-athlete, not as a \n10  basketball player or swimmer.\" \n1.1 \n(1979 Policy Interpretation, Exhibit 3 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,  p.  17, comments section; \n12 \n* \naccord Bryant v. Colgate University,  196 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8392  32 (June 11, 1996).) \n13 \nIt is equally inconceivable that employees of a university could be held liable for violating the \n14 \nEqual Protection Clause because the school chooses not to add a women’s intercollegiate wrestling \n15 \nteam simply because a handful of students ask for that. Title IX makes it clear that there must be a \n16 \nsufficient level of interest field a viable varsity team, and there must be intercollegiate competition \n17 \navailable in the geographic region where the school usually competes. These factors did not exist in \n18 \nregard to women’s wrestling. Neither the Equal Protection Clause nor case law under §1983 hold \n19 \nemployees of an educational institution to a higher standard effective accommodation of athletic \n20 \ninterests than the institution itself is held to. \n21 \n2,  The Scope of the Equal Protection  Claim  to be Tried \n22 \nThe §1983 claim is asserted against VANDERHOEF, FRANKS, WARZECKA, GILL-\n23 \nFISHER. Earlier in the case, this Court dismissed the §1983 claim against these individuals on the \n24 \ngrounds that it was subsumed by a concomitant Title IX claim. [Docket item 226,  pp.  33-38] While \n25 \nthis case was on appeal to the Ninth Circuit the Supreme Court issued its opinion in  Fitzgerald v. \n26 \nBarnstable School Committee, 555  U.S. 246 (2009), holding that a §1983 claim for gender \n27 \ndiscrimination in a school setting can be maintained concurrently with a Title IX claim. Accordingly, \n28 \n30 \nII1Ifl.UtJt4IM \n10088 1772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 35 of 43\n1  when the Ninth Circuit remanded this case back to this court for trial, the individual Defendants were \nbrought back into the suit. \n(cid:9)\n3  The Court has defined the § 1983 claim as \"the assertion that defendants violated the Equal \n4  Protection Clause by maintaining an athletics program that discriminates on the basis of gender.\" \n5  [Docket item 509, p.  35] Although the focus of this claim is on alleged discriminatory conduct towards \n6  the Plaintiffs, t4  it involves an assessment of the athletic program for women as a whole. \n(cid:9)\n7  3. Equal Protection and Intercollegiate Athletics \n(cid:9)\n8  In order to prevail on a § 1983 claim a plaintiff must prove that an individual defendant acted \n9  under color of state law, and that his/her acts deprived the plaintiff of a right guaranteed under the laws \n10  of the United States. For § 1983 claims based on a theory of violation of the Equal Protection clause, \n1.1  Plaintiffs must prove that the individual Defendants acted with the intent or purpose to discriminate \n12  against them because of their gender, or with deliberate indifference to a known and established \n687(91h \n13  violation of equal treatment.  (Lee v. City  of Los Angeles  250 F.3d 668,   Cir. 2001);  Flores v. \n1135(9th \n14  Morgan Hill Un?fiedSch.  Distr.  324 F.3d 1130,   Cir. 2003).) Discriminatory intent is shown \n15  when a decision maker selects or affirms a course of action \"because of’, not merely \"in spite of’ the \n16  actions adverse effects on an identifiable group.  (Personnel Adm ’r v. Feeney  442 U.S. 256, 279 \n17  (1979); Ashcroft v, Jkbal  129 S. Ct. 1937, 1948 (2009).) Stated otherwise, Plaintiffs must prove that \n18  each Defendant took action, or failed to take action, not for a neutral purpose but instead to discriminate \n19  against them because of their gender.  (Id.) \n(cid:9)\n20  This case presents a novel athletics equal protection claim. The overwhelming majority of \n21  cases applying the Equal Protection clause to athletic opportunities do so in the context of a girl \n22  seeking to play on a specific team for boys (or vice versa) and challenges to the constitutionality of \n23  \"separate but equal\" teams for males and females.  (See Barbara L. Pryor, Equal Protection Scrutiny of \n24  High School Athletics,  72 Ky. L.J. 935, 935-36.) Ninth Circuit case law considering equal protection \n25  in relation to athletic opportunities falls into the above categories.  (Clark v. Interscholastic \n26 \n27 \n14  in their Points of Law portion of the Joint Final Pretrial Statement, Plaintiffs defined the issue as whether the individual \n28  Defendants \"discriminated against Plaintiffs and women at U.C. Davis in the provision of intercollegiate athletic \nopportunities.\" (emphasis added). This case is not a class action. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their class claims in 2007 \nalong with their claims for injunctive relief, [Docket item 195] \n31 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n{00881772.D0C} \n\n(cid:9)\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 36 of 43\n(9th \n1  Association 695 F.2d 1126   Cir. 1982) [boy claimed equal protection violation based on not being \n2  allowed to participate on girls volleyball team].)15  The claim in this case is that there were inequitable \n3  participation opportunities at U.C. Davis on a program-wide basis, which in turn resulted in gender \n4  discrimination by the individual Defendants against the Plaintiffs. \n(cid:9)\n5  In its ruling on the recent motions for summary judgment filed by the individual Defendants in \n6  this case, the Court referred  Haffer v. Temple University,  678 F.Supp. 517 (E,D. Penn. 1987) for the \n7  proposition that \"where a University decides to ’sponsor intercollegiate athletics as part of its \n8  educational offerings, this program ’must be made available to all on equal terms’.\" [Docket item \n9  509, p.  25] The Court used this as part of its discussion on the legal standards applicable a §1993 \n10  claim against an individual (not an educational institution).  Haffer is an anomaly. The plaintiffs in \n11  that case initially based their claims entirely on Title IX.  Ud.  at p.  522, fn. 2.) However, after their \n12  suit was filed the Supreme Court decided  Grove City College v. Bell, supra  which (temporarily) \n13  ended the application of Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  (See  Diana Heckman,  Article: \n14  Scoreboard: A Concise Chronological Twenty-Five Year History of Title LI Involving Interscholastic \n15  and Intercollegiate Athletics, 7 Seton Flail J. Sports L. 391, 403-404 (2008)  [Grove City \"effectively \n16  nullified Title IX in the area of athletics\"].) The district court in  Haffer ordered the plaintiffs to strike \n17  most of their Title IX claim including the portions raising claims about the deficiencies and \n18  participation opportunities. (678 F.Supp. at  p.  522, fn. 2.) At the same time they were given the \n19  opportunity to amend their complaint to add federal constitutional claims.  (Id.) \n(cid:9)\n20  The Haffer court recognized the unique aspect of the case: \"This appears to be the first case to \n21  challenge the operation of an intercollegiate athletic program on federal equal protection grounds.\" \n22  (Id. at p.  522.) However, it did no more than summarily adjudicate some claims and find that a triable \n23  issue of material fact existed on others. The merits of the case were never reviewed by an appellate \n24 \n25 \n(cid:9)\n26  ’ There is one other Ninth Circuit case mentioning an equal protection claim challenging the equity of participation \nopportunities on a program-wide basis.  (Ridgeway v. Montana High School Association, 858  F.2d 579 (9  Cir. 1988).) That \n(cid:9)\n27  class action case came to the Ninth Circuit following a settlement reached via the use of a \"facilitator\" in lieu of litigation. \n(Id at p.  580-81.)  The Court of Appeals declined to address the legal merits of the equal protection claim because of the \n(cid:9)\n28  posture in which the case reached that court. (Id. at p.  589,) \n32 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 37 of 43\n1  court-it settled via a consent decree. (See Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Trial \n2  Brief) \n(cid:9)\n3  Following the passage of the passage of the Civil Rights Restoration Act (20 U.S.C. § 1638) in \n4  1988 which legislatively overruled  Grove City College v. Bell,  most claims relating to equitable \n5  participation opportunities in athletics have been litigated under Title IX.  See, e.g. Cohen v. Brown \n6  University, (Cohen 1), supra; Pederson v. Lousiana State University, supra; Boucher v. Syracuse \n7  University,  164 F.3d 113 (2d. Ch. 1998);  Barrett v. West Chester University,  2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n8  21095 (E.D. Pa. November 12, 2003). In doing so, courts have applied the three-part test set forth in \n9  the 1979 Policy Interpretation. These cases do not address the standard to be applied to a constitutional \n10  claim of unequal athletic participation opportunities asserted against a person who is employed by a \n.11  college or university, as opposed to the institution itself. Rather, the Policy Interpretation applies to \n12  the Title IX implementing regulation, which in turn applies only to institutions that receive federal \n13  funds. (34 C.F.R. §106.41.) \n(cid:9)\n14  The  Haffer  court looked at Temple University’s athletic program (not the acts of any \n15  individual defendants) and conducted an analysis that looked very much like a prong one analysis used \n16 \n16  in a Title IX case.   In sum, the most important takeaway point in the  Haffer case for purposes of the \n17  trial in this case is its citation to  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976) and the requirement that a \n18  plaintiff suing under the Equal Protection Clause prove both an invidious intent to discriminate on the \n19  basis of gender and that a state action had an adverse impact on her.  (Haffer, supra at p.  524.) \n(cid:9)\n20  Clark v. Interscholastic Association, supra,  addressed the issue of whether a \"policy of \n21  (cid:149) precluding boys from playing on girls’ interscholastic volleyball teams in Arizona high schools \n22  violates the equal protection clause.\"  (Id  at p.  1127) It did not address Title IX issues at all, most \n23  likely because boys in the Arizona high school system would not be considered the underrepresented \n24  sex in regard to athletic opportunity. The court did make reference to overall equality of athletic \n25  opportunity and noted that \"while a lack of overall equality of athletic opportunity certainly raises its \n26  own problems, the presence of such equality cannot by itself justify specific inequality of opportunity \n27 \n(cid:9)\n28  ’ The court also went through an analysis of money spent by Temple on items such as recruiting, coaching, and uniforms. \nIn Title IX parlance, this is known as the \"laundry list.\" Plaintiffs have only an effective accommodation of interests claim, \nnot a \"laundry list\" claim. \n33 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL \n0088 1772.

The question, then, is whether denying boys the particular opportunity to compete \n2  on a girls’ volleyball team, even when boys’ overall opportunity is not inferior to girls’, can be \n(cid:9)\n3  as substantially related to an important governmental interest.\"  (Clark, 695 F.2d at pp.  1130- \n4  31)  The court did not address the issue of how an overall ineffective accommodation claim under \n5  § 1983 may or must be squared with an effective accommodation claim under Title IX. \n(cid:9)\n6  4. The Individual Defendants Cannot be Held  to a Higher Standard Than the \n(cid:9) Institutional Defendant in Regard to Provision of Equal  Athletic \n7 \nOpportunities \n8 \n(cid:9)\nWARZECKA and GILL-FISHER spent their entire careers in the area of intercollegiate \n9 \nathletics. In the course of doing so they reasonably relied on Title IX regulations, interpretations, and \n10 \nclarifications, and their application to the women’s intercollegiate sport program at U.C. Davis. \n11 \nSimilarly, albeit on a more macro level, FRANKS and VANDERHOEF also relied on those authorities. \n12 \nIn determining whether Plaintiffs have met their burden of proving a violation of  §1983  by these \n13 \nindividuals, the Court must take Title IX requirements into account even though there are differences \n14 \n15  between it and  §1983  as identified in  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable. To do otherwise would completely \nundermine the specific dictates of the Department of Education and its Office for Civil Rights. Further, \n16 \n11  holding an individual liable based on a more demanding standard than established by Title IX law will \n18  have a severe chilling effect on the desire of any person to work in the field of intercollegiate athletics. \nAs the Court will hear during trial, none of the individual Defendants alone, perhaps with the exception \n19 \n20  of VANDERHOEF, had the authority to \"order\" U.C. Davis to comply under a particular prong or to \n21  add more opportunities for women. While VANDERHOEF may have theoretically had such authority, \n22  he would never exercise it alone in the absence of guidance from others who have expertise in the many \naspects of intercollegiate athletics. \n23 \n(cid:9)\n24  The Ninth Circuit has held (albeit in a different factual context) that complying with Title IX \n25  the  1979 Policy  Interpretation does not violate the Equal Protection clause.  (Neal, supra, at p. \n26  [stating that the constitutional analysis in other cases \"persuasively disposes of any serious constitut \n27  concerns that might be raised in relation to the OCR Policy Interpretation\"].) Other circuits have \n28  recognized that compliance with Title IX-- and attempts to comply with it-- do not violate \n34 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n10088 I 772.DOC} \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 39 of 43\n(6th \n1  protection requirements.  Miami University Wrestling Club v. Miami University  302 F.3d 608   Cit. \n2  2002) is a compelling example of the congruence of Title IX and Equal Protection clause law: \n3  \"In the case before us today, it is evident that Miami took the challenged actions in an \nattempt to comply with the requirements of Title IX, and, as we explain below, Miami \n4 \nwas successful in that attempt. Only if Title IX, its regulations or the Policy \nInterpretation are unconstitutional-- an issue not before us in this lawsuit-- could we hold \n5 \nthat Miami’s compliance with the law and the regulations is unconstitutional.\" \n6  (Id. at p. 614.) \n7  265(7th \nKelley v. Board of Trustees,  35 F.3d   Cir. 1994) is another good example \n8 \n\"Plaintiffs’ final argument is that the defendants’ decision to eliminate the men’s \n9  swimming program while retaining the women’s program denied them equal protection \nof law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. We do not agree. First, the record \n10  makes clear that the University considered gender solely to ensure that its actions did not \nviolate federal law. And insofar as the University actions were taken in an attempt to \n11 \ncomply with the requirements of Title IX, plaintiffs’ attack on those actions is merely a \n12  collateral attack on the statute and regulations and is therefore impermissible.\" \n(Id. at p. 272.) \n13 \nThis Court has ruled that Plaintiffs’ claims based on discrete events that occurred during \n14 \n2000/2001 school year are time-barred (see section V,  infra).  Thus, they are precluded by the statute \n15 \nlimitations from claiming that the individual Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause \n16. \nallegedly removing them from the wrestling team roster or requiring that all persons trying out for \n17 \n18  wrestling team compete on the same terms. [Docket item 509,  p.  22] Conversely, Plaintiffs cannot ar \nthat Defendants had an obligation under the Equal Protection clause to establish a separ \n19 \nintercollegiate wrestling team for women or set up a separate roster cap for females only. \n20 \nThe evidence will show that former Chancellor VANDERHOEF by necessity delegated the \n21 \nto day operations of the intercollegiate athletic program to the Athletic Director. He became involved: \n22 \nthe issue pertaining to the women wrestlers only because Assembly Member Thomson injected herse \n23 \ninto it at the request of her chief of staff. Indeed, Thomson and Reynolds would not agree to speak wi \n24 \nanyone other than the Chancellor himself until Sue Williams prevailed upon Thomson to listen to wh \n25 \nthe coaches and GILL-FISHER had to say. Plaintiffs’ contention that the head of a campus as large \n26 \nU.C. Davis should have personally handled their demand to be given a spot on an athletic team shows \n27 \nlack of understanding about nature of running a large organization. \n28 \n35 \nDEFENDANTS’ TRIAL BRIEF \n(0088 1772.DOC) \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 563    Filed 05/05/11   Page 40 of 43\nThe authority for overseeing intercollegiate athletics was delegated by VANDERHOEF to \n2  Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, who in turn delegated it to FRANKS. After recovering from t \n3  shock of receiving the memo from Plaintiffs regarding their claim of \"sexual discrimination,\" PRAM \n4  immediately contacted the Title TX compliance officer and started the process of addressing t. \n5  allegations of mistreatment. One week later, he notified the women that their request for reinstatemc \n6  on the team was granted. Ile met with them, even after they declined the reinstatement offer until th \n7  could consult with their attorney. Plaintiffs asked FRANKS about the establishment of a separate rosi \n8  caps for women; he asked others to look into that, including consulting with experts in the field, and g \n9  back to Plaintiffs quickly with the response. FRANKS also offered to reduce the minimum number \n10  students necessary to form a club team in wrestling. His actions were consistent with the commitment \n11  Title IX and gender equity issues he demonstrated from the time he first assumed responsibility I \n12  intercollegiate athletics, including but not limited to the efforts he put into the student referenda ti \n13  saved varsity athletics for all students. It must be remembered that FRANKS owed a duty of faimc \n14  and equality to all students-not just Plaintiffs. He could not agree to give them preferential treatment \n15  the expense of other students. \n(cid:9)\n16  WARZECKA’s actions towards gender equity speak for themselves. He picked up the ball \n17  expanding opportunities for women in 1996 and hasn’t stopped running with it yet. WARZEC \n18  accomplished significant improvements in gender equity under severe financial limitations. Under \n19  watch, women’s intercollegiate athletics expanded at a rate unsurpassed in campus history. He is \n20  victim of untrue accusations made by a disgruntled former coach, which were blindly adopted by \n21  and MANSOURIAN, and later MANCUSO. WARZECKA was involved in crafting a resolution to \n22  women wrestler’s complaint that was fair and equitable to all students. \n(cid:9)\n23  Finally, it is almost inconceivable that Plaintiffs have accused GILL-FISHER of \n24  discriminating against female students. They will have the opportunity during this trial to learn  ft \n25  about the woman they have sued for punitive damages. They will learn about her experiences as \n26  athlete in the 1960’s, and how events that occurred back then shaped her attitude towards athletics \n27  her passion to improve conditions for female athletes. They will learn about the many hours she  sr \n28  volunteering her time with organizations and committees dedicated to women’s athletics.

They will learn that when she had a discussion with two other women wrestlers in the spri \n.4  of 2000, who were in her office because they had not filled out the paperwork required to participate \n5  wrestling team practices, GILL-FISHER did not express distain for women wrestlers (as Plainti \n6  believe) but rather discussed ways in which they could develop the sport of women’s wrestling \n7  include competition with other teams rather than just practicing with each other. GILL-FISHER and \n8  of the other seasoned intercollegiate coaches knew one of the best ways to develop a nascent sport is \n9  the club sport program. Finally, they will learn how hurt and upset GILL-FISHER was to read and h \n(cid:149)10  false statements made by Plaintiffs and Burch that she had ordered the women removed from \n11  wrestling team roster. The evidence will show that Burch was the person who made the roster decisi \n12  but did not have the courage to tell Plaintiffs he did so. \n(cid:9)\n13  In sum, Defendants believe the evidence will show that their actions were consistent with \n14  IX and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. \n(cid:9)\n15  I,, \n(cid:9)\n16  STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS \n(cid:9)\n17  The Court and the Ninth Circuit have made a series of rulings regarding the statute of \n18  limitations.

[Id. at p.  21, fn. 9 & pp. 23-30] It also did not \n(cid:9)\n2  address the bar of the statute of limitations as applied to the § 1983 claim against the \n(cid:9)\n3  individual Defendants because it dismissed that claim on other grounds.  [Id. at pp.  33-38] \n(cid:9)\n4  April 23, 2008, Order on UNIVERSITY’s motion for summary judgment: This Court \n(cid:9)\n5  granted the UNIVERSITY’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiffs \n(cid:9)\n6  failed to provide it with notice before filing their Title IX claim. [Docket #368] \n(cid:9)\n7  April 20, 2010: the Ninth Circuit issued its amended opinion reversing the grant of summary \n(cid:9)\n8  judgment on the Title IX claim and reinstating the § 1983 claim against the individual \n(cid:9)\n9  Defendants  (Mansourian v. Regents, supra),  The Court of Appeals did not address the \n(cid:9)\n10  application of the statute of limitations to the Title IX claim. (cid:9) In response to \n(cid:9)\n11  Defendants/Appellees’ argument that reinstatement of the § 1983 claim would be an empty \n(cid:9)\n12  exercise because of the lower court’s ruling that the concomitant unequal treatment claim \n(cid:9)\n13  under Title IX was time barred, the Ninth Circuit overlooked this Court’s ruling on the \n(cid:9)\n14  motion for judgment on the pleadings and instead just referred to the earlier motion to \n(cid:9)\n15  dismiss. \"In fact, the district court considered and rejected the statute of limitations defense \n(cid:9)\n16  as to both the Title IX effective accommodation and § 1983 equal protection claims in \n(cid:9)\n17  response to UCD’s original motion to dismiss.\" (602 F.3d at p.  973.) \n(cid:9)\n18  December 8, 2010, Order on Individual Defendants’ motions for summary judgment: This \n(cid:9)\n19  Court ruled that the § 1983 claim is time-barred to the extent it arises \"from (1) the alleged \n(cid:9)\n20  purposeful removal of plaintiffs from the varsity wrestling program based on gender; and (2) \n(cid:9)\n21  the imposition of permanent barriers to the participation of plaintiffs in the varsity wrestling \n(cid:9)\n22  program through application of the wrestle-off policy.\" [Docket #509,  p.  221 The Court \n(cid:9)\n23  further ruled that the § 1983 claim is timely regarding the allegation of violation of \"the \n(cid:9)\n24  Equal Protection Clause by maintaining an athletics program that discriminates on the basis \n(cid:9)\n25  of gender.\"  [Id. at p.  35]  It recognized that the Ninth Circuit had failed to address all of its \n(cid:9)\n26  relevant statute of limitations rulings.

Defendants will address that \n3  motion in their opposition to it. \n4  The effect of the Court’s December 8, 2010 ruling on the remaining claim is somewhat \n5  confusing. In footnote 17 of that order, the Court stated that while the alleged removal of the women \n6  from the team roster and the purported erection of barriers to participation on the team due to the \n7  requirement that Plaintiffs try out just like other students are time-barred events, they \"may still be used \n8  as evidence in support of Plaintiffs’ timely claims of intentional, systemic discrimination.\" This is not \n9  a class action. Plaintiffs were not interested in participating in any sport other than wrestling. They did \n10  not enter U.C. Davis until 1998 at the earliest, and were gone by 2006. The time-barred events that \n11  took place during the 2000/2001 school year form the core of their claims. Without those events, it is \n12  difficult to understand what is left that actually pertains to them. \n13 \n14  VI, \n15 \n16  This Court is faced with deciding several novel issues that will likely set precedent for colleges \n17  and universities, as well as athletic administration personnel, throughout the nation. Defendants \n18  believe the evidence will show that they, along with many other dedicated University employees, have \n19  furthered the laudable goal of gender equity in intercollegiate athletics. \n20  Respectfully submitted, \n21  Dated: May 5, 2011 (cid:9) PORTER SCOTT \nA PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION \n22 \n23  By: /s/ Nancy J.

They  named  as  defendants  the  Regents  of  the  University of \n3  California  (erroneously  sued  as  the  \"Board  of  Regents  of  the \n4  University  of  California  at  Davis\")  (the  \"University\");  Lawrence \n5  Vanderhoef,  Chancellor  of  the  University;  Robert  Franks, \n6  Associate  Vice  Chancellor,  Student  Affairs;  Greg  Warzecka, \n7  University Athletic  Director;  and  Pam  Gill-Fisher  and  Lawrence \n8  Swanson,  Associate  Athletic  Directors  (collectively,  \"individual \n9  defendants\"). \n10  Plaintiffs  assert  six claims  for  relief:  (1)  violation of \n11  Title  IX  by  the  University,  only,  for  failure  to  provide  female \n12  athletes  with  the  same  athletic  opportunities  as  male  athletes; \n13  (2)  violation of  Title  IX  by  the  University,  only,  for  failure  to \n14  provide  female  athletes  with  the  same  opportunities  for  financial \n15  assistance  as  male  athletes;  (3)  retaliation  in violation of \n16  Title  IX  and  its  interpretive  regulation by  the  University,  only; \n17  (4)  violation of  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  on  an  equal  protection  theory; \n18  said  claim  is  asserted  against  the  University  for  injunctive \n19  relief  and  against  the  individual  defendants  for  damages;  (5) \n20  violation of  the  California  Unruh  Civil  Rights  Act  by  all \n21  defendants;  (6)  violation of  public  policy based  on  various \n22  California  statutes  by  all  defendants.2 \n23  By  this  motion,  defendants  move  to  dismiss  (1)  plaintiffs' \n24  Title  IX  retaliation claim on  the  basis  that  there  is  no  private \n25 \n26  Plaintiffs  Chiang  and  Ng  assert  each  of  these  claims \n2 \nindividually.  Plaintiffs  Mansourian  and  Mancuso  assert  said \n27  claims  individually and  as  class  representatives,  except  in \nregard  to  the  retaliation claim.  The  Title  IX  retaliation claim \n28  is  not  asserted  as  a  class  claim. \n2 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 3 of 17\n1  right  of  action  for  retaliation under  Title  IX  and  (2) \n2  plaintiffs'  Title  IX,  Section  1983,  and  Unruh  Act  claims  on  the \n3  basis  of  the  statute of  limitations. 3 \n4  For  the  reasons  set  forth  below,  the  court  DENIES \n5  defendants'  motion  on  all  grounds. \n6  BACKGROUND \n7  Plaintiffs Mansourian,  Mancuso,  and  Chiang4  are  female \n8  students  at  the  University of  California  at  Davis  (\"UCD\").  They \n9  participated  in high  school  wrestling  and  chose  to  attend UCD \n10  because  it offered  them  the  opportunity  to participate  in \n11  wrestling  while  in  college.  (Compl.,  ~~  9-11,  24-51.)  Plaintiff \n12  Ng  also  participated  in high  school  wrestling  and  chose  to  attend \n13  UCD  in  order  to  wrestle;  however,  she  is no  longer  a  student  at \n14  UCD.  (Id.  at  ~~ 12,  52-58.)  Plaintiffs  allege  that  each  of  the \n15  defendants  is  responsible  for  the  discriminatory  actions  and \n16 \n17 \nDefendants  also  initially moved  to  dismiss  (1) \n3 \nplaintiff Ng's  claims  for  injunctive  relief  and  (2)  plaintiffs' \n18 \nSection  1983  claim  for  injunctive  relief  against  the  University \nand  for  damages  against  the  individual  defendants  in  their \n19 \nofficial  capacities.  As  to  plaintiff Ng's  purported  claims  for \ninjunctive  relief,  plaintiffs  clarified in  their opposition  that \n20 \nsince  plaintiff Ng  no  longer  is  a  student  at  the  University,  she \nseeks  by  this  action  only monetary  damages  for  her  lost  athletic \n21 \nbenefits,  lost  scholarship,  and  related damages.  This  basis  for \ndismissal  is  therefore  moot.  As  to  plaintiffs'  Section  1983 \n22 \nclaim,  the  parties  stipulated  to  the  dismissal  of  the  Section \n1983  claim against  the  University  in exchange  for  defendants' \n23  representation  that  the  individual  defendants  have  authority  to \nprovide  the  injunctive  relief  sought  by  plaintiffs.  The  parties \n24  further  stipulated  that  under  Section  1983,  plaintiffs  seek \nprospective  injunctive  relief  against  the  individual  defendants \n25  in  their official  capacities  and  monetary  damages  against  the \nindividual  defendants  in  their personal  capacities.  (Stip.  re \n26  Mot.  to  Dismiss,  filed April  29,  2004.) \n27  Chiang  is  currently on  leave  from  UCD  but  plans  to \n4 \nreturn  to  school  in  the  fall.  (PIs.'  Opp'n,  filed April  16, \n28  2004,  at  1  n.  1.) \n3 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 4 of 17\n1  decisions  set  forth  in  the  complaint.  (rd.  at  ~~ 21-22.) \n2  UCD  has  provided  athletic participation opportunities  in \n3  wrestling  to  male  students  for  many  years.  rn  the  early 1990's \n4  it began  providing  such  opportunities  to  female  students, \n5  including  a  women's  division  in  the  university's  annual  \"Aggie \n6  Open\"  wrestling  tournament.  (rd.  at  ~~ 82-83.)  Some  of  UCD's \n7  female  wrestlers  went  on  to  national  and  international  acclaim \n8  after having  trained  at  and  received  the  benefits  of  wrestling  at \n9  UCD.  (rd.  at  ~~ 85-87.) \n10  Plaintiffs  chose  to  attend UCD  because  of  that  history and \n11  because  of  the  promise  of  opportunities  to  participate  in \n12  wrestling  at  UCD.  (rd.  at  ~~ 26-29,  37-40,  45-46,  55-56.) \n13  Plaintiffs Mansourian,  Chiang,  and  Ng  filled out  the  NCAA  and  UCD \n14  paperwork  necessary  for  intercollegiate  athletics,  completed  the \n15  weight  certification requirements  for  intercollegiate wrestling, \n16  and  participated  in UCD's  wrestling program  for  about  2  years. \n17  (rd.  at  ~~ 27-30,  46-50,  55-59.)  As  varsity wrestlers, \n18  plaintiffs  received  benefits  such  as  medical  and  athletic \n19  training  services,  laundry  services,  academic  tutoring  services, \n20  strength and  conditioning  coaching,  wrestling  coaching, \n21  insurance,  access  to  the  weight  room,  and  access  to  varsity \n22  facilities.  (rd.  at  ~~ 33,  51,  58.) \n23  Plaintiff Mancuso  was  recruited  to  wrestle  for  UCD.  She  was \n24  awarded  an  athletic  scholarship  to  do  so.  She  enrolled,  filled \n25  out  the  necessary paperwork,  and  received  the  required \n26  certifications  to participate  in  intercollegiate wrestling. \n(rd~ \n27  at  ~~ 40-42.)  Shortly  thereafter,  however,  defendants  eliminated \n28  women  from  UCD's  wrestling program  and  Mancuso  was  denied  her \n4 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 5 of 17\n1  scholarship.  (Id.  at  ~~ 59-60.) \n2  During  the  2000-2001  academic  year,  defendants  eliminated \n3  wrestling  athletic  participation opportunities  for  female,  but \n4  not  male,  students  (the  \"No  Females  Directive\").  (Id.  at  ~~ 60-\n5  62.)  Plaintiffs  and  then-wrestling  coach Michael  Burch  protested \n6  this  decision.  Plaintiffs met  with  and/or  complained  to \n7  defendants,  asserting  that  the  No  Females  Directive  constituted \n8  illegal  sex  discrimination.  Defendants  ignored  the  complaints. \n9  (Id.  at  ~~ 63-69.)  Plaintiffs  filed  a  complaint  with  the  Office \n10  for  Civil  Rights  of  the  United  States  Department  of  Education \n11  (\"OCR\")  in  the  Spring  of  2001.  (Id.  at  ~  67.)  Defendants  later \n12  agreed  to  rescind  the  \"No  Females  Directive\"  and  to  allow women \n13  to  participate  in wrestling.  (Id.  at  ~  70-74.) \n14  Plaintiffs,  including  newcomer  Mancuso,  enrolled at  UCD  for \n15  the  2001-2002  academic  year  in  reliance  upon  defendants'  promised \n16  reinstatement  of  female  wrestling participation opportunities. \n17  They  filled out  their NCAA  and  UCD  eligibility paperwork, \n18  completed  the  weight  certification requirements  for  varsity \n19  wrestling,  and  were  deemed  eligible.  (Id.  at  ~  75.) \n20  Unfortunately,  plaintiffs  returned  to  a  wrestling  team  with  a  new \n21  coach  who  did  not  support  women  wrestlers  and  failed  to  coach \n22  them  or  treat  them  like  the  male  wrestlers.  (Id.  at  ~~ 75-76.) \n23  Defendants  informed  plaintiffs  that  to  participate  in wrestling \n24  they  would  have  to  be  part  of  a  mixed  gender  team  and  would  have \n25  to  beat  the  men  at  their weight  class  under  men's  collegiate \n26  style  rules,  even  though  the  women  had  previously only \n27  participated as  part  of  a  women's  wrestling program  (not  a  mixed \n28  gender  team)  using  international  freestyle  wrestling  rules.  (Id. \n5 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 6 of 17\n1  at  ~  77.)  Plaintiffs  again  complained,  but  defendants  refused \n2  and  continue  to  refuse  to  remedy  the  situation and  to provide \n3  them  with women's  wrestling  opportunities.  (rd.  at  ~~ 75-79.) \n4  As  a  result,  to  date,  no  women  are  allowed  to  participate  in UCD \n5  wrestling.  (rd.) \n6  As  current  UCD  students  who  are  currently being  denied  equal \n7  educational  benefits,  plaintiffs Mansourian,  Mancuso,  and  Chiang \n8  seek  an  injunction  requiring  defendants  to  increase  athletic \n9  participation and  scholarship  opportunities  for  female  students, \n10  specifically in  the  sport  of  wrestling.  (rd.  at  ~~ 32-33,  42, \n11  51,  120-123.)  Because  UCD  wrestling participates  at  the  NCCA \n12  Division  r  level  with  nationwide  recruitment  and  scholarships, \n13  plaintiffs  allege  that  defendants  could  recruit  and  maintain  a \n14  full  women's  wrestling  team  now  and  in  the  future.  (rd.  at  ~~ \n15  80-81,  125-135.)  Plaintiffs,  including  plaintiff Ng,  also  seek \n16  monetary  and  punitive  damages  for  defendants'  denial  of  these \n17  educational  benefits,  lost  scholarship  money,  and  the \n18  humiliation,  emotional  distress  and  related harm  caused  by \n19  defendants'  sex  discrimination.  (rd.  at  55-56.) \n20  STANDARD \n21  On  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure \n22  12(b) (6),  the  allegations  of  the  complaint  must  be  accepted  as \n23  true.  Cruz  v.  Beto,  405  U.S.  319,  322  (1972).  The  court  is \n24  bound  to  give  the  plaintiff  the  benefit  of  every  reasonable \n25  inference  to  be  drawn  from  the  \"well-pleaded\"  allegations  of  the \n26  complaint.  Retail  Clerks  rnt'l Ass'n v.  Schermerhorn,  373  U.S. \n27  746,  753  n.6  (1963).  Thus,  the  plaintiff need  not  necessarily \n28  plead  a  particular  fact  if  that  fact  is  a  reasonable  inference \n6 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 7 of 17\n1  from  facts  properly alleged.  See  ide \n2  Given  that  the  complaint  is  construed  favorably  to  the \n3  pleader,  the  court  may  not  dismiss  the  complaint  for  failure  to \n4  state  a  claim unless  it appears  beyond  a  doubt  that  the  plaintiff \n5  can  prove  no  set  of  facts  in  support  of  the  claim which  would \n6  entitle him  or her  to  relief.  Conley V.  Gibson,  355  U.S.  41,  45 \n7  (1957).  In  ruling  upon  a  motion  to  dismiss,  the  court  may \n8  consider  only  the  complaint,  any  exhibits  thereto,  and  matters \n9  which  may  be  judicially noticed pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of \n10  Evidence  201. 5  See  Mir  V.  Little  Co.  Of  Mary  Hospital,  844  F.2d \n11  646,  649  (9th  Cir.  1988). \n12  ANALYSIS \n13  A.  Title  IX  Retaliation  Claim \n14  The  question  of  whether  Title  IX  provides  a  private  right  of \n15  action  for  retaliation  is  an  issue  of  first  impression  in  the \n16  Ninth  Circuit.  However,  on  March  16,  2004,  this  court  issued  an \n17  order  in  the  case  of  Burch,  et  ale  V.  Board  of  Regents  of  the \n18 \n19  Rule  201  permits  a  court  to  take  judicial  notice  of  an \n5 \nadjudicative  fact  \"not  subject  to  reasonable  dispute,\"  in  that \n20  the  fact  is  either  \"(1)  generally known  within  the  territorial \njurisdiction of  the  trial  court  or  (2)  capable  of  accurate  and \n21  ready  determination  by  resort  to  sources  whose  accuracy  cannot \nreasonably  be  questioned.\"  Fed.  R.  Evid.  201(b).  The  court  can \n22  take  judicial  notice  of  matters  of  public  record,  such  as \npleadings  in another  action  and  records  and  reports  of \n23  administrative  bodies.  Emrich  V.  Touche  Ross  & Co.,  846  F.2d \n1190,  1198  (9th  Cir.  1988).  Here,  the  existence  of  plaintiffs' \n24  OCR  complaints  may  be  judicially noticed  by  this  court.  See \n~, Pavone  V.  Citicorp  Credit  Services,  60  F.  Supp.  2d  1040, \n25  1045  (S.D.  Cal.  1997).  The  truth of  the  allegations  contained \ntherein,  however,  is  not  subject  to  judicial  notice.  See \n26  Southern  Cross  Overseas  Agencies,  Inc.  V.  Wah  Kwong  Shipping \nGroup  Ltd.,  181  F.3d  410,  427  (3d  Cir.  1999).  Plaintiffs' \n27  objection  to  defendants'  request  for  judicial  notice  is  therefore \nOVERRULED,  although  reliance  on  said evidence  is  not  necessary  to \n28  the  decision  on  the  instant  motion.

No.  S-04-0038 \n2  WBS/GGH,  wherein  Judge  Shubb  found  that  Title  IX  provides  a \n3  private  right  of  action  for  retaliation. 6  (Mem.  & Order,  filed \n4  March  16,  2004,  denying  defendants'  motion  to  dismiss.)  The \n5  court  finds  no  basis  to  depart  from  that  order  herein;  the  issue \n6  before  Judge  Shubb  was  precisely the  same  as  the  issue  in  this \n7  case,  and  the  court  finds  Judge  Shubb's  reasoning  and  analysis \n8  throuough  and  persuasive.  (Id.)  Accordingly,  it does  not  repeat \n9  that  analysis  here  but  rather  adopts  the  order  in  full,  applying \n10  it to  the  instant  case  to  deny  defendants'  motion  to  dismiss \n11  plaintiffs'  Title  IX  retaliation claim. \n12  As  Judge  Shubb  made  clear,  while  Alexander  v.  Sandoval,  532 \n13  U.s.  275  (2001)  may  inform  this  court's  decision  on  the  matter, \n14  it does  not  require  a  finding  of  no  private  right  of  action  for \n15  retaliation.  Alexander  did  not  consider  the  question  of  whether \n16  retaliation was  within  the  scope  of  Title  IX's  prohibition of \n17  intentional  discrimination.  In  answering  this  question \n18  affirmatively,  Judge  Shubb  correctly relied on  the  case  of  Peters \n19  v.  Jenney,  327  F.3d  307  (4th  Cir.  2003)  (finding  a  private  right \n20  of  action  for  retaliation under  Title  VI).  This  court  agrees \n21  that  the  Fourth  Circuit's  opinion  on  this  issue  is more \n22  persuasive  than  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  opinion  in Jackson  v. \n23 \n24  6  The  plaintiff  in  that  case,  Michael  Burch,  was  the \nformer  UCD  wrestling  coach;  Burch  alleges  he  was  terminated  for \n25  supporting  plaintiffs'  desire  to participate  in varsity \nwrestling.  Burch  alleges  violations  of  Title  IX  and  the  First \n26  Amendment.  He  sues  the  same  defendants  as  plaintiffs herein. \nAlthough  both  cases  raise  a  similar  legal  issue  of  retaliation \n27  under  Title  IX,  due  to  the  factual  dissimilarities  of  the  cases \nand  the  class  action  component  of  this  case,  this  court  declined \n28  to  formally  relate  the  cases  under  Local  Rule  83-123.  (Non \nRelated  Case  Order,  filed  Feb.  2,  2004.) \n8 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 9 of 17\n1  Birmingham  Bd.  of  Educ.,  309  F.3d  1333  (11th  Cir.  2002),  the  only \n2  other  circuit  court  to  address  the  issue.  The  Eleventh  Circuit \n3  did  not  adequately  consider  the  possibility that  the  anti-\n4  retaliation regulation  simply  applies  Title  IX's  statutory ban  on \n5  intentional  discrimination.  Finally,  in  reaching  the  decision  to \n6  apply  Judge  Shubb's  order  in Burch,  the  court  finds  particularly \n7  important  Supreme  Court  decisions  which  have  interpreted \n8  statutory prohibitions  of  discrimination  to  ban  retaliation as \n9  well.  Sullivan v.  Little Hunting  Park,  Inc.,  396  U.S.  229 \n10  (1969);  Perry v.  Sindermann,  408  U.S.  593  (1972). \n11  For  all  the  reasons  set  forth  above  and  in  the  Burch  order, \n12  the  court  denies  defendants'  motion  to  dismiss  plaintiffs'  Title \n13  IX  retaliation claim. \n14  B.  Statute  of  Limitations \n15  1.  Title  IX \n16  Defendants  seek  to  dismiss  plaintiffs'  Title  IX  claims, \n17  including plaintiffs'  Title  IX  retaliation claim,  on  the  basis  of \n18  the  statute  of  limitations.  Title  IX,  20  U.S.C.  §  1681  et  seq., \n19  does  not  specify a  limitations  period.  When  Congress  fails  to \n20  specify a  statute  of  limitations  for  a  federal  claim  for  relief, \n21  courts  are  to  apply  the  most  closely analogous  statute  of \n22  limitations  under  state  law.  Reed  v.  United  Transp.  Union,  488 \n23  U.S.  319,  323  (1989).  The  Ninth  Circuit  has  not  considered  the \n24  issue  under  Title  IX;  however,  the  other  federal  appellate  courts \n25  that  have  considered  the  issue  are  in  accord  that  a  Title  IX \n26  claim  is most  closely analogous  to  a  common  law  action  for \n27  personal  injury.  Doe  v.  Howe  Military School,  227  F.3d  981,  987 \n28  (7th  Cir.  2000);  M.H.D.  v.  Westminster  Schools,  172  F.3d  797,  803 \n9 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 10 of 17\n1  (11th  Cir.  1999) i  Lillard v.  Shelby  County  Bd.  of  Educ.,  76  F.3d \n2  716,  729  (6th  Cir.  1996) i  Egerdahl  v.  Hibbing  Community  College, \n3  72  F.3d  615,  618  (8th  Cir.  1995) i  Bougher  v.  University of \n4  Pittsburgh,  882  F.2d  74,  77-78  (3rd  Cir.  1989).  Moreover,  in \n5  Taylor  v.  Regents  of  the  University  of  California,  993  F.2d  710, \n6  712  (9th  Cir.  1993),  the  Ninth  Circuit  came  to  the  same \n7  conclusion  with  respect  to  a  Title VI  claim.  In  light  of  this \n8  authority,  and  the  fact  that  Title  IX  is  to  be  construed \n9  consistently with  Title VI,7  the  court  applies  California's \n10  statute of  limitations  for  personal  injury actions  to  plaintiffs' \n11  Title  IX  claims. 8 \n12  In  California,  an  aggrieved party must  commence  an  action \n13  for  personal  injury caused  by  an  alleged wrongful  act  or  neglect \n14  within  two  years  of  the  act.  Cal.  Code  Civ.  Proc.  §  335.1.  The \n15  two-year  limitations  period  is  a  recent  development.  Before \n16  2003,  the  limitations  period  for  personal  injury  claims  was  one \n17  year.  Cal.  Code  Civ.  Proc.  §  340(3),  repealed.  Section  335.1 \n18  became  effective  January  1,  2003.  This  recent  amendment  impacts \n19  this  case,  which  was  filed  December  18,  2003. \n20 \n21 \nSince  Title  IX  has  identical  statutory language  to \n7 \n22  Title VI,  except  for  the  substitution of  the  word  \"sex\"  in Title \nIX  to  replace  the  words  \"race,  color,  or  national  origin\"  in \n23  Title VI,  the  Supreme  Court  has  interpreted both  statutes \ninterchangeably.  Cannon  v.  University of  Chicago,  441  U.S.  677, \n24  694-99  (1979). \n25  Plaintiffs'  argument  to  the  contrary,  based  on  one \n8 \nNorthern  District  of  California  decision,  is  unavailing.  Kramer \n26  v.  Regents  of  the  University of  California,  81  F.  Supp.  2d  972 \n(N.D.  Cal.  1999)  (applying  California's  three-year  statute  of \n27  limitations  for  actions  \"upon  a  liability created by  statute\"  to \nADA  and  Rehabilitation Act  claims).  In  the  Title  IX  context,  it \n28  is  contrary  to  the  weight  of  the  authority described  above,  most \nparticularly Taylor. \n10 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 11 of 17\n1  A  legislative  extension  of  the  statute  of  limitations  period \n2  will  extend  the  limitations  period  of  an  actionable  claim  if the \n3  extension  occurs  before the  claim  for  relief  becomes  time  barred \n4  under  the  old  limitations period.  Douglas  Aircraft  Co.  v. \n5  Cranston,  58  Cal.  2d  462,  465  (1962).  On  the  other hand,  once  a \n6  claim  is  time  barred  it will  not  be  revived  by  the  extension  to \n7  the  applicable  limitations  period unless  the  legislature \n8  expressly declared  that  the  amendment  of  the  limitations  period \n9  applied  retroactively.  Bartman  v.  Estate  of  Bartman,  83  Cal. \n10  App.  3d  780,  787-78  (1978).  Such  an  expression  of  retroactivity \n11  was  made  here  only  for  victims  of  the  terrorist  attacks  of \n12  September  11.  Cal.  Code  Civ.  Proc.  §  340.10(b). \n13  Defendants  argue  that  plaintiffs'  Title  IX  claims  are  based \n14  on  events  beginning  in  the  Fall  of  2000,  when  the  \"No  Females \nH \n15  Directive was  issued  and  ending,  at  the  latest,  in  the  Fall  of \n16  2001,  when  after their  initial OCR  complaint  was  resolved, \n17  plaintiffs were  placed  back  on  the  team  but  under  different \n18  conditions--conditions  that  plaintiffs'  allege  prevented  them \n19  from  participating  in wrestling. 9  The  statute  of  limitations \n20  then  in effect  was  one  year,  and  defendants  thus  argue \n21  plaintiffs'  claims  were  required  to  be  filed  no  later than  the \n22  Fall  of  2002. \n23 \n24  Specifically with  respect  to  plaintiffs'  retaliation \n9 \nclaim,  defendants  contend  plaintiffs have  alleged  four \n25  \"retaliatoryH  acts,  the  last  of  which  occurred  in  the  Fall  of \nH \n2001:  (1)  defendants  instituted the  \"No  Females  Directive in  the \n26  Fall  of  2000;  (2)  the  University  reneged  on  the  promise  to  remedy \nH \nthe  \"No  Females  Directive in  the  Fall  of  2001;  (3)  the \n27  University  allowed  the  female  wrestlers  a  chance  to  wrestle \nagainst  the  male  wrestlers  for  a  position on  the  men's  wrestling \n28  team  in  the  Fall  of  2001;  and  (4)  the  University did  not  renew \nMichael  Burch's  contract  in mid-2001. \n11 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 12 of 17\n1  Defendants'  argument  ignores  other  allegations  of \n2  plaintiffs'  complaint.  Plaintiffs Mansourian,  Mancuso,  and \n3  Chiang  are  current  UCD  students  who  are  currently being  subjected \n4  to  defendants'  allegedly  sex  discriminatory practices.  (Compl., \n5  ~~ 9-11,  22,  85-86,  88,  89.)  As  UCD  students,  their  claims \n6  accrue  each  and  every  day  they  are  denied  equal  access  to \n7  athletic  participation and  scholarship  opportunities.  (rd.  at  ~~ \n8  22,  66,  88-89.  133,  159.)  At  the  time  plaintiffs'  filed  the \n9  instant  complaint,  plaintiffs  allege  they  should  have  been \n10  wrestling  for  ueD  and  receiving  all  the  varsity benefits  and \n11  scholarships  provided  to  male  wrestlers  but  defendants  refused, \n12  and  continue  to  refuse,  to  date,  to  allow  their participation. 1o \n13  (rd.  at  ~~  9-12,  32,  42,  66,  88-89.)  They  have  thus  stated  facts \n14  sufficient  to  withstand  a  motion  to  dismiss,  regardless  of  what \n15  statute  of  limitations  applies  (one  or  two  year) . \n16  As  plaintiffs acknowledge,  plaintiff Ng  presents  a  slightly \n17  different  situation since  she  is no  longer  a  UCD  student. \n18  Similar  to  plaintiffs Mansourian,  Mancuso,  and  Chiang,  plaintiff \n19  Ng  alleges  that  each  and  every  day  she  attended ueD  she  was \n20  entitled to  the  same  access  to  athletic  participation and \n21  scholarship  opportunities  in wrestling  as  the  male  students. \n22  Plaintiffs  thus  argue  that  the  statute of  limitations  on  Ng's \n23  claims  did  not  begin  to  run  until  she  left ueD.  However,  the \n24  complaint  does  not  allege  when  she  left  ueD. \n25 \n26 \nAs  to  the  retaliation claim  in particular,  plaintiffs \n10 \n27  allege  defendants  retaliated against  them  and  continue  to \nretaliate  against  them  by,  among  the  other  things  set  forth  in \n28  footnote  9,  continuing  to  refuse  and  failing  to  treat  female \nathletes,  especially wrestlers,  equitably.  (rd.  at  ~~ 147-160.) \n12 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 13 of 17\n1  Failure  to  allege  said date  is  not  fatal  to  plaintiff Ng's \n2  claims.  See  Jablon v.  Dean  Witter  & Co.,  614  F.2d  677,  682  (9th \n3  Cir.  1980)  (dismissal  based  upon  statute of  limitations proper \n4  only  if complaint,  read  with  the  required  liberality,  makes  it \n5  impossible  for  plaintiff  to  claim any  set  of  facts  that  would \n6  make  her  claim  timely).  It  is possible  given  the  facts  alleged \n7  in  the  complaint,  that  plaintiff Ng  left  UCD  within  the \n8  applicable  statute of  limitations.  Because  the  court  must  accept \n9  the  facts  stated  in  the  complaint  as  true,  and  must  construe  them \n10  in  favor  of  Ng,  the  court  must  likewise  deny  the  motion  to \n11  dismiss  as  to  her  since  there  is  a  set  of  facts  in which  her \n12  claim would  survive. 11  Certainly  if  it  is  later discovered \n13  during  discovery  that  plaintiff Ng  left  UCD  outside  the  statute \n14  of  limitations  period,  defendants  can  seek  dismissal  by  a  motion \n15  for  summary  judgment. \n16  With  respect  to  the  above  findings,  the  court  makes  a  final \n17  point  of  clarification in  light  of  the  briefing  submitted  on  the \n18  motion.  While  the  court  finds  that  plaintiffs'  Title  IX  claims \n19  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss  under  Rule  12(b) (6),  the  court  does \n20  not  determine  herein whether  any  portion of  said  claims  is \n21  otherwise  barred  by  the  applicable  statute  of  limitations.  See \n22  National  Passenger  Railroad  Corp.  v.  Morgan,  536  U.S.  101  (2002) \n23  (defining  the  \"continuing violations\"  doctrine  under  Title \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27  Because  the  court  reaches  this  finding,  it does  not \n11 \nconsider plaintiffs'  alternative  argument  regarding  equitable \n28  tolling during  the  OCR  investigation. \n13 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 14 of 17\n1  VII)  Under  Morgan,  defendants  argue  that  certain discrete \n.12 \n2  acts  of  discrimination  and/or  retaliation alleged by  plaintiffs \n3  in  the  complaint  are  not  actionable because  they  are  barred by \n4  the  statute  of  limitations;  to  the  contrary,  plaintiffs  contend \n5  that  Morgan  is  inapplicable  to  Title  IX,  and  even  if  it did \n6  apply,  the  Court  in Morgan  specifically excepted  from  its \n7  analysis  \"policy and  practice\"  cases  such  as  this  one.  These \n8  arguments  should  be  addressed  on  a  motion  for  summary  judgment. \n9  The  court  only  notes  herein  that  nothing  in  this  order prevents \n10  defendants  from  raising  these  arguments  in  a  motion  for  summary \n11  judgment. \n12  2 .  Section  1983  & Unruh  Act  Claims \n13  The  parties  do  not  dispute  that  the  applicable  statute  of \n14  limitations  for  plaintiffs'  Section  1983  claim  is  California's \n15  personal  injury  statute  of  limitations  described  above,  albeit \n16  one-year  before  January  1,  2003,  and  two-years  thereafter. \n17  Wilson  v.  Garcia,  471  U.S.  261  (1985).  As  to plaintiffs'  Unruh \n18  Act  claim,  however,  the  parties  dispute  the  applicable  statute  of \n19  limitations.  The  court  applies  California  law  and  finds  that \n20  California's  personal  injury  statute  of  limitations  likewise \n21  applies  to  plaintiffs'  Unruh  Act  claims.  Gatto  v.  County  of \n22 \n23  12  Morgan  overruled previous  Ninth  Circuit  authority \nholding  that,  if a  discriminatory  act  took  place  within  the \n24  limitations  period  and  that  act  was  \"related and  similar  to\"  acts \nthat  took  place  outside  the  limitations  period,  all  the  related \n25  acts,  including  the  earlier acts,  were  actionable  as  part  of  a \ncontinuing violation.  In Morgan,  the  Court  held  to  the  contrary \n26  that  \"discrete  discriminatory  acts  are  not  actionable  if time \nbarred,  even  when  they  are  related  to  acts  alleged  in  timely \n27  filed  charges.\"  RK  Ventures,  Inc.  v.  City  of  Seattle,  307  F.3d \n1045,  1061  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (quoting  Morgan,  122  S.  Ct.  at  2072) . \n28  Rather,  the  statute  of  limitations  begins  to  run  from  each \ndiscrete  act. \n14 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 25    Filed 05/06/04   Page 15 of 17\n1  Sonoma,  98  Cal.  App.  4th  744,  760  (2002)  (acknowledging  that  all \n2  Unruh  Act  violations  do  not  necessarily have  the  same  limitations \n3  period,  but  finding  that  civil  rights  torts  analogous  to  personal \n4  injury claims  are  governed  by  the  then  one-year  personal  injury \n5  limitations  period);  accord  West  Shield  Investigations  & Security \n6  Consultants  v.  Superior  Court,  82  Cal.  App.  4th  935,  951-52 \n7  (2000).  The  court  recognizes  that  the  Ninth  Circuit  has \n8  indicated  in Olympic  Club  v.  Those  Interested Underwriters  at \nth \n9  Lloyd's  London,  991  F.2d  497,  502  n.  11  (9 Cir.  1993)  that \n10  California's  three-year  statute of  limitations  for  actions  \"upon \n11  a  liability created by  statute\"  (Cal.  Code  Civ.  Proc.  §  338(a)) \n12  applies  to  Unruh  Act  claims;  however,  said  finding  was  dicta  and \n13  made  in a  footnote  without  analysis.  Later  state  court  decisions \n14  addressing  the  issue  have  expressly  rejected Olympic  Club  and \n15  held  that  the  limitations  period  is generally one  year  (now  two \n16  years)  for  civil  rights  torts  under  the  Unruh  Act.l3  See  Gatto, \n17  98  Cal.  App.  4th  at  760.  Moreover,  the  court  notes,  in  light  of \n18  its  finding  with  respect  to  plaintiffs'  Title  IX  claims,  a \n19  consistent  statute  of  limitations  should  apply  to  plaintiffs' \n20  Unruh  Act  claims  since  they  are  based  on  the  same  operable  facts. \n21  Thus,  for  the  same  reasons  as  set  forth  above,  defendants' \n22  motion  to  dismiss  plaintiffs'  Section  1983  and  Unruh  Act  claims \n23  is  denied;  plaintiffs'  allegations,  described  above,  sufficiently \n24  state  facts  within  the  applicable  statute of  limitations  (one  or \n25 \n26 \nThe  court  is  not  bound  to  follow  other district  court \n13 \n27  decisions  which  have  cited Olympic  Club  and  applied  California's \nthree-year  statute of  limitations  to  the  Unruh  Act.

All students, regardless of gender, should have\n2 equal access to participation in athletics.  Indeed, both the\n3 Constitution and federal law require it.\n4 This case arises out of plaintiffs Arezou Mansourian\n5 (“Mansourian”), Lauren Mancuso (“Mancuso”), and Christine Wing-Si\n6 Ng’s (“Ng”) (collectively “plaintiffs”) claims that defendants\n7 Regents of the University of California (the “University” or “UC\n8 Davis”), Larry1 Vanderhoef (“Vanderhoef”), Greg Warzecka\n9 (“Warzecka”), Pam Gill-Fisher (“Gill-Fisher”), and Robert Franks\n10 (“Franks”) (collectively, “defendants”) deprived them of the\n11 equal opportunity to participate in varsity2 athletics while they\n12 were students at UC Davis, in violation of both Title IX and the\n13 Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  Specifically,\n14 plaintiffs assert that they were wrongly deprived of their\n15 opportunity to participate in intercollegiate wrestling.  Through\n16 this suit, plaintiffs seek money damages and declaratory relief. \n17 Defendants assert that, at all relevant times, the UC Davis\n18 athletic program and each individual defendant complied with\n19 constitutional and federal mandates regarding gender equity. \n20 The court held a fifteen day bench trial from May 23, 2011\n21 through June 15, 2011.

Plaintiffs\n5 1. Plaintiff Christine Wing-Si Ng (“Ng”) entered UC Davis\n6 in Fall 1998 and graduated in September 2002.  (Am. Pretrial\n7 Conference Order (“Pretrial Order”) [Docket # 549], filed May 4,\n8 2011, ¶ 6.)\n9 2. Plaintiff Arezou Mansourian (“Mansourian”) entered UC\n10 Davis in Fall 2000 and graduated in June 2004.  (Id. ¶ 7.)\n11 3. Plaintiff Lauren Mancuso (“Mancuso”) entered UC Davis\n12 in Fall 2001 and received her degree in September 2006.  (Id. ¶\n13 8.)  Pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, her relevant time\n14 period at UC Davis is from Fall 2001 to December 2005.  (Trial\n15 Transcript (“TT”) 554:1-4; 2325:6-17.)\n16 II. History of Gender Equity in Intercollegiate Athletic\nParticipation Opportunities at UC Davis\n17\n18 4. UC Davis is a campus of the University of California\n19 system that receives federal funds for its educational programs\n20 and is subject to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\n21 (“Title IX”).  (Pretrial Order, Stipulations, ¶ 1.) \n22 5. The record is undisputed that since 1970, female\n23 students at UC Davis demonstrated great interest in athletic\n24 opportunities.  (See JX 14, 15; PX 7, 391.)  Indeed, hundreds of\n25 female students participated each year during the 1980s, 1990s,\n26\n27 3 To the extent that any of the court’s findings of fact\nmay be considered conclusions of law or vice versa, they are to\n28 be considered as such.\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 4 of 147\n1 and 2000s in club team sports such as archery, badminton,\n2 bowling, cycling, crew, fencing, equestrian, lacrosse, rifle,\n3 ski, water polo, and sychronized swimming.  (TT 1155:22-1156:5;\n4 1410:12-20; see PX 17, 391.)\n5 6. However, at all relevant times, females were the\n6 underrepresented sex in UC Davis’ intercollegiate athletics\n7 program.  (Pretrial Order, Stipulations, ¶ 1.)\n8 7. Before the passage of Title IX, UC Davis had a\n9 philosophy, set forth in “The Davis View” to offer\n10 intercollegiate athletics to the greatest number of students\n11 possible.  (TT 1836:14-18.)\n12 8. As early as May 27, 1970, UC Davis applied this\n13 philosophy to conclude that it was desirable to expand both its\n14 women’s and men’s intercollegiate athletic programs.  (JX 14, at\n15 FP.0749.)\n16 9. Based on the best recollection of those involved in the\n17 campus athletic program, when Congress enacted Title IX in 1972,\n18 UC Davis supported 7 intercollegiate sport teams for women: \n19 basketball, field hockey, swimming, softball, tennis, volleyball,\n20 and track & field.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 14.)4\n21 10. In January 1972, the UC Davis Women’s Intercollegiate\n22 Athletic Subcommittee, made up of students belonging to the\n23\n24 4 The governing entity for women’s intercollegiate sports\nat that time was the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for\n25 Women (“AIAW”).  (Pretrial Order ¶ 14.)  In 1981, UC Davis became\na member of the NCAA for purposes of women’s intercollegiate\n26 athletics.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 16.)  The NCAA does not prohibit a\nmember school from adding non-NCAA sports so long as a school\n27 meets the requirements for sport sponsorship minimums for its\ndivision.  (Id.)  At all relevant times, UC Davis met those NCAA\n28 requirements.  (Id.)\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 5 of 147\n1 Women’s Athletic Association (including defendant Gill-Fisher),\n2 prepared a report for the Intercollegiate Athletic Advisory\n3 Board.  The report was designed to show the current philosophies,\n4 practices and needs of the women’s intercollegiate athletic\n5 program at UC Davis, as well as trends at the local, regional,\n6 and national level.  (JX 15; TT 1616:10-1621:10)\n7 11. The report recommended that the campus add women’s\n8 gymnastics and badminton as intercollegiate sports.  (JX 15; TT\n9 1616:10-1621:10.)\n10 12. In 1974, UC Davis added women’s gymnastics as an\n11 intercollegiate sport.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 15; TT 1821:10.)  There\n12 is no evidence that women’s badminton was ever added as an\n13 intercollegiate sport. \n14 13. In or about 1976, Gill-Fisher chaired a committee to\n15 evaluate UC Davis’ compliance with Title IX.  (TT\n16 1613:24-1615:22.)\n17 14. In July 1978, Gill-Fisher co-authored a UC Davis Title\ninter alia\n18 IX compliance review, which recommended,  , that women’s\n19 cross-country be considered an intercollegiate sport for 1978. \n20 (JX 16; TT 1622:5-1623:12)\n21 15. In 1978, UC Davis upgraded women’s cross-country to\n22 intercollegiate status. (TT 1622:20-1623:6.) \n23 16. Subsequently, UC Davis discontinued women’s field\n24 hockey at the end of the 1982-1983 school year.  (Pretrial Order\n25 ¶ 17.)\n26 17. The discontinuation of women’s field hockey was done\n27 for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons; interest in the sport\n28\n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 6 of 147\n1 as well as viable competitive opportunities at the\n2 intercollegiate level were decreasing.5\n3 18. In the 1980s, interest in field hockey was on a\n4 downward slope as the number of teams nationwide decreased and\n5 the interest in field hockey in California high schools\n6 decreased.  (TT 1821:11-15; 1838:16-1839:4.)\n7 19. In the 1980s, only seven colleges in California played\n8 field hockey at all.  Over that decade, NOR-PAC, the conference\n9 in which UC Davis played field hockey, decreased in size from\n10 seven schools to three schools.  (TT 2461:2-5; 2462:21-2464:9.)\n11 20. Further, finding fields suitable for field hockey was a\n12 pervasive problem because field hockey requires an even,\n13 manicured surface that makes it difficult for field hockey teams\n14 to share fields with teams from other sports.  (TT\n15 2461:14-2462:19.)\n16 21. At the same time, interest and competition was\n17 increasing rapidly in women’s intercollegiate soccer.  (TT\n18 1821:11-15, 1838:4-1839:3; 1625:3-1627:7.) \n19 22. UC Davis evaluated the high schools, junior colleges,\n20 and universities in its area and saw many schools were offering\n21 soccer, with the result that UC Davis had a solid recruiting base\n22\n23 5 The court finds that plaintiffs failed to raise any\ncredible question regarding the decreasing level of competitive\n24\nintercollegiate opportunities through the testimony of Sharon\nGish (“Gish”), the UC Davis field hockey coach at the time the\n25 sport was eliminated.  Gish was not involved in the decision to\ndrop field hockey and could not recall whether UC Davis informed\n26 her of the reasons it chose to drop the sport.  (TT 2465:1-\n2466:1.)  Moreover, she had neither a consistent basis for\n27 knowledge nor a clear recollection of the competitive\nopportunities in field hockey subsequent to UC Davis’ elimination\n28 of the sport.\n6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 7 of 147\n1 and expectation of competition in women’s soccer.  (TT\n2 1626:21-1627:7.)\n3 23. As such, women’s field hockey was replaced by women’s\n4 intercollegiate soccer in the fall of 1983.  (Pretrial Order ¶\n5 17.)\n6 24. Thereafter, sometime in the late 1980s, UC Davis\n7 appointed Dennis Shimek as its Title IX Compliance Officer.6  (TT\n8 2331:5-9; 1858:2-16.)\n9 25. In 1989, UC Davis commenced a comprehensive Title IX\n10 review, which formed the foundation for UC Davis’ subsequent\n11 progress in program expansion for women student-athletes.  (JX\n12 17; TT 1630:9-1633:6; 1826:3-1827:2.)\n13 26. The review made findings that UC Davis was not in\n14 compliance with Title IX under any of part of the three prong\n15 test.7  (JX 17, at 10-17.)  Specifically, when compared to the\n16 enrollment rates of male and female students, the data collected\n17 in the review confirmed that UC Davis was offering men hundreds\n18 more athletic participation opportunities than women relative to\n19 enrollment.8  (JX 17, at 3763.)\n20\n6 The court notes that plaintiffs did not name Shimek as\n21 a defendant, even though he was the UC Davis official in charge\nof Title IX compliance.\n22\n7 See infra, at Conclusions of Law I.A.2.\n23\n8 The review also stated that UC Davis had eliminated a\n24\nwomen’s golf team.  (JX 17, at 12.)  However, UC Davis asserts\nthat it never eliminated women’s intercollegiate golf because it\n25 never sponsored it prior to its addition in 2004.  Based upon the\nsole mention of the alleged women’s golf team in the report\n26 without any other documentation or testimony to support its\nexistence, the court finds that UC Davis did not support a\n27 women’s varsity golf team prior to its addition in 2004.\n28 Similarly, “The Davis View” referred to women’s\n7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 8 of 147\n1 27. In accordance with the philosophy espoused in “The\n2 Davis View,” UC Davis preferred trying to add women’s teams\n3 rather than eliminate men’s teams in attempting to comply with\n4 Title IX. (TT 2342:24-2343:8; 646:2-12.) \n5 28. As such, the review resulted in a recommendation that\n6 UC Davis establish steps to increase women’s participation\n7 opportunities.  (JX 17, at 10-17.)\n8 29. Moreover, beginning in 1990, and continuing through\n9 1992, then Assistant Athletic Director Pam Gill-Fisher\n10 recommended that UC Davis eliminate the junior varsity football\n11 team to save funding and decrease the disparity between men’s and\n12 women’s intercollegiate athletic participation opportunities. \n13 (TT 1637:10-1638:19.)\n14 30. The January 10, 1991 Report on Intercollegiate\n15 Athletics, prepared by athletic department administrators,\n16 reported that women were receiving 300-400 fewer participation\n17 opportunities than men for each year from 1986 to 1991, and\n18 recorded a drop of 120 female participation opportunities from\n19 1989 to 1991 alone.  (PX 13, at DEF 1266.)\n20 31. On June 27, 1991, Gill-Fisher submitted a Title IX\n21 review to then Athletic Director Jim Sochor, noting the\n22 discrepancy in male and female participation rates and that no\n23 steps had been taken to increase athletic participation\n24 opportunities for women.  (JX 18.)\n25\n26\nintercollegiate competition in rifle.  (JX 14, at 5.)  Because\n27 there is no evidence that this sport was in existence at the time\nTitle IX was passed, the court finds the reference to women’s\n28 rifle to be irrelevant. \n8\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 9 of 147\n1 32. On December 20, 1991, Gill-Fisher submitted an update\n2 regarding Title IX compliance from June to December 1991, noting\n3 that participation opportunities remained a problem.  (JX 19; TT\n4 641:23-643:7.)\n5 33. On June 5, 1992, Gill-Fisher prepared the next Title IX\n6 review, again noting that participation opportunities were a\n7 major concern.  (JX 66.)\n8 34. In November 1992, Gill-Fisher wrote a Title IX\n9 compliance memorandum to then Athletic Director Keith Williams\n10 (“Williams”), warning of backsliding on movement toward Title IX\n11 compliance.  In order to deal with participation ratios, the\ninter alia\n12 memorandum recommended,  , eliminating all junior\n13 varsity teams, establishing roster caps for all sports, and\n14 adding women’s crew and women’s golf.  Gill-Fisher also warned\n15 that UC Davis needed to implement a plan to address participation\n16 ratios or risked facing an OCR complaint or potential lawsuit. \n17 (JX 22; TT 1646:2-1649:9.)\n18 35. In December 1992, Gill-Fisher alerted then Vice\n19 Chancellor for Student Affairs, Bob Chason, to participation\n20 ratio issue and potential solutions, including capping men’s\n21 rosters and adding women’s sports.  (JX 23; TT 1389:2-1389:25.)\n22 36. Junior varsity football and men’s junior varsity\n23 basketball were dropped following the recommendation from\n24 Gill-Fisher.  (JX 26; TT 1638:10-14; 649:11-651:12.)\n25 37. On May 27, 1993, Gill-Fisher wrote a strongly-worded\n26 Title IX report to Athletic Director Williams, again expressing\n27 major concern with participation ratios.  Specifically, the\n28 report noted that while football was mandated to have 180\n9\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 10 of 147\n1 participants, it still had 250.  The report also noted that there\n2 were 40 women on a national championship club water polo team and\n3 that there was strong interest in forming an intercollegiate\n4 women’s crew team.  Gill-Fisher stated her opinion that the\n5 University was not providing women with participation\n6 opportunities as required by law.  (PX 25.)\n7 38. Also in May 1993, Williams prepared a preliminary draft\n8 of a plan to address several Title IX concerns.  The draft plan\n9 included expansion of women’s sports opportunities combined with\n10 elimination of junior varsity football within the coming year.9\n11 The draft plan also noted that the current year participation\n12 ratios were 68% men and 32% women, but contemplated a 3-5 year\n13 timeline for achieving participation ratio compliance.  (JX 25;\n14 TT 670:13-674:2.)\n15 39. In 1992-1993, UC Davis was facing massive budget cuts\n16 that would have eliminated, among other things, state funds for\n17 athletics, resulting in a total program cut of about 70 percent.\n18 (TT 652:19-654:19; 1190:13-1192:16.)\n19 40. In response, UC Davis worked with student organizations\n20 to propose student referendums for additional fees to preserve\n21 the athletic program.  (TT 653:1-5; 1193:24-1195:18.)\n22 41. In 1993, students passed a referendum that provided for\n23 three years of additional student funding.  (TT 1196:5-11.)\n24 42. In 1994, students passed a second referendum (the\n25 “SASI” referendum) that provided for sufficient fee increases to\n26\n27 9 The plan expressly noted that the size of the football\nroster was an “almost impossible obstacle relative to Title IX.” \n28 (JX 25.) \n10\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 11 of 147\n1 preserve the current program and add three new women’s sports. \n2 (TT 690:6-24; 1196:12-1197:9.)\n3 43. UC Davis elevated women’s water polo, lacrosse, and\n4 crew from club status to varsity status.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 23.)\n5 44. The addition of the three new intercollegiate sports\n6 established 131 additional participation opportunities for women\n7 in the 1996-1997 school year, the first year those new teams\n8 competed.  (JX 89; TT 1393:8-10.)\n9 45. In December 1996, Gill-Fisher sent then Athletic\n10 Director Warzecka a memo, warning that although the addition of\n11 the new sports would improve the participation ratio for women’s\n12 athletic opportunities, it would not alone solve the\n13 participation opportunity discrepancy.  She recommended analyzing\n14 the size of the men’s teams to determine whether they were\n15 carrying more student-athletes than necessary for competition.\n16 (JX 35; TT 1661:13-1663:3; 1019:3-1020:2.)\n17 46. In December 1997, Dave Wampler of the UC Davis\n18 Administrative Athletic Advisory Committee (“AAAC”) sent then\n19 Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Franks and Warzecka\n20 a letter, noting the continuing disproportion of women’s\n21 participation rates based upon the “NCAA Gender Equity Survey, UC\n22 Davis 1996-1997.”  The AAAC recommended that the size of most\n23 men’s sports teams be reduced.  (JX 37; TT 1020:10-1021:8.)\n24 47. In November 1998, the difference between the female\n25 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n26 percentage was almost 12 percent.  (JX 89.)  Warzecka had a goal\n27 of achieving a participation ratio disparity of only 5 percent. \n28 (PX 54; TT 1022:20-1026:3.)\n11\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 12 of 147\n1 48. UC Davis implemented a roster management program for\n2 men’s intercollegiate teams as part of its efforts toward\n3 achieving substantially proportionate athletic participation\n4 opportunities.  Roster management was needed because some of the\n5 men’s teams were unnecessarily large in relation to how many\n6 competitors they needed, and the large numbers put a strain on\n7 the budget; trimming the excess participants helped address the\n8 participation ratio.  (TT 2064:20-2068:18; JX 35.)\n9 49. In December 1998, UC Davis Provost and Executive Vice\n10 Chancellor Grey appointed Gill-Fisher and members of a Title IX\n11 workgroup to advise the athletic department about Title IX\n12 issues.  A multi-year plan was to be established and monitored by\n13 the workgroup.  (PX 59; TT 2025:9-2028:10.)\n14 50. At the same time, Title IX reporting switched to a more\n15 collective approach involving the Title IX workgroup.  Warzecka\n16 testified that the change was made because he viewed Title IX\n17 compliance as a University-wide issue, not the responsibility of\n18 one individual.  (TT 2026:19-2028:10; see also TT\n19 2366:18-2367:9.)\n20 51. In the 1998-1999 school year, UC Davis declared women’s\n21 indoor track & field as a separate intercollegiate sport.  (TT\n22 2049:23-2050:9.)\n23 52. Although women had been competing in indoor track &\n24 field events as UC Davis student-athletes prior to the 1998-1999\n25 school year, (1) additional funding was allocated to expand the\n26 number of indoor track & field venues UC Davis women were able to\n27 travel to and compete at; (2) the NCAA changed its reimbursement\n28 rules allowing UC Davis to be eligible for reimbursement of\n12\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 13 of 147\n1 indoor track & field championship expenses; and (3) the EADA\n2 reporting template began listing indoor track & field as a\n3 separate sport from outdoor track & field.  (TT 2046:18-2050:19.) \n4 53. As such, the court finds that indoor track & field was\n5 elevated to varsity status in the 1998-1999 school year, and\n6 participation opportunities for female student-athletes increased\n7 as a result of this addition.10\n8 54. In May 1999, the Title IX Workgroup prepared a draft\n9 3-year plan for UC Davis athletics, noting that the participation\n10 rate of women athletes had risen to about 48 percent, but was\n11 still less than the 55 percent female undergraduate enrollment.\n12 The plan projected that further roster management of men’s teams\n13 would reduce the discrepancy of female athletic participation to\n14 5 percent in the next school year.  Ultimately, despite the\n15 application of a men’s roster management program, increasing\n16 female enrollment at the University kept the discrepancy at 6\n17 percent for 1999-2000.  (JX 43; TT 2028:13-20-2033:9.)\n18 55. As of October 2001, there were intercollegiate teams\n19 for women at UC Davis in 13 sports:  basketball, cross-country,\n20 gymnastics, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming/diving,\n21 tennis, outdoor track & field, indoor track & field, volleyball,\n22 and water polo.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 18.)\n23\n24 10 The court notes that the Ninth Circuit has previously\nheld that the dispute over how to characterize the addition of\n25 indoor track & field was irrelevant because, as set forth infra,\nin the 1999-2000 school year, “women varsity athletes at UCD\n26 reached a historic high in both total numbers and proportion of\nfemale athletes to enrolled women students.”  Mansourian v.\n27 Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 970 (9th Cir. 2010). \nHowever, for the sake of completeness and clarity, the court\n28 makes this finding.\n13\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 14 of 147\n1 56. As of that date, there were intercollegiate teams for\n2 men at UC Davis in 12 sports:  baseball, basketball,\n3 cross-country, football, golf, soccer, swimming/diving, tennis,\n4 outdoor track & field, indoor track & field, water polo, and\n5 wrestling.  (Id.)\n6 57. In 2001, the Title IX Workgroup prepared the Equity in\n7 Athletics Plan, which set forth a goal of achieving Prong One\n8 compliance via roster management and, if the female undergraduate\n9 population continued to increase, by adding new women’s sports.\n10 (JX 48, 49; TT 2054:21-2059:1.)\n11 58. In December 2003, the Title IX Workgroup issued a\n12 Gender Equity Strategic Review in the form of a table.  The\n13 review set a plan to “act on” club sports interest in obtaining\n14 varsity status, to “review” the student body regarding its\n15 interest in athletics, and to “evaluate” the athletic program to\n16 ensure it was complying with Title IX.  (DX GG; TT\n17 2366:18-2370:14.)\n18 59. In 2004, the Title IX Administrative Advisory Committee\n19 (formerly the Title IX Workgroup) issued a new review, now titled\n20 the ICA11 Strategic Plan 2004-2007, in a format to conform to\n21 NCAA membership committees’ forms.  The plan set out the action\n22 of adding women’s golf and continuing to implement and review\n23 roster management.  (DX MM; TT 2059:5-2060:10.)\n24 60. In 2004, UC Davis added women’s golf as an\n25 intercollegiate sport.  (TT 2159:7-2160:12; JX 81.)\n26\n27\n28 11 “Intercollegate Athletic”\n14\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 15 of 147\n1 61. As of December 2005, there were intercollegiate teams\n2 for women at UC Davis in 14 sports:  basketball, cross-country,\n3 golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball,\n4 swimming/diving, tennis, outdoor track & field, indoor track &\n5 field, volleyball, and water polo.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 19.)\n6 62. As of that date, there were intercollegiate teams for\n7 men at UC Davis in 12 sports:  baseball, basketball,\n8 cross-country, football, golf, soccer, swimming/diving, tennis,\n9 outdoor track & field, indoor track & field, water polo, and\n10 wrestling.  (Id.)\n11 63. In 2003, UC Davis announced that it would reclassify\n12 from NCAA Division II to NCAA Division I; the process took four\n13 years to complete.  (Id. ¶ 26.) \n14 A. Applications for Addition of Women’s Sports Teams\n15 64. UC Davis monitored undergraduate interest in athletics\n16 by looking at participation in club sports and intramurals.  (TT\n17 2341:7-2342:16.)\n18 65. However, it did not conduct a survey of student\n19 interest prior to 2004, did not conduct an analysis in writing,\n20 and had no formal policy for evaluating and assessing interest. \n21 (TT 1410:21-1411:13; 1736:23-1737:3; 2190:7-25; 2192:11-24.)\n22 66. Further, there is no evidence that UC Davis had an\n23 established process by which it assessed interest by high school\n24 students, outside athletic associations, or other academic\n25 institutions.\n26 67. Indeed, aside from the two times they solicited varsity\n27 applications in 1994 and 2003, UC Davis did not implement a\n28 formal system for assessing interest in specific athletic\n15\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 16 of 147\n1 opportunities from 1972-2005.  (TT 1253:22-24; 1279:13-19;\n2 1410:21-1411:1; 1411:2-13; 1736:23-1737:3; 2192:1-24.)\n3 1. Women’s Cross-Country12\n4 68. In response to requests made from intercollegiate\n5 athletic coaches, UC Davis upgraded women’s cross-country to\n6 varsity status in 1978.  Specifically, Sue Williams, who became\n7 the women’s varsity cross-country coach, provided information\n8 supporting the upgrade to then Athletic Director, Joe Singleton\n9 (“Singleton”).  Singleton sought information regarding whether\n10 cross-country had a viable pool of potential athletes, whether\n11 Sue Williams could create a potential schedule with similar\n12 institutions, and whether cross-country was competitively viable. \n13 (TT 1511:5-1512:11; 1622:20-1623:6.)\n14 69. Gill-Fisher recommended the upgrade in the July 1978\n15 Title IX review.  (JX 16; TT 1622:5-1623:12.)\n16 2. Women’s Water Polo, Lacrosse, and Crew\n17 70. UC Davis solicited proposals for new women’s varsity\n18 sports in 1995 and again in 2003.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 22.)\n19 71. In January 1995, a sport selection advisory committee\n20 chaired by the acting Athletic Director was formed to evaluate\n21 teams and identify the three women’s sports to be added.  (TT\n22 696:3-25.)\n23 72. The campus developed a detailed, analytical process for\n24 selecting the new sports, which involved input from persons\n25 outside of the Athletic Department.  The process involved a\n26\n27 12 The court notes that there was little to no specific\nevidence presented regarding the process used to add women’s\n28 soccer as a varsity sport in 1983.\n16\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 17 of 147\nseries of steps: (1) the committee would prepare materials for\n1\ninterested parties to use in preparing new sport proposals,\n2\nincluding a description of the relevant criteria; (2) the\n3\nintercollegiate athletic administration would provide support to\n4\ngroups interested in making a proposal, or intercollegiate\n5\nathletic staff would develop the proposal themselves if no\n6\nrepresentative group was available for a potential new sport; (3)\n7\nproposals would be circulated to a number of campus committees\n8\nand organizations; (4) the sport selection committee would meet\n9\nwith groups making proposals; (5) the sport selection committee\n10\nwould receive comments from interested committees and\n11\norganizations; (6) the sport selection committee would summarize\n12\ncomments and assist the Athletic Director in making final\n13\nrecommendations; and (7) the Athletic Director would submit new\n14\nsport recommendations to the Associate Vice Chancellor for\n15\nStudent Affairs.  (JX 31.) \n16\n73. The committee developed a detailed set of criteria to\n17\nevaluate the new sport proposals, including impact on gender\n18\nequity, interest in the sport at various levels, sport\n19\nsponsorship and competitive opportunities within conference or\n20\nNCAA, availability and cost of appropriate facilities, equipment\n21\nand operating expenses for the sport, use of training rooms,\n22\ncoaching requirements, minimum roster numbers for a successful\n23\nprogram, and anticipated success at the NCAA level.  (JX 31; TT\n24\n696:3-700:5; 1727:14-1729:13.)\n25\n74. In 1995, the following women’s club teams submitted\n26\napplications to be elevated to varsity status at UC Davis: water\n27\n28\n17\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 18 of 147\n1 polo, lacrosse, crew, badminton, and field hockey.  (Pretrial\n2 Order ¶ 23.) \n3 75. After receiving input from various constituent groups\n4 and the sport selection committee, UC Davis elevated women’s\n5 water polo, lacrosse, and crew to varsity status.  (Id.; TT\n6 707:6-708:9; 1200:5-16; JX 34.)\n7 76. The decision to add these sports was responsive to the\n8 developing interests and abilities of female students at UC\n9 Davis.  (TT 1657:22-1660:24.)\n10 77. Viable women’s club teams already existed for all three\n11 sports, and each had increasing rates of participation at both\n12 high school and collegiate levels.  (TT 705:3-5; JX 28-30 &\n13 33-34.)\n14 78. Specifically, the women’s water polo club team had won\n15 championships at the club level, and the sport was on the NCAA\n16 list of emerging sports for women.  (TT 1487:5-1489:4; JX\n17 28.0945-46; JX 30; JX 34.) \n18 79. Women’s lacrosse had high participation rates at UC\n19 Davis (ranging from 40-100 women over the five years before it\n20 was elevated to varsity), and nationwide high school\n21 participation in women’s lacrosse had dramatically increased 131%\n22 over the previous five years.  (JX 29, 34.) \n23 80. Crew for women had large sports club participation at\n24 UC Davis, first-rate facilities at Lake Natoma and the Port of\n25 Sacramento, and a PAC-10 championship.  (JX 28, 33-34.)\n26 81. Although it was a close call in comparison to lacrosse,\n27 field hockey was not chosen.  The majority of the committee\n28 believed that nearby competition in lacrosse would likely be more\n18\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 19 of 147\n1 plentiful because more colleges in UC Davis’ region had club\n2 teams that might be moving up to intercollegiate status.  (TT\n3 708:19-709:25.)  Field hockey also had much more stringent and\n4 expensive field requirements than lacrosse.  (TT 723:22-724:25.)\n5 3. Women’s Indoor Track & Field\n6 82. In 1993, the women’s intercollegiate track & field\n7 coach, Deanne Vochatzer (“Vochatzer”), approached the Athletic\n8 Director, Keith Williams (“Williams”) about the issue of adding\n9 indoor track & field as a varsity sport.  She believed it would\n10 be beneficial to the members of the outdoor track & field team\n11 and would aid in recruiting.  Mr. Williams approved of having\n12 student-athletes compete in indoor track & field events, but\n13 given the financial crisis occurring at the time, required\n14 Vochatzer to find funds within her existing team budget to do so. \n15 (TT 1562:6-1563:17.)\n16 83. Shortly after defendant Warzecka became Athletic\n17 Director, Vochatzer raised the issue of indoor track & field with\n18 him and requested additional funds in order to take female\n19 student-athletes to indoor track & field events.  (TT 2049:4-9.) \n20 84. The facility in Reno where many of the indoor track &\n21 field events were held had fallen into disrepair, and thus it was\n22 necessary to travel further distances to competitions, such as\n23 Seattle and Idaho.  (TT 1565:2-1566:4.) \n24 85. The NCAA began reimbursing championship expenses for\n25 indoor track & field for Division II schools in the 1996-1997\n26 school year.  (TT 1566:5-14.) \n27\n28\n19\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 20 of 147\n1 86. Warzecka agreed to provide more funding so the team\n2 could compete in more indoor track & field competitions and NCAA\n3 indoor track & field championships.  (TT 2048:11-2050:19.)\n4 87. The first year UC Davis was able to report indoor track\n5 & field as a separate sport on its EADA report was 1998-99. (JX\n6 4, at B52.)  UC Davis began reporting indoor track & field as a\n7 separate sport in its 1998-1999 EADA report.  (Id.; TT\n8 2046:11-2047:9; see also JX 89.)\n9 4. Women’s Golf\n10 88. The process for adding women’s golf was based on the\n11 same process that was used to add the three sports in 1995-96. \n12 (TT 1726:5-16.)\n13 89. The process of program expansion began again in 2002.\n14 (TT 2364:23-2365:20; TT 2129:17-2131:2; DX EE.)\n15 90. In April 2003 information was disseminated to club\n16 sport teams, students, and other members of the campus community\n17 regarding the process and criteria to be used for selection of a\n18 new intercollegiate sport for women.  (TT 1726:17-1727:13;\n19 1730:11-14; 2135:17-2136:17; JX 74.)\n20 91. The criteria for assessment of potential\n21 intercollegiate sports included impact on gender equity, interest\n22 in the sport at various levels, sport sponsorship and competitive\n23 opportunities within conference or NCAA, availability and cost of\n24 appropriate facilities, equipment and operating expenses for the\n25 sport, use of training rooms, coaching requirements, minimum\n26 roster numbers for a successful program, and anticipated success\n27 at the NCAA level.  (TT 1727:14-1729:13; JX 74.)\n28\n20\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 21 of 147\n1 92. The following women’s club teams submitted applications\n2 for varsity status at UC Davis: field hockey, rugby, horse polo,\n3 and bowling.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 24.)\n4 93. A proposal to add golf as a varsity sport for women was\n5 submitted by Associate Athletic Director Bob Bullis.  (Id.)\n6 94. The 1995 process, upon which the 2002-2003 process was\n7 based, specifically stated that an intercollegiate athletic\n8 employee would prepare the proposal if no representative group\n9 was available to prepare a proposal for potential new women’s\n10 sports.  (JX 31, at RPD1.2187.)\n11 95. The addition of women’s golf at UC Davis had been\n12 discussed multiple times before the 2002 process, including as\n13 early as November 9, 1992.  (TT 1656:4-13, 1730:1-1732:8; JX 22.)\n14 96. Indeed, Warzecka had received an inquiry from the\n15 President of California National Organization for Women (“Cal\n16 NOW”) in December 1998 suggesting the addition of women’s golf. \n17 (JX 41.)\n18 97. Further, there was high participation in women’s golf\n19 at California high schools and junior colleges, and the sport was\n20 attracting numerous e-mail inquiries from prospective students.\n21 (TT 1734:15-1735:7.)\n22 98. Defendant Warzecka recommended to Vice Chancellor for\n23 Student Affairs, Judy Sakaki, that golf be added as the next\n24 intercollegiate sport for women because: (1) golf was already\n25 played as a championship sport in the Big West Conference, and UC\n26 Davis was therefore required by conference rules to add\n27 conference championship sports before adding other sports; (2)\n28 competition was plentiful because 451 colleges had\n21\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 22 of 147\n1 intercollegiate women’s golf programs; (3) women’s golf had an\n2 NCAA championship in all three NCAA divisions; (4) golf was\n3 offered for women at 639 high schools and 27 junior colleges,\n4 providing a strong recruiting base; (5) UC Davis was receiving\n5 numerous e-mail inquiries about the availability of women’s golf;\n6 (6) the Davis community indicated strong interest and financial\n7 support for women’s golf; and (7) a local golf club course was\n8 available.  (TT 2160:1-2163:11; JX 81.)\n9 99. In June of 2004, UC Davis announced that it would add\n10 women’s golf as a new varsity sport.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 25.)\n11 100. Head coach, Kathy DeYoung, was appointed at that time\n12 and spent academic year 2004-2005 building the team.  This\n13 included developing a budget, constructing a schedule of\n14 competition, obtaining equipment, and spending time with the golf\n15 programs at Washington, UCLA, and Berkeley to learn how top\n16 programs operate.  (Id.; TT 2164:7-2165:4; 2259:15-2260:5.)13\n17 101. The team commenced competition in the fall of 2005. \n18 (Pretrial Order ¶ 25.) \n19 102. Under all the relevant circumstances, the court finds\n20 the addition of women’s golf was responsive to the developing\n21 interests and abilities of female student-athletes.\n22 103. There were a number of legitimate reasons UC Davis\n23 choose not to elevate the other sports that sought\n24 intercollegiate status when it elevated women’s golf.\n25\n26\n27 13 Plaintiffs’ expert, Donna Lopiano, agreed that a year\nis needed to get a new sport ready for competition.  (TT\n28 945:11-20.)\n22\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 23 of 147\n1 104. With respect to field hockey, although there was a\n2 longstanding club team, UC Davis did not have an adequate turf\n3 facility to host intercollegiate field hockey competition.  (TT\n4 2137:2-20; JX 80.)  Further, none of the schools in the Big West\n5 Conference, which UC Davis was joining, had varsity field hockey\n6 teams, and there were only three teams in all of California.  (TT\n7 2147:11-2151:11.)\n8 105. With respect to rugby, women’s rugby was designated an\n9 emerging sport by the NCAA, but there was no conference with\n10 existing competition for a schedule, and only one other\n11 intercollegiate team in the country.  (TT 2138:1-6; 2158:13-22;\n12 JX 78, at 5.)\n13 106. With respect to horse polo, there was a lack of\n14 regional competition, a lack of local facilities for competition,\n15 and the sport would have required considerable expenses for\n16 maintaining and transporting horses.  (TT 2138:10-2139:1.)\n17 107. With respect to women’s bowling, UC Davis had an\n18 existing club and a facility, but it was not an NCAA sport and\n19 the only existing intercollegiate competition was in the\n20 Southeast, necessitating considerable travel costs and lost\n21 student class time.  (TT 2139:2-2140:10, 2144:25-2146:18.)\n22 108. Accordingly, these sports were not chosen for elevation\n23 to varsity status.\n24 /////\n25 /////\n26 /////\n27 /////\n28 /////\n23\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 24 of 147\n1 B. Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (“EADA”) Reports14\n2 109. EADA reporting began in 1995-1996.  (JX 1; TT\n3 1823:24-1824:1.)\n4 110. Pursuant to the requirements of the EADA, UC Davis has\n5 submitted a report to the Department of Education, Office for\n6 Civil Rights, each fall since 1996 setting forth: (1)\n7 undergraduate enrollment numbers at UC Davis by gender; and (2)\n8 the number of male and female participants on intercollegiate\n9 sport teams on campus.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 20.)\n10 111. The parties agree that Joint Exhibit 89 accurately\n11 reflects the relevant information provided on the EADA reports\n12 for each year from 1995 through 2006.\n13 112. In 1995-1996, there were 211 total female participants\n14 in varsity athletics.15  The difference between the female\n15 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n16 percentage was 20 percent.  (JX 89.)\n17 113. In 1996-1997, there were 348 total female participants\n18 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n19 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n20 percentage was 11 percent.  (JX 89.) \n21\n14 The Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (“EADA”)\n22\n“requires federally funded universities to report to the\nDepartment of Education and make available to students the number\n23 of undergraduates and athletes, broken down by sex, as well as\nsex-segregated data on operating expenses, coach salaries,\n24 athletic scholarships, recruiting expenditures, and revenues.” \nMansourian v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 968\n25 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1092(g)). \n26 15 The court does not consider plaintiffs’ “unduplicated\ncount” as the Ninth Circuit has recognized that courts “count\n27 participation opportunities, not individuals, when comparing the\nnumber of ‘athletes’ to overall student enrollment.”  Mansourian,\n28 602 F.3d at 966, n.12.\n24\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 25 of 147\n1 114. In 1997-1998, there were 383 total female participants\n2 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n3 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n4 percentage was 11 percent.  (JX 89.) \n5 115. In 1998-1999, there were 426 total female participants\n6 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n7 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n8 percentage was 7 percent.  (JX 89.)\n9 116. In 1999-2000, there were 424 total female participants\n10 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n11 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n12 percentage was 6 percent.  (JX 89.)\n13 117. In 2000-2001, there were 407 total female participants\n14 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n15 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n16 percentage was 7 percent.  (JX 89.)\n17 118. In 2001-2002, there were 361 total female participants\n18 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n19 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n20 percentage was 9 percent.  (JX 89.)\n21 119. In 2002-2003, there were 389 total female participants\n22 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n23 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n24 percentage was 7 percent.  (JX 89.)\n25 120. In 2003-2004, there were 373 total female participants\n26 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n27 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n28 percentage was 6 percent.

The difference between the female\n3 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n4 percentage was 6 percent.  (JX 89.)\n5 122. In 2005-2006, there were 401 total female participants\n6 in varsity athletics.  The difference between the female\n7 enrollment percentage and the female athletic participation\n8 percentage was 5 percent.  (JX 89.)\n9 123. Between 1998-1999 and 2001-2002, UC Davis eliminated 65\n10 female participation opportunities.  (JX 89.)  31 of these\n11 eliminated participation opportunities arose as a result of the\n12 elimination of the women’s water polo and women’s lacrosse junior\n13 varsity (or “B”) teams, which were dropped in 2000-2001 due to\n14 lack of sufficient competition at the intercollegiate level.  (JX\n15 5, 7; TT 1840:3-1842:2.)\n16 124. The women’s water polo coach requested the change\n17 regarding the junior varsity team because fewer colleges were\n18 sponsoring “B teams,” thereby decreasing the opportunities for\n19 junior varsity players to play in games.  (TT 1494:2-1495:6.) \n20 The women’s water polo coach helped re-establish the UC Davis\n21 club team, which went on to have considerable success in\n22 competition.  (TT 1495:7-1496:7.) \n23 125. The women’s junior varsity lacrosse team was also\n24 discontinued at the request of the coach, Elaine Jones, on the\n25 basis of lack of competition from other colleges.  (TT\n26 1634:8-1635:10; 1665:11-1666:25; 2073:4-2074:3; 2076:21-2077:8.)\n27 126. The lack of competition was a legitimate reason to drop\n28 the JV teams.  (TT 1834:23-1835:8, 1835:21-1836:10.)\n26\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 27 of 147\n1 127. However, UC Davis did not replace the dropped\n2 opportunities.  (JX 17.)\n3 128. By 2005, actual athletic participation opportunities\n4 for female students were at their lowest point since 1997.  (JX\n5 89.)\n6 C. Expert Testimony16\n7 129. Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Donna Lopiano (“Dr. Lopiano”) is\n8 a nationally and internationally recognized, leading expert in\n9 gender equity in athletics.  (JX 85; TT 760:21-761:3;\n10 761:25-762:22; 763:4-773:23; 775:3-778:17.)  Dr. Lopiano has\n11 served as an expert witness in over 30 cases, including in\n12 seminal cases addressing Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause\n13 in athletics, such as Cohen v. Brown University and Haffer v.\n14 Temple University.  (JX 85, at 6-7; TT 776:14-777:4.)\n15 130. Dr. Lopiano is currently the Chief Executive Officer of\n16 Sports Management Resources, a consulting firm.  (JX 85.)  She\n17 was the Chief Executive Officer at the Women’s Sports Foundation. \n18 She has also been a coach of multiple sports and an athletic\n19 director for more than 18 years at the University of Texas at\n20 Austin.  (JX 85; TT 764:17-23; 766:2-2-767:5.).  She was active\n21 in the development of regulations to implement Title IX and\n22 various policy interpretations and guidelines promulgated by the\n23\n16 The court notes the unusual nature of the type of\n24\nexpert testimony advanced in this case.  Specifically, both Dr.\nLopiano and Dr. Grant gave testimony regarding their conflicting\n25 opinions on whether UC Davis complied with Title IX and achieved\ngender equity requirements, the issues at the heart of this\n26 litigation.  However, given the unique nature of the quasi-\nfactual, quasi-legal issues surrounding Title IX, the court\n27 allowed such expert testimony.  The court recounts the relevant\ntestimony of the experts under its Findings of Fact and whether\n28 it adopts or rejects the opinions under its Conclusions of Law. \n27\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 28 of 147\n1 Department of Education’s (“DOE”) Office for Civil Rights\n2 (“OCR”), including the OCR’s 1979 Policy Interpretation, the\n3 OCR’s 1996 Clarification of the Three-Prong Test, and the OCR’s\n4 2011 Clarification of Prong Three.  Dr. Lopiano also assisted in\n5 the development of the 1980 and 1990 versions of the OCR\n6 Investigator’s Manual and trained staff at OCR regional offices\n7 on various issues related to Title IX in athletics.  (TT\n8 775:3-776:13).\n9 131. The court found Dr. Lopiano to be qualified as an\n10 expert witness in this matter on the issues of gender equity in\n11 athletics, Title IX, athletic administration, and roster\n12 management.  (TT 777:17-23.)\n13 132. Defendants’ expert Dr. Christine Grant (“Dr. Grant”) is\n14 also a nationally and internationally recognized, leading expert\n15 in gender equity in athletics.  (JX 83; TT 1794:3-1800:5.)  Dr.\n16 Grant has served as an expert witness in several cases, including\n17 in seminal cases addressing Title IX in athletics, such as Cohen\n18 v. Brown University.  Before this case, Dr. Grant has always\n19 testified on behalf of student-athletes.  (JX 83; TT 1803:14-\n20 1804:13.)\n21 133. Dr. Grant is a Senior Associate at Sports Management\n22 Resources, a consulting firm.  She has also been a coach of\n23 multiple sports and was an athletic director for 27 years at the\n24 University of Iowa.  (JX 83; TT 1785:13-1788:13; 1789:19-23.) \n25 She was also active in the development of regulations to\n26 implement Title IX and various policy interpretations and\n27 guidelines promulgated by the OCR, such as the OCR’s 1979 Policy\n28\n28\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 29 of 147\n1 Interpretation and the OCR’s 1996 Clarification of the\n2 Three-Prong Test.  (TT 1800:6-1803:8.)\n3 134. The court found Dr. Grant to be qualified as an expert\n4 witness in this matter on the issues of gender equity in\n5 athletics, Title IX, athletic administration, and roster\n6 management.  (TT 1811:4-1812:6.)\n7 135. Dr. Grant has known Dr. Lopiano since the 1970s. \n8 Indeed, during the pendency of this case, Dr. Grant was hired by\n9 Dr. Lopiano’s consulting firm, Sports Management Resources.  (TT\n10 1792:11-23.)\n11 136. This is the first case in which Dr. Grant and Dr.\n12 Lopiano have been on opposite sides of a case.  (TT 1793:22-24.)\n13 1. Proportionality\n14 137. Schools exercise total jurisdiction over the proportion\n15 of males and females in their athletic programs.  They control\n16 and predetermine the number of males and females participating in\n17 the programs through their selection of which sports to offer\n18 male and female students and by making decisions about the\n19 quality of the coaching and the quality of the program.  (TT\n20 994:22-995:7; 1880:4-1881:10.)\n21 138. As used in this case, the “proportionality” measure\n22 compares the percentage of women enrolled at UC Davis with the\n23 percentage of women participating in the intercollegiate athletic\n24 program.  (TT 819:16-820:3.)  A university provides equal\n25 participation opportunities in intercollegiate athletics if women\n26 occupy the same percentage of athletic opportunities in the\n27 intercollegiate athletic program as their enrollment percentage. \n28 (TT 820:19-821:12).\n29\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 30 of 147\n1 139. The number of participation opportunities that a school\n2 would have to add for women to achieve actual proportionality\n3 (equity with what is provided to male students proportionate to\n4 enrollment) is known as the participation gap.  (TT\n5 823:14-827:23.)\n6 140. Both Dr. Grant and Dr. Lopiano testified that, in the\n7 Title IX context, “substantial” proportionality is reached if the\n8 participation gap is less than the size of a female sports team\n9 that could be added.17  (TT 820:19-821:12; 1876:14-1877:8.)\n10 141. An institution may not rely on a set percentage from\n11 actual proportionality for this measure because that will\n12 translate into a different number of actual participation\n13 opportunities depending on the size of a school.  (TT 1877:2-8).\n14 142. Dr. Lopiano used the athletic participation numbers set\n15 forth in UC Davis’ EADA Reports for each year from 1995-1996\n16 through 2004-2005 to calculate the participation gap between male\n17 and female students.  (JX 1-9.)  She then identified the number\n18 of actual female participation opportunities that UC Davis would\n19\n20\n21 17 Because as set forth infra, the parties have stipulated\nfor the purposes of this action that UC Davis was not in\n22\ncompliance with Prong One of the three-part test, the court does\nnot reach the merits of the validity of this contention as\n23\napplied to the facts of this case.  However, the court has some\nmisgivings about the practical application of such a test,\n24\nparticularly in combination with plaintiffs’ concurrent\nadvancement of the “team of one” theory.  Under plaintiffs’\n25 combined theories, to the extent an institution has not added a\nteam where individual competition is possible, such as swimming,\n26 indoor track & field, outdoor track & field, cross-country,\nfencing, or wrestling, that institution would not be\n27 “substantially” proportionate if the participation gap was equal\nto one student who was interested in participating in such a\n28 sport.\n30\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 31 of 147\n1 have had to have added to reach gender equity in terms of\n2 intercollegiate participation opportunities, as follows: \n3\nYear Female Female Female % Female Male Add’l\nEnroll- Enroll- Athlete % Disparity Athletes Athletes Female\n4\nment ment % # # Athletes\nneeded #\n5\n1995-1996 9,352 52% 32% -20% 211 441 267\n6\n1996-1997 10,054 53% 42% -11% 348 472 184\n7\n1997-1998 10,118 54% 42.7% -11.3% 383 513 219\n8\n1998-1999 10,596 55% 47.8% -7.2% 426 466 144\n9\n1999-2000 10,446 56.6% 50.5% -6.1% 424 416 119\n10 2000-2001 11,783 56% 49.2% -6.8% 407 420 128\n11 2001-2002 12,494 56.2% 47.3% -8.9% 361 403 156\n12 2002-2003 11,331 56.4% 49.2% -7.2% 389 401 130\n2003-2004 11,660 55.9% 50.1% -5.8% 373 371 97\n13\n2004-2005 12,834 55.34% 50.25% -6.1% 363 368 101\n14\n15\n(JX 84A; TT 823:14-830:17.)\n16\n2. History and Continuing Practice of Program\nExpansion\n17\n143. A school must have both a history and a continuing\n18\npractice of intercollegiate athletics program expansion for women\n19\nif it wants to claim program expansion under Title IX.  (TT\n20\n830:18-831:40; 832:20-833:18; 1877:18-1878:12.)\n21\n144. The number of intercollegiate participation\n22\nopportunities added is determinative of whether a school has\n23\nengaged in program expansion for female students, not the number\n24\nof teams added.  (TT 788:6-11; 1884:10-13.)\n25\n145. Roster management of men’s teams is not program\n26\nexpansion for female students.  (TT 858:20-859:8; 1901:16-21.)\n27\n28\n31\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 32 of 147\n1 146. If a school eliminates participation opportunities for\n2 female students, it must replace those opportunities and continue\n3 to expand.  (TT 834:13-835:10; 1898:14-24.)\n4 147. Despite agreeing upon these general principles,\n5 plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Lopiano, and defendants’ expert, Dr.\n6 Grant, offered conflicting testimony on the issue of whether UC\n7 Davis adequately expanded the women’s intercollegiate athletic\n8 program.\n9 148. Dr. Lopiano testified that UC Davis did not have a\n10 continuing practice of program expansion because it dropped\n11 female participation opportunities between 1998 and 2005 without\n12 replacing them.  (TT 834:18-835:10; 837:5-840:21; 842:10-15). \n13 149. Dr. Lopiano opined that UC Davis had not adequately\n14 expanded participation opportunities for women because (1) UC\n15 Davis did not add a woman’s team for nine years; and (2) over\n16 those nine years, there was an overall net decline in actual\n17 participation opportunities for female student-athletes.  (TT\n18 837:5-19; 846:16-847:8; 854:15-856:6).\n19 150. Dr. Grant testified that an institution must expand\n20 every 2-3 years to rely on Prong Two.  (TT 1896:9-25).  She\n21 opined, however, that despite UC Davis’ net loss in participation\n22 opportunities between 1998 and 2005, defendants adequately\n23 expanded their women’s program.\n24 151. She testified that UC Davis should be given a nine-year\n25 “credit” for the three teams added in 1996, as though UC Davis\n26 had added one every 2-3 years.  (TT 1908:5-9; 1903:10-13).\n27 152. Dr. Grant also testified that the decline in\n28 participation opportunities from 1998-99 to 2001-02 was due to\n32\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 33 of 147\n1 cutting two JV teams for legitimate reasons and normal\n2 fluctuations in the size of women’s teams that, in fact,\n3 fluctuated upwards in 2002-03 and 2005-2006.  (TT 1905:15-1907:8;\n4 1933:22-1934:5; JX 89.)\n5 153. She asserted that the fluctuation in women’s athletic\n6 participation rates under the circumstances, where the percentage\n7 of women undergraduates enrolled at UC Davis was growing, did not\n8 indicate an end to progress by UC Davis toward gender equality. \n9 (TT 1835:19-1844:10.)\n10 154. Neither plaintiffs’ expert nor defendants’ expert\n11 testified regarding how to measure or determine a “normal”\n12 fluctuation in athletic participation opportunities.  At most,\n13 Dr. Lopiano testified that if a school was experiencing “normal”\n14 fluctuations in participation opportunities, one would see\n15 fluctuations going up and down over time, rather than a steady\n16 decrease in participation opportunities.  (TT 832:20-834:6.) \n17 However, there was no evidence regarding how steep such\n18 fluctuations may be or over what period of time one should see\n19 such fluctuations rise and fall.\n20 III. Participation of Women in Wrestling at UC Davis\n21 155. The court notes that it has previously dismissed as\n22 time barred all claims, under both Title IX and 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n23 arising from the elimination of wrestling opportunities in 2000-\n24 2001 and for implementation of a policy that required them to\n25 wrestle-off against men in 2001 (the “wrestle-off policy”). \n26 (Mem. & Order [Docket #226], filed Oct. 18, 2007; Mem. & Order\n27 [Docket #509], filed Dec. 8, 2010.) \n28\n33\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 34 of 147\n1 156. The court clarified that the only viable claims were\n2 based upon the more general claims that defendants violated their\n3 rights by failing to provide equal accommodation of athletics to\n4 women each and every day plaintiffs were students at UC Davis. \n5 (Mem. & Order [Docket #509], filed Dec. 8, 2010; Mem. & Order\n6 [Docket #594], filed May 18, 2011.)\n7 157. However, the court noted that evidence relating to the\n8 elimination of wrestling and the implementation of the wrestle-\n9 off policy could be relevant to plaintiffs’ broader claims. \n10 Despite repeated clarifications regarding the court’s prior\n11 rulings, during the course of trial, plaintiffs’ counsel again\n12 erroneously asserted that none of their Title IX claims had been\n13 dismissed as untimely.  (See Mem. & Order [Docket #594], filed\n14 May 18, 2011.)\n15 158. Further, plaintiffs’ evidence at trial consisted almost\n16 entirely of testimony and exhibits relating to the alleged\n17 elimination of women’s wrestling and implementation of the\n18 wrestle-off policy.\n19 159. Moreover, in their proposed conclusions of law,\nfor the first time\n20 plaintiffs  assert that UC Davis violated the\n21 contact sports provision of the 1979 Policy Interpretation by\n22 eliminating and/or failing to provide varsity wrestling\n23 opportunities for women.18\n24\n25\n18 The court notes that for the same reasons set forth in\n26 its various memoranda & orders on this issue, all plaintiffs’\nclaims arising out of the elimination of varsity wrestling and/or\n27 implementation of the “wrestle-off” policy are time-barred,\ndiscrete acts.  However, for the sake of completeness and in an\n28 abundance of caution, the court addresses these issues herein.\n34\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 35 of 147\n1   160. Accordingly, the court makes the following findings of\n2 fact.\n3 A. History of Female Participation in Wrestling at UC\nDavis\n4\n5 161. A handful of women participated in wrestling at UC\n6 Davis for many years before the controversy at the heart of this\n7 dispute arose.\n8 162. UC Davis also sponsored a women’s division in its\n9 annual Aggie Open wrestling tournament.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 28.)\n10 163. “Open” wrestling tournaments allow all persons who wish\n11 to participate, as long as they satisfy tournament\n12 qualifications, such as age.  (Id. ¶ 29.)\n13 164. Afsoon Roshanzamir (Afsoon “Johnston” after marriage),\n14 a talented female athlete, began practicing with the varsity\n15 wrestling program in the early 1990’s in preparation for\n16 international competition.  (Johnston Dep. at 30:20-24;\n17 31:3-32:12; 36:13-24; 37:25-38:6; 39:16-20).\n18 165. Johnston started UC Davis as a freshmen in 1990 and\n19 inquired with Bob Brooks (“Brooks”), then head wrestling coach of\n20 the men’s intercollegiate program.  (Johnston Dep. at 30:14-15;\n21 31:5-11.)\n22 166. Johnston testified that she introduced herself,\n23 informed Brooks that she was pursuing wrestling on the national\n24 level, and stated that she wanted to be a part of the UC Davis\n25 team.  Specifically, she testified that “if [she] could have a\n26 corner of the mat and a workout partner, that [she] would be\n27 happy.”  (Johnston Dep. at 31:14-18.)\n28\n35\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 36 of 147\n1 167. Johnston practiced and sparred with men, even if they\n2 were above her weight class.  (Johnston Dep. at 65:1-12; Collier\n3 Dep. at 13:14-24 (testifying that he sparred with Johnston when\n4 she was 118 pounds and he was 134 pounds).)  Specifically, during\n5 her freshman year, she practiced with the starting 119 pound male\n6 wrestler.  (Johnston Dep. at 65:1-12.)\n7 168. Johnston didn’t expect to be in the starting line-up,\n8 but expected that she would be required to compete against either\n9 men or women in open tournaments.  (Johnston Dep. at 69:19-25.) \n10 169. During her freshman or sophomore year, Johnston\n11 competed unofficially in a dual meet against a female wrestler at\n12 Chico State; however, their points did not go against the team\n13 score.  (Johnston Dep. at 34:15-25.)  She wore a UC Davis singlet\n14 while competing.  (Johnston Dep. at 34:15-25.) \n15 170. Johnston also competed in a men’s tournament while she\n16 was a student at UC Davis.  (Johnston Dep. at 35:1-22.)  She also\n17 wore a UC Davis singlet in this match.  (Johnston Dep. at 35:18-\n18 22.)\n19 171. Johnston was provided with locker room and training\n20 services and received equal coaching opportunities as the men. \n21 (Johnston Dep. at 36:13-24.)\n22 172. Johnston was on the UC Davis wrestling roster and\n23 participation lists in the 1992-1993 school year and the 1993-\n24 1994 school year.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 30.) \n25 173. However, Johnston testified that she only considered\n26 herself as being on the UC Davis team/squad her freshman year,\n27 1990-1991.  After that, she trained with the UC Davis team, but\n28 considered herself only to be a an “unofficial member” of the\n36\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 37 of 147\n1 team.  (Johnston Dep. at 42:3-12.)  Johnston did not take any\n2 steps to form a separate women’s varsity wrestling team. \n3 (Johnston Dep. at 52:4-7.) \n4 174. Despite being an “unofficial member” of the team,\n5 Johnston received locker room and training services and competed\n6 in open tournaments, such as the Aggie Open.  (Johnston Dep. at\n7 42:16-43:4.)\n8 175. During Johnston’s senior year, she practiced and\n9 trained with Jennifer Martin (“Martin”), a graduate student at UC\n10 Davis.  (Johnston Dep. at 43:21-24.)\n11 176. No other female undergraduate students participated in\n12 wrestling at Davis during the five years that Johnston was a UC\n13 Davis student.  (Johnston Dep. at 41:5-17.) \n14 177. After Johnston graduated in 1995, she and Martin\n15 continued to workout with the UC Davis wrestling team and\n16 received coaching by the head coach of the men’s intercollegiate\n17 program, Michael Burch (“Burch”), as well as assistant coaches. \n18 (Johnston Dep. at 44:9-21.)\n19 178. Stacey Massola was on the UC Davis wrestling roster and\n20 participation lists in the 1997-1998 school year.  (Pretrial\n21 Order ¶ 31.)\n22 179. Former plaintiff Nancy Chiang (“Chiang”) was on the\n23 wrestling roster and participation lists in the 1998-1999, 1999-\n24 2000, and the 2000-2001 school year.  Chiang participated in two\n25 Aggie Open wrestling tournaments during the time she attended UC\n26 Davis.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 32.)\n27\n28\n37\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 38 of 147\n1 180. Abby Schwartzburg (“Schwartzburg”) was on the wrestling\n2 roster and participation lists in the 1999-2000 school year. \n3 (Pretrial Order ¶ 33.) \n4 181. Alexis Bell was on wrestling rosters in the 2000-2001\n5 school year.  (Id. ¶ 34.)\n6 182. Samantha Reinis (“Reinis”) was on the wrestling roster\n7 and participation lists for the 1997-1998 and the 1998-1999\n8 school years.  Reinis suffered an injury and did not compete\n9 during the 1999-2000 and the 2000-2001 school year, although she\n10 did continue to attend practices during that time.  (Id. ¶ 35.)\n11 183. Women were listed on the wrestling team squad,\n12 participation, or rosters lists for the 1992-1993, 1993-1994,\n13 1997-1998, 1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001 school years. \n14 (Id. ¶ 36.)\n15 184. Women wrestlers were counted on the EADA reports as\n16 intercollegiate/varsity wrestling athletes for the following\n17 academic years: 1997-1998, 1998-1999, and 1999-2000.19  (Pretrial\n18 Order ¶ 37.)\n19 185. From 1992-1993 to 2000-2001, a total of nine individual\n20 women appeared on the roster.  (Id. ¶¶ 30-35, 38-40.)\n21 186. The most women appearing on the roster in any one year\n22 was five women in 2000-01.  (TT 85:15-20; 403:1-5.)\n23\n24 19 Plaintiffs assert that the listing of “W. Wrestling” in\nplaintiffs’ exhibit 49 demonstrates that UC Davis considered\n25 women’s wrestling as a separate varsity sport.  However, Warzecka\ntestified that plaintiff’s exhibit 49 was an internal EADA\n26 tracking document; because women were listed as varsity athletes\nin wrestling as a result of their inclusion on the men’s team,\n27 they had a separate column in the document.  (TT 1100:23-\n1101:25.)  Under these facts, plaintiff’s assertion is without\n28 merit.\n38\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 39 of 147\n1 187. Burch testified that a full women’s team would consist\n2 of 12 to 15 women wrestlers.  He admitted he never had that many\n3 women wrestlers at UC Davis.  (TT 309:16-310:3.)\n4 B. UC Davis’ Description of Women’s Participation in\nWrestling\n5\n6 188. When Mike Burch coached the UC Davis wrestling program\n7 from 1995 to 2001, the media guide for the team each year\n8 described women’s wrestling as having “unofficial status.”  (TT\n9 239:4-9, 383:23-385:4; 2092:2-2095:5; DX UU-YY.)\n10 189. The wrestling media guide for 1996-1997 included a\n11 heading “Women’s Freestyle Wrestling,” which referred to “[t]wo\n12 women who are members of the Davis Wrestling Club (a local\n13 freestyle wrestling club) [that] have spent time training with\n14 the Aggies.”  (DX UU, at MAN0184.)  This alluded to the\n15 participation of Johnston and Martin, women who were not\n16 undergraduate students at UC Davis at the time.  (See Johnston\n17 Dep. at 44:9-21.)\n18 190. The 1997-1998 media guide featured a picture and\n19 informational paragraph relating to then freshman Reinis. \n20 However, it also provided: “At UC Davis, women’s wrestling has an\n21 unofficial status, but women are encouraged to develop their\n22 skills.”  (DX VV, at MAN0208.)\n23 191. The 1998-1999 media guide featured the pictures and\n24 personal statistics of freshmen Nancy Chiang (“Chiang”),\n25 plaintiff Ng, and sophomore Reinis.  Again, the media guide\n26 provided: “At UC Davis, women’s wrestling has an unofficial\n27 status, but women are encouraged to develop their skills.”  (DX\n28 WW, at MAN0246.) \n39\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 40 of 147\n1 192. Similarly, the 1999-2000 media guide featured pictures\n2 and information relating to sophomores Chiang and Ng and juniors\n3 Reinis and Abby Schwarzburg and similarly provided: “At UC Davis,\n4 women’s wrestling has an unofficial status, but women are\n5 encouraged to develop their skills.”  (DX XX, at MAN0273.)\n6 193. Finally, the 2000-2001 media guide stated: “At UC\n7 Davis, women’s wrestling has an unofficial status, but women are\n8 encouraged to participate and develop their skills via the UC\n9 Davis Wrestling Club.”  (DX YY, at MAN0299\n10 194. There was never a separate media guide for women’s\n11 wrestling at UC Davis. (TT 384:5-8.)  Burch provided no\n12 information about women’s wrestling results or other\n13 accomplishments for the media guide.  (TT 378:4-388:9.) \n14 195. Based upon comments made to Gill-Fisher in 1999-2000,\n15 it appears that Schwartzburg and Reinis understood that they were\n16 not part of a separate women’s varsity team.  While the students\n17 were filling out physical clearance paperwork in her office,\n18 Gill-Fisher asked if they wanted to form a women’s wrestling club\n19 team; Schwartzburg and Reinis responded that they were happy\n20 working out with the men’s team.  (TT 1672:12-1674:8.)\n21 196. Plaintiff Ng recognized, at the time she was a student\n22 at UC Davis, that she was participating on a men’s wrestling\n23 team.  Specifically, on September 26, 2000, she wrote in her\n24 student-athlete questionnaire that the most interesting thing she\n25 had done was “being on a guy’s wrestling team.”20  (PX 283, at\n26\n27 20 To the extent Ng testified that this statement referred\nonly to her participation in high school wrestling, the court\n28 finds such testimony lacks credibility.\n40\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 41 of 147\n1 39.)  The next year, on the same form, she wrote that if she\n2 could change anything about wrestling it would be “having a\n3 women’s team.”  (PX 283, at 50.)  Ng testified that she hoped a\n4 women’s team would “be developed some day at UC Davis.”  (TT\n5 527:13-19.)\n6 C. Plaintiffs’ Participation in Wrestling at UC Davis\n7 197. Plaintiff Ng was on the roster for the intercollegiate\n8 wrestling program in academic years 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. \n9 (Pretrial Order ¶ 38.)  Ng also practiced with the\n10 intercollegiate wrestling program during Fall 2000.  (Id.)\n11 198. Ng completed NCAA and UC Davis eligibility requirements\n12 and, in exchange for payment, was provided with a UC Davis duffel\n13 bag that contained a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, and a beanie.  (TT\n14 477:19-478:13; 485:17-23; 513:20-25.)\n15 199. Burch did not require Ng to compete for a place on the\n16 team in 1998-1999 and 1999-2000.  (TT 477:19-478:18; 480:7-12.) \n17 Indeed, unlike every other intercollegiate athletic coach that\n18 testified at trial, Burch did not make cuts to his team.  (TT\n19 452:18-454:11.)\n20 200. Ng was also not required to compete or try-out for the\n21 team in Fall 2000.  (TT 480:12-15.) \n22 201. Ng was removed from the roster and cut from the program\n23 in October 2000.  She was placed back on the roster in May 2001. \n24 (Pretrial Order ¶ 38.) \n25 202. In the Fall 2001, Ng came to wrestling practices until\n26 she and others were cut by then head coach Lenny Zalesky\n27 (“Zalesky”) in October 2001.  (Id.)\n28\n41\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 42 of 147\n1 203. During the periods of time that Ng was on the roster,\n2 and during the time she attended practices in the Fall 2001, she\n3 was entitled to all of the benefits of varsity status, including\n4 lockers, training, academic support, laundry, access to the\n5 varsity weight room, and coaching.  (Id.; TT 485:4-16.)\n6 204. Despite being on the wrestling roster for three years,\n7 Ng never competed in a PAC-10 dual meet.  (TT 514:1-23; Pretrial\n8 Order ¶ 38.)\n9 205. Ng did not compete in any of the Aggie Opens because\n10 there were no competitors in her weight class.  (TT 514:1-24.)\n11 206. Rather, Ng competed in only one event during her years\n12 at UC Davis, the National Girls and Women’s Wrestling Tournament\n13 in Michigan, which was open to elementary school level students\n14 through college students.  (TT 506:16-507:1-15; 513:5-19;\n15 514:1-9.)  She did not wear a UC Davis singlet in that event, nor\n16 did she compete on behalf of UC Davis.  (TT 513:5-19; 514:7-24;\n17 520:19-20.)\n18 207. Plaintiff Mansourian practiced with the intercollegiate\n19 wrestling program during Fall 2000.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 39.) \n20 208. Masourian completed NCAA and UC Davis eligibility\n21 requirements and, in exchange for payment, was provided with a UC\n22 Davis duffel bag that contained wrestling shoes, a sweatshirt,\n23 and a beanie.  (TT 280:12-18; 90:7-24; 157:18-24.)\n24 209. Mansourian was not required to compete or try-out for\n25 the team in Fall 2000.  (TT 143:21-23.) \n26 210. She was removed from the roster and cut from the\n27 program in October 2000.  She was placed back on the roster in\n28 May 2001.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 39.)\n42\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 43 of 147\n1 211. Mansourian attended practices in Fall 2001 until\n2 October 2001.  (Id.)\n3 212. During the periods of time that Mansourian practiced\n4 and was on the roster, she was entitled to all of the benefits of\n5 varsity status, including lockers, training, academic support,\n6 laundry, access to the varsity weight room, and coaching.  (Id.;\n7 TT 93:25-94:7.)\n8 213. During her four years at UC Davis, Mansourian’s only\n9 competition was in the Aggie Open in January 2001, but she did\n10 not wear a UC Davis singlet.  (TT 158:5-159:8.)\n11 214. During the time Michael Burch coached the wrestling\n12 team, women generally wrestled against other women using\n13 freestyle rules.  These rules differ from the collegiate rules\n14 used by men.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 41.)\n15 215. While at UC Davis, plaintiffs Ng and Mansourian\n16 wrestled only against women and used freestyle rules.21  (Id.)\n17 216. Plaintiff Mancuso practiced with the intercollegiate\n18 wrestling program during Fall 2001 until she and others were cut\n19 from the varsity wrestling roster in October 2001.  (Pretrial\n20 Order ¶ 40.)\n21\n22\n23\n24 21 Plaintiff Mansourian testified that she decided to\nattend UC Davis because she wanted to wrestle.  She testified\n25 that Johnston was her idol, and she knew Johnston had wrestled at\nDavis.  (TT 62:12-23.)  However, as set forth above, Johnston\n26 admitted that for four of her five years at UC Davis, she was an\n“unofficial member” of the men’s intercollegiate wrestling\n27 program.  Further, she also testified that during her freshman\nyear, she not only practiced with men, but expected, was willing,\n28 and, in fact, did compete against men in open tournaments.\n43\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 44 of 147\n1 217. Mancuso was entitled to all of the benefits of varsity\n2 status, including lockers, training, academic support, laundry,\n3 and coaching until October 31, 2001.  (Id.)\n4 218. Mancuso never competed in wrestling during her years at\n5 UC Davis.  (TT 585:16-586:19.)\n6 219. The UC Davis men’s wrestling program competed in the\n7 PAC-10.  (TT 361:6-8.)  No PAC-10 school had a women’s wrestling\n8 team during Burch’s tenure as wrestling coach at UC Davis.  (TT\n9 383:2-4.)\n10 220. Burch never had any of the UC Davis women wrestlers\n11 compete in a PAC-10 dual meet.  He testified that there were no\n12 women wrestlers in any PAC-10 varsity dual meet lineups.  (TT\n13 382:3-11.)\n14 221. Burch testified that 6 of the 10 PAC-10 teams had women\n15 on the team during the time he was the coach.  (TT 2469:\n16 24-2470:9.)  However, he admitted that none of the women\n17 wrestlers from UC Davis ever competed against women on those\n18 teams.22  (TT 2474:7-20.)\n19 222. While Burch was coaching at UC Davis, no California\n20 four-year colleges had an all-women’s intercollegiate wrestling\n21 team.  (TT 397:7-17.)\n22 223. Although Burch was aware that Lee Allen coached a\n23 wrestling club in the Bay Area at Menlo College, he never set up\n24 a dual meet between Menlo College and the women wrestlers on the\n25 UC Davis wrestling team.  Burch only spoke to Allen about\n26\n22 In Burch’s six years of coaching UC Davis wrestling, he\n27 only once took a woman wrestler, Reinis, to possibly compete in a\nPAC-10 dual meet at Portland State against another woman; but,\n28 Reinis ultimately did not compete.  (TT 381:7-382:2.)\n44\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 45 of 147\n1 arranging possible open freestyle competitions.  (TT\n2 398:21-399:20.)\n3 224. Burch testified that there were a number of specific\n4 club events and open tournaments he could have scheduled for\n5 women wrestlers; however, the UC Davis women wrestlers only\n6 attended 4 of those events:  the Aggie Open, the California State\n7 University Bakersfield Open, a freestyle state tournament, and\n8 nationals in Las Vegas.  (TT 2471:19-2472:8; 2479:2-20.)  The\n9 women wrestlers had to pay their own way to those events.  (TT\n10 2480:3-7.)\n11 225. Unlike every other coach of a women’s varsity athletic\n12 team that testified at trial, Burch did not have a regular\n13 schedule of competition for women wrestlers.  (See TT 1473:7-21;\n14 1489:18-1491:17; 1556:5-1557:5; 2254:25-2255:6; 2260:9-11.)\n15 226. Although Burch testified women wrestlers represented UC\n16 Davis at such open meets, most of the women did not wear UC Davis\n17 uniforms at those events.  (TT 2479:25-2480:2; 2480:22-2481:4.) \n18 227. None of the plaintiffs ever wrestled in a UC Davis\n19 wrestling singlet.  (TT 2480:22-2481:4.)\n20 D. The Status of Women’s Varsity Wrestling at UC Davis\n21 228. There was never a women’s intercollegiate or “varsity”\n22 wrestling team at UC Davis.\n23 229. Rather, based upon the above facts, women only had\n24 “unofficial status” on the men’s intercollegiate wrestling team\n25 at UC Davis.\n26 230. Plaintiffs received all the benefits of varsity status\n27 as a result of their “unofficial status” on the men’s\n28 intercollegiate team.\n45\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 46 of 147\ninfra\n1 231. However, as set forth  , once UC Davis required the\n2 wrestling team to administer cuts to comply with a roster cap on\n3 men’s varsity sports, plaintiffs were cut from the men’s team. \n4 232. Plaintiffs were not cut from the men’s team because of\n5 their sex.  Rather, plaintiffs were cut, first by Burch and then\n6 by Zalesky, because, like the other male student-athletes that\n7 did not make the roster, they could not compete at the Division\n8 I, Pac-10 level in intercollegiate men’s wrestling.\n9 E. Michael Burch\n10 233. In 1995, UC Davis hired Burch as a wrestling coach. \n11 (Pretrial Order ¶ 27.)\n12 234. Burch was employed at UC Davis from 1995 to 2001 as the\n13 Head Coach of the UC Davis men’s varsity wrestling program and as\n14 a lecturer in religious studies and exercise biology.  (TT\n15 239:4-9; 252:4-5.)\n16 235. The court finds the majority of Burch’s testimony\n17 wholly lacking in credibility.  Indeed, the court finds that many\n18 of the underlying circumstances that gave rise to this litigation\n19 were a result of Burch’s misrepresentations to plaintiffs.\n20 236. Despite plaintiffs’ belief to the contrary, Burch was\n21 not an ardent supporter of women’s participation in\n22 intercollegiate competitive wrestling.23\n23\n24\n25 23 The court notes that this finding is not equivalent to\na finding that Burch was not open to or encouraging of female\n26 participation in wrestling generally.  However, the undisputed\nevidence demonstrates that Burch made virtually no efforts to\n27 establish a separate women’s varsity team or even provide women\nwrestlers with adequate intercollegiate competitive opportunities\n28 until after such efforts could be personally beneficial to him.\n46\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 47 of 147\n1 a. As set forth above, Burch testified that 6 of the\n2 10 PAC-10 teams had women on the team during the time he was a\n3 coach; however, no UC Davis female wrestler ever competed against\n4 any of these women.\n5 b. While Menlo College had a women’s wrestling club\n6 and a coach known for his support of women’s wrestling\n7 opportunities, Burch never set up a dual meet between the Menlo\n8 College club and the UC Davis women wrestlers.\n9 c. While Burch testified that there were a number of\n10 events and open tournaments he could have scheduled, the women\n11 wrestlers at UC Davis competed in only a handful of events over\n12 the period when Burch was the head coach of the men’s varsity\n13 wresting program.  Indeed, in the over two full years that she\n14 was an unofficial member of the men’s team, Ng competed in only\n15 one event, unaccompanied by Burch and not on behalf of UC Davis. \n16 d. Burch testified that he lacked “institutional\n17 support” for finding competition for women.  However, there was\n18 no evidence that (1) additional funding was necessary to schedule\n19 more competitions; (2) Burch requested such additional funding;\n20 or (3) Burch lacked the authority to reapportion his own budget\n21 to better pursue more competitive opportunities for women\n22 wrestlers.  Rather, Burch’s claimed lack of “institutional\n23 support” is based purely on his vague conclusions that the\n24 “administration” did not support women wrestlers. \n25 237. Burch did not begin advocating for the establishment of\n26 separate women’s intercollegiate wrestling team until it became\n27\n28\n47\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 48 of 147\n1 tied to the prospect of his attaining full-time coaching\n2 status.24\n3 a. At the end of the winter quarter in 2000, Burch\n4 and Gill-Fisher discussed the prospects of Burch attaining\n5 full-time coaching status.  Gill-Fisher explained that per UC\n6 Davis’ gender equity plan, the next head coaches to go full-time\n7 would be from women’s intercollegiate teams.  In response, Burch\n8 suggested designating women’s wrestling as a separate varsity\n9 team; Gill-Fisher pointed out that several other women’s club\n10 sports were closer to meeting the requirements for an\n11 intercollegiate team.  (TT 1677:14-1679:5.)\n12 b. At the end of the meeting, Burch said he “didn’t\n13 give an F-- about Title IX” before storming out and slamming the\n14 office door.  (TT 1677:14-1679:5.)25\n15 c. Burch never approached Warzecka regarding starting\n16 a women’s team, needing funding for such a team, or whether he\n17 could create a competitive schedule for such a team.  (TT\n18 1104:21-25.)\n19\n20\n24 As set forth infra, the first complaints and various\n21\npublic protests and meetings relating to wrestling, including\nwomen’s varsity status, began in April 2001.\n22\n25 The court finds that Burch’s testimony that he had\n23\n“numerous conversations” on unspecified dates regarding women’s\nwrestling is not credible.  (See TT 315:6-317:9.)\n24\nAt an unspecified time, Burch left an unlabeled envelope\n25 containing a packet about women’s wrestling for Gill-Fisher in\nher athletic department box without a note.  Gill-Fisher believed\n26 it had been misfiled and was intended for Burch so she placed it\nin his inbox.  Burch did not subsequently discuss the packet with\n27 Gill-Fisher.  (TT 318:23-319:7; 1679:6-1680:2; PX 206.)  This is\nnot evidence of serious advocacy for women’s wrestling by Burch\n28 or a lack of support for women’s wrestling by Gill-Fisher.\n48\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 49 of 147\n1 d. By contrast, when coaches Williams and Vochatzer\n2 saw there was sufficient interest and available intercollegiate\n3 competition in women’s cross-country and women’s indoor track &\n4 field, they took affirmative steps to work with their respective\n5 Athletic Directors to develop teams in those sports.  (TT\n6 1511:1-1512:14; 1562:6-1565:22; 2045:18-2050:19.)\n7 238. Moreover, Burch only attempted to award scholarship\nafter\n8 money to women wrestlers   he was notified in May 2001 that\n9 his contract would not be renewed.  (JX 68 (request in e-mail\n10 dated June 14, 2001); TT 445:10-15.)\n11 a. Before being notified of the non-renewal of his\n12 contract, but after being notified that the women wrestlers had\n13 been reinstated on the varsity roster, Burch submitted\n14 scholarship requests for the next year; none of the women\n15 wrestler’s names were on this list.  (DX A5; TT 441:4-445:15.)\n16 b. UC Davis had a policy that outgoing coaches do not\n17 participate in grant decisions and the incoming coach determines\n18 who receives grant-in-aid awards.  (TT 2122:18-2124:25; JX 69.)\n19 239. Burch manipulated the wrestling team to participate in\n20 public protests and to circulate petitions for his own interest. \n21 (TT 1456:19-1457:11.)\n22 a. Burch told the wrestling team that to save the\n23 wrestling team itself, they should join in public protests to\n24 return the women wrestlers to the roster.  (TT 1455:10-21.)\n25 b. In flyers distributed at a protest in May 2001,\n26 allegations were made that, in addition to being guilty of sex\n27 discrimination, the UC Davis athletic department also underfunded\n28 minor sports, such as wrestling, and mistreated coaches and staff\n49\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 50 of 147\n1 members, such as Burch.  (TT 745:20-749:8; PX 89; see TT\n2 200:13-203:6; 541:10-542:8.)\n3 c. Petitions that circulated around campus called not\n4 only for “reinstatement” of the women wrestlers on the varsity\n5 team, but also that “all head coaching position be promoted to\n6 full-time positions.”  (PX 86.) \n7 F. Events Related to Wrestling at UC Davis in 2000-2001\n8 240. In 2000, UC Davis implemented a roster management plan\n9 to limit the size of its men’s teams.  In Fall 2000, Warzecka\n10 sent a letter to the coaches of all men’s intercollegiate teams\n11 advising them of the maximum size of their team roster.  (TT\n12 2099:13-25; JX 44.)\n13 241. On October 9, 2000, Warzecka gave Burch the roster cap\n14 for wrestling.  Men’s wrestling was initially given a roster cap\n15 of 30 student-athletes, which would allow for three wrestlers in\n16 each of the ten weight classes used in intercollegiate wrestling. \n17 (TT 2100:1-2, 2102:19-2103:2; 2283:14-2284:2 (number of weight\n18 classes); 407:24-408:23; JX 44.)  The roster cap number was\n19 increased to 34 at Burch’s request.  (TT 410:7-412:18;\n20 2101:6-2102:18; JX 45.)\n21 242. Warzecka did not care who Burch selected to fill the\n22 allotted roster spots or what gender they were, so long as Burch\n23 did not exceed the maximum roster size.  (TT 2100:6-15, 2103:3-9)\n24 a. Warzecka’s testimony is consistent with the\n25 testimony of every UC Davis intercollegiate coach, aside from\n26 Burch, questioned at trial on this issue.  These coaches\n27 testified that they had complete discretion to select who made\n28 their teams; at no time did UC Davis athletic administrators tell\n50\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 51 of 147\n1 them who to recruit, sponsor, or place on the team.  (TT\n2 1472:6-10; 1493:11-14; 1517:1-11; 1551:4-1553:10.)\n3 b. Further, Burch admitted that for his first five\n4 years he had the sole authority to choose which wrestlers were\n5 selected for the wrestling team.  (TT 414:6-22; 2080:16-2081:14.)\n6 c. As such, the court finds that Burch’s testimony\n7 that Warzecka and/or Gill-Fisher “ordered” him not to allot any\n8 of the roster spots to women is not credible.  (See TT 415:2-24.)\n9 d. The court also accepts the credible testimony of\n10 Warzecka and Gill-Fisher that they never restricted a coach’s\n11 ability, including Burch’s ability, to recruit or sponsor a\n12 student-athlete, so long as rules relating to admission and\n13 sponsorship were otherwise followed.26  (TT 1668:25-1669:19;\n14 2081:8-2081:1.)\n15 243. Warzecka met with Burch in October 2000 to discuss the\n16 roster cap for the wrestling team.  Warzecka asked Burch what he\n17 was going to do with the women wrestlers.  Burch responded, “I\n18 don’t give a damn about those women, they can’t compete with\n19 anybody on the men’s roster.”  (TT 1087:17-1088:3.)\n20 244. Warzecka’s immediate response was to suggest that Burch\n21 form a club sport (1) to give the women an opportunity to\n22 participate and compete; and (2) to promote and market women’s\n23 wrestling.  (TT 1088:19-23.)\n24 245. Burch did not suggest implementing a separate roster\n25 cap for women wrestlers.  (TT 2104:7-2105:5.)\n26\n27 26 Indeed, Gill Fisher was aware that Burch recruited and\nsponsored Samantha Reinis, a female wrestler, and had no\n28 objection.  (TT 1669:6-19.)\n51\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 52 of 147\n1 246. Burch filled the 34 roster spots with male students. \n2 His final roster included a cover memorandum stating that final\n3 cuts had been made and the women were being moved to club status. \n4 (TT 324:24-325:12; JX 46.)\n5 247. Burch did not tell plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng that he\n6 had a limited number of roster spots when he falsely informed\n7 them that Warzecka had ordered them off the roster.  (TT\n8 423:3-424:6.)\n9 248. After removing them from the 2000-01 roster, Burch let\n10 the women wrestlers continue to attend practices in Fall 2000,\n11 with access to the weight room and training services.  (TT\n12 424:7-425:6.)\n13 249. This situation did not come to Gill-Fisher and\n14 Warzecka’s attention until January 2001 when Mansourian injured\n15 her neck and sought training services, which was a significant\n16 insurance concern for UC Davis.  (TT 167:9-169:25;\n17 2106:14-2107:25.)\n18 250. Mansourian received training services before being sent\n19 to the emergency room.  (TT 168:25-169:17.)\n20 251. Following Mansourian’s injury, Warzecka met with\n21 Mansourian and Ng in January 2001.  Warzecka met with them to\n22 explain that, because Burch had not included them on the roster,\n23 they were not covered by the intercollegiate athletics insurance\n24 policy and that they could move to club status to use the club\n25 sports insurance policy.\n26 a. Warzecka’s concern about liability was based on\n27 his understanding and experience that, if an athlete was not\n28 covered by the University’s insurance policy and was injured, the\n52\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 53 of 147\n1 school could be liable for the injuries.  (TT 2106:14-2111:23;\n2 96:25-97:11; 490:14-18.)\n3 b. To facilitate plaintiff’s continued participation\n4 in wrestling, Warzecka made an exception to standard University\n5 practice by agreeing to (1) allow Mansourian and Ng to use taping\n6 and icing services; and (2) waive the minimum number of students\n7 required to form a club team.  (TT 2106:14-2111:23; JX 51.)\n8 252. In that meeting, Warzecka also expressed his concern\n9 that having women on the men’s wrestling team might lead to NCAA\n10 classification of the team as a mixed-gender team.  He was not\n11 clear how Division I rules and regulations would apply to a\n12 mixed-gender team, but later learned that the wrestling team\n13 could have been declared a mixed-gender team and continued to\n14 compete at the Division I level.  (TT 2108:9-2109:4; see also TT\n15 96:18-97:15.)\n16 253. Warzecka invited Mansourian and Ng to see him if they\n17 had any problems.  (TT 2106:14-2111:23.) \n18 254. The court finds that Warzecka was not hostile to\n19 Mansourian or Ng at this meeting.\n20 255. After the January meeting, Warzecka e-mailed Burch to\n21 inform him about the meeting with Mansourian and Ng.  The e-mail\n22 stated that UC Davis would work towards forming the women’s club\n23 team, and that Mansourian and Ng would be allowed to continue\n24 practicing with Burch, to use the weight room, and to use\n25 training services for taping and icing.  (JX 51.)\n26 a. Warzecka expected that Burch would help form the\n27 club by marketing and promoting it.  (TT 2111:8-2113:7.) \n28\n53\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 54 of 147\n1 b. Burch did not reply to the e-mail.  (TT\n2 427:11-429:10.)\n3 256. No evidence was presented that Mansourian, Ng, or Burch\n4 made any complaints about the wrestling situation from January\n5 2001 through the end of April 2001.  Neither plaintiff\n6 Mansourian, nor plaintiff Ng, nor any other woman wrestler filed\n7 a Title IX grievance against the athletic department prior to\n8 April 2001.  (TT 2337:20-2338:3.)\n9 257. On April 24, 2001, Mansourian and Ng filed a complaint\n10 with the OCR regarding their allegedly improper removal from the\n11 wrestling team.  (PX 83; Pretrial Order ¶ 42.)  Ng filed a\n12 supplemental OCR complaint dated May 14, 2001.  (PX 97.)\n13 a. Plaintiffs based their complaint almost entirely\n14 on the erroneous information that had been given to them by\n15 Burch.  (TT 161:24-163:14; 528:9-529:5.)\n16 b. Plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng admitted that they\nwere not concerned about the athletic program as a whole, just\n17\n18 their ability to wrestle.27  (TT 180:22-181:1; 534:23-535:6.)\n19 258. On or about April 30, 2001, defendants were notified of\n20 the OCR complaint when Mansourian taped a memorandum to\n21 Gill-Fisher or Warzecka’s office door.  (TT 124:4-12.) \n22 a. The memo stated that Ng, Reinis, and Mansourian\n23 had filed an OCR complaint because “the administration” had\n24\n25\n26 27 The court notes that plaintiffs’ failure to bring any\ncomplaints about the athletic program as a whole is not a bar to\n27 their ability to pursue their claims for money damages, as the\nNinth Circuit held that notice and an opportunity to cure is not\n28 required.  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 968-69.\n54\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 55 of 147\n1 removed them from the wrestling team.  (TT 178:24-180:21;\n2 535:7-536:2; JX 53.) \n3 b. Ng, Reinis, and Mansourian requested reinstatement\n4 to the wrestling team.  (TT 178:24-180:21; 535:7-536:2; JX 53.)\n5 259. On May 1, 2001, Gill-Fisher removed the notice taped to\n6 her door and showed it to Warzecka.  (TT 1688:8-1689:4; JX 53)\n7 260. Franks and Shimek conducted an investigation into\n8 plaintiffs’ claims, and Shimek opened the lines of communication\n9 with OCR regarding the complaint.  (TT 2371:11-2372:7; 2378:5-\n10 2379:1.)\n11 261. Shimek and Franks concluded that there had been a\n12 misunderstanding regarding the women’s status on the men’s\n13 wrestling team and decided an equitable resolution would be to\n14 reinstate them to the team, as they had requested.  (TT\n15 1225:22-1226:16; 2372:15-2373:18.)\n16 262. Warzecka wrote Burch on May 9, 2001, asking him to\n17 reinstate the women to the team.  (TT 2114:8-25; JX 55.)\n18 263. Burch refused to reinstate the women, claiming that\n19 because it was not his idea to remove the women from the roster\n20 in Fall 2000, he should not be the one to reinstate the women. \n21 (TT 431:13-432:18; 2115:1-14; PX 94.)\n22 264. Accordingly, in order to avoid putting the women\n23 student-athletes in the middle of a dispute between Burch and\n24 Warzecka, Franks reinstated them himself on May 10, 2001.  (TT\n25 1225:22-1226:10; JX 56.) \n26 265. As a result, within ten days of receiving notice of the\n27 complaint requesting reinstatement, defendants reinstated the\n28\n55\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 56 of 147\n1 women to the men’s varsity wrestling roster.  (TT 1225:22-1227:2;\n2 see TT 181:14-182:25; 536:6-22; JX 56.)\n3 a. Reinstatement was not illusory; although regular\n4 season competition for wrestling was over in May 2001, plaintiffs\n5 could still attend practices, train, and use the weight room. \n6 (TT 1689:16-1690:18.)\n7 b. Reinstatement returned Mansourian and Ng to the\n8 position they had before Burch cut them from the team – eligible\n9 to compete for a spot on the team.  (TT 2372:15-2373:18; JX 55.)\n10 266. Despite having requested reinstatement, on or about May\n11 11, 2001, Mansourian and Ng responded by stating they could not\n12 accept reinstatement until they conferred with their attorney. \n13 (JX 57.)\n14 267. Franks responded that he understood and respected their\n15 intention to discuss the matter with others before deciding; he\n16 also offered to meet with Mansourian and Ng if they thought it\n17 would be helpful.  (TT 184:15-25; JX 57.)\n18 268. On May 16, 2001, Franks met with Ng and Mansourian. \n19 Franks agreed to look into issues raised by plaintiffs, including\n20 (1) whether UC Davis would establish a separate roster cap for\n21 women wrestlers; (2) whether UC Davis would waive the minimum\n22 number of students required for creation of a women’s wrestling\n23 club sport team; and (3) whether the club team could practice at\n24 the same time as the intercollegiate team.  (TT 1241:2-1242:19;\n25 see TT 185:11-13; 537:8-14; 1245:20-1246:2.) \n26 269. Franks consulted with Warzecka, Shimek, and\n27 Gill-Fisher, who, in turn, consulted with various outside\n28 experts.  (TT 1242:22-1243:3.)  Specifically, UC Davis consulted\n56\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 57 of 147\n1 Title IX attorneys Janet Justus and Janet Judge regarding whether\n2 the campus should create a separate roster for women wrestlers. \n3 (TT 1691:25-1693:19.)  Based on their advice, UC Davis decided\n4 not to create a separate roster on the men’s varsity team for\n5 women wrestlers.  (TT 1242:22-1244:13.)\n6 270. Franks provided a response to Mansourian and Ng on May\n7 17, 2001.  (TT 1241:24-1244:13, 1245:20-1246: 17; JX 58.)\n8 a. Franks understood that plaintiffs did not want to\n9 have to compete against men for the limited number of spots on\n10 the men’s wrestling team, but believed that allowing them to be\n11 on an intercollegiate team solely because of their gender and\n12 without having the requisite skills would violate the law.  (TT\n13 1181:11-25.)\n14 b. Franks also believed that creating a separate cap\n15 for women wrestlers would be unfair to other students who also\n16 hoped to be on the wrestling team or any other intercollegiate\n17 team.  (TT 1244:15-1245:19 (“There’s a global perspective here\n18 that’s very important.  I had two to four women who had an issue. \n19 Had I done what they recommended, I would have had 24,000 reasons\n20 not to do that because we would have bypassed a process by which\n21 we establish teams or permitted people separately or\n22 independently somehow to make a team without whatever the normal\n23 competitive process was.”).)\n24 c. However, the administration agreed to waive the\n25 minimum number of participants necessary to form a club sport\n26 team because plaintiffs did not believe they would be able to\n27 find ten students who were interested in forming a club team. \n28 (TT 1241:24-1244:13; 1246:11-17; JX 58.)\n57\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 58 of 147\n1 d. The administration also informed plaintiffs\n2 Mansourian and Ng that it would allow a wrestling club team to\n3 practice at the same time as the intercollegiate wrestling team. \n4 (TT 1245:20-1246:10; JX 58.)\n5 271. Mansourian and Ng were not willing to accept\n6 reinstatement; they wanted a contract guaranteeing them a spot on\n7 the wrestling team the next year.  (TT 538:21-540:12; PX 105.)\n8 272. On May 31, 2001, the OCR sent a letter addressed to\n9 Chancellor Vanderhoef, with attention to Shimek, indicating that\n10 OCR had closed the complaint regarding the wrestling team.  (TT\n11 2375:11-2377:1; JX 61.)\n12 273. In October 2001, OCR confirmed the terms of a Voluntary\n13 Resolution Plan (“VRP”), providing that women wrestlers would\n14 have the opportunity to compete for roster positions and that UC\n15 Davis would support any efforts to form a wrestling club that\n16 would include any interested women.  (TT 2384:17-2387:23; DX CC.)\n17 a. UC Davis relied on the VRP in their handling of\n18 the women wrestler’s complaints.  (TT 2125:12-2127:16;\n19 2171:8-2172:6; 2173:8-9; see TT 1723:21-1725:1; DX AA.)\n20 b. OCR did not request or require that UC Davis\n21 establish a separate women’s wrestling team or have a women-only\n22 try-out to make the team.  (TT 2387:24-2388:3.)\n23 1. Student Protests and Meetings\n24 274. In May 2001, Michael Maben, chosen as captain of the\n25 wrestling team by Burch, organized the “Operation Mayhem” protest\n26 at the Aggie Auction, the biggest fundraiser of the year for UC\n27 Davis intercollegiate athletics.  Wrestlers snuck into the\n28 auction, took off their formal clothes to reveal wrestling\n58\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 59 of 147\n1 singlets, carried signs, and distributed flyers.  The flyers\n2 alleged that the athletic program engaged in sexual\n3 discrimination, misappropriated student funds, underfunded minor\nmistreated coaches\n4 sports, and   and staff.  (TT 739:10-20,\n5 745:20-749:8; PX 89; see TT 200:13-203:6; 541:10-542:8.)\n6 275. Plaintiffs’ complaints regarding wrestling were also\n7 discussed by the Associated Students of UC Davis (“ASUCD”).\n8 276. Mansourian and Ng accused Warzecka and Gill-Fisher of\n9 acting hostilely towards them at ASUCD meetings, but neither\n10 Mansourian nor Ng supported their allegation with any specific\n11 comments made or conduct by Warzecka or Gill-Fisher.  (TT\n12 171:8-9; 499:12-501:7.)\n13 a. Indeed, Mansourian cannot remember how many people\n14 were at the meeting, how big the room was, or where she stood in\n15 relation to Gill-Fisher when the allegedly “hostile” comments\n16 were made.  (TT 170:20-171:20.)\n17 b. Similarly, Ng testified that she “just got the\n18 sense” Gill-Fisher wasn’t going to support the women wrestlers. \n19 (TT 542:14-16.) \n20 277. As such, based upon the evidence submitted, the court\n21 cannot make a finding that Warzecka or Gill-Fisher were “hostile”\n22 to plaintiffs at ASUCD public meetings.\n23 278. Rather, there is evidence that both Gill-Fisher and\n24 Warzecka were unfairly targeted at the ASUCD meetings.\n25 a. Based upon Burch’s misrepresentations to\n26 plaintiffs, Warzecka and Gill-Fisher were erroneously blamed for\n27 removing the women wrestlers from the 2000-2001 roster.  (See TT\n28 742:1-743:6.)\n59\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 60 of 147\n1 b. Indeed, at one of the meetings, Burch accused\n2 Gill-Fisher of removing women wrestlers from the team based on a\n3 roster he presented.  Burch’s accusation is not supported by the\n4 roster itself.  The roster is a participation list that sets\n5 forth which wrestlers competed in an NCAA event in 1998-1999. \n6 Coaches prepare participation lists, and Gill-Fisher signs off on\n7 them in relation to her NCAA compliance duties.  Two women, Ng\n8 and Chiang, were crossed off the participation list in blue ink;\n9 Burch’s signature is in blue ink.  Gill-Fisher initialed the\n10 participation list with an “ok” in black ink.  Burch’s accusation\n11 against Gill-Fisher is not credible.  (TT 433:21-439:1;\n12 1702:10-1705:19; JX 40.) \n13 c. At least one observer at one of the ASUCD meeting\n14 described it as “vile” and that “there was nothing positive to be\n15 had out of it.”  Specifically, the witness observed that vile\n16 things were said about Gill-Fisher during the meeting; Gill-\n17 Fisher was accused of not supporting female student-athletes. \n18 (TT 1567:6-1568:7.)\n19 2. Involvement of Assemblywoman Thomson\n20 279. Also in May 2001, Burch and some of the women wrestlers\n21 met with State Assemblywoman Helen Thomson.  (TT 432:19-433:20.)\n22 280. Thomson wrote to Chancellor Vanderhoef on behalf of the\n23 women wrestlers, but did not receive an immediate response\n24 because Vanderhoef was out of town at the time.  As a result,\n25 Thomson threatened to withhold state funding for a planned UC\n26 Davis laboratory building.  (TT 1334:16-1337:12; JX 54; JX 59.) \n27\n28\n60\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 61 of 147\n1 281. A response was eventually sent by Provost Gray while\n2 Vanderhoef was still away from campus.  (TT 1337:15-1338:19; JX\n3 54; JX 59.)\n4 282. Upon his return, Vanderhoef personally communicated\n5 with Thomson in order to address her concerns about the treatment\n6 of women in the UC Davis wrestling program.  (TT 1338:22-\n7 1342:19; JX 65-66.)  Thomson withdrew her threat to withhold\n8 funds for the laboratory building.  (TT 1341:3-1342:13; JX\n9 65-67.)\n10 283. On June 7, 2001, Jennifer Alley, Executive Director of\n11 the National Association of Collegiate Women Athletic\n12 Administrators (“NACWAA”), e-mailed a number of Title IX experts\n13 affiliated with NACWAA, stating that Gill-Fisher was asking for\n14 help and support to aid UC Davis in responding to Thomson.  (TT\n15 1710:13-1714:12; JX 63.)\n16 284. The next day, Dr. Donna Lopiano, plaintiffs’ expert in\n17 this case, sent an e-mail directly to Gill-Fisher suggesting\n18 that, in order to lower the emotional level of the political\n19 controversy involving Thomson, UC Davis should issue a public\n20 statement that (1) it took such allegations seriously; (2) it\n21 would investigate them, including appointing a Blue Ribbon\n22 Commission; and (3) it would report back to Thomson.  (TT\n23 862:24-865:10; 1712:1-1713:18; JX 64.)\n24 285. On June 8, 2001, Gill-Fisher and Sue Williams met\n25 Assemblywoman Thomson at her home to discuss the wrestling\n26 situation.  (TT 1717:6-1720:25; 1528:15-20; DX X.)  That same\n27 day, Ms. Williams sent Thomson a copy of a letter a number of\n28 coaches had signed for publication in the Davis Enterprise\n61\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 62 of 147\n1 newspaper; the letter set forth the University’s position and the\n2 problems of allowing non-team members to practice with varsity\n3 teams.  (TT 1523:7-1529:22.)\n4 286. Thomson issued a press release stating that the\n5 Chancellor was now fully engaged in the women’s wrestling\n6 situation.  (TT 1340:17-1341:8.)\n7 287. On June 13, 2001, Vanderhoef offered, in writing, to\n8 appoint a Blue Ribbon Commission if Thomson so wished.  Thomson\n9 did not respond to this offer.  (TT 1342:4-1343:20; JX 66.) \n10 3. The “Wrestle-Off” Policy\n11 288. Burch’s career as the head wrestling coach ended in\n12 June 2001, and he was replaced by Lennie Zalesky.  (TT 445:10-15;\n13 2271:20-25.)\n14 289. During Fall 2001, plaintiffs Ng and Mansourian told\n15 Zalesky that they expected both a spot on the roster and\n16 scholarships, even though they knew that they could not defeat\n17 any of the male wrestlers in try-outs; they also threatened to\n18 bring litigation.  (TT 2274:23-2275:22.)\n19 290. Even after Burch left UC Davis, he continued to\n20 communicate with plaintiffs.  In September 2001, he advised them\n21 to make UC Davis cut them because “that helps your case.”  (TT\n22 446:21-448:9.)\n23 291. In October 2001, Zalesky conducted “wrestle-offs”\n24 between wrestlers of a similar weight class to determine who,\n25 based on skill, would get a position on the 30 person team.  (TT\n26 2282:10-2283:22.)\n27\n28\n62\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 63 of 147\n1 a. Zalesky had sole decision-making authority as to\n2 who would be placed on the men’s intercollegiate wrestling\n3 roster.  (TT 2284:3-15; 2128:12-14.)\n4 b. The wrestle-offs were consistent with the terms of\n5 the VRP approved by OCR and with the approach followed by coaches\n6 of other intercollegiate teams at UC Davis.  (DX CC; TT\n7 1469:13-1470:16; 1492:21-1494:1; 1515:8-1516:6;, 1551:15-1552:15;\n8 2263:8-25; TT 2564:1-2570:15.)\n9 292. In the wrestle-offs, Mancuso quickly pinned Ng; Ng was\n10 about 20 pounds lighter than Mancuso, but had no weight classes\n11 available at her size.  (TT 543:23-544:12 573:18-24;\n12 2284:22-2286:24.)\n13 293. Mancuso proceeded to wrestle-off against male wrestler\n14 Serokin who pinned her; Serokin was subsequently pinned by\n15 another male wrestler.  (TT 573:25-574:4; 2286:25-2287:16.)\n16 294. Besides plaintiffs Ng and Mancuso, several males were\n17 also eliminated from the men’s varsity wrestling roster as a\n18 result of the wrestle-off.  (TT 2287:17-2289:5; JX 50.)\n19 295. Mansourian declined to participate in the wrestle-off.\n20 She wrote Zalesky that “intercollegiate wrestling is too much for\n21 right now,” citing her work and class schedule.  (TT\n22 216:13-218:15; 2290:1-2291:5; DX BB.)\n23 296. Mansourian also indicated that she was interested in\n24 wrestling at the club level; she later completed the paperwork to\n25 form a wrestling club sport team.  (TT 216:13-218:15; 227:2-6;\n26 2290:1-2291:5; DX BB, DD.)\n27 297. However, Mansourian did not participate in club\n28 wrestling.  (TT 227:7-9.)\n63\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 64 of 147\n1 298. Mancuso and Ng also had the option to join the\n2 wrestling club sport team, as did male student-athletes who were\n3 cut from the men’s varsity wrestling team, but neither Mancuso\n4 nor Ng chose to join the wrestling club.  (TT 586:14-587:17;\n5 2302:9-2303:16.)\n6 a. Two of the male wrestlers who were cut from the\n7 intercollegiate team in Fall 2001 joined the wrestling club sport\n8 team and were later selected for membership on the\n9 intercollegiate team.  (TT 2303:9-2305:23.)\n10 299. After October 2001, plaintiffs Ng, Mansourian, and\n11 Mancuso did not wrestle with the men’s intercollegiate wrestling\n12 program again.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 43.)\n13 300. Zalesky invited women wrestlers to the January 2002\n14 Aggie Open by posting the event flyer on the UC Davis website and\n15 sending it to the coaches of the Menlo College and Lassen\n16 Community College women’s wrestling teams.  He also called the\n17 coach at Menlo College; he learned that the Menlo College team\n18 would be in Oregon at the time of the Aggie Open.  Zalesky\n19 expected women to wrestle in the Aggie Open and ordered medals\n20 for the women’s division.  (TT 2294:19-2301:5.) \n21 a. In an e-mail to Burch, with copy to Vanderhoef,\n22 Franks, Gill-Fisher and wrestling supervisor Larry Swanson,\n23 Mancuso criticized UC Davis for not publicizing the Aggie Open,\n24 though she admitted she did not know what efforts Zalesky had\n25 made to publicize the event.  (PX 151; TT 576:22-584:7.) \n26 b. On behalf of the four UC Davis employees copied on\n27 the e-mail, Zalesky responded to Mancuso and explained the\n28 efforts he made to publicize the event.  (TT 2294:19-2301:5.) \n64\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 65 of 147\n1 c. Mancuso responded to Swanson and Vanderhoef,\n2 stating that they should correspond directly with her and not\n3 have Zalesky respond on their behalf.  (TT 576:22-584:7.)\n4 d. As late as January 2002, Burch was still providing\n5 Mancuso advice regarding the controversy over women’s wrestling\n6 at UC Davis, and suggesting that Mancuso contact Helen Thomson\n7 again.  (TT 577:4-578:16; PX 151.)\n8 G. Availability of Intercollegiate Competition and\nInterest in Women’s Wrestling between 1998 and 2005\n9\n10 301. Between 1995 and 2001, no four-year California colleges\n11 had an all-women’s intercollegiate wrestling team.  (TT\n12 397:7-17.)\n13 302. Menlo College elevated their women’s wrestling club to\n14 varsity status in approximately Fall 2001.  (TT 397:14-17.) \n15 303. Lee Allen, the coach of the women’s wrestling club and\n16 later intercollegiate wrestling team at Menlo College, testified\n17 that he had no knowledge of any other California University\n18 having a women’s wrestling club program except California State\n19 University Bakersfield.28  (Allen Dep. at 66:9-12.)\n20 304. Kent Bailo, Executive Director of the United States\n21 Girls’ Wrestling Association testified that he knew of only four\n22 to six official varsity level women’s wrestling programs at the\n23 college level.  These included two institutions in California,\n24 one of which subsequently ended the program, and institutions in\n25\n26\n27\n28 San Jose State University began a women’s club in 2006. \n28 (Redman Dep. at 77:21-25.)\n65\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 66 of 147\n1 Oregon, Missouri, Kentucky, and Oklahoma.29  (Bailo Dep. at\n2 40:18-41-20.)  Bailo did not distinguish between two-year and\n3 four-year institutions or between NCAA divisions.  (Id.)\n4 Further, it is unclear whether these teams were in existence in\n5 the 2000-2001 or 2001-2002 school years. \n6 305. Despite assertions that women were participating on a\n7 handful of PAC-10 teams, there were no women wrestlers in any\n8 PAC-10 varsity dual meet lineups.  (TT 382:3-11.)\n9 306. Rather, women’s wrestling competition consisted only of\n10 open tournaments, which allow anyone to compete.  (TT 271:20-22;\n11 366:22-25; 2475:15-20.)\n12 307. The only open tournaments identified by Burch were the\n13 Aggie open, a tournament with California State University\n14 Bakersfield, the Sunkist Open, a tournament in the Bay Area, a\n15 tournament in Michigan, a tournament in Arizona, a tournament in\n16 Las Vegas, and a tournament in San Diego.  (TT 2471:22-2472:4;\n17 2479:15-20.)\n18 308. Competition that consists solely of one open tournament\nintercollegiate\n19 per year does not constitute legitimate \n20 competition.  (TT 1863:8-1864:18.) \n21 309. No proposal for elevation of women’s wrestling to\n22 intercollegiate status was ever submitted to the athletic\n23 department.  (TT 705:10-12; 1656:19; 1734:12-14; 2159:1-3.)\n24 310. Even plaintiffs did not believe they would be able to\n25 find ten students who were interested in forming a club team; as\n26\n27 29 He also noted that women’s programs existed at one\ntime, but were eliminated at institutions in Minnesota, Oklahoma,\n28 and Kansas.  (Bailo Dep. at 41:4-20.)\n66\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 67 of 147\n1 such, they requested, and the administration agreed, to waive the\n2 minimum number of participants necessary to form a club sport\n3 team.  (TT 1241:24-1244:13; 1691:25-1694:3; JX 58.)\n4 311. There is no evidence that any female student, including\n5 plaintiffs, ever participated in the wrestling club at UC Davis\n6 in the years relevant to this litigation.30  (See TT 227:7-9;\n7 586:14-587:17.)\n8 312. As of October 2000, Warzecka had reviewed participation\n9 rates in women’s athletics in high school, which UC Davis\n10 received from the California Interscholastic Federation.  (TT\n11 1104:3-7.)  He testified that at the time, more female athletes\n12 were participating on high school baseball teams than were\n13 wrestling in high school.  (TT 1106:2-6.)\n14 313. During the relevant time period, the NCAA did not\n15 recognize women’s wrestling as a sport or as an emerging sport. \n16 (See Redman Dep. at 162:12-13; TT 1106:20.)\n17 /////\n18 /////\n19 /////\n20 /////\n21 /////\n22 /////\n23 /////\n24 /////\n25\n26 30 Redman testified that he was informed that\napproximately eight to ten girls practiced regularly with the\n27 club team in 2006 and approximately eleven girls practiced\nregularly with the club team in 2007.  (Redman Dep. at 151:22-\n28 152:11.)  He had no personal knowledge of this information.\n67\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 68 of 147\n1 IV. Individual Defendants31\n2 A. Pam Gill-Fisher\n3 1. Employment and Duties at UC Davis\n4 314. Defendant Pam Gill-Fisher (“Gill-Fisher”) was a coach\n5 or administrator in the UC Davis Athletic Department from 1973 to\n6 2006.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 13.) \n7 a. UC Davis hired Gill-Fisher as a student in 1968,\n8 and then as a full-time career employee in 1973.  (TT\n9 1437:19-23.)\n10 b. From 1973 to 2006, she held various positions in\n11 athletic administration.  (TT 1591:4-1593:4.)\n12 c. From 1985 to 2003, she was an Associate Athletic\n13 Director and Supervisor of Physical Education.  (TT 1591:15-22.) \n14 d. Gill-Fisher became a Senior Associate Athletic\n15 Director in 2003.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 13; TT 1592:25-1593:4.)\n16 e. Since the 1970s, Gill-Fisher was an active member\n17 in the National Association of Collegiate Women Athletics\n18 Administrators (“NACWAA”), serving on the board of directors and\n19 as president in 2003-04.  (TT 1605:24-1607:16.)\n20 315. Gill-Fisher’s duties as an Associate Athletic Director\n21 and Senior Associate Athletic Director included supervising eight\n22 sports, coordinating sports medicine, overseeing the Compliance\n23 Office regarding NCAA and UC Davis athletic eligibility, and\n24 overseeing academic advising.  (TT 1593:5-19.) \n25\n26 31 The court notes that some Findings of Fact set forth\nsupra\nherein are repetitive of those set forth,  .  However, the\n27 court reiterates and expounds upon the relevant Findings of Fact\nwhere it clarifies each individual defendant’s role in the claims\n28 asserted against them.\n68\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 69 of 147\n1 a. Men’s wrestling was not among the eight sports she\n2 supervised.  (TT 1594:2-3.)\n3 b. Gill-Fisher’s compliance role as Associate\n4 Athletic Director involved NCAA and UC Davis athletic eligibility\n5 compliance.  (TT 1648:17-1649:8.)\n6 c. Gill-Fisher provided NCAA and University\n7 compliance training to UC Davis coaches through monthly meetings. \n8 (TT 1595:7-22.)\n9 d. Dennis Shimek, not Gill-Fisher, was the Title IX\n10 Compliance Officer and met quarterly with coaches regarding Title\n11 IX compliance issues.  (TT 1595:23-1596:9.)\n12 316. Gill-Fisher served as the Senior Woman Administrator, a\n13 position required by the NCAA, from 1991 until December 31, 2006. \n14 (Pretrial Order ¶ 13.)\n15 a. The key duty of the Senior Woman Administrator was\n16 serving on various NCAA committees.  (TT 1604:3-11, 1605:3-20.)\n17 b. The position of Senior Woman Administrator did not\n18 give Gill-Fisher any additional authority or responsibility at UC\n19 Davis regarding Title IX or gender equity issues.  (TT\n20 1604:15-1605:2.)\n21 317. Gill-Fisher was not responsible for Title IX compliance\n22 at UC Davis.  She did not have the authority to dictate which\n23 prong UC Davis used to comply with Title IX requirements\n24 regarding accommodation of athletic interests for women.  (TT\n25 1604:18-1605:2.)\n26 a. The campus and the Title IX Compliance Officer\n27 were responsible for ensuring UC Davis complied with Title IX. \n28 (TT 1649:4-8.) \n69\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 70 of 147\n1 b. Gill-Fisher did not have unilateral authority to\n2 change the scope of the athletic program to address issues of\n3 athletic participation opportunities.  (See TT 1621:19-23;\n4 1638:10-19.)\n5 318. Gill-Fisher’s primary involvement in Title IX issues at\n6 UC Davis was to evaluate and report to the relevant decision\n7 makers; she also recommended actions that she believed the\n8 athletic department should take. \n9 a. Her Title IX reports addressed both the “laundry\n10 list” of items related to the treatment of male and female\n11 athletes (i.e. equitable provision of coaching, training, and\n12 other services) and the equity of the intercollegiate\n13 participation opportunities available to male and female student-\n14 athletes.\n15 319. Gill-Fisher used her reports to advocate for changes in\n16 the women’s intercollegiate athletic program, including the\n17 expansion of women’s intercollegiate athletic participation\n18 opportunities.  (See, e.g., JX 17.)\n19 320. Gill-Fisher served on the sub-committee that wrote the\n20 January 1972 report about women’s athletics at UC Davis, which\n21 recommended that the campus should add women’s gymnastics and\n22 badminton as intercollegiate sports.  (TT 1616:10-1621:10; JX\n23 15.)\n24 321. Upon request of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs,\n25 she chaired the UC Davis committee that wrote the campus’ first\n26 Title IX Report in May 1976.  (TT 1613:24-1616:6; DX A.)\n27 322. In July 1978, Gill-Fisher and Barbara Jahn wrote a\ninter alia\n28 Title IX review, which recommended,  , that women’s\n70\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 71 of 147\n1 cross-country be considered an intercollegiate sport for 1978. \n2 The report also pointed out the need for improvement in securing\n3 equality for women athletes in use of practice facilities and the\n4 lack of a full-time coach for women’s gymnastics.  (TT\n5 1622:5-1623:12; JX 16.)\n6 323. In 1989-1990, Gill-Fisher chaired the committee that\n7 prepared UC Davis’ comprehensive Title IX report, which\n8 recommended establishing steps to increase women’s participation\n9 opportunities.  (JX 17, at 10-17; TT 636:19-640:8;\n10 1630:9-1633:13.)\n11 324. In March 1990, Gill-Fisher separately wrote a memo\n12 regarding Title IX issues that had arisen as the Title IX review\n13 committee report was being completed.  Specifically, Gill-Fisher\n14 expressed concern over the addition of men’s lacrosse and the\n15 size of the football team, which had a large squad size, a JV\n16 team, and a number of redshirts; she was concerned that the size\n17 of the football team was not justifiable.  (DX B; TT\n18 1636:24-1640:23.)\n19 325. Around the same time as the comprehensive Title IX\n20 review, Gill-Fisher began preparing periodic Title IX reports at\n21 the request of the Title IX Compliance Officer, Shimek.  (TT\n22 1627:10-1630:5; 2343:17-2344:10; PX 8.) \n23 a. The first such report was issued on June 23, 1989,\n24 and focused on “laundry list” items, such as coaching,\n25 facilities, and uniforms, and did not discuss compliance in the\n26 area of participation opportunities.  (PX 8; TT 1629:2-1630:5.)\n27 326. On June 27, 1991, Gill-Fisher submitted a Title IX\n28 review to then Athletic Director Jim Sochor, noting the\n71\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 72 of 147\n1 discrepancy in male and female participation rates and that no\n2 steps had been taken to establish steps to increase participation\n3 opportunities for women.  (JX 18; TT 1641:2-1644:5.)\n4 327. On December 20, 1991, Gill-Fisher submitted an update\n5 regarding Title IX compliance from June to December 1991, noting\n6 that participation opportunities remained a problem.  (JX 19; TT\n7 641:23-643:7.)\n8 328. On June 5, 1992, Gill-Fisher prepared the next Title IX\n9 review, again noting that participation opportunities were a\n10 major concern.  She testified that her concern was based on an\n11 understanding that Cal-NOW was investigating Title IX compliance\n12 at the California State University system and that diligence to\n13 Title IX issues was needed because the economic situation would\n14 make it easy to ignore regulatory compliance otherwise.  (JX 21;\n15 TT 1644:6-1644:25.)\n16 329. In November 1992, Gill-Fisher wrote a Title IX\n17 compliance memorandum to Athletic Director Keith Williams,\n18 warning of some backsliding on movement toward Title IX\n19 compliance.  (JX 22; TT 1646:2-1649:9.)\n20 a. In order to deal with participation ratios, the\ninter alia\n21 memorandum recommended,  , eliminating all junior\n22 varsity teams, establishing roster caps for all sports, and\n23 adding women’s crew and women’s golf.  (Id.)\n24 b. Gill-Fisher also warned that UC Davis needed to\n25 implement a plan to address participation ratios or face an OCR\n26 complaint or potential lawsuit.  (Id.)\n27\n28\n72\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 73 of 147\n1 c. Junior varsity football and men’s junior varsity\n2 basketball were dropped following the recommendation from\n3 Gill-Fisher.  (JX 26; TT 649:11-651:12; 1638:10-14.)\n4 330. In December 1992, Gill-Fisher alerted then Vice\n5 Chancellor for Student Affairs, Bob Chason, to the participation\n6 ratio issue and identified potential solutions, including capping\n7 men’s rosters and adding women’s sports.  (JX 23; TT\n8 1389:2-1389:25.)\n9 331. On May 27, 1993, Gill-Fisher wrote a strongly-worded\n10 Title IX report to athletic director Williams, expressing major\n11 concern over participation ratios.  (PX 25.) \n12 a. Gill-Fisher opined that the University was not\n13 providing women with participation opportunities as required by\n14 law.  (PX 25.)\n15 b. Gill-Fisher was concerned that football was\n16 mandated to have 180 participants but still had 250, while (1)\n17 there were 40 women on a national championship club water polo\n18 team, and (2) there was strong interest in forming an\n19 intercollegiate women’s crew team.  (PX 25.) \n20 c. Gill-Fisher testified that she took a strong tone\n21 in the May 1993 report because she wanted to get Williams’\n22 attention.  (TT 1649:12-1650:8)\n23 332. In September 1994, after funding for additional women’s\n24 intercollegiate athletic teams was approved, Gill-Fisher sent a\n25 memorandum to Shimek and Williams, thanking the campus\n26 administration for taking a step forward in Title IX compliance. \n27 However, she also recommended using roster caps for some men’s\n28 sports that had significant numbers of participants beyond what\n73\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 74 of 147\n1 was needed to field a competitive team.  (TT 1651:20-1653:25; JX\n2 26.)\n3 333. Gill-Fisher opined that the addition of the three\n4 women’s sports resulted in UC Davis’ compliance with Prong Two of\n5 the three-part test.  (TT 1661:13-23.)\n6 334. In December 1996, Gill-Fisher wrote Warzecka a\n7 memorandum advising that the addition of the three women’s sports\n8 would help, but not completely solve, the overall participation\n9 discrepancy.  She recommended managing the size of the men’s\n10 sports that may have had more participants than necessary for\n11 competition.  (TT 1661:24-1663:3; JX 35.)\n12 a. UC Davis subsequently adopted a roster management\n13 program, resulting in a vast improvement in the overall\n14 participation ratio.  (See JX 89.)\n15 b. She considered the improvement “a move in the\n16 right direction.”  (TT 1663:5-1664:7.)\n17 335. Gill-Fisher chaired the committee to add a new varsity\n18 women’s sport in 2003-04.  She contacted sports clubs and\n19 intramurals to solicit proposals; advancing gender equity was a\n20 primary factor in the selection of teams.  (TT 1726:5-1727:17; JX\n21 74.)\n22 2. Involvement with Women Wrestlers\n23 336. Gill-Fisher had no personal bias or animus against the\n24 sport of wrestling or women’s participation in intercollegiate\n25 wrestling.\n26 a. In her view, “there isn’t anything a woman should\n27 be denied the opportunity to do.”  (TT 1640:8-20; 1701:15-25.)\n28\n74\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 75 of 147\n1 b. Johnston testified that when she was a student at\n2 UC Davis, she knew that Gill-Fisher was a big supporter of\n3 women’s athletics.  Indeed, Gill Fisher asked Johnston to speak\n4 to some of her classes regarding Title IX and her experience as a\n5 female wrestler.  (Johnston Dep. at 50:1-11; TT 1656:24-1657:9.) \n6 c. Johnston also testified that Gill-Fisher seemed\n7 supportive of women’s wrestling.  (Johnston Dep. at 50:17-24.)\n8 337. Gill-Fisher testified that in her opinion there was\n9 never a separate women’s varsity wrestling team at UC Davis.  Her\n10 opinion was based on her understanding that there was never a\n11 separate roster, schedule, budget, or compliance meeting\n12 regarding women wrestlers.  (TT 1686:21-1687:4.)\n13 a. Indeed, on one occasion Gill-Fisher asked Reinis\n14 and Schwarzberg if they wanted to form a women’s wrestling team. \n15 (TT 1672:12-1674:8.)\n16 b. In Gill-Fisher’s opinion as an athletic\n17 administrator and an active woman in intercollegiate athletics,\n18 the best way to develop women’s wrestling would have been to\n19 start a women’s club team separate from the men’s intercollegiate\n20 wrestling team.  (TT 1672:12-1674:8.)\n21 338. The court finds that there is no credible evidence that\n22 Gill-Fisher acted in a hostile manner toward any woman wrestler.\n23 a. In 1999-2000, the Compliance Coordinator informed\n24 Gill-Fisher that Reinis and Schwarzburg had been attending\n25 wrestling practice for at least six months without physical\n26 clearance, which meant that the two women were not covered by ICA\n27 insurance.  After Burch asserted that the women didn’t need\n28 paperwork, Gill-Fisher went directly to Reinis and Schwarzberg\n75\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 76 of 147\n1 and asked them to complete the paperwork in her office, which\n2 they did.  (TT 394:16-397:1; 1669:20-1672:11.)  The court finds\n3 that this incident is not evidence that Gill-Fisher was hostile\n4 to women’s wrestling; rather, it confirms she was doing her duty\n5 to oversee compliance with NCAA and UC Davis athletic eligibility\n6 policies.32\n7 b. As set forth above, the court does not find that\n8 Gill-Fisher acted in a hostile manner toward plaintiffs at ASUCD\n9 meetings.\n10 339. Gill-Fisher had no role in selecting the wrestling team\n11 roster for 2000-2001 or for any other time.  (TT 1680:15-1681:8.)\n12 340. The claim that a women’s varsity wrestling team had\n13 been cut came to Gill-Fisher’s attention via an e-mail from the\n14 men’s varsity wrestling team captain, Maben.  Gill-Fisher\n15 responded that UC Davis had never actually sponsored women’s\n16 wrestling as a varsity sport.  She invited Maben to meet with\n17 her; he never did.  (TT 1686:2-15; PX 99.)\n18 341. Prior to the taping of the OCR complaint on the door in\n19 April 2001, no woman wrestler had ever told Gill-Fisher that they\n20 believed she was responsible for removing them from the wrestling\n21 team.  (TT 1688:15-20.)\n22 342. When the proposal of separate roster caps was made, she\n23 recommended that UC Davis seek the opinion of Title IX attorneys\n24 to determine whether separate men’s and women’s roster caps for\n25 the men’s intercollegiate wrestling team was a good idea.  (TT\n26 1691:25-1692:13.)\n27\n32 The court does not find Burch’s characterization of the\n28 event to be credible.\n76\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 77 of 147\n1 a. As a layperson, Gill-Fisher was skeptical about\n2 the possibility of separate roster caps in wrestling because it\n3 could open all men’s sports to separate women’s roster caps.  (TT\n4 1693:20-1694:3.)\n5 b. She did not believe the intent of Title IX was\n6 merely to “ramp up” the number of women participants in men’s\n7 sports if the women had no realistic opportunities to compete. \n8 (TT 1694:8-15.)\n9 343. Gill-Fisher was aware that OCR approved a process for\n10 conducting try-outs for the wrestling team.  (TT 1723:21-1725:1.)\n11 344. She was also aware that Zalesky intended to select\n12 students for membership on the team based on a demonstration of\n13 the skills required to compete against PAC-10, Division I\n14 wrestling teams, the conference and division in which the UC\n15 Davis men’s intercollegiate wrestling team competed.  This did\n16 not alarm Gill-Fisher, as she had used that same method for\n17 selecting team members when she was a coach.  (TT\n18 1723:18-1725:22; DX AA.)\n19 B. Greg Warzecka\n20 1. Employment and Duties at UC Davis\n21 345. Defendant Warzecka has been UC Davis’s Athletic\n22 Director since 1995 and is responsible for the overall direction,\n23 leadership, and management of the intercollegiate athletic\n24 program.  (Pretrial Order ¶ 12.)\n25 a. Warzecka reviewed and verified UC Davis’ EADA\n26 Reports.  (TT 995:21-996:4; 996:11-20; 1009:1-1016:13-17.)\n27 b. He also had significant involvement in decisions\n28 about adding or eliminating sports in the intercollegiate\n77\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 78 of 147\n1 athletic program.  (TT 981:11-23.)  However, these decisions were\n2 always made collaboratively.  (Id.)\n3 c. He was also responsible for overseeing UC Davis\n4 varsity team coaches and could reverse the decision of a coach if\n5 he thought it was improper.  (TT 979:20-980:21; 981:7-10.)\n6 346. At the inception of Warzecka’s tenure as Athletic\n7 Director, the athletic department was dealing with an unexpected\n8 budget deficit of over $400,000; it took until 2000-2001 to\n9 balance the budget and resolve the deficit.  (TT 2002:1-2006:7.)\n10 347. When he arrived at UC Davis, Warzecka inherited the\n11 responsibility of ensuring that the newly created women’s water\n12 polo, crew, and lacrosse teams were sufficiently established to\n13 begin competing in 1996-1997.  Warzecka planned to fully fund the\n14 three new sports before adding any more new teams, which included\n15 bringing coaches of the three new women’s team up to full-time\n16 status.  (TT 2028:12-2029:8; 2032:11-2033:9; 2037:9-2045:17; JX\n17 41, 43.)\n18 348. When he started, Warzecka met with Shimek and reviewed\n19 hundreds of documents to ascertain the status of gender equity\n20 issues at UC Davis.  (TT 2012:5-2013:8.)  Warzecka and Shimek\n21 agreed that the Title IX workgroup should be more active.  (TT\n22 2023:1-2028:10; 2362:14-2364:5; PX 59.)\n23 349. In December 1998, Warzecka received a letter from Linda\n24 Joplin at Cal NOW regarding the women’s athletic program at UC\n25 Davis, to which he responded.  (TT 2033:10-2034:18; JX 41.)\n26 a. Warzecka reiterated the goal of getting to within\n27 five percent of women’s enrollment by 1999-2000.  (JX 41.)\n28\n78\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 79 of 147\n1 b. He explained that women’s golf could not be added\n2 in 1998 because there was little competition in Division II and\n3 UC Davis already had women’s gymnastics as its lone, allowable\n4 Division I sport.\n5 c. He also explained that while he gave thought to\n6 adding field hockey, UC Davis did not have a proper facility for\n7 field hockey or the ability to fund one at that time.33  (TT\n8 2034:5-2036:22; JX 41.)\n9 350. In May 1999, Warzecka participated, as part of the\n10 Title IX workgroup, in creating a three year plan for equity in\n11 athletics.\n12 a. Per the EADA report for 1998-1999, the male to\n13 female participation ratio in athletics was within 7.2 percent of\n14 the male to female undergraduate ratio.  (JX 89.)  The stated\n15 goal was to reduce the ratio to 5 percent during the 1999-2000\n16 school year; Warzecka set the 5 percent ratio as a goal based on\n17 legal interpretations and a consent decree.  (TT 1039:13-25;\n18 2030:13-2031:11; see also TT 2361:15-2362:12.)\n19 b. UC Davis came within 1 percent of meeting that\n20 goal.  (JX 89.)\n21 c. The plan stated that athletics administrators\n22 would review whether it could add women’s golf, field hockey, or\n23 an equestrian sport every two years.  (TT 2037:9-2042:6; JX 41.)\n24\n25\n33 The court notes that the multi-use field, the funds for\n26 which plaintiffs complain should have been used to add women’s\nsports, provided a field surface suitable for a field hockey\n27 team.  (TT 2152:12-16; 2168:8-2169:11.)  Moreover, as set forth\nbelow, the funds could not have been used to add new teams\n28 because they were not in the general operating budget. \n79\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 80 of 147\n1 351. In the context of the Title IX workgroup, Warzecka\n2 participated in updating the gender equity plan in 2001-2002. \n3 (JX 48; JX 49; TT 2055:19-2058:16.) \n4 a. The updated plan kept the 5 percent goal and noted\n5 that it had not been achieved previously due to increases in the\n6 female undergraduate population.  (JX 49.)\n7 b. Assuming the female undergraduate population did\n8 not rise further, UC Davis planned to reach the 5 percent goal by\n9 continued roster management, particularly for the larger teams in\n10 men’s sports, and by adding another women’s sport if necessary. \n11 (JX 49.)\n12 352. Warzecka participated in drafting all of the remaining\n13 gender equity plans UC Davis had in place through December 2005. \n14 Although the format of the plans changed to match the NCAA\n15 template, the substance remained the same; the plan was to\n16 monitor the participation ratios, manage the size of the men’s\n17 rosters, and periodically review whether to add new women’s\n18 sports.  (TT 2059:5-2061:14; DX MM; DX PP.)\n19 353. In addition to the three teams added at the start of\n20 his tenure, Warzecka oversaw the evolution of indoor track &\n21 field into a separate women’s sport. \n22 a. Women had been competing in indoor track & field\n23 events before Warzecka came to UC Davis, but the school had not\n24 declared indoor track & field as a separate sport from outdoor\n25 track & field.  (TT 2048:18-2049:3.) \n26 b. At Vochatzer’s request, Warzecka increased the\n27 budget for track & field so that the team could compete in more\n28\n80\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 81 of 147\n1 indoor track & field competitions.  (TT 1565:2-22;\n2 2048:11-2050:19.)\n3 c. In the 1998-1999 school year, UC Davis declared\n4 indoor track & field as a separate sport.  (TT 2049:23-2050:9.)\n5 354. Warzecka implemented a roster management program as\n6 part of his efforts to achieve gender equity; he did so based on\n7 his understanding that roster management was approved in the\n8 decision of Neal v. California State University, 198 F.3d 763\n9 (9th Cir. 1999), and would help address the participation ratio. \n10 (TT 2064:20-2068:18; 2098:15-2099:12.)\n11 355. The review and planning Warzecka participated in with\n12 the Title IX workgroup led UC Davis to add the new women’s golf\n13 team in 2004.\n14 a. Warzecka appointed Gill-Fisher to chair a\n15 committee to review the proposals.  (TT 2142:13-2143:10;\n16 1726:7-1735:13; JX 80.)\n17 b. After receiving the committee’s review, Warzecka\n18 recommended that golf be added as the next intercollegiate sport\n19 for women based on (1) golf’s status as an NCAA and conference\n20 sport; (2) abundant intercollegiate competition; (3) popularity\n21 at the high school and junior college level; (4) UC Davis’\n22 receipt of numerous e-mail inquiries about the availability of\n23 women’s golf; (5) campus support for a women’s golf team; and (6)\n24 the availability of a local facility.  (TT 2160:1-2163:11;\n25 2241:23-2244:17; JX 81.)\n26 c. The other sports that had applied for elevation to\n27 varsity status presented challenges that golf did not, such as\n28\n81\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 82 of 147\n1 finding local competition or available facilities.  (TT\n2 2134:23-2158:25; JX 80.)\n3 d. Further, Warzecka had promised in December 1998\n4 that he would periodically review whether it was appropriate to\n5 add women’s golf in response to an inquiry from the President of\n6 Cal-NOW.  (TT 2033:12-2034:25; 1656:4-13, 1731:1-1732:8; JX 22;\n7 JX 41.)\n8 e. UC Davis’ gender equity plan also stated that the\n9 campus would review the potential for adding golf.  (TT\n10 2037:9-2042:6; JX 41.)\n11 f. Warzecka’s recommendation to elevate golf was not\n12 motivated by any sexually discriminatory motive; he recommended\n13 granting varsity status to a popular sport that both he and the\n14 campus had promised it would consider elevating.\n15 356. The actions taken during Warzecka’s tenure led to an\n16 expansion in the number of women’s participation opportunities\n17 from 211 participation opportunities in 1995-96 to 401 in 2005-\n18 06.  The participation ratio improved from 20 percent in 1995-\n19 1996 to 5 percent in 2005-2006.  (JX 89.)\n20 357. In Warzecka’s opinion, UC Davis was in compliance with\n21 Title IX’s equal accommodation requirement via Prong Two of the\n22 three-part test between 1995 and 2006.  (TT 2021:6-2022:5.)\n23 a. Warzecka did not believe the drop of over sixty\n24 participation opportunities in 1998-1999 and 2000-2001 took UC\n25 Davis out of Prong Two compliance.\n26 b. Warzecka approved of moving the JV teams to club\n27 status because he concluded the lack of competition was a\n28\n82\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 83 of 147\n1 legitimate reason and he “felt it was the right thing to do.” \n2 (TT 2071:9-2074:4, 2076:21-2077:7.)\n3 c. Warzecka testified that the rest of the drop was\n4 due to normal fluctuations in the size of some women’s teams,\n5 which rose again in 2001-2002 and 2002-2003.  (TT 2075:10-2076:2;\n6 JX 89.)\n7 2. Involvement with Women Wrestlers\n8 358. As part of the roster management program, Warzecka\n9 allotted a limited number of roster spots to each men’s\n10 intercollegiate team; the wrestling team had a roster cap of 30,\n11 which was increased to 34, for 2000-2001.  (TT 407:24-408:23;\n12 410:7-412:18; 2099:14-2102:18; JX 44.)\n13 359. Warzecka was aware that women had been practicing with\n14 the wrestling team and had “unofficial status” on it.  (TT\n15 2083:23-2089:2; 2090:11-14; 2092:20-2096:14; 2100:10-12; DX\n16 UU-YY.)\n17 360. Warzecka had no role in selecting the wrestling team\n18 roster for 2000-2001, or any other time; Burch chose to fill the\n19 roster for the 2000-2001 men’s intercollegiate wrestling team\n20 with only male students.  (TT 2105:8-2106:8; JX 46.)\n21 361. When Burch left the women off the roster, Warzecka\n22 suggested that Burch work with the women to form a club sport\n23 team.  (TT 1087:17-1088:23; 2104:7-2105:5.)\n24 362. Warzecka met with Mansourian and Ng, following\n25 Mansourian’s January 2001 throat injury to explain that (1) since\n26 Burch had not included them on the roster, they were not covered\n27 by intercollegiate athletics insurance policy; and (2) they could\n28 move to club status to use the club sports insurance policy.  He\n83\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 84 of 147\n1 made an exception to policy to allow Mansourian and Ng to use\n2 taping and icing services and to waive the minimum number of\n3 students normally needed to form a club team.  (TT\n4 2106:14-2111:23; see also TT 96:14-99:13; 490:8-491:10; JX 51.)\n5 363. The court does not find credible Mansourian and Ng’s\n6 claim that Warzecka was hostile to them during the January 2001\n7 meeting.\n8 a. Mansourian and Ng misconstrued other aspects of\n9 the January meeting, such as Warzecka’s discussion of liability\n10 insurance by claiming that Warzecka told them they were a\n11 “liability” and that he lied to them with regards to how NCAA\n12 rules applied to the mixed-gender team issue.  (TT 96:25-96:15;\n13 490:14-20; 491:3-6.)\n14 b. Further, Warzecka’s actions of allowing them to\n15 continue practicing with the wrestling team, waiving policies to\n16 give them access to the weight room and training services, and\n17 helping them form a club team by waiving minimum requirements are\n18 not consistent with Mansourian and Ng’s claim that he was hostile\n19 to them in the January 2001 meeting.\n20 364. After the January meeting, Warzecka e-mailed Burch to\n21 inform him about the meeting with Mansourian and Ng.  Burch did\n22 not reply to the e-mail.  (TT 427:11-429:10; 2111:8-2113:4; JX\n23 51.)\n24 365. Warzecka did not hear anything about the women\n25 wrestlers until approximately April 30, 2001, when he received a\n26 memo notifying him that Mansourian and Ng had filed a complaint\n27 with the OCR regarding the wrestling team.  (TT 2113:8-19; JX\n28 53.)\n84\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 85 of 147\n1 366. He immediately met with Gill-Fisher and contacted\n2 Shimek and Franks.  (TT 2113:9-2114:6.) \n3 367. Following an investigation to determine why the women\n4 believed the athletic department administration had removed them\n5 from the wrestling team, Warzecka promptly agreed with the\n6 decision to place them on the team roster for the remainder of\n7 the school year, as they had requested.  (TT 2114:8-25.)\n8 368. Following the protest staged by several wrestlers at\n9 the 2001 Aggie Auction in May 2001, Warzecka tried to meet with\n10 members of the wrestling team.  However, they stood up when\n11 Warzecka walked in the room and refused to talk with him.  (TT\n12 2117:25-2119:2.)\n13 369. On June 14, 2001, after it was clear his contract would\n14 not be renewed and after he had submitted his initial request\n15 that included only male students, Burch submitted a request for\n16 athletic grants in aid for women wrestlers.  (TT 2122:18-2123:22;\n17 JX 68)  On June 26, 2001, Warzecka sent an e-mail to Burch\n18 explaining that UC Davis had a policy that outgoing coaches\n19 cannot offer scholarships.  (TT 2123:23-2124:22; JX 69.)\n20 370. Warzecka hired Lenny Zalesky as the wrestling coach for\n21 2001-2002, and like all other varsity coaches, Zalesky had full\n22 authority to choose the members of the team so long as he stayed\n23 within the roster cap.  (TT 2125:4-23; DX AA.)\n24 371. Warzecka relied on the VRP approved by OCR and\n25 instructed his staff to ensure that try outs held by Zalesky in\n26 Fall 2001 were conducted in accord with the procedures approved\n27 by OCR.  (TT 2125:12-2127:16; 2171:8-2172:6; 2173:8-9.)\n28\n85\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 86 of 147\n1 372. Warzecka did not attend the wrestling try-outs. \n2 Warzecka did not know whether women would try-out, but later\n3 learned that Mancuso may have tried out.  (TT 2128:9-2129:15.)\n4 373. Warzecka did not have any contact with Mancuso other\n5 than a message she may have left for him.  She did not make any\n6 effort to go to Warzecka’s office.  (TT 558:8-22, 564:14-565:11,\n7 573:6-12.)\n8 374. Mancuso copied Warzecka and other UC Davis employees on\n9 an email she sent to Burch regarding her perception that Aggie\n10 Open was not properly publicized in 2002.  Zalesky responded on\n11 behalf of the UC Davis recipients.  (TT 576:22-581:25; PX 151.)\n12 C. Robert Franks\n13 1. Employment and Duties at UC Davis\n14 375. Defendant Robert Franks (“Franks”) was the Associate\n15 Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at UC Davis from 1994 to 2004\n16 (with short stints as Acting Vice Chancellor at one point and\n17 Interim Vice Chancellor at another).  (Pretrial Order ¶ 11.) \n18 a. A number of service units reported directly to\n19 him, including Intercollegiate Athletics.  (Id.)\n20 b. Defendant Warzecka, as the UC Davis Athletic\n21 Director, reported directly to Franks.  (Id.)  Franks provided\n22 Warzecka with direction regarding the operation of the athletic\n23 department and could override Warzecka’s decisions.  (TT\n24 979:4-19.)\n25 376. Franks reported to the Vice Chancellor for Student\n26 Affairs.  (See Sakaki Dep. at 11:2-12:20.)  The current Vice\n27 Chancellor for Student Affairs, Judy Sakaki, testified that if\n28\n86\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 87 of 147\n1 anything were to go wrong within her area of responsibility, that\n2 would ultimately be her responsibility.  (Sakaki Dep. at 50:1-4.)\n3 377. Franks was the Associate Vice Chancellor for Student\n4 Affairs when the student body approved fee increases that would\n5 fund three additional women’s varsity teams.  (TT 1196:12-\n6 1197:9.)  Franks approved Williams’ recommendation to add women’s\n7 water polo, lacrosse, and crew.  (TT 1199:25-1200:8.)\n8 378. Franks was aware that female athletic participation\n9 opportunities were not substantially proportionate to female\n10 undergraduate enrollment during the time period at issue in this\n11 case.  (TT 1210:1-1211:8.)\n12 a. Franks found it difficult to achieve Prong One\n13 compliance because women’s enrollment fluctuated from year to\n14 year.  (TT 1210:1-1211:1.)\n15 379. However, he did not direct Warzecka to eliminate\n16 opportunities for males because he understood the campus was\n17 compliant under Prong Two at all relevant times.  (TT\n18 1210:1-1212:9.)\n19 a. Moreover, he was “comforted” by the fact that over\n20 time, the differences in the proportionality disparity ratios\n21 were “shrinking.”  (TT 1211:18-1212:5.)\n22 380. Franks approved the roster management program. \n23 Although reducing athletic opportunities was counter to UC Davis’\n24 philosophy, Franks realized it was necessary to reduce the size\n25 of a number of men’s programs to comply with Title IX while\n26 dealing with resource constraints.  (TT 1214:18-1216:1; JX 37.)\n27\n28\n87\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 88 of 147\n1 381. Limited resources34 only made it possible to add one\n2 team, women’s golf, in response to the proposals submitted in\n3 2003.  Franks would have added every team that wanted\n4 intercollegiate status if there were resources to do so.  (TT\n5 1216:2-19.)\n6 382. As part of his job responsibilities to ensure gender\n7 equity in the athletic department, Franks reviewed UC Davis’ EADA\n8 reports and equity plans.  (TT 1141:2-10; 1142:15-17.)\n9 2. Involvement with Women Wrestlers\n10 383. The first time Franks became aware of any issue\n11 regarding wrestling was May 2, 2001, when he received a copy of a\n12 notice dated April 30, 2001.  The notice stated that several\n13 women wrestlers had filed an OCR complaint seeking reinstatement\n14 on the wrestling team.  (TT 1222:6-1223:21; JX 53.)\n15 384. Franks never told Burch that he could not include women\n16 on the wrestling team roster.  (TT 1221:12-20.)\n17 385. Once on notice, Franks immediately discussed the OCR\n18 complaint with Shimek and Warzecka.  (TT 1225:7-15.)  Franks\n19 agreed with Shimek’s suggestion that the women wrestlers be\n20 placed back on the roster of the men’s wrestling team for the\n21 remainder of the 2000-2001 school year.  (TT 1225:24-1226:10.)\n22 386. When Franks became aware that Burch refused to\n23 reinstate the women wrestlers, he immediately contacted them to\n24\n34 The court finds plaintiffs’ suggestion that defendants\n25 should have used funds that it provided for facility development\nand improvement and for athletic scholarships to add women’s\n26 teams without merit.  The undisputed evidence demonstrates that\ndefendants were required to use the money for the purposes stated\n27 on the initiative ballots, which did not include adding to the\noperating budget of the athletic department for the expansion of\n28 women’s teams.  (TT 1203:13-1209:9.)\n88\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 89 of 147\n1 inform them they had been placed on the wrestling team roster. \n2 He also offered to meet with them in person.  (TT 1226:11-1228:8;\n3 1236:12-1238:10; JX 56.)\n4 387. When Masourian and Ng replied by e-mail that they could\n5 not accept reinstatement until speaking to their attorneys,\n6 Franks advised that he understood and reiterated his willingness\n7 to meet again with them in person.  (TT 1239:22-1240:22; JX 57.)\n8 388. On May 10, 2001, a student demonstration in favor of\n9 reinstating the women wrestlers was conducted at the\n10 administration building, Mrak Hall, which houses Franks’ office\n11 as well as the Chancellor’s office.  (TT 1229:9-1234:13.) \n12 a. Franks was alerted that Ng had organized the\n13 protest.  (TT 1231:23-1232:16.) \n14 b. Protests were a common occurrence on campus.  (TT\n15 1232:17-24.)\n16 c. Franks had no objection to the protest, nor was he\n17 angry that it took place.  The protest went forward as planned. \n18 (TT 1233:5-1234:13.) \n19 389. Ng and Mansourian met with Franks on May 16, 2001, less\n20 than a week after he contacted them about being placed on the\n21 team roster; the meeting was cordial.  (TT 185:11-13; 537:8-14;\n22 1241:2-23.)  The women wrestlers never indicated that they had\n23 any problem with equal opportunity in the UC Davis athletic\n24 department, aside from their removal from the wrestling team in\n25 2000-2001.  (TT 1224:4-1225:6.)\n26 390. As set forth above, Franks agreed to look into issues\n27 raised by Plaintiffs, including whether UC Davis would establish\n28 a separate roster cap for women wrestlers, whether it would waive\n89\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 90 of 147\n1 the minimum number of students required for creation of a women’s\n2 wrestling club sport team, and whether the club team could\n3 practice at the same time as the intercollegiate team.\n4 391. As set forth above, after consultation with Shimek,\n5 Warzecka, Gill-Fisher, and two Title IX attorneys, it was decided\n6 that a separate roster cap would not be established.  However, UC\n7 Davis agreed to waive the minimum number of members required to\n8 establish a wrestling club and allow the club team to practice at\n9 the same time as the intercollegiate wrestling team.\n10 392. This was communicated by Franks to Mansourian and Ng on\n11 May 17, 2001.  (TT 1241:24-1244:13, 1245:20-1246:17; JX 58.)\n12 393. In May 2001, Franks contacted Bob Oliver of the NCAA to\n13 inquire about the number of girls wrestling in high school.  The\n14 numbers did not indicate to Franks that there was sufficient\n15 interest for UC Davis to consider adding an intercollegiate\n16 women’s wrestling team.  (TT 1217:13-1218:23.)\n17 394. Franks did not promise any of the plaintiffs a spot on\n18 the varsity team for succeeding years because he believed that\n19 should be determined by the coach.  (TT 1238:16-1239:4.)  He also\n20 believed that giving plaintiffs a spot on the team without\n21 requiring them to undergo a competitive process would be unfair\n22 to the rest of the student body, who would have to compete to be\n23 on an intercollegiate team.  (TT 1245:1-19.)\n24 395. Franks was not involved with wrestling team tryouts in\n25 Fall 2001.  He was aware that Zalesky intended to select team\n26 members based on the skills they demonstrated.  Franks did not\n27 believe it was unfair for women to have to try out against men,\n28\n90\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 91 of 147\n1 because they were trying out for a place on the men’s wrestling\n2 team.  (TT 1251:3-22.)\n3 D. Larry Vanderhoef\n4 1. Employment and Duties at UC Davis\n5 396. Defendant Larry Vanderhoef (“Vanderhoef”) was the\n6 Chancellor of UC Davis from 1994 to August 2009.  (Pretrial Order\n7 ¶ 10.)\n8 397. In general, the Chancellor is the chief campus officer\n9 and is responsible for the organization and operation of the\n10 campus.  (Id.)\n11 398. As Chancellor, Vanderhoef was ultimately responsible\n12 for approximately 25,000 undergraduates, over 5,000 additional\n13 graduate and professional students, and nearly 30,000 employees. \n14 (TT 1318:11-1319:25; 1324:13-17.)\n15 a. By necessity, the Chancellor of an organization\n16 the size of UC Davis must delegate responsibility to others,\n17 including the Vice Chancellors and Deans.  (TT 1281:1-1282:6;\n18 1318:17-1322:3.)\n19 b. Vanderhoef had trusted staff members who directed\n20 phone calls, e-mails, and mail to the appropriate administrators. \n21 (TT 1322:7-1324:8.)\n22 c. Vanderhoef delegated the responsibility of meeting\n23 with students regarding complaints to members of his\n24 administration.  (TT 1321:7-1322:10; 1359:15-25.)\n25 399. Vanderhoef agreed that, as the Chancellor, he had the\n26 ultimate responsibility to ensure there was gender equity in UC\n27 Davis’ educational programs, including intercollegiate athletics. \n28 (TT 1261:10-22; 1263:25-1264:6.) \n91\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 92 of 147\n1 a. However, Vanderhoef relied on his staff to carry\n2 out their job duties in an informed and acceptable manner.  (TT\n3 1268:24-1270:17.)\n4 b. He relied on the Vice Chancellor for Student\n5 Affairs to oversee intercollegiate athletics.  (TT\n6 1272:25-1274:12.)\n7 c. Vanderhoef relied on the Vice Chancellors to\n8 provide written gender equity plans as required.  (TT 1327:6-16.)\n9 400. For five or six years, Carol Wall was the Vice\n10 Chancellor for Student Affairs.  Vanderhoef had confidence in her\n11 ability to handle gender equity issues because she was a champion\n12 and spokesperson for those issues.  (TT 1325:6-21)\n13 401. Vanderhoef also relied on Franks, Warzecka,\n14 Gill-Fisher, and Shimek to address issues pertaining to\n15 intercollegiate athletics and gender equity.  He had confidence\n16 in their ability to address such issues in a fair and competent\n17 manner.  (TT 1282:2-6; 1284:3-6, 1285:4-25; 1325:19-1327:13,\n18 1331:14-1332:25.)\n19 402. Vanderhoef was frequently updated on the status of\n20 Title IX compliance in the athletic department.  He admitted that\n21 these updates were monthly, but could be as often as weekly “if\n22 there was lots going on.”  (TT 1265:6-1266:3.)\n23 403. While he was Chancellor, Vanderhoef received reports\n24 from committees related to Title IX and gender equity.  (TT\n25 1267:10-17.)\n26 404. Vanderhoef was directly responsible for dealing with\n27 political figures.  (TT 1330:24-1331:11.)\n28 /////\n92\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 93 of 147\n1 2. Involvement with Women Wrestlers\n2 405. Vanderhoef was aware of the women wrestlers’ OCR\n3 complaint.\n4 a. However, Shimek had dealt directly with OCR for a\n5 number of years, and Vanderhoef relied on him to respond to OCR;\n6 Vanderhoef was aware that Shimek did respond.  (TT\n7 1331:6-1332:16.)\n8 b. Vanderhoef did not personally investigate the\n9 allegation that the women wrestlers had been removed from the\n10 team because he had faith in Student Affairs, Franks, and\n11 Warzecka regarding the situation.  (TT 1340:7-16.)\n12 c. In May 2001, Vanderhoef heard from Franks that the\n13 women wrestlers’ discrimination complaint was baseless and that\n14 Shimek was “well in the loop.”  Franks informed Vanderhoef about\n15 the problem because the women wrestling situation was beginning\n16 to generate negative publicity.  (TT 2543:10-2545:25; PX 90.)\n17 406. After Assemblywoman Thomson wrote to him on behalf of\n18 the women wrestlers and threatened to withhold state funding for\n19 a planned laboratory building, Vanderhoef personally communicated\n20 with Thomson in order to address her concerns about the treatment\n21 of women in the UC Davis wrestling program.  (TT 1338:22-\n22 1342:19; JX 65-66.) \n23 a. After meeting with Vanderhoef, Thomson withdrew\n24 her threat to withhold funds for the laboratory building.  (TT\n25 1342:6-1345:6; JX 65-67.)\n26 407. In one of his communications with Thomson, Vanderhoef\n27 proposed that an independent or Blue Ribbon Panel be convened to\n28 assess the intercollegiate athletic program.  If Thomson had\n93\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 94 of 147\n1 indicated she was in favor of such an assessment and if the Vice\n2 Chancellor of Student Affairs had recommended that it be done,\n3 Vanderhoef would have agreed that such a process should take\n4 place.  (TT 1299:3-1300:19.)  However, Thomson never made such an\n5 indication, and the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs never made\n6 such a recommendation.\n7 408. Vanderhoef did not have any recollection of receiving\n8 any calls or e-mails from plaintiffs.  (TT 1324:9-12.)\n9 409. Vanderhoef also did not recall seeing the student\n10 petitions plaintiffs circulated.  (TT 1360:17-23; PX 86.)\n11 410. Vanderhoef was aware that there were newspaper articles\n12 about the women wrestlers.  (TT 1361:12-1362:4)\n13 411. Vanderhoef was also aware that there was an e-mail\n14 campaign relating to the women wrestlers.  (TT 1370:18-22.)\n15 a. He did not read any of the specific e-mails.  (TT\n16 1371:14-1372:7.)\n17 b. A rote response to some of the e-mails was sent\n18 out with his approval.  (TT 1372:8-11.)\n19 412. As of October 2001, Vanderhoef was aware that OCR\n20 considered the issues pertaining to the women wrestlers to be\n21 resolved, based on the VRP.  There was nothing that occurred\n22 after that date that caused him to believe he should take further\n23 action.  (TT 1334:5-15; DX CC.)\n24 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n25 I. Title IX\n26 Congress enacted Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n27 1972 to prohibit gender discrimination by educational\n28 institutions that receive federal funding.  20 U.S.C. § 1681; see\n94\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 95 of 147\n1 Barrett v. West Chester Univ. of Pa., No. Civ. A. 03-CV-4978,\n2 2003 WL 22803477, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 12, 2003).  Specifically,\n3 Title IX provides,\n4 No person in the United States shall, on the basis of\nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n5 benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal\n6 financial assistance . . . .\n7 20 U.S.C. § 1681.35  “Congress enacted Title IX in response to\n8 its finding - after extensive hearings held in 1970 by the House\n9 Special Subcommittee on Education - of pervasive discrimination\n10 against women with respect to educational opportunities.”  Cohen\n11 v. Brown Univ. (“Cohen II”), 101 F.3d 155, 165 (1st Cir. 1996). \n12 The goals of Title IX were “to avoid the use of federal resources\n13 to support discriminatory practices” and “to provide individual\n14 citizens effective protection against those practices.”  Id.\n15 (quoting Cannon v. Univ. of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 704 (1979)).36\n16 “[W]hile Title IX prohibits discrimination, it does not\n17 mandate strict numerical equality between the gender balance of a\n18 college’s athletic program and the gender balance of its student\n19 body.”  Id.; 20 U.S.C. § 1681(b).  As such, “a court assessing\nsolely\n20 Title IX compliance may not find a violation   because there\n21 is a disparity between the gender composition of an educational\n22\n35 At the time it was enacted, “Congress included no\n23 committee report with the final bill and there were apparently\nonly two mentions of intercollegiate athletics during the\n24 congressional debate.”  Cohen, 991 F.2d at 893 (citations\nomitted).\n25\n36 “Although the statute itself provides for no remedies\n26 beyond the termination of federal funding, the Supreme Court has\ndetermined that Title IX is enforceable through an implied\n27 private right of action, and that damages are available for an\naction brought under Title IX.”  Cohen II, 101 F.3d at 167\n28 (internal citations omitted).\n95\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 96 of 147\n1 institution’s student constituency, on the one hand, and its\n2 athletic programs, on the other hand.”  Id. at 894-95.  However,\n3 statistical evidence of disparate impact may be highly relevant\n4 to the determination of whether an institution violated Title IX. \n5 Id. at 895.\n6 A. Application to College Athletic Programs\n7 In practice, Title IX reaches the vast majority of all\n8 accredited colleges and universities.  Cohen v. Brown Univ.\n9 (“Cohen I”), 991 F.2d 888, 893 (1st Cir. 1993).  It wasn’t until\n10 1974, however, that institutions became aware that the statute\n11 applied to athletic programs.  (TT 897:7-9.) \n12 In 1984, the Supreme Court held that Title IX was “program-\n13 specific”; as such, “its tenets applied only to the program(s)\n14 which actually received federal funds and not to the rest of the\n15 university.”  Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 894 (citing Grove City College\n16 v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555, 574 (1984)).  “Because few athletic\n17 departments [were] direct recipients of federal funds . . .,\n18 Grove City cabined Title IX and placed virtually all collegiate\n19 athletic programs beyond its reach.”  Id.\n20 In 1988, in response to Grove City, Congress reinstated an\n21 institution-wide application of Title IX by passing the Civil\n22 Rights Restoration Act of 1987, 20 U.S.C. § 1687.  Id.  “The\n23 Restoration Act required that if any arm of an education\n24 institution received federal funds, the institution as a whole\n25 must comply with Title IX’s provisions.”  Id.  Accordingly,\n26 subsequent to 1988, there was no question that Title IX applied\n27 to college athletic programs.  Id.  However, as a result of (1)\n28 the “slow and steady” pace that even plaintiffs’ expert testified\n96\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 97 of 147\n1 was acceptable for social change of this magnitude and (2) the\n2 ambiguity regarding the applicability of Title IX to\n3 intercollegiate athletics, there was virtually no enforcement of\n4 Title IX with respect to intercollegiate athletics between 1980\n5 and 1992.  (TT 907:4-8; 857:9-19; 1791:11-23.)\n6 B. Relevant Regulations and Agency Action\n7 Title IX “sketches wide policy lines, leaving the details to\n8 regulating agencies.”  Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 893.  When Title IX\n9 was implemented, the agency responsible for enacting appropriate\n10 regulations was the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\n11 (“HEW”).  Id. at 895.  The HEW issued implementing regulations in\n12 1975 and the subsequent 1975 Interpretation.  See id.  The HEW\n13 was subsequently divided into the Department of Health and Human\n14 Services (“HHS”) and the Department of Education (“DOE”). \n15 Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 828 n.3 (10th\n16 Cir. 1993).  The DOE, acting through the Office for Civil Rights\n17 (“OCR”), is the agency charged with administering Title IX.  Id.\n18 The OCR released a clarification of its Title IX enforcement\n19 policies in 1996.\n20 The court must accord agency interpretation of Title IX\n21 “appreciable deference.”  Cohen, 991 F.2d at 896 (citing Chevron\n22 U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n23 837, 844 (1984)).  “The degree of deference is particularly high\n24 in Title IX cases because Congress explicitly delegated to the\n25 agency the task of prescribing standards for athletic programs\n26 under Title IX.”  Id. (citations omitted); see Mansourian v.\n27 Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 602 F.3d 957, 965 n.9 (9th Cir.\n28 2010).\n97\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 98 of 147\n1 1. The 1975 Regulations\n2 In 1975, the HEW issued implementing regulations to Title\n3 IX.  Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 895.  The regulations generally provide\n4 No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated\n5 differently from another person or otherwise be\ndiscriminated against in any interscholastic,\n6 intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered\nby a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such\n7 athletics separately on such basis.\n8 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(a).  Specifically, as applied to\n9 intercollegiate athletics, the regulations interpret the statute\n10 as requiring funding recipients to “provide equal athletic\n11 opportunity for members of both sexes.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c);\n12 45 C.F.R. § 86.4137; Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 897 (“Equal opportunity\n13 to participate lies at the core of Title IX’s purpose.”).\n14 There are two components to Title IX’s equal athletic\n15 opportunity requirement: “effective accommodation” and “equal\n16 treatment.”38  Mansourian, 602 F.3d at 964.  Title IX’s\n17 “effective accommodation” requirements derive from 34 C.F.R. §\n18 106.41(c)(1), which bases Title IX compliance, in part, on\n19 whether “the selection of sports and levels of competition\n20\n21 37 In 1979, Congress divided HEW into the HHS and DOE; at\nthat time “the existing regulations were left within HHS’s\n22\narsenal while, at the same time, [DOE] replicated them as part of\nits own regulatory armamentarium.”  Cohen I, 99 F.2d at 895.  For\n23 purposes of clarity, the court cites to the DOE regulations at 34\nC.F.R. § 106.\n24\n38 The “equal treatment” Title IX standard, in contrast,\n25 derives from 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(2)-(10), which has been\ninterpreted by OCR to require “equivalence in the availability,\n26 quality and kinds of other athletic benefits and opportunities\nprovided male and female athletes.”  Plaintiffs assert that they\n27 are not pressing any unequal treatment claims.  To the extent\nplaintiffs asserted such claims, the court previously dismissed\n28 them.  (Mem. & Order [Docket #226], filed Oct. 18, 2007.)\n98\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 99 of 147\n1 effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of\n2 both sexes.”  Effective accommodation claims “concern the\n3 opportunity to participate in athletics.”  Id.\n4 However, the regulations do allow for the provision of\n5 separate teams for men and women “where the selection for such\n6 teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is\n7 a contact sport.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b).  Nevertheless, “where a\n8 recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for\n9 members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for\n10 members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members\n11 of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded\n12 sex must be allowed to try-out for the team offered unless the\n13 sport involved is a contact sport.”  Id.  The regulations define\n14 “contact sports” as including “boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice\n15 hockey, football, basketball and other sports the purpose or\n16 major activity of which involves bodily contact.”  Id.\n17 2. The 1979 Interpretation\n18 In 1979, in response to numerous complaints alleging Title\n19 IX violations with regard to discrimination in athletics, the HEW\n20 issued a policy interpretation explaining the ways in which\n21 institutions may effectively accommodate the interests and\n22 abilities of their student-athletes.  44 Fed. Reg. 71413, 71413\n23 (Dec. 11, 1979), Ex. 3 to Joint Request for Judicial Notice,\n24 filed June 6, 2011 (“1979 Interpretation”), at 18.  The 1979\n25 Interpretation “delineates three general areas in which the OCR\n26 will assess compliance with the effective accommodation section\n27 of the regulation.”  Roberts, 998 F.2d at 828.  These three\n28 general areas are:\n99\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 100 of 147\n1 a. The determination of athletic interests and\nabilities of students;\n2\nb. The selection of sports offered; and\n3\nc. The levels of competition available including the\n4 opportunity for team competition.\n5 Id.\n6 With respect to the determination of athletic interests and\n7 abilities of students, the 1979 Interpretation sets forth that a\n8 university “may determine the athletic interests and abilities of\n9 students by nondiscriminatory methods of their choosing” so long\n10 as the methods (1) “take into account the nationally increasing\n11 levels of women’s interests and abilities”; (2) “do not\n12 disadvantage members of an underrepresented sex”; (3) “take into\n13 account team performance records”; and (4) are responsive to the\n14 expressed interests of students capable of intercollegiate\n15 competition who are members of an underrepresented sex.”  (1979\n16 Interpretation at 27.)\n17 With respect to the selection of sports, the 1979\n18 Interpretations clarifies that “the regulation does not require\n19 institutions to integrate their teams nor to provide exactly the\n20 same choice of sports to men and women.”  (Id.)  As applied to\n21 contact sports, “[e]ffective accommodation means that if an\n22 institution sponsors a team for members of one sex in a contact\n23 sport, it must do so for members of the other sex” if “(1) [t]he\n24 opportunities for members of the excluded sex have historically\n25 been limited; and (2) [t]here is sufficient interest and ability\n26 among the members of the excluded sex to sustain a viable team\n27 and a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition for\n28 that team.”  (Id.)\n100\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 101 of 147\n1 Finally, with respect to assessment of effective\n2 accommodation in opportunities for intercollegiate competition,\n3 the 1979 Interpretation sets forth the “three part test” for\n4 measuring compliance with Title IX.  Id.; see also Mansourian,\n5 602 F.3d at 965.  Under this test, a university may demonstrate\n6 compliance by showing that (1) “intercollegiate level\n7 participation opportunities for male and female students are\n8 provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their\n9 respective enrollments”; or (2) the institution has “a history\n10 and continuing practice of program expansion which is\n11 demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities\n12 of the members” of the historically underrepresented sex; or (3)\n13 “the interests and abilities of the members of [the historically\n14 underrepresented sex] have been fully and effectively\n15 accommodated by the present program.”  (1979 Interpretation at\n16 27.)\n17 3. The 1996 Clarification\n18 In 1996, the OCR published a clarification of the “effective\n19 accommodation” test.  (Ex. 4 to Joint Request for Judicial\n20 Notice, filed May 5, 2011 (“1996 Clarification”), at 36, 38.) \n21 The introductory letter from Norma V. Cantu, the Assistant\n22 Secretary for Civil Rights, emphasized that “the Clarification\n23 does not provide strict numerical formulas or ‘cookie cutter’\n24 answers to the issues that are inherently case- and fact-\n25 specific.”  (Id. at 39.)  Indeed, the letter expressly notes that\n26 “Title IX provides institutions with flexibility and choice\n27 regarding how they will provide nondiscriminatory participation\n28 opportunities” and concedes that an attempt to set forth such\n101\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 102 of 147\n1 formulas or answers would “deprive institutions of the\n2 flexibility to which they are entitled when deciding how best to\n3 comply with the law.”  (Id.)  However, the Clarification\n4 “provides specific factors that guide an analysis of each part of\n5 the three-part test” and includes examples “to demonstrate, in\n6 concrete terms, how these factors will be considered.”  (Id. at\n7 41.)\n8 C. Prong 2\n9 Plaintiffs assert that defendant UC Davis violated Title\n10 IX’s mandate to effectively accommodate the interests and\n11 abilities of members of both sex.  For the purposes of this\n12 litigation only, and for purposes of the Title IX claim only, UC\n13 Davis stipulates that during the time period it believes is\n14 relevant to the Title IX claim, the ratio of male and female\n15 participants in intercollegiate athletics was not always\n16 substantially proportionate to the ratio of male and female\n17 undergraduate enrollment at the University.  UC Davis further\n18 stipulates that during that time period, there was at least one\n19 sport for women that was not offered at the intercollegiate level\n20 for which there was (1) an expressed interest in competing at the\n21 intercollegiate level; (2) sufficient ability among interested\n22 students to compete at the intercollegiate level; and (3)\n23 arguably sufficient intercollegiate competition for that sport in\n24 the geographic area in which UC Davis usually competes.  Based on\n25 this stipulation, the parties agree that plaintiffs are relieved\n26 of their burden of proof with respect to Prong One and Prong\n27 Three of the three-prong test to establish a violation of Title\n28 IX.  As such, the parties agreed that UC Davis bore the burden of\n102\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 103 of 147\n1 proving that it was in compliance under Prong Two during the\n2 relevant time period.39  (Joint Stipulation [Docket #564], filed\n3 May 6, 2011.)\n4 Under Prong Two, an institution can establish compliance\n5 with Title IX by showing “that it has a history and continuing\n6 practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to\n7 the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented\n8 sex.”  (1996 Clarification at 42.)  “In effect, part two looks at\n9 an institution’s past and continuing remedial efforts to provide\n10 nondiscriminatory participation opportunities through program\n11 expansion.”  (Id.)\n12 In analyzing Prong Two compliance, the court looks at “the\n13 entire history of the athletic program, focusing on the\n14 participation opportunities provided for the underrepresented\n15 sex.”  (Id.)  “There are no fixed intervals of time within which\n16 an institution must have added participation opportunities,” nor\n17 “is a particular number of sports dispositive.”  (Id.)  “Rather,\n18 the focus is on whether the program expansion was responsive to\n19 developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.” \n20 (Id.)  Evidence of a history of program expansion may include (1)\n21 “an institution’s record of adding intercollegiate teams, or\n22 upgrading teams to intercollegiate status, for the\n23\n24 39 The court previously held that even if a “shorter, more\ncurrent period of aggressive remedial efforts may be highly\n25 relevant to establishing compliance with Prong Two, the court\n“must review the entire history of the athletic program in\n26 determining whether UC Davis was compliant with Title IX when\nplaintiffs were students.”  (Mem. & Order [Docket #545], filed\n27 Apr. 29, 2011, at 5.)  The court noted, however, that plaintiffs\nactual\nmay only recover damages based upon   harm that they\npersonally suffered\n28 .  (Id. at 6.)\n103\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 104 of 147\n1 underrepresented sex”; (2) “an institution’s record of increasing\n2 the numbers of participants in intercollegiate athletics who are\n3 members of the underrepresented sex”; and (3) “an institution’s\n4 affirmative response to requests by students or others for\n5 addition or elevation of sports.”  (Id. at 43.)\n6 The court must also assess whether the institution can\n7 demonstrate “a continuing (i.e., present) practice of program\n8 expansion as warranted by developing interests and abilities.” \n9 (Id. at 42.)  Evidence of a continuing practice of program\n10 expansion may include (1) “an institution’s current\n11 implementation of a nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for\n12 requesting the addition of sports . . . and the effective\n13 communication of the policy or procedure to students”; and (2)\n14 “an institution’s current implementation of a plan of program\n15 expansion that is responsive to developing interests and\n16 abilities.”  (Id. at 43.)  An institution’s “nondiscriminatory\n17 assessments of developing interests and abilities” and “timely\n18 actions in response to the results” are also persuasive evidence\n19 of a continuing practice of program expansion.  (Id.)\ngood faith\n20 At bottom, Prong Two “considers an institution’s \nactual program expansion\n21 remedial efforts through  .”  (Id.)\n22 (emphasis added).  The inquiry “focuses on whether an institution\n23 has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation\n24 opportunities for women, but provides institutions flexibility in\n25 choosing which teams they add.”  Mansourian 602 F.3d at 965. \n26 “The number of participation opportunities for women is defined\n27 by the number of female athletes who actually participate in\n28\n104\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 105 of 147\n1 varsity athletics.”40  Id. at 965-66.  Prong Two thus “focuses\n2 primarily, but not exclusively, on increasing the number of\n3 women’s athletic opportunities rather than increasing the number\n4 of women’s teams.”  Id. at 969. \n5 Increased proportional opportunities for the\n6 underrepresented sex reached solely as a result of the reduction\n7 of the overrepresented sex will not establish compliance under\n8 Prong Two.  (1996 Clarification at 43.)  “[T]he ordinary meaning\n9 of the word ‘expansion’ may not be twisted to find compliance\n10 under this prong when schools have increased the relative\n11 percentages of women participating in athletics by making cuts in\n12 both men’s and women’s sports programs.”  Roberts, 998 F.2d at\n13 830.\n14 Moreover, an institution may rely on Prong Two, despite\n15 normal upward or downward fluctuations in participation\n16 opportunities.  (TT 833:7-834:12.)  Indeed, both Dr. Lopiano and\n17 Dr. Grant testified that normal fluctuations may result in\n18 greater or lesser participation opportunities, based on factors\n19 such as a larger graduating class or a larger recruited class. \n20 (See TT 833:7-18.)\n21 The Clarification counsels that the efforts of an\n22 institution should be assessed from a flexible and case-specific\n23 approach.  As such, “[i]n the event that an institution\n24 eliminated any team for the underrepresented sex,” the court\n25 should evaluate the circumstances surrounding such action. \n26 “However, an institution can still meet part two if, overall, it\n27\n40 “[A]thletes who participate in more than one sport are\n28 counted as a participant for each sport they play.”  Id. at 966.\n105\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 106 of 147\n1 can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion\n2 for that sex.”  (1996 Clarification at 43.)\n3 The 1996 Clarification sets forth four examples to help\n4 illustrate in what types of circumstances compliance with Prong\n5 Two could be established. The three most relevant examples\n6 provide as follows:\n7 At the inception of its women’s program in the\nmid-1970s, Institution C established seven teams for\n8 women.  In 1984 it added a women’s varsity team at the\nrequest of students and coaches.  In 1990 it upgraded a\n9 women’s club sport to varsity team status based on a\nrequest by the club members and an NCAA survey that\n10 showed a significant increase in girls high school\nparticipation in that sport.  Institution C is\n11 currently implementing a plan to add a varsity women’s\nteam in the spring of 1996 that has been identified by\n12 a regional study as an emerging women’s sport in the\nregion.  The addition of these teams resulted in an\n13 increased percentage of women participating in varsity\nathletics at the institution.  Based on these facts,\n14 OCR would find Institution C in compliance with part\ntwo because it has a history of program expansion and\n15 is continuing to expand its program for women to meet\ntheir developing interests and abilities.\n16\n. . . \n17\nIn the mid-1970s, Institution E established five teams\n18 for women, In 1979 it added a women’s varsity team.  In\n1984 it upgraded a women’s club sport with twenty-five\n19 participants to varsity team status.  At that time it\neliminated a women’s varsity team that had eight\n20 members.  In 1987 and 1989 Institution E added women’s\nvarsity teams that were identified by a significant\n21 number of its enrolled and incoming female students\nwhen surveyed regarding their athletic interests and\n22 abilities.  During this time it also increased the size\nof an existing women’s team to provide opportunities\n23 for women who expressed interest in playing that sport. \nWithin the past year, it added a women’s varsity team\n24 based on a nationwide survey of the most popular girls\nhigh school teams.  Based on the addition of these\n25 teams, the percentage of women participating in varsity\nathletics at the institution has increased.  Based on\n26 these facts, OCR would find Institution E in compliance\nwith part two because it has a history of program\n27 expansion and the elimination of the team in 1984 took\nplace within the context of continuing program\n28\n106\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 107 of 147\n1 expansion for the underrepresented sex that is\nresponsive to their developing interests. \n2\nInstitution F started its women’s program in the early\n3 1970s with four teams.  It did not add to its women’s\nprogram until 1987 when, based on requests of students\n4 and coaches, it upgraded a women’s club sport to\nvarsity team status and expanded the size of several\n5 existing women’s teams to accommodate significant\nexpressed interest by students.  In 1990 it surveyed\n6 its enrolled and incoming female students; based on\nthat survey and a survey of the most popular sports\n7 played by women in the region, Institution F agreed to\nadd three new women’s teams by 1997.  It added a\n8 women’s team in 1991 and 1994.  Institution F is\nimplementing a plan to add a women’s team by the spring\n9 of 1997.  Based on these facts, OCR would find\nInstitution F in compliance with part two.  Institution\n10 F’s program history since 1987 shows that it is\ncommitted to program expansion for the underrepresented\n11 sex and it is continuing to expand its women’s program\nin light of women’s developing interests and abilities.\n12\n13 (Id. at 43-44.)\n14 In this case, defendant UC Davis has not demonstrated that,\n15 while plaintiffs were students at the University, it had a\n16 continuing practice of program expansion that was demonstrably\n17 responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the\n18 underrepresented sex.  Rather, the undisputed evidence\n19 demonstrates that while plaintiffs were students, UC Davis\n20 eliminated more than 60 actual participation opportunities for\n21 women.  Indeed, while in 1998-1999 there were 424 total female\n22 participants in student intercollegiate athletics, there were\n23 only 363 total female participants in student intercollegiate\n24 athletics in 2004-2005.  Such evidence demonstrates overall\n25\n26\n27\n28\n107\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 108 of 147\n1 program contraction of actual female participation opportunities,\n2 not expansion.41\n3 1. History of Program Expansion\n4 The court notes that UC Davis has a strong history of\n5 supporting women’s participation in athletics.  Indeed, in 1970,\n6 two years before the enactment of Title IX, “The Davis View”\n7 expressly contemplated the expansion and development of women’s\n8 intercollegiate athletic programs.  In 1972, UC Davis already had\n9 seven women’s intercollegiate athletic teams.  It upgraded\n10 women’s cross-country to varsity status in 1978.  Further, when\n11 it legitimately eliminated women’s field hockey at the end of the\n12 1982-1983 school year based upon the decreasing level of interest\n13 and viable intercollegiate athletic opportunities, UC Davis\n14 immediately replaced the sport with women’s soccer in the fall of\n15 1983.\n16 Moreover, UC Davis acknowledged its obligation to comply\n17 with Title IX even when there was virtually no enforcement in the\n18 1980s and early 1990s.  In the late 1980s, UC Davis hired Shimek\n19 as a Title IX compliance expert.  It also commissioned a\n20 comprehensive report in 1989, which was completed sometime in\ninter alia\n21 1990, to review,  , gender equity in athletic\n22 participation opportunities.  The report unabashedly found that\n23 UC Davis was currently not in compliance under any prong of the\n24 three-part test and recommended the expansion of women’s\n25 participation opportunities.\n26\n41 While the court notes the increasingly smaller\n27 disparity in proportional opportunities from 2001-2002 through\n2005-2006, this positive movement is irrelevant to the court’s\n28 inquiry under Prong Two.  See Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830.\n108\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 109 of 147\n1 In response, and despite state budget cuts that threatened\n2 to eliminate almost all of its athletic program,42 UC Davis\n3 retained all of its existing teams and added three new women’s\n4 varsity sports, increasing female participation opportunities by\n5 131 in the 1996-1997 school year.  These three new sports were\n6 added after a formal submission process that documented the\n7 interest of current and future female student-athletes, the\n8 availability of viable intercollegiate competition, and the\n9 ability to immediately locate and fund the resources necessary to\n10 support the sport.  Subsequently, UC Davis officially added\n11 women’s varsity indoor track & field in the 1998-1999 school\n12 year.  That same year, UC Davis achieved its highest number of\n13 total female participants with 426 female student participation\n14 opportunities.  (JX 89.)\n15 Accordingly, viewing the entirety of the circumstances, at\n16 the time the first plaintiff entered UC Davis as a freshman in\n17 Fall 1998, UC Davis had a history of program expansion responsive\n18 to the developing interests and abilities of women.  While the\n19 court notes the stagnation of expansion between the elevation of\n20 women’s cross-country to varsity status in 1978 and the addition\n21\n22 42 The court notes that financial concerns cannot justify\ngender discrimination.  “If a school . . . elect[s] to stray from\n23\nsubstantial proportionality and fail[s] to march uninterruptedly\nin the direction of equal athletic opportunity, it must . . .\n24\nfully and effectively accommodate the underrepresented gender’s\ninterests and abilities, even if that requires it to give the\n25 underrepresented gender . . . what amounts to a larger slice of a\nshrinking athletic-opportunity pie.”  Cohen v. Brown Univ.\n26 (“Cohen IV”), 101 F.3d 155, 176 (1st Cir. 1996).  However, the\ncourt acknowledges the efforts undertaken by UC Davis to expand\n27 women’s athletic participation opportunities while still\ncontinuing programs that would benefit both male and female\n28 student-athletes.\n109\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 110 of 147\n1 of three varsity sports in 1995, the court concludes that the\n2 shorter, more current period of aggressive remedial efforts,\n3 which resulted in the elevation of women’s water polo, lacrosse,\n4 crew, and indoor track & field, demonstrates a history of good\n5 faith remedial efforts through program expansion.  Cf. Roberts,\n6 998 F.2d at 830 (holding that the defendant institution could not\n7 demonstrate a practice of program expansion where the last team\n8 was added 16 years before the case was decided and three women’s\n9 sports had subsequently been eliminated); Cohen I, 991 F.2d at\n10 903 (holding that the defendant institution could not demonstrate\n11 a history of program expansion where there was “impressive\n12 growth” in the 1970s but no additional opportunities added over\n13 the next two decades). \n14 2. Continuing Practice of Program Expansion\n15 However, despite its best intentions to the contrary, UC\n16 Davis did not have a continuing practice of program expansion at\n17 the time plaintiffs were students.  Indeed, in 1999-2000, there\n18 were 424 female participation opportunities at UC Davis; the next\n19 year, such opportunities had decreased to 407, and the following\n20 year, they had decreased to 361.  While the participation numbers\n21 increased slightly in 2002-2003 to a total of 389 opportunities,\n22 they again decreased the following year to 373 and again the next\n23 year to 363.  It was not until the 2005-2006 school year that the\n24 participation rates rose again to 401 total female participants. \n25 However, this was still 25 less participation opportunities than\n26 in the 1998-1999 school year.  Under the circumstances, the court\n27 cannot conclude that UC Davis had a continuing practice of\n28\n110\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 111 of 147\n1 program expansion in the face of such a decline in actual\n2 participation opportunities.\n3 Of utmost significance to this court’s determination is the\n4 elimination of the junior varsity or “B” teams for women’s water\n5 polo and women’s lacrosse after the 2000-2001 school year, which\n6 accounted for approximately 30 lost participation opportunities\n7 for women.  The court notes that these teams were eliminated for\n8 legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons; the coaches of both these\n9 teams recommended that they be reinstituted at the club level to\n10 provide greater competitive opportunities so that athletes who\n11 did not have the skill to make the varsity team could potentially\n12 develop into varsity level athletes.  (See TT 1494:2-1495:6; TT\n13 1634:8-1635:10.)  However, while the elimination of these teams\n14 does not create a Title IX violation in and of itself, the\nfailure to replace these opportunities\n15  prevents UC Davis from\n16 relying on Prong Two to establish compliance.  Rather than\n17 expanding athletic participation opportunities, UC Davis\n18 contracted athletic participation opportunities through the\n19 elimination of two women’s “B” teams.  See Ollier v. Sweetwater\n20 Union High Sch. Dist., 604 F. Supp. 2d 1264, 1272-1273 (S.D. Cal.\n21 2009) (holding that “[a]lthough a slight decrease in athletic\n22 participation in a given year will not be fatal to showing\n23 compliance with Title IX,” defendants cannot establish Prong Two\n24 compliance where there is no steady increase in female\n25 participation).  At bottom, the University lost approximately 30\n26 actual participation opportunities, which were not the result of\n27 “normal fluctuation” and which it never replaced.  This, by\n28 definition, is not program expansion.  See Favia v. Indiana Univ.\n111\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 112 of 147\n1 of Penn., 812 F. Supp. 578, 585 (W.D. Pa. 1993) (holding that the\n2 defendants failed to demonstrate compliance with Prong Two where\n3 “the levels of opportunities for women to compete went from low\n4 to lower.”) \n5 The court concludes that even if it accepted Dr. Grant’s\n6 crediting theory, it still could not find UC Davis in compliance\n7 due to the un-replaced elimination of these varsity\n8 opportunities.  Dr. Grant testified that for purposes of Prong\n9 Two compliance, adding three new intercollegiate sports for women\n10 at once in the 1996-1997 school year should be given the same\n11 effect as if one sport were added in 1996-1997, another in 1999-\n12 2000, and a third in 2002-2003.  (TT 1848:17-1850:4.)  Grant\n13 opined that to hold otherwise would encourage institutions to\n14 withhold granting varsity status, except for within accepted\n15 intervals, in order to ensure Prong Two compliance; such\n16 withholding would deprive entire intercollegiate generations of\n17 the opportunity to compete in those subsequently added sports. \n18 While the court finds Grant’s logic persuasive, it fails to\n19 address the impact of the elimination of teams within the\n20 crediting period.  Moreover, the court finds it problematic to\n21 recognize a nine-year “credit” for the addition of three varsity\n22 teams, when the University cut two teams and over thirty actual\n23 participation opportunities within that same nine-year period.\n24 The court’s conclusion is in accordance with the examples\n25 provided in the 1996 Clarification.  First, UC Davis cannot\n26 compare itself to Institution C.  The 1996 Clarification provides\n27 that Institution C, a university that had seven teams in the\n28 1970s, would be compliant under Prong Two where it had added a\n112\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 113 of 147\n1 new varsity team in 1984, elevated a club team to varsity status\n2 in 1990, and implemented a plan to add a varsity team in 1996. \n3 However, while UC Davis elevated three club teams to varsity\n4 status in 1995 and declared indoor track & field as a separate\n5 varsity team in 1998, it also eliminated two women’s varsity “B\n6 teams.”  As such, the comparison to Institution C is inapt.43\n7 Second, UC Davis cannot find safe harbor in a comparison to\n8 Institution E.  The 1996 Clarification noted that an institution\n9 would be compliant, even if it eliminated a women’s varsity team\n10 that had eight members, where it elevated a club team consisting\n11 of twenty-five members to varsity status that same year.  In this\n12 case, UC Davis eliminated two “B teams,” with the net effect of\n13 losing approximately 30 actual participation opportunities.  No\n14 new participation opportunities immediately replaced them. \n15 Rather, it was not until 2005-2006 that UC Davis added women’s\n16 golf, which only resulted in 7 additional participation\n17 opportunities.  Accordingly, UC Davis is not akin to Institution\n18 E.\n19 Importantly, the court notes that the elimination of women’s\n20 participation opportunities on the men’s varsity wrestling team\n21 is irrelevant to the court’s conclusion that UC Davis did not\n22 have a continuing practice of program expansion.  Rather, the\n23 failure of plaintiffs to make the men’s varsity wrestling team is\n24 akin to normal, legitimate fluctuations of the numbers on any\n25 varsity squad based upon the talent, skill, and potential of the\n26\n27 43 Likewise, the 1996 Clarification example relating to\nInstitution F does not include any elimination of women’s teams\n28 or actual participation opportunities.\n113\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 114 of 147\n1 enrolled student-athletes.  To find otherwise would belie common\n2 sense and the practicalities of intercollegiate athletics.  For\n3 example, if a talented female athlete tried out for and made an\n4 intercollegiate men’s football team, EADA reports would reflect\n5 that female participation opportunity in varsity football.  Upon\n6 graduation, it is likely that the sole female participation\n7 opportunity in football would be eliminated.  To equate the\n8 elimination of a sole female participation opportunity on a men’s\n9 sport as the elimination of an entire women’s varsity sport not\n10 only runs counter to the purposes of Title IX, it also\n11 disincentivizes institutions from giving extraordinarily talented\n12 women the opportunity to compete in arenas traditionally occupied\n13 by men and in sports for which there are currently no viable\n14 female intercollegiate opportunities.44\n15 Finally, the court notes that the issues raised regarding UC\n16 Davis’ non-compliance with Title IX are difficult, particularly\n17 in light of the dearth of guidance in this area of the law. \n18 Universities should be encouraged to add as many athletic\n19 participation opportunities for women as soon as they can;\n20\n21 44 Further, to require an institution to maintain women’s\nparticipation opportunities on men’s intercollegiate teams\n22\nwithout imposing the same requirements on all participants would\nnot only impugn the integrity of intercollegiate athletics, but\n23\nwould also be based on an overbroad, generalized, and\ndiscriminatory assumption that women can never compete against\n24\nmen.  See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 642-43 (1975). \nSuch an assumption would be particularly damaging and demeaning\n25 in the context of Title IX, where statutory provisions already\ntake into account the physiological differences between men and\n26 women in the provision of separate teams.  See Frontiero v.\nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677, 684-87 (1973) (noting the dangers of\n27 gender discrimination “rationalized by an attitude of ‘romantic\npaternalism’ which, in practical effect, put women, not on a\n28 pedestal, but in a cage”).\n114\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 115 of 147\n1 application of rigid time tables should not encourage dalliance\n2 on the part of institutions in order to ensure compliance under\n3 clarifications that were meant to demonstrate the flexibility\n4 accorded institutions.  Further, universities should be\n5 encouraged to make decisions based upon the best interests of\n6 their student-athletes; if there is insufficient competition or\n7 opportunity at the collegiate level, universities should not\n8 sacrifice the experience of their students in order to facially\n9 comply with Title IX.  Moreover, the court acknowledges that\n10 large universities with a commitment to an expansive\n11 intercollegiate athletic program for both men and women may\n12 confront more difficulties with respect to the fluctuation in the\n13 number of participants in varsity athletics and the appropriate\n14 ratio between enrollment and athletic participation.\n15 However, the gravamen of Prong Two compliance is an ever-\n16 increasing number of actual participation opportunities for the\n17 underrepresented sex, in this case women.  When an institution\n18 loses over 60 such opportunities in two years and never fully\n19 regains all of those opportunities over the next four years, such\n20 an institution cannot be held to be Title IX compliant under\n21 Prong Two.\n22 D. Competitive Sports Provision\n23 Plaintiffs also assert that defendant UC Davis violated the\n24 separate teams/contact sports provision of Title IX’s\n25 implementing regulations and policy interpretations. \n26 Specifically, plaintiffs assert that because UC Davis provided\n27 wrestling opportunities for men, it was required to provide\n28 wrestling opportunities for women.\n115\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 116 of 147\n1 As set forth above, 34 C.F.R. § 106.41 provides that where\n2 an institution provides a team for one sex, but not for the\n3 underrepresented sex, “the excluded sex must be allowed to try-\n4 out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact\n5 sport,” such as wrestling.  The 1979 Policy Interpretation\n6 further explains that, for purposes of the regulation, effective\n7 accommodation requires that “if an institution sponsors a team\nmust\n8 for members of one sex in a contact sport, it   do so for\n9 members of the other sex” where (1) opportunities for members of\n10 the excluded sex have been historically limited; (2) there is\n11 sufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded\n12 sex to sustain a viable team; and (3) there is a reasonable\n13 expectation of intercollegiate competition for that team. \n14 (Emphasis added.) \n15 “Intercollegiate competition” means competitive\n16 opportunities among other collegiate student-athletes.  See Cohen\n17 v. Brown Univ. (“Cohen III”), 101 F.3d 155, 186 (1st Cir. 1996)\n18 (approving district court’s statement that ‘intercollegiate’\n19 teams are those that ‘regularly participate in varsity\n20 competition.’”).  Further, the 1979 Policy Interpretation\n21 expressly provides that “[i]nstitutions are not required to\n22 upgrade teams to intercollegiate status or otherwise develop\n23 intercollegiate sports absent a reasonable expectation that\n24 [such] intercollegiate competition in that sport will be\n25 available within the institution’s normal competitive regions.” \n26 (1997 Policy Interpretation at 28); see Roberts, 998 F.2d at 831. \n27 In this case, UC Davis was not required to provide a\n28 separate women’s wrestling team because the undisputed evidence\n116\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 117 of 147\n1 demonstrates that there was not a reasonable expectation of\n2 intercollegiate competition for such a team.45  Between 1995 and\n3 2001, no four-year California colleges had an all-women’s\n4 intercollegiate wrestling team.  In Fall 2001, there was one\n5 women’s wrestling team in California.  The only women’s club\n6 program at a four-year University was at California State\n7 University Bakersfield.  (See TT 1847:6-19 (noting the importance\n8 of available intercollegiate competition within a reasonable\n9 geographical area in order to provide the best competition to\n10 student-athletes at a reasonable cost to the institution).) \n11 Indeed, the Executive Director of the United States Girls’\n12 Wrestling Association testified that he knew of only four to six\n13 official intercollegiate women’s wrestling teams.46  Under these\n14 circumstances, UC Davis was not required to sponsor a separate\n15 women’s varsity wrestling program.  (see TT 1684:15-18 (noting\n16 that a competition season that consists of nothing but open\n17 matches would not be considered legitimate intercollegiate\n18 competition).)\n19\n45 The court also notes that there were also never more\n20\nthan four or five women at any one time who wanted to participate\nin wrestling during the time Burch was the head wrestling coach. \n21\nHowever, because the court concludes that there was not a\nreasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition, let alone\n22\nintercollegiate competition in UC Davis’ normal competitive\nregions, the court need not determine whether there was\n23 sufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded\nsex to sustain a viable team.\n24\n46 As noted, it is unclear whether any or all of these\n25 teams were in existence at the time plaintiffs were students, or\nmore specifically, when UC Davis implemented the “wrestle-off”\n26 policy in Fall 2001.  As this court has noted in numerous orders,\nplaintiffs never tried out for the men’s varsity wrestling team\n27 after Fall 2001; as such, it is unclear whether the same policy\nwould have applied.  Furthermore, such conduct is outside the\n28 relevant statute of limitations.\n117\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 118 of 147\n1 Further, even if the court broadened the scope of\n2 “intercollegiate competition” to include “open” tournaments,\n3 there was still not a reasonable expectation of competition. \n4 Burch identified a total of eight open tournaments, only four of\n5 which he identified as located in California.  Further, there was\n6 no evidence that there was sufficient competition for female\n7 intercollegiate wrestlers at these open tournaments.  For\n8 example, while an unofficial member of the men’s intercollegiate\n9 wrestling team, plaintiff Ng twice was unable to compete in UC\n10 Davis’ own tournament, the Aggie Open, because there were no\n11 competitors in her weight class.\n12 Accordingly, the court concludes that UC Davis did not\n13 violate Title IX by failing to sponsor a separate women’s\n14 intercollegiate wrestling team.47\n15\n47 The court acknowledges that once women wrestlers were\n16\nallowed to join the men’s intercollegiate wrestling team, neither\nthe contact sports exemption nor any other provision of Title IX\n17\nor its implementing regulations allowed UC Davis to discriminate\non the basis of sex.  Mercer v. Duke Univ., 401 F.3d 199, 202\n18\n(4th Cir. 2005.)\n19\nThe evidence is undisputed that prior to the imposition of\nthe roster cap in Fall 2000, Burch did not cut anyone who was\n20\nwilling to come to practices and attempt to compete.  (TT 143:21-\n23; 452:18-454:11; Collier Dep. at 60:23-61:4 (“[R]egardless of\n21\ngender, if people were willing to come out and compete and do\nwhat they could, [Burch] wanted to keep them on the team.  And\n22\nthat applies to males, too.  If there were guys that weren’t very\ngood wrestlers but they were at least trying to do what they\n23\ncould, he wanted to try and keep them if he could.”).\n24\nThe court concludes that Burch did not discriminate against\nplaintiffs on the basis of sex when he did not include them on\n25 the roster in Fall 2000.  Burch told Warzecka that the women were\nnot on the roster because they were not competitive against the\n26 men on the team.  As such, he cut them from the team as a result\nof their lack of competitive skill and potential, not because of\n27 their gender.  Further, to the extent that Burch did not give\nthem a sufficient opportunity to demonstrate skill, UC Davis\n28 reinstated them on the team and gave them such an opportunity the\n118\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 119 of 147\n1 E. Plaintiffs’ Miscellaneous Claims\n2 Finally, plaintiffs assert that defendants violated Title IX\n3 by failing to (1) take formal steps to continuously monitor the\n4 developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex;\n5 (2) have an adequate plan to expand women’s opportunities; and\n6 (3) effectively communicate or consistently follow a policy for\n7 adding or elevating teams.48  However, plaintiffs identify no\n8 bases in Title IX, its implementing regulations, or even its\n9 Policy Interpretations or Clarifications that impose such\n10 requirements.\n11 First, there is no requirement that an institution must take\n12 formal steps to continuously monitor the developing interests and\n13\n14\nnext year. \n15\nThe court also concludes that UC Davis did not discriminate\nagainst plaintiffs or women wrestlers on the basis of sex in\n16\nrequiring them to participate in “wrestle-offs” against men in\norder to make the team.  Not only were plaintiffs cut from the\n17\nteam, but other men who could not meet the skill requirement were\nalso cut.\n18\nAt bottom, plaintiffs were only allowed to participate on\n19\nthe team when Burch’s no-cut policy applied to everyone,\nincluding men and women.  When plaintiffs were required to\n20\ndemonstrate competitive skill and ability to compete on an\nintercollegiate men’s wrestling team, they, like some men, could\n21\nnot demonstrate the requisite skill.  Cf. Mercer, 401 F.3d at 202\n(allowing the plaintiff to proceed on her claim for gender\n22\ndiscrimination because she alleged that the football coach\nallowed other, less qualified walk-on male kickers to remain on\n23 the team).\n24 48 As has been a consistent practice in this litigation,\nmuch like their newly advanced Title IX claim based upon alleged\n25 violation of the separate teams/contact sports provisions,\nplaintiffs only advanced and argued these new theories in their\n26 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  For example,\nthere is no mention of any of these new theories of the case in\n27 their trial brief or at any time prior to the conclusion of the\ntrial.  However, for the sake of completeness, the court also\n28 addresses these claims.\n119\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 120 of 147\n1 abilities of the underrepresented sex in order to comply with\n2 Title IX.  Plaintiffs assert that “[t]he 1996 OCR Guidance states\n3 that schools should continuously monitor the developing interests\n4 and abilities of the underrepresented sex so that they can\n5 promptly respond to them as they develop by adding new sports.” \n6 (Pls.’ Proposed Conclusions of Law [Docket #625], filed July 19,\n7 2011.)  However, while the 1996 Clarification notes that it would\n8 find an institution’s efforts to monitor developing interests and\n9 abilities of the underrepresented sex persuasive in demonstrating\n10 compliance with Prong Two, it expressly notes that “institutions\n11 have flexibility in choosing a nondiscriminatory methods of\n12 determining athletic interests and abilities” and that “elaborate\n13 scientific validation of assessments” is not required.  (1996\n14 Clarification at 42, 44.)  Moreover, while the 1996 Clarification\nshould\n15 provides that an institution’s evaluation of interest “  be\nmust\n16 done periodically,” it does not state that an institution   do\n17 so in order to avoid violating Title IX.  (1996 Clarification at\n18 45.)  Accordingly, the court finds that any failure by UC Davis\n19 to formally monitor the developing interests and abilities of\n20 female athletes is not an independent violation of Title IX.49\n21 Second, plaintiffs similarly fail to identify any source of\n22 law that requires an institution to have a plan, let alone a\n23 specific type of plan, to expand women’s opportunities in order\n24 to comply with Title IX.  Plaintiffs point to the introductory\n25 letter to the 1996 Clarification to support their contention that\n26\n27 49 As set forth above, the court found that UC Davis\ninformally monitored undergraduate interest and abilities through\n28 analysis of participation in club sports and intramurals.\n120\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 121 of 147\n1 an adequate plan must include certain details and timetables;\n2 however, nothing in this letter discusses the requirement of a\n3 plan or what such a plan would need to include.  Rather, the 1996\n4 Clarification makes clear that compliance is measured by actual\n5 expansion; an institution cannot rely on mere promises or plans\n6 to expand.  (1996 Clarification at 42); see Favia, 812 F. Supp.\n7 at 585 (“You can’t replace programs with promises.”). \n8 Accordingly, the court finds that any failure by UC Davis to\n9 establish a particular type of plan is not an independent\n10 violation of Title IX.50\n11 Finally, the failure to effectively communicate or\n12 consistently follow a policy for adding or elevating teams is\n13 not, standing alone, a violation of Title IX.  The 1996\n14 Clarification provides that an institution’s implementation of\n15 nondiscriminatory policy or procedure for requesting the addition\n16 of sports and the effective communication of that policy is a\n17 factor, “among others,” that may be evidence of a continuing\n18 practice of program expansion.  (1996 Clarification at 42.) \n19 However, nothing in the 1996 Clarification lends support to\n20 plaintiffs’ contention that failure to do so is an independent\n21 basis for finding a violation of Title IX.\n22 The court notes that a formal monitoring system, a detailed\n23 plan for expanding women’s opportunities, and consistent, well-\n24 communicated policies for expanding teams are all laudable goals\n25 in accomplishing the purposes of Title IX.  However, none of them\n26 are required under the statute, regulations, or interpretations,\n27\n50 As set forth above, the court found that UC Davis\n28 generated a number of plans to achieve gender equity.\n121\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 122 of 147\n1 as currently written.  Furthermore, courts are not legislators. \n2 They are not Chancellors or Vice Chancellors of public\n3 universities.  While plaintiffs’ suggestions may more effectively\n4 or efficiently result in the equal provision of athletic\n5 opportunities, it is not within the province of the court to tell\n6 UC Davis how to achieve Title IX compliance, at least not in a\n7 case that seeks only declaratory relief and money damages. \n8 Rather, the court’s role is to determine whether a violation has\n9 taken place.  Because they have failed to demonstrate that there\n10 is any requirement in law for their suggested measures,\n11 plaintiffs are not entitled to any relief for the failure, if\n12 any, to follow such measures.51\n13 II. 42 U.S.C. § 1983: Equal Protection\n14 The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\n15 provides that no State shall “deny to any person within its\n16 jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const.\n17 Amdt. 14, § 1.  This is “essentially a direction that all\n18 similarly situated persons should be treated alike.”  City of\n19 Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  “The\n20 purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\n21 Amendment is to secure every person within the State’s\n22 jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination,\n23 whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its\n24 improper execution through duly constituted agents.”  Sioux City\n25\n26 51 Moreover, to the extent plaintiffs only sought to\nbolster their arguments regarding Prong Two compliance, the court\n27 declines to conclude that any of these alleged failures were\ndispositive of the court’s holding regarding defendants’ Title IX\n28 liability.\n122\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 123 of 147\n1 Bridge Co. v.

Cal. 2005)\n3 (noting that the Equal Protection clause “is not a source of\n4 substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free\n5 from discrimination in statutory classifications and other\n6 governmental activity”).  Accordingly, “[t]o establish a § 1983\n7 equal protection violation, the plaintiffs must show that the\n8 defendants, acting under color of state law, discriminated\n9 against them as members of an identifiable class and that the\n10 discrimination was intentional.”52  Flores v.

McCaffrey, 143 F.3d 473, 476 (9th\n14 Cir. 1998)).\n15 Where a University decides “to sponsor intercollegiate\n16 athletics as part of its educational offerings, this program\n17 ‘must be made available to all on equal terms.’”  Haffer v.\n18 Temple Univ., 678 F. Supp. 517, 525 (E.D. Pa. 1998) (quoting\n19 Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954)).  The Ninth\noverall\n20 Circuit has recognized that not only must “  athletic\n21 opportunities . . . be equal” to satisfy the Equal Protection\n22 Clause, but also that “denial of an opportunity in a specific\n23 sport, even when overall opportunities are equal, can be a\n24\n52 A party seeking to uphold a gender-based classification\n25 must demonstrate that the classification “serves important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means\n26 employed are substantially related to the achievement of those\nobjectives.”  Mississippi Univ. for Women v.

Moreover, the Ninth\n10 Circuit has expressly held that school officials “are liable for\n11 their own discriminatory actions in failing to remedy a known\n12 [discriminatory] environment.”  Oona R.S., 143 F.3d at 477\n13 (affirming the district court’s holding that individual\n14 defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity from the\n15 plaintiff’s peer sexual harassment claim based upon a known\n16 hostile environment).\n17 In this case, plaintiffs’ claims are based upon their\n18 contention that each individual defendant carried out a systemic\n19 policy of providing unequal athletic opportunities to female\n20 students at UC Davis.  The court held that claims arising from\n21 the “elimination” of women’s wrestling opportunities and the\n22 implementation of the “wrestle-off” policy were time-barred, but\n23 noted that defendants’ conduct with respect to these alleged\n24 events might be relevant to their state of mind.  However,\n25 plaintiffs’ evidence focused in disproportionately large part\n26 upon these events.  Accordingly, for the sake of completeness,\n27 the court addresses the matters herein where appropriate.\n28 /////\n127\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 128 of 147\n1 A. Pam Gill-Fisher\n2 Based upon the evidence submitted, the court concludes that\n3 defendant Gill-Fisher is not liable for alleged Equal Protection\n4 violations arising out of the alleged systemic policy of\n5 providing unequal athletic opportunities because she had no\n6 authority or control over the provision or elimination of\n7 athletic opportunities.  Accordingly, she cannot be found to have\n8 caused any deprivation to plaintiffs as a result of her action or\n9 inaction.\n10 The undisputed evidence submitted at trial establishes that\n11 Gill-Fisher’s duties at UC Davis did not include any authority to\n12 change the composition of the athletic participation\n13 opportunities offered to student-athletes.  Gill-Fisher’s duties\n14 included the supervision of eight sports, coordination of sports\n15 medicine, oversight of the Compliance Office regarding NCAA and\n16 UC Davis athletic eligibility, and oversight of academic\n17 advising.  While Gill-Fisher served as the Senior Woman\n18 Administrator, a position required by the NCAA, the position did\n19 not give Gill Fisher any additional authority or responsibility\n20 at UC Davis regarding Title IX or gender equity.  Gill-Fisher\n21 also participated on various evaluation and reporting committees\n22 regarding Title IX.  However, her participation in such\n23 committees did not grant her any authority to direct or change\n24 either athletic department policy or the actual composition of\n25 the UC Davis ICA program.\n26 Moreover, to the extent that Gill-Fisher was involved in\n27 discussions and recommendations regarding gender equity at UC\n28 Davis, the record is replete with evidence of her consistent,\n128\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 129 of 147\n1 enduring efforts to increase athletic participation opportunities\n2 for women, achieve equitable participation opportunities for\n3 women proportionate to enrollment, and ensure equal treatment in\n4 coaching, practice facilities, competition, and all resources\n5 available to varsity athletes.  Indeed, there is absolutely no\n6 credible evidence that Gill-Fisher ever ceased or even lightened\n7 her efforts to bring full gender equality to the intercollegiate\n8 athletic program at UC Davis.  Since the enactment of Title IX,\n9 Gill-Fisher consistently recommended that more women’s\n10 intercollegiate opportunities be offered, including\ninter alia\n11 recommendations, , that (1) gymnastics and badminton be\n12 added in 1972; (2) cross-country be added in 1978; (3) crew and\n13 golf be added in 1992; (4) water polo be added in 1993; and (5)\n14 more women’s intercollegiate athletic sports be added in 2003.\n15 Further, Gill-Fisher steadfastly maintained that UC Davis\n16 needed to achieve gender equity both through the consistent\n17 addition of women’s participation opportunities and the\n18 management of men’s participation opportunities.  In addition to\n19 her recommendations that UC Davis add more teams, Gill-Fisher\n20 alerted decision-makers to the problems in disproportionate\n21 athletic opportunities in reports and memos in 1972, 1978, 1989,\n22 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1996.  She also participated in\n23 subsequent gender equity reports, which noted the need to\n24 consistently evaluate whether the athletic participation\n25 opportunities available to men and women were proportional to\n26 their respective enrollment.  Even after UC Davis elevated three\n27 club teams to varsity status in 1995, Gill-Fisher informed the\n28 Athletic Director that the participation discrepancy was not\n129\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 130 of 147\n1 solved.  Further, Gill-Fisher advocated for roster management of\n2 men’s teams, particularly football, to aid in achieving gender\n3 proportionality since 1990. \n4 Gill-Fisher’s strong advocacy for gender equality and\n5 recommendations to decision-makers both directed attention to the\n6 issue and resulted in positive change.  However, the strength and\n7 effectiveness of her advocacy does not equate to authority or\n8 responsibility over the composition of the athletic program. \n9 Indeed, the court finds it ironic that, in effect, plaintiffs\n10 seek to hold Gill-Fisher liable for equal protection violations\nbecause\n11  she consistently, and at many times unsolicitedly,\n12 advocated for the need for more equality in the provision of\n13 women’s athletic participation opportunities and because such\n14 advocacy was often effective.\n15 Finally, the court concludes that Gill-Fisher’s interaction\n16 with plaintiffs and the other women wrestlers at UC Davis neither\n17 evinces hostile intent toward female athletes generally or female\n18 wrestlers specifically.  Gill-Fisher was supportive of female\n19 wrestlers; she even had Johnston speak to her classes regarding\n20 her experience as a female wrestler.  Gill-Fisher encouraged\n21 female wrestlers to develop women’s wrestling as a sport; she\n22 suggested that female wrestlers develop a club sport to establish\n23 an identity beyond individual female participants with unofficial\n24 status on the men’s team.  Gill-Fisher was not involved with any\n25 decision to remove plaintiffs from the wrestling team; those\n26 decisions rested firmly with both Burch and Zalesky.  Finally,\n27 although she had no role or responsibility in developing,\n28 approving, or supervising the procedure for try-outs, Gill-Fisher\n130\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 131 of 147\n1 was aware that plaintiffs were given an opportunity to try-out\n2 for the men’s intercollegiate wrestling team, using the standards\n3 that applied to all interested student wrestlers.  Based upon\n4 this evidence, the court cannot conclude that Gill-Fisher\n5 violated plaintiffs’ rights in relation to their opportunity to\n6 participate in women’s wrestling.\n7 Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs have failed\n8 to substantiate any claim that defendant Gill-Fisher violated the\n9 Equal Protection Clause through her actions or inaction.54\n10 B. Greg Warzecka\n11 Based upon the evidence submitted, the court also concludes\n12 that defendant Warzecka is not liable for alleged Equal\n13 Protection violations arising out of the alleged systemic policy\n14 of gender discrimination through the unequal provision of\n15 athletic opportunities55 because, to the extent plaintiffs could\n16\n17\n54 Alternatively, for the reasons set forth below,\n18\ndefendant Gill-Fisher would also be entitled to qualified\nimmunity.\n19\n55 In plaintiffs’ Proposed Conclusions of Law, they assert\n20\nthat defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause through (1)\ninequitably allocating varsity athletic participation\n21\nopportunities on the basis of sex; and (2) engaging in a\nsystematic discrimination against female students in the\n22\noperation of the varsity athletic program.  Plaintiffs do not\narticulate the difference between these two theories of\n23\nliability.  Moreover, the gravamen of both theories is that\ndefendants discriminated against female students on the basis of\n24\ngender in its allocation of athletic opportunities and failure to\npromote additional women’s club teams to varsity status. \n25 Accordingly, the court address both theories of liability on this\nbasis.\n26\nTo the extent that plaintiffs intend to claim some policy or\n27 practice of discrimination outside the allocation of athletic\nparticipation opportunities, there is no credible evidence to\n28 support such a claim.\n131\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 132 of 147\n1 prove such a violation, he is entitled to qualified immunity.56\n2 Similarly, the court concludes that defendant Warzecka is also\n3 entitled to qualified immunity for any Equal Protection\n4 violations arising out of (1) the failure to impose separate and\n5 distinct requirements for women student-athletes to qualify for\n6 the men’s varsity wrestling team; or (2) the failure to create a\n7 separate women’s varsity wrestling team.\n8 1. Qualified Immunity\n9 “Government officials who perform discretionary functions\n10 generally are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for\n11 civil damages ‘insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\n12 established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n13 reasonable person would have known.’”  Flores, 324 F.3d at 1134\n14 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).57\n15 “Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from\n16 money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that\n17 the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and\n18 (2) that the right was ‘clearly established’ at the time of the\n19 challenged conduct.”  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 131 S. Ct. 2074, 2080\n20\n21 56 The court also notes that the evidence is not wholly\nconclusive regarding Warzecka’s responsibility for any\n22\nconstitutional deprivation.  While Warzecka testified that he had\nsignificant involvement in decisions about adding or eliminating\n23 sports in the intercollegiate athletic program, he also testified\nthat these decisions were always made collaboratively.  Because\n24 the court concludes that Warzecka is entitled to qualified\nimmunity, it need not decide whether “significant involvement” is\n25 sufficient to confer liability under § 1983.\n26 57 Because qualified immunity is an affirmative defense,\ndefendants bear the burden of establishing they are entitled to\n27 it.  Provencio v. Vazquez, 258 F.R.D. 626, 633 (E.D.Cal. 2009) (\nciting Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1998);\n28 Benigni v. Hemet, 879 F.2d 473, 479 (9th Cir. 1988)).\n132\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 133 of 147\n1 (2011).  It is within the court’s “sound discretion” to address\n2 these two prongs in any sequence it deems appropriate.  Pearson\n3 v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). \n4 “For a constitutional right to be clearly established, its\n5 contours must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official\n6 would understand that what he is doing violates that right.” \n7 Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 739 (2002).  However, a court “need\n8 not find a prior case with identical, or even ‘materially\n9 similar,’ facts.”  Flores, 324 F.3d at 1136-37 (quoting Hope, 536\n10 U.S. 730).  Indeed, “officials can still be on notice that their\n11 conduct violates established law even in novel factual\n12 circumstances.”  Hope, 536 U.S. at 741.  Rather, a court must\n13 “determine whether the preexisting law provided the defendants\n14 with fair warning that their conduct was unlawful.”  Flores, 324\n15 F.3d at 1137 (internal quotations omitted) (noting that case law\n16 can render the law clearly established).  Specifically, the\n17 Supreme Court has held:\n18 For a constitutional right to be clearly established,\nits contours “must be sufficiently clear that a\n19 reasonable official would understand that what he is\ndoing violates that right. This is not to say that an\n20 official action is protected by qualified immunity\nunless the very action in question has previously been\n21 held unlawful; but it is to say that in the light of\npreexisting law the unlawfulness must be apparent.”\n22\n23 Hope, 536 U.S. at 739 (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S.\n24 635, 640 (1987)); see al-Kidd, 580 F.3d at 971 (noting that\n25 “dicta, if sufficiently clear, can suffice to clearly establish a\n26 constitutional right.”) (internal quotation omitted)).  “[T]he\n27 proper fact-specific inquiry . . . is not whether the law is\n28 settled, but whether, in light of clearly established law and the\n133\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 134 of 147\n1 information available to him, a reasonable person in\n2 [defendant’s] position could have objectively believed his\n3 actions to be proper.”  Floyd v. Laws, 929 F.2d 1390, 1394 (9th\n4 Cir. 1991) (citing Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641).\n5 2. Equal Athletic Participation Opportunities for\nWomen\n6\n7 At the time of the alleged discriminatory conduct in this\n8 case, the law, as set forth by the United States Supreme Court\n9 and the Ninth Circuit, was clear that the Equal Protection Clause\n10 of the Fourteenth Amendment creates the right to be free from\n11 purposeful discrimination in education by state actors. \n12 Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.S. at 731; Oona, R.S., 143\n13 F.3d at 476 (holding that it was clearly established well prior\n14 to 1988 that the Equal Protection clause proscribed any\n15 purposeful discrimination by state actors on the basis of\n16 gender).  More specifically, as early as 1982, the Ninth Circuit\n17 recognized that the Equal Protection Clause may be violated when\n18 overall athletic opportunities are unequal as well as when there\n19 is inequality in opportunity in a given sport.  Clark, 695 F.2d\n20 at 1130-31 (acknowledging the Equal Protection right, but holding\n21 that the discrimination in favor of an all girls volleyball team\n22 was substantially related to an important governmental interest).\n23 However, during the entirety of the time that plaintiffs\n24 were students at UC Davis, there was no clearly established law\n25 regarding how inequality in athletic participation is measured\n26 for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.  Only a single\n27 district court held that there were triable issues of fact\n28 regarding whether a university violated the Equal Protection\n134\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 135 of 147\n1 Clause, when its enrollment was comprised of 50% women, but only\n2 33% of its athletic participants were women.  Haffer, 678 F.\n3 Supp. at 525-27.\n4 Moreover, there was no clearly established law regarding how\n5 the Title IX framework does or does not impact a claim for\n6 unequal treatment under the Equal Protection Clause.  Indeed,\n7 until the Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in Fitzgerald v.\n8 Barnstable, 555 U.S. 246 (2009), the Circuits were split\n9 regarding whether Title IX was meant to be the exclusive\n10 mechanism for addressing gender discrimination in schools. \n11 Further, in some instances, courts held that compliance with\n12 Title IX did not equate to compliance with the Equal Protection\n13 Clause.  See Lantz, 620 F. Supp. at 665-66 (noting that Title IX\n14 was neutral regarding mixed competition in contact sports, but\n15 holding that the Equal Protection clause required giving the\n16 female plaintiff an opportunity to try out); Force, 570 F. Supp.\n17 at 1024-25, 1031 (same).  However, in holding that an\n18 institution’s decision to eliminate men’s, but not women’s,\n19 swimming did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the Seventh\n20 Circuit has noted that “insofar as the University actions were\n21 taken in an attempt to comply with the requirements of Title IX,\n22 plaintiffs’ attack on those actions is merely a collateral attack\n23 on the statute and regulations and is therefore impermissible.” \n24 Kelley v. Bd. of Trs., 35 F.3d 265, 272 (7th Cir. 1994).\n25 At bottom, the parties have failed to point to, and the\n26 court cannot find, any cases that are akin to the one at bar. \n27 Specifically, there is no case law that teaches that compliance\n28 with Prong Two exculpates defendants from liability for Equal\n135\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 136 of 147\n1 Protection violations.  Conversely, there is no case law that\n2 teaches that institutions must meet substantial proportionality,\n3 as defined by Title IX’s regulations or interpretations, to\n4 comply with the Equal Protection Clause.  There is also no case\n5 law regarding when an individual actor becomes liable for the\n6 unequal provision of athletic opportunities in an athletic\n7 program that serves a university with an enrollment of between\n8 approximately 18,000 to 21,00058 students; it is unclear whether\n9 a school official becomes liable for that disparity the moment he\n10 or she is hired, a year later, or five years later.  It is under\n11 this patent ambiguity that we address the applicability of\n12 qualified immunity to plaintiffs’ almost wholly unique claims for\n13 the alleged systemic, unequal provision of athletic opportunities\n14 for women at UC Davis. \n15 In this case, it is undisputed that, at all relevant times,\n16 defendant Warzecka believed the UC Davis intercollegiate\n17 wrestling program was Title IX compliant under Prong Two.  His\n18 belief was not patently, nor even arguably, unreasonable under\n19 the circumstances.  As demonstrated at trial, even a reknowned\n20 expert in Title IX, who has spent her career testifying on behalf\n21 of female student-athletes, believed that UC Davis was compliant\n22 under Prong Two.  There was no case law that put defendant on\n23 clear notice that UC Davis was not in compliance with Prong Two. \n24 Indeed, as set forth above, the court finds that the issues\n25 relating to UC Davis’ compliance are difficult.  Therefore,\n26 because (1) there was (and is) no clearly established law\n27\n28 58 The court discerns these numbers from the EADA reports.\n136\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 137 of 147\n1 regarding whether Title IX compliance establishes compliance with\n2 the Equal Protection Clause; (2) defendant Warzecka had an\n3 objectively and subjectively reasonable belief that UC Davis was\n4 compliant with Title IX’s effective accommodation provision under\n5 Prong Two; and (3) a reasonable person could conclude that\n6 compliance with the effective accommodation requirements of Title\n7 IX satisfied the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause,\n8 defendant Warzecka is entitled to qualified immunity.\n9 Moreover, while a reasonable school official might have been\n10 on notice that substantial proportionality may not necessarily be\n11 achieved with a 5 percent disparity between enrollment and\n12 athletic participation, a reasonable official was not on notice\n13 that such a disparity would violate the Equal Protection Clause. \n14 When defendant became Athletic Director in 1995, women’s actual\n15 participation opportunities were at 211 and there was a 20\n16 percent disparity between the female enrollment and the female\n17 participation in intercollegiate athletics.  The next year the\n18 disparity had decreased to 11 percent and the actual\n19 participation opportunities had risen to 348.  In 1998-1999, when\n20 the first plaintiff entered the University, UC Davis had its\n21 highest number of female participation opportunities, 426, and\n22 the disparity had decreased to 6 percent.  While the following\n23 three years fluctuated between 7 percent, 9 percent, and back to\n24 7 percent, in plaintiff Mansourian and Mancuso’s final years at\n25 Davis, the disparity had decreased to 6 percent and 5 percent,\n26 respectively.  Because there was (and is) no statutory,\n27 regulatory, or common law that defines the measure of “comparable\n28 equality” for purposes of Equal Protection, the court cannot find\n137\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 138 of 147\n1 that a reasonable person in defendant Warzecka’s position would\n2 not think his efforts to narrow the gender proportion disparity\n3 to 5 percent were proper.\n4 Accordingly, the court concludes that defendant Warzecka is\n5 entitled to qualified immunity for plaintiffs’ claim arising out\n6 of any alleged systemic policy of providing unequal athletic\n7 opportunities to female student-athletes.59\n8 3. Separate Requirements for Try-Outs or Provision of\na Separate Women’s Wrestling Team\n9\n10 At the time of the alleged discriminatory conduct in this\n11 case, the law, as set forth by the few federal courts and state\n12 courts to address this issue, provided that the Equal Protection\n13 Clause required that women athletes be given the opportunity to\n14 try out for a men’s team if there was not a comparable women’s\n15 team.  Force, 570 F. Supp. at 1031; Lantz, 620 F. Supp. at 665;\n16 Hoover, 430 F. Supp. at 171; see Israel, 182 W. Va. at 459-60. \n17 However, all of these cases emphasized that there was no\n18 constitutional or statutory right to make the team.  Id.; see\n19 Croteau, 686 F. Supp. at 554.  Moreover, each of these cases\n20 expressly noted that the right to compete must be on equal terms\n21 as the other student-athletes, and the decision on whether a\n22\n23 59 Further, to the extent plaintiffs assert claims based\nupon the failure to (1) create gender equity plans with\n24\ntimetables and detailed plans; or (2) formally assess the\nathletic interests of current and prospective students,\n25 defendants are clearly entitled to qualified immunity. \nPlaintiffs cite, and the court cannot find, any authority that\n26 would put an official on any type of notice that such failures\nwould constitute an Equal Protection Clause violation.  Moreover,\n27 the court notes that plaintiffs provide absolutely no authority\nto support their contention that these failures equate to the\n28 denial of “equal protection of the law.” \n138\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 139 of 147\n1 female makes or plays on a team “must be governed solely by her\n2 abilities, as judged by those who coach her.”  Force, 570 F.\n3 Supp. at 1031; Lantz, 620 F. Supp. at 665; see Croteau, 686 F.\n4 Supp. at 554; Hoover, 430 F. Supp. at 171; see Israel, 182 W. Va.\n5 at 459-60; see also Brenden, 477 F.2d at 1302 (8th Cir. 1973).\n6 With respect to women athletes’ opportunity to participate\n7 on men’s wrestling team, one of the three district court cases to\n8 address the issue noted that “it is far from clear that the\n9 refusal to sanction a mixed-gender contact sport violates the\n10 Fourteenth Amendment.”  Barnett v. Texas Wrestling Ass’n, 16 F.\n11 Supp. 2d 690, 695-96 (N.D. Tex. 1998) (noting that the defendants\n12 failed to raise the issue on summary judgment).  However, both of\n13 the other district courts to address the issue have held that a\n14 female athlete should be allowed to try out for the male wresting\n15 team.  Saint v. Nebraska Sch. Activities Ass’n, 684 F. Supp. 626\n16 (D. Neb. 1988); ; see also Adams v. Baker, 919 F. Supp. 1496,\n17 1503 (D. Kan. 1996).  In Saint, the plaintiff was a sophomore in\n18 high school who requested permission to participate on the boys’\n19 high school wrestling team.  However, according to league rules,\n20 girls were not permitted to participate on the boys’ team.  Id.\n21 at 627.  The league asserted that the regulation should be upheld\n22 because it sought to protect “the health and safety of the female\n23 athletes.”  Id. at 628.  The league presented expert testimony\n24 that school-age females are generally at a competitive\n25 disadvantage in co-ed contact sports because (1) “they have a\n26 smaller total body mass with less of the total mass being muscle\n27 and more being fat tissue”; (2) “female strength levels are less\n28 than that for males”; (3) “female speed capabilities are not\n139\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 140 of 147\n1 comparable to the male”; and (4) “female muscle power output is\n2 considerably less than [that] of males.”  Id. at 629.  The expert\n3 concluded that these differentials are “sufficiently great enough\n4 to create a significant competitive disadvantage for the female\n5 and raise her potential for injury to a high level.”  Id.\n6 The court noted that such expert testimony “contains nothing\n7 more than generalized statements applicable to typical school-age\n8 females in the population at large” and that plaintiff had\n9 already shown that she was physically capable to join the team. \n10 The court reasoned that “any boy may join the wrestling team,\n11 regardless of his body size, strength level, speed capability,\n12 muscle power output or any other factor which might have a\n13 bearing on his potential for injury,” and that “such a\n14 paternalistic gender-based classification,” which resulted from\n15 “ascribing a particular trait or quality to one sex, when not all\n16 share that trait or quality, [was] not only inherently unfair,\n17 but generally tends only to perpetuate ‘stereotypical notions’\n18 regarding the proper roles of men and women.”  Id. (quotations\n19 ommitted).  Accordingly, the court held that plaintiff had shown\n20 a high probability of success on the merits and issued a\n21 temporary restraining order preventing the league from refusing\n22 to permit the plaintiff to wrestle on the boys’ wrestling team. \n23 Id.\n24 In this case, as an initial matter, there is no credible\n25 evidence that defendant Warzecka had a discriminatory animus\n26 towards or was hostile to female wrestlers.  To the contrary, as\n27 set forth above, the court found that Warzecka was willing to\n28 make special exceptions regarding club sport requirements,\n140\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 141 of 147\n1 training room access, and varsity weight room access to better\n2 enable women wrestlers, including plaintiffs, to participate in\n3 wrestling after Burch cut them from the men’s team.\n4 Second, to the extent that such conduct constitutes an Equal\n5 Protection Clause violation, defendant was not on notice that\n6 requiring women student-athletes to compete for a position on a\n7 men’s intercollegiate team against men student-athletes using the\n8 same standard set of rules and criteria was a constitutional\n9 violation.  Rather, as set forth above, the consistent holding of\n10 the body of law in this area is that women should be entitled to\ncompete under equal terms\n11 a right to   for a spot on a men’s team  .\n12 In fact, the reasoning behind these decisions would counsel\n13 against utilizing separate criteria for different genders.  By\n14 implicitly stating that no woman could ever successfully compete\n15 against a man, Warzecka and UC Davis would potentially be\n16 “ascribing a particular trait or quality to one sex, when not all\n17 share that trait or quality”; “such a paternalistic gender-based\n18 classification” could serve to perpetuate ‘stereotypical notions’\n19 regarding the proper roles of men and women” as student-athletes,\n20 generally, and as wrestlers, specifically.  See Saint, 684 F.\n21 Supp. at 629.  Moreover, plaintiffs fail to cite to, and the\n22 court cannot find, any case that required an institution to apply\n23 different standards to women that wished to participate on a\n24 men’s team.  Accordingly, under the state of the law at the time\n25 plaintiffs were students, defendant Warzecka did not violate a\n26 clearly established right by requiring female wrestlers to\n27 compete against male wrestlers under the same conditions; rather,\n28 “a reasonable person in [his] position could have objectively\n141\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 142 of 147\n1 believed his actions to be proper.”  Houghton v. South, 965 F.2d\n2 1532, 1534 (9th Cir. 1992) (quotations and citations omitted).\n3 Finally, defendant was not on notice that failure to sponsor\n4 a separate women’s wrestling team was a constitutional violation. \n5 Again, plaintiffs fail to cite to, and the court cannot find, any\n6 case that required an institution to provide a separate women’s\n7 team to comply with the Equal Protection Clause.  Cf. Hoover, 430\n8 F. Supp. at 172 (noting that the defendants may comply with the\n9 Equal Protection Clause by (1) fielding separate teams for males\n10 and females; (2) discontinuing the sport as an interscholastic\n11 activity; or (3) permitting both sexes to compete on the same\n12 team).\n13 Therefore, the court concludes that defendant Warzecka is\n14 entitled to qualified immunity for plaintiffs’ claims arising out\n15 of any alleged failure to create separate standards for\n16 competition or separate varsity opportunities for women\n17 wrestlers.\n18 C. Robert Franks\n19 For the reasons set forth above, the court likewise\n20 concludes that defendant Franks is not liable for alleged Equal\n21 Protection violations arising out of (1) the alleged systemic\n22 policy of gender discrimination through the unequal provision of\n23 athletic opportunities; (2) the failure to impose separate and\n24 distinct requirements for women student-athletes to qualify for\n25 the men’s varsity wrestling team; or (3) the failure to create a\n26 separate women’s varsity wrestling team.  To the extent\n27\n28\n142\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 143 of 147\n1 plaintiffs could prove any such violations, he is entitled to\n2 qualified immunity.60\n3 With respect to plaintiffs’ claims for systemic violations,\n4 Franks, like Warzecka, consistently and reasonably believed that\n5 UC Davis was complying with its gender equity requirements under\n6 Title IX.  Further, like Warzecka, Franks saw increasingly\n7 smaller proportional disparities between the number of female\n8 enrollment and the number of female athletic participation\n9 opportunities.  Under the ambiguous state of the law in this area\n10 at the time plaintiffs were students, the court concludes that\n11 defendant Franks is entitled to qualified immunity for\n12 plaintiffs’ claim arising out of any alleged systemic policy of\n13 providing unequal athletic opportunities to female student-\n14 athletes.\n15 With respect to plaintiffs’ claims arising from women’s\n16 wrestling opportunities, there is no credible evidence that\n17 defendant Franks had a discriminatory animus towards or was\n18 hostile to female wrestlers.  To the contrary, as set forth\n19 above, the court found that Franks immediately reinstated\n20 plaintiffs on the wrestling team once the complaint was filed\n21 with OCR.  He met with plaintiffs, investigated their requests,\n22\n23 60 The court also notes that the evidence is not wholly\nconclusive regarding Frank’s responsibility for any\n24\nconstitutional deprivation.  While Franks testified that the\nintercollegiate athletic program and Athletic Director reported\n25 directly to him, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs\ntestified that any problems under her province, including the\n26 intercollegiate athletic program, was ultimately her\nresponsibility.  Because the court concludes that Franks is\n27 entitled to qualified immunity, it need not decide whether\nFrank’s level of responsibility is sufficient to confer liability\n28 under § 1983.\n143\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 144 of 147\n1 and ultimately relayed the administration’s agreement to waive\n2 the number of students required to form a women’s wrestling club\n3 and to allow the club to practice at the same time as the\n4 intercollegiate team.  Franks was aware that in Fall 2001,\n5 Zalesky intended to select team members based on the skills they\n6 demonstrated, and believed such a process was fair to all\n7 student-athletes trying out for a place on the men’s wrestling\n8 team.  For the same reasons set forth in the court’s discussion\n9 of defendant Warzecka’s liability, the court concludes that\n10 defendant Franks is entitled to qualified immunity because he did\n11 not violate a clearly established right by requiring female\n12 wrestlers to compete against male wrestlers under the same\n13 conditions in order to make the varsity squad or by failing to\n14 create a separate women’s team. \n15 D. Larry Vanderhoef\n16 Finally, the court similarly concludes that defendant\n17 Vanderhoef is entitled to qualified immunity for any alleged\n18 Equal Protection violations arising out of (1) the alleged\n19 systemic policy of gender discrimination through the unequal\n20 provision of athletic opportunities; (2) the failure to impose\n21 separate and distinct requirements for women student-athletes to\n22 qualify for the men’s varsity wrestling team; or (3) the failure\n23 to create a separate women’s varsity wrestling team.  Vanderhoef\n24 was informed and, like Warzecka and Franks, reasonably believed\n25 that UC Davis was Title IX compliant at all relevant times. \n26 Vanderhoef was further informed, and reasonably believed, that\n27 the situation involving the women’s wrestlers had been\n28 appropriately resolved.  Under the law in existence at the time\n144\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 145 of 147\n1 students were plaintiffs, Vanderhoef’s actions or inaction did\n2 not violate a clearly established constitutional right. \n3 Accordingly, he is not liable for any alleged Equal Protection\n4 Clause violations.\n5 III. Damages\n6 Because, as set forth above, defendant UC Davis failed to\n7 demonstrate a continuing practice of program expansion,\n8 plaintiffs are entitled to damages for the actual harm they\n9 suffered as female students at UC Davis who were interested in\n10 participating in intercollegiate athletics.  However, because\n11 plaintiffs could not demonstrate that defendant Gill-Fisher\n12 caused any constitutional deprivation and because all individual\n13 defendants are entitled to qualified immunity for any alleged\n14 constitutional violations, plaintiffs are not entitled to\n15 punitive damages.  As this stage of the litigation dealt with\n16 liability and as the parties have not fully briefed all issues\n17 relating to damages, the court makes no further rulings regarding\n18 potential limitations on the measure of damages in this case.\n19 The court notes, though, that it finds the evolution and\n20 potential impacts of this case troubling.  It has been clear to\n21 the court throughout the arduous eight years of litigation that,\n22 for plaintiffs, this case has always been about wrestling.  Based\n23 upon (1) blatant misrepresentations by a person plaintiffs\n24 trusted, who manipulated such trust for personal motives wholly\n25 unrelated to gender equity; (2) subsequent misinterpretations by\n26 plaintiffs of the conduct of UC Davis athletic administrators,\n27 who undoubtedly had the best interest of all their students at\n28 heart; and (3) interference and advocacy by media and public\n145\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 146 of 147\n1 figures, who were unaware of all the facts, plaintiffs believed\n2 that they had been wronged.  Almost four years ago, the court\n3 held, however, that plaintiffs claims arising out of any alleged\n4 elimination of wrestling and implementation of the “wrestle-off”\n5 policy were time-barred.  Based upon a very liberal reading of\n6 the complaint and arguments advanced only in oral argument on\n7 defendants’ motion, the court found that plaintiffs had a viable\n8 claim relating to the entire athletic program’s provision of\n9 athletic opportunities to women, a claim that these plaintiffs\n10 had never previously advanced.\n11 Moreover, the subsequent litigation and bench trial\n12 demonstrated that, for plaintiffs, this case was still about\n13 wrestling.  Indeed, this claim ceased even putatively being about\n14 corrective action for the entirety of UC Davis female students\n15 four years ago, when the class claims were dismissed and\n16 plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue injunctive relief.  Rather,\n17 such relief was accorded through a class action settlement, the\n18 stipulated Judgement and Order for which was entered on October\n19 20, 2009.  (See Brust v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., No. 2:07-\n20 cv-1488, [Docket #121].) \n21 Finally, the evidence at trial bore out that while UC Davis\n22 failed to comply with Title IX during the time that plaintiffs\n23 were students at UC Davis, plaintiffs’ complaints about\n24 defendants’ conduct relating to wrestling were meritless.  This\n25 troubling juxtaposition of the court’s conclusions would seem to\n26 place severe limitations on the damages these plaintiffs may\n27 recover.  However, the court leaves any such limitations for\n28\n146\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD -EFB   Document 628    Filed 08/03/11   Page 147 of 147\n1 further argument on the motions in limine to precede the damages\n2 phase of trial and any such determinations to they jury.\n3 CONCLUSION\n4 For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs have prevailed on\n5 their claims against UC Davis for ineffective accommodation of\n6 female student-athletes under Title IX based upon UC Davis’\n7 failure to demonstrate a continuing practice of program\n8 expansion.  However, plaintiffs have not prevailed on any other\n9 theories of Title IX liability.  Moreover, plaintiffs have not\n10 prevailed on their claims for Equal Protection Clause violations\n11 against any of the individual defendants.  As such, defendants\n12 Larry Vanderhoef, Greg Warzecka, Pam Gill-Fisher, and Robert\n13 Franks are DISMISSED.\n14 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n15 DATED: August 3, 2011 \n16\nFRANK C.

Although they addressed this\n26 standard in their reply, plaintiffs assert that the 2nd Amended\nPretrial Scheduling Order (“PSO”) does not require compliance\n27 with Rule 16.  Plaintiffs are mistaken.  The prior Pretrial\nScheduling Order in this case provided that “[N]o further joinder\n28 of parties or amendments to pleadings is permitted without leave\n1\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 2 of 12\n1 Rule 15 to add new plaintiffs and allegations.  Defendants oppose\n2 the motion.  For the reasons set forth below,2 plaintiffs’ motion\n3 is DENIED.\n4 BACKGROUND\n5 This action was filed on December 18, 2003, alleging that\n6 defendants violated Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972,\n7 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., the Equal Protection Clause of the\n8 Fourteenth Amendment, and various state statutes “by eliminating\n9 female athletic participation and scholarship opportunities in\n10 wrestling” and that “[d]efendants continue to violate these civil\n11 rights by refusing to reinstate the women’s wrestling program and\n12 by failing to provide equitable athletic participation and\n13 scholarship opportunities for women.”  (Pls.’ Compl., filed Dec.\n14 18, 2003, at 2).  Two of the plaintiffs, Arezou Mansourian and\n15 Lauren Mancuso, brought the action on behalf of themselves and\n16 “as class representatives on behalf of all those similarly\n17 situated, including all present and future female students at UC-\n18 Davis who are denied equal athletic participation opportunities\n19\n20\n21\nof court, good cause having been shown.”  (Docket #28 (citing\nFed. R. Civ. P. 16 (b); Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975\n22\nF.2d 604 (9th Cir. 1992)).  The 2nd Amended PSO notes plaintiff’s\nrequest for leave to amend and defendant’s objection to that\n23 request.  The court set out a briefing schedule for plaintiffs\n“to bring the appropriate motions,” noting explicitly that\n24 “Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend the Complaint and/or Motion to Amend\nthe Pretrial Scheduling Order” was to be submitted on or before\n25 February 2, 2007.  (Docket #156) (emphasis added).  However, the\ncourt will consider the arguments relating to Rule 16 set forth\n26 in plaintiffs’ reply.     \n27 2 Because oral argument will not be of material\nassistance, the court orders this matter submitted on the briefs. \n28 E.D. Cal. L.R. 78-230(h).\n2\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 3 of 12\n1 and scholarships, especially in wrestling, by Defendants’\n2 discriminatory actions.”  (Id. at 3). \n3 The litigation in this case, albeit extended, has been\n4 thorough.  In March 2004, defendants filed a motion to dismiss,\n5 which was denied.  (See Mem. & Order, Docket #25, filed May 6,\n6 2004).  In December 2005, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify\n7 the class and noticed the matter for hearing in February 2006. \n8 (See Docket #62-70).  Between December 2005 and April 2006, the\n9 docket reflects that the parties engaged in discovery, and\n10 various discovery disputes were filed before the magistrate\n11 judge.  Subsequently, plaintiffs amended their notice of hearing\n12 for the class certification motion to change the hearing date to\n13 April 21, 2006.  (2d Amended Notice of Hearing, Docket #93, filed\n14 Feb. 21, 2006).  On April 4, 2004, defendants filed a lengthy\n15 opposition to plaintiffs’ motion for class certification,\n16 accompanied by voluminous attachments, exhibits, and objections. \n17 (See Docket # 103-07, 121).  Further, the docket reflects that\n18 defendants were preparing to file a motion for summary judgment.3 \n19 (See Docket # 97-102; 108-110 (relating to defendants’ ex parte\n20 motion to extend page limits for motions for summary judgment)).\n21 Unfortunately, throughout the course of this litigation,\n22 both defendants’ and plaintiffs’ counsel have suffered illnesses. \n23 In October 2005, both parties stipulated to an extension of\n24 deadlines due to defendants’ lead counsel’s diagnosis with breast\n25 cancer, which would make her unavailable to travel to depositions\n26 over the following two months.  (Stipulation, Docket #57, filed\n27\n3 At this stage in the litigation, the dispositive motion\n28 deadline was August 4, 2006.\n3\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 4 of 12\n1 Oct. 28, 2005).  On April 14, 2006, one week before plaintiffs’\n2 motion for class certification was to be heard by the court,\n3 plaintiffs’ counsel filed an ex parte motion to stay and extend\n4 scheduling based upon plaintiffs’ counsel’s serious health\n5 issues.  (Ex Parte Mot. to Stay, Docket #117, filed Apr. 14,\n6 2006).  Defendants opposed the motion.  The court granted\n7 plaintiffs’ motion and set a status conference for June 16, 2006. \n8 (Order, Docket #125, filed Apr. 18, 2006).  On June 6, 2006, the\n9 parties stipulated to extend the stay and related scheduling\n10 matters.  (Stipulation to Extend Stay and Related Scheduling\n11 Matters, Docket #130, filed June 6, 2006).  On July 21, 2006,\n12 plaintiffs moved to extend the stay in order to find new counsel\n13 because of plaintiffs’ counsel’s serious medical condition.  \n14 (Motion to Extend, Docket #134, filed July 21, 2006).  The court\n15 granted the extension, directed plaintiffs’ counsel to file\n16 either a motion to withdraw or substitution of counsel by August\n17 18, 2006, and set a status conference for September 8, 2006. \n18 (Order, Docket # 137, filed July 24, 2006).  On August 18, 2006,\n19 Monique Oliver filed a notice of appearance on behalf of\n20 plaintiffs.  (Docket # 140, filed Aug. 18, 2006).  On August 23,\n21 2006, and October 19, 2006, the parties stipulated to extend the\n22 stay, based upon the appearance of new counsel in this matter. \n23 (Docket #141, 147).  \n24 Finally, on January 19, 2007, the parties submitted a joint\n25 status report.  (Docket # 154).  The parties raised issues\n26 relating to plaintiffs’ desire to amend the complaint, further\n27 discovery, and scheduling.  On January 24, 2006, the court issued\n28 a 2nd Amended Pretrial Scheduling Order, setting forth the\n4\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 5 of 12\n1 schedule by which the parties were to file the current motions. \n2 (2d Am. Pretrial Scheduling Order, Docket # 156, filed Jan. 24,\n3 2006).      \n4 STANDARD\n5 Once the court has entered a pretrial scheduling order\n6 pursuant to Rule 16, the standards of Rule 16 rather than Rule 15\n7 govern amendment of the pleadings.  See Johnson v. Mammoth\n8 Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d 604, 607-08 (9th Cir. 1992); Eckert\n9 Cold Storage, Inc. v. Behl, 943 F. Supp. 1230, 1232-33 (E.D. Cal.\n10 1996).4  Orders entered before the final pretrial conference may\n11 be modified only “upon a showing of good cause.”  Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12 16(b).  \n13 The good cause requirement of Rule 16 primarily considers\n14 the diligence of the party seeking the amendment.  The pretrial\n15 scheduling order can only be modified “if it cannot reasonably be\n16 met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.”   \n17 Mammoth Recreations, 975 F.2d at 609.  When evaluating whether a\n18 party was diligent, the Ninth Circuit has determined that “the\n19 focus of the inquiry is upon the moving party’s reasons for\n20 modification.  If that party was not diligent, the inquiry should\n21 end.”  Id. at 610; see also Gestetner, 108 F.R.D. at 141.  \n22\n23 4 To rely solely on Rule 15 after a pretrial scheduling\norder has been entered would “render scheduling orders\n24\nmeaningless and effectively would read Rule 16(b) and its good\ncause requirement out of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.” \n25 Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., 133 F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir.\n1998); see also Mammoth Recreations, 975 F.2d at 610 (adopting\n26 Rule 15's standards for amending the complaint would “undermine\nthe court’s ability to control its docket, disrupt the agreed-\n27 upon course of the litigation, and reward the indolent and the\ncavalier”); Eckert Cold Storage, 943 F. Supp. at 1232 n.3.\n28\n5\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 6 of 12\n1 When the proposed modification is an amendment to the\n2 pleadings, the moving party may establish good cause by showing\n3 “(1) that [he or she] was diligent in assisting the court in\n4 creating a workable Rule 16 order; (2) that [his or her]\n5 noncompliance with a rule 16 deadline occurred or will occur,\n6 notwithstanding [his or her] diligent efforts to comply, because\n7 of the development of matters which could not have been\n8 reasonably foreseen or anticipated at the time of the Rule 16\n9 scheduling conference; and (3) that [he or she] was diligent in\n10 seeking amendment of the Rule 16 order, once it became apparent\n11 that [he or she] could not comply with the order.”  Jackson v.\n12 Laureate, Inc., 186 F.R.D. 605, 608 (E.D. Cal. 1999)(citations\n13 omitted). \n14 Only after the moving party has demonstrated diligence under\n15 Rule 16 does the court apply the standard under Rule 15 to\n16 determine whether the amendment was proper.  See Mammoth\n17 Recreations, 975 F.2d at 608; Eckert Cold Storage, 943 F. Supp.\n18 at 1232 n.3.  Pursuant to Rule 15(a), “leave [to amend] is to be\n19 freely given when justice so requires.”  “[L]eave to amend should\n20 be granted unless amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing\n21 party, is sought in bad faith, is futile, or creates undue\n22 delay.”  Martinez v. Newport Beach, 125 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.\n23 1997). \n24 ANALYSIS\n25 Plaintiffs seek to add new plaintiffs, who will also be\n26 class representatives, and related allegations.  Plaintiffs\n27 assert that the three new plaintiffs and related allegations\n28 “more fully reflect the experiences of current women student\n6\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 7 of 12\n1 athletes at UC Davis” and will “clarify certain allegations in\n2 light of the scope of the relief sought, and the continuing\n3 nature of the alleged violations.”  (Pls.’ Mot. to Amend, filed\n4 Feb. 2, 2007, at 1 (“Mot. to Amend”)).  The proposed plaintiffs\n5 are current UC Davis students, who are interested in varsity\n6 opportunities in wrestling, rugby, and field hockey.  (Pl.’s\n7 Proposed 1st. Am. Complaint, filed Feb. 2, 2007, ¶¶ 13-15; 62-\n8 69).  Defendants oppose the motion on the grounds that plaintiffs\n9 have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating good cause\n10 under Rule 16 and that leave to amend should not be granted under\n11 Rule 15.  (Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot., filed Feb. 23, 2007\n12 (“Opp’n”).\n13 Defendants argue that plaintiffs fail to demonstrate the\n14 requisite diligence under Rule 16 to add new plaintiffs who are\n15 current UC Davis students because plaintiffs and their counsel\n16 were on notice of facts giving rise to their current motion for\n17 leave to amend long before their motion was filed.  Plaintiffs\n18 contend that the last remaining active student at UC Davis,\n19 Lauren Mancuso, graduated in June 2006, during the ten-month stay\n20 of this action, and therefore, “it is now proper to add\n21 additional plaintiffs.”  (Pls.’ Reply, filed Mar. 2, 2007, at 6). \n22 As an initial matter, plaintiffs and their counsel were on notice\n23 since 2004 that Arezou Mansourian, one of the two proposed class\n24 representatives, graduated from UC Davis in June 2004 and that\n25 Lauren Mancuso was the only proposed class representative that\n26 currently attended UC Davis.  Mancuso testified in her deposition\n27 on January 30, 2006, that she filed to graduate from UC Davis in\n28 late September or early October 2005.  (Dep. of Lauren Mancuso,\n7\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 8 of 12\n1 Ex. 10 to Decl. of Nancy Sheehan in Supp. of Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot.\n2 to Amend (“Sheehan Decl.”), filed Feb. 23, 2007, at 48:15-21). \n3 Plaintiffs filed their original motion for class certification in\n4 December 2005, after Mancuso had filed to graduate.  Soon after\n5 her deposition was taken, however, Mancuso was informed that she\n6 needed another two classes in order to graduate, which she\n7 enrolled in and successfully completed in order to graduate in\n8 June 2006.  (Decl. of Lauren Mancuso in Supp. of Pls.’ Mot. to\n9 Amend, filed March 2, 2007, ¶ 2).  As such, plaintiffs were on\n10 notice (1) that Mancuso had filed to graduate in 2005; and (2)\n11 that in early 2006, she had to take two more classes, which she\n12 enrolled in Spring 2006.  Therefore, months prior to the issuance\n13 of the stay in April 2006, plaintiffs knew that Mancuso either\n14 had graduated or would shortly be graduating from UC Davis, and\n15 that none of the class representatives would be current UC Davis\n16 students.  \n17 Plaintiffs’ prior counsel could have brought a motion to\n18 amend the complaint to add new plaintiffs who were current UC\n19 David students.  However, she did not do so.  Rather, plaintiffs\n20 filed a motion to certify the class in December 2005 and noticed\n21 a hearing date in April 2006.  Defendants filed a lengthy\n22 opposition to plaintiffs’ motion, arguing in part that Mansourian\n23 and Mancuso do not have standing to be class representatives\n24 because they had both graduated and exhausted their eligibility\n25 to participate in varsity sports at UC Davis under N.C.A.A.\n26 rules.  Now, plaintiffs’ new counsel seeks a “second bite at the\n27 apple,” by proposing new class plaintiffs who are current\n28 students at UC Davis.  However, the retention of new counsel does\n8\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 9 of 12\n1 not constitute good cause to amend the pretrial scheduling order\n2 and add new party plaintiffs.  The party’s diligence in seeking\n3 the amendment must be demonstrated.  Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609\n4 (“If [the] party was not diligent, the inquiry should end.”). \n5 Because plaintiffs and plaintiffs’ counsel was on notice of the\n6 graduation status of the proposed class representatives well\n7 before the stay of this action, plaintiffs have failed to\n8 demonstrate diligence in bringing this motion to amend.        \n9 In regards to plaintiffs additional allegations relating to\n10 field hockey and rugby, defendants contend that plaintiffs knew\n11 as early as April 2004 that women’s sport club teams, such as the\n12 rugby and field hockey club teams, requested elevation to varsity\n13 status.  (Sheehan Decl. ¶ 3) (stating that document requests\n14 pertaining to requests from women’s sport club teams to be\n15 elevated to varsity status were disclosed in April 2004 in\n16 defendants’ initial Rule 26 disclosures).  At that time, two\n17 years prior to the stay in this action, plaintiffs had notice\n18 that the named plaintiffs in this action only alleged that they\n19 participated or wished to participate in a varsity wrestling\n20 program.  Plaintiffs could have moved to amend the complaint to\n21 add proposed class representatives who participated in other\n22 sport club teams at UC Davis.  However, plaintiffs failed to do\n23 so.5  Now, almost three years later, plaintiffs’ new counsel\n24 seeks to add new class plaintiffs and new allegations relating to\n25\n26\n5 Rather, plaintiffs filed their motion for class\n27 certification in December 2005.  In their opposition to the\nmotion, defendants asserted that plaintiffs were not adequate\n28 class representatives of a class consisting of all female\nstudent-athletes because their interests focused on wrestling. \n9\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 10 of 12\n1 rugby and field hockey “in light of the scope of the relief\n2 sought.”  (Pls.’ Mot. to Amend at 1).  However, because\n3 plaintiffs’ delayed in bringing a motion to amend after they\n4 learned of the underlying facts which are the basis of this\n5 motion, plaintiffs fail to demonstrate good cause under Rule 16.\n6 Further, even if plaintiffs had demonstrated good cause, the\n7 proposed amendments to the complaint would be prejudicial to\n8 defendants.6  See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 15; Martinez, 125 F.3d at\n9 785 (9th Cir. 1997) (“[L]eave to amend should be granted unless\n10 amendment would cause prejudice to the opposing party, is sought\n11 in bad faith, is futile, or creates undue delay.”).  Prior to the\n12 stay, this case was vigorously litigated by the parties. \n13 Defendants’ counsel has submitted evidence that, based upon the\n14 allegations in the complaint and the facts relative to the\n15 proposed class representatives, the majority of discovery in this\n16 case has related to the participation of women in the wrestling\n17 program at UC Davis.  (See Sheehan Decl. ¶ 6).  Defendants also\n18 present evidence that significant resources have been expended in\n19 drafting dispositive motions based upon the allegations in the\n20 complaint.  (Sheehan Decl. ¶ 7).  Plaintiffs’ amendments would\n21 require defendants to expend these resources again, after\n22 defendants already vigorously litigated this case for over two\n23\n24\n25\n6 For the reasons set forth above in the court’s\n26 discussion of plaintiffs’ diligence in bringing a motion to\namend, plaintiffs’ delay also raises concerns regarding undue\n27 delay.  See Kaplan v. Rose, 49 F.3d 1363, 1370 (9th Cir. 1994)\n(holding that the district court did not abuse in denying leave\n28 to amend where the “new” facts and theories had been known to the\nparty seeking amendment since the inception of the litigation). \n10\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 11 of 12\n1 years.  See Kaplan, 49 F.3d at 1370 (“Expense, delay, and wear\n2 and tear on individuals and companies count toward prejudice.”).  \n3 Plaintiffs contend that due to an extended discovery\n4 deadline, defendants have “ample opportunity to conduct discovery\n5 with respect to these new plaintiffs and to litigate any issues\n6 arising from these amendments.”  (Pls.’ Reply at 8-9).  However,\n7 this “opportunity” does not lessen the prejudice to defendants as\n8 to the resources they have already devoted to this litigation\n9 since its inception and up to the point, three years later, when\n10 plaintiffs seek to amend the complaint.  Plaintiffs contend that\n11 the new plaintiffs and allegations do not change the scope of the\n12 litigation, and thus, the prejudice is not substantial.  The\n13 court disagrees.  While plaintiffs may have sought to bring\n14 challenges on behalf of all women athletes at UC Davis, the\n15 plaintiffs only alleged that they had experience and sought\n16 opportunities in wrestling.  The factual allegations in the\n17 original complaint related only to the opportunities available\n18 for women to participate in the UC Davis varsity wrestling\n19 program and plaintiffs’ inability to receive the benefits of\n20 being a varsity wrestler.  Further, in the class action\n21 allegations, plaintiffs alleged that “Class Plaintiffs seek to\n22 represent the class of all present and future female students at\n23 UC Davis who are denied equal athletic participation\n24 opportunities and scholarships in women’s wrestling by\n25 Defendants’ discriminatory actions.”  (Compl. ¶ 108). \n26 Plaintiffs’ original requested relief also focused on increasing\n27 wrestling opportunities for women athletes at UC Davis.  Now\n28 plaintiffs seek to add more claims relating to rugby and field\n11\n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 175    Filed 03/20/07   Page 12 of 12\n1 hockey.  Contrary to plaintiffs’ contentions, these amendments\n2 would substantially broaden the scope of litigation in this\n3 matter.        \n4 Finally, the court is not unaware that the proposed\n5 amendments to plaintiffs’ complaint specifically address\n6 arguments raised by defendants’ in their opposition to\n7 plaintiffs’ previously filed motion for class certification. \n8 While the court is sympathetic to the situation of plaintiffs’\n9 prior counsel, these circumstances and the appointment of new\n10 counsel does not justify giving plaintiffs a “second bite at the\n11 apple” with the benefit of defendants’ previous filings.\n12 Therefore, because plaintiffs have not demonstrated good\n13 cause to modify the pretrial scheduling order to allow amendments\n14 to the complaint, and because the proposed amendments would be\n15 prejudicial to defendants, plaintiffs’ motion to amend the\n16 complaint is DENIED.      \n17 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n18 DATED: March 20, 2007\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n12",

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiffs Mansourian, Mancuso, and Ng are former female university wrestlers who filed this civil rights \n3  action in December 2003 seeking relief for ongoing violations of federal and state civil rights laws arising from \n4  discrimination by the Regents of the University of California and university administrators against women athletes \n5  at the University of California at Davis (“UCD”).  Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is an \n6  improper piecemeal attack on the pleadings, which fails on all fronts.  In addition to raising several arguments that \n7  have already been rejected by this Court in this case, defendants continue to misapprehend the scope of plaintiffs’ \n8  Complaint and the basic principles that guide federal civil rights laws, misconstrue or ignore the multitude of \n9  discriminatory practices on which plaintiffs base their claims for relief, and misapply the law related to public policy \n10  torts, remedies, and immunity.  The motion should be denied in its entirety. \n11  II.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n12  Beginning in the 1990s, varsity wrestling at UCD included both men and women.  Women wrestlers at UCD \n13  received highly qualified coaching, wrestled using women’s freestyle rules rather than men’s collegiate rules, and \n14  received all of the benefits of varsity status.  Complaint at ¶¶ 82, 85, Olivier Decl., Exh. A.  UCD sponsored a \n15  women’s division in its annual Aggie Open wrestling tournament.  Id. at ¶. 83.  Some women wrestlers from UCD \n16  went on to become nationally ranked and compete at a high level nationally and internationally.  Id. at ¶¶ 85-88. \n17  The Regents of the University of California are charged with overseeing the administration and operation of \n18  UCD, including its athletics program.  Id. at ¶¶ 13-15, 23.  The individual defendants, Larry Vanderhoef, Robert \n19  Franks, Greg Warzecka, Lawrence Swanson and Pam Gill-Fisher are responsible for the day-to-day administration \n20  of UCD and its athletic program.  Id. ¶¶ 16, 18-20.  They are also the individuals responsible for managing the \n21  wrestling program and ensuring non-discrimination in the athletic program.  Id. \n22  Plaintiffs are women wrestlers, who wrestled throughout high school and attended UCD, in large part, to \n23  wrestle.  Id. at ¶¶ 26, 29, 37, 38, 55.  During their tenure at UCD, Mansourian and Ng participated in varsity \n24  wrestling until UCD administrators abruptly forced all women out of the wrestling program.  Id. at ¶¶ 30, 56-60.  \n25  Prior to that, Mansourian and Ng received coaching by UCD’s head wrestling using women’s freestyle rules.  Id. at \n26  ¶ 82.  They also received all of the benefits usually bestowed upon varsity athletes at a university including health \n27  insurance, medical and athletic training services, academic tutoring services, strength and conditioning coaching, \n28 \n1 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

Id. at ¶¶ 33, 51.   \n2  In the Fall of 2000, Mansourian and Ng, completed the requirement to become eligible to participate in varsity \n3  wrestling and began attending wrestling practice.  Id. at ¶ 59.  Thereafter, they were informed that defendants had \n4  terminated all athletic participation opportunities for female, but not for male, wrestlers.  Id. at ¶ 60.  Defendants \n5  barred Mansourian and Ng from the wrestling and other varsity facilities, and withdrew all of their varsity benefits.  \n6  Id. at ¶¶ 61, 62.  Mansourian and Ng, along with other women wrestlers at UCD, met with defendant Warzecka, the \n7  UCD Athletic Director, to request reinstatement of the women’s wrestling team.  He refused and instead suggested \n8  that they form a women’s wrestling club team at their own expense.  Id. at ¶ 63.  As club team members, they would \n9  receive none of the benefits that had previously received as varsity athletes.  Id.  The women wrestlers also reached \n10  out to UCD Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, but he refused to meet with them.  Id. at ¶ 64.  In addition, UCD \n11  terminated Coach Burch.  Id. at ¶ 73. \n12  In the Spring of 2001, having exhausted their efforts within UCD to reinstate their status as varsity athletes, \n13  Mansourian and Ng filed a complaint with the United States Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights \n14  (“OCR”).  Id. at ¶ 67.  In June 2001, after significant media attention, student protests, and the involvement of a \n15  California state assemblywoman, defendants promised to fully reinstate women’s wrestling athletic participation \n16  opportunities.  Id. at ¶¶ 71-75. \n17  In the fall of 2001, Mansourian and Ng arrived at wrestling practice expecting to participate in the wrestling \n18  program.  They were joined by Lauren Mancuso who had enrolled in UCD intending to participate in varsity \n19  wrestling and had obtained athletic financial assistance.  All three athletes had completed the eligibility \n20  requirements for varsity wrestlers, and were deemed eligible.  Id. at ¶¶ 37-41, 75.  The new wrestling coaches, \n21  however, ignored them.  When the women complained, defendants informed them that they could only participate in \n22  wrestling if they could beat the male wrestlers using men’s collegiate wrestling rules.  Id. at ¶¶ 75-77.  This had \n23  never been a condition of women’s participation in wrestling at UCD.  Id. at ¶¶ 78, 82.   \n24  At all times relevant to this action, UCD has offered substantially more athletic participation opportunities and \n25  more athletic financial assistance to male students than to female students.  Id. at ¶¶ 129, 140.  In addition, UCD \n26  does not have a history or continuing practice of athletic program expansion.  Id. at ¶ 131.  Instead, UCD eliminated \n27  opportunities for women athletes by forcing women wrestlers out of the varsity wrestling program despite their \n28 \n2 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

UCD also eliminated athletic financial \n2  assistance by withdrawing the athletic scholarship to Lauren Mancuso, and by denying Mansourian, Ng and \n3  Mancuso the benefits of varsity status.  Id. at ¶¶ 40, 61-62. \n4  The Complaint was filed on December 18, 2003 and asserts six claims for relief: (1) violation of Title IX for \n5  failure to provide equal athletic opportunities to women; (2) violation of Title IX for failure to provide equal athletic \n6  financial assistance to women; (3) retaliation in violation of Title IX; (4) violation of 42 U.S.C. sec. 1983 based on \n7  the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution; (5) violation of the California Unruh Civil Rights Act; and (6) \n8  violation of public policy based upon the California Constitution and the California Education Code.  Docket #1. \n9  Defendants filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on March 5, 2004 (Docket # 13-15), which was denied on May 6, \n10  2004.  Docket # 18-21, 25.  There has been a substitution of plaintiffs’ lead counsel in the case and discovery \n11  continues.  Docket # 125, 137, 140, 143, 149. On January 24, 2007, the Court issued the 2nd Amended Status \n12  (Pretrial Scheduling) Order.  Docket #156.  Plaintiffs then moved for leave to amend the Complaint to add \n13  additional plaintiffs and related allegations.  Docket ## 158-161.  The Court denied plaintiffs’ motion.  Docket # \n14  175.  Plaintiffs subsequently voluntarily dismissed the class allegations of the Complaint.  Defendants filed the \n15  instant motion on June 5, 2007.  Docket # 188. \n \n16  III.  ARGUMENT \n \n17  A.  The Standard for a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Is a High Standard, Particularly in \nCivil Rights Cases, Which Defendants Cannot Overcome. \n18   \n19  Like a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a motion for judgment on the \n20  pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) must be denied “unless it appears to a certainty that no relief under any state of \n21  facts in support of his claim.  Mostowy v. United States, 966 F.2d 668, 672 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (noting standard is \n22  “stringent”); Qwest Communications Corp. v. City of Berkeley, 208 F.R.D. 288, 291 (N.D. Cal. 2002.) (noting \n23  standard same under Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(c).)  Defendants must establish that no material issue of fact \n24  remains to be resolved and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard \n25  Feiner & Co., Inc., 896 F.2d 1542, 1550 (9th Cir. 1989).  A court must assume the truthfulness of the material facts \n26  alleged in the complaint and construe all inferences reasonably drawn from these facts in favor of the responding \n27  party.  General Conference Corp. of Seventh-Day Adventists v. Seventh-Day Adventist Congregational Church, 887 \n28 \n3 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 11 of 29\n \n1  F.2d at 230; Hal Roach Studios, 896 F.2d at 1550.  Defendants are not entitled to judgment if the complaint raises \n2  issues of fact which, if proven, would support recovery.  Id. at  230.  This standard is applied with “particular \n3  strictness” in civil rights cases.  Shechter v. Comptroller of City of New York, 79 F.3d 265, 270 (2d Cir. 1996).    \n4  In addition, the court may only consider the facts stated within the four corners of the complaint.  The court \n5  may not examine any external facts, unless they are facts that are subject to judicial notice under Federal Rules of \n6  Evidence rule 201.1  Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001); R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., \n7  LLC v. International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150, 335 F.3d 643, 647 (7th Cir. 2003). \n8  Rule 12(c) does not specifically authorize a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings.  Cases allowing \n9  partial judgment on the pleadings have been limited to judgment as to an entire count.  See, e.g., Moran v. Peralta \n10  Cmty. Coll. Dist., 825 F. Supp. 891, 893 (N.D. Cal. 1993); In re Amica, Inc., 130 B.R. 792, 796 (Bankr. N.D.Ill. \n11  1991.)  Thus, a Rule 12(c) motion cannot be used to parse claims for relief and remedies or to strike less than an \n12  entire count.  Finally, the law prefers resolution on the merits and that cases be “tried on the proofs rather than the \n13  pleadings,” Renni & Laughlin, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 242 F.2d 208, 213 (9th Cir. 1957). \n \n14  B.  Defendants’ Attempt to Recast its Second Elimination of Plaintiffs from Varsity Athletics as a \nLawful Act Does Not Support Judgment on the Pleadings as to Any of Plaintiffs’ Claims. \n15   \n16  Much of defendants’ motion hinges on the argument that their second elimination of plaintiffs from the \n17  wrestling program in the Fall of 2001 by requiring that women wrestle and beat the men using men’s collegiate rules \n18  was a lawful act.  From this false assertion, defendants argue that plaintiffs’ federal claims are time barred, because \n19  the “lawful” second elimination ended defendants’ discrimination against plaintiffs, such that there is no “continuing \n20  violation” and plaintiffs’ claims as to defendants’ earlier acts of discrimination are rendered untimely.   \n21  At its core, this argument is the very same that this Court rejected when it denied defendants’ motion to \n22  dismiss over three years ago.  The Court held then that defendants could not defeat plaintiffs’ Complaint by parsing \n23  portions of plaintiffs’ claims.  Docket #25, pp. 13-14.  Further, the Court specifically held that any argument that \n24  portions of plaintiffs’ federal claims may be barred by the applicable statute of limitations must be raised in a motion \n25  for summary judgment.  Id.  Defendants ignore this mandate, however, and again seek dismissal based upon \n26 \n27                                                             \n1  Though defendants seek judicial notice of a number of documents, the requests are improper or otherwise not determinative of this \n28  motion for the reasons set forth below and in Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice, filed herewith. \n4 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 12 of 29\n \n1  plaintiffs’ pleadings.  Defendants’ argument continues to fail for several reasons.  \n \n2  1.  The Second Elimination Is But One of Many Unlawful Acts that Support Plaintiffs’ \nClaims of Discrimination. \n3 \nDefendants urge the Court to “dismiss all claims based on the ‘second elimination’ (i.e. the Fall 2001 \n4 \ntryouts).”  See Defs’ MPA at 5.  None of plaintiffs’ claims, however, are based solely on this act.  Rather, as the \n5 \nCourt noted the first time it denied defendants’ motion to dismiss, this act is one of many unlawful acts in a policy \n6 \nand practice of discrimination by defendants.  Docket #25, pp. 12-16. \n7 \nDefendants cannot seek dismissal of only portion of a claim.  See In re Amica, 130 B.R. at 796.  Plaintiffs \n8 \nallege that defendants have violated their civil rights because from the moment defendants refused to allow women \n9 \nto wrestle in the varsity program, defendants began to discriminate against plaintiffs on the basis of their gender.  \n10 \nThat discrimination continued each and every day that plaintiffs attended UCD because women’s wrestling \n11 \nopportunities were never reinstated as they had existed.  As detailed in the Complaint and summarized above, \n12 \ndefendants’ discrimination took several forms, included multiple acts on discrimination, constituted a policy and \n13 \npractice of discrimination, and continues to this day.  Importantly, all of this discrimination was against the \n14 \nbackdrop of defendants’ ongoing discrimination against women because it was failing, and continues to fail, to \n15 \nprovide equal athletic opportunities and athletic financial assistance to women throughout the UCD athletic \n16 \nprogram.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶ 129, 131, 140.  Indeed, defendants were in violation of Title IX even before they \n17 \neliminated women’s wrestling.  Id.  Thus defendants’ second elimination was but one example of the discrimination \n18 \nplaintiffs have had to endure.  Plaintiffs’ claims, therefore, do not rise or fall upon defendants’ second elimination of \n19 \nplaintiffs from the wrestling program.     \n20   \n2.  Defendants Cannot Establish as a Matter of Law on the Pleadings that the Second \n21  Elimination of Plaintiffs from Varsity Athletics Was Lawful. \n \n22 \nAlthough the only facts before the Court on this motion are those that were considered on the prior Rule \n23 \n12(b)(6) motion defendants now claim that those allegations establish that their conduct was lawful.  Specifically, \n24 \ndefendants claim that the decision to require plaintiffs to wrestle and beat male athletes on the team using men’s \n25 \ncollegiate rules in order to participate in varsity wrestling was a lawful, nondiscriminatory policy.  This argument \n26 \nthat such a policy is lawful because it “treats women the same as men” is disingenuous at best.  \n27 \nFirst, as this Court noted, defendants’ act in the Fall of 2001 to “allow” plaintiffs to participate in wrestling \n28 \n5 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 13 of 29\n \n1  was under “different conditions – conditions that plaintiffs allege prevented them from participating in wrestling.”  \n2  Docket #25 at p. 11.  Defendants changed their behavior toward women wrestlers in a manner that increased the \n3  discrimination, already prevalent at UCD, against women in athletics.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A at ¶¶ 75-78, 82.  \n4  Previously, defendants had maintained a varsity’s wrestling program in which women practiced and competed only \n5  against women using freestyle as opposed to collegiate rules.  Id. at ¶¶ 82, 85.  Defendants removed all women from \n6  the program in 2000, and then a year later allowed them back on the team only if they could meet the new \n7  conditions.  Not only were defendants’ actions part of a continuing discriminatory scheme against women in \n8  athletics at UCD, but they were also in retaliation for plaintiffs complaining about discrimination in athletics at \n9  UCD.  Id. at ¶¶ 154-158.   \n10  Second, requiring that women compete against men in a contact sport generally applicable to men, in order \n11  to have a varsity athletic opportunity, is hardly non-discriminatory.  If such a policy were generally permitted there \n12  would be a substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls thereby denying them a real opportunity to compete.  \n13  This is precisely why courts have repeatedly upheld separate but equal athletic programs under Title IX as \n14  constitutionally permissible.  See, e.g., O’Conner v. Bd. of Educ., 449 U.S. 1301 (1980). \n15    The cases cited by defendants provide them no support.  Most stand for the unremarkable proposition that \n16  the Constitution and federal civil rights laws require equal treatment of the sexes and involve women and men \n17  competing against each other in non-contact sports or at young ages before size and strength difference between \n18  male and female become an issue.  See Fortin v. Darlington Little League, Inc., 514 F.2d 344 (1st Cir. 1975) \n19  (holding that prohibiting girl from trying out for boys’ little league baseball violated equal protection); Brenden v. \n20  Independent Sch. Dist., 477 F.2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1973) (holding that high school failed to demonstrate a rational \n21  basis for excluding women from non-contact men’s sports teams).  None of the cases stand for the proposition that a \n22  university that had previously provided separate women’s athletic opportunities acted in a nondiscriminatory \n23  manner by suddenly requiring women to compete against men.  See, e.g., Lantz v. Ambach, 620 F. Supp. 663, 665-\n24  66 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (where no separate team, girl must be allowed to try out for boys’ junior varsity football team); \n25  Hoover v. Meiklejohn, 430 F. Supp. 164, 171 (D.Colo. 1977)  (where no separate girls’ soccer team, school \n26  obligated to allow girls to try out for boys’ team or to field separate teams). \n27    Third, defendants improperly attempt to use documents from the OCR as evidence in support of their claims \n28 \n6 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 14 of 29\n \n1  that the second elimination policy is lawful.  These documents are not the proper subject of judicial notice and may \n2  not be relied on by defendants as support of their version of an ultimate issue in this case.  See Plts’ Opp. to Defs’ \n3  RJN, filed concurrently herewith.  The OCR documents do not provide an evidentiary basis for the argument in any \n4  case.  The documents are inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rules of Evidence 801.  In addition, several OCR \n5  letters merely reflect a decision to close the complaint files without a full investigation or consultation with \n6  plaintiffs, after voluntary action taken by defendants. OCR does not conclude the absence of discrimination or \n7  retaliation.  Moreover, any such finding would not be determinative here.  Rowinsky v. Bryan Independent School \n8  District, 80 F.3d 1006, 1015-1016 (OCR findings accorded little weight); Philbrook v. Ansonia Bd. of Education, \n9  757 F.2d 476, 481 (2d Cir. 1985) (probable cause by an administrative agency not determinative). \n10  3.  Plaintiffs’ Federal Claims Are Timely. \n11  Defendants further argue that plaintiffs’ federal claims are time barred, because the “lawful” second \n12  elimination ended defendants’ discrimination against plaintiffs, such that there is no “continuing violation” and \n13  plaintiffs’ claims as to defendants’ earlier acts of discrimination are rendered untimely.  The second elimination of \n14  plaintiffs from varsity wrestling is not lawful as a matter of law.  Thus, defendants’ timeliness argument fails.  \n15  Further, to the extent that defendants claim that the second elimination was the final “act” upon which plaintiffs’ \n16  claims could accrue, the Court has already decided this very issue in plaintiffs’ favor.   \n17  In their first motion to dismiss, defendants argued that the last of defendants’ actions which could form the \n18  basis for plaintiffs’ claim for damages occurred in the Fall of 2001, when defendants required plaintiffs to meet the \n19  new conditions in order to participate in varsity wrestling.2 The Court held, however, that plaintiffs do not allege \n20  discrete acts of discrimination, but instead allege a policy and practice of discrimination such that the statute of \n21  limitations does not turn on a specific act of defendants: \n \n22  “Defendants’ argument ignores other allegations of plaintiffs’ complaint.  Plaintiffs Mansourian [and \nMancuso] are current UCD students who are currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly sex \n23  discriminatory practices.  [Citations.]  As UCD students, their claims accrue each and every day they are \ndenied equal access to athletic participation and scholarship opportunities. [Citations.]  At the time plaintiffs \n24  filed the instant complaint, plaintiffs allege they should have been wrestling for UCD and receiving all the \nvarsity benefits and scholarships provided to male wrestlers, but defendants refused, and continue to refuse, \n25  to date, to allow their participation. They have thus stated facts sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss, \nregardless of what statute of limitations applies.”  Docket #25, p. 12:1-13. \n26 \n27                                                             \n2   Plaintiffs incorporate by reference their opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss in 2004, which remains fully applicable to \n28  defendants’ repeated arguments here. Docket # 98. \n7 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 15 of 29\n \n \n1 \nSimilarly, the Court held that although plaintiff Ng had graduated at the time the Complaint was filed, \n2 \nbecause her graduation date is not on the face of the Complaint, and because “the Court must accept the facts stated \n3 \nin the complaint as true, and must construe them in favor on Ng, the court must likewise deny the motion to dismiss \n4 \nas to her since there is a set of facts in which her claim would survive.”  Docket #25, p. 13. \n5 \nBoth holdings remain as applicable now as they were when this Court first issued them.  Moreover, the \n6 \nCourt in its order specifically stated that any further argument related to the statute of limitations must be raised in a \n7 \nsummary judgment motion, not in yet another motion to attack the pleadings.  Docket #25, pp. 9-16.  Defendants’ \n8 \nblatant disregard for this Court’s order warrants summary denial of its motion for judgment on the pleadings.   \n9 \nMoreover, defendants continue to misconstrue the proper limitations analysis.  Defendants were failing to \n10 \nprovide equal athletic opportunities to women even before they barred plaintiffs from the wrestling program.  For \n11 \npurposes of the statute of limitations, plaintiffs had a right each and every day of their enrollment at UCD to equal \n12 \naccess to educational benefits.  Thus plaintiffs’ claims began to accrue at least as early as defendant’s termination of \n13 \nwomen’s wrestling at UCD in the Fall of 2000 and continued to accrue until they left UCD. \n14 \nThe applicable limitations period for Title IX and for § 1983 actions is governed by California’s general \n15 \npersonal injury statute.  See Stanley v. Trustees of the California State Univ., 433 F.3d 1129, 1136 (9th Cir. 2006) \n16 \n(“Title IX claims are subject to the applicable state statute of limitations for personal injury actions.”); Azer v. \n17 \nConnell, 306 F.3d 930, 935 (9th Cir. 2002) (§ 1983 actions governed by state statute of limitations for personal \n18 \ninjury actions).  Defendants erroneously cite to Stanley to argue that the statute of limitations is one year.  The Ninth \n19 \nCircuit in Stanley held, as is consistent with “every other federal circuit to consider this issue,” that “Title IX claims \n20 \nare subject to the applicable state statute of limitations for personal injury actions.”  Stanley¸ 433 F.3d at 1135-36.   \n21 \nCalifornia’s personal injury statute of limitations was amended to extend to two years.  See Cal. Code Civ. \n22 \nProc. 335.1.   As this Court has already held in this case on this issue, section 335.1 “extend[s] the limitations period \n23 \nof an actionable claim if the extension occurs before the claim for relief becomes time barred under the old \n24 \nlimitations period.”  Docket #25, p. 11, citing Douglas Aircraft Co. v. Cranston, 58 Cal. 2d 462, 465 (1962)); see \n25 \nalso Lamke v. Sunstate Equipment Co., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1044, 1052 (N.D.Cal. 2004) (“[t]he extension of the \n26 \nstatutory period within which an action must be brought [here, from one year to two] is generally held to be valid if \n27 \nmade before the cause of action is barred.”) (citation omitted); Thompson v.

S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 16 of 29\n \n1  1017, 1024 (E.D.Cal. 2004) (same).  \n2  Section 335.1 became effective on January 1, 2003.  Thus, as long as the claim accrued on January 2, 2002 \n3  or later, the two year statute of limitations applies.  And, because the Complaint was filed on December 18, 2003, \n4  any such claims are timely.  Moreover, even if a one year statute of limitations applies, the claim is timely if it \n5  accrued on or after December 18, 2002.3  Plaintiffs Mansourian and Mancuso were still students at UCD when the \n6  Complaint was filed and their claims are therefore timely.  Plaintiff Ng had graduated, but as noted above, her \n7  graduation date is not stated on the face of the Complaint.  As this Court has already held, any argument regarding \n8  the statute of limitations, therefore, has to be raised in a motion for summary judgment.  Docket #25, p. 13. \n9  D.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Pled a Retaliation Claim Under Title IX. \n10  The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized a cause of action for retaliation under Title IX.  Jackson v. \n11  Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167 (2005).  To establish such a claim, plaintiffs must show that they were \n12  retaliated against because they complained of sex discrimination.  Id. at 184 and 1510.  Plaintiffs have alleged facts, \n13  which if accepted as true and construed in their favor, adequately support their claim that defendants unlawfully \n14  retaliated against them.  In particular, plaintiffs have alleged that they repeatedly complained and protested about \n15  Defendants’ failure to comply with Title IX based on their sex and that defendants retaliated against them by \n16  refusing to reverse their decision to eliminate women from the wrestling program, reneging on their subsequent \n17  promise to reverse their decision, firing the wrestling coach who supported and trained women wrestlers, and \n18  forcing plaintiffs and other women wrestlers to compete against and beat men under different rules – conditions that \n19  had never previously been imposed – in order to participate in varsity wrestling.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶ 151-158.   \n20  Despite these allegations, defendants argue once again that plaintiffs’ retaliation claim is untimely and that it \n21  is barred as a matter of law because just one of the above allegations references a third party, Coach Burch.  Neither \n22  argument has merit. The Court has already rejected defendants’ argument that plaintiffs’ Title IX retaliation claim is \n23  time barred and defendants have failed to state any legal basis that would bar plaintiffs’ retaliation claim -- even if \n24  the only allegation underlying such claim was based on defendants’ termination of plaintiffs’ coach.  Finally, \n25  Defendants’ efforts to parse out just one factual basis for plaintiffs’ retaliation claim should fail because it would not \n26 \n27                                                             \n3   Any statute of limitations also would be equitably tolled while plaintiffs sought administrative relief through the OCR.  Daviton v. \n28  Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., 241 F.3d 1131 (9th Cir. 2001); Lucchesi v. Bar-O Boys Ranch, 353 F.3d 691 (9th Cir. 2003). \n9 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

The Court Has Already Ruled that Plaintiffs’ Retaliation Claim Is Timely. \n3    This Court has already rejected defendants’ argument, made again here, that plaintiffs’ retaliation claim is \n4  time barred because no retaliation occurred after plaintiffs engaged in the protected activity of filing the OCR \n5  complaint in the Spring of 2001.  Defendants misapprehend plaintiffs’ allegations:  the protected activity is not \n6  limited to the OCR complaint but extends to plaintiffs’ complaints to UCD about its discrimination.  Olivier Decl., \n7  Exh. A, ¶¶ 151-153.  In addition, as the Court noted previously: “As to the retaliation claim in particular, plaintiffs \n8  allege defendants retaliated against them and continue to retaliate against them by, among the other [specific \n9  retaliatory acts alleged in the Complaint], continuing to refuse and failing to treat female athletes, especially \n10  wrestlers, equitably.”  Docket #25, p. 12, fn. 10.  For these very same reasons, defendants’ Rule 12(c) motion on the \n11  timeliness argument should be denied.   \n3.    Plaintiffs’ Retaliation Claim Is Based on the Personal Harm Plaintiffs Suffered, \n12           Including Coach Burch’s Termination.4 \n13  Plaintiffs’ retaliation claim seeks to redress the harm they personally suffered as a result complaining about \n14  the discrimination they experienced based on their sex.  This harm includes plaintiffs being “denied their civil right \n15  to enjoy an equal opportunity to participate in varsity athletics and to receive athletic financial assistance.”  Olivier \n16  Decl., Exh. A, ¶ 160.  Courts have determined that the harm Title IX plaintiffs suffer as a result of losing the \n17  benefits accorded to women athletes who compete interscholastically can be irreparable.  See, e.g., Choike v. \n18  Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania, 2006 WL 2060576 at *9 (lost opportunities to “develop skill, self \n19  confidence, learn team cohesion and sense of accomplishment, increase their physical and mental well-being, and \n20  develop a life long healthy attitude”).  Plaintiffs here also suffered emotional distress, lost self-esteem, and \n21  humiliation as a result of defendants’ retaliation.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶  135, 146, 160.  \n22  Despite plaintiffs’ clearly pled claims of personal harm, defendants seek to bar plaintiffs’ retaliation claim \n23  because they lack “third party standing.”  Defendants argue that plaintiffs do not meet the criteria to seek redress for \n24  injuries done to others, referencing Coach Burch and citing cases that are inapposite to the circumstances underlying \n25 \n26 \n                                                           \n27  4  Once again, defendants improperly ask this Court to parse portions of plaintiffs’ claims and subject them to judgment on the pleadings.  \nPlaintiffs have alleged multiple retaliatory actions in support of their retaliation claim, only one of which is firing coach Burch.  Defendants \n28  are not entitled to judgment on only a portion of a particular claim.  See, e.g., In re Amica, Inc., 130 B.R. at 796.   \n10 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 18 of 29\n \n1  plaintiffs’ claims.5  This argument fails as it is based on the clearly erroneous assumption that plaintiffs are seeking \n2  to redress the injury suffered by Coach Burch.   \n3  Defendants argue in the alternative, that “even if plaintiffs contend that they are seeking redress for injuries \n4  done to them resulting from Burch’s departure, the retaliation claim still lacks merit.”  Defs’ MPA at 8.  Neither   \n5  case upon which defendants rely supports this claim.  In Shaposhikov v. Pacifica Sch. Dist., 2006 WL 931731 (N.D. \n6  Cal. 2006), the Court ruled that plaintiff’s allegations of retaliation -- that defendants were too lenient on a student \n7  sexual harasser – related to actions that did not involve the plaintiff and therefore were not actionable under Title \n8  IX.  Here, the removal of Coach Burch had an immediate, severe and direct impact upon plaintiffs who were \n9  deprived of the physical training and moral support Coach Burch provided each of them individually, a deprivation \n10  that continued when the replacement coach not only refused to train and support plaintiffs but imposed even greater \n11  barriers to their being able to participate in wrestling.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶ 75-79, 151-158.  Choike also does \n12  not assist defendants, as it did not involve students being directly harmed by the coach’s termination but rather \n13  involved a coach’s claim that a school’s elimination of the teams he coached violated Title IX.  2006 WL 2060576. \n14  The court reasoned there that the loss of his coaching job was not the result of intentional discrimination directed at \n15  plaintiff but a “mere by-product” of their decision to eliminate the teams.  Here, the decision to terminate Burch was \n16  not a “mere by-product” of defendants’ decision to eliminate the women’s wrestling team because the job he \n17  performed continued to exist and defendants hired a new coach to replace him.  Moreover, plaintiffs allege that fired \n18  Coach Burch in direct retaliation for plaintiffs’ complaints of discrimination. \n19  Undaunted, defendants assert that in order to state a claim for retaliation based upon Burch’s firing, \n20  plaintiffs must also demonstrate that Burch’s firing was a “materially adverse employment action.”  Defendants’ \n21  suggestion that a termination is not “materially adverse” is nonsensical.6  Moreover, to the extent that what \n22  defendants are attempting to argue is that Burch’s termination must be “materially adverse” to plaintiffs, (1) \n23  defendants have failed to offer any law to support this assertion; and (2) plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \n24 \n25                                                             \n5   Lowrey v. Texas A&M, 117 F.3d 242, 251 (5th Cir. 1997) and Hankerson v. Thomas County Sch. Dist. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25576 *7-\n26  8 (M.D. Ga. 2005) are irrelevant to the analysis of plaintiffs’ retaliation claim on behalf of themselves because they involve claims brought \nby coaches on behalf of their students.   \n27  6  Defendants rely upon Title VII law for this argument.  But the inquiry there is entirely different: courts evaluating whether an adverse \nemployment action is retaliatory look to whether it is “materially adverse” as a measure of the severity of the action taken against the \n28  plaintiff.  See, e.g., Ray v. Herndeson, 217 F.3d 1234, 1243 (9th Cir. 2000). \n11 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 19 of 29\n \n1  Burch’s termination was material in that it caused plaintiffs further harm.   \n2  To the extent that “materiality” is relevant to any inquiry at all, it would be in the context similar to the First \n3  Circuit’s adaptation of Title VII’s retaliation framework to the education context.  There, the Court held that \n4  retaliation claims include four elements: (1) plaintiffs engaged in protected activity; (2) alleged retaliator knew of \n5  protected activity; (3) alleged retaliator subsequently undertook some disadvantageous action against plaintiffs; and \n6  (4) retaliatory motive played a substantial role.  Frazier v. Fairhaven Sch. Comm., 276 F.3d 52, 67 (1st Cir. 2002).  \n7  Plaintiffs specifically alleged facts in the Complaint sufficient to make a showing of retaliation under these four \n8  elements:  (1) plaintiffs complained about gender discrimination in athletics and the removal of women wrestlers to \n9  UCD adminstrators and to the OCR through formal complaints; (2) defendants knew of plaintiffs’ protected activity; \n10  (3) defendants subsequently withdrew their promise to reinstate women’s wrestling, imposed conditions on women \n11  wrestlers that effectively barred them from participating, terminated their coach, and continued to refuse to provide \n12  equal athletic opportunities each day plaintiffs remained as students as UCD; and (4) defendants’ adverse actions \n13  were in direct response to and were intended to discriminate against plaintiffs in retaliation for the exercise of their \n14  rights under Title IX.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶ 60-79, 151-158.  To assert that this harm to plaintiffs, which was so \n15  shocking as to draw the attention of the media, the state legislature, and fellow students, is not a materially adverse \n16  action is not only spurious but also raise a material issue of fact.  It cannot be a basis for judgment on the pleadings.  \n17  Finally, defendants’ policy arguments are equally unpersuasive. First, defendants’ suggestion that allowing \n18  plaintiffs’ claim to proceed would subject schools to hundreds of lawsuits claiming the effect of a discriminatory \n19  personnel decision is hyperbolic fantasy and, in any event, is unsupported by its legal argument that “federal funding \n20  recipients could not have contemplated such liability in accepting federal funds.”  Defs’ MPA at 8.  To the extent a \n21  school’s retaliatory actions are taken against a teacher and a student, as is the case here, the school is liable to the \n22  student, as well as the teacher, under Title IX.  See, e.g., Jackson, 544 U.S. at 182 (stating that “funding recipients \n23  have been on notice that they could be subjected to private suits for intentional sex discrimination under Title XI \n24  since 1979”).  Having agreed to comply with Title IX and its federal regulations and having accepted and spent \n25  federal Title IX funding, Defendants cannot avoid the obligations to which it previously agreed by now arguing that \n26  plaintiffs’ claim that Coach Burch’s firing was one of several retaliatory acts against plaintiffs is an invalid exercise \n27  of the spending clause.  Indeed, it would offend every principle of equity to permit Defendants to enjoy the benefits \n28 \n12 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

Defendants’ alternative policy argument, that allowing plaintiffs to \n2  seek redress based on Coach Burch’s termination would require a “trial within a trial” regarding whether his \n3  departure constituted an adverse” action, is unsupported by any authority. \n4  E.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Pled a § 1983 Claim.   \n5  Plaintiffs assert a claim against defendants under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of the equal protection \n6  clause of the U.S. Constitution.  Defendants’ assertion that this claim is subsumed by Title IX is incorrect.  The \n7  significance and practical importance of § 1983 cannot be understated.  It was “intended to provide a remedy, to be \n8  broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.” Monell v. New York City \n9  Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 700-701 (1978).  \n10  Federal rights are presumptively enforceable under § 1983.  This presumption may be defeated only in \n11  exceptional cases by showing clear congressional intent to restrict plaintiffs to the set of remedies that are available \n12  under the violated statute itself, thereby precluding § 1983 enforcement.  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes v. \n13  Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n, 453 \n14  U.S. 1 (1981). \n15  The Supreme Court has found a statutory scheme to bar enforcement of rights under § 1983 in only three \n16  cases, all of which are fundamentally different than the claims before this Court.  In Sea Clammers, the Court found \n17  that the “unusually elaborate enforcement provisions” of two federal environmental laws that “created so many \n18  specific statutory remedies” suggested that Congress did not intend to preserve a § 1983 right of action based on the \n19  federal statute (as opposed to any constitutional right).  453 U.S. at 20-21.  In Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 \n20  (1984), the Supreme Court foreclosed a § 1983 action because it found that Congress intended that the Education of \n21  the Handicapped Act to be the “exclusive avenue” through which a plaintiff may assert those claims.  Id. at 1009.  In \n22  Rancho Palos Verdes, the Supreme Court barred reliance on § 1983 to enforce the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n23  based on the “detailed scheme” and “limited remedies” of the statute and the legislative history that suggests \n24  Congress intended TCA to be an exclusive remedy.  544 U.S. at 120.  Significantly, the Court stated that the \n25  determinative inquiry is whether Congress intended the statute at issue to be the exclusive remedy such that it is \n26  incompatible with enforcement under § 1983.  Id.  \n27  To be clear, plaintiffs’ § 1983 claim is based on the equal protection clause, not on their rights under Title \n28 \n13 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

Although the Ninth Circuit has not ruled on the issue, three other circuits have expressly held that a plaintiff’s \n2  1983 claim based on the equal protection clause is not subsumed by Title IX.  As the Eighth Circuit found:  “To the \n3  extent that [plaintiff’s] § 1983 claims are premised on alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause, we believe \n4  that the application of Sea Clammers to her claims is plainly inapposite.  Sea Clammers in no way restricts a \n5  plaintiff's ability to seek redress via § 1983 for the violation of independently existing constitutional rights, even if \n6  the same set of facts also gives rise to a cause of action for the violation of statutory rights.”  Crawford v. Davis, 109 \n7  F.3d 1281, 1284 (8th Cir. 1997); see also Seamons v. Snow, 84 F.3d 1226, 1233 (10th Cir. 1996) (plaintiff has \n8  independent rights under Title IX and under § 1983 for violations of constitutional rights); Lillard v. Shelby County \n9  Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 722- 23 (6th Cir.1996) (plaintiff’s § 1983 action did not purport to gain remedies \n10  unavailable under Title IX, but instead sought to enforce distinct and independent substantive due process rights.)  \n11  The holdings of these Circuit Courts are further supported by the fact that there is no evidence of \n12  Congressional intent to make Title IX the exclusive or even a comprehensive remedy for a plaintiff asserting a claim \n13  of discrimination based on gender.  As the Eighth Circuit held in finding that plaintiff was entitled to pursue her \n14  Title IX claim both independently and under § 1983: \n \n15  To the extent that [plaintiff’s] § 1983 claims are based on alleged violations of Title IX, we find \nunpersuasive the defendants' argument that Title IX contains a “sufficiently comprehensive” remedial \n16 \nscheme. The only enforcement mechanism that Title IX expressly provides is a procedure to terminate \nfederal support to institutions that violate Title IX. See 20 U.S.C. § 1682; see also Cannon v. Univ. of  \n17 \nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 683, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1950, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). This is a far cry from the \n18  “unusually elaborate enforcement provisions” of the statutes at issue in Sea Clammers, 453 U.S. at 13, 101 \nS.Ct. at 2622, which expressly provided for citizen suits and enforcement by government agencies. By \n19  holding that Title IX contains not only an implied private right of action, Cannon, 441 U.S. at 709, 99 S.Ct. \nat 1964, but also a damages remedy, Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 76, 112 S.Ct. \n20 \n1028, 1038, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992), moreover, the Supreme Court has indicated that the sole express \nenforcement mechanism contained in Title IX is not exclusive. We believe, therefore, that there is no \n21 \nevidence that Congress intended to foreclose the use of § 1983 to redress violations of Title IX.  Crawford, \n22  109 F.3d at 1284. \n23  Moreover, plaintiffs’ Title IX claims substantially differ from their claims under § 1983, in that courts have \n24  found violations of the equal protection clause but not Title IX.  See, e.g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, \n25  458 U.S. 718,  732-33 (1982) (striking down female-only nursing school policy under Equal Protection Clause, \n26  while noting that it might not violate Title IX). \n27  Further, the reasoning of the Circuits that reached the opposite conclusion is unpersuasive.  Each of those \n28 \n14 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 22 of 29\n \n1  cases reads Sea Clammers as applying whenever a remedial scheme is available elsewhere.  See e.g, Bruneau ex rel. \n2  Schofield v. South Kortright Cent. School Dist. 163 F.3d 749, 758 (2nd Cir. 1998); Pfeiffer v. Marion Ctr. Area Sch. \n3  Dist., 917 F.2d 779, 789 (3d Cir.1990). 7  As Rancho Palos Verdes recently made plain, the proper inquiry is \n4  whether Congress intended the statutory scheme to be the only remedy available to plaintiff.  Rancho Palos Verdes, \n5  544 U.S. at 120.   Indeed, the Second Circuit noted in its analysis that “plaintiff had a constitutional right,” but then \n6  held that Title IX provides the exclusive remedy.  Bruneau, 163 F.3d at 758.  Title IX, however, does not provide a \n7  remedy for constitutional rights.  That is the province of § 1983.   \n \n8  E.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Pled a Violation of California Public Policy. \n \n9  1.  Plaintiffs Allege Multiple Sources of California’s Public Policy. \n \n10 \nDefendants improperly seek dismissal of plaintiffs’ single public policy cause of action by addressing \n11 \nseparately each Constitutional or statutory provisions on which it is based and arguing, as to each, that it does not \n12 \nprovide a private right of action.   A Rule 12(c) motion must dispose of an entire cause of action.  See Moran, 825 F. \n13 \nSupp. at 893; In re Amica, Inc., 130 B.R. at 796.   \n14 \nFurther, it is not the specific statute or regulation that forms the basis for the tort, but the underlying policy \n15 \nreflected in it.  Green v. Ralee Eng’g Co., 19 Cal. 4th 66 (1998).  Courts have consistently upheld tort claims based \n16 \non California’s public policy against discrimination.  See, e.g., Stevenson v. Super. Ct., 16 Cal. 4th 880 (1997) (Fair \n17 \nEmployment and Housing Act declares a fundamental public policy against age discrimination); Rojo v. Kliger, 52 \n18 \nCal. 3d 65 (1990) (California Constitution (Art. 1, § 8) declares a fundamental public policy against sex \n19 \ndiscrimination).  Plaintiffs have pled allegations sufficient to satisfy the following requirements:   \n20   \nFirst, the policy must be supported by either constitutional or statutory provisions. Second, the policy must \n21  be “public” in the sense that it “inures to the benefit of the public” rather than serving merely the interests of \nthe individual. Third, the policy must have been articulated at the time of the discharge. Fourth, the policy \n22  must be “fundamental” and “substantial.”  \n \n23 \nStevenson, 16 Cal. 4th at 890.   \n24 \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint provides two sources of public policy—California Constitution and Education Code—\n25 \nand both of these sources meets the prerequisites set forth above.  As to each, plaintiffs make the necessary \n26 \n27                                                             \n7  Travis v. Folsom Cordova Unified Sch. Dist., 2007 U.S. Dist. Lexis 11566 (E.D. Cal. 2007) is inapposite.  There, the court considered \n28  whether Title VI subsumed a sec. 1983 claim based on Title VI, not based on the equal protection clause as is the case here.   \n15 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 23 of 29\n \n1  allegations described above. For instance, the Complaint cites to California Constitution Article 1, Section 7, which \n2  states “this amendment is necessary to serve compelling public interests.”  Id. at ¶ 183.  The Complaint also relies \n3  upon the Education Code, which states it is the intent of the Legislature that “opportunities for participation in \n4  athletics be provided equally to male and female pupils” and that “opportunities for participation in intercollegiate \n5  athletic programs. . . in the campuses of the University of California be provided on as equal a basis as is practicable \n6  to male and female students.”  Id. at ¶¶ 187, 189.  These statutes clearly establish the fundamental and substantial \n7  public policy against gender discrimination.   \n8  The Complaint further alleges that defendants violate public policy by treating male and female students \n9  differently by (1) failing to provide female students with equal athletic participation opportunities; (2) failing to \n10  provide female students with equal athletic financial assistance; and (3) providing male but not female students with \n11  participation opportunities in the sport of wrestling.”  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶ 196.   \n \n12  4.  Public Policy Torts Do Not Require That a Private Right of Action Exist in Constitutional \nor Statutory Provisions that Form the Basis of the Public Policy Tort.  \n13   \n14  Defendants’ argument that the sections of the Education Code and California Constitution on which \n15  plaintiffs rely for their public policy claim do not contain a private right of action is misdirected.  Because plaintiffs’ \n16  claim is a tort claim, not a statutory claim, it does not depend upon a showing that the Constitutional and statutory \n17  provisions from which the public policy emanates also authorize a private right of action.  When a legislative \n18  provision embodying a public policy is enacted for the protection of a particular class of persons, as is the case here, \n19  its violation may give rise to civil liability to an injured plaintiff who is a member of the class.  Hudson v. Craft, 33 \n20  Cal. 2d 654 (1949).   \n21  Even assuming a private right of action is necessary, plaintiffs have an implied right of action under the \n22  Education Code and the Constitution.  California courts have applied two separate but similar tests to imply a \n23  private right of action: (1) “legislative intent;” and (2) “Restatement 2d.”  See, e.g., Crusader Ins. Co. v. Scottsdale \n24  Ins. Co., 54 Cal. App. 4th 121 (1997).  Both tests consider factors such as whether a private right to sue is \n25  “appropriate” and “needed.”  Id.  It is clear from the language in the constitutional and statutory provisions \n26  California has created to prohibit gender discrimination that California law is intended to increase statewide \n27  compliance with Title IX, not simply to enact a toothless clone of the federal law.  The California Legislature \n28 \n16 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 24 of 29\n \n1  expressly stated with respect to the Education Code, that “[w]hile significant progress has been made since the \n2  passage of Title IX [of the Education Amendments] in 1972, the numbers indicate that female athletes are still not \n3  provided equal athletic opportunity at many high schools, colleges, and universities throughout the state.”  Section 1 \n4  of Stats. 2002, ch. 1060 (A.B. 2295), as amended by Stats. 2003, ch.62 (S.G. 600), § 345.  Therefore, a private right \n5  of action is appropriate and necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the law. \n \n6  5.  Defendants’ Private Right of Action Argument Is No More Availing When Made \nSpecifically on Behalf of the Individual Defendants. \n7 \nRelying principally on Reynolds v. Bement, 36 Cal. 4th 1075 (2005), defendants argue that, even where a \n8 \nprivate right of action is authorized, “there still remains the question” of whether individual agents or employees are \n9 \nliable “under that statute.”  Defs’ MPA, p. 16.  The very manner in which defendants phrase the argument reveals its \n10 \nflaws.  As stated above, plaintiffs’ claim for violation of public policy is a tort claim, based upon the important \n11 \npublic policy, against discrimination in education.  Accordingly, the question is not whether there is a private right \n12 \nof action for violation of a specific statute, but whether the defendants engaged in tortious conduct in violation of \n13 \npublic policy. \n14 \nMoreover, the individual defendants in Reynolds against whom the plaintiffs sought liability had not \n15 \nengaged in any actions themselves in violation of the statute in question.  They were merely officers, directors and \n16 \nshareholders of the corporate employer.  Plaintiff sought to impose individual liability for the employer’s wage and \n17 \nhour violations on such persons by virtue of their positions, rather than their conduct, based upon a broad definition \n18 \nof “employer” adopted by the Industrial Welfare Commission.  The Court rejected that definition as a basis for \n19 \nidentifying the scope of persons who would be individually liable under the statute.  At the same time, the Court \n20 \nacknowledged that “directors may be ‘jointly liable with the corporation and may be joined as defendants if they \n21 \npersonally directed or participated in the tortious conduct.’”  Reynolds, 36 Cal. 4th at 1089-90.  Here, the individual \n22 \ndefendants are not merely officers or agents of the Regents but are individuals who, were directly involved in and \n23 \nparticipated in the conduct which constituted the violation of public policy. \n24 \nNor does Thornburg v. Superior Court, 138 Cal. App. 4th 43 (2006) support defendant’s position.  That \n25 \ncase sought to establish statutory liability, not tort liability.  Moreover, the conduct at issue in Thornburg consisted \n26 \nof charging patients an excessive amount for copying medical records.  The court specifically found that the public \n27 \ninterest there was not so vital as to assume that the legislature intended to impose liability on every agent or \n28 \n17 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 25 of 29\n \n1  employee of the defendant.  Id. at 51.  Here, by contrast, the public interest in preventing gender based \n2  discrimination is fundamental and substantial. \n3  The only other case involving California public policy on which defendants rely for their argument that \n4  individuals cannot be held liable for violations of such policy is Reno v. Baird, 18 Cal. 4th 640, 660, 663 (1998), in \n5  which the Supreme Court held that individual supervisors are not liable for employment discrimination either under \n6  FEHA or violation of public policy.  Id. at 663.  However, the specific language of the statute limited liability for \n7  discrimination to an “employer” while imposing liability for retaliation and harassment on employers and other \n8  “persons.”  The Court found individual supervisors were not “employers” under FEHA for the purpose of \n9  discrimination claims.  It also determined that it would be incongruous to impose tort liability on a class of persons \n10  who the legislature excluded from statutory liability for the same conduct.  Id. at 650-51, 664.  This rationale is \n11  inapplicable here.  The law relied upon by plaintiffs for their public policy claim is silent as to who might not be \n12  liable.  Instead, it makes clear that it is a fundamental public policy of California that discrimination in education be \n13  eliminated and that “each Californian, regardless of ethnic origin, race, gender, age, disability, or economic \n14  circumstance” be given “a reasonable opportunity to develop fully his or her potential.”  There is no reason to \n15  believe that the tortious violation of this policy by an individual is any less egregious, or any less actionable, when \n16  engaged in by individuals than when engaged in by an institution.   \n17  F.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Requested Emotional Distress and Punitive Damages. \n18  Even when courts allow partial judgment on individual causes of action as opposed to an entire action, a \n19  prayer for relief is not considered part of the cause of action for purposes of testing the sufficiency of the pleading.  \n20  See 5 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1255 (3d ed. 2004); In re Amica, Inc., 130 B.R. at 796.  \n21  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ requested remedies of emotional distress damages and punitive damages under Title IX are \n22  not properly subject to dismissal on a Rule 12(c) motion. \n23  3.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Requested Emotional Distress Damages Under Title IX. \n24    Title IX provides plaintiffs with an implied private cause of action and entitles plaintiffs to compensatory \n25  damages, especially where, as here, there are allegations that the defendants’ discrimination was intentional.  \n26  Franklin, 503 U.S. 60.  The Supreme Court in Franklin set forth broad parameters of relief:  “where legal rights \n27 \n28 \n18 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 26 of 29\n \n1  have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may use \n2  any available remedy to make good the wrong done.”  Id. at 66.  \n3  Defendants’ argument that plaintiffs are not entitled to emotional distress damages because Title IX was \n4  enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause and therefore limited to contractual remedies is in error.  In Gebser v. Lago \n5  Vista Independent Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998) and Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629 (1999), \n6  the Supreme Court analyzed the scope of liability under Title IX and affirmed the availability of compensatory \n7  damages – which necessarily include emotional distress damages -- despite the fact that Title IX is partially derived \n8  from the Spending Clause.8  In both cases, the Court reasoned that Title IX described sexual harassment with \n9  sufficient clarity to provide adequate notice to school officials that they could be liable for this form of \n10  discrimination, thereby satisfying the notice requirement of Spending Clause legislation.  Here, plaintiffs’ \n11  allegations regarding their denial of Title IX opportunities directly track the language of Title IX, thereby placing \n12  defendants on notice of their potential liability.  Moreover, unlike back pay and other economic damages that are \n13  equitable in nature, see, e.g., Franklin, 503 U.S. at 1038, emotional distress damages are considered compensatory \n14  damages in the civil rights context.  Defendants concede this point in their reliance on Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. \n15  181, 187 (2002) which notes that under “Title IX, which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal funds is \n16  nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages….”  \n17  Defendants further concede that emotional distress damages are available even as a contractual remedy \n18  where serious emotional distress is a particularly likely result. Defs’ MPA at 11.  Emotional distress damages are \n19  also available in contract when the aggrieved party is subjected to more than economic damages.  State Farm Mut. \n20  Auto Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 426 (2003); Erlich v. Menezes, 21 Cal. 4th 543, 558-59 (1999). Plaintiffs \n21  allege that they experienced significant harm at the hands of defendants.  Olivier Decl., Exh. A, ¶¶ 120, 146.  \n22  Defendants contend that plaintiffs’ emotional distress was not severe enough to warrant compensation under a \n23  contractual analysis.  This is a factual dispute that cannot be decided on the pleadings. \n24  4.  Plaintiffs Have Properly Requested Punitive Damages Under Title IX. \n25  Defendants’ argument that punitive damages are not available under Title IX as a matter of law is incorrect.  \n26  At least one court has left open the possibility that punitive damages may be available under Title IX to serve public \n27 \n                                                           \n28  8  The Court in Franklin refused to reach the question of which congressional power was used to enact Title IX.  Id. at 75 n.8. \n19 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 27 of 29\n \n1  policy.  See Doe v. Oyster River Co-op. Sch. Dist., 992 F. Supp. 467, 483 (D.N.H. 1997).  Also, some courts have \n2  recognized that punitive damages awards are available under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 \n3  U.S.C. § 704, a statute whose enforcement regime, as well as legislative history, closely tracks that of Title IX.  See, \n4  e.g., Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ., 13 F.3d 823, 830-32 (4th Cir. 1994); Hernandez v. City of Hartford, 959 \n5  F.Supp. 125, 133-34 (D.Conn. 1997).  \n6  G.  The Individual Defendants Are Not Entitled to Immunity as a Matter of Law. \n7  Defendants argue that the actions of the individual defendants in this case involved “a discretionary, as \n8  opposed to a ministerial” decision, and that they are, therefore, immune from liability under California Government \n9  Code § 820.2.  The California Supreme Court has long established, however, that the issue of whether discretionary \n10  immunity applies requires a policy based analysis, based upon the underlying purpose of immunity, rather than a \n11  mechanical or literal approach of determining whether discretion was involved.  Johnson v. State, 69 Cal.2d 782, \n12  795 (1968).    \n13  The sole purpose of discretionary immunity is to prevent judicial inquiry into sensitive policy decisions of \n14  government employees that are best left to agencies other than the courts.  Johnson, 69 Cal. 2d at 795 n.8.  Thus, \n15  immunity only applies for those, “‘basic policy decisions [which have] . . . been [expressly] committed to coordinate \n16  branches of government,’ and as to which judicial interference would thus be ‘unseemly.’”  Caldwell v. Montoya, 10 \n17  Cal. 4th 972, 981 (1995).  The proper approach to determining whether discretionary immunity applies, therefore, \n18  requires that a court “find and isolate those areas of quasi-legislative policy-making which are sufficiently sensitive \n19  to justify a blanket rule that courts will not entertain a tort action alleging that careless conduct contributed to the \n20  governmental decision.”  Johnson, 69 Cal. 2d at 794.  “Accordingly, to be entitled to immunity the [defendant] must \n21  make a showing that such a policy decision, consciously balancing risks and advantages, took place.”  Id. at 795 n.8.  \n22  Defendants here concede that this is the proper standard. Defs’ MPA at 19. \n23  Defendants have made no such showing here and cannot do so.  The only support defendants offer for their \n24  argument that the individual defendants “consciously balanced risks and advantages” of any decision on which this \n25  action is based is the reference to a handful of allegations in the Complaint, none of which assert any facts regarding \n26  the process by which the defendants decided to take the actions they did against plaintiffs.  Based upon these \n27  allegations, including the fact that defendants’ conduct engendered media and legislative attention, and unspecified \n28 \n20 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 196    Filed 07/13/07   Page 28 of 29\n \n1  “evidence provided via judicial notice,” defendants urge this court to accept the remarkable conclusion that there is \n2  “no doubt that defendants made discretions decisions with respect to plaintiffs’ demands after much deliberation and \n3  in light of many external factors . . .”    That conclusion is mere wishful thinking on defendants’ part.  Nothing in the \n4  Complaint or in the materials submitted by defendants establishes that any conscious balancing of risks and \n5  advantages actually occurred.  Nor are defendants’ stated “ultimate facts and conclusions of law” sufficient to \n6  establish discretionary immunity.  Neary v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 185 Cal. App. 3d 1136, 1143 (1986); Runyon v. \n7  Super. Ct., 187 Cal. App. 3d. 878, 882 (1986).  Thus, simply asserting that defendants made decisions in light of \n8  external factors does not establish that their conduct was the result of a weighing of risks and advantages.    \n9  Additionally, even where a government employee’s actions involve complex decisions which require the \n10  exercise of skill and judgment, they do not enjoy discretionary immunity unless they constitute basic policy \n11  decisions rather than the implementation of a basic policy already formulated.  Barner v. Leeds, 24 Cal. 4th 676, 685 \n12  (2000).  In Barner, the Supreme Court noted that the scope of the discretionary act immunity “should be no greater \n13  than is required to give legislative and executive policymakers sufficient breathing space in which to perform their \n14  vital policymaking functions.” Id. at 685.  Thus, routine duties which are a part of the normal operations of the \n15  employee’s office or position are not discretionary, while basic policy decisions made at the planning stage of \n16  operations qualify employees for immunity.  Taylor v. Los Angeles Dep’t of Water & Power, 144 Cal. App. 4th \n17  1216, 1238-39 (2006).   \n18  Similarly, even where discretion, as that term is commonly used, is actually exercised, immunity under § \n19  820.2 does not apply unless such discretion in exercised in the context of a basic policy decision.  Barner, 24 Cal. \n20  4th at 685.   Here, defendants’ actions were ministerial in nature because they were contrary to the existing policies \n21  designed to promote equal opportunities for women in athletic programs.  Defendants’ actions were operational \n22  decisions, not part of the Regents’ “basic policy decisions” made at the “planning” stage, and they contravened \n23  existing policies established by the California Legislature through the California Education Code and Congress \n24  through Title IX.  They did not entail “quasi-legislative” determinations of any kind.  Accordingly, holding the \n25  individual defendants accountable for their tortious actions would not involve the type of judicial oversight that the \n26  Legislature feared in enacting § 820.2. \n27   \n28 \n21 \n  PLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS \nCASE NO.

INTRODUCTION \n2   This case is rooted in Defendant’s history, over more than thirty-five years, of failing to provide equal \n3 athletic opportunities to its female students, including Plaintiffs, as required by Title IX of the Education \n4 Amendments of 1972.  Despite a continuing and steady growth of women’s interest in sports over this period of \n5 time, Defendant, the Regents of the University of California (“UCD”), continually and repeatedly refused to “fully \n6 and effectively accommodate” that interest as contemplated by Title IX.1  For Plaintiffs in particular, this case is \n7 about UCD’s denial of their opportunity to participate in women’s wrestling — an opportunity that existed for years \n8 for women at UCD, then was arbitrarily ripped away from them and never restored. 2   \n9 In an effort to justify its actions, conceal its otherwise clear liability for violations of Title IX, and make a \n10 case for summary judgment, UCD has attempted to recast the history of women’s wrestling and mischaracterize the \n11 status of Plaintiffs and other women wrestlers.  In the face of persuasive evidence to the contrary, it contends that \n12 there never was a women’s wrestling program at UCD, that the plaintiffs and other female wrestlers were not varsity \n13 athletes and that they were merely practicing with the men’s wrestling team.  UCD also contends that the \n14 elimination and continued denial of existing opportunities for women to participate in varsity wrestling at UCD was \n15 merely the result of the inability of the plaintiffs to beat male wrestlers, despite evidence that these unprecedented \n16 competitions for positions on the “team” were required by newly imposed pretextual “roster caps” and governed by \n17 men’s rules rather than women’s freestyle rules.       \n18\n                                                           \n1 The Regents shall be referred to as “UCD” because the events of this case took place on the campus of the \n19\nUniversity of California at Davis. \n2 UCD also attempts to miscast the scope of this motion.  This mischaracterization of the scope of the motion is in \n20\nerror and cannot save UCD’s motion from its substantial defects.  First, although the Court previously found that \nPlaintiffs’ unequal treatment claim under Title IX is time-barred, it does not follow that UCD’s actions in removing \n21\nPlaintiffs from the varsity wrestling program, refusing their request for reinstatement, and forcing all women to \nwrestle against men to earn a varsity wrestling position are irrelevant.  To the contrary, each of these actions \n22\ncontributed to UCD’s ongoing failure to fully and effectively accommodate its women athletes, as Title IX requires.  \nAs such, it is proper for the Court to consider them with respect to Plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claim.  \n23\nIndeed, one wonders why UCD would focus so much of its efforts on claiming its version of facts around these \nevents are “material” if they cannot be considered at all. Second, UCD incorrectly contends that Plaintiffs’ \n24\nineffective accommodation claim is cabined by this Court’s statement in denying UCD’s motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings that Plaintiffs “were able and ready to wrestle at UCD and that sufficient interest existed in the female \n25\nstudent population at UCD to field a women’s wrestling team.”  (Def’s MPA at 3.)  This statement was simply the \nbasis for Plaintiffs’ standing to assert an ineffective accommodation claim, not the legal basis for such a claim.  As \n26\nUCD admits, in order to demonstrate compliance with Title IX, it must demonstrate compliance with at least one of \nthe Three Prongs.  Even still, UCD may be found to violate Title IX in circumstances such as these where it \n27\neliminated women’s varsity opportunities in a contact sport.   \n \n28\n1 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 9 of 47\n \n1 UCD’s position not only affirms its disregard for the fundamental civil rights of its students, it highlights the \n2 fundamental disputes of genuine material facts at issue in this case.  At the macro level, such material facts include \n3 the foundational factual issues alluded to above, i.e. whether UCD had an existing varsity women’s wrestling \n4 program in which women were considered varsity athletes, whether UCD eliminated that program and the \n5 opportunities for women to participate in varsity sports that went with it, and whether UCD used roster caps and the \n6 requirement that women compete against men, using men’s rules, as pretext for eliminating these opportunities.  \n7 Other fundamental and disputed material facts determinative of UCD’s Title IX liability in this case include the \n8 question of whether UCD expanded or reduced the number of opportunities for women to participate in varsity \n9 sports during the relevant time period, whether UCD had a demonstrated history and continuing practice of \n10 expanding opportunities for women, and, assuming it did, whether such practice was demonstrably responsive to \n11 student interest and abilities. \n12 These are a mere sampling of the material issues of fact in this case, of which there are hundreds, which \n13 preclude summary judgment.  Separate and apart from these disputed material issues of fact, there are many \n14 undisputed issues of fact which, when the law is properly applied, preclude summary judgment.  For example, it is \n15 undisputed that the actual number of women athletes today is less than what it was in 1999, even though over 2,200 \n16 more women students attend UCD today than in 1999.  Yet UCD contends that it has a history of continuing \n17 expansion of athletic opportunities for women, based upon an analysis that only looks at the addition of teams (as \n18 opposed to actual opportunities) since 1996 and then gives itself “credit” for adding three teams at once, despite the \n19 fact that such additions still left UCD far below proportionality and failed to represent an overall expansion of \n20 opportunities over time.   \n21 UCD’s motion for summary judgment must also be denied because the legal arguments on which it \n22 depends are flawed and do not entitle UCD to judgment as a matter of law.  It invents a new and unfounded \n23 argument about “intentional discrimination” that is simply legally erroneous.  Likewise, in an apparent effort to \n24 confuse the Court, it raises the completely inapplicable and legally unsupportable argument that it has not been on \n25 “notice” of its obligations under a law to which it must agree to comply in order to receive its substantial federal \n26 funds.  For these, and all of the reasons set forth herein, UCD’s motion for summary judgment should be denied. \n27 // \n28\n2 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 10 of 47\n \n1 II.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n2 Each of UCD’s contentions that it is entitled to summary judgment is without merit.  The principal measure \n3 to guide the Court’s analysis of UCD’s conduct is referred to as the Three- Pronged Test promulgated in 1979 by the \n4 Office of Civil Rights as a policy interpretation of Title IX and embraced by courts as a basis for evaluating \n5 compliance.  UCD must (1) provide female student athletic opportunities that are substantially proportionate to their \n6 enrollment; or (2) demonstrate a history and continuing practice of expanding opportunities for women that is \n7 demonstrably responsive to student interest and abilities; or (3) fully and effectively accommodate the interest and \n8 abilities of its students.  Applying this analysis and considering the additional arguments that UCD makes in support \n9 of its motion, it is clear that summary judgment must be denied. \n10 First, UCD admits utter failure with respect to Prongs One and Three.  Specifically, UCD has been short of \n11 substantial proportionality by over a hundred varsity slots each year for more than thirty years.  Rather than \n12 effectively and fully accommodating the interest of female students in athletics, UCD has rejected varsity \n13 applications from hundreds of women club team members since 1995 alone.   \n14 Second, UCD instead contends that it has satisfied Prong Two by having a history and continuing practice \n15 of expanding female participation opportunities that has been demonstrably responsive to the interest and abilities of \n16 female students.  The evidence belies this assertion and compels the denial of this motion.  Moreover, despite \n17 exhaustive research of court filings and OCR letters of findings, Plaintiffs’ counsel are not aware of a single instance \n18 in which a college has successfully used a Prong Two defense.  To the contrary, the defense is routinely rejected as a \n19 last ditch attempt to claim compliance when actual discrimination is facially apparent under Prong One and when \n20 many females who have been denied opportunities for years  have the interest and ability to participate under Prong \n21 Three. \n22 Compliance with Prong Two requires expansion of actual female participation opportunities.  Thus, UCD’s \n23 reliance on a increase in the relative percentage of women in the Athletic Department, or its purported addition of \n24 teams (as opposed to actual participation opportunities) is not determinative here where undisputed evidence in this \n25 case establishes that:  (1) from 1976 to 1996, UCD did not expand female opportunities at all; and (2) from 1998-\n26 2005, a period during which UCD’s female enrollment increased by 2,200 students, UCD dropped over 60 female \n27 participation opportunities, enough to field several women’s varsity teams.  UCD did nothing to replace these \n28\n3 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 11 of 47\n \n1 opportunities much less expand opportunities during this period.  By 2005, UCD’s participation numbers were at \n2 their lowest point since 1997.  UCD added women’s golf in 2005 when prompted by this litigation.  However, this \n3 addition did not replace eliminated female opportunities and was not responsive to developing interest and ability of \n4 women’s club teams at UCD.  These facts alone warrant the denial of UCD’s motion in its entirety. \n5 Third, UCD’s elimination of Plaintiffs’ existing female wrestling varsity opportunities at a time where it did \n6 not satisfy any of the three prongs is a further violation of Title IX.  UCD’s motion rests primarily on the false \n7 premise that Plaintiffs’ positions were not opportunities for women but that they were members of a men’s team and \n8 that they ultimately were not skilled enough to remain on the roster.   This assumption is contested with an \n9 abundance of evidence that establishes that the Plaintiffs were participating as varsity athletes against other women \n10 using women’s rules.  UCD’s imposition of the impossible requirement that the women wrestlers compete against \n11 men to remain on the team resulted in the elimination of the women’s program in its entirety.  This evidence further \n12 supports the denial of the motion.   \n13 Fourth, summary judgment must be denied on the additional ground that UCD was required to create a new \n14 women’s varsity team even if none previously existed.   Where an institution has a male team in a contact sport, it \n15 must offer also a separate women’s team where there is sufficient ability and interest to sustain a team, and a \n16 reasonable expectation of competition.  Plaintiffs present sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact with \n17 respect to all three of these requirements to survive summary judgment.   \n18 Fifth, UCD’s contention that summary judgment is proper because it did not “intentionally” discriminate \n19 against Plaintiffs misconstrues the intent requirement for Title IX.  Plaintiffs need not prove that UCD specifically \n20 intended to violate Title IX, but only that UCD meant to treat its female wrestlers and other female athletes as it did.  \n21 Evidence establishes that UCD intended to limit the offerings of women’s sports as it did and it intended to eliminate \n22 the women’s wrestling program.  This is sufficient to prove intentional discrimination under equal accommodation \n23 precedent.  At the very least, the evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact.    \n24 Sixth, UCD’s argument that Plaintiffs did not provide proper notice under Title IX of UCD’s program-wide \n25 failure to provide equal opportunities is legally untenable and, alternatively, factually disputed.

UCD’s Athletic Program. \n7 Defendant, the Regents of the University of California, is charged with overseeing the administration and \n8 operation of the University of California at Davis, including its athletics program.  (Plaintiffs’ Statement of \n9 Additional Disputed Facts In Support of Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Defendant’s Motion For Summary Judgment \n10 (“ADF”) 1.)  As an institution that receives federal funds, UCD is subject to Title IX’s requirement that it provide \n11 equal athletic opportunities to its female athletes.  (ADF 2.)  Plaintiffs are former UCD students who wrestled in \n12 high school and attended UCD, in large part, to wrestle.  (ADF 3.)  In 2000, UCD ordered that all women be \n13 removed from the wrestling program solely on the basis of their gender.  (ADF 4.)  UCD’s elimination of Plaintiffs’ \n14 varsity wrestling opportunities occurred against the backdrop of UCD’s long and continuous history of failing to \n15 provide adequate athletic opportunities for its female students.   \n \n16 1.  UCD’s Failure to Provide Women’s Athletic Opportunities Proportionate to \nWomen’s Enrollment. \n17  \n18 Prong One of OCR’s Title IX equal accommodation test requires that the provision of opportunities for \n19 females be equal to their enrollment.  Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972; a Policy Interpretation; Title \n20 IX and Intercollegiate Athletics, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,418 (1979) (hereinafter “Policy Interpretation”), a version \n21 of which is attached as Exh. A to Def’s Appendix of Title IX Clarifications Cited In Support of MSJ.  Despite \n22 decades of warnings about its failure to comply with Title IX, UCD has never provided females with athletic \n23 opportunities that are substantially proportionate to their enrollment.  (ADF 6.)  UCD admits this fact.  (ADF 5.)   \n24 2.  UCD’s Failure To Expand Participation Opportunities For Women Athletes \n25 Prong Two requires an institution to demonstrate a history and current practice of expansion of participation \n26 opportunities for women.  Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, 71,418.  Since the passage of Title IX, UCD \n27 has failed to expand female participation opportunities.  (ADF 17, 27.)   \n28\n5 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 13 of 47\n \n1 Between 1971 and 1996, UCD failed to expand athletic opportunities for women whatsoever.  (ADF 17.)  \n2 In 1976, UCD produced a report showing serious deficiencies in Title IX compliance.  (ADF 7.)  Between 1976 and \n3 1991, UCD took no steps to review its compliance with Title IX.  (ADF 8.)   In fact, UCD drastically eliminated \n4 opportunities during this time when the participation of women athletes was reduced by nearly 100 opportunities \n5 between 1989 and 1991.  (ADF 18.)  UCD also dropped women’s golf and field hockey during this time period.  \n6 (ADF 19.)3   \n7   Then in 1991, UCD issued a report by a committee instituted to study compliance with Title IX in UCD \n8 athletics (“UCD 1991 Title IX Report”).  (ADF 9.)  The Report warned of “resistance within the Athletic \n9 Department to UC Davis’s efforts to ensure total compliance with Title IX …”  (ADF 9.)  The Report also revealed \n10 that “participation by females [in varsity athletics] is clearly not substantially proportionate to their enrollment” at \n11 UCD.  (ADF 9.)   \n12 UCD administrators and staff continued to warned about a lack of compliance and falling  female \n13 participation rates over the next ten years.  (ADF 11.)  Between 1991 and 2002, over fourteen Athletic Department \n14 memos, reports, and emails warn UCD about it serious and continuous backslides in the participation rates of \n15 women.  (ADF 11.)  Then in 1996, at a time when female participation rates were 20% lower than female \n16 enrollment, UCD added three women’s varsity teams.  (ADF 12, 21.)  Even so, the participation rates of women \n17 remained disproportionate to their enrollment by eleven percent, which translates to 184 varsity opportunities.  (ADF \n18 12.)   \n19 In 1997, UCD again stated:  “Total participation levels for men and female athletes are not substantially \n20 proportionate to the undergraduate population of the institution.  This suggests potential non-compliance with Title \n21 IX participation level requirements.”  (ADF 13.)  In 1998, Athletic Director Greg Warzecka acknowledged that a \n22 gender imbalance in the athletic department “is not a new issue.”  (ADF 14.)    \n23 In this litigation, UCD claims that it added women’s indoor track in the winter of 1999.  However, UCD \n24\n                                                           \n25 3  A former field hockey coach recalls the elimination:  “With a number of schools participating in our field hockey \nconference in this region during the 1980’s and beyond, our conference remained active and extremely competitive \n26\nat the national level. . . . Davis’ decision to discontinue its women’s field hockey team in 1983 in this competitive \nenvironment was very surprising to me and others in the conference.   Other schools in the conference were not \n27\ndiscontinuing their field hockey programs.”  (ADF 20.) \n \n28\n6 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 14 of 47\n \n1 treated indoor and outdoor track as a combined sport.  (ADF 23, 25.)  Moreover, the extension of the varsity track \n2 season to include indoor track did not add new opportunities for females because the same athletes who participated \n3 in outdoor track participated in the indoor season and, as UCD admits, it added the men’s indoor track season at the \n4 same time.  (ADF 25.)  As such, even if the additional season counted as a new opportunity, there was no expansion \n5 in the opportunities provided for females.  Further, UCD’s claim that it added indoor track as an additional sport \n6 does not exist in UCD gender equity documents generated prior to this litigation.  (ADF 26.)   \n7 Then in 2000, UCD removed all women, including Plaintiffs, from the varsity wrestling program, and \n8 denied their pleas, and the entreaties of their coach, for reinstatement.  (ADF 4, 68-67.)  Yet in November 2002, \n9 UCD admitted that the participation rates of its female athletes dropped further so that the participation rates of \n10 women remained disproportionate by nearly ten percent.  (ADF 15.)  Indeed, UCD’s Chief Title IX Compliance \n11 Officer admitted had a continuing concern about UCD’s female participation rates throughout his tenure and \n12 believed UCD should be doing more to achieve Title IX compliance, stating “we could and should be doing more.”  \n13 (ADF 16.)  In 2005, three years after this lawsuit was filed, UCD added women’s varsity golf, which added only \n14 seven opportunities for women at UCD.  (ADF 22.)   \n15 The actual number of participation opportunities at UCD dropped between 1999-2005, a reduction that \n16 UCD’s expert agrees was “drastic.”  (ADF 29.)  As the below chart indicates, over time, UCD has in fact provided \n17 less, not more, opportunities for women athletes.

(See ADF 31.) \n28\n7 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 15 of 47\n \n2003-2004  11,660  55.9%  50.1%  -5.8%  371  373  102 \n1\n2004-2005  12,834  55.34%  50.25%  -5.1%  368  363  101 \n2\nAs the chart indicates, to reach proportionality, in any given year, UCD would have had to add at least 100 \n3\nadditional opportunities for women athletes.  (ADF 30.)  In addition, the actual number of women athletes has \n4\ndecreased, rather than increased.  (ADF 30.)  In the1998-1999 school year, 426 women were participating in varsity \n5\nathletics.  (ADF 27.)  By 2000-2001, the number had fallen to 407.  (ADF 27.)  In 2001-2002, the same year that \n6\nwomen’s varsity wrestling was eliminated, the number fell to 361.  (ADF 27.)  In 2002-2003, 389 women \n7\nparticipated in the varsity program.  (ADF 27.)  In 2003-2004, the number dropped again to 371 women \n8\nparticipants.  (ADF 27.)  In 2004-2005, the number dropped further to 363. (ADF 27.)  Thus, between 1999 and \n9\n2005, UCD dropped a total of 63 female participation opportunities from its athletic department, enough to field \n10\nseveral women’s varsity teams.  (ADF 32.)   \n11\nNotably, although the number of women athletes was decreasing, women student enrollment experienced \n12\nsignificant growth.  (ADF 30.)  In 1999-2000, 424 female athletes were participating, yet in 2004-2005, only 368 \n13\nfemale athletes were participating.  (ADF 30.)  During this same time period, however, UCD experienced an \n14\nincrease of over 2,200 women students.  (ADF 30.)  Further, evidence suggests that UCD's participation numbers \n15\nare artificially inflated.  (ADF 28.)  Thus, UCD claims improvement during a period in which the number of \n16\nparticipation opportunities for women actually declined.  (ADF 29.) \n17\nUCD excuses its drastic drop in participation opportunities by contending they resulted in part from the \n18\nelimination of “B” teams in varsity lacrosse and water polo.  UCD presents no evidence to support the contention \n19\nthat the lacrosse slots eliminated were B team slots and UCD concedes that it dropped the varsity water polo B \n20\nteams to club status despite the existence of competition.  (ADF 33.)  At the same time it eliminated these varsity \n21\nopportunities, UCD further reduced the varsity opportunities for females by eliminating opportunities for women \n22\nwrestlers, despite their proven interest in participation.  (ADF 4, 74.) \n23\nUCD knew about this significant reduction, but did not replace the eliminated participation opportunities or \n24\nexpand opportunities during this time period.  (ADF 34, 35.)  In 2003, UCD solicited applications for varsity \n25\napplications and received strong applications from five existing club teams.  (ADF 36.)  UCD rejected each of these \n26\nrequests for elevation to varsity status, and instead selected golf.  (ADF 37.)  There was no existing women’s club \n27\nteam and unlike all of the other applications, the golf application was actually completed by the UCD administration, \n28\n8 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

It required a full year of off-campus recruitment before it could field a \n2 golf team.  (ADF 38, 39.)  Although UCD claimed that golf was selected to comply with a Big West Conference \n3 rule, that selection criterion was never communicated to applicants for varsity status.  (ADF 38.)  Golf added only \n4 seven opportunities for women athletes, whereas any of the other pre-existing club teams that applied for varsity \n5 status would have added considerably more participation opportunities.  (ADF 22, 40.) \n6 UCD’s expert opined that Title IX requires institutions set forth a specific timetable for Title IX compliance.  \n7 (ADF 41.)  The purported equity plans to which it points largely contain warnings about non-compliance, not \n8 specific timetables or plans for increasing women’s athletic opportunities.  (ADF 41.)   \n \n9 3.  UCD’s Refusal to Fully and Effectively Accommodate the Interests and Abilities of \nIts Female Students. \n10  \n11 If an institution does not provide substantially proportionate athletic opportunities and cannot demonstrate a \n12 history and continuing practice of expansion, its last resort is to argue that it fully and effectively accommodates the \n13 interest and abilities of its female students (“Prong Three”).  Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418.  UCD \n14 admits that it has not accomplished this at all times relevant to this case.  (ADF 42.)  In 1991, UCD was urged to \n15 conduct a survey of its students to determine the interest and ability of women in varsity athletics.  (ADF 6.)  UCD \n16 waited 13 years to do so.  (ADF 43.)  In 1996, UCD denied requests by the women’s badminton and field hockey \n17 club teams to be elevated to varsity status.  (ADF 44.) \n18 Even as its female participation opportunities spiraled downward, UCD did not elevate any teams to varsity \n19 status.  Between 1995 and 2003, UCD did not even communicate to female students that they could seek the \n20 addition of a new women’s varsity sport, or the process for doing so.  (ADF 45.)  Nor did UCD did make any effort \n21 to survey student interest and ability on campus, or to consider the addition of another women’s team, until after \n22 Plaintiffs’ complaint of discrimination was filed and after the participation rates of its female athletes had plunged.  \n23 (ADF 43, 41.) \n24 In 2003, UCD received applications for elevation to varsity status from existing women’s club teams in field \n25 hockey, rugby, equestrian, bowling, and badminton which demonstrated strong interest in the sports and a high level \n26 of ability in its club athletes.  (ADF 36.)  The applications also confirmed competitive opportunities at the varsity \n27 level.  (ADF 36.)  UCD rejected these applications despite its failure to achieve substantial proportionality.  (ADF \n28\n9 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

UCD’s Elimination of Existing Women’s Wrestling Varsity Opportunities. \n \n3 1.  The Elimination of the Women’s Wrestling Program After a Decade of Women’s \nVarsity Wrestling at UCD.  \n4  \n5 Since 1992, when women first began wrestling at UCD, the varsity wrestling program included both men \n6 and women, each competing against their respective sex.  (ADF 46, 49.)  Women wrestlers at UCD received highly \n7 qualified coaching, wrestled using women’s freestyle rules rather than men’s collegiate rules, and received all of the \n8 benefits of varsity status.  (ADF 49, 50.)  UCD sponsored a women’s division in its annual Aggie Open wrestling \n9 tournament.  (ADF 51.)   \n10 In 1995, UCD hired Michael Burch as a wrestling coach.  (ADF 47.)  Burch was interviewed for the job by \n11 a panel that included a Afsoon Johnston, a female wrestler at UCD.  (ADF 47.)  Johnston asked Burch during his \n12 UCD interview whether he would be supportive of women’s wrestling; he assured the panel that he would be.  \n13 (ADF 47.)  Women continued to wrestle at UCD as varsity athletes under the coaching of Burch throughout his \n14 tenure.  (ADF 48.)  As members of the team, women wrestlers attended practice regularly and had the same \n15 responsibilities as any other team member.  (ADF 52.)  They received coaching and attention unique to the needs of \n16 women wrestlers.  (ADF 50.) \n17 There was thus a women’s varsity wrestling program at UCD.  (ADF 53.)  Women wrestlers received \n18 benefits attendant to varsity status, including lockers, training services, academic support services, laundry services, \n19 and varsity coaching.  (ADF 54.)  Club sports athletes do not receive any of these benefits.  (ADF 54.)  The women \n20 wrestlers were listed as varsity athletes on participation lists, roster lists, and in the Aggie Open programs.  (ADF \n21 55.)  They also attended the end of the year team banquet and received honors from the coach.  (ADF 56.)  The \n22 NCAA certification paperwork, not required of club athletes, was required of the women wrestlers.  (ADF 57.)  \n23 Further, UCD admits that Plaintiffs were varsity athletes.  (ADF 58.)  Athletic Director Greg Warzecka testified that \n24 women were varsity athletes on the wrestling roster.  (ADF 59.)   \n25 2.  Plaintiffs Attendance at UCD With the Desire and Intent to Wrestle. \n26 Plaintiffs Christine Ng, Arezou Mansourian, and Lauren Mancuso came to UCD to contribute to this strong \n27 tradition of women’s wrestling at UCD.  (ADF 3.)  Plaintiff Ng was a high school wrestler who selected Davis \n28\n10 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

She entered Davis in 1998 and participated in the \n2 wrestling program each year until UCD eliminated the women’s wrestling program.  (ADF 60.)  She attended \n3 practice six days a week, received benefits as a varsity team member, and considered herself part of the team.  (ADF \n4 61.) \n5 Plaintiff Mansourian was also a competitive high school wrestler.  (ADF 62.)  She received early acceptance \n6 into a prestigious program at UC Riverside that would have put her on track for acceptance at medical school.  (ADF \n7 62.)  She chose not to attend that UC Riverside because it did not have a wrestling program, instead attending UCD \n8 because she would have the opportunity to wrestle.  (ADF 62.)  Mansourian was a dedicated team member as a \n9 freshman in 2000.  (ADF 63.)  She received the benefits of varsity team membership, including medical assistance \n10 from trainers when she was injured.  (ADF 63.) \n11 Plaintiff Mancuso choose to attend UCD because it afforded her the opportunity to continue wrestling.  \n12 (ADF 64.)  She was a highly-skilled wrestler in high school who planned to train for the Olympic team.  (ADF 65.)  \n13 Prior to coming to UCD in 2001, she was aware of the controversy about women’s wrestling, but understood that \n14 the women had been reinstated on the team.  (ADF 66.)  She thought that reinstatement meant that women were \n15 allowed to wrestle as they had previously, against other women.  (ADF 66.)  She entered in 2001 and attended \n16 practices in the fall of 2001 along with Ng and Mansourian.  (ADF 67.)  However, when she was forced to wrestle-\n17 off against a man in order to participate on the team, she was cut from the wrestling program.  (ADF 67.)   \n18 3.    UCD’s Removal Women Wrestlers From the Varsity Wrestling Program.  \n19 In October 2000, the UCD athletic department administration instructed Burch to remove the women from \n20 the wrestling team.  (ADF 68.)  Although Burch objected to the athletic department, he informed the women \n21 wrestlers of the athletic department’s directive.  (ADF 68.)  Burch permitted the women to continue to practice with \n22 the wrestling team.  (ADF 68.)  Mansourian was injured during a wrestling practice in January 2001 and sought \n23 assistance from a varsity trainer.  (ADF 69.)  When the administration learned of Mansourian’s use of this varsity \n24 benefit, the Athletic Director met with the women wrestlers and directed them not to participate in wrestling.  (ADF \n25 70.)  He also told them could not participate on the wrestling team because they were a liability to the university.  \n26 (ADF 71.) \n27 UCD eliminated women’s varsity wrestling despite evidence of great interest and ability in the sport, and a \n28\n11 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

The strongest indicator of interest was already present at UCD:  \n2 women were participating on the team and competing in open events.  (ADF 72.)  Coach Burch testified that he \n3 could have easily recruited enough women to field several women’s varsity teams.  (ADF 72.) \n4 Numerous individuals, including coaches and tournament organizers, with knowledge of the participation \n5 rates of high school women in wrestling agree that there was sufficient interest to field a collegiate team in 2001.  \n6 (ADF 73.)  Pacific University in Oregon started its varsity women’s wrestling team in 2002 and has competed each \n7 year since then with a full varsity schedule.  (ADF 74.)  Additionally, ample intercollegiate competition for women’s \n8 wrestling existed throughout UCD’s competitive regions with over 40 colleges and universities fielding varsity \n9 women programs or wrestlers.  (ADF 73.)  Despite this interest, ability, and available competition for women \n10 wrestlers, UCD admits that it did not consider interest in women’s wrestling before it directed the removal of \n11 women from the program.  (ADF 75.) \n12 In the spring of 2001, as the decision by UCD to eliminate women’s wrestling became public knowledge, \n13 there was a strong public backlash.  (ADF 76.)  Assemblywoman Helen Thomson threatened to withhold a \n14 significant source of funding on a UCD building, a protest was held at UCD’s annual Aggie Auction fundraiser, \n15 flyers and petition were distributed, both campus and statewide newspapers published news articles, and UCD’s \n16 administration received emails from concerned alumni.  (ADF 76.) \n17 In April 2001, Ng and Mansourian submitted a complaint of sex discrimination with the Department of \n18 Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  (ADF 77.)  They charged they had been subject to gender \n19 discrimination due to the elimination of intercollegiate athletic opportunities for women.  (ADF 77.)  Subsequently, \n20 Ng, Mancuso and Mansourian filed supplemental complaints of sex discrimination with OCR.  (ADF 77.)  Each of \n21 the complaints was based on the UCD’s acts of sex discrimination in violation of Title IX.  (ADF 77.) \n22 After the OCR complaints were filed, OCR never interviewed a single plaintiff, or any other women \n23 wrestler.  (ADF 78.)  Similarly, UCD’s Chief Title IX Compliance Officer, Dennis Shimek, admits that the UCD \n24 did not investigate the Plaintiffs’ complaints.  (ADF 79.)  Nor did Shimek even speak to any of the Plaintiffs.  (ADF \n25 79.)  As UCD acknowledges, the OCR investigation examined UCD’s compliance with Title IX as a whole, not \n26 solely its elimination of women’s wrestling.  (ADF 80.)  At this same time, soon after the OCR complaints were \n27 filed, UCD fired Burch for his support of women’s wrestling.  (ADF 81.)   \n28\n12 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 20 of 47\n \n1 It was in this context that UCD posed and OCR accepted a “voluntary resolution” of Plaintiffs’ OCR \n2 complaints.  (ADF 82.)  With this “voluntary resolution plan” UCD agreed to reinstate the women on the team as a \n3 resolution of Plaintiffs’ complaints.  (ADF 82.)  However, the plan conditioned reinstatement on Plaintiffs’ ability to \n4 compete against men for slot in the program, a condition that had never previously existed for their participation in \n5 the varsity program where they had competed against women.  (ADF 83.)  Significantly, UCD did not advise OCR \n6 that the women wrestlers had previously only competed against other women.  (ADF 84.) \n7 In May 2001, UCD reinstated the women to the team by placing them on the roster list.  (ADF 85.)  The \n8 reinstatement occurred after the 2000-2001 wrestling season was over and there were no opportunities for the \n9 women to participate.  (ADF 85.)  UCD’s purported reason for requiring the women to wrestle-off against the men \n10 was because the places on the team were limited by roster caps.  (ADF 86.)  Plaintiffs inquired whether, as females, \n11 they would have to comply with a roster cap intended to limit the number of men participating in order to move \n12 toward gender equity.  (ADF 87.)  The women were told that they would have to comply with the male roster caps.  \n13 (ADF 87.)  UCD’s expert testified that forcing women in a women’s program to be counted within a roster cap for \n14 the men’s team and to compete against men to be on the team is the effective elimination of the women’s program.  \n15 (ADF 88.)  Other than UCD’s women wrestlers, roster caps have not been applied to any women’s team at UCD.  \n16 (ADF 89.)   \n17 In the fall of 2001, Mansourian, Ng and Mancuso attended wrestling practices with the team.  At the \n18 practices Coach Zalesky was hostile to the women and did not provide them with any coaching, tips, or support.  \n19 (ADF 90, 91.)  Feeling unwelcome and humiliated, Mansourian stopped attending practices.  (ADF 92.)  Ng \n20 wrestled off against Mancuso, who beat her.  (ADF 93.)  Mancuso then wrestled off against a male wrestler, who \n21 beat her.  (ADF 93.)  Ng and Mancuso were not allowed to participate in the program.  (ADF 93.) \n22 Plaintiffs Mansourian, Ng and Manscuso were devastated by their dismissal from varsity wrestling.  All \n23 struggled with their remaining years at UCD without wrestling.  (ADF 94.)  Though Plaintiffs filed suit and \n24 requested reinstatement of the women’s wrestling program, UCD continues to refuse to provide wrestling \n25 opportunities to women, even though high schools girls from throughout the state continue to inquire about \n26 wrestling opportunities at UCD.

UCD Has Not Met the High Standard That Limits Summary Judgment.  \n3 UCD has not met its burden on summary judgment to establish that no genuine issue of material fact exists \n4 as to whether they provided equal accommodation in athletics to female students as required by law.  Federal Rule \n5 of Civil Procedure 56(c) states that summary judgment may be rendered only if  \n \n6 the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the \naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \n7 party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \n8 All such evidence submitted must be interpreted in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties (here, \n9 plaintiffs Mansourian, Ng and Mancuso).  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Gammoh v. \n10 City of La Habra, 395 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2005).   All evidence submitted on their behalf must be believed \n11 and all justifiable inferences must be drawn in their favor.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., \n12 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); Easter v. American West Fi., 381 F.3d 948, 949, 960 (9th Cir. 2004).  The nonmoving \n13 party need not produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial in order to avoid summary judgment.  \n14 Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986).  Unlike the non-moving party, evidence submitted by the \n15 moving party that would be inadmissible at trial may not be considered on a motion for summary judgment.  \n16 Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., 509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir. 2007); Orr v. Bank of Am. NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, \n17 773 (9th Cir. 2002).   \n18 All “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences are \n19 jury functions, “not suitable for resolution or summary judgment.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255; Soremekun, 509 F.3d \n20 at 984; T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pac. Elec. Contractors Ass’n, 809 F.2d 626, 630 (9th Cir. 1987).  At this stage, a \n21 court must not weigh the evidence or decide the truth of the matter, but rather, determine whether there is a genuine \n22 dispute for a jury to decide at trial.  Lyons v. England, 307 F.3d 1092, 1117 (9th Cir. 2002) (citing Glenn K. Jackson \n23 Inc. v. Roe, 273 F.3d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir. 2001)).  “[T]he issue of material fact required by Rule 56(c) . . . to entitle a \n24 party to proceed to trial is not required to be resolved conclusively in favor of the party asserting its existence; rather, \n25 all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or a \n26 judge to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial.”  First Nat’l Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Serv. Co., 391 \n27 U.S. 253, 288-89 (1968); T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc., 809 F.2d at 630.   \n28\n14 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970);  see also Nissan Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., \n3 210 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir. 2000) (noting that the moving party has the “initial burden of production and the \n4 ultimate burden of persuasion on a motion for summary judgment”).  As set forth below, UCD cannot carry this \n5 burden.   \n \n6 B.  The Evidence Establishes That Disputed and Undisputed Facts Exist Which Support a \nFinding That UCD Discriminates Against Female Athletes in Violation of Title IX, Making \n7 Summary Judgment Improper. \n \n8 1.  The Legal Framework for Evaluating Effective Accommodation Claims Under Title \nIX. \n9\nPlaintiffs’ claim arises under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. section 1681 et \n10\nseq.), which provides in part:   \n11  \nNo person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be \n12 denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity \nreceiving federal financial assistance . . . . \n13\n20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). \n14\nTitle IX prohibits sex discrimination in the operation of any education program or activity, \n15\nincluding intercollegiate athletics.  The regulations promulgated pursuant to Title IX require educational \n16\ninstitutions receiving federal funds to “provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes.”  34 \n17\nC.F.R. § 106.41(c) (emphasis added).  \n18\nThe critical factor in this case is “[w]hether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively \n19\naccommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes.”  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(c)(1).  It is well-established \n20\nthat “an institution may violate Title IX simply by failing to accommodate effectively the interests and abilities of \n21\nstudent athletes of both sexes.”  Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 828 (10th Cir. 1993); Cohen v. \n22\nBrown Univ. (Cohen II), 991 F.2d 888, 897-98 (1st Cir. 1993); Favia v. Ind. Univ. of Pa., (“Favia I”), 812 F. Supp. \n23\n578, 584-85 (W.D. Pa. 1993), aff’d, 7 F.3d 332 (3d Cir. 1993).   \n24\nIn 1979, the Department of Health, Education & Welfare’s Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) issued a Policy \n25\nInterpretation to provide further guidance on the meaning of equal athletic opportunity under an equal \n26\n27\n28\n15 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

The Policy Interpretation \n2 confirms that Title IX approaches the question of compliance on a programmatic rather than sport-specific basis.   \n3 Assessment is according to whether the institution’s “program as a whole” is satisfactory.  Id. at 71,422, App. B, \n4 Resp. to Add’l Comments (8).  Because of the historic discrimination against females in athletics, Title IX requires \n5 “continued affirmative steps” by institutions to achieve equity, which “‘in most cases . . . will entail development of \n6 athletic programs that substantially expand opportunities for women to participate and compete at all levels.’” \n7 Williams v. Sch. Dist. of Bethlehem, Pa., 998 F.2d 168, 176 (3d Cir. 1993) (quoting Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. \n8 Reg. 71,413, 71,414). \n \n9 2.  UCD Discriminated Against Female Students, Including Plaintiffs, By Failing All \nThree Prongs of Title IX’s Three Pronged Test for Measuring Equal \n10 Accommodation. \n \n11\nUCD has failed to provide female students including plaintiffs, with an equal opportunity to \n12\nparticipate in varsity athletics.  OCR’s 1979 Policy Interpretation sets forth a three-pronged test with respect \n13\nto such a claim, analyzing:  \n14  \n(1) Whether intercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are \n15 provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments; or \n \n16 (2) Where the members of one sex have been and are under-represented among intercollegiate \nathletes, whether the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion \n17 which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the members of that \nsex; or \n18  \n(3) Where the members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the \n19 institution cannot show a continuing practice of program expansion such as that cited above, \nwhether it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been \n20 fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.   \n \n21  \nPolicy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,418.  \n22\nIn evaluating Title IX effective accommodation claims, Courts have embraced and applied this three- \n23\npronged test and viewed it as a whole:  \n24\n \n25\n                                                           \n5 The Department of Education, acting through the OCR, is the administrative agency charged with administering \n26\nTitle IX.  Neal  v. Brd. of Ts., 198 F. 3d 763, 770 (9th Cir.1999) (citing Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844, 88 Stat. 612 [sic] \n(1974)).  The Policy Interpretation is a “considered interpretation” of the applicable regulations, and is entitled to \n27\ndeference by the courts. Id.; Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 896-97.   \n \n28\n16 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 24 of 47\n \nPut another way, Part (1) provides that if institutions have not distributed athletic opportunities in \n1 numbers ‘substantially proportionate’ to the gender composition of their student bodies, they have \npresumptively violated Title IX.  The rest of the test recognizes that there are circumstances under \n2 which, as a practical matter, something short of substantial proportionality will suffice to rebut the \npresumption that Title IX has been violated.   \n3\nNeal v. Bd. of Trs., No. CV-F-97-5009-REC-SMS, 1997 WL 1524813, at *9 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 26, 1997).   \n4\nPlaintiffs contend that they were entitled to the women’s wrestling opportunities taken from them because \n5\nUCD was not in compliance with Title IX under any of the three prongs.  As the evidence presented by the parties \n6\non this motion reveals, the merits of this claim, based upon the above-described basic Title IX law, depends upon \n7\ndisputed issues of material fact which preclude the entry of summary judgment. \n8  \na.  UCD Admits Its Failure to Satisfy Both Prong One and Prong Two of the \n9 Three-Pronged Test, Because It Has Neither Achieved Substantial \nProportionality Nor Effectively and Fully Accommodated Female Interest in \n10 Athletics.     \n11 UCD concedes that it cannot rely on Prongs One or Three of the three prong test as a basis for \n12 establishing compliance with Title IX in this case.  First, UCD admits, and the evidence establishes, that at \n13 all times relevant to this case, the participation rates of women in varsity athletics were short of substantial \n14 proportionality by hundreds of varsity slots.  (ADF 27.)  Indeed, in 2001-2002, the very year that UCD \n15 forced women to compete against men, UCD’s female participation proportionality rates fell to their worst \n16 level since 1997.  (ADF 27.)  UCD would have needed to add 156 varsity opportunities for women to make \n17 up for this proportionality shortfall.  (ADF 27.)  Thus, no claim can be made that Prong One’s \n18 proportionality test was satisfied.  \n19 Second, UCD also admits that it failed to fully and effectively the interest and ability of female \n20 students in varsity athletics in violation of Prong-Three.  (ADF 42.)  Hundreds of female students have \n21 sought varsity status at Davis, only to be rejected time and time again.  Importantly, UCD’s own admissions \n22 establish that the institution has known for decades that it does not accommodate the significant interest and \n23 ability of women in athletics.  (ADF 10.)   \n24 Thus, this motion turns on whether UCD has established, by evidence of undisputed material facts, \n25 that it was in compliance with Prong Two of the Three Prong test and is entitled to judgment as a matter of \n26 law.  As set forth below, UCD cannot establish as a matter of law that it satisfied Prong Two’s requirement \n27 of having a history and continuing practice of program expansion for women during the periods relevant to \n28\n17 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

To the \n2 contrary, undisputed and disputed facts support Plaintiffs’ contention that UCD failed to satisfy those \n3 requirements.  Summary judgment should be denied accordingly.   \n \n4 b.  UCD Did Not Satisfy the Requirements of Prong Two Because It Has Never \nHad A History And Continuing Practice Of Program Expansion For \n5 Women.  \n \n6\nThe intensely factual nature of a Prong Two analysis coupled with the significant disputes in \n7\nmaterial fact precludes summary judgment here.  Prong Two saves non-proportional schools from violation \n8\nif they can show “a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive \n9\nto the developing interest and abilities of the members of that sex.”  Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at \n10\n71,418 (emphasis added).  In 1996, OCR issued a clarification of the Three Part Test which provides, in \n11\npart:  “In effect, part two looks at an institution’s past and continuing remedial efforts to provide \n12\nnondiscriminatory participation opportunities through program expansion.”  OCR, Clarification of \n13\nIntercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance: The Three-Part Test (1996) (hereinafter “1996 OCR \n14\nClarification”), attached as Exh. B to Def.’s Appendix of Title IX Clarifications Cited in Support of MSJ \n15\n(“Title IX Appx.”), at 7.  Of paramount importance under Prong Two is not the addition of teams, but rather \n16\nwhether an institution has expanded actual participation opportunities for women.  “Part two focuses on \n17\nwhether an institution has expanded the number of intercollegiate participation opportunities provided to the \n18\nunderrepresented sex.”  1996 OCR Clarification (Title IX Appx., Exh. B) at 11, n.2  (see also, Plaintiffs’ \n19\nResponse to Defendant’s Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) 141, 148).  \n20\nThe Title IX experts on both sides of this case agree that an institution must expand actual \n21\nparticipation opportunities every two to three years to remain in compliance with Prong Two.6  (UMF 141.)  \n22\nBoth the OCR and the few courts that have looked at the Prong Two analysis have confirmed that it is a \n23\nfactually intensive analysis, which considers the number of students enrolled and the number of students \n24\nparticipating in athletics, as well as the developing interest and abilities of other students.  1996 OCR \n25\nClarification (Title IX Appx., Exh. B) at 7; Cohen v. Brown University (Cohen I), 809 F. Supp. 978, 981-82 \n26\n27\n                                                           \n6 Plaintiffs’ Title IX expert is Dr. Donna Lopiano.

Court decisions involving this issue have not defined the \n2 permissible outer limits of non-expansion under Prong Two, but have confirmed that periods of non-\n3 expansion in excess of nine years is too long.  Cohen I, 809 F. Supp. at 979-80, (court approval of \n4 preliminary injunction to stop elimination of team where no expansion from 1982 to 1991); Barrett v. West \n5 Chester Univ. of Pa., No. 03-CV-4978, 2003 WL 22803477, at *7 (E.D. Pa. 2003) (“periods in excess of a \n6 decade are too long to constitute continued expansion”).  Notably, Plaintiffs are unaware of any court \n7 decision affirming a Prong Two defense asserted by an institution. \n8 UCD bears the burden of proof to establish compliance with Prong Two.  Policy Interpretation, 44 \n9 Fed. Reg. at 71,418; Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830.  UCD has not met its burden on summary judgment where its \n10 own documents and other admissions establish that (1) UCD did not expand opportunities for women \n11 whatsoever from 1971 to 1996, and (2) female participation opportunities actually contracted from 1997 to \n12 2005, regardless of what teams UCD claims it added during this period, in large part because UCD \n13 eliminated existing varsity opportunities in wrestling and other sports.  (ADF 17-27.)  Additionally, even if \n14 the evidence established that UCD has expanded athletic opportunities for women, which it does not, it did \n15 not do so in a manner that was demonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of women.  \n16 In fact, the evidence demonstrates that UCD rejected application for varsity status from hundreds of UCD \n17 female club sports athletes between 1995 and 2005, as well as terminated existing varsity opportunities, \n18 including Plaintiffs’.  (ADF 22, 37.) \n19 UCD attempts to distract the Court from the inevitable consequences of this evidence by focusing \n20 its motion instead on (1) the percentage increase of women’s relative participation in UCD’s athletic \n21 program; (2) the addition of women’s varsity teams between 1995 and 2005 in conjunction with a baseless \n22 crediting theory; and (3) Committees, plans, and policies purportedly related to Title IX compliance.  None \n23 establish the expansion required by Prong Two.   \n24 // \n25 // \n26 // \n27 // \n \n28\n19 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

UCD Failed to Expand Female Participation Opportunities At All From \n2 1971 to 1996. \n \n3\nUCD cannot establish compliance with Prong Two as a matter of law because, among other \n4\nreasons,  it did not expand female participation opportunities one iota from 1971 to 1996.  (ADF 17.)  While \n5\nUCD makes much of the existence of women’s teams at UCD before the passage of Title IX, the law’s \n6\nenactment did nothing to prompt UCD to expand its women’s program to ensure equity.   UCD did not \n7\nexpand opportunities for 25 years.   Instead, UCD eliminated women’s golf and women’s field hockey \n8\nduring this time period.  (ADF 19.)  UCD contends that it eliminated women’s field hockey because all \n9\nother teams in its conference eliminated their teams, but a sworn declaration of the coach of another \n10\nwomen’s field hockey team in UCD’s conference at the time confirms the continued availability of \n11\ncompetition from all other schools in the region’s field hockey conference.  (ADF 20.)  Though UCD added \n12\nwomen’s soccer in 1983 after it eliminated women’s field hockey, UCD admits that the addition did not \n13\nresult in program expansion for women.  (ADF 17.)   \n14\nUCD argues that Plaintiffs may not rely on its historic failure to expand opportunities to defeat \n15\nsummary judgment because “they will be unable to show that had any impact on them” as they were not \n16\nstudents in the 1970’s and 1980’s.  (Def’s MPA at 23.)  The argument should be rejected outright, as UCD’s \n17\nentire history is relevant to Prong Two regardless of the tenure of these particular plaintiffs.  1996 OCR \n18\nClarification at 7.  UCD mis-cites Pederson v. La. State Univ.(“Pederson I”), 912 F. Supp. 892 (M.D. La. \n19\n1996), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 213 F.3d 858 (5th Cir. 2000), for this argument.  \n20\nPederson I in no way limited or modified the required analysis of history under Prong Two.  Rather, the \n21\ncourt addressed the issue of whether plaintiffs who had not established the requisite skill to compete at the \n22\nvarsity level could claim impact by the university’s failure to provide equal varsity athletic opportunities \n23\nprogram-wide.  Id. at 907.   \n24  \nb.  UCD Did Not Expand Participation Opportunities From 1998-2005. \n25  \n26 UCD cannot prevail on summary judgment where it did not expand actual female opportunities \n27 from 1998 to 2005.  (ADF 27.)  Rather, UCD eliminated dozens of varsity opportunities, without replacing \n28\n20 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

(ADF 27, 30.)  Having failed to expand actual opportunities, UCD failed to satisfy Prong Two.   \n3   UCD’s reliance on the relative percentage increase of women in varsity sports does not save this motion.   \n4 UCD claims “expansion” because the percentage of women athletes relative to their enrollment increased between \n5 1995 and 2005.  But this fact alone tells an incomplete story and is insufficient to satisfy Prong Two’s requirement \n6 of a history and continuing practice of expanding opportunities for women. In 1995, UCD was out of compliance by \n7 20%.  For a brief period, until 1999, it increased the actual athletic opportunities for women as well as narrowed the \n8 margin between the percentage of  women athletes and the percentage of women students.  But from 1999 until \n9 2005, that margin fluctuated (that is improved in 2000, but then worsened in 2001, 2002, 2003 and again in 2005), \n10 and the actual number of women’s athletic opportunities declined – from 426 in 1999 to 368 in 2005.  The only way \n11 that the percentage of women relative to enrollment increased at all during 1999-2005 was because UCD capped the \n12 number of men’s teams at the same time they were eliminating women’s opportunities, thus improving the \n13 appearance, but not the reality, of women’s athletics at Davis. As conceded by UCD’s Title IX expert, reductions in \n14 the men’s athletic program is not program expansion for women under Prong Two.  (UMF 50.)  As noted in the \n15 OCR’s 1996 Clarification:  \n \n16 OCR will not find a history and continuing practice of program expansion where an institution \nincreases the proportional participation opportunities for the underrepresented sex by reducing \n17 opportunities for the overrepresented sex alone or by reducing participation opportunities for the \noverrepresented sex to a proportionately greater degree than for the underrepresented sex. This is \n18 because part two considers an institution's good faith remedial efforts through actual program \nexpansion. \n19  \n20 1996 OCR Clarification (Title IX Appx. Exh. B) at 8. \n21 The court in Roberts v. Colorado State Board of Agric. agreed:   “[T]he ordinary meaning of the word “expansion” \n22 may not be twisted to find compliance under this prong when schools have increased the relative percentage of \n23 women participating in athletics by making cuts in both men’s and women’s sports programs.”  Roberts, 998 F.2d at \n24 830. \n25 UCD’s reliance on its addition of teams similarly fails to support Title IX compliance as a matter of law.  \n26 UCD asserts that it has satisfied Prong Two because it added three women’s varsity sports in 1996, women’s indoor \n27\n28\n21 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

(ADF 21, 22.)  Moreover, UCD’s contention that it added women’s indoor track in 1998-1999 is \n4 disputed.  UCD treats indoor and outdoor track a combined sport.8  (ADF 23-25.)  The credibility of UCD’s claim \n5 that it was added as a new sport is strained by documents addressing the addition of new women’s sports generated \n6 before this litigation, which make no mention of women’s indoor track as a new and separate sport.  (ADF 26.)  \n7 Such credibility determinations are within the proper province of the jury.  Soremekun, 509 F.3d at 984.  Most \n8 importantly, UCD documents establish that the purported addition of indoor track did not actually add female \n9 participation opportunities at UCD.  (ADF 25.) \n10 The evidence thus establishes that UCD added three teams in 1996, but then rested on its laurels until \n11 prompted by this litigation to add another team in 2005.  In the meanwhile, UCD dropped female participation \n12 opportunities on existing varsity teams, such as women’s lacrosse, water polo and wrestling.  (ADF 4, 33.)  UCD \n13 contends that at least some of the drop in female participation opportunities can be explained by UCD’s elimination \n14 of “B” teams on the women’s varsity lacrosse and water polo teams, which was a “valid reason” in its view.  Even if \n15 a drastic drop in participation opportunities could be justified under Prong Two, which Plaintiffs do not concede, the \n16 validity of UCD’s reason is a factual dispute not suitable for resolution here.9  UCD merely asserts why lacrosse \n17 slots were eliminated; it does not present any evidence to support this assertion.  (ADF 33.)  UCD’s suggestion that \n18 water polo slots were eliminated because of lack of competition is contradicted by the declaration of water polo \n19 coach Jamey Wright, who admitted that competition existed for the “B” teams against club teams at other institution.  \n20 (ADF 33.)  UCD’s expert agrees that the elimination of varsity opportunities is not appropriate where competition \n21\n                                                           \n22 7 While UCD claims that it started women’s golf in 2004, its own admissions indicate otherwise.  Women’s golf did \nnot begin competition until the 2005-2006 school year.  (ADF 22.)   \n23 8 Rejecting the attempt to rely on purported “women’s indoor track” as a team for the purposes of Prong Two is not \nwithout precedent.  In Cohen I, the court was not impressed with and did not credit Brown for the addition of \n24\nwomen’s winter track as evidence of expansion under Prong Two, characterizing it as “a sport that merely involved \nproviding indoor space to the existing women’s track team.”  Cohen I, 809 F. Supp. at 991. \n25 9 Plaintiffs’ Title IX Expert Donna Lopiano opined that it is normal to see a fluctuation in participation opportunities \nby 4-7 athletes program-wide at an institution in any given year, and that these very minimal fluctuations may be \n26\nacceptable under Prong Two if made up for immediately and expanded upon.  However, both the volume drop in \nparticipation rates and its continued drop over a number of years at UCD disqualifies it from relying on Prong Two.  \n27\n(UMF 148.)   \n \n28\n22 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

Moreover, even if such \n2 justification for the elimination of existing opportunities existed, it does not excuse the lack of expansion of \n3 opportunities that must be shown to satisfy Prong Two. \n4 What is clear is that UCD took no action to replace these eliminated participation opportunities much less \n5 engage in program expansion.  Between 1998 and 2005, female enrollment at UCD went from 10,596 to 12,834, \n6 adding over 2,200 women to UCD.  (See ADF 27.)  At the same time, 63 female participation opportunities were \n7 dropped at UCD, a drop that UCD’s expert conceded was “drastic.”  (ADF 29.)  By 2005, the athletic participation \n8 rates for women were at the lowest point since 1997.  (ADF 27.)  UCD’s addition of seven women’s varsity golf \n9 opportunities did not compensate for the loss of several teams worth of opportunities during this period.  (ADF 22.)  \n10 UCD’s failure to expand opportunities is determinative of the Prong Two analysis, or at the least, it is sufficient to \n11 raise a genuine issue of material fact on this motion.    \n \n12 c.  UCD’s Theory That It Should Be “Credited” For Adding Multiple \nSports In 1995-1996 Is Without Legal Support And Cannot Form The \n13 Basis For Establishing Program Expansion. \n \n14\nThe Court should also reject UCD’s effort to avoid its obligation to expand opportunities under Title IX \n15\nthrough an unprecedented “crediting” theory.  UCD proposes that it be given two to three years credit for each of the \n16\nthree sports it added in 1995, as though it added a team in 1995, another in 1998, and another in 2001.  The crediting \n17\ntheory does not establish compliance under Prong Two because the addition of teams, even if credited somehow, \n18\nfails to remedy UCD’s failure to expand opportunities during this time period. \n19\nMoreover, UCD expert Grant herself admits that she has never advanced her crediting theory before this \n20\ncase, and that it has no basis in Title IX regulations, OCR guidelines or case precedent.  (UMF 142.)  See 34 C.F.R. \n21\n§ 106.41(c), Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413, and 1996 OCR Clarification (Title IX Appx. Exh. B), none \n22\nof which provide for a Prong Two “crediting” where more than one team has been added at once.   As noted by \n23\nPlaintiffs’ Title IX Expert, Dr. Lopiano, based on her vast experience developing Title IX regulations, and advising \n24\nOCR on its Title IX interpretations and guidelines:  “[T]his is not Verizon and banking minutes.  There is no concept \n25\nlike that that has ever been contemplated byThere is no concept like that that has ever been contemplated by OCR \n26\nand I think it is a patently ridiculous concept. . . It doesn’t make sense logically.  It’s made up. . .  It is inconsistent \n27\nwith everything [Grant] has said previously.”   (UMF 142.) \n28\n23 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903.  All but one of \n5 Brown’s 15 women’s teams were created between 1971 and 1977.  Cohen I, 809 F.Supp. at 981.  Women’s indoor \n6 track was added five years later in 1982, nine years before the analysis period by the Court.  In upholding the district \n7 court’s decision, the Court of Appeal refused to credit Brown’s rapid expansion of the women’s program through \n8 the addition of fourteen women’s team during a six year period:     \n \n9 While a university deserves appreciable applause for supercharging a low voltage athletic program \nin one burst rather than powering it up over a longer period, such an energization, once undertaken \n10 does not forever hold the institution harmless.  Here, Brown labored for six years to weave a broad \narray of new activities into the fabric of its palestrian offerings.  The district court apparently \n11 believed, however, that Brown then rested on its laurels for at least twice as long.  The very length \nof this hiatus suggests something far short of a continuing practice of program expansion.   \n12  \n \n13 Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903. \n14 The crediting theory was similarly rejected in Roberts, 998 F.2d 824, 830.  The institution challenged a \n15 district court’s failure to give greater weight to its dramatic expansion of women’s athletic opportunities in the \n16 1970’s.  Id.  CSU added eleven teams in the1970’s, with the last sport added in 1977, but the district court found that \n17 it had not demonstrated a history and continuing practice of program expansion.  Id.  The Court of Appeal rejected \n18 the argument, noting “In essence, defendant suggests reading the words ‘continuing practice’ out of this prong of the \n19 test.”  Id.  The Court upheld the district court’s decision, especially in light of the fact that women’s participation \n20 opportunities declined steadily after the expansion of the program in the 1970’s.   \n21 As in Cohen and Roberts, applying Dr. Grant’s crediting theory here would lead to absurd results.  It would, \n22 in essence, allow UCD to sit back and wait until prodded by an embarrassing disparity between women’s athletic \n23 opportunities and women’s enrollment, at which time it would add a few teams, still not reach proportionality, and \n24 rest on its laurels once more.  This is the antithesis of the “continuing practice of program expansion” that Prong \n25 Two requires.  As Dr. Lopiano noted:  “We would probably see a stoppage of the addition of women’s sports within \n26 the next two decades.”  (UMF 142.) \n27\n28\n24 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

In other words, an institution cannot \n4 claim compliance with Title IX just by adding teams when it is in fact (by capping men’s teams and/or reducing the \n5 sizes of other women’s teams) not adding more opportunities for women.  (UMF 150.)  UCD offered less athletic \n6 opportunities for women in 2005 than it did in 1999.  (UMF 30.)  This cannot, by any stretch, be considered \n7 program expansion. \nd.  UCD Eliminated Existing Female Participation Opportunities, Including \n8 Women’s Varsity Wrestling. \n9 UCD’s elimination of women’s wrestling opportunities at a time when it was not otherwise complying with \n10 Title IX also precludes its reliance on Prong Two on summary judgment.  Where an institution is not in compliance \n11 with Title IX, its elimination of existing and viable female participation opportunities is evidence that Prong Two is \n12 not satisfied and constitutes a further violation of Title IX.  See Barrett, 2003 WL 22803477, at *7 (elimination of \n13 women’s gymnastic team was evidence of violation of Title IX and non-compliance with Prong Two where \n14 institution was not otherwise in compliance with Title IX); Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 897-98 (elimination women’s \n15 volleyball and gymnastic teams was evidence of violation of Title IX and non-compliance with Prong Two); \n16 Roberts, 998 F.2d at 830 (elimination of women’s softball team was evidence of violation of Title IX and non-\n17 compliance with Prong Two.)   \n18 To refute this, UCD suggests a wide variety of contradictory arguments.  UCD first contends it did not \n19 eliminate a women’s wrestling program because Plaintiffs were not existing varsity athlete and/or they were not \n20 participating in a women’s program.  Ample evidence disputes both assertions.  To suggest that Plaintiffs and other \n21 women wrestlers were not official varsity participants, UCD relies heavily on UCD media guides produced as \n22 promotional materials, not official statements about team status.  (Response to UMF 19.)  Moreover, this evidence is \n23 refuted by evidence establishing that Plaintiffs and other women wrestlers were on team rosters, competed in events \n24 and completed varsity athlete eligibility requirements.  (ADF 52, 55.)  UCD provided them with the benefits of \n25 varsity status, including coaching, trainers, facilities, laundry, lockers, medical insurance, and academic tutoring.  \n26 (ADF 54.)  OCR recognizes these as indicators of varsity participant status:      \n \n27 As a general rule, all athletes who are listed on a team's squad or eligibility list and are on the team as of the \nteam's first competitive event are counted as participants by OCR. . . . . In determining participation \n28\n25 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

B) at 6. \n4   In addition, even though ample evidence exists that Plaintiffs competed while at UCD, whether they did so \n5 is not determinative.  (Id.)  Nor is the type of competition in which they participated.  Both parties’ experts agree that \n6 it is acceptable for varsity athletes in a developing sport to obtain competition in open or amateur events.  (UMF \n7 156.)  As an expert in Favia v. Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Grant “testified that it was good for student \n8 athletes to compete in championship meets no matter who sponsored them, or how prestigious they might be, and \n9 that whether or not it was the N.C.A.A. that sponsored them should not be a factor.”  Favia, 812 F.Supp. at 582.  \n10 UCD’s argument that Plaintiffs were not part of a women’s program is belied by admissions of UCD’s Athletic \n11 Director, who admitted that UCD had a women’s varsity program.  Ample evidence thus exists that UCD \n12 eliminated an existing women’s varsity wrestling program.   \n13 UCD next contends that its elimination of the women’s varsity program was not discriminatory because it \n14 sufficed to provide Plaintiffs with the opportunity to try out for the men’s wrestling team.  UCD argues that what \n15 Plaintiffs sought was preferential inclusion on the men’s team where they lacked the necessary skills.  However, as \n16 noted by the Court in denying UCD’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on this point:  “[T]he crux of plaintiffs’ \n17 claim is that this accommodation was not effective because they were forced to compete in a contact sport against \n18 men using men’s rules.”  (Memo. & Order [Docket # 226] at 25:27-26:2.)  The facts bear this out.  (See ADF 88, \n19 93.)  Requiring that women compete against men in a contact sport generally applicable to men, in order to have a \n20 varsity athletic opportunity, is hardly non-discriminatory.  If such a policy were generally permitted there would be a \n21 substantial risk that boys would dominate the girls thereby denying them a real opportunity to compete.  This is \n22 precisely why courts have repeatedly upheld separate but equal athletic programs under Title IX as constitutionally \n23 permissible.  See, e.g., O’Connor v. Bd. of Educ., 449 U.S. 1301 (1980).   \n24 UCD’s cases on this point are inapposite, as all of the cases considered a different issue, that is, whether \n25 women were entitled to try out for a position on a men’s team.  Here, no matter how UCD bends the facts, Plaintiffs \n26 never sought such an opportunity.  (ADF 49, 66.)  Instead, Plaintiffs were varsity wrestlers who were eliminated \n27 from the wrestling program because of their gender, and were then refused the creation of a separate women’s team \n28\n26 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

UCD eliminated equal opportunities and replaced them with discriminatory requirements \n2 for continued participation.  This violates Title IX. \n \n3 e.  The Mere Existence of Title IX Committees, Policies, and Plans Do Not \nConstitute a History and Continuing Practice of Program Expansion. \n4\nUCD’s last-ditch effort to establish a history and continuing practice of program expansion through the \n5\nexistence of Title IX committees, policies, and plans is also insufficient to support summary judgment.  None of \n6\nthese factors constitute compliance with Prong Two where an institution has not engaged in actual expansion.   \n7\nBarrett, 2003 WL 22803477 at * 7 (the formation of a Title IX committee is insufficient under Prong Two, \n8\nespecially where institution ignores Title IX compliance warnings from that committee);  Favia I, 812 F.Supp. at \n9\n585.  (“You can’t replace programs with promises.”)  See also Choike v. Slippery Rock Univ. of Pa., No. CIVA 06-\n10\n622, 2006 WL 2060576 (W.D. Pa. Jul. 21, 2006), at *7   (“Having a plan to ameliorate inequities is not the same as \n11\nhaving ameliorated them.”)   \n12\nHere, UCD had committees that issued repeated warnings over a ten year period to UCD that it was not \n13\ncomplying with Title IX.  (ADF 11.)  Despite these warning, these committees did not implement plans with \n14\nspecific timetables to reach Title IX compliance.  (ADF 41.)  Plans that fail to set forth a specific timetable for Title \n15\nIX compliance are inadequate.  (UMF 145.)  Favia v. Ind. Univ. of Pa. (“Favia II”), 7 F.3d 332, 343 (3d Cir. 1993) \n16\naff’g, 812 F. Supp. 578 (W.D. Pa. 1993)) (in upholding a preliminary injunction issued by the district court, the \n17\nThird Circuit noted that the institution “did not have a specific overall plan in place to achieve total compliance at \n18\nany projected future date.”)  Moreover, whether UCD’s policies regarding the addition of women’s sports were \n19\nadequate is disputed by evidence that suggests that they were not regularly communicated or utilized by UCD.  \n20\nUCD also admits that it deviated from the criteria which were supposed to govern the selection of new women’s \n21\nsports when it added women’s varsity golf.  (UMF 122.)  Because UCD’s committees, policies, and plans did little \n22\nto ensure actual gender equity and program expansion for women, they are insufficient to establish Prong Two \n23\ncompliance on summary judgment.   \n24  \n4.  Assuming Arguendo That UCD Expanded Participation Opportunities for \n25 Women Athletes, It Did Not Do So in a Manner That Was Demonstrably \nResponsive to The Developing Interest and Abilities of Its Female Students. \n26\nTo the extent that UCD created female varsity opportunities during the period of 1997-2005, it did not \n27\ncreate opportunities that were demonstrably responsive to UCD student interest in sports such as wrestling, \n28\n27 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

This alone is sufficient grounds to deny \n2 summary judgment.  As noted in Cohen II:  “[A] university must design expansion in whatever form and at \n3 whatever pace to respond to the flux and reflux of unserved interests. . . . The issue of responsiveness is fact-\n4 intensive and in most instances, as here, its resolution will be within the trier's province.  Cohen II, 991 F.2d at 903. \n5 UCD rejected applications for varsity status from women’s field hockey and badminton teams in \n6 1995, and made no effort to expand opportunities in response to this developing interest, despite the fact that \n7 female participation opportunities spiraled downward over the next ten years.  (ADF 19.)  Instead, UCD \n8 rejected applications for varsity teams submitted for these same sports again in 2003, along with \n9 applications for varsity status from the women’s rugby, bowling, and equestrian club teams.  (ADF 37.)  \n10 Then, in 2005, UCD added women’s golf despite the fact that no women’s golf club team existed on \n11 campus, and it had to recruit for a year in order to actually field a team.  (ADF 39.)  Such evidence is \n12 sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether UCD acted in a manner that was \n13 demonstrably responsive to developing interest and ability of its female students.   \n5.  Genuine Issues of Material Fact Exist As To Whether UCD Also Violated \n14\nTitle IX By Failing To Establish A Separate Women’s Varsity Wrestling \nTeam. \n15\n \n16\nEven assuming arguendo that a women’s varsity wrestling program never existed at UCD, UCD violated \n17\nTitle IX when it failed to create a separate women’s wrestling team at Plaintiffs’ request.  For purposes of Title IX, \n18\nwrestling is a contact sport.  34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b), 45 C.F.R § 86.41(b).  OCR’s 1979 Title IX Policy Interpretation \n19\nexplains the application of the Policy Interpretation in the selection of sports by an institution, including an \n20\ninstitution’s obligations with respect to contact sports.  Specifically, it provides that: \n \n21\nEffective accommodation means that if an institution sponsors a team for members of one \n  sex in a contact sport, it must do so for members of the other sex under the following \n22\n  circumstances: \n(1) The opportunities for members of the excluded sex have historically been limited; and \n23\n(2) There is sufficient interest and ability among the members of the excluded sex to \n  sustain a viable team and a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition for that \n24\n  team.    \n25\nOCR 1979 Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71418.   \n26\nUCD disregards this aspect of Title IX in its entirety.  Instead, it claims that it had no obligation to allow \n27\nwomen to try out for the men’s wrestling team, but did so anyway, suggesting that in doing so it exceeded its \n28\n28 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

As the Policy \n2 Interpretation makes clear, because wrestling is a contact sport from which women have been historically excluded, \n3 and because, as the evidence demonstrates, there was and continues to be sufficient interest and ability to sustain a \n4 viable women’s wrestling team with a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition, UCD violated Title IX \n5 by refusing to field a women’s wrestling team after being asked repeatedly by Plaintiffs to do so.   \n6 While OCR has not provided specific guidance about how to evaluate interest and ability for the purpose of \n7 this provision, its discussion of factors to be considered in evaluating interest and ability under Prong Three is \n8 instructive.  Interest factors include:  (1) requests by students and admitted students that a particular sport be added; \n9 (2) participation in particular sports by admitted students; and (3) participation rates in high schools, amateur athletic \n10 associations and community sports leagues from which the institution draws its students in order to ascertain likely \n11 interest and abilities of its students and admitted students in a particular sport.  1996 OCR Clarification (Title IX \n12 Appx., Exh. B) at 9-10.  OCR’s ability factors include:  (1) the athletic experience and accomplishments – in \n13 interscholastic, club or intramural competition – of students and admitted students interested in playing the sport; (2)  \n14 opinions of coaches, administrators, and athletes at the institution regarding whether interested students and admitted \n15 students have the potential to sustain a varsity team; and (3) if the team has previously competed at the club or \n16 intramural level, whether the competitive experience of the team indicates that it has the potential to sustain an \n17 intercollegiate team.   Id.  Neither a poor competitive record nor the inability of interested students or admitted \n18 students to play at the same level of competition engaged in by the institution's other athletes is conclusive evidence \n19 of lack of ability.  Id.  It is sufficient that interested students and admitted students have the potential to sustain an \n20 intercollegiate team.  Id.   \n21 OCR does provide specific guidance with respect to requirement in the Contact Sport Provision that there be \n22 a reasonable expectation of competition for the separate contact sport team.  The 1990 OCR Title IX Athletics \n23 Investigator’s Manual10 clarifies that an institution must look within its normal competitive regions for the \n24\n25\n                                                           \n26 10 Cohen I, 809 F.

OCR, Title IX Investigator’s Manual (1990), (hereinafter “1990 OCR Manual”) at 2711  \n2 The 1990 Manual also provides:  “Institutions may be required by the Title IX regulation to actively encourage the \n3 development of such competition … when overall athletic opportunities within that region have been historically \n4 limited for members of one sex.”  (Id.)  \n5 Plaintiffs present sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to interest, ability, and \n6 competition for women’s wrestling under these standards.  Women have been competing in UCD’s varsity \n7 wrestling program consistently since 1992.  (ADF 46, 48.)  Plaintiffs were actively participating in the varsity \n8 wrestling program when UCD unlawfully removed them, establishing interest and ability.  (ADF 72.)  Plaintiffs \n9 such as Lauren Mancuso competed at a high level in the sport and came to UCD to do so as well.  (ADF 65.)

(ADF 73.)  Many high school girls continued to \n12 inquire about wrestling opportunities at UCD once the program was cut.  (ADF 95.) \n13 In this case, UCD’s normal competitive region during this time period spanned the country.  (UMF 6.)  \n14 Substantial intercollegiate competition for women’s wrestling existed throughout UCD’s competitive regions, \n15 including national championships.  (ADF 73.)  Moreover, whether UCD actively encouraged the development of \n16 intercollegiate competition for women wrestlers is a matter of disputed material fact.  (ADF 74.)  Several athletic \n17 administrators admitted that they did not develop competition for women wrestlers, in sharp contrast to UCD efforts \n18 to create an entirely new football conference to enable its team to play because the Big West Conference did not \n19 have football.  (ADF 74.) \n20 Because Plaintiffs present substantial evidence confirming sufficient interest and ability to sustain a \n21 women’s wrestling team, and evidence demonstrating a reasonable expectation of competition, they have raised a \n22 genuine issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment on this ground alone. \n23 // \n24 // \n25 // \n26\n                                                           \n11   Relevant portions of which are attached as App. Ex.

UCD’s Conduct Constituted Intentional Discrimination, and in Any Event, \n1 Triable Issues of Material Fact Preclude Summary Judgment on This \nGround. \n2  \n3 UCD wrongly contends that Plaintiffs lack evidence that UCD’s Title IX violations were intentional or \n4 deliberately indifferent.  According to UCD, the school is insulated from liability for Title IX damages because it \n5 tried to work with OCR to resolve Plaintiffs’ complaints, because it thought Plaintiffs’ request to participate in \n6 wrestling was not well-founded, and because it believed there was insufficient interest to establish a women’s \n7 wrestling team.  (Def.’s MPA at 32-37.)  None of these are grounds for judgment against Plaintiffs as a matter of \n8 law.   \n9 As an initial matter, UCD misconstrues the intent requirement for Title IX.  Plaintiffs need not prove that \n10 UCD specifically intended to violate Title IX, but only that UCD meant to treat its female wrestlers and other female \n11 athletes the way it did—in other words, all that is required is that UCD behaved volitionally, as opposed to \n12 accidentally, with regard to its treatment of women athletes.  Pederson v. La. State Univ. (“Pederson II”), 213 F.3d \n13 858, 881 (5th Cir. 2000) (university need not have intended to violate Title IX to be held liable for damages); Favia \n14 I, 812 F. Supp. at 584 (in an equal accommodation case, court confirmed that “Title IX and the implementing \n15 regulations can be violated without showing a specific intent on the part of the educational institution to discriminate \n16 against women”); see Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 680 (1979) (plaintiff’s exclusion from participation in \n17 defendant’s medical program because of her sex is intentional discrimination that violates Title IX); Cmtys. for \n18 Equity v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 459 F.3d 676, 696 (6th Cir. 2006) (proof of discriminatory animus not \n19 necessary to establish Title IX violation:  “The Court's task is to analyze the resulting athletic opportunities for girls \n20 and boys from the different treatment that they experience …, and if girls receive unequal opportunities, Title IX has \n21 been violated”); Haffer v. Temple Univ., 678 F.Supp. 517, 527, 539-40 (E.D. Pa. 1987) (finding requisite “intent” in \n22 university’s explicit classification of intercollegiate athletic teams on the basis of gender; denying summary \n23 judgment; holding plaintiffs need not prove discriminatory animus to succeed on Title IX claim in action \n24 challenging gender inequity in university's intercollegiate athletic program).    \n25 Courts refer to “disparate treatment” as “intentional discrimination” because disparate treatment means an \n26 intent to treat differently.  In sex segregated cases like athletics, intent is established as a matter of law because males \n27 and females are separated into different groups from the outset.  Any different treatment of these segregated groups \n28\n31 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

Johnson, 478 F. Supp. 1075, 1080 \n2 (E.D. Mich. 1979).  No evil motive is required to prove a violation.  A defendant is liable even if its motive is \n3 benevolent or if its intent is to “help” females.  Such paternalism and archaic views of females are merely another \n4 form of discrimination.  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-34 (1996);  Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. \n5 677, 684-85 (1973); UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199 (1991) (“[w]hether an employment practice \n6 involves disparate treatment through explicit facial discrimination does not depend on why the employer \n7 discriminates”); Bangerter v. Orem City Corp., 46 F.3d 1491, 1501 (10th Cir. 1995) (absence of malevolent intent \n8 does not convert facially discriminatory policy into neutral policy with discriminatory effect). \n9 Title IX’s prohibitions against discrimination require that students “are not only protected from \n10 discrimination, but also specifically shielded from being ‘excluded from participation in’ or ‘denied the benefits of” \n11 any ‘education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.’ [20 U.S.C.] § 1681(a). The statute makes \n12 clear that, whatever else it prohibits, students must not be denied access to educational benefits and opportunities on \n13 the basis of gender.”  Davis v. Monroe County Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 650 (1990).  Thus, a university’s \n14 “intentional decision not to accommodate effectively the interests of their female students by not providing sufficient \n15 athletic opportunities” is intentional discrimination in violation of Title IX.  Pederson II, 213 F.3d at 880. \n16 As the Court in Pederson noted, for example, treatment of women based on outdated attitudes about gender \n17 constitute intentional discrimination.  Defendant “need not have intended to violate Title IX, but need only have \n18 intended to treat women differently.”  Id.; citing United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (holding that an \n19 institution's refusal to admit women is intentional gender discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause \n20 because, inter alia, of “overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and \n21 females”); Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 625 (1984) (warning of the dangers posed by gender \n22 discrimination based on “archaic and overbroad assumptions”).  Just as the Pederson II court held a university liable \n23 for Title IX damages over its protests that it never intended to violate the statute and had even invited an OCR \n24 investigation into its women’s athletic program,  it is no defense to UCD’s damages liability here that the school \n25 may not have intended to discriminate against women, or that it worked with OCR in an effort to resolve Plaintiffs’ \n26 complaints.  213 F.3d at 880-81.  Moreover, as the facts demonstrate, far from resolving the discrimination, the \n27 OCR’s plan compounded it by requiring plaintiffs to wrestle off against men thus effectively barring them from the \n28\n32 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

(ADF 83.) \n2 Equally unavailing is UCD’s attempt to disprove intent on grounds of the purported reasonableness of its \n3 refusal to separate the women wrestlers from the roster cap.12  First, UCD’s handling of the wrestling team roster \n4 cap is just a tiny sliver of the evidentiary pie in this case, which addresses not just UCD’s treatment of women \n5 wresters but the administration of women’s athletics as a whole.  But more to the point, UCD’s subjective and self-\n6 serving belief in the reasonableness of its conduct toward women wrestlers in particular—or, for that matter, women \n7 athletes generally—does not negate that the university acted intentionally within the meaning of Title IX.  Pederson \n8 II, 213 F.3d at 880-82 (university’s steadfast belief its women’s athletic program was “wonderful” does not negate \n9 Title IX intent). \n10 Moreover, assessing motive “is an inherently complex endeavor” that is most appropriately resolved by the \n11 factfinder at trial upon consideration of a full record.  Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 546 (1999).  Without such a \n12 “searching inquiry” by the factfinder, “‘those [acting for impermissible motives] could easily mask their behavior \n13 behind a complex web of post hoc rationalizations.’”   Lowe v. City of Monrovia, 775 F.2d 998, 1009, (9th Cir. \n14 1985), amended by 784 F.2d 1407 (9th Cir. 1986) quoting Peacock v. Duval, 694 F.2d 644, 646 (9th Cir. 1982)). \n15   Finally, UCD argues at length that judgment should be entered against Plaintiffs as a matter of law due to an \n16 ostensibly insufficient interest in women’s wrestling at UCD.  (Def.’s MPA at 34-37.)  This argument is particularly \n17 troubling not because it presents any threat to the sufficiency of Plaintiffs’ claims, but because it speaks volumes \n18 about the insidious and systemic problem of sex discrimination in UCD’s women’s athletic program.  As aptly \n19 explained by the Fifth Circuit in the Pederson II case: \n \n20 Appellees argue brazenly that the evidence did not demonstrate sufficient interest and ability in fast-\npitch softball at LSU and that, therefore, they cannot be liable under Title IX. The heart of this \n21 contention is that an institution with no coach, no facilities, no varsity team, no scholarships, and no \nrecruiting in a given sport must have on campus enough national-caliber athletes to field a \n22 competitive varsity team in that sport before a court can find sufficient interest and abilities to exist. \nIt should go without saying that adopting this criteria would eliminate an effective accommodation \n23 claim by any plaintiff, at any time. \n24 Pederson II, 213 F.3d at 878. \n25   Nonetheless, as set forth above, Plaintiffs have presented ample evidence of interest sufficient to raise a \n26\n                                                           \n27 12 UCD’s claim that Plaintiffs requested a “separate roster cap” is disputed.

(ADF 73; UMF 156.) \n2 The motion should be denied accordingly. \n3  \n7.  UCD Is Not Entitled to Summary Judgment on Notice Grounds. \n4\n  UCD contends that Plaintiffs’ claim for damages under Title IX is barred as a matter of law because UCD \n5\ndid not have notice of Plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation charge.  UCD’s argument is legally and factually \n6\nuntenable.  \n7 a.  UCD Misapprehends and Misapplies Gebser’s Notice Requirement. \n8 As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, where, as here, plaintiffs allege that a recipient of \n9 federal funds (i.e., a university) is engaged in intentional sex discrimination in violation of Title IX, that recipient is \n10 necessarily on notice of its obligations to comply with the law as a result of receiving federal funds.  No further \n11 notice is required.  Additional notice has been required only in the context of Title IX teacher-student and \n12 student-student sexual harassment claims, because the concern in those cases is holding a university liable for acts of \n13 which it has no knowledge.   \n14 Title IX jurisprudence in this area is firmly established.  In Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., the Supreme Court held \n15 that a plaintiff alleging discrimination in admissions against a university had an implied right of action.  In so \n16 holding, the Court noted that in enacting Title IX, Congress had two objectives: first, it “wanted to avoid the use of \n17 federal resources to support discriminatory practices; second, it wanted to provide individual citizens effective \n18 protection against those practices.”  Cannon, 441 U.S. at 704.  Then in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Schs., 503 \n19 U.S. 60 (1992), the Court held that a plaintiff asserting a Title IX claim was entitled to monetary damages, finding \n20 that “the traditional presumption in favor of any appropriate relief for violation of a federal right” applies to Title IX.  \n21 Franklin, 503 U.S. at 73.  The Court flatly rejected the school’s argument that it had insufficient notice of its \n22 obligations to face liability for monetary damages.  Finding that Title IX “unquestionably” placed upon the school \n23 the duty not to discriminate on the basis of sex, the Court further stated, “Congress surely did not intend for federal \n24 moneys to be expended to support the intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe.”  Id. at 75.   \n25 Each Supreme Court case since Franklin to address the issue has similarly explained that Title IX itself \n26 provides sufficient notice to recipients of federal funds of their obligations under Title IX not to discriminate on the \n27 basis of sex.  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274 (1998), upon which UCD principally relies, is \n28\n34 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 42 of 47\n \n1 inapposite.  Plaintiff Gebser, a high school student who was sexually harassed by a teacher who involved her in a \n2 secret sexual relationship, sought damages from her school district under Title IX.  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 274.  Based \n3 on the record before it, the Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s finding that the school district reasonably \n4 lacked any knowledge of the teacher’s clandestine discriminatory harassment, and thus had no opportunity to initiate \n5 remedial action before the plaintiff resorted to litigation.  Id. at 278-79.  The Court held that, under the facts \n6 presented, the school district could not be held liable for Title IX damages for its teacher’s unlawful conduct on a \n7 pure respondeat superior and constructive notice theory; there must be some evidence that an authorized employee \n8 or official actually knew or should have known of the underlying sexual abuse before Title IX damages liability \n9 attaches.  Id. at 274-76.  The Supreme Court carefully circumscribed the intended reach of its holding: \n \n10      \n[P]etitioners seek not just to establish a Title IX violation but to recover damages based on theories \n11 of respondeat superior and constructive notice.  It is that aspect of their action, in our view, that is \nmost critical to resolving the case. \n12  \n13 Id. at 283.   \n14 Gebser’s narrow holding—that a funding recipient is not liable for Title IX damages on a respondeat \n15 superior and constructive notice theory absent any evidence that it knew or should have known of an employee’s \n16 underlying acts of discriminatory harassment—imposes no unmet burden on Plaintiffs in this equal \n17 accommodations case.  Plaintiffs here do not, and need not, rely on a “respondeat superior and constructive notice” \n18 theory to establish UCD’s violation of Title IX because UCD was fully (and perhaps even uniquely) aware of the \n19 level and extent of athletic opportunities afforded to female students.  Quite unlike the school district that was \n20 oblivious to a teacher’s covert abuse of a student in Gebser, the evidence here establishes that UCD administration \n21 officials had direct oversight and responsibility for all aspects of the women’s athletic program relevant to Plaintiffs’ \n22 ineffective accommodation claim, including ensuring the university’s compliance with Title IX.  (ADF 1,2.)  \n23 Nothing further is required.  (ADF 1, 2); Gebser, 524 U.S. at 297 (“because respondent assumed the statutory duty \n24 set out in Title IX as part of its consideration for the receipt of federal funds, that duty constitutes an affirmative \n25 undertaking that is more significant than a mere promise to obey the law”).   \n26 The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this principle.  In Davis, 526 U.S. at 641-42, the Court stated \n27 that notice “is not a bar to liability where a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute.”   \n28\n35 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167 (2005).  In \n3 concluding that Title IX encompassed a private right of action for retaliation and rejecting defendant’s “notice” \n4 argument, the Court stated that recipients of federal funds “have been on notice that they could be subjected to \n5 private suits for intentional sex discrimination under Title IX since 1979, when we decided Cannon.”  Id. at 182.  \n6 The Court drove its point home by stating that notice “does not bar a private damages action under Title IX where \n7 the funding recipient engages in intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute.”  Id. at 183 (citations \n8 and internal quotations omitted).  Title IX thus “encompass[es] diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination.” Id.  \n9 Where, as here, school officials had direct access to and oversight responsibility for all relevant aspects of \n10 the women’s athletic program including the obligation to ensure its compliance with Title IX, the university was “on \n11 notice” and appropriately may be called to account for its failure to effectively accommodate women’s athletic \n12 interests and abilities.  (ADF 1, 2.)  See generally Pederson II, 213 F.3d at 878-83 (holding university accountable \n13 for Title IX damages on equal accommodation theory). \n14 The Pederson II case is directly on point.  It addressed whether the notice requirements in Title IX sexual \n15 harassment cases applied where the claim was a university’s failure to provide equal athletic opportunities.  The \n16 court held:  “In the instant case, it is the institution itself that is discriminating.  The proper test is not whether it knew \n17 of or is responsible for the actions of others, but is whether Appellees intended to treat women differently on the \n18 basis of their sex by providing them unequal athletic opportunity, and, as we noted above, we are convinced that \n19 they did.”  Id. at 882.  See also Ferguson v. City of Phoenix, 157 F.3d 668, 677 (9th Cir. 1998) (noting the rationale \n20 in Gebser to limit damages under a theory of respondent superior is “clearly distinguishable” where the federal \n21 recipient’s liability “arises from its own acts and official policies”); Cherry v. Univ. of Wis. Sys. Bd. of Regents, 265 \n22 F.3d 541, 555 (7th Cir. 2001) (“In short, when the Board accepted federal education funds under Title IX, it was \n23 clearly put on notice that it may not discriminate in its programs on the basis of sex, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a); “that if it \n24 does discriminate on the basis of sex, it may be sued by a private individual. . . .”; Litman v. George Mason Univ., \n25 186 F.3d 544, 553 (4th Cir. 1999) (same).  This conclusion, of course, goes hand in hand with UCD’s affirmative \n26 obligations to comply with Title IX’s provisions.  See, e.g., 34 C.F.R. § 106.4(a). \n27 This ample authority shuts the door on UCD’s argument that it was not on notice that it may face liability \n28\n36 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

This is conduct clearly prohibited by Title IX which \n2 itself provided notice to UCD of its obligations.  Having agreed to comply with Title IX, and having accepted and \n3 spent federal funding, UCD cannot now avoid the obligations to which it previously agreed by arguing that it has not \n4 been on notice of those obligations.  See Jackson, 544 U.S. at 183-84 (“[t]he Board could not have realistically \n5 supposed that, given this context, it remained free” to violate Title IX). \n6 UCD’s reliance on Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568 (8th Cir. 2001) is entirely misplaced.  \n7 Grandson, is neither controlling nor persuasive.  Indeed, it stands alone in applying Gebser to a claim of intentional \n8 discrimination by a university.  The reason for this is evident.  As Davis (which Grandson did not even cite, let alone \n9 address) and Jackson (which post-dates Grandson) make plain – Gebser applies, even if stretched beyond its context \n10 of sexual harassment – only when there is a question as to whether the federal recipient itself received actual notice \n11 of the wrongful acts of third parties.  See, e.g., Gebser, 524 U.S. at 287-88 (it is “sensible to assume that Congress \n12 did not envision a recipient’s liability in damages” when the recipient “was unaware of the discrimination”); Davis, \n13 526 U.S. at 643 (Gebser sought “to eliminate any risk that the recipient would be liable in damages not for its own \n14 official decision but instead for its employees’ independent actions” (citations and internal quotations omitted)).  \n15 Moreover, the Ninth Circuit has applied Gebser and Davis only in the context of sexual harassment claims.  See., \n16 e.g., Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d, 736, 739 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Johnson v. Clovis Unified \n17 Sch. Dist., No. 04-CV-6719 AWI DLB, 2007 WL 1456062, at *3 (E.D. Cal. May 17, 2007); Michelle M. v. \n18 Dunsmuir Joint Union Sch. Dist., No. 04-CV-2411 MCE PAN, 2006 WL 2927485, at *4 (E.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2006). \n19 Moreover, whereas Grandson accepted the district court’s questionable determination that  administrators at \n20 the University of Minnesota’s Duluth campus (“UMD”) somehow were unaware of the unequal treatment of \n21 women in athletics, 272 F.3d at 575-76, the evidence here plainly establishes that UCD was well aware of its \n22 obligations and of facts giving rise to Plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claim.  \n \n23 b.  The Evidence Establishes That UCD Was On Notice of Plaintiffs’ \nIneffective Accommodation Charge. \n24  \n25   As explained above, there is no additional requirement of “notice” to UCD beyond their agreement to \n26 receive federal funds which contains affirmative obligations to comply with Title IX’s provisions.  Even if the Court \n27 were persuaded that some sort of “notice” was required, however, evidence abounds that UCD was on notice both \n28\n37 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

UCD argues, \n5 however, that because Plaintiffs’ complaints related to wrestling, this cannot be notice that Plaintiffs were claiming \n6 that UCD was not effectively accommodating women athletes as a whole in violation of Title IX.  This is a \n7 ridiculous and nonsensical argument, made plain by this admission by UCD: “A claim of ineffective \n8 accommodation encompasses the entire athletic program for the underrepresented sex – not just one specific aspect.”  \n9 (Def’s MPA at 37:28-38:1.)  This is, in fact, the law.  Title IX approaches the question of compliance on a \n10 programmatic rather than sport-specific basis.  Policy Interpretation, 44 Fed. Reg. at 71,417, Part VII. B.5.  \n11 Assessment is according to whether the institution’s “program as a whole” is satisfactory.  Id. at 71,422, App. B, \n12 Resp. to Add’l Comments (8) See Williams, 998 F.2d at 174-75 (Title IX regulations require inquiry regarding \n13 overall opportunities rather than opportunities in a particular sport).  Plaintiffs’ complaint to the OCR about UCD’s \n14 failure to effectively accommodate women in the varsity wrestling program is therefore necessarily a claim that \n15 UCD was failing to effectively accommodate women in UCD athletics program in violation of Title IX.   \n16 Here, it is beyond dispute that UCD was on notice of Plaintiffs’ complaints of discrimination, from, among \n17 other things, Plaintiffs’ meetings and attempted meetings with Defendants Warzecka, Franks and Vanderhoef (UMF \n18 93), the filing of their OCR complaints (ADF 77, 80), the involvement of state legislators, the student senate, and the \n19 media (ADF 76), and the filing of both Coach Burch’s and plaintiffs’ civil rights complaints.  In addition, UCD \n20 knew about the protests, flyers, letters, news articles and the response of Assemblywoman Helen Thomson \n21 generated by UCD’s elimination of varsity wrestling opportunities for women.  (ADF 76.)  These events repeatedly \n22 raised broad questions about UCD’s gender discrimination and Title IX compliance in regards to its athletic \n23 program.  (UMF 93.)   \n24 Further, UCD acknowledged Plaintiffs’ civil rights complaint to OCR and the OCR investigation process.  \n25 UCD argues that it took Plaintiffs’ OCR complaints to mean only that there was “an unusual set of circumstances \n26 involving women and the wrestling team,” and not an overall failure of the athletic program to effectively \n27 accommodate women under Title IX.  (See Def.’s MPA at 37:25-38:17.)   In fact, the evidence shows that UCD \n28\n38 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.  S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-FCD-EFB   Document 342    Filed 03/06/08   Page 46 of 47\n \n1 regarded the OCR complaints and OCR’s investigation as a program-wide grievance.  (ADF 80, 90.)   \n2 Moreover, UCD’s awareness of its program wide non-compliance is evidenced by dozens of internal \n3 memos and official reports in which UCD admits that it is concerned about its compliance status regarding Title \n4 IX.  (ADF 10.)  Reports, Memorandum and emails from 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2002 \n5 acknowledge and warn of UCD’s failure to comply with Title IX.  (UMF 93.)  In light of the vast evidence \n6 demonstrating its own awareness of non-compliance with Title IX, it is, at best, disingenuous of UCD to claim \n7 ignorance in the face of Plaintiffs’ complaints.  Finally, UCD’s litigation position proves it knows and understands \n8 that a complaint from women athletes about unequal treatment is a complaint that goes to UCD’s athletic program \n9 as a whole.  UCD has, from the outset, defended this action on the basis of the sufficiency of its entire women’s \n10 athletic program.  (Docket # 34.).  In a letter brief in September 2007 that “Title IX does not establish a right to \n11 participate in any particular sport at the college of one’s choice. Absent program wide non-compliance, a student \n12 has no cause of action merely because they cannot earn a spot on any current varsity team.”  (Docket # 221 \n13 [citations and quotation marks omitted; emphasis added].  Indeed, UCD has explained in this motion its \n14 understanding that Title IX requires programwide compliance.  (See Def’s MPA at 37-38.) \n15 Indeed, the Court should reject UCD’s notice argument because it would impose upon ordinary students a \n16 burden to provide an unprecedented, unwarranted, and likely prohibitively high level of specificity in their OCR \n17 complaints.  The crux of UCD’s argument is not that Plaintiffs gave it no notice, but rather that Plaintiffs’ OCR \n18 complaints were insufficiently comprehensive and failed to specify all potential legal theories for UCD’s Title IX \n19 liability, such that UCD only concerned itself with wrestling team issues.  To require OCR complaints to allege \n20 exhaustive facts and legal theories with such particularity would be to import into Title IX a far more burdensome \n21 standard than applies even to pleadings prepared by counsel under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.13  \n22\n23\n                                                           \n24 13  Pleading requirements under Rule 8 are—by express congressional design—non-technical and extremely liberal.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)&(e).  Complaints prepared by pro se litigants are held to an even more forgiving standard than \n25\nthose prepared by counsel.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Cripps v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 980 F.2d \n1261, 1266 (9th Cir. 1992).  Exhaustive pleading is not required; indeed, “a complaint is not required to allege all, or \n26\nany, of the facts logically entailed by the claim.”  Bennett v. Schmidt, 153 F.3d 516, 518 (7th Cir. 1998) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  A complaint need not even specify the precise nature of the claim asserted where the facts \n27\nalleged put the defendant on notice.  Self Directed Placement Corp. v. Control Data Corp., 908 F.2d 462, 466 (9th \nCir. 1990).   \n28\n39 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

(under Title VII, a plaintiff’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n3 charge need not each and every fact that combines to form basis of each legal claim).  Since it is undisputed that \n4 Plaintiffs’ OCR complaints asserted Plaintiffs’ right to participate on the varsity wrestling team—a right that by \n5 UCD’s own analysis does not exist independently of program-wide noncompliance with Title IX, UCD is barred \n6 from strategically pleading ignorance now in an effort to stamp out Plaintiffs’ ineffective accommodation claims as a \n7 matter of law.  \n8 V.  CONCLUSION \n9 For each of the reasons argued herein and supported by the accompanying declarations, exhibits and other \n10 documents, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court deny UCD’s motion for summary judgment in its entirety. \n \n11\nDATED:     March 6, 2008         Respectfully Submitted, \n12  \n13        EQUAL  RIGHTS ADVOCATES \n \n14\n \n            By:   /s/   Noreen Farrell                 \n15\n        NOREEN  FARRELL \n16               Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n             \n17 Respectfully submitted, \n \n18        THE  STURDEVANT LAW FIRM \n            A Professional Corporation \n19  \n \n20          By:   /s/ Monique Olivier       \n        MONIQUE  OLIVIER \n21               Attorneys for Plaintiffs \n \n22  \nZ:\\417_Mansourian\\Pleadings\\MSJ OPPOSITION\\MSJ Opp - Brief Draft-FINAL.doc  \n23\n24\n25\n                                                           \n14  That the OCR complaint form itself does not request (or even provide space for) such particularity thoroughly \n26\nundermines UCD’s argument to the contrary.  (See ADF 77.)  UCD’s argument would result in a highly undesirable \nside effect:  students would be better off proceeding directly to litigation than first taking their concerns to school \n27\nofficials early if there was a risk that unless they exhaustively set forth all legal theories in an OCR complaint, their \nclaims would later be foreclosed. \n28\n40 \nPLAINTIFFS’ OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT  \nCASE NO.

INTRODUCTION \n2  In its December 8, 2010, order on the motion for summary judgment by the individual \n3  Defendants on Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Clause claim (arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983), this Court \n4  held that this claim was timely insofar as it was based on a claim of systemic discrimination \n5  impacting Plaintiffs through their filing of this case and graduation.  (Dkt. 509.)  This motion does \n6  not seek to disturb that ruling.  Rather, Plaintiffs move the Court to either clarify or reconsider its \n7  finding that part of that claim, specifically the removal of Plaintiffs from the wrestling program and \n8  the imposition of Defendants’ policy requiring women to wrestle-off against men, are time-barred, \n9  even though the Court found that evidence of such events would be relevant to Plaintiffs’ claims.  \n10  Given discussions with Defendants in pretrial preparations, Plaintiffs think it important to clarify this \n11  portion of the Court’s order and to ask the Court’s reconsideration of it based on the arguments set \n12  forth herein.   \n13  First, procedurally, the doctrines of law of the case and mandate precluded the Court from \n14  reopening the statute of limitations issue.  Both the Ninth Circuit and this Court previously held that \n15  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are timely because they arise from a systemic and facially \n16  discriminatory policy against women at the University of California at Davis (“UCD”) that took \n17  various forms against Plaintiffs specifically during their time at UCD.  (Dkt. 25 at 15:23-16:1.)  \n18  Mansourian v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 602 F.3d at 957, 974 (2010).  These holdings are the law of \n19  the case that this Court is bound to follow.  Plaintiffs  are entitled, therefore, to seek redress for all of \n20  the ways in which Defendants’ systemic violations of equal protection injured them, including \n21  Defendants’ removal of Plaintiffs from the wrestling program and their ongoing refusal to reinstate \n22  Plaintiffs and allow them to play against other women according to freestyle rules, as they had been \n23  permitted to do.   \n24  Second, substantively, no part of Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are barred because \n25  Plaintiffs challenge a systemic, facially discriminatory policy that took various forms, rather than \n26  one or two “discrete” acts.  Defendants’ removal of women from the roster and the 2001 wrestle-off \n27  were part and parcel of their systemic discrimination against Plaintiffs and other women in the \n28 \n1\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 7 of 20\n \n1  provision of athletic opportunities.  Indeed, Defendants’ policy of exclusion was renewed each year \n2  when it continued to deny Plaintiffs and other women female participation opportunities in wrestling \n3  and other sports, even after Plaintiffs filed suit as current students demanding this equal treatment.  \n4  A claim for damages arising from refused wrestling opportunities is necessarily timely in light of \n5  these circumstances.  The various ways in which Defendants violated Plaintiffs’ rights should not be \n6  parsed out for the purpose of damages or otherwise because all form the systemic policy of \n7  ineffective accommodation and discrimination challenged in this case.  The Court’s reading \n8  otherwise was in error.   \n9  Third, the Court’s decision erroneously relies upon Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber \n10  Co., Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 628, 127 S. Ct. 2162 (2007).  Not only was that case retroactively \n11  overturned by the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat. 5 (2009), a \n12  recent decision by the Seventh Circuit provides persuasive guidance on why the reasoning of \n13  Ledbetter no longer applies to Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims.  See Groesch v. City of \n14  Springfield, Ill, --- F.3d ---, 2011 WL 1105593, at *5-7 (7th Cir. Mar. 28, 2011).  While not \n15  controlling precedent, this intervening case warrants consideration by this Court.  Ledbetter’s \n16  holding that victims of discrimination cannot recover for the effects of past discrimination, even if it \n17  ever was applicable here, is no longer viable.   \n18  This Court “has the inherent power to reconsider and modify its interlocutory orders prior to \n19  the entry of judgment.” Smith v. Mass., 543 U.S. 462, 125 S. Ct. 1129, 1139 (2005) (quoting United \n20  States v. LoRusso, 695 F.2d 45, 53 (1982)).  The standards for reconsideration of final judgments \n21  and orders under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rules 59(e) and 60(b) provide guidance to \n22  reconsideration of interlocutory orders.  Reconsideration is appropriate where (1) the court is \n23  presented with newly-discovered evidence; (2) the court “committed clear error” or (3) there is an \n24  intervening change in the controlling law.  Carroll v. Nakatani, 342 F.3d 934, 945 (9th Cir. 2003).1  \n25                                                   \n1 There is no deadline for a motion for reconsideration of a court’s interlocutory order.  In the \n26 \nprocess of preparing for trial, it has become evident that Defendants intend to seek exclusion of \nevidence related to their removal of Plaintiffs and other women from the wrestling program, and \n27 \ntheir imposition of the wrestle-off policy that continued to apply to Plaintiffs until they graduated.  \n28  (continued on next page) \n2\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

In addition, reconsideration is warranted by an intervening change in the law.  If allowed to \n5  stand, the Court’s ruling with respect to the statute of limitations risks improperly limiting Plaintiffs’ \n6  right to recover damages for the harm they suffered at the hands of Defendants.  Plaintiffs \n7  respectfully request that the Court reconsider its ruling and find that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection \n8  claims are, in their entirety, timely.  \n9  II.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND PRIOR COURT RULINGS REGARDING \nTHE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS \n10 \nDefendants first argued that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are barred by the statute of \n11 \nlimitations in 2004 when they filed their initial motion to dismiss in this case.  At that time, this \n12 \nCourt rejected the argument, holding that Plaintiffs: \n13 \nare current UCD students who are currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly \n14  sex discriminatory practices.  (Complaint [Dkt. 1] ¶¶ 9-11, 22, 85-86, 88, 89.)  As \nUCD students, their claims accrue each and every day they are denied equal access to \n15  athletic participation and scholarship opportunities. (Id. at ¶¶ 22, 66, 88-89, 133, 159.)  \nAt the time plaintiffs filed the instant complaint, plaintiffs allege they should have \n16 \nbeen wrestling for UCD and receiving all the varsity benefits and scholarships \nprovided to male wrestlers but defendants refused, and continue to refuse, to date, to \n17 \nallow their participation.  (Id. at ¶¶ 9-12, 32, 42, 66, 88-89.) \n18 \n(Dkt. 25 at 12:2-13 (footnote omitted).)  It further concluded that Plaintiffs’ allegations thus \n19 \n“sufficiently state facts within the applicable statute of limitations (one or two years) to sustain \n20 \nclaims under Section 1983.”  (Id. at 15:23-16:1.)   \n21 \nOn June 5, 2007, Defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings.  Defendants argued that \n22 \nPlaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims were subsumed by Title IX.  Defendants also asked the Court to \n23 \nrevisit its earlier conclusion that Plaintiffs’ claims were timely.  (Dkt. 189 at 5:20-7:8; Dkt. 226 at \n24 \n                                                                                                                                                                   \n25  (Footnote continued from previous page) \n(See generally Defendants’ Points of Law in the Joint Pretrial Statement (Dkt. 533 at 18:6-20:10).)  \n26 \nThis position has highlighted the need to seek reconsideration/clarification of this issue.  \nAdditionally, the Groesch opinion was just issued on March 28, 2011.  Plaintiffs’ motion is therefore \n27 \ntimely and results in no prejudice to Defendants.     \n28 \n3\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

The Court granted Defendants’ motion, dismissing Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection \n2  claim without addressing Defendants’ renewed statute of limitations argument.   \n3  On January 11, 2008, Defendant Regents filed a motion which argued that it did not have \n4  notice of its own discriminatory acts and did not respond to them with deliberate indifference.  (Dkt. \n5  280-308.)  The Court granted the motion, dismissing the Title IX claim.  (Dkt. 368.)  Plaintiffs then \n6  filed a notice of appeal covering the dismissal of both their Title IX and their Equal Protection \n7  claims.  (Dkt. 376.) \n8  In the meantime, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in Fitzgerald v. \n9  Barnstable Schools Committee, 555 U.S. 246, 129 S. Ct. 788 (2009), which adopted Plaintiffs’ \n10  position that constitutional Equal Protection Clause are not subsumed by statutory Title IX claims.  \n11  Although Defendants conceded that the intervening case required reinstatement of Plaintiffs’ Equal \n12  Protection claims, they asked the appellate court to uphold the judgment on the grounds that they \n13  were untimely.2  The Ninth Circuit refused, holding that Plaintiffs’ claims are timely.  Mansourian, \n14  602 F.3d at 974. \n15  Upon remand, Defendants filed their fourth set of dispositive motions, this time asserting \n16  qualified immunity on Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims.  Defendants also reasserted their statute of \n17  limitations defense for a fourth time.  This Court rejected Defendants’ qualified immunity defense.  \n18  It also rejected Defendants’ statute of limitations argument with respect to Plaintiffs’ claims that \n19  Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause by denying women equal access to athletic \n20  participation opportunities.  (Dkt. 509 at 23:1-25:5.)  However, the Court found Plaintiffs’ claims are \n21  time-barred to the extent that they are based upon Defendants’ removal of Plaintiffs from the \n22  wrestling program and Defendants’ application of the wrestle-off policy.  (Id. at 20:5-22:11.)          \n23 \n                                                 \n24  2 It is worth noting that, in raising the statute of limitations defense with the appellate court, \nDefendants failed to inform the Ninth Circuit that this Court had already considered and rejected this \n25  defense when it ruled on their first motion to dismiss, and failed to include that relevant order for the \nNinth Circuit’s review.  Instead, Defendants pointed to this Court’s order on the motion for \n26  judgment on the pleadings and stated that this Court “did not rule on whether the section 1983 claim \nwas time-barred,” which, as this Court is aware, is patently incorrect.  (Declaration of Monique \n27  Olivier (“Olivier Decl.”), filed herewith, Ex. A.)  \n28 \n4\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

ARGUMENT \n2  Defendants’ efforts to have this Court rule in their favor on the grounds of statute of \n3  limitations gives life to the old adage “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”  Defendants have \n4  raised the same statute of limitations defense four times in this case.  While their persistence may be \n5  admirable, the most recent order on this issue procedurally violates the doctrines of law of the case \n6  and remand, substantively misapplies the law, and completely overlooks Plaintiffs’ claims as they \n7  existed in 2003 rather than 2001.  These errors threaten to deprive Plaintiffs a portion of the \n8  remedies to which they are entitled as full redress for the injuries they have suffered.       \n9  A.  The Law of the Case Doctrine and the Ninth Circuit’s Mandate Command the \nConclusion that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection Claims Are Timely. \n10 \nBoth this Court and the Ninth Circuit have previously held that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection \n11 \nclaims are timely in their entirety because they arise from a systemic and facially discriminatory \n12 \npolicy against women at UCD that took various forms against Plaintiffs specifically during their time \n13 \nat UCD.  These holdings are the law of the case that this Court is bound to follow.  Plaintiffs are \n14 \nentitled, therefore, to seek redress for all of the ways in which Defendants’ systemic violations of \n15 \nequal protection injured them, including Defendants’ removal of Plaintiffs from the wrestling \n16 \nprogram.  \n17 \nUnder the “law of the case” doctrine, “a court is generally precluded from reconsidering an \n18 \nissue that has already been decided by the same court, or a higher court in the identical case.” \n19 \nThomas v. Bible, 983 F.2d 152, 154 (9th Cir. 1993).  Courts should reopen a previously decided \n20 \nmatter in only three instances: (1) the first decision was clearly erroneous and would result in \n21 \nmanifest injustice; (2) an intervening change in the law has occurred; or (3) the evidence on remand \n22 \nwas substantially different.  Eichman v. Fotomat Corp., 880 F.2d 149, 157 (9th Cir. 1989); Milgard \n23 \nTempering, Inc. v. Selas Corp. of Am., 902 F.2d 703, 715 (9th Cir. 1990).   \n24 \nThe law of the case doctrine is “a judicial invention designed to aid in the efficient operation \n25 \nof court affairs,” United States v. Lummi Indian Tribe, 235 F.3d 443, 452 (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting \n26 \nMilgard Tempering, Inc., 902 F.2d at 715).  It is “founded upon the sound public policy that \n27 \nlitigation must come to an end,” Old Person v. Brown, 312 F.3d 1036, 1039 (9th Cir. 2002).  “Issues \n28 \n5\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

Westin Tucson Hotel, 53 F.3d 1484, 1497 (9th Cir. 1995); see 28 \n7  U.S.C. § 2106 (“The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdiction may affirm, modify, \n8  vacate, set aside or reverse any judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for \n9  review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or \n10  order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.”).  “The \n11  mandate rule serves two key interests, those of hierarchy and finality. … The principle of hierarchy \n12  is no empty shell. It protects the very value and essential nature of an appeal, ….”  Doe v. Chao, 511 \n13  F.3d 461, 465 (4th Cir. 2007).  “This is not to say that appellate courts are somehow superior or \n14  always correct, but only that our system has been served well by the availability of review and the \n15  need for appropriate review to be final.”  Id.; see United States v. Thrasher, 483 F.3d 977, 983 (9th \n16  Cir. 2007) (Berzon, J., concurring) (“there are … very limited circumstances … in which the district \n17  court may not be required to follow the directions we have given in our mandate”).  \n18  Based upon the doctrines of law of the case and mandate, this Court is bound by its prior \n19  determination, and the Ninth Circuit’s determination, that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are \n20  timely.  \n21  Defendants first argued that Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims were time-barred in their \n22  original motion to dismiss.  This Court disagreed, finding that Plaintiffs “claims accrue each and \n23  every day they are denied equal access to athletic participation.”  (Dkt. 25 at 12:5-7.)  Defendants \n24  made the exact same argument to the Ninth Circuit as an alternative basis to affirm judgment in their \n25  favor on Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims.  The Ninth Circuit considered and rejected it.  \n26  Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held: \n27  UCD first contends that the § 1983 claim for damages is precluded by the statute of \nlimitations and that the district court did not address this argument.  In fact, the \n28 \n6\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 12 of 20\n \ndistrict court considered and rejected the statute of limitations defense as to both the \n1 \nTitle IX effective accommodation and § 1983 equal protection claims in response to \nUCD’s original motion to dismiss. The court held that because the students claimed \n2 \nthat they were “currently being subjected to defendants’ allegedly sex discriminatory \n3  practices . . . their claims accrue each and every day they are denied equal access to \nathletic participation.” \n4 \nThe district court was quite correct. Section 1983 “is presumptively available to \n5 \nremedy a state’s ongoing violation of federal law.” AlohaCare v. Haw. Dep’t. of \nHuman Servs., 572 F.3d 740, 745 (9th Cir. 2009) (quotation omitted).  A plaintiff has \n6 \nadequately pled an ongoing claim if she can “show a systematic policy or practice \n7  that operated, in part, within the limitations period − a systematic violation.” Douglas \nv. Cal. Dep’t. of Youth Auth., 271 F.3d 812, 822 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted); \n8  see also Gutowsky v. County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding \nplaintiff’s § 1983 claims timely because she alleged “widespread policy and practices \n9 \nof discrimination [that] continued every day of her employment, including days that \nfall within the limitation period”).  A university’s ongoing and intentional failure to \n10 \nprovide equal athletic opportunities for women is a systemic violation. As the \n11  plaintiffs were students and therefore subject to the policy that allegedly \ndiscriminated on the basis of sex at the time they filed their complaint, their § 1983 \n12  claim is not time-barred.   \n13 \nMansourian, 602 F.3d at 973-74.  In a footnote, the Ninth Circuit added: “Nat’l R.R. Passenger \n14 \nCorp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002), held that each “[d]iscrete act[ ] such as termination, \n15 \nfailure to promote, denial of transfer or refusal to hire … constitutes a separate actionable ‘unlawful \n16 \n… practice’” for the purposes of triggering the statute of limitations period in a Title VII case.  \n17 \nMorgan left undisturbed our case law governing continuing systemic violations.”  Id. at 974 n.22. \n18 \nThus, the Ninth Circuit held – without qualification or limitation – that Plaintiffs’ Equal \n19 \nProtection claims are timely.  The Ninth Circuit did not find any part of Plaintiffs’ claims barred; \n20 \nrather, it expressly found the claims timely.  It remanded the case with this mandate. \n21 \nNevertheless, Defendants again made the same arguments based upon the same facts in its \n22 \n2010 motions for summary judgment to this Court on remand.  In doing so, Defendants did not argue \n23 \n(nor could they), that this Court should revisit the law of the case because an exception to that \n24 \ndoctrine applied here, i.e., the prior ruling was clearly erroneous, there was an intervening change in \n25 \nthe law, or the evidence on remand was substantially different.  Quite to the contrary, Defendants \n26 \npresented no basis whatsoever for this Court to stray from the law of the case or the mandate of the \n27 \nNinth Circuit.  See United States v. Pend Oreille County Public Utility Dist. No. 1., 135 F.3d 602, \n28 \n7\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 13 of 20\n \n1  608 (9th Cir. 1998) (district court properly applied law set forth in first appellate decision as law of \n2  the case, and its consequent holding would not be disturbed on appeal); Bean v. Calderon, 163 F.3d \n3  1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 1998) (“Heeding the interests of consistency and finality … we accordingly \n4  decline to disturb our own previous resolution of this procedural dispute.”).  Accordingly, this Court \n5  should not have revisited the statute of limitations issue, let alone partially reversed itself (and the \n6  Ninth Circuit). \n7  Indeed, examples abound in which courts have found that prior rulings on the statute of \n8  limitations are covered by the law of the case doctrine and should be undisturbed absent exceptional \n9  circumstances.  See, e.g., Minidoka Irrigation Dist. v. Dep’t of Interior of U.S., 406 F.3d 567, 573 \n10  (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that court was bound by law of the case to follow earlier appellate panel \n11  holding regarding statute of limitations, and plaintiff could not demonstrate any applicable exception \n12  to law of the case); Crowley v. Peterson, 206 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 1041 (C.D. Cal. 2002) (refusing to \n13  reconsider earlier order that the statute of limitations was tolled where plaintiffs failed to raise new \n14  facts relevant to the issue); Springfield v. United States, 873 F. Supp. 1403, 1407-08 (S.D. Cal. 1994) \n15  (prior ruling in district court on motion to dismiss with respect to statute of limitations was law of \n16  the case that could not be revisited), overruled on other grounds, 88 F.3d 750 (1996).  No such \n17  “exceptional circumstances” apply here.  Nor did Defendants raise any.  \n18  The law of the case doctrine puts the burden on Defendants to articulate a legally appropriate \n19  reason for allowing the Court to reverse its prior holdings.  Defendants failed to offer any reasons, \n20  let alone cognizable ones.  They merely made the exact same arguments they unsuccessfully had \n21  made three times before.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are timely in their entirety.  Thus, it was \n22  inappropriate for the Court to address the argument, let alone reverse it.  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit \n23  mandate could not be clearer and this Court remains bound by it.  Plaintiffs Equal Protection claims \n24  are timely in their entirety. \n25  B.  The Statute of Limitations Does not Bar any Portion of Plaintiffs’ Equal \nProtection Claims Because They Arise from a Systemic, Facially Discriminatory \n26  Policy and not a Single or a Series of Discrete Acts. \n27  This Court has held Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim is timely insofar that it relies on a \n28 \n8\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 14 of 20\n \n1  claim that Plaintiffs were harmed by systemic and facially discriminatory policy depriving them \n2  equal athletic opportunities through graduation.  Plaintiffs do not ask for reconsideration of this \n3  portion of the Court’s December 2010 order.  The Court, however, held certain examples of this \n4  ongoing policy time-barred, based on its finding that these were discrete acts outside the applicable \n5  statute of limitations.  In reaching this decision, the Court indicated its view that the Ninth Circuit \n6  “did not address the court’s rulings regarding plaintiffs’ claims based upon discrete acts.”  (Dkt. 509 \n7  at 18 n.15.)  However, Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims are not, in fact, “based upon” discrete acts.  \n8  Rather, Plaintiff contend that Defendants engaged in systemic discrimination in denying its female \n9  students equal athletic opportunities for decades and that this policy was applied to Plaintiffs in \n10  various forms throughout their years at UCD.  \n11  The Court’s ruling with respect to the statute of limitations of the Equal Protect claim reflects \n12  a fundamental misreading of Plaintiffs’ claims and applicable law.  Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection \n13  claims are not barred by any statute of limitations because they arise from Defendants’ systemic, \n14  facially discriminatory policies against female students.  Defendants discriminate against female \n15  students by segregating athletic teams by sex and then by allocating too few of those sex segregated \n16  opportunities to women.  The discriminatory allocation recurs each school year as Defendants decide \n17  which sports to sponsor for each sex and how many athletes to allow on each team for each sex.  As \n18  part of this unlawful policy, Defendants discriminated against Plaintiffs and other women by \n19  refusing to allow them female wrestling participation opportunities, wrestling against women using \n20  freestyle rules.  Defendants persisted in this discriminatory policy of exclusion by refusing to allow \n21  such opportunities, even after Plaintiffs filed suit as current students demanding them. \n22  This policy is no different from the facially discriminatory policies of the Mississippi \n23  University for Women, which barred men but not women from its nursing school, and the Virginia \n24  Military Institute, which barred women but not men from admission because of its adversative \n25  military training methods.  Miss. Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 1102 S. Ct. 3331 (1982); \n26  United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 116 S. Ct. 2264 (1996).  Those students were not barred \n27  from challenging the schools’ facially discriminatory policies just because those policies had existed \n28 \n9\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 15 of 20\n \n1  since the schools opened (over 100 years in the case of Virginia Military Institute).  The plaintiffs \n2  therein timely filed the cases because the policies still existed when they wanted to enroll but were \n3  barred from doing so because of those discriminatory policies.3   \n4  Rather than constitute “discrete” or separable acts from the policy of denying equal \n5  opportunity, Defendants’ removal of women from the varsity wrestling program and their continued \n6  refusal to provide female opportunities (including through the wrestle-off policy) are part and parcel \n7  of Plaintiffs’ claim of a facially discriminatory and systemic policy of discrimination that was \n8  ongoing when this case was filed.4  Those events were squarely before the Ninth Circuit as part of \n9  the factual predicate for Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims.  Yet, the appellate court did not \n10  determine that some events were actionable while others were not; instead, it held that Plaintiffs’ \n11  claims were timely.  Excising those events from Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claims is, thus, \n12  improper.   \n13  The Ninth Circuit and courts within the Ninth Circuit have understood and applied this \n14  concept accordingly.  See Douglas v. Cal. Dep’t. of Youth Auth., 271 F.3d 812, 822 (9th Cir.) (“if \n15  both discrimination and injury are ongoing, the limitations clock does not begin to tick until the \n16  invidious conduct ends” (citations omitted)), amended by 271 F.3d 910 (9th Cir. 2001); Gutowsky v. \n17  County of Placer, 108 F.3d 256, 259 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Californians for Disability Rights, Inc. \n                                                 \n18 \n3 The Seventh Circuit aptly addressed these statute of limitations issues in Palmer v. Bd. of \nEduc. of Community Unit School Dist., 46 F.3d 682 (7th Cir. 1995).  There, the parents of African-\n19 \nAmerican children asserted that the school assignment policy which the defendant adopted in 1987 \namounted to race discrimination.  The school raised a statute of limitations defense because the \n20 \nparents did not file the action until 1990.  The district court agreed and dismissed the case.  The \nSeventh Circuit reversed, holding that such an application of the statute of limitations would mean \n21 \nthat a student assigned to a segregated, inferior school in kindergarten would be condemned to \ncontinue in the inferior school environment if the parents failed to challenge the discrimination in the \n22 \nfirst two years of their children’s education.  The court poignantly noted that if the defendant’s view \nof the statute of limitations were correct, Brown v. Board of Education could not have been possible, \n23 \nbecause the challenged segregation has existed for over a century.  What mattered was that the \nstudents were then being subjected to a then-existing discriminatory policy. \n24 \n4 For example, in reaching its conclusion about the statute of limitations, this Court noted in \n25  its order that its analysis might be different if it had found evidence that Defendants continued to use \nthe wrestle-off policy within the limitations period.  (Dkt. 509 at 20-21 n.16.)  However, this Court’s \n26  focus on the occasion of a “wrestle-off” on October 2001 is misplaced.  Challenged here is \nDefendants’ facially discriminatory policy of excluding women from an equal number of \n27  participation opportunities, in its many forms. \n28 \n10\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

The Ninth Circuit noted that plaintiff \n10  “presents specific examples of discrimination which ‘are not the basis of her charge of \n11  discrimination’ but rather ‘are but evidence that a policy of discrimination pervaded her employer’s \n12  personnel decisions.  Indeed, Gutowsky contends that the widespread policy and practices of \n13  discrimination of which she complains continued every day of her employment, including days that \n14  fall within the limitations period.”  Gutowsky, 108 F.3d at 260 (citation omitted).  Similarly, \n15  Defendants’ removal of women from the varsity wrestling program and their imposition of the \n16  wrestle-off policy are simply ways in which Defendants enforced their continuing discriminatory \n17  policy and practice to deprive Plaintiffs of their opportunity to participate equally in athletics.  \n18  Plaintiffs should not be precluded from recovering damages for the specific ways in which \n19  Defendants’ systemic violations of equal protection injured them.  See Beasley v. Ala. State Univ., \n20  966 F. Supp. 1117, 1129-30 (M.D. Ala. 1997) (where allegations were that plaintiff’s right to \n21  participate in varsity athletics was violated in an ongoing, continual fashion throughout her time as a \n22  student and the university made no showing that it ended the discriminatory policy, even after the \n23  student ceased participating in the sport, but was still a student, “the alleged violation was renewed \n24  or repeated on at least a semester-by-semester basis,” and her claims were timely); see also E.E.O.C. \n25  v. Local 350, Plumbers & Pipefitters, 998 F.2d 641, 645 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that facially \n26  discriminatory policy may be challenged at any time); Reed v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., 613 F.2d \n27  757, 760-61 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that plaintiff stated timely claim by alleging policy of \n28 \n11\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

Instead, \n3  Defendants try to fit the square peg of individual, Title VII employment discrimination cases into the \n4  round hole of the inherently systemic, program-wide discrimination of sex segregated educational \n5  athletics.  Yet, even the cases upon which Defendants rely expressly state that they do not apply in \n6  circumstances such as this.  Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S. Ct. 2061 \n7  (2002); Ledbetter, supra, 550 U.S. 618. \n8  Morgan and Ledbetter were decided based upon the plain language of the Title VII statute \n9  itself and its unique administrative enforcement scheme, including its unique 300-day limitations \n10  period for filing administrative complaints.  The Supreme Court noted that by expressly including \n11  such a short administrative complaint process in the statute itself, Congress stated its intent to have \n12  such cases move along quickly so that employers do not have potential claims hanging over their \n13  heads for extended periods of time.  No such statutory administrative exhaustion or limitations \n14  period exists for Title IX.  No such expression of congressional intent exists for Title IX.  Nor does it \n15  make sense to apply it to sex segregated activities like athletics.  Morgan, 536 U.S. at 110-111.   \n16  Both Morgan and Ledbetter expressly stated that their holdings and reasoning do not apply to \n17  cases involving systemic or policy and practice discrimination.  Morgan, 536 U.S. at 115 n.9; \n18  Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 633-35.  Indeed, Ledbetter expressly reaffirmed the Court’s prior holding in \n19  Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S. Ct. 3000 (1986), which involved an employer’s \n20  segregation of employees by race and then its payment of employees at the “White branch” more \n21  than its payment of employees at the “Negro branch.”  There, the Court held that the longstanding \n22  existence of the policy did not excuse the continuance of the discrimination or preclude employees \n23  still covered by the policy from challenging it.  “To hold otherwise would have the effect of \n24  exempting from liability those employers who were historically the greatest offenders.”  Bazemore, \n25  478 U.S. at 395.  The Ledbetter Court went on to state that whenever an employer adopts a “facially \n26  discriminatory” pay structure, that policy can be challenged “as long as the structure is used.”  \n27  Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 634.  The Bazemore facts of segregation by race followed by allocation of \n28 \n12\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

Id.   \n4  The Court’s consideration of the statute of limitations for this claim is not dependent on an \n5  affirmative “act.”  The absence of opportunities is evidence of a continued discriminatory policy.  \n6  There is no evidence in the record that Defendants subsequently allowed women to participate in the \n7  wrestling program as women wrestling against women using unique freestyle rules.  Defendants do \n8  not claim otherwise.  The law does not require Plaintiffs to engage in the futile act of asking \n9  Defendants whether the policy still applies to them when their status, and the existence of the policy, \n10  remains unchanged.  See Angelucci v. Century Supper Club, 41 Cal. 4th 160, 168-69 (2007) (“We \n11  note that the federal Constitution uses the term ‘deny’ in the equal protection clause and other \n12  provisions, but we are unaware of any authority supporting the startling proposition that a right \n13  acknowledged by these provisions is not ‘denied’ if the victim is a passive sufferer of discrimination \n14  rather than a person who expressly demands his or her rights and is refused.”).  Moreover, as noted \n15  above, Plaintiffs did ask for women’s wrestling opportunities, as women competing against women \n16  using unique freestyles rules, when they filed suit.  UCD continued to refuse to this request and \n17  continued its policy of exclusion through Plaintiffs’ graduation.  Where Plaintiffs bring suit to \n18  challenge a facially discriminatory policy of exclusion (a policy that includes the continued refusal \n19  to provide wrestling opportunities) as a denial of equal protection, that claim must be timely in its \n20  entirety.  See, e.g., RK Ventures, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 307 F.3d 1045, 1063 (9th Cir. 2002) (facial \n21  challenge under First Amendment timely where statute enforced against plaintiffs during limitations \n22  period); Maldonado v. Harris, 370 F.3d 945, 955 (9th Cir. 2004) (expressing “serious doubts” that a \n23  facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute or policy “can ever be barred by a statute of \n24  limitations”). \n25  C.  Intervening Law Clarifies that Ledbetter Does Not Apply Here.  \nGrounds for reconsideration of this Court’s determination that part of Plaintiffs’ Equal \n26 \nProtection claim is time-barred also exist because of an intervening change in the law.  This Court’s \n27 \norder relies upon Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 628, for the proposition that if a defendant engages in a \n28 \n13\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 19 of 20\n \n1  “series of acts each of which is intentionally discriminatory, then a fresh violation takes place when \n2  each act is committed,” but the effects of such conduct “cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged \n3  conduct.”  Id.  (Dkt. 509 at 19:7-17.)     \n4  Even if the Ledbetter Court itself had not expressly excluded systemic and policy \n5  discrimination from its reasoning, Congress mooted its discrete acts and continuing violation \n6  reasoning entirely by enacting the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.5  In doing so, Congress stated that \n7  the Court misperceived congressional intent and thus misapplied the law.  It thus made the new law \n8  retroactive to the date before the Supreme Court issued the decision, so that it could be applied as if \n9  the Supreme Court decision had never been issued.6  Because part of the Court’s holding was \n10  retroactively overturned by Congress in 2009, it should not have been relied upon by this Court. \n11   The Seventh Circuit recently confirmed that the reasoning of Ledbetter is no longer viable in \n12  Groesch, supra, 2011 WL 1105593, at *5-7, holding that there is no “principled reason” to apply the \n13  accrual rule established by the Act to Title VII claims, but not extend that rule, and the reasoning \n14  behind it, to Equal Protection Clause claims that were subjected to the original Ledbetter decision \n15  only by way of analogy to begin with.  Id. at *5.  Although not controlling, Plaintiffs urge the Court \n16  to consider the thoughtful analysis set forth in Groesch, the first appellate opinion to consider the \n17  impact of the Ledbetter Act on the Ledbetter decision’s impact on Section 1983 claims.  The \n18  Seventh Circuit reasoned as follows:  \n19  if Ledbetter was understood to extend logically to Section 1983 claims, as, for \nexample, we had earlier understood Morgan’s Title VII reasoning to extend to \n20 \n                                                 \n5 The Act amends Title VII by providing that an “unlawful employment practice” occurs in \n21 \nthe following situations: (1) “when a discriminatory compensation decision or other practice is \nadopted,” (2) “when an individual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation decision or \n22 \nother practice,” and (3) “when an individual is affected by application of a discriminatory \ncompensation decision or other practice, including each time wages, benefits, or other compensation \n23 \nis paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A).   \n24 \n6 For example, in reaching its conclusion about the statute of limitations, this Court noted in \n25  its order that its analysis might be different if it had found evidence that Defendants continued to use \nthe wrestle-off policy within the limitations period.  (Dkt. 509 at 20-21 n.16.)  However, this Court’s \n26  focus on the occasion of a “wrestle-off” on October 2001 is misplaced.  Challenged here is \nDefendants’ facially discriminatory policy of excluding women from an equal number of \n27  participation opportunities, in its many forms. \n28 \n14\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO. S-03-2591 FCD EFB \n\nCase 2:03-cv-02591-KJM -EFB   Document 541    Filed 04/26/11   Page 20 of 20\n \nSection 1983 claims, then we see no reason that the Ledbetter Act would not now \n1 \nrestore our pre-Ledbetter precedent and allow us to extend the paycheck accrual rule \nto Section 1983 claims.   \n2 \n* * * \n3 \nNeither the Ledbetter decision nor the Ledbetter Act addresses constitutional claims \n4  asserted under Section 1983.  In the absence of any clearer directive, we believe the \nbest course is to treat the Ledbetter Act as removing the Ledbetter decision as an \n5 \nobstacle to following our earlier precedents, which recognized the paycheck accrual \nrule for all allegations of unlawful discrimination in employee compensation.  We \n6 \nhold that the paycheck accrual rule applies to pay discrimination claims under Section \n7  1983. \n8  Id. at *6 (citations & footnote omitted).   \n9  The application of Ledbetter to this case, which does not involve pay disparities at all but \n10  rather a facially discriminatory policy of a university and its officials that deprives women of equal \n11  opportunity in athletics, was already attenuated.  In light of the Ledbetter Act, and the reasoning in \n12  Groesch, it should not be applied to the claims here to deprive Plaintiffs of their right to seek redress \n13  for all of Defendants’ conduct that caused them injury. \n14  IV.  CONCLUSION \n15  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court reconsider its \n16  December 2010 holding regarding the application of the statute of limitations to Plaintiffs’ Equal \n17  Protection claims and that it find the claims are timely in their entirety.   \n18 \nDATED:  April 26, 2011        Respectfully submitted, \n \n19 \nTHE STURDEVANT LAW FIRM \n20  A Professional Corporation \n \n21 \nEQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES \n \n22 \nDUCKWORTH PETERS LEBOWITZ \nOLIVIER LLP \n23 \n \n24  EQUITY LEGAL \n \n25 \nBy:  /s/ Monique Oliver       \n              Monique Olivier  \n26 \nAttorneys for Plaintiffs \n27 \n28 \n15\n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION AND/OR CLARIFICATION; CASE NO.

(YES) \n  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  \nA. Introduction \n  \nWell before Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 was enacted, the University of California, Davis (UCD) had an \nestablished intercollegiate athletic program for its female students. UCD’s intercollegiate athletic program is rooted on \ntraditional notions of athletics at the varsity level, including competition for spots on the team roster and the right of the \ncoach to select those student-athletes who demonstrate the highest level of skill and ability to compete in the sport in issue. \nThis case arises from Plaintiffs’ belief that they were entitled to a spot on the wrestling team because they are female, \nwhether or not they possessed the skill and ability to compete at the intercollegiate level. While Plaintiffs and their amici \ndescribe this case in terms of a large-scale athletic accommodation claim that has broad-reaching consequences, in reality it \ninvolves events unique to fewer than five former UCD students. \n  \nB. Procedural History \n5 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n  \nPlaintiffs sued the Regents of the University of California and the Chancellor, Athletic Director, Associate Athletic Directors \nand former Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at UCD, claiming Defendants denied them equal athletic participation \nopportunities and financial assistance in violation of Title IX, retaliated against them, violated 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 by treating \nthem disparately on the basis of gender, and violated various state statutes. The factual allegations in the Complaint were \nbased almost exclusively on events relating to wrestling. (ER 6416-6430).1 “Class Plaintiffs” Mansourian and Mancuso \nsought to represent a class consisting of “all present and future female students at UC Davis who are denied equal athletic \nparticipation opportunities and scholarships in women’s wrestling by Defendants’ discriminatory actions.” (ER 6435). \n  \nPlaintiffs filed a motion for class certification in December 2005 (ER 6390-6404). Defendants opposed the motion on April \n4, 2006, raising a number of arguments including the bar of the statute of limitations and the fact that the Plaintiffs’ eligibility \nto participate in intercollegiate sports had expired or was about to expire, which affected their standing as proposed class \nrepresentatives. (SER 00368-00408). On the day Plaintiffs’ reply brief was due, the attorney representing them at the time \n(Ms. Galles) filed a motion to stay the action due to her health issues. (ER 6384-6389). Defendants filed a response to the \nmotion, responding to claims made by Ms. Galles that she had not had sufficient time to engage in discovery. (SER \n00354-00367). On April 18, 2006 the District Court issued an order staying the case. Judge Damrell set a status conference \nfor June 16, 2006 in order to give Ms. Galles time to find substitute or additional counsel. The parties were ordered to file a \njoint status report by June 6, 2006. (SER 00352-00353). The date of the status conference was later continued to July 28, \n2006. (SER 00350-00351). \n  \nMs. Galles did not comply with the Court’s order to file a joint status report. Instead, she filed another motion to extend the \nstay. (SER 00346-00349). Defendants filed a response asking that the Court go forward with the status conference as \nscheduled so that the parties could determine how much more time Ms. Galles needed to find other counsel. (SER \n00342-00345). Judge Damrell issued an order requiring Ms. Galles to submit either a substitution or a motion to withdraw by \nAugust 18, 2006. (SER 00341). Plaintiffs’ current counsel filed a notice of appearance on August 18th. (SER 00337-00339). \n  \nSeveral months after Plaintiffs’ new counsel appeared in the case they filed a motion to amend the complaint to add current \nstudents as plaintiffs and to expand the scope of the litigation to include claims regarding field hockey and rugby. The Court \ndenied the motion, finding that Plaintiffs had not been diligent in seeking leave to file an amendment and that the proposed \namendment would be prejudicial to Defendants because it changed the scope of the litigation. (ER 73-84). After the motion \nwas denied Plaintiffs took the motion for class certification off calendar and asked that the class claims be dismissed. (SER \n00127-00129). \n  \nDefendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on June 5, 2007 (SER 00130-334). After requesting and receiving \nsupplemental briefing (SER 00017-00026; 00001-00016), the Court granted the motion on all claims for relief except the \nclaim of ineffective accommodation under Title IX (ER 29-72). As a result, there were no claims remaining against the \nindividual Defendants. \n  \nDefendant UCD filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining claim. The motion addressed the merits of the claim \n(that UCD complied with Title IX under prong two of the three part test and thus was not required to add a women’s \nintercollegiate wrestling team). It also raised the issue of Plaintiffs’ failure to provide UCD with notice of their allegation of \nsystemic noncompliance with Title IX in regard to the women’s athletic program as a whole. (ER 6017-6061). The Court \ngranted the motion on the notice issue only, finding it to be dispositive. (ER 7-28). \n  \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  \nA. Women and Intercollegiate Wrestling at UCD \n  \nUCD is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Its intercollegiate wrestling team competes at the \nNCAA Division I level. (ER 4659-4660:9; 5984:7-9; 6024:21-24). The team competes with other schools in the Pac-10 \nConference,  using  collegiate  wrestling  rules.  The  competition  consists  of  dual  meets2  against  other  Pac-10  schools, \ninvitational tournaments and post-season championship contests. UCD has not declared wrestling to be a contact sport. Thus, \npursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 106.41 students of both genders may try out for the team. The head coach of the wrestling team has \n6 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nthe sole discretion to select team members. (ER 6025:2-14; 5984:10-5985:19; 4659-4661:2; 4670-4674). \n  \nAlthough Plaintiffs’ claims have been largely based on the myth that UCD eliminated a women’s wrestling team, in fact there \nwas never a separate women’s wrestling team at UCD. (ER 6025:16-6026:16; 5985:20-21; 5986:3-5987:7; 4661:3-8; \n4667:23-27; 4683:24-28; 4693:23-4694:2; 4694:27-4695:2). Over the years a few female students were permitted to practice \nwith the wrestling team in furtherance of their goal of competing in open tournaments3 or on the USA national women’s \nteam, rather than against other schools in the Pac-10. (ER 6026:17-6027:9; 5987:14-5988:12; 4928; 4929:21-23; 4930:10-24; \n4931:3-13; 4932:14-25; 4933:3-18; 4934:15-4936:6; 4938:9-21; 4938:25-4939:20; 4941:4-18). \n  \nMichael Burch was the coach of the UCD wrestling team between 1995 and 2001. His approach to the women wrestlers was \nconsistent with his belief that they did not have the skills required for competition at the level engaged in by the \nintercollegiate team. Burch allowed the few women who were interested in wrestling the extraordinary opportunity of access \nto the team’s facilities and to work out with the team without requiring them to compete for a spot on the team, roster as \nmales had to do. There were no schools in the Pac-10 that had women’s wrestling teams;4 thus in order to participate in a dual \nmeet the women would have had to wrestle against men in their weight class. By their own admission, they did not have the \nskill or strength necessary to do so. The women never wore a UCD uniform in the few open tournaments they participated in. \nBurch never attempted to offer athletic scholarships to the women until the spring of 2001, and did so only after he learned \nthat his contract would not be renewed for the following year. The material he submitted for the team media guides referred \nonly to goals and accomplishments of male wrestlers. Women’s wrestling was described in the guides as having “unofficial \nstatus.” (ER 6026:17-6028:25; 6029:27-6030:22; 5984:26-5985:17; 5988:13-19; 5988:23-5989:8; 5990:9-5992:19; 5993:5-8: \n5994:2-8;  4661:16-4662:9;  4670-4671;  4672:16-26;  4673-4674;  4695:1-17;  4770:2-8;  4771:17-20;  4772:17-4774:16; \n4775:4-7;  4793:24-4795:7;  4822:4823:8;  4824:17-20;  4825:22-4826:10;  4827:23-4828:11;  4891:23-4893:5;  4899:8-11; \n4946:17-19;  4947:21-4948:10;  4949:9-4951:1;  4952:9-12;  4967:22-4968:5;  4968:13-4969:7;  4974:1.4-4975:4; \n4976:5-4977:8; 5010; 5011:25-5012:1; 5023:9-5024:11; 4665:22-4666:2; 4667:21-4668:10; 5009; 5020:10-22; 5025-5026; \n5027:10-13;  5028:7-5029:22;  5030:16-22;  4954:13-24;  5191-5193;  4900:8-16;  4982:19-4983:12;  4985:19-24;  4700; \n4777:16-24; 4789:1-6; 4799:6-24; 4816:22-24; 5694-5734; 4953:11-25; 6547-6548). \n  \nB. Plaintiffs’ Participation in Wrestling at UCD \n  \nPlaintiff Mansourian participated in wrestling in her freshman year. Her participation was limited to attending practices and \nthe Aggie Open5 tournament. In the fall of 2001 she notified the new coach (who had replaced Burch) that participating on \nthe wrestling team was too exhausting for her because of other demands on her time and that she preferred to wrestle at the \nclub sport6 level. (ER 6030:23-6031:9; 5992:27-5993:8; 5993:12-20; 4899:22-24; 4890:6; 4891:23-4893:5; 4898:1-14; \n4925:1-11; 5237-5238; 4673:9-13). \n  \nPlaintiff Ng participated in wrestling for three years at UCD. During that time she went to only one off-campus tournament. \nShe did not compete on behalf of UCD at that event nor did Burch accompany her to the tournament. Although she professed \nto be a varsity wrestler, Ng confessed in her deposition that “...I have a fear of competing. And so I tend to avoid it when I \ncan. So that’s why I’m not exactly up for competing.” (ER 6031:10-6032:2; 5993:23-5994:12; 4966:14-21; 4973:21-24; \n4667:21-4668:2; 4697:22-4698:5; 4968:13-4969:7; 4974:14-4974:14-4976:8; 4977:21-4978:7; 4981:7-15). \n  \nDuring the time Plaintiffs Mansourian and Ng were enrolled as undergraduates a few other women occasionally participated \nin wrestling by coming to practice or competing in the Aggie Open tournament. Their limited participation ended due to \nfailure to submit required paperwork, academic ineligibility,  or because they  voluntarily quit. (ER 6027:10-6028:14; \n5988:13-5990:4;  4946:17-19;  4944:18-4945:20;  4947:21-4948:10;  4949:9-4951:1;  4952:9-12;  5009;  5013:22-25; \n5014:13-5015:23; 5023:9-5024:11; 4667:21-4668:10; 5020:10-22; 5027:10-13). \n  \nC. Roster Management and Burch’s Choices on Filling the 2000/2001 Team Roster \n7 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n  \nAs part of its commitment to gender equity in athletics, VCD uses a roster management program for its men’s teams. \nAlthough students of both sexes can try out for a place on the wrestling team, the campus considers it to be a men’s team \nbecause the NCAA does not sponsor women’s wrestling as an intercollegiate sport and because no women have ever \nqualified to regularly participate in intercollegiate wrestling against males. Thus, the wrestling team is subject to the roster \nmanagement program. (ER 6033:14-20; 5996:24-5997:4; 4677:23-27; 4678:21-4679:21; 5173; 4700; 4798:12-23). \n  \nIn the fall of 2000 Athletic Director Warzecka advised Burch that the roster for the wrestling team was limited to 30 spots. \nBurch negotiated an increase to 34 spots and then filled them all with males. He did not believe any of the women could \nactually compete on the team, and as a result, was of the opinion that they should not be counted towards the roster limit. \nWarzecka did not care whether roster spots were filled with males or females so long as Burch did not exceed the roster limit. \nHe disagreed with Burch’s position on the application of the roster limit to women. Allowing women who could not \notherwise earn a spot on the intercollegiate team to be members would be unfair to males who were not selected for \nmembership because they also lacked the necessary skill. (ER 6033:14-6034:5; 5997:5-5998:3; 4800:1-18; 4801:6-4802:7; \n5175-5176; 4803:7-4804:9; 4805:11-21; 4807:8-25; 4679:22-4680:19). \n  \nBurch did not tell Ng and Mansourian7 that he had not allotted any of the roster spots to them. Instead, in November, 2000 he \ntold them the Athletic Department administration did not support women’s wrestling and required him to remove women \nfrom the team. Even though they were not on the roster Burch allowed the women to continue to practice with the team for \nseveral more months. (ER 6034:6-19; 5998:4-13; 4806:3-19; 5178-5179; 4901:14-4904:1; 4907:3-10; 4923:5-10; 4986:8-24; \n4901:14-4906:13; 4986:8-4990:22; 4994:7-16; 4998:18-4999:20; 4801:24-4802:7; 4804:10-4805:19; 4806:9-4810:13). \n  \nD. O.C.R. Complaints and Investigations \n  \nIn April 2001 Ng and Mansourian filed a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education (OCR) \nin which they alleged they had been subject to discrimination because they could no longer participate on the wrestling team. \nThe complaint did not make reference to the overall women’s athletic program at UCD; it was restricted to Plaintiffs’ \nexperience with the wrestling team. (ER 6034-6035; 5998:15-5999:3; 4991:19-4992:2; 5201-5208; 4910:12-16; 4911:1-19; \n4912:5-8;  4724:22-4725:5;  4728:1-17;  4916:1-12;  4917:18-4919:1;  4995:20-4996:6;  4997:3-16;  5164;  4681:3-22; \n4662:10-28;  4699:22-4700:7;  4702:24-4703:10;  4728:1-17;  4730:22-4731:7;  4731:12-4732:2).  In  May  they  filed  a \nsupplemental OCR complaint setting forth a list of allegations pertaining to the wrestling team. Again, there was no reference \nto the athletic program as a whole or to female student-athletes in general. In June and August Plaintiffs filed two more OCR \ncomplaints, each of which addressed a specific issue pertaining to their experience with the wrestling team (Burch’s attempt \nto give them scholarships after he was told of his non-renewal and their claim that Burch’s non-renewal was an act of \nretaliation against them). (ER 6035; 5999:3-14; 4920:21-4921:7; 4922:5-22; 4924:1-12; 5002:11-24; 5211-5212; 5228-5231; \n5233-5234). \n  \nThe Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at UCD conducted an investigation shortly after he received the first OCR \ncomplaint. He concluded that Burch had (1) allotted the spots on the team roster to males because they were more qualified \nthan the women; (2) failed to tell the women they weren’t on the roster; and (3) allowed the women to continue to practice \nwith the team notwithstanding the fact he had not allotted a roster spot to them. Burch denied removing the women from the \nteam as did Warzecka, who noted that the coach is the person solely responsible for tilling the roster. The Vice Chancellor \nchose to resolve the issue by leaving the women on the team for the remainder of the 2000/2001 school year. If they were \ninterested in participating on the team the following year, they could compete for a roster spots as males were required to do. \n(ER 6035-6036; 5999:15-6000:12; 4732:3-4733:9; 4681:23-4682:9; 5166; 4726:19-4727:2; 5199; 5214-5215; 5914-5915). \n  \nThe campus worked with the OCR to resolve the complaints. It entered into a Voluntary Resolution Plan that confirmed UCD \nsupported the development of wrestling as a club sport for those students (male and female) who did not have the skills \nnecessary to compete at the intercollegiate level. It also supported the participation of any woman who, by reason of her \neligibility and qualifications, was selected for inclusion on the intercollegiate team. The Plan set forth clear criteria for \ninclusion on the intercollegiate team. Both men and women were encouraged to try out. The coach of the team would select \nthose athletes who demonstrate the highest skill and competitive ability in their weight class. OCR closed the case, finding \nthat no violation of Title IX had occurred. (ER 6036:21-6037:5; 6001:19-6002:12; 4727:3-28; 5184-5185; 5156-5162). \n8 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n  \nNg and Mansourian asked the Vice Chancellor whether UCD would consider having separate roster “caps” for males and \nfemales on the wrestling team. The campus considered the request and concluded it was not feasible, as there is an upper \nlimit to the number of students who can be accommodated on every intercollegiate team. Plaintiffs then asked if UCD would \nwaive the minimum number of students needed to form a club sport (ten) so that they could form a wrestling club sport team. \nUCD  agreed  to  do  so.  (ER  6036:5-20;  6000:12-6001:7;  6001:14-19;  4733:10-20;  4703:11-21;  5171;  4735:22-28; \n4736:25-4737:9; 4831; 4840:18-4841:19; 4892:20-4893:5). \n  \nE. Try-Outs in the Fall of 2001 \n  \nLennie Zalesky replaced Burch as the head wrestling coach. Consistent with the practice he had followed during his many \nyears of intercollegiate-level coaching and with the terms of the Voluntary Resolution Plan, Zalesky held try-outs for the \nteam in the fall of 2001 by having students in the same weight class “wrestle-off against each other. Ng and Mancuso \nwrestled off against each other, with Mancuso prevailing. Mancuso then wrestled off against a male in her weight class. She \nwas pinned. As the result of the wrestle-offs Zalesky cut a number of students including Ng, Mancuso and males who also \ndid not have the necessary skills. Mansourian did not try out for the team. (ER 6028:27-6029:11; 6031:3-9; 6032:3-11; \n6032:25-6033:10; 5990:13-5991:4; 5993:12-20; 5994:20-27; 5996:6-21; 6002:9-12; 4671:10-27; 4672:16-4673:8; 5095; \n5097:15-22;  5098:2-12;  5099:25-6000:25;  5104:21-5105:9;  4707:22-4710:5;  4718:14-23;  4777:16-24;  4789:1-15; \n4816:22-24; 4670:23-4671:27; 5238; 4673:9-13; 5000:23-5001:24; 5003:14-20; 5004:22-5005:20; 4672:16-4673:8; 5038; \n5061:21-5062:4; 5063:4-8; 5063:24-5064:20; 5065:1-5066:7; 4672:16-4673:8; 4838:25-4839:20; 4675:6-14). \n  \nF. UCD Complied With Title IX Under Prong Two \n  \nUCD agrees that it receives federal funding and thus is required to comply with Title IX regarding athletic opportunities. It \nalso agrees that OCR uses the three-prong test set forth on pages 6-7 of Appellants’ brief to assess whether an institution is in \ncompliance with Title IX regulations. Throughout the time period in issue UCD was in compliance under prong two of the \ntest.8 Prong two is satisfied when an institution can demonstrate a history and practice of athletic program expansion that is \ndemonstrably responsive to the developing interest and abilities of the underrepresented sex (usually females). If an \ninstitution is in compliance under any one of the three prongs, a Title IX ineffective accommodation claim against it will fail. \n  \nAs of the time Title IX was enacted UCD had intercollegiate teams for women in seven sports. Later in that decade it added \nwomen’s teams in gymnastics and cross-country. In 1983 UCD replaced women’s field hockey with women’s soccer, due to \na  decrease  in  available  competition  in  field  hockey.  (ER  6041:14-6042:2;  6003:23-6004:23;  4739:22-4740:  23; \n4700:17-4701:10; 5075: 5077:13-5079:7; 5082; 5084:15-18; 5085:12-17; 5086:7-5089:8; 5090:18-5092:4). \n  \nThe budget situation at UCD in the early 1990’s was grim. After passage of a student referendum that resulted in more \nfunding for intercollegiate sports, consideration was given to adding new women’s teams. UCD used a formalized process to \nselect the new sports consisting  of solicitation  of proposals, review  of the proposals by  various  committees, and a \nrecommendation by the Athletic Director. Proposals were submitted on behalf of water polo, badminton, field hockey, \nlacrosse and crew. Women’s intercollegiate water polo, lacrosse and crew were added in 1996 as the result of this process. \n(ER 6042:3-19; 6004:24-6005:19; 4725:16-4726:7; 4701:11-23; 4731:8-11; 5240-5253). \n  \nIndoor and outdoor track are different sports. Women started competing in indoor track events in 1993, but the sport was not \nofficially established at UCD until 1999. (ER 6042:20-6043:3; 6005:19-6006:6; 4743:22-4745:7; 4682:27-4683:20). \n  \nIn 2003 another call for proposals was made. Proposals were submitted on behalf of bowling, field hockey, rugby, horse polo, \nand golf.9 Golf was selected as the new women’s intercollegiate sport in 2004, with competition starting in 2005. (ER \n6043:4-6044:4; 6006:7-6007:23; 4684:1-4686:9; 4703:22-4704:3; 4689:22-4690:25; 5255-5260; 5262-5263; 5763-5893; \n5896-5903). The growth of UCD’s women’s intercollegiate program demonstrates the requisite history of program expansion \nunder prong two.10 \n  \n9 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nThere have been fluctuations in the number of women participating in intercollegiate sports over the years. The changes were \ndue to external factors such as a decrease in local competition or natural attrition. As an example, there are often fluctuations \nin  the  sport  of  rowing  because  it  relies  primarily  on  non-recruited  athletes.  (ER  6046-6047;  6007:24-6009:6; \n4747:23-4748:18; 4750:22-475126). \n  \nUCD has also demonstrated a practice of program expansion, as required under prong two. This is established by the fact it \ncreated a Title IX Officer position on campus many years ago; it has a Title IX grievance process available to students; it \nregularly conducts self-assessments on compliance; and it has established various committees showing a commitment to \nbroad-based input  on athletic issues. (ER 6046:16-27; 6012:4-18; 4714:8-4715:9; 5240-5253; 5255-5260; 5919-5929; \n5939-5959). \n  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  \nPlaintiffs Ng and Mansourian participated on the intercollegiate wrestling team to a limited extent prior to the imposition of \nroster management. By their own admission, they did not have the skills necessary to compete against the team’s Pac-10 \nopponents. The women came to practices and wrestled against other women in an occasional open tournament but did not \ncompete in matches between UCD and other Division I teams. The roster management program was implemented in the fall \nof 2000. It imposed an upper limit or cap on the number of members on each men’s intercollegiate team. While Burch was \nwilling to allow the women to attend practice and be part of the team when there was no limit on the number of \nstudent-athletes who could be on the team, once he was restricted to 34 wrestlers he did not want to allot any roster spots to \nthe women because, in his opinion, they were not competitive at the intercollegiate level. Unfortunately, rather than notifying \nthe women of the reason he did not want to give any of his limited roster spots to them, Burch falsely told them the Athletic \nDepartment administrators wanted them removed from the team. \n  \nNg and Mansourian were knowledgeable about Title IX and the OCR complaint process. Based on their erroneous belief that \nUCD administrators were responsible for their exclusion from the team, they filed complaints with the OCR demanding that \nthey be given “the same opportunity to wrestle as a male.” The complaints triggered an investigation, which in turn led to a \nwritten clarification that male and female students would be judged by the coach under the same criteria for the purpose of \ndetermining which students would be selected for the intercollegiate wrestling team. The complaint process worked in the \nmanner envisioned by the drafters of the Title IX regulations as the issue was resolved at the lowest possible level. \n  \nPlaintiffs were told in the spring of 2001 that UCD would not establish a separate roster cap for women on the wrestling \nteam. They were also told of the criteria that would be used to determine which students would be given a spot on the team \nroster. In the fall of 2001, those criteria were used by Coach Zalesky to select members of the wrestling team. Ng and \nMancuso competed for a spot on the team but were not selected because, in the opinion of the coach, they did not have the \nnecessary skills to wrestle against the team’s opponents. Mansourian chose not to try out for the team. \n  \nThe lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs more than two years after Ng and Mancuso were not selected for the team focused almost \nexclusively on events pertaining to their experience with wrestling at UCD and their contention that the campus had an \nobligation to either establish a separate wrestling team for women or to use different criteria for selection of women for the \nteam. Three years into the case and well after the scheduling order had been issued, Plaintiffs attempted to amend the \ncomplaint to widely expand its scope and to bring in current students as new plaintiffs. By that point the parties had engaged \nin extensive discovery based on the allegations in the original complaint; Plaintiffs had filed a motion for class certification \nand Defendants had filed an opposition to it; and Defendants had done significant preparation work on a motion for summary \njudgment. The District Court properly exercised its discretion and denied the motion to amend as untimely. \n  \nBy way of Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the District Court correctly found that the equal protection claim asserted in the \ncomplaint was time-barred. After that ruling the sole issue remaining was a Title IX ineffective accommodation claim based \non Plaintiffs’ contention that they were ready and able to wrestle at the intercollegiate level, and that sufficient interest in \nintercollegiate wrestling existed among UCD’s female students to field a women’s intercollegiate team. The United States \nSupreme Court has held that prior notice and a concomitant opportunity to cure is an essential prerequisite before a school \ncan be held liable for damages under Title IX. The District Court properly granted summary judgment on this one remaining \nclaim, finding that Plaintiffs had failed to comply with the notice requirement established by  Gebser v. Lago Vista \nIndependent School District because the complaints they filed with OCR related solely to their allegation that they were \ntreated unequally in regard to the manner in which members of the wrestling team were selected. The complaints did not \n10 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \ninclude allegations that UCD was not in compliance with Title IX in regard to athletic opportunities provided to its female \nstudents, that the interests and abilities of the female students were not being met, or that UCD had to add a women’s \nwrestling team in order to increase the number of female participants in intercollegiate athletics. Thus, the Gebser notice \nrequirement was not met. \n  \nIn 2007 the District Court dismissed the section 1983 claim asserted against UCD and the individual Defendants based on the \nholding in Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass’n., 453 U.S. 1 (1981). This year the \nSupreme Court confirmed that a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 can be asserted concurrently with a claim under Title IX. \nFitzgerald v. Barnstable, 129 S. Ct, 788 (2009). The ruling in Fitzgerald does not require that the section 1983 claims be \nreinstated. The individual Defendants are entitled to a finding of qualified immunity, and the claim for injunctive relief \nagainst UCD is time-barred. \n  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY DENIED THE MOTION TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT \nMore than three years after the suit was filed Plaintiffs made a motion to amend the complaint to add current students as \nplaintiffs. Plaintiffs also sought to greatly expand the scope of the suit by adding allegations pertaining to the sports of field \nhockey and rugby. The District Court properly denied the motion, finding that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the good cause \nrequired by F.R.C.P. 16 and that Defendants would be prejudiced by the late amendment. (ER 73-84). \n  \nA. Applicable Standard of Review \nIn their motion to amend Plaintiffs erroneously applied the standard relating to relief under F.R.C.P. 15. The law is clear that \nonce a scheduling order has been entered, F.R.C.P. 16 governs a proposed amendment of the pleadings. Johnson v. Mammoth \nRecreations, 975 F.2d 604, 608 (9th Cir. 1992). Parties seeking relief under Rule 16 must demonstrate good cause for the \namendment, including diligence. A District Court’s ruling on a motion to amend will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of \ndiscretion. The reviewing Court must be firmly convinced the decision lies beyond the pale of reasonable justification under \nthe circumstances. Id. at pp. 607, 609; Harman v. Apfel, 211 F.3d 1172, 1175 (9th Cir. 2000). \n  \nB. Plaintiffs Were Not Diligent In Moving To Amend \nPlaintiffs rely heavily on the fact that the case was stayed from April 2006 to late January 2007. They argue that but for this \n“unforeseen delay” at least one of the Plaintiffs (Mancuso) would still have been a current student as of the time the motion \nfor class certification was set to be heard. While it is true the nine month stay was triggered by a request from Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel because of medical issues, the lack of diligence on which the District Court made its ruling preceded the request for \nthe stay. \n  \nWell before they filed the motion for class certification (in December 2005) or the motion to amend (in January 2006) \nPlaintiffs were aware they were in danger of not having current student status at the time the motions were heard by the \nDistrict Court. Mansourian had graduated in June 2004. Ng had graduated in 2002. Plaintiff Nancy Chiang, who was still a \nparty at the time,11 left UCD in the fall of 2000. Mancuso had filed a notice of intent to graduate in the fall of 2005, and \nactually did graduate in June 2006. (ER 6160:10-25; 6253-6254; 6258; 6250; 6265; 6275-6276; 6282). The District Court \nrelied on Plaintiffs’ awareness of these dates in reaching the conclusion they had not acted diligently in seeking to amend \ntheir complaint. (ER 79:13-80:16). \n  \n11 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nPlaintiffs offered no justification as to why they had not moved to add new students as parties prior to the imposition of the \nstay in April 2006. The District Court concluded the motion to amend was triggered by recognition on the part of Plaintiffs’ \nnew counsel that they would be facing an uphill battle in regard to class certification. (ER 80:17-81:8; 84:4-11). Defendants \nhad argued that the existing Plaintiffs lacked standing to serve as class representatives because they had graduated or would \ngraduate shortly, and because their athletic eligibility had expired. Defendants also argued their claims were barred by the \nstatute of limitations. (SER 00395; 00400-00404). The District Court described the motion for leave to amend as an attempt \nto take a “second bite at the apple” as the proposed amendment specifically addressed deficiencies raised in Defendants’ \nopposition to the motion for class certification. (ER 80:17-81:8; 84:4-11). \n  \nThe primary reason for seeking leave to amend was not to “protect the class” as Plaintiffs argue on page 30 of their appellate \nbrief, but rather to attempt to save what likely would be a losing motion for class certification. This does not qualify as “good \ncause” under Rule 16. Bromley v. Mich. Educ. Ass’n and In re Cat. Micro Devices Securities. Litigation, cited by Plaintiffs \non page 30 of their brief, are inapposite at neither case addresses the diligence standard of Rule 16. \n  \nC. The Proposed Amended Complaint Would Have Significantly Expanded the Scope Of The Litigation \nThe proposed amended complaint would have greatly expanded the scope of the three-year old litigation because it added \nallegations pertaining to sports other than wrestling. Plaintiffs had been aware of the information on which they based the \nproposed amendment for years, as the result of discovery. (ER 81:9-82:5). Under such circumstances, the District Court \nproperly denied the motion. AmerisourceBergen Corp. v. Dialysis West, Inc., 465 F.3d 946, 953 (9 Cir. 2006) (delay of \nfifteen months between discovery of information used for amended pleading and motion justified denial, since opposing \nparty would have to “scramble” to deal with new facts in the eight months that discovery would remain open). \n  \nPlaintiffs’ contention that the “proposed amendment did not allege any new theories of liability or change the scope of the \naction” is belied by a comparison of the allegations in the original complaint and those in the proposed amended complaint. \nThe four original Plaintiffs did not allege they participated in, or wanted to participate in, any sport but wrestling. (ER 6411: \n¶ 9-6413: ¶ 12). The factual allegations in the original complaint focused exclusively on events pertaining to women \nwrestlers during the 2000/2001 school year. (ER 6416: ¶ 24-6430: ¶ 89). There is no reference to field hockey, rugby, or \nevents involving those sports. Plaintiffs did not disclose any field hockey or rugby players on their Rule 26 witness list. (ER \n6164:5-7). All of the expert witnesses disclosed by Plaintiffs in June 2005 related to wrestling. (ER 6164:24-6165:2). Class \nPlaintiffs sought to represent “the class of all present and future female students at UC-Davis who are denied equal \nparticipation opportunities and scholarships in women’s wrestling by Defendants’ discriminatory actions.” (ER 6435: ¶ \n108, emphasis added). The injunctive relief sought was reinstatement of athletic participation opportunities for women in the \nsport of wrestling. (ER 6460, emphasis added). \n  \nThe proposed amended complaint sought to add Kelsey Brust, Jessica Bulala and Laura Ludwig as plaintiffs.12 They were not \nUCD students in 2000/2001. Ludwig entered UCD in 2004, Bulala in 2005 and Brust in 2006. Ludwig wanted to compete in \nintercollegiate rugby or wrestling. Bulala and Brust wanted to compete in intercollegiate field hockey. (ER 6324-6359). The \nclass included in the proposed amended complaint was not limited to women who wanted to participate in intercollegiate \nwrestling but rather encompassed “the class of all present and future female students at UC Davis who are denied an equal \nopportunity to participate in varsity intercollegiate athletics and/or to receive financial assistance because of their sex.” \n(ER 6324, 6343, emphasis added). The proposed amended complaint alleged that UCD had violated Title IX by failing to \nestablish intercollegiate teams in field hockey and rugby, an allegation that was not raised in the original complaint. (ER \n6343-6345, 6346-6357). The relief sought by the proposed amended complaint included “reinstating women’s varsity \nwrestling and establishing other varsity athletic opportunities for women at UC Davis....” (ER 6358, emphasis added). \n  \nA defendant is justified in relying on the allegations stated in a complaint to determine the claims being made against it. \nPickern v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 457 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir. 2006). The District Court properly found that the scope of \nthe proposed amended complaint changed the face of the Mansourian litigation, and that UCD would be prejudiced by an \namendment at that late date. (ER 82:6-84:3). Its decision was well-reasoned, and does not constitute an abuse of its \ndiscretion. Accordingly, it should be upheld by this Court. \n  \n12 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nII. \nTHE CLAIMS UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983 WERE PROPERLY DISMISSED, NOTWITHSTANDING THE \nHOLDING IN BARNSTABLE V. FITZGERALD \nDefendants agree the Supreme Court recently resolved a split among the Circuits and held that Title IX does not preclude a \nconcurrent claim under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable, 129 S. Ct. 788 (2009). Although the District Court came \nto a different conclusion in ruling on Defendants’ motion to dismiss, the Fitzgerald opinion is not the end of the analysis. \nThis Court may uphold the dismissal on any basis fairly supported by the record. Romano v. Bible, 169 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th \nCir. 1999). \n  \nDefendants also agree with Plaintiffs’ statement of the standard for review of this claim. \n  \nA. The Section 1983 Claim Is Barred By The Statute of Limitations \nIn ruling on the motion to dismiss filed by all Defendants, the District Court concluded Plaintiffs were asserting both unequal \ntreatment and ineffective accommodation claims. (ER 37:20-24). Although Plaintiffs now deny making an unequal treatment \nclaim,13 a review of the factual allegations in the complaint leads to the inescapable conclusion that the “heart” of their claim \nwas that they were treated in an unfair manner on the basis of their gender in regard to their experience with the \nintercollegiate wrestling team. This claim is based on a number of discrete events, most of which occurred during the \n2000/2001 school year. (ER 6416: ¶ 24-6430: ¶ 89). In Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2003), this Court \nheld that a plaintiff cannot circumvent the bar of the statute of limitations by arguing that discrete acts were part of an alleged \npolicy or practice of discrimination which continued throughout the period in issue. Cherosky noted that the limitations on \nthe continuing violation doctrine set forth in Nat’l Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 110 (2002) apply with \nequal force to civil rights laws other than Title VII, the statute in issue in that case. Cherosky, supra, at 1246 n.3. \n  \nSince the District Court held that the section 1983 claim was preempted by the Title IX claim it did not rule on whether the \nsection 1983 claim was time-barred. (ER 61-66). However, its ruling that the Title IX unequal treatment claim was barred by \nthe statute of limitations applies with equal force to the section 1983 claim made against UCD and the individual Defendants. \n  \nThe fourth claim for relief alleges that Defendants violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In \norder to assert a section 1983 claim Plaintiffs must plead and prove that Defendants intentionally discriminated against them \non the basis of their gender. Sischo-Nownejad v. Merced Cmty College Dist. 934 F.2d 1104, 1111 (9th Cir. 1991). Plaintiffs \ncontend  that  “each  of  the  individual  defendants  participated  in  or  otherwise  had  authority  over  and  approved  the \ndiscriminatory  decisions  made  and  actions  taken  that  deny  Plaintiffs  of  their  right  to  equal  protection.”  The  claim \nincorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in the complaint, all of which pertain to specific incidents involving \nwomen wrestlers. (ER 6411-6430; 6449-6451). \n  \nThe statute of limitations for a section 1983 claim is controlled by the forum state’s limitation for a personal injury claim. \nPrior to January 1, 2003, the California statute of limitations for personal injury claims was one year. After that date the \nstatute was lengthened to two years. Jones v. Blanas, 393 F.3d 918, 927 (9 Cir. 2004). The proper analysis is whether the suit \nwas timely filed based on the limitation in effect at the time the claim ripened. Maldonado v. Harris, 370 F.3d 945, 954 (9th \nCir. 2004); Stanley v. Board of Trustees of the California State University, 433 F.3d 1129, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2006). \n  \nBased on the allegations in the complaint and the OCR complaints, the District Court held that the last alleged discrete \ndiscriminatory act took place in October 2001 when Plaintiffs’ OCR complaints were resolved. The one year statute of \nlimitations started running at that time. It expired in October 2002. (ER 48:25-49:6). Plaintiffs did not file their suit until \nDecember 18, 2003, more than a year after the statute expired. (ER 6407). The 2003 change in the statute of limitations does \nnot save the claim as it was already time-barred by the effective date of the statutory amendment. Maldonado, supra at 955. \n  \nB. The Section 1983 Claim Against The Individual Defendants Is Barred By The Doctrine Of Qualified Immunity \n13 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nDefendants raised the affirmative defense of qualified immunity in their answer to the complaint. (SER 00434). That issue \nwas never briefed to the District Court because it disposed of the section 1983 claim via the doctrine of preemption. \nReinstating the section 1983 claims against the individual Defendants because of the holding in Fitzgerald would be a waste \nof judicial resources, as the record provides more than sufficient grounds for a finding of qualified immunity. \n  \nThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct \ndoes not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. Harlow \nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Where there is no dispute as to the discretionary nature of the act(s) in question, the \nanalysis of a qualified immunity defense involves two steps: (1) a determination of whether the plaintiff has alleged a \nconstitutional violation, and (2) a determination of whether the right in issue was clearly established as of the time of the \nalleged violation. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001); Crawford v. Carroll, 529 F.3d 961, 977 (11th Cir. 2008). The Ninth \nCircuit has, at times, added a third step of inquiring whether the official’s action was reasonable, or has merged that issue \nwith the second step. Inouye v. Kemna, 504 F.3d 705, 712 n.6 (9 Cir. 2007). The Supreme Court recently clarified that \nanalysis of the Saucier elements need not be done in a strict “step one, step two” order. Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, \n818 (2009). The question of whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity is one of law for the court to decide. Elder \nv. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994). \n  \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment holds that no state actor may deny another person equal \nprotection of the law. It prohibits governmental decision-makers from treating differently “persons who are in all relevant \nrespects alike.” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992). Stated another way, the Equal Protection Clause requires that all \npersons similarly situated be treated alike. Jackson Water Works v. Public Utilities Comm’n, 793 F.2d 1090, 1092 (9th Cir. \n1992). It is undisputed that women at UCD were given an equal opportunity to try out for a spot on the men’s wrestling team. \nThose students (both male and female) who did not have the skill necessary to compete at the Division I level were not \nselected for the team. (ER 6036:21-6037:5; 6001:19-6002:12; 4727:3-28; 5184-5185; 5156-5162). There is no “clearly \nestablished law” holding that female students who want to be part of a men’s team must compete only against other women, \nor that a school must provide any other type of preferential treatment to them in regard to earning a place on the roster. \n  \nPlaintiffs contend that they do not have an equal shot at making the team because of the difference in strength between men \nand women, and thus UCD should have either created a separate category for them on the men’s team or started a separate \nwomen’s intercollegiate team. Neither is required by the Equal Protection Clause or by Title IX. “Title IX does not establish \na right to participate in any particular sport in one’s college and there is no constitutional right to participate in intercollegiate \nor high school athletics.” Gonyo v. Drake University, 837 F. Supp. 989, 994 (S.D. Iowa 1993); Miami University Wrestling \nClub v. Miami University, 302 F.3d 608, 615 (6th Cir. 2002). The law is clear that the school retains the sole discretion to \ndetermine which sports it will sponsor. Cohen v. Brown University (Cohen III), 879 F. Supp. 185, 208 (D. R.I. 1995). [“Of \ncourse, institutions do retain discretion when met with requests for the creation of a new team or the upgrading of an existing \nteam. They need not upgrade or create a team where the interest and ability of the students are not sufficiently developed to \nfield a varsity team.”] The mere fact that a few female students are interested in a sport does not require the establishment of \na team for them. Cohen v. Brown University (Cohen II), 991 F.2d 888, 898 (8th Cir. 1993); Roberts v. Colorado State Board \nof Agriculture, 998 F.2d 824, 830 n.10 (10th Cir. 1993). Further, there is no requirement that a school provide the same sports \nfor women as it does for men or vice versa. 44 Fed. Reg. No. 71413, p. 71417-71418. \n  \nThe Title IX regulations state that if an institution sponsors a team for members of only one sex in a particular sport and \nprevious athletics opportunities have been limited for the other sex, members of the other sex must be allowed to try out for \nthe team unless the sport in question is a contact sport. 34 C.F.R. § 106.41(b). It is this opportunity to try out- not a \nguaranteed spot on the team- that the law protects. Force v. Pierce City R-VI School Dist., 570 F.Supp. 1020, 1031 (W.D. \nMo. 1983). In Force, a girl wanted to try out for the boys’ football team. The school precluded her from doing so solely \nbecause of her gender. The Court held that she had the right to try out, but no constitutional entitlement to a place on the team \nif she didn’t have the necessary skill. “Nicole Force obviously has no legal entitlement to a starting position on the Pierce \nCity Junior High School football team, since the extent to which she plays must be governed solely by her abilities, by those \nwho coach her. But she seeks no such entitlement here. Instead, she seeks simply a chance, like her male counterparts, to \ndisplay those abilities. She asks, in short, only the right to try.” Ibid. Defendants in this case provided Plaintiffs “with the \nright to try” by deeming wrestling at UCD to be a non-contact sport and by allowing both men and women to vie for the \nlimited roster spots. There is no evidence UCD or any of the individual Defendants acted with the intent to treat women who \nyearned to be on the intercollegiate team any differently than men who had the same desire, and thus no basis for a finding of \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 687 (9th Cir. 2001). \n14 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n  \nThe record also does not support a finding that the individual Defendants acted unreasonably in regard to the events in issue. \nMansourian and Ng’s experiences with the wrestling team during Burch’s tenure differed from those of intercollegiate \nathletes in general. They were not required to compete for a place on the team or with the team’s opponents. Burch’s \nwillingness to carry them as part of the team waned when he was required to comply with roster management. His \nunwillingness to tell Plaintiffs that he did not want to use any of his limited roster spots for them created confusion and a \nbelief on the part of Ng and Mansourian (and later Mancuso) that they were entitled to a place on the wrestling team year \nafter year simply because they had practiced with the team previously. Defendants and the OCR cleared up any confusion \ncaused by Burch’s actions by entering into the Voluntary Resolution Plan which clarified the process used to determine \nmembership on the intercollegiate wrestling team. The process treats all students who hope to obtain a place on the team \nequally. Those who do not make the team have the opportunity to participate in wrestling by joining the club sport team. \nOCR issued a letter to UCD stating it considered the matter closed because of the implementation of the Plan. There was no \nfinding that UCD violated Title IX.14 (See p. 12-14, above). The OCR is charged with investigating Title IX violation claims. \n(See McCormick v. Sch. Dist Of Mamaroneck, 370 F.3d 275, 285-291 (2nd Cir. 2004) for discussion of history of Title IX \nstatute and regulations and Neal v. Board of Trustees, 198 F.3d 763, 770 (9th Cir. 1999) regarding deference given to \nadministrative agency charged with enforcing Title IX.) Defendants were justified in complying with a Plan that OCR had \napproved and in relying on the Title IX regulation pertaining to non-contact sport teams when it held try-outs for the \nwrestling team in the fall of 2001. Vasquez v. De La Rosa, 414 F. Supp.2d 124, 133 (D.P.R. 2006) This reliance cannot form \nthe basis for a claim that they knowingly violated an established right. \n  \nEven if this Court should determine that OCR and/or the regulations do not comply with constitutional requirements, \nDefendants are entitled to qualified immunity because there was no clearly established law on how a school should handle \ncompetition among men and women for spots on an intercollegiate wrestling team. Most of the jurisprudence addressing the \nissue of intercollegiate wrestling has revolved around the question of whether a men’s wrestling team may be eliminated for \npurposes of Title IX compliance. (See Neal v. Trustees and Miami University Wrestling Club v. Miami University, supra). \nDefendants are not aware of any case that requires the coach of an intercollegiate wrestling team to hold sex segregated \ntry-outs using different wrestling rules. A government official is “not expected to anticipate the law’s development or its \npossible application to a unique situation.” Warner v. Graham, 845 F.2d 179, 182 (8th Cir. 1988). Coach Zalesky’s approach \nof selecting members of the team based on their demonstrated skills and competitive ability is one used almost universally by \ncoaches of all teams at the intercollegiate level. If the Equal Protection Clause requires something else, that was certainly not \nevident based on existing case law. “For the law to be clearly established to the point that qualified immunity does not apply, \nthe law must have earlier been developed in such concrete and factually defined context to make it obvious to all reasonable \ngovernment actors, in defendant’s place, that what he is doing violates federal law.” Crawford, supra at 978. \n  \nTo the extent this Court views the equal protection claim more broadly (e.g. whether the campus complied with Title IX in \nregard to opportunities for women in athletics under prong two of the three-part test), the fact that two of the nation’s leading \nexperts on Title IX (Plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Lopiano and Defendants’ expert Dr. Grant) have conflicting opinions on that point \nis evidence that the law is far from clear or settled. (ER 6044:5-6046:15; 6009:17-6012:3; 4707-4719; 5939-5959; 5095; \n5103:19-5104:14; 5102:8-13; 5108:14-20; 5109:15-5110:9; 5111:14-5112:17; 5121:11-23; 5122:23-5123:13; 5124:4-15; \n5127:13-5128:4; 5131; 5132:10-22). \n  \nIn sum, Defendants Larry Vanderhoef, Robert Franks, Greg Warzecka, Pam Gill-Fisher and Larry Swanson are entitled to \nqualified immunity on the section 1983 claim that was asserted against them. \n  \nC. Reinstatement of The Section 1983 Claim For Injunctive Relief Against UCD Is Not Justified Because That Claim \nIs Moot \nPlaintiffs argue the District Court erred in dismissing the section 1983 claim against UCD on the basis of lack of standing. \nThey contend the District Court should have granted their motion to amend the complaint to add current students who would \nhave had standing to assert an injunctive relief claim. As set forth in section I, supra, the Court did not abuse its discretion in \ndenying the motion to amend. Thus, there is no reason to allow Plaintiffs to re-assert the section 1983 claim for injunctive \nrelief against UCD because none of them have standing to assert the claim for injunctive relief. They have all graduated from \nUC Davis and thus could not benefit from “reinstatement of athletic participation opportunities for women [at UC Davis] in \n15 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nthe sport of wrestling.” \n  \nIn conclusion, while the Supreme Court came to a different conclusion than the District Court on the issue of preemption, the \nholding in the Fitzgerald case does not warrant reversal of the lower Court’s rulings. \n  \nIII. \nTHE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF UCD. \nThe only claim that survived UCD’s motion to dismiss was the allegation of violation of Title IX under an ineffective \naccommodation theory. Specifically, the District Court found that Plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged that “they were able and \nready to wrestle at UCD and that sufficient interest existed in the female student population at UCD to field a women’s \nwrestling team.” (ER 51:1-52:25). When the case reached the summary judgment stage the question before the Court was \nwhether a triable issue of material fact existed on that claim. UCD argued in its motion for summary judgment that Plaintiffs’ \nfailure to notify  the campus they were attacking the women’s athletic program as a whole  barred their ineffective \naccommodation claim for damages. The notice that had been given via the OCR complaints related only to their unique \nexperiences with the wrestling team, which was couched in terms of an unequal treatment claim. (ER 6053:1-6060:13). \n  \nThe notice issue had been previously raised in the motion for judgment on the pleadings. (ER 54-55; SER 00010). Since there \nwas no way for Defendant to know in advance of the ruling on the motion for summary judgment whether the District Court \nwould agree with its position, UCD also argued the merits of the ineffective accommodation claim. (ER 6022:19-6023:11; \n6024:5-17; 6037:7-6052:28). The District Court granted the motion, finding that Plaintiffs failed to give UCD notice and an \nopportunity to cure the alleged ineffective accommodation claim. (ER 7-28). In so holding, Judge Damrell noted that this was \nan issue of first impression in this Circuit. The lower court’s ruling is consistent with the remedial nature of Title IX and a \nwell-established body of jurisprudence, and should be upheld by this Court. \n  \nDefendants agree that the standard of review for this claim is de novo review by this Court. \n  \nA. The Remedial Nature of Title IX \nRecipients of federal funding may not deny anyone the benefit of or the right to participate in educational programs or \nactivities on the basis of sex, nor may a recipient discriminate on the basis of sex in regard to such programs or activities. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1681. “Congress authorized an administrative enforcement scheme for Title IX. Federal departments or agencies \nwith the authority to provide financial assistance are entrusted to promulgate rules, regulations and orders to enforce the \nobjectives of [20 U.S.C.] § 1681. see 8 1682, and these departments or agencies may rely on ‘any...means authorized by law’ \nincluding the termination of funding, to give effect to the statute’s restrictions.” Davis v. Monroe County Bd. Of Education, \n526 U.S. 629, 639 (1999). \n  \nConsistent with the mandate of section 1682, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare15 promulgated regulations \nimplementing Title IX in regard to intercollegiate athletics. National Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Department of Education, \n366 F.3d 930, 933 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The regulations include 34 C.F.R. §106.71, which states that the procedural provisions \napplicable to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are adopted and incorporated by reference into the Title IX regulations. \nThis comes as no surprise, as courts have found that Title VI and Title IX are very close in nature. Cannon v. University of \nChicago, 441 U.S. 677, 694 (1979). During a Congressional discussion about Title IX prior to its passage Senator Bayh \n“lauded the enforcement procedures available under the former [Title VI] and ‘their great effectiveness and flexibility.’ ” Id. \nat 704 n. 40 (1979). \n  \nThe procedural provisions that apply to Title IX enforcement start at 34 C.F.R. §100.6. They emphasize Congress’ intent to \nhave complaints of alleged non-compliance investigated and remediated at the lowest possible level. Section 100.6 (a) \nrequires the federal agency charged with enforcement of Title IX to work with the recipients of federal funds to seek their \ncompliance with the statute. It also requires the agency to provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply \n16 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nvoluntarily with the regulation. Any person who believes Title IX has been violated may file a complaint with the \nDepartment  of  Education  (D.O.E.).  The  D.O.E.  investigates  such  complaints  via  its  Office  for  Civil  Rights.  If  the \ninvestigation confirms a violation, the D.O.E. must advise the recipient of this fact “and the matter will be resolved by \ninformal means whenever possible.” 34 C.F.R. § 100.7(b), (c). Section 100.8, which addresses the procedure to be used in \norder to effectuate compliance, again emphasizes that a failure or threatened failure to comply with Title IX should be \ncorrected by informal means whenever possible. In the event the drastic measure of termination of federal funding is \njustified, the regulation states that there must be a determination that voluntary compliance cannot be secured. \n  \nB. The District Court Properly Followed The Holding In Grandson v. University of Minnesota \nThe District Court relied on the holding in Grandson v. Univ. of Minn., 272 F.3d 568, 575 (8 Cir. 2001) in reaching its \ndecision on the motion for summary judgment. Grandson is well-reasoned and consistent with the goals of Title IX and the \nestablished body of case law holding that a recipient of federal funding cannot be held liable for claims of which it has no \nnotice. A complaint against the University of Minnesota was submitted to the OCR in 1996, prior to the filing of the \nGrandson suit. The complaint alleged that the University did not effectively accommodate the athletic interests and abilities \nof its female students; that it failed to provide females with proportional financial aid; and that it failed to provide female \nathletes with other benefits attendant to intercollegiate athletics. Id. at 572. The University and the OCR entered into an \nagreement to resolve the claims. As a result of compliance with the agreed-upon terms, OCR ceased its monitoring of the \nUniversity three years later. \n  \nGrandson filed suit in 1997 seeking injunctive relief and compensatory damages for the financial support she would have \nreceived as a member of the intercollegiate soccer team had the University not allegedly discriminated on the basis of sex. \nThree months later, a group of female students (“the Thompson plaintiffs”) filed a second action on behalf of themselves and \na purported class, seeking injunctive relief in the form of an order requiring the University to increase participation \nopportunities for women and add another NCAA Division I team. Ibid. The District Court struck the class allegations as \nfutile, and dismissed Grandson’s claim because she had failed to comply with the notice requirements of Gebser v. Lago \nVista Indep. Sch. Dist. 524 U.S. 274 (1998). \n  \nThe Eighth Circuit upheld the dismissal. It noted that this was the first Title IX athletics case where a class action was \nbrought after an OCR complaint was made against the athletic program as a whole; where the plaintiffs sought injunctive \nrelief over and above that a compliance plan that OCR found to be fully adequate; and where plaintiffs sought damages for \nalleged programmatic deficiencies that had been voluntarily resolved by the University. Id. at 573. The Court stated “We read \nGebser as requiring that an implied private action for systemic Title IX relief must likewise take a back seat to an agency \nproceeding that has led to satisfactory voluntary compliance.” Id. at 574. In Gebser, the Supreme Court noted that the express \nremedy set forth in Title IX “operates on an assumption of prior notice of alleged discrimination to the funding recipient and \nan opportunity to rectify any violation voluntarily.” Grandson, supra at 575 (citing Gebser, at 288). The Grandson court \nconcluded that when a plaintiff seeks monetary damages for a specific alleged Title IX violation, “Gebser requires prior \nnotice to a University official with authority to address the complaint and a response demonstrating deliberate indifference to \nthe alleged violation.” Id. at 576. \n  \nPlaintiffs argue that UCD’s acceptance of federal funding is sufficient to constitute notice that it will be held liable for a \nclaim of intentional discrimination on the basis of sex. They rely on the holding in Pennhurst State School v. Halderman, and \na sentence in Fitzgerald which states “Title IX has no administrative exhaustion requirement and no notice provisions.” \nWhile it is true the Supreme Court made that statement, it did so in the context of determining whether the preemption \ndoctrine bars a section 1983 claim brought concurrently with a Title IX claim. The Supreme Court did not discuss 34 C.F.R. \n§100.6-100.10 or 34 C.F.R. § 106.71 in Fitzgerald, nor was the question of whether the plaintiff gave the school district \nsufficient notice before the Court. UCD does not dispute that in exchange for accepting federal funds it is obligated to \ncomply with Title IX (see Pennhurst, supra, at 17). However, that “contractual” agreement alone is not sufficient to provide \nthe notice required to be given before a recipient can be held liable for damages. To hold otherwise would render the Title IX \nregulations moot and encourage students and their attorneys to file costly and extended litigation with the hope of receiving \nmonetary compensation and large attorney’s fee awards, rather than work with the school to address the perceived issues. \n  \nPlaintiffs and their amici claim that if Grandson is followed enforcement of Title IX will rest “solely in the hands of students, \n17 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nmany of whom are only children” and that “violations will go largely ignored.” They contend that students are generally \nignorant of Title IX and its enforcement mechanisms. This argument is undermined by the fact that the Plaintiffs in this case \nfiled not one, but four complaints with the OCR. In this case, the failure to give adequate notice of the ineffective \naccommodation claim was not the result of ignorance on the part of the Plaintiffs in regard to Title IX. Their OCR complaints \nfocused solely on wrestling issues because that is all they were interested in at the time they filed the complaints. The issue of \nalleged ineffective accommodation of the interests of UCD women undergraduates as a whole came to the forefront in \nPlaintiff’s case only after the District Court dismissed their unequal treatment claims as untimely and their state court claims \non other grounds. Nor do Plaintiffs or amici explain why it is easier for “children” such as Plaintiffs to deploy the resources \nnecessary to file a federal lawsuit than it is for them to initiate a complaint process. \n  \nFour years ago the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of notice in Title IX athletics cases in Jackson v. Birmingham \nBoard of Education, 544 U.S. 167, 181 (2005). “Title IX’s enforcement scheme also depends on individual reporting because \nindividuals and agencies may not bring suit under the statute unless the recipient [of federal funds] has received ‘actual \nnotice’ of the discrimination.” (citing to Gebser). The notice requirement is not onerous, nor does it hold students or other \ncomplainants to an unreasonably high standard. It may be satisfied by a formal OCR complaint, or something as informal as a \ncall to the Athletic Director. Either way, the student or other person complaining must let the institution know whether their \ncomplaint is a systemic one or limited to their specific situation. This notice gives the institution an opportunity to look into \nthe issue and take remedial action if warranted. The outcome of the OCR complaints filed by Plaintiffs demonstrates the \nwisdom of the notice requirement. The Voluntary Resolution Plan put to rest any confusion that may have existed about how \nmembers of the UCD intercollegiate wrestling team are selected. As in the Grandson case, Plaintiffs’ claim for damages \nshould “take a back seat to an agency proceeding that has led to satisfactory voluntary compliance.” \n  \nPlaintiffs describe Grandson as an outlier opinion16 and instead urge this Court to follow the holding in Pederson v. Louisiana \nState University, 213 F.3d 858 (5th Cir. 2000). The Pederson case is distinguishable in many aspects. The attitude and \nactions of LSU’s athletic administration towards women’s athletics was chauvinistic and backwards. The disparity between \nmale and female student population and athletic participation was very significant. Males comprised only 51% of the \nundergraduate  population,  but  71%  of  its  intercollegiate  athletes.  In  comparison,  women  comprised  49%  of  the \nundergraduates but only 29% of the intercollegiate athletes. Id. at 878. The District Court in Pederson found that the situation \nat LSU in regard to intercollegiate athletics was the result of “arrogant ignorance, confusion regarding the practical \nrequirements of the law, and a remarkably outdated view of women and athletics which created the by-product of resistance \nto change.”  Id. at 880. The Court of Appeals agreed, and noted  other evidence supporting a  finding of intentional \ndiscrimination including the fact that the Athletic Director referred to women student-athletes as “honey,” “sweetie” and \n“cutie” and said he would “love to help a cute girl like you” to one of the plaintiffs. The Athletic Director also stated that \nsoccer was a “more feminine sport” that deserved consideration for intercollegiate status because female soccer players \n“would look cute running around in their soccer shorts.” The Senior Woman’s Athletic Administrator slot, a position defined \nby the NCAA as the most senior woman in an athletic department, was occupied by a low level male employee of LSU. Id. at \n881. LSU did not even try to justify its actions; instead it argued that holding and following archaic values does not equate to \nintentional discrimination. \n  \nThe issue in Pederson was not whether the notice given by the plaintiffs was adequate, but whether the evidence supported a \nfinding that LSU intentionally discriminated against women. LSU relied on Gebser to support its argument that it was either \nignorant of or confused by Title IX and thus could not be found to have intentionally discriminated. The Court of Appeals \nfound that Gebser and the other cases requiring a showing of deliberate indifference actually supported the claim against \nLSU because it acted with deliberate indifference to the rights of female students. Id. at 882. “The proper test is not whether \nit knew of or is responsible for the actions of others, but is whether Appellees intended to treat women differently on the \nbasis of their sex by providing them unequal athletic opportunity, and, as we noted above, we are convinced that they did. \nOur review of the record convinces us that an intent to discriminate, albeit it one motivated by chauvinist notions as opposed \nto one fueled by enmity, drove LSU’s decisions regarding athletic opportunities for its female students.” Id. at 882. \n  \nIn comparison, there is no evidence that UCD was either deliberately indifferent to the issues pertaining to the women \nwrestlers or that it intentionally discriminated against them on the basis of gender. The campus cooperated with the OCR, and \nworked out an agreement that clearly delineated the criteria for membership on the intercollegiate wrestling team. The denial \nof Plaintiffs’ request that they be allowed to be part of the intercollegiate team over and above the roster maximum or that in \nthe alternative, UCD establish a separate women’s intercollegiate wrestling program for them, was neither unreasonable nor \ndiscriminatory. Allowing women who could not earn a roster berth via skill to be part of the intercollegiate team would result \n18 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nin discrimination against males who also did not have the necessary skill. There was insufficient interest and local \ncompetition to justify the establishment of a separate women’s wrestling team. The NCAA does not sponsor women’s \nwrestling, nor is it  on that agency’s list of “emerging sports.” Neither the NCAA nor the National Association  of \nIntercollegiate Athletics offers a women’s wrestling championship. During the time period in issue, the only local source of \npossible intercollegiate competition for women wrestlers was Menlo College in California and Pacific University in Oregon. \nThose schools are not members of the Pac-10 conference and UCD does not compete against them. During the years Burch \nwas at UCD, there were never more than four women at any one time participating in wrestling on campus. Neither Plaintiffs \nnor any other person had ever submitted a proposal that women’s wrestling be sponsored as an intercollegiate sport at UCD. \n(ER 5982:22-5983:21; 5990:3-4; 6006:12-14; 6014:10-22; 4651-4653; 4674:9-17; 4684:1-10; 4717:24-4718:4; 4776:12-16). \n  \nThe  fact that UCD made the decisions referenced above is not sufficient to  establish intentional discrimination. As \nrecognized in Jackson and by this Court in Lovell v. Chandler, 303 F.3d 1039, 1058 (9th Cir. 2002), there must either be \nfacial discrimination or a deliberate act designed to violate the law, such as retaliatory conduct. Neither exists here. \n  \nC. The District Court Properly Concluded That Plaintiffs’ OCR Complaints Did Not Place UCD on Notice Of Their \nIneffective Accommodation Claim \nThis case is a mirror image of Grandson. Ms. Grandson attempted to sue for damages arising from her specific experience \nwith the soccer team. She unsuccessfully attempted to use prior complaints relating to the women’s athletic program as a \nwhole for purposes of Gebser notice. Here, Plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to use their OCR complaints, which related \nsolely to their claim they were treated differently than male wrestlers, to serve as notice that they were attacking the women’s \nathletic program as a whole and seeking damages for alleged failure to adequately accommodate the interests of all women \nstudents. The April, 2001 OCR complaint filed by Ng stated “There has [sic] been females on the wrestling team for the past \nfive years. This year, after the first month of practice, the Athletic Directors told us that we were no longer allowed to be on \nthe team.” The complaint went on to provide specifics of the alleged actions of the Athletic Department administrators. Ng \nconcluded “I want and deserve the same opportunity to wrestle as a male does [sic]. The Athletic Administration will not \nallow me to wrestle, nor any other female, and I strongly believe it is due to my sex.” The complaint is devoid of any \nreference to women’s participation in other sports at UCD, or the women’s OCR complaint. Again, the allegations related \nsolely to the wrestling team and her perception that women were treated unequally. (ER 5211-5212). That complaint was \nfollowed by two others, each of which focused exclusively on Plaintiffs’ complaints about the wrestling team. (ER \n5224-5231; 5233-5234). None of the complaints referenced the overall athletic program. Campus administrators understood \nthe complaints to relate solely to the wrestling team, not to the intercollegiate athletics program as a whole (ER 6059:16-20; \n5988:23-5989:3; 4681:3-22; 4662:10-28; 4702:24-4703:10; 4728:1-17; 4731:12-4732:2). \n  \nThere is no evidence that OCR’s investigation of the complaints spanned beyond issues pertaining to wrestling. (ER \n23:15-27:3). The campus worked with OCR to devise a resolution that would clarify the requirements for membership on the \nwrestling team. In closing its investigation, OCR stated “As indicated above, wrestling is a contact sport and thus is exempt \nfrom any requirement that an intercollegiate athletic team include both men and women. Inasmuch as the University has \nchosen to provide an intercollegiate athletic wrestling team that is open to both men and women, it has undertaken to provide \nequivalent benefits, services, and opportunities, as required. OCR has determined that, contingent on implementation of the \nVRP, the issues raised by this complaint are resolved.” (ER 6001:19-6002:8; 5155-5162). The District Court properly found \nthe OCR complaints did not put UCD on notice that Plaintiffs were raising a claim of ineffective accommodation. Rather, the \nclear message from the OCR complaints was that they were making a claim of alleged unequal treatment in regard to \nwrestling. (ER 20:10-22:3). \n  \nPlaintiffs’ argument that publicity about the women wrestler’s claims sufficed as notice of an ineffective accommodation \nclaim is without merit. They point to evidence relating to newspaper coverage of protests relating to their allegation that Mr. \nWarzecka removed them from the wrestling team and to the involvement of a member of the State Assembly. The newspaper \ncoverage did nothing more than notify the campus that Plaintiffs believed they were entitled to be part of the wrestling team \nover and above the roster limit. The involvement of the member of the State Assembly in the fray did not give the campus \nnotice of anything other than the fact that she and her chief of staff accepted the Plaintiffs’ claims at face value and chose to \nchampion their cause for a short period of time. It is worth noting that less than a year later, that same Assembly member \nrecognized  Ms.  Gill-Fisher  as  her  Assembly  District  “Woman  of  the  Year”  because  of  Gill-Fisher’s  efforts  and \n19 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \naccomplishments in women’s collegiate athletics. (ER 6016:5-10; 6016:5-10; 5145; 5146:2-4; 5147:20-5148:16; 5149:7-10; \n5150:7-5151:21; 5195-5197). Neither public debate nor politics qualify as sufficient notice. Grandson, supra, 576. \n  \nSimilarly, internal campus documents pertaining to UCD’s Title IX compliance efforts from as far back as 1976 do not \nconstitute sufficient notice. The Title IX athletic regulation allows an institution to choose its method of compliance under \nthe three-part test. These are flexible standards, not hard and fast requirements. The drafters purposely chose to use \namorphous terms such as “substantially proportionate” in regard to prong one compliance, and “history and continuing \npractice of expansion” in regard to prong two compliance. Without a bright-line test to follow, it is not surprising \nadministrators at schools that take Title IX seriously engage in internal discussions about whether the standards are being met \nand whether there is room for improvement. If courts allow documents reflecting such discussions to be used as de facto \nnotice of an alleged violation even in the absence of a specific complaint by a student, it will have a chilling effect on a \nschool’s willingness to engage in open and robust discussion on the issues of compliance and continued improvement of its \nathletics program. \n  \nIn conclusion, Defendants urge this Court to adopt the reasoning of the Eighth Circuit, follow the holding in Grandson, and \naffirm the ruling of the District Court in granting summary judgment. \n  \nD. In The Event This Court Disagrees With the District Court On The Issue Of Notice, the Case Should Be Remanded \nTo The Lower Court For a Ruling On The Remaining Issues Raised In The Motion For Summary Judgment \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to reverse the ruling on the motion for summary judgment and return the case to the District Court \nfor trial. Defendants urge the Court to uphold the rulings made by the District Court, and to dismiss the section 1983 claim on \nthe basis of qualified immunity and the bar of the statute of limitations. \n  \nThe issue of notice was only one of four arguments raised in the motion for summary judgment. (ER 6017-6061). The \nremaining arguments were (1) UCD complied with Title IX under prong two of the three part test, based on its history and \npractice of program expansion; (2) UCD did not eliminate the opportunity for women to try out for the wrestling team, nor \ndid it eliminate a “women’s wrestling team”; and (3) there was no evidence of intentional discrimination on the basis of \ngender. (ER 6037-6058). The lower court did not rule on these arguments because it decided the case solely on the notice \nissue. (ER 7-28). While it is true this Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, appellate courts routinely remand \na case to the lower court for a decision on an issues it had an opportunity to address, but did not. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable, \nsupra, 798 (“Ordinarily, ‘we do not decide in the first instance issues not decided below.”). \n  \nIt is particularly appropriate for this Court to send the case back to the District Court if it reverses on the notice question, as \nthe issue of whether a school complies with Title IX’s three part test is a judgment call for the trial court that will not be \ndisturbed on appeal absent a finding of unreasonableness. Cohen v. Brown University (Cohen II), supra, at 903. UCD \ncontends it complied with the three part test under prong two. OCR’s 1996 Clarification of the three part test does not provide \nstrict numerical formulas or “cookie cutter” answers to questions that are inherently unique to each school in question. The \n1996 Clarification states the following in regard to prong two compliance: \n“There are no fixed intervals of time within which an institution must have added participation opportunities. Neither is a \nparticular number of sports dispositive. Rather, the focus is on whether the program expansion was responsive to the \ndeveloping interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.” (Addendum to Defendants’ brief, p. 20). \n  \n  \nOnly a handful of courts have decided the issue of whether a college or university complies with Title IX under prong two. In \neach of those cases, the athletic program in issue bore no resemblance to the women’s program at UCD. See e.g. Cohen v. \nBrown (Cohen III), supra; Roberts v. Colorado State Bd. Of Agriculture, supra; Pederson v. LSU, supra. UCD had an \nestablished women’s intercollegiate sports program prior to the passage of Title IX. The campus was a founding member of \nthe Association of Intercollegiate for Women, which was the governing body for women’s intercollegiate athletics before the \nNCAA agreed to include women in 1981. (ER 6041; 6003:23-6004:3; 4700:17-4701:3; 4739:22-28; 4740:1-10). Over the \nyears, UCD has consistently expanded its women’s program by adding new sports in response to the developing interests and \nabilities of its female students. It discontinued field hockey as an intercollegiate sport in 1983 because of a lack of local \ncompetition and declining interest, but immediately replaced it with women’s soccer, a much more popular sport. (ER \n20 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n6041-6042; 6004:15-23; 4701:4-10; 4740:16-23). The elimination of a team does not per se negate compliance under prong \ntwo; the 1996 Clarification states that the circumstances surrounding the elimination must be taken into consideration. \n(Addendum to Defendants’ brief, p. 21). In 1996 UCD added three new sports for women all at once. (ER 6042:3-19; \n6004:24-6005:19; 4725:16-4726:7; 4701:11-23; 4731:8-11; 5240-5253). The campus contends that adding three sports at the \nsame time demonstrates a continuing history of program expansion for women, and that the concurrent addition of three \nsports benefitted women more than stringing the expansion out over six to nine years by adding one new team at a time. \nSeveral  years  later  UCD  added  women’s  indoor  track  as  a  separate  sport.  (ER  6042:20-6043:3;  6005:19-6006:6; \n4743:22-4745:7; 4682:27-4683:20). In 2003 it started the process again for proposals for the addition of another women’s \nsport. Golf was selected as the result of that process. (ER 6043:4-6044:4; 6006:7-6007:23; 4684:1-4686:9; 4703:22-4704:3; \n4689:22-4690:25; 5255-5260; 5262-5263; 5763-5893; 5896-5903). \n  \nPlaintiffs contend the addition of three sports in 1996 is no different than the addition of one sport, and that the passage of \ntime between the 1996 expansion and the addition of golf in 2003 disqualifies UCD from relying on prong two. Plaintiffs \nalso contend that, contrary to the express language of the 1996 OCR clarification, a school may never rely on prong two if \nthere are downward fluctuations in the participation numbers for women. Finally, in their quest to recover damages, Plaintiffs \nrely heavily on events that took place at UCD in the 1970’s and 1980’s, years before they attended the school. The District \nCourt is better suited to rule in the first instance on the arguments made by each side and to rule on evidentiary issues, in the \nevent this Court believes reversal is appropriate. \n  \nShould this Court choose to review the entire motion for summary judgment de novo, there is sufficient evidence in the \nrecord on which this Court may affirm the District Court’s judgment in favor of Defendants other than on the notice issue. \nValdez v. Rosenbaum, 302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir. 2002); see also Sicor Ltd. v. Cetus Corp., 51 F.3d 848, 860 n.17 (9th \nCir. 1995). (“[W]e may affirm a summary judgment on any ground finding support in the record, whether or not relied upon \nby the trial court.”). However, in the event the Court takes that approach Defendants request an opportunity for supplemental \nbriefing in order to elucidate the points raised below but not considered by the District Court in its ruling. \n  \nV. \nCONCLUSION \nThe District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint. The motion was filed \nwell after the time for amending the pleadings had expired, and was little more than a futile attempt to overcome \ninsurmountable problems that had been indentified in Defendants’ opposition to their motion for class certification. The \nSupreme Court has ruled that a section 1983 claim may be concurrently maintained with a Title IX claim. That ruling does \nnot affect the outcome of this case, as the individual Defendants are shielded from liability under the doctrine of qualified \nimmunity, and the section 1983 claims against them and UCD are barred by the statute of limitations. \n  \nFinally, the District Court correctly applied the Gebser notice requirement to the Title IX claim and found that Plaintiffs’ \nOCR complaints did not alert the campus to their claim that the women’s athletic program as a whole failed to accommodate \nthe interests and abilities of all female undergraduates. The notice requirement does not stifle compliance with Title IX. \nRather, it provides an opportunity for students and their schools to engage in meaningful discussion about perceived or actual \ninequities and for the school to take remedial action if necessary. Plaintiffs did not receive the outcome they sought from the \nOCR process, which was a berth on the intercollegiate wrestling team notwithstanding their lack of ability to earn one based \non skill. This does not amount to gender discrimination or form the basis of a lawsuit. Title IX does not require a school to \ngive preferential treatment to women who want a place on a men’s team or to provide separate teams for each gender in each \nsport sponsored. All that is required is an equal chance to try out for a team. Plaintiffs were given that opportunity. \n  \nDefendants ask that judgment in their favor be affirmed. In the event this Court disagrees with the District Court on the notice \nissue, Defendant Regents of the University of California requests remand so that the District Court may rule on the remaining \nissues raised in its motion for summary judgment. \n  \n21 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \nAppendix not available. \nFootnotes \n \n1  ER refers to Appellants’ Excerpts of the Record. SER refers to Appellees’ Supplemental Excerpts of the Record \n   \n2  A dual meet is a contest between two teams. \n   \n3  This refers to a tournament that is open to anyone who signs up, whether or not they are a university student. \n   \n4  At one point in time there was one woman on the Stanford University wrestling team who wrestled against a male from anther \n  school during one dual meet. She did not compete regularly against other Pac-10 schools. \n \n5  The Aggie Open was an annual fundraising event. It was open to anyone, whether or not they were a student. \n   \n6  Club sport teams compete with club teams from other schools. The level of skill necessary to compete at the club level is usually \n  less than that required for intercollegiate competition, and the demands on club sport athletes’ time is less than the demand placed \non intercollegiate athletes. \n \n7  Plaintiff Mancuso did not enter UCD until the fall of 2001. \n   \n8  Although for a number of the years at issue UCD had more female than male intercollegiate athletes, it has not sought to claim \n  compliance  under  the  proportionality  test  of  prong  one  because  there  has  been  a  substantial  predominance  of  women \n(approximately 56% during the time in issue) in the undergraduate population. \n \n9  Notably, neither Plaintiffs nor any other person submitted a proposal on behalf of women’s wrestling. \n   \n10  The 1996 Clarification issued by the OCR provides several hypotheticals designed to provide guidance to schools on compliance \n  under prong two. One of the hypotheticals involves a school (Institution C) that had seven women’s sports at the inception of its \nwomen’s program in the mid-1970’s. It added another team in 1984 and upgraded a club team to varsity status in 1990 in response \nto a request by the club and NCAA surveys showing a significant increase in participation in that sport at the high school level. The \nschool had a plan to add another varsity sport for women in 1996. OCR stated “Based on these facts, OCR would find Institution C \nin compliance with part two because it has a history of program expansion and is continuing to expand its program for women in \nresponse to their developing interests and abilities.” (Addendum to Appellees’ Brief, p. 21) \n \n11  Chiang voluntarily dropped out of the case in March 2007. \n   \n12  Brust, Bulala and Ludwig later filed a Title IX suit of their own. That litigation has been identified by Judge Damrell as related to \n  this case. See Appellees’ Request for Judicial Notice. \n \n13  See footnote 3 of the A.O.B. The complaint asserts that Plaintiffs Ng and Mansourian were part of the UCD wrestling program and \n  that they were later removed from it via an event they call the “No Females Directive.” Plaintiffs further alleged Defendants treated \nfemale wrestlers less favorably than male wrestlers because males were given the opportunity to wrestle and were not subject to the \n“No Females Directive.” (ER 6411: ¶ 9; 6413:¶ 12; 6417: ¶ 30; 6423: ¶¶ 57-59; 6442: ¶ 130). Such allegations are consistent with \nan athletics unequal treatment claim. Pederson v. LSU, 213 F.3d 858, 865 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000) \n \n14  In paragraph 72 of their District Court complaint Plaintiffs allege that “OCR concluded that UC-Davis had discriminated against \n  the women wrestlers by issuing the No Females Directive.” This is not true. See E.R. 5156-5162. \n \n15  The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education subsequently took over as the federal agency responsible for Title IX \n  enforcement, including investigation of complaints. \n \n16  They argue the Eighth Circuit has not followed its own opinion, citing to Chalenor v. University of N.D., 291 F.3d 1042 (8th Cir. \n  2002). The issue in Chalenor was whether a university violates Title IX by eliminating a men’s team in order to comply under \nprong one. The issue of notice was not raised in that case. \n \n \n   \n22 \n \n\nArezou MANSOURIAN, et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v...., 2009 WL 2444221...   \n \n \n \n \n23 \n ",
