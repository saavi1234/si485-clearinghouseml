    "summary": "<p>On November 26, 2004, the plaintiff brought this action pro se under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division. While the plaintiff had been a pretrial detainee in a minimum-security facility, Maricopa County jail officials ordered a search of his entire housing unit. The plaintiff alleged that during the search, a female training cadet conducted a partial strip search and pat down of his groin area despite the availability of male detention officers nearby. He also alleged that the cadet had grabbed his groin, which constituted sexual harassment and abuse.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff alleged that the search violated his right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches, his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws and substantive due process, and his right under the Eighth Amendment to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Plaintiff named the cadet, the cadet's supervisor, and Maricopa County Sheriff's Department as defendants.</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, 2007, the court (Judge Neil V. Wake) dismissed Plaintiff's equal protection claim but denied Maricopa County's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment and Eighth Amendment claims. 2007 WL 9723160. The Court also appointed counsel to represent Plaintiff at trial.</p>\r\n<p>On June 19, 2007, the defendants moved to dismiss based on the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but the court denied the motion as untimely the following day.</p>\r\n<p>Following the presentation of evidence, both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law. The court (Judge Neil V. Wake) granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the cadet's supervisor and Maricopa County. The court also ruled as a matter of law that the search was constitutionally valid. With the female cadet as the only remaining defendant, the court narrowed the issues to be presented to the jury. On August 16, 2007, the jury found for the cadet defendant on all counts. The District Court entered judgment in favor of all defendants.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On May 18, 2009, in a published opinion by Judge Sandra S. Ikuta, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment. The Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiff had not sufficiently alleged discrimination for an equal protection claim, that the search was not punitive and therefore did not violate his substantive due process rights, and that the search was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it was based on security and staffing needs. 565 F.3d 1205.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit subsequently granted rehearing en banc. On January 05, 2011, the Ninth Circuit reversed the panel in a published opinion by Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the search did not violate the plaintiff's equal protection or substantive due process rights, but held that the cross-gender strip search was unreasonable as a matter of law and violated Plaintiff's rights under the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the District Court's entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of the cadet's supervisor and Maricopa County was reversed, and the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 629 F.3d 1135.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, but the Court declined to hear the case on June 6, 2011.</p>\r\n<p>On remand, the defendants moved on August 24, 2021 to exclude the issue of emotional damages and punitive damages from the future trial. Judge Neil V. Wake issued an October 24, 2011 opinion partially granting the motion. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to emotional damages because that issue had been addressed in the jury trial and couldn't be retried. Regarding the punitive damages, the court held that the plaintiff could not get punitive damages from the supervisor because the supervisor was now only part of the lawsuit in his official capacity, as a representative of Maricopa County, and plaintiffs cannot get punitive damages from counties under &sect; 1983. As to the cadet, the court held that the plaintiff would have to establish the cadet had &ldquo;evil motive or intent,&rdquo; which the record did not indicate. Therefore, the court ordered further briefing from both parties on that issue. 2011 WL 5434240.</p>\r\n<p>The following month, on November 21, 2011, the court issued an order denying punitive damages because the plaintiff had not provided any additional support for the cadet's \"evil motive.\" Therefore, the court granted only nominal damages of $100 to the plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiff moved for attorneys' fees on December 5, 2011, for both trial and appellate counsel. The defendants settled the fee issue with trial counsel, and the plaintiff had not moved for attorneys' fees in the Ninth Circuit, so the court denied the motion for attorneys' fees for appellate counsel on December 30, 2011. The case is now closed.</p>",

Before the Court are Defendants’\n18 Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 39), Plaintiff’s Responses (Doc. # 42, 43, 45), and\n19 Defendants’ Reply thereto (Doc. # 44).  The Court will dismiss Count II of Plaintiff’s First\n20 Amended  Complaint  for failure to state a cl aim  and grant in part and deny in part\n21 Defendants’ motion. \n22 Also before the court are Plaintiff’s Motion for Pre-Trail Order (Doc. # 49), which is\n23 difficult to understand, but the which is moot in light of the denial of Defendants’ Motion for\n24 Summary Judgment.  Also before the court is Plaintiff’s Motion to Allow U.S. District Judge\n25 to Rule on this Case and Not a Jury Trial (Doc. # 50).  Plaintiff demanded jury trial in his\n26 complaint (Doc. # 1).  “A dem and for trial by jury m ad as herein provided m ay not be\n27 withdrawn without the consent of the parties.”  Fed. R. Civ.P. 38(d).  Therefore, Plaintiff’s\n28\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 2 of 9\n1 Motion to Allow U.S. District Judge to Rule on this Case and Not a Jury Trial (Doc. # 50)\n2 will be denied.  \n3 I. Procedural History\n4 Plaintiff filed a First Am ended Complaint on June 14, 2005, against Defendants\n5 Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, Detention Officer O’Connell, and Captain Peterson\n6 (Doc. # 13).  Specifically, Plaintiff alleged that during a training session for new officers at\n7 the Durango Jail on October 28, 2004, O’Connell frisked Plaintiff, grabbed his genitals\n8 twice, and then “ramed [sic] her index finger through the crack” of his buttocks (Doc. # 13\n9 at 4).  Plaintiff claimed that he was only wearing boxer shorts at the time of the search and\n10 there was no reason for O’Connell to touch him.  In addition, Plaintiff claimed there were\n11 more than ten m ale officers present who could have conducted the search rathe r than\n12 O’Connell, a female officer.  Plaintiff furthera lleged more than eighty inmates witnessed the\n13 search and, as a result, he suffered psychological trauma, mental anguish, embarrassment,\n14 public humiliation, emotional distress, and scarring (Doc. # 13 at 4).   Plaintiff specifically\n15 presented three claims for relief based on the search—violations of his Fourth, Eighth, and\n16 Fourteenth Amendment rights (Doc. # 13 at 4-6). \n17 Plaintiff further claimed that because Arpaio was responsible for the policies and\n18 procedures at the jail he was responsible for instituting a policy, practice, or custo tmhat gave\n19 rise to the illegal search.  And Plaintiff argued that Peterson was responsible because he was\n20 O’Connell’s superior and observed the incident but failed to intercede (Doc. # 13 at 4-6).\n21 Defendants  O’Connell, Arpaio, and Peterson filed a n  Answer to the First Am ended\n22 Complaint (Doc. # 28).\n23 II. Failure to State a Claim\n24 The Court is required to screen complaints brought by prisoners proceeding in forma\n25 pauperis or raising claim s regarding their conditions of confine ment.  See 28 U.S.C. §\n26 1915(e)(2); 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(c).  The Court must dismiss a complaint or portion thereof at\n27 any time if the Plaintiff has raised claims that are legally “frivolous or malicious,” that fail\n28 to state a claim  upon which relief m ay be granted, or that seek m onetary relief from a\n- 2 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 3 of 9\n1 defendant who is im mune from such relief.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2); 42 U.S.C. §\n2 1997e(c).\n3 A.   Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n4 Equal protection requires that “all persons similarly situated shall be treated alike”\n5 Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982);  Gilbrook v. City of Westminister, 177 F. 3d 839,\n6 871 (9th Cir. 1999) (in order to state an equa l protection claim, the plaintiff must allege\n7 “unequal treatment of people similarly situated”).  A law that does not burden a fundamental\n8 right or target a suspect class will be upheld as long as the law is rationally related to a\n9 legitimate government interest.  Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996); Coakley v. Murphy,\n10 884 F.2d 1218, 1221-22 (9th Cir. 1989). All that is needed to uphold state action under a\n11 rational basis test is a finding that there are “plausible,” “arguable,” or “conceivable” reasons\n12 which may have been the basis for the state’s action.  Jackson Water Work,s 793 F.2d 1090,\n13 1094 (9th Cir. 1986) (quoting Brandwein v. California Board of Osteopathic Exaimners, 708\n14 F.2d 1466, 1472 (9th Cir. 1983)).\n15 For purposes of equal protection, prisoners are not a suspect class.  Webber v.\n16 Crabtree, 158 F.3d 460, 461 (9th Cir. 1998); McQueary v. Blodget,t 924 F.2d 829, 834 (9th\n17 Cir. 1991).  Further, inmates are not entitled to identical treatment as other inmates merely\n18 because they are all inmates.  See Norvell v. Illinois, 373 U.S. 420 (1963).  When a suspect\n19 class is not implicated, the mere demonstration of inequality is not enough to establish a\n20 violation of the equal protection clause; the complainant must allege invidious discriminatory\n21 intent.  McQueary, 924 F.2d at 834-35.  In addition, conclusory allegations alone do not\n22 establish an equal protection violation absent proof of invidious discriminatory intent.  See\n23 Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Housing Dev. Corp. , 429 U.S. 252, 265 (1977).\n24 When a suspect class is not im plicated, a court m ust determine whether the alleged\n25 discrimination is “patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitim ate\n26 governmental interest.”  Vermouth v. Corrothers, 827 F.2d 599, 602 (9th Cir. 1987) (internal\n27 quotations omitted).  \n28\n- 3 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 4 of 9\n1 Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege that he is a member of a suspect class.  Moreover,\n2 Plaintiff has neither alleged nor demonstrated that Defendants’ conduct was the result of\n3 purposeful or invidious discrimination, or that the conduct bore no rational relationship to\n4 a legitimate governmental interest.  Accordingly, the claim  will be dism issed without\n5 prejudice.  \n6 III. Summary Judgment\n7 Defendants  moved for sum mary  judgment  on January 18, 2007 (Doc. # 39).\n8 Defendants argued that they are entitled to summary judgment because (1) Plaintiff failed to\n9 establish that the suffered a physical injury as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) and (2) frisk,\n10 body, or pat-down searches are legitimate means of securing penal institutions (Doc. # 39 at\n11 3-4).  \n12 A. Standard\n13 A court must grant summary judgment if the pleadings and supporting documents,\n14 viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, “show that there is no genuine\n15 issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n16 law.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).\n17 When considering a summary judgment motion, the evidence of the non-movant is “to be\n18 believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.”  Ande rson v. Liberty\n19 Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  These infere nces are limited, however, “to those\n20 upon which a reasonable jury might return a verdict.”  Triton Energy Corp. v. Square D. Co,.\n21 68 F.3d 1216, 1220 (9th Cir. 1995).  \n22 Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of sum mary judgment against a party who, after\n23 adequate time for discovery, fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of\n24 an element essential to that partys' case, and on which the party will bear the burden of proof\n25 at trial.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-23.  Rule 56(e) compels the nonmoving party to “set forth\n26 specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial” and not to “rest upon the mere\n27 allegations or denials of [the party’s] pleading.”  The nonmoving party must do more than\n28 “simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”  Matsushita\n- 4 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 5 of 9\n1 Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp,. 475 U.S. 574, 586-87 (1986).  There is no issue\n2 for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the non-moving party.  Anderson, 477\n3 U.S. at 249.   Summary judgment is warranted if the evidence is “merely colorable” or “not\n4 significantly probative.”  Id. at 249-50. \n5 B. Physical Injury\n6 Defendants first contend that Plaintiff’s action for damages must be dismissed because\n7 he has not suffered the requisite physical injury required under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) (Doc.\n8 # 39 at 3).  Defendants argue that because “Plaintiff has neither alleged nor established any\n9 physical injury [Plaintiff’s action] should be dismissed as a matter of law” (id. at 4).\n10 Under §1997e(e), “[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined\n11 in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while\n12 in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).  The physical\n13 injury “need not be significant but must be more than de minimis.”  Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d\n14 623, 627 (9th Cir. 2002).  The physical injury requirement applies only to claims for mental\n15 or emotional injuries and does not bar claim s for compensatory, nominal or punitive\n16 damages.  Id. at 630.  \n17 In Oliver, the Ninth Circuit found that back and leg pain, a painful canker sore, and\n18 undefined injuries from an assault by another prisoner were not more than de minimis.  Id.\n19 Here, Plaintiff has not alleged any physical injury.  He thus fails to satisfy the requirement\n20 under § 1997e(e) and therefore is not entitled to damages for emotional injury.  See Id. at\n21 627-29.\n22 This conclusion, however, does not bar Plaintiff’s claims for compensatory, nominal,\n23 and punitive damages that are not premised on emotional injury.  In Oliver, plaintiff sought\n24 punitive damages, which the court construed as “consistent with a claim  for nominal\n25 damages.”  Id. at 630.  It determined that even absent physical injury, a prisoner was entitled\n26 to  seek com pensatory,  nominal  and punitive dam ages  premised  on violations of his\n27 Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Id. at 629-30.  In his First Am ended Complaint, Plaintiff\n28 alleged  a violation of his constitutional rights and specifically sought declarative,\n- 5 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 6 of 9\n1 compensatory, and punitive damages in his request for relief (Doc. # 13 at 7).  Thus, to the\n2 extent that Plaintiff has actionable claims for compensatory, nominal, and punitive damages\n3 based on violations of his Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights, his claims are not barred by\n4 § 1997e(e).  As a result, Defendants’ motion will be granted in part and denied in part on this\n5 basis.\n6 C. Fourth Amendment Claim\n7 Count III of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint alleges that his Fourth Amendment\n8 rights  were violated by the   allegedly  unreasonable search conducted by O’Connell.\n9 Specifically, Plaintiff averred that O’Connell grabbed his genitals twice and humiliated him\n10 in front of ten other detention officers and eighty inmates.\n11 The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right of the people to be se cure against\n12 unreasonable  searches, and its protections are not extinguishe d  upon incarceration.\n13 Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 322-33 (9th Cir. 1988).  A right of prisoners under\n14 the Fourth Amendment not to be subjected to cross-gender, clothed, pat-down searches has\n15 not been recognized by the Ninth Circuit.  See Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1524-25\n16 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc); Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495 (9th Cir. 1985).   Strip\n17 searches that are “excessive, vindictive, harassing, or unrelated to any legitiamte penological\n18 interest,” however, may be unconstitutional.  See Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332.\n19 Defendants primarily argue that because Plaintiff was clothed in boxer shorts and his\n20 body cavities were not searched the search was merely a “frisk search” that did not violate\n21 his constitutional rights.  Additionally, Defendants argue the search was constitutional\n22 because it was conducted (1) to dem onstrate to other detention officers how to properly\n23 search inmates and (2) in accordance with Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office policy DH-31.\n24\n25\n26\n1  Policy DH-3 defines a Frisk (Body) Search as “[c]arefully examining an inmate by\n27\ninspecting his clothing, and feeling the contours of his clothed body.  The inamte’s shoes and\n28 socks may be removed during this process.  An inmate’s ears, nose, hair and throat may be\nvisually checked during this search” (Doc. # 39 at 5; Doc. # 40, Ex. F).  \n- 6 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 7 of 9\n1 Even if the subject search was a “frisk search,” that does not,  ipso facto, render it\n2 constitutional.2  Searches “must be otherwise justified by security needs.”  Grummett, 779\n3 F.2d at 495.  While searches are obviously necessary to secure the safety of a jail, there is no\n4 evidence that the search of Plaintiff was necessary to security.  Defendants merely state the\n5 search was “appropriate to maintain a secure correctional facility” (Doc. # 40 at ¶ 6).  But\n6 the record is wholly devoid of evidence or eevn discussion, to support the contention that this\n7 search was necessary to security or that it furthered a legitimate penological interest.  While\n8 it is undisputed that the search was conducted during a training exercise for Academ y\n9 detention officers,3 Defendants make absolutely no effort to show that the search, conducted\n10 as a training exercise, was “justified by security needs.”  Moreover, there is no evidence to\n11 show that Plaintiff was a security risk and th at he was singled out as the subject of this\n12 search. \n13 Defendants have not proffered any evidence or argument to support the conclusion\n14 that the search was reasonable.  Consequently, sum mary judgment on that basis will be\n15 denied. \n16 D.  Eighth Amendment Claim\n17 Plaintiff claims that O’Connell caused him “wanton and unnecessary” pain when she\n18 frisked him, grabbed his genitals twice, and “ramed [sic] her index finger through the crack\n19 of his buttocks” (Doc. # 13 at 4) in front of more than ten other detention officers and eighty\n20 inmates, in violation of his Eighth Am endment rights.  “‘After incarceration, only the\n21 “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain” . . . constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\n22\n23 2 Plaintiff characterizes the search as a body cavity search (Doc. # 13 a t 4-6).\nDefendants have proffered evidence that thisw  as not a body cavity search, but a frisk search\n24\nover Plaintiff’s boxer shorts.  But even if Plaintiff m ischaracterized the type of search to\n25 which he was subjected, it doe s not alter the conclusion that any search is subject to\nconstitutional scrutiny. \n26\n3  Defendants presented evidence to demonstrate that Academy detention officers were\n27\nat the Durango Jail on the day in question to observe “cell searches.”  But Defendants also\n28 make no effort to explain how a training exercise on cell searches equates to a frisk search\non Plaintiff.  \n- 7 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 8 of 9\n1 forbidden by the Eighth Am endment.’” Whitley v. Albers , 475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986).\n2 Plaintiff claims that as a result of the search he suffered public humiliation, mental anguish,\n3 psychological trauma, and emotional distress.  Defendants have presented no evidence, or\n4 discussion, regarding Plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claim.  \n5 Plaintiff alleged that he suffered “public humiliation” and “psychological trauma” as\n6 a result of the search in his verified First Amended Complaint.4   Further, in his Response to\n7 Defendants’ Motion, Plaintiff cites Jordan v. Gardner , 986 F.2d 1521, 1524-25 (9th Cir.\n8 1993) (en banc), which recognized that cross-gender clothed body searches can constitute\n9 cruel and unusual punishment (Doc. # 45 at 2).  While Jordan dealt with female inmates who\n10 were searched by male detention officers, the Ninth Circuit based its ruling primarily on the\n11 evidence of great emotional pain and suffering the searches caused the fem ale inmates.\n12 Similarly here, Plaintiff has alleged significant emotional distress as a result of the “frisk\n13 search,” which Plaintiff contends included grabbing his genitals twice and forcibly inserting\n14 her finger into the cleft of Plaintiff’s buttocks.  Defendants fail to address Plaintiff’s Eighth\n15 Amendment argument.  Consequently, summary judgment on that claim will be denied. \n16 IV. Conclusion\n17 Plaintiff has failed to state a claim in Count II of his First Amended Complaint.  As\n18 a result, that claim will be dismissed.  Defendants have, however, demonstrated that Plaintiff\n19 is not entitled to dam ages under 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) for m ental or emotional injury.\n20 Defendants have failed to present evidence to warrant summary judgment as to Counts I and\n21 III of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.  As a result, Defendants’ motion will be granted\n22 in part and denied in part.\n23 IT IS ORDERED:\n24 (1) Count II of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint is dismissed for failure to state\n25 a claim.\n26\n27\n4A verified complaint may be used as an affidavit opposing summary judgment if it\n28 is based on pe rsonal knowledge and sets forth specific facts adm issible in evidence.\nSchroeder v. McDonald, 55 F.3d 454, 460 (9th Cir. 1995).\n- 8 -\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 52    Filed 05/30/07   Page 9 of 9\n1 (2)  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. # 39) is granted in part and\n2 denied in part.  \n3 (3)   The motion is granted to the extent that Plaintiff is not entitled to damages under\n4 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) for mental or emotional injury.  \n5 (4)  The motion is otherwise denied.  Plaintiff may proceed as to his claim s for\n6 compensatory, nominal, and punitive damages based on violations of his Fourth and Eighth\n7 Amendment rights.  \n8 (5) Plaintiff’s Motion for Pre-Trial Order (Doc. # 49) is denied.\n9 (6) Plaintiff’s Motion to Allow U.S. District Judge to Rule on this Case and Not a\n10 Jury Trial (Doc. # 50) is denied.\n11 DATED this 29th day of May 2007.\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 9 -",

This Court has ap-\npellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Mr. Byrd is appealing from the final judgment of the District Court, \nwhich disposed of all of Mr. Byrd's claims and which was entered August 17, 2007. Mr. Byrd filed a timely Notice of \nAppeal on September 6, 2007. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \n \nThe primary issues presented by this appeal are: \n \n(1) Whether the search of Charles E. Byrd, a pretrial detainee, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment where \nhe was stripped down to his pink underwear and then subjected to a search by a female in civilian clothing (wearing \nblue jeans, a white t-shirt and no name badge or any other items indicating that she was not an average civilian) who \nwas a cadet in training to become a prison officer, in which she made intimate contact, through Mr. Byrd's underwear, \nwith Mr. Byrd's testicles, perineum and inner crack of his buttocks, notwithstanding that numerous male officers were \nstanding 10 feet away and perfectly available to conduct the search. \n \n(2) Whether the partial strip search violated Mr. Byrd's substantive due process rights as a pretrial detainee. \n \n(3) Whether the facially discriminatory search policy and resulting search of Mr. Byrd violated Mr. Byrd's right to \nequal protection. \n \n(4) Whether the jury verdict must be vacated and a new trial granted based on the Appellees' destruction of critical \nevidence, and the District Court's failure to correct the prejudice to Mr. Byrd. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nCharles E. Byrd (“Mr. Byrd”), a then-detainee at Durango Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona, originally filed this \nlawsuit pro se on November 26, 2004, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. Mr. Byrd's \nlawsuit challenged the legality of a search he was subjected to at Durango Jail on October 28, 2004, and asserted a \nclaim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 based on alleged violations of his constitutional rights (i) to be free from unrea-\nsonable searches, (ii) to be free from cruel and unusual punishment (or to be accorded due process of law as a pretrial \ndetainee) and (iii) to be accorded equal protection under the law. Mr. Byrd's lawsuit named Sheriff Joseph Arpaio \n(“Sheriff Arpaio”), Captain Austin Peterson (“Captain Peterson”) and Cadet Kathleen O'Connell (“Cadet O'Connell”) \nas defendants. Mr. Byrd sought compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged violations of his rights. \n \nThe case proceeded before District Court Judge Neil V. Wake (the “District Court”). On June 14, 2005, Mr. Byrd filed \na First Amended Complaint, which remained the operative complaint throughout the proceedings. (EOR, Tab 28.) The \nCounty filed a motion for summary judgment on January 18, 2007.[FN1] (EOR, Tab 25.) On May 30, 2007, the District \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 5 \nCourt granted, in part, and denied, in part, the County's motion for summary judgment. (EOR, Tab 6.) The District \nCourt granted the motion with respect to Mr. Byrd's prayer for emotional damages, but denied the motion with respect \nto the viability of Mr. Byrd's underlying claims for the allegedly unreasonable search and the allegedly cruel and \nunusual punishment he endured. (Id.) In its Order on summary judgment, the District Court sua sponte dismissed Mr. \nByrd's equal protection claim. (Id.) On June 13, 2007, in anticipation of trial, the District Court appointed Louis Daniel \nLopez, Jr., and Stephen P. Brower of Fennemore Craig PC as pro bono counsel. (EOR, Tab 22.) \n \nFN1. It is worth noting that qualified immunity is not at issue in this case, since the County waived that de-\nfense below. (Transcript, EOR 106.) Thus, this Court need only determine whether Mr. Byrd's constitutional \nrights were violated, not whether those rights were “clearly established” at the time of the violation. \n \nThe case proceeded to trial. Four witnesses testified during the trial: Mr. Byrd, Cadet O'Connell, Captain Peterson and \nSheriff Arpaio.[FN2] At the close of all evidence, both parties verbally moved for a directed verdict regarding the \nconstitutionality of the search. (Transcript, EOR 355:21-406:13.) The District Court ruled that the search at issue was \nconstitutional, as a matter of law, and accordingly granted the County's motion for a directed verdict and denied that of \nMr. Byrd. (Transcript, EOR 391:11-406:13.) Three limited questions were presented to the jury, and the jury found \nagainst Mr. Byrd on the three issues. (Jury instructions, EOR 80:11-81:4; Jury verdict, EOR 77-78.)[FN3] \n \nFN2. The District Court denied the County's last-minute attempt to add witnesses that were not disclosed to \nMr. Byrd on or before the Magistrate Judge's mandatory deadline for disclosing such witnesses. (See Tran-\nscript, EOR 731:14-22; 735:9-17.) \n \nFN3. The manner in which the constitutional questions were resolved below was procedurally unorthodox, \nbut what follows is Mr. Byrd's most succinct summary. The District Court's constitutional holding on the \ncross-motions for directed verdict basically constituted its ruling on the legality of the search assuming the \njury would find against Mr. Byrd on the three limited issues presented to it. Moreover, the District Court \nbelieved that if the jury found in favor of Mr. Byrd on any of the three issues, the search would violate Mr. \nByrd's constitutional rights (which Mr. Byrd and the County agreed with). However, Mr. Byrd's position \nbelow (which did not prevail) and on appeal is that even assuming the facts as resolved by the jury, the search \nwas nonetheless unconstitutional. This is one of the primary issues on appeal. \n \nJudgment was entered against Mr. Byrd on August 17, 2007. (EOR, Tab 8.) Mr. Byrd's pro bono counsel withdrew as \ncounsel-of-record on August 27, 2007. On September 6, 2007, Mr. Byrd filed pro se a Notice of Appeal and an in-\nformal opening brief. (EOR, Tab 7.) On October 3, 2007, Jarrett A. Green took on Mr. Byrd's appeal pro bono, and \nfiled a motion to, among other things, have the case placed in the Ninth Circuit Pro Bono Program, which this Court \ngranted on November 16, 2007.[FN4] \n \nFN4. Because the issues on appeal turn on the specific facts and circumstances developed during trial, as well \nas on the many oral rulings the District Court issued along the way, Mr. Byrd believed it was necessary to \ninclude all four days of transcripts in the Excerpts of Record. Consequently, the Excerpts of Record are rather \nlengthy. \n \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nAppellant Charles E. Byrd \n \nAt the time of the search at issue, Charles E. Byrd (“Mr. Byrd”) was a pretrial detainee being temporarily held in \nDurango Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. Durango Jail is a minimum security jail (not prison) which houses mostly pretrial \ndetainees. (O'Connell, EOR 650:6-8; Byrd, EOR 599:9-15.) Mr. Byrd was being held in Durango Jail for illegally \npresenting his brother's license, rather than his own, to a police officer when he was pulled over for speeding. (Byrd, \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 6 \nEOR 575:14-576:13.) At the time he was pulled over, Mr. Byrd's license was suspended and, in an attempt to avoid a \ncitation for driving with a suspended license, Mr. Byrd presented his brother's license as his own to the officer. (Id.) Mr. \nByrd ultimately was charged with and pled guilty to identity theft for this act. (Id. After pleading guilty, Mr. Byrd was \ntransferred from Durango Jail to the Arizona State Prison Complex, Alhambra Complex Baker Unit. Mr. Byrd con-\ntinues to serve time in that prison, and is scheduled to be released in approximately 2010.[FN5] \n \nFN5. Mr. Byrd has no history of violence and has had no disciplinary problems or “write-ups” of any kind \nwhile in jail or prison. (Byrd, EOR 598:18-599:8.) \n \nAppellees O'Connell. Peterson and Arpaio \n \nMr. Byrd filed suit against Cadet O'Connell - the cadet who performed the search on him; Captain Peterson - the \nCommander of the Durango Jail following the search at issue; and Sheriff Arpaio - the Sheriff of Maricopa County and, \nby law, the elected official responsible for overseeing the Maricopa County jail and prison system.[FN6] (Arpaio, EOR \n206:11-16.) Sheriff Arpaio is the self-proclaimed “toughest sheriff in America” and the infamous author of many of \nthe most controversial jail and prison policies in America.[FN7] The Apellees are collectively referred to as the \n“County” throughout this brief. \n \nFN6. Although Cadet O'Connell is now an officer, she was a cadet at the time of the search at issue in this \nlawsuit. Accordingly, she is referred to hereinafter as “Cadet O'Connell.” \n \nFN7. For example, Sheriff Arpaio has drawn a great deal of national attention for reinstituting chain gangs, \ncreating the first ever female and juvenile chain gangs, requiring all male detainees and inmates in his jails \nand prisons to wear pink underwear, banning salt and pepper from his jails and prisons, and reducing the \nnumber of meals prisoners receive from three to two per day. \n \nThe Search At Issue \n \nThe search at issue occurred in Durango Jail on October 28, 2004, when Mr. Byrd was a pretrial detainee.[FN8] On that \nday, Mr. Byrd was laying on his bed reading a book when numerous Special Response Team (“SRT”) officers burst \ninto Mr. Byrd's cell with their laser-directed taser and pepper guns drawn, and demanded that he and the other de-\ntainees in his pod strip down to their underwear.[FN9] (Byrd, EOR 580:4-583:14.) The officers' demands that Mr. Byrd \nremove his clothes were accompanied by continual orders to “shut the fuck up.” (Id.) Doing as he was told, Mr. Byrd \nstripped down to his pink underwear (which Defendant Arpairo requires all male detainees and inmates in Maricopa \nCounty jails and prisons to wear), and then was ordered to leave his pod and walk into the multipurpose room (aka, the \n“day room”) - a large open common area in the Durango Jail. (Id.) Mr. Byrd followed the orders and entered the \nmultipurpose room wearing nothing except his pink underwear. (Id.) The underwear he and the other detainees were \nwearing had an open slit in the front and no buttons. (Byrd, EOR 581:8-11; O'Connell, EOR 657:7-658:2.) \n \nFN8. As explained above, Mr. Byrd's recanting of the facts (and his corresponding legal arguments) assume \nthe accuracy of the jury's findings on the three issues presented to it. \n \nFN9. A “pod” is a collection of small jail cells in a discrete area. The main jail areas included Mr. Byrd's \ntwo-man cell, his pod (which included numerous other two-man cells) and the multipurpose room. (Byrd, \nEOR 576:21-577:8.) \n \nThe multipurpose room was populated with approximately 25-35 uniformed prison officers and people in civilian \nclothing, wearing blue jeans and white t-shirts. (O'Connell, EOR 650:13-651:2; O'Connell, EOR 277:12-16; Byrd, \nEOR 581:16- 582:15.) None of these civilian-clad individuals wore name badges or any other items indicating they \nwere affiliated with the prison system. (O'Connell, EOR 651:23-652:9.) Mr. Byrd would later find out (after con-\n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 7 \nducting his own inquiry) that the civilian-clad individuals were cadets in training to become prison officers. (Byrd, \nEOR 597:9-16.) None of these civilian-clad individuals were actual prison officers. (Id.) At no time prior to or during \nthe search did anyone explain to Mr. Byrd or to the other detainees who these civilian-clad individuals were, what they \nwere doing there, or that they were in any way affiliated with the Maricopa County prison system. (Id 582:11-15; \n583:3-584:1.) \n \nAt that time, the cadets were at the final stage of their training Academy to become officers. That day the cadets were \nbrought over from their off-site training facility for purposes of conducting these searches. (O'Connell, EOR \n639:18-640:3.) As Captain Peterson explained, it is standard practice for a class of cadets to be taken to Durango Jail \nand given an opportunity to practice this sort of search as a final component of their training at the cadet Academy. \n(Peterson, EOR 349:15- 20.)[FN10] \n \nFN10. Far from the an isolated incident, the manner in which Mr. Byrd was searched was consistent with the \nCounty's well-established policy and practice of en masse partial strip searches conducted by cadets at the \nDurango Jail. (Peterson, EOR 344:4-7; 349:15-20; Frye Affidavit, EOR 793-94.) \n \nAfter entering the multipurpose room, Mr. Byrd lined up as ordered. The taser and pepper guns remained pointed at \nMr. Byrd from a very close distance, and the officers controlling these guns repeatedly yelled that he (and the other \ndetainees) better “shut the fuck up” and not move or speak. (Byrd, EOR 580:6-583:14; 585:23-25.) Although ada-\nmantly wanting to know what “civilians” were doing there (id 581:16-583:14; 608:10-609:1), Mr. Byrd knew that if he \nasked a question or said a word, he would be shot with a taser gun or pepper spray (as he had seen the officers do in the \npast to detainees who did not follow similar orders). (id 581:3-7.) Fearful of a physical retaliation by the officers, Mr. \nByrd remained silent. (Id.) \n \nThe SRT officers then yelled that he raise his arms above his head and spread his legs. (Id. 583:8-14.) Then one of the \nfemales in civilian clothing, Cadet O'Connel, approached Mr. Byrd and began searching him - again without identi-\nfying herself as a cadet or as someone affiliated with the correctional system. (Id. 583:3-585:25.) Cadet O'Connell's \nsearch was highly invasive. She positioned herself behind Mr. Byrd and ran her hands up his inner thigh (on top of his \nunderwear, rather than underneath it), until she made contact with the point where Mr. Byrd's thigh met his groin \narea.[FN11] (O'Connell, EOR 636:20-637:23; 638:20- 639:13; 678:19-682:10; 683:7-684:5; 687:19-688:19.) She then \nused her hand to lift Mr. Byrd's testicles and move them to the side, at which point she felt the skin underneath the \ntesticles and ran her hand along Mr. Byrd's perineum (i.e., the patch of skin connecting the scrotum and anus) (Id.) She \nnext inserted her hand in between Mr. Byrd's buttocks cheeks, and ran her hand upward along the crack. (Id.) Upon \nreaching the top of Mr. Byrd's buttocks, Cadet O'Connell pulled the waistband of Mr. Byrd's underwear out 3-4 inches \nfrom Mr. Byrd's waist, to ensure no contraband was located in that area. (Id; Byrd, EOR 585:10-18.) During the search, \nCadet O'Connell (and the other cadets) wore white latex gloves (Byrd, EOR 583:12-14; 584:6-11; O'Connell, EOR \n698:2-10), a prudent decision considering the intimate contact with Mr. Byrd's (and the other detainees') testicles, \nperineum and inner buttocks. \n \nFN11. All of the contact Cadet O'Connell made with Mr. Byrd's genital region was through his underwear, \nrather than underneath it. As Cadet O'Connell made clear at trial, the underwear fabric was a “very thin \nmaterial” and, hence, very easy to feel through. (Id., 684:20-23.) \n \nVarious other factors further exacerbated the humiliation, anxiety and discomfort Mr. Byrd experienced during this \ninvasive search. The search was performed without any regard for Mr. Byrd's privacy, as the search was conducted in \na large open room in view of over 100 people (numerous of whom were women). (Byrd, EOR 596:11-15.) Further, \nOfficer O'Connell - a female and non-officer was selected to perform the search, notwithstanding that numerous male \nofficers were in the room witnessing the search and perfectly available to conduct the search. (O'Connell, EOR \n277:12-16.) Further still, the search of Mr. Byrd and the other detainees was videotaped and an excerpt of the footage \nfrom that day (not including Mr. Byrd) was edited into the “Video Yearbook” distributed to the cadets upon comple-\ntion of the Academy, which served as a memento of their various experiences over the course of the Academy.[FN12] \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \n(Byrd, EOR 602:15-603:4; 605:5- 21.) As will be discussed more thoroughly below, the County failed to produce the \nunedited footage of the video recordings from that day, claiming that it must have been destroyed pursuant to the \nCounty's document “retention” policy. \n \nFN12. Mr. Byrd testified that the search by Cadet O'Connell was additionally humiliating and offensive \nbecause Mr. Byrd was sexually assaulted by women when he was a boy. (Id., EOR 600:9-602:2.) \n \nUltimately, the search of Mr. Byrd yielded no contraband. (Byrd, EOR 598:18-599:8.) Furthermore, there is no evi-\ndence in the record that any contraband was uncovered by any of the searches that day. Nonetheless, Mr. Byrd felt \nterribly humiliated, degraded and violated by the search and, unfortunately, he continues to struggle with those feel-\nings. (Id, EOR 598:7-17; 602:3-10.) Mr. Byrd filed an “Inmate Grievance Form” immediately that very day. (Byrd, \nEOR 597:14-16.) He then filed additional “Inmate Grievance Forms” in subsequent weeks. (Documents attached to \nPlaintiffs opposition to motion for summary judgment, EOR 810-818 (copies of all four grievances).) Ultimately, Mr. \nByrd filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. \n \nThe County's Invocation Of The General “Security” Justification \n \nConsidering that all 90 detainees were searched by cadets who were going through training to become officers (O'-\nConnell, EOR 696:23-697:2), one might have assumed that the justification for the October 28, 2004 searches was to \ntrain the cadets. Indeed, in its motion for summary judgment, the County explained, “[Cadet] O'Connell conducted the \nfrisk (body) search of Plaintiff in accordance with MCSO policy DH-3; in the presence of her supervisor, Captain \nPeterson; and in the process demonstrated and instructed detention officers in the proper manner in which to conduct \nsuch a search for contraband.” (Id., EOR 833-34.) However, in denying the County's motion for summary judgment on \nMr. Byrd's claim under the Fourth Amendment, the District Court held that “[s]earches must be otherwise justified by \nsecurity needs” (citing Ninth Circuit precedent), and concluded that the County failed to provide evidence that the \nOctober 28, 2004 search was justified by security needs, rather than training needs. (Order, EOR 64.)[FN13] \n \nFN13. Indeed, the notion that an invasive and humiliating search, such as the one endured by Mr. Byrd on \nOctober 28, 2004, could have been conducted for purposes of training the cadets would be deeply trouble-\nsome. Using a jailed or imprisoned person as the object of an educational exercise reeks of exploitation and \ndegradation. It should be self-evident to all correctional authorities that pretrial detainees and convicted \ninmates are not guinea pigs to be used for educational exercises. See Demerv v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1032 \n(9th Cir. 2004) (“[I]nmates are not like animals in a zoo to be filmed and photographed at will by the public or \nby media reporters, however ‘educational’ the process may be for others.”) (quoting Houchins v. KQED, Inc. \n438 U.S. 1, 5 n.2 (1978)). \n \nInterestingly, after the District Court issued its Order stating that searches must be conducted for security purposes, the \nCounty quickly changed its tune and for the remainder of the litigation, adamantly asserted that its only justification \nfor the October 28, 2004 search - like every such performed by the County - was to maintain institutional security \nwithin the Durango Jail. For example, the County filed a motion for reconsideration of the Order on summary judg-\nment, in which the County attempted to prove to the Court that the search was done for security, rather than training, \npurposes. (Id. EOR, Tab 21.) In its motion for reconsideration, the County bluntly stated: “Lt. Frye established that if \nthis [the type of search conducted on October 28, 2004] is done, it is done for security purposes.” (Id. EOR 800.) In its \nAddendum to the statement of facts in support of its motion for reconsideration, the County summarized the new \naffidavits it submitted as establishing that: “The pat search of Mr. Byrd and the cell search performed on October 28, \n2004 in Durango Jail was performed for security purposes to search for contraband and/or weapons, as part of the \nregular pat searches and cell searches for contraband and/or weapons that are performed in the facility when staffing \npermit it to be done and security interests require it be done.” (Id, EOR 786.)[FN14] Throughout the remainder of the \nproceedings before the District Court, including throughout the trial, the County repeatedly and consistently asserted \nthat the sole purpose of the challenged search was to maintain security at Durango Jail. (See,e.g., Final pretrial order, \nEOR 44:16-26 (County asserts that the search was conducted for purposes of security); Arpaio, EOR 259:17-21; \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 9 \n213:18-22.) \n \nFN14. Incidentally, the County's motion for reconsideration was denied. (Order, EOR, Tab 19.) \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nThe October 28, 2004 search violated Mr. Byrd's right to be free of unreasonable searches and his right to due process \nof law. Balancing the scope, manner, location and justification of search distinctly illustrates the unreasonableness of \nthe search. Moreover, the unreasonableness of the search is illuminated by the inescapable conclusion that the manner \nin which it was performed was wholly unrelated to the asserted governmental interest underlying the search. Fur-\nthermore, by acting with deliberate indifference to Mr. Byrd's severe pain and suffering, the County violated Mr. \nByrd's right to due process. The District Court's rulings to the contrary must be reversed. \n \nIn addition, Mr. Byrd's equal protection rights were violated by the County's search policy, which facially discrimi-\nnates on the basis of gender. In sua sponte dismissing Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim, the District Court erroneously \nfailed to construe Mr. Byrd's pro se complaint liberally and inexcusably ignored the facially discriminatory policy that \nwas in the record. The District Court's dismissal of that claim must be reversed. \n \nLastly, this Court should vacate the jury verdict and order a new trial. The County's patently illegal document “re-\ntention” policy caused the destruction of the most critical piece of evidence in this case - i.e the unedited video footage \nof the cadets' October 28, 2004 visit to Durango Jail. The District Court compounded the prejudice to Mr. Byrd by \nfailing to take corrective action and then by permitting the County to introduce the highly prejudicial and misleading \n“Video Yearbook” into evidence. This District Court's abuse of discretion warrants a new trial. \n \n16ARGUMENT \n \nI. THE SEARCH OF MR. BYRD WAS UNREASONABLE UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT[FN15] \n \nFN15. This Court reviews findings of fact for clear error, but reviews the resolution of constitutional issues \nde novo. See Valley Bank of Nev. V. Plus Sys. Inc., 914 F.2d 1186, 1189 (9th Cir. 1990); Michenfelder v. \nSumner, 860 F.2d 328, 331 (9th Cir. 1988). \n \nIn Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), the United States Supreme Court held that “when a prison regulation impinges \non inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” \nId., 482 U.S. at 89. In an earlier case, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), which was cited with approval by Turner, \nthe Supreme Court established the test for assessing the reasonableness of a search under the Fourth Amendment in the \njail and prison context. In Bell, the Court explained: \nThe test for reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical applica-\ntion. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that \nthe search entails. Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the \njustification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \n \nId., 441 U.S. at 559. Bell's four-factor test is regularly applied in assessing the reasonableness of searches of pretrial \ndetainees in the jail context and of convicted inmates in the prison context. See, e.g.,*17Way v. County of Ventura, 445 \nF.3d 1157, 1160-62 (9th Cir. 2006) (applying Bell in the jail context); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332-33 \n(9th Cir. 1988) (applying Bell in prison context). \n \nApplying Bell's four-factor test to the search of Mr. Byrd establishes its unreasonableness. \n \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 10 \nManner \n \nThe manner in which the search was performed on Mr. Byrd clearly favors a holding of unreasonableness. Notwith-\nstanding that numerous male officers were standing 10 feet away during the search of Mr. Byrd (and during the search \nof the other 90 detainees), the County instead decided to have a female non-officer dressed in blue jeans and a white \nt-shirt (and no identification whatsoever) approach Mr. Byrd and very intimately search his genitalia. Nobody pro-\nvided Mr. Byrd (or any other detainee) an explanation of who Cadet O'Connell and the other civilian-clad individuals \nwere, what they were doing there, or that they were in any way affiliated with the Maricopa County prison system. \nInstead, the SRT officers continually yelled at the detainees to “shut the fuck up” and not ask any questions, while \npointing laser-directed taser and pepper spray guns at their bodies. \n \nAs Cadet O'Connell openly testified, there were numerous uniformed SRT officers, uniformed academy training \nofficers and other uniformed officers lined up on the wall just 10 feet away, observing the search. The vast majority of \nthese officers were male. Although these male officers were present and perfectly *18 available to conduct the \nsearches, Cadet O'Connell was selected to conduct the search of Mr. Byrd. In fact, all 90 detainees were searched by \ncivilian-clad cadets. The uniformed officers did nothing except watch the search from the wall.[FN16] Subjecting Mr. \nByrd to a search by a female non-officer in civilian clothing, while simultaneously depriving him of an explanation of \nwhat was occurring, demanding that he shut up and not ask any questions, and threatening him with taser and pepper \nguns if he asked any questions, was patently unreasonable. To make matters worse, Mr. Byrd was videotaped during \nthe process, by an individual who videotaped many of the cadet's training experiences for purposes of creating a \n“Video Yearbook” that was distributed to the cadets upon graduating from the Academy. Being videotaped in one's \nunderwear (for purposes entirely unrelated to security) while a stranger in civilian clothing is intimately touching one's \ntesticles and other private parts is quintessentially offensive and unreasonable. Accordingly, the “manner” factor \nclearly favors a finding of unreasonableness. \n \nFN16. The fact that numerous male officers were present and available to conduct the search strongly sup-\nports the unreasonableness of the search. See Moore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 237(5th Cir. 1999) (denying \nmotion to dismiss Fourth Amendment claim based on strip search conducted by female officer where inmate \nalleged “male officers were available to conduct the searches”). \n \nScope \n \nThe scope of the search was highly invasive. First of all, Mr. Byrd was forced to strip down to his pink underwear. The \nfact that Sherriff Arpaio requires *19 all men in the Maricopa County jail and prison system to wear pink underwear is \nobviously intended to emasculate and humiliate them, and is directly relevant to the constitutionality of the search of \nMr. Byrd. Forcing grown men to wear pink underwear, and then forcing them to strip down to that underwear in order \nto be viewed and intimately searched by women (especially women who appear to be civilians) is simply offensive \nand unreasonable. Further, the pink underwear worn by the detainees has an opening in the front but no buttons to \nprevent the risk of exposing their genitalia. \n \nAs Cadet O'Connell repeatedly testified, the fabric of the underwear was extremely thin, which allowed her to feel \nthrough it with great ease. Through this extremely thin fabric, Cadet O'Connell made intimate contact with Mr. Byrd's \ngenitalia and private parts. She ran her hand up the inside of Mr. Byrd's thighs until she touched the point where his \ninner thighs met his groin. Next she used her hand to lif Mr. Byrd's testicles and move them to the side, before using \nher other hand to touch the skin underneath Mr. Byrd's testicles. She then moved her hand along Mr. Byrd's perineum \n(the patch of skin connecting the scrotum and anus). Then she ran her hand up the inside of his buttocks cheeks, feeling \nfor any possible contraband. Upon reaching the top of his buttocks, Cadet O'Connell pulled the waistband of Mr. \nByrd's underwear about three to four inches from his skin, to ensure that no contraband was located in that area. Cadet \nO'Connell wore white *20 latex gloves during the search, further evidencing the deeply intimate contact she made \nwith Mr. Byrd's genitalia and private parts. \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 11 \n \nSimply put, the scope of the search was highly invasive. The invasiveness of this search is not easily distinguishable \nfrom a more traditional strip search (where the detainee is fully stripped but never touched). Indeed, there does not \nappear to be an obvious difference in invasiveness between a search where the detainee is full stripped but not phys-\nically touched, and a search in which the detainee is stripped down to his thin underwear and then slowly and me-\nthodically touched in his most intimate parts. See Sterling v. Cupp. 607 P.2d 206, 208 (Or. App. 1980) (describing a \ntraditional strip search and subsequently explaining that a “prisoner is equally entitled to be free from the tactile \nequivalent of the nude inspection, viz., manual examination of the anal-genital area through clothing”); Justice v. City \nof Peachtree, 961 F.2d 188, 191 (11th Cir. 1992) (“We accept as axiomatic the principle that people harbor a rea-\nsonable expectation of privacy in their ‘private parts.... [D]eeply imbedded in our culture is the belief that people have \na reasonable expectation not to.have their ‘private’ parts observed or touched by others.”) (emphasis added) (citations \nomitted). An invasion occurs where a detainee is fully stripped and his genitalia is visually inspected, and also *21 \nwhere he is stripped to his underwear and his genitalia is manually inspected. As the expression goes, “there's more \nthan one way to peal an orange.”[FN17] \n \nFN17. This Court has consistently recognized that strip searches devoid of physical contact are deeply in-\ntrusive and humiliating - particularly where they are conducted by persons of the opposite sex. See, e.g., Way \nv. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1160 (9th Cir. 2006) (“The scope of the intrusion [with a strip search] is \nindisputably a frightening and humiliating invasion, even when conducted with all due courtesy. Its intru-\nsiveness cannot be overstated.”) (citation omitted); York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963) (“The \ndesire to shield one's unclothed figure from view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, \nis impelled by elementary self-respect and personal dignity.”). That recognition should apply with equal \nforce to the search of Mr. Byrd. \n \nIn a transparent resort to euphemism, the County - throughout the proceedings below - referred to the search of Mr. \nByrd as a “frisk” or “pat-down” search. (See, e.g., Defendants' Motion for summary judgment, EOR, Tab 25; Tran-\nscript, 96:19-23.) Of course, the County's false label cannot muddle the undisputed facts. Mr. Byrd was stripped down \nto his underwear, and his genitalia was slowly and methodically touched. It is not as if he were given a brief “swipe” or \n“brush” across his groin area while fully clothed.[FN18] The search of Mr. Byrd was fundamentally distinguishable from \na routine pat-down search that includes the groin region. See Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1533 (9th Cir. 1993) \n(Reinhardt, J., concurring) (rejecting prison's argument that the fully-clothed *22 searches were “pat searches,” since \nthe evidence “reveal [s] that the searches involve nothing so delicate or so tentative as ‘patting. Rather, the searches are \nintimate and deeply invasive.”); Compare with Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1985) (upholding \nroutine pat-down searches that fundamentally differ from the search of Mr. Byrd: “These searches are done briefly and \nwhile the inmates are fully clothed, and thus do not involve intimate contact with the inmates' bodies.”). As Cadet \nO'Connell acknowledged on the witness stand, “[w]hether you are prepared for it or not, to have somebody search near \nyour genitals is always going to be a shocking feeling.” (O'Connell, 634:8-10.) \n \nFN18. Anybody who has been subjected to a “pat-down” or “frisk” search (whether at the airport, entering a \nprison or elsewhere) knows that the search of Mr. Byrd was nothing of the sort. \n \nMoreover, this Court (and others) have recognized the invasiveness of searches in which individuals are forced to \nremove some - but not all - of their clothing, and have suggested that such searches amount to strip searches. See \nEdgerly v. San Francisco, 495 F.3d 645, 657 (9th Cir. 2007) (holding that if the detainee was in fact stripped down to \nhis undergarments but not physically touched, the visual inspection would qualify as a “strip search” for purposes of \ndetainee's § 1983 claim); Sepulveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1415-16 (9th Cir. 1992) (stating that officer's in-\nspection of parolee while she was “partially unclothed” on the toilet would clearly violate the California Department \nof Corrections' prohibition against cross-gender “unclothed” searches); see also Crowe v. County of San Diego, 359 F. \nSupp. 2d 994, 1021 (S.D. Cal. 2005) (where plaintiff was *23 asked to remove all of his clothes other than his un-\nderwear, court assumes, without analysis, that search was a “strip search” before analyzing issue of consent).[FN19] \n \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 12 \nFN19. In its motion for summary judgment, the County cited a Washington statute that defines a “strip \nsearch” as a search requiring the detainee to remove “some or all” of his clothing. (Id., EOR 835.) By de-\nfining “strip” search to include a search where the detainee removes “some” (but not all) of his clothing, the \nCounty's own authority undermines its argument that the search of Mr. Byrd was a “frisk” search, rather than \na “strip” search. Moreover, the search policy at issue in our case (Policy DH-3) is consistent with this defi-\nnition. Policy DH-3 requires that a “frisk” search be performed on the “clothed body” of the inmate, with the \ncaveat that “[t]he inmate's shoes and socks may be removed during the process.” (Id, EOR 855.) Thus, Policy \nDH-3 unambiguously states that if the inmate is required to remove more than just his shoes and socks, the \nsearch is not a “frisk” search. \n \nThe search endured by Mr. Byrd was invasive, regardless of the label ascribed to it. Officer Peterson put it well when \nasked if he ever walked around in public in just his underwear: “No. I would get arrested.” (Peterson, EOR \n341:4-6.)[FN20] Mr. Byrd was stripped down to his pink underwear and then intimately touched in his most private parts. \nThe invasive scope of the search weighs in favor of unreasonableness. \n \nFN20. Interestingly, the official policy at Durango Jail prohibits detainees from leaving their cells or entering \nthe common areas unless they are fully clothed. Walking around the common area wearing just their pink \nunderwear would be a clear violation of jail policy. (Byrd, EOR 599:16-25; O'Connell, EOR 656:18- 657:6.) \n \nPlace \n \nThis factor also favors unreasonableness, since the search of Mr. Byrd was conducted in the least private location \npossible: A large open area in the presence *24 of over 100 people - inmates, officers and cadets (numerous of whom \nwere women). See Polk v. Montgomery County, 782 F.2d 1196, 1201 (4th Cir. 1986) (“The strip search of Polk may \nnor may not have been conducted in private. This fact is especially relevant in determining whether a strip search is \nreasonable under the circumstances.”); Craft v. County of San Bernadino, 468 F. Supp. 2d 1172, 1176 (C.D. Cal. 2006) \n(granting detainee's motion for summary judgment on his Fourth Amendment claim and finding that the location of \nthe search favored unreasonableness: “[T]he evidence of record reveals that [the jail officials] have taken no steps to \nconduct the [strip] searches on an individual basis and have instead continued to conduct the searches en masse \nwithout any attempt to limit the humiliation occasioned by conducting the searches in full view of dozens of other \nindividuals.”); Bacon v. Kolender, No. 05-0310, 2007 WL 2669541, at *7 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 6, 2007) (holding that the \n“place” factor “supports the unreasonableness of the searches” in light of the uncontroverted evidence that the strip \nsearches were conducted “in the middle of the floor that was in the sight of female guards”).[FN21] \n \nFN21. See also Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding jail strip search \npolicy unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment but noting that the “place” factor favored reasonableness \nbecause “the search took place in a private room behind closed doors, with no one present but [the detainee] \nand [the officer]”); Roberts v. Rhode Island, 239 F.3d 107, 113 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding that the “place” factor \ncuts in favor of “reasonableness” because the challenged searches were “generally conducted in private”). \n \n*25 Justification \n \nEver since its motion for summary judgment was denied, the County has been steadfast in its position that the sole \njustification for Mr. Byrd's (and similar) searches is jail security. While the goal of maintaining security in the Du-\nrango Jail by eliminating the flow of contraband among the detainees is no doubt legitimate in principle, at no point \ndid the County support its general invocation of the “security” justification with specific evidence. For example, there \nis no evidence in the record indicating that there was a basis for believing that any of the detainees (much less Mr. \nByrd) possessed contraband on October 28, 2004. Instead, the County cast as wide a net as possible, asserting that the \nOctober 28, 2004 search “must have been” justified by an interest in security, since such searches - as a matter of \npolicy - are only conducted to enhance jail security. (Defendants' motion for reconsideration, EOR 800; Arpaio, EOR \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 13 \n259:17-21; Frye Affidavit, EOR 793- 74.) \n \nIt is also worth noting that the County's “security” concerns, although legitimate, are somewhat tempered here because: \n(1) Durango Jail is a minimum security jail - not prison - that primarily houses pretrial detainees; and (2) there is no \nevidence in the record indicating that this minimum security jail had any history *26 of security problems. Logically, \na government's invocation of the goal of maintaining “security” in a facility is more compelling where that particular \nfacility either is a maximum security prison or has a documented history of security problems. Indeed, in analyzing the \nprison's “security” justification for the strip search in Michenfelder, 860 F.2d 328, this Court recognized: \nThe fact that Unit 7 [the facility at issue] houses the state's most difficult prisoners gives rise to a legitimate go-\nvernmental security interest in procedures that might be unreasonable elsewhere. In addition, testimony and physical \nevidence before the district court substantiated several incidents in which contraband and homemade weapons were \nconfiscated from Unit Seven inmates. \n \nId., 860 F.2d at 333; see also Roberts, 239 F.3d at 112 & n.6 (“[A] policy of searching all inmates is more reasonable \nwhen the record indicates a lengthy history of contraband problems... The lack of specific instances where a body \ncavity search was necessary to discover contraband supports a finding that the policy of searching all inmates is an \nunreasonable one.”) (citations omitted). Thus, the “security” interest in this case is less compelling than in cases \ninvolving more threatening and dangerous facilities. \n \nImportantly, the County has provided no evidence that the cross-gender nature of Mr. Byrd's search was justified by \nthe government's interest in protecting the employment rights of its female officers (or cadets) or in avoiding admin-\nistrative obstacles (e.g., altering the schedules of its employees in order to prevent cross-gender searches by staffing \nmore males and less females when *27 searches are to occur). Conversely, all three of the County's witnesses testified \nthat they have never been involved in or even heard of an incident where a Maricopa County female officer's em-\nployment opportunities were hampered or restricted as a result of making accommodations to protect the privacy \ninterests of male detainees or inmates. (O'Connell, EOR 670:17-671:12; Arpaio, EOR 211:1-18; Peterson, EOR \n331:19-332:5.) Hence, accommodating Mr. Byrd (and the other detainees) by not subjecting them to cross-gender \nsearches would neither restrict the employment rights of the female jail employees nor create administrative problems \nat the jail. The justification for the search of Mr. Byrd (and for cross-gender search policy, in general) is plain and \nsimple: To maintain the institutional security of the Durango Jail. \n \nIn sum, Bell's four-factor test weighs decisively in favor of finding Mr. Byrd's search unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment. The scope, manner and place of the search all unquestionably favor unreasonableness. The final factor, \nthe general “security” justification for the search, is present in the context of every jail *28 and prison search, but often \nin a far more compelling way than it is here. On the balance, a finding of unreasonableness is clearly warranted.[FN22] \n \nFN22. While Mr. Byrd has framed the constitutional issue under the right to be free from unreasonable \nsearches pursuant the Fourth Amendment, it can also be framed under the right to privacy imbedded in the \nFourteenth Amendment. See, Grummett, 779 F.2d at 493-496; Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332-334. \n \nFurthermore, the constitutionality of the search of Mr. Byrd must be inspected through the lens of Turner v. Safely, \n482 U.S. 78 (1987), a case decided after Bell that conclusively articulated the test for determining the constitutionality \nof governmental conduct in the jail and prison context. Id; see also Michenfelder (applying Turner in analyzing the \nunreasonableness of a search in the prison context). In Turner the Court held that “when a prison regulation impinges \non inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” \nTurner, 482 U.S. at 89. In this way, the Supreme Court made clear that in assessing the constitutionality of govern-\nmental conduct in the prison context, courts cannot assess either the challenged conduct or the governmental interest \nin isolation instead, courts must analyze the relationship between these two components. Only where the two are \n“reasonably related” may the conduct be deemed constitutional. Where the challenged governmental conduct is not \n“reasonably related” to the asserted governmental interest, the challenged conduct is unconstitutional. \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 14 \n \n*29 Because the search of Mr. Byrd falls woefully short of being “reasonably related” to the asserted governmental \ninterest, the search must be deemed unconstitutional. The County's asserted interest in maintaining “security” in the \nDurango Jail, although legitimate, was not advanced by the manner in which the search was conducted. Simply put, \nthere was absolutely reason to have Mr. Byrd searched by a (i) female (ii) non-officer (iii) in civilian clothing. As the \nCounty has unambiguously stated, a plethora of (i) male (ii) officers (iii) in uniform were standing just 10 feet away \nand were perfectly available to conduct the search of Mr. Byrd (and the other detainees). Had the County elected to \nhave these male officers conduct the search, the County's asserted interest in maintaining “security” within the Du-\nrango Jail would have been equally advanced. In fact, that interest would almost certainly have been better advanced, \nsince actual officers would perform the searches with equal or better quality than would cadets. Moreover, had the \nmale uniformed officers conducted the search, Mr. Byrd would have been spared of the severe humiliation and anxiety \nhe endured as a result of being searched by Cadet O'Connell.[FN23] Therefore, by subjecting Mr. Byrd to a *30 search \nby a female, non-officer in civilian clothing, the County simultaneously (1) caused Mr. Byrd severe humiliation and \nanxiety that could have been instantly avoided without causing the County any additional hardship or burden; and (2) \nfailed to advance (and possibly hindered) its interest in maintaining security at Durango Jail. This is the epitome of \ngovernmental conduct that is not “reasonably related” to the asserted governmental interest. \n \nFN23. The County has also clarified that these en masse, cross-gender, underwear searches are only per-\nformed when there are a very large number of officers and cadets present in the jail. (Defendants motion for \nreconsideration, EOR 800; Frye Affidavit, EOR 793), and always with the cadets (not the officers) con-\nducting the searches on the partially stripped detainees. (Id Consistent with this practice, Cadet O'Connell \ntestified that all 90 detainees searched on October 28, 2004 were searched by the civilian-clad cadets, despite \nthe presence and availability of the numerous officers. \n \nJudge Reinhardt's concurrence in Jordan is instructive.[FN24] In applying Turner's “reasonable relation” test to the \ncross-gender search at issue, Judge Reinhardt explained that courts must consider: \n \nFN24. The majority held the cross-gender searches violated the Eighth Amendment and, hence, never ad-\ndressed whether the Fourth Amendment was violated. Judge Reinhardt, although agreeing that the searches \nviolated the Eighth Amendment, concluded that the searches were also violative of the Fourth Amendment. \nSee id., 986 F.2d at 1537. \n \n[W]hether the prison's actions are reasonably related to the interests it advances - to decide whether the connection \nbetween the policy and the prison's interests is reasonable or whether, in light of the effect of the policy upon the \nprisoners' constitutional rights, it reflects an overreaction....While legitimate concerns may justify a restriction, it is the \nparticular restriction that must be justified by the particular problem at hand. For example, in Turner, the Court found \nthat there were legitimate security concerns that justified placing reasonable restrictions upon the right to marry. \nHowever, it ultimately concluded that the particular regulation represented an exaggerated response to those security \nobjectives. Turner, 482 U.S. at 97-98, 107 S.Ct. at 2266. Here, there are legitimate concerns that justify suspicionless \nsearches; the question is whether the specific solution of having male guards perform the searches is reasonable... I \nconclude that the *31 cross-gender searches and the prison policy authorizing them are clearly ‘unreasonable.’ \n \nJordan, 986 F.2d at 1537 (Reinhardt, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). Similarly, in our case, there are legitimate \nsecurity concerns that justify searches of detainees at the Durango Jail; the question is whether the specific solution of \nhaving female non-officers in civilian clothing perform the searches is reasonable. Especially considering that nu-\nmerous male uniformed officers were 10 feet away and perfectly available to perform the search, it was undoubtedly \n“unreasonable” for the County to respond in this way.[FN25] \n \nFN25. The Turner Court provided four factors that are relevant for determining whether a “reasonable rela-\ntion” exists between the challenged governmental conduct and the asserted governmental interest: (1) \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 15 \nwhether there is a “valid, rational connection” or “logical connection” between the two; (2) whether there are \n“alternative means” for the inmate to exercise the right that is impinged by the governmental conduct; (3) \nwhether accommodating the asserted constitutional right will have an impact “on guards and other inmates, \nand on the allocation of prison resources generally”; and (4) whether “ready alternatives” to the challenged \ngovernmental conduct exist. Id., 482 U.S. at 89- 90. All four factors support the conclusion that no “rea-\nsonable relation” exists here: (1) No “logical connection” exists because the County's security interest would \nbe equally, if not better, advanced by a real officer, rather than a cadet, conducting the search; (2) No “al-\nternative means” were available because suspicionless searches “leave[] the inmates no means of protecting \ntheir bodies against unreasonable searches” - since an “inmate can do nothing to escape a search” (Jordan, \n986 F.2d at 1536 (Reinhardt, J., concurring)); (3) Accommodating Mr. Byrd's asserted right will have no \nimpact on the guards, other inmates or the allocation of prison resources - since accommodation would only \nrequire that the male officers already present conduct the search; and (4) There exists a “ready alternative” \nthat is both obvious and easy - i. allow one of the male officers standing 10 feet away to conduct the search. \n \n*32 Although the search of Mr. Byrd presents the novel scenario of a female non-officer in civilian clothing directly \nperforming an intimate search of a detainee's genitalia (despite the undisputed availability of male officers), a review \nof prior strip search cases magnifies the egregiousness and unconstitutionality of the search of Mr. Byrd. As further \nexplained below, in both cases in which this Court upheld searches or surveillance by female prison officers of male \ninmates (Grummett and Michenfelder), the searches or surveillance were far less intrusive than the search of Mr. Byrd \nand, more importantly, the aspect of the search being challenged (its cross-gender nature) was reasonably related to \nthe government's asserted interest. Indeed, in each of those cases, if the aspect of the strip search being challenged (its \ncross-gender nature) were eliminated, damage would be done to the prison's security, the prison's administrative \nstructure or the female guards' employment rights. \n \nFor example, in Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1985), this Court held that it was constitutional for female \nprison officers to (1) conduct routine pat-down searches of male inmates; and (2) provide general prison surveillance, \neven if that would entail occasional views of naked male inmates. Id. at 494-496. In finding the routine pat-down \nsearches constitutional, the Court reasoned that “[t]hese searches are done briefly and while the inmates are fully \nclothed, and thus do not involve intimate contact with the inmates' bodies.” Id. at *33 496 (emphasis added). The \nsearch of Mr. Byrd is, of course, fundamentally different, as Mr. Byrd was stripped down to his thin underwear and \nthen Cadet O'Connell intimately and methodically touched his testicles, perineum and inner buttocks. As discussed \nsupra, the search of Mr. Byrd was anything but a routine pat-down search and thus, Grummett is easily distinguishable. \n(Not to mention that the search in Grummett was performed by officers in uniform rather than non-officers in blue \njeans and white t-shirts.) \n \nWith respect to whether it was unconstitutional for female officers to be assigned to surveillance positions at the prison \nthat involved occasional views of naked male inmates, the Court held that it was not, and emphasized that the viewing \nof naked inmates by female guards was “obscured by the angle and distance of their locations”, “restricted by distance \nand [was] casual in nature” and “infrequent and irregular.” Grummett, 779 F.2d at 495. Unlike the distant, obscured \nand infrequent “views” of male inmates in Grummet, which were hardly invasive, the search of Mr. Byrd was up-close \nand personal, and involved intimate contact with Mr. Byrd's testicles, perineum and inner buttocks. Indeed, the \nGrummett Court questioned whether or not the female guards' conduct even qualified as a “search” under the Fourth \nAmendment, in light of their distanced and obscured views. See id. at 495. The same question does not even arise here, \nas Cadet O'Connell's intimate contact with Mr. Byrd's genitalia most certainly *34 amounted to a search and was \ninfinitely more intrusive than the “views” in Grummett. See generally Sepulveda v. Ramirez, 967 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th \nCir. 1992) (where female parolee was viewed by male officer while providing urine sample, finding conduct un-\nconstitutional because the officer's view “was neither obscured nor distant” and, hence, the “experience was far more \ndegrading to [the parolee] than the situation faced by the inmates in Grummett”). \n \nMoreover, the Grummett Court explained that if the government were to cease the challenged conduct - by removing \nfemale officers from every surveillance position that involves even occasional viewing of naked inmates - it “would \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 16 \nnecessitate a tremendous rearrangement of work schedules, and possibly produce a risk to both internal security and \nequal employment opportunities for female guards.” Id. at 496. As demonstrated by the unanimous testimony of Cadet \nO'Connell, Sheriff Arpaio and Captain Peterson (see supra at page 27), the same cannot be said here. Ceasing the \nchallenging conduct in this case would have been effortless (the County simply would have utilized one of the many \nmale officers standing 10 feet away to perform the search of Mr. Byrd), and making this accommodation would not \nnecessitate rearranging work schedules, would not threaten the equal employment opportunities of female guards and \nwould not threaten internal security. The absence of these factors here justifies a contrary *35 result to Grummett and \ndemonstrates the lack of a “reasonable relation” under Turner. \n \nSimilarly, Michenfelder upheld the constitutionality of assigning female officers to the “lock box” and “control bub-\nble” of the prison - areas which could possibly allow them to oversee strip searches of male inmates.[FN24] Id, 860 F.2d \n328. The Court applied Grummett and concluded that there was no evidence suggesting that the female officer's view \nof the strip search from the “lock box” was “anything but an isolated incident.” Id. at 334. The Court also held that the \nfemale officer's position in the “control bubble” was not inappropriate because it “would provide at most an indistinct, \nlimited view” of the strip search. Id The Court subsequently rejected the inmate's challenge to the occasional as-\nsignment of female officers to shower duty, explaining that the evidence “did not establish an inappropriate amount of \ncontact with disrobed prisoners.” Id While it is not clear from the Michenfelder opinion the exact distance or extent of \nthe female officers' views of the disrobed inmates during shower duty, the Court obviously concluded that the these \nviews were too infrequent or distanced under Grummett to be *36 “inappropriate.” Id [FN27] Again, the search of Mr. \nByrd by Cadet O'Connell was a far more intimate and direct invasion than the infrequent and distanced “views” at \nissue in Michenfelder. \n \nFN26. The “lock box” is a surveillance area in the administrative segregation unit that also includes a small \nwindow into the hallway where strip searches were conducted by male officers only. Id at 329. The “control \nbubble” is a surveillance room with video screens, which allow monitoring of the same hallways.Id \n \nFN27. It is clear from reading the case that the Court believed the possible views of disrobed inmates from \nthe “lock box” and “control bubble” were more invasive than the possible views from “shower duty.” Indeed, \nthe Court spent little time analyzing the inmate's “shower duty” challenge and appeared to conclude that its \ndecision on the “lock box” and “control bubble” challenge would ipso facto control the “shower duty” \nchallenge. \n \nBut more importantly, the assignment of female officers to the prison positions in Michenfelder was reasonably related \nto the prison's interests in both employment equality for women and security. As the Court explained, “[w]e recognize \nas legitimate both the interest in providing equal employment opportunities and the security interest in deploying \navailable staff effectively.” Id at 334. The Court ultimately concluded that these interests would be hampered if the \nchallenged conduct (i.e., assigning female officers to areas with possible views of disrobed inmates) were invalidated \nby the Court: “[p]rohibiting female employees from working in the control bubble or requiring them to be replaced by \nmales for the duration of strip searches, would displace officers throughout the prison.” Id at 334. To the contrary, \nMaricopa County officers would be displaced if the County ceased its practice of having searches performed by \nfemale non-officers in civilian clothing. All that would occur is that male uniformed *37 officers (who are always \npresent in these situations) would conduct the searches - rather than watch the searches from 10 feet away. The \nCounty's asserted interest in security would be equally advanced, whether or not the challenged search were prohi-\nbited.[FN28] \n \nFN28. To Mr. Byrd's knowledge, the only other Ninth Circuit case involving the constitutionality of searches \nor surveillance of male inmates by female officers is Sorners v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614 (9th Cir. 1997). But \nSomers merely analyzed whether a male inmate's alleged right to be free from a strip search by a female of-\nficer was “clearly established” for purposes of qualified immunity; it never resolved the underlying consti-\ntutionality of such searches. Id at 6116-622. \n \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 17 \nSimply put, the County's use of female non-officers in civilian clothing to conduct the partial strip searches of the male \ndetainees (when numerous male officers are readily available) does nothing to advance the County's interest in \nmaintaining security at Durango Jail. (Yet this practice causes substantial humiliation and degradation to the male \ndetainees.) Because the manner in which the County conducts these searches is not “reasonably related” to its asserted \nsecurity interest, this Court should find the searches unconstitutional. See generally Way v. County of Ventura, 445 \nF.3d 1157, 1161 (9th Cir. 2006) (stating that strip search policies are not “constitutionally acceptable simply by virtue \nof jail officials invocation of security concerns” and holding that the strip search policy at issue was unconstitutional \nbecause the jail officials “failed to show any link between their blanket strip search policy and legitimate security *38 \nconcerns”); Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020,1032 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that the Maricopa County Sheriffs De-\npartment webcam policy was not rationally related to the Departments asserted governmental interest: “The Sheriffs \npolicy is all the more troubling because displaying images of the County's pretrial detainees to internet users from \naround the world is not rationally connected to goals associated with educating the citizenry of Maricopa County.”); \nMoore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir. 1999) (denying the prison's motion to dismiss a challenge to \ncross-gender strip searches where a male inmate alleged “male officers were available to conduct the searches”). \n \nII THE SEARCH OF MR. BYRD VIOLATED HIS SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS \n \n“[U]nder the due process clause, a [pretrial] detainee may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accor-\ndance with due process of law.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 535; see also Demery v. Arpaio, 378 F.3d 1020, 1029 (9th Cir. \n2004).[FN29] For a particular jail action to constitute a violation of a detainee's due process rights, the action must inflict \npain or harm on the detainee, and the jail authorities *39 must act with “deliberate indifference” to the detainee's \nsuffering. See Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1525; Redman, 942 F.2d at 1441. \n \nFN29. Because a pretrial detainee's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment are comparable to a \nconvicted prisoner's rights under the Eighth Amendment, this Court applies the same standard. See Frost v. \nAgnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998); Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435,1441 (9th Cir. \n1991). \n \nSubjecting Mr. Byrd to the search at issue undoubtedly caused him severe pain and harm. The particular search Mr. \nByrd endured was laced with unique characteristics that inflicted a level of pain and suffering that a typical strip search \nwould not. The unique characteristics of this search included the following: (1) The search was conducted by a woman \nin civilian clothing wearing no identification suggesting she was affiliated with the jail system - and, hence, Mr. Byrd \nbelieved she was a typical civilian (which would make any invasive search exponentially more invasive and frigh-\ntening); (2) Mr. Byrd was not given an explanation that this civilian-clad woman was in any way affiliated with the jail \nsystem; (3) The SRT officers pointed laser-directed taser and pepper guns at Mr. Byrd while repeatedly screaming at \nhim to “shut the fuck up” and not ask any questions (thereby making it impossible for Mr. Byrd to eliminate his fear \nand confusion by asking who these civilian-clad people were); (4) Mr. Byrd, already stripped down to his thin pink \nunderwear, was intimately touched on his testicles, perineum and inner buttocks by this civilian-looking person;[FN30] \nand (5) Mr. Byrd was videotaped while being subjected to this frightening and degrading conduct -*40 an action that \nwould accentuate anybody's sense of objectification and degradation during such a search. \n \nFN30. Even Cadet O'Connell openly admitted that having a stranger feel around one's private parts is \n“shocking.” (O'Connell, 634:8-10.) \n \nThe unique characteristics of the search of Mr. Byrd - which dramatically distinguish this search from a typical strip \nsearch in the jail or prison context - are what rendered this search so uniquely painful to Mr. Byrd. Just as the search in \nJordan rose to the level of “infliction of pain” because the inmates who were searched had unique histories of abuse \n(see Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1525-26), the search of Mr. Byrd rose to the level of “infliction of pain” based on the uniquely \ndegrading and offensive manner in which it was conducted. Mr. Byrd testified about the strong feelings of humiliation, \ndegradation and shock he experienced. (Byrd, EOR 598:7-17; 602:3-10.)[FN31] \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 18 \n \nFN31. Moreover, like many of the inmates in Jordan, Mr. Byrd suffers from a history of sexual abuse. (Byrd, \nEOR 600:9-602:2.) \n \nAlthough a detainee would experience discomfort during an invasive search by a male officer in uniform, such a \nsearch is an unavoidable aspect of the jail experience that can reasonably be anticipated. As the expression goes, “don't \ndo the crime if you can't do the time.” It is simply something that must be stomached, considering the context. But no \ndetainee should ever be stripped to his underwear, forced into silence through the threat of laser-directed taser guns, \nbrought into a large room in front of a bunch of civilians, and then intimately touched in his *41 genitalia by a woman \nwearing a t-shirt and blue jeans (while being filmed). We must demand more from our jail officials than to treat de-\ntainees in this way. Because this sort of treatment severely exceeds the “inherent discomforts of confinement” and \nwould cause any reasonable detainee to feel serious humiliation and anguish, Mr. Byrd has satisfied the “pain” re-\nquirement. See Demerv, 378 F.3d at 1029-30 (holding that pretrial detainees “were certainly harmed” for purposes of \ntheir due process claim because the treatment would cause “almost anyone” a level of humiliation that exceeded the \n“inherent discomforts of confinement”). \n \nMoreover, treating Mr. Byrd in this self-evidently demeaning and degrading manner can reflect nothing other than \n“deliberate indifference” on the part of the County. A showing of “deliberate indifference” is established where the \ndefendant knew of the risk of a preventable harm, but failed to take steps to prevent it. See Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1529 \n(citing cases for this proposition). Any thinking person must know that forcing a detainee to strip down to his un-\nderwear and then having his genitalia invasively searched by a woman in a white t-shirt and blue jeans would cause \nthat detainee feelings of shock, degradation and pain. Importantly, this severe pain and suffering was easily pre-\nventable. All the County had to do to prevent inflicting extreme pain on Mr. Byrd was to have one of the many male \nofficers in uniform - standing just 10 feet away - conduct the search of Mr. Byrd. But the County utterly failed to take \nthis basic step. The County's conduct in this *42 case was the paradigm of deliberate indifference.” See Frost v. Agnos, \n152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir. 1998) (“The fact that such basic steps could have better guaranteed Frost's safety pro-\nvides evidence that Defendants were deliberately indifferent in failing to provide any accommodations whatsoever.”). \n \nThis Court should reverse the district court and find that Mr. Byrd's due process rights were violated.[FN32] \n \nFN32. To the extent this Court holds that the search of Mr. Byrd was unconstitutional and reverses the Dis-\ntrict Court's directed verdict, municipal and supervisory liability would be triggered because the search was \nperformed pursuant to the County's well-established policy and practice. See Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles \nPolice Dept., 839 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir. 1988); Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1446-1448 \n(9th Cir. 1991). Thus, if this Court reverses the constitutional determination below, Sheriff Arpaio should be \nreinstated as a Defendant in this action. \n \nIII. THE COUNTY'S DISCRIMINATORY SEARCH POLICY AND THE RESULTING SEARCH OF MR. \nBYRD VIOLATED MR. BYRD'S EQUAL PROTECTION RIGHTS \n \nOn January 18, 2007, the County filed a Motion for Summary Judgment in which it argued that Mr. Byrd's “unrea-\nsonable search” and “cruel and unusual punishment” claims failed as a matter of law. (Id., EOR, Tab 25.) On February \n6, 2007, Mr. Byrd filed opposition papers, and on February 20, 2007, the County filed its reply papers. On May 30, \n2007, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the County's motion for summary judgment. (Order, EOR, \nTab 6.) Although the County made no mention in its summary judgment papers of Mr. *43 Byrd's equal protection \nclaim (Count II of his First Amended Complaint), the District Court sua sponte dismissed the claim for failure to state \na claim. \n \nIn its May 30, 2007 Order, the District Court explained that although “[e]qual protection requires that ‘all persons \nsimilarly situated shall be treated alike,”’ Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim must be dismissed because “[f]or purposes \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 19 \nof equal protection, prisoners are not a suspect class.” (EOR 60.) Thus, the District Court construed Mr. Byrd's equal \nprotection claim as premised on the dissimilar treatment between prisoners and non-prisoners, rather than between \nmen and women. Considering that courts are required to construe pro se complaints liberally (especially in civil rights \ncases) and considering that the County's gender-based policy was before the District Court on summary judgment, the \nDistrict Court's construction and consequent dismissal of Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim was improper.[FN33] \n \nFN33. Mr. Byrd was not appointed pro bono counsel until June 13, 2007. (Order, EOR, Tab 22.) Thus, he \nwas still proceeding pro se when he the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed and ruled upon. \n \nCourts are required to construe pro se complaints liberally and afford the plaintiff the benefit of any doubt, particularly \nin civil rights cases, and should not dismiss claims unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of \nfacts entitling him to relief. See *44Jones v. Community Redev. Agency, 733 F.2d 646, 649 (9th Cir. 1984) (“We must \ndecide if, even when liberally construed, ‘it appears beyond doubt’ that [plaintiff] ‘can prove no set of facts in support \nof his claim which would entitle him to relief.”’ ) (quoting Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)); Bretz v. \nKelman, 773 F.2d 1026, 1027 n.l (9th Cir. 1985) (“[W]e have an obligation where the [plaintiff] is pro se, particularly \nin civil rights cases, to construe the pleadings liberally and to afford the [plaintiff] the benefit of any doubt.”); Johnson \nv. Meltzer, 134 F.3d 1393,1397 (9th Cir. 1998) (reversing dismissal of due process claim brought by pro se plaintiff: \n“Recognizing [plaintiffs] pro se status, we construe his complaint liberally to state a claim for violation of his con-\nstitutionally protected liberty interest in bodily integrity.”); Karim-Panahi, 839 F.2d 621, 623 (9th Cir. 1988) (same). \n \nThe District Court's decision to sua sponte dismiss Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim was improper. The County's strip \nsearch policy expressly discriminates against men - by requiring female detainees to be partially strip searched only by \nfemale officers, yet allowing male detainees to be partially strip searched by either male or female officers. The \nCounty attached its search policy (Policy DH-3) to its motion for summary judgment, and argued in its motion that the \nsearch of Mr. Byrd qualified as a “frisk” search. That policy, which was before *45 the Court on summary judgment, \nplainly reads: “Male inmates may be frisk searched by either male or female officers. Female inmates will only be \nsearched by female officers, absent exigent circumstances.” (Policy DH-3, EOR 855-62.) Under the County's policy, \nthe cross-gender search of Mr. Byrd was permissible, yet an equivalent cross-gender search of a female detainee \nwould be impermissible. \n \nConsidering that this facially discriminatory policy was before the District Court and considering the obligation facing \nthe District Court to construe Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim liberally, it was manifestly improper to dismiss that \nclaim. Because the County's search policy expressly treats men differently than women,:it is subject to intermediate \nscrutiny and, accordingly, is unconstitutional unless it serves an important government interest and is substantially \nrelated to achieving that interest. See Hibbs v. Dept. of Human Res., 273 F.3d 844, 855 (9th Cir. 2001); See also Orr v. \nOrr, 440 U.S. 268, 278-79 (1979) (“The fact that the classification expressly discriminates against men rather than \nwomen does not protect it from scrutiny. To withstand scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, a classification by \ngender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those ob-\njectives.”) (citation omitted); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996) (same). Importantly, the burden \nof demonstrating that the discriminatory conduct is substantially related to an important governmental interest is on \nthe government - and not on the person *46 challenging the conduct. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533; Hibbs, 273 F.3d at \n855; Monterey Mechanical Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 713 (9th Cir. 1997). \n \nAt the time the District Court dismissed the equal protection claim, there was no basis for believing the County could \nmeet its heavy burden. And revealingly, the evidence adduced at trial conclusively demonstrates that the County \nwould not have met its burden, as the County's three witnesses uniformly admitted that there have been no instances of \nadverse employment ramifications for women resulting from historical attempts at protecting the privacy interests of \nmale detainees and inmates. (See supra at page 27.)[FN34] \n \nFN34. Where the government is unable to provide concrete evidence demonstrating a need to discriminate on \nthe basis of gender, courts invalidate the governmental action as violative of the equal protection clause. See, \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 20 \ne.g., Monterey, 123 F.3d at 713; Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 151-52(1980); Mississippi \nUniv. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 729 (1982). Courts have also invalidated, under the equal pro-\ntection clause, strip search policies that treat women and men differently. See, e.g.,Jones v. Murphy, 470 F. \nSupp. 2d 537, 549 & n.19 (D. Me. 2007) (holding that prison policy allowing strip searches of all female \ndetainees but not males violated equal protection clause); Ford v. City of Boston, 154 F. Supp. 2d 131, 151 (D. \nMass. 2001) (same). \n \nBy construing Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim strictly, rather than liberally - as it was required, and by sua sponte \ndismissing the claim notwithstanding the County's facially discriminatory policy and utter failure to provide evidence \n(or even argument) justifying its gender-based discrimination, the District Court clearly erred. \n \n*47 IV. THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY ALLOWING THE COUNTY TO \nPROSPER FROM ITS ILLEGAL DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY AND BY COMPOUNDING THE \nPREJUDICE CAUSED TO MR. BYRD \n \nEach of the three factual questions that were given to the jury turned on what occurred on October 28, 2004 in the \nDurango Jail. For example, one of the critical issues in the trial was whether Cadet O'Connell - who was performing \nher first ever search on a real detainee - improperly touched or squeezed Mr. Byrd's penis. The jury was instructed to \nautomatically find in favor of Mr. Byrd if it determined that Cadet O'Connell squeezed or kneaded Mr. Byrd's penis. \n(Jury instructions, “First Unreasonable Search Claim,” EOR 80; Jury verdict, EOR 77.) Thus, independent of the \nDistrict Court's ruling that the search was constitutional if the County's version of the search was accurate, Mr. Byrd \nwould have nonetheless prevailed below had the jury believed him that Cadet O'Connell squeezed his penis during the \nsearch. Mr. Byrd testified that she did squeeze his penis (id., EOR 586:12-15), and Cadet O'Connell testified that she \ndid not. (Id, EOR 637:24- 638:1.) It was a classic case of “he said, she said.” \n \nTragically, the only reason the jury was handed a “he said, she said” scenario is because the County failed to preserve \ncritical evidence in this case. Amazingly, the October 28, 2004 underwear searches of the detainees at Durango Jail \nwere videotaped. But proceeding p for the first 2.5 years of this litigation, Mr. Byrd made no discovery requests of any \nkind. When he was appointed counsel just two *48 months before trial, he told his counsel that a camera man filmed \nthe search by Cadet O'Connell and that the videotape would support his version of the incident. In response to a re-\nquest for the videotape by Mr. Byrd's counsel, the County failed to produce the footage of the search of Mr. Byrd - and \ninstead produced the “Video Yearbook” of the cadet's Academy - a highly edited collection of footage that docu-\nmented each of the stages of training the cadets received during their program. The “Video Yearbook” included a \nsnippet from the October 28,2004 searches of the cells (not detainees) at Durango Jail - thereby confirming Mr. Byrd's \nassertion that there was videotape evidence of the events that day. \n \nIn response to Mr. Byrd's counsel's additional request for the unedited video footage from October 28, 2004 (including \nthe footage of the search of Mr. Byrd), the County claimed that no such footage existed at that time. (Defendants' \nobjection to plaintiffs requested negative inference, Tab 15.) But as Cadet O'Connell testified at trial, there was ad-\nditional footage of the searches that day at Durango Jail.[FN35] Consistent with this testimony, Mr. Byrd testified that \nthe video camera filmed him while Cadet O'Connell searched him. (Byrd, EOR 602:15- 603:4; 605:5-21.) Thus, the \nuncontroverted evidence in the record is that Mr. Byrd was filmed during his search. Furthermore, it is uncontroverted \nand admitted by *49 Cadet O'Connell that additional footage existed from the October 28, 2004 underwear searches at \nDurango Jail that could have been relevant to this lawsuit. (See supra.) But the County did not produce this unedited \nfootage, claiming that if it existed, it was destroyed pursuant to the County's document “retention” policy - which is \ntwo  years.[FN36]  (Defendants'  Objection  to  plaintiffs  requested  negative  inference,  EOR  458:11-19;  Peterson, \n347:2-18.) \n \nFN35. See O'Connell, EOR 301:4-8 (“Q: Now that footage that we just saw, it doesn't represent all the foo-\ntage that was shot on that date, does it? A: As far as I know, no. Q: There was other footage shot as far as you \nknow; yes? A: Yes.”). \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 21 \n \nFN36. That the Maricopa County jail and prison system's document retention policy is two years is hardly \ncoincidental, considering that the statute of limitations for prisoner civil rights actions under § 1983 in Ari-\nzona is two years. See TwoRivers v. Lewis, 174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir. 1999) (“In Arizona, the courts apply a \ntwo-year statute of limitations to § 1983 claims.”); see also Arizona Revised Statute § 12-542 (setting the \nstatute of limitations for injuries “to the person” at two years). \n \nIn other words, the County's explanation for not preserving the original footage is that, pursuant to its document \nretention policy, all documents and other evidence is routinely destroyed two years after it was created. The County \nclaimed that the unedited footage requested by Mr. Byrd was properly destroyed pursuant to this policy because Mr. \nByrd did not specifically request the evidence until over two years after it was created. Explaining why the footage \nwas destroyed, the County stated, “[Mr. Byrd] filed suit, but he did not request the tape” within two years of the \nincident. (Defendants' Objection to Plaintiffs requested negative inference, EOR 458:11-19.) The testimony of Cap-\ntain Peterson, who was the Commander of Durango Jail and responsible for overseeing all of the jail's policies, *50 \nconfirms that this is the policy and practice of the County. When asked by his counsel, Ms. Brandon, whether the \nCounty's document retention policy authorizes evidence to be destroyed unless the opposing attorney “specifically \nrequests” a piece of evidence within two years of the document's creation, Captain Peterson answered affirmatively, \nexplaining, “if [the evidence] is still being retained at the request from an attorney for a particular document, then yes, \nwe would provide it with a court order.” (Peterson, 347:2-18.) \n \nThe County's policy is simple: Even if a lawsuit is filed against it, it may destroy evidence two years after that evi-\ndence is created, unless the opposing attorney specifically requests that particular piece of evidence. Indeed, this is \nexactly what occurred in this case. Although Mr. Byrd filed his federal lawsuit a mere 30 days after the October 28, \n2004 search at Durango Jail, the unedited footage of that search was destroyed because Mr. Byrd did not specifically \nrequest the footage until after October 28, 2006. \n \nThe County's policy is a blatant violation of law. It is universally accepted that: \nA litigant is under a duty to preserve what it knows, or reasonably should know, is relevant in the action, is reasonably \ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, is reasonably likely to be requested during discovery. \nTherefore, once a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it must suspend its routine document retention/destruction \npolicy and put in place a ‘litigation hold’ to ensure the preservation of relevant documents. \n \n*51 Columbia Pictures Ind. V. Bunnell, No. CV 06-1093, 2007 WL 2080419, at *14 (C.D. Cal. May 29, 2007) \n(emphasis added) (citations omitted); accord In re Napster. Inc. Copyright Litig., 462 F. Supp. 2d 1060, 1070 (N.D. \nCal. 2006); Samsung Elect. Co., Ltd. V. Rambus, Inc., 439 F. Supp. 2d 524, 543 (E.D. Va. 2006).[FN37] When Mr. Byrd \nfiled his lawsuit 30 days after the October 28, 2004 incident, the County not only could “reasonably anticipate” liti-\ngation, it actually knew that litigation was underway. By failing to place a “litigation hold” on its document retention \npolicy and by permitting relevant evidence to be destroyed on the ground that Mr. Byrd had not specifically requested \nit, the County patently violated the law and severely prejudiced Mr. Byrd. \n \nFN37. See also Federal Procedure, 10A Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 26:849 (2007) ( “Once a party reasonably an-\nticipates litigation, it has a duty to suspend, as to documents that may be relevant to anticipated litigation, any \nroutine document purging system that might be in effect, and the failure to do so constitutes spoliation....A \ndocument retention policy adopted or utilized to justify the destruction of relevant evidence is not a valid \ndocument retention policy[.]”). \n \nThe District Court compounded the prejudice to Mr. Byrd by denying Mr. Byrd's requested negative inference in-\nstruction and by permitting the County to introduce, over Mr. Byrd's objection, the misleading and prejudicial “Video \nYearbook” of the cadet's Academy. In denying Mr. Byrd's requested negative inference instruction,[FN38] the Court \nincorrectly concluded that the underlying *52 question of whether the County acted improperly was for the jury. \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 22 \n(Transcript, EOR 414:15-17 (“It's up to the jury to decide whether the factual basis for it is satisfied or not.”).) But the \nCounty had openly acknowledged that it routinely destroys documents even after litigation is commenced, unless a \n“specific request” is made for a particular document.(See supra.) This policy is illegal, as a matter of law, and the \nDistrict Court erred by refusing to reach that conclusion on its own.[FN39] \n \nFN38. Mr. Byrd respectfully directs the Court to the full version of the requested instruction. (EOR, Tab 3.) \n \nFN39. Instead, the District Court crafted a vague instruction that made no mention of the lost footage from \nOctober 28, 2004 and that remained utterly neutral as to which party possibly breached its obligations under \nthe law: “If a party with such notice [of the assertion of a claim] fails to preserve evidence through some fault \nof its own, you may draw an inference that the evidence not presented would have been favorable to the \nopposing party.” (Jury instructions, EOR 83:12-15.) This instruction was truly a “bite without teeth.” It is \nvague and esoteric, and by not taking a position on whether the County breached its duties under the law, it \nfrankly does nothing to correct the substantial prejudice Mr. Byrd suffered from the destruction of evidence. \n \nThe prejudice to Mr. Byrd was further compounded when the County sought to introduce its highly edited “Video \nYearbook” into evidence and the District Court overruled Mr. Byrd's objection that the edited video was unduly \nprejudicial and misleading (as well as irrelevant) under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. (Transcript, 466:5-468:7; \n472:14-22; (objections by Mr. Byrd's counsel); 477:23- 25 (District Court reserves ruling on the issue until later); \n251:9-11 (District Court rules that it is admissible).) It is undisputed that the “Video Yearbook” includes no *53 \nfootage of the search of Mr. Byrd or even of the other searches conducted by Cadet O'Connell that day. To the contrary, \nthe video depicts searches conducted by other cadets on their supervising officers (who were dressed up in prisoner \nattire). The obvious - and unanswerable - question is: why was the “Video Yearbook” admitted into evidence? The \nvideotape carried probative value towards any of the issues before the jury. \n \nThe only role the “Video Yearbook” played was to prejudice Mr. Byrd and mislead the jurors. The “Video Yearbook” \ncaptured footage of all of the hard work, dedication, sacrifices and memorable moments tallied during the cadet's \nAcademy, and thereby substantially prejudice Mr. Byrd by depicting the cadets (including Cadet O'Connell) in such a \nfond and tender light.[FN40] Indeed, “Video Yearbooks” - by their very nature - are designed to leave the viewer with \nfeelings of endearment and warmth towards the featured individuals. The “Video Yearbook” therefore had a signif-\nicant likelihood of unfairly prejudicing Mr. Byrd by improperly appealing to the emotions of the jurors. See Fed. R. \nEvid. 403, Commentary Note (“Unfair prejudice' within its context means an undue tendency to suggest decision on \nan improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.”); *54United States v. Bowen, 857 F.2d 1337, \n1341 (9th Cir. 1988) (“[P]rejudice outweighs probative value where the facts arouse the jury's feelings for one side \nwithout regard to the probative value of the evidence”). \n \nFN40. The “Video Yearbook” even showed some of the cadets being pepper sprayed in the face - and suf-\nfering in pain as a consequence. Counsel for the County went out of her way to ask Cadet O'Connell if she \nwas the first cadet featured in the video to be pepper sprayed. (O'Connell, EOR 285:4-15.) Cadet O'Connell \nanswered that it was, in fact, her. (Id.) \n \nPerhaps more significantly, the “Video Yearbook” also created a substantial risk of misleading the jury into believing \nthat the manner in which the searches were conducted on the videotape accurately reflected the manner in which Cadet \nO'Connell conducted the search of Mr. Byrd. The footage of other cadets performing full-clothed searches on their \nsupervisors carried zero probative value about the manner in which Cadet O'Connell performed the underwear search \nof Mr. Byrd. It was wholly improper for this self-serving and misleading footage to admitted into evidence. See United \nStates v. Foster, 30 F.3d 65, 68 (7th Cir. 1994) (where defendant was charged with a crime, excluding his requested \nvideotaped accounts of other people who were wrongfully accused of the same crime in the past, since the videotape \nhad “little probative value” about his actions, yet had “great potential to prejudice the government's case and mislead \nthe jury”). \n\n2008 WL 592053 (C.A.9)   Page 23 \n \nThe “Video Yearbook” therefore carried a strong likelihood of improperly prejudicing Mr. Byrd and misleading the \njury, yet carried no probative value as to the manner in which Mr. Byrd was searched by Cadet O'Connell. Because the \nprejudicial and misleading impact of the video substantially outweighed the probative value (or lack thereof), it was an \nabuse of discretion for the District *55 Court to admit it. See United States v. Hitt, 981 F.2d 422, 424-25 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(reversing jury verdict based on the district court's improper admission of a photograph: “Where the evidence is of \nvery slight (if any) probative value, it's an abuse of discretion to admit it if there's even a modest likelihood of unfair \nprejudice or a small risk of misleading the jury.”); United States v. Layton, 767 F.2d 549, 555-56 (9th Cir. 1985) \n(holding that the tape recordings probative value was “weak” and therefore outweighed by the risk of potential pre-\njudice and confusion caused by the tape). \n \nIn sum, by allowing the County to obtain a windfall gain from its patently illegally document “retention” policy, the \nDistrict Court abused its discretion. The County improperly destroyed evidence directly relevant to Mr. Byrd's claims \n(the unedited footage from October 28, 2004), yet managed to not only avoid any negative repercussions (since the \nDistrict Court denied the requested negative inference instruction and failed to conclude that the County breached its \nduties), but managed to be affirmatively rewarded by successfully introducing into evidence the highly prejudicial and \nmisleading “Video Yearbook.” This sequence of events was a grave miscarriage of justice, and it is hardly surprising \nthat the jury found against Mr. Byrd regarding the manner in which the search was conducted. \n \nThis Court should order a new trial based on this miscarriage of justice. A clear message must be sent to the County \nthat it cannot continue to destroy relevant *56 evidence in federal proceedings under the simplistic guise of a docu-\nment “retention” policy. The County made no attempt to implement a “litigation hold” in this case and, consequently, \ncrucial evidence was destroyed. This Court should vacate the jury verdict and order a new trial so that the County is \nnot so blatantly rewarded for its illegal policy. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Mr. Byrd respectfully requests this Court to (1) hold that the search of Mr. Byrd was un-\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and, hence, reverse the District Court's decision to the contrary; (2) hold that \nthe search of Mr. Byrd violated Mr. Byrd's due process rights and, hence, reverse the District Court's decision to the \ncontrary; (3) hold that the County's facially discriminatory search policy violates the equal protection clause and, \nhence, reverse the District Court's dismissal of Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim; and (4) vacate the jury verdict and \norder a new trial based on the severe prejudice Mr. Byrd suffered in this case as a result of the County's patently illegal \ndocument retention policy and the District Court's associated evidentiary rulings. \n \nCharles E.

CARPENTER, JR. \nDeputy County Attorney \n9  Attorneys for Maricopa County \nDefendants \n10   \n11  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n12  I.  Standard of Proof. \n13  Summary judgment is appropriate where “there is no genuine issue as to \n14  any material fact, and t he moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \n15  law.”  Rule 56(c), FED. R. CIV. P.; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, \n16  106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552 (1986).   Disputes must be material.  Id.  Factual disputes \n17  that are irrelevant or unnecessar y will not affect the outcome.   Anderson v. \n18  Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510 (1986).  \n19    In order to establish the existence of a “genuine” issue of material fact, \n20  Plaintiff must establish that a reasonable jury could return a verdict in his favor.  \n21  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 \n22  (1986).  There is no issue for trial unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the \n2 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 39    Filed 01/18/07   Page 3 of 8\n \n1  non-moving party.  If the evi dence is merely colorable or is not si gnificantly \n2  probative, summary judgment may be granted. Id at 249.   \n3  II.  Plaintiff Fails To Establish He Suffered A Physical Injury While \nIncarcerated As Required By 42 U.S.C. §1997e(e). \n4   \nPlaintiff  filed his ori ginal  Complaint  in  District  Court  on  November  26, \n5 \n2004. Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, filed on June 14 , 2005, pursuant to the \n6 \nCourt’s screening order, alleged that Officer O’Connell violated his Eighth and \n7 \nFourteenth Amendment civil rights by conducting an illegal body “cavity”1 search \n8 \nwhich he alleges is sexual assault and sexual harassment. Plaintiff alleges that \n9 \nCaptain  Peterson  supervised  Officer  O’Connell  and therefor e,  is liable f or \n10 \nviolating Plaintiff’s civil rights. Additionally, Plaintiff claims that Defendant Arpaio, \n11 \nis liable for violation of Plaintiff’s civil rights, as the polic y maker for the jails. \n12 \nPlaintiff  alleges he suffered psycholog ical  trauma, emotional distress, \n13 \nimpermissible embarrassment, public humiliation, mental anguish and emotional \n14 \nscarring as a result of this incident.   All of the injuries alleged are of a mental or \n15 \nemotional nature.  Plaintiff has not alleged or shown a physical injury. \n16 \nPursuant to 42 U. S.C. §1997e(e), a prisoner may not recover in a civil \n17 \naction without a physical injury.  Section 1997e(e) specifies: \n18 \ne) Limitation on recovery \n19   \nNo Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, \n20 \n                                            \n21  1 Plaintiff uses the term “body cavity search” but specifically describes that she, “grabbed his genitals twice, \nand then “ramed [sic] her index finger through the crack” of his buttocks (First Amended Complaint at 4).  \n22  Plaintiff alleges that he was wearing his boxer shorts at the time of the search.  \n \n3 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 39    Filed 01/18/07   Page 4 of 8\n \n1  prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered \nwhile in custody without a prior showing of physical injury. \n2   \n   In  most body search cases, th e  court has not been presented with \n3 \nevidence  pointing  to more than mo mentary  discomfort  or emotional \n4 \nembarrassment caused by the search procedures.  In Grummett v. Rushen, 779 \n5 \nF.2d  491 (9th Cir.1985), the Nint h  Circuit  Court of Appeals considered t he \n6 \nconstitutionality  of pat do wn  body searches   performed  by  female guards   on \n7 \nmale  prisoners and concluded that  the  inmates had not shown sufficient \n8 \nevidence of pain to make out a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim. Id. at 493 \n9 \nn. 1.   Since Plaintiff has neither alleged nor established any physical injury this \n10 \nComplaint should be dismissed as a matter of law. \n11 \nIII.  Frisk, Body or Pat-Down Searches Have  been Found to be a \n12 \nLegitimate Means of Securing Penal Institutions.   \n \n13 \nThe Ninth Circuit in Grummett said, “. . . routine pat-down searches, which \n14 \ninclude the groin area, and which are otherwise justified by security needs, do \n15 \nnot  violate  the Fourteenth   Amendment because a corre ctional  officer  of the \n16 \nopposite  gender cond ucts  such a search.  Accord  Bagley  v.  Watson,  579 \n17 \nF.Supp. 1099 (D.Or.1983); Smith v. Fairman, 678 F.2d 52 (7th Cir.1982), cert. \n18 \ndenied, 461 U.S. 907, 103 S.Ct. 187 9, 76 L.Ed.2d 810 (1983).” Grummett v. \n19 \nRushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495 (9th Cir.1985)\n20 \nOfficer  O’Connell  conducted  the frisk (bo dy)  search  of Plaintif f  in \n21 \naccordance with MCSO policy DH-3; in the presence of her supervisor, Captain \n22 \n4 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 39    Filed 01/18/07   Page 5 of 8\n \n1  Peterson; and in the proc ess demonstrated and instructed detention officers in \n2  the proper manner in which to conduct  such a search for contraband.  She did \n3  so over his clothes, namely his MCSO boxer shorts.  Despite Plaintiff’s colorful \n4  street  language  in describing the search ,  the  specific  conduct  is  strictly i n \n5  accordance with the MCSO policy, DH-3.  \n6  MCSO Policy DH-3 defines a “Frisk (Body) Search” as follows: \n7  Carefully examining an inmate by inspecting his clothi ng, and feeling the \ncontours of his clot hed body.  The inmate’ s shoes and socks may be \n8  removed during this process.  An inmate’s ears, nose, hair and throat may \nbe visually checked during this search.   \n9   \n The anal cleft or di vide between the buttocks sometimes referred to as \n10 \n“buttock cleavage” is not a b ody cavity.  Plaintiff in the Co mplaint alleges that \n11 \nwhat Officer O’Connell di d was run her  hand along the “crack” between his \n12 \nbuttocks.  This is exactly what is meant by policy DH-3 which permits, “feeling \n13 \nthe contours of [an inmate’s] clothed body.” 2  It is not a body  cavity search any \n14 \nmore than a pat-down in the underarm area, in the area of cleavage between or \n15 \nunderneath the breasts of a female, or in the area of folds created by layers of \n16 \nfat.  All of these ar eas are known to be  potential locations for an individual to \n17 \ncarry and conceal items.    \n18 \nThe commonly understood meaning of “body cavity” in humans includes \n19 \nonly the stomach, t he rectum, as well as the vagina in  females. The State of  \n20 \n21 \n                                            \n22 \n2 Policy DH-3 also permits Invasive body cavity searches by medical personnel. \n5 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 39    Filed 01/18/07   Page 6 of 8\n \n1  Washington  has articulated the differ ence  between body   cavities  and s trip \n2  searches in a statute, RCW 10.79.070: \n3  Strip search means having a person remove or arrange some or all of his \nor her clothing so as to permit an inspection of the genitals, buttocks, \n4  anus, or undergarments of the person or breasts of a female person. \n \n5  (2) ‘Body cavity search’ means the touching or probing of a person's body \ncavity, whether or not there is actual penetration of the body cavity. \n6   \n(3) ‘Body cavity’ means the stomach or rectum of a person and the vagina \nof a female person. . . . \n7 \n \n \n8 \nIn State v. Jones, 887 P. 2d 461 (1995), the court determined that a \n9 \nsearch during which a pl astic tube was removed from the anus  was a strip \n10 \nsearch rather than a bo dy cavity search.  In  State v. Ocain, 118 Wash. App. \n11 \n1043, 2003 WL 22173057 (Wash. App. Div. 1, 2003), the court deter mined that \n12 \nthe mere incidental touching of the outside of Ocain’s anus in effectuating a strip \n13 \nsearch for drugs protruding from his anus did not convert the strip sear ch into a \n14 \nbody cavity search. \n15 \nFor the foregoing reasons, defendants are entitled to summary judgment  \n16 \nas a matter of law. \n17 \n \n… \n18 \n \n… \n19 \n \n… \n20 \n \n… \n21 \n \n… \n22 \n6 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 39    Filed 01/18/07   Page 7 of 8\n \n1  RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 18th day of January 2007.  \n \n2  ANDREW P.

Waiver of Affirmative Defenses\n18 Affirmative defenses are waived if the party fails to assert them at the time specified\n19 by the rules.  See Simpson v. Alaska State Com’n for Human Rights, 608 F.2d 1171, 1174\n20 (9th Cir. 1979).   If a defendant decides to assert a Rule 12(b) defense by omtion, he must do\n21 so before filing the answer.  Fed. Rule Civ. P.1 2(b).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n22 12(a)(1), a defendant shall serve an answer within 60 days after the request for a waiver was\n23 sent.  Thus, it follows that an unenumerated 12(b) motion to dismiss for nonexhaustion that\n24 is filed after the 60 day time frame provided under Rule 12 is untimely.\n25 Here, Defendants did not raise exhaustion as an affirmative defense in their answer,\n26 nor did Defendants timely file a motion to dismiss for nonexhaustion within the 60 day time\n27 frame provided by Rule 12 (Doc. # 28). \n28\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 65    Filed 06/20/07   Page 2 of 2\n1 II. Untimeliness of the Motion\n2 Defendants’  motion  is also untim ely  under the Court’s May 22, 2006 Ca se\n3 Management Order (Doc. # 37).  That order required that all dispositive motions be filed no\n4 later than March 26, 2007.  Defendants have not filed a motion to extend the time to file a\n5 new dispositive motion.  Consequently, such a motion is untimely and will not be considered.\n6 III. Amendment\n7 The Court may consider Defendants’ m otion as a m otion to amend to add the\n8 affirmative  defendant of nonexhaustion.  “The following factors guide a court’s\n9 determination of whether a motion to amend should be granted: (1) undue delay; (2) bad\n10 faith; (3) futility of am endment; and (4) prejudice to the opposing party.”  Forsyth v.\n11 Humana, Inc., 114 F.3d 1467, 1482 (9th  Cir. 1997).  Three of the four factors, however,\n12 weigh against providing leave to am end.  This ca se is approaching three years old and\n13 Defendants certainly have had the opportunity to file a motion to dismiss for nonexhaustion\n14 before the eve of trial.  Moreover, Defendants’  request is futile as their motion is clearly\n15 barred by the Court’s Case Management Order.  Finally, this motion does prejudice Plaintiff\n16 in that the Court has already imposed firm deadlines for the final preparations for trial in this\n17 case, discovery is long closed, and Plaintiff would be unable to take discovery on this new\n18 defense in time for trial.  Defendant’s attempt to bring up a new defense after the close of\n19 discovery, after the deadline for dispositive motions, and on the eve of trial is an extrem e\n20 example of an unjustified late defense.\n21 In view of the rapidly approaching deadlines in preparation for trial in this case and\n22 the clearly untimeliness of the Motion to  Dismiss, the Court will rule upon the m otion\n23 without awaiting a response.\n24 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED THAT Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Doc. #\n25 62) is DENIED.\n26 DATED this 20th day of June, 2007.\n27\n28\n- 2 -",

Byrd (Byrd), a pretrial detainee at the time, was\nsubjected to a cross-gender strip search of his genital area.\nBecause the strip search was unreasonable under the facts of\nthis case, we reverse the district court’s entry of judgment in\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 3 of 35\n370 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nfavor  of Defendants-Appellees Maricopa County Sheriff’s\nDepartment and then-cadet Kathleen O’Connell (O’Connell).\nI.  BACKGROUND\nWhile Byrd was a pretrial detainee in a minimum-security\nfacility, Maricopa County jail officials ordered a search of\nByrd’s entire housing unit (approximately ninety inmates). It\nis undisputed that no emergency existed. Rather, the search\nwas precipitated by the occurrence of several fights and a sus-\npicion of contraband in the jail.\nMaricopa County Special Response Team officers carrying\npepper ball guns and tasers entered the facility. They ordered\nByrd to remove all clothing except his boxer shorts, which\nwere pink and made of a very thin material. Once the inmates\nin the housing unit formed a line, jail officials ordered four to\nsix inmates at a time into the  “day room,” a common area, to\nbe searched. Cadets from the detention officer training acad-\nemy searched the inmates with training supervisors present.\nThe cadets wore jeans and white t-shirts with their last names\nprinted  on the back. They were not otherwise identified. 1\nApproximately twenty-five to thirty cadets and ten to fifteen\nuniformed detention officers were present in the day room.\nHowever, none of the detention officers participated in the\nsearches. At least one person videotaped the cadets’ search of\nthe inmates. \n1This fact is important because of our undisputed recognition of the\n“feelings of humiliation and degradation associated with forcibly exposing\none’s nude body to strangers . . . ” Way v. County of Ventura , 445 F.3d\n1157, 1160 (9th Cir. 2006), quoting Thompson v. City of Los Angeles, 885\nF.2d 1439, 1446 (9th Cir. 1989); see also Hayes v. Marriott, 70 F.3d 1144,\n1147 (10th Cir. 1995). After years of litigation, the dissent in hindsight\ndeclares that “it was surely apparent that the cadets were present in an\nofficial capacity.” Dissenting Opinion, p. 401. n.5. However, that appar-\nentness is not reflected in the record. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 4 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 371\nByrd was searched by a female cadet. He testified that, dur-\ning the searches, male detention officers stood by watching.\nThe  record clearly reflects that only four inmates were\nsearched at a time, by no means an overwhelming number. 2\nAlthough no factual finding was made on this point by either\nthe judge or the jury,  contrary to the dissent, it was by no\nmeans “undisputed . . . that the County did not have sufficient\nnumbers of male detention officers to conduct searches of\nmale inmates without the assistance of female officers. ” Dis-\nsenting Opinion, pp. 397-98.\nWhen Byrd entered the day room, the cadets were lined up\nand waiting. O’Connell ordered him to turn away from her,\nspread his feet and raise his arms above his head. Wearing\nlatex rubber gloves,  she pulled out Byrd’s waistband a few\ninches and felt the waistband to make sure nothing was hid-\nden in it. O’Connell did not look inside Byrd’s boxer shorts.\nNext, O’Connell placed one hand on Byrd’s lower back\nholding the back part of the boxer shorts  and, with her other\nhand, searched over his boxer shorts, his outer thigh from his\nhip to the bottom of the shorts. She then moved her hand from\nhis outer thigh to the bottom of the shorts on his inner thigh\nand applied slight pressure to feel his inner thigh for contra-\nband. Using the back of her hand,  O’Connell moved Byrd’s\npenis and scrotum out of the way applying slight pressure to\nsearch the area. O’Connell then searched the other side using\nthe same technique.\n2The dissent takes issue with Byrd’s testimony that male officers were\nstanding idly by. See Dissenting Opinion, p. 397 n.4. However, this is pre-\ncisely the type of evidence considered by the Fifth Circuit in  Moore v.\nCarwell, 168 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir. 1999) (giving credence to Plaintiff’s\ncontention that male officers were present during the search, thereby sug-\ngesting that male officers were available to conduct the searches). Indeed,\nthe referenced testimony of Officer Peterson does not specifically address\nthe availability of the male officers to conduct the searches in question.\nSee id. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 5 of 35\n372 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nFinally, O’Connell placed her hand at the bottom of Byrd’s\nbuttocks and ran her hand up to separate the cheeks while\napplying slight pressure, to search for contraband inside his\nanus. O’Connell estimated that the search lasted ten to twenty\nseconds, and Byrd estimated that the search took sixty sec-\nonds. After the search was completed, Byrd was directed to\ngo to the opposite end of the day room, and sit facing the\nwall.\nOn the day of the search, Byrd filed an inmate grievance\ncomplaining that O’Connell  “grab[bed] [his] balls and [his]\nscrotum.” Byrd filed three additional inmate grievances to no\navail.  Byrd subsequently filed a  pro  se  complaint  naming\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio (Arpaio), O’Connell,\nand Captain Austin Peterson (Peterson) as defendants. The\ncomplaint alleged that the search violated Byrd’s right under\nthe Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches,\nand Byrd’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal\nprotection of the laws and substantive due process protection\nto be free from punishment. 3\nThe district court dismissed Byrd’s equal protection claim\nbut denied Maricopa County’s motion for summary judgment\non Byrd’s Fourth Amendment unreasonable search claim and\nhis Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claims.\nThe court also appointed counsel to represent Byrd at trial.\nFollowing the presentation of evidence, the district court\ngranted judgment as a matter of law in favor of  Peterson,\nO’Connell’s supervisor, on the premise that Peterson was not\nconnected to the search. Byrd does not challenge this ruling\non appeal. \n3Byrd’s complaint actually referenced his Eighth Amendment right to\nbe free from cruel and unusual punishment.  The district court properly\nrecharacterized this claim as a substantive due process claim under the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 & n.16\n(1979) (explaining that the Due Process Clause applies when “considering\nthe claims of pretrial detainees”). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 6 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 373\nAdditionally, the district court granted judgment as a matter\nof law in favor of Arpaio, finding that Byrd presented no evi-\ndence that Arpaio had instituted an unconstitutional policy or\nhad personally participated in the search. The court also ruled\nas a matter of law that the search was constitutionally valid.\nThus, with O’Connell as the only defendant, the district court\nnarrowed the issues to be presented to the jury to these three: 4\n(1) whether “O’Connell deprived [Byrd] of his right against\nunreasonable search by intentionally squeezing or kneading\nhis penis or scrotum or improperly touching his anus through\nhis underwear;” (2) whether  “O’Connell deprived [Byrd] of\ndue process of law” by “intentionally squeez[ing] or knead[-\ning] [Byrd’s] penis or scrotum or improperly touch[ing] his\nanus  through his underwear, ”  with  “[O’Connell’s]  actions\ninflict[ing]  [wanton] pain on [Byrd]; ”  and (3) whether\n“O’Connell deprived [Byrd] of his right against unreasonable\nsearch by conducting a search not done for [an] identified\nsecurity need.”5\nThe district court’s formulation of these three issues for the\njury’s consideration completely eliminated the jury’s contem-\nplation  of whether the cross-gender strip search violated\nByrd’s right under the Fourth Amendment to be free from\nunreasonable search. Instead, the district court’s formulation\nof the factual issues presented to the jury limited the determi-\nnation  of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment to\nwhether  O’Connell  “intentionally  squeezed or kneaded\n[Byrd’s] penis or scrotum or improperly touched his anus\n4Because O’Connell was acting in her capacity as a cadet with the Mari-\ncopa  County Sheriff’s Office, Maricopa County remained a putative\ndefendant.

Belshe , 180 F.3d 1104,\n1108 (9th Cir. 1999) ( “The general rule is that relief sought nominally\nagainst a state officer is in fact against the sovereign if the decree would\noperate against the latter. ”) (citations, alterations, and internal quotation\nmarks omitted). \n5Because this description is virtually identical to that articulated by our\ncolleagues in dissent, see Dissenting Opinion, p. 393, we are puzzled by\nthe accusation that we “paint[ed] the facts differently on appeal. ” Id. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 7 of 35\n374 BYRD v.

Maricopa County Sheriff’s Dep’t, 565 F.3d 1205\n(9th Cir. 2009), a divided panel of this court affirmed the dis-\ntrict court’s judgment. We subsequently granted rehearing en\nbanc, 583 F.3d 673 (9th Cir. 2009).\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\nWe review an order granting or denying judgment as a mat-\nter of law de novo. See Mangum v. Action Collection Serv.,\nInc., 575 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir. 2009). “Judgment as a matter\nof law is appropriate when the evidence presented at trial per-\nmits only one reasonable conclusion. That is, a motion for\njudgment as a matter of law is properly granted only if no rea-\nsonable juror could find in the non-moving party’s favor. ” Id.\nat 938-39 (citations, alteration, and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\nIII.  DISCUSSION\nA.  Substantive  Due Process and Equal Protection\nClaims\nByrd did not strenuously press his substantive due process\nand equal protection claims during the  en banc argument. In\nfact, Byrd’s counsel candidly acknowledged that there was  “a\nbasis” for the panel’s affirmance of the district court’s deci-\nsion to dismiss Byrd’s equal protection claim for failure to\nstate a claim. We review this basis for dismissal  de novo, and\nmay affirm the dismissal for any reason supported by the\nrecord. See Thompson v. Paul, 547 F.3d 1055, 1058-59 (9th\nCir. 2008).\nA peripheral equal protection issue was in the air because\nof the text of Maricopa County’s Contraband Control Policy\n(Contraband Policy) distinguishing between male and female\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 8 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 375\ninmates when a frisk search is involved. According to the\nContraband Policy, “[m]ale inmates may be frisk searched by\neither male or female officers[,] ” but “[f]emale inmates will\nonly be searched by female officers, absent exigent circum-\nstances.” However, there are two considerations that counsel\nagainst delving too deeply into the equal protection issue. The\nfirst is Byrd’s concession of  “a basis” for the ultimate dis-\nmissal of his equal protection claim. The second is the lack of\na  factual record to properly analyze the equal protection\nclaim.\n[1] It is important to note that Byrd did not challenge the\nContraband Policy on which Maricopa County relied in its\nopposition to Byrd’s claims. Rather, Byrd’s equal protection\nclaim was couched generally in terms of the treatment of male\ninmates, without reference to the policy. In any event, the\nContraband Policy does not establish the reasonableness of\nthe search. The Contraband Policy expressly provides that\n“[s]trip searches will be conducted by an officer of the same\nsex as the inmate . . . . ” Under the Contraband Policy a strip\nsearch is defined as a  “visual scan of the inmate’s skin after\nall clothing has been removed. ” Maricopa County seizes on\nthis definition to argue that the search performed on Byrd was\nnot a strip search because Byrd was wearing very thin boxer\nshorts. Rather, Maricopa County maintains that Byrd was sub-\njected to a frisk search.\n[2] The  Contraband Policy defines a frisk search as\n“[c]arefully examining an inmate by inspecting his clothing,\nand feeling the contours of his  clothed body . . .” (emphasis\nadded). The Contraband Policy provides that  “[t]he inmate’s\nshoes and socks may be removed . . . ” However, no mention\nis made of the removal of other clothing as part of a frisk\nsearch. In sum, the search was not properly conducted as a\nstrip search under the Contraband Policy because it was not\nconducted by staff of the same gender, and it was not limited\nto a visual inspection of Byrd’s body. The search was not\nproperly conducted as a frisk search under the Contraband\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 9 of 35\n376 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nPolicy because Byrd was not clothed as contemplated in the\npolicy. The particular search conducted in this case simply\ndoes not fall within the contours of the Contraband Policy.\nTherefore, no basis exists for concluding that the provisions\nof  the Contraband Policy defeat Byrd’s equal protection\nclaim.\n[3] The  district court dismissed Byrd’s equal protection\nclaim as one premised on the disparate treatment of prisoners\nand found, without acknowledging the gender element, that\nprisoners are not a suspect class. However, given the exis-\ntence of a facially discriminatory contraband policy, an equal\nprotection claim based on the disparate treatment of male and\nfemale prisoners was viable.  See Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d\n1108,  1111-12 (9th Cir. 2003) (acknowledging a male\ninmate’s equal protection claim based on prison grooming\nregulations that did not apply to female inmates);  Jeldness v.\nPearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1231 (9th Cir. 1994) (recognizing dis-\nparate treatment of male and female prisoners, but declining\nto reach the equal protection question);  Roubideaux v. N.D.\nDep’t of Corr. & Rehab. , 570 F.3d 966, 974 (8th Cir. 2009)\n(applying heightened review standard to statutes containing a\n“gender-based classification on their face ”); Pitts v. Thorn-\nburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (same for prison\npolicies). \n[4] Although the Contraband Policy was part of the record\nbefore the district court, Byrd’s complaint made no reference\nto it and his equal protection allegation largely repeated the\nfacts that formed the basis of his other claims. Even constru-\ning Byrd’s pro se complaint liberally, the allegations failed to\nstate an equal protection claim because they asserted only\nallegedly harmful treatment and mentioned nothing about dis-\nparate treatment, much less about the specific jail policy or\ngender classification in general. See Weilburg v. Shapiro, 488\nF.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. 2007) (“Pro se complaints are to be\nconstrued liberally . . .”); see also Pena v. Gardner, 976 F.2d\n469, 471 (9th Cir. 1992)  as amended (noting that “a liberal\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 10 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 377\ninterpretation of a pro se civil rights complaint may not sup-\nply essential elements of the claim that were not initially pled\n. . .”). For that reason, we do not take issue with the ultimate\nruling dismissing Byrd’s equal protection claim.\n[5] As for the substantive due process claim, Byrd failed\nto  allege or produce evidence that O’Connell or Arpaio\nexpressed an intent to punish Byrd or that the search was\nunrelated to a “legitimate governmental objective.” Bell, 441\nU.S. at 538-39 (explaining that the critical inquiry is “whether\nparticular restrictions and conditions accompanying pretrial\ndetention amount to punishment in the constitutional sense of\nthat word” and that, “if a particular condition or restriction of\npretrial detention is reasonably related to a legitimate govern-\nmental objective, it does not, without more, amount to punish-\nment”)  (footnote reference and internal quotation marks\nomitted). \n[6] In the alternative, punitive intent may be inferred.  See\nid. (“[I]f a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to\na legitimate goal—if it is arbitrary or purposeless—a court\npermissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental\naction is punishment that may not be constitutionally inflicted\nupon detainees qua detainees.” (citation and footnote omit-\nted)).  It is undisputed that the search in this case was\nprompted by several recent fights and suspicion of contra-\nband. Because a search premised on such security concerns is\nreasonably related to legitimate goals of detention officials,\nsee, e.g., Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 333 (9th Cir.\n1988), no basis exists to draw an inference of intent to punish\nByrd. In the absence of evidence of an intent to punish, or evi-\ndence that Maricopa’s actions were unrelated to a  “legitimate\ngovernmental objective,” the district court properly granted\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of O’Connell and Arpaio\non  Byrd’s Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process\nclaim. Bell, 441 U.S. at 539 n.20 (“[I]n the absence of a show-\ning of intent to punish, a court must look to see if a particular\nrestriction or condition, which may on its face appear to be\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 11 of 35\n378 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\npunishment, is instead but an incident of a legitimate nonpuni-\ntive governmental objective.”) (citations omitted).\nB.  Unreasonable Search and Seizure\n[7] The district court granted judgment as a matter of law\nin  favor of O’Connell on the issue of whether the cross-\ngender strip search violated Byrd’s right under the Fourth\nAmendment  to be free from unreasonable searches. We\nreview  this decision  de  novo,  keeping in mind that\n“[j]udgment as a matter of law is appropriate when the evi-\ndence presented at trial presents only one reasonable conclu-\nsion. . .” Mangum, 575 F.3d at 938  (citation and internal\nquotation marks omitted). In the context of this case, judg-\nment as a matter of law would be appropriate only if the evi-\ndence presented at trial led inevitably to the conclusion that\nthe  cross-gender strip search was reasonable. Whether a\nsearch is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment requires a\ncase-by-case “balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails\n. . .” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. The required factors for courts to\nconsider include: (1)  “the scope of the particular intrusion, ”\n(2) “the manner in which it is conducted, ” (3) “the justifica-\ntion for initiating it,” and (4) “the place in which it is conduct-\ned.” Id. (citations omitted).6\nWe approach this issue by reiterating our longstanding rec-\nognition that “[t]he desire to shield one’s unclothed figure\nfrom [the] view of strangers, and particularly strangers of the\nopposite sex, is impelled by elementary self-respect and per-\nsonal dignity.” York v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir.\n1963); see also Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333 (same); Grum-\n6Because Byrd did not challenge the constitutionality of the Contraband\nPolicy, and because the district court focused on the facts of the actual\nsearch conducted rather than on the provisions of the Contraband Policy,\nwe apply the Bell factors rather than those articulated in  Turner v. Safley,\n482 U.S. 78, 81 (1987), which addresses inmate challenges to regulations.\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 12 of 35\nBYRD v.

Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1985) (distin-\nguishing  cross-gender searches that  “are  done briefly and\nwhile the inmates are fully clothed, and thus do not involve\nintimate contact with the inmates’ bodies”) (emphasis added).\nIt is not surprising that a connection has been made between\ncross-gender  searches and the level of sexual impropriety\nbetween inmates and corrections personnel.  See, e.g., Nicho-\nlas D. Kristof, Op-Ed.,  Kids in Crisis (Behind Bars) , N.Y.\nTIMES, Jan. 28, 2010, at A33 (discussing a “stunning new Jus-\ntice  Department special report ”  finding that cross-gender\nassignments in prisons foster abuse of inmates by male and\nfemale officers); Connie Rice and Pat Nolan, Op-Ed, Policing\nPrisons, L.A. TIMES, Apr. 5, 2010, at A13 (citing to the June,\n2009, National Prison Rape Elimination Commission Report\n(Commission Report)).\nIn the preface to the Commission Report, The Honorable\nReggie B.

See Dissenting Opinion, p. 393 n.2. Our response is two-\nfold: (1) There is nothing nefarious or unusual about citing to secondary\nsources to illuminate our analysis,  see, e.g., United States v. Weber, 451\nF.3d 552, 561 n.13 (9th Cir. 2006) (listing cases relying on secondary\nsources to explain the court’s analysis); and (2) the Maricopa County offi-\ncials never exercised their “collective wisdom” in this case to decide that\ncross-gender strip searches were in order. In fact, the officials denied that\nany strip search was ever conducted. It would be strange indeed if the offi-\ncials in their “collective wisdom” ordered cross-gender strip searches in\nthis instance when the  “collective wisdom” memorialized in the written\npolicy expressly prohibits cross-gender strip searches. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 13 of 35\n380 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nAlthough the Commission acknowledged that cross-gender\nsupervision “can have benefits,” it nevertheless determined\nthat “[t]o prevent abuse, . . . the standard on this subject\nstrictly  prohibits non-medical staff from conducting cross-\ngender strip and visual body cavity searches—except in the\ncase of emergency—because of their extraordinarily intrusive\nnature.” Id. at 63.\nThe Commission’s findings are consistent with the stan-\ndards adopted by the American Correctional Association, the\naccrediting body for adult correctional facilities.  See Stan-\ndards For Adult Correctional Institutions (2003). \nSection 4-4194 addresses cross-gender strip searches, artic-\nulating the standard as follows:\nWritten policy, procedure and practice provide that,\nexcept in emergency situations, visual inspections of\ninmate body cavities are conducted by officers of the\nsame sex, in private . . .\nId. at 53.\n[8] Applying the Bell factors in the context of our prece-\ndent recognizing the privacy interest of inmates in their per-\nsonal  dignity, giving credence to the compelling findings\nmade by the Commission, and acknowledging the applicable\naccrediting standards, we conclude that the cross-gender strip\nsearch  of Byrd was unreasonable as a matter of law.\nO’Connell touched Byrd’s inner and outer thighs, buttocks,\nand genital area with her latex-gloved hand through very thin\nboxer shorts. She moved his penis and scrotum in the process\nof conducting the search. The scope of this intrusion totally\nthwarted any desire on Byrd’s part to  “shield [his] unclothed\nfigure from [the] view of strangers . . . of the opposite sex .\n. .” York, 324 F.2d at 455. The scope of the intrusion in this\ncase far exceeds searches we have previously sanctioned and\nweighs in favor of a finding of unreasonableness. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 14 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 381\nIn Grummett, 779 F.2d at 493, 495, we upheld a system of\nassigning female officers within a correctional facility such\nthat they occasionally viewed male inmates in various states\nof undress and regularly conducted routine pat-down searches\nof  inmates that did not involve intimate contact with the\ninmate’s  body. We expressly noted that  “female  officers\n[were]  not  assigned positions in which they  conduct  or\nobserve strip or body cavity searches .” Id. at 495 (emphases\nadded). Although the dissent characterizes the search of Byrd\nas a pat-down search,  see Dissenting Opinion, p. 399, we\noffered a different description of a pat-down search in  Grum-\nmett. There, we defined pat-down searches as searches  “done\nbriefly and while the inmates are fully clothed, and thus do\nnot involve intimate contact with the inmates’ bodies.” Grum-\nmett, 779 F.2d at 496. In contrast, Byrd was barely clothed at\nall, and it is undisputed that the female officer twice touched\nByrd’s penis and scrotum, and searched inside his anus. \nIn Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334, we reiterated that  “infre-\nquent and casual observation, or observation at [a] distance,\n. . . are not so degrading as to warrant court interference” (cit-\ning Grummett, 779 F.2d at 494-95) (parallel citations omit-\nted).  Our holding in  Michenfelder  offers no support for a\ncross-gender  strip search. If the panel in  Michenfelder\nintended to approve cross-gender strip searches, it would have\ndistinguished Grummett, rather than citing the case in support\nof the panel’s ruling.\nNone of the other cases cited by our colleagues,  see Dis-\nsenting Opinion, p. 395-96, purports to approve cross-gender\nstrip searches in the absence of an emergency. Indeed, neither\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559-60;  Rickman v. Avaniti, 854 F.2d 327,\n328 (9th Cir. 1988); nor  Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694,\n700 (9th Cir. 1997), involved cross-gender strip searches, the\nissue we address in this case.\n[9] The manner in which the search was conducted weighs\nin favor of a determination of unreasonableness. Byrd was\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 15 of 35\n382 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nsearched by a female cadet who was dressed in jeans and a\nwhite t-shirt. Other than the name printed on the back of the\nt-shirt, the officer who conducted Byrd’s search was unidenti-\nfied.  Ten to fifteen non-participating officers watched the\nstrip search, and at least one person videotaped the search.\nAlthough the dissent relies on the fact that the search was\nconducted “professionally,” see Dissenting Opinion, p. 396,\nwe have consistently recognized the “ ‘frightening and humil-\niating’ invasion” occasioned by a strip search,  “even when\nconducted ‘with all due courtesy.’  ” Way, 445 F.3d at 1160,\nquoting Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984)\n(per curiam). Furthermore, the dissent’s reliance on the jury’s\nfinding that the manner of O’Connell’s search was appropri-\nate because O’Connell “did not intentionally squeeze or knead\nByrd’s penis or scrotum or improperly touch his anus through\nhis boxer shorts,” Dissenting Opinion, p. 397, ignores the dis-\ntrict court’s ruling that the cross-gender aspect of the search\nwas constitutional as a matter of law. Thus, the jury was not\ndeciding whether the manner of the search was appropriate\ndespite being performed by a member of the opposite sex .\n[10] The justification for conducting the search weighs in\nfavor of a determination of reasonableness. It is undisputed\nthat the search was initiated due to several recent fights and\nsuspicion  of contraband.  These  circumstances constituted\nvalid reasons to search the inmates, even though no immedi-\nate emergency existed. See Thompson, 111 F.3d at 700 (not-\ning  that the purpose of the search was to  “detect  illicit\ndrugs”); see also Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332-33 (recogniz-\ning that a search for contraband constitutes adequate justifica-\ntion).  Nevertheless, although valid reasons to search the\ninmates existed generally, there was no justification given for\nconducting a cross-gender strip search. The dissent glosses\nover this distinction when emphasizing the jury’s finding that\nthere were valid reasons to search the inmates. See Dissenting\nOpinion, p. 393-94. The jury had been specifically instructed\nnot to consider the cross-gender element of the search, and\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 16 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 383\ntherefore the jury’s finding that a search was justified does not\namount to a finding that a search  by a woman was justified.\n[11] The final Bell factor, the place of the search, similarly\nweighs in favor of a finding of reasonableness. Byrd was\nsearched in the day room, a common area. Other inmates were\npresent, making it less likely that improper conduct would\noccur. See Thompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (upholding visual strip\nsearch of inmate that took place on the tier just outside the\ninmate’s cell within view of other prisoners).\n[12] Although  the last two factors weigh in favor of a\ndetermination of reasonableness, the effect of the first two\nfactors is so extreme that a conclusion of unreasonableness is\ncompelled. Courts throughout the country have universally\nfrowned upon cross-gender strip searches in the absence of an\nemergency or exigent circumstances.8\n8The dissenting opinion minimizes the intrusiveness of the search by\ndescribing it as a “pat-down of a partially-clothed male inmate.” Dissent-\ning Opinion, p. 395. However, the facts of this case clearly reflect that\nmore than a “pat down” occurred. We have defined a  “pat-down search”\nas one involving no intimate contact with the inmate’s body.  Grummett,\n779 F.2d at 495-96. In contrast, Byrd was subjected to a search that\ninvolved twice moving his penis and scrotum aside and separating the\ncheeks of his buttocks to search inside his anus. Neither was Byrd partially\nclothed, legally speaking. Rather, he was wearing only pink, nearly see-\nthrough underwear. In most jurisdictions within this circuit, one could not\nappear in public dressed, (or more precisely undressed) in that manner.\nSee, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-3501(4) (defining “nudity” as “the showing\nof the human male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks with less than\na full opaque covering . . .”); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 712-1210 (defining “nude”\nas unclothed or in attire, including but not limited to sheer or see-through\nattire, so as to expose to view any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of\nthe buttocks, genitals . . .”). Indeed, the dissent’s characterization is incon-\nsistent with Grummett, 779 F.2d at 496, in which we approved cross-\ngender searches “done . . . while the inmates are  fully clothed, and thus\ndo not involve intimate contact with the inmates’ bodies .” (emphasis\nadded). \nIf the search conducted were in fact a pat-down search of a partially\nclothed inmate, we would probably agree that the search was reasonable.\nHowever, because Byrd was subjected to a cross-gender strip search while\nnearly nude, we conclude that the search was patently unreasonable. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 17 of 35\n384 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nIn Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 442 (1st Cir. 1991)\n(per curiam), the First Circuit resolved a civil rights complaint\nalleging that prison officials violated an inmate’s right under\nthe Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable searches.\nThe inmate’s claim was predicated on the fact that  “female\ncorrectional officers supervised and/or observed him during a\nvisual body cavity search.” Id. (footnote reference omitted). It\nwas undisputed that the search occurred during  “an emer-\ngency situation.” Id. at 448. Plaintiff himself described the\nprison  conditions as a  “riot.”  Id.  at 444. Understandably,\nprison officials commenced visual body cavity searches of\ninmates “to ensure that the inmates were not carrying weap-\nons, matches, combustibles or other contraband . . . ” Id. at\n446 n.7. As in this case, the Plaintiff did not challenge the rea-\nsonableness of the search  per se or the manner in which the\nsearch was conducted. See id. at 446. Rather, similar to Byrd,\nthe Plaintiff in  Cookish asserted a violation of his constitu-\ntional  rights primarily because a female lieutenant was\ninvolved,  supervising the visual body cavity search from\napproximately five feet away.  See id. at 445. \nThe First Circuit reiterated its recognition  “that a severe if\nnot gross interference with a person’s privacy occurs when\nguards conduct a visual inspection of body cavities. ” Id. at\n446 (citation, alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe court also explained that:\n  Certainly by the time of this search in 1987, the\ntrend, if not the clearly established law, was that an\ninmate’s constitutional right to privacy is violated\nwhen guards of the opposite sex regularly observe\nhim/her  engaged in personal activities, such as\nundressing, showering and using the toilet.\nId.

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 385\n(1) inadvertent, occasional, casual, and/or restricted\nobservations of an inmate’s naked body by a guard\nof  the opposite sex did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment  and (2) if the observation was other\nthan  inadvertent, occasional, casual, and/or\nrestricted, such observation would (in all likelihood)\nviolate the Fourth Amendment,  except in an emer-\ngency condition.\nId. at 447 (emphasis in the original). \nIn sum, almost twenty years ago, the First Circuit ruled, in\nno uncertain terms, that visual observation of a nude male by\na female corrections officer  “would (in all likelihood),” vio-\nlate that inmate’s constitutional right to be free from unrea-\nsonable searches. Id. It is notable that, in determining that the\nofficers  involved were entitled to qualified immunity, the\nFirst Circuit focused on the emergency conditions surround-\ning the search. See id. at 448 (“The caselaw supports the con-\nclusion that, in an emergency situation, a visual body cavity\nsearch conducted within the view of a guard of the opposite\nsex, even if other than an inadvertent and/or restricted view,\nwould  not violate an inmate’s Fourth Amendment right. ”)\n(citation omitted) (emphasis added). \nIn 1981, the Fourth Circuit similarly recognized the inap-\npropriateness  of cross-gender strip searches.  See  Lee v.\nDowns, 641 F.2d 1117, 1120 (4th Cir. 1981) ( “[M]ales sub-\nject to frisk searches by female guards during which the geni-\ntals are touched and felt through clothing  [are] entitled to\ninjunctive relief.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). This\ndescription by the Fourth Circuit fits the facts of this case per-\nfectly.  The professionalism with which the search is con-\nducted in no way changes the consistent depiction of a cross-\ngender strip search in the absence of an emergency as viola-\ntive of Fourth Amendment principles.\nIn 1999, the Fifth Circuit decided that an inmate stated a\nvalid Fourth Amendment claim when the inmate filed a civil\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 19 of 35\n386 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nrights action alleging “multiple strip and body cavity searches\nperformed by a female officer . . . ” Moore v. Carwell, 168\nF.3d 234, 235 (5th Cir. 1999). In reaching its conclusion, the\nFifth Circuit distinguished a prior case holding “that the mere\npresence of female officers during a strip search of prisoners\nduring emergency circumstances did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment.” Id. at 236 (citation omitted) (emphases in the\noriginal). As with the other circuits, the Fifth Circuit consid-\nered the lack of an emergency a crucial factor in support of\nthe existence of a constitutional violation stemming from a\ncross-gender strip search. The Fifth Circuit also considered\nthe fact that male officers were present to conduct the search.\nSee id. at 237.\nIn 1994, the Seventh Circuit decided Canedy v. Boardman,\n16 F.3d 183 (7th Cir. 1994). Canedy sued the corrections\nfacility where he was housed, asserting that his privacy rights\nwere violated when two female guards  “strip searched him”\n“during a shakedown of his housing unit.” Id. at 184. Canedy\nalso alleged that the violation could have readily been pre-\nvented due to the fact that ten male officers were nearby at the\ntime. See id.\nThe district court dismissed Canedy’s Complaint for failure\nto state a claim. The district court determined that any privacy\nrights possessed by Canedy were outweighed by the prison’s\ninterest  in providing equal employment opportunities for\nfemale officers. The district court specifically ruled:\nIf female guards are to be given equal opportunity\nfor employment and promotion, it is necessary to\nallow them to observe male prisoners and conduct\nsearches  just as male officers would. To exclude\nfemales from observing or participating in all aspects\nof guard work could prevent them from gaining the\nexperience they need to advance to higher positions,\nand  bar them from assuming those positions that\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 20 of 35\nBYRD v.

(citation omitted). \nAs a preliminary matter, the Seventh Circuit acknowledged\nthe general consensus that a strip search is “one of the clearest\nforms of degradation in Western Society . . .” Id. at 185 (cita-\ntion and alteration omitted). The Seventh Circuit also recog-\nnized  that the indignity is multiplied when one’s body is\nexposed to a member of the opposite gender.  See id. (refer-\nencing York, 324 F.2d at 455).\nAgainst that background, the Seventh Circuit considered\nthe  invasion of the inmate’s privacy and the employment\nrights of the female corrections officers. Rather than agreeing\nthat the employment rights of the female officers trumped the\nprivacy rights of the inmates, the Seventh Circuit concluded\nthat the privacy interests of the inmate must be recognized\nand accommodated. See id. at 187. One accommodation cited\nwith approval by the Seventh Circuit was excluding the geni-\ntal area when conducting cross-gender searches.  See id.\nThe Seventh Circuit characterized Canedy’s complaint as\none  alleging that he was subjected to cross-gender strip\nsearches without any effort to accommodate his privacy inter-\nests vis á vis the prison’s parallel interest in affording equal\nemployment opportunities. See id. at 188. In reversing the dis-\nmissal  of Canedy’s Complaint, the Seventh Circuit pro-\nclaimed that “[a]lmost every federal court that has addressed\nthis issue has come to the conclusion that the Constitution\ndemands such an accommodation [in the absence of an emer-\ngency]”). Id. at 187.\nIn 1995, the Tenth Circuit addressed the issue of cross-\ngender strip searches in Hayes v. Marriott, 70 F.3d 1144 (10th\nCir. 1995).

See id. at 1145.\nAn administrative officer from the Colorado Department of\nCorrections (DOC) proffered the following justification for\nthe presence of female staff:\n  There is no particular DOC policy relating to use\nof female staff during strip searches. As a matter of\ncourtesy to the inmate population, male staff mem-\nbers are used whenever possible. There is no indica-\ntion  any female staff members conducted a strip\nsearch during the dates in question. Although every\neffort was made to reduce the number of female staff\nduring the search, females are an essential part of our\nstaffing. All posts still had to be covered and females\ndid view parts of the search while conducting their\nnormal  duties or observation duties so male staff\ncould conduct the searches. There was no justifiable\nreason  to totally exclude female staff from this\nrequired function. Additionally, the total absence of\nfemale  staff would have alerted inmates to an\nimpending search.\nId. at 1147 (citation omitted). \nDespite the affidavit from a prison official attesting that no\nfemales actively participated in the strip search and despite\nthe  expressed staffing considerations in the affidavit, the\nTenth  Circuit reversed the grant of summary judgment in\nfavor of the prison officials.  See id. at 1147-48. In doing so,\nthe Tenth Circuit explicitly recognized that an inmate’s pri-\nvacy rights may be violated by a single cross-gender strip\nsearch. See id. at 1147.\n[13] This litany of cases over the last thirty years has a\nrecurring theme: cross-gender strip searches in the absence of\nan  emergency violate an inmate’s right under the Fourth\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 22 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 389\nAmendment to be free from unreasonable searches. Because\nthe cross-gender nature of the search is a critical factor in the\nstrip searches discussed in these cases, we cannot agree with\nour dissenting colleagues that the gender of the officer con-\nducting the search is irrelevant.  See Dissenting Opinion, p.\n395. Interestingly, Maricopa County never challenged the pre-\ncept  that cross-gender strip searches are constitutionally\ninfirm in the absence of an emergency. Rather, it painstak-\ningly attempted to establish that the cross-gender search Byrd\nunderwent was not a strip search. Indeed, Maricopa County’s\npolicy prohibits cross-gender strip searches. The admission\nimplicit in Maricopa County’s determined effort to avoid hav-\ning the search characterized as a strip search, coupled with the\nnearly universal opprobrium expressed in the cases addressing\ncross-gender  strip searches, reflects the extreme degree of\nunreasonableness presented by the facts of this case. 9\n[14] In this case, the indignity of the non-emergency strip\nsearch conducted by an unidentified female cadet was com-\npounded by the fact that there were onlookers, at least one of\nwhom videotaped the humiliating event. For these reasons, we\nconclude that the cross-gender strip search, as conducted in\nthis case, was unreasonable.10\n9We omit Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc),\nfrom this discussion because a majority of the  en banc panel declined to\naddress the Fourth Amendment issue in that case. \n10Byrd also challenged the district court’s admission of the Video Year-\nbook and the district court’s formulation of an adverse inference instruc-\ntion.  However, during trial, Byrd laid the foundation for an adverse\ninference instruction when he questioned Arpaio about the video footage\nrecorded on the day of Byrd’s search. The district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by admitting the videotape because Byrd opened the door to\nconsideration of this evidence when he questioned Arpaio about the video\nfootage. See United States v. Osazuwa , 564 F.3d 1169, 1173 (9th Cir.\n2009) (reviewing for abuse of discretion the district court’s ruling that a\nparty opened the door for introduction of evidence).

CONCLUSION\nWe readily acknowledge the deference due prison officials\nengaged  in the admittedly difficult task of administering\ninmate populations. However, that deference does not extend\nto sanctioning a clear violation of an inmate’s constitutional\nrights. See Giles, 746 F.2d at 617; see also Hayes, 70 F.3d at\n1146 (“One of the clearest forms of degradation in Western\nSociety is to strip a person of his clothes. The right to be free\nfrom strip searches and degrading body inspections is thus\nbasic to the concept of privacy. ”) (citations, alteration and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n[15] Accordingly,  we hold that the cross-gender strip\nsearch performed on Byrd was unreasonable as a matter of\nlaw under the facts of this case and violated Byrd’s rights\nunder the Fourth Amendment to be free from unreasonable\nsearches. We REVERSE the district court’s entry of judg-\nment as a matter of law in favor of O’Connell and Maricopa\nCounty on this claim. We  REMAND this case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nN.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part, joined by KOZINSKI, Chief Judge, and GOULD,\nTALLMAN, and BEA, Circuit Judges:\nI agree with the majority’s conclusion regarding Byrd’s\nclaims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. How-\ngested language would have impermissibly directed the jury to reach a\nconclusion about a matter of disputed fact.  See Miller v. Rykoff-Sexton,\nInc., 845 F.2d 209, 212 (9th Cir. 1988) (explaining that a jury instruction\nis adequate “even if it does not use the exact words proposed by a party\n. . .”); see also Roberts v. Spalding , 783 F.2d 867, 873 (9th Cir. 1986)\n(approving the district court’s rejection of an instruction that directed the\njury to reach a particular conclusion regarding a disputed matter of fact).\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 24 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 391\never, (1) the deference we owe prison administrators, (2) the\njury’s undisputed factual findings, and (3) the relevant case\nlaw compel me to conclude that O’Connell’s actions were\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. I therefore respect-\nfully dissent from the contradictory analysis in the majority\nopinion, which held that a female officer’s pat-down search\nof a male detainee—where there were no exigent circum-\nstances showing the unavailability of male officers to do the\nsearch—was a violation of the detainee’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. \nIn determining the reasonableness of a search under the\nFourth Amendment, we must balance “the need for the partic-\nular search against the invasion of personal rights that the\nsearch entails.” Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). In\nBell v. Wolfish, the Supreme Court directed us to consider the\nfollowing four factors when evaluating the reasonableness of\na search of an incarcerated person: (1)  “the scope of the par-\nticular intrusion,” (2) “the manner in which it is conducted, ”\n(3) “the justification for initiating it, ” and (4)  “the place in\nwhich it is conducted.” Id.1 The majority correctly identifies\n1Because the majority holds that the factors articulated in Turner v. Saf-\nley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-91 (1987), are inapplicable to Byrd’s challenge and\ninstead focuses exclusively on the Bell  factors, Maj. Op. 378 n.6, I too\nonly address the Bell factors. It ultimately makes no difference whether we\nconsider the factors articulated in  Turner, however, as application of the\nTurner factors also compels a finding that O’Connell’s search of Byrd was\nreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See Bull v. City and County of\nSan Francisco, 595 F.3d 964, 975-76 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) ( “Because\nthe Turner factors require us to give more deference to detention officials’\ndeterminations than does the balancing test in Bell, it is not surprising that\nour consideration of the Turner factors leads to the same conclusion.”). In\nTurner, the Supreme Court held that  “when a prison regulation impinges\non inmates’ constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89. In making this\ndetermination, the Supreme Court directed us to consider four factors.  Id.\nat 89-91. First, we consider whether there is a  “valid, rational connection\nbetween the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it.” Id. at 89 (internal quotation marks and citation omit-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 25 of 35\n392 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthis  test and properly finds that factors (3) and (4)—\njustification and place, respectively—weigh in favor of a find-\ning of “reasonableness” under the Fourth Amendment. Never-\ntheless, it erroneously concludes that factors (1) and (2)—\nscope  and manner, respectively—vindicate Byrd’s Fourth\nAmendment claim. \nBefore addressing the Bell factors, however, it is necessary\nto highlight the limited nature of our review. The Supreme\nCourt has instructed that  “[p]rison administrators . . . should\nbe accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and exe-\ncution of policies and practices that in their judgment are\nneeded to preserve internal order and discipline and to main-\ntain  institutional security. ”  Id.  at 547. Therefore,  “in  the\nabsence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate that\nthe officials have exaggerated their response to [security and\noperation considerations], courts should ordinarily defer to\ntheir expert judgment in such matters.” Id. at 540 n.23 (inter-\nted). As discussed more fully infra, it is not disputed that the prison offi-\ncials had a legitimate need to initiate the searches in order to prevent the\nproliferation of contraband within the prison. Second, we are to consider\n“whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain\nopen to prison inmates.” Id. at 90. This factor does not apply to Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment claim; it is somewhat nonsensical to examine whether\nalternative means exist for Byrd to exercise his right to be free from unrea-\nsonable searches. See Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 331 n.1 (9th\nCir. 1988) (“Not all four factors will be relevant to each case. . . . [T]he\nsecond Turner factor . . . is much more meaningful in the first amendment\ncontext than the fourth or eighth . . . . ”). Third, we consider “the impact\naccommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards\nand other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources generally. ”\nTurner, 482 U.S. at 90. Again as discussed more fully  infra, the County\noffered undisputed evidence that it did not have sufficient numbers of\nmale detention officers to conduct searches of male inmates without the\nassistance of female officers. Finally, we must examine  “the absence of\nready alternatives [as] evidence of the reasonableness of a prison regula-\ntion.” Id. Because we must defer to the County’s undisputed evidence\nregarding its staffing needs, we cannot conclude that there were other rea-\nsonable alternatives to the search. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 26 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 393\nnal quotation marks and citation omitted). It is axiomatic that\nprison officials know better than a panel of judges how to run\na prison. Deference to prison officials, therefore, necessarily\npermeates our review of their searches. 2 \nWe are also constrained in our review by the jury’s undis-\nputed factual findings that: (1) O’Connell did not  “intention-\nally  squeez[e] or knead[  ]  [Byrd’s] penis or scrotum or\nimproperly touch[ ] his anus through his underwear, ” and (2)\nO’Connell’s  search was  “done  for [an] identified security\nneed.” Tempting though it may be to paint the facts differ-\nently on appeal, the jury made these findings and Byrd has not\nchallenged them. With these considerations in mind, I now\nturn to the Bell factors and again emphasize that the majority\nagrees that two of the factors—the justification for the search\nand place in which it was conducted—weigh in favor of find-\ning O’Connell’s search reasonable. Maj. Op. 382-83. \nIt is appropriate to begin the analysis by looking at the jus-\ntification for initiating the search, because, in the absence of\na  proper justification, even the most unintrusive search is\nunreasonable. The prison officials initiated their searches in\nresponse to evidence that contraband was circulating in the\njail in the wake of multiple fights that had broken out in\nByrd’s housing unit. This is not disputed. Maintaining the\ninternal security of the prison was at stake, and the need to\neliminate the possibility of dangerous contraband somewhere\non a prisoner’s person in such a volatile atmosphere certainly\njustifies initiating the type of search at issue here.  See Mich-\n2The majority has apparently disregarded this principle, instead relying\non a Commission Report and two op-eds to form its own opinions about\nthe logistical wisdom of the searches at issue here. Maj. Op. 378-79. Aside\nfrom the fact that the Commission Report and op-eds are not part of the\nrecord before us, there is certainly nothing to suggest that they represent\nthe collective wisdom of administrators who understand the conditions at\nDurango Jail. Those prison administrators deserve greater deference, espe-\ncially since the evaluation of the reasonableness of a search is heavily\ndependent on the context of each case. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 27 of 35\n394 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333 (holding that, among other things,\n“testimony and physical evidence . . . [of] contraband ” justi-\nfied the initiation of strip searches). Moreover, it is undis-\nputed that inmates frequently attempt to conceal contraband\nin  their body cavities, thus furthering the need for strip\nsearches as a means of preventing the proliferation of contra-\nband and homemade weapons within the prison.  See, e.g.,\nBell, 441 U.S. at 559 ( “A detention facility is a unique place\nfraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money,\ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an\noccurrence. And inmate attempts to secrete these items into\nthe facility by concealing them in body cavities are docu-\nmented in this record . . . and in other cases. ”). On top of all\nthis, the jury found that the search was done for an identified\nsecurity need, which Byrd does not challenge on appeal. In\nlight of such considerations, the prison’s need to confiscate all\ncontraband, and therefore initiate these searches, was both\npressing and significant.  Id. at 546-47 ( “Central to all other\ncorrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal\nsecurity within the corrections facilities themselves. ”) (inter-\nnal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).\nI next note my agreement with the majority that the last\nBell factor—the place in which the search is conducted—also\nweighs in favor of finding the search reasonable. See Michen-\nfelder, 860 F.2d at 333 ( “[W]e will not question [prison offi-\ncials’] judgment that conditions in [a prison unit] reasonably\nrequire searches outside the prisoners’ cells in order to protect\nthe safety of the officers conducting them.”); see also Thomp-\nson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 697, 701 (9th Cir. 1997) (approv-\ning an intrusive strip search conducted in view of jeering\ninmates).\nMy agreement with the majority ends there, however, as a\nreview of the remaining two Bell factors—the scope and man-\nner  of the search—also establishes the reasonableness of\nO’Connell’s search of Byrd. Relying on a string of cases that\nupheld both female officers’ visual observation of unclothed\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 28 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 395\nmales and their performing pat-down searches on males, the\nmajority  concludes that, under the first  Bell  factor,  “[t]he\nscope of the intrusion in this case far exceeds searches we\nhave previously sanctioned . . . .” Maj. Op. 380. The majority\nis wrong.\nDealing first with the scope of O’Connell’s search, such\nsearch was limited to a pat-down of a partially clothed inmate\nin an attempt to locate contraband. The search was both rea-\nsonable and necessary to ensure prisoners at the Durango Jail\nwere not concealing weapons or other contraband.  Cf. Bull,\n595  F.3d at 969 ( “[A]rrestees’  use of body cavities as a\nmethod  of smuggling drugs, weapons, and items used to\nescape custody is an immediate and troubling problem for San\nFrancisco jail administrators.”). In evaluating the scope of a\nsearch, the searching officer’s gender is irrelevant. \nThe Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have previously\nvalidated even strip searches and body cavity searches.  See,\ne.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at 558-60 (validating visual inspections of\nbody cavities as part of strip searches in the prison setting);\nThompson, 111 F.3d 694, 700 (9th Cir. 1997) (holding body\ncavity searches did not violate clearly established rights under\nqualified immunity analysis); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333\n(approving visual strip searches in the prison setting);  Rick-\nman v. Avaniti, 854 F.2d 327, 328 (9th Cir. 1988) (approving\nstrip searches in prisons) . I recognize, of course, that these\ncases involved only visual searches and no touching (in con-\ntrast to O’Connell’s search). However, it is clear that pat-\ndown searches can be constitutional even outside of a prison\nsetting.  See  Terry v. Ohio ,  392 U.S. 1, 17 n.13 (1968)\n(describing a frisk as  “feel[ing] with sensitive fingers every\nportion of the prisoner’s body . . . the prisoner’s arms and\narmpits, waistline and back, the groin and area about the testi-\ncles, and the entire surface of the legs down to the feet” (inter-\nnal quotation mark omitted)). Pat-down searches are also less\nintrusive than strip searches.  Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d\n614,  618 (9th Cir. 1984),  overruled  on other grounds by\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 29 of 35\n396 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nHodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(en banc). The officers here searched the prisoners profession-\nally,3 following a procedure that minimized physical contact\nto  the extent possible. O’Connell searched Byrd over his\nboxer shorts, and he doesn’t claim she ever looked underneath\nthem. The entire search took no more than a minute. Thus its\nscope did not “far exceed[ ]” what we have previously sanc-\ntioned. Contra Maj. Op. 380.\nThe final Bell factor—the manner of O’Connell’s search—\ngives me greater pause. Not lightly do I find reasonable a\nfemale officer’s probing search of a male detainee wearing\nonly thin boxer shorts. Nevertheless, I believe the precedent\nand the facts compel this result, unsavory to our sensibilities\nthough that result may be. \nI first note “our prior case law[, which] suggests that pris-\noners’ legitimate expectations of bodily privacy from persons\nof the opposite sex are extremely limited.” Jordan v. Gardner,\n986 F.2d 1521, 1524 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc). Against that\nbackdrop, we now review our other precedent: (1) female\nofficers may pat down the groin area of fully clothed male\ninmates, Grummett, 779 F.2d at 496; and (2) female officers\nmay observe unclothed male inmates in their cells and in the\nshowers, Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334. Admittedly, neither\nof  these precedents covers the current situation—a female\nofficer’s pat-down of a partially-clothed male inmate. Under\nthe circumstances presented here, however, there is no mean-\ningful difference between Byrd’s search and what we have\npreviously  upheld. O’Connell never saw Byrd’s exposed\ngroin area or his anus, in contrast to the female officers in\nMichenfelder,  and the search was done in a professional,\n3The majority’s assertion that it makes no difference that a search was\ndone in a professional manner is unconvincing. Maj. Op. 381-82, 385. The\ncourt in Grummett specifically noted (three times) that female guards’\nsearches were done in  “in a professional manner.” Grummett v. Rushen,\n779 F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th Cir. 1985). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 30 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 397\nswift, and appropriate manner that involved no touching of\nthe flesh under Byrd’s boxer shorts.  See Grummett, 779 F.2d\nat 496 (validating searches where, among other things, the\nsearches are “done briefly . . . [and] are performed by the\nfemale guards in a professional manner”). Moreover, the jury\nfound that O’Connell did not intentionally squeeze or knead\nByrd’s penis or scrotum or improperly touch his anus through\nthe boxer shorts and that O’Connell’s search was done for an\nidentified security need. Again, Byrd has not challenged these\nfindings. \nIn addition, the County has offered undisputed evidence\nthat  the County did not have sufficient numbers of male\ndetention officers to conduct searches of male inmates with-\nout the assistance of female officers. 4 Thus, even if it may\nseem odd to utilize a female officer to conduct a pat-down of\n4The majority argues that Byrd disputed the need to utilize female offi-\ncers because he testified that male detention officers were present, but did\nnot conduct the search. Maj. Op. 371 & n.2. The majority claims that, as\nin Moore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 237 (5th Cir. 1999), we should credit\nByrd’s testimony that some male officers were not participating in the\nsearch as evidence that female officers were not needed to perform the\nsearch. However, in  Moore, the court was required to assume Moore’s\nallegations were true when reviewing a motion to dismiss.  Id. at 236. We\nare not so constrained in our review; instead, we must consider all the evi-\ndence produced at trial. While Byrd testified that not all male officers\npresent conducted the searches, he did not (and could not) testify as to the\nstaffing necessary to safely conduct a search of approximately 90 prison-\ners and their living quarters. Moreover, the majority’s argument that\nfemale officers were not necessary for the search was contradicted by tes-\ntimony from both O’Connell and Captain Peterson. O’Connell testified\nthat having additional officers present was necessary because  “[t]here is\nalways a threat” of violence in such situations.  Captain Peterson testified\nthat prison officials “don’t have the luxury” of having enough male deten-\ntion officers to search the jail facility. Therefore, they must rely on female\nofficers. He also testified that he could not pull in additional male officers\nfrom other facilities to have enough male staff to conduct such searches.\nUnder Bell, we are required to defer to the expert judgment of prison offi-\ncials as to how to maintain prison safety and order—including who should\nconduct searches and how many officers are needed. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 31 of 35\n398 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\na male inmate when other male officers are present, the reali-\nties of the prison’s staffing needs justify such searches.  See\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334 (“[R]equiring [female employ-\nees] to be replaced by males for the duration of strip searches,\nwould displace officers throughout the prison. ”); Grummett,\n779 F.2d at 496 (“To restrict the female guards from positions\nwhich  involve occasional viewing of the inmates would\nnecessitate a tremendous rearrangement of work schedules,\nand possibly produce a risk to both internal security needs and\nequal  employment opportunities for the female guards. ”).\nThis  is particularly true since the 10,000 detainees in the\nMaricopa County system are searched at least daily, and often\nseveral times a day. To disallow all female officers from con-\nducting  these searches anytime a male officer is present\nwould handicap the female officers as security personnel and\nperpetuate sexist notions that a female is only useful when a\nmale is not available. Instead of converting Durango Jail into\na target for equal employment litigation, I defer to the prison\nofficials’ reasoned and sensible judgment on these matters. \nIn order to provide a basis for its decision, the majority\nterms this search a strip search, rather than a pat-down search.\nThis is error. True, this search differed somewhat from the\nprison’s definition of a  “frisk (body) search,” because more\nthan Byrd’s socks and shoes were removed. However, it is\nundisputed  that it involved only an inspection of Byrd’s\n(already removed) clothing and  “feeling the contours of his\nclothed body.” O’Connell testified that at no point did she pat\ndown or touch any unclothed areas. Thus, the search is more\naccurately described as a  “pat-down,” since a  “strip search”\ninvolves a “visual scan of the inmate’s body after all clothing\nhas been removed.” Indeed, the strip searches in the cases\nrelied on by the majority were visual inspections of  naked\ninmates. See Moore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 236 (5th Cir.\n1999) (male inmate  “being viewed naked by a female [offi-\ncer]”); Canedy v. Boardman, 16 F.3d 183, 185, 186 n.2 (7th\nCir.  1994) (female guards’ visual observations of male\ninmate’s  “naked  body”  prohibited, but pat-down searches\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 32 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 399\nconstitutional);  Hayes  v. Marriott ,  70 F.3d 1144, 1145-47\n(10th Cir. 1995) (Visual body cavity search of male inmate in\npresence of non-essential female staff. The court noted  “the\nFourth Amendment does not require the complete exclusion\nof members of the opposite sex from areas in which searches\nare conducted”); Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 444-45\n(1st Cir. 1991) (male inmate  “had to remove every item of\nclothing”  in view of supervising female officer);   Lee v.\nDowns, 641 F.2d 1117, 1120 (4th Cir. 1981) (female inmate\nhad “underclothing . . . forcefully removed” with male guards\npresent); see also Sec. and Law Enforcement Employees, Dist.\nCouncil 82 v. Carey, 737 F.2d 187, 192 nn.3-4 (2d Cir. 1984)\n(distinguishing between “strip frisks” (requiring the person\nbeing searched to reveal body cavities), visual examinations\nof naked persons, and pat frisks);  Cookish, 945 F.2d at 444\nn.5 (“A ‘strip search,’ . . . refers to an inspection of a naked\nindividual”). None of these “strip search” cases involved par-\ntially clothed inmates. \nThe majority’s description of this search as a strip search\nallows it to discount this court’s precedent relevant to the case\nat hand. Grummett is on point. This court held that  “routine\npat-down searches, which include the groin area, and which\nare otherwise justified by security needs, do not violate the\n[F]ourteenth [A]mendment because a correctional officer of\nthe opposite gender conducts such a search.” 779 F.2d at 495;\nsee id. at 496 (finding no Fourth Amendment violation). The\nmajority repeatedly distinguishes  Grummett because it feels\nthat, unlike Grummett, this case involved  “intimate contact\nwith the inmate’s body. ” Maj. Op. 383 n.8. This, however,\nignores the nature and purpose of a pat-down search. A pat-\ndown is done to detect contraband that may be taped to the\ncontours of an inmate’s body, including the genital area. One\nhas  to apply enough pressure to contact the areas being\nsearched, and to “be able to feel something that’s on the [area\nsearched].” \nGiven that the purpose of the search is to feel for contra-\nband, the majority’s attempt to distinguish  Grummett solely\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 33 of 35\n400 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\non the thickness or extent of the clothing is unconvincing. In\norder to be effective, the searcher must be able to feel the\ninside thigh and perineum. On an inmate in street clothes, this\nmay require more pressure, but results in the same contact in\nthe same area. In both cases, no skin to skin contact was\nmade;  both searches were only over clothed areas. Both\nsearches were of the same groin area. Both searches were\nbrief and conducted for legitimate security purposes. 779 F.2d\nat 496. Given the area, nature, and purpose of the search, it\nwould be unreasonable to presume that the female guards in\nGrummett did not face the same challenges O’Connell did. \nMoreover, even if this were a strip search, this court’s pre-\ncedent does not suggest that a cross-gender strip search is\nunconstitutional where the genitals remain covered through-\nout the procedure. After considering  Grummett, Jordan, and\nMichenfelder, this court noted that  “it is highly questionable\neven today whether prison inmates have a Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from routine unclothed searches by officials\nof the opposite sex, or from viewing of their unclothed bodies\nby officials of the opposite sex. ” Somers v. Thurman, 109\nF.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir. 1997). This is even more true when\nthe  special concern about  “involuntary  exposure of [one’s\ngenitals] in the presence of people of the other sex ” is not\nimplicated. Fortner v. Thomas, 983 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th\nCir. 1993). \nLastly, the majority seems to rest its analysis of the  “man-\nner” factor on the fact that O’Connell was unidentified to\nByrd and was wearing jeans and a t-shirt and that there were\nten  to fifteen non-participating officers present. Maj. Op.\n381-82. Even putting aside our heightened deference to prison\nofficials, the majority does not explain how the number of\nofficers, their attire, or their lack of identification somehow\noutweigh the jury’s finding that the search was appropriate, 5\n5The majority explains that this is relevant because of the “humiliation”\nof “exposing one’s nude body to strangers. ” Maj. Op. 370 n.1. However,\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 34 of 35\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 401\nthe professional nature of the search, or the County’s undis-\nputed need to utilize its female officers (or even how these\nfacts are relevant). Nor were such facts unreasonable in any\nevent. O’Connell testified that Byrd was allowed to ask her\nquestions  but didn’t. He talked to other officers after the\nsearch was over, and they explained that cadets had helped\nconduct the search. It was also not unreasonable for some\nofficers not to participate in the search. We see no reason to\nintimate that a search is constitutionally suspect because not\nevery single officer present laid hands on the prisoner. Surely\nthis cuts the other way, if it cuts at all. 6\nThe majority’s holding on this point illustrates the risks of\nnot giving proper deference to prison officials. As part of the\nprison’s search for contraband, officials ordered more than\nninety inmates out of their cells into the common area. In con-\ntrast, there were only twenty-five to thirty Academy cadets\nand ten to fifteen uniformed detention officers present. At\nbest,  the prison officials were outnumbered two to one.\nit does not explain how identification or uniforms would make the cadets\nnot “strangers.” Given their matching white shirts, supervision by other\nguards, and participation in the search, it was surely apparent that the\ncadets were present in an official capacity, not just strangers off the street.\nMoreover, contrary to the majority’s assertion, Byrd was not nude. Maj.\nOp. 370, 383 nn.1, 8. There is no basis in the record for its assertion that\nthe  pink boxers were sheer, see-through, or even nearly see-through\n(which really means not see-through). The majority’s reference to Arizona\nand Hawaii law for the proposition that appearing in public dressed in\nboxer shorts would be illegal is also unfounded. First, the laws set stan-\ndards for obscenity, not indecent exposure. Second, and more importantly,\nthe record is clear that at no point did O’Connell see any area covered by\nthe boxer shorts, including the genital area. Therefore, the oft-quoted  “de-\nsire to shield one’s unclothed figure from the view of strangers, ” York v.\nStory, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963) , was satisfied in this case. \n6The majority also relies on the fact that one or two people in the room,\nabout 30 feet away from Byrd, had video cameras. Maj. Op. 381-82. But\nwe have previously found that some strip searches were reasonable even\nwhen transmitted to video screens monitored by guards of the opposite\nsex. Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 329-30, 333. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 130-1    Filed 01/27/11   Page 35 of 35\n402 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nImportantly,  judges are instructed not to intrude into that\nsphere  of decision making. Deciding to accelerate the\nsearches by using additional assistance from female cadets\nhardly seems unreasonable in these circumstances. I question\nsecond-guessing  prison administrators when such credible\nthreats to officers’ safety are present. Indeed, I would think\nsuch security concerns vindicate the Supreme Court’s instruc-\ntion to defer to prison administrators—an instruction that it\nseems the majority has too hastily disregarded. \nIn sum, we are guided by our precedent and bound by\nSupreme Court precedent, the jury’s undisputed factual find-\nings, and our deference to prison officials’ expertise in these\nmatters. Balancing the four Bell factors in light of these limi-\ntations, I conclude that O’Connell’s search of Byrd was rea-\nsonable  under the Fourth Amendment, and I respectfully\ndissent from the contradictory analysis in the majority opin-\nion.",

A third of the cadets were female. Plaintiff happened to be searched by a female, Defendant O'Connell. \n \n1. The district court certified all issues as frivolous for appeal except one, namely, whether a policy allowing routine \nfemale searches of male inmates over their boxers violates the Fourteenth or Eighth Amendments. Plaintiff has not \nargued the Eighth Amendment on appeal. Is the Fourteenth Amendment facial challenge issue the only issue properly \non appeal? \n \n2. Does a policy allowing a cross-gender pat search over a male inmate's boxers facially violate either substantive due \nprocess, equal protection, or the Fourth Amendment? \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 5 \n \n3. The only as-applied issues tried to the jury were (1) whether Defendant O'Connell “groped” Plaintiff and thereby \nviolated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and (2) whether the search was conducted solely for training \npurposes and thereby violated the Fourth Amendment. The jury found for Defendants on all claims and Plaintiff has \nnot argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Has Plaintiff waived any other as-applied argu-\nment, namely, whether the search violated his Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment rights based on the circumstances of \nthe search, even though he was not groped and the search was for legitimate security reasons? \n \n4. If the argument was not waived, was the search constitutional as applied to Plaintiff? \n \n5. Was the trial court well within its discretion in giving the jury an “adverse inference” instruction (regarding a party's \nfailure to preserve evidence)? \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nPlaintiff's Statement of the Case is incomplete for the following reasons: \n \n1. The district court noted that the case had three parts: (1) the claim that Defendant O'Connell groped Plaintiff's \ngenitalia when conducting her search; (2) the claim that the search was merely a training exercise and not conducted \nfor legitimate security reasons; and (3) the claim that female on male searches violate the Eighth or Fourteenth \nAmendments. (Supp. ER at p. 2). The court ruled that an appeal would be frivolous on all but the last issue and de-\nclined to appoint counsel on all but the last issue. (Id.) Arguably, then, the only issue properly before this Court is the \nlast issue - the claim that a policy allowing female on male over-boxers searches facially violates the Eighth or \nFourteenth Amendments.[FN1] 28 U.S.C. §1915(a)(3) (“An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court \ncertifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith”). \n \nFN1. Plaintiff has not raised any Eighth Amendment argument on appeal. \n \n2. The district court did not simply “sua sponte dismiss[ ] Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim,” as Plaintiff states. (OB at \n3.) The court dismissed it because it recognized that it had an obligation to screen pro se complaints under 28 U.S.C. \n§1915(e)(2) and 42 U.S.C §1997e(c). (See ER at p. 59.) The court noted that (a) prisoners are not a suspect class; (b) \ninmates are not entitled to identical treatment; (c) mere inequality does not violate the equal protection clause; (d) the \nappropriate test was the rational basis test; and (d) Plaintiff had the burden of showing some invidious discriminatory \nintent. (Id. at p. 60.) It then dismissed the claim “without prejudice,” because Plaintiff failed to allege that he was a \nmember of a suspect class, and he failed to allege that Defendants' conduct in searching him was the result of pur-\nposeful or invidious discrimination, or that the conduct bore no rational relationship to a legitimate govemmental \ninterest. (Id. at p. 61.) \n \n3. After trial, the district court directed a verdict for Defendants on Plaintiffs general challenge to the cross-gender \nsearch. (ER at pp. 405-406.) In other words, the court ruled as a matter of law that cross-gender searches of inmates do \nnot violate the Fourteenth Amendment (and perhaps the Fourth Amendment). This is a legal issue on a facial challenge \nto the policy. The only facial challenge Plaintiff has raised on appeal is under the equal protection clause. \n \n4. At the close of evidence, before the case went to the jury, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for \nCaptain Peterson, because he was neither the jail commander at the time of the search, nor present when the search was \nconducted. (ER at p. 404:12-15.) The court also granted judgment as a matter of law for Sheriff Arpaio in his indi-\nvidual capacity because he had no involvement in the search. (ER at p. 416:14-19.) \n \n5. The court had dismissed Plaintiff's claim for damages on summary judgment because Plaintiff had not suffered the \nphysical injury required under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. §1997e(e). (Id. at p. 62.) This conclusion \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 6 \ndid not bar Plaintiff from proving a claim for compensatory, nominal, and punitive damages not premised on emo-\ntional injury. (Id.) \n \n6. The claims that survived summary judgment and went to trial were: (a) Plaintiff's claim that Deputy O'Connell \nviolated his Fourth Amendment rights by groping him; (b) Plaintiff's claim that Deputy O'Connell violated his subs-\ntantive due process rights by groping him (i.e. substantial harm without justification); and (c) Plaintiff's claim that \nDeputy O'Connell violated his Fourth Amendment rights by conducting a search without security reasons for doing so. \n(ER at p. 80-81.) The two fact issues for the jury were (a) whether Deputy O'Connell groped Mr. Byrd during the \nsearch, and (b) whether the search was conducted for other than security reasons. (ER at p. 404:16-21.) \n \n7. The jury found for Deputy O'Connell on all three claims. That is, they found as a matter of fact that Deputy O'-\nConnell did not grope Plaintiff during the search, and the search was conducted for legitimate security reasons and not \nas a training exercise. (ER at pp. 77-78 and 183-84.) The facts must be viewed in a light most favorable to upholding \nthis verdict. See Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, 111 (2005). \n \nDefendants disagree that the manner in which the issues were decided was “unorthodox,” as Plaintiff asserts. (OB at 4, \nn.3.) Before the case was given to the jury, the court ruled for Defendants as a matter of law on all of Plaintiffs facial \nchallenges to the cross-gender search, and sent to the jury only the as-applied issues, i.e., whether the search as con-\nducted on Mr. Byrd was unconstitutional. \n \nSTATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS \n \nThe following facts are stated in a light most favorable to upholding the jury's verdict. Muehler v. Mena, 544 U.S. 93, \n111 (2005). \n \nA. Preliminary facts. \n \nDefendants object to the gratuitous, and factually unsupported, comments that Plaintiff's counsel makes about Sheriff \nArpaio. (OB at 6.) Gratuitous comments by counsel will not carry the day in this Court when legal arguments fail. \n \nMr. Byrd was a pretrial detainee being held in the Durango Jail when the search at issue occurred. (ER at p. 42.) It is \nirrelevant why he was being held in jail. (OB at 5.) \n \nB. Facts regarding the Sheriff's policies on searches. \n \nSheriff's Office policy DH-3 defines a “frisk (body) search” as “carefully examining an inmate by inspecting his \nclothing, and feeling the contours of his clothed body.” (ER at p. 855.) It defines a “strip search” as “a visual scan of \nthe inmate's skin after all clothing has been removed. A strip search may include a visual body cavity search.” (ER at \np. 856.) Deputy O'Connell testified that she conducted a pat (frisk) search on Mr. Byrd because he had clothing on. \n(ER at pp. 291:6-292:1, 655:11-24, 667:9-15.) Captain Peterson confirmed this. (ER at p. 340:8-20.) \n \nPolicy DH-3(5)(A) states: “Male inmates may be frisk searched by either male or female officers. Female inmates will \nonly be searched by female officers, absent exigent circumstances.” (ER at p. 857.) The jury, finding in favor of \nDefendant O'Connell on all issues, obviously believed that she appropriately conducted a frisk search on Mr. Byrd as \nshe and Captain Peterson testified. \n \nC. Facts regarding the purpose of the cross-gender policy. \n \nSheriff Arpaio testified that that the purpose for the policy was security in the jail. (ER at p. 229:18-231:16.) The \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 7 \nSheriff's Department has 10,000 total inmates, only 300 to 400 of which are female. (ER at p. 209:13-18.) Contraband \nis a constant problem. (ER at pp. 257:14-258:12.) To maintain a handle on this problem (Id.), searches are conducted \nevery time inmates leave their cells, every time they leave their housing unit, and every time they go to or return from \nvisitation, medical, court, activities, or other programs. In fact, inmates are searched at least once daily, and more often \nseveral times daily. (ER at p. 290:2-22.) All of these searches are pat searches, except for those conducted after the \ninmate returns from a contact visit or from outside the facility, which are strip searches. (Id.) In addition, pat searches \nof the inmates and searches of their cells are conducted any time the facility obtains information of something going \non, such as reports of contraband, increased fighting, etc. (ER at pp. 349:15-24, 640:17-24.) \n \nCaptain Peterson confirmed that there are simply not enough male officers at the facility to conduct all of these \nsearches on the male inmates without the help of the female officers. (ER at pp. 330:19-22; 333:10-334:22.) Especially \nwhen 90 inmates are being moved out of a pod so that they and their cells can be searched, the facility needs a lot of \nmanpower to conduct the search. (ER at p. 320:23.)[FN2] \n \nFN2. That is why the facility needs to ask the cadet class to come over and assist in many cases. (ER at pp. \n349:15-350:21.) On the date in question, while the cadets were pat searching the inmates, approximately \neight Swat officers were searching the pods and the inmates' clothing (ER at p. 697:10-16), and the 10-15 \ndetention officers (ER at p. 18-24) were making sure the searches were within policy (ER at p. 695:8-18) and \nwere there for the cadets' protection. (ER at pp. 304:16-305:15.) \n \nD. Facts regarding the purpose of the search. \n \nPlaintiff grossly misrepresents the record regarding the purpose for the search. (OB at 8-9, 12-14.) He accuses that it is \n“standard practice” for cadets to go to the jail to “practice” pat down searches as a final component of their training, \nand he purports to cite to the testimony of Captain Peterson for the proposition. (OB at 8-9.) Yet Captain Peterson \nnever testified to that, and the citation does not support the accusation. (See below.) Furthermore, the assertion rings \nhollow, given that the jury found as fact that the search was conducted for legitimate security reasons and the facts \nmust be viewed in a light most favorable to upholding that verdict. \n \nCaptain Peterson never testified that cadets are brought over to the jails for training searches. He testified that the only \ntime cadets come to the jails for searches is when a search needs to be conducted for security purposes and there is not \nenough manpower at the jail to accomplish the search. (ER at p. 350:5-21.) He specifically denied that cadets ever \nshow up at the jail without such a request. (ER at p. 350:22-351:3.) There are simply not enough male detention \nofficers to properly conduct searches at the jail. (ER at 333:14-19.) He agreed that it would not be permissible for a \nsheriff's cadet to search an inmate solely for training purposes. (ER at p. 321:23-322:12; 323:4-7.) \n \nSheriff Arpaio testified that searches are conducted for security reasons. (ER at p. 259:17-21.) He could not think of \nany reason to disrupt 93 inmates out of their pods other than for security purposes. (ER at p. 259:24-260:4.) \n \nDespite Plaintiff's counsel's attempt to badger Deputy O'Connell, she also testified repeatedly that the search was not a \ntraining exercise. (ER at pp. 659:19-20; 220:1-3; 693:15-17; 306:24-367:3; 299:25-300:2.) She testified that when \nthey went to the jail to perform the search they were told of a suspicion of contraband and of multiple fights in the unit; \nthat they needed manpower and needed them to go over and help with the searches. (ER at p. 640:15-24.) Inmates are \nsearched over their boxers “a couple of times a week.” (ER at pp. 292:15-293:4.) \n \nAt the jail, no one instructed the cadets how to properly search inmates. (ER at p. 650:2-5, 304:2-12.) While the cadets \nwere searching the inmates, the Swat team was searching the pods and the inmates' clothing. (ER at p. 697:10-16.)[FN3] \n \nFN3. Plaintiff cites language from Defendants' early motion for summary judgment for the proposition that \nthe search was conducted for training purposes. (OB at 12-13.) But the jury was read the language from the \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \nmotion (see, e.g., ER at p. 641:10-20) and found otherwise. \n \nE. Facts regarding the search. \n \nOn the day in question, all 90 inmates in Plaintiff's pod were subject to the same search. (ER at pp. 609:22-610:8; \n282:16-17.) Defendant O'Connell was a cadet, an officer in training. (ER at pp. 627:19-628:1.) Approximately 25 or \n30 cadets, a third of whom were female, went over, to the jail. (ER at p. 650:13-17.) About 10 or 15 officers, a third of \nthem female, were there also. (ER at pp. 650:18-651:2, 582:1-10.) \n \nAt the jail, again no one instructed the cadets how to properly search inmates. The academy instructors were there \nbecause anyone who is not a full-fledged officer must be accompanied in the jail by officers, for the cadets' protection. \n(ER at pp. 303:18-305:1.) \n \nThe cadets were told that the inmates would be brought out in a line to the multipurpose room in their boxers, that the \ncadets were to pat search them, and when finished, the inmates would go to the opposite end of the room and sit \ncross-legged facing the wall. (ER at p. 651:8-14.) The cadets would then go to the back of the line and wait for the next \nline of inmates to search. (ER at p. 282:10-17.) When the inmates came out of their pod, four to six at a time, they \nwalked in front of the officers and turned so that the officers were already behind them in rows. (ER at p. 653:5-18.) \nMr. Byrd confirmed this process in his testimony. (ER at pp. 607:19-608:9, 610:10-18.) The inmates were told to look \nstraight ahead, not to look around, and to face the wall when they were finished and sitting down. (Id.; ER at pp. \n611:14-16; 613:7-10; 282:12-15.)[FN4] Mr. Byrd happened to be one of the inmates that Deputy O'Connell searched. \n(ER at p. 659:11-12.)[FN5] Deputy O'Connell had no idea how many inmates she searched that day. (ER at p. \n282:16-19.) \n \nFN4. Thus, while “over 100” people might or might not have been in the room at some point during the \nsearch (OB at 11), each search was not witnessed by that many people, because the 90 other inmates were \nordered to look straight ahead and when their search was finished, to sit cross-legged across the room facing \nthe wall. (ER at p. 610:10-18, 611:16.) Mr. Byrd did not look around at other inmates while he was being \nsearched. (ER at p. 6137-10.) \n \nFN5. It is therefore inaccurate to state, as Mr. Byrd does, that Defendant O'Connell was “selected” to search \nhim. (OB at 11.) \n \nF. Facts regarding the method of searching. \n \nDeputy O'Connell testified that she has searched a few hundred men during her employment with the Sheriff's Office, \nand she has never had a complaint from anyone about her searches. (ER at p. 700:4-18.) Mr. Byrd testified that the \nsearch took approximately 60 seconds. (ER at p. 617:17-20.) Deputy O'Connell testified that it took 10 to 20 seconds. \n(ER at pp. 699:25- 700:3.) \n \nDeputy O'Connell described how the pat search is conducted. First, with a pat search, she does not put her hands on \nany skin she can see. (ER at p. 6611:4-11.) The officer searches from behind the inmate. (ER at p. 6112:10-25.) The \nboxers waistband is pulled out a couple of inches and the waistband is felt to ensure that no contraband is taped to the \ninside. The hands do not touch the inmate's body. (ER at p. 678:19-679:8.) Deputy O'Connell did not look inside the \nboxer shorts when she pulled Mr. Byrd's waistband out and felt it for contraband. (ER at p. 681:4-6.)6 Next, one hand \nis placed at the lower back on the boxer shorts while the other hand, using slight pressure, pat searches the outer thigh \nfrom the bottom of the shorts up. (ER at pp. 681:15-682:7, 683:14-15, 632:9-10.) Deputy O'Connell testified that she \nhas never accidentally touched an inmate's skin as she is searching over the boxer shorts. (ER at p. 682:12-22.) Then, \nshe slides the same hand to the inner thigh over the shorts, searching up to where the groin and leg connect. (ER at p. \n683:1-13.) Her hand is flat, with the thumb extended and her fingers straight out pressed together to prevent any \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 9 \nsensation of groping or “fingers everywhere.” (ER at p. 701:6- 702:12, 637:7-16.) The back of her flat hand moves the \nscrotum out of the way so that she can make sure there is nothing taped to or hidden in the groin, inner thigh, or pe-\nrineum. (ER at pp. 639:2-13, 683:14-684:[FN6], 690:14-17, 691:12-18.)[FN7] Then she switches hands and completes the \nsearch on the other thigh in the same way. (ER at pp. 685:17-686:18, 687:10-688:1.) Next she takes her hand to the \nbottom of the buttocks cheeks where they start and runs the hand up through the crack to make sure nothing is taped, \nplaced or hidden on the inside of the buttocks. (ER at p. 688:2-13.) Her hand is never cupped, and she never gropes or \nsqueezes the testicles, scrotum or penis. (ER at p. 685:5-10, 688:20- 689:1, 632:21-23.) Deputy O'Connell testified \nthat she has never searched an inmate's penis, (ER at pp. 690:1-6, 637:24-638:4) and she has never accidentally \ntouched an inmate's penis. (ER at p. 705:8-11.) \n \nFN6. The trial court held that the search of the waistband was not unconstitutional. (ER at pp. 421:14-422:3.) \n \nFN7. At no time did she testify that she “lift[ed] Mr. Byrd's testicles and moved them to the side.” (OB at 10.) \nIn fact, she specifically stated, I'm not cupping [the scrotum], I'm not grabbing it, and I'm not lifting it up to \nlook underneath it.” (ER at p. 639:10-13.) \n \nG. Facts regarding the videotape. \n \nMr. Byrd testified that he saw two people with handheld video cameras during the search. (ER at p. 602:19-25, \n605:5-17.) He testified that they were approximately 30 feet away from him. (ER at p. 605:17-21.) He did not testify \nthat the video camera was running the whole time, and he did not testify that his search specifically was videotaped. \n \nDeputy O'Connell testified that there was no stationary surveillance video tape taken in the multipurpose room. (ER at \np. 278:12-14.) She testified that one person had been following her academy class from beginning to end to take clips \nof what they had done in the academy, and made a video of it at the end as a sort of yearbook for the cadets. (ER at p. \n278:20-279:4.) She testified that he did not take videos of the entire search; he only took few-second clips of any event. \n(ER at p. 279:11-18.) The jury was shown that part of the yearbook tape that included the search of Mr. Byrd's pod, but \nas Deputy O'Connell testified, Mr. Byrd was not visible on the tape. (ER at pp. 286:2-3, 8-13, 287:7- 288:12.)[FN8] \n \nFN8. Thus, Mr. Byrd's assertion that “he and the other inmates” were videotaped (OB at 11) is in error. \n \nPlaintiff's counsel argued that the Sheriff's office failed to preserve evidence (in the form of the “tape of the entire \nsearch”)  and  requested  an  adverse  inference  instruction.  (ER  at  pp.  466:5-467:1,  468:7-9:21,  471:10-23, \n472:14-473:12, 475:9-17.) The district court gave a general adverse inference instruction and allowed the parties to \nargue its application. (ER at pp. 83, 134, 409:5-414:3.) \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n \n1. The only issue properly on appeal is a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the Sheriff's cross-gender search \npolicy under the Fourteenth Amendment. This is the only issue the district court found not frivolous on appeal, and for \nwhich counsel was appointed. \n \n2. The policy survives a facial constitutional challenge. On a facial challenge, Plaintiff must demonstrate that there is \nno set of circumstances under which the policy can be constitutional. Plaintiff does not even make this argument. \n \n3. The Policy does not violate the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendments, because it does not require or allow gratuitous \ninvasions of privacy, and because a policy allowing cross-gender pat searches is reasonable in and of itself. The \ncross-gender nature of the search policy is necessary for jail security and to ensure equal employment opportunities for \nfemale officers. This Court has repeatedly held that searches or surveillance of male prisoners by female detention \nofficers do not violate the constitution. See, e.g., Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1995); Michenfelder \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 10 \nv. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 334 (9th Cir. 1988). \n \n4. The Policy does not violate equal protection. Plaintiff has not demonstrated or argued that male and female inmates \nare similarly situated. Further, the Sheriff's Policy serves the important government objectives of jail security and \nequal employment opportunities for female officers, and the cross- gender searches are not only substantially related \nto the achievement of those objectives, but are integrally necessary to achieve them. Cross-gender pat search policies \nhave been repeatedly upheld on equal protection grounds. Madyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d 954, 962 (7th Cir. 1983); \nOliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 746-47 (5th Cir. 2002); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1102-03 (8th Cir. 1990). \n \n5. Plaintiff's as-applied argument is inappropriate on appeal. The only as-applied arguments that the jury decided were \nwhether Deputy O'Connell groped Plaintiff during the search, which would have violated his Fourth and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights, or whether the search was conducted for reasons other than legitimate security reasons, which \nwould have violated Plaintiffs Fourth Amendment rights. The jury found against Plaintiff on all these issues and he \ndoes not argue the insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict. Plaintiff cannot raise, for the first time on \nappeal, a new argument that the legitimate, properly conducted search of him was nevertheless unconstitutional be-\ncause of the surrounding circumstances or because it constituted “punishment” before adjudication. He did not raise or \nlitigate these issues below. \n \n6. Even if the Court were to consider the as-applied argument, it lacks merit. Nothing about the circumstances of the \nsearch made it unreasonable. The fact that the pat search was conducted over Plaintiff's boxers, and in the multipur-\npose room, does not turn an otherwise constitutional search into an unreasonable one. The evidence showed, and the \njury believed, that Deputy O'Connell conducted a reasonable, professional pat search of Plaintiff. \n \n7. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving the jury a general adverse inference instruction. Plaintiffs \nproffered instruction was erroneous. Further, Plaintiff fails to show any abuse of discretion, or harmful error, in the \ncourt's decision to admit into evidence a snippet video tape showing the cadets practicing searches. Plaintiff opened \nthe door to admission of the tape, and he affirmatively used it in closing to argue that the search was for training \npurposes. The jury simply did not believe him. \n \n21LEGAL ARGUMENT \n \nI. THE ONLY ISSUE PROPERLY ON APPEAL IS WHETHER A GENERAL POLICY ALLOWING FE-\nMALE-ON-MALE OVER- BOXERS PAT-DOWN SEARCHES VIOLATES THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT \n \nBefore the case went to the jury, the district court rejected, as a matter of law, any “general challenge to the validity of \nfemale-on-male searches  including patdowns in the  groin area.” (ER at pp. 392:4-6, 392:21-393:7, 405:5-8, \n405:23-406:1.) This is the only issue the court found not frivolous for appeal, and on which counsel was appointed for \nappeal: namely, whether a general policy that allows cross-gender pat searches (female on male) violates the Eighth or \nFourteenth Amendments. (Supp. ER at p. 2.) Plaintiff has not raised the Eighth Amendment issue in his opening brief, \nso the only issue appropriate for this Court is the Fourteenth Amendment facial challenge.[FN9] [The only facial chal-\nlenge Plaintiff raises on appeal is under the equal protection clause.] Because counsel was not appointed on any other \nissue, the Court should decline to consider any other issue. 28 U.S.C. §1915(a)(3).[FN10]  \n \nFN9. The only Fourteenth Amendment issue that was tried was whether Defendant O'Connell groped \nPlaintiff during her search and thereby subjected him to substantive harm without justification. (ER at pp. \n404, 80.) The jury found that Defendant O'Connell did not grope Plaintiff and Plaintiff does not contest this \nfinding on appeal. \n \nFN10. The other issues are briefed in the event the Court decides to consider them despite the district court's \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 11 \nruling of frivolousness. \n \n*22 II. THE POLICY ALLOWING CROSS-GENDER PAT SEARCHES OVER A MALE INMATE'S \nBOXERS SURVIVES A FACIAL CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE \n \nA. Standard of Review. \n \nThe issue of whether a general policy that allows cross-gender pat searches (female on male) violates the constitution \nis reviewed de novo. Horphag Research Ltd. v. Pellegrini, 337 F.3d 1036, 1040 (9th Cir.2003) (“We review de novo a \ndistrict court's grant of judgment as a matter of law”).[FN11] \n \nFN11. Note: The issue here is not whether the cross-gender search amounted to punishment before convic-\ntion. (See OB at p. 38.) The district court held that Plaintiff had waived any such claim by not raising it before \ntrial. (ER at pp. 423:1-424:11.) \n \nB. Plaintiff has neither argued nor demonstrated that the policy is facially unconstitutional. \n \nA facial challenge to a policy is the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, because Plaintiff must establish \nthat “no set of circumstances exists” under which the policy could be valid. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, \n745 (1987); U.S. v. Dang, 488 F.3d 1135, 1142 (9th Cir. 2007). Frankly, Plaintiff has not even argued the point. There \nis no basis for this Court to reverse the district court's ruling that the Sheriffs Office policy is facially constitutional as \na matter of law. \n \nThe policy survives a facial challenge in any event. \n \n*23 C. The policy is facially constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of substantive due \nprocess. \n \nSubstantive Due Process would prohibit a gratuitous invasion of privacy. See Hart v. Sheahan, 396 F.3d 887, 892 (7th \nCir. 2005). The central mission of the substantive component of the due process clause is to provide redress for, and \ndeter, abuse of governmental authority. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330-32 (1986). But nothing in the policy or \nin the record demonstrates that cross-gender pat searches of male inmates are done gratuitously or as an abuse of \ngovernmental authority. To the contrary, in fact, Sheriff Arpaio testified that that the purpose for this policy was \nsecurity in the jail. Out of 10,000 total inmates, only 300 to 400 are female. Contraband is a constant problem. To \nmaintain a handle on this problem, searches are conducted every time inmates leave their cells, every time they leave \nthe housing unit, and every time they go to or return from visitation, medical, court, activities, or other programs. In \nfact, inmates are searched at least once daily, and more often several times daily. All of these searches are pat searches, \nexcept for those conducted after the inmate returning from a contact visit or from outside the facility, which are strip \nsearches. In addition, pat searches of the inmates and searches of their cells are conducted any time the facility obtains \ninformation of something going on, such as reports of contraband, increased fighting, etc. \n \n*24 There are simply not enough male officers at the facility to conduct all of these searches on the male inmates \nwithout the help of the female officers, especially when 90 inmates are being moved out of a pod so that they and their \ncells can be searched. Based on this evidence, Plaintiff could not succeed in any facial challenge, which requires him \nto prove that “no set of circumstances exist” under which the policy could be valid. There is no evidence that the \ncross-gender searches are done gratuitously. \n \nCase law from this Circuit is in accord. This Court has repeatedly held that searches or surveillance of male prisoners \nby female detention officers do not violate the Constitution. See, e.g., Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. \n1995) (policy allowing females to conduct pat-down searches including groin area does not violate the Fourteenth \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 12 \nAmendment); Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 334 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that the monitoring of male pris-\noners by female officers during strip searches or on shower duty does not violate the Fourth Amendment). In \nGrummett, the Court said: \n[R]outine pat-down searches, which include the groin area, and which are otherwise justified by security needs,[FN12] \ndo not violate the fourteenth amendment because a correctional officer of the opposite gender conducts such a search. \n \nFN12. The jury here found that the search in question was justified by legitimate security concerns. \n \n*25 779 F.2d at 495, citing Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099 (D. Or. 1983) (upholding opposite-sex pat searches \nby female guards that includes a search of both the genital and buttock areas) and Smith v. Fairman, 678 F.2d 52 (7th \nCir. 1982) (upholding a policy permitting female guards to pat search male inmates, excluding the genital area). The \nCourt reasoned that the searches do not involve intimate contact with the inmate's body, that the females conducted \nthemselves in a professional manner (as the jury found Deputy O'Connell did here), and that females cannot conduct \nor observe strip or body cavity searches (as is true in this case as well). Id. and at 496.[FN13] See also Madyun v. Franzen, \n704 F.2d 954 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 464 U.S. 996 (1983) (upholding a policy permitting pat searches of males by \nfemale guards, even where there might be incidental contact with the genital area); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, \n1101 (8th Cir. 1990), cert denied, 501 U.S. 1209 (1991) (cross-gender pat-downs, even if they include the groin area, \nare not per se unconstitutional); Martin v. Swift, 781 F. Supp. 1250, 1253 (E.D. Mich. 1992) (there is “no question that \n*26 [the pat-down search of a female arrestee by a male officer] would pass constitutional muster. To find otherwise \nwould require every police car to carry two officers, one male and one female, so that misdemeanants would be \nsearched by officers of the same sex.”). \n \nFN13. Plaintiff argues that Grummett is distinguishable because there, the inmates were “fully clothed.” (OB \nat 32.) But this is of no moment, because Grummett was a facial challenge to a policy allowing females to pat \nsearch clothed male inmates. Again, in a facial challenge, Plaintiff must demonstrate that there are no cir-\ncumstances under which the policy can be reasonable, and in light of Grummet 's holding he cannot do so. \nThe fact that some of the searches might be conducted over the inmate's boxers does not make the policy \nfacially unconstitutional. \n \nHere, Policy DH-3 allows female officers to pat search male inmates over their clothing. The fact that these pat \nsearches sometimes occur when male inmates are in their boxer shorts does not demonstrate that the policy is facially \nunconstitutional. Nothing in the record even suggests that the only reason female officers can search male inmates is to \ninflict gratuitous harm. In short, Plaintiff has not met his burden of demonstrating that there are no circumstances in \nwhich cross-gender pat searches are reasonable. \n \nD. The policy is facially valid under the Fourth Amendment. \n \nThe only issue that was litigated with respect to the Fourth Amendment was an as-applied issue: whether Defendant \nO'Connell groped Mr. Byrd during the search and thus conducted an unreasonable search. Plaintiff never argued the \ngeneral invalidity of cross-gender searches under the Fourth Amendment, and therefore the argument was waived. \nO'Guinn v. Lovelock Correctional Center, 502 F.3d 1056, 1063 n.3 (9th Cir. 2007). For these reasons the Court should \nnot consider this issue. But even if the Court does consider the issue, affirmance is appropriate. \n \n*27 1. Plaintiff has no Fourth Amendment privacy interest.[FN14] \n \nFN14. Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 140 (1979) (stating that the first step in a § 1983 analysis is to \nidentify the specific constitutional right involved). \n \nThe Fourth Amendment does not protect privacy interests within prisons. Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144 (7th Cir. \n1995); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526-30 (1984).[FN15] See also Somers v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir. \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 13 \n1997) (“it is highly questionable even today whether prison inmates have a Fourth Amendment right to be free from \nroutine unclothed searches by officials of the opposite sex, or from viewing of their unclothed bodies by officials of \nthe opposite sex.”). Indeed, while this Court has previously assumed that some vestige of a right exists, Grummett v. \nRushen, 779 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1985), the Court has specifically declined to decide whether prisoners have a Fourth \nAmendment privacy right that could be infringed by the cross-gender nature of an otherwise proper and legitimate \nsearch. Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1524-25 (9th Cir. 1993). Nor has Plaintiff established, either below or on \nappeal, that he has a Fourth Amendment privacy interest in having a pat search conducted only by an officer of his \nsame gender. Since he has not established a Fourth Amendment right, he cannot show any violation of such a right. \n \nFN15. “A right of privacy in traditional Fourth Amendment terms is fundamentally incompatible with the \nclose and continual surveillance of inmates and their cells required to ensure institutional security and in-\nternal order.” 468 U.S. at 527-28, citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537 (1979). \n \n*28 2. Even if Plaintiff had a Fourth Amendment privacy interest, the policy at issue is facially constitutional. \n \nPlaintiff has not argued that Sheriffs Office policy DH-3 is facially unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and \nfor reasons similar to those stated above, such an argument would not succeed. Again, Plaintiff could not demonstrate \nthat under no circumstances can a cross-gender search be reasonable under the policy. Indeed, when faced with the \nissue, this Court has never held that a female detention officer could not conduct searches of male inmates. See, e.g., \nSomers  v.  Thurman,  109  F.3d 614,  620-21  (9th  Cir. 1997)  (a  Fourth  Amendment  privacy  right  prohibiting \ncross-gender searches was not clearly established in 1993); Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1995); \nMichenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 334 (9th Cir. 1988). See also Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099, 1103 (D. \nOr. 1983); Madyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d 954 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 464 U.S. 996 (1983); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d \n1093, 1100-01 (8th Cir. 1990), cert denied, 501 U.S. 1209 (1991). This precedent alone is sufficient to affirm the facial \nconstitutionality of Policy DH-3 under the Fourth Amendment.[FN16] \n \nFN16. Indeed, in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Court held that visual body cavity searches do not \nviolate detainees' Fourth Amendment rights; and if visual body cavity searches are constitutional, then \nclothed “pat-down” frisk searches by officers of the opposite gender are also surely reasonable and therefore \nfacially constitutional. Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099, 1103 (D. Or. 1983). \n \n*29 E. The policy does not violate equal protection. \n \nBecause counsel was not appointed on this issue, and it was not certified as non-frivolous, the Court should decline to \nconsider it. It is briefed in the event the Court decides to consider it.[FN17] \n \nFN17. The district court dismissed this claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) and 42 U.S.C. §1997e(c). This \nCourt reviews de novo a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) in the same manner as a dismissal \nunder Federal Rule of civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998). \n \n1. Policy DH-3 does not implicate equal protection. \n \nArguably, Sheriff's Office policy DH-3 does not even implicate the equal protection clause. The equal protection \nclause ensures that gender classifications may not be used, as they once were, to create or perpetuate the legal, social, \nand economic inferiority of women. U.S. v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 534 (1996) (holding that Virginia had shown no \nexceedingly persuasive justification for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI). \nPolicy DH-3 does not even facially deprive either gender of a right or opportunity given to the other gender. As is \nshown above, no inmate has a constitutional right to be free from cross-gender pat searches. See Madyun v. Franzen, \n704 F.2d 954, 962 (7th Cir. 1983) (cross-gender search does not violate equal protection; “The right to be searched by \na member of one's own sex ... is hardly a right that can be analogized to the educational, recreational *30 and voca-\n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 14 \ntional programs that courts have required prisons to provide on an equal basis”). \n \n2. Plaintiff failed to show that male and female inmates are similarly situated. \n \nPlaintiff seems to argue, erroneously, that the Sheriffs Office Policy is “facially discriminatory” simply because it \nallows female officers to pat search males, but does not allow male officers to pat search females, absent exigent \ncircumstances. (OB at 44-45.) But the equal protection clause does not proscribe gender as a basis for classification \nwhen the situations of men and women are different. Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County, 450 U.S. 464 \n(1981). \n \nPlaintiff was obligated to demonstrate that the male and female inmates are similarly situated, for example, by \nshowing the number of inmates housed, their average length of stay, their security levels, the incidence of violence, \nand victimhood. Oliver v. Scott, 276 F.3d 736, 746 (5th Cir. 2002) (upholding cross- sex monitoring of males but not \nfemales against equal protection challenge); Yates v. Stalder, 217 F.3d 332, 334 (5th Cir. 2000) (to prove an equal \nprotection violation on the basis of sex, male prisoners must prove male and female prisoners are similarly situated). \nHere, Plaintiff has never argued or demonstrated that male and female inmates are similarly situated for purposes *31 \nof pat searches by officers of the opposite gender. For this reason alone, the claim fails. \n \nIndeed, inmates are not entitled to be treated the same as other inmates simply because they are all inmates. Norvell v. \nIllinois, 373 U.S. 420, 423 (1963) (exact equality is no prerequisite of equal protection of the laws within the meaning \nof the Fourteenth Amendment). The fact that all inmates might feel some discomfort at being pat searched near their \ngroin area by opposite gender officers does not make males and females similarly situated for the purpose of a facial \nchallenge to the policy on equal protection grounds. Male and female inmates are not similarly situated in this case. \nPat searches must be conducted often in order to control contraband in the jail. Out of 10,000 inmates, only 300 to 400 \nare female. There are simply not enough male officers to conduct all of these searches on male inmates without the \nhelp of the female officers. Thus, if anything, the record demonstrates that the female inmates at the jail are not si-\nmilarly situated to the male inmates when it comes to needing officers of the opposite gender to search them. Timm v. \nGunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1102-03 (8th Cir. 1990) (upholding sex-neutral visual surveillance of male inmates as against \nequal protection challenge because male and female inmates not similarly situated). \n \n*32 3. Even if the inmates were similarly situated. Plaintiff fails to demonstrate a constitutional violation. \n \nEven if the Policy is examined under the equal protection clause, it is constitutional as a matter of law. State-sponsored \ngender discrimination is subject to “intermediate scrutiny.” United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); \nWengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 150 (1980). Under this test, a policy must be “substantially related \nto the achievement of an important governmental interest.”[FN18] Prison officials, however, are “accorded wide-ranging \ndeference” in deciding what policies are needed to maintain institutional security. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 \n(1979). Further, prison administrators enjoy a reasonable degree of flexibility in affording different treatment to male \nand female inmates in the interest of security or other legitimate penological functions. Madyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d \n954, 962 (7th Cir. 1983). \n \nFN18. The district court used the classification of “prisoners” and the rational relationship test. (ER at p. 60.) \nIt dismissed the equal protection claim “without prejudice” because Plaintiff failed to allege that he was a \nmember of a suspect class, that Defendants' conduct was the result of purposeful or invidious discrimination, \nor that the conduct bore no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. (Id. at pp. 60-61.) \nPlaintiffs complaint did not allege any of these elements. (ER at p. 871.) Further, though the claim was \ndismissed without prejudice, it was not developed, argued, or instructed at trial. \n \nThese precepts themselves demonstrate that the Sheriff's Policy serves important government objectives, and that the \nmeans are substantially related to *33 the achievement of those objectives. Institutional security is of paramount \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 15 \nimportance in he jails. As Captain Peterson testified, due to the number of male inmates, and the need to curtail con-\ntraband, the jail simply does not have the luxury of having male inmates pat searched by only male officers. Further, a \nthird of the detention officers are women. To prohibit them from conducting the full range of detention officer duties \nwould relegate them to back-office administrative tasks and reduce the security of the jail. As such, allowing cross- \ngender pat searches of male inmates serves the important government objectives of enhancing security in the jail and \nensuring equal employment for female officers; and the policy allowing such is not only substantially related, but it is \nintegrally necessary to achieve those objectives. Madyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d 954, 962 (7th Cir. 1983); Oliver v. Scott, \n276 F.3d 736, 746-47 (5th Cir. 2002); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1102-03 (8th Cir. 1990) (“Although an inmate \nmay very well retain some privacy rights when entering a prison, such rights, when balanced against the legitimate \nequal employment rights of male and female guards, and against the internal security needs of the prison, must give \nway to the use of pat searches on a sex-neutral basis...”) .[FN19] \n \nFN19. Oliver applied the Turner v. Safley test to the equal protection challenge to a policy allowing females \nto observe male inmates in showers, but not allowing males to observe female inmates. That test requires \nprison regulations to be “reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.” 276 F.3d at 747. The \nPolicy at issue here meets both tests. \n \n*34 F. The policy meets the test of Turner v. Safley.[FN20] \n \nFN20. Plaintiff erroneously analyzes the Turner test in connection with his as-applied argument. (OB at \n28-31.) See Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 334 (9th Cir. 1988) (analyzing the Turner factors in the \ncontext of a facial challenge to a policy allowing female officers to observe strip searches and to take shower \nduty). \n \nWhen a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to \nlegitimate penological interests. This standard is necessary if “prison administrators ..., and not the courts, [are] to \nmake the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). As Justice \nO'Connor stated in Turner, \nSubjecting the day-to-day judgments of prison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would seriously hamper \ntheir ability to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison \nadministration. The rule would also distort the decision making process, for every administrative judgment would be \nsubject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way of solving the \nproblem at hand. Courts inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what constitutes the best solution to every \nadministrative problem, thereby “unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs of \nprison administration.” \n \n482 U.S. at 89, quoting Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 407 (1974). \n \nUnder Turner, a jail policy passes constitutional muster when: (1) the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate and \nneutral governmental objective; (2) there are alternative avenues that remain open to the inmates to *35 exercise the \nright; (3) accommodating the asserted right would have a deleterious effect on guards, prisoners, and the allocation of \nprison resources; and (4) easy and obvious alternatives do not exist that fully accommodate the prisoner's rights at de \nminimis cost to valid penological interests. Id. at 89-90. This is not a balancing test. Turner, 482 U.S. at 87-90. \n \nCross-gender pat searches have already been upheld on a Turner analysis. See Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093 (8th Cir. \n1990). In Timm, the court upheld a policy allowing female officers to pat search clothed male inmates, though inci-\ndental touching of inmates' genital and anal areas could occur during the search. As the court stated: \nThe judgment exercised by prison administrators in striking a balance between the rights of prisoners and the demands \nof institutional security is to be given great deference. Such a balancing act is an exceedingly complex task, and not \none easily undertaken by the courts, whose expertise in the imperatives of institutional security is slight and in no way \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 16 \napproaches that of the professional administrators charged with the awesome task of running our prisons. \n \n917 F.2d at 1099 (citations omitted.) \n \n1. There is a “valid, rational connection” between the Policy the legitimate governmental interests that justify \nIt. \n \nFederal courts have already recognized that there is a  valid, rational connection between a policy allowing \ncross-gender pat searches of male *36 inmates, and the legitimate governmental interests that justify it. Those interests \nare (1) institutional security; and (2) non-discriminatory employment of female officers. See argument and cases cited \nabove. The institutional security need in this case is manifest in the record. All witnesses testified that there are not \nenough male officers to pat search 10,000 male inmates without the help of the female officers, who comprise \none-third of the officer force. The Policy is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives.[FN21] \n \nFN21. Plaintiff errs in attempting to argue this factor in the context of his as- applied argument. (OB at 34 et \nseq.) Because federal case law recognizes the  valid, rational connection between a policy allowing \ncross-gender pat searches of male inmates, and the legitimate governmental interests that justify it, it is ir-\nrelevant who was present at Plaintiff's particular search. Thus, the evidence cited above not only supports the \nfacial validity of the Policy, but defeats Plaintiff's conclusory statements that “ceasing the challenging \nconduct in this case would have been effortless” (OB at 34) and that the use of cross-gender searches “does \nnothing to advance the County's interest in maintaining security at the Durango Jail.” (OB at 37.) The same \nanalysis defeats Plaintiff's discussion of the Michenfelder case. (OB at 35-37.) \n \n2. Alternative means of exercising the right. \n \nInmates do not have any constitutional right not to be pat searched by officers of the opposite gender. Bagley v. Watson, \n579 F. Supp. 1099, 1103 (D.C. Or. 1993). Further, while an inmate might not have an alternative method of exercising \na right to privacy during the search (assuming it exists), this is of minimal importance. Timm, supra, at 1100. The \nsearch is of limited duration and is conducted only over clothing. The genitals and bare buttocks are not *37 viewed. \nThe fact that sometimes the clothing over which the pat search is conducted constitutes boxer shorts does not make the \npolicy facially unconstitutional. \n \n3. Requiring male-on-male pat searches would have a negative effect on guards and other inmates, and on the \nallocation of prison resources generally. \n \nWhen accommodation of an asserted right will have a significant “ripple effect” on fellow inmates or on prison staff, \ncourts should be particularly deferential to the informed discretion of corrections officials. Turner at 90. That is the \ncase here, since the testimony was that there are not enough male officers to conduct only male on male pat searches of \nall the inmates. Further, preventing female officers from conducting the full obligations of their job would cause a \nsignificant ripple effect on their ability for employment and advancement. Timm, 917 F.2d at 1100. For this reason, the \nPolicy is reasonably related to legitimate penological objectives. \n \n4. The absence of ready alternatives. \n \nPrison officials do not have to set up and then shoot down every conceivable alternative method of accommodating the \nclaimant's constitutional complaint. Turner at 90-91. Here, Plaintiff has not suggested any alternatives to the facility's \nneed to have the female officers' manpower to assist in conducting the male pat searches. Considering the lack of \nmanpower and the *38 detrimental effect on the female officers' employment that a male-on-male pat search policy \nwould cause, this factor favors the reasonableness of the Policy. \n \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 17 \nIn short, Plaintiff has not demonstrated any basis for reversal on the only issue the district court found not-frivolous, \nthat is, a facial challenge to the Sheriff's Policy. As the Timm court stated, \nThe administrators have decided that the best balance among the competing concerns is to allow pat searches on a \nsex-neutral basis; deciding that this is not an unreasonable regulation, we defer to their judgment and expertise. \n \nTimm, 917 F.2d at 1101. \n \nIII. THE POLICY IS CONSTITUTIONAL AS APPLIED TO PLAINTIFF \n \nA. Plaintiff's as-applied argument was waived. \n \nPlaintiff's Opening Brief is almost entirely devoted to arguing that the search as applied to him, while conducted \nprofessionally by Deputy O'Connell and for legitimate security purposes, was unconstitutional due to the fact that he \nwas in his boxers and the search occurred in the multipurpose room where male officers were present. (OB at 16-42.) \nThis issue was simply not argued or tried to the jury. The as-applied issues tried to the jury were (1) whether Defendant \nO'Connell groped Plaintiff during the search, which would have violated his Fourth Amendment rights and his \nFourteenth Amendment rights against gratuitously wanton harm; and (2) whether the search was conducted for *39 \nreasons other than legitimate security reasons, which would have violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights. The \njury found against Plaintiff on both of these issues, and Plaintiff does not challenge those findings or that verdict. The \njury was not instructed to consider whether the circumstances of the search, otherwise properly and legitimately \nconducted, made it unreasonable. The issue has been waived. O'Guinn v. Lovelock Correctional Center, 502 F.3d \n1056, 1063 n.3 (9th Cir. 2007). \n \nB. The search as applied to Plaintiff was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. \n \nThe search at issue survives the Bell v. Wolfish test in any event.[FN22] \n \nFN22. This assumes, without conceding, that Plaintiff has a Fourth Amendment right in this circumstance. \n \n1. It survives the Bell test. \n \nUnder Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), the Fourth Amendment test of reasonableness balances the need for the \nsearch against the invasion of the inmate's personal rights. Courts consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the \nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. Bell, 441 U.S. \nat 559 (upholding visual body-cavity searches conducted on less than probable cause). \n \n*40 a. The scope was reasonable. \n \nThis case is not about the Sheriffs policy of having all male inmates wear pink boxers, and so Plaintiffs comments \nabout that issue are irrelevant. (OB at 19).[FN23] Nor does this case have anything to do with the fact that the boxers \nhave a hole in front with no button (id.), for Plaintiff never complained that Deputy O'Connell or anyone else saw his \ngenitals or searched them through the hole. The issue is the scope of a female officer pat searching over a male in-\nmate's boxers to ensure there is no contraband taped to the inmate's skin. The officer does not touch the inmate's skin \nthat is unclothed. Nor does the officer touch the inmate's skin underneath the boxers or view the inmate's body un-\nderneath the boxers. \n \nFN23. They are also inaccurate, since the Sheriff testified that the reason for making the boxers pink is to \nprevent them from being stolen from the jail (ER at p. 259:2-13), not to “emasculate” the inmates. (OB at 19.) \n \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 18 \nPlaintiff complains that the scope of the search was unreasonable because it was “highly invasive” (OB at 19-20). He \nsuggests that Plaintiff's genitals were “slowly and methodically touched” by Deputy O'Connell, who made “intimate \ncontact” with his genitals. (Id.) Plaintiff is telling his own story, not the story established by the record as found by the \njury. Deputy O'Connell testified that the entire search took between 10 and 20 seconds. No one testified that Deputy \nO'Connell “used her hand to lift Mr. Byrd's testicles and move *41 them to the side, before using her other hand to \ntouch the skin underneath Mr. Byrd's testicles.” (OB at 19.) This wrongly suggests that Deputy O'Connell took hold of \nPlaintiff's penis and scrotum and lifted them with one hand while searching the perineum with the other hand. Nothing \nof the sort occurred. Deputy O'Connell testified that while she was pat searching over Plaintiff's boxers, the back of her \nflat hand moves the scrotum out of the way so that she can determine if there is any contraband taped to the perineum. \nAt no time did she touch the “skin underneath Mr. Byrd's testicles.” Further, the officer searches the inmate from \nbehind. When Deputy O'Connell pulled out the waistband a couple of inches to check it for contraband, she did not \nlook inside the boxers.[FN24] \n \nFN24. Plaintiff repeatedly throughout the brief complains that all the cadets were wearing identical jeans and \nwhite t-shirts and that the search was unreasonable because he didn't know who they were. (See e.g. OB at 17.) \nNo authority supports the precept that this makes a search unreasonable. Further, he never testified that he \nthought these people were random strangers off the street or otherwise unauthorized to conduct the search. \nIndeed, their names were stenciled on the back of their t-shirts. (ER at p. 610:19-23.) \n \nPlaintiff tries to equate this pat search with a strip search of a completely naked male inmate. (OB at 20.) They are not \nthe same, either in reality, in the Sheriff's Office policies, or in federal case law. Deputy O'Connell did not ever view \nPlaintiff's naked private parts. Her search was a brief, professionally conducted pat search over Plaintiff's boxers. She \ndid not touch his skin, and *42 never cupped her hand, never kneaded, squeezed or did anything except apply light \npressure with a flat hand over the boxers to the thigh, perineum and crack between the buttocks. She never viewed \nPlaintiff's buttocks or genitalia. The fact that Plaintiff was wearing boxers does not turn a decidedly constitutional pat \nsearch into a decidedly unconstitutional strip search. \n \nSheriffs Office policies treat strip searches differently from pat searches as well. A strip search is defined as a visual \nscan of a completely unclothed body, and policy prohibits females from conducting strip searches of male inmates. \nThis recognizes the difference between a female deliberately and carefully viewing a completely naked male inmate's \ngenitalia (and asking him to lift his genitalia so the body underneath it can be viewed) and either only being present at \na strip search, or pat searching areas close to the genitalia over clothes. Federal precedent is fully in accord. Compare \nMoore v. Carwell, 168 F.3d 234, 236-37 (5th Cir. 1999) (male inmate alleging he was subject to multiple strip and \nbody cavity searches by female officer without exigent circumstances stated Fourth Amendment claim), with Mi-\nchenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332-34 (9th Cir. 1988) and Letcher v. Turner, 968 F.2d 508 (5th Cir. 1992) \n(prison officials may conduct strip searches in view of female employees and other inmates) and with *43Grummett v. \nRushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1995) (policy allowing females to conduct pat-down searches including groin area \ndoes not violate inmate's privacy concerns). \n \nSterling v. Cupp, 607 P.2d 206 (Or. App. 1980), which Plaintiff cites (at 20) did not purport to define a federal con-\nstitutional rule equating pat searches over clothed genitalia with strip searches. Had it done so, it would have been \ncontrary to Grummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir. 1995), Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099 (D. Or. \n1983), and Madyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d 954 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 996 (1983). Plaintiff's other cited case, \nJustice v. City of Peachtree City, 961 F.2d 188 (11th Circ. 1992) (OB at 20), upheld a strip search of a female minor by \nfemale officers. It did not involve a cross-gender pat search over clothing. And the case Justice cited for the proposi-\ntion that people have an expectation not to have their private parts “touched,” Doe v. Calumet City, Ill., 754 F. Supp. \n1211, 1214-15 (N.D. III. 1990), struck down a blanket practice where male police officers would conduct cross-gender \nstrip searches without reasonable suspicion or probable cause and where male officers would actually grope and \npenetrate the arrestee's naked body. This is far from analogous to this case.[FN25] \n \nFN25. So, too, Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1525 (9th Cir. 1993) analyzed whether suspicionless \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 19 \ncross-gender searches during which officers “squeezed, rubbed and kneaded” female inmates' clothed bodies \nviolated the Eighth Amendment. It did not address whether true pat searches, conducted properly and for \nlegitimate penological reasons, violate the Fourth Amendment, since the Court found that no Fourth \nAmendment right had been judicially recognized. As such, Plaintiff's recitation of Judge Reinhardt's con-\ncurrence (joined by only one other judge in an en banc Court), is interesting but not controlling. (OB at \n30-31.) \n \n*44 Plaintiff's other cited cases are inapposite as well (OB at 22.) In Edgerly v. City and County of San Francisco, 495 \nF.3d 645, 657 (9th Cir. 2007), the Court simply ruled that a fact question existed on whether the Plaintiff was strip \nsearched based on testimony that the officer “looked inside his boxer shorts.” California law expressly defined a strip \nsearch to include exposure of undergarments or visual inspection of buttocks or genitalia.[FN26] In Sepulveda v. Ra-\nmirez, 967 F.2d 1413 (9th Cir. 1992), the male officer walked into the stall while a female parolee was urinating for a \ndrug sample, and while Plaintiff says that the female was “partially unclothed” (OB at 22), unlike here, it was her \ngenitalia that was exposed to the male officer who simply stood there watching as she finished her task. These cases \nare not analogous or helpful to our analysis. \n \nFN26. This is the reason the California court assumed, in Crowe v. County of San Diego, 359 F. Sup. 2d 994 \n(S.D. Cal. 2005), that an arrestee having to remove his clothes to his underwear was a “strip search.” (See OB \nat 22-23.) The court was not likening an over underwear pat search to a strip search, as Plaintiff suggests. (Id.) \n \nIn short, while a pat search over a male inmate's boxers does, of necessity, require the officer to touch clothed areas \nthat the inmate might find *45 discomforting, nothing about the search exceeds reasonableness in terms of scope. \n \nb. The manner was reasonable. \n \nPlaintiff suggests that the manner of the search was unreasonable because he was searched by a cadet and officers told \nhim to shut up and follow directions. (OB at 18). He cites no authority for the proposition, and there is none. Nor is \nthere any authority for the proposition that the otherwise reasonable search became unreasonable because a person \nwas there with a small hand-held video camera 30 feet away. (Id.) Plaintiff was not even videotaped. There was simply \nnothing unreasonable about the manner of conducting the search. \n \nc. The place was reasonable. \n \nPlaintiff then complains that the otherwise reasonable search was rendered unreasonable because all the inmates were \nsearched in the multipurpose room instead of somewhere “private.” (OB at 23-24.) He cites no case holding so in the \ncircumstance of a pat search. All of his cited cases (OB at p. 24) involved visual strip searches of completely naked \ninmates. See Polk v. Montgomery County, 782 F.2d 1196, 1197 (4th Cir. 1986); Craft v. County of San Bernadino, 468 \nF. Supp. 2d 1172, 1174 (C. D. Cal. 2006) (strip searches conducted in groups); Bacon v. Koldender, 2007 WL \n2669541 (S.D. Cal. 2007) *46 (plaintiff required to remove all clothes and pull penis up, bend over and pull buttocks \napart for inspection in sight of female officers). \n \nThe inmates had to be moved out of their cells for the search because their cells and their clothing were being searched \nat the same time they were. This is so that inmates don't transfer contraband to one another while officers are searching \neach cell. Further, that the inmates in the multipurpose room were told to look straight ahead, and to sit facing the wall \nwhen their search was completed, further demonstrates the reasonableness of the place. If the inmates followed di-\nrections, they would not have seen each other's searches (Plaintiff testified that he looked straight ahead during his \nsearch). \n \nd. The search was justified. \n \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 20 \nAll that needs to be said about this factor is that the jury found the search justified, and Plaintiff has not argued on \nappeal that the evidence was insufficient to support that finding. Indeed, there is more than sufficient evidence in the \nrecord to support it. He cannot attempt to now complain that the search was unjustified. (OB at 25-27.) \n \nThe record also fully supports the conclusion that the cross-gender nature of the search was justified. Both Captain \nPeterson and Deputy O'Connell testified that given the ratio of 10,000 male inmates to 300 or 400 female inmates, \nthere are not enough male officers to conduct only male-on-male pat *47 searches, as often as they must be done for \nsecurity reasons. The reasonable inference is that if a full third of the officer population (which are female) were not \nallowed to conduct pat searches, security at the jail would indeed be compromised.[FN27] \n \nFN27. Plaintiff offers no support, factual or legal, for his assertion that there was “no reason” to have him \nsearched by a female cadet (OB at 29) and that he could have had a male search him with no additional \nburden. (OB at 30.) Further, the jury rejected his contention that the search could have been performed with \n“equal or better quality” by a male officer. (OB at 29, 31 n.25.) There was nothing at all wrong with the \nsearch that Deputy O'Connell conducted, as the jury found. \n \nFinally, contrary to Plaintiff's assertion (OB at 26-27) the record does not need to demonstrate that allowing female \nofficers to conduct all the requirements of the deputy's job, including pat searches, is important in avoiding sexual \ndiscrimination. Federal case authority supports the proposition. Bagley v. Watson, 579 F. Supp. 1099 (D. Or. 1983); \nMadyun v. Franzen, 704 F.2d 954, 962-63 (7th Cir. 1983); Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093, 1100 (8th Cir. 1990).[FN28] \n \nFN28. Plaintiff argues that no one testified that female officers' employment opportunities were hampered as \na result of refusing to pat search a male inmate. (OB at 27.) This is because females are allowed to pat search \nmale inmates, and there was no evidence that any female officer has refused. Indeed, had the policy prohi-\nbited female officers from pat searching male inmates, the record might well have shown that female officers' \nemployment opportunities suffered for it. \n \n*48 In short, the search as applied to Plaintiff was not unreasonable under the Bell v. Wolfish test. The scope, the \nmnner, the place, and the justification for the search were all reasonable, especially given the great deference the Court \ngives to prison administrators to do their jobs. Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 85 (1987): \nRunning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, planning, and the commitment of \nresources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government. \nPrison administration is, moreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility of those branches, and sepa-\nration of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial restraint. Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts \nhave, as we indicated in Martinez, additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate prison authorities. \n \nSee also Peckham v. Wisconsin Dept. of Corrections, 141 F.3d 694 (7th Cir. 1998) (“given the considerable deference \nprison officials enjoy to run their institutions it is difficult to conjure up too many real-life scenarios where prison strip \nsearches of inmates could be said to be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.”). \n \nC. The search did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nPlaintiff argues that the search as applied to him violated his right, as a detainee, to be free from punishment prior to an \nadjudication of guilt. (OB at 38.) The district court ruled that Plaintiff had waived this argument below by *49 not \nraising it before trial (ER at pp. 423:1-424:11) and thus he cannot raise it here for the first time. Indeed, the only \nas-applied Fourteenth Amendment issue that was tried was whether Deputy O'Connell groped Plaintiff and thereby \nwantonly inflicted pain on him. (ER at 80). Whether the search was conducted for purposes of punishment before \nadjudication was never tried, instructed, or argued. He cannot make an as-applied argument of punishment under the \nFourteenth Amendment for the first time on appeal. O'Guinn v. Lovelock Correctional Center, 502 F.3d 1056, 1063 \nn.3 (9th Cir. 2007). \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 21 \n \nIn any event, there is no evidence of “deliberate indifference” here, where Plaintiff gave Defendants no reason at all to \nbelieve that he had a “history of sexual abuse” (OB at 40, n.31) and Defendants deliberately disregarded that in sub-\njecting him to the cross-gender pat search. (Id. at 41.) \n \nIV. THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN GIVING AN ADVERSE INFE-\nRENCE INSTRUCTION \n \nA. Standard of Review \n \nEvidentiary rulings at trial are reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Merino-Balderrama, 146 F.3d \n758, 761 (9th Cir. 1998). Such rulings will be reversed only if the error more likely than not affected the verdict. See \nUnited States v. Pang, 362 F.3d 1187, 1192 (9th Cir.2004). \n \n*50 B. The record shows no abuse of discretion. \n \nPlaintiff accuses Defendants, as he did below, of failing “to preserve critical evidence” because he saw a person \nholding a small video camera at the time of the search. (OB at 47-48.) The record is uncontroverted that no one \nmentioned anything about this hand held video camera until a couple of days before trial. (OB at 48; ER at pp. \n407:6-409:4, 468:13-470:7.)[FN29] Thus, the record demonstrates that the person holding the camera was affiliated, if at \nall, with the training academy, not with the jail, and was taping “snippets” of the cadet class's training as a memento. \n(Id.) The cameraman, whoever it was, was not a witness at trial, and obviously, no one else had the foundation to \ntestify as to what footage was taped the day of the search. What is known is that neither Mr. Byrd nor his search \nappears on the memento tape.[FN30] By the time the parties found out that there was a video camera at the search, and \nthe tape was requested, the County's retention policy (two years) had already mandated its destruction. (Id.) Plaintiff \nargued that the County should have preserved the tape as soon as he filed his first grievance, but the County does *51 \nnot preserve evidence just because an inmate has filed a grievance. (ER at pp. 410:5-411:24.) \n \nFN29. When Plaintiff filed his complaint, pro se, a routine request for the preservation of evidence was made \nto the facility. The response came back that there was no video surveillance. (Id.) \n \nFN30. The record is not “uncontroverted” that the video camera filmed Plaintiff, as he claims. (OB at 48.) \nPlaintiff testified only that he saw the camera there during the search (ER at p. 602:15-25), and that the \ncamera man was 30 feet away from him. (ER at p. 605:5-21.) \n \nThe court indicated that the video excerpts were consistent with the idea that not everything was taped, and also with \nthe possibility that everything was taped and edited. (ER at pp. 475:18-476:3.) Ultimately, because the trial court \nbelieved the issue turned on debated facts, it was persuaded to give a general “adverse inference” instruction and \nallowed the parties to argue whether it was applicable. (ER at pp. 411:25-414:3; 83, 134.) Indeed, Plaintiff's counsel \nextensively argued the adverse inference to the jury. (ER at pp. 150:15-152:25.) The jurors simply did not believe his \nstory. \n \nPlaintiff does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion in giving him the adverse inference. He apparently \nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his proposed adverse inference instruction. (OB at 51.) No \nabuse appears in the record. Plaintiffs proposed instruction was inaccurate. (See ER at p. 27.) It stated that Plaintiff \nfiled a “complaint” on the date of the search (he didn't; he filed a grievance). It stated that the County “erased” the tape, \nbut there was no evidence of this. It intimated that the entire search was taped, for which there was no evidence. It \nstated that the taped showed that the search was done solely for training purposes and that Deputy O'Connell groped \nPlaintiff and inserted her finger into his anus. But even Plaintiff denied that *52 Deputy O'Connell penetrated his anus. \n(ER at p. 595:3-5.) The trial court certainly did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Plaintiff's offered instruction. \n\n2008 WL 1723061 (C.A.9)   Page 22 \n \nPlaintiff then asserts that the County's document retention policy is “illegal.” (OB at 47, 50.) This lawsuit is not about \nthe County's document retention policy; the issue here is not whether it is “illegal,” and in any event, Plaintiff never \nargued that it was below.[FN31] The issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in giving the jury the adverse \ninference instruction it did. As is noted above, nothing in the record shows such an abuse. \n \nFN31. The retention policy is not “illegal” in any event. Plaintiff accuses the County of not placing a litiga-\ntion hold on its document retention policy when this lawsuit was filed. (OB at 51.) The record is to the con-\ntrary. Defendants' trial counsel informed the court that when Plaintiff filed his lawsuit, the County put in a \nstandard evidence hold to the jail, which asks for all videotapes, etc. The jail responded that there was no \nsurveillance tape, which is true. The first Defendants' counsel even heard of a hand-held video camera was a \nfew days before trial, from Plaintiff's counsel who heard it from Plaintiff. By that time, much more than two \nyears had passed and any video that might have been taken would have been destroyed in accordance with the \nCounty's policy. (ER at pp. 407:6-409:4. See also ER at p. 469:1-470:21.) \n \nFinally, Plaintiff suggests that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence the Video Yearbook snippet \nthat showed the search being conducted. (OB at 52-55.) Yet as the district court ruled, Plaintiff's counsel himself \nopened the door to showing the video tape by asking Sheriff Arpaio if he “ever reviewed the video tape that was made \nof this search” and whether “the videotape has been erased.” (ER at pp. 250:4-6, 251:3-18, 253:2-16.) At *53 the time \nthe district court ruled that Plaintiff had opened the door to having the video played, Plaintiff did not make an objec-\ntion to that ruling. Plaintiff never objected that the footage would prejudice and mislead the jurors by “depicting the \ncadets in a fond and tender light.” (OB at 53.) \n \nFurther, while Plaintiff now complains about the footage showing the cadets practicing searches on fully clothed \nsupervisors (OB at 54), it was Plaintiff's counsel who showed that video during his closing, and used it to argue that the \nsearch was conducted as a training exercise. (ER at 143:20- 145:21.) Plaintiff has not shown any abuse of discretion in \nadmitting the video snippets under these circumstances. \n \nEven if admitting the video was error, which it was not, it was harmless. M2 Software, Inc. v. Madacy Entertainment, \n421 F.3d 1073, 1087 (9th Cir. 2005) (Prejudice must be shown in evidentiary ruling to warrant reversal). Plaintiff \ncannot demonstrate that the video was so prejudicial as to deny him a fair trial, or that the jury would have found in his \nfavor had the video not been played. \n \n*54CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendants respectfully request the Court to affirm the judgment in their favor. \n \nCharles Edward BYRD, Plaintiff/Appellant, v.

The County's Bait-and-Switch Technique \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 4 \n \nIn its Answering Brief, Maricopa County (the “County”) has attempted to win this appeal by pretending that this case \nis about routine pat-down searches. It has pretended that Mr. Byrd is challenging the County's practice and policy of \nsubjecting detainees and inmates to fully-clothed, cross-gender, pat-down searches by officers in uniform. Unfortu-\nnately for the County, pretending that something is the case does not make it so. \n \nThis case is about the October 28, 2004 search of Charles Byrd (“Mr. Byrd”), in which Mr. Byrd was (i) stripped down \nto his pink underwear; (ii) approached by a female in civilian clothing (who was not even an officer at the time) \nwearing blue jeans, a white t-shirt and no name badge indicating she was not an average civilian; and (iii) subjected to \na search in which the female cadet made intimate contact, through Mr. Byrd's underwear, with Mr. Byrd's testicles, \nperineum and inner crack of his buttocks - all while numerous male officers in uniform were standing just 10 feet away \nand perfectly available to conduct the search. Indeed, this case is about the County's established practice and policy of \nconducting en masse searches at the Durango Jail (whenever a specific security threat arises) in which male detainees \nare stripped down to their underwear and intimately touched (through their underwear) on their genitalia by female \ncadets, while male officers are present and available to conduct the searches. \n \nIn an obvious attempt to distort the issue on appeal, the County argues that the cross-gender nature of the search of Mr. \nByrd was necessary to advance jail security and the equal employment rights of the female guards because “searches” \nare performed with astonishing frequency. In the words of the County, \n \nContraband is a constant problem. To maintain a handle on this problem, searches are conducted every time inmates \nleave their cells, every time they leave their housing unit, and every time they go to or return from visitation, medical, \ncourt, activities, or other programs. In fact, inmates are searched at least once daily, and more often several times \ndaily. All of these searches are pat searches, except for those conducted after the inmate returning from a contact visit \nor from outside the facility, which are strip searches. In additional, pat searches of the inmates and searches of their \ncells are conducted any time the facility obtains information of something going on, such as reports of contraband, \nincreased fighting, etc. There are simply not enough male officers at the facility to conduct all of these searches on the \nmale inmates without the help of the female officers[.] \n \n(Ans. Br. 23-24 (emphasis added); see also id. at 9-10 (same argument).) Thus, the County's argument is simple: “pat \nsearches” are performed with extraordinary frequency i.e generally several times per day on each and every detainee; \ntherefore, female officers must perform some of these searches, since there are simply not enough male officers to \nperform all of them. \n \nThis would be a good argument if Mr. Byrd were in fact challenging the fully-clothed, pat-down searches that are \nperformed “several times daily” on each and every detainee.[FN1] But Mr. Byrd is not challenging those searches. As \nthe proceedings below and Mr. Byrd's Opening Brief make abundantly clear, Mr. Byrd is challenging the constitu-\ntionality of the en masse underwear searches conducted by cadets in civilian clothing - and only those searches. Those \nsearches are not performed several times daily. The Executive Officer of the Durango Jail, Lieutenant Scott Frye, \nswore under penalty of perjury that these searches are performed “about four times a month.” (See Frye Affidavit, \nEOR 793;see also Op. Br. 29 n.23.)[FN2] Lieutenant Frye also swore under penalty of perjury that: \n \nFN1. Nor is Mr. Byrd challenging the County's practice of “strip” searches, which are performed when a \ndetainee returns from a contact visit or from outside the facility (Ans. Br. 23), since those searches are per-\nformed by officers of the same gender as the detainee. (EOR 858.) \n \nFN2. See also Peterson, EOR 319:9-13 (stating that the detainees are only stripped down to their underwear \nduring these “group search[es],” since in all other situations the detainees “are required to be fully clothed \nwhen they depart their cell”); Byrd, EOR 600:1-8 (the October 28, 2004 incident was the first time Mr. Byrd \nhad been forced to strip down to his underwear in front of a woman). \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 5 \n \nThe searches are always performed as follows: The inmates are stripped down to their boxers by the Special Response \nTeam (SRT) in their POD and then SRT brings them to the Day Room. The Academy class lines up and pat searches \neach inmate. \n \nId.(emphasis added); see also O'Connell, EOR 696:23-697:2 (explaining that all 90 detainees were searched by cadets, \nrather than officers, on October 28, 2004); Peterson, EOR 319 (explaining that unless an en masse underwear search is \nbeing performed or some rare exception applies, all detainees “are required to be fully clothed when they depart their \ncell”).) Lieutenant Frye further explained that these searches are only performed “when there is sufficient staff \navailable to search the inmates in the Day Rooms and to search the Pod and all the cells. Sufficient staff includes \nMCSO Academy students.” (Id.)[FN3] \n \nFN3. See also County's Motion for reconsideration of summary judgment order, EOR 800 (explaining that \nthese en masse searches are “a burden on the staffing and the officers” because “[t]here needs to be adequate \nstaffing, i.e., a large number of officers” for these searches to be conducted). \n \nIt is therefore clear that the en masse searches at issue in this case, although an established and documented practice, \nare conducted relatively infrequently and only when additional staff members, including cadets from the academy, are \npresent.[FN4] As Lieutenant Frye stated under oath, these searches are “always” performed by the academy class. See \nsupra. \n \nFN4. The record reveals that unlike the routine fully-clothed pat-down searches that are conducted whenever \nthe detainees leave their cell or do virtually anything, these en masse underwear searches by cadets are only \nperformed when the jail authorities receive specific intelligence information about contraband or fights. \n(Peterson, EOR 349: 15-351:3; O'onnell, EOR 640:17-20; Arpaio, EOR 258:4-12; Frye Affidavit, EOR 793.) \n \nMr. Byrd demonstrated in his Opening Brief that there were numerous male officers in uniform standing just 10 feet \naway during his search, yet Mr. Byrd was searched by a female student who was wearing blue jeans and a t-shirt. (Op. \nBr. 11; O'Connell, EOR 277:12-16; 695:8-18.) The male uniformed officers simply stood there watching, and were \nperfectly available to conduct the search. (Id, EOR 695:8-18.) Importantly, the County does not even attempt to refute \nthat there were numerous male officers in uniform perfectly available to conduct the search. (See Ans. Br.) Nor does \nthe County attempt to explain why female students conduct these searches when male uniformed officers are present \nand perfectly available. Clearly unable and unwilling to defend this practice, the County instead performs a subtle (yet \ncritical) sleight-of-hand, and argues that female officers “must” be permitted to perform some of the “pat-down” \nsearches that are conducted “several times daily” on each and every detainee, since these searches occur virtually all \nday, every day. (Ans. Br. 9-10; 23-24.) \n \nThe Court should not be fooled by the County's sleight-of-hand. Those “several times daily” searches are not what this \ncase is about. This case is about the en masse underwear searches that are conducted approximately four times per \nmonth. As Mr. Byrd showed in his Opening Brief, there is absolutely no reason for these searches to be conducted by \nfemale students in jeans and t-shirts, when numerous male officers in uniform are available and standing just 10 feet \naway. (Op. Br. 29-30.) Rather than attempting to address this dispositive issue, the County resorts to the sweeping \nsleight-of-hand technique outlined above. The Court should reject this transparent ploy. What is apparent from the \nOpening Brief (and from the Answering Briefs utter silence on the issue) is that the manner in which Mr. Byrd was \nsearched (i.e., by a female student in civilian clothing, when male uniformed officers were present and available) was \nutterly unrelated to the jail's stated goal of ensuring security within the Durango Jail. See Turner v. Safely, 482 U.S. 78, \n89 (1987). \n \nAccordingly, the manner in which Mr. Byrd was searched on October 28, 2004 (and the manner in which the en masse \nunderwear searches are performed in the Durango Jail) fails to meet the requirements of our Constitution. \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 6 \n \nII. The County's Use Of A Deceptive Label \n \nA related ploy advanced by the Answering Brief is the County's decision to continually refer to the search at issue as a \n“pat-down” or “frisk” search. (See, e.g., Ans. Br. 9,21, 23, 29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 41,46, 47.) Apparently the County \nbelieves that if it continually refers to the search technique at issue as a “pat-down” search, nobody will notice that the \nsearch at issue was not a “pat-down.” Unfortunately for the County, giving the same label to two fundamentally dif-\nferent search techniques does not make their differences disappear. This Court rejected a similarly transparent ploy in \nJordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521,1522 n.1 (9th Cir. 1993) (rejecting the prison's technique of “euphemistically \nrefer[ing] to these searches as ‘pat-down” searches”).[FN5] Notwithstanding that Mr. Byrd expressly made this point in \nhis Opening Brief (see Op. Br. 21-22), the County completely ignores the point and, instead, continues to parrot its \ntired euphemism. \n \nFN5. Unlike our case, the searches in Jordan were performed on fully-clothed inmates, did not involve in-\ntimate contact with the inmates' genitalia and inner buttocks cheeks, and were conducted by real officers in \nuniform, rather than students in street clothes. \n \nIII. Other Glaring Errors in the Answering Brief \n \nIn addition to the misleading techniques discussed above, the County's Answering Brief is replete with incorrect \nstatements of law, confused legal arguments, misrepresentations of the jury's findings, and mischaracterizations of the \narguments made in Mr. Byrd's Opening Brief. Some of the most obvious examples include the following: \n \n1. The County contends that the only issue properly on appeal is whether a “general policy that allows cross-gender pat \nsearches (female on male)” is constitutional. (Ans. Br. 18, 21.) The County argues that this is the only issue properly \non appeal because it is “the only issue the court found not frivolous for appeal, and on which counsel was appointed for \nappeal...Because counsel was not appointed on any other issue, the Court should decline to consider any other issue. \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3).” (Ans. Br. 21; see also ii 27.) \n \nThe County misunderstands black letter law. A district court's certification of an appeal as “frivolous” pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §1915(a)(3) determines whether the appellant is entitled to in forma pauperis status on appeal; the certification \ndoes not determine what issues may be appealed. See 28 .U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3). Said differently, Section 1915(a)(3) \ndoes not prevent a party from advancing an appeal that is deemed frivolous; it merely prevents the party from ad-\nvancing such an appeal with the government's resources (i.e., iforma pauperis). The County's argument to the contrary \nreflects a deep confusion (over a rather simple issue). \n \nMoreover, the County misstates the record in stating that this single issue is “the only issue ... on which counsel was \nappointed for appeal.” (Ans. Br. 21; see also id at 4.) Counsel for Mr. Byrd (Jarrett A. Green) took on this case pro \nbono under his own volition. He was not “appointed” by the Court, much less “appointed” to appeal a single issue. \n(See Docket Entry 11, Notice of Appearance of Jarrett A. Green, filed 103/2007.)[FN6] \n \nFN6. In any event, had Mr. Byrd not obtained pro bono counsel, his entire appeal would have been entitled to \ninforma pauperis status, since the District Court certified one of his claims as non-frivolous, and this Court \nhas expressly held that so long as the district court certifies that one issue is non-frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(a)(3), then the entire appeal must be permitted to proceed on an in forma pauperis basis. See Hooker v. \nAm. Airlines, 302 F.3d 1091,1092 (9th Cir. 2002). \n \n2. In a related vein, the County argues that Mr. Byrd “waived”' certain of the claims he advances on appeal because the \nclaims were not handed to or resolved by the jury.[FN7] The County is again confused. Whether a claim is “waived” \ndoes not turn on whether it was specifically anded to the jury for resolution. Indeed, Mr. Byrd is challenging the \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 7 \nconstitutional ruling made by the District Court before any claims were submitted to the jury. It is again elementary \nlaw that a claim is preserved for appeal - and not waived - so long as the claim was “raised sufficiently for the trial \ncourt to rule on it.” Cornhusker Cas. Ins. Co. v. Kachman, 514 F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Menken v. Emm, \n503 F.3d 1050, 1058 n.4 (9th Cir. 2007) (same). \n \nFN7. See, e.g., Ans. Br. 39 (arguing that Mr. Byrd waived the claim that the search was unconstitutional as \napplied to him because the “jury was not instructed to consider” this issue); id. at 19 (similar argument). \n \nIt is simply beyond dispute that Mr. Byrd (overtly) raised before the District Court each of the three constitutional \nchallenges that he now asserts on appeal. (See EOR, Tab 6 (District Court dismisses Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim \nfor failure to state claim, and acknowledges Mr. Byrd's claims under the Fourth Amendment); EOR 736:12-737:17 \n(District Court acknowledges Mr. Byrd's substantive due process claim); EOR 355:21-406:13 (oral argument by both \nparties on whether the search violated Mr. Byrd's Fourth Amendment or substantive due process rights, and subse-\nquent ruling by the District Court).) \n \n3. The County misrepresents and exaggerates the findings of the jury. The jury was given three very limited questions \nto answer: (1) whether Cadet O'Connell intentionally squeezed or kneaded Mr. Byrd's penis during the search; (2) \nwhether Cadet O'Connell inflicted wanton pain on Mr. Byrd by intentionally squeezing or kneading his penis or \nscrotum or improperly touching his anus during the search; and (3) whether the October 28, 2004 search was per-\nformed without an identified security need. (See Verdict, EOR Tab 9; Jury Instructions, EOR Tab 10.) These were the \nonly questions given to the jury, and the only questions resolved by the jury. Nonetheless, the County represents to this \nCourt that the jury made additional findings. An emblematic but particularly troubling instance is when the County \nunequivocally states that the jury rejected [Mr. Byrd's] contention that the search could have been performed with \n‘equal or better quality by a male officer.” (Ans. Br. 47 n.27.) The jury made no such finding. (Unsurprisingly, the \nCounty fails to provide a citation to the record after making this representation.) This type of gross misrepresentation \nof the record is disturbing. \n \nThe County also misrepresents the record on whether Mr. Byrd was videotaped when it says “Plaintiff was not even \nvideotaped.” (Ans. Br. 45; 50 n.30.) But it is clear from the transcript that Mr. Byrd was testifying that he was vi-\ndeotaped while being searched, and not merely that men with cameras took snippets when he was not being searched. \n(EOR 602:17-25.) Neither Cadet O'Connell nor any other witness rebutted Mr. Byrd's testimony that he was taped. \n(Even the Answering Brief does not assert that anyone disagreed with Mr. Byrd's testimony.) Notwithstanding that Mr. \nByrd's testimony that he was videotaped is uncontroverted, the County boldly represents to this Court that he was not \nvideotaped. \n \n4. Notwithstanding its own blatant misrepresentations, the County goes on the offensive and accuses Mr. Byrd of \n“telling his own story [regarding the scope of the search], not the story established by the record as found by the jury.” \n(Ans. Br. 40.) This accusation is, itself, yet another misrepresentation on the part of the County. A review of Mr. \nByrd's Opening Brief and the record in this case demonstrates that Mr. Byrd represented the record with impeccable \naccuracy. For example, the County accuses Mr. Byrd of suggesting that Cadet O'Connell touched Mr. Byrd's penis or \ntouched Mr. Byrd underneath his underwear, rather than through it. (Ans. Br. 40-41.) But the Opening Brief never \nstates that Mr. Byrd's penis was touched (rather, it was Mr. Byrd's testicles, perineum and inner buttocks cheeks that \nwere touched), and unambiguously states that “all of the contact Cadet O'Connell made with Mr. Byrd's genital region \nwas through his underwear, rather than underneath it.” (Op. Br. 10 n.11.) Leveling wild accusations does nothing for \nthe County. \n \n5. The standard of review that the County recites and repeatedly applies throughout the Answering Brief is a red \nherring and inapplicable to the gravamen of this appeal. At the commencement of its “Statement of Relevant Facts,” \nthe County states that “[t]he following facts are stated in a light most favorable to upholding the jury's verdict.” (Ans. \nBr. 8). The County proceeds to interpret all disputed facts that arose during the trial in the County's favor, including the \nfacts relating to the manner in which Mr. Byrd was searched on October 28, 2004. (See, e.g., Ans. Br. 8-17.) But Mr. \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 8 \nByrd did not appeal any of the three specific findings of the jury. He is not challenging the jury verdict or arguing that \nit lacked evidentiary support. Instead, he is appealing the ruling made by the District Court, pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 50, at the close of all evidence before the three questions were given to the jury. \n \nIn reviewing a Rule 50 ruling, this Court “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party \nand draw every reasonable inference therefrom in the non-moving party's favor.” Howard v. Everex Sys. Inc., 228 F.3d \n1057, 1060 (9th Cir. 2000); see also Amarel v. Connell, 102 F.3d 1494, 1521 (9th Cir. 1996) (same); Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250-51 (1986) (standard on a Rule 50 motion is equivalent to standard on a motion \nfor summary judgment). Therefore, although this Court must assume the truth of the three specific factual findings \nmade by the jury (as Mr. Byrd acknowledges in his Opening Brief), all other factual discrepancies must be resolved \nand all other inferences must be drawn in Mr. Byrd's favor in assessing the constitutionality of the search, since Mr. \nByrd was the non-moving party with respect to the District Court's Rule 50 order.[FN8] \n \nFN8. For example, had Cadet O'Connell testified that Mr. Byrd was not taped (which she did not), the District \nCourt nonetheless would have been required to assume for purposes of its Rule 50 order that Mr. Byrd was \ntaped, since there would have been a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue. Also, since Mr. Byrd \ntestified that the search lasted approximately 60 seconds, while O'Connell testified that it lasted approx-\nimately 10 to 20 seconds (Ans. Br. 14), the District Court was required to assume it lasted 60 seconds. (It is \nworth noting that even if the search lasted 20 seconds, having a stranger feel around one's genitalia and \nbuttocks for 20 seconds is not a short time.) \n \n13ARGUMENT \n \nI. THE SEARCH OF MR. BYRD WAS UNREASONABLE UNDER THE FOURTH AMENDMENT \n \nIt is clear that the search technique challenged by Mr. Byrd, although an established and documented practice, is rather \ninfrequently performed and drastically different in nature from the routine, fully-clothed “pat-down” searches that are \nperformed “several times daily” on each and every detainee. (See supra.) \n \nDespite the obvious difference between the two search techniques, the County has deliberately conflated the two \ntechniques, in a transparent ploy to defend the constitutionality of the technique that Mr. Byrd is in fact challenging. \nThe County's ploy is hardly difficult to decipher: If the County successfully creates the impression that the search of \nMr. Byrd was akin to a routine “pat-down” search, then Mr. Byrd's challenge would be foreclosed by Grummett v. \nRushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th Cir. 1985) (upholding “routine” pat-down searches in which the inmates are “fully \nclothed, and thus do not involve intimate contact with the inmates' bodies”). Of course, the search of Mr. Byrd was not \na routine pat- down and was not performed when he was “fully clothed,” and it clearly involved *14 “intimate contact \nwith his body” (Mr. Byrd was touched on his testicles, perineum and inner cheeks of his buttocks).[FN9] \n \nFN9. Just as it is invasive and humiliating to be stripped naked and visually searched, it is invasive and \nhumiliating to be stripped to one's thin underwear and manually searched on one's testicles, perineum and \ninner buttocks cheeks. That the County pretends that the search of Mr. Byrd is a routine “pat-down” search is \ninane, at best. \n \nMoreover, the County clearly believes that if it can convince the Court that the type of search performed on Mr. Byrd \nis performed “several times daily” on each and every detainee, then the County will prevail in demonstrating that the \nmanner in which Mr. Byrd was searched is “reasonably related” to the jail's interests in security and employment \nequality. (Since jail security and the employment opportunities of female officers would be impaired if female officers \nwere prohibited from performing searches that occur virtually all day, every day.) The Court should reject the \nCounty's obvious ploy. \n \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 9 \nA. The Search Of Mr. Byrd Is Unconstitutional Under The Turner Test \n \nMr. Byrd agrees that the jail's interests in security and employment equality for female officers would be impaired if \nfemale officers were prohibited from conducting the routine, fully-clothed “pat-down that are performed “several \ntimes daily” on each and every detainee. (Indeed, Mr. Byrd has never complained about those searches, nor has he \nmentioned them during the course of *15 this lawsuit.) Requiring men to perform all of those searches could impair \nsecurity (since there are simply not enough male officers to perform all of those searches) and the employment rights \nof the female officers (since if female officers were prohibited from performing this core responsibility, they might be \nde facto prevented from serving as detention officers). However, these governmental interests simply would not be \nimpaired if the infrequent en masse underwear searches were conducted by the male officers in uniform who are \npresent, rather than the female students in civilian clothing. Mr. Byrd thoroughly developed this critical argument in \nhis Opening Brief. (Op. Br. 29-38.) \n \nThe jail's interest in security could not conceivably have been hampered had Mr. Byrd been searched by one of the \nmany (i) male (ii) officers (iii) in uniform who were present and readily available, rather than a (i) female (ii) student \n(iii) in blue jeans and a t-shirt. (Op. Br. 29.) Indeed, if anything, an actual officer would conduct the search with equal, \nif not better, quality than would a student in training to become an officer. \n \nMoreover, it is clear that the jail's interest in protecting the employment rights of women would not be hampered by \nrequiring that male officers in uniform who are standing 10 feet away step up and perform the search of male detainees \nwho have been stripped down to their pink underwear. Because these en masse searches are performed infrequently \nand only when a large amount of staff, *16 including the cadets from the Academy, are available, it would hardly \namount to a deprivation of employment rights for female students to remain present but refrain from actually con-\nducting these intrusive and infrequent searches.[FN10] Just as the jail's interest in employment equality for women is not \nimpaired by the County's current policy of prohibiting women from conducting strip searches of men, the jail's interest \nin employment equality for women would not be impaired if the en masse underwear genitalia searches were con-\nducted by male officers, rather than female students.[FN11] \n \nFN10. It is worth noting that the jail's asserted interest in employment equality for female officers is arguably \nnot even triggered by the issue before the Court because these en masse underwear searches (and the October \n28, 2004 search of Mr. Byrd) are “always” performed by students in training to become officers - and not \nfemale officers themselves. (See Frye Affidavit, EOR 793; see also O'Connell, EOR 696:23-697:2.) \n \nFN11. The County's written policy requires that male detainees be strip searched by male officers. (Policy \nDH-3, EOR 858.) Since the employment rights of female officers are not impaired by preventing them from \nconducting strip searches of male detainees, there is no reason why these employment rights would be im-\npaired by preventing female students from conducting the less frequent, en masse underwear searches. \nMoreover, it makes no sense why the County would prohibit female officers from viewing male detainees \nnaked, yet permit female students to view male detainees in their underwear while intimately touching their \ntesticles, perinea and inner buttocks cheeks. \n \nThe search of Mr. Byrd (and the related practice) is therefore the inverse of the searches at issue in Grummett v. Ru-\nshen, 779 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1985), and Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328 (9th Cir. 1988). In both Grummett and \n*17 Michenfelder, this Court held that if the prison ceased the search or surveillance practices at issue, the prison's \ninterests would have been impaired. (Op. Br. 32-37 (demonstrating that the facts and reasoning of Grummett and \nMichenfelder compel the opposite result in this case).) \n \nThe County's Answering Brief completely fails to rebut the showing made by Mr. Byrd's Opening Brief. By pre-\ntending that this case is about routine fully-clothed pat-down searches, the entire analysis and argumentation provided \nby the County is inapplicable.[FN12] \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 10 \n \nFN12. The County's continual citation, throughout the Answering Brief, to cases involving routine, ful-\nly-clothed pat down searches is an imprudent use of ink, since Mr. Byrd is not challenging such searches. \nParadigmatic of its reliance on inapposite authority, the County cites Timm v. Gunter, 917 F.2d 1093 (8th Cir. \n1990), on four different occasions from pages 35-38 of the Answering Brief. Not only did Timm involve \nfully-clothed searches, but the Eight Circuit emphasized that the female officers “stated that they have never \nintentionally touched an inmate's genital or anal areas” during the clothed searches and that the plaintiff \nhimself “testified that he never had experienced being touched in those areas by a female guard.” Id, 917 F.2d \nat 1100. In fact, none of the “pat-search” cases cited by the County involves detainees (i) being stripped to \ntheir underwear and (ii) intimately touched on their testicles, perinea and inner buttocks cheeks by (iii) stu-\ndents in street clothes, rather than real officers. The County's authority is simply not relevant to our case. \n \nAs shown in footnote 25 of the Opening Brief, each of the four Turner factors strongly supports the conclusion that no \n“reasonable relation” exists between the search practice that Mr. Byrd is actually challenging and the County's as-\nserted interests. (Op. Br. 31 n.25.) Also instructive is the Turner analysis found *18 in Judge Reinhardt's concurring \nopinion in Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521,1537 (9th Cir. 1993). (Op. Br. 30-31 (quoting and applying Judge \nReinhardt's reasoning).)[FN13] The manner in which Mr. Byrd was searched (and the underlying practice of en masse \nunderwear searches by female cadets) is unconstitutional because it is not “reasonably related” to the County's as-\nserted interests in security and employment equality. \n \nFN13. Although seeking to marginalize Judge Reinhardt's analysis by noting that Reinhardt was “joined by \nonly one other judge in an en bane Court” (Ans. Br. 44 n.25), the County conveniently fails to mention that \nthe en banc opinion, although not reaching the Fourth Amendment issue, emphasized that “Judge Reinhardt's \nconcurring opinion ably articulates the Forth Amendment analysis developed by Bell v. Wolfish and Turner v. \nSafley.” Id., 986, F.2d at 1524 (citations omitted). \n \nB. The Search Of Mr. Byrd Is Unconstitutional Under The Bell Test And Well-Established Fourth Amend-\nment Principles \n \nThe Opening Brief demonstrated that the search of Mr. Byrd was unreasonable under the four-factor test of Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 559 (1979). (Op. Br. 16-28.) In applying the Bell test, Mr. Byrd identified each of the many \nfacts and circumstances that contribute to an overall finding of unreasonableness. (Op. Br. 16-28.) \n \nIn response, the County commits the fatal flaws of: (i) arguing that certain circumstances of the search are irrelevant to \nthe Fourth Amendment analysis; and (ii) analyzing each of the circumstances of the search (that the County deems *19 \nrelevant) in isolation, rather than in their totality. The Answering Brief assumes the constitutionality of the search and \nthen addresses each aggravating circumstance (that it chooses to discuss) separately and concludes that each indi-\nvidual circumstance, in isolation, does not convert an “otherwise constitutional search” into an unconstitutional search. \nFor example, the County argues: \n• “[T]he fact that Plaintiff was wearing boxers does not turn a decidedly constitutional pat search into a decidedly \nunconstitutional strip search.” (Ans. Br. 42.) \n• “This case is not about the Sheriffs policy of having all male inmates wear pink boxers, and so [Mr. Byrd's] com-\nments about that issue are irrelevant.” (Ans. Br. 40.) \n• “Nor is there any authority for the proposition that the otherwise reasonable search became unreasonable because a \nperson was there with a small hand-held video camera 30 feet away.” (Ans. Br. 45.) \n• “[Mr. Byrd] cites no authority for the proposition” that being yelled to shut the fuck up renders a search unreasonable. \n(Ans. Br. 45.) \n• “Nor does this case have anything to do with the fact that the boxers have a hole in front with no button.” (Ans. Br. \n40.) \n• “Mr. Byrd] then complains that the otherwise reasonable search was rendered unreasonable because all the inmates \nwere searched in the multipurpose room instead of somewhere ‘private.” (Ans. Br. 45.) \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 11 \n \nThe County's method of isolating each individual circumstance and then labeling it irrelevant or analyzing it sepa-\nrately from all of the other circumstances is plainly inconsistent with the “totality of the circumstances” approach that \nmust *20 be applied when analyzing whether a search is “unreasonable” under the Fourth Amendment.[FN14] \n \nFN14. See U.S. v. Kriesel, 508 F.3d 941,947 (9th Cir 2007) (“we reaffirm that the touchstone of the Fourth \nAmendment is reasonableness and adopt the general Fourth Amendment approach, which examines the to-\ntality of the circumstances to determine whether a search is reasonable.”) (internal citations omitted); Ohio v. \nRobinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39 (1996) (explaining that reasonableness turns on the “totality of the circumstances” \nand is a highly “fact-specific” inquiry); Samson v. California, 547 U.S. 843, 848 (2006) (same); Sherman v. \nU.S.P.C., 502 F.3d 869, 883 (9th Cir 2007) (same); U.S. v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273-74 (2002) (rejecting the \n“divide-and-conquer” method of analyzing each circumstance in isolation). \n \nThe County completely deviates from the “totality of circumstances” approach mandated by this Court and the Su-\npreme Court, and instead advances its own “divide-and-conquer” approach-by analyzing each of the aggravating \ncircumstances (that it chooses to address) in isolation. What is more, the County engages in a “ddivide-and-ignore” \napproach, by discarding as “irrelevant” certain circumstances that undoubtedly contributed to the unreasonableness of \nthe search. That the County believes that it is “irrelevant” that Mr. Byrd's underwear was pink or had an open slit in \nfront of the genitalia is not only a clear departure from the “totality of the circumstances” approach, but it is a clear \nexpression of naivete (as these circumstances would undoubtedly exacerbate the humiliation of such a search). Nor \ndoes the County address other aggravating circumstances, such as that even Cadet O'Connell herself described the \nunderwear worn by Mr. Byrd as a “very thin material” (EOR 684:20-23), which obviously rendered the contact with \n*21 Mr. Byrd's testicles, perineum and inner buttocks cheeks that much more direct and invasive.[FN15] \n \nFN15. Also conspicuously missing from the Answering Brief is any mention of the fact that Cadet O'Connell \n(and the other cadets) wore white latex gloves during the search. (Op. Br. 10.) That Cadet O'Connell wore \nlatex gloves is an obvious reflection of the deeply intimate contact she made with Mr. Byrd's genitalia and \nbuttocks. \n \nRemarkably, in its 54-page brief, the County relegates to a single footnote its response to one of the most egregious \ncircumstances of the search of Mr. Byrd (and of the other searches conducted pursuant to this practice): That the cross- \ngender search was performed by a student in civilian clothing, rather than a real officer. (Ans. Br. 41 n.24.) The \nCounty abruptly concludes that “[n]o authority supports the precept that this makes a search unreasonable' (id), yet the \nCounty fails to set forth any of its own authority showing that such searches are reasonable. (Perhaps the lack of case \nlaw on this point reflects the abnormal and bizarre nature of the County's policy; indeed, one would suspect that the \nother jail systems throughout the country would elect to have uniformed professionals, rather than students in street \nclothes, conduct their most intimate searches.) In any event, the “totality of the circumstances” approach mandates that \nall circumstances of a search be considered when assessing “reasonableness,” whether or not a prior case has expressly \naddressed each of the circumstances of the search at issue. \n \nFurthermore, the County is again disposing with common sense if it *22 genuinely believes that the search of Mr. \nByrd (and the others) did not become more traumatic and humiliating by virtue of the fact that the search was per-\nformed by a student in civilian clothing.[FN16] Indeed, it can be argued that this fact, alone, renders the search of Mr. \nByrd unreasonable. The County still has provided no explanation for why a student in street clothes was performing \nsuch an important and intrusive undertaking as feeling Mr. Byrd's testicles, perineum and inner crack for the presence \nof contraband when numerous uniformed professionals were present and available. \n \nFN16. Rather than address this fact, the County chooses to misrepresent the record by asserting Mr. Byrd \n“never testified that he thought these people were random strangers off the street or otherwise unauthorized to \nconduct the search.” (Ans. Br. 41 n.24.) Actually, after repeatedly referring to the individuals in street clothes \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 12 \nas “civilians” during direct examination, Mr. Byrd unequivocally testified on cross- examination that he be-\nlieved they were civilians. (EOR 608:24-609:1.) \n \nIn sum, when all of the circumstances of the search are considered in their totality, the unreasonableness of the search \nof Mr. Byrd is manifest. As Mr. Byrd demonstrated in the Opening Brief, Bell's four-factor test clearly supports a \nfinding of unreasonableness. (Op. Br. 16-28.) The County's responsive strategy of “divide-and-conquer” and “di-\nvide-and-ignore” must be rejected. \n \nC. The County's Remaining Arguments Should Be Rejected \n \nThe County's argument that the Court should find no Fourth Amendment violation because pretrial detainees possess \nno privacy interests (Ans. Br. 27) must *23 fail. First, this Court has stated with unmistakable clarity that “[w]e rec-\nognize that incarcerated prisoners retain a limited right to bodily privacy.” Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333. Second, \ncertain of this Court's prior opinions, in which it has found violations of the Fourth Amendment in the jail context, \nnecessarily depend on the existence of a limited right to bodily privacy (since no Fourth Amendment violation can \noccur without an underlying privacy interest). See, e.g. Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161-62 (9th Cir. \n2006). Third, the numerous sister Circuits that have addressed the issue have concluded that individuals maintain a \nlimited right to bodily privacy while in jail or prison. See Nicholas v. Goord, 430 F.3d 652, 658 (2d Cir. 2005); \nEverson v. Mich. D.O.C., 391 F.3d 737, 757 (6th Cir. 2004); Lyons v. Farrier, 727 F.2d 766, 769 (8th Cir. 1984); \nCumbey v. Meachum, 684 F.2d 712, 714 (10th Cir. 1982). Fourth, it would appear to be an extreme result to conclude \nthat pretrial detainees (such as Mr. Byrd at the time of the search in question) forfeit all privacy interests simply be-\ncause they have been accused of a crime. \n \nThroughout the Answering Brief (despite making no mention of this issue before the District Court), the County harps \non the difference between a “facial” or “as-applied” challenge and argues that Mr. Byrd's challenge cannot possibly be \na “facial” challenge under the “no set of circumstances test.” (See, e.g., Ans. Br. 18, 24, 26.) But Mr. Byrd's argument \nis simple: he is challenging the specific search *24 he was subjected to on October 28, 2004 and the County's docu-\nmented practice of permitting female cadets in civilian clothing to conduct the en masse underwear searches of de-\ntainees, despite the abundant presence of male uniformed officers. Addressing the constitutionality of the County's \ndocumented practice of permitting female cadets to conduct these searches would be perfectly consistent with this \nCourt's approach in prior cases.[FN17] \n \nFN17. See, e.g., Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1524-31 (striking down the prison's policy which permitted male officers \nto search female inmates, while not disturbing the prison's policy which permitted female officers to conduct \nthese same searches); Grummett, 779 F.2d at 494 (addressing constitutionality of prison's practice of per-\nmitting searches and surveillance by female officers); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334 (similar). \n \nII. THE SEARCH OF MR. BYRD VIOLATED HIS SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS \n \nMr. Byrd demonstrated in his Opening Brief that the October 28, 2004 search of Mr. Byrd violated his substantive due \nprocess rights because (i) the search caused Mr. Byrd substantial suffering and humiliation that exceeded the “inherent \ndiscomforts of confinement” and (ii) the County acted with “deliberate indifference” to Mr. Byrd's suffering and \nhumiliation. (Op. Br. 39-42.) \n \nEach of the County's two counterarguments flatly fails. First, the County argues that the “district court ruled that [Mr. \nByrd] had waived this argument below by not raising it before trial” and, thus, Mr. Byrd is precluded from raising it \n*25 for the first time on appeal. (Ans. Br. 48-49, citing EOR 423:1-424:11.) Yet again the County is either entirely \nconfused or attempting to mislead this Court regarding the proceedings below. \n \nA simple read of the very transcript cited by the County reveals that the District Court ruled that Mr. Byrd waived his \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 13 \nprocedural due process claim by not raising it until after the close of evidence. The Court never ruled that Mr. Byrd's \nsubstantive due process claim (which is the claim Mr. Byrd is advancing on appeal) was waived.[FN18] \n \nFN18. To the contrary, the District Court expressly recognized and ruled upon this claim. (See, e.g., 7/27/07 \nPretrial Conference Transcript, EOR 736:12-738:14 (court expressly states that it is permitting Mr. Byrd to \nadvance his substantive due process claim, although Mr. Byrd incorrectly labeled it an Eighth Amendment \nclaim in his pro se complaint); District Court's Rule 50 Order, EOR 6:21-21:13 (court accepts lengthy oral \narguments on whether Mr. Byrd's substantive due process rights were violated, and then rules against Mr. \nByrd on the issue).) \n \nApart from this “waiver” argument, the County devotes only one sentence to attempting to rebut Mr. Byrd's substan-\ntive due process argument, stating “there is no evidence of ‘deliberate indifference’ here, where [Mr. Byrd] gave \nDefendants no reason at all to believe that he had a ‘history of sexual abuse’ and Defendants deliberately disregarded \nthat in subjecting him to the cross-gender pat search.” (Ans. Br. 49.) This one-sentence defense is unresponsive to the \nargument Mr. Byrd advances. Mr. Byrd's substantive due process claim does not hinge on his history of sexual abuse, \nas the County suggests, but rather on the extraordinarily *26 degrading and offensive manner in which he was \nsearched - regardless of his history of sexual abuse. (Op. Br. 38-42.)[FN19] Because the Answering Brief does nothing to \ncounter the substantive due process argument set forth in the Opening Brief, Mr. Byrd respectfully directs the Court to \nthat argument for final consideration. (Op. Br. 38-42.) \n \nFN19. In fact, Mr. Byrd simply noted his history of sexual abuse in a single- sentence footnote, but devoted \nover three pages to the actual basis of his substantive due process claim - i - the uniquely humiliating and \noffensive search performed upon him. (Op. Br. 38-42.) \n \nIII. THE COUNTY'S DISCRIMINATORY SEARCH POLICY AND THE RESULTING SEARCH OF MR. \nBYRD VIOLATED MR. BYRD'S EQUAL PROTECTION RIGHTS \n \nIn the Opening Brief, Mr. Byrd demonstrated that the District Court's sua sponte dismissal of Mr. Byrd's equal pro-\ntection claim was improper, particularly considering that the burden of justifying this gender-based classification was \non the government and considering that Mr. Byrd's pro se claim was entitled to a liberal construction. (Op. Br. 42-46.) \n \nIn its Answering Brief, the County improperly attempts to shift the burden by contending that Mr. Byrd was required \nto “demonstrate” that male and female detainees are “similarly situated” and that Mr. Byrd was obligated to cite “the \nnumber of inmates housed, their average length of stay, their security levels, the incidence of violence and victim-\nhood.” (Ans. Br. 30.) This argument is silly. Mr. *27 Byrd's equal protection claim was dismissed at the pleading stage \nfor failure to state a claim (before any evidence was adduced on this claim). (EOR 59-60.) In order to plead an equal \nprotection violation, a plaintiff (particularly a pro se plaintiff who is entitled to the “benefit of any doubt” and to a \n“liberal” construction) is not required to “demonstrate” any of the items listed by the County. The County not only \nmisstates the legal standard on a motion to dismiss, but misapplies the burden applicable to a gender-based equal \nprotection claim. \n \nAs Mr. Byrd demonstrated in the Opening Brief, where a plaintiff challenges governmental conduct that treats men \nand women differently, the burden (of demonstrating that the discriminatory conduct is substantially related to an \nimportant government interest) is on the government - and not on the person challenging the conduct. (Op. Br. 45-46 \n(citing cases).) The County's argument that Mr. Byrd was “required to demonstrate” the factual circumstances listed - \nin order to prove that male and female detainees are “similarly situated” (Ans. Br. 30) is an erroneous attempt to shift \nthe burden away from the County, and is contradicted by the approach repeatedly applied by the United States Su-\npreme Court in equal protection cases brought by men. \n \nIndeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly found violations of the equal protection clause based on the discriminatory \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 14 \ntreatment of men where the government failed to meet its burden of showing that the unequal treatment was *28 \njustified. See, e Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 278-283 (1979); Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n727-731 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197-204 (1976); Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, \n149-152 (1980); see also Monterey Mech. Co. v. Wilson, 125 F.3d 702, 712-714 (9th Cir. 1997). Critically, in none of \nthese cases did the Supreme Court initially consider whether the men and women implicated by the challenged con-\nduct were “similarly situated.” \n \nThe Court in each of these cases could have held that the equal protection clause was not violated because the plaintiff \nfailed to demonstrate that the men and women subject to the governmental conduct were “similarly situated,” but the \nCourt did not such thing. Rarely will governmental conduct that treats men and women differently apply to all men \nand all women. Instead, the governmental conduct tends to treat a subset of men differently than a subset of women, \nsuch as husbands and wives in Orr, male nursing applicants and female nursing applicants in Hogan, male drinkers \nages 18-20 and female drinkers ages 18-20 in Craig, male widowers and female widows in Wengler, and male sub-\ncontractors and female subcontractors in Wilson. See supra. In our case, the County treats male detainees and female \ndetainees differently. The County's argument that Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim fails because Mr. Byrd failed to \n“demonstrate” (at the pleading stage) that male detainees and female detainees are “similarly situated” is *29 con-\ntradicted by a raft of Supreme Court precedent, and should be rejected by this Court. \n \nThe County's alternative argument that, assuming the detainees are similarly situated, the County nonetheless met its \nburden of demonstrating the gender classification is “substantially related” to an “important” government interest \n(Ans. Br. 32-33) is nonsensical. The District Court sua sponte dismissed Mr. Byrd's claim (despite the County's failure \nto file a motion to dismiss this claim) before trial and before any evidence was adduced on whether the government \ncould meet its burden under the intermediate scrutiny test. The County's attempt to cite evidence that was developed at \ntrial (Ans. Br. 33) to demonstrate that Mr. Byrd's equal protection claim was correctly dismissed nearly two months \nbefore trial makes no sense.[FN20] \n \nFN20. Indeed, the County's own case, Yates v. Stalder, 217 F.3d 332 (5th Cir. 2000) (Ans. Br. 30), undercuts \nthe County's argument, since the Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the inmates' equal \nprotection claim, and held that the district court's conclusion that the male and female inmates were not \n“similarly situated” was premature and unsupported by record evidence. Id. at 334-35. Moreover, the small \nset of out-of-circuit cases cited by the County (Ans. Br. 30-31) is clearly trumped by Mr. Byrd's binding \nSupreme Court case law and, in any event, each of those out-of-circuit cases, unlike our case, involved rul-\nings after evidence was adduced. \n \nMoreover, and perhaps most importantly, the evidence the County cites does nothing to explain why it employs a \ngender-based search policy. The evidence the County relies upon to justify the discriminatory nature of its search \npolicy (Ans. Br. *30 33) is the same evidence it relies upon to argue that its cross-gender search policy is reasonable \nunder the Fourth Amendment.[FN21] \n \nFN21. See Ans. Br. 33 (citing the same evidence and repeating the same conclusion that “the jail simply does \nnot have the luxury of having male inmates pat searched by only male officers”). \n \nThe County has entirely missed the point. In order to successfully demonstrate that its gender-based classification is \npermissible under the equal protection clause, the County must provide evidence showing that there is a reason why \nfemale detainees are searched only by female officers (when male detainees may be searched by either gender). In \nother words, the equal protection analysis does not turn on whether there is a justification for permitting female of-\nficers to search male detainees; it turns on whether there is a justification for permitting female officers to search male \ndetainees while simultaneously prohibiting male officers from searching female detainees. The record is utterly silent \non this point, and the County has failed to cite a single piece of evidence showing that the different policy that applies \nto female detainees is substantially related to an important government interest. Consequently, the County has not met \nits burden under the intermediate scrutiny test. See Hogan, 458 U.S. at 729; Wilson, 125 F.3d at 713; Craig, 429 U.S. \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 15 \nat 200-04.[FN22] \n \nFN22. That this claim was dismissed without prejudice (when Mr. Byrd was still proceeding pro se) does not \nalter whether the dismissal is properly on appeal, since the dismissal without prejudice merged into the final \njudgment that was entered in this case. See Ash v. Cvetkov, 739 F.2d 493, 496 (9th Cir. 1984); De Tie v. \nOrange County, 152 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1998); Munoz v. Small Bus. Adm., 644 F.2d 1361, 1364 (9th \nCir. 1981). \n \n*31 IV. THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY ALLOWING THE COUNTY TO \nPROSPER FROM ITS ILLEGAL DOCUMENT RETENTION POLICY AND BY COMPOUNDING THE \nPREJUDICE CAUSED TO MR. BYRD \n \nThe Opening Brief showed that the District Court not only refused to sanction the County for its patently illegal \ndocument “retention” policy (since the District Court failed to conclude that the County's conduct or policy were \nillegal, notwithstanding the uncontroverted evidence in the record, and failed to instruct the jury accordingly), but the \nDistrict Court affirmatively rewarded the County for its illegal policy by admitting the highly misleading and pre-\njudicial “Video Yearbook.” The Answering Brief falls far short of rebutting the Opening Briefs showing. \n \nCritically, the County makes no mention of Mr. Byrd's citation to the uncontroverted evidence in the record illumi-\nnating the County's policy (i.e., the County's own written filing and the sworn testimony of the County's own witness, \nCaptain Peterson) and, instead, attempts to prove the tenor and legality of the County's policy by citing the oral ar-\nguments and statements made by its attorney at the hearing on the parties' motions pursuant to Rule 50. (Ans. Br. 50 & \nn.29, 52 n.31 (arguing that the “record is uncontroverted” by citing counsel's statements *32 below, rather than evi-\ndence in the record).) As the County should be aware, oral statements by counsel are evidence and, hence, do nothing \nto rebut the uncontroverted evidence cited by Mr. Byrd.[FN23] The record unambiguously demonstrates the illegality of \nthe County's document “retention” policy, since it demonstrates that the County does not retain evidence more than \ntwo years after it is created even if a federal lawsuit is filed before the two-year point, unless a “specific request” is \nmade by an attorney.[FN24] \n \nFN23. See EOTTvv.Winterthur, 257 F.3d 992, 999 (9th Cir. 2001) (rejecting party's citation to its counsel's \nstatements below because such statements “are not part of the factual record”); accord Carillo-Gonzalez v. \nINS, 353 F.3d 1077, 1079 (9th Cir. 2003); Las Vegas Nightlife, Inc. v. Clark County, 38 F.3d 1100,1102(9th \nCir. 1994); Barcamerica Int. v. Tyfield, 289 F.3d 589, 593 n.4 (9th Cir. 2002). \n \nFN24. The County is misguided in arguing that “[t]his lawsuit is not about the County's document retention \npolicy” or whether it is “illegal” (Ans. Br. 52), since it is well-recognized that because a plaintiff cannot \nchallenge a defendants evidence- related misconduct in a separate lawsuit or by a separate cause of action \n(since litigation-related misconduct does not give rise to an actionable claim), a plaintiffs only opportunity to \nremedy such misconduct is through evidentiary rulings in the lawsuit in which the misconduct took place. See, \ne.g., Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Sup. Ct, 18 Cal. 4th 1, 8-10 (1998); Tobel v. Travelers Ins. Co., 195 Ariz. 363, \n371 (1999). The County is equally misguided in arguing that Mr. Byrd cannot challenge the admission of the \ntape because after it was admitted over his objection, Mr. Byrd “used it to argue that the search was con-\nducted as a training exercise.” (Ans. Br. 53.) This argument is silly and, unsurprisingly, unsupported by a \nsingle case. There is no rule stating that if a piece of evidence is admitted over a party's objection, the party \nforfeits his right to appeal that ruling if he subsequently attempts to use the admitted evidence to support his \nposition on one of the many issues that arises in the case. \n \n*33 Further, the County argues that the “Video Yearbook” was properly admitted into evidence because Mr. Bryd \n“opened the door” by asking Sheriff Arpaio questions about the unedited footage. (Anss. Br. 52-53.) Contrary to the \nDistrict Court's ruling below and the County's argument on appell the “opened door” doctrine is not applicable here \n\n2008 WL 2116533 (C.A.9)   Page 16 \nbecause to the extent the door was “opened” regarding whether the search of Mr. Byrd was videotaped, the “Video \nYearbook” did nothing to rebut Mr. Byrd's claim that he was videotaped. \n \nImportantly, Mr. Byrd testified that he was videotaped during the search (EOR 602:17-25), Cadet O'Connell testified \nthat the cameraman recorded additional footage on October 28, 2004 that was notincluded on the “Video Yearbook” \n(O'Connell, EOR 301:4-8), and the County did not produce a single witness (including Cadet O'Connell) who testified \nthat Mr. Byrd was not recorded. If the County wanted to rebut Mr. Byrd's sworn testimony that he was recorded that \nday, it should have put a witness on the stand (such as the cameraman himself) who could affirmatively testify that the \nsearch of Mr. Byrd (and the other searches) were not recorded. \n \nHaving failed to do this, the County instead introduced the “Video Yearbook” in an attempt to prove that Mr. Byrd was \nnot recorded. But Cadet O'Connell admitted on the witness stand that the “Video Yearbook” did not include all of the \nfootage recorded that day. (Op. Br. 48 n.35; EOR 301:4-8.) Therefore, *34 to the extent that the “door was opened” \nregarding whether the search of Mr. Byrd was recorded, it is abundantly clear that the “Video Yearbook” did not rebut \nMr. Byrd's testimony on this issue. Accordingly, the “Video Yearbook” was improperly admitted pursuant to the \n“opened door” doctrine.[FN25] \n \nFN25. See S.M. v. J.K., 262 F.3d 914, 920 (9th Cir. 2001) (“Plaintiff did not open the door to more than \nrebuttal evidence that she had been assaulted previously. The court appropriately deemed the door open only \nto the extent of evidence concerning past rape and abuse.”); U.S. v. Collicott, 92 F.3d 973, 981 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(holding “opened door” doctrine did not apply because the evidence sought to be admitted did not rebut the \ntestimony that allegedly opened the door). Thomas v. Hubbard, 273 F.3d 1164,1174 (9th Cir. 2002) (same), \noverruled on other grounds by Payton v. Woodford, 299 F.3d 815, 829 n.11 (9th Cir. 2002). \n \nThe County also argues that any error was “harmless.” (Ans. Br. 53.) As Mr. Byrd showed on pages 54-55 of the \nOpening Brief, it is the entire sequence of events pertaining to the video evidence of the search that caused Mr. Byrd \nexorbitant harm: The District Court not only refused to sanction the County for its patently illegal document “reten-\ntion” policy, but the District Court affirmatively rewarded the County for its illegal policy by admitting the highly \nmisleading and prejudicial “Video Yearbook” (which depicted other cadets performing fully- clothed searches on \ntheir supervisors without intimate contact with the genitalia or inner buttocks). Considering that the jury was asked to \ndetermine the manner in *35 which Mr. Byrd was searched by Cadet O'Connell, it is difficult to imagine a more \nharmful set of errors.[FN26] \n \nFN26. The Court should also reject the County's argument that Mr. Byrd waived any challenge to the ad-\nmission of the “Video Yearbook” because he did not formally object “[a]t the time the district court ruled that \nPlaintiff had opened the door to having the video played.” (Ans. Br. 53) This Court has made clear that in \nassessing whether a party preserves an objection for appeal, it is not necessary that the party actually object at \nthe time of the ruling, so long as his objection has been clearly made so that the Court is aware of the party's \nobjection. See Brownv. Avemco Inv. Corp., 603 F.2d 1367, 1370 (9th Cir. 1979); see Palmerin v. City of \nRiverside, 794 F.2d 1409,1413 (9th Cir. 1986). The record cites in the Opening Brief demonstrate that Mr. \nByrd vehemently objected to the admission of the “Video Yearbook” and that the District Court simply \ndisagreed with him. (Op. Br. 52.) \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nMr. Byrd respectfully requests that this Court reverse the District Court on each of the above grounds, and remand for \nfurther proceedings. \n \nCharles E.

      "text": "1 WO\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n7 FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA\n8\n9 Charles Edward Byrd,  ) No. CV04-02701-PHX-NVW\n)\n10 Plaintiff,  ) ORDER\n)\n11 vs. )\n)\n12 )\nJoseph M. Arpaio, et al.,  )\n13 )\nDefendants.  )\n14 )\n)\n15 )\n16 This case has been pending before me for several years, and there have been extensive\n17 proceedings, including a full trial and appeal.  Afi nal pretrial conference is set for September\n18 14, 2011.\n19 Since the previous trial, a legal dispute arose in which the law f irm of Fennemore\n20 Craig PC — which represents Mr. Byrd — represents a plaintiff against a limited liability\n21 company and a limited partnership in which I and my wife have indirect interests. Though\n22 there is no claim or possibility of personal liability to me and my wife, we have beneficial\n23 interests in the entities and therefore have an ultimate financial interest in the litigation.\n24 I have no actual or potential bias against Fnenemore Craig and I currently preside over\n25 cases in which Fennemore Craig’s clients have waived the potential conflict.  Because this\n26 case predated the LLC/LP dispute described above, I did not recognize the potential conflict\n27 in this case until recently.\n28\n\n1 A more complete description of the LLC/LP litigation, and m y and my wife’s\n2 interests, is as follows:\n3 THE INVESTMENT ENTITIES AND MY INTEREST IN THEM\n4 I and my wife are both (a) members of Apache Peak Investments, LLC, an Arizona\n5 limited liability company, and (b) shareholders of Whetstone Development Company, an\n6 Arizona corporation. Apache Peak Investments, LLC is a partner of Whetstone Partners,\n7 LLP, an Arizona limited liability partnership. I am not a general partner of Whetstone\n8 Partners, LLP. My involvement in it is only indirect, through my ownership interest in one\n9 of its constituent partnerships, Apache Peak Investments, LLC. Whetstone Partners has an\n10 interest, either as owner, Trust Beneficiary, or Beneficiary of a Deed of Trust, in\n11 approximately 13,000 acres of land located in Benson, Cochise County, Arizona. This land\n12 is commonly known as the “Whetstone Ranch.” Along with other property, approximately\n13 1,700 acres (the “WDC Investment Property”) of the Whetstone Ranch was optioned by\n14 Whetstone Partners, LLP to WDC Investment Company, LLC. WDC Investment Company,\n15 LLC is currently wholly owned by Whetstone Development Company.\n16 I do not act as a manager, officer, or director of any of these entities. I have never\n17 acted in a management capacity for any of them. As shareholders, we have less than a 1%\n18 percent interest in Whetstone Development Company, the sole member of WDC Investment.\n19 Therefore, we indirectly hold the same percentage interest in WDC Investment Company.\n20 By virtue of our membership in Apache Peak Investments, LLC which in turn is a member\n21 of Whetstone Partners, LLP, we also have ultimately less than 1% beneficial interest in\n22 Whetstone Partners, LLP.\n23 SAGE LITIGATION\n24 WDC Investment Company entered into a contract to assign its option rights in the\n25 WDC Investment Property to Sage Whetstone, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.\n26 On April 30, 2008 Sage Whetstone filed a Complaint in the U.S. District Court, District of\n27 Arizona (Complaint No. CIV-08-275-JMR) against both WDC Investment Company, LLC,\n28 and Whetstone Partners, L.L.P. arising out of the contract for the option rights. Fennemore\n- 2 -\n\n1 Craig PC represents Sage Whetstone, LLC in the litigation. The Complaint contains four\n2 counts, which are as follows:\n3 1. Count One: (Breach of Contract – Covenant of Good Faith and Fair\n4 Dealing). The contract provided that certain documents would be imposed as encumbrances\n5 (the “Encumbrance Documents”) upon the WDC Investment Property. Sage Whetstone\n6 alleges that the Encumbrance Documents tendered to Sage Whetstone in connection with the\n7 contract were “not commercially reasonable, and seek to deprive Sage Whetstone from\n8 receiving the benefits reasonably contemplated and expected to flow to it under the\n9 Agreement.” Therefore, Sage Whetstone asserts that it is entitled to damages for breach of\n10 contract.\n11 2. Count Two: (Recision of Contract). Sage Whetstone alleges that the parties\n12 understood that “a material basis of the Agreement was the participation of a financially\n13 responsible, experienced, national scope homebuilder and developer such as Pulte [Homes].”\n14 Because Pulte Homes withdrew from a contract to purchase a separate parcel within the\n15 Whetstone Ranch, Sage Whetstone claims it is entitled to recision of the contract.\n16 3. Count Three: (Breach of Contract – Return of Deposit). Sage Whetstone\n17 alleges that “if the parties do not agree on Encumbrance Documents, Sage Whetstone can\n18 terminate the Agreement, and the refundable deposits paid by Sage Whetstone then shall be\n19 repaid to Sage Whetstone.” Sage Whetstone alleges that it did not agree to the Encubmrance\n20 Documents, and therefore, is entitled to the return of its refundable earnest money deposit\n21 in the amount of $1, 600,000.00.\n22 4. Count Four: (Unjust Enrichment). Sage Whetstone alleges that it has “paid\n23 for services and consultants whose work has increased the value of the land.” Sage\n24 Whetstone further alleges that WDC Investments and Whetstone Partners have failed “to pay\n25 Sage Whetstone for the value of the benefits received,” and that such failure to pay for the\n26 value of these benefits is not justified. Therefore, Sage Whetstone alleges that it is entitled\n27 to payment of damages arising from WDC Investments’ and Whetstone Partners’ unjust\n28 enrichment in connection with Sage Whetstone’s planning and consulting services. No\n- 3 -\n\n1 specific amount is prayed for under this count. However, Sage Whetstone alleges that it\n2 expended approximately $4,430,000.00 in connection with “the Master Planned Community”\n3 it intended to construct upon the property.\n4 5. Answer and Counterclaim. The Defendants in this action have filed an\n5 Answer and Counterclaim and have asserted both that nothing is owed to Sage Whetstone,\n6 LLC and that Sage Whetstone, LLC is liable to the Defendants pursuant to A.R.S. § § 33-420\n7 for their filing of a wrongful lis pendens.\n8 STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL DISQUALIFICATION\n9 The standards for judicial disqualification are set out in 28 U.S.C. § 455. I find no\n10 grounds for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455(b), which are non-waivable. However,\n11 the general disqualification of 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) requires a judge to disqualify himself “in\n12 any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” Section 3.6-3 of\n13 the Guide to Judiciary Policies and Procedures summarizes general principles of\n14 disqualification where a lawyer appearing before the judge is representing an opposing party\n15 in other litigation adverse to the judge:\n16 § 3.6-3 Lawyer Representing Party Opposing Judge in Other Litigation\n(a) A judge should recuse from cases handled by a law firm, one of whose members\n17 or associates represents a party adverse to the judge in other litigation. Similarly, a\njudge who joins a class action arising from former employment with the Department\n18 of Justice should recuse (subject to remittal) from cases handled by a DOJ attorney\ndirectly involved in the class action or the underlying adimnistrative decisions leading\n19 to it.\n(b) Recusal is not required when a lawyer or law firm previously represented an\n20 adverse party in litigation to which the judge or the judge’s minor child was a party,\nafter the matter has been finally closed.\n21 (c) Judge should recuse, subject to remittal, from cases in which the bankruptcy\ntrustee’s counsel is an attorney in a firm whose partner is suing the judge in unrelated\n22 litigation.\n(d) When a former law firm is involved in litigation that may result in the judge’s\n23 personal liability, the judge should recuse (absent remittal) where the following\npersons appear: lawyers who are parties against the law firm; law firms representing\n24 plaintiffs against the law firm; lawyers who are lay and expert witnesses against the\nlaw firm; specific lawyers representing the law firm; other members of the firms\n25 representing the law firm.\n(e) A judge should recuse from matters handled by a law firm representing a\n26 developer, where the judge’s property value would be diminished substantially by the\ndevelopment, the judge has publicly opposed it, and the matter is in litigation (though\n27 the judge is not a party).\n(f) A judge’s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned because a party moved, in\n28 unrelated litigation, to add as a defendant a company in which the judge had a\n- 4 -\n\n1 financial interest, but then withdrew the motion.\n2 I  have previously concluded that m y  ultimate  financial interests in Whetstone\n3 Development  Company,  the sole m ember  of WDC Investm ent  Company, LLC, and\n4 Whetstone Partners, L.L.P. are sufficient to implicate 28 U.S.C. § 455(a), as interpreted by\n5 section 3.6-3 of the Guide to Judiciary P olicies and Procedures.  However, though m y\n6 impartiality might reasonably be questioned in matters in which Fennemore Craig PC are\n7 counsel, I have no actual bias or prejudice for or against the firm or any of its lawyers, or for\n8 or against any of its clients in the matters before me.\n9 Disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) is subject to waiver if “preceded by a full\n10 disclosure on the record of the ba sis for disqualification.” 28 U.S.C. § 455(e). I have\n11 consulted with the office of the General Counsel of the Administrative Office of the Courts,\n12 which provides advice to federal judges on matters of judicial ethics and disqualification, and\n13 I am advised that my disqualification in this case is subject to waiver.  I will therefore require\n14 the parties to file a statem ent by September 1 indicating whether or not they waive the\n15 potential disqualification.\n16 Regarding Plaintiff’s “Motion for Additional Time  to Respond to Defendants’\n17 Motions in Limine and Motion to Continue the Pretrial Conference Set for September 14,\n18 2011” (Doc. 155): If I continue to pr eside over this case after Septem ber 1, I will grant\n19 Plaintiff a reasonable extension.  Otherwise, the next judge will address that motion.\n20 IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that, on or before September 1, 2011, each side shall\n21 file a notice stating whether or not it waives the conflict described above.\n22 DATED this 25th day of August, 2011.\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n- 5 -",

(See Attached Exhibit “D”)   \n6 Plaintiff alleges that the sexual harassment/assault incident occurred on October \n7 28, 2004, and that he gri eved the incident on October 28, 2004.  There i s no \n8 record of his filing a grievance regar ding this issue on October 28, 2004.  (See \n9 Grievance Index, Exhibit “D”)  The r ecord reflects Plaintiff did not grieve on \n10 October 28, 2004.  Grievances must be filed within twenty-four (24) hours of the \n11 incident.  This was not done.   The record  reflects three grievances were filed \n12 regarding the incident involving Officer O’Connell, but not until December, 2004. \n13 Grievance No. 04-15460 filed on December 19, 2004, was voluntarily withdrawn \n14 by the Plaintiff on December 20, 2004. (Exhibit 2)  Grievance No. 04-15550 filed \n15 on December 9, 2004 (Exhib it 3) and Grievance No. 04-15549 (Exhibit 4) filed \n16 on December 19, 2004, were not exhausted administratively as the Plaintiff was \n17 released  to the Ariz ona  Department  of Correc tions  on  December 22, 2004.    \n18 (Exhibit 5) \n19 II.  LEGAL ARGUMENT \n20 A.  Motion to Dismiss is Proper Avenue for this Challenge. \n21   The failure of a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant \n22 to the PLRA is treated as a matter in  abatement subject to a non-enumerated, \n4 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 62    Filed 06/19/07   Page 5 of 7\n \n1 Rule 12(b) motion.  Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003), cert. \n2 denied, 540 U.S. 810, 124 S.Ct. 50 , 157 L.Ed.2d 23 (2003) and  Ritza v. Int’l. \n3 Longshormen’s and Warehousmen’s Union, 837 F.2d 365, 369 (9 th Cir. 1988) \n4 When the Court is ruling upon a non-enumerated motion such as this one, there \n5 is no presumption of truthfulness which attaches to the Plaintiff’s allegations set \n6 forth in the Complaint and “the existenc e of a disputed material fact will not \n7 preclude the trial court from eval uating for itself the merits of the jurisdictional \n8 claims.”  Ritza, 837 F.2d at 369  quoting Mortensen v. First Fed. Sav. & Loan \n9 Ass’n., 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977)(citations omitted). \n10 Defendant  has the burden of rais ing  and prov ing  the  absence of  \n11 exhaustion.  Id.  If the Court concludes that a  prisoner has not exhausted non-\n12 judicial remedies, the proper remedy is dismissal of the claim without prejudice.  \n13 Id.  Exhaustion under the PLRA is comparable to a defense of failure to comply \n14 with the statute of limitations, both are affirmative defenses.   Id. at 1245.   See \n15 also Ritza, 837 F.2d at 368-69  (“ Failure to exhaust non judicial remedies is a \n16 matter in abatement, not goin g to the merits of t he claim, and as such i s not \n17 properly raised in a motion for summary judgment.”) \n18 B.  Plaintiff Failed to Exhaust the Administrative Procedure. \n19   The  PLRA provides that “[n] o  action  shall be brought with respect to \n20 prison  conditions  under [42 U.S.C. §19 83],  or any   other F ederal  law, by   a \n21 prisoner  confined in any jail, prison, or   other correctional facility until such \n22 administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.”  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).  \n5 \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 62    Filed 06/19/07   Page 6 of 7\n \n1 Exhaustion is mandated r egardless of the relief offer ed through administrative \n2 procedures.  Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 741, 121  S.Ct. 1819, 1825, 149 \n3 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).  Exhaustion appli es to all inmate suits about prison life.  \n4 Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002) \n5   Plaintiff has failed t o exhaust available remedies.  (Complaint, pp. 4-5, ¶ \n6 5.)  Sergeant Fi sher avers in her affidav it, all issues pertain ing to an inmates \n7 conditions of confinement are grievable.   \n8 III.  CONCLUSION \n9   Plaintiff has not complied wit h the mandates of the PLRA by f ailing to \n10 exhaust the grievance process available to him as to all counts.  Because of his  \n11 failure to exhaust, Defendants respectfully request that  the Court dismiss all of \n12 Plaintiff’s claims. \n13 RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this _18th_ day of June 2007.  \n14 ANDREW P.

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nOPINION\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge: \nCharles Byrd, a former pretrial detainee in the minimum-\nsecurity Durango Jail in Maricopa County, Arizona, brought\nthis action under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against Maricopa County\nSheriff Joseph Arpaio in his personal and official capacities,\nKathleen O’Connell, a former cadet at the Maricopa County\nSheriff’s Office Training Academy, and Captain Austin Peter-\nson, O’Connell’s supervisor.1 Byrd contends that a search of\nhis housing unit, during which a partial strip search and pat\ndown of his groin area was conducted by a female training\ncadet  despite  the  availability  of  male  detention  officers\nnearby, violated his constitutional rights. The district court\ndismissed Byrd’s equal protection claim and granted judg-\nment as a matter of law against Byrd on aspects of his Four-\nteenth and Fourth Amendment claims. After a jury resolved\ncertain factual disputes relating to the search, the district court\nentered judgment in favor of all defendants. Given the facts\nand procedural posture of this case, we affirm the judgment\nof the district court. \nI\nA\nByrd was a pretrial detainee at minimum-security Durango\nJail in Maricopa County, Arizona. In October 2004, there had\nbeen multiple fights in Byrd’s housing unit, and officials sus-\npected that contraband was circulating in the jail. In order to\n1We construe Byrd’s complaint against Arpaio in his official capacity\nas a suit against Maricopa County. See, e.g., Kentucky v. Graham, 473\nU.S. 159, 165-66 (1985); see also Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform v. Los\nAngeles County Sheriff Dept., 533 F.3d 780, 786 (9th Cir. 2008) (official\ncapacity suit against county sheriff was equivalent to suit against county).\nWe refer to individual defendants by name when appropriate, and other-\nwise refer to defendants collectively as “County.”\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 4 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5909\nconduct a coordinated search of Byrd’s entire housing unit,\njail  supervisors  requested  assistance  from  the  Maricopa\nCounty  Sheriff’s  Office  Training  Academy  (Academy)\ncadets. On October 28, jail officers carrying taser and pepper\nguns entered Byrd’s cell and ordered him to remove all his\nclothing except his boxer shorts, which were made of thin\nmaterial. The officers ordered Byrd to walk into an open com-\nmon area known as the “day room,” where 25 to 30 Academy\ncadets and 10 to 15 uniformed detention officers were present.\nThe cadets wore jeans and white T-shirts with their last names\nprinted  on  the  back  in  black  lettering.  Approximately  one\nthird of both the cadets and officers in the room were female.\nAt least one person with a hand-held camera was present in\nthe day room. \nJail officials directed five or six inmates at a time to stand\nin front of a row of waiting cadets in order to be searched.\nWhen it was Byrd’s turn, the officers ordered Byrd to walk\nover to the cadets, stand facing away from them, raise his\narms  above  his  head,  and  spread  his  legs.  O’Connell\napproached Byrd from behind and conducted the search as\nfollows: She ran her hands across the waistband of Byrd’s\nboxer shorts and pulled the waistband out a few inches to\ncheck for anything hidden or taped inside; she did not look\ninto his boxer shorts. She lightly frisked over his boxer shorts\nand down the outside of his thigh, stopping at the bottom of\nthe  shorts.  Through  the  boxer  shorts,  O’Connell  moved\nByrd’s scrotum and penis with the back of her hand in order\nto frisk his groin, applying light pressure to feel for contra-\nband. She then placed her hand at the bottom of his buttocks,\nran it upward over his boxers, and separated the cheeks to\nsearch for any contraband taped, placed, or hidden inside.2\n2Although the parties dispute whether this search constituted a “strip\nsearch,” we have referred to a search as a “pat down and partial strip\nsearch,” and simply as a “strip search,” when a suspect was stripped to her\nunderwear and officers felt the suspect’s groin area through the under-\nwear.United States v. Gonzalez-Rincon, 36 F.3d 859, 861 (9th Cir. 1994).\nBecause Byrd was not completely unclothed, but was in his boxer shorts\nand the search physically explored his genital region, we will refer to the\nsearch as a “pat down and partial strip search” or, for the sake of brevity\nand convenience, a “strip search.”\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 5 of 34\n5910 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nThe record indicates the search of Byrd was brief. O’Connell\ndemonstrated the search to the jury and testified that it lasted\nbetween 10 and 20 seconds, while Byrd testified that it lasted\n60 seconds. \nUnder the County’s policies and customs, female officers\nand cadets are not permitted to observe or conduct cross-\ngender strip searches if all of an inmate’s clothing has been\nremoved. They are, however, permitted to observe and con-\nduct searches, whether visual or tactile, if an inmate is wear-\ning  underwear,  which  at  Maricopa  County’s  detention\nfacilities are standard-issue boxer shorts. Females are not per-\nmitted to look into a male inmate’s underwear when conduct-\ning a pat down and partial strip search.\nB\nAfter the search, Byrd filed an inmate grievance form with\nthe Maricopa County Sheriff’s office. He subsequently filed\nadditional grievances with the County, none of which resulted\nin remedial action. Byrd filed a pro se complaint in district\ncourt on November 26, 2004, and amended it June 14, 2005,\nalleging that the search violated: (1) his Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches; (2) his substan-\ntive due process right to be free from punishment;3 and (3) his\nFourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws.\n3Byrd’s pro se complaint alleged that his Eighth Amendment rights had\nbeen violated. Because at the time of the search Byrd was a pretrial\ndetainee, the district court correctly recharacterized this claim as one\nalleging that the County violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 537\nn.16 (1979) (“The Court of Appeals properly relied on the Due Process\nClause rather than the Eighth Amendment in considering the claims of\npretrial detainees. Due process requires that a pretrial detainee not be pun-\nished. A sentenced inmate, on the other hand, may be punished, although\nthat punishment may not be “cruel and unusual” under the Eighth Amend-\nment.”). We refer to this claim as a Fourteenth Amendment substantive\ndue process claim throughout. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 6 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5911\nByrd alleged that his Fourth Amendment and substantive due\nprocess rights were violated because O’Connell caused “wan-\nton and unnecessary infliction of pain” when she “grabbed his\ngenitals twice, then ram[m]ed her index finger through the\ncrack of his butto[cks].” He also alleged that there was no\nneed for a female cadet to touch him because there were more\nthan ten male detention officers present who could have per-\nformed the search. In addition, he claimed that jail officials\nwere aware of, but deliberately indifferent to, the psychologi-\ncal pain that a cross-gender body search was likely to cause.\nByrd alleged that the search caused him “public humiliation”\nand “psychological trauma,” among other injuries. \nThe County moved for summary judgment, arguing that\n“Officer  O’Connell  conducted  the  frisk  (body)  search  of\nPlaintiff in accordance with MCSO policy DH-3; in the pres-\nence of her supervisor, Captain Peterson; and in the process\ndemonstrated and instructed detention officers in the proper\nmanner in which to conduct such a search for contraband.”\nThe district court issued an order dismissing part of the\ncomplaint, and granting in part and denying in part the Coun-\nty’s motion for summary judgment. Under its obligation to\ndismiss sua sponte certain complaints brought by prisoners\nproceeding in forma pauperis, see 28 U.S.C. §1915(e)(2)(B),\nand certain claims regarding conditions of confinement, see\n42 U.S.C. §1997e(c), the district court dismissed Count II,\nwhich had alleged an equal protection violation, for failure to\nstate a claim. \nThe district court denied the County’s motion for summary\njudgment  on  Byrd’s  Fourth  Amendment  and  Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claims.4 The court held\n4The district court also granted the County’s motion in part, holding that\nunder 42 U.S.C. §1997e(e), Byrd could not recover for mental or emo-\ntional harm, but he could recover compensatory, nominal, and punitive\ndamages premised on a violation of his Fourth Amendment and substan-\ntive due process rights, to the extent they were actionable. This holding is\nnot at issue on appeal. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 7 of 34\n5912 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat the County was not entitled to summary judgment on\nByrd’s Fourth Amendment claim because it had not estab-\nlished that the search was “necessary to security or that it fur-\nthered a legitimate penological interest,” and was not entitled\nto  summary  judgment  on  Byrd’s  substantive  due  process\nclaim because it had not briefed the issue. \nC\nThe district court appointed trial counsel for Byrd. While\nproceeding  pro  se,  Byrd  had  made  no  discovery  requests.\nWhen Byrd’s newly appointed counsel learned that a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present on the day in question,\nhe asked the County to produce footage that may have been\nshot. The County initially stated it was unaware of any video\nrecording  of  the  search.  Shortly  before  trial,  however,\nO’Connell informed defense counsel that the Academy had\ngiven the cadets a Video Yearbook, which showed approxi-\nmately one minute of footage from the day of the search. The\nCounty stated that it did not have the rest of the videotape\nfootage, and that it assumed it had been destroyed pursuant to\nthe County’s retention policy. The Video Yearbook did not\ninclude  any  footage  of  Byrd  or  of  O’Connell  performing\nsearches.\nByrd asked the court to exclude all references to the Video\nYearbook on the grounds that the brief surviving footage did\nnot show Byrd or O’Connell, and that it would be misleading\nand prejudicial because it highlighted the cadets in a favorable\nlight. In the alternative, Byrd requested an adverse inference\njury instruction that would state the videotape established that\nthe search was done solely for training purposes, and that\nO’Connell  groped  Byrd’s  private  parts.  The  district  court\nreserved its decisions on whether to exclude the Video Year-\nbook, and on whether to give the requested instruction, pend-\ning the evidence produced at trial. \nAt trial, Byrd’s counsel questioned Sheriff Arpaio about the\nvideo footage. The district court held that this opened the door\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 8 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5913\nto the introduction of the Video Yearbook. Both the County\nand Byrd subsequently showed the video to the jury.\nAt  the  conclusion  of  testimony,  both  parties  moved  for\njudgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal\nRules of Civil Procedure.5 The district court granted judgment\nas a matter of law in favor of Captain Peterson (O’Connell’s\nsupervisor) on the ground that he did not have any role at\nDurango Jail at the time of the search. Byrd does not chal-\nlenge this ruling on appeal. \nNext, because Byrd had not presented any evidence that\nArpaio had instituted an unconstitutional policy (i.e., a policy\nof conducting searches for an unconstitutional purpose or in\nan unconstitutional manner), and there was no allegation that\nArpaio had personally conducted or supervised the search, the\ndistrict court held that Arpaio was entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law, notwithstanding the remaining factual disputes.\nThis left one remaining defendant, Cadet O’Connell. The\ndistrict court concluded that the factual disputes over the pur-\npose of the search and the manner in which it was conducted\nshould be decided by the jury. The court held that if the jury\nfound that the County had conducted the search for an identi-\nfied security need, and if the jury found that O’Connell had\nnot conducted the search in an inappropriate manner (i.e., by\nintentionally squeezing or kneading Byrd’s penis or scrotum,\nor improperly touching his anus through his underwear), then\n5Rule 50 provides: \nIf a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and\nthe court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the\ncourt may: (A) resolve the issue against the party; and (B) grant\na motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a\nclaim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be main-\ntained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 9 of 34\n5914 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthe search would violate neither Byrd’s substantive due pro-\ncess nor his Fourth Amendment rights as a matter of law. The\ncourt denied Byrd’s cross motions for judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\nIn light of these rulings, the district court submitted three\nissues  to  the  jury:  (1)  whether  Byrd  had  proved  that\nO’Connell “deprived him of his right against unreasonable\nsearch[es] by intentionally squeezing or kneading his penis or\nscrotum or improperly touching his anus through his under-\nwear”; (2) whether O’Connell deprived Byrd of due process\nof law by taking any inappropriate actions during the search,6\nwhich actions had inflicted pain on Byrd, and which infliction\nwas wanton; and (3) whether O’Connell violated Byrd’s right\nagainst unreasonable searches “by conducting a search not\ndone  for  [an]  identified  security  need.”  The  district  court\ninstructed the jury that it could draw an inference adverse to\na  party  who  destroyed  evidence,  but  declined  to  give  the\ninstruction proposed by Byrd’s counsel.\nThe jury found against Byrd on each of the issues, and the\ncourt entered judgment for all defendants. This timely appeal\nfollowed. On appeal, Byrd challenges the district court’s dis-\nmissal of his equal protection claim, certain evidentiary rul-\nings, and its grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of\nArpaio and O’Connell as to the constitutionality of the search.7\nII\n[1] We first address whether the district court erred in its\n6As in the first issue, the jury was instructed to determine whether\n“O’Connell intentionally squeezed or kneaded [Byrd’s] penis or scrotum\nor improperly touched his anus through his underwear.”\n7We reject the County’s assertion that the issues on appeal are limited\nby rules governing in forma pauperis proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. §1915.\nByrd did not proceed in forma pauperis in bringing his appeal, and this\ncourt’s records reflect that all appropriate fees have been paid. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 10 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5915\nsua sponte dismissal under 28 U.S.C. §1915(e) of Byrd’s\nequal  protection  claim.  The  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act\nstates that “[n]otwithstanding any filing fee, or any portion\nthereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss the\ncase at any time if the court determines that . . . the action or\nappeal . . . fails to state a claim on which relief may be grant-\ned.” 28 U.S.C. §1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review de novo a dis-\ntrict court’s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim\nunder 28 U.S.C. §1915(e). Barren v. Harrington, 152 F.3d\n1193, 1194 (9th Cir. 1998) (order). “Factual allegations in the\ncomplaint are taken as true and all reasonable inferences are\ndrawn in the plaintiff’s favor.” Barrett v. Belleque, 544 F.3d\n1060, 1061 (9th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).\nIn dismissing Count II, the district court held that Byrd had\n“failed to allege that he is a member of a suspect class,” and\nthat Byrd “had neither alleged nor demonstrated that Defen-\ndants’ conduct was the result of purposeful or invidious dis-\ncrimination, or that the conduct bore no rational relationship\nto a legitimate government interest.”\n[2] We have held that “§1983 claims based on Equal Pro-\ntection violations must plead intentional unlawful discrimina-\ntion or allege facts that are at least susceptible of an inference\nof discriminatory intent.” Monteiro v. Tempe Union High Sch.\nDist., 158 F.3d 1022, 1026 (9th Cir. 1998). Even construing\nByrd’s pro se complaint liberally, see Eldridge v. Block, 832\nF.2d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir. 1987), it fails to allege facts suscep-\ntible to an inference that “defendants acted with an intent or\npurpose to discriminate against the plaintiff based upon mem-\nbership in a protected class,” Barren, 152 F.3d at 1194. While\nByrd alleged that a female searched him, he fatally “failed to\nallege that defendants’ acts or omissions were motivated by\ndiscriminatory animus toward” male prisoners. Lee v.

MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nIII\nWe next address Byrd’s challenges to the district court’s\nevidentiary rulings. We review a district court’s evidentiary\ndecisions, which include whether and how to sanction parties\nfor destruction of evidence, for an abuse of discretion. Med.\nLab. Mgmt. Consultants v. Am. Broad. Co., 306 F.3d 806, 824\n(9th  Cir.  2002).  In  addition  to  showing  the  district  court\nabused its discretion, “the appellant is . . . required to estab-\nlish that the error was prejudicial.” Tritchler v. County of\nLake, 358 F.3d 1150, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004). We will reverse\nthe district court only if an erroneous ruling “more likely than\nnot affected the verdict.” United States v. Pang, 362 F.3d\n1187, 1192 (9th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nByrd  challenges  the  district  court’s  decision  to  admit  the\nVideo Yearbook into evidence, as well as its refusal to give\nhis proposed adverse inference jury instruction regarding the\nCounty’s alleged destruction of the unedited footage. We con-\nsider these issues in turn. \nA\nFirst, Byrd argues the district court erred by permitting the\nCounty to introduce the Video Yearbook. According to Byrd,\nthe video was irrelevant because it does not include footage\nof O’Connell searching Byrd, or indeed, of O’Connell con-\nducting any of the searches she performed that day. More-\nover, Byrd argues that the video was prejudicial because it\npresented the cadets in a highly flattering light. Finally, Byrd\nasserts  that  the  Video  Yearbook  was  misleading  because\nsearches depicted in the video showed cadets performing fully\nclothed searches on their supervisors, rather than the search of\nByrd in his underwear. Byrd contends that the prejudicial and\nmisleading effect of the video outweighs its limited or non-\nexistent  probative  value,  and  therefore,  the  district  court\nabused its discretion by allowing it to be shown to the jury.\n[3] We disagree. Evidence that is otherwise admissible may\nbe excluded if “its probative value is substantially outweighed\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 12 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5917\nby the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading  the  jury,  or  by  considerations  of  undue  delay,\nwaste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-\ndence.” Fed. R. Evid. 403. However, evidence that may have\nbeen otherwise excluded under Rule 403 may become admis-\nsible based on events at trial. “Under the rule of curative\nadmissibility, or the ‘opening the door’ doctrine, the introduc-\ntion of inadmissible evidence by one party allows an oppo-\nnent, in the court’s discretion, to introduce evidence on the\nsame  issue  to  rebut  any  false  impression  that  might  have\nresulted from the earlier admission.” United States v. Whit-\nworth, 856 F.2d 1268, 1285 (9th Cir. 1988); accord Jerden v.\nAmstutz, 430 F.3d 1231, 1239 n.9 (9th Cir. 2005).\n[4] At the pretrial hearing, after Byrd’s counsel objected to\nthe possible introduction of the Video Yearbook, the County\nindicated that it did not intend to offer the video as an exhibit\nunless Byrd’s counsel opened the door by insinuating that the\nCounty  videotaped  the  particular  search  of  Byrd  and  then\nerased it. In his opening statement, Byrd’s counsel indicated\nthat the County’s alleged destruction of the tape would be an\nissue at trial, stating, “You will learn that this training demon-\nstration on Mr. Byrd was videotaped but that the portion of\nthe tape has now been erased.” During direct examination, the\nfollowing  exchange  occurred  between  Arpaio  and  Byrd’s\ncounsel:\nQ: [B]eing in law enforcement, you would agree that\nofficers must preserve all evidence which is critical\nto inmate’s complaints.\nA: Yes.\nQ: And you would agree that it would be improper,\nactually illegal, to lose evidence to cover up wrong-\ndoing; correct, sir?\nA: To cover up wrongdoing?\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 13 of 34\n5918 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nQ: Yes.\nA: Yes. \nBased on this line of questioning, the district court found that\nByrd’s counsel was laying the foundation for an instruction\npermitting the jury to infer that any missing evidence, namely,\nthe complete video footage recorded that day, was damaging\nto the County. Therefore, the district court held that Byrd’s\ncounsel  had  opened  the  door  for  the  County  to  show  the\nVideo Yearbook so the jury could determine whether the orig-\ninal video tape was likely or unlikely to contain what Byrd\nalleged. Byrd’s counsel subsequently played the video during\nclosing argument in an effort to prove the searches conducted\non the day in question were for training purposes rather than\nsecurity purposes. \n[5] Because Byrd opened the door to the introduction of\nthis evidence, the district court did not abuse its broad discre-\ntion  in  admitting  the  Video  Yearbook  as  an  exhibit.  See\nUnited States v. Segall, 833 F.2d 144, 148 (9th Cir. 1987).\nThe Video Yearbook was relevant to rebut Byrd’s assertion in\nopening  argument,  and  suggestion  during  Arpaio’s  direct\nexamination, that the original tape depicted an abusive search\nand had been improperly edited or destroyed. Moreover, Byrd\nhas not demonstrated that any unfair prejudice substantially\noutweighed the video’s value, or that the verdict would have\nbeen any different absent the video.\nB\nByrd next argues the district court erred in its formulation\nof an adverse inference instruction. Byrd requested that the\ndistrict court provide the following instruction: \nThe  Maricopa  County  Sheriff’s  Office  video\nrecorded academy class 813’s search of the Durango\nJail, Housing Unit 4, on October 28, 2004. On that\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 14 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5919\nsame day, Mr. Byrd filed a complaint with the Mari-\ncopa County Sheriff’s Office alleging that a female\ncadet  had  sexually  assaulted  him.  The  Maricopa\nCounty Sheriff’s Office erased the video footage of\nacademy  class  813’s  search  of  the  Durango  Jail,\nHousing Unit 4, despite actual notice of Mr. Byrd’s\nclaims and allegations. The Maricopa County Sher-\niff’s Office’s destruction of the footage demonstrates\nthat the academy class’s search was done solely for\ntraining purposes and that Ms. O’Connell grabbed\nMr. Byrd’s penis, scrotum and testicles, and inserted\nher finger into Mr. Byrd’s anus. [altered to correct\nthe spelling of “Sheriff”].\nThe district court agreed to give an adverse inference instruc-\ntion, but provided the following to the jury: \nA party who has timely notice of the assertion of a\nclaim has a duty to take reasonable efforts to pre-\nserve evidence. If a party with such notice fails to\npreserve evidence through some fault of its own, you\nmay draw an inference that the evidence not pre-\nserved would have been favorable to the opposing\nparty.\n[6] Byrd argues that this instruction is inadequate because\nit did not direct the jury to make an adverse inference against\nthe County. We disagree. The district court’s instruction accu-\nrately stated the law and was adequate to allow the jury to\ndetermine whether an adverse inference against the County\nwas warranted. “A court is not required to use the exact words\nproposed by a party, incorporate every proposition of law sug-\ngested by counsel or amplify an instruction if the instructions\nas given allowed the jury to determine intelligently the issues\npresented.” Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l\nFootball League, 726 F.2d 1381, 1398 (9th Cir. 1984). More-\nover, Byrd was not entitled to an instruction that directed the\njury to reach a conclusion about matters of disputed fact. Rob-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 15 of 34\n5920 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nerts v. Spalding, 783 F.2d 867, 873 (9th Cir. 1986). Because\nthe district court found that the applicability of the adverse\ninference  instruction  turned  on  disputed  facts,  the  court’s\ndecision to give the instruction in the abstract and allow the\nparties to argue to the jury whether the facts supported its\napplication was not an abuse of the district court’s broad dis-\ncretion.\nIV\nWe next turn to Byrd’s argument that the district court\nerred in granting judgment as a matter of law in favor of\nArpaio and O’Connell. Byrd contends that, notwithstanding\nthe jury’s findings, the search, and in particular the cross-\ngender aspect of it, violated both his substantive due process\nright to be free from punishment and his Fourth Amendment\nright to be free from unreasonable searches.8 “We review de\nnovo an order granting or denying judgment as a matter of\nlaw.”Quiksilver, Inc. v. Kymsta Corp., 466 F.3d 749, 755 (9th\nCir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). “In considering\na motion under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-\ndure, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor\nof that party.” E.E.O.C. v. Pacific Maritime Ass’n, 351 F.3d\n1270,  1272  (9th  Cir.  2003).  Judgment  as  a  matter  of  law\n“should be granted when the evidence permits only one rea-\nsonable conclusion as to the verdict. If conflicting inferences\nmay be drawn from the facts, the case must go to the jury.”\nRedman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1439 (9th\n8The County contends that Byrd has waived any challenge to the spe-\ncific search at issue here and is challenging only the County’s general pol-\nicy allowing cross-gender searches. We reject this argument. Byrd argued\nboth before the district court and on appeal that the search conducted by\nO’Connell  violated  his  constitutional  rights,  and  he  pursued  a  claim\nagainst Arpaio in both his individual and official capacities. We read\nByrd’s appeal as challenging both the search to which he was subjected\nand the alleged County policy which putatively caused it to occur. See,\ne.g., Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 16 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5921\nCir. 1991) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\nOur review is sharply circumscribed by Bell v. Wolfish, 441\nU.S. 520 (1979), in which the Supreme Court upheld visual\nbody cavity searches of pretrial detainees against their Fourth\nand  Fourteenth  Amendment  challenges.  Under  Bell,  when\nreviewing conditions and restrictions placed on prisoners and\npretrial detainees, we must bear in mind the inherent difficul-\nties in managing a detention facility, and that “the problems\nthat arise in the day-to-day operation of a corrections facility\nare not susceptible of easy solutions.” Id. at 547. Judicial def-\nerence to prison officials is appropriate on the grounds that\n“the realities of running a corrections institution are complex\nand difficult, courts are ill equipped to deal with these prob-\nlems, and the management of these facilities is confided to the\nExecutive  and  Legislative  Branches,  not  to  the  Judicial\nBranch.” Id. at 548 n.29. Therefore, “in the absence of sub-\nstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave  exaggerated  their  response  to  these  considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.” Id. at 540 n.23 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn light of these principles, our task is to determine whether\nthe district court erred in holding that, as a matter of law, nei-\nther  Maricopa  County  nor  the  individual  defendants\n(O’Connell and Arpaio in his individual capacity) violated\nByrd’s  constitutional  rights.9  We  must  also  undertake  our\nreview in light of the jury’s factual determinations that the\nsearch was performed for an “identified security need,” and\nthat O’Connell did not search Byrd in an inappropriate man-\nner. Byrd does not challenge these findings on appeal, and\ntherefore we are bound by them. \n9The defendants sued in their individual capacities did not assert quali-\nfied immunity in district court, and accordingly we do not consider the\nissue on appeal. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 17 of 34\n5922 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nA\nWe first consider Byrd’s argument that the search violated\nhis substantive due process right to be free from punishment.\nByrd contends the search at issue amounted to punishment\nbecause it was conducted by a woman despite the availability\nof men; he was not told that O’Connell was associated with\nthe jail system; jail officials carried taser and pepper guns,\ncursed at him, and ordered him to remain silent; and a person\nwith a hand-held camera was present. Moreover, Byrd states\nthat he suffers from a history of sexual abuse, and therefore\nthe cross-gender aspect of the search was particularly trau-\nmatic. Byrd asserts that the prison officials displayed deliber-\nate indifference to the harm the search would cause him, both\nbecause any person would know that the circumstances of this\nsearch would cause shock, degradation, and pain, and because\nthese consequences were easily preventable by having male\nofficials who were standing nearby conduct the search. \n[7] When the government holds a person in confinement as\na pretrial detainee, it “may subject him to the restrictions and\nconditions of the detention facility so long as those conditions\nand restrictions do not amount to punishment or otherwise\nviolate the Constitution,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 536-37, because\n“under the Due Process Clause, a detainee may not be pun-\nished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance with due\nprocess of law,” id. at 535; accord Demery v. Arpaio, 378\nF.3d 1020, 1028 (9th Cir. 2004). This standard is different\nfrom that applied to prisoners, “who may be subject to pun-\nishment so long as it does not violate the Eighth Amend-\nment’s bar against cruel and unusual punishment.” Pierce v.\nCounty of Orange, 526 F.3d 1190, 1205 (9th Cir. 2008) (cit-\ning Bell, 441 U.S. at 535 n.16). “Because pretrial detainees’\nrights under the Fourteenth Amendment are comparable to\nprisoners’ rights under the Eighth Amendment, however, we\napply the same standards.” Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124,\n1128 (9th Cir. 1998). \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 18 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5923\nWhen prisoners challenge conditions or deprivations asso-\nciated with their confinement, a court must consider the two\ncomponents of an Eighth Amendment claim: (1) the objective\ncomponent, which addresses whether the deprivation was suf-\nficiently serious to constitute “cruel and unusual” punishment;\nand (2) the subjective component, which addresses whether\nthe prison officials acted with “a sufficiently culpable state of\nmind.” Wilson  v.  Seiter,  501  U.S.  294,  298  (1991).  The\nSupreme Court explained that the latter intent requirement did\nnot emanate from “the predilections of this Court, but the\nEighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual\npunishment. If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as\npunishment by the statute or the sentencing judge, some men-\ntal element must be attributed to the inflicting officer before\nit can qualify” as punitive. Id. at 300 (emphases in original).\n[8] The same intent requirement is applicable in the pretrial\ndetainee  context:  the  Supreme  Court  has  explained  that\nwhether  a  particular  action  or  condition  of  confinement\namounts to punishment turns on whether the action taken, or\ncondition imposed, was accompanied by punitive intent. See\nBell, 441 U.S. at 538-39.\nPunitive intent may be proven in various ways. It is most\nobvious  when  an  official  expresses  an  intent  to  punish  a\ndetainee. See id. at 538. When there is no evidence “of an\nexpressed intent to punish on the part of detention facility\nofficials,” punitive intent can be inferred. Id. If “a restriction\nor condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal—if\nit is arbitrary or purposeless—a court permissibly may infer\nthat the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that\nmay  not  constitutionally  be  inflicted  upon  detainees  qua\ndetainees.” Id. at 539; see also Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S.\n576, 584 (1984). When detention facility officials are person-\nally accused of depriving incarcerated persons of “the mini-\nmal  civilized  measure  of  life’s  necessities,” Rhodes  v.\nChapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981), or exposing them to\n“conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,” Farmer\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 19 of 34\n5924 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nv. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 (1994), punitive intent can be\ninferred  from  an  officer’s  “deliberate  indifference”  to  the\nharm caused. See Seiter, 501 U.S. at 302-03 (explaining the\napplicability of the deliberate indifference standard to pris-\noner cases); Frost, 152 F.3d at 1128 (explaining the applica-\nbility  of  the  deliberate  indifference  standard  to  cases\ninvolving pretrial detainees). A detention facility official acts\nwith “deliberate indifference” if “he knows that inmates face\na substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by\nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.” Farmer, 511\nU.S. at 847; accord Frost, 152 F.3d at 1128. “[T]he official\nmust both be aware of facts from which the inference could\nbe drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 837. \n[9] Byrd has not alleged or adduced any evidence indicat-\ning that O’Connell or Arpaio expressed an intent to punish\nhim. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 538. Therefore, in order to prevail\non his substantive due process claim, Byrd must present evi-\ndence  from  which  an  inference  of  punitive  intent  may  be\ndrawn. See id. at 538-39; Farmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Byrd con-\ntends  that  we  should  draw  such  an  inference  in  this  case\nbecause the search in question is analogous to those we struck\ndown in Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F.2d 1521 (9th Cir. 1993)\n(en banc). \nIn Jordan, a prison had instituted a policy requiring “male\nguards  to  conduct  random,  non-emergency,  suspicionless\nclothed body searches on female prisoners.” 986 F.2d at 1522\n(footnote omitted). The searches were aggressive and intru-\nsive:\nAccording to the prison training material, “a guard\n[was] to use a flat hand and pushing motion across\nthe inmate’s crotch area.” The guard [was to] “push\ninward and upward when searching the crotch and\nupper thighs of the inmate.” All seams in the leg and\nthe crotch area [were] to be “squeezed and kneaded.”\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 20 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5925\nUsing the back of the hand, the guard also [was] to\nsearch the breast area in a sweeping motion, so that\nthe breasts [would] be “flattened.”\nId. at 1523 (alterations and internal citations omitted). \nIn evaluating whether the policy in Jordan violated the\nEighth Amendment’s ban on “unnecessary and wanton inflic-\ntion of pain,” we first considered the objective component of\nan Eighth Amendment claim by addressing whether the depri-\nvation was sufficiently serious. We concluded that the district\ncourt’s finding that the searches constituted the “infliction of\npain” on the female inmates was not clearly erroneous, in\nlight of substantial evidence that many of the female inmates\nhad been violently sexually abused prior to their incarceration\nand were psychologically fragile, and that the cross-gender\nsearches would cause some inmates substantial suffering. Id.\nat 1525-26. The evidence included extensive expert testimony\nfrom “staff  members,  social  workers,  psychologists,  an\nanthropologist,  and  the  former  Director  of  Corrections  for\nfour different states at various times.” Id. at 1526. One expert\ntestified that “the unwilling submission to bodily contact with\nthe breasts and genitals by men would likely leave the inmate\n‘revictimized,’ resulting in a number of symptoms of post-\ntraumatic stress disorder.” Id. (alteration omitted). This evi-\ndence was corroborated by inmates’ testimony, as well as evi-\ndence that one inmate who was searched “had to have her\nfingers  pried  loose  from  bars  she  had  grabbed  during  the\nsearch, and she vomited after returning to her cell block.” Id.\nat 1523. \nWe then considered the subjective component of an Eighth\nAmendment claim by addressing whether the prison officials\nhad acted with “deliberate indifference.” Id. at 1527. We con-\ncluded that they had, id. at 1530, basing this conclusion on\nevidence that the policymaker at the prison was aware of the\nrisk of psychological trauma to the female inmates, but never-\ntheless proceeded with the implementation of the search pol-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 21 of 34\n5926 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nicy, id. at 1528-29. Specifically, the prison policymaker “was\nurged by members of his own staff not to institute cross-\ngender clothed body searches due to the psychological trauma\nwhich  many  inmates  likely  would  suffer.” Id. at  1528.  In\naddition, a court order was required to stop the practice “al-\nthough  one  of  the  first  inmates  to  be  searched  suffered  a\nsevere reaction.” Id. at 1528-29. We also held that the search\npolicy  was  “unnecessary”  because  the  facility’s  “security\n[was] not dependent upon” cross-gender searches; nor did the\nsearches “ensure equal employment opportunities  for male\nguards.” Id. at 1526-27. \n[10] Applying the Jordan framework here, the prison offi-\ncials did not have the mental state necessary for their actions\nto constitute punishment. Taking the evidence and all infer-\nences in the light most favorable to Byrd, see Redman, 942\nF.2d at 1439, there is no evidence in the record that would\nallow a rational jury to conclude that either O’Connell or\nArpaio knew  the  cross-gender  aspect  of  the  search  would\ncause Byrd harm, or that either of them “disregard[ed] that\nrisk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it,” Far-\nmer, 511 U.S. at 847. Arpaio testified that in over 15 years,\nthere had never been a problem with a male being searched\nby a female, and the record does not show otherwise. Byrd\ndid not indicate to anyone at the jail before or during the\nsearch that he had a history of sexual abuse, and there is no\nevidence that anyone at the jail was aware of this history.\nMoreover, O’Connell testified that she had searched a “couple\nhundred” men in the same manner, and no man had ever\nadversely reacted to a search. Therefore, Byrd has not shown\nthat either O’Connell or Arpaio acted with deliberate indiffer-\nence in conducting the search. \nFinally (and as discussed in more detail infra pp. 5934-37),\nbecause the search was reasonably related to the County’s\nlegitimate security needs, as found by the jury, and because\nthe County had a legitimate operational basis for permitting\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 22 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5927\ncross-gender searches, we cannot infer that the purpose of the\nsearch was punitive. Bell, 441 U.S. at 561.\n[11] Because the search was reasonably related to legiti-\nmate governmental needs, and because Byrd has pointed to no\nevidence from which a rational jury could conclude that it was\nconducted with “deliberate indifference” to pain the cross-\ngender aspect of the search might cause, it did not constitute\npunishment. Therefore we must conclude that neither Arpaio\nnor O’Connell violated Byrd’s substantive due process rights.\nCf. Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1527-30. Accordingly, we need not\nconsider the objective component of Byrd’s claim (the degree\nof deprivation or harm), or whether a pretrial detainee may be\nable to bring a Fourteenth Amendment substantive due pro-\ncess claim based on evidence of a less severe deprivation or\nharm than would be necessary to establish an Eighth Amend-\nment “cruel  and  unusual”  punishment  claim.  See  id.  at\n1525-26.\n[12] Because Byrd has suffered no substantive due process\ndeprivation, his claim against Maricopa County necessarily\nfails. Byrd has not alleged that any action apart from the\ncross-gender search performed by O’Connell violated his sub-\nstantive due process rights, and “[n]either a municipality nor\na supervisor . .. can be held liable under §1983 where no\ninjury or constitutional violation has occurred.” Jackson v.\nCity of Bremerton, 268 F.3d 646, 653 (9th Cir. 2001); see also\nCity of Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S. 796, 799 (1986);\nQuintanilla v. City of Downey, 84 F.3d 353, 356 (9th Cir.\n1996); cf.  Fairley  v.  Luman,  281  F.3d  913,  917  (9th  Cir.\n2002) (per curiam) (holding that a city may be liable under\n§1983 even when individual officials are exonerated, if a\nconstitutional deprivation was attributable to city action or\ninaction).  We  therefore  affirm  the  district  court’s  grant  of\njudgment as a matter of law to Arpaio and O’Connell on\nByrd’s substantive due process claim. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 23 of 34\n5928 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nB\nWe next turn to the question whether the district court erred\nin holding that the search was reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment as a matter of law, notwithstanding its cross-\ngender aspect. Again, we are bound by the jury’s unchal-\nlenged findings that the search in question was for security\npurposes and that O’Connell did not conduct it inappropriately.10\nWe take all other evidence and the inferences therefrom in the\nlight most favorable to Byrd. See Redman, 942 F.2d at 1439.\nHowever, “we must distinguish between evidence of disputed\nfacts  and  disputed  matters  of  professional  judgment.  In\nrespect to the latter, our inferences must accord deference to\nthe views of prison authorities.” Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S.\n521, 530 (2006) (plurality op.); see also Overton v. Bazzetta,\n539 U.S. 126, 132 (2003). As noted above, this is due in part\nto the “difficulty of operating a detention facility safely, [and]\nthe seriousness of the risk of smuggled weapons and contra-\nband.” Way v. County of Ventura, 445 F.3d 1157, 1161 (9th\nCir. 2006); see also Bell, 441 U.S. at 548 n.29. \nWe agree with Byrd’s contention that we must analyze his\nclaim in light of both Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) and\nBell. The Supreme Court in Bell assumed, without deciding,\nthat pretrial detainees retain Fourth Amendment rights, 441\nU.S. at 558, but subsequently held in Hudson v. Palmer that\n“the  Fourth  Amendment  proscription  against  unreasonable\nsearches  does  not  apply  within  the  confines  of  the  prison\ncell.” 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984). We have held that the Fourth\nAmendment does apply to the invasion of bodily privacy in\nprisons, but the “reasonableness of a particular search is deter-\nmined by reference to the prison context.” Michenfelder v.\nSumner, 860 F.2d 328, 332 (9th Cir. 1988). The government\n“may restrict or withdraw rights to the extent necessary to fur-\n10To avoid confusion, we reiterate that the district court’s Rule 50 hold-\ning was contingent upon the jury finding that O’Connell did not perform\nthe search inappropriately and that it was performed for a security reason.\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 24 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5929\nther the correctional system’s legitimate goals and policies.”\nGrummet v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 493 (9th Cir. 1985).\n[13] In considering Fourth Amendment claims, Bell man-\ndates a “test of reasonableness,” which “requires a balancing\nof the need for the particular search against the invasion of\npersonal rights that the search entails.” 441 U.S. at 559. In\nevaluating Fourth Amendment claims brought by incarcerated\npersons, Bell directs us to consider: (1) “the scope of the par-\nticular intrusion”; (2) “the manner in which it is conducted”;\n(3) “the justification for initiating it”; and (4) “the place in\nwhich  it  is  conducted.” Id.  In  Turner,  the  Court  provided\nmore  guidance  regarding  Bell’s  reasonableness  standard,\nholding that “when a prison regulation impinges on inmates’\nconstitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably\nrelated to legitimate penological interests.” 482 U.S. at 89.\nThe Court set forth several factors as being “relevant in deter-\nmining the reasonableness” of a prison regulation or practice:\n(1) “there must be a valid, rational connection between the\nprison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put\nforward to justify it”; (2) “whether there are alternative means\nof exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates”;\n(3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\nright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the alloca-\ntion of prison resources generally,” which, if the impact is\nsubstantial, requires particular deference to corrections offi-\ncials; and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives” as evidence\nof the reasonableness of a prison regulation, or “the existence\nof obvious, easy alternatives” as evidence that the regulation\n“is an ‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns.” Id. at 89-91\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nThere are limits to the applicability of the reasonableness\nfactors outlined in Turner. We have not applied Turner to a\npretrial detainee’s Fourteenth Amendment claim of punish-\nment, see Demery, 378 F.3d at 1028, and Turner is not appli-\ncable to all prisoner challenges based on a deprivation of\nconstitutional rights, see Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499,\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 25 of 34\n5930 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\n510-11 (2005) (declining to apply Turner to the right not to\nbe discriminated against on the basis of race and indicating it\nmay not be applicable to Eighth Amendment claims of cruel\nand unusual punishment). However, Turner is applicable to\n“rights that are inconsistent with proper incarceration,” John-\nson, 543 U.S. at 510 (internal quotation marks omitted), and\n“courts  have  applied  the  Turner test  to  prisoners’  Fourth\nAmendment claims,” Thompson v. Souza, 111 F.3d 694, 699\n(9th Cir. 1997); see also Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 332-33.\nAdditionally, we have applied Turner to prisoners’ challenges\narguing that cross-gender strip searches violated their right to\nprivacy. Michenfelder, 860 F.2d at 333-34.\n[14] Logically, a pretrial detainee is entitled, at a minimum,\nto the same protection of constitutional rights as would be\navailable to a convicted inmate under the Turner framework.\nBell, 441 U.S. at 545 (“[P]retrial detainees, who have not been\nconvicted of any crimes, retain at least those constitutional\nrights that we have held are enjoyed by convicted prison-\ners.”); see also Jones v. Johnson, 781 F.2d 769, 771 (9th Cir.\n1986). Therefore, although Turner considered only the rights\nof convicted prisoners, its framework is relevant to analyzing\nthe constitutional rights of pretrial detainees, and we have\nlooked to it in the past. See Pierce, 526 F.3d at 1209 (analyz-\ning religious freedom rights of pretrial detainees under Tur-\nner); Mauro v. Arpaio, 188 F.3d 1054, 1059 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(en  banc)  (analyzing  First  Amendment  rights  of  pretrial\ndetainees under Turner).\nFor  these  reasons,  in  reviewing  the  reasonableness  of  a\nsearch,  we  are  guided  by  Turner’s  direction  to  consider\nwhether the challenged conduct was “reasonably related to\nlegitimate penological interests.” Turner, 482 U.S. at 89; see\nalso Thompson, 111 F.3d at 699-700 (applying Turner and\nBell to Fourth Amendment claim). In evaluating whether the\nsearch meets this test, we are mindful of the “scope of the par-\nticular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the jus-\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 26 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5931\ntification  for  initiating  it,  and  the  place  in  which  it  is\nconducted.” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559. \n[15] Beginning with the first factor of Turner’s reasonable-\nrelation test, the jury found that the search was done for an\nidentified security need. There is no dispute that the County’s\nsecurity-related need to respond to reports of contraband and\nfighting in Byrd’s housing unit is a “legitimate governmental\ninterest,” or that the reports of contraband and fighting are\nrationally connected to, and a valid justification for, conduct-\ning the pat down and partial strip searches. 482 U.S. at 89; see\nalso Bell, 441 U.S. at 546-47 (“Central to all other correction\ngoals  is  the  institutional  consideration  of  internal  security\nwithin the corrections facilities themselves.” (quoting Pell v.\nProcunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974) (alteration omitted))).11\n[16] Moving to the Bell factors, the scope of the search was\nreasonable given the County’s suspicion of contraband circu-\nlating in the jail, and inmates’ ability to conceal contraband\nin private areas. In Bell, the Court held that visual body cavity\nsearches were justified by the detention facility officials’ need\nto detect contraband and maintain security, even though there\nhad been only one incident of attempted contraband smug-\ngling. 441 U.S. at 559. We have upheld similar searches of\nincarcerated  persons  against  constitutional  challenges.  See\nRickman  v.  Avaniti,  854  F.2d  327,  328  (9th  Cir.  1988)\n(approving same-gender strip searches conducted in cells of\nprisoners housed in administrative segregation prior to leav-\ning cell); see also Thompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (holding same-\ngender body-cavity search did not violate clearly established\nrights). Nor did the place of the search make it unreasonable.\n11The second Turner factor, “whether there are alternative means of\nexercising the right that remain open to prison inmates,” 482 U.S. at 90,\nis not applicable in the Fourth Amendment context, because the right to\nbe free from unreasonable searches is not a right susceptible to exercise\nby alternative means, see Thompson, 111 F.3d at 699; Michenfelder, 860\nF.2d at 331 n.1. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 27 of 34\n5932 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nWe have upheld strip searches even when they took place in\nview of others, in light of institutional needs and realities. See\nThompson, 111 F.3d at 701 (rejecting argument that same-\ngender strip search and visual body cavity search should have\nbeen  conducted  out  of  view  of  other  prisoners  who  were\nlaughing or whistling); Michenfelder, 860 F.2d 328 (uphold-\ning prison’s same-gender visual body cavity searches when-\never an inmate left or returned to the maximum security unit,\nnotwithstanding fact that strip searches were conducted at the\nend of a hallway). \n[17] The manner of this search requires closer scrutiny,\nhowever, because Byrd alleges the cross-gender aspect of the\nsearch makes it unreasonable. We have recognized that the\n“desire  to  shield  one’s  unclothed  figure[]  from  view  of\nstrangers, and particularly strangers of the opposite sex, is\nimpelled  by  elementary  self-respect  and  personal  dignity.”\nYork v. Story, 324 F.2d 450, 455 (9th Cir. 1963); see also\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334 (stating that this court recog-\nnizes “that incarcerated prisoners retain a limited right to bod-\nily privacy” in the context of being viewed by members of the\nopposite sex); Grummet, 779 F.2d at 494 (same). Yet, while\nwe  have  not  foreclosed  the  possibility  that  a  cross-gender\nsearch could violate an incarcerated person’s constitutional\nrights, we have noted that “our prior case law suggests that\nprisoners’ legitimate expectations of bodily privacy from per-\nsons of the opposite sex are extremely limited.” Jordan, 986\nF.2d at 1524. We have never held that a cross-gender search\nin a prison setting violated an inmate’s Fourth Amendment\nrights. See Grummet, 779 F.2d at 496; Jordan, 986 F.2d at\n1524; cf. Somers v. Thurman, 109 F.3d 614, 620 (9th Cir.\n1997) (in context of qualified immunity, holding right to be\nfree of cross-gender searches not clearly established). Rather,\nwe have upheld cross-gender visual observations and body\nsearches in certain circumstances. \n[18] In Grummet, we upheld a policy permitting female\nofficers to conduct pat-down searches of male prisoners when\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 28 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5933\nthe searches were “done briefly”; “in a professional manner\nand with respect for the inmates”; and performed on inmates\nwho were “fully clothed, and thus [did] not involve intimate\ncontact with the inmates’ bodies.” 779 F.2d at 496. The prison\ndid not require female officers to “conduct or observe strip or\nbody cavity searches” except in emergencies. Id.We addition-\nally upheld a policy when women were assigned to positions\nrequiring “infrequent and casual observation” of unclothed\nmale prisoners in their cells and while showering. Id. at 494.\nWe noted that preventing females from working in positions\nthat would require occasional invasions of inmates’ privacy\n“would  necessitate  a  tremendous  rearrangement  of  work\nschedules, and possibly produce a risk to both internal secur-\nity needs and equal employment opportunities for the female\nguards.” Id. at 496. Under these circumstances, we concluded\nthat “the inmates have not demonstrated that these restricted\nobservations by members of the opposite sex are so degrading\nas to require intervention by this court,” id. at 495, or that the\nsearches were “so offensive as to be unreasonable under the\nfourth amendment,” id. at 496. \n[19] In Michenfelder, we rejected a prisoner’s argument\nthat a prison invaded his right to privacy due to a policy per-\nmitting the presence of female officers during visual body\ncavity searches in hallways, and permitting females to work\nin  positions  that  allowed  observation  of  unclothed  male\ninmates. 860 F.2d at 334. In determining whether the policies\nwere reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, we\n“recognize[d]  as  legitimate  both  the  interest  in  providing\nequal employment opportunities and the security interest in\ndeploying available staff effectively.” Id. We upheld the strip-\nsearch  policy  because  female  officers  were  not  “routinely\npresent for [the] strip searches” and did not “regularly or fre-\nquently observe unclothed inmates without a legitimate rea-\nson for doing so.” Id. We also upheld females’ placement in\npositions that included “shower duty,” because female offi-\ncers’ presence “did not establish an inappropriate amount of\ncontact with disrobed prisoners.” Id. We reasoned, in part,\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 29 of 34\n5934 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nthat “[p]rohibiting female employees from working” in areas\nthat allowed observation of unclothed inmates, or “requiring\n[female employees] to be replaced by males for the duration\nof strip searches, would displace officers throughout the pris-\non.” Id. (stating that the “third Turner v. Safley factor has spe-\ncial relevance here”).\nByrd argues the search in question is distinguishable from\nthose we upheld in Michenfelder and Grummet. He contends\nthe cross-gender aspect of the specific search at issue was not\nreasonable,  but  rather  was  an  “‘exaggerated  response’  to\nprison concerns,” Turner, 482 U.S. at 90, because of the inva-\nsiveness of the search and the ready availability of male offi-\ncials  to  conduct  it.  Because  the  male  officials  were\nimmediately available, he asserts there would have been no\nimpact on the jail’s allocation of resources or on its procedure\nfor meeting security needs if a male, rather than a female, had\nsearched him. Byrd further argues that the cross-gender ele-\nment of the search was not justified by the County’s need to\nprovide  equal  employment  opportunities  to  female  prison\nofficials. He cites testimony from County witnesses that they\nwere not aware of any incident in which a female officer’s\nemployment  opportunities  were  hampered  as  a  result  of\naccommodations  to  protect  the  privacy  interests  of  male\ndetainees.\n[20]  Even  taking  all  facts  and  inferences  therefrom  in\nByrd’s favor, however, we cannot conclude that the manner\nof the search was unreasonable, or constituted an “exagger-\nated or excessive means to enforce security.” Thompson, 111\nF.3d at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted). As noted, the\njury found that the search was not done in an inappropriate\nmanner. The record indicates that O’Connell wore gloves at\nall times, and conducted the search professionally and swiftly,\nfinishing in, at most, 60 seconds. The invasion of Byrd’s bod-\nily  privacy  in  this  case  does  not  substantially  exceed  the\ncross-gender observations and searches we upheld in Michen-\nfelder and Grummet. Moreover, the County has provided a\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 30 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5935\nlegitimate  justification  for  the  cross-gender  aspect  of  the\nsearch:  the  County  adduced  undisputed  evidence  that  the\ncross-gender search was justified by its legitimate security\nand staffing needs, focusing primarily on the shortage of ade-\nquate personnel. Captain Peterson testified that the County\ndid not have sufficient numbers of male detention officers to\nconduct searches of male inmates, as required to meet safety\nand security needs, without the assistance of female officers.\nFurther, Peterson testified that the County was not able to\nobtain a greater number of male officers for these searches\nbecause it had difficulties hiring adequate staff, and because\nit  could  not  pull  male  officers  from  other  jail  facilities.\nCadets, including females, were regularly called to assist in\nmass  searches  “because  of  [the  need  for]  additional  man-\npower, and we have no other place to get it from except” from\nthe Academy. We have held that the County has a legitimate\n“security  interest  in  deploying  available  staff  effectively.”\nMichenfelder, 860 F.2d at 334. Accordingly, we cannot con-\nclude that the cross-gender search lacked a “valid, rational\nconnection” to the County’s legitimate justifications. Turner,\n482 U.S. at 89. \nTurning  to  the  impact  that  accommodation  of  Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights would have “on the allocation of\nprison resources generally,” id. at 90, Byrd contends that the\nsearch was an “‘exaggerated response’ to prison concerns”\nbecause the presence of male officials at the search provided\n“an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s right at\nde minimis cost to valid penological interests,” id. at 90-91.\nThis argument goes too far. A detention facility that hires\nboth male and female officers to meet its staffing needs will\nregularly have male officers, as well as female officers, avail-\nable at searches. The determination sought by Byrd, that it is\nper se unreasonable for a female officer to conduct searches\nof male inmates when male officers are also present, would\nsignificantly limit the usefulness of female officers for meet-\ning a detention facility’s security needs. In this case, such a\ndetermination  would  be  inconsistent  with  the  County’s\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 31 of 34\n5936 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\napproach to staffing and deploying its officers, and contrary\nto the County’s uncontradicted testimony that it has inade-\nquate male staff to meet its security needs, and must therefore\nuse both male and female officials to conduct searches on\nmale inmates. \n[21] Moreover, the County has already made a determina-\ntion regarding when it can reasonably accommodate cross-\ngender concerns: its policies prohibit cross-gender observa-\ntion and administration of unclothed strip and body cavity\nsearches,  and  its  policies  prohibit  visual  inspection  of\ninmates’ genitalia during a cross-gender pat down and partial\nstrip search. In light of the jury’s findings, and the “wide-\nranging deference” we owe to the County’s professional judg-\nment on these operational issues, Bell, 441 U.S. at 547, we\nconclude that the cross-gender search in question was not an\nexaggerated response to prison concerns.\nWe emphasize that the question whether the district court\nerred in granting the County’s motion for judgment as a mat-\nter of law is close. We are troubled by the overall circum-\nstances of the search in question. The scope of the search was\ninvasive in that it involved contact with Byrd’s genital region,\nalbeit through his boxer shorts. The embarrassment inherent\nin such a pat down and partial strip search was amplified by\nseveral factors: the cross-gender aspect; the fact that it took\nplace in the presence of many officers and cadets, one third\nof whom were female; and that it took place in the presence\nof a person with a hand-held camera, notwithstanding the fact\nthat the record does not give rise to the inference that Byrd’s\nsearch was recorded. \nYet, while prisoners and detainees retain “legitimate expec-\ntations of bodily privacy from persons of the opposite sex,”\nwe are obligated to acknowledge that such rights are “ex-\ntremely limited.” Jordan, 986 F.2d at 1524. The hallmark of\nthe Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, see, e.g., Bell, 441\nU.S. at 558, and we must assess reasonableness in the context\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 32 of 34\nBYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T 5937\nof  detention  settings  and  the  intractable  problems  facing\nprison administrators, see, e.g., Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-89. We\nreview this case in the additional light of the jury’s findings\nthat the search was not conducted in an inappropriate manner\nand that it was conducted for an identified security need; the\nundisputed evidence of the County’s staffing issues; and the\nCounty’s  existing  restrictions  on  cross-gender  contact\nbetween detention officers and inmates. We also take seri-\nously  the  Supreme  Court’s  direction  that,  in  reviewing\nsecurity-  and  operations-related  restrictions  or  conditions\nimposed by prisons, “courts must heed our warning that ‘such\nconsiderations are peculiarly within the province and profes-\nsional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of\nsubstantial evidence in the record to indicate that the officials\nhave  exaggerated  their  response  to  these  considerations,\ncourts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such\nmatters.’” Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n.23 (quoting Pell, 417 U.S.\nat 827 (alteration omitted)). Given these factors, even viewing\nthe facts (other than those found by the jury) in the light most\nfavorable to Byrd, we cannot conclude that the district court\nerred in determining that the search did not violate Byrd’s\nFourth Amendment rights. \nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\nFERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting: \nI concur in part and dissent in part. In particular, I concur\nin most of the well reasoned majority opinion, but dissent\nfrom  the  determination  in  part  IVB  that  the  cross-gender\nsearch was reasonable under the circumstances and was not a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. \nIn  my  view,  cross-gender  strip  searches  are  generally\nuncalled for and unreasonable. We have never held that any\ncross-gender strip search is proper, although we have allowed\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 33 of 34\n5938 BYRD v. MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEP’T\nfor  situations  where  female  guards  can  observe  unclothed\nmale prisoners,1 and have even approved of the pat down of\nfully clothed male prisoners by female guards.2 Moreover, in\none case we determined that a cross-gender search of clothed\nfemale prisoners by male guards was unconstitutional under\nthe circumstances presented in that case, but the basis of our\ndecision  was  not  the  Fourth  Amendment.  See Jordan  v.\nGardner, 986 F.2d 1521, 1523-26 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).\nI do not suggest that a cross-gender strip search can never\nbe appropriate. There may be emergency or other situations\nwhere a cross-gender strip search is proper, but this case pre-\nsents no facts to suggest that there was an emergency or some\nother unique reason for authorizing the search. In fact, the\nrecord shows that this sort of search is a regular part of the\njail’s routine,3 and that there were plenty of men available,\nwho could have conducted the search.4\nWhen all is said and done, I would not think it was reason-\nable for males to strip search females in this kind of situation,\nand I do not think it was reasonable to have females strip\nsearch males. If our law does approve of it, and the majority\nopinion cogently reasons that it does, I reluct; the law should\nchange.\n1See Michenfelder v. Sumner, 860 F.2d 328, 333-34 (9th Cir. 1988);\nGrummett v. Rushen, 779 F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th Cir. 1985). \n2See Grummett, 779 F.2d at 496. \n3The County has indicated that “[i]t is our custom and practice to per-\nform regular mass pat searches and cell searches in Durango Jail for secur-\nity purposes. . . . Pat searches and cell searches are always together and\nroutinely performed for security purposes about four times a month.” It is\ninteresting to note that the County, throughout, insists that this strip search\nwas merely a pat search. It shrinks from suggesting that cross-gender strip\nsearches would be appropriate under these circumstances. \n4For example, O’Connell testified that of some thirty-two to forty-five\ncadets on hand only a couple were females. \n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 127-1    Filed 06/11/09   Page 34 of 34\nBYRD v.

Arpaio et al., \n12 \n \nDefendants.\n13   \n14  Before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion/Application for Attorneys’ Fees (Doc. 174).  \n15  This motion includes fees clai med by Fennemore Craig, P.C. (trial counsel) and by Mr.  \n16  Jarrett Green (counsel on app eal).  Defendants and Fennemore  Craig have since settled \n17  their fees dispute, mooting that portion of the motion.  (Doc. 179.)  Mr. Green continues \n18  to claim his fees. \n19  In the Ninth Circuit, a party/attorney s eeking fees incurred on a ppeal must first \n20  move the appellate court for those fees.   Cummings v. Connell, 402 F.3d 936, 948 ( 9th \n21  Cir. 2005); Gametech Int’l, Inc. v.  Trend Gaming Sys., L.L.C., 380 F. Supp.  2d 1084, \n22  1093–94  (D. Ar iz.  2005);  Nader  v. Brewer ,  No. CV-04-1699-PH X-FJM,  2009 WL \n23  811450, at *1 (D. Ariz. Mar. 27,  2009).  Such a motion was required within 14 days of \n24  the mandate.  Ninth Circuit Rul e 39-1.6(a).  The Ninth Circuit, in its discretion, could \n25  then refer the motion to the district court.  Id.  39-1.8. \n26  This Court’s review of the Ninth Circuit’s docket shows that Byrd filed no request \n27  for fees incurred on appeal, either as part of his briefs or separately.  The mandate is also \n28  silent about fees. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n1  Apart  from this procedural impedime nt,  Mr. Green would be entitled to a \n2  substantial award of fees.  But this Court  may not make such an award unless the Court \n3  of Appeals modifies its mandate to allow consideration of such a request. \n4  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Motion/Application for Attorneys’ \n5  Fees (Doc. 174) is DENIED. \n6  Dated: December 30, 2011. \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \n- 2 - \n ",

Defendants Arpaio, Peterson a nd O'Connell have filed a Response to Motion\n19 Demanding Judgment by Default (Doc. #30) and a Response to Plaintiff' s Motion for\n20 Summary Judgment (Doc. #32).  Plaintiff has not filed a reply for any of his motions.\n21 In each of Plaintiff's motions, he claims he is entitled to relief because Defendants\n22 failed to file a timely answer to Plaintiff's amended complaint.  Plaintiff is wrong.  Under\n23 Rule 12(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of CiviPl rocedure, Defendants' answer was due within\n24 60 days of the day the request for service was sent to each of them .  As the court docket\n25 reflects, a waiver was sent to each of the three defendants on February 15, 2006.  See Doc.\n26\n27 1 Although Plaintiff titles his third m otion as a \"Motion for Sum mary Judgment\nPursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\" it is essentially a duplicate of\n28\nhis motion for a default judgment.\n\nCase 2:04-cv-02701-NVW   Document 35    Filed 05/22/06   Page 2 of 2\n1 #21 - #23.
