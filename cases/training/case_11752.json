Jaye Flood, former Head Volleyball Coach for the women’s volleyball program at\nFlorida Gulf Coast University (“FGCU”), brings this action against FGCU for (a) retaliating against\nher after she complained about sex discrimination and advocated for gender equity in FGCU’s\nAthletic Department and (b) defaming her by making false public statements intended to damage\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 2 of 24 PageID 58\nCoach Flood’s professional reputation.  Flood brings this case against FGCU under Title IX of the\nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (“Title IX”), and the implementing\nregulations promulgated under Title IX, as well as Florida common law prohibiting defamation.\nDespite the fact that Coach Flood has the best win-loss record in FGCU’s history and was\nunanimously named “Coach of the Year” by the Atlantic Sun Conference the 2007-08 academic year,\nFGCU subjected Flood to a continuing series of retaliatory acts, as a result of her exercising her\nprotected rights to advocate for gender equity in FGCU’s Athletic Department.  Among other things,\nFGCU appraised her performance as “below expectations” despite having no objective basis for\ndoing so, placed her on probation for her job performance, placed her on indefinite administrative\nleave and removed her from her daily coaching duties and responsibilities, denied her a salary\nincrease or bonus for the 2007-2008 academic year, initiated three separate investigations leading\nto the unjustified termination of her employment, and made defamatory statements intended to\ndamage her professional reputation.\n2. Holly Vaughn, former Head Golf Coach for the women’s golf program at FGCU,\nbrings this action against FGCU for retaliating against her after she complained about sex\ndiscrimination and advocated for gender equity in FGCU’s Athletic Department.  Vaughn brings this\ncase against FGCU under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.\n(“Title IX”), and the implementing regulations promulgated under Title IX.  FGCU subjected\nVaughn to a continuing series of retaliatory acts, as a result of her exercising her protected rights to\nadvocate for gender equity in FGCU’s Athletic Department.  Among other things, FGCU appraised\nher performance as “marginally meets expectations” despite having no objective basis for doing so,\nignored her concerns, ostracized her, and publicly misrepresented her communication skills, her\n2\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 3 of 24 PageID 59\ncoaching skills and her efforts to promote the women’s golf program.\nPARTIES\n3. Plaintiff Jaye Flood is an adult female resident of the State of Florida.  At all times\nrelevant hereto, Plaintiff was an employee of the State of Florida at Florida Gulf Coast University.\n4. Plaintiff Holly Vaughn is an adult female resident of the State of Florida.  At all times\nrelevant hereto, Plaintiff was an employee of the State of Florida at Florida Gulf Coast University.\n5. Defendant Board of Trustees of Florida Gulf Coast University was and is a public\nentity and the duly empowered governing authority for FGCU.  FGCU is a public institution of\nhigher education located in Fort Myers, Florida, and is a recipient of federal funding.\n6. Defendants Does 1 through 13 were at all relevant times employees, agents,\nrepresentatives, and/or members of the Defendant Board of Trustees of FGCU.  Flood and Vaughn\ndo not know the true names and capacities of Does 1 through 13 and therefore sue these defendants\nby fictitious names.  Upon information and belief, Does 1 through 13 are residents of the State of\nFlorida.\nJURISDICTION\n7. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the common\nlaw pendent jurisdiction doctrine.\n8. Venue is proper as all or most of the acts complained of herein occurred in Lee\nCounty, Florida.\nFACTS GIVING RISE TO RELIEF\nPlaintiff Jaye Flood\n9. Plaintiff Flood began her employment as FGCU’s Head Volleyball Coach in 2003.\n3\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 4 of 24 PageID 60\n10. Prior to coming to FGCU, Flood had 22 years of coaching experience.  In addition\nto her experience as a collegiate volleyball coach, Flood is the Founder and Director of the USA\nSouth Volleyball Club, an elite volleyball program designed to promote volleyball, sportsmanship\nand collegiate opportunity among Southwest Florida student-athletes.\n11. Coach Flood designed and developed the  FGCU volleyball program from its\ninception.  Under Coach Flood’s leadership, in the first three years of the program, FGCU compiled\nan overall record of 80 wins and 13 losses (.860).  This is the best win-loss record of any coach in\nFGCU’s history.  Coach Flood’s team earned a berth in post-season play in each of the first three\nyears of the program, including three appearances in the National Collegiate Athletic Association\n(NCAA) Division II South Regional tournament and two appearances in the NCAA Division II\nSouth Regional Finals.  During the 2007 season, the team compiled a record of 23 wins and 3 losses\nand won the Atlantic Sun Conference title in its first year of Division I play.\n12. Coach  Flood  actively  advocated  for  gender  equity  within  FGCU’s  Athletic\nDepartment, but FGCU rebuffed her at every turn.  Through its Athletic Director, Carl McAloose\n(“McAloose”), and others, FGCU rejected Coach Flood’s efforts to build and promote the volleyball\nprogram at a level equal to men’s athletic programs at FGCU.  For example, Coach Flood:\n(a) pressed for better marketing of the volleyball program in the community\ncommensurate with the marketing of men’s sports at FGCU; \n(b) objected to the pooling of Booster Club donations, instead of allowing\nvolleyball-specific donations to be used for the volleyball team; \n(c) complained about a prolonged period when there was no hot water in the\nvolleyball team’s locker room; and\n4\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 5 of 24 PageID 61\n(d) complained  about the fact that male coaches have been granted multi-year\ncontracts while female coaches, including Flood, have been granted only one-\nyear contracts. \n13. In the 2007-2008 academic year, FGCU moved from NCAA Division II to Division\nI play.  The volleyball program was one of only two sports at FGCU (the other was baseball) that\nwere “fast-tracked” for Division I post-season play to begin in the 2009-2010 academic year.  Other\nFGCU sports will not be eligible for Division I post-season play until the 2011-2012 academic year.\nIn 2006 and into early 2007, as part of her effort to ensure that the volleyball program was fully\nstaffed and fully funded to be ready for FGCU’s competition in full Division I play, Coach Flood\nrequested that the volleyball program be provided, among other things:\n(a) additional funds to hire a second assistant coach;\n(b) “guarantee money” to encourage other schools’ teams to come to FGCU for\nhome matches, which was made available to the men’s athletic programs at\nFGCU; and\n(c) a higher salary for her then current assistant coach, so that it would be\ncomparable with similarly situated male assistant coaches at FGCU.\n14. Coach Flood’s requests for gender equity in FGCU’s Athletic Department, and for\nthe volleyball program in particular, were rebuffed by Athletic Director McAloose and by Associate\nAthletic Director and Senior Woman Administrator Kathleen Peterson (“Peterson”).\n15. Upon information and belief, soon after Coach Flood had requested additional funds\nto increase her assistant coach’s salary, McAloose undertook efforts to replace Coach Flood.\n16. Because Flood advocated for gender equity within the Athletic Department, and\n5\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 6 of 24 PageID 62\nspecifically for the volleyball program, FGCU retaliated against her by subjecting her to closer\nscrutiny and treating her less favorably than employees who did not advocate gender equity. \n17. For example, among other things, FGCU rated Coach Flood’s performance more\nharshly than employees who did not advocate gender equity, criticizing her ability to get along with\nothers, characterizing her communication skills as “gruff”, claiming she showed a lack of sensitivity\nto  others’  needs  and  displayed  disruptive  or  antagonistic  behavior,  challenging  her  ethical\nstandards/sportsmanship,  and  scrutinizing  her  observance  of  NCAA  rules  and  adherence  to\nuniversity policies regarding travel authorization requests.  \n18. Coach Flood encountered such open disrespect from McAloose that her players asked\nher, “Why doesn’t the Athletic Director like you?”\nPlaintiff Holly Vaughn\n19. Plaintiff Vaughn began her employment as FGCU’s Head Women’s Golf Coach in\n2000.\n20. Prior to coming to FGCU, Vaughn was a professional tour player, with experience\nin both the Futures tour and the LPGA tour.  Vaughn was a finalist in the 1994 U.S. Women’s Open.\n21. Coach Vaughn designed and developed the FGCU women’s golf program from its\ninception.  Under Coach Vaughn’s direction, in its first four years, the women’s golf program\naccumulated 11 tournament wins and was ranked as high as third in the nation in Division II, even\nthough FGCU was not eligible for post-season play because of the University’s NCAA probationary\nstatus as a new university.\n22. When FGCU became eligible for post-season play beginning in 2004, the women’s\ngolf program was represented two out of three years by an FGCU female golfer.\n6\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 7 of 24 PageID 63\n23. Coach Vaughn advocated for gender equity within FGCU’s Athletic Department, but\nwas bluntly rebuffed by McAloose.  For example, Coach Vaughn learned that FGCU had offered\nmale part-time coaches additional job duties to make them full-time employees.  When Vaughn\nasked McAloose why no one had mentioned these types of positions to her, McAloose, although he\nhad never discussed the matter with her, claimed surprise that she would be interested in such a full-\ntime position.  \n24. Similarly, and in the same conversation, Coach Vaughn inquired why the female\ncoaches’ offices were located down at the opposite end of the department, while the male coaches’\noffices were near the front office.  Vaughn also noted that several months into Head Coach Flood’s\ntenure, Flood still had not been provided with an office, while assistant coaches had offices.\n25. In response to Coach Vaughn’s concerns, McAloose rebuffed her, stating, “If you\ndon’t like it here, you can get the hell out.”  McAloose’s response left Vaughn feeling intimidated,\nthreatened and vulnerable.\n26. Although male head coaches selected their assistant coaches, Vaughn was not\npermitted to select her own assistant coach.  Instead, McAloose and Butch Perchan hired J.P. Meyer\nto assist FGCU’s men’s and women’s golf programs.  Coach Vaughn did not have any role in hiring\nJ.P. Meyer as an assistant coach.  On more than one occasion, when Vaughn told McAloose that she\ndid not want Meyer as her assistant, he told her, “Just give him things to do.”\n27. Among other actions, in June 2006, when three male coaches were hired into the\nAthletic Department, McAloose directed Vaughn to move her office out of Alico Arena and into an\noutdoor trailer.  Vaughn was the only head coach relegated to the trailer, and was forced to share the\ntrailer with the assistant men’s golf coach, the academic advisor, and the construction crew for the\n7\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 8 of 24 PageID 64\nsoccer fields and field house.  Coaches who did not advocate gender equity had clerical support, a\nprinter, and a copier, but Vaughn did not. \n28. Except  for  a  single  tournament  that  Coach  Vaughn  hosted  in  2003,  FGCU\nadministrators did not attend women’s golf team events or competitions, leaving Vaughn and her\nfemale student-athletes unappreciated and undervalued.  No FGCU administrator attended the two\nNCAA regional golf tournaments at which FGCU was represented.\n29. Coach Vaughn’s salary was substantially lower than the salaries of other coaches who\ndid not advocate gender equity.\n30. Because Vaughn advocated for gender equity within the Athletic Department, and\nspecifically for the women’s golf program, FGCU retaliated against her by subjecting her to closer\nscrutiny and treating her less favorably than employees who did not advocate gender equity. \n31. For example, among other things, FGCU rated Coach Vaughn’s performance more\nharshly than employees who did not advocate gender equity, criticizing her ability to get along with\nothers, falsely characterizing her communication skills with her co-workers and department staff,\nfalsely characterizing her coaching skills, unjustifiably criticizing her interactions with the public\nand her efforts to promote the golf program, and falsely accusing her of hiring unqualified staff.\nThe Baker Letter\n32. In May 2007, Coach Flood and Coach Vaughn joined with the other two female\ncoaches then at FGCU to express their concerns about gender equity in FGCU athletics to Merrily\nDean Baker (“Baker”), FGCU’s former Interim Athletic Director.  On May 24, 2007, Baker, in turn,\nsubmitted a letter (the “Baker Letter”) summarizing these concerns to FGCU Interim President\nRichard Pegnetter.  \n8\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 9 of 24 PageID 65\n33.  Among other things, the Baker Letter complained that FGCU’s Athletic Department\nwas violating Title IX by engaging in practices that provide male student-athletes with greater\nathletic opportunities than female student-athletes, and discriminating against female student-\nathletes, their coaches and programs.  According to the Baker Letter, these discriminatory practices\nincluded, among other things, withholding adequate support for female student-athletes and their\nprograms, failing to hire assistant coaches for female athletic programs, failing to provide female\ncoaches with compensation equal to that of comparable male coaches, failing to provide two\nassistant coaches for each female program as was done for the male programs, and limiting female\ncoaches to one-year contracts while providing multi-year contracts for male coaches.\n34. After receiving the Baker Letter, President Pegnetter sent an e-mail dated June 8,\n2007, to the entire FGCU faculty and staff, and to student government leaders, informing them that\nallegations had been made about Title IX and other issues in the Athletic Department and that an\ninternal audit would be conducted into the matter.  \n35. President Pegnetter’s June 8, 2007 e-mail asserted that the Title IX allegations were\n“unsubstantiated,” although FGCU had not yet compiled facts to support such a statement.\n36. On June 8, 2007, Chief of Staff and University Spokesperson Susan Evans sent an\ne-mail to the entire Athletic Department staff, asserting that “unsubstantiated allegations about Title\nIX and other issues involving FGCU’s Athletics Department have been made.”\n37. The fact that the only four female coaches in FGCU’s Athletic Department had a role\nin expressing the concerns outlined in the Baker Letter became common knowledge within the\nAthletic Department. \n38. Thereafter, Internal Auditor Carol Slade (“Slade”), together with outside counsel,\n9\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 10 of 24 PageID 66\ncommenced an internal audit of FGCU’s compliance with Title IX, which included interviews with\nand requests for data from the head coaches of the Athletic Department.\n39. After June 8, 2007, FGCU’s retaliation against Coach Flood intensified, and FGCU\nbegan to retaliate against Vaughn.\n40. Following FGCU’s receipt of the Baker Letter, and despite objective facts to the\ncontrary, Coach Flood’s performance was appraised as “below expectations,” in retaliation for her\ncomplaining about gender inequities in FGCU’s Athletic Department.  This was the first time in\nCoach Flood’s tenure at FGCU that her performance had been appraised as “below expectations.”\n41. On or about July 8, 2007, Slade issued her report of the internal audit of FGCU’s Title\nIX compliance.  The internal audit and investigation report concluded that FGCU was in compliance\nwith Title IX and met with public skepticism, as reflected by local news media reports.\n42. On or about July 11, 2007, FGCU put Coach Flood on probation and placed her on\na performance improvement plan during that probationary period.  She continued to be the target of\ncloser scrutiny than any coach in the department who did not complain about gender inequity. \n43. On or about July 11, 2007, McAloose  asked Flood to meet with him to discuss staff\nsalaries, the hiring process, and other issues that were raised in the Baker Letter.  In that meeting,\nwhen the Athletic Director asked Coach Flood whether she thought she should be paid as much as\nthe (male) baseball coach, she responded, “Why not?”  He laughed at her.  \n44. Following FGCU’s receipt of the Baker Letter, in retaliation for her complaining\nabout gender inequities in FGCU’s Athletic Department, Coach Vaughn’s performance was\nappraised as “marginally meets expectations,” despite objective facts to the contrary.  The only other\ntime that Coach Vaughn’s performance had been appraised during her then seven-year tenure at\n10\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 11 of 24 PageID 67\nFGCU, her performance was appraised as “outstanding.”\n45. FGCU’s appraisal of Coach Vaughn’s performance was not justified because Peterson\nhad never attended a golf team practice conducted by Coach Vaughn, and had never attended a team\ntournament or any team meeting.  Peterson had never seen Vaughn teach, coach, recruit, or mentor\nher student-athletes, and had never seen her run a golf tournament or perform any of her other job\nresponsibilities.\n46. Peterson refused to discuss the false performance appraisal with Coach Vaughn.\n47. When Coach Vaughn asked McAloose to meet with her to discuss the negative\nperformance evaluation ratings she had received related to assistant coach J.P. Meyer, McAloose\nrefused to meet with her.\n48. After the Slade internal audit was released, McAloose ignored and ostracized Coach\nVaughn, making it difficult for her to fulfill her responsibilities in the Athletic Department.  \n49. Shortly after the Slade internal audit was released, Women’s Assistant Basketball\nCoach LeAnn Freeland (“Freeland”) resigned her position.  Upon information and belief, Freeland\nexplained that prior to her participation in the discussions that led to the Baker Letter, she had not\nformally complained to the Athletic Department administration because she “was already familiar\nwith the inequitable reprimands distributed among ‘friends’ and foes of the athletics administration.”\n50. Upon information and belief, during Freeland’s tenure at FGCU, among other things,\nshe was regularly addressed by a male coach with terms of disrepect, like “baby” and was shown\nsexually explicit material by a male coach in the FGCU Athletic Department.\n51. McAloose consistently rated coaches who did not complain about gender equity\nissues as “Outstanding” on their performance appraisals in 2007.\n11\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 12 of 24 PageID 68\n52. On September 7, 2007, Coach Flood submitted to FGCU an internal Complaint of\nInequity/Discrimination, incorporating by reference the Baker Letter.  In that Complaint, she alleged\nthat FGCU was discriminating against her based on sex and retaliating against her for complaining\nabout gender inequities in the Athletic Department.\n53. Similarly, on or about September 13, 2007, Coach Vaughn filed an internal Complaint\nof Inequity/Discrimination, incorporating by reference the Baker Letter.  In that Complaint, she\nalleged that FGCU was discriminating against her based on sex and retaliating against her for\ncomplaining about gender inequities in the Athletic Department.  Vaughn announced her resignation\non or about October 1, 2007, at the beginning of the golf season, saying, “I’ve been growing tired\nof the situation and it was time to make a change.”  \n54. When Coach Vaughn handed her letter of resignation to McAloose, he said, “Good.”\n55. FGCU’s retaliation against Coach Vaughn, resulting from her complaints about Title\nIX gender equity issues, took many forms, including but not limited to the following:\n(a) In 2007, Peterson and McAloose issued a false performance appraisal that\nrated Coach Vaughn’s performance as “marginally meets expectations,”\nbased on subjective criteria, and cited deficiencies that reflect closer scrutiny\nthan was  given to coaches who did not complain about gender inequity.  The\nfalse  performance  appraisal  also  reflects  criticisms  about  Vaughn’s\ncommunication skills and other criteria that reflect gender stereotyping on the\npart of FGCU;\n(b) After McAloose learned about the Baker Letter, he called Vaughn into his\noffice for a private meeting, during which he questioned Vaughn about the\n12\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 13 of 24 PageID 69\nspecific issues raised in the Baker Letter and directed an unpleasant barrage\nat her, saying, “I’ve always trusted you until this point. . . .  I’ve always liked\nyou until this point.”; and \n(c) FGCU released information in Coach Vaughn’s personnel file to the media,\nincluding the retaliatory performance appraisal that contained knowingly\nfalse and misleading information, in a manner that cast doubt about her\nreputation for professionalism and competence as a golf coach.\n56. FGCU’s retaliation against Coach Flood, resulting from her complaints about Title\nIX gender equity issues, took many forms, including but not limited to the following:\n(a) In 2006, Athletic Director McAloose downgraded Flood’s performance\nappraisal from “outstanding” to “meets expectations,” despite her great\nsuccess with the volleyball program during the 2005-2006 academic year; \n(b) FGCU paid Flood a lower salary than male coaches;\n(c) FGCU failed to grant Flood a multi-year contract, although male coaches\nwere provided with multi-year contracts;\n(d) FGCU failed to provide clear budget information for the volleyball program,\nplacing Coach Flood in a position to be blamed for exceeding the limits of\nher budget;\n(e) In 2007, Peterson and McAloose issued a false performance appraisal that\nrated  Coach  Flood’s  performance  as  “below  expectations,”  based  on\nsubjective criteria, and cited deficiencies that reflect closer scrutiny than was\ngiven to coaches who did not complain about gender inequity.  The false\n13\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 14 of 24 PageID 70\nperformance appraisal also reflects criticisms about her communication skills\nand other criteria that reflect gender stereotyping on the part of FGCU; \n(f) The “below expectations” rating rendered Coach Flood ineligible for an\nannual base salary increase or bonus for the 2007-2008 academic year;\n(g) FGCU failed to acknowledge Flood’s exemplary job performance, including\nthe great success of her teams and her student-athletes; and\n(h) In July or August, 2007, Peterson waved Flood’s personnel file in front of a\nreporter, disclosing among other things, that she had “a year’s worth of\ninformation” that allegedly justified the negative performance appraisal.  The\nmedia then demanded release of the file and FGCU released information in\nCoach  Flood’s  personnel  file  to  the  media,  including  the  retaliatory\nperformance  appraisals  that  contained  knowingly  false  and  misleading\ninformation,  in  a  manner  that  cast  doubt  about  her  reputation  for\nprofessionalism and competence as a volleyball coach.\n57. Upon information and belief, Associate Athletic Director Butch Perchan publicly\nstated to a non-FGCU employee that it was “just a matter of time before they got Jaye Flood”\nbecause she did not “play by the rules.”\n58. Several  weeks  after  Flood  and  Vaughn  filed  their  internal  complaints  of\ndiscrimination and retaliation with FGCU, on or about October 1, 2007, FGCU undertook a second\nTitle IX compliance review, conducted by an outside agent, Robert Clayton (“Clayton”) of the law\nfirm of Littler Mendelson.  The head coaches in the Athletic Department were requested to provide\ninformation as part of that second Title IX compliance review.\n14\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 15 of 24 PageID 71\n59. The second Title IX compliance review by an outside agent was designed to counter\nthe public criticism that the initial review had received and to generate the appearance of neutrality.\n60. On January 22, 2008, FGCU released and published on its website four reports\nregarding the internal complaints of discrimination and retaliation filed by Coach Flood and Coach\nVaughn, and the Baker Letter.\n61. President Bradshaw’s Statement accompanying the issuance of the reports announced\nthat the investigators found “NO evidence of disparate treatment of female and male coaches or\nfemale and male student-athletes.”\n62. A timeline accompanying President Bradshaw’s Statement announced that there was\nnot sufficient FGCU documentation to support the 2006-07 performance evaluations of Coach Flood\nor Coach Vaughn and that McAloose and Peterson would be reprimanded in writing for negligence\nin violation of FGCU rules.\n63. The events set forth in paragraphs 64 through 83 below constitute further acts of\nretaliation by FGCU against Coach Flood for complaining about Title IX gender inequities in\nFGCU’s Athletic Department.\nFGCU Launches Three Investigations Against Coach Flood\n64. On October 15, 2007, FGCU placed Coach Flood on administrative leave for alleged\n“issues involving student welfare”—effectively disciplining her—without informing her of the\nspecific nature of the allegations, and before speaking with Coach Flood, the student whose welfare\nallegedly was at issue, or the assistant volleyball coach to evaluate whether there was any merit to\nthe allegations.  Indeed, Coach Flood was not even informed of the nature of the allegations directed\nagainst her until October 17, when FGCU told Flood that the allegation was  that she had\n15\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 16 of 24 PageID 72\ninappropriately tugged the shirt of one of her volleyball players during a practice session.\n65. FGCU told Coach Flood that, while on administrative leave, she was not allowed to\nperform any duties as Head Volleyball Coach, she was not to initiate communications with other\nAthletic Department employees or with the student-athletes on the volleyball team, and she was not\nallowed to return to her office.\n66. On October 17, 2007, and before he had interviewed Coach Flood about the alleged\n“shirt-tugging” incident, FGCU’s outside investigator, Clayton, informed Coach Flood that he\n“kn[e]w the facts [were] not in dispute,” he had proposed a resolution to FGCU, and FGCU had\naccepted his recommendation. Based on Clayton’s recommendation, FGCU demanded that Coach\nFlood issue a written apology to the team in order to be reinstated to her duties.  Because Coach\nFlood did not believe her conduct was inappropriate she declined to do so.  \n67. Upon information and belief, the student involved in the “shirt-tugging” incident\nreported to Clayton that she did not take offense to the incident.\n68. Although FGCU’s investigators never interviewed Coach Flood about the “shirt-\ntugging” incident, on or about October 26, 2007, Clayton and FGCU’s General Counsel informed\nCoach Flood that the investigation into the incident giving rise to the October 15, 2007, notice\nplacing her on administrative leave had been concluded.  FGCU failed to provide Coach Flood with\nany final conclusion or investigative report and has left her status uncertain through the conclusion\nof the volleyball season, and until January 22, 2008.\n69. On or about October 26, 2007, after FGCU told her that the investigation had been\nconcluded, Coach Flood requested that she be returned to her normal duties as Head Volleyball\nCoach, but FGCU refused to reinstate her.\n16\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 17 of 24 PageID 73\n70. After the conclusion of the investigation of the “student welfare issues” that gave rise\nto FGCU placing Coach Flood on administrative leave, in further retaliation, FGCU and Clayton\ncontinued to engage in a series of “investigations” designed to discredit Coach Flood and justify\nFGCU’s retaliatory decision to place her on administrative leave, and to manufacture grounds for\nher removal.  \n71. Upon information and belief, throughout each investigation, Clayton rejected the\nresponses of persons interviewed during the course of his investigations, put words in their mouths,\nand lectured and argued with them over their accounts of events. \n72. In further retaliation for complaining about Title IX gender inequities, after placing\nCoach Flood on administrative leave, FGCU’s agents initiated an investigation of Coach Flood for\npotential violations of FGCU rules and policies, including the Florida Administrative Code.\nHowever, FGCU failed to inform Coach Flood of the specific facts underlying the allegations that\nwere under investigation, including what actions she allegedly took and when.\n73. In further retaliation against Coach Flood for advocating gender equity in FGCU’s\nAthletic Department, when the Atlantic Sun Conference announced on November 14, 2007, that\nFlood had been unanimously elected Coach of the Year, FGCU directed its sports information officer\nnot to recognize Coach Flood’s accomplishment and not to include her in a press release issued by\nFGCU.  The same evening, Athletic Director McAloose prohibited Coach Flood from participating\nwith her team in a mid-court program honoring the team.\n74. On or about November 26, 2007, Clayton informed Coach Flood that FGCU had\nalready decided that it would not renew her contract when it expires in 2008, even though he had not\neven interviewed Coach Flood about these allegations and had not completed the investigation into\n17\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 18 of 24 PageID 74\nher alleged violations of FGCU’s rules and policies.  \n75. In light of Clayton’s statement that Coach Flood’s contract would not be renewed,\nit was apparent that the investigation of allegations against Coach Flood was not in good faith and\nwas not a neutral inquiry.\n76. Upon information and belief, before January 18, 2008, FGCU had begun speaking\nto a male volleyball coach about replacing Coach Flood as the Head Volleyball Coach at FGCU.\n77. Upon information and belief, Clayton’s investigation was still ongoing as of January\n18, 2008.\n78. On January 18, 2008, Coach Flood filed the original Complaint in this matter.\n79. On January 22, 2008, FGCU President Wilson G. Bradshaw announced that Coach\nFlood was being given notice of termination from her position as Head Coach for the FGCU\nwomen’s volleyball program.\n80. With his announcement, President Bradshaw issued three “investigative reports” to\nthe entire FGCU community and to the media, entitled “Report on Jaye Flood Investigation #1,”\n“Report on Jaye Flood Investigation #2,” and “Report on Jaye Flood Investigation #3” (the\n“Reports”).  The Reports were dated January 18, 2008.\n81. President Bradshaw’s Statement accompanying the issuance of the Reports included\na link to the FGCU website, http://www.fgcu.edu/investigations, where all of the Reports were\npublished for the world to review or download electronically.\n82. Following five months and three investigations initiated by FGCU, President\nBradshaw granted Coach Flood a one hour conference, at which Coach Flood was allowed to\nrespond to the “investigative reports” and notice of termination. \n18\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 19 of 24 PageID 75\n83. Although the “investigative reports” did not justify the action, on March 7, 2008,\nFGCU gave Coach Flood final notice that her employment would be terminated effective March 14,\n2008.\n84. Coach Flood is the Founder and Director of the USA South Volleyball Club.  USA\nSouth is a club that strives to promote volleyball, pride, self-confidence, and sportsmanship to\nprepare Southwest Florida volleyball athletes to compete for college scholarship opportunities.\n85. By 2006, the USA South program enrolled approximately 80 junior volleyball\nplayers.\n86. In the fall of 2007, after FGCU’s retaliatory actions against Flood, and as a result of\nFGCU’s public disclosure of incomplete information regarding the inquiries into her gender equity\nconcerns addressed in the Baker Letter and the investigation of alleged “issues involving student\nwelfare,” enrollment in Coach Flood’s USA South Volleyball Club had decreased to approximately\n50 players.  \n87. Coach Flood and the public at large have no adequate remedy at law for many of the\nharms they and the volleyball program are suffering as a result of FGCU’s retaliation against Flood.\nDamages for loss of Flood’s professional reputation, and harm to FGCU’s volleyball program while\nCoach Flood’s status remained in limbo during FGCU’s ongoing investigations, and after her\nemployment was terminated without justification, are difficult if not impossible to ascertain and will\ncontinue without this Court’s intervention.\n19\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 20 of 24 PageID 76\nCOUNT I\n(Plaintiff Flood – Retaliation in Violation of Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and 34 C.F.R. § 100.7)\n88. Plaintiff Flood incorporates by reference and re-alleges each of the allegations\ncontained in paragraphs 1-87 of this First Amended Complaint with the same force and vigor as if\nset out here in full.\n89. FGCU gave Flood false “meets expectations” and “below expectations” ratings on\nher performance appraisals, denied her a base salary increase or bonus, placed her on probation and\na performance improvement plan, placed her on indefinite administrative leave, and ultimately\nterminated her employment because of Coach Flood’s complaints about Title IX gender inequities\nin FGCU’s Athletic Department.  \n90. FGCU initiated three investigations of Coach Flood in which FGCU scrutinized her\nperformance more closely than any coaches who had not complained about gender equity issues, and\nsearched for information to discredit Coach Flood and damage her professional reputation.\n91. As a direct and proximate result of FGCU’s unlawful acts, Coach Flood suffered and\ncontinues to suffer lost earnings and benefits, emotional pain, suffering, professional and personal\nembarrassment, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience.\nCOUNT II\n(Plaintiff Flood – Defamation)\n92. Plaintiff Flood incorporates by reference and re-alleges each of the allegations\ncontained in paragraphs 1-87 of this First Amended Complaint with the same force and vigor as if\nset out here in full.\n20\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 21 of 24 PageID 77\n93. FGCU made false public statements regarding Coach Flood’s performance as head\ncoach, including falsely calling into question her communication skills and behavior toward others,\nher sensitivity to others’ needs, her ethical standards/sportsmanship, her observance of NCAA rules\nand adherence to university policies regarding travel authorization requests.  FGCU personnel knew\nthe statements to be false when they made them and made these false statements in bad faith, with\nmalice toward Coach Flood, and with an intention to cast her in a false light.\n94. Specifically, Peterson invited publication of the false information in the performance\nappraisal by waving Flood’s personnel file in front of a reporter, disclosing among other things, that\nshe had “a year’s worth of information” that allegedly justified the negative performance appraisal,\nintending to expose Flood to ridicule and to damage her professional reputation.\n95. Additionally, FGCU issued “investigative reports” containing gossip and innuendo\nthat intentionally characterized Coach Flood in a false light and did not justify the termination of her\nemployment.\n96. As a direct and proximate result of FGCU’s unlawful acts, Coach Flood suffered and\ncontinues to suffer lost earnings and benefits, emotional pain, suffering, professional and personal\nembarrassment, humiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience.\nCOUNT III\n(Plaintiff Vaughn – Retaliation in Violation of Title IX of the \nEducation Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., and 34 C.F.R. § 100.7)\n97. Plaintiff Vaughn incorporates by reference and re-alleges each of the allegations\ncontained in paragraphs 1-87 of this First Amended Complaint with the same force and vigor as if\nset out here in full.\n98. In July 2007, FGCU gave Vaughn a false “marginally meets expectations” rating on\n21\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00030-UA-DNF   Document 15    Filed 05/12/08   Page 22 of 24 PageID 78\nher performance appraisal because of Coach Vaughn’s complaints about Title IX gender inequities\nin FGCU’s Athletic Department.  \n99. Following her participation in the Baker Letter, FGCU scrutinized Coach Vaughn’s\nemployment more closely than any coaches who had not complained about gender equity issues.\n100. As a direct and proximate result of FGCU’s unlawful acts, Coach Vaughn suffered\nand continues to suffer emotional pain, suffering, professional and personal embarrassment,\nhumiliation, loss of enjoyment of life, and inconvenience.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nWHEREFORE, the premises considered, each Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Honorable\nCourt:\n1. Enter judgment on behalf of each Plaintiff against Defendant FGCU;\n2. Order preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to reinstate Plaintiff Flood into the\nposition of Head Volleyball Coach with all attendant benefits;\n3.
