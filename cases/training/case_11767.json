    "summary": "<p>On April 7, 2008, twelve individuals, all represented by private counsel, filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island against the town of Coventry and individual members of the town's police force (Police). Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law alleging denial of due process and equal protection, unreasonable search and seizure, invasion of privacy, racial profiling and race/national origin intimidation.</p><p>Specifically, plaintiffs, Hispanic members of the Central Falls High School boys soccer team, claimed that they were treated improperly when traveling to Coventry, a predominately white neighborhood, for a high school soccer game. When the game was over, members of the home team stopped the Central Falls coach and accused his team of stealing electronic devices from the locker room. The coach searched his players' bags but found nothing. The police arrived on the scene, blocking the team's bus, and asked the coach if they could search the players. The coach consented. The police searched the boys' property as members of the Coventry community looked on and shouted racist epithets and accused the boys of theft. The search lasted approximately one hour and none of the allegedly stolen items were found.</p><p>On September 9, 2009, the district court (Judge William Smith) granted defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court held that the plaintiffs could not overcome qualified immunity in their claims. On the Fourth Amendment claim, the court found plaintiffs' case to be insufficient to overcome qualified immunity because the police officers did not violate the plaintiffs' clearly established rights, because the coach may have been acting in loco parentis when he consented to the police officers' request to search members of the team and their belongings. The court also held that the plaintiffs' invasion of privacy claim arose out of conduct for which the police officers were immune from suit. On the Equal Protection claim, the court held that the plaintiffs failed to show that the officers had a racial motive, even if they exhibited poor judgment in searching the boys in front of an angry crowd; for the same reasons, the court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the plaintiffs' state racial profiling claim. Finally, the court held there was insufficient evidence for plaintiffs' claim of supervisory and municipal liability.</p><p>Plaintiffs appealed to the First Circuit. On April 1, 2011, the Circuit Court (Chief Judge Lynch, Judge Selya, and Judge Thompson) upheld the district court's grant of summary judgment. The appellate court found that the officers' conduct was subject to qualified immunity. As to the plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment and state privacy claims, the court found that it was not unreasonable for the officers to consider the coach's consent to search the team. The court also held that the plaintiffs could not overcome qualified immunity on their equal protection and state discrimination claims. </p>",

INTRODUCTION \nThe Appellants file this Reply Brief in response to several of the arguments \nadvanced by the Appellees in support of affirming the judgment of the District \nCourt.  As they had done below, the Appellees urge that qualified immunity should \nattach with respect to the claims involving the search because, in their view, there \nwas a lack of clarity in the law on the point of whether Coach Marchand could \nhave given a valid consent to that search.  At this level, the Appellees add that the \nDistrict Court acted well within its discretion when declining to determine \nwhether, as a matter of law, Coach Marchand, a public school official, possessed \nthat authority.  The Appellees also argue that summary judgment of Appellants’ \nclaims of racial discrimination was warranted because there was no evidence on \nthe record to support the claim that the Coventry Police officers singled out the \nAppellants for a public search based upon their race. \nThe Appellees’ argument that the District Court’s ruling should remain \nwholly undisturbed is untenable.  The very existence of that decision creates a \nsubstantial risk that public school students may suffer diminished Fourth \nAmendment protections.  The Appellees offer no discernable reason why this \nCourt should decline to rule on the question of whether a public school official, as \na matter of law, possesses the authority to waive his or her students’ Fourth \nAmendment right to refuse suspicionless searches from outside police officers.  \n1 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 7    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nWithout a firm decision on this issue, the legal reality is that public school \nstudents’ Fourth Amendment rights with respect to outside police officers can and \nlikely will be surrendered upon the unconstrained whim of their teachers, and that \nthose students will be left without a remedy.   If that student attempts to vindicate \nhis rights later through a § 1983 claim, the District Court’s decision can and will be \ncited in support of a qualified immunity defense, and the offending officers will \nescape liability.  This process will repeat itself until this issue is definitively \nresolved.   \nFurthermore, an examination of the issue of Coach Marchand’s authority is \ngermane to the purposes of this instant dispute.  An actual examination of this \nquestion quickly reveals the inherent unreasonableness of the Appellees’ plea for \nqualified immunity.  First, the Appellees failed to respond to the case law clearly \ndemonstrating that where student searches are concerned, outside law enforcement \nofficials are held to the same “probable cause” standard that would have applied \noutside of school.  That case law never countenanced the elimination of the \n“probable cause” standard simply because a youth happened to be in the custody of \npublic school officials at the time the police wished to perform a search. \nSecond, the Appellees’ argument suggests that Coach Marchand possessed \nan unbridled in loco parentis authority that allowed him to consent to outside law \nenforcement searches.  That position garishly clashes with settled law.  Appellees \n2 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 8    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\noffer no authority demonstrating that a public school officials’ authority over their \nstudents ever extended to the point where they were permitted to waive their \nstudents’ Constitutional rights.   Even more significantly, the Appellees fail to \novercome the U.S. Supreme Court’s specific holdings in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 \nU.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985).  That decision confirmed that \npublic school officials did not have in loco parentis authority with respect to \nsearches, but were instead state actors held to the Fourth Amendment.   The \nAppellees also fail to overcome T.L.O.’s specific holding that public school \nofficials are not permitted to search students for disciplinary purposes without \nreasonable suspicion that the student has broken the law or school rules.   \nWhen one takes these clear legal standards into account, it becomes \nimmediately apparent that the Appellees wish this Court to allow a logically \nflawed view of the law to prevail.  It is undisputed that neither probable cause nor \nreasonable suspicion of the boys ever existed for either Coach Marchand or the \nCoventry Police.  The Coventry Police therefore could not conduct the search.  \nCoach Marchand, without the requisite reasonable suspicion to conduct a search of \nhis students, was similarly forbidden to conduct a search of the boys.  \nNevertheless, the Appellees suggest that Coach Marchand could somehow \nmagically confer upon outside law enforcement officers the ability to conduct a \nsearch forbidden to both himself and the Coventry Police.  Appellees ask that this \n3 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 9    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nCourt accept that a reasonable police officer could believe that Coach Marchand \ncould so expand their authority in this way.  The Appellees, in other words, ask \nthat a patently unreasonable legal argument grant them qualified immunity. \nThe Appellees similarly offer an implausible argument with respect to the \nracial discrimination claims.  The Appellees offer no credible reasons for the \ndifferential treatment between the Hispanic students of Central Falls, and their \nwhite Coventry counterparts.  The Appellees accept that the Coventry Police could \nbe found liable had they singled out the Central Falls students for the pleasure of \nthe racist mob surrounding the bus that day.  However, the Appellees then attempt \nto escape liability by asking this Court to make factual findings on the point of the \nCoventry Police’s motives.  This Court of course, does not make such factual \nfindings. \nIn short, the Appellees offer little justification for the position that the \nDistrict Court’s decision should be left utterly untouched.  At very least, this Court \ncan and should resolve the underlying Fourth Amendment question.  Once that \nquestion is resolved, the qualified immunity defense collapses because the \nAppellees’ position regarding in loco parentis is hopelessly outdated.  \nFurthermore, the Appellees cannot overcome the evidence creating a triable issue \nwith respect to the discrimination claims.  Accordingly, this Court should reverse \nthe District Court’s decision. \n4 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 10    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nII.  ARGUMENT \nA.  THIS COURT SHOULD DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING \nQUESTION OF WHETHER AN OUTSIDE LAW \nENFORCEMENT OFFICER MAY RELY SOLELY UPON THE \nCONSENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO PERFORM \nA SEARCH OF A STUDENT.   \n \nThe Appellees devote a substantial amount of their brief supporting the \nDistrict Court’s declining to determine the underlying Constitutional question in \nthis case:  whether an outside law enforcement officer may rely upon the consent \nof a public school official to perform a search.  The Appellees’ reluctance to have \nthis question fully illuminated is puzzling, to say the least.  More to the point, the \nfailure to address this question risks the evisceration of public school students’ \nFourth Amendment rights.  \nThe District Court , when declining to decide this question, relied upon the \nrecent case of Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009).  \nBefore Pearson, the U.S. Supreme Court in Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 121 \nS.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) had mandated a two-step analysis of qualified \nimmunity issues.  Saucier had required that when analyzing a claim of qualified \nimmunity, courts must first determine whether the facts alleged supported a claim \nthat a Constitutional right had been violated.  Id. at 201.  The court would then \n5 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 11    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\ndetermine whether the law clearly established that the defendant’s conduct was \nviolative of the Constitution.1  Id.   \nOn re-visitation of the Saucier test, the Pearson Court held that the two-step \napproach was not always warranted.  Pearson noted that in some cases, a two-step \nanalysis was a waste of time because the underlying factual allegations made it \napparent that there could have been no Constitutional violation.  In such instances, \nan analysis of the “clearly established prong” obviously served no purpose.  Id. at \n818.   The Pearson Court also observed that there would be instances in which the \nfacts were not sufficiently developed, and therefore the Court would be unable to \nprovide any meaningful Constitutional precedent.  Id. at 819, quoting Buchanan v. \nMaine, 469 F.3d 158, 168 (1st Cir. 2006).  The Pearson Court identified other \ninstances in which analysis of the underlying Constitutional question would be of \nlittle or no utility, such as when a higher court was poised to decide the point, or \nwhen the Constitutional question hinged on the interpretation of a state law, or \neven when the briefing of the case had poorly illuminated the Constitutional \nquestions.   Id. at 819-20.  The Pearson Court also held that the two-step analysis \n                                                \n1 Previously, this Court had added a third prong, that is, whether it would have \nbeen clear to an objectively reasonable official, situated similarly to that official, \nthat his actions violated the clearly established right.  Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d \n1, 12-13 (1st Cir. 2009).  More recently, since Pearson, this Court has abandoned \nthe third step.  Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263 (1st Cir. 2009). \n6 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 12    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nran afoul of the long-established rule of avoiding Constitutional questions where a \ncase could be decided upon other grounds.  Id. at 821. \nNevertheless, the Pearson Court continued to recognize that there were \nmany instances in which the Saucier two-step analysis remained a valuable \nendeavor.  The Pearson Court was careful to point out that the Saucier Court “. . . \nwas certainly correct in noting that the two-step procedure promotes the \ndevelopment of constitutional precedent and is especially valuable with respect to \nquestions that do not frequently arise in cases in which a qualified immunity \ndefense is unavailable.”  Id. at 818.  The Pearson Court also emphasized that there \nwas nothing preventing the lower courts from following the Saucier procedure \nwhere it was worthwhile.  Id. at 822. \nThe instant case presents none of the circumstances in which the Pearson \nCourt had deemed determination of the Constitutional question to be unfruitful or \ninadvisable.  The facts are sufficiently developed with respect to this particular \nquestion.  We are presented with none of the more intensely factually-driven \nquestions that generally accompany cases involving apparent authority to consent \nto a search.  It is not disputed that Coach Marchand was a public school official.  \nWe are thus faced with two very basic questions of law:  1) whether Coach \nMarchand, a public school official, did as a matter of law have the authority to \n7 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 13    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nconsent to a search of his students; and 2) whether the law on his authority -- or \nlack of that authority -- was clearly established as of the date of the search. \nThis Court reviews the District Court’s grant of qualified immunity on \nsummary judgment de novo.  Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2009.)  \nAccordingly, this Court has the ability to determine the underlying Constitutional \nquestion of Coach Marchand’s authority despite the District Court’s declining to \ndo so.  Furthermore, resolution of this specific Constitutional question regarding \nCoach Marchand’s authority is highly desirable, in that it presents the opportunity \nfor public school officials and law enforcement officials alike to gain a full \ncomprehension of the limits of public school official authority under the \nConstitution.  This is not an opportunity which this Court should pass up lightly, \ngiven the substantial public interest in this matter.  Young people, after all, spend a \nsubstantial amount of their waking hours in the custody of public school officials.   \nThe amount of time spent in school custody renders it virtually inevitable that \nanother youthful citizen will find himself in a situation in which his teacher is \nbeing prevailed upon to surrender his Constitutional rights. \nFurther weighing in favor of deciding this question is the disturbance in the \nlaw created by the District Court’s decision.  Before this decision, it had been well-\nestablished that where outside law enforcement officers were concerned, public \nschool students continued to possess the same Fourth Amendment protections that \n8 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 14    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nthey had enjoyed outside of school, that is, they were free from such searches in \nabsence of probable cause.   See State v. Tywane H., 123 N.M. 42, 46, 933 P.2d \n251, 255 (N.M. App. 1997); M.J. v. State, 399 So.2d 996, 998 (Fla.App. 1981); \nWaters v. United States, 311 A.2d 835, 837-38 (D.C. App. 1973); In the Interest of \nThomas B.D., 326 S.C. 614, 629, 486 S.E.2d 498, 505-06 (S.C. App. 1997); F.P. v. \nState, 528 So.2d 1253, 1254 (Fla. App. 1 Dist. 1988).  Prior to this time, there had \nnever been any valid case law positing that their enjoyment of that right was \ndependent upon the will of other state actors, specifically, their teachers.  With the \nDistrict Court’s decision, there is now case law that suggests that there is at least \nsome lack of clarity on the point of whether a public school teacher may waive a \nstudent’s Fourth Amendment rights.  Other officers are now free to engage in the \nsame conduct as the Coventry officers – and then point to the District Court’s \ndecision to support a qualified immunity defense and escape accountability for \nincursions upon the rights of students.   \nDetermining the underlying question of Coach Marchand’s authority, then, \nis far from an unproductive use of this Court’s time.  There may be some time \nbefore this issue is presented to this Court again.  In the interim, the District \nCourt’s failure to resolve the issue of Coach Marchand’s authority created a real \nrisk that public school students’ Fourth Amendment rights will be substantially \n9 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 15    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nimpaired, and that there will be no remedy for them.  The opportunity to resolve \nthis issue should be taken now.   \n \nB.    THE APPELLEES SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GRANTED \nQUALIFIED IMMUNITY BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHED \nCASE LAW CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT COACH \nMARCHAND COULD NOT CONSENT TO A SUSPICIONLESS \nSEARCH BY OUTSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. \nThe Appellees strenuously argue that they should be granted qualified \nimmunity because the law was not sufficiently clear on whether or not the \nCoventry Police could have reasonably relied upon the consent of Coach Marchand \nto conduct the search of the students.  Appellees hew to the argument that Coach \nMarchand possessed some residual in loco parentis authority that, at very least, \nwould give a reasonable officer the impression that Coach Marchand possessed the \nsame right to consent to a suspicionless search that the students’ parents would \nhave possessed.   This view of the law is completely without merit, and is \nfundamentally flawed.  As such, no qualified immunity should have been granted.  \nFirst, the case law, particularly T.L.O., makes it very clear that in loco parentis \nauthority to consent to police searches no longer exists – if indeed a public school \nofficial’s authority ever did extend to that point.  Second, the Appellees also fail to \nshow any case law undermining the basic proposition that outside law enforcement \nofficials have always been held to the same “probable cause” standard that would \nhave applied if they encountered the students outside of school. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 16    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nAdditionally, an examination of the Appellees’ position demonstrates its \nfundamental unreasonableness.   Essentially, the Appellees ask this Court to \nconsider that a public school teacher possesses an unrestrained authority to give \naway a student’s Constitutional rights to a law enforcement official.  The notion \nthat a state actor possesses the authority to waive a citizen’s Fourth Amendment \nrights is unprecedented, and threatens the very existence of the Fourth Amendment \nright.  As such, the Appellees’ position is inherently unreasonable.  For that reason, \nit does not merit the grant of qualified immunity. \n1.  The Established Case Law Restricts the In Loco Parentis Authority \nof Public School Officials to Those Matters Reasonably Related to \nthe Students’ Education and the Operation of the Schools, and This \nSuspicionless Search Did Not Involve Either. \n \nThe Appellees’ assertion of qualified immunity is legally infirm because it \nasks this Court to extend school officials’ in loco parentis authority well past its \nbounds.  Even if there had been some vague in loco parentis authority clinging to \nCoach Marchand at the time of the search, that authority has never at any point in \ntime had the breadth that the Appellees would claim.  Appellees fail to provide any \nresponse to the substantial authority presented to this Court that plainly \ndemonstrates that a public school official’s in loco parentis authority from its very \ninception has been confined to those actions which are necessary to permit the \npublic school officials to fulfill their duties to the students and otherwise operate \nthe schools.  The act of attempting to waive a student’s Constitutional rights vis-à-\n11 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 17    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nvis an outside police officer, seeking to perform a search for purely law \nenforcement purposes, falls far outside of the bounds of those duties. \nAdditionally, the cases relied upon by the Appellees in their Brief do nothing \nto broaden the limits of the in loco parentis authority of public school officials.  \nThe actions described in those cases instead clearly were within that established \nauthority.  For example, in the case of Wojcik v. Town of North Smithfield, 76 F.3d \n1 (1st Cir. 1996), the issue had been whether school officials had violated a fifth-\ngrade child’s right to freedom from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth \nAmendment when they transported the child from one school to another, over her \napparent reluctance.  Id. at 3.  The school officials had done so because an \ninvestigator from the State of Rhode Island’s Department of Children and Youth \nneeded to speak to the child about allegations that she was suffering physical abuse \nat home.  Id.  The school officials felt that the child would be more comfortable \ndiscussing the matter in the presence of her sister, who was at another school in the \ndistrict.  Id.  This Court did find that there was no unreasonable seizure in that \ninstance, and thus rejected the action on both Fourth Amendment and qualified \nimmunity grounds.  Id. \nThis Court noted that it was not unreasonable for the school, acting in loco \nparentis, to transport the child in this instance.  Id.  This Court did not fully explain \nthe application of the in loco parentis doctrine and the extent of its breadth and \n12 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 18    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nscope.  However, it is significant that in Wojcik, there was absolutely no suggestion \nthat the school officials were attempting to investigate any allegation of \nwrongdoing on the part of the student or to facilitate such an investigation on the \npart of a law enforcement agency.  Instead, the school officials were acting in \nfurtherance of an investigation of possible child abuse.   \nThat action could reasonably be construed so to fall within the traditional \nbounds of the in loco parentis doctrine.  The in loco parentis doctrine certainly \nextends to taking reasonable steps to ensure the physical safety of a child in one’s \ncustody.   See Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union, 182 Vt. 157, 162, 933 A.2d 200, \n205 (2007).  The in loco parentis doctrine could thus colorably authorize a school \nofficial to take reasonable steps to ensure that a child will not face violence when it \nis time for him to go home.  Indeed, a public school teacher’s unique relationship \nwith his or her charges arguably places that teacher in a better position than \nanybody else in the community to detect potential abuse, and ensure that \nappropriate action is taken. \nThe Appellees similarly misplace their reliance upon the case of Hampton v. \nOktibbeha County Sheriff Dept., 480 F.3d 358 (5th Cir. 2007).  That case involved a \n§ 1983 claim brought by a Mississippi school administrator against various \nmembers of the local sheriff’s department.  The sheriff’s department had reported \nto the school with an arrest warrant and demanded that the administrator produce \n13 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 19    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\none of his students.  The administrator refused to do so until he was shown the \nwarrant.  Once he was able to see that the student’s name was actually on the \nwarrant, the administrator produced the student.  The sheriff’s department, in turn, \narrested the administrator and charged him with obstruction of the arrest under \nMississippi law.  Id. at 361-62.   \nAlthough initially convicted, the administrator prevailed on appeal before \nthe county circuit court.  Id. at 362.  When directing a verdict for the administrator, \nthe county circuit judge noted that perhaps the sheriff’s office may have \nmisconstrued Mississippi law restricting access to juvenile records, and thus \nbelieved that they could not show the warrant to the administrator.  However, \nMississippi law did allow a parent or guardian the right to review a warrant.  \nBecause the administrator acted in loco parentis, the court reasoned, he qualified \nas a “guardian.”  Id.  For that reason, charges were without any merit, and, as the \nHampton Court ruled, could form the basis of § 1983 claim for a false arrest.   \nAlthough the Hampton case references the term in loco parentis, it is \nsimilarly unhelpful to the Appellees.  Hampton in no way can be read to stretch the \nin loco parentis authority to allow school teachers to consent to law enforcement \nsearches on behalf of their students.  Far from waiving the student’s own rights, the \nadministrator was fulfilling the duties that the in loco parentis doctrine imposes \nupon school officials.  Nobody would seriously question that the in loco parentis \n14 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 20    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\ndoctrine includes custodial and supervisory responsibility over the students during \nthe school day or during school activities.  See, e.g., Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse, 175 \nF.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 1999); Versprill v. Sch. Bd. of Orange County, 641 So.2d 883, \n886 (Fla. App. 1994).   At very least, school officials must exercise the care of \nreasonable parents.  A. Doe v. Cedar Rapids Community Sch. Dist., 652 N.W.2d \n439, 446 (Iowa 2002).  The established bounds of a school official’s in loco \nparentis authority thus inherently include the duty to exercise some level of care in \nexamining the bona fides of an individual asking that school officials yield custody \nto them – whether those making the request are police officers or otherwise: \n. . . common sense dictates that schools are the protectors of students \nduring school hours. The school must be careful with whom they \nallow students to leave their custody.  In most public schools, a parent \nis required to sign a document to take custody of their children from \nschool officials. . . . Therefore, the Court finds that the average person \nand especially police officers should know that documentation will be \nrequired to extract a student from school custody.  The Court also \nfinds that since the school acts in loco parentis, then a senior school \nofficial, such as the Plaintiff, can request to see a warrant before \nreleasing a student to law enforcement officials. \n \nSee Hampton v. Oktibbeha County Sheriffs Department, 2006 WL 270258 (N.D. \nMiss.) (overturned on other grounds).   See also Haney v. Bradley County Bd. of \nEduc., 160 S.W.3d 886 (Tenn.App. 2005) (finding that duty to exercise reasonable \ncare for student’s safety entailed duty to read even a parent’s explanation for \nsigning out children).  But see Snider v. Snider, 855 S.W.2d 588 (Tenn.App. 1993) \n(holding school not liable where uncle signed ill child out of school and \n15 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 21    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nsubsequently raped her, despite violation of school policy that children not be \nreleased early without parent’s permission).  As such, the traditional bounds of the \nin loco parentis doctrine would certainly include verifying a police officer’s \nauthority to remove the child from school. \nWojcik and Hampton, then, involved the school officials’ fulfillment of their \nduties to the student, specifically, those of providing for the reasonable safety and \nsecurity of their students.  In other words, the very cases cited by the Appellees do \nnothing more than to underscore the position stated in our initial Brief -- that the in \nloco parentis doctrine works to the extent that the school officials need to fulfill \ntheir educational duties.  However, as the cases cited by the Appellees also \ndemonstrate, the in loco parentis doctrine has not extended to public school \nofficials who undertake searches to fulfill some interest of their own, outside of \ntheir duties.  See especially Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, 302 (3d Cir. 2000) \n(holding that actions of public school swim coach in requiring team member to \nundergo pregnancy test outside the bounds of his duties).  Most notably, the \nAppellees cite to no cases which permit the exercise of an in loco parentis \nauthority to fulfill the agenda of third parties for their own purposes.   \nThe instant case clearly falls into the category of cases in which the school \nofficial acted beyond what was necessary to fulfill his educational duties.  The \ninstant case involves a school official who purportedly waived his students’ \n16 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 22    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nConstitutional rights to decline to consent to a search by outside law enforcement \nofficials.  That school official’s action fulfilled absolutely no interest of the \nstudents that could warrant the exercise of the in loco parentis authority by a \nschool official.  There was no disciplinary or tutelary purpose to the police search, \nbecause Coach Marchand had already satisfied himself that the boys had done \nnothing wrong.  (App. 58, 23:4-8.)  The search in no way contributed to the boys’ \nwell-being or safety.  That goal could have been fulfilled by simply asking that the \npolice disperse the crowd and allow the bus to be on its way – as was the students’ \nright.  Instead, the consent fulfilled only the agenda of third parties, the Coventry \nPolice.   \nAs such, Coach Marchand’s actions in authorizing the search exceeded the \nbounds of the in loco parentis doctrine, as illustrated in the cases upon which the \nAppellees place heavy reliance.  The Appellees have produced no cases that even \nsuggest that Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority ever extended to waivers \nof his students’ Constitutional rights.  On that basis alone, their legal argument \nfails. \n \n \n \n \n17 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 23    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\n2.   Because the Established Case Law Removed Public School \nOfficials’ In Loco Parentis Authority from Public School Officials \nfor the Purposes of Investigating Student Wrongdoing, and Held \nThem to a “Reasonable Suspicion” Standard, It Cannot Be Held \nthat Coach Marchand Had the Authority to Consent to a \nSuspicionless Search by Outside Law Enforcement. \n \n  The Appellees’ brief also fails to explain away one crucial point:  the fact \nthat the case of T.L.O. unequivocally affirmed that public school officials do not \nhave in loco parentis authority with respect to student searches.  Instead, T.L.O. \nmade it exquisitely clear that public school officials are state actors whose \nauthority is limited by the Constitution, including the Fourth Amendment.   Id. at \n336.  Once that point is acknowledged, qualified immunity could not attach \nbecause there is no reasonable way for the case law to be interpreted so as to give \nCoach Marchand authority to the police to conduct searches of his students, \nespecially in the absence of even reasonable suspicion.  Furthermore, T.L.O.’s \nstrictures on Coach Marchand’s authority have not been disturbed by later case \nlaw. \nT.L.O. explicitly stated that for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, \nCoach Marchand did not stand in the place of the students’ parents.  Id.  For that \nreason, the Appellees cannot claim, as a matter of law, that he possessed in loco \nparentis authority to conduct a search.  Because T.L.O. was extremely clear on that \npoint, a police officer could not claim a reasonable reliance upon that purported \nauthority. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 24    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nThe Appellees attempt to escape the natural consequences of the T.L.O. case \nby attempting to suggest that later cases somehow undermined T.L.O.  This claim \nis simply false.  It is true, as Appellees claim, that the disciplinary and educational \nresponsibilities possessed by public school officials are factored into an analysis of \nthe reasonableness of a particular search by school officials.  That factoring \ncertainly took place in the T.L.O decision itself.   \nThe T.L.O. case dealt with the issue of whether a school official could search \na student’s belongings in order to investigate a suspected violation of school rules.  \nId. 328.  When determining the circumstances under which school officials could \nperform such a search, the T.L.O. Court applied the classic “balancing” test, that is, \nit balanced the need to search against the nature of the intrusion.   Id. at 337, citing \nCamara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1730, 18 L.Ed.2d \n930 (1967).   The T.L.O. Court recognized that a search of a student and his \npossessions was a substantial intrusion upon that student’s legitimate privacy \ninterests.   Id. at 339.  At the same time, the T.L.O. Court also recognized that \nschool officials had a substantial degree of interest in maintaining order and \ndiscipline in the schools, and in being able to deal with misconduct quickly.  Id. at \n340-41.  Therefore, the T.L.O. Court did not require school officials to obtain a \nwarrant, nor did it require a finding of probable cause.  The T.L.O. Court instead \ndetermined that the “reasonable suspicion” standard would balance both the \n19 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 25    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\ninterests of students and public school officials:  “This standard will, we trust, \nneither unduly burden the efforts of school authorities to maintain order in their \nschools nor authorize unrestrained intrusions upon the privacy of schoolchildren.”  \nId. at 342-43.    \nUnder T.L.O., then, the responsibilities that the school officials had with \nrespect to their students defined the precise contours of the Fourth Amendment \nrights that students possessed vis-à-vis school officials.  However, T.L.O. made it \nvery clear that students were not in the thrall of their teachers with respect to the \nFourth Amendment.  T.L.O. even reinforced the premise that had guided the \npreceding line of cases involving student rights with respect to other Constitutional \nrights, that is, that public school students possessed Constitutional rights that were \nnot shed at the schoolhouse door.  Id. at 336, citing Tinker v. Des Moines Ind. \nCommunity Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); Goss v. \nLopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975). \nFurthermore, contrary to the position of the Appellees, the cases of Vernonia \nSch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995) and \nBd. of Educ. of Indep. Sch. Dist. No 92 of Pottawatome Cty. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, \n122 S.Ct. 2559, 153 L.Ed.2d 735 (2000) did not, and were never intended to, \noverturn T.L.O.’ s holdings or otherwise reinstate an in loco parentis regime.  \nInstead, the Vernonia and Earls case applied virtually the same analysis as did the \n20 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 26    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nT.L.O. case.  These cases dealt with random, suspicionless drug tests of students \nengaging in athletics and extracurricular activities.  The Court again balanced the \nprivacy interests against the interest in the search.  Vernonia and Earls did \nreference the term in loco parentis when discussing the school officials’ \nresponsibilities towards their students, and the consequent need to ensure their \nsafety, particularly when those students engage in potentially hazardous activities \nfor which an unimpaired head is needed.  Vernonia, at 661-63; Earls, at 836-838.  \nThat interest in student safety was factored into the balancing test, and held to be \nsufficient to justify the relatively minimal intrusion of a random drug test for \nstudents engaged in athletics and other extracurriculars.  Vernonia, at 665; Earls at \n838. \nHowever, neither Vernonia nor Earls ever held that school officials were no \nlonger deemed state actors.  Furthermore, neither Vernonia nor Earls granted \nschool officials the right to conduct random searches to find evidence of student \nwrongdoing for disciplinary or law enforcement purposes.  In both cases, it was \nnoted as a mark in favor of permitting the tests that the students who failed \nreceived no discipline, nor were the tests results revealed to law enforcement.  \nVernonia,at 658;  Earls, at 833-34.  T.L.O. thus remained undisturbed where \ninvestigations of student wrongdoing were at issue. \n21 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 27    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nMoreover, not a single lower court case cited by the Appellees even \nremotely suggests that any court in this nation is contemplating a retreat from the \nprinciples of T.L.O.  The Appellees cite to no case that signifies a retreat from the \nprinciple that for Fourth Amendment purposes, public school officials lack in loco \nparentis authority, but are government actors whose actions are Constitutionally \nrestricted.  Instead, the lower court cases cited by the Appellees that deal with \nstudent searches reiterate and apply T.L.O.’s  basic holdings.  Those cases continue \nto hold that a public school official is a state actor with respect to the Fourth \nAmendment.  Gruenke, at 300; Rhodes v. Guarricino, 54 F.Supp.2d 186 (S.D.N.Y. \n1999).  They also continue to hold that although students are not granted the full \npanoply of Fourth Amendment rights with respect to their teachers, neither do their \nteachers have the unbridled right to search where it is not necessary to fulfill any \ntutelary, disciplinary, or custodial responsibility.  Gruenke, at 302.  Teachers are \nstill held to a “reasonable suspicion” standard when undertaking searches to \ninvestigate wrongdoing for disciplinary purposes.  Rhodes, at 189. \nWe thus come to the inherent problems with the Appellees’ plea for \nqualified immunity.  The Appellees fail to address the basic flaws of their \nargument that Coach Marchand could reasonably be understood as a substitute \nparent who could give the Coventry Police permission to perform a search.  This \nargument fails in part because T.L.O. explicitly held that where the Fourth \n22 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 28    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nAmendment was concerned, Coach Marchand was not a substitute parent to the \nboys.  The Appellees produce no case law to the contrary. \nThe Appellees’ argument also fails because it is logically flawed.  Under \nT.L.O., Coach Marchand was required to have reasonable suspicion that a student \nhas broken school rules or the law before he could conduct a search of a student.  \nId., at 341-42.  On its face, it defies logic to declare that Coach Marchand could \ngive another individual permission to perform an act that he himself was plainly \nforbidden.  However, that is the very premise that the Appellees ultimately ask this \nCourt to accept.   \nCoach Marchand did not have reasonable suspicion, and the Coventry officers \nwere aware of that lack.  Many individuals other than the Central Falls players had \nbeen able to access the locker room, and both Coach Marchand and the Coventry \nPolice knew that the boys had been watched in the locker room and therefore had no \nopportunity to steal.  (App. 27-28, 12:7-20:2-13; App. 35, 57:18-14; App. 69-70, \n69:25-70:7; App. 76, 47:4-6; App. 83, 46:2-5.)  Because Coach Marchand had no \nreasonable suspicion, he had no authority to search the students --  and the Coventry \nofficers were aware of the facts demonstrating that lack.  Accordingly, the Appellees \ncannot reasonably be permitted to hide behind any consent from Coach Marchand.  \nTo declare otherwise is to declare that Coach Marchand could expand the police \n23 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 29    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nofficer’s authority beyond what even he himself possessed, and it was reasonable for \nthe police to believe that he could do so. \nFurther underscoring the basic unreasonableness of Appellees’ position \nregarding Coach Marchand’s authority is the fact that they were unable to cite to a \nsingle case that supports the position that an outside law enforcement official’s \nability to initiate a search expands simply because a child is in school custody.  \nThe Appellees did not even respond to the lengthy case law demonstrating that \noutside law officials continue to be held to a “probable cause” standard when \ninitiating searches of students.  Appellees also made no response to the case of \nPicha v. Wielgos, 410 F.Supp. 1214 (N.D. Ill. 1976).  That case, cited in \nAppellant’s principal Brief, clearly held that public school students’ Fourth \nAmendment rights against outside law enforcement officials were not to be \ndiminished by that child’s presence in school – despite the school officials’ consent \nto that search.  Id. at 1218. \nThe Appellees instead apparently ask this Court to accept the notion that a \npublic school official may be construed to have the unrestrained authority to waive \na student’s Fourth Amendment rights vis-à-vis outside law enforcement officials.  \nThis position is tantamount to suggesting that a public school student indeed \nsurrenders his Constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door.  The United States \nSupreme Court long rejected the notion that public school students stood in abject \n24 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 30    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nlack of Constitutional rights while at school.  The Appellees, however, invite that \nvery result by urging this Court to accept the argument that public school teachers \nmay simply give away a student’s Fourth Amendment rights to an outside police \nofficer without even reasonable suspicion. \nIn short, the Appellees’ interpretation of the case law regarding Coach \nMarchand’s authority was not only wrong, but unreasonable.  The clear case law \nheld that Coventry Police, as outside officers, would have to satisfy a “probable \ncause” standard if they wanted to conduct a nonconsensual search of the boys – \neven if they were at school.  See Tywane H., 933 P.2d at 255; M.J.,, 399 So.2d at \n998; Waters, 311 at 837-38; Thomas B.D., 486 S.E.2d at 505-06; F.P. , 528 So.2d \nat 1254.  They could not look to Coach Marchand to grant them greater power to \nsearch than they would have otherwise possessed.  T.L.O. had clearly stripped \nCoach Marchand of in loco parentis authority for Fourth Amendment purposes.  \nFurthermore, because the Coventry Police were seeking to conduct a search with \nno reasonable suspicion, the Coventry Police officers were asking for authority to \nsearch that exceeded even that possessed by Coach Marchand himself.  This is not \na reasonable construction of the case law.  Accordingly, qualified immunity cannot \napply here. \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 31    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nC.  SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE EXISTED ON THE RECORD TO \nCREATE A MATERIAL ISSUE OF FACT AS TO WHETHER \nTHE COVENTRY POLICE ACTED OUT OF RACIAL \nANIMUS. \n \nThe Appellees also strenuously argue that there is no evidence on the record \nto demonstrate that the Coventry Police in any way acted out of any racial animus \nwhen determining to perform the search.  The Appellees continue to argue that \nthere is no evidence of any bias on behalf of the Coventry Police themselves.  The \nAppellees also argue that there is no evidence that the Coventry Police acted so as \nto give effect to the racial animus of the crowd.  The Appellees, however, cannot \nescape the great amount of evidence creating at least a triable issue of whether the \nCoventry Police acted out of racial bias, whether their own or that of the crowd. \nThe Appellees still fail to provide a single plausible explanation of why they \nsingled out the Hispanic Central Falls students for the search, without ever \ndemanding a search of their peers from the predominately-white Coventry.  That \ngross disparity in treatment between individuals of different races, who are \notherwise similarly situated, without any other reasonable explanation, is sufficient \nto support a finding of racial discrimination.   Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, \n242, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2049, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976).     \nThe Appellees would have this Court believe that the differential treatment \nof the Central Falls students was justifiable solely because the Central Falls \nstudents had been accused of the theft when the Coventry students had not.  Under \n26 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 32    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nthe particular facts of this case, the mere fact of the accusation does not render the \ndifferential treatment justifiable.  As set out in our principal Brief, the Coventry \nPolice officers knew perfectly well that there was even less reason to suspect the \nCentral Falls players than anybody else on the field that day.  That included \nevidence that the Coventry Police knew that the boys had been watched while they \nwere in the locker room.  (App. 35, 57:18-14.)   The Appellees utterly fail to \naddress that evidence. \nIn addition, the Appellees try to foreclose the claim that the Coventry Police \nacted at the behest of a racist mob by arguing that the Coventry Police did not \nknow of the Coventry mob’s racist animus.  This argument is presented for the first \ntime on appeal.   In support of their position, they point to the testimony of the \nCoventry Police and Coach Marchand that they themselves heard no racist \nremarks.  (Appellee Br., p. 44.)  The Appellees also assert that Coach Marchand \ntestified that at the time the police arrived, the crowd had not made racist remarks, \nand that the Coventry Police had repeatedly told the crowd to be quiet.  (Appellee \nBr., p. 45.)   \nThis testimony simply does not work to resolve the issue of whether or not \nthe Coventry Police were aware of the crowd’s racist sentiments.   At the summary \njudgment stage, the court does not attempt to resolve factual issues.  All that the \ncourt does is to determine whether there is evidence on the record that would \n27 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 33    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\ncreate a factual issue, but does not attempt to resolve it.  Morelli v. Webster, 552 \nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).   \nThere is evidence on the record to show that the specific racial harassment \ncontinued throughout the entire event, without substantial abatement.  As Coach \nMarchand also testified, before the police arrived, the crowd was declaring that the \nCentral Falls players were “from the ghetto” and therefore knew how to hide \nthings.  Coach Marchand also testified to hearing the Coventry mob declare that \n“those people” knew how to “lie good,” and could not be trusted.  (App. 58-59, \n24:15-25:25.)  Those themselves are racially charged statements.  Even worse, \nSteven Giraldo, who was sitting on the bus, heard members of the crowd making \nracial slurs, including one woman who called the team “spics.”  (App. 46, 27:13-\n28:5.)  \nThe police arrived at some time after that remark.  However, even with \npolice presence, the crowd continued to declare that Central Falls students were \n“good at hiding things, they’re sneaky you know it, search the coach.”  (App. 56, \n15:14-16:3.)  During the search itself, Steven Giraldo testified to having repeatedly \nbeen called a “spic” by the crowd several times after he and the other players had \nbeen ordered off the bus.  (App. 50, 41:13-42:5.)   M.R. similarly recalled racist \nremarks during the search.  (App. 33-34, 50:11-53:2)   Furthermore, Coach \nMarchand’s testimony indicated that the Coventry Police took no effective action \n28 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 34    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nto stop the harassment.  As Coach Marchand testified:  “You know, it was one of \nthose things where you tell the class okay you cut it out and you don’t really do \nanything and then two seconds later they’re talking again, you know.”  (App. 56, \n16:3-7; App. 59, 27:5-9; App. 62, 45:8-13.)  This evidence is enough for a \nreasonable jury to conclude that the Coventry Police were perhaps being less than \ncandid about what they had or had not heard that day. \nIn short, there is sufficient evidence on the record to create a triable issue as \nto whether the Coventry Police acted out of racial animus, whether their own or \nthat of their constituents.  The Appellees cannot ask that this Court ignore that \nevidence and grant summary disposition in their favor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116047762   Page: 35    Date Filed: 04/12/2010    Entry ID: 5436503\nIII.   CONCLUSION \n  For each and all of the foregoing reasons as well as the ones argued in \nAppellants’ Opening Brief, Appellant respectfully submits that the judgment and \ndecision from which they appeal should be reversed and the action remanded to the \nDistrict Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the directions and \nmandate of this Court. \n \n \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \n/s/ Vicki J.

INTRODUCTION \nThis matter comes before this Honorable Court on appeal of a District Court \nruling granting Appellees’ Motion for Summary Judgment on all counts contained \nin Appellants’ Amended Complaint.  The instant matter arose out of an incident \ntaking place on or about September 28, 2006.  The Appellants, who are Hispanic, \nwere members of the Central Falls High School Men’s Soccer Team.  The team \nhad travelled by bus to an “away” game in Coventry, a predominately white \ncommunity.  Their Coach, Robert Marchand, accompanied them to the game.  \nAfter the game, as the team was boarding the bus, the Coventry players accused \nthe Central Falls players of having stolen iPods and cellular telephones from the \nCoventry locker room.  An angry mob surrounded the Central Falls team bus, \nshouting racial epithets and demanding a search of the players.   \nThe Coventry Police swarmed onto the scene in four cruisers, lights flashing \nand sirens blaring.  The Coventry Police quickly learned that there was no cause to \nsuspect the Central Falls players.  Nevertheless, the Coventry Police singled out \nthe Central Falls players for the very search that the mob demanded.  The students \nwere ordered off the bus, and forced to line up against the bus and face the mob.  \nThis search lasted for an hour, and was conducted a mere six to ten feet of a mob \nthat continued to shout racial slurs.   \n1 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 12    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nThe Central Falls players brought an action against the Town of Coventry \nand its police officers before the District Court for the District of Rhode Island.  \nCounts I, II, and III were actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging \ndeprivation of the Plaintiffs’ rights to due process, equal protection, and freedom \nfrom unreasonable search and seizure.  The Plaintiffs also brought state law claims.  \nCount IV alleged an invasion of privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1.  Count V \nalleged a violation of Rhode Island’s relatively new Racial Profiling Prevention \nAct of 2004, R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-1 et seq.  Finally, Count VI alleged a violation of \nR.I.G.L. § 9-1-35, Racial/National Origin Intimidation. \nThe District Court granted summary judgment to the Coventry defendants \non all counts.   The District Court found that the officers were entitled to qualified \nimmunity with respect to the claims for the violations of the Central Falls’ players \nrights under the Fourth Amendment, and also under R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1.  As its \nbasis, the District Court ruled that Coach Marchand had given an uncoerced \nconsent to the search.  The District Court also ruled that the case law was not \nsufficiently clear as to whether Coach Marchand, a school official, lacked  in loco \nparentis authority over the players so as to authorize him to consent to the search. \nTherefore, the District Court ruled that the Coventry Police could reasonably have \nrelied upon Coach Marchand’s “consent” to the search.  The District Court also \nfound that there was insufficient evidence on the record to support an inference of \n2 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 13    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nracial discrimination on behalf of the officers, and thus dismissed the claims for \nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause, as well as R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-1 and \nR.I.G.L. § 9-1-35.  The District Court made a similar ruling on the claims for \nmunicipal and supervisory liability. \nThe Appellants take the position that except for the rulings on municipal and \nsupervisory liability, the District Court’s grant of summary judgment was in error.  \nThe case law is exquisitely clear:  Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority \nnever extended to consent to police searches at any point.  In particular, Coach \nMarchand’s in loco parentis authority, at least with respect to random searches \naimed at uncovering suspected wrongdoing, was clearly abrogated by New Jersey \nv. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985).  Accordingly, the \nCoventry officers should not have been granted qualified immunity.  In addition, \nthe District Court overlooked substantial evidence demonstrating that the Coach \nMarchand’s “consent” was produced by duress.  Additionally, the District Court \noverlooked substantial evidence demonstrating that the Coventry officers’ actions \nwere based at least in part on racial animus.  For these reasons, summary judgment \nshould not have been granted, and the Appellants should have been permitted to \nproceed to trial and finally vindicate their Constitutional rights. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 14    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nII.  STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION \nThe jurisdiction of the District Court over the complaint was conferred by 28 \nU. S. C. § 1331, its federal question jurisdiction.  The court was also empowered to \nhear the civil rights claims enumerated herein pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1343. \nAdditionally, the court was empowered to hear the state law claims presented \npursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1367. \nThe jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over the final judgment of the \nDistrict Court is invoked pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  On \nSeptember 11, 2009, the Decision and Order which is the subject of this appeal \nwas entered against the Appellant, with the final judgment entered the same day.  \nOn October 5, 2009, Appellants timely filed their notice of appeal with the District \nCourt. \nIII.  ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW \nA.  Whether the District Court erroneously found that the Coventry \nofficers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the alleged violations \nof Appellants’ Fourth Amendment rights, Due Process Rights, and Rhode Island \nGeneral Laws § 9-1-28.1 (invasion of privacy), in that the case law at the time of \nthe September 28, 2006 search of the Central Falls High School Soccer Team \nclearly demonstrated that Coach Marchand lacked authority to “consent” to a \npolice search for the members of the team? \n4 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 15    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nB.  Whether the District Court erroneously granted summary judgment to \nthe Coventry defendants, in that there was material evidence demonstrating that \nCoach Marchand’s alleged “consent” to the search of the Central Falls High \nSchool Soccer Team was produced by coercion? \nC.  Did the District Court erroneously grant summary judgment on claims \nfor violations of Equal Protection and Rhode Island General Laws § 31-21.2-1 \n(prohibition against racial profiling) and § 9-1-35 (racial/national origin \nharassment and intimdation), in that there was material evidence supporting a \nreasonable inference that the actions of the Coventry Police officers were racially \nmotivated?  \nIV.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  This is an appeal from a judgment entered in favor of Appellees following \nan order granting summary judgment on all counts of the Appellants’ Amended \nComplaint.  Appellants had brought action against the Town of Coventry and \nvarious of its police officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of \ntheir rights to unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to the Fourth Amendment \nof the United States Constitution, as well as their rights to due process and equal \nprotection pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.  Appellants had also alleged a \nviolation of their rights to privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1, as well as their \nrights to be free from racial harassment and intimidation pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 9-\n5 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 16    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n1-35, and also their rights to be free from racial profiling from law enforcement \nofficials pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-1. \n  After discovery, the Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on all \ncounts, which was granted in full on September 11, 2009.  The District Court also \nfiled a final judgment on the same day.  Appellants take the position that the \nDistrict Court’s ruling was in error, except as to the claims of municipal and \nsupervisory liability. \nV.  STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n  On the afternoon of September 28, 2006, the Central Falls Soccer Team arrived \nat Coventry High School for a game.  Among the players were Appellant Juan \nLopera, a senior, (App. 20, 6:11.), as well as juniors, Appellants M.R. and B.O. (App. \n36, 74:19-22; App. 38, 4:9.)   \nAs the visiting team, the Central Falls players as a matter of course did not use \nthe Coventry High School’s locker room facilities, but arrived to Coventry already in \nuniform.  (App. 65, 21:15-20.)  However, five or six of the Central Falls players \nneeded to use the bathroom before the game began.  (App. 20, 8:20-9:1; App. 27, \n9:12-10:5.)  The exterior door of the locker room was open.  Leaving the locker room \n                                                        \n1 In the Appendix, the relevant pages of deposition transcripts were reproduced as \nfour deposition pages per Appendix page.  The set of numbers immediately after \n“App.” thus refers to the Appendix page upon which the deposition pages can be \nfound.  The second series of numbers refers to the deposition page and line \nnumbers on which the cited material can be found. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 17    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ndoor open during practices and games was a well-known standard practice at \nCoventry High School.  (App. 65, p. 20:22-21:11.)   \nCoach Marchand brought the five or six players to the locker room because \nthey did not know where the bathroom was located.  Coach Marchand did not actually \nenter the locker room, but instead asked a security guard to go in with the players.  \n(App. 27, 10:6-11:20.)  Appellant Steven Giraldo, who was one of the players who \nused the locker room, similarly recalls seeing what he believed to be a security guard \nwalking back and forth while they were using the locker room, keeping an eye on \nthem.  (App. 44-45, p. 8:2-9:19.) \nThe game began.  There was a distinct racial divide between the teams.  The \nTown of Coventry is predominately white community, and its school population \nreflected that.  (App. 15, 22:1-5; App. 16.)  The City of Central Falls is far more \nracially diverse.  In October, 2006, white students were actually a minority; Hispanic \nstudents were the majority.  (App. 17.)  The Central Falls High School Soccer Team \nthat went to Coventry that day was entirely composed of Spanish-speaking Hispanics, \nwith the exception of one Portuguese player.  (App. 20, 9:2-7.) \n  That racial difference came into play on the field.  One player recalled that \nduring the game, he and his teammates were told to “go back to where you were.”  \n(App. 41, 36:2:14.)  At various times during the game, the Central Falls players spoke \nto their teammates in Spanish, whether on the bench or on the playing field.  The \n7 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 18    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCoventry players took umbrage and ordered the Central Falls players to “speak \nEnglish.”  (App. 23, p. 28:1-10; App. 26, 6:13-7:21.)  At one point, a Coventry \nspectator became displeased a maneuver made by Steven Giraldo, and called him a \n“spic.”  (App. 44, p. 5:21-7:9.)  The Central Falls players dealt with these actions by \nsimply ignoring them and playing the game.  (App. 26, 8:17-9:5) \n  With respect to the actual soccer game, at least, the Central Falls players were \nable to earn a draw.  (App. 57, 17:11-17).)  The contest with respect to their race, on \nthe other hand, went into overtime.  While the Central Falls players were walking \nback to the bus, Coach Marchand was approached by a group of about twenty youths.  \nAs Coach Marchand would later find out, these youths were members of the Coventry \nfootball team.  (App. 57, 18:4-19:6-7.)  These representatives of the Coventry football \nteam accosted Coach Marchand and demanded to know if he were the “F’n coach of \nCentral Falls.”  When Coach Marchand replied he was, these Coventry students \ninformed him: “Well, your punks stole all of our F’n shit and they got our ipods.”  \n(App. 57, 18:5-10.) \nBy this time, the Central Falls players had boarded their bus.  Coach Marchand \nboarded and told his Assistant Coach, Carl Africo, of the accusations.  (App. 57, \n20:12-15.)  Marchand explained to the boys that the crowd believed that the Central \nFalls players who went into the locker room had taken the missing items.  Marchand \ntold his team that he knew that they had not taken these items.  (App. 29, 29:10-23.)  \n8 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 19    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nThe boys who had used the locker room told Marchand that the security guard had \nfollowed them around for the entire period that they were in the locker room.  (App. \n27-28, 12:7-20:2-13.)  Nevertheless, Coach Marchand and Coach Africo searched the \nboys, as well as the medicine kits and ball bags.  (App. 58, 21:8-22:22.)  At the end of \nthat search, which lasted about 20-25 minutes, Coach Marchand was “completely \nsatisfied” that the boys had done nothing.  (App. 58, 23:4-8.)   \nWhen Coach Marchand was done, he found the Coventry Athletic Director \noutside the bus.  He told the Athletic Director that the Central Falls boys did not have \nthe items.  (App. 58, 23:20-24:4.)  By this time, a crowd of about 50-60 people had \ngathered outside the bus.  (App. 58, 24:6-10.)  Members of the crowd declared that \nthey knew the Central Falls players had taken the items.  The crowd also declared that \nthe Central Falls players were “from the ghetto” and knew how to hide things and “lie \ngood,” and could not be trusted.  The crowd was even demanding a search of Coach \nMarchand.  (App. 58-59, 24:15-25:25)  Some of those making these remarks were \nadults.  (App. 59, 25:1-8.)   Steven Giraldo, who was sitting on the bus, heard \nmembers of the crowd making racial slurs, including one woman who called the team \n“spics.”  (App. 46, 27:13-28:5.)  Some in the crowd said that the Central Falls team \nwas not leaving “. . . til we find the stuff . . .”  (App. 59, 25:5-8.)  At some point, one \nCoventry student even tried to board the bus to conduct his own search.  (App. 46-47, \n27:11-30:5.)  (App. 34, 53:5-12.)   \n9 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 20    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nWhile Coach Marchand was speaking to the Coventry Athletic Director, about \nthree or four Coventry Police cruisers arrived with their lights and sirens activated.  \n(App. 56, 15:14-16; App. 68, 38:7-39:2.)  These officers were Kevin Harris, David \nNelson, and Kevin Kennedy, and their supervisor, Sergeant Stephen Michaelides.2  \nThe Coventry officers parked their cars in front of and in back of the bus, which \nforeclosed the possibility of the bus moving.  (App. 61, 43:15-24.)  In any case, by \nthis time the crowd already had formed a semicircle that would have prevented the \nbus from moving.  (App. 47, 31:16-32:6.)  \nCoach Marchand and the Coventry Athletic Director spoke to the police.  The \nCoventry police officers admitted at deposition that Coach Marchand explained to \nthem that he had already searched his players.  (App. 59, 26:22-27:4; App. 71, 76:22-\n25; App. 76, 46:3-5; App. 82, 43:25-44:2.)  Coach Marchand, by this time very fearful \nof the crowd around the bus, appealed to the Coventry Police for their help:  “. . . what \nam I going to do, what are they going to do to us.”  (App. 59, 27:23:24.)  At that \npoint, the Coventry Police asked if they could search the boys.  (App. 59, 28:8-28:13.) \nAt deposition, Officer Harris testified that the second search by the police was \nnecessary:  “[t]o prove that, we don’t know if Coach Marchand is telling us the truth.  \nWe are investigating the situation.”  (App. 71, 77:1-4.)  Michaelides testified that he \n                                                        \n2 In February of 2008, Michaelides was promoted to Lieutenant.  (App. 80, 18:6-\n16.) \n10 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 21    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nhad told Coach Marchand that a police search of the Central Falls team would “. . . \nexpedite the process and eliminate them all as suspects.”  (App. 82, 44:1-6.) \nBy this time, it was not even fully clear whether a theft had even taken place, \nmuch less what exactly was believed to have been stolen.  The Coventry officers \nnever asked the Coventry students to make sure that they had not simply mislaid the \nitems.  (App. 75, 40:14-17; App. 89, 28:23-29:1.)  No serious effort was ever made \nbefore the search to determine exactly what items were missing.  All of the Coventry \nPolice officers also admitted at deposition that not a single one of them obtained any \ndescription of the exact type of iPod alleged to be missing, its color, or whether it was \nin a case.  (App. 69, 66:13-67:4; App. 75, p. 39:14-22; App. 78, 62:5-14; App. 82, \n45:16-19; App. 89, 27:1-18.)  No Coventry Police officer received any description of \nthe make or model of the cell phone alleged to be missing, other than perhaps its \nbeing a “flip phone.”  (App. 69, 67:5-9; App. 75, 39:14-22; App. 77-78, 61:19-62:4; \nApp. 82, 45:20-23; App. 89, 27:1-18.)  As matters progressed, students alleged that \nitems other than iPods or cell phones were alleged to be missing, such as books or \ncash, but the Coventry officers never even obtained a final accounting of all missing \nitems.  (App. 70, 71:4-12; App. 75, 40:7-13; App. 82, 45:10-14.)  \nThe Coventry Police officers justified their belief in the Central Falls players’ \npotential guilt on the basis that the Central Falls students had allegedly been in the \nlocker room from where the items had disappeared.  (App 69, 69:7-24; App. 75, p. \n11 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 22    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n40:1-6.)  However, the Coventry officers admitted that they knew perfectly well that \nthe locker room had been left open, and anybody could have accessed it  -- Coventry \nas well as Central Falls students.  (App. 69-70, 69:25-70:7; App., 76, 47:4-6; App. 83, \n46:2-5.)   \nThe Coventry officers’ view of the Coventry High School students, by contrast, \nwas far more charitable.  At deposition, the Coventry officers opined that all of the \nCoventry High School students on the scene were considered to be potential \n“victims,” even though not all of them had items missing.  (App. 70-71, 73:7-74:5.)  \nNo Coventry student was searched at any time.  (App. 70, 73:4-23; App. 76, 46:13-\n24; App. 83, 46:2-10.)  In fact, no Coventry student was even requested to submit to a \nsearch.  (App. 71, 74:4-7.)   \nCoach Marchand correctly believed that the Coventry Police did not have the \nright to search the boys.  (App. 61, 44:16-17.)  He felt that the police simply wanted \nto:  “. . . appease the masses over there that were crying for our heads.”  (App. 59, \n28:2-5.)   Even with police presence, the crowd outside the bus remained hostile and \nthreatening, repeatedly calling out remarks indicating that the Central Falls players \nwere “good at hiding things, they’re sneaky you know it, search the coach.”  (App. 56, \n15:14-16:3.)  The police took no action to stop the crowd.  Coach Marchand, a veteran \nteacher, described the situation:  “You know, it was one of those things where you tell \nthe class okay you cut it out and you don’t really do anything and then two seconds \n12 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 23    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nlater they’re talking again, you know.”  (App. 56, 16:3-7; App. 59, 27:5-9; App. 62, \n45:8-13.)  Coach Marchand’s bus was by now blocked in by both the police and the \ncrowd.  Coach Marchand fully appreciated the potential for violence that could result \nwith the large crowd.  (App. 56, 13:16-22.)  As Coach Marchand testified, he felt that \nhe had no other choice but to permit the police search.  (App. 61, 16:24.)   \nMarchand returned to the bus and told the Central Falls team that the crowd \nwas not going to let them go until the police searched them.  (App. 48, 36:1-8.)  The \nCoventry Police ordered the students to leave the bus with all of their belongings, to \nline up, put their bags in between their legs and wait for further instructions.  (App. \n30, 40:17-22, App. 59, 28:15-23.)  As ordered, the boys lined up with their backs to \nthe bus.  The crowd was about six to ten feet away.  (App. 21, 21:9-24; App. 50, 42:6-\n10.)  After the boys lined up, a Coventry police officer announced that they were there \nbecause there were things missing from the locker room.  The officer warned the boys \nthat if they had the items, they were to step forward or they would be arrested “right \nnow and not be able to go home tonight.”  The officer then announced that they would \nbe doing a search.  (App. 39, 27:21-28:6.)   \nThe police proceeded down the line to make their searches, with the crowd still \nlooking on.  In some cases, students were searched twice, by different officers.  (App. \n34-35, 56:8-57:14.)  Marchand recalled witnessing students’ bags placed on the hoods \nof the officers’ cars, and the police searching them.  (App. 60, 29:8-23.)  When a cell \n13 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 24    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nphone or iPod was found in possession of any Central Falls student, that student was \nrequired to prove that that item belonged to him.   In some cases, this was \naccomplished by the students’ naming items that were stored on these devices, and \nallowing the police to search the pictures, numbers, and data stored thereon to check \nfor that item.  (App. 33, 49:13-50:9; App. 51, 48:2-17; App. 52, 50:23-51:5.)   On \nother occasions, the Coventry officers would display the student’s electronic device to \nthe crowd and ask if it were the one missing.  (App. 23, 26:3-24, App. 39, 29:13-24; \nApp. 60, 29:8-23.) \nThe searches were not limited to the students’ belongings of their persons.  \nAppellant Lopera, for example, was asked if he had anything under his armpits.  He \nsaid no.  The police told him to pull up his shirt, and one officer touched him under \nthe armpits.  (App. 22, 24:9-11.)  Lopera was told to take off his sweater, and to \nstretch his shirt and pants to remove that nothing was in them.  (App. 22, 24:19-\n25:24.)  The Coventry police asked another student to empty his pockets.  (App. 40, \n32:2:4.)  Giraldo was required to lift his shirt to prove that he had nothing in his \nwaistband.  (App. 52, 49:20-50:5.)  Giraldo also witnessed another player next to him, \nPedro Hernandez, get patted down.  (App. 52, 50:12-15.)  A Coventry officer told \nAppellant M.R. to spread his legs and raise his hands straight out.  Beginning at \nM.R.’s ankles, he dragged his hands up his legs, ribs and arms.  (App. 32, 47:17-\n48:16.)  The Coventry officer also ordered M.R. to lift his shirt.  (App. 33, 49:2-3.) \n14 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 25    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nWhile the search was ongoing, the players continued to be harassed by the mob.  \nM.R. heard the crowd saying that because the Central Falls players were Hispanic, \nthat team should not be in Coventry or playing with Coventry.  (App. 29, 31:9-17.)  \nM.R., like his Coach, was fearful of being attacked by the crowd.  (App. 31, 41:22-\n23.)  The crowd repeatedly photographed the students during the search.  (App. 23, \n27:1-3; App. 29, 29:1-8, 30:5-11; App. 49, 39:13-17; App. 62, 47:17-19.)  The crowd \ncontinued to refer to the team as “Spics” and make other comments regarding the \nplayers’ race.  (App. 33-34, 50:11-53:2; App. 50, 41:13-42:5.)  During the search, one \nCoventry officer told M.R. that he thought the search was “stupid” because the coach \nhad already checked, and in any case the security guard had been with the five boys \nwho had used the locker room for the entire period.  (App. 35, 57:18-58:14.)  Another \nofficer heard this remark and laughed.  (App. 35, 58:20-23.) \nThis search lasted for about 45 minutes to an hour.   (App. 53, 53:8-23; App. \n60, 30:14-15.)  Even if a boy had been searched, he was required to wait outside the \nbus for the police to finish with all of the boys.  (App. 53, 53:13-16.)  Finally, the \nCentral Falls team was allowed to go home, with a Coventry police cruiser following \nthem out of town.  (App. 60, 31:17-22.) \n15 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 26    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nVI.  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  The District Court erred when granting summary judgment on the claims for \nviolations of the Fourth Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and Rhode Island’s \ninvasion of privacy statute, R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.  The District Court’s ruling was \nbased upon a qualified immunity defense.  The District Court ruled that there was \nat least some basis in the existing case law for a police officer to reasonably \nbelieve that Coach Marchand, as school official, possessed in loco parentis \nauthority over the team members, and that therefore a police officer could \nreasonably rely upon Coach Marchand’s “consent” to the search.   \nThis ruling was erroneous on two bases.  First, the District Court overlooked \nor disregarded material issues of fact supporting an inference that Coach \nMarchand’s consent was the product of coercion.  Second, the law could not be \nmore crystalline on the lack of Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority in \ncases of searches of students for investigation of wrongdoing.  As school official, \nCoach Marchand did possess a limited in loco parentis authority.  That authority \nonly permitted him to make decisions involving the students’ education and \ndiscipline.  At no point did that authority ever run to the extent of permitting \nschool officials to make legal decisions of this nature on behalf of their students, \nthat is, the decision to waive one’s right to withhold consent to a law enforcement \nsearch.  Furthermore, there is ample authority, beginning with New Jersey v. \n16 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 27    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nT.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985), that removed Coach \nMarchand’s in loco parentis authority with respect to Fourth Amendment issues, \nand reduced him to the level of state actor who could only demand searches of \nstudents to investigate wrongdoing where there was reasonable cause to suspect \nthat student.  To state that Coach Marchand could give consent to a suspicionless \nlaw enforcement search is wholly inconsistent with T.L.O. and its progeny. \n  The District Court similarly erred when granting summary judgment on the \nclaims brought against the Coventry officers for violations of the right to Equal \nProtection under the Fourteenth Amendment, R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-1 and R.I.G.L. \n§ 9-1-35.  All of these claims were based on the proposition that Appellants had \nbeen singled out for search on the basis of their race (Hispanic).  The District Court \nfailed to apply the appropriate legal standards.  The District Court insisted that the \nofficers themselves had to possess racial animus before an Equal Protection \nviolation could be supported.  This is a clear error of law.  It is well-established \nthat when a public official caters to the racial animus of his constituents rather than \nhis own, there is still a violation of equal protection.   \nFurthermore, the District Court overlooked material evidence supporting a \nreasonable inference that the Coventry Police officers had acted to satisfy a racial \nanimus, whether their own or their constituents.  This evidence includes the \ndisparate treatment between the Central Falls players and the Coventry students, \n17 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 28    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nthe lack of a rational basis for that disparate treatment, and the manner in which the \nsearch was conducted.  Instead, the District Court appears to have attempted an \nimpermissible factual finding that the difference in treatment was not based on \nrace. \nVII.  ARGUMENT \n  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nRulings on motions for summary judgment are reviewed on appeal de novo.  \nThe Stop & Shop Supermarket Company v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode \nIsland, 373 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 2004).  As in the lower court, this court determines \nwhether the record, including the discovery materials, creates a triable issue, that \nis, whether a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party, or \nwhether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Thomas v. \nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 40 F.3d 505, 508 (1st Cir. 1994).  The record is \nreviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Rossy v. Roche \nProducts, Inc., 880 F.2d 621, 623 (1st Cir. 1989).  All factual inferences must be \ndrawn in favor of the non-moving party.  See Rossy at 623.   \nThe standard is no different when analyzing a defense of qualified immunity \ngranted under summary judgment.  The Court accepts the version of the facts and \nmost favorable to the plaintiff, and applies the qualified immunity standards to that \nversion.  Morelli v. Webster, 552 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).  Similarly, this Court \n18 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 29    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ndraws inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  \nMorelli, at 25. \nA.  THE DISTRICT COURT ERRONEOUSLY RULED THAT THE \nAPPELLEES WERE ENTITLED TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY \nON THE CLAIMS OF VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH \nAMENDMENT, THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE, AND R.I.G.L. \n§ 9-1-28.1.    \n \nAs the District Court noted, the Appellees readily conceded that the search \nof the Coventry players had been conducted in total absence of probable cause.  \nInstead, Appellees’ bid for summary judgment was granted based upon a qualified \nimmunity defense.  The District Court found that Coach Marchand had given an \nuncoerced consent to the search.  The District Court then concluded that there was \nsufficient ambiguity in the case law as to whether Coach Marchand possessed in \nloco parentis authority over the players so as to give him authority to consent to \nthe search.  The District Court then ruled that this ambiguity was so great that a \nreasonable police officer would have believed that the reliance on Coach \nMarchand’s “consent” passed Constitutional muster, and applied the qualified \nimmunity defense to both the Fourth Amendment and Due Process claims, as well \nas those brought under Rhode Island’s invasion of privacy statute, R.I.G.L. § 9-1-\n28.1. \nIn actions brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a defendant can indeed avoid \nliability under the qualified immunity defense unless he or she should have \n19 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 30    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nreasonably known his or her actions were violative of another’s Constitutional \nrights at the time.  See Cookish v. Powell, 945 F.2d 441, 442 (1st Cir. 1991), citing \nNewman v. Massachusetts, 884 F.2d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1989).  Similarly, the Rhode \nIsland Supreme Court, although never having the opportunity to definitively decide \nthe question, has previously suggested that qualified immunity might apply to \ninvasion of privacy claims against state actors.  Ensey v. Culhane, 727 A.2d 687 \n(R.I. 1999); Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856 (R.I. 1997).   \nTo defeat the qualified immunity defense, it must be shown that the state of \nthe law, as it existed at the time of the search, would have put the public official on \nfair notice that his or her acts or omissions were unconstitutional.  See Hope v. \nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002).  This \ntest is entirely objective; the officer’s good faith belief in the Constitutionality of \nhis actions or omissions is irrelevant.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, \n816-20, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2737-2739, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  The court must \ninstead examine the controlling case law in its own jurisdiction at that time of the \naction or omission complained of.  Id.at 28.  If none exists, the court must attempt \nto determine whether there is consensus elsewhere.  Id.  In that quest, the court \nshould look to all available case law.  Hatch v. Dept. for Children, Youth and their \nFamilies, 274 F.3d 12, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2001).   \n20 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 31    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nIt is not required that the plaintiff produce pre-existing case law expressly \nforbidding the precise conduct in question.  See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. \n635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987); Bergeron v. Cabral, 560 \nF.3d 1 (2009), 11-12  If the authorities existing at the time are sufficiently \nparticularized so that a reasonable official could extrapolate from them and \nconclude that his particular action or omission would violate the law, then the \nofficial cannot assert the qualified immunity defense.  Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 \nF.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2003), citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. \n2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \nThe touchstone of the doctrine of qualified immunity is reasonableness.  As \nthis Court recently reiterated, the qualified immunity defense does not work to \nprotect the plainly incompetent.  Morelli, 552 F.3d at 18, citing Malley v. Briggs, \n475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).  By extension, the \nqualified immunity defense would not shield officers based upon a patently absurd \ninterpretation of the law. \nThe qualified immunity defense, if properly applied, should have failed on \ntwo grounds.  First, the law at the time of the search clearly established that Coach \nMarchand lacked in loco parentis authority, at least as far as giving consent to law \nenforcement searches.  Even as the in loco parentis doctrine was originally \nenunciated, that action would have been beyond his authority as educator.  More \n21 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 32    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nrecently, with T.L.O. , the Supreme Court specifically removed Coach Marchand’s \nin loco parentis status with respect to searches aimed at investigating wrongdoing.  \nUnder T.L.O., Coach Marchand, as school official, was a state actor, and could \nonly search a student to investigate wrongdoing if there was a reasonable suspicion \nof that student.  Id., 469 U.S. at 342.  That reasonable suspicion was absent here.  It \nis wholly inconsistent with T.L.O. to declare that Coach Marchand could authorize \nthe search of the students when he himself was forbidden to conduct that search.  \nFinally, even if we accepted the proposition that the officers could reasonably have \nconsidered Coach Marchand to possess the authority to give a valid consent, there \nwas material evidence supporting the inference that Coach Marchand’s “consent” \nwas coerced. \n1.  The In Loco Parentis Doctrine at No Time Allowed School \nOfficials to Grant Consents to Law Enforcement Searches \non Behalf of Their Students.   \n \nThe District Court's decision relied upon a superficial interpretation of the in \nloco parentis doctrine with respect to school teachers.  The District Court ruled \nthat because the term in loco parentis has been \"bandied about\" in various \ndecisions relating to school officials, the Coventry Police could reasonably have \nrelied upon Coach Marchand's \"consent\" as a valid means to obtain a search.  The \nCoventry Police, however, simply cannot be permitted to seize upon in loco \nparentis without a full analysis of how that concept applied to Coach Marchand. \n22 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 33    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCoach Marchand may have had some in loco parentis authority over the boys, but \nonly that which was necessary to ensure their good discipline and order while \nengaged in a school activity.  Giving consent to this police search extended far \nbeyond that authority because there was not sufficient relationship between the \nsearch and the students’ educational interests. \nThe term in loco parentis, of course, means \"in place of the parents.\"  Geibe \nv. Geibe, 571 N.W.2d 774, 778 (Minn.App. 1997).  In its fullest sense of the word, \nthe term in loco parentis implies one who has assumed the entire parental role, but \nhas not formally adopted the child.  In other words, the individual acting in loco \nparentis has accepted all of the responsibilities normally undertaken by parents, \nsuch as care, custody, support, and discipline, and, as de facto parent, is granted all \nof the duties and interests normally given to the parents.  See, e.g., State v. \nSherman, 266 S.W.3d. 395, 406 (Tenn. 2008) citing Volunteer State Life Ins. v. \nPioneer Bank, 46 Tenn. App. 244, 327 S.W.2d 59 (1959).   \nThe District Court correctly noted that the term in loco parentis has also \nbeen used in connection with the relationship between student and teacher.  \nHowever, with respect to school officials, the term in loco parentis has never been \nconstrued so expansively as to imply the full authority of the parents.  Stephen R. \nGoldstein, The Scope and Sources of School Board Authority to Regulate Student \n23 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 34    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nConduct and Status:  A Non-Constitutional Analysis, 177 U.Pa.L.Rev. 373, 378-79 \n(January 1966).   \nThe limits on the in loco parentis authority of school officials have long \nroots, reaching as far back as Sir William Blackstone, who appears to have been \nthe first legal authority to use the term with respect to schoolteachers.  Richard \nJenkins, An Historical Approach to Search and Seizure in Public Education, 30 \nW.St.U.L.Rev. 105, 114 (Spring 2003).  Blackstone thus framed the doctrine: \nThe father may also delegate part of his parental authority, during his \nlife, to the tutor or schoolmaster, of his child; who is then in loco \nparentis and has such a portion of the power of the parent committed \nto his charge, viz., that of restraint and correction, as may be \nnecessary to answer the purposes for which he is employed. \n \n1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 453 (1770).  (Emphasis added.)   The in loco \nparentis doctrine, from its inception, accordingly granted school officials only the \nauthority that was required for the school official to carry out his or her function as \neducator.  See also Axtell v. LaPenna, 323 F.Supp. 1077, 1080 (D.C. Pa. 1971); \nEdson v. Barre Supervisory Union No. 61, 182 Vt. 157, 161, 933 A.2d 200, 204 \n(2007), citing Eastman v. Williams, 124 Vt. 445, 448, 207 A.2d 146, 148 (1965); \nD.O.F. v. Lewisburg Area Sch. Dist. Bd. of Dir's, 868 A.2d 28, 36 (Pa. Cmwlth. \n2004); Smith v. West Virginia State Bd. of Educ., 170 W.Va. 593, 598, 295 S.E.2d \n680, 685 (1982); People v. Jackson, 319 N.Y.S.2d 731, 733-734 (1971); O’Rourke \n24 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 35    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nv. Walker, 102 Conn. 130, 128 A. 25, 25 (1925); James A. Rapp, Education Law, \n§ 8.01[2][b][ii] (2002).   \nThe limited nature of the in loco parentis acts has long been understood to \nlimit school official authority in a number of specific situations.  For example, a \nschool official lacks the inherent right to impose routine medical treatment or \ntesting on a student, at least where there is no emergency.  See Gruenke v. Seip, \n225 F.3d 290, 301-02 (3rd Cir. 2000); Guerrieri v. Tyson, 147 Pa. Super. 239, 421, \n24 A.2d 468, 469 (1942).  Those decisions clearly go beyond the educational \ninterests.  For another example, it has long been understood that school officials \nhave no authority to regulate student conduct outside the school, at least where that \nconduct has no impact on the school.  Hailey v. Brooks, 191 S.W. 781, 783 \n(Tex.Civ. App.1916) (school official lacked authority to require students to \nparticipate in boycott of store outside of school hours).   \nMost strikingly, many years before it was determined that students possessed \nany Constitutional rights vis-a-vis their school teachers, the in loco parentis \ndoctrine was applied so as to impose limits on school officials’ authority to search \ntheir students.  The case of Phillips v. Johns, 12 Tenn.App. 354, 1930 WL 1707  \ninvolved a student bringing action against school officials after they searched her \nto determine if she had stolen money from her teacher.  The Phillips Court used \nthis occasion to comment on the limits of the in loco parentis doctrine: \n25 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 36    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nThe weight of authority is that a teacher stands in loco parentis, but to \na limited, extent only. \n\"The delegation by the parent of part of his parental authority to a \nschoolmaster places the latter in loco parentis, and gives him the \npower to exercise such restraint and correction as may be necessary to \nanswer the purposes for which he is employed.\" 1 Bl. Com., 453. \n\"As a general rule a school-teacher, to a limited extent at least, stands \nin loco parentis to pupils under his charge, and may exercise such \npowers of control, restraint, and correction over them as may be \nreasonably necessary to enable him to properly perform his duties as \nteacher and accomplish the purposes of education.\" 35 Cyc., 1134. \nThe question whether this search was made for the benefit of Mrs. \nFelknor, to recover her money, or whether it was made for the ethical \ntraining of the child, was for the jury. A teacher cannot claim \njustification on the ground that he or she is acting in loco parentis, if \nthey search a child for the benefit of a third person. The relationship \nof teacher and pupil does not exist if the act is done for a third person. \nA teacher is given the powers of a parent over the child to the extent \nthat is necessary to educate him or her and to preserve order necessary \nto the carrying on of the same; but if the teacher undertakes to recover \nmoney for a third person, this is not within the scope of the teacher's \nauthority and employment, and the general law will apply to the case. \nId. at *2-3.  (Emphasis added.)  The Phillips Court, finding that the search had \nbeen for the benefit of the teacher, held that in loco parentis did not serve as a \ndefense.  Id. at *3. \nThere is nothing in the record that even remotely suggests that Coach \nMarchand ever assumed anything more than the limited in loco parentis authority \nheld by school officials, or that the boys’ parents ever made such a delegation.  \nCoach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority can only stem from his capacity as \nschool official.  That authority did not extend to providing consent to student \n26 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 37    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nsearches by law enforcement under this set of factual circumstances.  As school \nofficial, Coach Marchand did have some initial interest in determining whether his \nplayers had stolen from their hosts, and imposing discipline if they had done so.  \nNobody would deny that the in loco parentis doctrine does involve “. . . . the \npower and indeed the duty to ‘inculcate the habits and manners of civility.’” \nVernonia Sch. Dist. v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 2391, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 \n(1995).   Rhode Island even codified that duty in 1896 with the passage of R.I.G.L. \n§ 16-12-3.3 \nHowever, there is more than sufficient evidence on the record demonstrating \nthat the educational or tutelary interests of Coach Marchand in any search had \ncome to an end well before the Coventy Police arrived -- and that the Coventry \nPolice were well aware of that fact.  As the record reflects, Coach Marchand had \nexpressly told the Coventry Police that he had searched the students (rightfully or \notherwise) and had satisfied himself that they had taken nothing.  (App. 59, 26:22-\n27:4; App. 71, 76:22-25; App. 76, 46:3-5; App. 82, 43:25-44:2.)  Coach Marchand \nwas also aware that the boys had been watched in the locker room, and could have \ntaken nothing.  (App. 27, 12:7; App. 28, 20:2-13.)   The officers were similarly \naware of this.  (App. 35, 57:18-58:14.)  Having assured himself that nothing had \n                                                        \n3 “Every teacher shall aim to implant and cultivate in the minds of all children \ncommitted to his or her care the principles of morality and virtue.” \n \n27 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 38    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nbeen taken, he had thus fulfilled his disciplinary responsibilities over the boys, and \nhad no further interests in the search.   \nThe Coventry Police, on the other hand, acknowledged that the search was \nnot for any educational purpose, or to aid Coach Marchand in the fulfillment of his \nduties.  Instead, the investigation was solely for law enforcement purposes, that is, \nto investigate whether or not any of the boys had committed a crime.  The \nCoventry Police were even investigating Coach Marchand’s behavior, to see \nwhether Coach Marchand was covering up for his players.  (App. 71, 77:2-4.)  The \npurpose of the \"consent\" to search therefore was for the fulfilment of the Coventry \nPolice's law enforcement interests rather than any tutelary or disciplinary interest in \nthe student.  As such, the \"consent\" was outside of Coach Marchand's limited in \nloco parentis authority.  Phillips, at 2*-3. \nThe decision to consent to a police search in any case stretches far beyond \nschools and education.  Decisions regarding whether to waive one’s right to not to \nsubject to a police search implicate far broader matters than education or school \ndiscipline.  These decisions can put into motion life-altering events with \nconsequences extending far beyond an anticipated graduation date.  By consenting \nto a search, one does not only agree to relinquish one’s interest in privacy in the \nthing or place being searched, but also accepts that the fruits of that search might \nbe used as evidence against one, whether in a criminal or juvenile proceeding.  \n28 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 39    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nWhether a student should waive one’s rights in a criminal law setting is therefore \none that clearly goes far beyond an educator’s responsibilities.   \nIndeed, asking Coach Marchand or any other school teacher to assume the \nauthority to waive their students’ legal rights is tantamount to placing school \nteachers in the role of legal counsel to their students.  Few if any school teachers \nare qualified to accept that role.  Furthermore, Coach Marchand would have had a \nconflict of interest preventing him from taking that role.  Had the Coventry Police \nfound a stolen item in a Central Falls student’s possession that Coach Marchand \nhad missed, Coach Marchand’s posture with respect to that student would have \nimmediately become adversarial.  Coach Marchand, as school teacher, would have \nbeen duty-bound to refer the student to school administration for disciplinary \naction.  That disciplinary action could have included suspension from school, that \nis, a deprivation of the student’s right to receive an education. \n  Additionally, only a short period of time before this search, Rhode Island \nhad had the opportunity to impose limits upon the in loco parentis authorities of \nschool officials with respect to student encounters with police.  About one year \nprior to the subject incident, the General Assembly passed legislation governing \npolice interrogations of students while attending school.  P.L. 2005, ch. 409, § 1, \ncodified at R.I.G.L. § 16-21.5-3.  This legislation requires that before producing a \nsecondary student to the police for questioning, the school officials must take \n29 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 40    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\naffirmative steps to ensure that the student may first consult with his or her parents.  \nThis statute made it clear that the task of making legal decisions for the student in \nthis situation – such as whether to be interviewed or not -- was not to be delegated \nto the school administrators in an in loco parentis capacity.  Instead, the parents’ \ncontrol over these situations was to be preserved.  Given this statute, it is hardly \nconsistent to declare that Rhode Island school officials have an in loco parentis \nauthority to consent to a bodily search of the student by police. \n  In sum, then, contrary to the District Court’s belief, the law could not have \nbeen clearer:  Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority did not extend beyond \nwhat was necessary to fulfil his job duties, including ensuring discipline.  That \nunderstanding had been clear for many years.  That understanding did not extend \nto waiving students’ legal rights on their behalf.  In Rhode Island, that \nunderstanding had been reinforced with the passage of P.L. 2005, ch. 409, § 1 only \na year before the incident.  The evidence can certainly support a finding that the \nsearch by the Coventry Police was for their own law enforcement purposes rather \nthan any tutelary purposes of Coach Marchand.  On that basis, the Coventry Police \ncould not have reasonably relied upon any supposed in loco parentis authority \npossessed by Coach Marchand to perform their law enforcement search. \n30 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 41    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n2.  Pursuant to Clearly Established Fourth Amendment Case Law at \nthe Time of the Search, Coach Marchand Lacked In Loco Parentis \nAuthority to With Respect to Student Searches. \n \n    Even if our understanding of the limited nature of school officials’ in loco \nparentis authority would not be enough to clearly establish Coach Marchand’s \ninability to consent to search, the Coventry Police cannot surmount the clear line of \ndecisional law stripping Coach Marchand of in loco parentis authority with respect \nto searches.  When one recognizes that Coach Marchand’s authority to search was \nspecifically limited by the Supreme Court’s decision in New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 \nU.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985), it becomes immediately apparent \nthat Coach Marchand could not have consented to this particular search.  It is self-\nevident that one cannot give others greater authority than one possesses oneself.  \nBecause Coach Marchand was forbidden to search the boys under these \ncircumstances, he could hardly have given the Coventry Police the authority to do \nso.   \nEven the District Court decision conceded that there was a “logical appeal” \nto our argument.  Nevertheless, the District Court felt that because the term in loco \nparentis had been used in various cases, there was still some ambiguity about \nCoach Marchand’s authority that would allow the Coventry officers the benefit of \nqualified immunity.  The District Court’s decision fails to give due weight to the \nfact that over twenty years prior to the search, the T.L.O. Court had unequivocally \n31 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 42    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nfound that the in loco parentis doctrine simply could not be squared with the \nFourth Amendment of the Constitution.   The T.L.O. Court set out to resolve any \nconfusion about the status of school officials, for purposes of Fourth Amendment.  \nFrom thereon in, as far as the Fourth Amendment was concerned, school officials \nwere to be considered state actors rather than substitute parents:  \nNotwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment to \nthe activities of civil authorities, a few courts have concluded that \nschool officials are exempt from the dictates of the Fourth \nAmendment by virtue of the special nature of their authority over \nschoolchildren.  See, e.g., R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 (Tex. App. \n1983).  Teachers and school administrators, it is said, act in loco \nparentis in their dealings with students:  their authority is that of the \nparent, not the State, and is therefore not subject to the limits of the \nFourth Amendment.  Ibid. \n \nSuch reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the \nteachers of this Court.  We have held school officials subject to the \ncommands of the First Amendment, see Tinker v. Des Moines Ind. \nCmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), \nand the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Goss \nv. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975).  If \nschool authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional \nguarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to \nunderstand why they should be deemed to be exercising parental \nrather than public authority when conducting searches of their \nstudents.  More generally, the Court has recognized that “the concept \nof parental delegation” as a source of school authority is not entirely \n“consonant with compulsory education laws.”  Ingraham v. Wright, \n430 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 1402, 1407, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977).  \nToday’s public school officials do not merely exercise authority \nvoluntarily conferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in \nfurtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary \npolicies.  See, e.g., the opinion in State ex rel. T.L.O., 94 N.J., at 343, \n463 A.2d, at 934, 940, describing the New Jersey statutes regulating \nschool disciplinary policies and establishing the authority of school \n32 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 43    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nofficials over their students.  In carrying out searches and other \ndisciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as \nrepresentatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, \nand they cannot claim the parents’ immunity from the strictures of the \nFourth Amendment. \n \nId.,  469 U.S. at 336.   \nThe T.L.O. Court proceeded to enunciate the standards under which school \nofficials were permitted to search students suspected of violation of law or school \nrules.  Id., 469 U.S. at 341-42.  Although the T.L.O. Court was loathe to impose a \n“probable cause” regime upon school officials, the Court recognized a need for \nrestrictions on school officials’ ability to search students accused of wrongdoing.  \nUnder T.L.O., one must consider whether the search was justified at its inception, \nand whether the search was reasonably related in scope to the purposes of the \nsearch.  Id., 469 U.S. at 341-42.  A search by a school official is only justified at its \ninception if the school official has a reasonable belief that the search will uncover \nevidence of wrongdoing by the student.  Id.   The T.L.O. Court thus left no doubt \non the question that school officials lacked their former in loco parentis authority \nwith respect to searches aimed at uncovering student wrongdoing. \nInstead of considering this case law, the District Court instead found a \nsupposed uncertainty in the case law regarding the extent of Coach Marchand’s in \nloco parentis authority.  While it is true that the term in loco parentis appears in \nthe case law, the District Court’s view that that use created an uncertainty as to \n33 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 44    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCoach Marchand’s authority is simply not supported.  The cases cited by the \nDistrict Court dealing with school searches – Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, (3rd \nCir. 2000); Webb v. McCullough, 828 F.2d 1151 (6th Cir. 1987); and Rhodes v. \nGuarricino, 54 F.Supp.2d 186 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) -- did not remove any limitations \non Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority for purposes of Fourth \nAmendment analysis of a search aimed at uncovering student malfeasance.  Far \nfrom retreating from the “reasonable suspicion” standard for school officials \ninvestigating student wrongdoing, these cases reinforced it.  Webb, at 1154; \nRhodes, at 192.  They similarly did not leave open the possibility that police \nofficers could get “permission” from a school official to perform an utterly \nsuspicionless search.   \nFurthermore, neither the cases of Board of Education of Independent School \nDistrict No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 122 S.Ct. 2559, \n153 L.Ed.2d 735 (2002) nor Vernonia School  District v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 115 \nS.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564  (1995) muddied the Constitutional waters as much as \nthe District Court apparently believes.  Both decisions did use the term in loco \nparentis when holding that school officials could require suspicionless, random \ndrug testing as a condition of participation in athletics and extracurricular \nactivities.  These cases, however, were firmly confined to the class of “special \nneeds” searches.  Before such a “special need” is found, one must carefully \n34 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 45    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nconsider the nature of the intrusion, and balance that against the governmental \ninterest involved.  Vernonia, at 654-661.  In Earls and Vernonia, the evils that the \ntesting was to avoid were dangers to student safety and disruption to general school \ndiscipline due to illegal drug use.  Earls, 536 U.S. at 835; Vernonia, 515 U.S. at \n662.  Actions aimed at addressing those concerns were wholly within the \neducational mission.  This was particularly true in Vernonia, where there was \nevidence that the drug culture at the school in question had spiraled to epidemic \nproportions and was demonstrably affecting school climate, as well as evidence \nstudent athletes were being endangered by playing under the influence of drugs.  \nId.  \nMoreover, neither Vernonia nor Earls applied to situations in which the \nsearch was aimed at investigating student wrongdoing for disciplinary or law \nenforcement purposes.  When determining that the testing passed Fourth \nAmendment muster, both the Vernonia and Earls Courts counted it significant that \nthe results were not used for law enforcement purposes, or even school disciplinary \npurposes.  Earls at 833-34; Vernonia, at 658.  The in loco parentis authority being \nexercised in Vernonia and Earls, then, remained firmly tied with legitimate, \nrecognized educational purposes, those of maintaining student safety and general \nschool order, rather than a law enforcement purpose \n35 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 46    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nAccordingly, the holding of T.L.O. remained undisturbed in cases involving \ninvestigation of student misconduct.  With respect to the Fourth Amendment, \nCoach Marchand’s position was not in loco parentis.  Coach Marchand instead \npossessed the status of a government actor, whose authority with respect to \nsearches was wholly cabined by the “reasonable suspicion” standard.   \n3.  The Clear State of the Law Rendered It Unreasonable for the \nCoventry Police to Rely Upon Any Alleged “Consent” By Coach \nMarchand.  \n \nWe thus come to the major point upon which the qualified immunity defense \nought to have failed under the Fourth Amendment standards.  Because Coach \nMarchand plainly could not have conducted the search himself, it defies logic to \ndeclare that he could authorize the Coventry Police the permission to do the same.  \nTo declare otherwise potentially eviscerates the protections of the Fourth \nAmendment while students are at school.   \nUnder T.L.O., Coach Marchand himself could not have demanded a search \nof his students under this factual situation because there was an utter lack of even \nreasonable suspicion against the Central Falls players.  The lack of reasonable \nsuspicion appears to be virtually undisputable in this factual record.  From the \nbeginning of this incident, Coach Marchand himself never had any suspicions of \nhis team at all, whether reasonable or not.  Before the police arrived, he expressly \ntold his team that he did not believe the accusations of theft.  (App. 29, 29:2-23.)  \n36 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 47    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCoach Marchand would later declare that by the time that the police had arrived, he \nwas “completely satisfied” that the boys had done nothing wrong.  (App. 58, 23:4-\n8.)  Coach Marchand, lacking that reasonable suspicion, had no authority to search \nthe players at any point. \nThe Coventry Police officers themselves were well aware of that lack of any \nreasonable basis to suspect the Central Falls players.  At deposition, the Coventry \nofficers admitted that the locker room was open and available to all, and virtually \nany person could have entered and taken the items -- including Coventry students.  \n(App. 69-70, 69:25-70:7; App. 76, 47:4-6; App. 83, 46:2-5.)  The Coventry Police \nwere told that the students had already been searched by Coach Marchand.  (App. \n59, 26:22-27:4; App. 71, 77:22-25.)  The Coventry police and Coach Marchand \nwere also aware that the Central Falls players had been watched while they were in \nthe locker room.  (App. 35, 57:18-14.).  One officer even declared the search \n“stupid” because Coach Marchand had done his search, and because the boys had \nbeen watched in the locker room.  (App. 35, 57:18-14) \nWhen one fully considers all of this evidence, it is clear that all of the \nparticipants were well aware that there was not even reasonable suspicion against \nthe Central Falls players.  The District Court ultimately declined to determine the \nquestion of whether Coventry officers could colorably rely upon Coach \nMarchand’s “consent” to this suspicionless search in absence of a reasonable \n37 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 48    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nsuspicion.   However, such a construction of the law is absurd on its face.  It goes \nwithout saying that one cannot give another permission to do that which one is \nforbidden to do oneself.  If Coach Marchand could not have conducted the search \nwithout reasonable suspicion, he cannot be reasonably considered in a position to \ngive another person permission to do so without reasonable suspicion.  On that \nbasis alone, the Coventry officers could not colorably rely upon Coach Marchand’s \n“consent” when conducting their search, and qualified immunity should not have \nattached. \nThe District Court’s ruling has frankly disturbing implications for the future \nof students’ Fourth Amendment rights.  By suggesting that the officers could have \nreasonably relied upon Coach Marchand’s “consent,” the District Court has \ncontributed an “end run” around warrant requirements to every police officer’s \nplaybook.  If a police officer knows that he cannot obtain a warrant to search a \njuvenile, all that he needs to do is knock at the schoolhouse door, and obtain the \n“consent” of a school official to perform the search.  The District Court’s ruling \nhas suggested that the officer can reasonably rely upon that “consent,” and \ntherefore be shielded from liability.  Similarly, if a school official chafes at the \nrestraints of T.L.O., all that teacher needs to do is to call a police officer and give \n\"consent\" for that officer to search that student.   \n38 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 49    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nThe District Court’s ruling is thus not only illogical, but strips students of \nany realistic expectation of Fourth Amendment rights while at school.   This is \nparticularly true given the recent expansion of police presence in the schools, in the \npersona of the “School Resource Officer.”   The School Resource Officers are \nrapidly becoming ubiquitous in public schools across the country, as much a part \nof the school staff as the teachers.  Susan Black, Security and the SRO, American \nSchool Board Journal, June 2009, at 30.  Under these conditions, it is not difficult \nto fathom that collusive relationships between the schools and the police could \neasily develop, with both parties relying upon the “consents” of the other to \ncircumvent any Fourth Amendment limitations on student searches.   \nThe District Court’s decision also failed to acknowledge that even before \nT.L.O., at least one federal court had firmly rejected the proposition that law \nenforcement officers, in investigating a crime, could rely upon the consent of \nschool officials to search a student.   Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F.Supp. 1214, 1218 \n(N.D. Ill. 1976) involved an incident in which police had been summoned to a \nschool to investigate whether a student possessed drugs.  The police officers \ndirected other school officials to search the female students.  The Picha officers \ncertainly could have argued that the school officials had given consent to the \nsearch.  They had, after all, even gone to the extent of physically carrying it out for \nthe police.  Nevertheless, the Picha Court held that such a police-directed search \n39 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 50    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ncould not pass Constitutional muster based on the in loco parentis authority of \nschool officials alone:   \nThe court now considers the standard, under the facts presented at \ntrial, to which police must adhere to protect the rights of a student \nunder the Fourth Amendment. . . . As far as the police are concerned, \nsuch an investigation cannot come under the ambit of the state \ninterest that dwells under the banner of ‘in loco parentis.’  Although \nthe school may have an interest in the safety of its charges, either with \nregard to one student possessing drugs, or with regard to the \npossibility that that student would transfer possession of drugs to \nanother student, all it can do in furtherance of that interest is to locate \nand perhaps confiscate the drugs.  In the course of such a procedure, \nevidence may be acquired, as was the case in In re Boykin, supra, or \nas could have been the case in Potts v. Wright, 357 F.Supp. 215 \n(E.D.Pa. 1973), which may ultimately be considered to have been \nreasonably obtained and therefore usable in a criminal prosecution or \nin an adjudication of delinquency.  However, the evidence here could \nnot support a jury finding that the police were called merely in \nfurtherance of this interest.  Consequently, the substantial state \ninterest in the provision of education and the maintenance of school \ndiscipline cannot be here said to temper the application of the \nConstitution to a search caused by police for evidence of crime.  \nMoreover, whatever may be the consent to the discretion of the school \nofficials deemed constructively made by the parent or student, it \ncannot vitiate the constitutional expectation of privacy which decrease \nthe need for levels of suspicion and/or exigency in the conduct of a \ncriminal investigation.”   \n \nId. at 1221.  (Emphasis added.)  Thus, the Picha Court clearly held that outside \npolice officers were not permitted to take advantage of the student’s presence at \nschool and the school officials’ in loco parentis authority in order to gain a relaxed \n40 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 51    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nstandard for searches initiated by law enforcement to satisfy their own agenda.4  \nThis decision could easily be extrapolated to put Coventry officers on notice that \nreliance upon Coach Marchand’s “consent” would not pass Constitutional muster.   \nOther jurisdictions have echoed the Picha position regarding police in \nschools.  Outside police officers who initiate searches have always been held to the \nsame Fourth Amendment standards as any other police officer, both before and \nafter T.L.O.,   See State v. Tywane H., 123 N.M. 42, 46, 933 P.2d 251, 255 (N.M. \nApp. 1997); M.J. v. State, 399 So.2d 996, 998 (Fla.App. 1981); Waters v. United \nStates, 311 A.2d 835, 837-38 (D.C. App. 1973); In the Interest of Thomas B.D., \n326 S.C. 614, 629, 486 S.E.2d 498, 505-06 (S.C. App. 1997); F.P. v. State, 528 \nSo.2d 1253, 1254 (Fla. App. 1 Dist. 1988).  This is so even when the school \nofficials participate in the search.  M.J. , at 998.   Under these cases, the fact that \nschool officials had in loco parentis authority over the boys was ultimately \nirrelevant to any assessment of the legality of the Coventry officers’ search. \nThe District Court’s holding as it stands thus permits a public official to hide \nbehind qualified immunity even if the interpretation of case law being relied upon \nis, as here, wholly absurd and against the great weight of that case law.  In this \n                                                        \n4 Admittedly, some courts do recognize a distinction with respect to those officers \nassigned to schools, commonly referred to as “school resource officers.”  The \npurpose of these school resource officers is educational, that is, to maintain order at \nschool.  Even these school resource officers, however, are held to a “reasonable \nsuspicion” standard.  See Shade v. City of Farmington, 309 F.3d 1054, 1060-61 (8th \nCir. 2002). \n41 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 52    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ncase, permitting the officers to hide behind qualified immunity in this situation is \nactively dangerous to the Fourth Amendment rights of all students.  For that \nreason, the District Court’s decision must be overturned.   \n4.  The District Court Erred When Finding that Coach \nMarchand’s Purported “Consent” to the Search Was Not \nCoerced.   \n \nThe District Court also erred by making a factual finding that Coach \nMarchand’s “consent” had been voluntary, rather than the product of coercion.  In \nthe summary judgment setting, the District Court is not to make factual \ndeterminations, but is to determine whether or not there is any evidence upon \nwhich a reasonable jury could rely to support the legal claim.  Anderson v. Liberty \nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \nContrary to the District Court’s opinion, the evidence on record here more than \nsupports an inference that Coach Marchand gave his “consent” under coercive \ncircumstances that were in a large part created or allowed to continue by the \nCoventry Police.   \nIn order for a consent to a search to be valid, the government must show that \nthat consent was freely and voluntarily given, rather than the product of coercion.  \nUnited States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2008).  The question of whether \nthe consent was freely and voluntarily given is one of fact, and requires “. . . an \nexamination of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the relevant \n42 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 53    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ntransaction between law-enforcement authorities and the consenting parties.”  Id., \nciting United States v.

Furthermore, consent may not \nbe the product of an illegal detention.   United States v. Jenson, 462 F.3d 399, 407 \n(5th Cir. 2006).  Similarly, the threat of violence or deception may invalidate \nconsent to a search.  See United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 69 (1st Cir. \n2000); United States v. Kampbell, 574 F.2d 962, 963 (8th Cir. 1978)   \nThe District Court based its decision on the lack of coercion on two discrete \npieces of evidence in the record.  That evidence was Coach Marchand’s deposition \ntestimony, indicating that when he had considered whether to accede to the \nCoventry officer’s demand for a search, he considered the safety of his team, and \nthe fact that he knew that the team was innocent, but decide to take the “high \nroad.”  The District Court takes this isolated piece of testimony out of context and \nignores other evidence on the record supports a conclusion that the Coventry \nPolice had indeed coerced the consent of Coach Marchand.    \nFirst, the consent was obtained in a constructively custodial environment.  \nAt the time the Coventry Police arrived, the Central Falls bus was already blocked \nin by the mob and could not leave.  The Coventry Police blocked in the bus with \ntheir vehicles, thus contributing to a detention.  (App. 47, p. 31:15-32:6; App. 61, \n43 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 54    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n43:15-24.)  That detention, of course, was wholly unwarranted, since there was no \nprobable cause, or even reasonable suspicion.  Worse, once they got out of their \ncruisers, the Coventry Police at no point took any effective action to dissipate the \ncrowd.  (App. 56, 16:3-7; App. 59, 27:5-9; App. 62, 45:8-13.)   \nThe Coventry Police were fully aware that the mob’s actions and the \ndetention were causing Coach Marchand to become fearful for his players’ safety.  \nAt the time of the consent, Coach Marchand had appealed to the Coventry Police \nfor assistance in extricating him and his players from this dangerous situation, \nasking them:  “. . . what am I going to do, what are they going to do to us.”  (App. \n59, 27:23-24.)   (Emphases added.)  Instead of controlling the crowd and allowing \nthe players to exit in an orderly fashion, the Coventry Police determined that the \nsearch would be the manner in which this situation would be resolved. \n  Furthermore, there was an element of deception in the Coventry Police’s \nactions.  The Coventry Police portrayed their actions as helpful to Coach Marchand \nin his predicament, in at least appeasing the crowd and defusing a hostile situation.  \n(App. 59, 28:2-5.)  However, as the officers later admitted, that was not their true \nintention.  They had instead decided to determine if Coach Marchand was telling \nthe truth about the players – and seek evidence against the boys to be used against \nthem.  (App. 71, 77:1-4.) \n44 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 55    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nUnder these circumstances, a jury could find that the “consent” was the \nproduct of duress.  There are few situations more coercive than being held prisoner \nby an angry mob, while the police tacitly permit that imprisonment to continue – \nand even contribute to it.  Coach Marchand and his players had the same right to \npolice protection from wrongful imprisonment as anybody else on the campus.  \nThat protection was withheld.  Instead, it was implied that protection could only be \nhad if there was a consent to a search.  A reasonable jury could accordingly find \nthat any “consent” given by Coach Marchand was hopelessly tainted by coercion.  \nFor this reason, too, the District Court’s grant of summary judgment should be \noverturned. \nB.  THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED WHEN GRANTING \nSUMMARY SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON COUNT II (EQUAL \nPROTECTION). \n \n  The District Court also erred in granting Appellees summary judgment on \nCount II of the Amended Complaint.  Count II had made a § 1983 claim for \nviolation of Appellant’s right to equal protection.  The District Court found that \nsummary judgment was in order because the hearing judge believed that the \nAppellants had “. . . failed to produce evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable \njury to find that the officers’ conduct was racially motivated.”  The District Court \noverlooked key evidence demonstrating that the Coventry officer’s conduct was \n45 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 56    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nanimated by racial hatred.  Furthermore, the District Court also appears to have \nagain engaged in impermissible fact-finding.   \nThe District Court at least correctly recited some of the elements of an Equal \nProtection Claim.  The Appellants were required to show that the Coventry police \nofficers acted in an intentionally discriminatory manner.  Reese v. Jefferson Sch. \nDist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d 736, 740 (9th Cir. 2000).  An individual acts in with \ndiscriminatory intent where he or she acted at least in part due to the adverse effect \non the disfavored group.  Hayden v. Grayson, 134 F.3d 449, 453 (1st Cir. 1998).   \nWhere the District Court apparently failed was in applying the correct legal \nstandards for evaluating evidence produced in support of an Equal Protection \nclaim.  The District Court once again at least correctly recited some of the law \nregarding the nature of the evidence that may be used to support a claim of racial \nanimus.  As the District Court acknowledged, in this day and age, an individual \nwith racial animus will seldom be as obtuse as to directly express that animus.  \nTherefore, intent to discriminate may be shown by circumstantial evidence.  Judge \nv. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 77 (1st Cir. 1998).  As our Supreme Court stated in \nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2049, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 \n(1976):   \nNecessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be \ninferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it \nis true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.  It is \nalso not infrequently true that the discriminatory impact – in the jury \n46 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 57    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ncases, for example, the total of seriously disproportionate exclusion of \nNegroes from jury venires – may for all practical purposes \ndemonstrate unconstitutionality because in various circumstances the \ndiscrimination is very difficult to explain on non-racial grounds. \n \nAs the Supreme Court further illuminated in Village of Arlington Heights v. \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d \n450 (1977), there may be instances in which the nature of the disparity is so \nglaring, and the reasons supplied for the decision represents such a radical \ndeparture from normal standards, that racial discrimination can be inferred.  Id. at \n266.  Similarly, where the reason supplied for the disparity is patently false or \notherwise wholly undeserving of credence, racial discrimination can be inferred.  \nSee Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1073, 30 L.Ed. 220 \n(1886); Dailey v. City of Lawton, 425 F.2d 1037, 1039-40 (10th Cir. 1970).  See \nalso Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274-45, \n99 S.Ct. 2282, 2294, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979) (“If the impact of this statute could not \nbe plausibly explained on a neutral ground, impact itself would signal that the real \nclassification made by the law was in fact not neutral.”) \nWith these standards in mind, we turn to the evidentiary record.  A gross \ndisparity in treatment between the white Coventry students and the Hispanic \nCentral Falls students can certainly serve as evidence of discriminatory intent by \nthe Coventry officers themselves.  Washington, at 242.  The differences were \nindeed glaring.  The Coventry police singled out the Hispanic Central Falls players \n47 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 58    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nfor a search.  Their peers from predominately-white Coventry were not even asked \nto agree to a search.  (App. 70-71, 73:4-74: 7.)   At least one of the officers even \ninsisted on characterizing all of the Coventry players as “victims,” whether they \nhad claimed to be missing any item or not.  (App. 70-71; 73:22-74:3.)  The District \nCourt’s opinion does not seem to appreciate the full extent of the differences in \ntreatment and officer attitude towards the two groups of students.   \nFurthermore, the District Court seems to have failed to appreciate that there \nwas strong evidence supporting the position that the differential treatment was \nutterly lacking in any rational, believable basis.  Normally, when deciding to do a \nsearch, an officer would consider whether there was any particular reason to \nsuspect an individual.  A departure from normal standards can be counted as \nevidence of discriminatory intent by the Coventry officers themselves.  Arlington, \nat 267.  The District Court seems to have been very dismissive of the evidence that \nthere was no rational basis to suspect the Central Falls players any more than the \nCoventry students.   \nThat evidence is indeed overwhelming.  The Coventry Police, when \nconfronted at deposition, admitted that virtually anybody in that crowd, including \nthe Coventry students themselves, could have had access to the locker room and \ncould have stolen the items.  (App. 69-70, 69:25-70:7; App. 76, 47:4-6; App. 83, \n46:2-5.)  The District Court actually appears to have overlooked evidence on the \n48 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 59    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nrecord showing that the Coventry Police were fully aware that there was even less \nreason to suspect the Central Falls players than the others.  The District Court \nanalysis does not even reference the fact that Coach Marchand had told the \nCoventry police that he had already searched the Central Falls boys.  (App. 59, \n26:22-27:4; App. 71, 77:22-25.)  Even more tellingly, the analysis does not even \ninclude the evidence that during the search, one of the Coventry Police told a \nCentral Falls player that the search was “stupid,” because the Central Falls players \nwho had been in the locker room had been watched by a security guard.  (App. 35, \n57:18-14.)  In other words, the police knew perfectly well there was no legitimate \nreason to single out the Hispanic Central Falls players.   \nThe District Court’s opinion also ignored the fact the Coventry officers’ own \nexplanation for that differential treatment is patently unbelievable.  As noted \nabove, the Coventry officers explained the differential in treatment by declaring \nthat all of the Coventry students were “victims.”  (App.  70, 73:7-74:5.)  This claim \nis absurd because not every Coventry student was claiming to be missing items.    \nThe Coventry officers would later admit that the Coventry students were just as \nmuch in a position to have taken the items as the Central Falls students.  A \nreasonable jury could find that these stated “reasons” for treating the Central Falls \nstudents differently are wholly unworthy of credence, and, on that basis, find that \nthe real reason was indeed their race. \n49 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 60    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nThe District Court, in addition to overlooking this material evidence \nsupporting racial animus on the part of the police themselves, also appears to have \nbeen led astray on the question of whether the individual officers themselves must \nhave harbored racial animus in their own hearts before an Equal Protection \nviolation could be found.  As the District Court ruled:  “While the evidence may \nreflect the officers’ poor judgment in giving into an unruly mob and humiliating \nthe boys, it does not even approach discrimination.”  The District Court appears to \nhave overlooked the fact that the Equal Protection Clause is violated not only when \nthe governmental actor acts upon his own discriminatory intent, but works so as to \neffectuate the known discriminatory intention of others.  United States v. Yonkers \nBd. of Educ., 837 F.2d 1181, 1226 (2nd Cir. 1987).  \nEven if the Coventry police harbored no racial hatred towards Hispanics in \ntheir own hearts, there is certainly evidence that they put their police powers at the \ndisposal of a crowd that had a great deal of animus towards the Plaintiffs based \nupon their race.  The District Court acknowledges that the Coventry officers’ \nactions could be construed as a pandering to this crowd.  Furthermore, the manner \nin which the search was secured and executed could support a conclusion that the \nCoventry police had acted for the perverse benefit of a racist mob.  The search was \nconducted in the most publicly humiliating and dangerous fashion possible.   \n50 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 61    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nIt would have been entirely simple and reasonable for the Coventry police to \norder the crowd to clear off, or at least find a more secluded area to conduct the \nsearch.  Instead, the boys were marched off their bus, and arrayed before the \ncrowd, with their backs up to the bus.  (App. 21, 21:9-24; App. 50, 42:6-10.)  The \nmob was permitted to stay only about six to ten feet away.  (App. 21, 21:9-24; \nApp. 50, 42:6-10.)  The mob continued to shout racist slurs and engage in racial \nharassment of the boys, with impunity.  (App. 33-34, 50:11-53:2; App. 50, 41:13-\n42-5.)  The Coventry police forced the Central Falls players were forced to endure \nabout forty-five minutes to an hour in this vulnerable position.  (App. 53, 53:8-23; \nApp. 60, 30:14-15.)  When an electronic device was found in a Central Falls \nplayer’s possession, that item was flashed about to that crowd, and the player was \nrequired to defend his right to possession of that item in front of that crowd.  (App. \n23, 26:3-24; App. 39, 29:13-24; App. 60, 29:8-23.)   Under these circumstances, a \nreasonable jury could infer that the search was a piece of vicious street theatre \nproduced by the Coventry Police for the purpose of fulfilling the fondest racist \nfantasies of their constituency.   \nInstead of considering this evidence in the balance, the District Court, \nappears to have focused above all else on Coach Marchand’s “consent” to the \nsearch and his offhand remarks about his players’ having become the “prime \nsuspects.”  To the District Court, the “prime suspect” remark and the “consent” \n51 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 62    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nwere enough to justify any differential treatment meted out to the Central Falls \nplayers.  This focus on these two pieces of evidence, above all others, represents \nthe very type of weighing of evidence that is forbidden in the summary judgment \nsetting. \nIn any case, a reasonable jury could find that reliance on the “prime suspect” \nremark as grounds for the search was unjustifiable.  There is certainly enough \nevidence to show that it was taken wholly out of context.   Rather than Coach \nMarchand’s own assessment of his team’s potential culpability, it was better read \nas a reference to the crowd opinion.  In any case, Coach Marchand’s remark should \nnot have been taken in isolation, as it was accompanied by other information \nclearly exculpating his players.   \n  The District Court’s also erred in its focus on the alleged “consent” of Coach \nMarchand as a factor weighing against the racial animus of the officers.   Even if \nwe conceded that the Coach had the ability to give a valid consent, that consent is \nultimately irrelevant to the question of whether or not the Coventry officers \npossessed racial animus.  Even a consensual search, wholly permissible under the \nFourth Amendment, may be the subject of an Equal Protection claim, if it were \ninitiated by the officer based solely upon the individual’s race.  United States v. \nTravis, 62 F.3d 170, 173-74 (6th Cir. 1995); also Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. \n806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996).   \n52 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 63    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n  The totality of the evidence, then, would be sufficient for a reasonable jury \nto find that the Coventry officers had acted upon racial bias.  For that reason, \nsummary judgment should not have been granted. \nC.  THE APPELLANTS WERE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT ON COUNTS V AND VI (RACIAL PROFILING \nAND RACIAL/NATIONAL ORIGIN INTIMIDATION). \n \n  When granting summary disposition on Counts V and VI of Appellant’s \nclaims, the District Court relied upon the same line of reasoning as when disposing \nof the Equal Protection claims, that is, the purported lack of evidence of racial \nanimus.  This line of reasoning was similarly erroneous with respect to the claims \nof racial intimidation and racial profiling. \n  Under R.I.G.L. § 9-1-51, an individual may be found liable for \nracial/national origin intimidation under the following standard:   \n(a) Any person, who is maliciously subjected to an act or acts which \nwould reasonably be construed as intended to harass or intimidate the \nperson because of his or her race, religion, or national origin, may \nbring an action in the superior court against the perpetrator of the act \nor acts for compensatory damages including damages for emotional \ndistress. The court, in its discretion, may also restrain and enjoin such \nfuture acts by the defendant. \n \n  Similarly, Rhode Island’s Racial Profiling Prevention Act forbids the police \nto use race as a basis for their police acitivities: \nNo state or municipal law enforcement officer or law enforcement \nagency shall engage in racial profiling. For purposes of this chapter, \n“racial profiling” means the detention, interdiction or other disparate \n53 \n \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 64    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\ntreatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in part, of the \nracial or ethnic status of such individual, except when such status is \nused in combination with other identifying factors seeking to \napprehend a specific suspect whose racial or ethnic status is part of the \ndescription of the suspect, which description is timely and reliable \n \nR.I.G.L. § 31-21.2-3. \n \n  As cited above, there is ample evidence to support the inference that the \nCoventry Police singled out the Central Falls players for a search based upon their \nracial background.  That conduct alone would be sufficient to violate R.I.G.L. \n§ 31-21.2-3.  Additionally, under the circumstances of this case as described \nabove, that action could certainly have been construed as harassing and \nintimidating.  Accordingly, summary judgment should not have been granted on \nclaims brought under these statutes. \nVIII. CONCLUSION \n  For the above-referenced reasons, the District Court’s grant of Appellees’ \nMotion for Summary Judgment should be OVERTURNED in its entirety, except \nas to the Appellants’ claims for municipal and supervisory liability. \n \n              /s/ Vicki J.

SMITH,  United States District Judge. \nIn this action,  Plaintiffs,  now  former members  of the Central \nFalls High  Schoolboys  soccer team,  claim their civil rights were \nviolated when  they were subjected to a  humiliating search in front \n-\nof  a  crowd of unruly spectators by  the  police officers. \nWhile'  dismayed  and  disappointed  by  the  officers lack  of \nI \nprofesional  judgment  and  the  appalling conduct  of  the  crowd the \nl \nCourt is compelled to conclude that the police officers'  90nduct is \ncovered  by  the  doctrine  of  qualified  immunity.  Moreover, \nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  satisfy  their  burden  with  respect  to \ntheir  claims  of  discrimination  and  muni,cipal  and  supervisory \nliability.  SOl  for  the  reasons  explained  in  detail  below,  the \nDefendants'  Motion  for summary Judgment  is granted. \nI.  Factual \nOn  September  28,  2006,  the  Central  Falls  High  School  boys \nsoccer team played an away  game  Coventry High School.  The \nCentral Falls team arrived by bus.  Before  the ·game  began,  five or \nsix  Central  Falls  players  used  the  bathrooms  located  inside  the \nCoventry boys  locker room.  While inside,one o.f  the Central Falls \nplayers  noticed a  security guard keeping an eye  on them. \nThe  facts  described  are  taken  from  the  record  evidence \n. 1. \nincluding depositions of the relevant· players  in the controversy. \nWhile  reviewed  from  the  standpoint  most  favorable  to  the \nPlaintiffs,  as  required at  the  summary  judgment  stage,  the  basic \nfacts  are essentially undisputed. \n2 \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 72    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\n1: 08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Page 3 of 28 \nThe  game  was  played and  resulted in a  tie.  After  the  gamer  \" \nCoach Marchand  (the Central  Falls  coach)  sent his  team  to the bus \nand followed behind  them.  Before Coach Marchand  reached the bus, \napproximately  twenty  players  from  the  Coventry  football  team \nstopped him,  and in profanity-laced terms accused the Central Falls \nplayers of stealing t;!Ilectronic devices  (iPods and cell phones)  from \ntheCqventry locker room. \nCoach Marchand  told the football \"players that he would get to \nthe  bottom of  the  allegation and  had  them  follow  him  to the  team \nbus.  The  Central Falls players already were on the bus waiting to \nleave.  Coach  Marchand  entered  the  bus  and  told  his  players; \n\"everybody needs  to put their game  bag,  varsity bag\" and their\"book \nbags  .  .  .  on their laps.  The  coach and his assistant coach then \nII \nsearched  each  bag  for  the  alleged  stolen  items.  If  one  of  his \nplayers had an iPod or cell phone,  Coach Marchand  asked for proof \nof ownership.  In his deposition,  he characterized the search as a \ngood one -- \"I think we  did a  Columbo search,  you know CSI.\"  The \nI \nentire search took  twenty  to  twenty-five minutes  and  none  of  the \nmissipg  items were  found. \nWhen  Coach  Marchand  exited\"  the  bus the  original  group  of \nI \n\"twenty f90tball players had grown to about fifty or sixty students \nand  adults.  The  Coventry  Athletic  Director\" was  also  waiting. \nAccording to Coach Marchand,  at this point the crowd was  extremely \n3  \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 73    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCase 1 :08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Page 4 of 28 \nvocal,  shouting  derogatory  and  racist  remarks  at  his  team  and \nthreatening not  to disperse until the missing  items were  found. \nAs  . Coach  Marchand  began  to  discuss  the  situation  with  the \nCoventry  Athletic  Director!  the  four  Defendant  police  officers \narrived on scene.·  The officers entered the parking lot with sirens \nwailing and  \"boxed-in\"  t:tle.bus  with their police cruisers.  Coach \nMarchand and the Athletic DirectoI;: then brought the officers up to \nspeed on the situation.  Coach Marchand informed the officers that \nthe  crowd  suspected  his  team  of  stealing  (or  in  the  coach's  own \nwords:  that his players were  the  \"prime  suspects.  A discussion \nII) \nensued  and  at  some  point  after  a  \"pregnant  pause\"  in  the \nI \nconversation,  the topic of whether the officers could do their own \n, search came  up.  The  parties  agree  it was  at  this  point  Coach \nMarchand  consented  to  another  search  of  his  players.  (In  his \ndeposition,  however,  Coach  Marchand  explained  that  he  only \nconsented  because  he  felt  compelled  to  do  so  under  the \ncircumstances. ) \nAfter obtaining Coach Marchandl  s conse.nt,  the office:.;s ordered \nthe Central Falls players to exit the bus with their belongings and \nstand  with  their backs  against  the  bus.  Up  to  this  point,  the \npolice officers made  little to no  effort  to quell or disperse the \n4  \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 74    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCase 1  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Page 5 of 28 \ncrowd even  as  the  crowd  verbally  assailed  the  players  shouting \nl \nracist epithets and  accusations of  theft.2 \nThe  search  of  the  players  began  with  the  officers  ordering \neach  player  to  step  forward  one  at  a  time  with  his  bag.  The \nofficers then sorted through the contents  of  each bag  on  the hood \nof a  police cruiser.  If one of the officers discovered an iPod or \ncell phone,  he  held  it up  for  the-crowd  to see  -- purportedly  to \nallow the \"victims\" a  chance to identify the stolen property.  Some \nof the boys were  asked to stretch their waist band and  their \nshirt  so  the  officers  could  make  sure  they  were  not  hiding \n.anything and  a  few  of  the  boys  were  subjected  to  pat  down \nI \nsearches.  The entire search Rythe police all of which took place \nI \nin front  of  the angry mob  lasted approximately one  hour and none \nt \nof the missing  items were  found. \nthe  mob  persisted  in its boorish behavior,  even \nafter the search ended.  Concerned that the mob  would take matters \ninto its own  hands,  the  officers  in classic  too  little,  too  late \nfashion decided  for safety reasons  to escort the  bus  out of town. \nII.  Standard of Review \nsummary  judgment  is  appropriate  where  there  is. no  genuine \nissue  of  material  facti  and  the  moving  \"party  is  entitled  to \nFor example/  one player heard a  woman  in the crowd call the \n2 \nboys  \"spics Coach  Marchand  testified  that  people  in  the  crowd \n,II \nused phrases like;  \"those people,\"  \"they're good at hiding things,\" \n\"they're sneaky,  you know it,  and made  reference to the boys being \n/I \nfrom  \"the ghetto.\" \n5 \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 75    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCase 1  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Pa'ge 6 of 28 \njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law.

A genuine \nissue exists  if a  \"reasonable  jury 'could  return a  verdict  for  the \nnonmoving party,  and a  fact  is material  if it has  the,  \"potential \n1/ \nto affect  the  outcome  of  the  suit.

Although  not  alleged  in \nseparate counts  Plaintiffsl  Complaint also presents claims. against \nI \nthe Town and·the Defendant police chiefs for a  failure to train and \nsupervise  the officers.s  See Monell  of  Soc.  Servs.,  436 \nU.S.  658  (1978); \nA.  Qualified \nPlaintiffs allege the officers violated their Fourth Amendment \nright against unreasonable  searches.  On  this claim the officers· \nl \nhave  the  defense  of  qualified  immunity,  which  \"protects \ngovernment  officials  from  liability for  civil  damages  insofar as \ntheir  conduct  does  not  violate  clearly  established  statutory  or \nconstitutional  rights  of  which  a  reasonable  person  would  have \nknown.\"  Pearson v.  Callahan,  555 U.S.  129 S.  Ct.  808,  815 \n(2009)  (quoting  Harlow y.

Melo,  502  U.S.  21,  25-27  (1991).  Thus  the \nCourt·need not  consider each official capacity claim separately. \n5  During  oral  argument,  Plaintiffsl  counsel  clarified that \nthe  Complaint  indeed  contained  claims  for  failure  to  train  and \nsupervise.  However,  in  the  Court's.  view  that  is  debatable. \nNotwithstanding  the  inartfully  drawn  complaint, . the  Plaintiffs \nreceived  the  benefit  of  the  doubt,· but  because  the  Defendants' \nmotion only addressed the causes of action specifically delineated \nin the Complaint,  the Court allowed them to supplement their motion \nand address  the merits  of  the  two  additional claims. \n7 \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 77    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCase 1 :08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Page 8 of 28 \nreasonably  from  liability· and  \"applies  regardless  of  whether  the \nofficial's error is a mistak·e of law a  mistake of fact \nI  f \nor a  mistake based on mix.ed questions of law and fact.\"  1.l1..t.  at 815 \n(quoting  Groh  v.  Ramirez,  540  U.S.  551,  567  (2004)  (Kennedy,  J. \nf \ndissenting»  . \nDetermining whether a public official is entitled to·qualified \nimmunity  is a  two-step  inquiry.  Maldonado  v.  Fontanes,  568  F.3d \n263,  269  (1st Cir.  2009).  Under this test [a]  court must decide: \nl  \\\\ \n(1)  whether. the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make  out a \nviolation of  a  constitutional  right;  and  (2)  if  so,  whether  the \nright  was  'clearly  established'  at  the  time  of  the  defendant s \nI \nalleged violation.  Id.  (citing  Pearson,  129  S.  Ct.  at  815-16). \nII \nThe  clearly established prong has  two  aspects:  (1)  the  clarity of \nthe law at the time  of  the alleged civil rights violation and  (2) \nwhether  given  the  facts  o.f  the  particular  case  a  reasonable \ndefendant  would  have  understood  that  his  conduct  violated  the \nplaintiffs'  constitutional  rights.

Id.  at  820-21.  In some  cases,  including this one, \nthe  two-step  analysis  blends  together,  where  the  question  of \nwhether a  constitutional violation occurred depends on whether the \nlaw  regarding  the  officers'  right  to rely on  a  consent  to search \nwas  clearly established,  and,  if not,  whether the officers' actions \nwere  objectively reasonable.  See Anderson v.  Creighton,  483  U.S. \n635,  648  (1987)  (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting)  (noting  the  \"double \nstandard  of  reasonableness\"  that  apparently  applies  in  Fourth \nAmendment  cases where  immunity is invoked). \n1.  Constitutional Violation \nHere,  it  is'  a  close  call  as  to  whether  a  constitutional \nviolation occurred.  There is no question that tb.e Fourth Amendment \napplied to the search of the players and their belongings.'  See New \nJersy  v.  T.L.Q\"  469  U.S.  325,  337-338  (1985)  (\"A  search  of  a \nchild's  person  or  of  a  closed  purse  or  other  bag  carried  on  her \nperson,  no  less than a  similar search carried out  on an adult,  is \nof \nundoubtably  severe  violation  subjective  expectations  of \nprivacy.\").  And,  it is undisputed that  the police did not have  a \nsearch  warrant  and  the  search  of  the  boys  was  not  supported  by \nprobable cause;  See Arizona v.  Gant,  -- U.S.  --,  129 S.  Ct.  1710, \n1716  (2009)  (stating  that  warrantless  searches  are  per  se \nunreasonable  under  the  Fourth Amendment  and  justified only  under \nspecifically established and well-delineated exceptions).

A reasonable suspicion,  as opposed to propable causer \nis  required  because' Fourth  rights  \"are  different  in \npublic  schools  than  elsewhererll and  strict  adherence.  to  a \ntraditional  Fourth Amendment  analysis would  undercut \nneeds\"  that  exist  in  the  public  school  context.'

Actonr  515  U.S.  646/  656  (1995),. \nDefendants  concede,  at  least  for  purposes  of  this  argument/ \nthat it is unlikely a  reasonable  suspicion existed to  justify the \nsearch  of  the.  Central  Falls  players.  Insteadr  the  Defendants \ncontend no constitutional violation occurred because Coach Marchand \nconsented  to  the  search  in  loco  parentis.  Generally/  a  search \n'Conducted  pursuant  to  a.  valid  consent  is  constitutional. \nSchneckloth v.  Bustamonte,  412  U.S.  218,  222  (1973).  Furthermore, \nthe ability to give valid consent  is not  limited to a  person with \nactual authority to consent.  Illinois v.  Rodriguez/  497  U.S.  177/ \n185-86  (1990).  Consent  may  be  given  by .a  person  with  apparent \nauthority;  that  is:;  an  individual  'whom  the  officer  reasonably \nbelieves has authority to consent.  United Stateg v.

Coach ' Marchand' 8 \nauthority to consent on behalf of his players,  however,  is far from \nclear,  and even  though the existence of'apparent authority would, \nin essence,  dictate a  finding  of  no  constitutional violation,  the \nquestion  of  the  officers'  reasonableness,  in  the  context  of  a \n,  ' \nqualified immunity analysis,  are more  properly explored under the \nclearly established prong. \nTherefore,  the prudent approach in this case is to resolve the \nqualified  immunity  analysis  by  examining  the  clearly established \n'. prong,  leaving  the  question  of  whether  an  actual  constitutional \nviolation occurred to  the  side. \n2.  Clearly Established Right \nA right is cle1)l.rly established when \"the contours of the right \n[are]  sufficiently  clear  that  a  reasonable  official  would \nunderstand that what  he  is doing  that right.\"  Wilson v. \nLayne,  526  U.S.  603,  615  (1999)  (quoting  Anderson,  483  U.S.  at \n640).

All  the Court  is saying  is that  the  case law on \nthe limit.s of a  school official's in loco parentis authority in the \nspecific factual context of this case is not sufficiently clear so \nthat a  reasonable police officer would be on notice that searching \nplayers  based on the consent of  their coach is unconstitutional. \n16 \n\nCase: 09-2386   Document: 00116004296   Page: 86    Date Filed: 01/19/2010    Entry ID: 5409683\nCase 1 :08·cv-00123-S-DLM  Document 35  Filed 09/11/2009  Page 17 of 28 \nBased on all this,  it cannot be  said that the law in 2006  was \nclearly  established  concerning  whether  a  high  school  coach \nchaperoning  his  players  during  an  away  game  could  or  could  not \nconsent  to  a  search  of  his  players  by  police  in  loco  parentis. \nWhat  is  clear,  however,  is  that  Fourth  Amendment  rights  .\"are \ndifferent  in  public  schools  than  elsewherei'  [and]  the \n'reasonableness'  inquiry  cannot  disregard  the  schools'  custodial \nand  tutelary responsibility for  children.\"  Vernonia,  515  U.S.  at \n656.  .Therefore,  because  the  law  was  not  clearly  established \n.concerning Coach Marchand's authority to consent to the search,  the \nDefendant  officers were  entitled to rely on the  consent. \nPlaintiffs'  argument  -- that  if  a  public  school  official \ncannot  consent  to  his  own  infringements  of  students'  Fourth \nAmendment  rights,  T.L.O.,  U.S.  at  336-37,  then he  cannot \nauthorize another to accomplish the  forbidden act  -- is logically \npersuasive,  but ultimately unavailing to block qualified immunity. \nIn addition to the muddy state of the case law described above,  the \nargument  also overlooks  the question of the reasonab.1eness  of the \nofficers'  (mis) judgment.. Bergeron,  560  F.3d  at  12-13.  If  the \nofficers could reasonably have believed that they were able to rely \non Coach Marchand's  consent  (even if that belief was  wrong),  they \nwould  be  entitled to qualified immunity.

Given \nthe  state  of  the  law  at  the  time,  and  Coach  apparent \nauthority over his players,  it. was  reasonable  for  the officers to \nhave  believed  they  could  rely  on  Coach  Marchand's  consent  and \nqualified immunity  must  apply. \nAttempting to avoid this result,  Plaintiffs point to a  written \nCoventry  Police Department policy and R.I.  Gen.  Laws  §  16-21.5-3, \nboth of  which  deal  with  interrogating  minors,  and  argue  that  in \nlight  of  these  authorities  it was  clearly established that  Coach \nMarchand could not consent in loco parentis. s  This  argument  fails \nfor  two  reasons.  First,  the Coventry policy and  §  16-21.5-3  only \napply  to  questioning  and  not  to  searches i  and,  second,. these \nauthorities'  do  nothing  to  clarify  the  state  of  federal \nconstitutional law. \n\"Officials  sued  for  constitutional  violations  do  not  lose \ntheir qualified immunity merely because their conduct violates \nIn pertinent part,  the  statute requires  that: \n8 \nBefore  making  a  high  school  pupil  under  eighteen  (lB) \nyears  of  age  available  to a  law enforcement officer for \nthe purpose of questioning,  the principal of the school, \nor his or her designee,  shall  info,rm  the pupil  that  the \npupil has  the right to request  that his or her parent or \nguardian or an adult family member,  or person on the list \nof emergency contacts for the pupil be present during the \nquestioning. \nR.I.

Put  another· way,  \"a  state \nofficial's violation of a  state statute or regulation,  not  itself \nthe basis of  the federal  suit,  should not  deprive  the official. of \nqualified immunity from damages for violation of other statutory or \nconstitutional provisions.\"  Goyco de Maldonado v.

Island \nstatutes can determine whether federal law was clearly established. \nPlaintiffs also argue that even if the law on Coach Marchand's \nauthority  to  consent  was  not  clearly  established,  the  officers \nstill acted  unreasonably  because  the  consent  was  the  product  of \n>  \"  • \ncoercion and therefore invalid.

Knox County,  470  F.3d \n422,  426  (1st  Cir.  2006)  (stating  that  at  the  summary  judgment \nstage  a  conglomeration  of  conclusory  allegations,  improbable \ninferences,  'and  unsupported  speculation  is  insufficient  to \ndischarge  the nonmovant's  burden). \nWhile  the evidence may reflect the officers poor judgment in \nI \ngiving  into  an  unruly mob  and  humiliating  the  boys,  it does  not, \neven approach discrimination..  It is undisputed that Coach Marchand \ninformed  the  officers' that  his  team  was  under  suspicion  for  the \nalleged theft -- or in Coach Marchand's words  \"the prime suspects \n,II \nFurthermore,  the officers only conducted their search after Coach \nMarchand  consented.  The  officers'  conduct  in this  case  resulted \nfrom  the  information and consent  that Coach Marchand provided and \nnot  from any racial or ethnic bias.  Summary  judgment on Count  II \nwill therefore enter in Defendants'  favor. \nD.   'R. I.  Racial  Profiling  Prevention  Act  and  Ethnic \nIntimidation statute \nFor the reasons stated above with respect to Plaintiffs' Equal \nProtection claim,  summary  judgment must also enter on Counts V and \nVI,  brought under Rhode  Island'a  Racial  Profiling Prevention Act, \nR.I.

Laws§  9-1-35.  Both statutes require discriminatory animus. \nThe Racial profiling Prevention Act requires that an individual be \nsubject  to  disparate  treatment  by  a  law  enforcement  officer  or \nagencYt  in whole  or  in  part,  on  the  basis  of  race  or ethnicity. \nR.I.  Gen.  Laws  §  31-21.2-3.  Similarly the  Ethnic  Intimidation \nI \nStatute  allows  for  a  cause  of  action  when  a  person  has  been \n\"maliciously subjected to an act or acts which would reasonably be \nconstrued.as intended to harass or intimidate the  of \nhis or her race,  religion,  or national origin,\"  1.9:..t.  at §  9-1-35. \nPlaintiffs have presented no evidence from which a  reasonable trier \nof  fact ·couldconclude  the Defendants'  actions  were  motivated by \nthe  Plaintiffs'  race  or  ethnicity.  Again,  it  is  critical  to \ndistinguish between  the  racist behavior and .words  of  the  mob  and \nthose  of  the  officers.  There  is no  evidence  to  support  saddling \nthe  officers  with  the  idiocies  of  the.adults  and  students  in the \nmob.  Therefore,  Defendants'  Motion for Summary  Judgment  on CO'l.'l,Ilts \nV and VI  must  be  granted. \nE.

Plaintiffs have not  alleged either police \nchief  was  at  the  scene  or  had  prior  knowledge  (actual  or \nconstructive)  of  the  situation such  that  it could be  argued  they \nwere  deliberately  indifferent  in  failing  to  prevent  the  search. \nRather,  Plaintiffs rest their claims  for  supervisory liability on \na  theory of inadequate training.

Corcoran, Marc DeSisto, DeSisto Law, Providence, RI, for Defendants. \nDECISION AND ORDER \nWILLIAM E. SMITH, District Judge. \nIn this action, Plaintiffs, now former members of the Central Falls High School boys \nsoccer team, claim their civil rights were violated when they were subjected to a \nhumiliating search in front of a crowd of unruly spectators by the Defendant police \n\nofficers. \nWhile dismayed and disappointed by the officers' lack of professional judgment and \nthe appalling conduct of the crowd, the Court is compelled to conclude that the police \nofficers' conduct is covered by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Moreover, Plaintiffs \nhave failed to satisfy their burden with respect to their claims of discrimination and \nmunicipal and supervisory liability. So, for the reasons explained in detail below, the \nDefendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted. \n[1]\nI. Factual Background  \nOn September 28, 2006, the Central Falls High School boys soccer team played an \naway game against Coventry High School. The Central Falls team arrived by bus. \nBefore the game began, five or six Central Falls players used the bathrooms located \ninside the Coventry boys locker room. While inside, one of the Central Falls players \nnoticed a security guard keeping an eye on them. \nThe game was played and resulted in a tie. After the game, Coach Marchand (the \nCentral Falls coach) sent his team to the bus and followed behind them. Before Coach \nMarchand reached the bus, approximately twenty players from the Coventry football \nteam stopped him, and in profanity-laced terms accused the Central Falls players of \nstealing electronic devices (iPods and cell phones) from the Coventry locker room. \nCoach Marchand told the football players that he would get to the bottom of the \nallegation and had them follow him to the team bus. The Central Falls players already \nwere on the bus waiting to leave. Coach Marchand entered the bus and told his \nplayers: \"everybody needs to put their game bag, varsity bag and their book bags... on \ntheir laps.\" The coach and his assistant coach then searched each bag for the alleged \nstolen items. If one of his players had an iPod or cell phone, Coach Marchand asked \nfor proof of ownership. In his deposition, he characterized the search as a good one—\n\"I think we did a Columbo search, you know, CSI.\" The entire search took twenty to \ntwenty-five minutes and none of the missing items were found. \nWhen Coach Marchand exited the bus, the original group of twenty football players \nhad grown to about fifty or sixty students and adults. The Coventry Athletic Director \nwas also waiting. According to Coach Marchand, at this point the crowd was extremely \nvocal, shouting derogatory and racist remarks at his team and threatening not to \ndisperse until the missing items were found. \n210*210 As Coach Marchand began to discuss the situation with the Coventry Athletic \nDirector, the four Defendant police officers arrived on scene. The officers entered the \nparking lot with sirens wailing and \"boxed-in\" the bus with their police cruisers. Coach \nMarchand and the Athletic Director then brought the officers up to speed on the \nsituation. Coach Marchand informed the officers that the crowd suspected his team of \nstealing (or in the coach's own words: that his players were the \"prime suspects.\") A \ndiscussion ensued and at some point, after a \"pregnant pause\" in the conversation, \nthe topic of whether the officers could do their own search came up. The parties agree \nit was at this point Coach Marchand consented to another search of his players. (In his \ndeposition, however, Coach Marchand explained that he only consented because he \nfelt compelled to do so under the circumstances.) \nAfter obtaining Coach Marchand's consent, the officers ordered the Central Falls \nplayers to exit the bus with their belongings and stand with their backs against the \n\nbus. Up to this point, the police officers made little to no effort to quell or disperse the \ncrowd, even as the crowd verbally assailed the players shouting racist epithets and \naccusations of theft.[2] \nThe search of the players began with the officers ordering each player to step forward \none at a time with his bag. The officers then sorted through the contents of each bag \non the hood of a police cruiser. If one of the officers discovered an iPod or cell phone, \nhe held it up for the crowd to see—purportedly to allow the \"victims\" a chance to \nidentify the stolen property. Some of the boys were asked to stretch their waist band \nand lift their shirt so the officers could make sure they were not hiding anything, and a \nfew of the boys were subjected to pat down searches. The entire search by the police, \nall of which took place in front of the angry mob, lasted approximately one hour and \nnone of the missing items were found. \nUndeterred, the mob persisted in its boorish behavior, even after the search ended. \nConcerned that the mob would take matters into its own hands, the officers in classic \ntoo little, too late fashion decided for safety reasons to escort the bus out of town. \nII. Standard of Review \nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, \nand the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). A \ngenuine issue exists if a \"reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving \nparty,\" and a fact is material if it has the \"potential to affect the outcome of the suit.\" \nVelazquez-Garcia v. Horizon Lines of Puerto Rico, Inc., 473 F.3d 11, 15 (1st \nCir.2007). The Court views all facts and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nnonmoving party. Torrech-Hernandez v. Gen. Elec. Co., 519 F.3d 41, 46 (1st \nCir.2008). \nWhen the defense of qualified immunity is raised on summary judgment, as it is in this \ncase, the Court begins by \"identifying the version of events that best comports with the \nsummary judgment standard and then [asks] whether, given that set of facts, a \nreasonable officer should have known that his actions were unlawful.\" Morelli v. \nWebster, 552 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.2009). \n211*211 III. Discussion \nPlaintiffs' Complaint alleges six causes of action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nand state law. Counts I-III allege that the officers violated the boys' Due Process,[3] \nEqual Protection, and Fourth Amendment rights.[4] The remaining causes of action \nallege violations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1, Invasion of Privacy (Count IV); § 31-\n21.2-3 Racial Profiling (Count V); and § 9-1-35 Ethnic Intimidation (Count VI). \nAlthough not alleged in separate counts, Plaintiffs' Complaint also presents claims \nagainst the Town and the Defendant police chiefs for a failure to train and supervise \nthe officers.[5] See Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 \nL.Ed.2d 611 (1978). \nA. Qualified Immunity \nPlaintiffs allege the officers violated their Fourth Amendment right against \nunreasonable searches. On this claim, the officers have asserted the defense of \n\nqualified immunity, which \"protects government officials from liability for civil damages \ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 \nU.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 815, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. \nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Qualified \nimmunity shields officials who perform their duties reasonably from liability and \n\"applies regardless of whether the government official's error is a mistake of law, a \nmistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.\" Id. at 815, \n102 S.Ct. 2727 (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 567, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 157 \nL.Ed.2d 1068 (2004) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)). \nDetermining whether a public official is entitled to qualified immunity is a two-step \ninquiry. Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir.2009). Under this test, \"[a] \ncourt must decide: (1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the plaintiff make out a \nviolation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the right was `clearly \nestablished' at the time of the defendant's alleged violation.\" Id. (citing Pearson, 129 \nS.Ct. at 815-16). The clearly established prong has two aspects: (1) the clarity of the \nlaw at the time of the alleged civil rights violation and (2) whether given the facts of the \nparticular case a reasonable defendant would have understood that his conduct \nviolated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Id. A negative answer to either question \nresults in a finding of qualified immunity for the official asserting the defense. Starlight \nSugar, 212*212 Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir. 2001). \nThe order in which the questions are answered rests within the discretion of the Court. \nSee Pearson, 129 S.Ct. at 813 (holding that the inquiry need not be conducted in a \nstrict sequential order). A judge may skip ahead and decide whether the right at issue \nwas clearly established without deciding whether that right was violated. Id. at 820-21. \nIn some cases, including this one, the two-step analysis blends together, where the \nquestion of whether a constitutional violation occurred depends on whether the law \nregarding the officers' right to rely on a consent to search was clearly established, \nand, if not, whether the officers' actions were objectively reasonable. See Anderson v. \nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 648, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (Stevens, J., \ndissenting) (noting the \"double standard of reasonableness\" that apparently applies in \nFourth Amendment cases where qualified immunity is invoked). \n1. Constitutional Violation \nHere, it is a close call as to whether a constitutional violation occurred. There is no \nquestion that the Fourth Amendment applied to the search of the players and their \nbelongings. See New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 337-338, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 \nL.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (\"A search of a child's person or of a closed purse or other bag \ncarried on her person, no less than a similar search carried out on an adult, is \nundoubtably a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy.\"). And, it is \nundisputed that the police did not have a search warrant and the search of the boys \nwas not supported by probable cause. See Arizona v. Gant, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. \n1710, 1716, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009) (stating that warrantless searches are per se \nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and justified only under specifically \nestablished and well-delineated exceptions). A search of a public school student will \nsurvive constitutional scrutiny if supported by a reasonable and individualized \nsuspicion \"that the search [would] turn up evidence that the student has violated or is \nviolating either the law or the rules of the school.\" T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 342, 105 S.Ct. \n733. A reasonable suspicion, as opposed to probable cause, is required because \nFourth Amendment rights \"are different in public schools than elsewhere,\" and strict \nadherence to a traditional Fourth Amendment analysis would undercut the \"special \n\nneeds\" that exist in the public school context. Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 \nU.S. 646, 656, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 132 L.Ed.2d 564 (1995). \nDefendants concede, at least for purposes of this argument, that it is unlikely a \nreasonable suspicion existed to justify the search of the Central Falls players. Instead, \nthe Defendants contend no constitutional violation occurred because Coach Marchand \nconsented to the search in loco parentis. Generally, a search conducted pursuant to a \nvalid consent is constitutional. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 \nS.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Furthermore, the ability to give valid consent is not \nlimited to a person with actual authority to consent. Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, \n185-86, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). Consent may be given by a person \nwith apparent authority; that is, an individual whom the officer reasonably believes has \nauthority to consent. United States v. Carrasco, 540 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir.2008) (\"[S]o \nlong as law enforcement officers reasonably believe that the person who gives \nconsent has the authority to do so, they may rely on that consent.\"); United States v. \nMeada, 408 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.2005). Coach Marchand's authority to 213*213 \nconsent on behalf of his players, however, is far from clear, and even though the \nexistence of apparent authority would, in essence, dictate a finding of no constitutional \nviolation, the question of the officers' reasonableness, in the context of a qualified \nimmunity analysis, are more properly explored under the clearly established prong. \nTherefore, the prudent approach in this case is to resolve the qualified immunity \nanalysis by examining the clearly established prong, leaving the question of whether \nan actual constitutional violation occurred to the side. \n2. Clearly Established Right \nA right is clearly established when \"the contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that \na reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\" \nWilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999) (quoting \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034). The inquiry requires the Court to \nconsider the state of the law at the time of the challenged act, or in other words \n\"conduct the judicial equivalent of an archeological dig.\" Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 \nF.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc). If \"controlling authority\" on the issue does not \nexist, a plaintiff may point to a \"consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a \nreasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.\" Bergeron v. \nCabral, 560 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.2009); see Wilson, 526 U.S. at 617, 119 S.Ct. 1692. \nCareful attention also must be paid to the factual nuances of the case, so as to \nproperly define the right at issue. Wilson, 526 U.S. at 615, 119 S.Ct. 1692 (citing \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034); see also Bergeron, 560 F.3d at 11. And, \nwhen guidance concerning the right is lacking or unclear, qualified immunity attaches \nbecause the law does not penalize officers for \"picking the losing side of the \ncontroversy.\" Wilson, 526 U.S. at 618, 119 S.Ct. 1692; Joyce v. Town of Tewksbury, \n112 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.1997) (en banc). \"This is not to say that an official action is \nprotected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been \nheld unlawful, but it is to say that in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must \nbe apparent.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034 (citations omitted). At \nbottom, \"the salient question is whether the state of the law at the time of the alleged \nviolation gave the defendant fair warning that his particular conduct was \nunconstitutional.\" Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 269. \nDefendants contend that in the eyes of the officers at the scene, Coach Marchand had \nthe requisite apparent authority to consent to a search, and it was reasonable for them \nto perceive him as acting in loco parentis over the players. Plaintiffs respond that it is \n\nwell settled that the in loco parentis doctrine in the student search context cannot \njustify the search of a student. Plaintiffs do acknowledge that at one time the law \nconsidered a school official to act broadly in loco parentis, but they argue that over the \nlast thirty years, that notion has become seriously outdated. \nIn T.L.O., the Supreme Court appeared to soundly reject the doctrine of in loco \nparentis as a rationale to justify a search of a student: \"In carrying out searches and \nother disciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as \nrepresentatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they cannot \nclaim the parents' immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment.\" T.L.O., 469 \nU.S. at 336-37, 105 S.Ct. 733. Later, however, the Supreme Court added confusion \nwhen it referred to the powers school officials have over students 214*214 as \n\"custodial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not \nbe exercised over free adults.\" Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 655, 115 S.Ct. 2386. Vernonia \nacknowledged \"that for many purposes school authorities act in loco parentis with the \npower and indeed the duty to inculcate the habits and manners of civility.\" Id. (quoting \nBethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 684, 106 S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d \n549 (1986) (internal quotations omitted)). \nRecently, the Supreme Court passed up an opportunity to clarify whether the in loco \nparentis doctrine has any significance in school search cases. See Safford Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 2633, 2637, 174 L.Ed.2d 354 \n(2009). In Redding, the Supreme Court reviewed the conduct of a school official who \nsubjected a thirteen-year-old student to a search of her bra and underpants on the \nsuspicion that she was secreting prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The court \nheld that the search violated the student's constitutional rights, but because the \nrelevant law that surrounded the right was not clearly established, the school official \nwho ordered the search was entitled to qualified immunity. Id. at 2644.[6] \nIn light of the Supreme Court's silence on the issue and the rather clear language of \nT.L.O., a persuasive argument could be made that the in loco parentis doctrine serves \nno purpose in cases involving the Fourth Amendment rights of public school students. \nHowever, based on the full record of commentary on the issue, this Court cannot \nconclude that this was a clearly established principle of constitutional law in 2006. See \nMorse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 416 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 2618, 168 L.Ed.2d 290 (2007) \n(J. Thomas, concurring) (stating that at least nominally the Supreme Court continues \nto recognize the applicability of the in loco parentis doctrine to public schools). Indeed, \nsuch a conclusion is not possible without ignoring the Supreme Court's statements in \nVernonia and Frasier. \nA review of circuit courts' decisional law also contributes to the lack of clarity on the \nissue. The courts that have referred to the in loco parentis doctrine have done so in a \nway that makes it appear that the doctrine is a viable source of authority to justify a \nschool official's actions. See e.g. Hampton v. Oktibbeha County Sheriff Dep't, 480 \nF.3d 358, 362 (5th Cir.2007) (stating that school officials act in loco parentis in dealing \nwith students); Ramos v. Town of Vernon, 353 F.3d 171, 183 n. 5 (2d Cir.2003) \n(implying that in a public school the in loco parentis doctrine allows for a greater \ndegree of control over children); Gruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, 307 (3d Cir.2000) \n(\"Public schools must not forget that `in loco parentis' does not mean `displace \nparents.'\"); Wojcik v. Town of N. Smithfield, 76 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996) (indicating that \nschool officials acted in loco parentis in connection with a Fourth Amendment seizure \nof a child); Hassan v. Lubbock Indep. Sch. Dist., 55 F.3d 1075, 1080 n. 15 (5th \nCir.1995) (citing Webb v. McCullough, 828 F.2d 1151 (6th Cir.1987) (stating that \nschool field trips often present greater, not lesser, challenges to school officials and \njustify in loco parentis authority as well as official authority)); Rhodes v. Guarricino, 54 \n\n215*215 F.Supp.2d 186, 192 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (\"Much more than when on their home \ncampus, defendants were acting in loco parentis to plaintiffs.\"); see also Seal v. \nMorgan, 229 F.3d 567, 582 (6th Cir.2000) (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting in part) (\"In \naddition to their duty to educate, schools act in loco parentis.\"); Schleifer by Schleifer \nv. City of Charlottesville, 159 F.3d 843, 861 (4th Cir. 1998) (Michael, J., dissenting) \n(\"the teachers and administrators of a public school will act `in loco parentis' while \nchildren are in their physical custody because parents `delegate part of [their] \nauthority' to the school by placing their children under its instruction\"); see generally \nKnox County Educ. Ass'n v. Knox County Bd. of Educ., 158 F.3d 361, 375 (6th \nCir.1998) (upholding a program of conducting suspicionless drug testing of teachers \nand administrators in part because of the in loco parentis obligations imposed upon \nthem by state statute). But see Tenenbaum v. Williams, 193 F.3d 581, 594 n. 9 (2d \nCir.1999) (\"the Supreme Court has rejected the notion that public schools generally \nact in loco parentis in their dealings with students\").[7] Courts have bandied about the \nphrase to such an extent that it is far from clear exactly what role the in loco parentis \ndoctrine plays in a Fourth Amendment analysis, particularly in the specific factual \ncontext presented here. \nBased on all this, it cannot be said that the law in 2006 was clearly established \nconcerning whether a high school coach chaperoning his players during an away \ngame could or could not consent to a search of his players by police in loco parentis. \nWhat is clear, however, is that Fourth Amendment rights \"are different in public \nschools than elsewhere; [and] the `reasonableness' inquiry cannot disregard the \nschools' custodial and tutelary responsibility for children.\" Vernonia, 515 U.S. at 656, \n115 S.Ct. 2386. Therefore, because the law was not clearly established concerning \nCoach Marchand's authority to consent to the search, the Defendant officers were \nentitled to rely on the consent. \nPlaintiffs' argument—that if a public school official cannot consent to his own \ninfringements of students' Fourth Amendment rights, see T.L.O., 469 U.S. at 336-37, \n105 S.Ct. 733, then he cannot authorize another to accomplish the forbidden act— is \nlogically persuasive, but ultimately unavailing to block qualified immunity. In addition to \nthe muddy state of the case law described above, the argument also overlooks the \nquestion of the reasonableness of the officers' (mis)judgment. Bergeron, 560 F.3d at \n12-13. If the officers could reasonably have believed that they were able to rely on \nCoach Marchand's consent (even if that belief was wrong), they would be entitled to \nqualified immunity. Id. at 13; Jennings v. Jones, 499 F.3d 2, 18 (1st Cir.2007) (\"[E]ven \nif an officer's conduct violated clearly established Fourth Amendment law, he may still \nbe eligible for qualified immunity if he was reasonably mistaken as to the degree of \nforce he should have used.\"). Given the state of the law at the time, and Coach \nMarchand's apparent authority over his players, it was reasonable for the officers to \nhave believed they could rely on Coach Marchand's consent and qualified immunity \nmust apply. \nAttempting to avoid this result, Plaintiffs point to a written Coventry Police 216*216 \nDepartment policy and R.I. Gen. Laws § 16-21.5-3, both of which deal with \ninterrogating minors, and argue that in light of these authorities it was clearly \nestablished that Coach Marchand could not consent in loco parentis.[8] This argument \nfails for two reasons. First, the Coventry policy and § 16-21.5-3 only apply to \nquestioning and not to searches; and, second, these authorities do nothing to clarify \nthe state of federal constitutional law. \n\"Officials sued for constitutional violations do not lose their qualified immunity merely \nbecause their conduct violates some statutory or administrative provision.\" Davis v. \nScherer, 468 U.S. 183, 194, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984) (emphasis \n\nadded). Put another way, \"a state official's violation of a state statute or regulation, not \nitself the basis of the federal suit, should not deprive the official of qualified immunity \nfrom damages for violation of other statutory or constitutional provisions.\" Goyco de \nMaldonado v. Rivera, 849 F.2d 683, 687 (1st Cir.1988) (citing Davis, 468 U.S. at 193-\n96, 104 S.Ct. 3012). Simply put, neither police department policy nor Rhode Island \nstatutes can determine whether federal law was clearly established. \nPlaintiffs also argue that even if the law on Coach Marchand's authority to consent \nwas not clearly established, the officers still acted unreasonably because the consent \nwas the product of coercion and therefore invalid. The voluntariness question—that is, \nwhether consent to a search was the product of duress or coercion (express or \nimplied)—is determined from the totality of the circumstances. United States v. \nDunbar, 553 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir.2009); United States v. Luciano, 329 F.3d 1, 7 (1st \nCir.2003). Each case must be viewed on its own facts and in its own context. United \nStates v. Berkowitz, 429 F.2d 921, 925 (1st Cir.1970). \"There is no talismanic \ndefinition of `voluntariness' readily applicable to the myriad situations in which the \npolice find it efficient to ask permission to conduct a consensual search.\" United \nStates v. Hall, 969 F.2d 1102, 1106 (D.C.Cir.1992). Relevant factors include \"the \nconsenting party's age, education, experience, intelligence, and knowledge of the right \nto withhold consent\" and whether the consenting party was advised of his rights and \nwhether consent was obtained under \"inherently coercive circumstances.\" Dunbar, \n553 F.3d at 57 (quoting United States v. Forbes, 181 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1999)). \nIn this case, concerns that Coach Marchand's consent was coerced are put to rest by \nhis deposition testimony. Coach Marchand testified that in response to the officers' \nrequest for consent he thought about the safety of his team, and the fact he knew his \nteam was innocent; and, he said, that he decided to take the \"high road.\" (Def.s' Mot. \nfor Summ. J. Ex. A 28 (Doc. 25).)[9] From this it is obvious Coach Marchand \nunderstood the situation and 217*217 rendered consent after careful and deliberate \nthought.[10] Coach Marchand's consent was voluntary and the officers' qualified \nimmunity cannot be defeated on this basis. Accordingly, summary judgment will enter \nin favor of the Defendants on Counts I and III. \nB. Invasion of Privacy Claim \nLittle need be said about Plaintiffs' claim for invasion of privacy under R.I. Gen. Laws \n§ 9-1-28.1 because the qualified immunity defense is \"well grounded in the law of \nRhode Island.\" Hatch v. Town of Middletown, 311 F.3d 83, 90 (1st Cir.2002) \n(discussing \"recognition of a qualified immunity defense under state law analogous to \nthe federal doctrine\"); J.R. v. Gloria, 599 F.Supp.2d 182, 205 (D.R.I.2009). Plaintiffs' \ncause of action for invasion of privacy arises from the conduct for which the officers \nare immune from suit. Summary judgment is therefore appropriate on Count IV as \nwell. \nC. Equal Protection \n\"To succeed on a § 1983 equal protection claim, the plaintiffs must prove that the \ndefendants acted in a discriminatory manner and that the discrimination was \nintentional.\" Reese v. Jefferson Sch. Dist. No. 14J, 208 F.3d 736, 740 (9th Cir. 2000); \nsee Hayden v. Grayson, 134 F.3d 449, 453 (1st Cir.1998). \"That is, the plaintiff must \nestablish that the defendant intentionally treated the plaintiff differently from others \nwho were similarly situated.\" In re Subpoena to Witzel, 531 F.3d 113, 118-19 (1st \nCir.2008). \"A discriminatory intent or purpose means that the defendants `selected or \n\nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of, not merely in spite \nof, its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.'\" Id. at 119 (quoting Wayte v. United \nStates, 470 U.S. 598, 610, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985)). \nHere, Plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable jury \nto find that the officers' conduct was racially motivated. Plaintiffs argue that the \noverwhelming circumstantial evidence proves that they were singled out based upon \nrace. They point to evidence that Central Falls is an ethically diverse community; the \nteam was comprised of a number of Hispanics; the officers acknowledged members of \nthe crowd could have just as likely perpetrated the theft but no one else was searched; \nand that the officers took no effective action to silence the mob from spewing racist \ninsults. \nIt is the rare case in which a plaintiff can point to specific racist statements made by \ngovernment officials, and circumstantial evidence may certainly demonstrate an intent \nto discriminate. Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 77 (1st Cir. 1998) (overruled on \nother grounds). But the facts Plaintiffs have marshaled to support an inference of \ndiscriminatory animus are woefully inadequate. Circumstantial evidence consists of \nproof of a series of 218*218 facts or circumstances from which the existence or \nnonexistence of another fact may be reasonably inferred. Absolutely nothing can be \ninferred from Plaintiffs' evidence and to conclude otherwise is to engage in rank \nspeculation. See Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 426 (1st Cir. 2006) (stating that \nat the summary judgment stage a conglomeration of conclusory allegations, \nimprobable inferences, and unsupported speculation is insufficient to discharge the \nnonmovant's burden). \nWhile the evidence may reflect the officers' poor judgment in giving into an unruly mob \nand humiliating the boys, it does not even approach discrimination. It is undisputed \nthat Coach Marchand informed the officers that his team was under suspicion for the \nalleged theft—or in Coach Marchand's words \"the prime suspects.\" Furthermore, the \nofficers only conducted their search after Coach Marchand consented. The officers' \nconduct in this case resulted from the information and consent that Coach Marchand \nprovided and not from any racial or ethnic bias. Summary judgment on Count II will \ntherefore enter in Defendants' favor. \nD.R.I. Racial Profiling Prevention Act and \nEthnic Intimidation Statute \nFor the reasons stated above with respect to Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim, \nsummary judgment must also enter on Counts V and VI, brought under Rhode Island's \nRacial Profiling Prevention Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-21.2-3, and Ethnic Intimidation \nStatute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-35. Both statutes require discriminatory animus. The \nRacial Profiling Prevention Act requires that an individual be subject to disparate \ntreatment by a law enforcement officer or agency, in whole or in part, on the basis of \nrace or ethnicity. R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-21.2-3. Similarly, the Ethnic Intimidation Statute \nallows for a cause of action when a person has been \"maliciously subjected to an act \nor acts which would reasonably be construed as intended to harass or intimidate the \nperson because of his or her race, religion, or national origin.\" Id. at § 9-1-35. Plaintiffs \nhave presented no evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could conclude the \nDefendants' actions were motivated by the Plaintiffs' race or ethnicity. Again, it is \ncritical to distinguish between the racist behavior and words of the mob and those of \nthe officers. There is no evidence to support saddling the officers with the idiocies of \nthe adults and students in the mob. Therefore, Defendants' Motion for Summary \n\nJudgment on Counts V and VI must be granted. \nE. Supervisory Liability \nPlaintiffs are also seeking to hold Chief DaSilva and Chief O'Rourke liable in their \ncapacities as supervisory officials. Supervisory liability cannot be predicated on a \nrespondeat superior theory, and instead must stem from the supervisor's own acts or \nomissions. Seekamp v. Michaud, 109 F.3d 802, 808 (1st Cir.1997). A supervisor can \nbe held liable if (1) the behavior of his subordinates results in a constitutional violation, \nand (2) the supervisor's action or inaction was affirmatively linked to that behavior in \nthat it could be characterized as supervisory encouragement, condonation or \nacquiescence or gross negligence amounting to deliberate indifference. Id. (quoting \nLipsett v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir.1988) (internal quotations \nomitted)). \nHyperbole and speculation are behind Plaintiffs' claims for supervisory liability. \nPlaintiffs have not alleged either police chief was at the scene or had prior knowledge \n(actual or constructive) of the situation such that it could be argued they were \ndeliberately indifferent in failing to prevent 219*219 the search. Rather, Plaintiffs rest \ntheir claims for supervisory liability on a theory of inadequate training. Despite \nsubmitting evidence that the Coventry Police Department sent at least one of its \nofficers to a basic and advanced school resource officer training program hosted by \nthe National Association of School Resource Officers, Plaintiffs argue that the chiefs' \nfailure to train its officers amounted to deliberate indifference given the inevitable \nlikelihood officers in the Town would confront situations involving searches of public \nschool students. This argument asks too much. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence \nof \"a known history of widespread abuse sufficient to alert a supervisor to ongoing \nviolations.\" Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 582 (1st Cir.1994). \nPlaintiffs did submit evidence that Coventry officers have in the past responded to the \nhigh school and conducted searches, but a smattering of such incidents does not \nplace this case within the \"narrow range of circumstances,\" where the constitutional \nviolation alleged occurs as \"a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip law \nenforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.\" Young v. City of \nProvidence, 404 F.3d 4, 28 (1st Cir.2005). Even if the Court assumes the officers' \nactions amounted to a constitutional violation, the evidence submitted is inadequate to \nconclude Chief DaSilva or Chief O'Rourke was deliberately indifferent or wilfully blind. \nSee Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 582 (\"[I]solated instances of unconstitutional activity \nordinarily are insufficient to establish a supervisor's policy or custom, or otherwise to \nshow deliberate indifference.\"). Simply put, without a shred of evidence that the action \nor inaction of either chief \"led inexorably to the constitutional violation,\" Plaintiffs' \nsupervisory liability claims fail as a matter of law. Maldonado, 568 F.3d at 275 (quoting \nPineda v. Toomey, 533 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. 2008)). \nF. Municipal Liability \nHaving disposed of all claims brought against the Defendants in their individual \ncapacities, the Court addresses whether a basis exists to hold the Town of Coventry \nliable. The cloak of qualified immunity that protects the officers does not shield the \nTown from liability. See Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155, 177 (1st \nCir.2008) (\"[I]t is not impossible for a municipality to be held liable for the actions of \nlower-level officers who are themselves entitled to qualified immunity.\"). To prevail, \nhowever, Plaintiffs need evidence that the officers' actions constitute a constitutional \nviolation and were caused by a \"policy or custom\" of the Town. Id. (citing Martínez-\n\nVélez v. Rey-Hernández, 506 F.3d 32, 41 (1st Cir.2007)); see also Monell, 436 U.S. at \n694, 98 S.Ct. 2018. In other words, the policy or custom must be the \"moving force \nbehind the deprivation of constitutional rights.\" Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayaguez, 467 \nF.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir.2006). To be actionable a custom or practice must be \"so well-\nsettled and widespread that the policymaking officials of the municipality can be said \nto have either actual or constructive knowledge of it yet did nothing to end the \npractice.\" Id. at 23-24 (quoting Silva v. Worden, 130 F.3d 26, 31 (1st Cir.1997) \n(internal quotations omitted)). Where a claim of inadequate training is alleged to have \ncaused the constitutional injury, the municipality's failure to train must be the product \nof deliberate indifference such that the Town disregarded a known or obvious risk of \nserious harm from its failure to develop an adequate training program. Estate of \nBennett, 548 F.3d at 177; Young, 404 F.3d at 28. \n220*220 Plaintiffs' claim for municipal liability is based on a failure to train and fails for \nthe same reasons their claims for supervisory liability fail. Even if a constitutional \nviolation occurred, Plaintiffs offer no evidence of a policy, custom, practice or of any \ndeliberate indifference on the part of the Town. Moreover, nothing Plaintiffs point to \nbears the requisite causal relationship to the alleged constitutional deprivation to \nestablish liability. Accordingly, summary judgment will enter for the Town on Plaintiffs' \nclaims of municipality liability. \nIV. Conclusion \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby \nGRANTED, and judgment shall enter for the Defendants. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n[1] The facts described are taken from the record evidence including depositions of the relevant players in the \ncontroversy. While reviewed from the standpoint most favorable to the Plaintiffs, as required at the summary \njudgment stage, the basic facts are essentially undisputed. \n[2] For example, one player heard a woman in the crowd call the boys \"spics.\" Coach Marchand testified that \npeople in the crowd used phrases like: \"those people,\" \"they're good at hiding things,\" \"they're sneaky, you know it,\" \nand made reference to the boys being from \"the ghetto.\" \n[3] At oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that the Due Process claim (Count I) overlaps their claim under \nthe Fourth Amendment (Count III) and was not intended to allege a violation of Plaintiffs' substantive due process \nrights. \n[4] Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims against the police officers are asserted in both the officers' individual and official \ncapacities. Because claims brought against a municipal employee in his or her official capacity are essentially \nclaims against the municipality itself, they are duplicative of Plaintiffs' direct action against the Town. See Hafer v. \nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 25-27, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991). Thus the Court need not consider each official \ncapacity claim separately. \n[5] During oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel clarified that the Complaint indeed contained claims for failure to train \nand supervise. However, in the Court's view that is debatable. Notwithstanding the inartfully drawn Complaint, the \nPlaintiffs received the benefit of the doubt, but because the Defendants' motion only addressed the causes of \naction specifically delineated in the Complaint, the Court allowed them to supplement their motion and address the \nmerits of the two additional claims. \n[6] Justice Thomas's partial dissent urged the Court to adopt an in loco parentis standard to govern all school \nsearch cases, a point the majority declined to address. See Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, ___ U.S. \n___, 129 S.Ct. 2633, 2646, 2655, 174 L.Ed.2d 354 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) \n(advocating for a \"return to the common-law doctrine of in loco parentis\" and a \"complete restoration\" of the \ndoctrine) (emphasis added). \n[7] So there is no confusion, the Court is not suggesting that these authorities stand for the proposition that Coach \n\nMarchand had the authority to consent by virtue of any in loco parentis status he may have had. All the Court is \nsaying is that the case law on the limits of a school official's in loco parentis authority in the specific factual context \nof this case is not sufficiently clear so that a reasonable police officer would be on notice that searching players \nbased on the consent of their coach is unconstitutional. \n[8] In pertinent part, the statute requires that:  \nBefore making a high school pupil under eighteen (18) years of age available to a law enforcement officer for the \npurpose of questioning, the principal of the school, or his or her designee, shall inform the pupil that the pupil has \nthe right to request that his or her parent or guardian or an adult family member, or person on the list of emergency \ncontacts for the pupil be present during the questioning. \nR.I. Gen. Laws § 16-21.5-3(a). \n[9] Coach Marchand further testified:  \nI'm a First Amendment [sic] guy, you're getting to know [sic], you know, and I dread to say, screw you get a search \nwarrant and I debated that. Okay. Then I said no, that's not my role, at that point my role as coach, I'm suppose \n(sic) to be the father, I'm suppose (sic) to take them home safe. \n(Defs' Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. A 29 (Doc. 25).) \n[10] At one point in his deposition, Coach Marchand said he consented because he was under duress. However, \nconsidering his use of the term \"duress\" in context, it is evident that Coach Marchand was attempting to poetically \nexplain the stressfulness of the situation and the difficulty of his decision—albeit perhaps inartfully for Fourth \nAmendment purposes. (Def.s' Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. A 30-31 (Doc. 25).) It does not automatically follow that his \nconsent was involuntary simply because he stated that he was under duress. The Court also rejects Plaintiffs' \nargument that the circumstances under which Coach Marchand gave consent were inherently coercive. See United \nStates v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir.2008) (affirming a finding of voluntary consent when given by a defendant \nsurrounded by officers and holding that custody alone was not enough to show coercion). \n ",

      "text": "JUAN LOPERA, ET AL., Plaintiffs, Appellants, \n   \nv. \nTOWN OF COVENTRY, ET AL., Defendants, Appellees. \nNo. 09-2386. \nUnited States Court of Appeals, First Circuit. \nApril 1, 2011. \nStephen M. Robinson, with whom Vicki J. Bejma and Robinson & Calpham were on \nbrief, for appellants. \nThomas R. Bender, and Hanson Curran LLP, were on brief for Rhode Island Affiliate, \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, amicus curiae. \nMarc DeSisto for appellees. \nBefore Lynch, Chief Judge, Selya and Thompson, Circuit Judges. \nLYNCH, Chief Judge. \nFormer members of the Central Falls High School boys soccer team appeal from an \nentry of summary judgment for the Town of Coventry, Rhode Island, and Coventry \npolice officers in this civil rights case. This dispute arises out of a police search of \nteam members that followed a heated soccer match between Central Falls High \nSchool and Coventry High School in Coventry in 2006. Police searched all individual \nCentral Falls team members for items purportedly missing from the Coventry locker \nroom in the presence of an abusive crowd of Coventry students and adults. Though \nthe Central Falls coach told the police he consented to the search of his players, both \nhe and the players assert that he was coerced into doing so by the police. \nLead plaintiff Juan Lopera and other former members of the Central Falls team \nbrought suit for damages and injunctive relief in April 2008, alleging violations of their \nconstitutional rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as \nviolations of Rhode Island state law. The defendant police officers asserted a defense \nof qualified immunity. The district court held that the players failed to raise a genuine \nissue of material fact as to whether (1) the police officers were not entitled to qualified \nimmunity with respect to their claims under the Fourth Amendment and state privacy \nlaw, or (2) the police had engaged in racial discrimination in violation of the Equal \nProtection Clause or Rhode Island statutes prohibiting racial profiling and intimidation. \nLopera v. Town of Coventry, 652 F. Supp. 2d 203, 213-17 (D.R.I. 2009). We affirm. \nI. \nWe review the facts in the light most favorable to Lopera and the other plaintiffs, the \nparties opposing summary judgment. On September 28, 2006, the Central Falls High \nSchool soccer team traveled to Coventry for a match against Coventry High School. \nBefore the game, four or five Central Falls players used the restrooms in the Coventry \nlocker room. They were not alone. A security guard accompanied the boys into the \nlocker room. The locker room is usually open and unlocked and could be easily \n\naccessed, including by unauthorized persons. \nThe locker room is apparently used by all Coventry teams and recently had been used \nby Coventry's football team. After the soccer match, a group of approximately twenty \nfootball players[1] confronted the Central Falls coach, Robert Marchand, as he walked \nbehind his players toward the team bus. In profane terms, the Coventry students \naccused the Central Falls players of stealing iPods and cell phones from the Coventry \nlocker room. \nThe Central Falls players allege that they encountered hostile racism during their \nmatch with the Coventry soccer team and during the remainder of their time in \nCoventry. Central Falls is a racially diverse community, and the Central Falls team \nconsisted entirely of Spanish-speaking Hispanic players, save for one Portuguese \nplayer. Coventry, by contrast, is predominantly non-Hispanic and white, and its high \nschool reflected this. The Central Falls players allege that Coventry players uttered \nracial epithets during the game, calling them \"spics\" and demanding that they speak \nEnglish. They allege that Coventry students and adults made similar remarks during \nthe series of events that followed the game. \nAfter the Coventry football players confronted Coach Marchand with the purported \nthefts, he told them that he would handle the situation. The football players followed \nhim toward the Central Falls bus. Before the group reached the bus, Coach Marchand \ntold the players to wait. Coach Marchand then boarded the bus, where his team was \nwaiting. Coach Marchand informed the players of the accusations and told them that \nhe knew they had not taken the items. Nonetheless, he and an assistant coach \nsearched the players' bags. If an iPod or cell phone was found, Coach Marchand \nasked for proof that it belonged to the player. The search lasted approximately twenty \nto twenty-five minutes. Coach Marchand testified that when it was completed, he was \n\"completely satisfied\" that his players did not possess the items. \nAfter he completed the search, Coach Marchand left the bus to speak with the \nCoventry Athletic Director, who was waiting outside. By this time, Coach Marchand \ntestified, a crowd of fifty or sixty Coventry students and adults had gathered around \nthe bus. According to Coach Marchand, members of the crowd yelled that they knew \nhis players had the items. He testified that students and adults in the crowd stated that \nthe players were \"from the ghetto,\" knew how to \"hide things\" and \"lie good,\" and \ncould not be trusted. The players recounted similar accusations and vitriol, including \nracial slurs like \"spic.\" At one point, a member of the crowd apparently tried to board \nthe bus to conduct his own search. Coach Marchand testified that members of the \ncrowd demanded a search of his own bags. He also testified that members of the \ncrowd stated that they would not let the Central Falls players leave until the items had \nbeen found. \nCoach Marchand told the Coventry Athletic Director that he had checked \"everything\" \non the bus, and that his players did not have the purportedly missing items. Coach \nMarchand also told the Athletic Director that he was welcome to do his own search, \nwhich the Athletic Director declined as unnecessary. Coach Marchand testified that as \nhe and the Athletic Director puzzled over how to \"satisfy all [the] constituencies here,\" \nhe began to worry that violence might ensue. \nAt this point, three or four Coventry police cruisers arrived on the scene with their \nlights and sirens activated. The police had received calls reporting a supposed \nongoing physical altercation. The officers boxed in the Central Falls bus with their \ncruisers so that it could not move. According to the players, by this time the crowd had \n\nalso formed a semi-circle around the bus, blocking its path out of the parking lot. \nOnce it became clear that no physical altercation was taking place, the police \ndiscussed the situation with Coach Marchand and the Coventry Athletic Director. \nCoach Marchand explained to the officers that the Coventry students had alleged \nthefts and that his players \"were prime suspects.\" He told the officers that he had \nsearched each student's bags on the bus and did not find the purportedly missing \nitems. Coach Marchand expressed fear of the crowd, asking the police, \"what am I \ngoing to do, what are they going to do to us[?]\" After a pause, Coach Marchand \ntestified, the police responded by asking him if they could search the players. Coach \nMarchand verbally agreed. \nCoach Marchand did not testify that the officers said or did anything coercive. Coach \nMarchand testified that the officers acted courteously and told unruly members of the \ncrowd to be quiet. According to Coach Marchand, the police \"decided their best thing \nwas to [do the] search themselves to appease the masses\" who were \"crying for our \nheads.\" In his testimony, he described his consent as the way to \"take the high road, \ntake the safe road,\" even though he knew his players did not have the items. We must \ntake this testimony as true on this motion for summary judgment.[2] The police testified \nthat the crowd was angry and unruly, consistent with the players' testimony. They also \ntestified that they did not hear any racial epithets from members of the crowd, which is \nnot the plaintiffs' testimony. \nAfter agreeing to the search, Coach Marchand returned to the bus and told his players \nthat the crowd would not let them go until the police searched them. The police then \ntold the players to get off the bus with all of their belongings and line up with their bags \nbetween their legs. The players complied, lining up with their backs against the bus. \nAn officer then told the players that if any of them had the missing items, they would \nbe arrested if they did not immediately step forward. When none of the players \nstepped forward, the officers began a search. Coach Marchand testified that the \nofficers placed each player's bag on the hood of a cruiser and looked through it. A few \nplayers testified that some players were also subjected to pat down searches. During \nthe search, the crowd was about six to ten feet away from the players. \nThe search lasted for about 45 minutes to an hour. The police officers testified that \nthey did not obtain descriptions of the type of iPods or cell phones alleged to be \nmissing, other than that one phone may have been a \"flip phone.\" When the police \nlocated an iPod or a cell phone on a player, they required that the player prove that \nthe item belonged to him. In some cases, the players identified items stored on the \ndevices and allowed the officers to search the devices. In other cases, the officers \ndisplayed the devices to members of the crowd and asked if they were the missing \ndevices. During the course of the search, members of the crowd alleged that \nadditional items were missing, like books and money. \nThe players testified that the crowd continued to harass them during the search. One \nplayer testified that, during the search, members of the crowd called the players \n\"spics.\" Another testified that members of the crowd stated that the Central Falls team \nshould not be in Coventry or playing Coventry High School given the race of its \nplayers. Members of the crowd photographed the Central Falls students during the \nsearch with their cell phone cameras. Marchand testified that although the officers \nreprimanded unruly members of the crowd during the search, they did not take \nadequate actions to disperse the crowd or move it away from the bus. \nThere was testimony that during the search, one Coventry officer told one of the \nplayers that he thought the search was \"stupid\" because the coach had already \n\nsearched the players and because a security guard had accompanied the players in \nthe locker room. Another officer, hearing the comment, laughed. The police required \nall the players to wait outside the bus until every player had been searched. The \nsearch did not produce any of the missing items. After it was completed, the police \nescorted the bus out of town in their cruisers. \nLopera and other members of the Central Falls team filed suit in April 2008 against the \nTown of Coventry and several individual Coventry police officers under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 (§ 1983) and Rhode Island state law. Under § 1983, the players alleged \ndeprivations of their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches \nand seizures, as well as their Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law and \nequal protection of the law.[3] Under Rhode Island state law, the players alleged \nviolation of statutes that forbid invasion of privacy, racial profiling, and ethnic \nintimidation. R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1; id. § 31-21.2; id. § 9-1-35. \nThe district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all counts. First, it \nheld that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the Fourth \nAmendment and state privacy claims because (1) it was not unreasonable for the \nofficers to believe that Coach Marchand had power to consent to the search, and (2) \ncoercion did not vitiate Coach Marchand's consent. Second, it held that the players did \nnot introduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that the police engaged in racial \ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause or Rhode Island's statutes \nprohibiting racial profiling and ethnic intimidation. The district court also held on \nindependent grounds that the players had not introduced material facts to support their \nclaims of supervisory and municipal liability. \nII. \nOn appeal, the players make two arguments. First, they argue that the officers were \nnot entitled to qualified immunity for the claims under the Fourth Amendment and state \nprivacy law because (1) a reasonable officer would have believed that Coach \nMarchand did not have authority to consent for his players, and (2) a reasonable \nofficer would have believed that Coach Marchand's consent was coerced. Second, \nthey argue that they set forth material facts to support the reasonable inference that \nthe actions of the officers were impermissibly motivated by race in violation of the \nEqual Protection Clause and Rhode Island state law. The players do not challenge the \ndistrict court's rulings on municipal and supervisory liability. \nIn their answer to the players' complaint, the defendant officers asserted qualified \nimmunity against all claims. In asserting this defense before the district court and \nbefore this court, the officers focused their argument on whether it was clearly \nestablished that Coach Marchand could consent on behalf of his students in loco \nparentis. The district court analyzed this question in a qualified immunity framework, \nbut it appeared to address the players' remaining claims outside of that framework. \nGiven that the officers have raised a qualified immunity defense to all of the players' \nclaims, we address each of the players' claims in the qualified immunity framework. \nThis court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo. Saccucci Auto Group, Inc. v. \nAm. Honda Motor Co., 617 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2010). We must make all reasonable \ninferences in favor of the non-moving party and may reverse only if \"the evidence on \nrecord `is sufficiently open-ended to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the issue in \nfavor of either side.'\" Maymi v. Puerto Rico Ports Auth., 515 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 2008) \n(quoting Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. \n1995)). This standard of review applies to grants of summary judgment on grounds of \n\nqualified immunity. See Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002). When a \ndefendant moves for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, the \nplaintiff bears the burden of showing infringement of a federal right. Quintero de \nQuintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1992). \nA. The Doctrine of Qualified Immunity \nQualified immunity \"protects government officials `from liability for civil damages \ninsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional \nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. \nCt. 808, 815 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). This \ncircuit follows a two-step analysis under Pearson in discerning whether defendants are \nentitled to qualified immunity. We ask \"(1) whether the facts alleged or shown by the \nplaintiff make out a violation of a constitutional right; and (2) if so, whether the right \nwas `clearly established' at the time of the defendant's alleged violation.\" Maldonado \nv. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 2009). \nThe Supreme Court has held that it is not mandatory for courts to follow this two-step \ntest sequentially. Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818-21; see also Maldonado, 568 F.3d at \n269-270. A finding that a right was not clearly established at the time of the alleged \nviolation is sufficient to warrant a finding of qualified immunity. See Pearson, 129 S. \nCt. at 822. In some cases \"discussion of the first prong of the qualified immunity \nanalysis will result `in a substantial expenditure of scarce judicial resources on difficult \nquestions that have no effect on the outcome of the case.'\" Maldonado, 568 F.3d at \n270 (quoting Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 818). \nIn this case, these considerations counsel that we consider the second prong of the \nanalysis and go no further. That prong, we have held, has two aspects: that both (1) \nthe legal contours of the right in question and (2) the particular factual violation in \nquestion would have been clear to a reasonable official. Id. at 269. Together, these \ntwo factors ask whether a reasonable officer, similarly situated, would have believed \nthat his conduct did not violate the Constitution. Harlow, 457 U.S. at 818-19; Philip v. \nCronin, 537 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 2008). \nThe qualified immunity defense \"is designed to protect `all but the plainly incompetent \nor those who knowingly violate the law.'\" Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 429 (2007) \n(quoting Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986)). A finding of qualified immunity is \nwarranted if \"a reasonable officer could have believed his conduct was lawful.\" \nOlmeda v. Ortíz-QuiZonez, 434 F.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 2006). Such a finding is not \nwarranted if \"no reasonable officer could believe\" that his conduct was lawful. Groh v. \nRamirez, 540 U.S. 551, 564 (2004). Put another way, immunity will issue when \n\"officers of reasonable competence could disagree\" on the lawfulness of an action, but \nit will not issue if \"it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have \nconcluded\" that the action was lawful. Malley, 475 U.S. at 342. \nThis is an objective test; it does not look to the defendants' subjective beliefs \nconcerning the unlawfulness of their conduct. Philip, 537 F.3d at 34. A \"determination \nof objective reasonableness,\" however, \"`will often require examination of the \ninformation possessed' by the defendant officials.\" Kelley, 288 F.3d at 7 (quoting \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987)). \nThis objective test does not establish that \"an official action is protected by qualified \nimmunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.\" \nAnderson, 483 U.S. at 640. The Supreme Court has made clear that \"officials can still \n\nbe on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual \ncircumstances.\" Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002) (citing United States v. \nLanier, 520 U.S. 259 (1997)). Nonetheless, unlawfulness must be apparent in light of \npre-existing law at the time of the alleged violation. Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640. The \ncontent of clearly settled law and the belief of a reasonable officer under the \ncircumstances are questions appropriately addressed by courts before trial, where \npossible. See Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227-28 (1991); Cox v. Hainey, 391 F.3d \n25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004). \nWe divide our discussion in this case between the players' claims under the Fourth \nAmendment and state privacy law and their claims under the Equal Protection Clause \nand state laws forbidding racial profiling and ethnic harassment. \nB. Fourth Amendment and State Privacy \nClaims \nIn their claims under the Fourth Amendment and the state privacy statute, the players \ngive two grounds to defeat qualified immunity. First, they argue that all officers of \nreasonable competence would have believed that Coach Marchand did not have \nauthority to consent on behalf of the players. Second, they argue that all officers of \nreasonable competence would have believed that coercion vitiated Coach Marchand's \npurported consent to the search in this case. \nThe district court focused primarily on the players' first argument. It held that the \nplayers failed to introduce a material fact showing it was clearly established that \nCoach Marchand could not consent on their behalf under the circumstances. Lopera \n652 F. Supp. 2d at 213-16. In so finding, the district court relied on the apparent \nuncertainty of prevailing Supreme Court doctrine governing in loco parentis searches \nin schools. Id. As to the players' second argument, the district court held that Coach \nMarchand's consent was voluntary because he \"understood the situation,\" id. at 216, \nand gave consent \"after careful and deliberate thought,\" id. at 217. The district court \ndid not address whether this would have been clear to the officers under the \ncircumstances, nor whether it was clearly established that coercion vitiates consent. \n1. Coach Marchand's Authority to Consent \nWe may quickly dispose of the players' first argument, which does not require analysis \nof the intricacies of the in loco parentis doctrine. Under the facts alleged by the \nplayers, a reasonable officer could have concluded that Coach Marchand had \nauthority to consent to a search of his students. The search did not take place at \nCentral Falls High School, but rather on a trip away from school over which Coach \nMarchand was undisputedly in charge. When the officers arrived, Coach Marchand \ntold them that he had already conducted his own search of his students. To arrive at \nthe conclusion that Coach Marchand could not consent, an officer would have had to \nquestion Coach Marchand's authority to perform the first search and, by extension, \nCoach Marchand's authority to consent to a second search by the police. \nWe cannot say that no officer of reasonable competence could have reached the \nconclusion that Coach Marchand had authority to consent. As the players argue, the \nSupreme Court has recognized limits on the in loco parentis authority of school \nofficials. New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 336-37 (1985). To defeat a finding of \nqualified immunity, however, the players must identify authority sufficiently \n\nparticularized that the unlawfulness of an act would have been apparent to all officers \nof reasonable competence. Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 615 (1999). Subsequent \ndecisions make clear that T.L.O. has not eliminated a school official's in loco parentis \npower to consent on behalf of his students. See Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 \nU.S. 646, 654-56 (1995). The players do not identify a sufficiently particularized \ndecision of this court or the Supreme Court that places Coach Marchand's consent \nclearly beyond his authority under the facts they allege. \n2. The Validity of Coach Marchand's \nConsent \nThe players' second argument concerning the validity of Marchand's consent requires \nmore discussion. There is no dispute that all officers of reasonable competence would \nhave known that coercion vitiates consent to a search under the Fourth Amendment. \nSee United States v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st Cir. 2008). Under the Fourth \nAmendment, consent may \"not be coerced, by explicit or implicit means, by implied \nthreat or covert force.\" Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 228 (1973). As to \nthe other considerations relevant to the validity of Coach Marchand's consent, we \nreiterate that we may only deny qualified immunity if \"it is obvious that no reasonably \ncompetent officer would have concluded\" that the action was lawful. Malley, 475 U.S. \nat 342. If \"officers of reasonable competence could disagree\" on the lawfulness of an \naction, we must grant qualified immunity. Id. \nWe first dispose of a legal question about the scope of the facts to be considered. The \nofficers argue that the law under Schneckloth was not clearly established; they \ncontend that it was the crowd, not the officers, who created any coercive atmosphere \nand that the coercion must \"emanat[e] from the police officers themselves rather than \nany subjective or outside influence.\" Citing the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado \nv. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986), the officers argue that the examination of coercion \nmust focus solely on the acts of the officials requesting to perform the search. We \nreject this argument for two different reasons, but nonetheless find for other reasons \nthat defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. \nFirst, Connelly is not clearly established law limiting Schneckloth. Second, taking the \nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the crowd was not the only source of \npotential coercion. It is clearly established law under Schneckloth that in considering \nthe validity of consent, all the surrounding circumstances must be considered. \nSchneckloth, 412 U.S. at 227; Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264. Neither the Supreme Court \nnor this court has extended the rule in Connelly, a decision under the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to Fourth Amendment consent cases. \nIn Connelly, the defendant claimed that because he heard a \"voice of God\" telling him \nto confess, his confession in police custody was coerced and thus invalid. Connelly, \n479 U.S. at 170-171. The Supreme Court held a defendant's mental condition \"by \nitself and apart from its relation to official coercion\" cannot \"dispose of the inquiry into \nconstitutional `voluntariness'\" under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process \nClause. Id. at 164. It concluded that \"coercive police activity is a necessary predicate \nto the finding that a confession is not `voluntary'\" within the meaning of that clause. Id. \nat 167. The Court did not address Fourth Amendment searches. \nWe are unaware of any published circuit court decision that applies this standard for \nvoluntariness of a confession to questions of consent under the Fourth Amendment. \nBut see United States v. Quezada, No. 91-5004, 1991 WL 191402 (4th Cir. Oct. 24, \n\n1991) (applying Connelly to a Fourth Amendment search in an unpublished decision). \nAt least two circuits have expressly declined to do so. United States v. Montgomery, \n621 F.3d 568, 571-72 (6th Cir. 2010); Tukes v. Dugger, 911 F.2d 508, 516 & n.13 \n(11th Cir. 1990). This circuit has continued to apply the requirements in Schneckloth \nfor consent to a Fourth Amendment search. See Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264. Moreover, \nwe are unaware of any lower court decision in this circuit that extends Connelly to \nFourth Amendment searches. See Pearson, 129 S. Ct. at 823. \nHaving rejected the defendants' efforts to narrow the focus of inquiry, we turn to the \narticulation of the clearly established law. In Schneckloth, the Supreme Court held that \ncoercion must be discerned by examining \"all the surrounding circumstances,\" \nincluding \"subtly coercive police questions\" and \"the possibly vulnerable subjective \nstate of the person who consents.\" Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229. In Ohio v. Robinette, \n519 U.S. 33 (1996), the Court repeated that \"[t]he Fourth Amendment test for a valid \nconsent to search is that the consent be voluntary, and `[v]oluntariness is a question \nof fact to be determined from all the circumstances.'\" Id. at 40 (alteration in original) \n(quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248-49). \nWe have held that voluntariness of consent depends on considerations including, but \nnot limited to, \"(i) the consenter's age, education, past experiences, and intelligence; \n(ii) whether law enforcement officials advised the consenter of his constitutional right \nto refuse consent; (iii) the length and conditions of the consenter's detention and/or \nquestioning; and (iv) law enforcement officials' use of any inherently coercive tactics.\" \nVanvliet, 542 F.3d at 264 n.2 (citing Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 226). \nA consent is coerced when an individual's \"will ha[s] been overborne and his capacity \nfor self-determination critically impaired\" such that he does not face an \"essentially \nfree and unconstrained choice.\" United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 424 (1976) \n(quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 225) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is seldom \nthe case that \"a single coercive element will, standing alone, be enough to invalidate a \nconsent.\" W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 8.2(b), at 62 (4th ed. 2004). An officer's \nfailure to inform an individual of her right to refuse consent to a search does not \nnecessarily render her consent to such a search coerced. See Robinette, 519 U.S. at \n39-40. Nor is a consent to a search given in police custody necessarily coerced. \nWatson, 423 U.S. at 424. \nTwo Supreme Court cases are particularly instructive here, but are not cited to us by \neither side. The first is United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194 (2002). In Drayton, the \nSupreme Court held that among the relevant factors for assessing coercion is whether \nthe officer requesting the search \"indicated a command to consent to the search.\" Id. \nat 206. The defendant's consent, the Court held, was not a product of coercion \nbecause the officer had provided him with \"no indication that he was required to \nconsent to the search.\" Id. The officers had asked whether the defendant objected to \nthe search, \"thus indicating to a reasonable person that he or she was free to refuse.\" \nId. The Court noted that there had been \"no application of force, no intimidating \nmovement, no overwhelming show of force, no brandishing of weapons, no blocking of \nexits, no threat, no command, not even an authoritative tone of voice.\"[4] Id. at 204. \nThe second is Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429 (1991). In Bostick, the Court addressed \nwhether an officer's request to search a passenger's bags on a commercial bus \nconstituted an unlawful seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 431. Although on \nits face Bostick is about whether the defendant was seized, it is relevant. The \nSupreme Court's assessment of whether the police in Bostick seized the defendant \nturned on whether they had coerced him to consent to a search. Id. at 435-38. It held \nthat the appropriate inquiry was whether, under the circumstances, \"a reasonable \n\nperson would feel free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise terminate the \nencounter.\" Id. at 436. The Court held that \"[w]here the encounter takes place is one \nfactor, but it is not the only one.\" Id. \nAgainst this articulation of the clearly established law, we now turn to the facts of this \ncase, taking all reasonable inferences in favor of the players. The defendants have \nlargely accepted the plaintiffs' version of the facts for purposes of this summary \njudgment motion, but say that they would present their different version of the facts at \ntrial. \nThe players point to three factual circumstances in arguing that no reasonably \ncompetent officer would have concluded that Coach Marchand's consent was valid. \nFirst, they note that Coach Marchand explicitly invoked his fear of the crowd, asking \nthe officers, \"what are they going to do to us[?]\" shortly before the officers requested \nthat Coach Marchand consent to a search of the players. Second, the players note \nthat the officers did not actively seek to disperse the crowd, but only told the crowd to \nquiet down. Third, they note that the officers boxed in the Central Falls bus, which \neffectively ensured that it could not leave until the police decided it could leave. \nAlthough Coach Marchand may have subjectively felt coerced by the police and/or the \ncrowd to give his consent, that is not the focus of the qualified immunity inquiry. \nRather, the focus is on the viewpoint of an objectively reasonable officer. We cannot \nsay that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that Coach \nMarchand's consent was valid under clearly established Supreme Court case law. The \nplayers do not even allege that the officers commanded Coach Marchand to consent \nto a search, and the facts do not suggest that they did. Nor do the players allege that \nthe officers threatened force or acted in an intimidating manner during their exchange \nwith Coach Marchand and the Coventry Athletic Director. Indeed, Coach Marchand \ntestified that the officers requested the search politely and acted courteously and \nprofessionally throughout their exchanges with him. The players do not even allege \nthat the officers spoke to Coach Marchand with \"an authoritative tone of voice\" when \nthey requested to do a search. See Drayton, 536 U.S. at 204. \nRather, the players' evidence depicts a difficult situation in which Coach Marchand \nfaced a genuine choice between imperfect solutions. He could either consent to the \nsearch or require the police to pursue other legal paths if they wished to conduct one. \nAs Coach Marchand said, it was his decision and he decided \"to take the high road, to \ntake the safe road.\" Coach Marchand may have felt that the best way for him to get \nhis players home safely and promptly was to submit to a search. He knew of the \nhostile crowd and was convinced that the players did not possess any of the \npurportedly missing items. By the time the police arrived, the Central Falls bus was \nalready late going home, and Coach Marchand could have reasonably believed that \nschool administrators and the players' parents were or would soon become worried \nabout their whereabouts. \nThese circumstances do not establish that all reasonably competent officers would \nhave concluded that Coach Marchand's will had been overborne or that his capacity \nfor self-determination was critically impaired. See Watson, 423 U.S. at 424. Indeed, \nCoach Marchand testified that he \"debated\" telling the officers to get a search warrant, \nbut rejected that option. Instead, he concluded that his role as coach was to ensure \nfirst and foremost that the players got home safely. A choice between undesirable \noptions does not itself mean the choice was coerced and the consent given was \ninvoluntary. Like the officers in Drayton, the officers posed their search request as a \nquestion and did not make any showing that it could not be refused. We cannot say \nthat a reasonably competent officer could only have concluded that Coach Marchand \n\nhad no option but to consent due to coercion. \nThe factual details the players emphasize, addressed within the totality of the \ncircumstances, do not demand a contrary conclusion. Coach Marchand's question, \n\"what are they going to do to us[?],\" would have alerted reasonable officers of his \nconcerns about the situation. It may also be that reasonable officers would have \nrecognized that the perceived threat from the crowd influenced Coach Marchand's \ndecision. This does not mean, however, that all officers of reasonable competence \nwould have concluded that Coach Marchand's will had been overborne. As Coach \nMarchand testified, he considered refusing the search and telling the officers to get a \nwarrant. \nAs to the officers' efforts to subdue the crowd, by the time the officers spoke with \nCoach Marchand, they had restrained the crowd, told crowd members to cut it out, \nand established a buffer between the crowd and the bus. It may be that the officers \nwould have done better to disperse the crowd altogether. This does not mean, \nhowever, that the officers are not entitled to immunity. The officers could have \nreasonably thought that they made clear that they would prevent the crowd from \nharming the players as of the time they asked Coach Marchand to consent to the \nsearch. \nAs to the police cruisers, the officers parked in a way that boxed in the bus before they \nbecame aware of the specific situation unfolding around it. The record is silent on \nwhether alternatives were available. More importantly, the officers did not convey to \nCoach Marchand that they would not move their cruisers until he agreed to a search. \nNor were they asked to move the cruisers. \nIt is true that in a case concerning an involuntary seizure of a person, the Supreme \nCourt used language that the police offered the person \"no choice.\" Kaupp v. Texas, \n538 U.S. 626, 631 (2003). But the circumstances there were a far cry from the choice \nCoach Marchand faced. In Kaupp an adolescent was rousted out of bed in the middle \nof the night wearing nothing but underwear, placed in handcuffs, and taken to a crime \nscene on his way to be interviewed at law enforcement headquarters. His statement of \n\"Okay\" in response to \"we need to go and talk\" was clearly not consent. See id. at \n631-32. Nothing of that sort happened here, nor would a reasonable officer have \nthought it did. \nOn the plaintiffs' version of the facts, we cannot say that all officers of reasonable \ncompetence would have concluded that Coach Marchand's consent to the search was \ninvalid. It is not enough that Coach Marchand described his consent to the search as \ncoerced; coercion has a specific legal meaning. Even if Coach Marchand felt his \nconsent was coerced within that specific legal meaning, this would not be sufficient to \novercome the officers' assertion of qualified immunity. While a jury might find that \nCoach Marchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced, that is not the issue \nhere; we must look to the view of the reasonable officer. See Barton v. Clancy, 632 \nF.3d 9, 30 (1st Cir. 2011). Like Coach Marchand, the police officers faced a tough \ndecision in a difficult situation. Whether the officers made the correct decision is not \nthe point. \nC. Equal Protection and State Racial \nDiscrimination Claims \nThe players argue that they have raised material facts showing that the officers' \n\nactions were impermissibly motivated by race in violation of the Equal Protection \nClause and Rhode Island state laws. There are disputes over whether the legal \ncontours of the rights in question would have been clear to a reasonable officer and \nover whether a reasonable officer would have perceived a violation of recognized \nrights under the factual circumstances present in this case. We begin with the rights in \nquestion and then assess the factual circumstances. \nOur analysis under the Equal Protection Clause looks to \"(1) whether the appellant \nwas treated differently than others similarly situated, and (2) whether such difference \nwas based on an impermissible consideration, such as race.\" Macone v. Town of \nWakefield, 277 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002). A plaintiff must show that the defendant \n\"selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of, not \nmerely in spite of, its adverse effects\" upon a protected group. In re Subpoena to \nWitzel, 531 F.3d 113, 119 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. \n598, 610 (1985)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Such intent may be \"inferred from \nthe totality of the relevant facts.\" Donahue v. City of Boston, 371 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. \n2004) (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 242 (1976)). \nThe players assert that this analysis forbids official actions that \"effectuate the known \ndiscriminatory intention of others.\" Citing United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837 \nF.2d 1181 (2d Cir. 1987), they argue that a police search that works to effectuate such \ndiscriminatory intentions voiced by a crowd violates the Equal Protection Clause. See \nid. at 1226. We read that decision more narrowly; in any event, it is insufficient to \nmake plaintiffs' proposition into clearly established law. The players do not cite any \ncases from this court or the Supreme Court finding a violation of the Equal Protection \nClause in the absence of purposeful discrimination on the part of the relevant officials. \nAccordingly, we hold that the players have not shown that it is clearly established that \nacts that effectuate the known discriminatory intent of others, without more, violate the \nEqual Protection Clause. See Davis, 426 U.S. at 241-42; McGuire v. Reilly, 386 F.3d \n45, 63 (1st Cir. 2004). \nUnder our clearly established equal protection analysis, the players have failed to \ndemonstrate that all officers of reasonable competence would have believed that the \nrequest for a search of the players produced differential treatment. Given that the \npublic had access to the unlocked Coventry locker room, the players argue that the \nofficers had no more reason to search them than they had to search the crowd. \nIndeed, they argue that the officers had even less reason to search the players \nbecause the officers knew Coach Marchand had already searched them and a \nsecurity guard had accompanied them into the locker room. These claims belie the \nundisputed fact that Coach Marchand identified the players as the \"prime suspects\" in \nhis discussion with the police. Even if Coach Marchand merely intended to convey the \ncrowd's opinion, members of the crowd had not been accused of theft. \nEven if we assume that the officers had no more reason to search the players than the \ncrowd, the players fail to produce sufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to defeat \nqualified immunity. This court has noted that discriminatory animus seldom \"wears its \ngarb openly\" and more often comes \"masked\" in \"subtle forms.\" Soto v. Flores, 103 \nF.3d 1056, 1067 n.12 (quoting Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074, \n1082 (3d Cir. 1996)). Nonetheless, to survive summary judgment, the non-moving \nparty must make more than \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, or \nunsupported speculation.\" Pineda v. Toomey, 533 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2008). A non-\nmoving party must \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial.\" Id. at 53-54 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986)). \nThe players do not present such specific facts on the issue of racial animus in this \n\ncase. They point to the alleged racial slurs made by the crowd and claim that the \nofficers should have ordered the crowd to disperse or move farther away from the bus. \nThey also claim that the officers sought to incite the crowd by displaying some of the \nplayers' iPods and cell phones. But testimony from both Coach Marchand and the \nplayers contradicts the inference that racial animus motivated the officers. No officer \nuttered a racial slur. It is uncontested that the officers acted courteously and told \nmembers of the crowd to stop jeering at the players. There is no evidence that all \nofficers of reasonable competence would have believed the search was undertaken \nbecause of the national origin or race of the players. \nGiven this conclusion, the players also cannot defeat the officers' qualified immunity \ndefenses against their claims under Rhode Island's Racial Profiling Prevention Act \nand Ethnic Intimidation Statute. The Racial Profiling Prevention Act covers \"disparate \ntreatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in part, of the racial or ethnic status \nof such individual,\" with an exception not relevant here. R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-21.2-3. \nThe Ethnic Intimidation Statute covers behavior \"which would reasonably be \nconstrued as intended to harass or intimidate [a] person because of his or her race.\" \nR.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-35(a). For the reasons stated above, the players have not raised \na genuine issue of material fact that satisfies either of these standards. \nIII. \nThe record does demonstrate, regrettably, that the players were subject to ethnic \nanimosity from Coventry inhabitants. Although the plaintiffs do not raise sufficiently \nmaterial facts to survive summary judgment, the Town and its voters may wish to take \nsteps to prevent recurrences of such behavior. \nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed. \nOpinion Dissenting in Part Follows \nTHOMPSON, Circuit Judge, (Dissenting in part). \nI agree with my colleagues that a reasonable officer could have believed that Coach \nMarchand had in loco parentis authority to consent to the search of the players and \nthat their equal protection claims must fail. My colleagues and I part company, \nhowever, on the issue of qualified immunity. Because I cannot subscribe to the \nmajority's determination that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because \nthey could reasonably have believed that Coach Marchand voluntarily consented to \nthe search of his students, I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nThe appellants, a team of young Hispanic soccer players from Central Falls, Rhode \nIsland were subjected to shockingly disgraceful and humiliating conduct by the police \nand their fellow citizens alike while visiting another high school in Coventry, Rhode \nIsland.[5] After playing a tense game against Coventry's team, the Central Falls players \nwere surrounded by a mob seething with racial animosity and casting false \naccusations of theft. When the police arrived and observed the crowd's obstruction of \nthe bus, they parked their cruisers in front of and behind the Central Falls team's bus, \ntrapping them with their antagonists. Then, rather than take any action to meaningfully \ninvestigate any accusations or pacify the crowd, which continued to simmer \n\nmenacingly, the officers questioned the Central Falls team and sought its coach's \npermission to search their belongings. \nMy colleagues think that a reasonable officer would be unaware of the duress this \nstate of affairs would inspire in the team's coach. In my view, however, the officers' \nrequest of Coach Marchand while he was surrounded by an angry mob and unable to \ndepart with his players left little room for choice. He was subjected to coercion which, \nthough subtler than a peremptory command and more courteous than the irate mob, \ncould hardly be plainer. This coercion vitiated any consent he could give, rendering \nthe subsequent search unlawful. \nThe basic factual scenario is not largely disputed by the parties and my colleagues \nand I recognize that all reasonable inferences drawn from the facts are to be \nconstrued in the plaintiffs' favor.[6] Maj. Op. at 3. The officers invoked qualified \nimmunity as a defense to their actions. My colleagues set out the relevant law, see \nMaj. Op. at 11-14, which I accept and reprise briefly. \nII. \n\"Qualified immunity balances two important interests — the need to hold public \nofficials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield \nofficials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties \nreasonably.\" Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 815 (2009). \nTo defeat the immunity, the players must show that (1) the officers \"violated [their] \nconstitutionally protected right\" and (2) \"the particular right . . . was clearly established \nat the time of the violation.\" Raiche v. Pietroski, 623 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 2010). \nFurther, \"in applying the second prong, we must consider two subsidiary issues: (a) \nthe clarity of the law in general at the time of the alleged violation; and (b) the clarity of \nthe law as applied to the case\"—simply put, we ask \"whether a reasonable [officer] in \nthe defendant's shoes `would have understood that his conduct violated the [players'] \nconstitutional rights.'\" Id. at 35-36 (quoting Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 269 \n(1st Cir. 2009)). In undertaking this inquiry, we do not consider the defendants' \nsubjective beliefs concerning the unlawfulness of their conduct. See Philip v. Cronin, \n537 F.3d 26, 34 (1st Cir. 2008). Instead, this inquiry is based on an objective test—\nwhat a reasonable officer would have known. Id. Nonetheless, \"[a] determination of \nobjective reasonableness `will often require examination of the information possessed' \nby the defendant officials.\" Kelley v. LaForce, 288 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting \nAnderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 641 (1987)). \nIn granting qualified immunity to the officers, my colleagues analyzed only the second \nprong of the test, as permitted by Pearson. Maj. Op. at 12. Because I would deny \nqualified immunity, however, I must address both aspects of the analysis. \nA. \nThe first prong of the qualified immunity test asks whether a violation of constitutional \nrights actually occurred. Raiche, 623 F.3d at 35. It has long been recognized that the \nFourth Amendment bars all warrantless searches \"subject only to a few specifically \nestablished . . . exceptions\" such as the presence of probable cause, exigent \ncircumstances, or valid consent. See Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357, 357 \nn.19, 358 n.22 (1967). Accordingly, absent such an exception to the warrant \nrequirement the officers' search of the Central Falls players was improper and a clear \n\nviolation of the players' constitutional right to be free from warrantless searches. \nThe officers rely only upon Coach Marchand's consent to validate their search. Of \ncourse, the consent must have been voluntarily given. Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 \nU.S. 543, 548 (1968). That is, it must not have been the product of \"duress or \ncoercion,\" Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248 (1973), or intimidation, \nMoran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986), either express or implied. See United \nStates v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 264-65 (1st Cir. 2008). Because, as discussed \nbelow, I believe that a reasonable officer would have known that Coach Marchand's \nconsent to the search of his players was coerced, the first prong of the qualified \nimmunity test is easily satisfied: there was an actual violation in the form of an \nunconstitutional search. \nB. \nThe second prong of the qualified immunity inquiry asks whether it was clear, both \nlegally and factually, that the officers' search was non-consensual. Raiche, 623 F.3d \nat 35. My colleagues and I agree that it is clearly established under the Fourth \nAmendment that voluntary consent is required to validate a suspicionless, warrantless \nsearch and that \"all officers of reasonable competence would have known that \ncoercion vitiates consent to a search under the Fourth Amendment.\" Maj. Op. at 17. \nWe also agree that the presence of coercion is determined by an open-ended test that \nconsiders \"`all the surrounding circumstances,' including `subtly coercive police \nquestions' and `the possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents.'\" \nMaj. Op. at 19 (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 229). Where we disagree is whether \nthe facts of this particular case, applied to that law, clearly make out a violation of the \nplayers' Fourth Amendment rights. Ultimately, my colleagues \"cannot say that all \nofficers of reasonable competence,\" confronted with the facts of this case, \"would \nhave concluded that Coach Marchand's consent to the search was invalid.\" Maj. Op. \nat 26. On the contrary, I believe that the players' rights were violated, and that a \nreasonable officer would have concluded that the search was unconstitutional. \n1. \nIn analyzing the second prong of the qualified immunity test we must ask whether a \nreasonable officer in the defendants' position would have known that Coach Marchand \nfelt coerced into consenting to the search. The central question, then, is how the \nreasonable officer would have assessed the voluntariness of Marchand's consent. \nAs we have explained, \"[v]oluntariness is a question of fact that turns on [a] \ncomprehensive assessment of the totality of the circumstances attending the \ninteraction between [the individual] and the searching officers.\" Vanvliet, 542 F.3d at \n264. Threats, intimidation, and coercion are all factors to consider in analyzing the \ntotality of the circumstances, but they are not the only ones. See, e.g., United States v. \nPérez-MontaZez, 202 F.3d 434, 438 (1st Cir. 2000). Indeed, in considering the totality \nof the circumstances, no single coercive element will usually suffice to end the \nanalysis. See Maj. Op. at 20 (citing W. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 8.2(b), at 62 \n(4th ed. 2004)). Instead, we must look to the circumstances surrounding Marchand's \nconsent and determine whether they establish that a reasonable officer could have \nconcluded that he gave it voluntarily. See United States v. Twomey, 884 F.2d 46, 51 \n(1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that we must look to \"all the circumstances surrounding the \nsecuring of the consent\" when determining the voluntariness thereof). \n\nMoreover, the determination of an individual's voluntariness in consenting to a search \nis a subjective, fact-intensive endeavor that \"turns not on whether a `reasonable' \nperson in the [individual's] position would have felt compelled to consent to a police \nofficer's request to search, but, rather, on whether the [individual] [him]self actually felt \ncompelled to consent.\" United States v. Hall, 969 F.2d 1102, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1992); \naccord Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 226; Twomey, 884 F.2d at 51. Consent is coerced \nwhen an individual's \"will ha[s] been overborne and his capacity for self-determination \ncritically impaired\" to the point that he does not face an \"essentially free and \nunconstrained choice.\" United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 424 (1976)(internal \nquotation marks omitted). \nThroughout this inquiry, we must recall that on summary judgment, when assessing \nthe factual circumstances in which an individual consented to a search and the \npossible assumptions a reasonable officer might have made about the corresponding \nvoluntariness, \"we are required to draw every reasonable inference in favor of the \nnonmoving party\" — here the Central Falls players. Dennis v. Osram Sylvania, Inc., \n549 F.3d 851, 858 (1st Cir. 2008); see also Vera v. McHugh, 622 F.3d 17, 27 n. 11 \n(1st Cir. 2010) (recalling \"our duty to take the facts in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party on summary judgment\"). This is a tough case, but in my view the \nbalance tips against qualified immunity. \n2. \nHaving set out the relevant law, I turn now to the factual analysis. \nThe majority justifies its determination that Marchand's consent was valid in large part \nbased on United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194 (2002). In Drayton, three police \nofficers boarded a bus as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction. One officer \nwas at the front of the bus, facing the rear, and another officer was at the rear of the \nbus, facing forward. The third officer walked down the bus aisle from the back to the \nfront, stopping to speak with passengers along the way. Neither the aisle nor the front \nexit was ever blocked. Passengers who declined to speak with the officer or who \nchose to exit the bus were allowed to do so. As the officer approached Drayton's seat, \nhe showed his badge and stated that his purpose on the bus was to look for drugs and \nguns. The officer asked if Drayton and his companion, Brown, had any bags. They \nanswered affirmatively, so the officer asked for permission to search the bags. Brown \nagreed and no contraband was found. The officer then asked if he could conduct a \npatdown of Brown. He agreed and was arrested after the patdown revealed \ncontraband. The same is true of Drayton. A further search revealed that both \nindividuals had cocaine taped between their shorts. Drayton and Brown were charged \nwith federal drug crimes and moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that their \nconsent to the patdown search was invalid. The Supreme Court held that the \ndefendants' consent was not a product of coercion because, among other reasons, \nthere had been \"no threat, no command, [and] not even an authoritative tone of voice.\" \nId. at 204. \nRelying on Drayton, my colleagues place great stock in the politeness with which the \nofficers interacted with Coach Marchand and the students.[7] Without a doubt, had the \nofficers commanded Marchand to submit, or acted in a threatening, domineering, \nboorish, or otherwise inappropriate way, this case would be easier. But the fact that \nthe officers were polite, particularly given all else that was occurring at the highly \ncharged scene, does not establish that Marchand was not coerced. The Supreme \nCourt has explained that subtle and polite coercion is just as objectionable as more \n\nobvious browbeating. Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 228. \nFurthermore, we have admonished courts to \"go beyond appearances and inquire \nwhether the consent was a voluntary, intentional and understood waiver of a known \nright, or, on the contrary, was the product of deceit, duress and coercion, actual or \nimplicit.\" United States v. Berkowitz, 429 F.2d 921, 925 (1st Cir. 1970)(internal \nquotation marks omitted). The \"beyond appearances\" inquiry is particularly important \nhere: though the police may have been polite and refrained from issuing commands in \nan authoritative tone of voice, they nonetheless blocked the bus in, leaving the players \nno way out, essentially \"appeas[ing] the masses\" who were \"crying for [the players'] \nheads.\" Maj. Op. at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also infra at 12-15. \nUltimately, the officers' demeanor can be but one factor in our analysis, and certainly \n\"not the only one.\" Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 437 (1991). \nSimilarly, although the majority is correct that the officers' failure to notify Marchand \nthat he could refuse to consent is not dispositive, Maj. Op. at 20, it is yet one more \nfactor of the many in this narrative that, taken together, militate against qualified \nimmunity in this case. See Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 227 (\"[T]he failure of the police to \nadvise the accused of his rights [is] certainly [a] factor[] to be evaluated in assessing \nthe `voluntariness' of [his] [consent] . . . .\"); see also Drayton, 536 U.S. at 202 (quoting \nBostick, 501 U.S. at 432)(explaining that one factor \"particularly worth noting\" when \nconsidering whether consent to search was coerced was that the officer had advised \nthe passenger of his right to refuse to consent). \nLike the issue of politeness and failure to warn an individual of his right to refuse \nconsent, police custody is yet another factor worthy of consideration. Watson, 423 \nU.S. at 424. True, \"custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate . . . \ncoerced . . . consent to search,\" 423 U.S. at 424, but we have previously observed \nthat \"sensitivity to the heightened possibility of coercion is appropriate when a[n] \n[individual's] consent is obtained during custody,\" United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d \n546, 555 (1st Cir. 1993). \nThere is no question that Marchand was in police custody at the time he consented to \nthe search.[8] The officers parked their cruisers in front of and behind the players' bus, \npreventing them from leaving. This alone distinguishes our case from Drayton, which \ninvolved \"no blocking of exits.\" 536 U.S. at 204. In Drayton, even though there was an \nofficer at the front of the bus, \"he said nothing to suggest that people could not exit \nand . . . left the aisle clear.\" Id. at 205. This is significantly different from the facts of \nthe present case where the players' bus was completely boxed in by patrol cars. \nSurely, no reasonable officer could have believed that the plaintiffs felt free to leave. \nOf course, it may be true that the officers trapped the players with the crowd before \nthey were aware of the nature of the controversy and of the danger, fear, and \nconcomitant coercion they would cause by doing so. See Maj. Op. at 25. But this is \nbeside the point: at the time the officers sought Marchand's permission to search the \nplayers a reasonable officer would certainly have been aware, at that crucial moment, \nthat the positioning of their cruisers left the players with no way out. Cf. Terry v. Ohio, \n392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968) (explaining in analogous context that in evaluating the \nreasonableness of a search or seizure, courts look to the state of the facts \"at the \nmoment of the seizure or the search\"). Regardless, Marchand's fearful inquiry of the \nofficers in response to their request for consent (\"[w]hat [is the crowd] going to do to \nus?\") should have made apparent the fear elicited in him by being blocked in with the \ncrowd. \nThe majority states that \"[t]he officers could have reasonably thought that they made \n\nclear [to Coach Marchand] that they would prevent the crowd from harming [his] \nplayers . . . .\" Maj. Op. at 25. This conclusion is incredible—particularly in light of the \nfact that the officers never responded to Marchand's initial inquiry regarding the \ncrowd's behavior. In addition, there were only four officers on the scene, yet they were \nresponsible for controlling an angry, boisterous, irrational crowd of approximately fifty \nto sixty people. With a mere six to ten feet buffer between the hostile crowd and the \nplayers, I cannot fathom how any reasonable officer would think that the defendants \nmade clear to Coach Marchand that he and his players would go unharmed. The \nmajority points out that \"the officers did not convey to Coach Marchand that they \nwould not move their cruisers until he agreed to a search\" and that the officers \"were \n[not] . . . asked to move the cruisers.\" Maj. Op. at 26. That may very well be the case, \nbut so too is the converse—the officers never offered nor took any action to move their \ncruisers on their own before soliciting Coach Marchand's permission. \nNevertheless, Marchand's fearful inquiry shows that he felt threatened and intimidated \nby the crowd. That Marchand did not translate his fear and intimidation of the crowd \ninto a particularized request—for example, by asking the officers to move their \ncruisers or asking if there were any other options other than consenting to a search of \nhis players—does not eliminate this factor from consideration. As the Supreme Court \nhas explained, \"the crucial test is whether, taking into account all of the circumstances \nsurrounding the encounter, the police conduct would have communicated to a \nreasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go \nabout his business.\" Bostick, 501 U.S. at 437 (emphasis added)(internal quotation \nmarks omitted). Any officer should have recognized that Coach Marchand did not feel \nat liberty to leave. \nThe majority acknowledges that \"the players' evidence depicts a difficult situation in \nwhich Coach Marchand faced a genuine choice between imperfect solutions,\" Maj. \nOp. at 23, but nonetheless decides that \"these circumstances do not establish . . . that \nCoach Marchand's will had been overborne or that his capacity for self-determination \nwas critically impaired.\" Id. at 24. To support this conclusion the majority notes that \nCoach Marchand testified at his deposition that he \"`debated' telling the officers to get \na search warrant, but rejected that option,\" after weighing his alternatives, Maj. Op. at \n24, and ultimately \"concluded that his role as coach was to ensure first and foremost \nthat [his] players got home safely\" Id. But Coach Marchand's thought process, and the \nactions he \"debated\" taking, are completely irrelevant. Marchand's testimony was \ngiven after the fact and was not communicated to any officer at the scene of the \nincident. The hypothetical reasonable officer cannot read minds; therefore, in \nanalyzing whether such an officer would have known that Coach Marchand's consent \nwas coerced, it is simply common sense that only facts actually communicated to or \nobserved by the officer are relevant. \nMy colleagues are apparently of two minds on this issue: though they initially rely on \nMarchand's uncorroborated description of his internal thought process in an effort to \nnegate the coercion he suffered, they later recognize that his subjective, unexpressed \nthoughts and feelings are irrelevant when dismissing Marchand's testimony that he felt \ncoerced into consenting. see Maj. Op. at 26 (\"It is not enough that Coach Marchand \ndescribed his consent to the search as coerced; . . . [w]hile a jury might find that \nCoach Marchand subjectively believed his consent was coerced that is not the issue \nhere; we must look to the view of the reasonable officer.\"). As I have previously \ndiscussed, Marchand's objective manifestations of coercion were amply supported by \nevidence available to the officers. In analyzing the coercive atmosphere under which \nMarchand gave his consent, I would consider only those facts available to a \nreasonable officer at the time of the search. \n\nIf more were needed, and I doubt that there is, the officers exacerbated the situation \nby \"ma[king] little to no effort to quell or disperse the crowd, even as [it] verbally \nassailed the players[,] shouting racist epithets and accusations of theft.\" Lopera v. \nTown of Coventry, 652 F. Supp. 2d 203, 210 (D.R.I. 2009). With the possibly violent \nassembly looming, the officers questioned Marchand. Taking the crowd's word over \nMarchand's, they elected to pursue a search of the Central Falls students before \nadequately calming the mob or even ascertaining what, if anything, had actually been \nstolen. \nMy colleagues, in further reliance on Drayton, note that there was no testimony that \nthe request to search was made in \"an authoritative tone of voice.\" Maj. Op. at 23 \n(internal quotation marks omitted). But tone of voice cannot be dispositive of the \ncoercion inquiry. Al Capone said you can get more with a kind word and a gun than \nwith just a kind word; a mob can be just as \"convincing\" as a gun. \nThe officers knew that Marchand felt threatened by the crowd. They knew he had \nalready capitulated to the intense coercion and intimidation exerted by the mob, \ndelaying his team's departure for about a half-hour to engage in a search that he knew \nbeforehand would be futile in order to satisfy the crowd's demands. Still, the officers \ndid practically nothing to assuage that fear or mitigate the coercion, and indeed kept \nthe players' bus trapped with the crowd for more than ten minutes before capitalizing \non Marchand's weakened state to elicit consent for a duplicative search. Without a \ndoubt, such behavior is contrary to the general recognition that police officers have a \nduty to protect the public and public safety. See, e.g., Bordanaro v. McLeod, 871 F.2d \n1151, 1164 (1st Cir. 1989)(referencing district court's assertion in excessive force \ncase that \"the primary duty of the police departments and policemen is to protect and \npreserve life and property and the public peace \")(emphasis added). \nIt is inappropriate to create an artificial dichotomy between the coercion applied by the \nofficers and that applied by the crowd they failed to adequately control, and then to \nomit the latter from consideration. To do so subverts the totality-of-the-circumstances \nanalysis that is required of us. Even the majority recognizes this. In rejecting the \nofficers' argument that coercion, in the context of Fourth Amendment analysis, must \n\"`emanat[e] from the police officers themselves rather than any subjective or outside \ninfluence,'\" the majority noted that clearly established law requires consideration of \"all \nthe surrounding circumstances.\" Maj. Op. at 17-18 (citing Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at \n227, and concluding that Colorado v. Connelly 479 U.S. 157 (1986), which held that \n\"coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \n`voluntary' within the meaning of the Due Process Clause,\" id. at 167, does not extend \nto Fourth Amendment consent cases). \nA reasonable officer in the defendants' position would have known that Marchand, \nwho expressed fear of the crowd, was under a significant amount of duress. This \nduress was caused both by the raucous mob hurling menacing accusations, threats, \nand racial epithets and the officers themselves, who blocked Marchand's team in with \nthe crowd, failed to take adequate measures to calm or disperse it, and immediately \ntook its side against Marchand upon arriving, despite lacking any reasoned basis for \ndoing so. Given the officers' exchange with Marchand, they knew or at least should \nhave objectively known, that he felt constrained by their failure to disperse the crowd \nor allow the bus to leave and that he feared the racial animus in the crowd aimed at \nhis players. On these facts, a reasonable officer would have known that Marchand \nbelieved he had no option for getting his students home safely but to consent to their \ndemand for a search. Moreover, a reasonable officer would conclude that Marchand's \nresponsibility for the safety of his charges and his increasing tardiness in getting them \n\nhome would make him particularly vulnerable to this type of coercion. \nIII. \nI am gravely concerned that our case law is treading terribly close to creating \"an \nimpenetrable defense for government officals\" and a \"significant risk that qualified \nimmunity will always attach.\" Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 41 (1st Cir. \n2003)(equally divided en banc court)(opinion of Bownes, J.). The Fourth Amendment \nis one of our most precious constitutional rights. We should not so comfortably defer to \nthe judgment of government officials at the cost of eviscerating such a fundamental \nright of our citizens—a right this nation has declared deserves the highest protection. \nIndeed, our task in undertaking a qualified immunity inquiry requires the contrary. It is \nafter all \"an attempt to balance competing values: not only the importance of a \ndamages remedy to protect the rights of citizens, but also `the need to protect officials \nwho are required to exercise their discretion and the related public interest in \nencouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.'\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. \n800, 807 (1982)(quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.S. 478, 504-06 (1978))(citation \nomitted). \nWith these concerns in mind and taking, as I must, every inference available in the \nrecord in favor of the plaintiffs, I cannot say that a reasonable officer in the defendants' \nposition could have concluded that Marchand voluntarily consented to the search. The \nCentral Falls team's rights were violated; the violation was clear; and a reasonable \nofficer should have recognized it. I would vacate the district court's entry of summary \njudgment and remand for resolution of the factual disputes upon which the officers' \nclaim of qualified immunity turns. \n[1] This crowd apparently did not include any soccer players. \n[2] One officer testified that Coach Marchand suggested the search and that they conducted the search because it \nwould \"expedite the process and eliminate them all as suspects.\" These are disputed facts and for these purposes \nwe do not accept them. \n[3] The players have conceded that their Due Process claim was not intended to allege a violation of their \nsubstantive due process rights and thus overlaps with their Fourth Amendment claim. \n[4] Although this language derives from Drayton's analysis of whether a seizure had occurred in that case, the \nCourt noted that \"[i]n circumstances such as these, where the question of voluntariness pervades both the search \nand seizure inquiries, the respective analyses turn on very similar facts.\" United States v. Drayton, 536 U.S. 194, \n206 (2002). The Court's analysis of whether the defendant's consent was coerced invoked the factual discussion in \nits analysis of whether the defendant had been seized. Id. \n[5] The record reflects that the Central Falls players were bi-lingual. \n[6] In their brief, the defendant officers note that if the case were to go to trial they would dispute both the number \nof spectators alleged to be watching the exchange as well as the plaintiffs' reference to the spectators as a \"mob.\" \n[7] Though I would hardly describe the decision to conduct an invasive search of the players in front of a hostile, \njeering, photo-taking crowd as \"polite,\" the players do not appear to challenge this characterization. \n[8] There is no need to determine whether Marchand was in legal custody. By \"custody\" I refer only to the factual \nscenario by which the bus was blocked in by police cruisers, effectively blocking any means of exit for the plaintiffs \n \n     ",

C.A.  No.  08-123S \n  \nTOWN OF  COVENTRY,  ET AL, \nDEFENDANTS. \n  \nDEFENDANTS’'  SUPPLEMENTAL  MEMORANDUM  OF  LAW  IN  SUPPORT \nOF  MOTION  FOR  SUMMARY  JUDGMENT \nL  INTRODUCTION \nOn  May  26,  2009,  this  Court  held  a hearing  on  Defendants’  Motion  for  Summary \nJudgment.  During  that  hearing,  two  (2)  issues  were  raised  that warrant  further  briefing \nby  the  parties.  First,  although the  Complaint  is  not  clear,  plaintiffs’  attorney  represented \nduring  the  hearing  that  plaintiffs  intended  to  maintain  a  federal  claim  against the  Town \nfor  failure  to  train  and  supervise.  In  addition,  during  the  hearing,  plaintiffs’  attorney \nargued  that  a  factual  issue  existed  as  to  whether  the  coach  felt  coerced  into  consenting  to \nthe  search  by  the  crowd  of spectators.  Defendants  hereby  submit the  instant \nSupplemental  Memorandum  addressing  both these  issues. \nI.  ARGUMENT \nA.  FAILURE  TO  TRAIN AND  SUPERVISE \nAlthough  plaintiff does  not  specifically  delineate  a  cause  of action  for  failure  to \ntrain  and/or  supervise,  the  Amended  Complaint  contains  the  general  factual  allegation \nthat the  Town  and  former  Chief O’Rourke  failed  to  adequately  train  or  supervise  the \n  \n'  The Defendants  are the four Coventry Police  Department officers who responded to the incident (Kevin P. \nHarris, Kevin Kennedy,  David Nelson,  and Stephen A.  Michailides), the  Treasurer of the  Town (Warren \nWest),  former Chief of Police  for the  Town of Coventry,  Brian O’Rourke  and current Chief of \nPolice,Ronald E.  DaSilva.\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  2  of  15  PagelD  #:  273 \npolice  officers  “relative  to  proper  manner  in  which to  conduct  searches  and  seizures.” \nAmended Complaint,  paragraph  33  (Document  #24).  During  the  May  26,  2009,  hearing, \nplaintiffs’  attorney  represented  that  plaintiffs  were  seeking  to  maintain  a Monell  claim \nbased  on the  alleged  failure  to  train  or  supervise.  Defendants  thus  hereby  move  for the \nentry  of summary judgment  on  plaintiffs’  federal  claim  for  failure  to  train  or  supervise. \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  imposed  a high  burden  on  parties  seeking  to  recover \nagainst  a municipality  or  supervisory  personal  for  an  alleged  failure  to  train  under  $  /983. \nIn  fact,  in  City  of Canton  y.  Harris,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  held  that there  are \n  \nonly  “limited  circumstances  in which  an  allegation  of a  ‘failure  to  train’  can  be  the  basis \nfor  liability  under  §  1983.”  489  U.S.  378,  387  (1989). \nOf course,  in  order to  maintain  a  claim  against the  Town  itself under  $  /983,  the \nplaintiff must  demonstrate  in the  first  instance  that  it was  an  unlawful,  unconstitutional \npolicy,  practice  or  custom  that  lead  to  the  constitutional  deprivation.  Monell  y.  City  of \nNew  York Dept.  of Soc.  Services,  436  U.S.  658  (1978).  In  City  of Canton  y.  Harris  489 \n     \nU.S.  378,  387  (1989),  the  Supreme  Court  clarified  the  standard  and  held  that the  “policy” \nrequirement  limiting  municipal  liability  in §  /9S3  cases  under Monell  can  be  satisfied  in \nmunicipal  “failure  to  train”  cases  only  (1)  where  employees  of a  local  government \ncommit  a  constitutional  violation  (2)  due  to  a  lack  of training  by  municipal  policy  makers \n(3)  who  are  “deliberately  indifferent”  to  the  need  for the  training  and  4)  it was  this  lack  of \ntraining  that  caused  the  constitutional  violation. \nThis  standard  thus  first  requires  a  constitutional  event,  i.e.,  an  underlying \nconstitutional  violation that the  failure  to  train  causes.  Bad  facts  or  a  single  outrageous \nevent  is  insufficient.  Some  kind  of wrong  of constitutional  dimension  must  be  present.\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  3  of  15  PagelD  #:  274 \nMonell,  436  U.S.  at  690-91.  Inthe  instant  case,  as  more  fully  addressed  during  the \nsummary judgment  hearing,  defendants  maintain that  under Pearson  v.  Callahan,  129  S. \n  \nCt.  808  (U.S.  2009),  the  Court  need  not  reach the  issue  of whether  a  constitutional \nviolation  occurred  in  order to  find  that the  officers  are  entitled  to  qualified  immunity.  If \nthe  Court were  to  nevertheless  reach this  issue  and  decide  that the  undisputed  facts  failed \nto  support  a  finding  of a  constitutional  violation,  plaintiffs’  §  1983  claim  against the \nmunicipality  and  Chief will  likewise  fail.  City  of Los Angeles  v.  Heller,  475  U.S.  796, \n  \n799  (1986)  (“Ifa person  has  suffered no  constitutional  injury  at  the  hands  of the \nindividual police  officer,  the fact  that  the  departmental regulations  might have  authorized \nthe  use  of constitutionally  excessive force  is  quite  beside  the point”);  Evans  v.  Avery,  100 \nF.3d 1033,  1039-40  (1st  Cir.  1996) (where  individual  officers  did violate plaintiff's \nconstitutional rights  in  the  course  of a  high  speed pursuit,  the  City  likewise  could not  be \nheld liable for  the  alleged failure  to  monitor police pursuits  and through  its failure  to \nsupervise police  officers  involved in  such pursuits). \nEven  accepting,  arguendo,  the  premise  that the  officers’  actions  amounted  to  a \nconstitutional  deprivation  because  the  Coach  could  not  consent  on  behalf of the  plaintiffs \nand/or that the  police  lacked  probable  cause  to  search,  in  order  to  succeed  on their  failure \nto  train  claim,  plaintiffs  must  demonstrate  that the  Town  and  Chief were  deliberately \nindifferent  in the  failure  to  train  the  officers.  In  City  of  Canton,  489  U.S.  378,  387 \n(1989),  the  plaintiff had  alleged  that  due  to  the  inadequacy  of police  training,  the  City  of \nCanton  and  its  officials  violated  plaintiff's  constitutional  right to  receive  medical \nattention while  in  police  custody.  /d. at 382.  After the jury  ruled  in the  plaintiff's  favor, \nthe  city  made  a  motion  for judgment  notwithstanding  the  verdict,  claiming  that  a\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  4  of  15  PagelD  #:  275 \nmunicipality  can  only  be  found  liable  under  §  1983  where  the  policy  in  place  is  itself \nunconstitutional.  In  rejecting  the  city’s  narrow  interpretation  of §  1983,  the  Canton  court \nestablished  the  following  standard  for  evaluating  valid  policies  alleged  to  have  been \nunconstitutionally  applied: \nThe  inadequacy  of police  training  may  serve  as  the  basis  for  §  1983  liability  only \nwhere  the  failure  to  train  amounts  to  deliberate  indifference  to  the  rights  of \npersons  with  whom  the  police  came  into  contact...  .  Only  where  a municipality’s \nfailure  to  train  its  employees  in  a relevant  respect  evidences  a  ‘deliberate \nindifference’  to  the  rights  of 1ts  inhabitants  can  such  a  shortcoming  be  properly \nthought  of as  a  city  “policy  or  custom’  that  is  actionable  under  §  1983...  .  Only \nwhere a  failure  to  train  reflects  a  ‘deliberate’  or  ‘conscious’  choice  by  a \nmunicipality—a  ‘policy’  as  defined  by  our  prior  cases—can  a city  be  liable  for \nsuch  a  failure  under  §  1983.  Jd.  at  388-89  (emphasis  added). \nThus,  for  liability  to  stem  from  a  failure  to  train,  the  Plaintiff must  show  an  actual \npolicy  of inadequate  training,  where  “the  need  for  more  or  different training  is  so \nobvious,  and  the  inadequacy  so  likely  to  result  in the  violation  of constitutional  rights, \nthat the  policymakers  of the  city  can  reasonably  be  said  to  have  been  deliberately \nindifferent to  the  need.”  Jd. at  390.  Plaintiffs  must  also  demonstrate  that  a municipality \ndeliberately  chose  an  inadequate  training  program.  Jd.  at  389. \nThe  “deliberate  indifference”  standard  has  been  broken  down  into  three  elements: \n(1)  that  a  policymaker  of the  municipality  knows  to  a  moral  certainty  that  its \nemployees  will  confront  a  given  situation; \n(2)  that the  situation  either  presents  the  employee  with  a  difficult  choice  of the \nsort that training  or  supervision will  make  less  difficult  or that there  is  a  history  of \nemployees  mishandling  the  situation;  and \n(3)  that the  wrong  choice  by  the  employee  will  frequently  cause  the  deprivation  of \na  citizen’s  constitutional  rights. \nSmith  v.  Town  of E.  Haven,  2005  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS 4544  (D.  Conn.  2005)  citing \n  \nNicholson  v.  Scoppetta,  344 F.3d 154,  166  (2d Cir.  2003)  (citations  omitted). \n \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  5  of  15  PagelD  #:  276 \n“Absent  any  showing  of previous  harm  arising  from  this  training  policy,  or  any \nevidence  of deliberation  on the  [defendants’]  part,  plaintiff fails  to  demonstrate  an  issue \nof material  fact  as  to  whether  the  Defendants  actually  chose  a policy  with  deliberate \nindifference  toward”  constitutional  rights  of individuals.  Kv.  City  of S.  Portland,  407 F. \n  \nSupp.  2d 290,  297  (D.  Me.  2006). \nIn this  specific  context,  a  showing  of deliberate  indifference  generally  requires  \"a \nshowing  'of more  than  a  single  instance  of the  lack  of training  or  supervision \ncausing  a violation  of constitutional  rights.\"  \"[A]  plaintiff [must]  demonstrate  ‘at \nleast  a  pattern  of similar violations'\"  arising  from  training  or  supervising  \"that  is \nso  clearly  inadequate  as  to  be  ‘obviously  likely  to  result  in  a  constitutional \nviolation.\"\"  A  limited  exception  for  single-incident  liability  exists  only  \"Where  the \nfacts  giving  rise  to  the  violation  are  such that  it  should  have  been  apparent to  the \npolicymaker  that  a  constitutional  violation was  the  highly  predictable \nconsequence  of a  particular  policy  or  failure  to  train.\" \nBrumfield v.  Hollins,  551  F.3d 322,  329  (Sth  Cir.  Miss.  2008)  (citations  omitted). \nIn this  case,  defendants  submit that the  undisputed  facts  fail  to  support  a  finding \nof deliberate  indifference.  In  particular,  there  is  no  basis  to  support the  conclusion  in the \nfirst  instance  that  any  harm  had  resulted  in the  past  from  this  alleged  deficient training  or \n“at  least  a  pattern  of similar violations\"  arising  from  training  or  supervising  \"that  is  so \nclearly  inadequate  as  to  be  ‘obviously  likely  to  result  in  a  constitutional  violation.\" \nBrumfield,  551  F.3d at  329.  Absent  such  alleged  prior  harm  or  even  an  allegation  of such \nharm,  plaintiff cannot  meet  its  burden  of showing  that the  defendants  “actually  chose  a \npolicy  with  deliberate  indifference  toward  the  constitutional  rights  of individuals.”  Kv. \nCity  of S.  Portland,  407 F.  Supp.  2d at 297. \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit  has  addressed  a  similar  claim  regarding  the  need  for \nadditional  training  in the  context  of police  officers  interaction with  students  and \nconcluded  “that the  need  for training  regarding  the  detention  of students  specifically  is\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  6  of  15  PagelD  #:  277 \nnot  obvious  in the  abstract  and  that  a  lack  of such training  is  a  \"possible  imperfection,\" \nbut  not  a  \"glaring  omission\"  from  a training  regimen.”  Gray  v.  Bostic,  458 F.3d 1295, \n1309  (11th  Cir.  Ala.  2006).  In that  case,  the  Special  Resource  officer  at  a  middle  school \ntook  a  student who  had  threatened  to  hit  a teacher  into  the  hallway  and  placed  handcuffs \non  her to  demonstrate  what  it  felt  like  to  get  arrested.  In  addressing  the  failure  to  train \nand  supervise  claim  against the  SRO’s  superior,  the  Court  noted  that the  SRO  had \nreceived  training,  at  both the  police  academy  and  the  Sheriff's  Department,  on the  proper \nuse  of force  and  the  principles  of probable  cause.  The  Court thus  concluded  that  “[t]he \nfailure  to  provide  specific  training  regarding  the  detention  of students,  in  addition \nto  general  training  regarding  use  of force  during  detention  and  22  {sic}  arrest,  was  not \n\"so  likely\"  to  result  in the  violation  of students'  Fourth  Amendment  rights  that  Sheriff \nSexton  reasonably  can  be  said  to  have  been  deliberately  indifferent to  the  need  for this \nparticularized  training  without  any  prior  notice.”  Jd.  citing  inter alia  City  of  Canton,  489 \nU.S.  at  390-92  (finding no  obvious  need to  train jail supervisors  regarding when  to \nprovide  medical  treatment  beyond first aid). \nLikewise,  in the  instant  case,  there  is  nothing  to  support the  finding  that  failure  to \nprovide  additional  training  beyond  that  received  by  the  officers  would  so  likely  result  in \nthe  violation  of students’  civil  rights  that the  Town  or  former  Chief can  be  found  to  have \nbeen  deliberately  indifferent to  the  need  for  the  additional  training.  Moreover,  as  to  the \nTown  itself,  plaintiffs  cannot  point to  any  evidence  that  supports  a  finding  of an \nunconstitutional  policy  or  practice  relative  to  failure  to  properly  train  and  supervise \nofficers.  Monell,  436  U.S.  658.  Absent  such  evidence,  the  Town  and  former  Chief are \nentitled  to  summary judgment.\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  7  of  15  PagelD  #:  278 \nIn  addition,  as  with  all  constitutional  claims,  plaintiff can  only  succeed  on  its \nfailure  to  train  claim  under  $  /983  if that  failure  is  the  cause  or  the  “moving  force” \nbehind  the  underlying  constitutional  deprivation.  See  City  of  Canton,  489  U.S.  at  388.  A \ngovernmental  entity  “is  only  liable  when  it  can  be  fairly  said  that the  city  itself is  the \nwrongdoer.”  Collins  v.  City  of Harker Heights,  503  U.S.  115,  122  (U.S.  1992).  The \n  \nSupreme  Court  has  employed  an  “actual  causation”  standard  in  claims  against  a \nmunicipality  for  the  negligent training  and  supervision  of government  officials  under  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1983.  City  of  Canton,  489  U.S.  at  390.  That  is,  in  order  to  maintain  a  $  1983 \nclaim  against  a municipality,  plaintiff must  demonstrate  that the  claimed  deficiency \n“actually  causes  injury.”  Jd.  The  Supreme  Court has  described  this  burden  as  requiring  a \nshowing  that  “the  identified  deficiency  in a  city’s  training  program  ..  .  [is]  closely  related \nto  the  ultimate  injury...  Would  the  injury  have  been  avoided  had  the  employee  been \ntrained  under  a program  that was  not  deficient  in the  identified  respect?”  Jd. at  391. \nThe  determination  of whether there  is  a  causal  link  has  been  characterized  as  a \nlegal  conclusion  rather than  a  function  of objective  fact.  Britton  v.  Maloney,  901  F.Supp. \n444  (D.  Mass  1995).  The  Supreme  Court  has  further  tutored  that  in  order  to  determine  if \na  plaintiff has  met this  “rigorous  standard”  of causation,  the  Court  should  refer to  state \ntort principles.  Rodriguez-Cirilo  v.  Garcia,  C.A.  No.  96-1306  (Ist  Cir.,  June  2,  1997); \n  \nSoto  vy.  Carrasquillo,  878 F.Supp.  324,  331  (D.  Puerto  Rico  1995).  Under  Rhode  Island’s \n  \ncausation  standard,  plaintiffs  must  demonstrate  that  “but  for”  the  alleged  failure  to  act, \nthe  injury  would  not  have  occurred.  Geloso  v.  Kenny,  812 A.2d 814,  818  (RI.  2002).  In \nthis  case,  given the  circumstances  surrounding  the  consent  and  search,  defendants  submit\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  8  of  15  PagelD  #:  279 \nthat  it  cannot  be  said  that the  lack  of additional  training  (whatever that training  may  have \nbeen)  was  the  driving  force  behind  the  alleged  constitutional  deprivation. \nAccordingly,  defendants  submit that  in  the  instant  case,  as  a matter  of law, \nplaintiffs  are  unable  to  prove  that the  alleged  failure  to  train  is  the  result  of the  Town’s  or \nChief’s  “deliberate  indifference”  or,  in  any  event,  that  such  failure  to  train  caused \nplaintiff to  suffer  a  constitutional  deprivation.  Summary judgment  should  accordingly \nenter  on  behalf of defendants. \nB.  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY FROM FAILURE  TO  TRAIN AND  SUPERVISE \nIt  is  also  noteworthy,  that the  former  Chief O’Rourke,  in  any  event,  is  entitled  to \nqualified  immunity  from  the  failure  to  train  and  supervise  claim  for  all  the  same  reasons \nthat justify  the  granting  of qualified  immunity  for the  officers  actually  involved  in the \nincident.  More  precisely,  it was  not  clearly  established  that  a  coach  in  custody  of \nstudents  on  a  school  sponsored  athletic  event  lacked  capacity  to  consent  on  behalf of the \nstudents  to  a  police  search.  The  event was  not  of such  nature  that the  Chief should  have \nknown that  failure  to  provide  additional  training  would  constitute  deliberate  indifference \nto  the  plaintiffs’  rights.  See  i.e.  Gray,  458 F.3d at  1309  (“the  law  was  not  \"clearly \nestablished\" for purposes  of qualified immunity such  that a  reasonable  official  in \nSheriff[‘s]  ...  shoes  would have  known  that  the failure  to provide  such  training \nconstituted deliberate  indifference”);  Riley  vy.  Newton,  94 F.3d 632,  637  (11th  Cir.  1996) \n(concluding  that sheriff was  entitled to  qualified immunity  on failure-to-train  claim  where \nplaintiffs failed to  cite  case  law  or  constitutional provision  requiring sheriff to provide \ntraining on  how  to  use Army personnel and rejecting plaintiffs' argument  that  City  of \nCanton's general standard of liability  in failure  to  train  cases  clearly  established the\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  9  of  15  PagelD  #:  280 \nright);  Battiste  v.  Sheriff of Broward County,  261  Fed.  Appx.  199,  203  (11th  Cir.  Fla. \n  \n2008).  Consequently,  defendants  submit that  former  Chief O’Rourke  is  entitled  to \nqualified  immunity  from  plaintiffs’  failure  to  train  claim  and  summary judgment  should \nthus  enter  in  his  favor. \nC,  ALLEGED PRESSURE  FROM  CROWD DOES  EFFECT VALIDITY OF \nCONSENT TO  SEARCH \nAnother  issue  raised  during  the  summary judgment  hearing  was  whether the \ncoach’s  consent was  invalid  because  he  allegedly  felt  coerced  by  the  presence  of the \ncrowd.  Plaintiffs  claim  that  a  factual  issue  exists  as  to  whether the  coach  felt  compelled \nto  consent to  the  search  because  of the  crowd  that  had  gathered  near  the  bus.  Defendants \nrespond  that,  as  a  matter  of law,  the  alleged  outside  influence  by  the  third  parties  does  not \ninvalidate  the  coach’s  consent  and  thus  is  irrelevant to  plaintiffs’  constitutional  claims. \nRather,  under  well-settled  precedent  in  order to  invalidate  consent,  there  must  be  coercive \naction by the  officers  themselves.  In this  case,  plaintiffs  do  not  allege  that the  officers \ncoerced  Coach  Marchand  to  consent to  the  search.  Any  alleged  pressure  felt by  Coach \nMarchand  because  of the  crowd  1s  thus  irrelevant to  the  determination  of whether  the \nofficers  are  entitled  to  qualified  immunity. \nAs  noted  in  Defendants’  Memorandum  of Law  in  support  of their  Motion  for \nSummary  Judgment,  \"one  of the  specifically  established  exceptions  to  the  [Fourth \nAmendment]  requirements  of both  a warrant  and  probable  cause  1s  a  search that  is \nconducted  pursuant to  consent.\"  Schneckloth  vy.  Bustamonte,  412  U.S.  218,  219  (1973); \n  \nU.S.  v.  Vilches-Navarrete,  523  F.3d 1,  15  (Ist  Cir.  2008).  Of course,  in  order  for  a \nconsent to  search to  be  valid,  it  must  be  voluntarily  given.  Jd.  at 235.  This  requires \nlooking  at the  totality  of the  circumstances.  U.S.  v.  Jennings,  491  F.Supp.  2d 1072,  1079\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  10  of  15  PagelD  #:  281 \n(MD Ala  2007).  However,  in  evaluating  the  totality  of the  circumstances  in the  context \nof undue  influence  or  coercion,  Courts  have  applied  the  holding  of Colorado  vy.  Connelly, \n  \n479  U.S.  157,  170  (U.S.  1986)  and  required  that  a  consenting  party  who  alleges  coercion \ndemonstrate  that the  coercion  emanated  from  the  police  officers  themselves  rather than \nany  subjective  or  outside  influence.  In  Connelly the  defendant  claimed  that  his \nconfession to  the  police  was  involuntary  due  to  his  mental  condition.  In  rejecting  the \nposition that the  statements  should  be  suppressed  under the  Fourth  Amendment  due  to  the \ndefendant’s  mental  state,  as  opposed  to  police  misconduct  compelling  the  confession,  the \nCourt  surveyed  the  cases  over the  past  fifty  years  and  summarized: \nAbsent  police  conduct  causally  related  to  the  confession,  there  is  simply  no  basis \nfor  concluding  that  any  state  actor  has  deprived  a  criminal  defendant  of due \nprocess  of law.  Respondent  correctly  notes  that  as  interrogators  have  turned  to \nmore  subtle  forms  of psychological  persuasion,  courts  have  found  the  mental \ncondition  of the  defendant  a  more  significant  factor  in the  \"voluntariness\" \ncalculus.  But this  fact  does  not justify  a  conclusion that  a  defendant's  mental \ncondition,  by  itself and  apart  from  its  relation to  official  coercion,  should  ever \ndispose  of the  inquiry  into  constitutional  \"voluntariness.\" \nId.  at  164  (citation  omitted).  The  Supreme  Court thus  rejected  the  defendant’s  claim  that \nthe  Court  must  “find  an  attempted  waiver  invalid  whenever  the  defendant  feels  compelled \nto  waive  his  rights  by  reason  of any  compulsion,  even  if the  compulsion  does  not  flow \nfrom  the  police.”  Jd.  at  170.  The  Court  held  that there  must  be  an  \"essential  link \nbetween  coercive  activity  of the  State,  on the  one  hand,  and  a resulting  confession  by  a \ndefendant,  on  the  other.\"  Jd.  at  165  (emphasis  added).  The  Court  underscored  the  \"state \nactor\"  requirement  by  stating: \nThe  most  outrageous  behavior  by  a  private  party  seeking  to  secure  evidence \nagainst  a  defendant  does  not  make  that  evidence  inadmissible  under  the  Due \nProcess  Clause. \n10\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  11  of  15  PagelD  #:  282 \nId.  at  166.  This  rationale  is  based  on the  recognition that the  Due  Process  clause  and \nother  civil  rights  specifically  protect  citizens  from  being  deprived  of their  rights  by  “state \nactors.”  “Whether  a waiver  of the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  is  voluntary  depends  on \n\"the  absence  of police  overreaching,  not  on  'free  choice’  in  any  broader  sense  of the \nword.\"  Jd. at  157.  See  ie.  U.S.  y.  Rosario-Diaz,  202  F.3d 54,  69  (Ist  Cir.  P.R.  2000) \n  \n(“Although  Melendez-Garcia  herself testified that she felt  very scared and physically  ill, \nthere  was  no  evidence  whatsoever  of physical  coercion  or  intimidation,  nor was  there  any \nindication  of conduct  by  the  law  enforcement agents  that would amount  to psychological \ncoercion  or  intimidation”). \nAs  noted,  Connelly  has  been  applied to  cases  challenging  the  voluntariness  of \nconsent to  search  under the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  Jennings,  491  F.Supp.2d at  1078. \nAlthough the  voluntariness  standard  under  the  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  amendments  is \nslightly  different,  id.’,  a  party  challenging  the  validity  of a  consent to  search  based  on \n  \nundue  coercion  must  likewise  demonstrate  coercive  action  by the  governmental  agent \nrather than  subjective  perception  of coercion.  For  example,  in Jennings,  the  defendant \nhad  claimed  that  because  of his  mental  limitations  he  had  not  freely  and  voluntarily \nconsented  to  the  search  of his  personal  bag  by  U.S.  Postal  inspectors.  After  concluding \nthat  Connelly  applied  to  a  determination  of whether  a  consent to  search was  coerced,  the \nCourt held  that  “there  is  no  basis  for  finding  Jennings’  consent to  search  involuntary \n‘absent  any  evidence  of psychological  or  physical  coercion  on  the  part  of the  agents. \nId.  at  1080. \n  \n*  The  distinction is based on the  fact that while  a consent to  search must be voluntarily given, it need not be \nknowing and intelligent as required under the waiver of Miranda rights.  Jennings,  491 F.Supp.2d at  1079. \n1]\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  _  Filed  06/09/09  Page  12  of  15  PagelD  #:  283 \nThe  Jennings  Court  relied  upon  U.S.  vy.  Barbour,  70 F.3d 580,  585  (11th  Cir.  Fla. \n1995),  where  the  Eleventh  Circuit  rejected  the  defendant’s  claim  that  his  statements  to \nSecret  Service  agents  and  his  consent to  search,  both  executed  while  he  was  undergoing \npsychiatric  treatment  for  severe  depression,  was  involuntary.  Plaintiff claimed  that  given \nhis  severe  mental  depression  and  medicated  state,  the  Secret  Service  Agent's  promise  to \nprovide  him  help  in  obtaining  mental  health treatment was  coercive.  The  Eleventh \nCircuit,  however,  noted  the  absence  of “any  evidence  of psychological  or  physical \ncoercion  on the  part  of the  agents.”  Jd.  Therefore,  in  applying  Connelly,  the  Court  held \nthat there  was  no  basis  for  finding  that the  defendant’s  statements  and  consent to  search \nwere  involuntary.  Jd. \nConnelly was  also  applied  in  U.S.  v.  Amery,  2002  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  16974 \n(S.D.N.Y.  Sept.  9,  2002)  to  defeat  a  defendant’s  claim  that  he  was  unduly  coerced  in \nsigning  a  consent to  search.  In that  case,  the  defendant was  originally  from  Afghanistan. \nHe  claimed  that  he  signed  the  consent  form  because  of his  experience  in  Afghanistan  and \nhis  belief that  if he  failed  to  cooperate  he  would  be  held  in  custody  and  subjected  to  abuse \nby  the  FBI  agents.  The  Court  held,  however,  that his  subjective  beliefs  were  irrelevant \n“unless  there  is  an  allegation that  agents  of the  United  States  engaged  in  some  type  of \ncoercion.\"  Jd.  citing  U.S.  v.  Salameh,  152  F.3d 88,  117  (2d Cir.  1998).  “The  defendant \nhas  failed  to  allege  any  coercive  action  or  unreasonable  behavior  by  the  governmental \nagents  to  induce  him  to  waive  his  Miranda  rights  and  make  certain  statements,  or to \nconsent to  the  various  searches.  The  defendant's  limited  education,  coupled \nwith  experiences  in  Afghanistan  and  his  post-September  11th  fears  and  apprehensions, \nare  wholly  unrelated  to  the  agents’  conduct.”  Jd. \n12\n     \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  13  of  15  PagelD  #:  284 \nThis  was  also  the  conclusion  of the  Second  Circuit the  case  of Smith  v.  Tenn. \nDep't  of Safety,  850 F.2d 692  (6th  Cir.  Tenn.  1988)  (unpublished opinion).  The  plaintiff \nin that  case,  an  undercover  agent  for  Tennessee  Bureau  of Investigation,  brought  §  1983 \nclaim  against  defendants  for  alleged  violation  of his  due  process  rights.  The  investigating \nofficers  had  searched  plaintiff's  property  for  stolen  property  after  receiving  his  consent. \nThe  plaintiff,  however,  maintained  that the  consent was  coerced  by  the  circumstances \nsurrounding  the  investigating  officers’  request  for  consent  and  his  granting  the  same. \nHowever,  the  Court  held  that  “[t]he  only  alleged  coercive  policy  activity  was  the \n\"atmosphere\"  of the  search  ([that  is,  the  investigating  officers]  gained  entrance  to  the \nhouse  without  disclosing  the  official  nature  of their visit)  and  the  relationship  of the \nparties  (co-workers).”  Jd.  Plaintiff nevertheless  maintained that  he  felt  he  had  no  choice \nbut to  agree  because  of his  employment  at the  Bureau  of Investigation  and  his  belief that \nhe  could  lose  his job  if he  refused.  However,  in  recognizing  that the  plaintiff likewise \nadmitted  that  he  knew  he  could  refuse,  the  Court  held  that  his  “subjective  concern  over \njeopardizing  his job  does  not rise  to  the  level  of coercion,  compulsion,  or  force  resulting \nin  a  constitutional  violation.”  Jd. \nAs  these  cases  make  clear,  and  as  articulated  by  the  Fourth  Circuit,  “a  court's \nevaluation  of the  totality  of the  circumstances  is  based,  not  on the  perceptions  of the \nindividual  searched,  but  on the  coerciveness  of the  officer's  conduct  in  obtaining  the \n  \nconsent.  In  other words,  the  relevant  question  is  not whether the  person whose  consent  is \nsought perceived  coercion  but,  rather,  whether there  actually  was  coercion.”  U.S.  y. \nQuezada,  1991  U.S.  App.  LEXIS 22712  (4th  Cir.  1991) (unpublished per  curiam  opinion) \nciting  Connelly,  479  U.S.  at  163-67. \n13\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  31  Filed  06/09/09  Page  14  of  15  PagelD  #:  285 \nIn this  case,  it  is  undisputed  that the  officers  took  no  coercive  action to  convince \nthe  Coach to  agree  to  a  search  of the  students.  As  previously  noted  in  support  of \nDefendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  Coach  Marchand  testified  that  one  of \nofficers  asked  if the  Coach would  allow the  officers  to  also  conduct  a  search  and  the \nCoach  readily  agreed  believing  that  it was  best to  have  his  players  names  cleared.” \nMarchand  Tr.,  at 27-28.  In  fact,  according  to  Coach  Marchand,  the  police  officers  were \ncourteous  and  professional  “at  all  times”  and  repeatedly  told  the  bystanders  to  quiet \ndown.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 26,  27 and 32.  As  the  above  cases  make  clear,  absent  any \nevidence  of coercive  conduct by  the  officers  themselves,  plaintiffs’  reliance  on the \nalleged  pressure  imposed  by  the  “crowd”  is  irrelevant to  the  determination  of whether the \nconsent was  constitutional  firm  in that  it  was  voluntarily  given.  Thus,  for  all  the  reasons \noutlined  in  Defendants’  previously  filed  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  oral \narguments  made  at  hearing,  defendants  respectfully  request that  summary judgment  enter \nin  favor  of defendants. \nDefendants, \nBy  their  attorney, \n/s/ Mare DeSisto \n Marc  DeSisto  (# 2757) \nDESISTO  LAW \n211  Angell  Street \nP.O.

At issue was whether the Defendant \nCoventry Police officers had violated the civil rights of the Plaintiffs, members of the Central \nFalls High School Soccer Team, by singling out the team for a mass search at the Coventry High \nSchool on or about September 28, 2006.   \nThe Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint had asserted a failure-to-train claim against the \nTown and former Chief O’Rourke.  The Defendants’ original Motion did not address whether \nthis claim ought to be summarily disposed.  However, at the hearing of May 26, 2009, after \nclarifying whether Plaintiffs had indeed asserted such a claim, this Court ordered the Defendants \nto provide a supplemental memorandum on this aspect of Plaintiffs’ claim.  At that hearing, \nanother issue arose as to whether Coach Marchand’s alleged fear of the crowd’s actions created a \nquestion of fact relevant to the issue of whether Coach Marchand had validly consented to the \nsearch of the boys. \nDefendants filed their Supplemental Memorandum on or about June 9, 2009.  Plaintiffs \nnow file their Reply thereto. \n \n  1 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 290\nA.  THE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nON THEIR CLAIMS INVOLVING FAILURE TO PROVIDE \nAPPROPRIATE TRAINING.  \n \n \n  Plaintiffs brought a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 asserting that the Coventry Chief \nof Police and the Town of Coventry failed to provide adequate training to the Defendant police \nofficers who conducted the mass search.  To sustain a § 1983 claim for failure to provide \nadequate police training, the Plaintiffs must show that the Chief and Town showed “deliberate \nindifference” to the rights of the individuals with whom their underlings would be in contact.  \nCity of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1204, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).  The \nPlaintiffs must also show that the lack of adequate training actually caused the deprivation of \ntheir constitutional rights.  Id. at 391.  Defendants assert that the Plaintiffs’ failure-to-train claim \nshould be summarily disposed of because the Plaintiffs have not adduced evidence of any pattern \nof previous violations of constitutional rights similar to those sustained by the Plaintiffs.  They \nargue that the lack of such a pattern of previous violations renders it impossible for Plaintiffs to \nshow “deliberate indifference.”  This argument misstates the law.   \nThe First Circuit has specifically held that is no particular requirement that there be any \npattern of constitutional violations similar to those experienced by the Plaintiffs.  Young v. City \nof Providence, 404 F.3d 4, 28 (1st Cir. 2005); Swain v. Spinney, 117 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1997), \nciting Bd. of County Comm’rs v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 117 S.Ct. 1382, 1391, 137 L.Ed 2d. 626 \n(1997); Gray v. Bostic, 458 F.3d 1295, 1308-09 (11th Cir. 2006).  While evidence of such a \npattern is certainly helpful, there are instances in which the need for training is so obvious that \nsuch a pattern of similar incidents is not necessary to establish the requisite “deliberate \nindifference.”  Id.   Instead, the requisite “deliberate indifference” may be shown where: 1) the \npolicymaker(s) of the municipality knew to a moral certainty that its employees would confront a \n  2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 291\ngiven situation; 2) that the situation either presents the employee with a difficult choice of the \nsort that training or supervision will make less difficult or that there is a history of employees \nmishandling the situation; and 3) the wrong choice will frequently cause the deprivation of a \ncitizen’s constitutional rights.  Nicholson v. Scoppetta, 344 F.3d 154, 167 (2nd Cir. 2003).   \nEven without specific facts on the record, a reasonable person could easily perceive the \nmoral certainty that a rank-and-file officer might be faced with the issue of a school official’s \nauthority to consent to a search.  That situation would arise simply due to the fact that minors \nnecessarily spend a great deal of their time in the custody of school officials.  Under R.I.G.L. \n§ 16-19-1, all minors are statutorily required to attend school “. . . during all the days and hours \nthat the public schools are in session in the city or town in which the child resides.”  Minors who \ndisobey this statute may be found wayward.  R.I.G.L. § 16-19-6.  Likewise, their parents may be \ncriminally charged.  R.I.G.L. § 16-19-1(a).  The only exception to this statute is for those minors \naged sixteen through eighteen, whose parents have taken the extraordinary step of allowing their \nchildren drop out pursuant to procedures established under R.I.G.L. § 16-19-1(b).   \nBy legal necessity, then, all minors must spend a great deal of time in the custody of \npublic school officials, simply because the compulsory education statutes forbid them to be \nanywhere else during school hours.  The great amount of time that minors spend in the custody \nof school officials alone creates a readily foreseeable strong possibility that a police officer \nwould confront the issue of a school official’s authority to consent to search.  The possibility that \na minor may be drawn into some confrontation with the police while in school custody has only \nexpanded since the passage of our compulsory education statutes.  Police today do not go to the \npublic schools only when they are summoned to deal with a specific problem.  Today, the police \nare now present at many schools as a matter of course.  An ever-increasing number of districts \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 292\nnow retain “school resource officers” whose specific duty is to assist school officials in \nmaintaining order.1  By the time of this incident, Coventry had in fact joined the growing number \nof these districts retaining school resource officers.  (Ex. O, p. 11:20-13:23.) \nUnder these circumstances, it is patently obvious that officers might well be confronted \nwith the issue of whether a teacher could give “consent” to a police search of a student.  Simply \nput, the confluence of the compulsory education statutes and, more recently, the increased \nreliance upon police to maintain order on the public school campus, creates an extremely good \nchance of adversarial contacts between students and police while students are in the custody of \nschool officials.2   \nThe record evidence confirms that Coventry officers were frequently being drawn into \nsituations involving the searches of students at school – but with a complete lack of training on \nthe point of when a school official could “authorize” a search of a student.  (Ex. P, 29:14-30-5; \nEx. Q, 32:22-33:13.)  Most interestingly, at the time of the incident, Sergeant Richard Sturdahl, \nhad only recently left the School Resource Officer position after having made rank.  (Ex. O, \n11:20-13:23.)  Even he was unable provide any coherent definition of a school official’s \nauthority to search, and relied largely upon the antiquated in loco parentis concept.  (Ex. O, \n16:12-18:8.)  Nevertheless, Coventry officers’ testimony indicated that their duties frequently \ninvolved searches of Coventry students at schools on numerous occasions.  This duty was not \n                                                \n1 See Susan Black, Security and the SRO, Am. Sch.Board. J., June, 2009 at 30-31.  See also Tom \nPickerell, Schools and Police:  A Sometimes Uneasy Alliance, reprinted in School Law in \nReview, 2005, National School Boards Association (2005). \n2 Indeed, one of the cases cited by Defendants, that of Gray v. Bostic, 458 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. \n2006) describes a factual scenario which demonstrates how readily ordinary student misbehavior \nmay well result in police intervention these days.  That case describes a confrontation between a \ngym teacher and student about the student’s failure to participate in exercises.  Formerly, in most \ncircumstances such an incident would have ended in the principal’s office.  In Gray, however, an \noverzealous school resource officer insisted on intervening in this disciplinary matter over the \nprotests of the teacher, and handcuffed the student.   \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 293\nlimited to the School Resource Officer, but encompassed a number of other officers.  (Ex. P, \n29:14-30:5; Ex. R, 25:7-20.)  \nIt is also patently obvious that the failure to provide training on that legal point could lead \nto gross abrogations of students’ Fourth Amendment rights.  As we pointed out in our earlier \nMemorandum, if we hold that a teacher has the ability to authorize a student search by the police, \nthen we have eviscerated students’ Fourth Amendment protections against arbitrary searches by \ntheir teachers under New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 105 S.Ct. 733 (1985).  All that a teacher \nwould need to do to evade the “reasonable suspicion” standard promulgated under T.L.O. is to \ncall a police officer and give “permission” for that officer to search that student.  Giving school \nofficials the right to consent to student searches also works to remove student protection from \nunreasonable police searches once those students walked through the schoolhouse door.  If a \nschool official had the blanket authority to consent to a search, whether supported by any degree \nof reasonable suspicion or not, then all an overreaching police officer needs to do to evade the \nFourth Amendment is to wait until the child was in school, and then persuade a friendly school \nofficial to give “permission” to search a student.  For that reason, the rank-and-file officers were \nin clear need of instruction as to the limitations of school officials’ authority to consent to search.  \nThere is also a clear causal connection between the lack of training and the constitutional \nviolation visited upon the Plaintiffs.  Had the officers received the most rudimentary of training \nregarding the constraints upon a teacher’s right to search their students, then the officers would \neasily have recognized that they were making a mistake of constitutional proportions when \nrelying upon any purported “consent” from Coach Marchand.  As we pointed out in our earlier \nMemorandum, it was obvious that Coach Marchand lacked the requisite “reasonable suspicion” \nthat would justify a search of his students under T.L.O.  Id. at 341-42.  Without that “reasonable \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 294\nsuspicion,” he himself could not search the students without violating their Fourth Amendment \nrights.  Id.   After all, it goes without saying that Coach Marchand could not give permission to \ndo that which he himself was expressly forbidden to do. \nAs we have seen above, the Coventry Police officers appear to have been left utterly \nwithout any idea of the express limitations on Coach Marchand’s authority pursuant to \nestablished law.  Because of their apparent ignorance, it was almost inevitable that students \nwhom the Coventry Police would come into contact with on a near-daily basis would be placed \nat risk for violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.  Accordingly, the failure to provide \ntraining rose to the level of “deliberate indifference,” and caused the Plaintiffs’ injury.   \nB.  THE PRESSURE FROM THE CROWD DID AFFECT THE VALIDITY \nOF THE SEARCH. \n \n  Defendants also challenge the proposition that the pressure from the crowd ought to be \nconsidered as a factor in determining whether Coach Marchand’s purported “consent” should be \ndeemed truly voluntary and therefore valid.  In support of their argument to the contrary, the \nDefendants point to a string of cases which they believe stand for the proposition that only \ncoercion from the police officers can be considered.  Not only do the Defendants misread the \ncases, but they also overlook the fact that the Coventry police themselves acted in such a fashion \nas to contribute to that coercive atmosphere.  \n  The Defendants’ loudest lament is that the “coercion,” at least insofar as the crowd is \nconcerned, did not originate from the Coventry Police, at least before they arrived.  None of the \ncases to which Defendants cite positively state that the only relevant coercion is that which \ncomes from a police officer.  Instead, the legal standard requires that courts engage in “. . . an \nexamination of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the relevant transaction between \nlaw-enforcement authorities and the consenting parties.”  United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 37 \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 295\n(2008), citing United States v. Pérez –Montañez, 202 F.3d 434, 438 (1st Cir. 2000).  In other \nwords, it has never been said that matters outside of a police officer’s conduct could not have \nsome bearing upon the nature of the consent; one looks at all of the circumstances.  \n  It is true that a particular mental condition or susceptibility will not in and of itself \ninvalidate consent.  That was the underlying theme of the cases relied upon by the Defendants.  \nFor example, in Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157 (1986), the defendant had walked up to an \noff-duty officer who was still in uniform, and insisted upon discussing a murder that he had \ncommitted the year before.  Id. at 159.  It was only later that the police had any way of \ndiscovering that the defendant suffered from chronic schizophrenia, and that that mental \ncondition might well have affected his ability to make decisions to waive his legal rights.  Id. at \n161.  In that case, it was rightfully decided that the police officers had not acted in an \nunconstitutional fashion.  The officers of course had had nothing to do with any mental condition \nthat might affect the defendant’s capacity to decide to confess or remain silent, had no \nknowledge of that condition, and therefore could not be said to have coerced the defendant in \nany way.  Id. at 165.  See also United States v. Barbour, 70 F.3d 580, 585 (11th Cir. 1995) \n  Similarly, mere lack of intelligence has not been found to affect consent in most cases in \nthe case of United States v. Jennings, 491 F.Supp.2d 1072 (M.D. Ala. 2007), the defendant had \nargued that his mental limitations had rendered him unable to voluntarily consent to a search and \nwaive his Miranda rights.  However, there had been no evidence that would indicate that the law \nenforcement official could have or should have known of any limitation, much less that that \nofficial had taken advantage of that condition.  See id. at 1076.  A similar argument was made \nand rejected in United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 69 (1st Cir. 2000), where the \ndefendant argued that his low I.Q. obviated his consent (1st Cir. 2000). \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 8 of 10 PageID #: 296\n  United States v. Amery, 2002 WL 31027514 (S.D.N.Y.) dealt with a subjective fear of \npolice.  The defendant was an Afghani national who had experienced police torture while in his \nhome country, and had also experienced anti-Muslim sentiment in this country after the \nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks.  Id. at *1.  Understandably, these experiences would tend to make \none particularly fearful of refusing a request from a police officer.  There was no evidence that \nthe Amery officers knew of the defendant’s unique experiences and consequent susceptibility.  \nId. at *2.  That lack of knowledge by the officers, and the lack of any attempt to exploit that \nknowledge, weighed against finding the search to be non-consensual. \n  In all of the above cases, the challenge to the consent failed because the mental condition \nor susceptibility was such that the officer did not or could not know of.  However, none of the \ncases cited have foreclosed the possibility that some particular mental susceptibility cannot be \nweighed in the “totality of circumstances” analysis.  All leave open the possibility that there \ncould be some overreaching if the officer actively exploits a particular mental susceptibility to \ngain consent.  See especially Amery at *2.  There is sufficient evidence on the record to show that \nthe officers both knew of and actively exploited Coach Marchand’s fear of that crowd – even \ngoing to the point of aggravating it by keeping him in that situation.   \nAs was described at the depositions, at the time the Coventry Police arrived, the Central \nFalls bus was already blocked in by the mob and could not leave.  The Coventry Police similarly \nblocked in the bus with their vehicles.  (Ex. D, 31:15-32:6; Ex. H, 43:15-24.)  Coach Marchand \nexpressed fear of the crowd to the Coventry officers, and appealed to them for assistance in \nextricating him and his players from this dangerous situation, asking them:  “. . . what am I going \nto do, what are they going to do to us.”  (Ex. H, 27:23-24.)  The Coventry Police took no \neffective action to dissipate the crowd.  (Ex. H, 16:3-7, 27:5-9, 45:8-13.)  Instead, they chose that \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 9 of 10 PageID #: 297\nparticular moment to inform Coach Marchand that a search was going to be the solution to his \npredicament.  (Ex. H, 28:8-29:13; Ex. K, 44:1-6.) \n  Under these circumstances, a reasonable jury could find that the Coventry Police had \ntaken advantage of Coach Marchand’s expressed fear of the crowd.  The Coventry officers had \nessentially joined the crowd in its illegal detention of the team by blocking in the bus.  They also \nspecifically suggested to Coach Marchand that a search would be the only way in which he and \nhis team could resolve the matter and thus regain their freedom to move on. \n  Furthermore, the Coventry Police’s actions in joining in the illegal detention of the team \nbus should work to obviate any consent by Coach Marchand.  The detention of the team bus was \nplainly illegal.  The crowd itself of course had no legal authority to prevent the team from \nleaving.  The Coventry Police had no probable cause or even a reasonable suspicion that \nanybody on board that bus had engaged in any crime.  The Coventry Police therefore had no \nvalid reason to detain the team in any way; nevertheless, that is what they did when they blocked \nin the bus.  It is well-understood that an illegal detention is an inherently coercive situation, and \nthat any “consent” to a search given under those circumstances is therefore invalid.  See State v. \nCasas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1134 (R.I. 2006), citing United States v. Cellitti, 387 F.3d 618, 622 (7th \nCir. 2004).   \n  Under the evidence on record, the actions of the Coventry Police, then, combined \nexploitation of Coach Marchand’s fear of the crowd and an illegal detention.  For that reason, the \nDefendants should not be able to obtain summary judgment on the question of whether Coach \nMarchand’s consent was voluntary or coerced.  \n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 34    Filed 07/16/09   Page 10 of 10 PageID #: 298\nIV.

INTRODUCTION \nThe  Plaintiffs  in the  instant  case  are  members  of the  Central  Falls  High  School  boys’ \nsoccer team.  They  have  brought  suit  against the  Town  of Coventry  and  Coventry  police  officers \nstemming  from  an  incident that  occurred  after  their  interscholastic  high  school  game  against the \nCoventry  High  School  boys’  soccer team.  After  the  plaintiffs’  soccer  coach,  Robert  Marchand, \nhad  informed  the  officers  that  his  players  were  the  “prime  suspects”  and  that  he  had  searched \nthem  for  the  allegedly  stolen  contraband,  the  Coach  consented  to  the  officers  also  conducting  a \nsearch  of the  students.  Coach  Marchand  agreed  to  the  search  in  order to  keep  the  peace  and \nprove  the  team’s  innocence.  Plaintiffs  now  claim  that the  police  officers  violated  their  rights  by \nsearching  the  plaintiffs  and  that their  actions  were  racially  motivated. \nDefendants  move  for  summary judgment  and  submit that  not  only  did  Coach  Marchand’s \nconsent  satisfy  due  process  considerations  but that they  are  nevertheless  protected  by  the \ndoctrine  of qualified  immunity  from  the  instant  suit.  More  specifically,  a reasonable  officer \nwould  not  believe  that  relying  on the  coach’s  consent,  who  was  acting  in  /oco parentis  to  the \nplayers,  violated  plaintiffs’  clearly  established  right.  In  addition,  there  is  no  evidence  to  support \n1  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  4  of  31  PagelD  #:  93 \nthe  conclusion that the  officers  possessed  any  discriminatory  intent  or  animus.  Accordingly, \nsummary judgment  in  favor  of defendants  on  all  counts  should  enter. \nI.  STATEMENT  OF FACTS \nThe  facts  pertinent to  the  instant  motion  are  not  in  dispute.  On  September  28,  2006,  the \nCentral  Falls  High  School’s  men’s  soccer team  traveled  to  Coventry  High  School  for  a  soccer \ngame.  At  some  point,  some  of the  Central  Falls  players  entered  the  High  School,  with \npermission,  to  use  the  restrooms.  At the  end  of the  game,  members  of the  Coventry  football  team \naccused  one  of the  plaintiffs  of stealing  electronic  equipment  (ipod  and  cell  phone)  from  the \nlocker  room  located  near the  restrooms.  These  football  players  first  approached  the  Central  Falls \nsoccer  coach,  Robert  Marchand,  as  the  coach was  leaving  the  field.  Deposition  of Robert \nMarchand,  (January  6,  2009),  at  18-19  (hereinafter  “Marchand  Tr.”)  (Attached Exhibit A).  The \nplaintiffs  were  in the  parking  lot  getting  their  bus  when  the  Coventry  students  approached  the \ncoach  on the  field.  Coach  Marchand  responded  by  telling  the  Coventry  players  “let’s  get to  the \nbottom  of this”  and  leading  them  to  the  Central  Falls  bus.  Jd.  at  19.  Coach  Marchand  made  the \nCovetnry  players  stop  a  short  distance  from  the  bus  and  then,  with the  help  of his  assistant  coach, \nwent  on the  bus  and  searched  the  plaintiffs’  equipment.  Jd.  at 2/-22.  During  his  deposition, \nCoach  Marchand  explained  that  he  had  been  present  during  a prior  incident  between  different \nrivaling  schools  in  a  similar  circumstance  where  the  students  got  out  of control  resulting  in  a \n“brawl”.  Jd.  at  13-15.  Coach  Marchand  thus  thought  it was  best  and  safer  for  all  involved  to  try \nto  quickly  diffuse  the  situation  by  searching  his  players  himself.  Jd. \nAfter  searching  all  the  players’  bags,  Coach  Marchand  determined  that  plaintiffs  were  not \ninvolved  in the  alleged  theft.  When  Coach  Marchand  exited  the  bus  to  advise  the  Coventry \n  \n'  The Defendants  are the  four Coventry Police  Department officers who responded to the incident (Kevin P.  Harris, \n2  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  5  of  31  PagelD  #:  94 \nstudents  that  he  had  found  nothing,  he  discovered  that the  Coventry  Athletic  Director  had  arrived \nand  that the  group  of less  than  20  students  had  grown.  Coach  Marchand  spoke  directly  with the \nAthletic  Director  and  advised  him  that  he  had  searched  the  players  and  was  satisfied  that they \nwere  not  involved  in the  theft.  Jd. at  15  &  23.  Coach  Marchand  offered  to  let the  Coventry \nAthletic  Director  search the  players  himself but the  AD  immediately  declined.  Jd.  at 24. \nAccording  to  Coach  Marchand,  by  this  time  the  group  of spectators  surrounding  the  bus  had \ngrown to  approximately  50  people  (students  and  adults)  with the  spectators  making  various \ncomments  about  not trusting  the  coach  and  insisting  that the  plaintiffs  were  involved  in the  theft. \nId.  at 24. \nJust  as  Coach  Marchand  was  relaying  the  results  of his  search to  Coventry’s  AD,  the \nCoventry  police  pulled  into  the  parking  lot with  lights  on.  The  Coventry  Police  Department  had \nreceived  two  (2)  calls  for  a  disturbance  and  a  possible  fight  in the  parking  lot  between the  two \nteams.  Four  (4)  officers  quickly  responded,  the  Defendants  Kevin  P.  Harris,  Kevin  Kennedy, \nDavid Nelson,  and  Stephen  A.  Michailides.  Upon the  officers’  arrival,  the  Coventry’s  AD  and \nCoach  Marchand  quickly  brought them  up  to  speed  on what was  going  on  and  assured  them  that \nthere  was  not  a  fight,  yet.  Coach  Marchand,  in  particular,  informed  the  officers  that there  had \nbeen  a theft  in the  school  and  that his  players,  the  plaintiffs,  were  the  “prime  suspects.” \nMarchand  Tr.,  at 27.  While  the  officers  were  speaking  with  Coach  Marchand,  a  number  of \nspectators  kept yelling  things  at the  Coach  and  plaintiffs  who  were  still  on the  bus.  The  officers \nrepeatedly  told  the  spectators  to  quiet  down  and  that the  officers  would  take  care  of things.  Jd.  at \n27. \n  \nKevin Kennedy,  David Nelson,  and  Stephen A.  Michailides), the  Treasurer of the  Town (Warren West),  former \nChief of Police  for the  Town of Coventry,  Brian O’Rourke  and current Chief of Police,Ronald E.  DaSilva. \n3  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page 6  of  31  PagelD  #:  95 \nAccording  to  Coach  Marchand,  after  he  informed  the  officers  that the  plaintiffs  were  the \nprime  suspects  but that he  conducted  a  search  and  was  satisfied  that they  were  not  involved, \nthere  was  “a pregnant  pause”  where  the  officers  were  obviously  trying  to  figure  out what to  do \nnext.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 27.  One  of officers  then  asked  if the  Coach would  allow the  officers  to \nalso  conduct  a  search.  Coach  Marchand  readily  agreed  believing  that  1t was  best to  have  his \nplayers  names  cleared  and  to  leave  the  area  for the  safety  of the  plaintiffs.”  Jd. at 28.  Under \nquestioning  by  plaintiffs’  attorney,  Coach  Marchand  later testified  that  although  he  probably \nwould  not  have  allowed  the  officers  to  search  his  students  if they  were  alone,  given the \nescalating  situation with the  spectators  and  his  obligation to  protect the  plaintiffs,  he  thought  it \nwould  be  best  “take  the  high  road”  and  allow the  officers  to  search them  in  order to  clear their \nnames.  Id.  at 28  &  44-45.  Although  plaintiffs’  attorney  asked  the  Coach  if he  felt  he  was  under \n“duress”  in  giving  this  consent,  the  Coach  explained  that the  duress  was  the  result  of the  crowd \nsurrounding  the  bus  and  the  uncertainty  of how they  would  react.  Jd.  at  44-45.  Sergeant \nMichailides  testified  that  if the  coach  had  not  consented  or  if the  students  had  protested,  they \nwould  not  have  conducted  the  search.  Deposition  of Stephen  Michailides  (December  18,  2008), \nat  47  (hereinafter  “ Michailides  Tr.”’). \nCoach  Marchand  then  instructed  his  players  to  allow the  officers  to  look through their \nbags.  For  officer  safety,  the  officers  had  the  players  step  outside  the  bus  and  conducted  a  search \nby  looking  into  their  respective  bags  and  having  the  students  turn  out their  pockets.  Jd. at 48-49. \nNone  of the  plaintiffs  were  frisked  or  otherwise  touched  during  the  search.  The  officers \ncompleted  their  search  and  did  not  find  the  missing  items.  The  officers  then  advised  the  Coach \n  \n*  Although not material  for purposes  of the instant motion, the  officers testified that they did not ask for consent to \nsearch.  Rather,  it was  Coach Marchand who  offered to  allow the  officers to  search the  students.

Although the  officers  heard the  Coventry  spectators  yelling  accusations  of \ntheft  at the  Central  Falls  players,  the  officers  themselves  never  heard  any  racial  slurs  against the \nplaintiffs.  Michailides  Tr.,  at  41;  Deposition  of David Nelson  (December  17,  2008),  at  45. \nPlaintiffs  do  not  allege  that the  defendant  officers  used  racial  or  ethnic  slurs  against the  students. \nIn  fact,  according  to  Coach  Marchand  the  officers  were  courteous  and  professional  “at  all  times” \nand  repeatedly  told  the  bystanders  to  quiet  down.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 26,  27 and 32. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nUnder the  Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure,  summary judgment  is  appropriate  when  \"the \npleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file,  together  with the \naffidavits,  if any,  show that there  is  no  genuine  issue  as  to  any  material  fact  and  that the  moving \nparty  is  entitled  to judgment  as  a matter  of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P.  56(c).  It  is  axiomatic  that this \nCourt  must view the  evidence  in the  light  most  favorable  to  the  nonmoving  party.  Morrissey  vy. \nBoston  Five  Cents  Savings Bank,  F.S.B.,  54 F.3d 27,  31  (Ist  Cir.  1995).  However,  the \nnonmoving  party  \"may  not  rest  upon the  mere  allegations  or  denials  of [its]  pleadings,  but . .  . \nmust  set  forth the  specific  facts  showing  that there  is  a  genuine  issue  for trial.\"  Fed. R.Civ.P. \n56(e).  \"A  fact  is  ‘material’  if it  potentially  could  affect the  suit's  outcome.  An  issue  concerning \nsuch  a  fact  1s  'genuine'  if a reasonable  fact  finder,  examining  the  evidence  and  drawing  all \nreasonable  inferences  helpful  to  the  party  resisting  summary judgment,  could  resolve  the  dispute \n5  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  8  of  31  PagelD  #:  97 \nin that party's  favor.\"  Cortes-Iriszarry  v.  Corporacion  Insular DeSeguros,  111  F.3d 184,  187 \n(1st  Cir.  1997)  (citations  omitted). \nAccordingly,  the  purpose  of summary judgment  is  to  permit the  court  \"to  pierce  the \nboilerplate  of the  pleadings  and  assay  the  parties’  proof in  order to  determine  whether  trial  is \nactually  required\"  on the  claims  being  examined.  Wynne  v.  Tufts  Univ.  School  of Medicine,  976 \nF.2d  791,  793-94  (1st  Cir.  1992)  cert.  denied 113  S.Ct.  1845  (1993).  The  mandates  of Rule \n56(c)  requires  entry  of summary judgment  \"upon  motion  against  a party  who  fails  to  make  a \nshowing  sufficient to  establish the  existence  of an  element  essential  to  that  party's  case,  and  on \nwhich the  party  will  bear  the  burden  of proof at trial.\"  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317, \n322  (1986). \n“Summary judgment procedure  is  properly  regarded  not  as  a  disfavored  procedural \nshortcut,  but  rather  as  an  integral  part  of the  Federal  Rules  as  a whole,  which  are  designed  ‘to \nsecure  the just,  speedy  and  inexpensive  determination  of every  action.’”  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett, \n477  U.S.  317,  322,  106 S.  Ct.  2548,  2552  (1986)).  Pursuant to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(e): \n[W |hen  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  is  made  and  supported  as  provided  in \nthis  rule,  an  adverse  party  may  not  rest  upon  the  mere  allegations  or  denials  of the \nadverse  _party’s  pleading,  but  the  adverse  party’s  response,  by  affidavits  or  as \n otherwise  pro vided  in  this  rule,  must  set  forth  specific  facts  showing  that  there  is \ngenuine  issue  for  trial.  If  the  adverse  party  does  not  so  respond,  summary \njudgment,  if  appropriate,  shall  be  entered  against  the  adverse  party.  (Emphasis \nadded). \nBased  upon the  foregoing,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court  observed  that the  above  two \nsentences  of Rule  56  (e)  were  added  “to  disapprove  a  line  of cases  allowing  a  party  opposing \nsummary judgment to  resist  a properly  made  motion  by  reference  only  to  its  pleadings.”  Celotex \nCorp,  477  U.S.  at  3254,  106 S.Ct.  at 2554.  “|T]he  plaintiff must present  affirmative  evidence  in \n6  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  9  of  31  PagelD  #:  98 \norder  to  defeat  a  properly  supported  motion  for  summary judgment.” Anderson  vy.  Liberty Lobby, \n  \nInc.,  477  U.S.  242,  256,  106 S.  Ct.  2505,  2514  (1986). \n“|T]here  is  no  issue  for  trial  unless  there  is  sufficient  evidence  favoring  the  nonmoving \nparty  for  a jury  to  return  a verdict  for  that  party.” Jd. At 250,  106 S.Ct.  at 2511.  “If the  evidence \nis  merely  colorable,  or  is  not  significantly  probative,  summary judgment  may  be  granted.” Jd.  at \n250-51,  106 S.  Ct.  at 2511.  As  the  Court  recognized: \n[nJor  are judges  any  longer  required  to  submit  a  question  to  a jury  merely  because \nsome  evidence  has  been  introduced  by  the  party  having  the  burden  of  proof, \nunless  the  evidence  be  of such  character  that  it  would  warrant the jury  in  finding  a \nverdict  in  favor  of that  party.  Formerly  it  was  held  that  if there  was  what  is  called \na  scintilla  of evidence  in  support  of a  case  the  judge  was  bound  to  leave  it  to  the \n  \njury,  but  recent  decisions  of  high  authority  have  established  a  more  reasonable \nrule,  that  in  every  case,  before  the  evidence  is  left  to  the  jury,  there  is  a \npreliminary  question  for  the  judge,  not  whether  there  is  literally  no  evidence,  but \nwhether  there  is  any  upon  which  a jury  could  properly  proceed  to  find  a  verdict \nfor  the  party  producing  it,  upon  whom  the  onus  of proof  is  imposed.  Jd.  at  251, \n106 S.Ct.  at 2511  (emphasis  in  original). \nAccordingly,  “[t]he  mere  existence  of a  scintilla  of evidence  in  support  of the  plaintiff's  position \nwill  be  insufficient;  there  must be  evidence  on which the jury  could  reasonably  find  for the \nplaintiff.” Jd.  at 252,  106 S.Ct.  at 2512. \nIV.  ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs  have  brought  a plethora  of state  and  federal  claims  against the  defendants \nincluding  $  /983  claims  for  the  alleged  violation  of plaintiffs’  due  process  and  equal  protection \nrights.  Plaintiffs  have  also  brought  state  law  claims  for  invasion  of privacy  and  claims  under \nR.I.’s  Racial  Profiling  Act,  R..G.L.  §  3/-2/.2  and  the  State’s  statute  against  ethnic  intimidation, \nRIG.L.  §  9-1-35. \nDefendants  submit that the  defendants  are  entitled  to  summary judgment  on  plaintiffs’ \nclaims  not  only  because  the  undisputed  facts  fail  to  support the  finding  of a  constitutional \n7  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  10  of  31  PagelD  #:  99 \ndeprivation  but  also  because  they  enjoy  qualified  immunity  from  both the  federal  and  state  law \nclaims. \nA,  It was  reasonable for  the  officers  to  rely  upon  Coach  Marchand’s  Consent  to \nsearch plaintiffs \nDefendants  submit that  summary judgment  should  enter  in the  first  instance  because  the \nundisputed  facts  fail  to  support  a  finding  that they  violated  plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  against \nunreasonable  search  or  seizure.  As  the  Court  1s  aware,  under  Fourth  Amendment jurisprudence, \nthere  is  a  general  proscription  against warrantless  searches.  U.S.  Const.  amend.  IV.’  However, \n\"one  of the  specifically  established  exceptions  to  the  [Fourth  Amendment]  requirements  of both \na warrant  and  probable  cause  is  a  search that  is  conducted  pursuant to  consent.\"  Schneckloth  v. \nBustamonte,  412  U.S.  218,  219  (1973);  U.S.  v.  Vilches-Navarrete,  523  F.3d 1,  15  (1st  Cir.  2008). \n  \nIn this  case,  there  1s  no  dispute  that when the  officers  arrived  on the  scene,  plaintiffs’ \ncoach  informed  them  that  his  players  were  the  “prime  suspects”  in the  theft  and  that the  coach \nhad  searched  the  players  but  did  not  find  the  stolen  items.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 27.  The  coach  also \nunequivocally  testified  that  he  readily  agreed  to  the  officer’s  request that they  be  allowed  to \nsearch the  plaintiffs  themselves  because  he  thought  it was  the  best thing  to  do  — to  take  the  “high \nroad”  and  clear  their  names.  Jd.  at 28.  Coach  Marchand  was  also  complimentary  of the  officers’ \nprofessionalism  and  does  not  allege  that the  officers  elicited  this  consent  as  a result  of threat  or \nduress.*  The  only  outstanding  question therefore  is  whether the  coach  had  authority  to  consent \non  behalf of the  plaintiffs.  Defendants  submit that  he  did  and,  in  any  event  because  it  is  not \n  \n>  The  Fourth Amendment specifically provides: \n“The right of the people to be  secure in their persons, houses, papers,  and effects,  against unreasonable \nsearches  and seizures,  shall not be violated,  and no Warrants  shall issue, but upon probable  cause, \nsupported by Oath or affirmation,  and particularly  describing the place to be  searched,  and the persons  or \nthings to be  seized.”  U.S.  Const.  amend.  IV \n*  The  “duress”  elicited from plaintiffs’  attorney during  Coach Marchand’s  deposition was  as a  result of the  crowd of \nspectators not anything the  officers  said or did.  Marchand Tr.,  at 44-45. \n8  of  19\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  11  of  31  PagelD  #:  100 \nclearly  established  that  he  lacked  such  authority,  it was  thus  reasonable  for the  officers  to  believe \nthat the  coach,  acting  “in  loco  parentis”  for the  student  players  had  authority  to  consent  on their \nbehalf. \n“There  can  be  no  Fourth  Amendment violation  if a  police  officer  reasonably  believed \nthat  a third  party  had  authority  to  consent.”  U.S.  v.  McCurdy,  480  F.  Supp.  2d 380,  385-86  (D. \nMe.  2007).  In this  case,  the  plaintiffs  were  students  of Central  Falls  High  School  and  were \nparticipating  in  a  school  sponsored  athletic  event.  Under  settled jurisprudence,  school  officials \nare  said  to  act  in  loco parentis  to  their  students.  \"Traditionally  at  common  law,  and  still  today, \nunemancipated  minors  lack  some  of the  most  fundamental  rights  of self-determination  ...  .  They \nare  subject...  .  to  the  control  of their  parents  or  guardians.  When  parents  place  minor  children  in \nprivate  schools  for  their  education,  the  teachers  and  administrators  of those  schools  stand  in  loco \nparentis  over  the  children  entrusted  to  them.\"  Morse  v.  Frederick,  55]  U.S.  393  (U.S.  2007) \nquoting  Vernonia  Sch.  Dist.  47J vy.  Acton,  515  U.S.  646,  654,  655,  115  S.  Ct.  2386,  132  L.  Ed.  2d \n564  (1995)  (citation  omitted)). \nActing  in  loco parentis,  Coach  Marchand  thus  had  authority  to  consent  on  behalf of the \nstudents.  Vernonia  Sch.  Dist.  47J,  515  U.S.  at  654.  In  fact,  in this  case,  Coach  Marchand \n  \nhimself recognized  his  role  in  loco parentis  by  indicating  repeatedly  during  his  deposition that \nhis  main  concern  during  this  entire  incident was  the  safety  of his  players.  Marchand  Tr.,  at  13- \n15,  28.  He  decided  on  a  course  of action that  he  thought was  best  for  his  players.  Accordingly, \ndefendants  submit that  not  only  did  the  coach  have  authority  to  grant permission to  search the \nstudents,  it was  reasonable  for the  officers  to  believe  that the  coach  had  the  authority  to  consent. \nMcCurdy,  480 F.  Supp.  2d at  385-86.  As  such,  plaintiffs’  §  1983  claim  for the  alleged  violation \n9  of  19\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  12  of  31  PagelD  #:  101 \nof plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  rights  must  fail  and  summary judgment  in  favor  of defendants \nshould  enter. \nB.  The  Doctrine  of Qualified Immunity Protects Defendants from  the  Instant Suit \nDefendants  further  submit that  even  if it  is  determined  that the  coach  did  not  have \nauthority  to  consent to  the  search  of his  student,  the  defendants  are  nevertheless  are  entitled  to \nqualified  immunity  from  the  instant  suit.  The  doctrine  of qualified  immunity  emanates  from  the \nSupreme  Court's  pronouncements  in Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald 457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982),  where  the \n  \nCourt  held  that  \"government  officials  performing  discretionary  functions  generally  are  shielded \nfrom  liability  for  civil  damages  insofar  as  their  conduct  does  not violate  clearly  established \nstatutory  or  constitutional  rights  of which  a reasonable  person  would  have  known.\"  Harlow  vy. \nFitzgerald 457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982).  The  purpose  behind  granting  officials  such  immunity is  to \nallow them  to  perform  their  duties  and  act  in  areas  where  clearly  established  rights  are  not \nimplicated  \"with  independence  and  without  fear  of consequence.\"  Jd. at  819.  Officials, \ntherefore,  enjoy  \"an  immunity  from  suit rather than  a mere  defense  to  liability  [which] .  .  .  is \neffectively  lost  if a  case  is  erroneously  permitted  to  go  to  trial.\"  Mitchell  v.  Forsyth,  472  U.S. \nS11,  526  (1985). \nThe  Court  applies  a  good  faith test that  allows  questions  of qualified  immunity  to  be \ndecided  as  a  matter  of law  in  appropriate  cases.  Malachowski  v.  City  of Keene,  787 F.2d  704, \n  \n714  (Ist  Cir.  1986).  Applying  Saucier  v.  Katz,  533  U.S.  194,  201  (2001),  the  First  Circuit  has \ntraditionally  instructed  that  qualified  immunity  claims  are  evaluated  under  a three-part test: \n“First,  whether,  [t]aken  in  the  light most  favorable  to  the  party  asserting  the  injury, . .  . \nthe  facts  .  .  .  show the  [defendant's]  conduct violated  a  constitutional  right.  If so,  the \nsecond  question  is  whether  that  constitutional  right was  clearly  established  at the  time  of \nthe  ..  .  violation.  The  third  question  1s  whether  a  reasonable  [defendant],  similarly \nsituated,  would  understand  that the  challenged  conduct violated  the  clearly  established \nright  at  issue.” \n10  of  19\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  13  of  31  PagelD  #:  102 \nBorges  Colon  y.  Roman-Abreu,  438 F.3d 1,  18-19  (1st  Cir.  2006)  (internal  citations  and \n  \nquotations  omitted).  However,  the  Supreme  Court  has  recently  amended  this  test  and  found  that \nCourts  “should  exercise  their  sound  discretion  in  deciding  which  of the  two  prongs  of the \nqualified  immunity  analysis  [as  outlined  in Saucier]  should  be  addressed  first  in  light  of the \ncircumstances  in the  particular  case  at  hand.”  Pearson  v.  Callahan,  129  S.Ct.  808,  ,  2009 \n  \n  \nU.S.  LEXTS 591,  **22  (2009)  modifying Saucier  y.  Katz,  533  U.S.  194  (2001)  (courts  do  not need \nto  abide  by  the  strict  two-step  sequence for resolving government  officials’  qualified immunity \nclaims).  Thus,  in  addressing  defendants’  claim  of qualified  immunity,  the  Court  does  not  need  to \nfirst  determine  whether  a  constitutional  right  has  been violated. \nNevertheless,  in  general,  this  test  boils  down to  viewing  the  official's  actions  from  an \nobjectively  reasonable  standpoint.  The  decisive  question  becomes  whether  another  police \nofficer,  standing  in the  shoes  of these  defendants,  would  have  concluded  that their  actions \nviolated  a  clearly  established  statutory  or  constitutional  right.  See Ricci  vy.  Urso,  974 F.2d 5,  7 \n(Ist  Cir.  1992).  When  addressing  claims  for  qualified  immunity  on  summary judgment  motions, \nthe  Court  must  grant  summary judgment  if the  plaintiff fails  to  generate  a trialworthy  issue  by \nundermining  the  evidence  supporting  the  defendant's  objectively  reasonable  belief that  his \nactions  were  lawful.  Dean  v.  Worcester,  924 F.2d 364,  367  (Ist  Cir.  1991). \nDefendants  submit that the  instant  case  is  ripe  for  the  grant  of qualified  immunity.  As \nmore  fully  outlined  above,  there  is  ample  case  law to  support the  conclusion that the  coach was \nacting  in  loco parentis  for the  students.  This  is  because  a  parent  \"may  .  .  .  delegate  part  of his \nparental  authority,  during  his  life,  to  the  tutor  or  schoolmaster  of his  child;  who  is  then  in  loco \nparentis,  and  has  such  a  portion  of the  power  of the  parent  committed  to  his  charge,  viz.  that  of \nrestraint  and  correction,  as  may  be  necessary  to  answer the  purposes  for which  he  is  employed.\" \n11  of  19\n       \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  14  of  31  PagelD  #:  103 \nVernonia  Sch.  Dist.  47J,  515  U.S.  at  655  (quoting  I  William  Blackstone,  Blackstone's \n  \nCommentaries  on  the  Laws  of England 441  (1769))  (emphasis  added).  Cf.  Hampton  y.  Oktibbeha \nCounty Sheriff Dep't,  480 F.3d 358,  362  (Sth  Cir.  Miss.  2007)  (\"Teachers  and school \n  \nadministrators,  it  is  said,  act  in  loco parentis  loco parentis  in  their dealings  with  students  .. .  .  \" \nThe  Director  “was  considered the youth's  custodian  during  the  relevant  time period”  and thus \nwas justified in  seeking  to  see  the  warrant  before  relinquishing  the  child to  the  officer’s  custody). \nAs  such,  even  if it  is  determined  that the  coach  lacked  the  authority  to  consent to  the  search,  it \nwas  not  clearly  established  that  he  could  not  consent  on  behalf of the  players. \nA  \"reasonable,  although  mistaken,  conclusion  about the  lawfulness  of one's  conduct  does \nnot  subject  a  government  official  to  personal  liability.\".  Cookish  v.  Powell,  945  F.2d 441,  443 \n(Ist  Cir.  1991).  Thus,  \"[q]Jualified  immunity  may  exist  even though  in  hindsight  a  court might \ndetermine  that the  action  of the  official  violated  the  constitution.\"  B erthiaume  y.  Caron,  142 \nF.3d  12,  15  (1st  Cir.  1998)  citing Harlow,  457  U.S.  at  814-15.  The  First  Circuit  has  observed \nthat the  \"qualified  immunity  standard  'gives  ample  room  for  mistaken judgments'  by  protecting’ \nall  but the  plainly  incompetent  or  those  who  knowingly  violate  the  law.\"  Rivera  v.  Murphy,  979 \nF.2d 259,  263  (Ist  Cir.  1992)  quoting Hunter  y.  Bryant,  502  U.S.  224,  229  (1991). \nIn the  instant  case,  the  officers  clearly  do  not  fall  within the  category  of being  “plainly \nincompetent  or  knowingly  violating  the  law.”  It  is  simply  not  “clearly  established”  that  a  coach \ndoes  not  possess  authority  to  consent  on  behalf of his  student  players.  In  fact,  in this  case,  the \ncoach  himself believed  he  had  the  authority  and  particularly  felt  he  was  making  the  right \ndecision  given the  unruly  crowd  to  quickly  clear  his  players  of suspicion.  Simply  put,  a \nreasonable  officer  in the  place  of these  officers  would  not have  believed  that their  actions \ninfringed  upon  plaintiffs’  clearly  established  rights.  As  such,  the  defendants  are  entitled  to \n12  of  19\n     \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  15  of  31  PagelD  #:  104 \nsummary judgment. \nC.  The  Coach's  consent  likewise  defeats Plaintiffs’  state  law  claim for Invasion  of \nPrivacy \nIn  Count  4  plaintiffs  also  seek to  maintain  a  state  law  claim  for  invasion  of privacy  under \nRIG.L.  $  9-1-28.1.  Defendants  submit that the  defeat  of plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claims \nlikewise  results  in the  defeat  of plaintiffs’  invasion  of privacy  claim.  As  held  by  this  Court,  $  9- \n1-28.1  “confers  a  cause  of action  only  for  unreasonable  invasions  of privacy  and  does  not  impose \nliability  for  constitutionally  permissible  searches  by  government  officials.”  Brousseau  vy.  Town \nof  Westerly, 11  F.Supp.  2d 177  (D.R.I.  1998)  (Torres,  J.).  Because  the  search  of the  students  was \nsupported  by  the  Coach’s  consent,  the  search was  constitutionally  firm  and  thus  plaintiffs’  claim \nfor  invasion  of privacy  must  likewise  fail. \nIn  addition,  even  if the  Court were  to  conclude  that there  is  insufficient  basis  to  support  a \nfinding  that the  officers  conducted  a  constitutionally  permissible  search,  similar  to  the  qualified \nimmunity  granted  to  the  officers  from  the  Fourth  Amendment  claim,  the  defendants  are  likewise \nentitled  to  qualified  immunity  from  plaintiffs  invasion  of privacy  claim.  See Hatch,  311  F.3d \n83,  90  (1°  Cir.  2002)  citing Pontbriand v.  Sundlun,  699 A.2d 856,  867  (RI.  1997)  and Ensey v. \nCulhane,  727  A.2d 687,  690  (RI.  1999).  Although the  Rhode  Island  Supreme  Court  has  never \nspecifically  afforded  officials  qualified  immunity  to  protect  against  state  law  claims,  as  noted  by \nthe  First  Circuit,  “Pontbriand and Ensey reflect Rhode  Island’s  recognition  of a  qualified \nimmunity  defense  under  state  law  analogous  to  the  federal  doctrine  established  by  the  United \nStates  Supreme  Court  in Harlow,  457  U.S.  at  818,  cited  with  approval  in  both  Rhode  Island \n  \ndecisions,  and  routinely  applied  in  §  1983  cases.”  Hatch,  311  F.3d at  90. \nThus,  defendants  submit that  it  is  abundantly  clear  that the  qualified  immunity  defense \nprotects  the  defendants  from  plaintiffs  state  law  claims just  as  it  does  from  plaintiff's  federal \n13  of  19\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  16  of  31  PagelD  #:  105 \nconstitutional  claims.  More  precisely,  without  using  the  benefit  of twenty/twenty  hindsight, \nBerthiaume  y.  Caron,  142  F.3d 12,  15  (1st  Cir.  1998),  the  officers’  action  are  viewed  from  an \n  \nobjective  standpoint,  in  light  of the  information  available  to  the  officers  and  with  recognition that \nofficers  must  make  quick  decisions  in the  heat  of stressful  situations.  In this  case,  a  reasonable \nofficer would  not  believe  that  receiving  the  consent  of the  Coach to  search the  players  violated \nplaintiffs’  constitutional  rights  or  was  an  invasion  of their  privacy.  Accordingly,  summary \njudgment  on  Count  4  should  also  enter  in  favor  of defendants. \nD.  The  Undisputed Facts Fail  To  Support Finding  That  Officers  Violated Plaintiffs’ \nEqual Protection  Rights \nIn  Count  2,  plaintiffs  seek to  recover  pursuant to  §  /983  for  the  alleged  denial  of \nplaintiffs’  right to  equal  protection.  Plaintiffs  premise  their  equal  protection  claim  on the \naccusation that the  police  officers  treated  them  differently  because  of their  race.  However,  in \nmaking  this  allegation,  plaintiffs  can  point to  nothing  other than the  difference  in their  race,  to \nsupport the  contention that the  officers  possessed  such  discriminatory  animus.  As  such, \nsummary judgment  in  favor  of defendants  should  enter. \nBy  way  of background,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment \nprovides,  in  part,  that  \"no  State  shall  make  or  enforce  any  law which  shall  ...  deny  to  any  person \nwithin  its jurisdiction the  equal  protection  of the  laws.\"  U.S.  Const.  amend.  XIV.  Plaintiffs \nessentially  maintain that the  officers  engaged  in  racial  profiling  in their  decisions  to  request \npermission  to  search the  plaintiffs.  In  order to  succeed  on  such  a  claim,  plaintiffs  “must present \nevidence  that  [they  were]  treated  differently  from  similarly  situated  white  [individuals]  and  the \naction taken  against  him  was  motivated,  at  least  in  part,  by  his  race.”  Flowers  y.  Fiore,  239 \nF. Supp.2d 173,  178  (D.R.I.  2003).  See  also  Reese  y.  Jefferson  School District No.  14J,  208 F.3d \n  \n736,  740  (9\"  Cir.  2000)(in  order  to  succeed on  claim,  litigant must prove  that  the police  acted in \n14  of  19\n  \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  17  of  31  PagelD  #:  106 \na  discriminatory manner and that  the  discrimination  was  intentional).  This  has  been  broken \ndown  into  two  inquiries:  (1)  whether  the  appellant was  treated  differently  than  others  similarly \nsituated,  and  (2)  whether  such  a  difference  was  based  on  an  impermissible  consideration,  such  as \nrace.  Macone  v.  Town  of Wakefield,  277 F.3d 1,  10  (1\"  Cir.  2002)(citations  omitted). \n  \nIn the  instant  case,  plaintiff fails  to  satisfy  either  element.  In the  first  instance,  there  is  no \nbasis  to  support the  allegation that  plaintiffs  were  treated  differently  than  similarly  situated \nindividuals.  Regardless  of plaintiffs’  race,  the  officers  arrived  in response  to  a  call  that  students \nwere  fighting.  When the  officers  arrived,  the  students  were  not  fighting  but tensions  were  clearly \nrunning  high with  approximately  50  spectators  forming  a  semi-circle  around  the  bus  and yelling \nthings  at the  coach  and  AD.  The  first  person to  speak to  the  officers  was  the  plaintiffs’  coach \nwho  informed  the  officers  that the  plaintiffs,  his  own  players,  were  the  “prime  suspects.” \nMarchand  Tr.,  at 27.  Coach  Marchand  also  informed  the  officers  that  he  had  searched  the \nplaintiffs’  belongings  and  did  not  find  the  stolen  items  and  had  been just  offering  to  let the \nCoventry  AD  conduct the  search.  In  response,  the  officers  allegedly  requested  permission  for \nthem  to  search these  students.  There  is  nothing  to  suggest that the  officers  would  not  have  asked \npermission to  search the  players  if they  had  been white  and  identified  as  the  “prime  suspects.” \nPlaintiffs  may  attempt to  point to  the  fact that the  spectators  surrounding  plaintiffs’  bus  were  not \nasked  to  undergo  a  search  for the  stolen  1ttems,  however,  these  individuals  were  not  similarly \nsituated  to  plaintiffs  in that they  had  not  been  identified  as  the  “prime  suspects”  but  rather were \nidentified  as  the  victims.  Consequently,  plaintiffs  cannot  offer  any  evidence  to  support the \nconclusion that the  officers  would  have  treated  white  individuals  differently  in  a  similar \ncircumstance. \n15  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  18  of  31  PagelD  #:  107 \nPlaintiff likewise  fails  to  meet the  second  prong  of an  equal  protection  claim  by  proving \nthat the  action taken  against  him  was  motivated  by  their  race.  Macone,  277 F.3d at  10  (1\"  Cir. \n2002).  Rather,  the  facts  plaintiffs  rely  on  to  support these  claim  are  meager  and  do  not  suffice  to \nmeet this  standard.  Essentially,  the  facts  to  support  plaintiffs’  claim  are  that: \n1.  they  are  members  of a minority  group; \n2.  defendants  are  Caucasian;  and \n3.  Plaintiffs  committed  no  crime. \nTo  avoid  summary judgment,  plaintiffs  “must  produce  evidence  sufficient to  permit  a \nreasonable  trier  of fact to  find  by  a preponderance  of the  evidence  that  [the]  decision was  racially \nmotivated.”  Keyser  vy.  Sacramento  City  Unified School District,  265  F.3d  741,  754  (9\"  Cir. \n  \n2001).  “A  long  line  of Supreme  Court  cases  makes  clear  that the  Equal  Protection  Clause \nrequires  proof of discriminatory  intent  or  motive.”  Navarro  v.  Block,  72  F.3d  712,  716  (9\"  Cir. \n1995);  Correa-Martinez  v.  Arrillaga-Belendez,  903  F.2d 49,  53  (1st  Cir.1990) (plaintiff \"may not \n  \nprevail simply  by asserting an  inequity and tacking  on  the  self-serving conclusion  that  the \ndefendant was  motivated by  discriminatory  animus\").  In  support  of the  same,  “the  facts  alleged \nmust  ‘specifically  identify  the  particular  instance(s)  of discriminatory  treatment  and,  as  a  logical \nexercise,  adequately  support the  thesis  that the  discrimination was  unlawful.’\"  Judge  y.  City  of \nLowell,  160 F.3d 67,  77  (1\"  Cir.  1998) \nThe  racial  differential  between  plaintiffs  and  the  defendant  officers  is  not  sufficient to \ncreate  the  inference  of discriminatory  intent  or  motive.  /d.;  Flowers,  239  F.Supp.2d at  178.  In \nJudge,  for  example,  the  plaintiff brought  a $  1983  equal  protection  claim  against  city  police \nofficers  and  the  medical  examiner  alleging  that they  failed  to  properly  investigate  the \ncircumstances  of her  brother’s  death.  The  basis  for  the  plaintiffs  claim  in that  case  was  that the \n16  of  19\n         \nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  19  of  31  PagelD  #:  108 \ndefendants  failed  to  take  certain  actions  such  as  notifying  her  of her  brother’s  death  solely \nbecause  she  was  black.  Jd. at  77.  The  plaintiff,  however,  offered  no  other  evidence  to  support \nthese  allegations.  The  First  Circuit  concluded  that  such  “  mere  conclusory  assertion[s]”  that the \ndefendant’s  actions  were  racially  motivated  is  not  sufficient to  maintain  an  equal  protection \nclaim.  Jd.  This  District  Court,  Judge  Torres,  has  likewise  dismissed  an  equal  protection  claim \nwhere  the  only  evidence  of discriminatory  motive  was  the  fact that the  plaintiff was  black  and \nthe  officers  were  white.  See Flowers,  239  F.Supp.2d at  177  (no  evidence  to  support  conclusion \nthat  the  officers  detained plaintiff because  of his  race). \nIn this  case,  although  plaintiffs  may  be  able  to  present  evidence  that  racial  and  prejudicial \nstatements  were  being  made  by  the  spectators  around  the  bus,  as  well  as  possibly  by  Coventry \nsoccer team  during  the  game,  there  is  absolutely  no  evidence  that the  officers  themselves \nengaged  in this  type  of talk  or  otherwise  exhibited  any  discriminatory  motive.  In  fact,  the \nundisputed  evidence  is  that the  officers  were  courteous  and  professional  “at  all  times”  and \ninstructed  the  spectators  to  quiet  down.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 26,  27 and 32. \nPerhaps  the  best  evidence  of the  complete  dearth  of discriminatory  animus  by  the  officers \nis  Coach  Marchand’s  actions.  There  is  absolutely  no  indication  or  even  an  insinuation that \nCoach  Marchand  discriminated  against these  students  or  possessed  any  racial  bias.  Yet the \nofficers  took the  exact  same  approach  as  Coach Marchand  did.  That  is,  they  sought to  quickly \nresolve  the  situation  by  asking  for  permission to  search the  players.  Coach  Marchand  testified \nthat  he  felt  it was  safer  for  all  involved  to  quickly  get to  the  bottom  of the  accusations  by \nconducting  the  search  and  clearing  his  players.  Marchand  Tr.,  at 28.  There  was  nothing \ndiscriminatory  in  Coach  Marchand’s  approach  and  thus  there  is  likewise  nothing  discriminatory \n17  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  20  of  31  PagelD  #:  109 \nin the  officers’  decision to  follow  a  similar  course  by  asking  for  consent to  search. \nConsequently,  summary judgment  in  favor  of defendants  on  Count  IT  should  enter. \nE.  There  is  no  evidence  of discriminatory  animus  to  support a finding  that  the \ndefendants  violated Rhode  Island’s  Racial Prevention Act  or  the  Racial/National \nOrigin  Intimidation  Statute \nIn  Counts  5  and  6  plaintiffs  seeks  to  maintain  a  claim  for  the  alleged  violation  of Rhode \nIsland’s  Racial  Prevention  Act  and  the  Racial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute.  Defendants \nsubmit that the  same  reasoning  that  support the  entry  of summary judgment  on  plaintiffs’  federal \nEqual  Protection  claim  likewise  supports  the  entry  of summary judgment  on these  state  law \nclaims. \nThe  Racial  Prevention  Act,  in  pertinent  part,  bans  racial  profiling  by  state  or  municipal \nlaw  enforcement  officers.  R..G.L.  $§  31-21.2-3.  \"Racial  profiling\"  is  defined  as  “the  detention, \ninterdiction  or  other  disparate  treatment  of an  individual  on the  basis,  in whole  or  in  part,  of the \nracial  or  ethnic  status  of such  individual,  except when  such  status  is  used  in  combination with \nother  identifying  factors  seeking  to  apprehend  a  specific  suspect whose  racial  or  ethnic  status  is \npart  of the  description  of the  suspect,  which  description  is  timely  and  reliable.”  Jd.  R.IG.L.  § \n31-21.2-3.  The  Racial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute  meanwhile  allows  for  a  cause  of \naction when  an  individual  maliciously  subjects  another  “to  an  act  or  acts  which would  reasonably \nbe  construed  as  intended  to  harass  or  intimidate  the  person  because  of his  or  her  race.  .  .” \nRIG.L.  $  9-1-35  (emphasis  added). \nAs  evident  from  the  face  of both these  statutes,  discriminatory  animus  is  the  touchstone \nto  proving  a  cause  of action  under  either  of these  statutes.  Similar  to  the  utter  lack  of any \nevidence  to  support  a  finding  that the  officers  possessed  discriminatory  animus  in  support  of \nplaintiffs’  equal  protection  claim,  the  lack  of discriminatory  animus  by  the  officers  supports  the \n18  of  19\nCase  1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM  Document  25  Filed  03/10/09  Page  21  of  31  PagelD  #:  110 \nentry  of summary judgment  on  plaintiffs  claim  under  the  Racial  Prevention  Act  and  the \nRacial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute. \nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor  all  the  reasons  cited  herein  as  well  as  those  that  may  be  raised  at  hearing,  defendants \nrespectfully  submit that  summary judgment  on  all  counts  should  enter  in  favor  of defendants. \nDefendants, \nBy  their  attorney, \n/s/ Marc DeSisto \n Marc  DeSisto  (# 2757) \nDESISTO  LAW \n211  Angell  Street \nP.O.

INTRODUCTION \nThis matter comes before this Honorable Court on Defendants’ Motion for Summary \nJudgment on all counts contained in Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint.  The Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint arose out of an incident taking place on or about September 28, 2006.  On that date, \nthe Plaintiffs, who are Hispanic, were members of the Central Falls High School Soccer Team.  \nThe team had travelled by bus to an “away” game in Coventry, a predominately white \ncommunity.  They were accompanied by their coach, Robert Marchand, who was also a teacher \nat Central Falls High School. (Ex. D, 4:22-5:2) \nAs the Central Falls team was boarding their bus to leave, several members of the \nCoventry High School football team claimed that their cell phones, iPods, and various other \narticles had been stolen from their locker room, and immediately concluded that the Central Falls \nteam had been responsible.  An angry mob consisting of Coventry students and parents rapidly \nblocked in the team bus, shouting accusations and racist insults, and demanding a search of the \nCentral Falls players.  Several Coventry Police cruisers rushed to the scene, with their lights \nflashing and sirens blaring, and parked so as to further block in the bus.  Once they arrived, the \nCoventry Police were told that Coach Marchand himself had already conducted a search of the \n  3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 4 of 36 PageID #: 129\nteam and had not located the missing items.  These officers were also aware that many students \nother than the Central Falls players had had access to the locker room.  Nevertheless, the \nCoventry Police officers singled out the members of the Central Falls team for a search of their \npossessions and persons.  This search lasted for about hour, and was conducted a mere six to ten \nfeet of the mob.  At no point was any Coventry student even requested to undergo such a search, \ndespite the fact that any one of the Coventry students could just as easily have taken the items. \nPlaintiffs then brought an action before this Court.  Counts I, II, and III are actions \nbrought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging deprivation of the Plaintiffs’ rights to due process, \nequal protection, and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.  The Plaintiffs also brought \nstate law claims.  Count IV alleged an invasion of privacy pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 9-1-28.1.  \nCount V alleged a violation of Rhode Island’s relatively new Racial Profiling Prevention Act of \n2004, R.I.G.L. § 31-21.2 et seq.  Finally, Count VI alleged a violation of R.I.G.L. § 9-1-35, \nRacial/National Origin Intimidation. \nDefendants now seek summary judgment on all counts of Plaintiffs’ complaint.  The \nDefendants’ attack is twofold.  In support of their argument for disposing of the counts stemming \nfrom the search, they would have this Court believe that Coach Marchand gave a “consent” to \nthe search that legally absolves them of all accountability for their actions.  This position is \nwholly unsupported by the law.  Coach Marchand could not have given a valid “consent” to this \nsearch as a matter of law because he lacked the authority to do so on behalf of his team members.  \nEven if he had had the authority to give such a “consent,” that “consent” was coerced.  As for the \ncounts relating to racial and national origin discrimination, the Defendants argue that these \nshould be disposed of because, in their view, the Central Falls students were actually treated no \ndifferently than any other person similarly situated.  A full treatment of the facts of this matter \n  4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 5 of 36 PageID #: 130\nclearly demonstrates that argument flies in the face of all logic and reason.  Accordingly, the \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment must fail. \nII.  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nContrary to the apparent beliefs of the Defendants, there is disagreement about the material \nfacts.  Plaintiffs can produce evidence demonstrating that the events of September 28, 2006 unfolded \nquite differently from the account given by the Defendants.   \n  On the afternoon of September 28, 2006, the Central Falls Soccer Team arrived at Coventry \nHigh School for a game.  Among the players were Plaintiffs Juan Lopera, a senior, (Ex. A, 6:1.), as \nwell as juniors, Milton Ricuarte, Jr., and Bryan Ocampo. (Ex. B, 74:19-22; Ex. C, 4:9.), and Steve \nGiraldo.  (Ex. D, 5:17-19.)  As the current Police Chief acknowledged, Coventry is a predominately \nwhite community.  (Ex. N, 22:1-7.)  Its High School accordingly reflects that racial composition.  \n1\n(Ex. E, October 2006 Enrollment, Coventry High School. )  By contrast, the Central Falls School \nDistrict is far more racially integrated, with Hispanics comprising the majority group.  (Ex. F, \nOctober 2006 Enrollment, Central Falls School District.)  One member of the Central Falls High \nSchool Soccer Team at the time was Portuguese, and the rest were Hispanic.  (Ex. A, p. 9:2-5.) \nIt was not the standard practice for the visiting team to use Coventry High School’s locker \nroom facilities to change into their game uniforms.  (Ex. G, 21:15-20.)  However, on arrival at \nCoventry, about five or six of the Central Falls team members asked to go into the locker room in \norder to use the bathroom.  (Ex. A, 9:1; Ex. B, 9:12-10:5; Ex. D, 9:10-16.)  There were four doors to \nthe boys’ locker room, and at minimum, the exterior door of the locker room was left open during \ngames and practices as standard procedure.  (Ex. G, 20:22-21:11.)  Coach Marchand accompanied \nthese players to the locker room because they did not know where the bathroom was located.  He did \n                                                \n1\n Exhibits E and F on the Rhode Island Department of Education website, \nhttp://www.eride.ri.gov/reports.asp. \n  5 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 6 of 36 PageID #: 131\nnot go into the locker room itself, but instead asked a security guard to go in with the players.  (Ex. \nB, 10:6-11:20.)  Steven Giraldo, who was one of the players who used the locker room, recalls \nseeing what he believed to be a security guard walking back and forth while they were using the \nlocker room, keeping an eye on them.  (Ex. D, 7:19-8:21) \nOnce the game itself began, the Central Falls players encountered a fair amount of racial \nhostility from Coventry.  During the game, Ocampo and his teammates were told to “go back to \nwhere you were.”  (Ex. C, 36:2-14.)  Ricuarte and Lopera recall numerous instances in which they \nspoke to their teammates in Spanish, their native language, whether on the bench or on the playing \nfield.  The Coventry players ordered them to “speak English.”  (Ex. A, 28:1-10; Ex. B, 6:13-7:21.)   \nSteven Giraldo was referred to as a “spic” by one of the Coventry spectators who was apparently \ndispleased with Giraldo’s play.  (Ex. D, 5:21-7:9.)  The Central Falls players remained stoic, and \nconcentrated on their game.  (Ex. D, 7:5-18.)  This sort of behavior simply was not out of their \nexperience.  (Ex. C, 35:20-23.) \nAt the conclusion of the game, the Central Falls team followed their standard practice of \nlining up by twos and walking straight to the bus, without talking to anybody.  (Ex. H, 17:22-18:1.)  \nUnbeknowst to them, the racial hostility that had smoldered through that late afternoon had not \ndissipated, but had reached a flashpoint.  Coach Marchand was walking in the back of the line at \nsome distance from the team.  He was accosted by a group of about twenty youths wearing jeans and \nt-shirts.  All seemed to have wet hair, as if they had been showering.  (Ex. H, 18:4-19-1.)  Coach \nMarchand later found out that this was the Coventry football team.  (Ex. H, 19:6-7.)  The Coventry \nfootball team demanded to know if Coach Marchand were the “F’n coach of Central Falls.”  When \nCoach Marchand replied he was, they said, “Well, your punks stole all of our F’n shit and they got \nour ipods.”  (Ex. H, 18:5-10.) \n  6 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 7 of 36 PageID #: 132\nCoach Marchand proceeded to the bus.  His team by this time was sitting on the bus.  They \nwere told to keep their mouths shut and their heads down.  (Ex. H, 20:9-12.)  Coach Marchand \ncalled his Assistant Coach, Carl Africo, and told him of the accusations.  (Ex. H, 20:12-15.)  \nMarchand explained to the boys that the crowd believed that the five boys who went into the locker \nroom had taken the missing items.  Coach Marchand told the boys that he knew that they had not \ndone that.  (Ex. B, 29:10-18.)  At some point during this conversation, the boys who had used the \nlocker room at told Marchand that the security guard had followed them around the whole time they \nwere in the locker room.  (Ex. B, 12:7-18, 20:2-13.)  Nevertheless, Coach Marchand and Coach \nAfrico searched the boys, as well as the medicine kits and ball bags.  (Ex. H, 21:8-22:22.)  At the \nend of the search, which lasted about 20-25 minutes, Coach Marchand was “completely satisfied” \nthat the boys had done nothing.  (Ex. H, 15:9-12; 23:4-8.)    \nWhen Coach Marchand was done, he found the Coventry Athletic Director outside.  He told \nthe Athletic Director that the Central Falls boys did not have the items.  (Ex. H, 23:20-24:4.)  On the \nsame day as the game, the Coventry football, cheerleading, and cross-country teams were practicing, \nand by this time their parents were coming to pick them up.  (Ex. H, 19:19-20:2.)  A crowd of about \n50-60 people had gathered outside the bus.  (Ex. H, 24:6-10.)  Coach Marchand heard members of \nthe crowd saying that they knew the Central Falls players had taken the items.  People in that crowd \nalso commented that the Central Falls players were from the ghetto and that “those people” knew \nhow to hide things and “lie good,” and could not be trusted.  The crowd was even demanding a \nsearch of Coach Marchand.  (Ex. H, 24:15-25:25)  Some of those making these remarks were adults.  \n(Ex. H, 25:1-8.)   Other members of the crowd made specific racial slurs, including one woman who \ncalled the team “spics.”  (Ex. D, 27:13-28:5.)  At some point, one Coventry student tried to get on \nthe bus to conduct his own search.  (Ex. B, 53:5-12; Ex. D, 27:11-30:5.)  Others in the crowd \n  7 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 8 of 36 PageID #: 133\ndeclared that the Central Falls team was not leaving “. . . til we find the stuff . . .”  (Ex. H, 25:5-8.)  \nIn any case, the crowd already had formed a semicircle that prevented the bus from moving.  (Ex. D, \n31:16-32:6.)  \nAt that point, three or four Coventry Police cars arrived with their lights and sirens on.  (Ex. \nH, 15:14-16; Ex. I, 38:7-39:2.)  Officers Kevin Harris, David Nelson, and Kevin Kennedy \n2\nresponded, along with their supervisor, Sergeant Stephen Michaelides.   Once the police had \nresponded, the team bus could not have moved without the police cars moving, because one was in \nfront of and the other was in back of the bus.  (Ex. H, 43:15-24.)  Coach Marchand and the Coventry \nAthletic Director spoke to the police.  As the Coventry police officers admitted at deposition, Coach \nMarchand told them that he had already searched his players.  (Ex. H, 26:22-27:4; Ex. I, 76:22-25;  \n(Ex. J, 46:3-5; Ex. K, 43:25-44:2.)  Coach Marchand asked:  “. . . what am I going to do, what are \nthey going to do to us.”  (Ex. H, 27:23-24.)   \n  Coach Marchand did not at any time make the suggestion that the Coventry Police search his \nplayers’ bags.  (Ex. H, 27:18-20.)  At this point, however, the Coventry Police responded to Coach \nMarchand’s question about what would happen by deciding to search the boys themselves.  (Ex. H, \n28:8-29:13.)  At deposition, Officer Harris testified that the second search by the police was \nnecessary:  “[t]o prove that, we don’t know if Coach Marchand is telling us the truth.  We are \ninvestigating the situation.”  (Ex. I, 77:1-4.)  Michaelides testified that he had told Coach Marchand \nthat a police search of the Central Falls team would “. . . expedite the process and eliminate them all \nas suspects.”  (Ex. K, 44:1-6.) \n  At the time that the Coventry Police asked for a second search of the boys, there had been a \nclear rush to judgment as to whether a theft had even taken place.  The Coventry officers had not \n                                                \n2\n In February of 2008, Michaelides was promoted to Lieutenant.  (Ex. K, 18:6-16.) \n  8 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 9 of 36 PageID #: 134\neven asked the Coventry students to make sure that they had not simply mislaid the items.  (Ex. I, \n71:17-72:7; Ex. J, 40:14-17; Ex. M, 28:23-29:1.) Worse, no effort was made then or at any later \npoint to determine precisely what items were allegedly missing and would be sought.  As all of the \nCoventry Police officers also admitted at deposition, not a single one of them obtained any \ndescription of the exact type of iPod alleged to be missing, its color, or whether it was in a case.  .  \n(Ex. I, 66:13-67:4; Ex. J, 39:14-22, 62:5-14; Ex. K, 45:16-19; Ex. M, 27:1-18.)  No Coventry Police \nofficer received any description of the make or model of the cell phone alleged to be missing, other \nthan perhaps its being a “flip phone.”  (Ex. I, 67:5-9;  Ex. J, 39:14-22, 61:19-62:4; Ex. K, 45:20-23; \nEx. M, 27:1-18.)  As matters progressed, students alleged that other items than iPods or cell phones \nwere alleged to be missing, such as books or cash, but the Coventry officers never bothered \nobtaining a final accounting of all missing items.  They merely proceeded to press for a search.  (Ex. \nI, 71:4-12; Ex. J, 40:7-13; Ex. K, 45:10-14.)  \nFurthermore, every single officer on the scene that day knew perfectly well that the locker \nroom was open, and anybody could have accessed it  -- including Coventry as well as Central Falls \nstudents.  (Ex. I, 69:25-70:1, 70:4-7; Ex. J, 47:4-6; Ex. K, 46:2-5.)  Nevertheless, the Coventry \nPolice officers believed the Central Falls students to be suspects, justifying that belief on the basis \nthat the Central Falls students had allegedly been in the locker room where the items had gone \nmissing.  (Ex. I, 69:7-24; Ex. J, 40:1-6.)   \nThe Coventry officers’ view of the Coventry High School students, by contrast, was far more \ncharitable.  Despite the fact that any Coventry student could have just as easily have been a potential \nperpetrator, the Coventry officers considered all of the Coventry High School students on the scene \nto be “victims” – including those who were not complaining of having lost anything.  (Ex. I, 73:7-\n  9 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 10 of 36 PageID #: 135\n74:5.)  No Coventry student was searched at any time.  (Ex. I, 73:4-23; Ex. J, 46:13-24; Ex. K, 46:2-\n5.)  In fact, no Coventry student was even requested to submit to a search.  (Ex. I, 74:4-7.)   \nCoach Marchand, however, was left in a quandary.  Quite rightly, he believed that the \nCoventry Police did not have the right to search the boys.  (Ex. H, 44:16-17.)  He felt that the police \nsimply wanted to:  “. . . appease the masses over there that were crying for our heads.”  (Ex. H, 28:2-\n5.)   Even now that the police had arrived, the crowd outside the bus remained hostile, repeatedly \ncalling out remarks indicating that the Central Falls players were “good at hiding things, they’re \nsneaky you know it, search the coach.”  (Ex. H, 15:14-16:3.)  The police were telling the crowd to \nstop, but they stayed where they were and continued with their remarks.  (Ex. H, 16:3-7, 27:5-9, \n45:8-13.)  Worse, Coach Marchand’s bus was blocked in, and he also had reason to believe that the \npolice were not making any serious effort at controlling the crowd.  Coach Marchand, also a teacher, \ndescribed the situation:  “You know, it was one of those things where you tell the class okay you cut \nit out and you don’t really do anything and then two seconds later they’re talking again, you know.”  \n(Ex. H, 16:3-7, 27:5-9, 45:8-13.)  Coach Marchand fully appreciated the potential for violence that \ncould result with the large crowd.  During his coaching career, he had experienced a situation in \nBurrillville where some disagreement erupted into a serious brawl and injuries to the players, and \nwas fearful that a similar situation might arise.  (Ex. H, 13:16-22.)   \nMarchand therefore felt that he had no under choice but to permit the police search.  (Ex. H, \n44:24.)  Marchand told the boys that the crowd was not going to let them go until the police \nsearched them.  (Ex. D, 36:1-8.)  Marchand never told the boys that he had given the police \npermission to search them.  (Ex D, 37:15-17.)  The Coventry Police ordered the Central Falls \nstudents that everybody was to leave the bus with all of their belongings.  The managers were to \n  10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 11 of 36 PageID #: 136\nbring off the equipment.  They were to line up, put the bags in between their legs and wait for \nfurther instructions.  (Ex. B, 40:17-22; Ex. H, 28:15-23.)   \nAs ordered, the boys lined up with their backs to the bus.  The crowd was about six to ten \nfeet away.  (Ex. A, 21:9-24; Ex. D, 42:6-10.)  After the boys lined up, a Coventry police officer \nannounced that they were there because there were things missing from the locker room.  The \nofficer warned the boys that if they had the items, they were to step forward or they would be \narrested “right now and not be able to go home tonight.”  The officer also announced that they \nwould be doing a search.  (Ex. C, 27:21-28:6.)  The police told the boys to open their bags and \nremove everything.  (Ex. A, 22:8-15.)   \nThe police proceeded down the line to make their searches, with the crowd still looking on.  \nIt appears in at least some cases, some students were searched twice, by different officers.  (Ex. B, \n56:8-57:14.)  Marchand witnessed students’ bags were placed on the hoods of the officers’ cars, and \nthe police searching them.  (Ex. H, 29:8-23.)  At least in part because the Coventry Police had \nobtained no clear idea of what they were looking for in the first place, the Central Falls students had \nto prove that their own cell phones and iPods were their property by allowing the police to search \nthe pictures, numbers, and data stored thereon.  (Ex. B, 49:13-22, 49:23-50:9; Ex. D, 48:2-17, 50:23-\n51:5, 51:6-13.)  On other occasions, the Coventry officers took students’ electronics to the crowd \nand displayed it to the crowd to find out if it were among those said to be missing.  (Ex. A, 26:3-24;  \nEx. C, 29:13-24; Ex. H, 29:8-23.) \nContrary to the officers’ account, the searches were not limited to the students’ belongings, \nbut included searches of their persons.  Lopera was asked if he had anything under his armpits.  He \nsaid no.  The police told him to pull up his shirt, and one officer touched him under the armpits.  Ex. \nA, p. 24:9-11.)  Lopera was told to take off his sweater, and to stretch his shirt and pants to prove \n  11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 12 of 36 PageID #: 137\nthat nothing was in them.  (Ex. A, 24:19-25:24.)  The Coventry police asked Ocampo to empty his \npockets.  (Ex. C, 32:2-4.)  Giraldo was required to lift his shirt to prove that he had nothing in his \nwaistband.  (Ex. D, 49:21-50:5.)  Giraldo also witnessed another player next to him, Pedro \nHernandez, get patted down.  (Ex. D, 50:12-15.)  A Coventry officer told Ricuarte to spread his legs \nand raise his hands straight out.  Beginning at Ricuarte’s ankles, he dragged his hands up his legs, \nribs and arms.  (Ex. B, 47:17-48:16.)  The Coventry officer told Ricuarte to lift his shirt.  (Ex. B, \n49:2-3.) \nThis process lasted for about 45 minutes to an hour.   (Ex. D, 53:8-23; Ex. H, 30:14-15.)  \nWhile the search was ongoing, the players continued to be harassed by the mob.  Ricuarte heard the \ncrowd saying that his team should not be playing Coventry because of their race.  (Ex. B, 31:9-17.)  \nRicuarte, like his Coach, was fearful of being attacked by the crowd.  (Ex. B, 41:22-23.)  The crowd \nrepeatedly photographed the students during the search.  (Ex. A, 27:1-3; Ex. B, 29:1-8, 30:5-11; Ex. \nD, 39:13-17; Ex. H, 47:17-19.)  The crowd continued to refer to the team as “Spics” and make other \ncomments regarding the players’ race.  (Ex. B, 50:11-53:2; Ex. D, 41:13-42-5.)   \nThe Coventry police themselves appear to have felt that this humiliating public search served \nabsolutely no legitimate law enforcement purpose.  During the search, one Coventry officer told \nRicuarte that he thought the search was stupid because the coach had already checked, and in any \ncase the security guard had been with the five boys who had used the locker room the whole time.  \n(Ex. B, 57:18-58:14.)  Another officer heard this remark and laughed.  (Ex. B, 58:20-23.)   Later, \nhowever, when this incident attracted media attention, the matter was brought up at roll call, with \nChief O’Rourke relaying to Coventry officers through Sergeant Michaelides that they had done \nnothing wrong.  (Ex. K, 57:20-58:16.) \n \n  12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 13 of 36 PageID #: 138\nIII.  LEGAL ARGUMENT \nDefendants face a formidable burden in obtaining summary judgment.  Defendants must \ndemonstrate that “. . . the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on \nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact \nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  The \nreviewing court does not make factual determinations itself, or decide which edition of the facts \nto accept; it merely determines whether “. . . a fair-minded jury could return a verdict for the \nplaintiff on the case presented.”  Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir. \n1988).  The record is reviewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Rossy v. \nRoche Products, Inc., 880 F.2d 621, 623 (1st Cir. 1989).  All factual inferences must be drawn in \nfavor of the non-moving party.  See Rossy at 623.  Defendant’s burden is particularly onerous in \ndiscrimination cases.  The First Circuit has counseled caution and restraint when deciding a \nsummary judgment motion in a discrimination action because motion and intent play such a \nprominent role.  See Oliver v. Digital Equipment Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 109 (1st Cir. 1988).  Such \nquestions of motive and intent are considered the realm of the jury.  Rossy, at 624.   \nWhen one examines the evidence in its totality – including that substantial amount of \nevidence that the Defendants omitted from their discussion – it is clear that Defendants cannot \nobtain summary judgment.  Instead, there is more than sufficient evidence on the record that \ncould support a jury verdict for the Plaintiffs on all counts. \nA.  NO PROBABLE CAUSE EXISTED FOR THE SEARCH OF THE \nSTUDENTS AND THEIR POSSESSIONS. \n \nIt is beyond cavil that the Coventry Police had no right to search the Central Falls players \nwithout consent.  A search or seizure conducted without a warrant based upon probable cause \nhas historically been deemed presumptively unreasonable, unless it falls within certain well-\n  13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 14 of 36 PageID #: 139\ndefined exceptions.  See Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 \n(1993).  Probable cause does not exist unless the facts available to the officer would allow a \nreasonable person to believe that the search will yield evidence of a crime or evidence of a crime.  \nSee Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983), citing \nBrinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949).  \n“Probable cause” does not require certainty, but the officer’s mere suspicion or personal belief is \nnot enough.  United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 502.  Instead, there must be a “fair \nprobability,” based upon the totality of the circumstances, that the evidence or contraband will be \nfound in the area to be searched.  See United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir. 1995). \nFurthermore, probable cause must be supported by individualized suspicion.  See, e.g., Ybarra v. \nIllinois, 444 U.S. 85, 110 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1980).   \nThere was a complete dearth of probable cause for this search.  No individualized \nsuspicion could be cast upon the Coventry players because there simply was no reason to suspect \nthe Central Falls players to any greater degree than any other person on the campus at the time of \nthe incident.  At deposition, the Coventry officers attempted to justify their search on the basis \nthat the Central Falls players had been in the locker room.  (Ex. I, 69:7-24;Ex. J, 40:1-6.)  \nHowever, the Coventry officers also admitted that the locker room was open and available to all, \nand virtually any person could have entered and taken the items -- including Coventry students.  \n(Ex. I, 69:25-70:1; 70:4-7; Ex. J, 47:4-6; Ex. K, 46:2-5.)  For that reason alone, there could have \nbeen no individualized suspicion of any of the Central Falls students.  The simple fact that one \nwas in an area in which a crime may have been committed has never been accepted as sufficient \n“probable cause” for a search of one’s person or possessions.  See, e.g., Ybarra, at  91, citing \nSibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 62-63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968).   \n  14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 15 of 36 PageID #: 140\nIn any case, all of the Central Falls students were searched, rather than the mere five or \nsix students who had used the locker room.  The mere fact that some of them had been in the \nlocker room did not create probable cause as to all of the students.  Simply being with associated \nwith others who may have been involved in criminal activity is similarly not enough to establish \n“probable cause.”  United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 287 (1st 1997); United States v. \nSepulveda, 102 F.3d 1313, 1315 (1st Cir. 1996).  Accordingly, even if we accepted the \nproposition that there could be probable cause for the students who had used the locker room, \nthere was still no probable cause for a search of the entire team. \nThe demand for a search is even more egregious when one considers that the police had \nnever made any serious attempt to ascertain that a theft had taken place, much less of precisely \nwhat items were missing.  The Coventry Police never made any effort to determine if the items \nhad merely been misplaced.  (Ex. I, 71:17-72:7; Ex. J, 40:14-17; Ex. M, 28:23-29:1.)   The \nCoventry officers never even ascertained precisely what was missing so that they could identify \nthe missing items.  No description was even sought of the cell phones and iPods first said to be \nmissing, whether by size, color, make, or model.  (Ex. I, 66:13-67:4, 67:5-9;  Ex. J, 39:14-22, \n62:5-14 61:19-62:4; Ex. K, 45:16-19, 45:20-23; Ex. M, 27:1-18.)  That lack of basic information \nrendered the search itself little more than a “fishing expedition.”   \nWorse, the police had been given information clearly exculpating the Central Falls team.  \nThe officers freely admitted at deposition that they had been made aware that Coach Marchand \nhad already searched his players, and had not found the missing items.  (Ex. H, 26:22-27:4; Ex. I, \n76:22-25; Ex. J, 46:3-5; Ex. K, 43:25-44:2.)  At least one of the Coventry officers appears to \nhave been fully aware of the fact that there was no reason to suspect the Central Falls team of \nany wrongdoing.  That officer indicated to Plaintiff Milton Ricuarte, Jr. during the search that the \n  15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 16 of 36 PageID #: 141\nsearch was “stupid” not only because their coach had searched them, but also because the police \nknew that a security officer had been with the boys who had used the locker room the entire \ntime.  (Ex. B, 57:18-14.)   \nThe search of the Central Falls team, then, was inherently unreasonable.  The Coventry \nPolice knew or should have known that there was simply no reason at the time to suspect the \nCentral Falls students of theft.  If anything, there was even less reason to suspect the Central \nFalls players than others.  Nevertheless, the Coventry Police embarked on a thorough public \nrummaging through the Central Falls’ players belongings and persons, without even so much as \na clear idea of what they were looking for.  This type of police behavior can never be considered \nreasonable under any concept of ordered liberty, but can only be construed as a Constitutionally \nobnoxious “dragnet” tactic. \nB.  THE CLEARLY ESTABLISHED LAW AT THE TIME OF THE SEARCH \nDID NOT GRANT COACH MARCHAND AUTHORITY TO CONSENT \nTO THE SEARCH OF THE STUDENTS.   \n \n  In their supporting Memorandum, the Defendants did not attempt to argue that any \nexceptions to the probable cause and warrant requirements existed.  Defendants instead take \ncover behind a claim that Coach Marchand had consented to the search in an in loco parentis \ncapacity.  As a fallback position, Defendants rely upon the qualified immunity defense.  \n  Defendants’ effort at Constitutionally sanitizing their actions is unavailing.  “Qualified \nimmunity” does not shield government officials from actions that they reasonably should have \nknown were violative of another’s Constitutional rights at the time.  See Cookish v. Powell, 945 \nF.2d 441, 442 (1st Cir. 1991), citing Newman v. Massachusetts, 884 F.2d 19, 26 (1st Cir. 1989).  \nInstead, it must be determined whether the state of the law, as it existed at the time of the search, \n  16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 17 of 36 PageID #: 142\nwould have put the Defendants on fair notice that their acts or omissions were unconstitutional.  \nSee Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2516, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002).   \nThis test is entirely objective; the officer’s good faith belief in the Constitutionality of his \nactions or omissions is irrelevant.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 816-20, 102 S.Ct. \n2727, 2737-2739, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  The court must proceed on “. . . the juridical \nequivalent of an archelogical dig.”  Savard v. Rhode Island, 338 F.3d 23, 28 (1st Cir. 2003)  The \ncourt must examine the controlling case law in its own jurisdiction at that time of the action or \nomission complained of.  Id.at 28.  If none exists, the court must attempt to determine whether \nthere is consensus elsewhere.  Id.  In that quest, the court should look to all available case law.  \nHatch v. Dept. for Children, Youth and their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2001). \nFurthermore, it is not required that the plaintiff produce pre-existing case law expressly \nforbidding the precise conduct in question.  See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 \nS.Ct. 3034, 3039, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987).  As First Circuit Court Judge Selya recently suggested, \nto suggest otherwise would be to view a Constitutional violation in the same light as dog bite \nunder common law, in that the first bite would always be free.  See Bergeron v. Cabral, 2009 \nWL 580795 (1st Cir.)  Therefore, if the authorities existing at the time are sufficiently \nparticularized so that a reasonable official could extrapolate from them and conclude that his \nparticular action or omission would violate the law, then the official cannot assert the qualified \nimmunity defense.  Savard, at 28, citing Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, \n150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \nThe law is more than sufficiently clear on the point of Coach Marchand’s lack of \nauthority to consent to a search.  Under case law established at the time, Coach Marchand, in his \ncapacity as school official, had far less than that unbridled in loco parentis authority over the \n  17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 18 of 36 PageID #: 143\nstudents that the Defendants would suggest; as a government official, his authority was \nConstitutionally cabined.  Under the circumstances, Coach Marchand plainly could not have \nconducted a search of the team members, even under the relaxed standards for student searches \nestablished in the United States Supreme Court’s decision, New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, \n105 S.Ct. 733 (1985).  Because Coach Marchand himself could not have required a search of his \nstudents under these circumstances, it defies logic to declare that he could have authorized such a \nsearch on his student’s behalf by a policeman.  Even if we did accept the proposition that Coach \nMarchand had the authority to consent to a search, that consent was hardly voluntary in nature.  \nAccordingly, any purported consent given by Coach Marchand was void as a matter of clearly \nestablished law, and qualified immunity cannot apply. \n1.  Under the Clearly Established Law at the Time of the Search, Coach \nMarchand Did Not Stand In Loco Parentis With Respect to the \nStudents for the Purpose of Granting Consent to Search. \n \n  Defendants’ assertion regarding the extent of Coach Marchand’s authority over the \nCentral Falls players is flawed for the simple reason that it is seriously outdated.  It is true that at \none point, courts did consider a school official’s relationship with the student to be in loco \nparents by nature.  See James Rapp, Education Law, § 8.01[2][b][ii] (2002).  Where public \nschool students are concerned, the in loco parentis doctrine has been separated from Fourth \nAmendment jurisprudence for at least thirty years. \n  The in loco parentis doctrine, in its most classical sense, places the schools “in the place \nof the parent,” with all of a parent’s rights and responsibilities.  In other words, when a child was \nplaced in a care of a teacher, the parent delegated to that teacher all of his rights and \nresponsibilities.  See id.  However, especially during the last century, it has become apparent that \nthat delegation is not complete.  Nobody would seriously argue that a teacher has the right to \n  18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 19 of 36 PageID #: 144\nmake a number of the various types of decisions entrusted to parents – for example, decisions as \nto the student’s health care.  A teacher’s in loco parentis with relationship to the student instead \nbegins and ends with respect to matters directly related with that student’s education.  See People \nv. Jackson, 319 N.Y.S.2d 731, 733-734 (1971).   \n  During the last half of the last century, the United States Supreme Court similarly came \nto realize that the in loco parentis doctrine really represented no more than a relic of a day when \nmost schools were privately operated, and simply did not mesh with a state-operated system of \ncompulsory education.  In 1985, with the Court’s decision in T.L.O., it was firmly established \nthat a student’s right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure under Fourth Amendment, in \ncommon with a student’s First Amendment rights and rights to due process, could not be \nsmothered under the in loco parentis doctrine: \nNotwithstanding the general applicability of the Fourth Amendment to the \nactivities of civil authorities, a few courts have concluded that school officials are \nexempt from the dictates of the Fourth Amendment by virtue of the special nature \nof their authority over schoolchildren.  See, e.g., R.C.M. v. State, 660 S.W.2d 552 \n(Tex. App. 1983).  Teachers and school administrators, it is said, act in loco \nparentis in their dealings with students:  their authority is that of the parent, not \nthe State, and is therefore not subject to the limits of the Fourth Amendment.  \nIbid. \n \nSuch reasoning is in tension with contemporary reality and the teachers of this \nCourt.  We have held school officials subject to the commands of the First \nAmendment, see Tinker v. Des Moines Ind. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 89 \nS.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, see Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 \n(1975).  If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the constitutional \nguarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it is difficult to understand \nwhy they should be deemed to be exercising parental rather than public authority \nwhen conducting searches of their students.  More generally, the Court has \nrecognized that “the concept of parental delegation” as a source of school \nauthority is not entirely “consonant with compulsory education laws.”  Ingraham \nv. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 1402, 1407, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977).  \nToday’s public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily \nconferred on them by individual parents; rather, they act in furtherance of publicly \nmandated educational and disciplinary policies.  See, e.g., the opinion in State ex \n  19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 20 of 36 PageID #: 145\nrel. T.L.O., 94 N.J., at 343, 463 A.2d, at 934, 940, describing the New Jersey \nstatutes regulating school disciplinary policies and establishing the authority of \nschool officials over their students.  In carrying out searches and other \ndisciplinary functions pursuant to such policies, school officials act as \nrepresentatives of the State, not merely as surrogates for the parents, and they \ncannot claim the parents’ immunity from the strictures of the Fourth Amendment. \n \nId. at 336.  The T.L.O. Court proceeded to establish a “reasonable suspicion” standard on school \nofficials’ ability to search students suspected of violation of law or school rules.  Id. at 341-42. \nSince T.L.O., the Court has only had two occasions upon which to revisit the issue of \nschool officials’ relationships with their students in regards to searches.  These cases were \nlimited to the specific issue of schools’ ability to make random drug testing a condition of \nparticipation in athletics and extracurricular activities    See Bd. of Educ. of Ind. Sch. Dist. No. 92 \nof Pottawatomie County v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 122 S.Ct. 2559 (2002); Vernonia Sch. Dist. v. \nActon, 515 U.S. 646, 115 S.Ct. 2386 (1995).  The Court found in favor of the schools under a \n“special needs” exception, that is, the school officials’ unique need to ensure a drug-free school \nenvironment that went beyond ordinary law enforcement.  Earls, at 836; Vernonia, at 653-54.  \nHowever, neither case reinstated any notion of an “in loco parentis” relationship between school \nand student where searches were concerned.  Public school officials instead had the status of \ngovernmental actors. \nEven prior to T.L.O., courts had considered and rejected the proposition that a police \nofficer could rely upon the “consent” of school officials to obtain permission to search.  The case \nof Picha v. Wielgos, 410 F.Supp. 1214, 1218 (N.D. Ill. 1976) involved a search of female \nstudents directed by outside police officers for purposes finding illegal drugs on the students’ \npossessions.3  The Picha Court held that such a police-directed search could not pass \n                                                \n3\n The actual search of these students was done by female school personnel, apparently in light of \nthe students’ gender. \n  20 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 21 of 36 PageID #: 146\nConstitutional muster based on the in loco parentis authority of school officials alone:  “. . . \nwhatever may be the consent to the discretion of the school officials deemed constructively made \nby the parent or student, it cannot vitiate the constitutional expectation of privacy which decrease \nthe need for levels of suspicion and/or exigency in the conduct of a criminal investigation.”  Id. \nat 1221.  The Picha Court, then, freely recognized the dangers of allowing the in loco parentis \ndoctrine to be applied where the police knock on the school door.  Permitting the application of \nthat doctrine when that child is in the custody of school officials simply makes it all too easy to \nallow those officers to circumvent limitations on search and seizures that would apply to that \nstudent outside of school. \n  Closer to home, Rhode Island law also undermines the conclusion that Coach Marchand, \nas a school official, possessed in loco parentis authority with respect to searches by police.  Just \none year prior to this incident, the General Assembly passed legislation governing police \ninterrogations of students while attending school.  Those statutes provide, in pertinent part: \n(a) Before making a high school pupil under eighteen (18) years of age available \nto a law enforcement officer for the purpose of questioning, the principal of the \nschool, or his or her designee, shall inform the pupil that the pupil has the right to \nrequest that his or her parent or guardian or an adult family member, or person on \nthe list of emergency contacts for the pupil be present during the questioning. \n \n(b) If the person selected by the pupil cannot be made available within a \nreasonable period of time, not exceeding one hour, or declines to be present at the \nquestioning, the principal or his or her designee shall inform the pupil that the \npupil may select as an alternate, a school administrator, school counselor, or \nschool teacher who is reasonably available to be present during the questioning. \n \n(c) If the person selected by the pupil declines to be present during the \nquestioning, the principal, or his or her designee, shall so inform the pupil and \nadvise the pupil that the principal, or his or designee, will be present during the \nquestioning if the pupil so requests. \n \n(d) If the pupil exercises his or her right, pursuant to this subsection, to have one \nof the persons designated in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) present during the \nquestioning, the pupil may not be made available to the law enforcement officer \n  21 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 22 of 36 PageID #: 147\nfor questioning until that person is present. \n \nP.L. 2005, ch. 409, § 1, codified at R.I.G.L. § 16-21.5-3.  This statute, on its face, requires that \nwhen minor high school students – such as the Plaintiffs – are sought for police questioning \nwhile at school, the school officials must take affirmative steps to ensure that the student may \nconsult with his or her parents.  This statute made it clear that the task of making legal decisions \nfor the student in this situation – such as whether to be interviewed or not -- was not to be \nautomatically delegated to the school administrators in an in loco parentis capacity.   Instead, the \nparents’ control over these situations was to be preserved.  It is hardly consonant with this statute \nto declare that school officials have an in loco parentis authority to consent to a bodily search of \n4\nthe student by police.    \nGiven this legal background, the in loco parentis doctrine is a wilted, dead reed to grasp \nin an attempt to haul the Defendants’ actions out of Constitutional deep water.  In the first \ninstance, Coach Marchand’s in loco parentis authority clearly extended only to those matters \nrelated to the team members’ educations.  The decision as to whether to consent to a police \nsearch implicates far broader matters.  A consent to a search involves a waiver of important legal \nrights – and, possibly, affects the student’s future far after graduation.  By consenting to a search, \none does not only agree to relinquish one’s interest in privacy in the thing or place being \nsearched.  One also accepts the possibility that the fruits of that search might be used as evidence \nagainst one.  Whether a student should waive one’s rights in a criminal law setting is one that \nclearly goes far beyond an educator’s responsibilities. \n                                                \n4\n It is also worth noting that the Coventry Police itself recognized the primacy of the parents \nwhen approaching minors.  Written policy of the Coventry Police Department specifically called \nfor parents to be contacted when minors were being interviewed by police.  (Ex. L.)  (Ex. J, \n33:23-25; Ex. K, p. 27:7:16.)     \n \n  22 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 23 of 36 PageID #: 148\nEven more significantly, the Supreme Court had made clear almost thirty years ago that \nfor Fourth Amendment purposes, a public school teacher is not and is never to be confounded \nwith a student’s parent.  Instead, that teacher, like the police officer, is a government actor, \nwhose authority to search is constrained.  As we shall explore more deeply in the next section, \nthe limits of the teacher’s authority to search necessarily limits the teacher’s authority to give \nanother permission to search. \n2.  Under the Clearly Established Law at the Time of the Search, Coach \nMarchand as a School Official Lacked the Authority to Perform the \nSearch of the Students Himself Under the Factual Circumstances and \nTherefore Could Not Authorize the Same. \n \n  It plainly defies logic to declare that one can authorize another to perform an act that one \nis expressly forbidden to undertake oneself.  Defendants’ argument in favor of Coach \nMarchand’s authority to consent to search is hopelessly infected by that very type of logical flaw.  \nUnder clear law in place at the time of the search, Coach Marchand, as a public school official, \ncould not simply search his charges whenever he wished, but was held to a “reasonable \nsuspicion” standard.  Because Coach Marchand did not have that “reasonable suspicion,” he \nhimself was forbidden to conduct a search and therefore could not have given the Coventry \nPolice the permission to do the same. \nThe T.L.O. Court was loathe to impose a “probable cause” regime upon school officials.  \nNevertheless, the T.L.O. Court recognized a need for restrictions on school officials’ ability to \nsearch students accused of wrongdoing.  Under T.L.O., one must consider whether the search \nwas justified at its inception, and whether the search was reasonably related in scope to the \npurposes of the search.  Id. at 341-42.  A search by a school official is only justified at its \ninception if the school official has a reasonable belief that the search will uncover evidence of \nwrongdoing by the student.  Id.   \n  23 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 24 of 36 PageID #: 149\nWe anticipate that the Defendants may point to later cases involving random drug \nsearches as overturning T.L.O.  Subsequent to T.L.O., the Court did find that school officials \ncould require suspicionless, random drug testing as a condition of participation in athletics and \nextracurricular activities.  Earls, at 836; Vernonia, at 653-54.  We also believe that the \nDefendants may point to this Court’s own decision in Brousseau v. Town of Westerly, 11 \nF.Supp.2d 177 (D.R.I. 1998).  The Brousseau case involved a “pat-down” of a group of \nelementary schoolchildren to locate a missing pizza knife with a nine-inch serrated blade.  Id. at \n179.   \nNone of these cases should be construed as a wholesale defenestration of the requirement \nof reasonable suspicion, as applied to searches of public school students suspected of actual \nwrongdoing.  Instead, these cases are more properly understood to belong to the class of “special \nneeds” cases.  See especially Shade v. City of Farmington, 309 F.3d 1054, 1060 (8th Cir. 2002); \nDesroches v. Caprio, 974 F.Supp. 542, 548-49 (E.D. Va. 1997), overturned on other grounds, \nth\n156 F.3d 571 (4  Cir. 1998).  Before such a “special need” is found, one must carefully consider \nthe nature of the intrusion, and balance that against the governmental interest involved.  \nVernonia, at 654-661.  When one applies this calculus to the instant situation, it is apparent that \nVernonia, Earls, and Brousseau are wholly inapposite to this situation. \nFirst, the evils that the searches were to avoid were far more pressing in Vernonia, Earls, \nand Brousseau than in the present instance.  The searches were aimed solely at student safety.  In \nBrousseau, the danger was immediate:  there was a strong possibility that a child had in his or \nher possession a knife capable of inflicting serious or even fatal injury, and there was no other \nefficacious way of ensuring otherwise.  Id. at 182.  In Vernonia and Earls, the danger was illegal, \nand potentially lethal substances.  Earls at 835; Vernonia at 662. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 25 of 36 PageID #: 150\nSecond, the nature of the intrusions in Vernonia, Earls, and Brousseau was far more \nlimited.  In Brousseau, the search was limited to a mere “pat down.”  Id. at 179.  In Vernonia and \nEarls, the intrusion was minimized by the fact that the students were informed in advance that \nthe drug tests would be required, and could be avoided by simply not going out for activities or \nthe team.  Earls at 832; Vernonia, at 657.  Additionally, the search was limited solely to evidence \nof illegal drug use, and results of the search were kept confidential.  Earls at 833; Vernonia, at \n658.  The drug tests were conducted in a truly random fashion, thus avoiding the possibility that \nunpopular groups were being targeted.  Earls, at 837.  Most significantly, the results were not \nused for either law enforcement or even school disciplinary purposes.  Earls at 833-34; \nVernonia, at 658. \nHere, the level of need for the search was far lesser.  There was no pressing safety \nconcern here.  All that had happened here was that a student may or may not have been deprived \nof his cell phone or iPod.  Although many adolescents have certainly argued to their parents that \ndeath or other immediate and irreparable harm would result from deprivation of a cell phone or \niPod, none have been able to produce reliable evidence to support such a claim.  There was \ntherefore no “safety” need resulting from the disappearance of these devices justifying a \nsuspicionless search.   \nIt is true that Coach Marchand did give the purported “consent” out of concern for \nstudent safety under the near-melee conditions.  However, even these concerns do not bring the \nsearch within the orbit of Vernonia, Earls, and Brousseau.  No court has ever accepted the \nproposition that you may be compelled to give up your Constitutional rights simply because you \nhave been ganged up on and ordered that you surrender that right to ensure your safety.  That is \nprecisely what took place here where the bus was blocked in and the crowd declared that the \n  25 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 26 of 36 PageID #: 151\nCentral Falls team was not leaving until the items were found.  (Ex. H, 25:5-8.)  More \nimportantly, the search in no way contributed to student safety.  If anything, the manner in which \nthe searches were conducted increased the danger to the students rather than allayed it.  The \nstudents were at least relatively secure on the bus.  The Coventry Police’s search removed them \nfrom that refuge.  Exposing a student to greater danger was hardly what the Vernonia or Earls \nCourt had in mind. \nNot only did the search lack any legitimate safety concern, but the searches were also far \nmore intrusive than those in Vernonia, Earls, or Brousseau.  Unlike in Vernonia or Earls, there \nwas no way the students could have anticipated that this type of search would be demanded of \nthem.  The student’s bags were thoroughly searched, and the students were forced to lift clothing \nto the bare skin.  The searches were not conducted in a confidential manner.  Instead, the \nstudents were forced to spend an hour before a hostile crowd that was filming the event.  This \nwas far more intrusive than a brief “pat down” or a quickly administered urine test. \nAccordingly, the suspicionless searches here were wholly unlike the “special needs” \nsearches authorized by Vernonia, Earls, or Brousseau.  For that reason, none of these cases \napplied to this situation.  Instead, the T.L.O. standard prevailed for these students, and reasonable \nsuspicion was needed before Coach Marchand could authorize a search.  \nBy the time the Coventry Police arrived, Coach Marchand had no reasonable suspicion \n5\nthat his students had engaged in any wrongdoing.    As we discussed in Subsection A above, \nthere was no reason to suspect any Central Falls student any more than anybody else.  Coach \nMarchand himself never even suspected his team at all.  He specifically told them before the \npolice arrived that he did not believe that they had stolen anything.  (Ex. B, 29:10-18.)  By the \n                                                \n5 We also observe that Coach Marchand’s initial search was highly suspect under T.L.O.   \n  26 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 27 of 36 PageID #: 152\ntime that he searched the students, he was “completely satisfied” that they had done nothing \nwrong.  (Ex. H, 15:9-12; 23:4-8.)  At the inception of the search allegedly “authorized” by the \npolice, then, Coach Marchand had no “reasonable suspicion,” and therefore could not have \nrequired a search of the students.   \nIn summary, there is no way that the existing case could be stretched to find authority for \nCoach Marchand to search the students under these factual circumstances.  His authority to \ndemand a search of the boys never existed because he never had any type of suspicion of them at \nall.  Therefore, he could not simply authorize the Coventry police to do it.  To state otherwise \nrisks actual violence to students’ Fourth Amendment rights.  If all an overreaching teacher needs \nto do is to call a police officer and give “permission” for that officer to search that student, then \nthere is little or no point to granting students a right to freedom from unreasonable search and \nseizure from their teachers in the first place.  That kind of evasion is clearly not what the T.L.O \nCourt had in mind, and should not be countenanced here.  \n3.  Notwithstanding the Presence of Coach Marchand, the Clearly \nEstablished Case Law at the Time of the Search Continued to Hold \nthe Coventry Officers to the Same Standard for Searches and Seizures \nof the Central Falls Players as Would Be Applied to Any Other \nCitizen. \n \n  An even more recent line of cases further illuminates Coach Marchand’s lack of authority to \nprovide consent to search of the students.  In recent years, many schools use “school resource \nofficers,” or “liaison officers,” officers who are actually employed by the school districts or who are \nregularly assigned to the schools as their “beat.”  Coventry, as with many other districts in Rhode \nIsland, has similarly adopted the practice of using “school resource officers.  In Coventry, the \nSchool Resource Officer (SRO) is the law enforcement officer assigned to the school or school \ndistrict.  The SRO also serves as a “. . . point of contact for the student and faculty for intervention, \n  27 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 28 of 36 PageID #: 153\nmediation, peer mediation, referral to outside agencies . . .”  The SRO also serves as “. . . a visible \nrole model and familiar face to the student and faculty.”  (Ex. G, 13:12-23.) \nA number of jurisdictions have chosen to treat “school resource officers” or “liaison \nofficers” as school officials, and thus applied the “reasonable suspicion” standard granted to \nschool officials under T.L.O., whether that “school resource officer” is acting in his own capacity \nin maintaining a safe school environment, or is acting at the behest of another school official.  \nSee Shade v. City of Farmington, 309 F.3d 1054, 1060-61 (8th Cir. 2002); Cason v. Cook, 810 \nF.3d 188, 192-93 (8th Cir. 1987); In re Alexander B., 220 Cal.App.3d 1572, 1577, 270 Cal.Rptr. \n342 (Cal.App. 1990); State v. D.S., 685 So.2d 41, 43 (Fla. App. 1997); People v.

Ct.); In the Matter of D.D., 554 S.E.2d 346, 353 \n(N.C.App. 2001); In re Murray, 525 S.W.3d 496, 498 (N.C.App. 2000); In the Matter of Josue \nT., 989 P.2d 431,437 (N.M. 1999); Commonwealth v.

The rationale for allowing such a relaxed standard for SROs \nis that the SRO essentially functions as a school official, and acts in aid of the school officials’ \nfunction of maintaining campus discipline and order.  Angelina D.B.. at 688. \nNotwithstanding the line of cases, the standard for searches and seizures remains \nunchanged for outside police officers not acting at the behest of school officials.  The T.L.O. \nCourt specifically warned that its ruling regarding “reasonable suspicion” should not be \nconstrued as applying to searches “. . . conducted by school officials in conjunction with or at the \nbehest of law enforcement agencies.”  Id. at 342, n.7.  Both before and after T.L.O., outside \npolice officers who performed student searches sua sponte have always been held to the same \n  28 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 29 of 36 PageID #: 154\nFourth Amendment standards as any other police officer.  See R.D.S. v. State, 245 S.W.3d 356, \n369 (Tenn. 2008); M.D. v. Smith, 504 F.Supp.2d 1238, 1245 (M.D. Ala. 2007); State v. Tywane \nH., 933 P.2d 251, 255 (N.M. App. 1997); M.J. v. State, 399 So.2d 996, 998 (Fla.App. 1981); \nWaters v. United States, 311 A.2d 835, 837-38 (D.C. App. 1973).  Courts have steadfastly \nrefused to budge from these standards even where the outside officer acted when the child was in \nthe custody of school officials or was at school at the time the officer chose to do the search.  See \nIn the Interest of Thomas B.D., 486 S.E.2d 498, 500 (S.C. App. 1997); F.P. v. State, 528 So.2d \n1253, 1254 (Fla. App. 1 Dist. 1988) (probable cause standard applied in search of student being \nquestioned regarding auto theft outside of school).  The rationale for maintaining the probable \ncause standard outside police officers not acting at the behest of school officials is obvious.  If \nwe are to accept the proposition that a student’s mere presence at school lowers the standard for \npolice searches, then the students’ rights to be free of unreasonable searches from the police \nwould be eviscerated.   \nA similar evisceration would be worked if we permitted school officials to grant outside \nofficers “consent” to search students for matters unrelated to school discipline.  All that the \npolice officer would need to do to circumvent the probable cause requirement is to wait until the \nstudent goes to school and persuade a school official to give “permission” to perform the search.  \nIn a day and age in which the police are already present on numerous school campuses, in the \npersona of the SRO, it is all too easy to envision the development of such a collusive \nrelationship.  Allowing the application of in loco parentis doctrine to give outside officers access \nto students is wholly incongruous with a line of cases that has insisted that outside officers must \nbe held to the same Fourth Amendment standards that would apply to students outside of school.  \nPicha, at 1221. \n  29 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 30 of 36 PageID #: 155\n  Here, there is no question that the Coventry Police were in any way acting in aid of \n6\nCoach Marchand in his disciplinary function.  None were School Resource Officers.   (Ex. I, \n24:25-25:2; Ex. J, 29:6-7; Ex. K, 53:9-10.)  More importantly, even before the police arrived, \nCoach Marchand had already completed his own investigation and satisfied himself that the boys \nhad done nothing wrong.   Therefore, he had no desire or need for assistance in his disciplinary \nfunction.  The relationship between the Coventry Police officers and Coach Marchand was \nhardly a cooperative one, but had been an adversarial, law-enforcement type of search from the \nbeginning.  As one of the officers testified, the reason they wanted to do their own search was to \nsee if Coach Marchand was telling the truth about the boys.  (Ex. I, 77:1-4.)  Therefore, the \nCoventry Police cannot be said to have been aiding Coach Marchand in his disciplinary role over \nthe students, and cannot be permitted to take advantage of any relaxed Fourth Amendment \nstandard.  Further, they were not permitted to take advantage of any in loco parentis authority so \nas to circumvent the Fourth Amendment.   \n4.  Coach Marchand’s Purported “Consent” to the Search Was Not \nKnowing and Voluntary. \n \n  Even if we accepted the proposition that Coach Marchand could have given a valid \n“consent” to the search of his students, the consent in this case was invalidated by the coercive \ncircumstances under which it was obtained.  In order for a consent to a search to be valid, the \ngovernment must show that that consent was freely and voluntarily given, rather than the product \nof coercion.  United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 37 (2008).  The question of whether the \nconsent was freely and voluntarily given is one of fact, and requires “. . . an examination of the \ntotality of the circumstances surrounding the relevant transaction between law-enforcement \nauthorities and the consenting parties.”  Id., citing United States v. Pérez-Montañez, 202 F.3d \n                                                \n6 Kennedy had only graduated from Police Academy in March of 2006.  (Ex. M, 14:21-15:3.) \n  30 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 31 of 36 PageID #: 156\n434, 438 (1st Cir. 2000).  Coercion may be express or implied.  Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 \nU.S. 218, 227, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2048, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)  Consent may not be the product of \nan illegal detention.   United States v. Jenson, 462 F.3d 399, 407 (5th Cir. 2006).  Similarly, the \nthreat of violence or deception may invalidate consent to a search.  See United States v. Rosario-\nDiaz, 202 F.3d 54, 69 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Kampbell, 574 F.2d 962, 963 (8th Cir. \n1978)   \nThe evidence on the record can support the conclusion that the Coventry Police not only \nfailed to defuse an already inherently coercive situation, but actively contributed to and exploited \nit.  At the time the Coventry Police arrived, the Central Falls bus was already blocked in by the \nmob and could not leave.  The Coventry Police blocked in the bus with their vehicles, thus \ncontributing to a completely unwarranted detention, since there was no probable cause, or even \nreasonable suspicion.  (Ex. D, 31:15-32:6; Ex. H, 43:15-24.)  Worse, the Coventry Police at no \npoint took any effective action to dissipate the crowd or otherwise stop the harassment.  (Ex. H, \n16:3-7, 27:5-9, 45:8-13.)  Coach Marchand expressed fear of the crowd to the Coventry officers, \nand appealed to them for assistance in extricating him and his players from this dangerous \nsituation, asking them:  “. . . what am I going to do, what are they going to do to us.”  (Ex. H, \n27:23-24.)  No real help was offered except for the search that the crowd was demanding. \n  Furthermore, there was an element of deception in the Coventry Police’s actions.  The \nCoventry Police portrayed their actions as helpful to Coach Marchand in his predicament, in at \nleast appeasing the crowd and defusing a hostile situation.  (Ex. H, 28:2-5.)  However, as the \nofficers later admitted, that was not their true intention.  They had instead decided to determine if \nCoach Marchand was telling the truth about the players – and seek evidence against the boys to \nbe used against them.  (Ex. I, 77:1-4.) \n  31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 32 of 36 PageID #: 157\nUnder these circumstances, no “consent” to search can or should be considered valid.  \nThere are few situations more coercive than being held prisoner by an angry mob while the \npolice tacitly permit that imprisonment to continue.  Coach Marchand and his players had the \nsame right to police protection from wrongful imprisonment as anybody else on the campus.  \nNevertheless, that protection was withheld.  Instead, it was implied that protection could only be \nhad if there was a consent to a search.  For that reason, even if Coach Marchand were legally in \nthe position to give valid consent for a search of the boys as their coach, the consent that he did \ngive was hopelessly tainted by coercion. \nC.  THE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nON COUNT IV (INVASION OF PRIVACY). \n \n  The Defendants seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ state law invasion of privacy \nclaim on virtually the same grounds as they seek summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ § 1983 \nclaims.  They assert that that there can be no invasion of privacy claim for a constitutionally \npermissible search.  Furthermore, they assert that a qualified immunity similarly exists for \ngovernment officials in invasion of privacy complaint, citing Hatch v. Town of Middletown, 311 \nF.3d 83 (1st Cir. 2002), which in turn cited Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856 (R.I. 1997) and \nEnsey v. Culhane, 727 A.2d 687 (R.I. 1999).   \nDefendants overstate the effects of Hatch, Pontbriand, and Ensey.  As Hatch itself \nacknowledged, neither Pontbriand nor Ensey ever actually made any ruling on whether \n“qualified immunity” would be applied to claims brought against state officials under R.I.G.L. \n§ 9-1-28.1.  Hatch at 90.  Since Hatch, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has not yet had the \nopportunity to reach this issue of state law on its own.  In any case, as we have outlined above, \nthe Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity in this situation.  Therefore, their attempt \nto obtain summary judgment on this count must fail. \n  32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 33 of 36 PageID #: 158\n \nD.  THE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nON COUNT II (EQUAL PROTECTION). \n \n  The Defendants also attempt to obtain summary judgment on Count II of Plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint, a § 1983 claim for violation of their right to equal protection.  The Defendants claim \nthat they are entitled to summary judgment because there was no evidence that the Plaintiffs \nwere treated differently than others similarly situated based upon their race.  There is more than \nsufficient evidence to support a jury finding to the contrary. \nThe Defendants misstate the calculus applied in Equal Protection claims.  They rely \nheavily on the lack of direct evidence of discriminatory animus.  However, the courts readily \nrecognize that there is seldom any direct evidence of discriminatory animus in an Equal \nProtection case.  Therefore, intent to discriminate may be shown by circumstantial evidence.  \nJudge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 77 (1st Cir. 1998).   \n  The circumstantial evidence on the record supports an inference that the Plaintiffs were \nindeed singled out for different treatment than others similarly situated based upon their race.  \nThe Town of Coventry is predominately white, as was its school population at that time.  (Ex. E.)  \nThe Central Falls team, coming from an ethnically diverse community, with a team composition \nincluding a number of Hispanics, was alone singled out for a search.  (Ex. F.)  In fact, nobody \nbut the Central Falls team was even asked to agree to a search.  (Ex. I, 74:4-7.)  This was true \ndespite the fact that the Coventry Police were fully aware that although the crowd may have \ndecided that the Central Falls team were “prime suspects,” there was no rational basis for that \nbelief.  The Coventry Police admitted at deposition that virtually anybody in that crowd, \nincluding the Coventry students themselves, could have had access to the locker room and could \nhave stolen the items.  (Ex. I, 69:25-70:1; 70:4-7; Ex. J, 47:4-6; Ex. K, 46:2-5.)  In fact, the \n  33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 34 of 36 PageID #: 159\nevidence suggests that the Coventry Police were fully aware that the Central Falls players were \ninnocent, because the ones who had been in the locker room had been accompanied by a security \nguard the entire time.  (Ex. B, 57:18-58:14.)  Under these circumstances, it is virtually \nimpossible for the Coventry Police to state that they did not treat the Central Falls team \ndifferently than the Coventry students.   \nFurthermore, their explanation for that differential treatment is patently irrational.  At \ndeposition, the Coventry officers explained the differential in treatment by declaring that all of \nthe Coventry students were “victims.”  (Ex. I, 73:7-74:5.)  In light of the fact that the Coventry \nofficers also admitted that the Coventry students were just as much in a position to have taken \nthe items, these “reasons” for treating the Central Falls students differently are wholly unworthy \nof credence. \n  The Defendants also attempt to escape liability by claiming that the racial bias really \nstemmed from the crowd, rather than themselves.  This argument is a red herring.  While there is \nno direct evidence of racial bias on the part of the Coventry officers themselves, there is certainly \nevidence that they put their police powers at the disposal of a crowd that had a great deal of \nanimus towards the Plaintiffs based upon their race.  The crowd vociferously ascribed to the \nCentral Falls players the traits of dishonesty based upon their race, spat racial epithets, and \nrepeatedly demanded a search.  (Ex. D, 27:13-28:5; Ex. H, 24:15-25:25.)  As discussed in the \nSubsections above, the Coventry officers took no effective action to stop this harassment.  \nInstead, they worked to secure the very search that the crowd was demanding.  A government \nofficial who acquiesces to another’s demand that a racial minority receive less favorable \ntreatment must be deemed as guilty of an Equal Protection violation as an official who acts upon \n  34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-00123-S-DLM   Document 28    Filed 04/27/09   Page 35 of 36 PageID #: 160\na personally espoused racial hatred.  In such cases, whether the official personally shared the bias \nor not, the result is the same:  the disfavored minority was denied the equal protection of the law. \n  There is, then, more than sufficient circumstantial evidence on the record to support an \ninference that the Defendants treated Plaintiffs less favorably based upon race.  For that reason, \nDefendants cannot receive summary judgment. \n \nE.  THE DEFENDANTS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nON COUNTS V AND VI (RACIAL PROFILING AND \nRACIAL/NATIONAL ORIGIN INTIMIDATION). \n \n  In their quest to gain summary judgment on Counts V and VI, Defendants rely upon the \nsame arguments as made for the dismissal of the equal protection claims.  These arguments \nshould be equally unsuccessful on Counts V and VI. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n  For the above-referenced reasons, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment should be \nDENIED. \nPlaintiffs, \n              By their attorney, \n \n/s/ Stephen M. Robinson \nStephen M.

Welch  v. \nCiampa,  542  F.3d 927,  935  (Ist  Cir.  Mass.  2008).  Thus,  in  reviewing  a  motion \nfor  summary judgment,  this  Court,  like  the  District  Court,  does  not  ignore  relevant \nfacts  or  apply  unreasonable  conclusions  to  the  undisputed  facts. \nOn  September  28,  2006,  the  Central  Falls  High  School’s  men’s  soccer  team \nplayed  a  game  at  Coventry  High  School.  At  some  point,  some  of the  Central  Falls \nplayers  entered  the  High  School,  with  permission,  to  use  the  restrooms.  At  the  end \nof the  game,  members  of the  Coventry  football  team  accused  one  of the  plaintiffs \nof stealing  electronic  equipment  (ipod  and  cell  phone)  from  the  locker  room \nlocated  near  the  restrooms.  These  football  players  approached  the  Central  Falls \nsoccer  coach,  Robert  Marchand,  as  the  coach  was  leaving  the  field.  Deposition  of \nRobert Marchand,  (January  6,  2009),  at  18-19  (hereinafter  “Marchand  Tr.”’) \n(Plaintiff's  Appendix,  at  57  (hereinafter  “App.  at __”’).  The  plaintiffs  were  in  the \nparking  lot  getting  on  their  bus  when  the  Coventry  students  approached  the  coach \non  the  field.  Coach  Marchand  responded  by  telling  the  Coventry  players  “let’s  get\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:6  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  Entry  ID:  5419518 \nto  the  bottom  of this”  and  leading  the  Coventry  students  to  the  Central  Falls’s  bus. \nId.  at  19.  (App  at  57).  At  that  point  there  were  no  Coventry  students  around  the \nbus.  Jd.  at  20  (App.  at  57).  Coach  Marchand  made  the  Coventry  players  stop  a \nshort  distance  from  the  bus  and  then,  with  the  help  of his  assistant  coach,  went  on \nthe  bus  and  searched  the  plaintiffs’  equipment.  Jd.  at  21-22  (App.  at  5  to  58). \nCoach  Marchand  did  not  inform  his  players  what  he  was  doing  or  why  until  he  was \napproximately  halfway  done  with  the  search.  /d.  During  his  deposition,  Coach \nMarchand  explained  that  he  had  been  present  during  a  prior  incident  between \ndifferent  rivaling  schools  where  the  students  got  out  of control  resulting  in  a \n“brawl”.  Id.  at  13-15  (App.  at  56).  Coach  Marchand  thus  thought  it  was  best  and \nsafer  for  all  involved  to  try  to  quickly  diffuse  the  situation  by  searching  his  players \nhimself.  Jd. \nAfter  searching  all  the  players’  bags,  Coach  Marchand  determined  that \nplaintiffs  were  not  involved  in  the  alleged  theft.  When  Coach  Marchand  exited  the \nbus  to  advise  the  Coventry  students  that  he  had  found  nothing,  he  discovered  that \nthe  Coventry  Athletic  Director  had  arrived  and  that  the  group  of less  than  20 \nstudents  had  grown.  Coach  Marchand  spoke  directly  with  the  Athletic  Director \nand  advised  him  that  he  had  searched  the  players  and  was  satisfied  that  they  were \nnot  involved  in  the  theft.  Jd.  at  15  &  23  (App.  at  56  &  58).  Coach  Marchand\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:7   Date Filed:  02/22/2010  Entry  ID:  5419518 \noffered  to  let  the  Coventry  Athletic  Director  search  the  players  himself but  the \nAthletic  Director  declined.  Jd.  at]5  &  24  (App.  at  56  &  58  ). \nJust  as  Coach  Marchand  was  relaying  the  results  of his  search  to  Coventry’s \nAthletic  Director,  four  (4)  Coventry  police  officers  quickly  pulled  into  the  parking \nlot  with  lights  on.  In  their  summary  of facts,  plaintiffs  omit  the  undisputed  fact \nthat  the  Coventry  Police  Department  had  received  two  (2)  calls  that  there  were \nongoing  fights  in  the  parking  lot  between  the  two  teams  thus  explaining  the \nofficer’s  response.  /d.  at  15  (App.  at  56).  Upon  the  officers’  arrival,  the \nCoventry’s  Athletic  Director  and  Coach  Marchand  quickly  brought  them  up  to \nspeed  on  what  was  going  on  and  assured  them  that  there  was  no  fight.  Coach \nMarchand,  in  particular,  informed  the  officers  that  there  had  been  a  theft  in  the \nschool  and  that  his  players,  the  plaintiffs,  were  the  “prime  suspects.”  Jd.  at  27 \n(App.  at  59).  While  the  officers  were  speaking  with  Coach  Marchand,  some  of the \nspectators  started  making  various  comments  about  not  trusting  the  coach  and \ninsisting  that  the  plaintiffs  were  involved  in  the  theft.  Jd.  at  15-16  (App.  at  56). \nHowever,  Coach  Marchand  confirmed  that  each  time  such  statements  were  made, \neither  the  police  officers  or  the  Athletic  Director  would  tell  the  spectators  to  stop, \nquiet  down  and  that  the  officers  would  take  care  of things.  Jd.  at  16  &  27  (App.  at \n56  &  59).\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:8  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  Entry  ID:  5419518 \nCoach  Marchand  testified  that  after  he  told  the  police  officers  that  the \nplaintiffs  were  the  prime  suspects  but  that  he  conducted  a  search  and  was  satisfied \nthat  they  were  not  involved,  there  was  “a  pregnant  pause”  where  it  was  obvious  to \nCoach  Marchand  that  the  officers  were  trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do  next.  Jd.  at \n27  (App.  at  59).  According  to  Coach  Marchand,  one  of officers  then  asked  if the \nCoach  would  allow  the  officers  to  also  conduct  a  search.’  Coach  Marchand \nreadily  agreed  because  he  believed  that  it  was  best  to  have  his  players  names \ncleared  and  to  leave  the  area  for  the  safety  of the  plaintiffs.  Jd.  at  28  (App.  at  59). \nUnder  questioning  by  plaintiffs’  attorney,  Coach  Marchand  later  testified  that \ngiven  his  obligation  as  coach  and  “father”  to  the  plaintiffs,  he  thought  it  would  be \nbest  “take  the  high  road”  and  allow  the  officers  to  search  them  in  order  to  clear \ntheir  names.  Jd.  at  28,  32  &  44-45  (App.  at  59,  60  &  61-62).  In  response  to \nplaintiffs’  attorney’s  inquiry  as  to  the  “duress”  the  Coach  felt  in  giving  this \nconsent,  the  Coach  explained  that  the  duress  was  the  result  of the  crowd  around  the \nbus  and  the  uncertainty  of how  they  would  react.  Jd.  at  44-45  (App.  at  61-62). \nSergeant  Michailides  testified  that  if the  coach  had  not  consented  or  if the  plaintiffs \nthemselves  had  protested,  they  would  not  have  conducted  the  search.  Deposition  of \n  \n'  Although  not  material  for  purposes  of the  instant  motion,  the  officers  testified  that \nthey  did  not  ask  for  consent  to  search.  Rather,  it  was  Coach  Marchand  who  offered \nto  allow  the  officers  to  search  the  students.  Michailides  Tr.,  at  44  (App.  at  83). \n7\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:9  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  Entry  ID:  5419518 \nStephen  Michailides  (December  18,  2008),  at  47  (hereinafter  “Michailides  Tr.”) \n(App.  at  83). \nCoach  Marchand  then  instructed  his  players  to  allow  the  officers  to  look \nthrough  their  bags.  For  officer  safety,  the  officers  had  the  players  step  outside  the \nbus  and  conducted  a  search  by  looking  into  their  respective  bags  and  having  the \nstudents  turn  out  their  pockets.  Id.  at  48-49  (App.  at  83).  The  officers  completed \ntheir  search  and  did  not  find  the  missing  items.  The  officers  then  advised  the \nCoach  that  they  would  escort  the  Central  Falls’s  bus  from  the  school.  Marchand \nTr.,  at  31-32  (App.  at  60). \nAlthough  plaintiffs  allege  that  they  were  subject  to  racial  and  ethnic  slurs \nfrom  the  opposing  team  and  the  Coventry  bystanders,  the  plaintiffs  did  not  report \nthese  slurs  to  the  defendants  that  day.”  While  the  officers  confirmed  that  they \nheard  the  Coventry  spectators  yelling  accusations  of theft  at  the  Central  Falls \nplayers,  the  officers  themselves  never  heard  any  racial  slurs  against  the  plaintiffs. \nMichailides  Tr.,  at  41;  Deposition  of David Nelson  (December  17,  2008)(“Nelson \n  \n*  It  is  noteworthy  that  although  plaintiffs  spend  considerable  time  in  their  Brief \noutlining  the  racial  slurs  and  comments  made  during  the  soccer  game  and  before \nthe  officers’  arrival,  such  accusations  are  immaterial  to  the  instant  Motion.  A  fact \nis  'material'  if it  potentially  could  affect  the  suit's  outcome.  An  issue  concerning \nsuch  a  fact  is  'genuine'  if a  reasonable  fact  finder,  examining  the  evidence  and \ndrawing  all  reasonable  inferences  helpful  to  the  party  resisting  summary judgment, \ncould  resolve  the  dispute  in  that  party's  favor.\"  Cortes-Iriszarry  v.  Corporacion \nInsular  DeSeguros,  111  F.3d  184,  187  (1st  Cir.  1997)  (citations  omitted). \n \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  10  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nTr.”),  at  45.  Notably,  the  plaintiffs  do  not  allege  that  the  defendant  officers  used \nracial  or  ethnic  slurs  against  the  students.  In  support  of their  appeal,  plaintiffs  cite \nto  the  testimony  of the  students  on  the  bus  to  support  the  claim  that  the  spectators \nwere  yelling  racial  slurs  while  the  officers  were  present.  However,  Coach \nMarchand,  who  was  standing  next  to  the  officers  during  this  timeframe,  testified \nthat  although  the  spectators  were  accusing  the  players  of theft,  there  were  no  racial \nslurs  mixed  in  with  these  accusations.  Marchand  Tr.  at  45-46  (App.  at  62).  In \nfact,  according  to  Coach  Marchand  the  officers  were  courteous  and  professional \n“at  all  times”  and  repeatedly  told  the  bystanders  to  quiet  down.  Jd.  at  26,  27  and \n32  (App.  at  59  &60). \n  \nIn  this  case,  there  is  absolutely  no  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  the  officers \nwere  made  aware  of the  comments  and  tension  that  occurred  during  the  game.\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  11  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nSUMMARY  OF ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs,  all  former  soccer  players  for  Central  Falls  High  School, \nsubsequently  brought  suit  against  the  Town  of Coventry,  RI  and  several  individual \npolice  officers  seeking  to  recover  pursuant  to  $  /983  for  the  alleged  violation  of \nplaintiffs’  due  process  and  equal  protection  rights,  as  well  as  pursuant  to  R.I.’s \nRacial  Profiling  Act,  R.I.  Gen.  Laws  $  31-21.2  and  the  State’s  statute  against  ethnic \nintimidation,  R.J.  Gen.  Laws  §  9-1-35.  Plaintiffs  now  maintain  that  Coach \nMarchand  lacked  authority  to  consent  to  a  search  on  their  behalf and  that  the \nofficers’  actions  were  motivated  by  discriminatory  animus  towards  their  race. \nAfter  hearing,  the  District  Court  found  it  was  not  clearly  established  that  the  coach \nlacked  authority  to  consent  on  the  behalf of his  players  to  the  search  and  that  the \nofficers  would  not  reasonably  believe  that  they  would  be  violating  plaintiffs’  rights \nby  relying  upon  the  consent  to justify  the  search.  The  Court  also  found  that  the \nevidence  was  not  sufficient  to  warrant  a jury  finding  that  the  officers  acted \npursuant  to  discriminatory  animus  such  to  amount  to  a  violation  of plaintiffs’ \nEqual  Protection  rights.” \nDefendants  submit  the  District  Court  did  not  err  in  finding  that  defendants \nwere  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  from  plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claims. \nThe  touchstone  of whether  an  official  is  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  is  whether \n10\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  12  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nan  objectively  reasonable  officer,  standing  in  the  shoes  of these  officers,  would \nbelieve  that  their  actions  infringed  upon  a  clearly  established  right.  Although  the \nSupreme  Court  in  New  Jersey  v.  T.L.O.,  469  U.S.  325,  336  (1985)  had  found  that \n  \nschool  officials  are  state  actors  for  Fourth  Amendment  purposes  when  they \nconduct  a  search  of students,  since  the  issuance  of 7.L.O.,  courts  have  had  an \nopportunity  to  address  school  personnel’s  in  /oco parentis  standing  in  various \ncircumstances  with  varying  results.  As  outlined  below,  this  Court  itself has \nrecognized  that  acting  in  loco parentis,  school  personnel  seeking  to  promote  the \nbest  interest  of a  child  suspected  of being  the  victim  of abuse,  did  not  infringe  upon \nthe  student’s  Fourth  Amendment  right  to  be  free  from  unlawful  seizure  by \ntransferring  the  student  to  another  school  for  questioning  by  state  social  workers. \nWojcik v.  Town  of North  Smithfield,  76 F.3d  1,  3  (Ist  Cir.  1996). \n  \nMoreover,  in  determining  if a  right  is  clearly  established,  the  Court  must \nlook  to  the  contours  of the  right  in  a  more  particular  setting  rather  than  on  a  general \nlevel.  In  this  case,  unlike  7.L.O.  and  the  other  cases  cited  by  plaintiffs,  the \nplaintiffs  were  under  the  supervision  of their  coach,  off-campus,  several  miles \naway  from  their  school.  Coach  Marchand  testified  that  it  was  his  obligation  as  a \n“father”  to  the  students  in  this  circumstance  that  prompted  in  part  his  decision  to \nconsent  to  a  search  in  order  to  quickly  resolve  the  situation.  Defendants  submit \n  \n*  Plaintiffs  have  not  appealed  the  District  Court’s  finding  that  there  were  no  facts  to \n1]\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  13  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nthat  in  light  of the  case  law  identifying  various  circumstances  in  which  courts  have \nrecognized  a  level  of authority  by  school  personnel  to  act  on  behalf of students,  as \nwell  as  the  unique  circumstances  of this  case,  it  cannot  be  said  that  reasonable \nofficers  would  believe  that  their  actions  violated  a  clearly  established  right. \nThe  expressed  concern  by  plaintiffs  of the  future  implications  of the  District \nCourt  decision,  coupled  with  the  stated  desire  by  the  amicus  curiae  brief offered  by \nthe  R.I.  American  Civil  Liberties  Union,  for  the  Court  to  offer  guidance  to  police \npersonnel  in  this  area,  further  demonstrates  a  lack  of clarity  on  the  issue.  Quite \nsimply,  if the  law  is  so  clearly  established  to  put  these  officers  on  notice  that  their \nactions  infringed  upon  plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights,  there  would  be  no  need  to \nclarify  the  issue  or  offer  guidance. \nPlaintiffs  further  claim  that  even  if the  coach  could  consent  on  behalf of the \nstudents,  a  material  factual  issue  as  to  whether  the  consent  was  voluntary  precluded \nthe  entry  of summary judgment.  In  the  first  instance,  the  determination  of whether \nconsent  was  coerced  “is  based,  not  on  the  perceptions  of the  individual  searched, \nbut  on  the  the  coerciveness  of the  officer's  conduct  in  obtaining  the  consent.”  U.S. \nv.  Quezada,  1991  U.S.  App.  LEXIS 22712  (4th  Cir.  1991)  (unpublished per  curiam \nopinion).  In  this  case,  Coach  Marchand  testified  that  the  officers  did  nothing,  other \nthan  not  taking  his  word  that  players  did  not  have  the  contraband,  to  coerce  his \n  \nsupport  the  claims  against  the  City  and  supervisory  personnel. \n12\n4  P SwAae8 NeSs.~~    YMS YA PSh a Us eSeS8  8KSah8 eS S   rDBFN  oASc u.

Although  Coach  Marchand  testified  that  he  was  under  “duress”  from  the \npresence  of the  crowd,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  officers  said  or  did  anything \nto  coerce  this  consent. \nDefendants  further  submit  that  there  is  no  basis  to  find  that  the  officers  acted \nout  of discriminatory  animus  against  plaintiffs’  race  such  to  warrant  a  finding  that \nplaintiffs’  Equal  Protections  rights  or  rights  under  R.I.’s  Racial  Profiling  and \nRacial/National  Origin  Intimidation  statutes  were  violated.  First,  plaintiffs  pointed \nto  absolutely  no  evidence  that  would  support  the  conclusion  that  the  defendant \nofficers  knew  the  plaintiffs’  race  at  the  time  they  sought  permission  to  conduct  the \nsearch.  In  addition,  although  plaintiffs  recite  various  racial  slurs  and  derogatory \ncomments  made  by  the  Coventry  soccer  team  during  the  game  and  members  of the \ncrowd  after  the  game,  it  is  undisputed  that  the  officers  did  not  say  anything  that \nwould  give  rise  to  an  inference  of discriminatory  animus.  Plaintiffs  nevertheless \nseek  to  impute  the  crowd’s  perceived  prejudice  upon  the  officers.  As  outlined \nbelow,  there  is  simply  no  factual  or  legal  support  to  transfer  such  animus  onto  the \nofficers  or  to  conclude  that  it  motivated  their  decision  to  seek  consent  to  search  the \nstudents.  As  such,  the  District  Court  correctly  held  that  defendants  were  entitled  to \nsummary judgment  on  plaintiffs’  equal  protection  and  state  law  claims. \nIn  the  final  analysis,  although  the  Court  may  question  whether  the  officers’ \nhandling  of the  dispute  was  the  best  solution,  as  a  matter  of law,  it  cannot  be  said \n13\nAWA  Iga  eee  cet  AMS  44  BOO  ~.

Defendants  Are  Entitled  To  Qualified  Immunity \nDefendants  submit  that  the  District  Court  correctly  found  that  the  defendants \nwere  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  from  the  instant  suit.  In  the  instant  case, \nplaintiffs  first  alleged  that  their  right  to  be  free  from  unlawful  search  and  seizure \nwas  violated  by  the  officers.  Of course,  “an  established  exception”  to  the  Fourth \nAmendment  requirements  is  a  search  that  is  conducted  pursuant  to  consent. \nSchneckloth  v.  Bustamonte,  412  U.S.  218,  219  (1973);  U.S.  v.  Vilches-Navarrete, \n     \n523  F.3d  1,  15  (1st  Cir.  2008).  The  District  Court  found  that  in  light  of Coach \nMarchand’s  consent  to  search  the  plaintiffs,  the  defendant  officers  are  entitled  (at  a \nminimum)  to  qualified  immunity  from  plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claim.*  In \nreaching  this  holding,  the  District  Court  noted  that  the  clarity  of the  law  at  the  time \nwas  not  such  that  a  reasonable  officer  standing  in  the  shoes  of these  officers  would \nbelieve  that  relying  on  Coach  Marchand’s  consent  would  violate  plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  rights. \nOn  appeal,  plaintiffs  seek  to  reverse  the  District  Court’s  holding  based \nprimarily  on  the  position  that  it  was  “clearly  established”  that  a  school  coach \nlacked  authority  to  consent  to  the  search  of high  school  players  while  the  team  was \n  \n*  The  District  Court  also  recognized  that  consent  from  a  third  party  with  apparent \nauthority  to  provide  the  consent  is  a  valid  exception  to  the  Fourth  Amendment \nrestrictions.

Wel a ea  ie \nat  an  away  game.  However,  defendants  submit  that  the  determination  of whether \na  particular  officer  is  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  requires  more  analysis  than \nsimply  the  determination,  on  the  general  level  suggested  by  plaintiffs,  that  a  right  is \n“clearly  established”  without  further  consideration  of whether  a  reasonable  officer \nwould  have  understood  that  his  conduct  in  that  particular  circumstance  violated \nsuch  aright.  In  the  instant  case,  for  the  reasons  outlined  herein,  not  only  was  it  not \nas  Clearly  established  as  plaintiffs’  suggest  that  the  coach  lacked  authority  to \nconsent  to  the  search  of his  players  at  an  off-campus  game,  it  nevertheless  cannot \nbe  said  that  a  reasonable  officer  in  the  shoes  of these  officers  would  have \nunderstood  that  these  actions  infringed  upon  the  plaintiffs’  rights.  Accordingly,  the \nDistrict  Court’s  entry  of summary judgment  in  favor  of defendants  should  be \naffirmed. \nA.  THE ALLEGED  INABILITY OF  COACH  MARCHAND  TO  CONSENT  ON \nBEHALF  OF  HIS  PLAYERS  DURING AN OFF-CAMPUS  GAME  WAS  NOT  SO \nCLEAR THAT  A REASONABLE  OFFICER  STANDING IN THE  SHOES  OF  THESE \nDEFENDANTS  WOULD  KNOW THAT  HIS/HER CONDUCT  VIOLATED \nPLAINTIFFS’  CONSTITUTIONAL  RIGHTS \nOf course,  the  starting  point  in  the  instant  case  is  the  well-settled  standard \nfor  determining  if a  governmental  official  is  entitled  to  the  protections  of qualified \nimmunity.  Recently  this  Court  reaffirmed  that  “[t]o  determine  whether  a  particular \nofficer  is  entitled  to  qualified  immunity,  ‘[a]  court  must  decide:  (1)  whether  the \nfacts  alleged  or  shown  by  the  Plaintiff make  out  a  violation  of a  constitutional \n16\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  18  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nright;  and  (2)  if so,  whether  the  right  was  'clearly  established’  at  the  time  of the \ndefendant's  alleged  violation.\"  Maldonado  v.  Fontanes,  568  F.3d 263,  269  (Ist  Cir. \n  \n2009).  The  second  step  has  two  aspects:  (1)  \"the  clarity  of the  law  at  the  time  of \nthe  alleged  civil  rights  violation\"  and  (2)  whether,  on  the  facts  of the  case,  \"a \n  \nreasonable  defendant  would  have  understood  that  his  conduct  violated  the \n  \nPlaintiffs'  constitutional  rights.\"\" 16  Jd.  (emphasis  added);  see  also Anderson  v. \n  \nCreighton,  483  U.S.  635,  640  (1987)  (\"[To  overcome  qualified  immunity,  t]he \ncontours  of the  right  must  be  sufficiently  clear  that  a  reasonable  official  would \nunderstand  that  what  he  is  doing  violates  that  right.\").  “Thus  if a  reasonable \nofficial  would  not  have  understood  that  his  conduct  violated  Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  rights.  .  .  [they]  must”  be  granted  qualified  immunity.  Estrada  v. \nRI,  2010  U.S.  App.  LEXIS 2390,  14-15  (1st  Cir.  2010). \nDefendants  submit  that,  given  the  state  of the  law  regarding  the  coach’s  in \nloco parentis  standing,  a  reasonable  officer  would  not  have  understood  that  relying \nupon  the  coach’s  consent  violated  plaintiffs’  constitutional  rights.  In  support  of the \n  \n>  This  Circuit  has  previously  articulated  qualified  immunity  analysis  as  a  three-part \ntest.  See,  i.e.,  Bergeron  y.  Carbral,  560  F.3d  1,  7  (1°  Cir.  2009).  However, \n  \nrecently,  this  Court  adopted  the  “[Supreme  Court’s]  two-part  test  and  abandoned \n[the]  previous  usage  of a  three-step  analysis.”  Estrada  v.  State  of Rhode  Island, \n2010  U.S.  App.  LEXTS 2390  (1st  Cir.  2010),  n.  14_citing Maldonado,  568  F.3d at \n269. \n°  As  discussed  infra,  the  Supreme  Court  has  granted  lower  courts  the  discretion  to \n“put  to  the  side”  the  first  step  of this  analysis  and  move  on  to  determine  whether \n17\n  \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  19  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \ninstant  appeal,  plaintiffs  rely  primarily  upon New  Jersey  v.  T.L.O.,  469  U.S.  325, \n  \n336  (1985)  for  the  claim  that  the  right  was  clearly  established  such  to  deny \ndefendants  qualified  immunity.  However,  in  focusing  on  7.L.O.,  plaintiffs  miss  the \nmark  by  failing  to  take  into  consideration  its  progeny.’ \nAs  recognized  by  the  District  Court,  since  the  issuance  of 7.Z.O.,  courts \nhave  had  an  opportunity  to  address  school  personnel’s  in  /oco parentis  standing  in \nvarious  circumstances  with  varying  results.  As  very  recently  held  by  the  Supreme \nCourt  \"[t]raditionally  at  common  law,  and  still  today,  unemancipated  minors  lack \nsome  of the  most  fundamental  rights  of self-determination  ....  They  are  subject.  . \n.  to  the  control  of their  parents  or  guardians.  When  parents  place  minor  children  in \nprivate  schools  for  their  education,  the  teachers  and  administrators  of those  schools \nstand  in  loco parentis  over  the  children  entrusted  to  them.\"  Morse  v.  Frederick, \n  \nS51  U.S.  393  (2007) (emphasis  added) (holding  that  schools  were  entitled  to  take \nsteps  to  safeguard  those  entrusted  to  their  care from  speech  that  could reasonably \n  \nthe  claimed  constitutional  right  is  clearly  established.

Laws  §  16-21.5-1  et  seq.,  in  particular,  §  16- \n21,5-3  further  supports  the  diminished  role  of school  officials  in  the  face  of police \ninterrogations.  Plaintiffs  reliance  on  $  /6-2/.5-1  et  seg.  is  misplaced  first  because \nit  involved  police  interrogations,  not  searches.  In  addition,  rather  than  diminish  the \nin  loco  parentis  role  of school  officials,  the  statute  reaffirms  their  parental  role  in \nthe  absence  of such  a  guardian  or  parent.  Specifically,  $  /6-2/.5-2  provides  that  if \na  parent  or  guardian  is  unavailable,  “a  school  administrator,  school  counselor,  or \nschool  teacher  who  is  reasonably  available  and  selected  by  the  pupil,  shall  be \npresent  during  the  questioning.” \n18\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  20  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nbe  regarded as  encouraging  illegal  drug  use)  quoting  Vernonia  Sch.

In  Vernonia,  the \nSupreme  Court  explained  that  a  teacher,  who  is  in  loco parentis,  “has  such  a \nportion  of the  power  of the  parent  committed  to  his  charge,  viz.  that  of restraint  and \ncorrection,  as  may  be  necessary  to  answer  the  purposes  for  which  he  is  employed.\" \nVernonia  Sch.

Those \ncircumstances,  as  recognized  by  plaintiffs  themselves,  include  dangers  to  student \nsafety  and  disruption  to  general  school  discipline  due  to  illegal  drug  use. \nPlaintiffs’  Brief  at  35. \nIn  finding  that  the  case  law  presented  a  “lack  of clarity  on  the  issue”,  the \nDistrict  Court  also  cited  to  a  number  of Circuit  Court  cases  that  have  utilized  the  in \nloco parentis  doctrine  since  7.L.O.  in  such  a  way  that  would  give  rise  to  the \n19\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  21  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nreasonable  belief that  the  coach  possessed  such  authority.

No.  08-123S),  at  15  (Addendum  to  Plaintiffs’  Brief.”  \\n \nHampton,  for  example,  the  Fifth  Circuit  relied  upon  an  administrator’s  in  loco \nparentis  standing  to  support  the  conclusion  that  a  school  administrator  qualified  as \na  “guardian  or  custodian”  of a  student  under  Mississippi’s  statute  governing  youth \nrecords.  Hampton,  480  F.3d at  36.  In  that  case,  the  police  had  arrived  at  school  to \nexecute  a juvenile  arrest  warrant.

The  Director \nthen  had  staff retrieve  the  student  from  class  and  turned  him  over  to  the  officer. \nReasoning  that  under  Mississippi’s  youth  record  statute,  only  a  parent  or  guardian \nhad  authority  to  demand  to  view  the  warrant,  the  officers  subsequently  charged  the \ndirector  with  obstructing  a  police  officer.  The  charges,  however,  were \nsubsequently  dismissed  based  on  the  finding  that  the  Director’s  in  loco parentis \nposition  to  the  student  qualified  him  as  a  “guardian  or  custodian”  in  the  absence  of \n  \n*  Hampton,  480  F.3d at  362;  Ramos  v.

Jd. \nThis  Circuit  has  also  recognized  that  school  officials  act  in  loco parentis \nwith  students  in  determining  their  best  interests  when  dealing  with  other \ngovernmental  entities.  In  Wojcik v.  Town  of North  Smithfield,  76 F.3d  1,  3  (Ist \nCir.  1996),  certain  statements  and  actions  by  two  (2)  sisters  gave  rise  to  the \nschool’s  suspicion  that  the  students  had  been  abused  by  their  parents.  After \nreporting  the  concerns  to  the  R.I.  Department  of Children,  Youth  and  their \nFamilies  (DCYF),  the  school  officials  decided  to  drive  one  sister  from  her  school \nto  her  sister’s  school  in  order  that  the  two  (2)  could  be  questioned  by  DCYF \ntogether.  The  school  officials  explained  that  they  thought  the  younger  sister  would \nfeel  more  comfortable  being  in  the  presence  of her  older  sister  during  the \nquestioning.  /d.  The  parents  subsequently  brought  suit  against  the  school  officials \nfor  inter  alia  unreasonable  seizure  resulting  from  the  transfer  of the  child  to \nanother  school  for  the  interview.  In  rejecting  the  §  1983  claim  both  on  the  merits \nand  the  qualified  immunity  grounds,  this  Court  held  that  it  could  not  find  that  it \nwas  “unreasonable  for  the  school,  acting  in  loco parentis,  to  move  one  of the \nchildren  from  one  school  to  another  school  in  the  vicinity”  in  order  to  facilitate  the \nquestioning  by  DCYF.  Jd.  This  Court  specifically  cited  to  the  school  officials’ \n  \nCharlottesville,  159  F.3d 843,  861  (4  Cir.  1998);  Knox  Cty.  Educ.  Ass’nv.  Knox \n  \n21\n  \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  23  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nunderlying  rationale  that  it  was  in  the  best  interest  of the  younger  child  to  be  in  her \nsister’s  presence  during  potentially  emotional  questioning.  Jd. \nThese  cases,  along  with  the  others  cited  by  the  District  Court,  support  a \nreasonable  belief on  the  part  of the  attending  officers  that  Coach  Marchand,  who  it \nis  undisputed,  otherwise  serves  in  loco parentis  to  the  students,  possessed  the \nauthority  to  consent  on  the  students’  behalf during  an  away  game  in  the \ncircumstances  presented.  This  authority  is  buttressed  by  the  recognition  that  the \ncoach  had  taken  the  students  off school  grounds  and  out  of city  limits  for  a  school \nevent.  Unlike  the  cases  cited  by  plaintiffs,  wherein  the  school  official’s  interaction \nwith  the  students  is  limited  to  the  school  building  itself,  Coach  Marchand’s \nresponsibility  for  his  players  is  even  broader  when  the  players  are  taken  off- \ncampus  in  his  care.  In  fact,  Coach  Marchand  testified  that  he  felt  a  special \nresponsibility  to  make  the  right  decision  for  the  plaintiffs  to  protect  their  safety. \nAs  noted,  in  determining  whether  an  official  is  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity,  \"[a]  defendant's  acts  are  held  to  be  objectively  reasonable  unless  all \nreasonable  officials  in  the  defendant's  circumstances  would  have  then  known  that \nthe  defendant's  conduct  violated  the  United  States  Constitution  or  the  federal \nstatute  as  alleged  by  the  plaintiff.\"  Thompson  v.

Caron,  142 \n  \nF.3d  12,  15  (Ist  Cir.  1998)  citing Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  814-15 \n  \n(1982).  The  Court  has  observed  that  the  \"qualified  immunity  standard  ‘gives  ample \nroom  for  mistaken judgments’  by  protecting’  all  but  the  plainly  incompetent  or \nthose  who  knowingly  violate  the  law.\"  Rivera  v.  Murphy,  979  F.2d 259,  263  (Ist \n  \nCir.  1992)  quoting Hunter  v.  Bryant,  502  U.S.  224,  229  (1991). \n  \nIn  the  instant  case,  the  officers  clearly  do  not  fall  within  the  category  of \nbeing  “plainly  incompetent  or  knowingly  violating  the  law.”  Jd.  When  the  officers \narrived  not  only  did  Coach  Marchand  inform  them  that  his  players  were  the  “prime \nsuspects”  in  the  theft  but  he  also  advised  them  that  he  had  searched  the  players  and \ndid  not  find  the  stolen  items.  Marchand  Tr.,  at  27  (App.  at  59).  The  coach  also \nunequivocally  testified  that  it  was  his  obligation  as  coach  and  “father”  to  the \nplaintiffs  to  make  the  best  decision  on  their  behalf and  thus  he  agreed  to  allow  the \nofficers  to  conduct  their  own  search  for  the  missing  items. \nIn  light  of the  circumstances  presented  to  the  officers,  it  is  simply  was  not  so \n“clearly  established”  that  Coach  Marchand  lacked  authority  to  consent  on  behalf of \nhis  student  players  while  chaperoning  them  to  an  away  game,  such  that  a \n23\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  25  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nreasonable  officer  would  believe  that  they  were  infringing  upon  plaintiffs’  rights. \nIn  fact,  in  this  case,  the  coach  himself believed  he  had  the  authority  and,  perhaps \nobligation,  to  make  the  decision  on  behalf of his  players  to  quickly  clear  his \nplayers  of suspicion.  Even  though  the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  in  certain \ncircumstances,  school  officials  lose  their  in  /oco parentis  standing  and  become \nstate  actors  under  Fourth  Amendment  standards,  that  level  of analysis  is \ninsufficient  in  determining  if the  officers  are  entitled  to  qualified  immunity  in  the \ninstant  case.  “The  relevant  inquiry  is  whether  it  would  be  clear  to  a  reasonable \nofficer  that  his  conduct  would  be  unlawful  in  the  situation  he  confronted,  and  this \ninquiry  must  be  taken  in  light  of the  case's  specific  context,  not  as  a  broad  general \nproposition.”  Buchanan  v.  Maine,  469  F.3d  158,  169  (1\"  Cir.  2006)  citing  Saucier \n  \nv.  Katz,  533  U.S.  194,  201-02  (2001).  Simply  put,  a  reasonable  officer  in  the  place \nof these  officers  would  not  have  believed  that  their  actions  infringed  upon \nplaintiffs’  clearly  established  rights.’  As  such,  the  defendants  are  entitled  to \nqualified  immunity. \n  \n°  Plaintiffs  further  argue  that  qualified  immunity  should  be  denied  because  at  least \none  of the  officers  knew  no  basis  to  conduct  the  search.  Plaintiffs  maintain  that \none  officer  told  the  students  that  the  search  was  “stupid”  because  the  students  were \nwatched  while  in  the  locker  room.  However,  even  if accepted  as  an  undisputed \nfact,  \"the  Supreme  Court  has  held  that  an  officer's  subjective  belief is  not \ndispositive  of whether  probable  cause  existed.\"  U.S.  v.

On  appeal,  plaintiffs \nspecifically  argue  that  the  District  Court’s  decision  has  “disturbing  implications  for \nthe  future  of students’  Fourth  Amendment  rights”  because  police  could  conspire  to \ndo  an  “end  run”  around  warrant  requirements  by  conspiring  with  school  officials  to \nobtain  their  consent  to  search  students.  Plaintiffs’  Brief,  at  38.  The  Rhode  Island \nAffiliate  of the  American  Civil  Liberties  Union  (“ACLU”)  also  offers  an  amici \nbrief challenging  the  District  Court’s  decision  to  address  and  decide  the \ndefendants’  entitlement  to  qualified  immunity  based  upon  the  second  prong  of \nqualified  immunity  analysis.  The  ACLU  argues  in  part  that  by  failing  to  address \nwhether  a  constitutional  violation  occurred,  the  District  Court  left  the  door  open  for \nfuture  violations.  Amicus  Curiae  Brief of ACLU  (“ACLU’s  Amicus  Brief”),  at  6. \nFirst  and  foremost,  the  determination  as  to  whether  an  official  is  entitled  to \nqualified  immunity  is  not  based  upon a  third-party’s  interpretation  of the  decision \ngranting  the  official  immunity.  Rather,  it  is  based  upon  the  clarity  of the  law  at  the \ntime  of the  incident  and  whether  a  reasonable  officer  would  interpret  his  or  her \n  \n.  custody  by proving probable  cause.\").  Rather,  for  the  purposes  of qualified \nimmunity,  [the  court]  look[s]  to  the  objective  perspective  of a  reasonable  officer \nand  inquires  whether  given  all  the  facts  in  the  record,  that  officer  would  have \nbelieved  that  he  was  not  violating  the  Plaintiffs’  Constitutional  rights  in  taking  the \naction  at  issue.”  Estrada,  2010  U.S.  App.  LEXIS 2390  at  21-22. \n25\n  \nwAy eNeN  =  YWO NA PSh a a2 Pd RQV KgRhees    PPBAP aMc ios uAeErP enEeN te:e ST EN  OSXRESAfSA  S O O  YaP4 HMAA oOrs ARTPSAAASGO    eB§ ya CrAnNAaN:S.

If the \nclaimed  right  was  not  so  clearly  established  such  to  put  a  reasonable  officer  on \nnotice  that  his/her  actions  violated  that  right,  the  officer  is  entitled  to  qualified \nimmunity  regardless  of whether  third  parties,  in  the  future,  may  misinterpret  the \nwritten  decision. \nIn  any  event,  even  if it  is  an  element  to  take  into  consideration  in \ndetermining  whether  an  official  was  entitled  to  qualified  immunity,  the  concerns \nraised  by  both  plaintiffs  and  the  ACLU  actually  help  demonstrate  that  it  is  not \nclearly  established  that  the  coach  lacked  authority  to  consent  on  behalf of his \nplayers.  The  ACLU  specifically  opines  that  by  declining  to  make  a  determination \nas  to  whether  the  coach  could  give  police  consent  to  search  his  players  in  this  type \nof circumstances,  the  District  Court  is  “leaving  the  law  unsettled  and  unarticulated \nin  that  regard.”  ACLU’s  Amicus  Brief,  at  3.  Although  the  ACLU  maintains  on  the \none  hand  that  the  law  is  clearly  established,  it  argues  that  the  District  Court  should \nhave  first  addressed  whether  a  constitutional  right  has  been  violated  because  it  is \n“essential  to  clarify”  this  area  of the  law  to  put  officers  “on  notice”  that  the  conduct \nviolates  the  law.  /d.  at  3  &  12.  The  plaintiffs’  own  concerns  as  to  the  future \nimplications  of the  District  Court’s  decision  also  demonstrate  a  lack  of clarity  in \nthis  area  of the  law.  It  reasons  that  if the  law  was  so  clearly  established,  the \n26\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  28  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nprecedential  value  of this  case  would  be  meaningless  in  the  face  of the  clearly \nestablished  law.\"° \nFor  all  these  reasons,  defendants  respectfully  submit  that  the  defendants  are \nentitled  to  qualified  immunity  from  plaintiffs’  Fourth  Amendment  claims.  As  such \nthe  District  Court  did  not  err  in  granting  defendants  summary judgment  and  thus \nthe  District  Court judgment  should  be  affirmed. \nB.  DISTRICT  COURT  PROPERLY EXERCISED  ITS  SOUND  DISCRETION UNDER \nPEARSON \nAs  noted,  the  ACLU  has  filed  an  amicus  curiae  brief challenging  the  District \nCourt’s  decision  to  address  and  decide  the  instant  controversy  based  on  the  clearly \nestablished  prong  of the  qualified  immunity  analysis.  As  recognized  by  the \nDistrict  Court,  in  Pearson  v.  Callahan,  129  S.  Ct.  808,  818  (2009),  the  Supreme \n  \nCourt  ruled  that  the  Court  need  not  take  the  two  steps  of qualified  immunity \nanalysis  in  \"strict  sequence.\"  Lopera  v.  Town  of Coventry,  (C.A.  No.  08-1238),  at \n  \nS  (Addendum  to  Plaintiffs’  Brief).  See  also  Estrada  v.  RI.,  2010  U.S.  App.  LEXIS \n  \n'°  Yet  another  red  herring  is  the  plaintiffs’  challenge  to  the  manner  in  which  the \nsearch  was  conducted.  Plaintiffs  specifically  criticize  the  officers’  decision  to \nconduct  the  search  alongside  the  school  bus  and  not  within  the  confines  of the \nschool  bus.  However,  once  the  officers  received  consent  to  search,  the  manner  in \nwhich  they  executed  that  search  cannot  be  found  to  void  such  consent.  In  fact,  this \nCourt  has  consistently  held  that,  while  engaging  in  legitimate  investigative \nconduct,  \"the  police  may  take  reasonable  steps  to  protect  themselves  by  searching  a \nsuspect  for  weapons  or  taking  other protective  measures.\"  Estrada,  2010  U.S.  App. \nLEXIS 2390  (emphasis  added)  quoting  U.S.  v.  Taylor,  162  F.3d,  12,  17  (1st  Cir. \n1998)  and Flowers  v.  Fiore,  359  F.3d 24,  30  (Ist  Cir.  2004). \n  \n27\n  \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  29  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \n2390,  14-15  (1st  Cir.  2010).  Rather,  according  to  the  Supreme  Court,  Courts \n“should  exercise  their  sound  discretion  in  deciding  which  of the  two  prongs  of the \nqualified  immunity  analysis  [as  outlined  in  Saucier]  should  be  addressed  first  in \nlight  of the  circumstances  in  the  particular  case  at  hand.”  Pearson,  129  S.Ct.  S08, \nSIS  modifying  Saucier  v.  Katz,  533  U.S.  194  (2001).  Thus,  in  addressing \ndefendants’  claim  of qualified  immunity,  the  Court  does  not  need  to  first  determine \nwhether  a  constitutional  right  has  been  violated. \nIn  the  instant  case,  after  careful  analysis,  the  District  Court  exercised  his \n“sound  discretion”  and  determined  that  the  prudent  approach  was  to  address  the \nreasonableness  of the  officers’  actions  under  the  clearly  established  prong  of \nqualified  immunity  analysis,  leaving  “to  the  side”  the  question  of whether  an  actual \nconstitutional  violation  occurred.  Lopera,  (C.A.  No.  08-1238),  at  1].  The  District \nCourt  reasoned  that  the  instant  case  involving  Fourth  Amendment  reasonableness \nanalysis  was  governed  by  two  (2)  areas  of law:  not  only  the  actual  authority  of \nCoach  Marchand  to  consent  on  behalf of his  players  but  also  the  reasonableness  of \nthe  officer’s  belief in  Coach  Marchand’s  “apparent  authority.”  Jd.  at  10  citing \nIllinois  v.  Rodriguez,  497  U.S.  177,  185-86  (1990)  and  U.S.  vy.  Carrasco,  540  F.3d \n  \n  \n43,  49  (1\"  Cir.  2008).  While  opining  that  it  was  a  close  call  as  to  whether  a \nconstitutional  violation  occurred,  the  Court  reasoned  that  because  the \ndetermination  of whether  a  constitutional  violation  occurred  could  also  be  dictated \n28\n     \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  30  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nby  the  reasonableness  of the  officer’s  belief in  the  apparent  authority  of the  coach, \na  more  prudent  approach  was  to  address  the  reasonableness  of the  officers’  actions \nunder  the  clearly  established  prong.  Jd. \nThe  ACLU  has  submitted  an  amicus  curiae  brief arguing  that  by  deciding \nthe  instant  matter  under  the  clearly  established  prong,  the  District  Court  “missed  an \nimportant  opportunity  to  give  guidance  to  local  police  and  school  departments  on  a \nsignificant  issue  of constitutional  law.”  ACLU’s  Amicus  Brief,  at  6.  The  ACLU \ntakes  the  position  that  a  determination  of the  constitutionality  of the  officers’ \nactions,  while  not  necessarily  dispositive  of the  instant  case,''  is  “necessary  to  put \npolice  and  school  officials  on  notice  that  the  challenged  conduct  violates  the \nFourth  Amendment  and  deter  similar  violations.”  /d.  at  /2. \nDefendants  submit  that  the  District  Court  properly  exercised  its  discretion  in \nputting  the  constitutional  issue  to  one  side  and  deciding  the  instant  matter  on  the \n“clearly  established  prong.”  In  addition  to  the  reasoning  articulated  by  the  District \nCourt,  the  rationale  proffered  by  the  ACLU  does  not justify  disturbing  the  Court’s \ndiscretionary  approach.  First,  as  noted  by  the  Supreme  Court,  there  are  several \nadditional  reasons  for  taking  the  analysis  out  of sequence  including  “the  \"older, \n  \n''  As  more  fully  outlined  above,  the  fact  that  the  ACLU  expresses  the  need  for \n“clarification”  of the  law  and  a  determination  as  to  the  constitutionality  of the \nofficers’  actions  supports  a  finding  of qualified  immunity  based  on  the  fact  that  the \nlaw  was  not  clearly  defined.  That  is,  that  a  reasonable  officer  would  not  believe \nthat  his/her  actions  infringed  upon  a  clearly  established  constitutional  right. \n29\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:31  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nwiser judicial  counsel  'not  to  pass  on  questions  of constitutionality  ...  unless  such \nadjudication  is  unavoidable.\"  Pearson,  129  S.  Ct.  at  821]  quoting  Scott  v.  Harris \n550  U.S.  372,  388  (2007)  (Breyer,  J.,  concurring)  (quoting  Spector  Motor  Service, \n  \nInc.  v.  McLaughlin,  323  U.S.  101,  105  (1944))  and Ashwander  v.  TVA,  297  U.S. \n  \n288,  347  (1936)  (Brandeis,  J.,  concurring)  (\"The  Court  will  not pass  upon  a \nconstitutional  question  although properly presented  by  the  record,  if there  is  also \npresent  some  other  ground  upon  which  the  case  may  be  disposed  of\").  In  this  case, \nas  evident  from  the  District  Court  decision,  the  constitutional  question  does  not \nneed  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  resolve  the  instant  dispute,  thus justifying,  in  the \nfirst  instance,  the  decision  to  put  the  issue  to  one  side. \nThe  ACLU  nevertheless  argues  that  the  issue  should be  addressed  in  order  to \nprovide  guidance  to  police  officers  who  may  encounter  similar  circumstances  in \nfuture  cases.  The  problem  with  this  approach  lies  in  the  nature  of a  Fourth \nAmendment,  illegal  search  claim.  As  this  Court  itself has  recognized,  the \nconstitutionality  of defendants’  actions  in  Fourth  Amendment  cases  “is  highly \nidiosyncratic  and  heavily  dependent  on  the  facts.\"  Buchanan  v.  Maine,  469  F.3d at \n  \n168  citing Riverdale  Mills  Corp.  v.  Pimpare,  392  F.3d 55  (Ist  Cir.  2004).  At  the \nsummary judgment  stage,  “the  precise  factual  basis  for  the  plaintiff's  claim  or \nclaims  may  be  hard  to  identify  ...  Accordingly,  several  courts  have  recognized \nthat  the  two-step  inquiry  \"is  an  uncomfortable  exercise  where  .  .  .  the  answer  [to| \n30\n     \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  32  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nwhether  there  was  a  violation  may  depend  on  a  kaleidoscope  of facts  not  yet  fully \ndeveloped.\"  Pearson,  129  S.  Ct.  at  819-820  quoting,  inter  alia  Dirrane  v. \nBrookline  Police  Dep't,  315  F.3d  65,  69-70  (1\"  Cir.  2002).  Thus,  the  “law \nelaboration  purpose”  is  not  necessarily  served  in  such  Fourth  Amendment  cases. \nId.  See  also  Pearson,  129  S.  Ct.  at  819.  Moreover,  as  further  recognized  by  the \nSupreme  Court  when  it  decided  to  leave  the  sequence  to  the  District  Court’s \ndiscretion,  “the  development  of constitutional  law  is  by  no  means  entirely \ndependent  on  cases  in  which  the  defendant  may  seek  qualified  immunity.” \nPearson,  129  S.  Ct.  at  821-822. \nDefendants  thus  submit  that  the  District  Court  properly  exercised  it’s \ndiscretion  in  deciding  to  leave  the  constitutional  issue  to  one  side  and  decide  the \ninstant  matter  on  the  issue  of whether  the  constitutional  right  at  issue  was  clearly \nestablished.  There  is  no  basis  for  this  Court  to  divert  from  this  approach. \nII.  The  Undisputed  Facts  Support  The  Finding  That  Coach  Marchand’s \nConsent  Was  Voluntary \nPlaintiffs  further  claim  that  summary judgment  should  be  reversed  because \neven  if the  law  on  Coach  Marchand’s  authority  to  consent  was  not  clearly \nestablished,  the  District  Court  erred  in  finding  that  Coach  Marchand’s  consent  was \nvoluntary.  Plaintiffs  specifically  claim  that  Coach  Marchand’s  consent  was  given \n31\n       \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  33  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nin  a  “custodial”  setting  under  pressure  from  a  “mob””’  thus  giving  rise  to  at  least  a \nfactual  issue  as  to  whether  the  consent  was  voluntary.  However,  as  held  by  the \nDistrict  Court,  the  deposition  testimony  of Coach  Marchand  puts  to  rest  any \nconcern  as  to  the  voluntariness  of his  consent. \nCoach  Marchand  specifically  testified  that  he  readily  agreed  to  the  officer’s \nrequest  to  search  the  players’*  because  he  knew  that  they  did  not  take  the  items  and \nbelieved  that  it  was  best  to  have  his  players  names  cleared  and  to  leave  the  area  for \nthe  safety  of the  plaintiffs.  Jd.  at  28  (App.  at  59).  Under  questioning  by  plaintiffs’ \nattorney,  Coach  Marchand  later  testified  that  given  his  obligation  as  coach  and \n“father”  to  the  plaintiffs,  he  thought  it  would  be  best  “take  the  high  road”  and \nallow  the  officers  to  search  them  in  order  to  clear  their  names.  Jd.  at  28,  32  &  44- \n45  (App.  at  59,  60  &  61-62).  According  to  Coach  Marchand: \nI’m  a  First  Amendment  [sic]  guy,  you’re  getting  no,  you  know,  and  I  dread \nto  say,  Screw  you  get  a  search  warrant  and  I  debated  that.  Okay.  Then  I  said \nno,  that’s  not  my  role,  at  that  point  my  role  as  coach,  I’m  suppose  [sic]  to  be \nthe  father,  I’m  suppose  [sic]  to  take  them  home  safe.  Marchand’s  Tr,  at  32 \n(App.  60). \n  \n”  It  is  noteworthy  at  this juncture  that  for  purposes  of the  summary judgment  only, \ndefendants  accepted  plaintiffs’  description  of the  spectators  as  qualifying  as  a \n“mob.”  If this  matter  were  to  go  to  trial,  defendants  would  challenge  both  the \nnumber  of spectators  alleged  to  be  watching  the  exchange  as  well  as  the \ndescription  of them  as  being  a  “mob.” \n'°  Although  not  material  for  purposes  of the  instant  motion,  the  officers  testified \nthat  they  did  not  ask  for  consent  to  search.  Rather,  it  was  Coach  Marchand  who \noffered  to  allow  the  officers  to  search  the  students.  Michailides  Tr.,  at  44. \n32\n  \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  34  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nDuring  his  deposition,  in  response  to  questions  by  plaintiffs’  attorney,  the \nCoach  explained  he  felt  he  was  under  “duress”  because  the  police  did  not  have \nauthority  to  conduct  the  search,  did  not  take  his  word  that  they  had  not  taken  the \nitems  and  because  there  was  a  crowd  raising  the  possibility  for  potential  violence. \nId. At  44  (App.  At  61). \nContrary  to  plaintiffs’  current  position,  Coach  Marchand  did  not  testify  that \nhe  felt  that  he  was  in  custody  or  otherwise  not  free  to  leave.  In  fact,  Coach \nMarchand  made  clear  that  it  was  the  presence  of the  crowd  that  convinced  him  to \nallow  the  officers  to  search  the  students  rather  than  anything  the  officers  said  or \ndid.  He  noted  that  if there  had  not  been  a  crowd,  he  would  not  have  agreed  so \nquickly  to  the  search.  Jd. At  45  (App.  At  62). \nOf course,  any  outside  influence  by  the  crowd  does  not  invalidate  the \ncoach’s  consent  and  thus  is  irrelevant  to  plaintiffs’  constitutional  claims.  Rather, \nunder  well-settled  precedent,  in  order  to  invalidate  consent,  there  must  be  coercive \naction  by  the  officers  themselves.  In  this  case,  plaintiffs  do  not  allege  that  the \nofficers  coerced  Coach  Marchand  to  consent  to  the  search.\"  Any  alleged  pressure \nfelt  by  Coach  Marchand  because  of the  crowd  is  thus  irrelevant  to  the \ndetermination  of whether  the  officers  are  entitled  to  qualified  immunity. \n  \n'  In  fact,  according  to  Coach  Marchand,  the  police  officers  were  courteous  and \nprofessional  “at  all  times”  and  repeatedly  told  the  bystanders  to  quiet  down. \nMarchand  Tr.,  at  26,  27  and 32. \n33\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  35  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nCourts  have  applied  the  holding  of Colorado  v.  Connelly,  479  U.S.  157,  170 \n  \n(1986)  to  Fourth  Amendment  voluntary  consent  cases  and  required  that  a \nconsenting  party  who  alleges  coercion  demonstrate  that  the  coercion  emanated \nfrom  the  police  officers  themselves  rather  than  any  subjective  or  outside  influence. \nIn  Connelly  the  defendant  claimed  that  his  confession  to  the  police  was  involuntary \ndue  to  his  mental  condition.  In  rejecting  the  position  that  the  statements  should  be \nsuppressed  under  the  Fourth  Amendment  due  to  the  defendant’s  mental  state,  as \nopposed  to  police  misconduct  compelling  the  confession,  the  Court  surveyed  the \ncases  over  the  past  fifty  years  and  summarized: \nAbsent  police  conduct  causally  related  to  the  confession,  there  is  simply  no \nbasis  for  concluding  that  any  state  actor  has  deprived  a  criminal  defendant  of \ndue  process  of law.  Respondent  correctly  notes  that  as  interrogators  have \nturned  to  more  subtle  forms  of psychological  persuasion,  courts  have  found \nthe  mental  condition  of the  defendant  a  more  significant  factor  in  the \n\"voluntariness\"  calculus.  But  this  fact  does  not justify  a  conclusion  that  a \ndefendant's  mental  condition,  by  itself and  apart  from  its  relation  to  official \ncoercion,  should  ever  dispose  of the  inquiry  into  constitutional \n\"voluntariness.\" \nId.  at  164  (citation  omitted). \nThe  Supreme  Court  thus  rejected  the  defendant’s  claim  that  the  Court  must \n“find  an  attempted  waiver  invalid  whenever  the  defendant  feels  compelled  to \nwaive  his  rights  by  reason  of any  compulsion,  even  if the  compulsion  does  not \nflow  from  the  police.”  Jd.  at  170.  The  Court  held  that  there  must  be  an  \"essential \nlink  between  coercive  activity  of the  State,  on  the  one  hand,  and  a  resulting \n34\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  36  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nconfession  by  a  defendant,  on  the  other.\"  Jd.  at  165  (emphasis  added).  The  Court \nunderscored  the  \"state  actor\"  requirement  by  stating: \nThe  most  outrageous  behavior  by  a  private  party  seeking  to  secure  evidence \nagainst  a  defendant  does  not  make  that  evidence  inadmissible  under  the  Due \nProcess  Clause. \nId.  at  166. \nThis  rationale  is  based  on  the  recognition  that  the  Due  Process  clause  and \nother  civil  rights  specifically  protect  citizens  from  being  deprived  of their  rights  by \n“state  actors.”  “Whether  a  waiver  of the  Fifth  Amendment  privilege  is  voluntary \ndepends  on  \"the  absence  of police  overreaching,  not  on  'free  choice’  in  any  broader \nsense  of the  word.\"  Jd.  at  157.  See  i.e.  U.S.  v.  Rosario-Diaz,  202  F.3d 54,  69  (Ist \n  \nCir.  P.R.  2000)  (“Although  Melendez-Garcia  herself testified that  she felt  very \nscared and physically  ill,  there  was  no  evidence  whatsoever  of physical  coercion \nor  intimidation,  nor  was  there  any  indication  of conduct  by  the  law  enforcement \nagents  that  would amount  to psychological  coercion  or  intimidation”’). \nAs  noted,  Connelly  has  been  applied  to  cases  challenging  the  voluntariness \nof consent  to  search  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  See,  i.e.,  U.S.  v.  Jennings, \n49]  F.Supp.2d  1072,  1078  (M.D.  Ala.  2007).  Although  the  voluntariness  standard \nunder  the  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  amendments  is  slightly  different,  id.”  a  party \n  \n'°  The  distinction  is  based  on  the  fact  that  while  a  consent  to  search  must  be \nvoluntarily  given,  it  need  not  be  knowing  and  intelligent  as  required  under  the \nwaiver  of Miranda  rights.  Jennings,  491  F.Supp.2d at  1079. \n35\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  37  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nchallenging  the  validity  of a  consent  to  search  based  on  undue  coercion  must \nlikewise  demonstrate  coercive  action  by  the  governmental  agent  rather  than \nsubjective  perception  of coercion.  For  example,  in  Jennings,  the  defendant  had \nclaimed  that  because  of his  mental  limitations  he  had  not  freely  and  voluntarily \nconsented  to  the  search  of his  personal  bag  by  U.S.  Postal  inspectors.  After \nconcluding  that  Connelly  applied  to  a  determination  of whether  a  consent  to  search \nwas  coerced,  the  Court  held  that  “there  is  no  basis  for  finding  Jennings’  consent  to \nsearch  involuntary  ‘absent  any  evidence  of psychological  or  physical  coercion  on \nthe  part  of the  agents.’”  Jd.  at  1080. \nThe  Jennings  Court  relied  upon  U.S.  v.  Barbour,  70  F.3d 580,  585  (11th  Cir. \n1995),  where  the  Eleventh  Circuit  rejected  the  defendant’s  claim  that  his \nstatements  to  Secret  Service  agents  and  his  consent  to  search,  both  executed  while \nhe  was  undergoing  psychiatric  treatment  for  severe  depression,  was  involuntary. \nPlaintiff claimed  that  given  his  severe  mental  depression  and  medicated  state,  the \nSecret  Service  Agent's  promise  to  provide  him  help  in  obtaining  mental  health \ntreatment  was  coercive.  The  Eleventh  Circuit,  however,  noted  the  absence  of “any \nevidence  of psychological  or  physical  coercion  on  the  part  of the  agents.”  Jd. \nTherefore,  in  applying  Connelly,  the  Court  held  that  there  was  no  basis  for  finding \nthat  the  defendant’s  statements  and  consent  to  search  were  involuntary.  Jd.  See \nalso  U.S.  v.  Amery,  2002  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  16974  (S.D.N.Y.

In  other  words,  the  relevant  question  is  not  whether  the \n  \nperson  whose  consent  is  sought  perceived  coercion  but,  rather,  whether  there \nactually  was  coercion.”  U.S.  v.

In \nthis  case,  the  only  thing  the  police  did  was  park  their  cars  around  the  bus.  (Of \ncourse,  it  is  undisputed  that  the  police  had  received  reports  of an  ongoing  fight.) \nCoach  Marchand,  however,  although  noting  that  the  police  cars  physically  blocked \nthe  bus,  did  not  testify  that  he  felt  that  he  or  the  students  were  not  free  to  leave. \nEven  more  telling,  however,  is  the  fact  that  Coach  Marchand  did  not  testify  that  the \nofficers  did  anything  to  him  -  either  making  him  feel  like  he  was  in  custody  or \n37\n4  P SwAae8 NeSs.~~    YMS YA PSh a Us mPeeR‘  eISaeSke    O RPoS P Aykae cMiEi eEyEAa ntDEN .

As  readily  confirmed  by \nCoach  Marchand,  it  was  his  own  personal  belief that,  based  on  the  presence  of the \ncrowd  and  his  past  experiences,  it  would  be  in  the  students’  best  interest  to  allow \nthe  police  to  search  the  students. \nThus,  as  correctly  found  by  the  District  Court,  there  is  no  basis  for  a \nreasonable jury  to  find  that  the  police  unlawfully  coerced  Coach  Marchand  into \nconsenting  to  the  search  of the  students.  Summary judgment  in  favor  of \ndefendants  should  thus  be  affirmed. \nIll.  The  Undisputed  Facts  Fail  To  Support  A  Finding  That  The  Officers \nViolated  Plaintiffs’  Equal  Protection  Rights \nPlaintiffs  also  appeals  the  District  Court  grant  of summary judgment  on \nplaintiffs’  $  7/983  for  the  alleged  denial  of plaintiffs’  right  to  equal  protection. \nPlaintiffs  premise  their  equal  protection  claim  on  the  accusation  that  the  police \nofficers  treated  them  differently  because  of their  race.  However,  as  found  by  the \nDistrict  Court,  there  is  absolutely  no  evidence,  other  than  the  difference  in  their \nraces,  to  support  even  an  inference  of such  discriminatory  animus  on  the  part  of the \nofficers.  On  appeal,  plaintiffs  claim  that  not  only  is  the  issue  of the  officers’ \ndiscriminatory  animus  a  factual  issue  but  that  the  District  Court  erred  in  failing  to \nimpute  the  perceived  discriminatory  animus  of the  surrounding  crowd  to  the \nofficers.  Defendants  submit  that  there  is  no  support  on  the  law  or  facts  for  such  a \nfinding. \n38\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  40  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nThe  Equal  Protection  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  provides,  in  part, \nthat  \"no  State  shall  make  or  enforce  any  law  which  shall  ...  deny  to  any  person \nwithin  its jurisdiction  the  equal  protection  of the  laws.\"  U.S.  Const.  amend.  XIV. \nPlaintiffs  essentially  maintain  that  the  officers  engaged  in  racial  profiling  in  their \ndecisions  to  request  permission  to  search  the  plaintiffs.  In  order  to  succeed  on  such \na  claim,  plaintiffs  ““must  present  evidence  that  [they  were]  treated  differently  from \nsimilarly  situated  white  [individuals]  and  the  action  taken  against  him  was \nmotivated,  at  least  in  part,  by  his  race.”  Flowers  v.  Fiore,  239  F.Supp.2d  173,  178 \n  \n(D.R.I.  2003).  See  also  Reese  v.  Jefferson  School District No.  14J,  208  F.3d  736, \n  \n740  (9\"  Cir.  2000)(in  order  to  succeed  on  claim,  litigant  must prove  that  the police \nacted  in  a  discriminatory  manner  and  that  the  discrimination  was  intentional). \nThis  has  been  broken  down  into  two  inquiries:  (1)  whether  the  appellant  was \ntreated  differently  than  others  similarly  situated,  and  (2)  whether  such  a  difference \nwas  based  on  an  impermissible  consideration,  such  as  race.  Macone  v.  Town  of \n  \nWakefield,  277 F.3d  1,  10  (1\"  Cir.  2002)  (citations  omitted). \nIn  the  instant  case,  plaintiffs  fail  to  satisfy  either  element.  In  the  first \ninstance,  there  is  no  basis  to  support  the  allegation  that  plaintiffs  were  treated \ndifferently  than  “similarly  situated  individuals.”  Regardless  of plaintiffs’  race,  the \nofficers  arrived  in  response  to  a  call  that  students  were  fighting.  When  the  officers \narrived,  the  students  were  not  fighting  but  tensions  were  clearly  running  high  with \n39\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  41  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \na  group  of spectators  forming  a  semi-circle  around  the  plaintiffs’  bus  and  making \naccusations  of theft  against  the  players.  The  first  person  to  speak  to  the  officers \nwas  the  plaintiffs’  coach  who  informed  the  officers  that  the  plaintiffs,  his  own \nplayers,  were  the  “prime  suspects.”  Marchand  Tr.,  at  27  (App.  at  59).  Coach \nMarchand  also  informed  the  officers  that  he  had  searched  the  plaintiffs’  belongings \nand  did  not  find  the  stolen  items  and  had  been just  offering  to  let  the  Coventry  AD \nconduct  the  search.  In  response,  the  officers  allegedly  requested  permission  for \nthem  to  search  these  students.  There  is  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  officers  would \nnot  have  asked  permission  to  search  the  players  if they  had  been  white  and \nidentified  as  the  “prime  suspects.” \nPlaintiffs  nevertheless  attempt  to  demonstrate  differential  treatment  by  the \nofficers’  decision  not  to  seek  permission  search  members  of the  alleged  “mob.” \nHowever,  these  individuals  were  not  similarly  situated  to  plaintiffs  in  that  they  had \nnot  been  identified  as  the  “prime  suspects”  in  the  theft  but  rather  were  identified  as \nthe  victims  and  interested  parties.'°  Consequently,  plaintiffs  cannot  offer  any \nevidence  to  support  the  conclusion  that  the  officers  treated  plaintiffs  differently \nthan  similarly  situated  white  individuals  in  a  similar  circumstance. \n  \n'°  Tn  fact,  it  would  make  sense  for  the  officers  to  assume  that  the  group  was \ncomprised  of either  victims  or  of just  spectators  to  the  police  presence  and  not  the \nthief.  Quite  simply,  it  is  a  valid  assumption  that  the  thief would  not  have  hung \naround  and  waited  to  be  asked  to  be  searched  by  the  officers. \n40\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  42  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nPlaintiff likewise  fails  to  meet  the  second  prong  of an  equal  protection  claim \nby  proving  that  the  action  taken  against  him  was  motivated  by  their  race.  Macone \n277 F.3d at  10  (1\"  Cir.  2002).  Rather,  the  facts  plaintiffs  rely  on  to  support  these \nclaim  are  meager  and  do  not  suffice  to  meet  this  standard.  Essentially,  the  facts  to \nsupport  plaintiffs’  claim  are  that: \n1.  they  are  members  of a  minority  group; \n2.  defendants  are  Caucasian;  and \n3,  Plaintiffs  committed  no  crime. \nTo  avoid  summary judgment,  plaintiffs  “must  produce  evidence  sufficient  to \npermit  a  reasonable  trier  of fact  to  find  by  a  preponderance  of the  evidence  that \n[the]  decision  was  racially  motivated.”  Keyser  v.  Sacramento  City  Unified Sch. \nDist.,  265  F.3d  741,  754  (9\"  Cir.  2001).  “A  long  line  of  Supreme  Court  cases \nmakes  clear  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  requires  proof of discriminatory \nintent  or  motive.”  Navarro  v.  Block,  72  F.3d  712,  716  (9\"  Cir.  1995);  Correa- \n  \nMartinez  v.  Arrillaga-Belendez,  903  F.2d  49,  53  (Ist  Cir. 1990)  (plaintiff \"may  not \nprevail  simply  by  asserting  an  inequity  and  tacking  on  the  self-serving  conclusion \nthat  the  defendant  was  motivated  by  discriminatory  animus\").  In  support  of the \nsame,  “the  facts  alleged  must  ‘specifically  identify  the  particular  instance(s)  of \ndiscriminatory  treatment  and,  as  a  logical  exercise,  adequately  support  the  thesis \n4]\n  \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  43  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nthat  the  discrimination  was  unlawful.’\"  Judge  v.  City  of Lowell,  160  F.3d  67,  77 \n  \n(1\"  Cir.  1998). \nThe  racial  differential  between  plaintiffs  and  the  defendant  officers  is  not \nsufficient  to  create  the  inference  of discriminatory  intent  or  motive.  /d.;  Flowers \n239  F.Supp.2d at  178.  In  Judge,  for  example,  the  plaintiff brought  a  ¢  /983  equal \nprotection  claim  against  city  police  officers  and  the  medical  examiner  alleging  that \nthey  failed  to  properly  investigate  the  circumstances  of her  brother’s  death.  The \nbasis  for  the  plaintiff's  claim  in  that  case  was  that  the  defendants  failed  to  take \ncertain  actions  such  as  notifying  her  of her  brother’s  death  solely  because  she  was \nblack.  Judge,  160  F.3d at  77.  The  plaintiff,  however,  offered  no  other  evidence \nto  support  these  allegations.  The  Court  concluded  that  such  “mere  conclusory \nassertion[s]”  that  the  defendant’s  actions  were  racially  motivated  is  not  sufficient \nto  maintain  an  equal  protection  claim.  /d.  See  also  Flowers,  239  F.Supp.2d at  177 \n(dismissing  an  equal protection  claim  where  the  only  evidence  of discriminatory \nmotive  was  the fact  that  the plaintiff was  black and  the  officers  were  white). \nIn  this  case,  although  plaintiffs  may  be  able  to  present  evidence  that  racial \nand  prejudicial  statements  were  being  made  by  the  spectators  around  the  bus,  as \nwell  as  possibly  by  Coventry  soccer  team  during  the  game,  there  is  absolutely  no \nevidence  that  the  officers  themselves  engaged  in  this  type  of talk  or  otherwise \nexhibited  any  discriminatory  motive.  In  fact,  plaintiffs  fail  to  point  to  any  evidence \n42\n     \nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  44  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nto  demonstrate  that  the  officers  even  knew  the  plaintiffs’  race  before  asking  for \nconsent  to  search.  In  addition,  Coach  Marchand  specifically  testified  that  the \nofficers  were  courteous  and  professional  “at  all  times”  and  instructed  the  spectators \nto  quiet  down.  Marchand  Tr.,  at  26,  27  and 32  (App.  at  59  -60). \nOn  appeal,  plaintiffs  attempt  to  impute  the  perceived  racial  bias  of the \nspectators  to  the  officers.  In  support  of this  proposition,  plaintiffs  rely  upon U.S. v. \nYonkers  Bd.  of Educ.,  837  F.2d  1181,  1226  (2d  Cir.  1987).  Plaintiffs’  reliance  on \n  \nYonkers,  however,  is  misplaced.  In  Yonkers,  the  Second  Circuit  was  addressing \nthe  constitutionality  of the  City  defendants’  policy  and  practice  of confining \nsubsidized  housing  to  portion  of the  city  which  resulted  in  the  racial  segregation  of \nthe  school  system  in  violation  of inter  alia  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  In \nresponse  to  the  City  defendants’  claim  that  its  legislative  housing  decisions  could \nnot  demonstrate  discriminatory  animus  on  the  part  of the  City  defendants  because \nthey  were  in  response  to  constituents’  concerns,  the  Court  held  inter  alia  that  in \nsuch  circumstances  the  City  could  be  held  liable  when  a  significant  factor  behind \nthe  public’s  concerns  was  the  constituents’  discriminatory  animus.  Jd.  at  1224. \nYonkers  is  thus  distinguishable  in  the  first  instance  because  it  was  the  City’s \nlegislative  act  fostering  a  discriminatory  animus  that  gave  rise  to  the  constitutional \nviolation.  Notably,  plaintiffs  do  not  cite  to  a  single  case  in  which  racial  comments \n43\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  45  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nby  third-parties  at  the  scene  of a  police  investigation  are  found  to  support  a  finding \nof discriminatory  animus  on  the  part  of the  individual  officers. \nIn  addition,  even  if Yonkers  could  be  applied  to  the  instant  case,  the \nundisputed  facts  fail  to  warrant  a  finding  that  officers  took  on  the  discriminatory \nanimus  of the  spectators.  In  Yonkers,  the  Court  held  that  in  order  to  impute  the \nracial  animus  of the  citizens  on  the  City,  a  plaintiff must  show  “[1)]  that  the \ndecision-making  body  acted  for  the  sole  purpose  of effectuating  the  desires  of \nprivate  citizens,  [2)]  that  racial  considerations  were  a  motivating  factor  behind \nthose  desires  and  [3)]  that  members  of the  decision-making  body  were  aware  of the \nmotivations  of the  private  citizens[s].”  Jd.  at  1225.  In  this  case  despite  spending  a \nconsiderable  amount  of their  Brief outlining  alleged  racial  comments  made  by  the \nCoventry  soccer  team  and  spectators  during  the  game  and  before  the  officers \narrived,  it  is  undisputed  that  the  plaintiffs  did  not  report  these  slurs  to  the \ndefendants  that  day.  It  is  also  undisputed  that  the  defendant  officers  were \nprofessional  and  courteous  at  all  times  and  did  not  use  racial  or  ethnic  slurs  against \nthe  plaintiffs.  While  the  officers  confirmed  that  they  heard  the  Coventry  spectators \nyelling  accusations  of theft  at  the  Central  Falls  players,  the  officers  themselves \nnever  heard  any  racial  slurs  against  the  plaintiffs.  Michailides  Tr.,  at  41;  Nelson \nTr.,  at  45. \n44\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  46  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nIn  support  of their  appeal,  plaintiffs  claim  that  a  factual  issue  is  raised  as  to \nwhether  the  officers  were  aware  of the  alleged  racial  animus  of the  spectators \nbecause  the  plaintiffs  themselves  testified  that  they  heard  the  spectators  yelling \nracial  slurs  while  the  officers  were  present.  However,  even  accepting  the  fact  that \nthese  players  heard  such  comments  after  the  police  arrived,  Coach  Marchand,  who \nwas  standing  next  to  the  officers  during  this  timeframe,  testified  that  although  the \nSpectators  were  accusing  the  players  of theft,  there  were  no  racial  slurs  mixed  in \nwith  these  accusations  after  the  police  arrived.  Marchand  Tr.,  at  45-46  (App.  at \n62).  In  fact,  according  to  Coach  Marchand  the  officers  were  courteous  and \nprofessional  “at  all  times”  and  repeatedly  told  the  bystanders  to  knock  it  off and \nquiet  down.  Marchand  Tr.,  at  26,  27  and  32  (App.  at  59  &  60).  Defendants  thus \nsubmit  that  even  if the  proposition  that  a  third-party’s  racial  animus  could  be \nimputed  to  investigating  officers,  the  undisputed  facts  in  this  case  fail  to  support  a \nfinding  that  the  officers  were  made  aware  of such  discriminatory  animus. \nFinally,  even  if the  Court  were  to  accept  plaintiffs’  claims  that  the  officers \nheard  racial  slurs  by  the  crowd,  the  facts  of this  case  fall  far  short  of demonstrating \nthat  such  “racial  considerations  were  a  motivating  factor  behind”  their  actions. \nYonkers,  at  1225.  Perhaps  the  best  evidence  of the  complete  dearth  of \ndiscriminatory  animus  by  the  officers  is  Coach  Marchand’s  actions.  There  is \nabsolutely  no  indication  or  even  an  insinuation  that  Coach  Marchand  discriminated \n45\n  \nagainst  these  students  or  possessed  any  racial  bias.  Yet  the  officers  took  the  exact \nsame  approach  as  Coach  Marchand  did.  That  is,  they  sought  to  quickly  resolve  the \nsituation  by  asking  for  permission  to  search  the  players.  Coach  Marchand  testified \nthat  he  felt  it  was  safer  for  all  involved  to  quickly  get  to  the  bottom  of the \naccusations  by  conducting  the  search  and  clearing  his  players.  Marchand  Tr.,  at \n28  (App.  at  59).  Coach  Marchand  took  this  approach  despite  the  fact  that  he  was \npresent  and  thus  allegedly  heard  the  racial  slurs  the  players  allegedly  endured \nduring  the  game.  Having  the  same  information  as  the  officers,  as  well  as  further \nknowledge  of perceived  discriminatory  bias,  Coach  Marchand  still  decided  that  it \nwas  best  to  search  his  players  and  clear  their  names.  There  was  nothing \ndiscriminatory  in  Coach  Marchand’s  approach  and  thus  there  is  likewise  nothing \ndiscriminatory  in  the  officers’  decision  to  follow  a  similar  course  by  asking  for \nconsent  to  search.  Consequently,  the  District  Court  did  not  err  in  granting \ndefendants  summary judgment  on  Count  II  and  the judgment  should  accordingly \nbe  affirmed. \nIV.  There  Is  No  Evidence  Of Discriminatory  Animus  To  Support  A  Finding \nThat  The  Defendants  Violated  Rhode  Island’s  Racial  Prevention  Act \nOr  The  Racial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute \nThe  District  Court  also  granted  defendants’  summary judgment  on  plaintiffs’ \nstate  law  claims  pursuant  to  the  Rhode  Island’s  Racial  Prevention  Act  and  the \nRacial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute  based  on  the  conclusion  that  plaintiffs \n46\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  48  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nhad  produce  no  evidence  from  which  a  reasonable  trier  of fact  could  that \ndefendants’  actions  were  motivated  by  plaintiffs’  race. \nThe  R.I.  Racial  Prevention  Act,  in  pertinent  part,  bans  racial  profiling  by \nstate  or  municipal  law  enforcement  officers.  RI.  Gen.  Laws  §  31/-21.2-3.  \"Racial \nprofiling”  is  defined  as  “the  detention,  interdiction  or  other  disparate  treatment  of \nan  individual  on  the  basis,  in  whole  or  in  part,  of the  racial  or  ethnic  status  of such \nindividual,  except  when  such  status  is  used  in  combination  with  other  identifying \nfactors  seeking  to  apprehend  a  specific  suspect  whose  racial  or  ethnic  status  is  part \nof the  description  of the  suspect,  which  description  is  timely  and  reliable.”  Jd.  RI. \nGen.  Laws  §  31-21.2-3.  The  Racial/National  Origin  Intimidation  Statute \nmeanwhile  allows  for  a  cause  of action  when  an  individual  maliciously  subjects \nanother  “to  an  act  or  acts  which  would  reasonably  be  construed  as  intended  to \nharass  or  intimidate  the  person  because  of his  or  her  race...”  RI.  Gen.  Laws  $  9- \n1-35  (emphasis  added). \nAs  evident  from  the  face  of both  these  statutes,  discriminatory  animus  is  the \ntouchstone  to  proving  a  cause  of action  under  either  of these  statutes.  Similar  to \nthe  utter  lack  of any  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  the  officers  possessed \ndiscriminatory  animus  in  support  of plaintiffs’  Equal  Protection  claim,  the  lack  of \ndiscriminatory  animus  by  the  officers  supports  the  entry  of summary judgment  on \n47\nCase:  09-2386  Document:  00116021669  Page:  49  Date Filed:  02/22/2010  EnItD: r541y951 8 \nplaintiff's  claim  under  the  Racial  Prevention  Act  and  the  Racial/National  Origin \nIntimidation  Statute. \nCONCLUSION \nFor  the  reasons  stated  herein,  defendants  respectfully  request  that  this  Court \naffirm  the  decision  of the  District  Court  and  deny  and  dismiss  the  instant  appeal. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nDefendants/Appellees, \nBy  their  Attorney, \n/s/  Marc  DeSisto \n Marc  DeSist o,  Esq. \nBar  No.  33548 \nDESISTO  LAW \n211  Angell  Street \nP.O.
