In this action, plaintiffs challenge a new policy of the Boulder County Jail—\nimposed earlier this year—that forbids prisoners to write letters to their parents, children, \nspouses, domestic partners, fiancées, sweethearts, friends, or to anyone else in the free world \nwho does not fall within the jail’s narrow exception to the newly-imposed ban on outgoing \nletters.  Under the challenged policy, prisoners’ outgoing correspondence is restricted to \npostcards supplied by the jail.  This new policy severely restricts prisoners’ ability to \ncommunicate with persons outside the jail, in violation of their rights under the First and \n  1\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 13\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Sections 10 and 25 of \nthe Colorado Constitution.   \n2.  On behalf of a class of similarly-situated prisoners of the Boulder County Jail, the \nplaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin the postcard-only policy and declare that it violates their \nconstitutional rights as well as the rights of their free-world correspondents.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n3.  This action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.  This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the claims based \non Colorado law pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief requested pursuant to the \nDeclaratory Relief Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. \n5.  Venue is proper in the District of Colorado pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  All \nparties reside within the District of Colorado, and the events described in this Complaint \noccurred in the District of Colorado. \nPARTIES \n6.  Plaintiff David Clay is a prisoner in the Boulder County Jail. \n7.  Plaintiff Matthew Deherrera is a prisoner in the Boulder County Jail. \n8.  Plaintiff Lamont Morgan is a prisoner in the Boulder County Jail. \n9.  Plaintiff William LaFontaine is a prisoner in the Boulder County Jail. \n10. Plaintiff Cynthia Shaw-Pierce is a prisoner in the Boulder County Jail.  \n11. Defendant Joe Pelle is the Sheriff of Boulder County and head of the Boulder \nCounty Sheriff Office.   He exercises overall responsibility for the policies and practices of the \n  2\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 13\nBoulder County Jail, including the policy challenged in this case.  He is sued in his official \ncapacity.  \n12. Defendant Larry R. Hank is an employee of the Boulder County Sheriff Office, \nholding the rank of Division Chief.  He is the administrator and chief policymaker for the \nBoulder County Jail and is responsible for the formulation and operation of the policy \nchallenged in this case.  He is sued in his official capacity.   \n13. Deputies and their supervisors working in the Boulder County Jail are agents and \nemployees of defendants Pelle and Hank. \n14. All actions of defendants and their agents and employees at issue here are carried \nout under color of state law.  \nFACTS \n15. The Boulder County Jail is located in Boulder, Colorado.  It houses both convicted \nprisoners and pretrial detainees.  Its average daily population is approximately 400. \n16. Until March, 2010, prisoners in the Boulder County Jail were able to write five \nletters each week, with paper, envelope, and postage supplied by the jail.  Each letter could \ncontain three sheets of 8.5 x 11 inch paper written on both sides.  Prisoners could seal the \nenvelopes and deliver them to deputies for processing and mailing.  The jail’s policy provided \nthat deputies might read outgoing mail only if they had facts amounting to reasonable suspicion \nthat a prisoner was using the mail illegally or for a purpose that threatened the safety and \nsecurity of the jail, a public official, or any person.  \n17. Beginning in March, 2010, defendants suddenly announced that prisoners’ outgoing \ncorrespondence would henceforth be restricted to postcards supplied by the jail.  Under the new \npolicy, prisoners are allowed to send five postcards per week at jail expense.  Prisoners can \n  3\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 13\nwrite letters that will be enclosed and mailed out in envelopes only when sending mail that fits \ninto narrow categories that the jail defines as “legal mail” or “official mail.”   \n18. The challenged policy significantly limits the ability of prisoners to express \nthemselves, allowing prisoners less then one-twelfth the amount of writing space permitted \nunder the former policy.  In addition, the postcards expose the content of the prisoners’ \ncommunications to anyone who handles or processes the postcards, both within the jail and \nafter the postcards leave the facility.  The policy either chills prisoners from writing about \nsensitive personal matters entirely, or it requires them to expose their communications to a host \nof strangers or unintended recipients—such as postal employees, an office secretary, or a child \nwho retrieves from the mailbox a postcard that discusses sensitive details intended only for the \nparent’s eyes.  The new policy also categorically prohibits prisoners from enclosing expressive \nor artistic drawings they have made, newspaper or magazine clippings, religious literature, or \nother writings they wish to share.  Prisoners cannot use an envelope to write a letter-to-the-\neditor, to seek spiritual guidance from clergy, to provide information to investigative reporters, \nor even to submit their own writings to such periodicals as the Denver Voice or Prison Legal \nNews. \n19. The postcard-only policy also burdens the First Amendment rights of non-prisoners.  \nAs the United States Supreme Court has recognized: \nCommunication by letter is not accomplished by the act of writing words on paper. \nRather, it is effected only when the letter is read by the addressee. Both parties to the \ncorrespondence have an interest in securing that result, and censorship of the \ncommunication between them necessarily impinges on the interest of each. … The wife \nof a prison inmate who is not permitted to read all that her husband wanted to say to her \nhas suffered an abridgment of her interest in communicating with him as plain as that \nwhich results from censorship of her letter to him. In either event, censorship of prisoner \nmail works a consequential restriction on the First and Fourteenth Amendments rights of \nthose who are not prisoners. \n \n  4\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 13\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 408-409 (1974). \n \nPlaintiff William LaFontaine \n20. Mr. LaFontaine has been an artist his entire life.  Art is his passion and his form of \nexpression.   \n21. Mr. LaFontaine spent some time at the Boulder County Jail before the challenged \npolicy was put into effect.  During that time, Mr. LaFontaine was able to share his drawings \nwith persons outside the jail by mailing them out in an envelope.   He was able to send his \ndrawings to a website that posted his drawings.   He was also able to enclose drawings in his \nletters and send them to family, friends, and others who followed his art.   \n22. Pursuant to the challenged policy, however, Mr. LaFontaine cannot mail out his \ndrawings to those who wish to receive them.    \n23. The challenged policy has also inhibited, chilled, and interfered with Mr. \nLaFontaine’s communications with his wife and his mother.  He has used the jail’s postcards to \ncommunicate, but he leaves out details because of the limited space and because of the lack of \nprivacy.  He wants to communicate intimate things to his wife, but he does not want to write \nthose intimate details on a postcard for deputies and all the world to see.  Because of the \npostcard-only policy, he finds himself censoring what he writes to his wife and his mother.   \nPlaintiff David Clay \n24.  The challenged policy has forced Mr. Clay to choose either to abandon important \ncorrespondence or divulge highly confidential information.  For example, he needed to write to \nthe optical service that had the prescription for his eyeglasses.  He believed he was required to \nsupply his Social Security number and his date of birth.  Because of the policy challenged in \nthis case, Mr. Clay put that confidential information on a postcard for all to see. \n  5\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 13\n25.  Mr. Clay has a serious medical condition, and the fact that he suffers from this \ncondition is sensitive private information.  He wants to mention or discuss this information in \nsealed correspondence, not in postcards that can be read by anyone who sees them.  For \nexample, he wants to write to his former doctor about his medical condition.  He wants to write \nto several organizations that may be able to help him with counseling and services both during \nhis incarceration and after his release.  He would also like to discuss his medical issues, and \ngetting assistance with them, in correspondence with the director of an agency who helped him \nbefore he entered the Boulder County Jail.  The challenged policy prevents him from sending \nsuch correspondence regarding his sensitive medical issues, and categorically prohibits him \nfrom sending medical records, news articles he reads about his medical condition, or any other \ndocuments.  \n26. Mr. Clay has written a piece that he wants to submit for publication to the Denver \nVoice, a publication concerned with the interests of homeless persons.   His proposed \nsubmission will not fit onto a postcard.  The jail’s postcard-only policy prevents Mr. Clay from \nsending his submission to the Denver Voice.     \nPlaintiff Matthew Deherrera \n27. Mr. Deherrera spent some time in the Boulder County Jail before the challenged \npolicy was put into effect.  During that time, Mr. Deherrera wrote letters almost every day, and \nthey were often two to three pages long.  The challenged policy, however, has severely \ninhibited, chilled, and curtailed Mr. Deherrera’s correspondence.    \n28.  Mr. Deherrera has a serious health condition of a private and sensitive nature.  \nBefore the challenged policy went into effect, Mr. Deherrera was able to discuss this medical \n  6\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 13\nissue in correspondence with his parents and in correspondence with a very close personal \nfriend.  Now he cannot.   \n29.  Mr. Deherrera has several nieces and nephews who spend a large amount of time at \nhis parents’ house.  It is not unusual for one of his nieces or nephews to retrieve the mail from \nthe family mailbox located approximately 15 feet from the house.  His nieces and nephews do \nnot know about his sensitive medical issues.  Mr. Deherrera does not want to risk one of his \nnieces or nephews reading a postcard intended solely for his mother and father, and thus he has \nbeen unable to discuss these private medical issues in his correspondence with his parents.  \n30.  Mr. Deherrera also has a close personal friend with whom he has discussed his \nsensitive medical issues.  The challenged policy prevents Mr. Deherrera from discussing such \npersonal issues on a postcard, however, because his friend’s mother is living at the same \naddress.  She does not know about Mr. Deherrera’s medical issues, and he does not want her to \nknow.  There are times when she retrieves the mail for herself and her son, so there is a very \nreal risk that she would see the communications that he intends solely for his friend but that the \nchallenged policy requires be exposed to whoever sees the postcard.   \n31.  Mr. Deherrera also wants to write to his doctor about medical and mental health \nissues, but he does not want to discuss those sensitive subjects on a postcard.    \nPlaintiff Lamont Morgan \n32.  Lamont Morgan is extremely close to his family.  He writes every day that he can.  \nThe challenged policy has inhibited, chilled, and limited the communications between Mr. \nMorgan and his wife, children, sister, mother-in-law and father-in-law. \n33.  Mr. Morgan’s wife and three of his children live together.   Mr. Morgan would like \nto write to his wife about relationship and parenting issues.  However, because his children \n  7\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 13\noften retrieve the mail from the mailbox, Mr. Morgan is worried that they will read a postcard \nmeant only for his wife.  Recently, Mr. Morgan wanted to communicate to his wife something \nhe learned about the boyfriend of his oldest daughter.  He could not do so in a postcard, \nhowever, because he did not want his younger children to see the communication.    \n34. The lack of space on the jail’s postcards curtails Mr. Morgan’s communications.   \nHe cannot write all that he wishes to say.  He has to break up his correspondence into \ninstallments.  Moreover, Mr. Morgan must now rotate through a list of family members to \nwhom he wishes to write.  The jail’s former policy would have allowed him to enclose several \npages in a single envelope, each for the attention of a different family member.   \n35. Mr. Morgan enjoys drawing, as do many other inmates at the Boulder County Jail.  \nHe would like to send his artwork to his family, but the challenged policy prohibits him from \nusing an envelope, so he cannot enclose any drawings.  Mr. Morgan will sometimes draw on \nthe postcard, but the drawing severely limits the already-meager space that is available for \nwriting. \nPlaintiff Cynthia Shaw-Pierce \n36.  It is important to Ms. Shaw-Pierce to maintain her close personal relationships \nwhile she is housed in the Boulder County Jail.  The challenged policy has interfered with her \nability to do so, however, by inhibiting, chilling, and limiting her written communications, \nparticularly with a close personal friend and with her common-law husband of fifteen years. \n37.  Ms. Shaw-Pierce lives in a very small town in rural Colorado.  The residents have \nto use post office boxes to receive mail.  There are only two postal workers in the town, and \nboth know Ms. Shaw-Pierce by name, and she knows them.  Ms. Shaw-Pierce is afraid that \nwhat she writes on the jail’s postcards will be read by the postal workers and will soon become \n  8\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 13\nknown to the entire town.  Thus, when she uses the jail’s postcards to write to her common-law \nhusband, she self-censors her communication to ensure that she writes nothing about their \npersonal life.  She reviews the postcard to make sure that she has not said anything too \nrevealing or too emotional.  Because of the postcard-only policy, she declines to write about \nany of her feelings toward her husband or her feelings about being incarcerated.  She is forced \nto eliminate everything personal from her communications with her husband.  If she could write \nletters instead, she would be more far more open, revealing and communicative.   \n38. The space restrictions of the postcards severely curtail Ms. Shaw-Pierce’s ability to \nexpress herself fully.  She often writes out full letters first and then must choose what she must \nomit so that the written communication can fit into the limited space available on the jail’s \npostcards.   \n39. Ms. Shaw-Pierce has a close friend who is battling cancer.  The friend was recently \nscheduled to undergo cancer-related surgery.  Ms. Shaw-Pierce wanted to write her friend a \nheartfelt letter to offer comfort and strength as the date of the surgery approached.  Because Ms. \nShaw-Pierce can fit only about three paragraphs onto one of the jail’s postcards, she was forced \nto condense what she could say to her friend during this challenging time.  The space \nrestrictions of the postcard restricted Ms. Shaw-Pierce’s ability to communicate fully the \nsupport she wished to provide to her close friend.   \nThe challenged policy’s effect on the Plaintiff class \n40. In numerous ways, the challenged policy has inhibited, infringed, limited, chilled, \nand suppressed the constitutionally-protected communications between prisoners and their \ncorrespondents or intended correspondents.     \n  9\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 13\n41.  The challenged policy has forced prisoners to either abandon important \ncorrespondence or risk divulging highly confidential, sensitive information.  Gay prisoners have \nbeen chilled from expressing themselves when writing to their intimate partners.  Prisoners with \nHIV or Hepatitis C have been chilled from corresponding with medical personnel or with \nfamily members or intimate associates about their medical conditions.   Prisoners who express \nthemselves through drawings or cartoons are forbidden to enclose their art.  Those who wish to \nenclose a religious tract, or a clipping from a newspaper or magazine, are forbidden from doing \nso.  When children may have access to the mailbox, parents are chilled from communicating \nwith their spouses about marital problems, child-raising issues, and other matters they do not \nwish to disclose to their children.  Prisoners have been chilled from corresponding candidly \nwith imams, priests, and other religious or spiritual guides.  \nEXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES \n42. Each of the individual plaintiffs has exhausted all available administrative remedies.  \nIn addition, in response to grievances filed by prisoners, including the plaintiffs, defendants \nhave responded that the challenged policy is “non-grieveable.”  See Attachment A.  The jail’s \ngrievance procedure is therefore not an available administrative remedy for the plaintiffs’ \nobjections to the challenged postcard-only policy.     \nDECLARATORY RELIEF \n43. An actual and immediate controversy exists between the parties.   \n44. Defendants take the position that the challenged policy is valid and constitutional.  \nPlaintiffs assert that the challenged policy violates their rights under the Colorado and United \nStates Constitutions. \n  10\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of 13\n45. In requesting declaratory relief, plaintiffs request an interpretation of the rights, legal \nstatus and relationships of the parties under the law and facts.   \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n46.    The defendants have acted and are threatening to continue acting under color of \nstate law to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutional rights.  Plaintiffs face a real and immediate \nthreat of irreparable injury as a result of the actions and threatened actions of the defendants and \nthe existence, operation, and threat of enforcement of the challenged policy. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n47. The individual plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others \nsimilarly situated, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n48. The individual plaintiffs seek to represent a class defined as “all current and future \nprisoners in the Boulder County Jail who are subject to or affected by the defendants’ postcard-\nonly policy.” \n49. The proposed class is so numerous and so fluid that joinder of all members is \nimpracticable.   \n50. There are questions of law and fact common to the members of the plaintiff class. \n51. The claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the members of the \nclass. \n52. The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \nPlaintiffs have no interest that is now or may be potentially antagonistic to the interests of the \nclass.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys employed by and working in cooperation with the \nACLU Foundation of Colorado and the National Prison Project of the ACLU Foundation, \nwhich have extensive experience in class action cases involving federal civil rights claims. \n  11\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of 13\n53. Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, \nthereby making appropriate final injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the class as a \nwhole. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, 42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n54. The challenged policy has violated, and threatens to continue violating, the \nplaintiffs’ rights under the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n55. Wherefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and \nsuch additional relief as the Court deems just. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Colorado Constitution, Article II, Sections 10 and 25) \n56. The challenged policy has violated, and threatens to continue violating, the \nplaintiffs’ rights under the Colorado Constitution, Article II, Sections 10 and 25, which protect \nthe right of free expression and the right to due process of law. \n57. Wherefore, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and \nsuch additional relief as the Court deems just. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  \n58. Wherefore, plaintiffs ask that this Court: \na.  Certify, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b)(2), a class comprising \n“all current and future prisoners in the Boulder County Jail who are subject to or \naffected by the defendants’ postcard-only policy;” \n  12\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 1    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of 13\nb.  Declare that the challenged postcard-only policy violates the rights of the \nplaintiffs and their correspondents; \nc.  Permanently enjoin the defendants from continuing to enforce the \nchallenged postcard-only policy, or any other policy that limits outgoing mail to \npostcards, thus restoring the status quo that existed before this controversy began; \nd.   Award plaintiffs their reasonable costs and attorney fees;  \ne.

Wallace, counsel for Plaintiffs, \nconferred with Andy MacDonald, counsel for Defendants, who opposes this motion. \nINTRODUCTION \nIn this case, prisoners mount a facial challenge to the recently-implemented postcard \npolicy of the Boulder County Jail (“Jail” or “BCJ”).    Under that policy, prisoners must use \npostcards for their personal correspondence to friends, family, and loved ones.  Prisoners cannot \nwrite personal letters unless they are lucky enough to find out about, and lucky enough to \nsuccessfully apply for, the jail’s “official mail” exception to the postcard policy.  The “official \nmail” exception is not only a standardless exception that Jail officials have unfettered discretion \nto grant or deny, but the Jail has also deliberately concealed the exception from the Jail \npopulation in order to deter letter-writing.     \nIn this motion, Plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from \nenforcing the postcard policy, or any other policy that limits prisoners’ outgoing mail to \npostcards.1 \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nI.  The Jail’s Implementation of the Postcard Policy \nPrior to March 8, 2010, BCJ inmates were permitted to write five letters each week, with \npaper, envelope, and postage supplied by the Jail.  Doc. No. 15, Scheduling Order, Statement of \nUndisputed Facts (hereinafter “Undisputed Facts”), Fact e.  Each letter could contain three sheets \nof 8.5 x 11 inch paper written on both sides. Undisputed Facts, Fact e.  Beginning on March 8, \n2010, the Jail implemented an outgoing mail policy limiting most inmate correspondence to \n                                                 \n1 This is identical to the preliminary injunction this Court entered upon stipulation of the \nparties in Martinez v. Maketa, No. 10-cv-02242-WYD-KLM, Doc. No. 37, December 20, 2010.   \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 17\npostcards (hereinafter “postcard policy”).  Undisputed Facts, Fact e; see Ex. 1, Hank Depo., \n156:12-16.  Pursuant to the postcard policy, inmates can write letters that will be enclosed and \nmailed out in envelopes only if they ask for and are granted permission to send correspondence \nas “legal mail” or “official mail.”  See Statement of Undisputed Facts, Fact g.  According to Jail \nDivision Chief Larry Hank, while inmates may “request permission” to send letters enclosed in \nenvelopes to a defined set of individuals under the “official mail” exception to the postcard \npolicy (which the Jail has rewritten no fewer than six times since March 2010), there is no \nguarantee that permission will be granted.  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 180:8-15. \n  Chief Hank has explained that the Jail staff who review inmates’ requests to send \n“official mail” have the “discretion” to grant or deny these requests.  See, e.g., Ex. 1, Hank \nDepo., 123:6-22 (discretion to deny inmate’s official mail request to send a letter professing his \ninnocence), 124:15-125:14 (discretion to deny letter to parents “informing them of life updates”), \naccord 137:12-138:13,142:21-143:8, 148:1-148:15 (discretion to deny other requests to send \nofficial mail).  There are no written criteria to guide Jail staff in exercising this discretion, \nresulting in inconsistency in the Jail’s application of the “official mail” exception.  Ex. 1, Hank \nDepo., 153:2-13. \nThe Jail takes pains to keep the “official mail” exception secret from prisoners in order to \ndecrease the quantity of requests to send letters.  See Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 84:13-95:22 (admitting \nthat one of the benefits of the postcard policy is that it deters inmates from writing letters).  To \nthat end, the Jail does not inform inmates about the existence of the “official mail” exception.  \nEx. 1, Hank Depo., 155:1-7 (admitting that the Jail distributes no documents to inmates that \nmention the “official mail” exception and that the “official mail” exception is not discussed \nduring  inmate orientation); accord Ex. 2, Black Depo., 60:10-13, 64:17-20, 65:3-8.  In fact, the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 17\nonly document that the Jail distributes to inmates regarding outgoing mail focuses solely on \npostcards.  See Ex. 3, Boulder County Jail Inmate Rules (revised March 2010).  As a result, \nmany inmates only learn of the official mail exception through Plaintiffs’ counsel, rather than \nthrough the Jail.  See, e.g., Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl., ¶ 7; Ex. 5, Rios Decl., ¶ 10. \nII.  The Jail Interests Purportedly Served by the Postcard Policy  \n  Defendants state that they implemented the postcard policy in response to an incident in \n2009 involving two Jail detainees, Gino Rael and Damien Whitehead.  With the apparent help of \na third party outside of the Jail, these two inmates sent letters to a number of young girls in the \nBoulder/Longmont community  (hereinafter “Rael/Whitehead Incident”).2  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., \n18:18-19:5; Ex. 2, Black Depo., 154:12-19.  Chief Hank confirmed that the Jail’s postcard policy \nserves no important governmental interest other than to prevent the type of third party mailings \nimplicated in the Rael/Whitehead Incident.   Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 67:11-68:9, 83:20-85:25. \nAt the time of the Rael/Whitehead Incident, the Jail allowed prisoners to seal their own \npersonal letters before giving them to a jail staff for mailing, Ex. 2, Black Depo., 76:22-77:7, and \nthe Jail did not require that envelopes given to prisoners be stamped with the Jail’s return \naddress, Ex. 2, Black Depo., 69:6-19.  Chief Hank and Commander Black explained that, as a \nresult of the Jail’s outgoing mail policy at the time, inmates were easily able to send letters \nthrough intermediaries who then forwarded them on to girls in the community who were \nunaware that the letters they received were coming from prisoners.  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 59:16-23 \n(admitting that prior policy was “flawed”); Ex. 2, Black Depo., 115:14-116:1.                                   \n                                                 \n2 These letters (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Rael/Whitehead incident”) \ncontained no sexual content.  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 25:8-10.  They did not violate any BCJ rules or \ncriminal laws.  Ex. 1, Hankd Depo., 23:7-13.  The letters did not result in any monetary loss, \nphysical harm, or sexual contact or abuse.  Ex. 1 Hank Depo., 28:5-21. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 17\nIII.  The Effects of the Postcard Policy on Prisoners and their Loved Ones \n  Joshua Nemnich, Vincent Abeyta, George Rios, and John A. Smith were incarcerated in \nthe Jail before the postcard policy was adopted, and each has spent additional time in the Jail \nafter it went into effect.    All have found their communications dramatically stifled by the \npostcard policy. \nPrior to the postcard policy, Mr. Nemnich wrote letters almost daily to his children, ex-\nwife, mother, and friends.  Ex. 6, Nemnich Decl., ¶ 2.  Once the postcard policy came into effect, \nhe “rarely” corresponded with the outside world and did not write “anything personal on \npostcards” out of fear that inmates, jail officials or members of the public may read his personal \nthoughts and feelings.  Ex. 6, Nemnich Decl., ¶ 2.  When Mr. Nemnich attempted to use the \n“official mail” exception to send a letter to his wife, Commander Torres “angrily yelled at” him \nfor attempting to help the ACLU in its “bullshit” lawsuit against the Jail.  Ex. 6, Nemnich Decl., \n¶ 5.  As a result of this incident, Mr. Nemnich “feel[s] completely discouraged from attempting \nto communicate with [his] family by letter.”  Ex. 6, Nemnich Decl., ¶ 8. \nPrior to the postcard policy, Mr. Abeyta sent three to five, multiple-page letters every \nweek to his girlfriend and eight-year old son.  Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl., ¶ 4.  Since the postcard policy \nwas implemented, Mr. Abeyta corresponds infrequently because the postcards provide little \nwriting space, do not provide privacy, and do not allow him to send pictures he has drawn for his \nson.  Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl. ¶ 5.  After learning of the “official mail” exception through Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel, Mr. Abeyta requested to send his personal letters as official mail.  Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl. ¶ \n8.  Commander Torres denied Mr. Abeyta’s request and angrily reprimanded him, as well as \nother inmates who wrote similar requests.   Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl., ¶ 8.

Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl. ¶ 9.  As a result, Mr. \nAbeyta has not attempted to use the official mail exception to send out the numerous personal \nletters he wishes to send to his girlfriend and son.  Ex. 4, Abeyta Decl. ¶¶ 9, 12. \nPrior to the postcard policy, Mr. Smith wrote weekly, lengthy, personal letters to his wife \nand child, who live in Japan.  Ex. 7, Smith Decl., ¶¶ 3-4.  When Mr. Smith attempted to send a \npersonal letter to his wife through the “official mail” exception, Commander Torres refused to \ngrant the request unless Mr. Smith “disguise[d]” the letter as official mail by indicating in the \nletter that he needed a copy of his son’s birth certificate from his wife.  Ex. 7, Smith Decl., ¶ 5.  \nMr. Smith followed Commander Torres’ instruction, and Commander Torres allowed the letter \nto go out as a “one-time exception” to the postcard policy.  Ex. 7, Smith Decl., ¶ 5.  Since that \ntime, both Commander Torres and Commander Hill have told Mr. Smith that if he wants to \ncorrespond with his family in Japan, he must do so on a postcard.  Ex. 7, Smith Decl., ¶ 6.   \nPrior to the postcard policy, Mr. Rios wrote multi-page, personal letters to his children \nand business partner to “keep [his] sanity” and maintain “connections with the world outside of \njail.”  Ex. 5, Rios Decl., ¶¶ 2, 8-9.  Since the postcard policy came into effect, Mr. Rios \ncorresponds with the outside world much less often, due to the “tiny writing space and the lack \nof privacy that postcards provide.”  Ex. 5, Rios Decl., ¶ 5.  Although Mr. Rios learned of the \n“official mail” exception through Plaintiffs’ counsel, he has not attempted to use the exception to \nsend personal letters, because he witnessed Commander Torres harshly reprimand three other \ninmates who attempted to do so.  Ex. 5, Rios Decl., ¶ 12.  Mr. Rios explains: \n                                                 \n3 Mr. Abeyta is currently incarcerated in the Phoenix Pod, a therapeutic community \nwhich is considered a privilege that can be revoked.

I am currently in \nthe Phoenix Program at Boulder County Jail, where I am receiving really great \ntherapy and classes.  I do not want to risk losing these programs by trying to do \nwhat Joshua Nemnich and Vinnie Abeyta did – asking permission to send \npersonal letters through the official mail exception.   \n \nEx. 5, Rios Decl., ¶13. \nARGUMENT \n \nTo obtain interim injunctive relief, the moving party must generally demonstrate “(1) a \nlikelihood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood that the movant will suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in the movant's favor; \nand (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.” RoDa Drilling Co. v. Siegal, 552 F.3d 1203, \n1208 (10th Cir. 2009).  The plaintiffs here easily satisfy this test.4   \nI.  Plaintiffs are Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Constitutional \nClaims \n“Correspondence between a prisoner and an outsider implicates the guarantee of freedom \nof speech under the First Amendment and a qualified liberty interest under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”  Treff v. Galetka, 74 F.3d 191, 194 (10th Cir. 1996) (citing Procunier v. Martinez, \n                                                 \n4 Three types of “disfavored” injunctions require a heightened standard:  “(1) preliminary \ninjunctions that alter the status quo, (2) mandatory preliminary injunctions, and (3) preliminary \ninjunctions that give the movant all the relief it would be entitled to if it prevailed in a full trial.”  \nId. at 1208 n.3.  The proposed injunction does not fall into any of the three disfavored categories.  \nBy temporarily enjoining the postcard rule, plaintiffs merely seek to return defendants’ mail \npolicy to the “last peaceable uncontested status existing between the parties before the dispute \ndeveloped.”  See Schrier v. University of Colorado, 427 F.3d 1253, 1260 (10th Cir. 2005).  \nSimilarly, the proposed injunction is prohibitory rather than mandatory because enjoining the \npostcard policy “does not compel [the defendant] to do something it was not already doing \nduring the last uncontested period preceding the injunction.”  Dominion Video Satellite, Inc. v. \nEchostar Satellite Corp., 269 F.3d 1149, 1155 (10th Cir. 2001).  Finally, the proposed injunction \nwould not give plaintiffs all the relief they would be entitled to if they prevail in a full trial: it \nmerely provides temporary, not permanent, protection for their First Amendment rights.  See \nPrairie Band of Potawatomi Indians v. Pierce, 253 F.3d 1234, 1247-48 (10th Cir. 2001). \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 17\n416 U.S. 396 (1974)).  Unlike regulations on incoming mail, which are subject to the less \nstringent test set forth in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987) (regulation valid if it is reasonably \nrelated to legitimate penological interests), regulations that infringe upon First Amendment rights \nin prisoners’ outgoing mail are subject to the stricter test set forth in Martinez.  Treff, 74 F.3d at \n194-95; see also Jordan v. Pugh, 504 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1120 (D. Colo. 2007) (invalidating \noutgoing mail regulation under Martinez test).  The reason for this distinction is that “outgoing \npersonal correspondence from prisoners . . . [does] not, by its very nature, pose a serious threat to \nprison order and security.”  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 411 (1989).  \nUnder the Martinez test, a valid limitation on a prisoner’s outgoing mail must meet two \nrequirements.  First, the “limitations on a prisoner’s First Amendment rights in his outgoing mail \n‘must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of \nexpression.’”  Treff, 74 F.3d at 195 (quoting Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413).  More specifically, the \nlimitation must further “one or more of the substantial governmental interests of security, order, \nand rehabilitation.”  Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413.   Second, “the limitation of First Amendment \nfreedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular \ngovernmental interest involved.”  Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413; Treff, 74 F.3d at 195. 5 \nA.   The Postcard Policy Substantially Burdens the First Amendment Rights of \nBoth Prisoners and Their Free-World Correspondents \nIt is undisputed that the postcard policy significantly limits the amount of written \ncorrespondence prisoners can send, Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 99:8-13, and that it may chill prisoners \nfrom writing about personal subjects, Ex. 2, Black Depo., 123:22-124:1.  And it is obvious that a \n                                                 \n5 Article II, section 10 of the Colorado Constitution provides broader protection of speech than \nthe First Amendment.  See Bock v. Westminster Mall Company, 819 P.2d 55, 59-60 (Colo. 1991). \nThus, while this brief discusses only plaintiffs’ claims under the First Amendment, a policy that \nviolates the First Amendment a fortiori violates Art. II, sec. 10. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 17\nprisoner who is allowed to send only a postcard cannot enclose drawings, newspaper clippings, \nreligious tracts, or other expressive materials.  The Supreme Court has explained that such \nrestrictions on prisoners’ written communications infringe not only the prisoners’ First \nAmendment rights, but also the rights of family members and others who wish to receive the \nprisoners’ correspondence:  \nCommunication by letter is not accomplished by the act of writing words on paper. \nRather, it is effected only when the letter is read by the addressee. Both parties to the \ncorrespondence have an interest in securing that result, and censorship of the \ncommunication between them necessarily impinges on the interest of each. . . . The wife \nof a prison inmate who is not permitted to read all that her husband wanted to say to her \nhas suffered an abridgment of her interest in communicating with him as plain as that \nwhich results from censorship of her letter to him. In either event, censorship of prisoner \nmail works a consequential restriction on the First and Fourteenth Amendments rights of \nthose who are not prisoners. \n   \nMartinez, 416 U.S. at 408-09.  Thus, the restrictions challenged here substantially implicate the \nFirst Amendment rights of the individual plaintiffs, all current and future jail prisoners, and all \npersons in the outside world who wish to read what the prisoners would like to communicate. \nB.  The Postcard Policy is Neither Necessary Nor Essential to Advance Any \nImportant or Substantial Governmental Interest  \nIn this case, Defendants identify only one interest that purportedly justifies the postcard \npolicy: preventing the kind of third-party mailings involved in the Rael/Whitehead Incident.  Ex. \n1, Hank Depo., 67:11-68:9, 83:20-85:25.  Plaintiffs agree that preventing such misuse of the mail \nis an important governmental interest.  See Martinez, 416 U.S. at 413.  However, restricting \noutgoing prisoner mail to postcards instead of letters is neither necessary nor essential to serve \nthat interest. \nAs a threshold matter, it is important to note that until 2010, the Jail freely allowed \nprisoners to send personal mail in envelopes.  Indeed, until 2010, no jail in Colorado limited \nprisoners’ outgoing mail to postcards, and no other Colorado jail currently does so.  Ex. 8, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of\n 17\nMartin Decl., ¶ 16.  Neither the Colorado Department of Corrections nor the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons limits outgoing mail to postcards.  Ex. 8, Martin Decl., ¶ 15.  The federal “supermax” \nprison in Florence, Colorado, which confines prisoners with the highest security classifications in \nthe United States, does not limit outgoing mail to postcards.  Ex. 8, Martin Decl., ¶ 15.  Thus, \nwhile all these jails and prisons presumably share the defendants’ interest in preventing \ninappropriate use of outgoing mail, not one of them resorts to the Jail’s drastic “solution.” \nThese facts alone argue powerfully against a finding that the postcard policy is \n“necessary or essential” to protect the defendants’ asserted interest.  See Martinez, 416 U.S. at \n414 n. 14 (“While not necessarily controlling, the policies followed at other well-run institutions \nwould be relevant to a determination of the need for a particular type of restriction”); Ex. 2, \nBlack Depo., 161:12-15 (BCJ does not face any special security concerns related to outgoing \nmail that other jails of similar size do not face); Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 86:11-14 (same).6   \nSteve J. Martin is an expert with over 38 years of experience in correctional \nadministration, including substantial experience in implementation and management of \ncorrespondence rules and regulations in jails and prisons.  See Ex. 8, Martin Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.  After \nreviewing voluminous materials in this case, he concludes that the postcard policy is neither \nnecessary nor essential to further the Jail’s interests: \n                                                 \n6 Not surprisingly, the postcard policy has not halted inappropriate use of outgoing mail \nby jail detainees; at least one detainee was able to send numerous postcards to his former \ndomestic partner, in violation of a protective order.  See Ex. 9, Grimaldo Police Reports, p. 6. \nIndeed, Commander Black is aware of no evidence that inmate misconduct related to the use of \noutgoing mail has decreased since implementation of the postcard policy, Black Depo., 161:3-7, \nand Chief Hank concedes that if Rael and Whitehead were currently in the Jail, the postcard \npolicy would not prevent them from writing to young girls, Hank Depo., 54:7-12.  Thus, even if \ndefendants were to assert a broader interest in preventing inappropriate use of outgoing mail, \nthese admissions make clear that the postcard policy is not “necessary or essential”—or even \neffective – to  advance that interest.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 11 of\n 17\nThe BCJ policy that limits outgoing, non-legal mail to 5.5\" x 8.5\" postcards is not \nnecessary or essential to further any legitimate interests in security or order.  Such a \npolicy unnecessarily limits inmate opportunities to engage in lawful and routinely \naccepted correspondence practices.  Moreover, such a policy is not necessary or essential \nto address the correspondence issues evident in the Rael/Whitehead incident…. \n \nEx. 8, Martin Decl., ¶ 14.   \n \nIndeed, defendants admit that the following alternatives to the postcard policy would \nhave addressed the concerns raised by the Rael/Whitehead incident: (1) pre-stamping envelopes \ngiven to detainees with BCJ’s return address, Ex. 2, Black Depo., 115:14-21; (2) watermarking \nthe writing paper given to detainees, Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 57:25-58:6; and (3) hand-searching \noutgoing mail, Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 64:21-65:4.  However, defendants never even considered \nthese or any other alternatives to the postcard policy.  Black Depo, 158:1-10.  Asked why the \nJail did not consider watermarking as an alternative, defendant Hank replied, “I believe this \npolicy is constitutional.  I’m satisfied with this policy.”  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 58:10-11, 94:10-12 \n(“You’ve talked about other policies that you believe are alternatives.  I agree that they’re \nalternatives.  This is the one I prefer”).7 \n                                                 \n7 Other less restrictive alternatives also exist.  It is settled law that jail officials may \ninspect outgoing letters to determine whether they “fall[] into a category which poses a threat, \nincluding escape plans, plans related to ongoing criminal activity, and threats of blackmail or \nextortion.”  Beville v. Ednie, 74 F.3d 210, 213-14 (10th Cir. 1996) (internal citations and \nquotations omitted).  They may also require that outgoing envelopes be left unsealed to facilitate \nthis inspection.  See Stow v. Grimaldi, 993 F.2d 1002, 1004 (1st Cir. 1993).  Thus, defendants \nhere can inspect all outgoing letters; outgoing letters sent by high-risk prisoners; outgoing letters \nthey believe may pose a security risk; or a random sample of outgoing letters.  Defendants have \nnot explained – and they will not be able to demonstrate with evidence – why these alternatives \ndo not fully satisfy security needs.  See Beerheide v. Suthers, 286 F.3d 1179, 1189 (10th Cir. \n2002) (even under the more deferential Turner test, “[i]n order to warrant deference, prison \nofficials must present credible evidence to support their stated penological goals”) (emphasis in \noriginal).  See also Johnson v. Smith, 2011 WL 344085 (N.D. Ga., Feb. 1, 2011), at *5 \n(prisoner’s challenge to jail policy limiting outgoing mail to postcards states First Amendment \nclaim; “Plaintiff may argue that Jail officials could address their concerns by the less restrictive \nmeasure of requiring that general outgoing mail be placed in unsealed envelopes . . .  instead of \naltogether limiting the type and size of the medium used for such mail”). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 12 of\n 17\nC.  Defendant’s Secret “Official Mail” Exception to the Postcard Policy Does Not \nCure its Deficiencies \nDefendants may contend that their addition of an “official mail” exception to the postcard \npolicy cures its constitutional deficiencies.  This claim fails for four independent reasons.  \nFirst, the very existence of the “official mail” exception is concealed from BCJ detainees.  \nSee pp. 2-3, supra. As Judge Krieger cogently explained in Jordan v. Pugh, 504 F. Supp. 2d \n1109, 1117-18 & n.23 (D. Colo. 2007), such a secret exception cannot undo or counteract the \nchilling effect of the policy that is actually publicized and communicated to the inmate \npopulation.  In Jordan, the prisoner plaintiff challenged a regulation that was described as the \n“Byline Regulation.”  The court properly analyzed it as chilling the expression not only of the \nplaintiff, but also of numerous other prisoners who were not before the court.  Defendants asked \nthat the court consider the challenged regulation in light of two additional documents they \ncreated in response to the lawsuit: the “ADX Institution Supplement” and “the Kenney \nMemorandum.”  In reasoning that clearly applies to this case, the court explained that neither \ndocument fundamentally alters “the chilling effect of the Byline Regulation upon an inmate’s \nfreedom of expression of ideas to news media.”  504 F. Supp. 2d at 1118.  The court explained: \nThe Institution Supplement and the Kenney Memorandum were adopted in response to \nthis lawsuit.  They do not, and cannot, change or replace the unequivocal language of the \nByline Regulation.  They can be withdrawn or further revised at any time.  In addition, \nneither the Institution Supplement nor the Kenney Memorandum have been published to \nany inmate other than [the plaintiff]. \n \nId. at 1118.  The same considerations apply in this case.  It is in response to this controversy and \nthis litigation that Defendants have repeatedly reformulated the “official mail” exception, \nwithout informing the prisoners of the changes.  This secret exception does not change the \n“unequivocal language” of the document actually distributed to prisoners, which notes only that \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 13 of\n 17\nprisoners are provided postcards on which to send correspondence.  See Ex. 3.  The secret \nexception can be withdrawn or further revised at any time.  And finally, the secret exception has \nnot been distributed or publicized to the prisoner population.   Accordingly, this Court cannot \naccept defendants’ invitation to regard their secret “official mail” exception as somehow \nreducing or eliminating the chilling effect of the restrictive postcard policy that has been \nannounced to the prisoners. \nSecond, even for those prisoners who manage to learn of the secret “official mail” \nexception, the procedural hurdles to seeking permission to send “official mail” ensure that few \nprisoners will do so.  Under the “official mail” exception, a detainee is required to first write the \nentire letter he wishes to send and give it to a supervisor before he will know whether his request \nfor an envelope will be granted.  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 77:6-12, 180:8-15.  Few detainees will go to \nthe trouble to hand-write a five-page letter if there is a substantial risk they will be denied \npermission to mail it.   \nThird, in his deposition, Chief Hank repeatedly stated that BCJ staff have broad \n“discretion” to deny requests to send letters as official mail.  See Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 123:6-22, \n124:15-125:14, 137:12-138:13,142:21-143:8, 148:1-148:15.    Yet, the “official mail” exception \ncontains no written criteria to guide Jail staff in exercising their discretion to approve or deny \nthese requests.  Ex. 1, Hank Depo., 153:2-13.  This lack of written criteria allows Jail staff to \nengage in the standardless exercise of unfettered discretion that has been repeatedly struck down \non First Amendment grounds.  In Martinez itself, the Supreme Court invalidated the outgoing \nprisoner mail regulations at issue there, finding that their vague nature “fairly invited prison \nofficials and employees to apply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards for mail \ncensorship.”  416 U.S. at 415.  Similarly, in Cofone v. Manson, 409 F. Supp. 1033 (D. Conn. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 14 of\n 17\n1976), the court relied on Martinez to invalidate a mail rule that allowed rejection of publications \nthat “obstruct rehabilitative objectives,” holding that “the first amendment will not allow a \ncatchall regulation which permits the exercise of unbridled discretion.”  Id. at 1041.   \nIt should come as no surprise that the exercise of this unbridled discretion by Jail staff to \ngrant or deny “official mail” request has resulted in arbitrary and inexplicable denials of \npermission to send “official mail.”  See, e.g., Exs. 4-7, Inmate Decls.; see also Ex. 1, Hank \nDepo., 153:2-13 (admitting that failures in training and supervision as well as lack of written \ncriteria have resulted in inconsistent application of the Jail’s “official mail” exception).    \n Finally, Chief Hank’s testimony makes clear that, notwithstanding the existence of the \n“official mail” exception, the postcard policy continues to result in censorship of core First \nAmendment-protected speech.  Chief Hank confirmed that Jail staff were acting consistently \nwith Jail policy when denying multiple “official mail” requests based on the content of the \nprisoners’ proposed letters: \nQ:  So is it fair to say that pursuant to Boulder County Sheriff’s Office official policy, \nCommander Torres had the discretion to deny an inmate’s official mail request to send a \nletter professing his innocence? \n \nA:  Yes, he has that discretion. \n \nEx. 1, Hank Depo., p. 123; see also id. at 123:6-22, 124:15-125:14, 137:12-138:13,142:21-143:8, \n148:1-148:15.  For all of these reasons, plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits \nof their First Amendment claims.   \nII.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Injury if the Preliminary Injunction is Denied \n “When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most courts hold that \nno further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”  Howard v. United States, 864 F. Supp. \n1019, 1028 (D. Colo. 1994).  More specifically, “loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”  Pacific Frontier v. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 15 of\n 17\nPleasant Grove City, 414 F.3d 1221, 1235 (10th Cir. 2005) ((quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. \n347, 373 (1976)); see also Heideman v. South Salt Lake City, 348 F.3d 1182, 1190 (10th Cir. \n2003) (holding that even a “minimal restriction” on the manner in which dancers may convey \ntheir artistic message constitutes irreparable injury).  Accordingly, when government action \nthreatens First Amendment rights, as in this case, there is a presumption of sufficient irreparable \ninjury to warrant a preliminary injunction.  Cmty. Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 660 \nF.2d 1370, 1376 (10th Cir. 1981).  \nIII.  The Balance of Equities Tips Sharply in Plaintiffs’ Favor \nIn this case, the balance of equities clearly favors the plaintiffs.  The postcard policy \nheavily burdens the First Amendment rights of both prisoners and their free-world \ncorrespondents – a burden that constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law.  By contrast, the \ndefendants will suffer no significant harm if the policy is temporarily enjoined.  The preliminary \ninjunction would merely bar the Jail from restricting outgoing prisoner mail to postcards; the Jail \nwould remain free to implement any or all of the less restrictive alternatives defendants concede \nwould address their security concerns.  See p. 10, supra.  Accordingly, the balance of equities \ntips sharply in plaintiffs’ favor.  See American Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson,  194 F.3d 1149, \n1163 (10th Cir. 1999) (“the threatened injury to Plaintiffs' constitutionally protected speech \noutweighs whatever damage the preliminary injunction may cause Defendants' inability to \nenforce what appears to be an unconstitutional statute”). \nIV.  The Injunction is in the Public Interest \n“[A]s far as the public interest is concerned, it is axiomatic that the preservation of First \nAmendment rights serves everyone’s best interest.”  Local Org. Comm., Denver Chap., Million \nMan March v. Cook, 922 F. Supp. 1494, 1501 (D. Colo. 1996); accord Elam Constr. v. Reg. \nTransp. Dist., 129 F.3d 1343, 1347 (10th Cir. 1997) (“The public interest . . . favors plaintiffs' \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 16 of\n 17\nassertion of their First Amendment rights”); Johnson, 194 F.3d at 1163 (“the preliminary \ninjunction will not be adverse to the public interest as it will protect the free expression” of \nInternet users).  The injunction plaintiffs seek would serve the public interest while leaving Jail \nofficials fully capable of addressing legitimate security concerns.   \nV.  No Security Should Be Required \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(c) provides that a preliminary injunction may issue “only if the movant \ngives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages \nsustained by any party found to have been wrongly enjoined or restrained.”  However, “trial \ncourts have wide discretion under Rule 65(c) in determining whether to require security,” RoDa \nDrilling Co., 552 F.3d at 1215 (internal quotations omitted), and may decline to require security \nin appropriate cases.  See, e.g., Winnebago Tribe of Neb. v. Stovall, 341 F.3d 1202, 1206 (10th \nCir. 2003) (no bond necessary where there was no showing of harm from injunction); Moltan \nCo. v. Eagle-Picher Indus., Inc., 55 F.3d 1171, 1176 (6th Cir. 1995) (finding no bond necessary \nwhere plaintiff had strong likelihood of success on merits).  This is a case in which plaintiffs \nhave a strong likelihood of success on the merits, and defendants will suffer no harm from the \ninjunction.  Accordingly, no security should be required. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the motion for preliminary injunction should be granted.  The \nCourt should enjoin the defendants from continuing to enforce the challenged postcard policy, or \nany other policy that limits outgoing mail to postcards, thus restoring the status quo that existed \nbefore this controversy began. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 32    Filed 02/17/11   USDC Colorado   Page 17 of\n 17\nRespectfully submitted, February 17, 2011. \n     \n    s/Mark Silverstein___________________    \n    Mark Silverstein \n    Rebecca T.

In March, 2010, the Boulder County Jail (\"Jail\") implemented a new policy that limited\nmost outgoing inmate  mail  to postcards.\n2. On August 3, 20 i 0, five inmates filed a legal challenge to that policy, arguing that the\npolicy violated inmates' First Amendment rights: Clay, et aI. v. Pelle, et aI., case number 10-cv-\n01840-WYD-BNB, United States District Court, District of  Colorado. The inmate-plaintiffs also\nfied a motion to certify the case as a class action.\n3. The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment and an injunction ordering the Jail to stop\nwhat the lawsuit called the \"postcard-only\" policy. The lawsuit does not seek monetary damages on\nbehalf of any prisoners.\n4. On March 8, 2011, the Court issued an order granting plaintiffs' motion for class\ncertification for the class defined as \"all current and future prisoners in the Boulder County Jail who\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 48-1    Filed 04/27/11   USDC Colorado   Page 19\n of 19\nare subject to or affected by the defendaiits' postcard-only policy.\" The Court appointed attorneys\nworkiiig for the American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\") of Colorado and the ACLU National\nPrison Project to serve as counsel for the class.\n5. On April 8,2011, the Jail rescinded the postcard-only policy and allowed inmates to\nletters on paper designated by the Jail for such use and in envelopes\nwrite and send personal \nsupplied by the Jail without having to first ask, and/or receive, permission to do so.\n6. The parties have now agreed to a proposed settlement that wil resolve all issues in the\ncase. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e), this notice is provided to class members to advise them of\nthe proposed settlement, which are summarized as follows:\nthe tenus of \na. The Jail wil henceforth maintain an inmate outgoing mail policy that: (1) does\nnot require inmates to use postcards for their outgoing mail; and (2) allows\nletters on paper designated by the Jail for such use and\ninmates to write personal \nin envelopes supplied by the Jail without having to first ask, and/or receive,\npermission to do so.\nb. This settlement does not affect the Jail's previously established power under the\nlaw to inspect outgoing mail and to read outgoing non-legal maiL.\nreasonable attorney's fees and\nc. Counsel for Plaintiffs are entitled to an award of \ncosts to be paid by the Defendant. The parties have agreed that $65,000\nrepresents a reasonable amount.\n7. The Court has set a date of for a hearing to determine whether the\nsettlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. Any class member who objects to the proposed\nsettlement may submit an objection.

Hank, in his official capacity as administrator of the Boulder County Jail and \nDivision Chief of the Boulder County Sheriff Office, \n \n \n  Defendants. \n \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO CERTIFY CLASS AND APPOINT CLASS \nCOUNSEL \n \n \nD.C.Colo.LR 7.1 Conference \n  Plaintiffs’ counsel has not consulted opposing counsel with respect to this motion \nbecause no counsel has yet appeared. \nINTRODUCTION \n \n  Plaintiffs are prisoners in the Boulder County Jail in Boulder, Colorado.  They \nbring this action to challenge a new jail policy under which, with narrow exceptions, all \noutgoing mail sent by prisoners must be written on postcards supplied by the jail \n(hereinafter the “postcard-only policy”).  Plaintiffs allege that this policy violates their \nrights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \n  1\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 2 of 10\nArticle II, Sections 10 and 25 of the Colorado Constitution.  They seek injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief only; no damages are sought.   \n  Plaintiffs now move this Court to certify, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), a \nclass comprising “all current and future prisoners in the Boulder County Jail who are \nsubject to or affected by the defendants’ postcard-only policy.”  Plaintiffs also ask the \nCourt to appoint the undersigned as class counsel pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g).  For \nthe reasons set forth below, the motion should be granted. \nARGUMENT \nI.   Principles applicable to class certification. \nIn ruling on a motion for class certification, “the district court must determine \nwhether the four threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) are met.  If the court determines \nthat they are, it must then examine whether the action falls within one of three categories \nof suits set forth in Rule 23(b).”  Adamson v. Bowen, 855 F.2d 668, 675 (10th Cir. 1988) \n(footnote omitted).   \nClass certification is solely a procedural issue, and the court’s inquiry is limited to \ndetermining whether the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.  Eisen v. \nCarlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177-78 (1974); Anderson v. City of Albuquerque, \n690 F.2d 796, 799 (10th Cir. 1982).  In ruling on the motion for class certification, the \ncourt must take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true.  J.B. ex rel. Hart v. \nValdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n.7 (10th Cir. 1999).  If the court has some doubt, it should \nerr in favor of certification, since the decision is subject to later modification.  Esplin v. \nHirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 99 (10th Cir. 1968); see also Anderson v. Boeing Co., 222 F.R.D. \n  2\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 3 of 10\n521, 531 (N.D. Okla. 2004) (same, citing Esplin); Harrington v. City of Albuquerque, 222 \nF.R.D. 505, 508-09 (D.N.M. 2004) (same).   \nII.  The requirements of Rule 23(a) are satisfied. \nIn order for a class to be certified, the following requirements must be satisfied: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims \nor defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).    As plaintiffs demonstrate below, all four requirements of Rule \n23(a) are easily met in this case. \n  A.  Impracticability of Joinder – Rule 23(a)(1).    \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that “the class [be] so numerous that joinder of all \nmembers is impracticable.”  There can be no doubt that the proposed class satisfies this \nrequirement.    \nThe jail’s average daily population is about 400 prisoners, all of whom are subject \nto the postcard-only policy.  Thus, based only on the number of class members in the jail \nat any one time, the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) are satisfied.  See Rex v. Owens ex rel. \nState of Okla., 585 F.2d 432, 436 (10th Cir. 1978) (“Class actions have been deemed \nviable in instances where as few as 17 to 20 persons are identified as the class”); Horn v. \nAssociated Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 555 F.2d 270, 275-76 (10th Cir. 1977) (trial court \nerred in denying class certification on numerosity grounds where class consisted of \nbetween 41 and 46 persons).      \nMoreover, the proposed class includes not only current prisoners, but future \nprisoners as well.  In any given year, the jail books thousands of prisoners, some of \nwhom stay for only a relatively short time.  The fluid nature of the class, and the \n  3\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 4 of 10\ninclusion in the class of future prisoners, whose identities obviously cannot now be \nascertained, makes joinder of all class members not just impracticable but literally \nimpossible.  See Skinner v. Uphoff, 209 F.R.D. 484, 488 (D. Wyo. 2002) (finding \ncertification appropriate for class of current and future prisoners seeking injunctive relief; \n“[a]s members in futuro, they are necessarily unidentifiable, and therefore joinder is \nclearly impracticable”).  The requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) are satisfied.1 \nB.  Commonality – Rule 23(a)(2). \nRule 23(a)(2) “requires only a single question of law or fact common to the entire \nclass.”  D.G. ex rel. Stricklin  v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1195 (10th Cir. 2010).  For \nthat reason, the commonality requirement is “easily met.”  1 Herbert B. Newberg, \nNewberg on Class Actions § 3.10, at 274 (4th ed. 2002) (hereinafter “Newberg”).   \nIn this case, the members of the proposed class are all housed in a single facility, \nand all of them are subject to defendants’ postcard-only policy.  Accordingly, there are \nquestions of fact that are common to the class, including (but not limited to) the \nfollowing: \n1.  The scope and nature of defendants’ postcard-only policy. \n2.  The scope, criteria, and process for invoking the alleged “legal mail” \nexception to defendants’ postcard-only policy. \n                                                 \n1 See also Monaco v. Stone, 187 F.R.D. 50, 61 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (fluidity of class of \ncriminal defendants makes certification particularly appropriate); Dean v. Coughlin, 107 \nF.R.D. 331, 332 (S.D.N.Y. 1985) (“the fluid composition of a prison population is \nparticularly well-suited for class status”); Andre H. v. Ambach, 104 F.R.D. 606, 611 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1985) (“The fact that the [detention center] population ... is constantly \nrevolving establishes sufficient numerosity to make joinder of the class members \nimpracticable”); Green v. Johnson, 513 F. Supp. 965, 975 (D. Mass. 1981) (certifying \nclass of prisoners “in light of the fact that the inmate population at these facilities is \nconstantly revolving”).  \n  4\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 5 of 10\n3.  The scope, criteria, and process for invoking the alleged “official mail” \nexception to defendants’ postcard-only policy.   \nQuestions of law common to the class include (but are not limited to) the \nfollowing: \n1.  Whether the application of the jail’s postcard-only policy violates \nprisoners’ rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n2.  Whether the application of the jail’s postcard-only policy violates \nprisoners’ rights under Article II, Sections 10 and 25 of the \nColorado Constitution.   \nWhile class members will inevitably be affected in different ways by the postcard-only \npolicy, “[f]actual differences between class members’ claims do not defeat certification \nwhere common questions of law exist.”  Stricklin, 594 F.3d at 1195.   \nPlaintiffs have alleged that the injuries and threatened injuries detailed in the \nComplaint—both those of the named plaintiffs and those of the class—stem from a single \nwritten policy of the defendants:  the postcard-only policy.  This fact alone requires a \nfinding of commonality.  See Skinner, 209 F.R.D. at 488 (commonality requirement \nsatisfied where “this case revolves around a common nucleus of operative facts, namely \nthe policies and customs of the prison regarding inmate-on-inmate violence”). \nThe controlling questions of fact and law in this case are common to the entire class.  \nAccordingly, the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is satisfied. \n  5\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 6 of 10\n   C.  Typicality – Rule 23(a)(3).    \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative \nparties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.”  In this case, the claims \nasserted by the class representatives coincide precisely with the claims asserted on behalf \nof the class.   \nAlthough the challenged policies and practices may affect different class members \nin different ways, that does not defeat a finding of typicality.  According to the leading \ntreatise on class actions:   \nTypicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the class \nrepresentative and not to the specific facts from which it arose or to the \nrelief sought.  Factual differences will not render a claim atypical if the \nclaim arises from the same event or practice or course of conduct that \ngives rise to the claims of the class members, and if it is based on the same \nlegal theory. \n \n1 Newberg, § 3.15, at 335.  The Tenth Circuit has often reiterated the well-settled \nprinciple that individual factual differences do not defeat typicality.  “[T]ypicality exists \nwhere, as here, all class members are at risk of being subjected to the same harmful \npractices, regardless of any class member’s individual circumstances.”  Stricklin, 594 \nF.3d at 1199; see also Adamson, 855 F.2d at 676 (“differing fact situations of class \nmembers do not defeat typicality under Rule 23(a)(3) so long as the claims of the class \nrepresentative and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory”).  That \nis precisely the case here.   All class members are at risk of being subjected – indeed, are \nsubjected – to defendants’ postcard-only policy.  The claims of the class representatives \nare based on the same legal theory as the claims of the class members – that the policy \nviolates the free expression guarantees of the United States and Colorado Constitutions.    \nThe typicality requirement is met. \n  6\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 7 of 10\nD.  Adequacy of Representation – Rule 23(a)(4). \nAdequacy of representation involves two inquiries:  “(1) do the named plaintiffs \nand their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members and (2) will the \nnamed plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the \nclass?”  Rutter & Willbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 1180, 1187-88 (10th Cir. \n2002) (quoting Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 1998)).   These criteria \nare clearly satisfied in this case.  There is no conflict between plaintiffs or their counsel \nand other class members.  Plaintiffs are represented by attorneys associated with the \nACLU of Colorado and the National Prison Project of the ACLU Foundation, who are \nexperienced in class action cases in general and class action challenges to prison and jail \npractices in particular. \nIII.   Class certification is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).   \nCertification is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) when \nthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that \napply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  “The writers of Rule 23 intended that subsection (b)(2) foster \ninstitutional reform by facilitating suits that challenge widespread rights violations of \npeople who are individually unable to vindicate their own rights.”  Baby Neal v. Casey, \n43 F.3d 48, 64 (3d Cir. 1994).  Recognizing these principles, the Tenth Circuit has \nexplained that Rule 23(b)(2) is “well suited” to cases in which “plaintiffs attempt to bring \nsuit on behalf of a shifting prison population.”  Shook v. El Paso County, 386 F.3d 963, \n972 (10th Cir. 2004) (Shook I). \n  The Tenth Circuit recently summarized the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2): \n  7\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 8 of 10\nRule 23(b)(2) imposes two independent, but related requirements upon \nthose seeking class certification. First, plaintiffs must demonstrate \ndefendants' actions or inactions are based on grounds generally applicable \nto all class members.  Second, plaintiffs must also establish the injunctive \nrelief they have requested is appropriate for the class as a whole. Together \nthese requirements demand cohesiveness among class members with \nrespect to their injuries[.] \n \nThis cohesiveness, in turn, has two elements. First, plaintiffs must \nillustrate the class is sufficiently cohesive that any classwide injunctive \nrelief satisfies Rule 65(d)'s requirement that every injunction “state its \nterms specifically; and describe in reasonable detail ... the act or acts \nrestrained or required.” Second, cohesiveness also requires that class \nmembers' injuries are sufficiently similar that they can be remedied in a \nsingle injunction without differentiating between class members.  Rule \n23(b)(2)'s bottom line, therefore, demands at the class certification stage \nplaintiffs describe in reasonably particular detail the injunctive relief they \nseek such that the district court can at least conceive of an injunction that \nwould satisfy Rule 65(d)'s requirements, as well as the requirements of \nRule 23(b)(2). \n \nStricklin, 594 F.3d at 1199-1200 (internal quotation marks, citations, brackets omitted).   \n  These requirements are amply satisfied in this case.  All class members \nhave suffered the same injury:  a limitation on their ability to send outgoing \ncorrespondence that is restricted or prohibited by defendants’ postcard-only policy.2  \nPlaintiffs have described an injunction that would remedy all class members’ injuries, \nand that satisfies the strictures of Rule 65(d).  See Complaint, Prayer for Relief (asking \n                                                 \n2 Of course it is not required that all class members have actually been denied the ability \nto send a specific piece of outgoing correspondence: \n \nRule 23(b)(2) does not require Named Plaintiffs to prove [defendant’s] \ncontroverted policies or practices actually harm or impose a risk of harm upon \nevery class member at the class certification stage.  … [C]ertification is \nappropriate even if the defendant’s action or inaction “has taken effect or is \nthreatened only as to one or a few members of the class, provided it is based on \ngrounds which have general application to the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), \n1966 Amendment advisory committee note (emphasis added). \n \nStricklin, 594 F.3d at 1201.   \n  8\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 9 of 10\nthat the Court “[p]ermanently enjoin the defendants from continuing to enforce the \nchallenged postcard-only policy, or any other policy that limits outgoing mail to \npostcards, thus restoring the status quo that existed before this controversy began”).  This \nis not a case in which “redressing the class members’ injuries requires time-consuming \ninquiry into individual circumstances or characteristics of class members,” Shook v. El \nPaso County, 543 F.3d 597, 604 (10th Cir. 2008) (Shook II), or in which plaintiffs request \ninjunctive relief “that simply prescribes ‘adequate’ or appropriate’ levels of services,” Id. \nat 606.  Rather, consistent with other cases in which (b)(2) certification has been \napproved by the Tenth Circuit, plaintiffs here “concretely ask[] that the defendants be \nordered to cease certain behaviors.”  Id. at 609.  The requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are \nsatisfied.   \nIV.  The Court should appoint the undersigned as class counsel. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1) provides that “unless a statute provides otherwise, a court \nthat certifies a class must appoint class counsel.”   \nFactors relevant to the appointment of class counsel are the work counsel has \ndone in identifying or investigating potential claims in the action; counsel's \nexperience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of \nclaims asserted in the action; counsel's knowledge of the applicable law; and the \nresources that counsel will commit to representing the class. \n \nMaez v. Springs Automotive Group, LLC, ___ F.R.D. ___, 2010 WL 2543553, at *6  (D. \nColo. 2010).   \n  All of these factors militate in favor of appointing the undersigned as class \ncounsel.  As already noted, the undersigned counsel are associated with the ACLU of \nColorado and the ACLU National Prison Project.  They are thoroughly familiar with the \napplicable law and have extensive experience in handling class action, civil rights, and \n  9\n\nCase 1:10-cv-01840-WYD -BNB   Document 2    Filed 08/03/10   USDC Colorado   Page 10 of 10\nprisoners’ rights litigation.
