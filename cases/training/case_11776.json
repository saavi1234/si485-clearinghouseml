Plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, compensatory damages,  attorney's fees, and costs. </p><p>On August 07, 2008, Plaintiffs moved to certify a class defined as \"[a]ll current and future participants in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or handicaps of themselves or someone in their household, need assistance in searching for suitable dwellings to lease under the program.\" On March 09, 2009, the Court ( Judge Janet Bond Arterton) granted the class certification. </p><p>After a nine-day bench trial, the District Court entered judgment on March 29, 2010, finding in favor of Defendants on all claims and vacating its earlier class certification order. The District Court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to prove Defendants' liability on any of the counts.  The Court also held that Plaintffs have no private right of action to enforce enforce certain regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\").  Finally, the Court found insufficient evidence that Defendants discriminated against the three named Plaintiffs, or that Defendants' conduct toward them deprived them of meaningful access to the benefits of the Section 8 Program. The detailed facts and reasoning are fully set forth in the District Court's Memorandum of Decision on March 29, 2010.</p><p>Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit. On May 04, 2011, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision in a reported opinion.</p><p></p>",

LEGAL STANDARD \n  Plaintiffs seeking certification of a class action under the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, “ must demonstrate that the . . . case (1) conforms to the four requirements of \nRule 23(a), and (2) fits into one of the three categories under Rule 23(b).”  Amone v. \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 2 of 15\nAveiro, 226 F.R.D. 677, 682 (D. Haw.  2005).  Courts should consider the allegations \nmade by a proposed class in the class complaint as true for purposes of deciding the \nmotion to certify.  See Shelter Realty Corp. v. Allied Maintenance Corp., 574 F.2d 656, \n661 n. 15 (2d Cir.1978) (“it is proper to accept the complaint allegations as true in a class \ncertification motion”). “When deciding a motion for class certification, the only issue is \nwhether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met, and not whether the plaintiffs have \nstated a cause of action or will prevail on the merits. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 \nU.S. 156, 177-78, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974).” Matyasovszky, v. Housing \nAuthority of the City of Bridgeport, 226 F.R.D. 35, 40-42 (D. Conn. 2005).   \n  “The four requirements of Rule 23(a) are as follows: (1) the class is so numerous \nthat joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact \ncommon to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \nthe claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); Caridad v. Metro-North \nCommuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291 (2d Cir.1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1107, 120 S. Ct. \n1959, 146 L.Ed.2d 791 (2000).”  Id. \n  Plaintiffs seeking certification must also demonstrate that they qualify under one \nof the subdivisions of subpart (b) of Rule 23.  Subpart (b)(2) permits certification if the \naction is one that is “appropriate” for final injunctive relief or declaratory relief. 1  In the \n                                                 \n1 Subpart (b)(2) of Rule 23 reads in its entirety:  \n \n“(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally \napplicable to the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or  \ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.” \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 3 of 15\nSecond Circuit, injunctive relief must predominate in order for a class to be certified \nunder Rule 23(b)(2). The District of Connecticut has specifically recognized that “the fact \nthat monetary damages are an element of the relief sought does not preclude certification \nunder Rule 23(b)(2).  See, e.g., Duprey v. State of Connecticut Dept. of Motor Vehicles, \n191 F.R.D. 329 (D. Conn. 2000).” Id. \nII.  ARGUMENT \n \n \n  A.  PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION \n \n  Plaintiffs propose the following class definition: \n \nAll  current  and  future  participants  in  the  Section  8  Housing  Choice \nVoucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or handicaps of \nthemselves or someone in their household, need assistance in searching for \nsuitable dwellings to lease under the program. \n \n    1.  Disabled Section 8 Participant Families  \n \n  All households that include a disabled person who currently participate in the \nSection 8 program should be considered members of the class for purposes whether or \nnot they currently need to move, because many Section 8 households move multiple \ntimes during participation in the program. Even if a family does not need search \nassistance now, it is likely to need it in the future. They may move by choice, or because \nthe unit they are occupying is in foreclosure, or has failed a Section 8 inspection due to \nlack of repairs to the building. The named plaintiffs offer some typical examples of this \nphenomenon.  Karl Hunter currently hopes to move out of an inner city rooming house to \nan accessible one-bedroom apartment that has a stove.  See Hunter Adffidavit, attached \n                                                                                                                                                \n \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 4 of 15\nhereto as Exhibit E.  Rebecca Taylor has just been forced to move due to a foreclosure, \nand is now in a suitable two-bedroom apartment.  However, the Section 8 program will \nrequire Taylor to move to smaller unit in the future when her children move out of the \nhouse.   \n    2.  Disabled Applicant Families \n  The plaintiff class also includes all disabled Section 8 applicants, because all of \nthese households must move at least once—that is, when they first join the program.  \nThus, for purposes of certification under Count I, applicants and other individuals who \nhave a future right to a Section 8 voucher administered by HANH should be considered \nmembers of the class.  Disabled applicants are expressly included in the language of 24 \nC.F.R. § 8.28.  Count III therefore alleges that HANH violated the National Housing Act \nby failing to comply with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 by affirmatively offering the list and search \nassistance to all disabled Section 8 applicants and participants alike, and all of these \napplicants should be considered putative class members. \n \nB.  THE PROPOSED CLASS MEETS ALL RULE 23(a) REQUIREMENTS \n \n  1.  Numerosity \n \n  Of the 1,640 new Section 8 vouchers that HANH issued between 2003 and 2006, \nthe defendants indicate that 386,2 or 24%, went to households that included a disabled \n                                                 \n2  The number of disabled families provided by the defendants errs on the low side, \nbecause it fails to include some households with disabled family members.  For example, \nHANH’s computer records do not identify as disabled Destiny A., a severely asthmatic \nchild, even though HANH admits that she has disabilities sufficient to justify a \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 5 of 15\nperson.  See Ex. 15 to Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunctive \nRelief.  Assuming for purposes of this motion that the percentage of HANH Section 8 \nhouseholds that include a person with disabilities remains constant from their receipt of a \nvoucher onward,3 then HANH’s current total of 2,879 Section 8 households is likely to \ninclude 691 households that include a person with disabilities.  This number of potential \nplaintiffs is so large that joinder of all claimants would impose a burden on both the court \nsystem and the plaintiffs, further delaying resolution of their needs for assistance.  For \nthis reason alone, joinder is impracticable.  See, e.g., Diaz v. Hillsborough County \nHospital Authority, 165 F.R.D. 689, 693 (M.D. Fla. 1996) (finding joinder of 383 \npatients impracticable based on the number of putative class members). \n  Yet the putative class is far larger than the number of current participants. Current \nand future applicants are also entitled to be given a list of available, accessible apartments \nknown to HANH, and advised that HANH will provide search assistance if necessary. As \n                                                                                                                                                \nreasonable accommodation and it ultimately granted her family such an accommodation.  \nSee Redacted File A at p. A-1 and A-8, attached hereto as Exhibit A.   \n \n3  This assumption is likely to be overly optimistic, given that 26% of HANH vouchers \nwent unused last year—up from 13% in 2006.  See HANH Annual Plans for FY 2006 \nand 2008, attached hereto as Exhibit B.  Declining voucher utilization during a period \nwhen the rental market in New Haven was very tight suggests that some of the voucher \nunderultilization could be attributable to HANH’s failure to assist disabled applicants in \nfinding and leasing an apartment.  In addition, some applicants may have been purged \nfrom HANH’s waiting list because they failed to respond during the years of waiting for \na voucher, but who would have persevered had they known that they had the right to \nreceive search assistance upon being issued a voucher.   Likewise, if HANH had \naffirmatively offered search assistance, such assistance may have provided some now-\nterminated disabled Section 8 households the support needed to keep participating in the \nprogram.  These factors indicate that the starting number of disabled households who \nwere eligible for or were actually issued a Section 8 vouchers may have been \nsignificantly higher than the number of disabled participant households suggests.  \n \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 6 of 15\nHANH has never offered either the list or the assistance to any new voucher holder, the \nnumber of class members affected by the civil rights violations alleged in Count III is \nsimply equal to the total number of disabled applicants and potential applicants to whom \nHANH has, or will in the future, issue vouchers. The fact that it is impossible to tell how \nmany of these disabled families newly admitted to the Section 8 program will need search \nassistance at the moment when they are issued the voucher mitigates in favor of \ncertification.  See Amone, 226 F.R.D. at 684-85 (finding numerosity requirement met \nwhere identifiable members of putative class were estimated at as few as 60 to 100, but \njoinder was rendered impracticable because defendant housing authority had failed to \nimplement any “notice and procedure whereby tenants would be informed of their \nrights”).  \n  Other courts have specifically noted that applicants for subsidized housing \nprograms are likely to have characteristics, such as lack of financial resources and being \nat risk of becoming homeless, that make joinder especially impracticable.  See, e.g.,  \nMatyasovszky at 40-41 (certifying class, based in part on finding that a class composed \nof disabled applicants for low-income housing is “necessarily fluid”).  Robidoux v. \nCelani, 987 F.2d 931 (2d Cir.1993) (finding numerosity requirement met where plaintiffs \nshowed evidence that at least 22 cases in which benefits were delayed occurred each month). \nPutative class members in government benefits cases, whether applicants or participants, \nare also poor candidates for joinder because they are in an especially vulnerable position. \n  In this case, most applicants and participants are aware that the Section 8 staff has \na great deal of discretion over certain aspects of their cases, including whether they will \n  6 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 7 of 15\nbe admitted to the program.  They are therefore less likely to create work for the staff by \nasking for search assistance, even if they need it.  Many disabled applicants are further \nimpeded in their ability to make known their needs by the very disabilities that cause \nthem to need search assistance, or by limited literacy skills. Some disabled applicants \nwho suffer from severe depression or other disabilities with behavioral symptoms may \nhave given up on the Section 8 application process altogether, abandoning their spot on \nthe waiting list, because they doubted their ability to use the voucher to lease an \naccessible unit.   Others may have persevered, waiting years to reach the top of the \nwaiting list, receive their vouchers, and yet still fail to lease a unit without ever \nunderstanding that they were entitled to search assistance under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28.  \n    2.  Commonality \n \n  Defendants have acted uniformly with respect to the proposed class, by refusing \nto provide either mobility counseling or a listing of accessible, available units.  “[I]n a \ncivil rights suit, . . .commonality is satisfied where the lawsuit challenges a system-wide \npractice or policy that affects all of the putative class members.” Armstrong v. Davis, 275  \nF.3d 849, 868 (9th Cir.2001).   \n      a.   Refusal to provide search assistance \n  Prior to the start of this litigation, each disabled Section 8 participant who \nrequested search assistance from HANH in writing received a similar letter from \nHANH’s Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator.  The response letter neither denied \nnor granted the request, instead advising that: \nYou do not need to request an accommodation in order to move to a \ndifferent apartment that is better suited to your needs.  As a Section 8 \n  7 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 8 of 15\nparticipant, you may select to live in any eligible apartment in the private \nmarket. If you would like to move from your current apartment, you \nshould contact your caseworker4 in the Service Center in order for HANH \nto issue you a new voucher for your apartment search.  See Redacted File \nG, attached hereto as Exhibit G.   \n \nAs of August 2007, HANH had apparently started stating in its response letter that the \nrequest for a reasonable accommodation was “granted.”  See Redacted File H, attached \nhereto as Exhibit H. Yet the primary instruction contained in the response letter remains \nthe same, directing the household to contact its Section 8 specialist.   Id.  HANH’s \nReasonable Accommodations Coordinator at that time, William Heinrichs, also \nconfirmed under deposition what he stated in the letter: even where HANH had \nempowered him to communicate to a Section 8 participant that their request for search \nassistance had been granted, it was not his responsibility to personally provide this search \nassistance. \n  However, when disabled households contact their Section 8 specialists, they \nfind—as Rebecca Taylor did—that these specialists also believe that it is not their \nresponsibility to provide search assistance.  The recent testimony of a Section 8 \nspecialist, Lashanda Jones, is extraordinarily clear on this point: \nQ:  Have you ever personally used that available accessible units list to help find \nsomebody housing? \nA:  No. \nQ:  That is because you don’t do that activity at all? You don’t find units for people?  \nA:   Yes. That’s correct. \n                                                 \n4  The staff persons who currently serve the functions formerly provided by persons with \nthe job title of “caseworker” now bear the job title “Section 8 specialist.” \n  8 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 9 of 15\nQ:  Never have, even once? \nA:  Never have. \nSee Jones Depo. at p. 68, line 20 to page 69, line 2, attached hereto as Exhibit C.  The \ntestimony above is from a deposition taken July 25, 2008, in which Jones was asked to \ndescribe HANH’s present manner of providing search assistance to disabled Section 8 \nhouseholds. Jones went on to confirm that she was describing the practices of all HANH \nSection 8 specialists, not just her own practices:  \nQ:  Have you been told you should be doing that? \nA:  No. \nQ:  Do you know of any other Section 8 specialist who does that? \nA:  No, no. \nId., page 69, lines 8-13.  Jones also stated these practices have remained unchanged \nthroughout her five years of service as a HANH Section 8 specialist.   \n  In sum, if HANH’s policy changed after being sued in 2007, it was only a \nsuperficial alteration. The evidence shows that all members of HANH staff have always \ndisavowed any responsibility for actually providing search assistance. Whether or not the \ndefendants claim to have adopted a new policy of providing search assistance to disabled \nhouseholds, it is clear that no one at HANH is actually providing it.   \n    b.  Refusal to provide a list of available, accessible units \n  On May 6, 2008, the defendants promised this Court to provide an apartment \nlisting in satisfaction of their obligations under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) within ninety days.  \nOn August 4, 2008, HANH provided counsel to the plaintiffs with a listing of building \n  9 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 10 of 15\ncomplexes that contain accessible units. See August 4, 2008 Accessible Apartment \nListing, attached hereto as Exhibit D. It offers no clues whatsoever about the availability \nof the accessible units.  In this manner, HANH continues its practice of refusing to \ncomply with the regulation. \n  3.  Typicality \n  Proposed representative plaintiffs need not suffer from the same type of disability \nas each and every class member to be members of the same class. “The typicality inquiry \nis intended to assess whether the case can be efficiently maintained as a class action and \nwhether the named plaintiffs have incentives that align with those of absent class \nmembers so as to assure that the absentees' interests will be fairly represented.”   \nMatyasovszky, 226 F.R.D. at 42.  In the context of class actions seeking access to \ngovernmental programs, the typicality requirement is “generally satisfied if the proposed \nnamed plaintiffs are “subject to the same statute, regulation or policy as class members.” \nId. (citing 7 Newberg on Class Actions § 23:4 (4th ed.). \n  The typicality requirement is met for Counts I and III of the Taylor Amended \nComplaint.5  With respect to Count I, Karl Hunter and Rebecca Taylor are each persons \nwhose disabilities have caused them to experience extra difficulty making use of Section \n8 vouchers.  See Hunter Affidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit E; Taylor Affidavit, Ex. 4 to \nPlaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunctive Relief. They will continue \nto need mobility counseling each time they must move. They have each suffered from \ndiscrimination, as HANH provided mobility counseling and updated apartment listings to \n                                                 \n5  Plaintiffs have moved for an enlargement of the deadline for moving for class \ncertification with respect to Count II, based on the need to complete additional discovery. \n  10 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 11 of 15\nnon-disabled households but refused to offer it to them. As to Count III, the defendants’ \nfailure to affirmatively offer the apartment listing and search assistance opportunities \nrequired by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) affects all Section 8 participants in essentially the \nsame way, including Hunter and Taylor.  HANH’s noncompliance with the affirmative \nobligations declared by this regulation not only deprives currently participating disabled \nhouseholds of help, but also keeps potential Section 8 participants, like Karl Hunter, from \nbecoming aware that they may be eligible for help that would give them a real chance of \nbeing able to lease an accessible apartment through the program.  \n  Any permanent handicap or disability is likely to make searching for an apartment \nmore difficult.  While the specific difficulties created by the type of disability will surely \nvary, these differences do not divide the class in any relevant way because the defendants \ndo not use disability-specific rules to determine whether to assist disabled families.  \nInstead, HANH uniformly denies mobility counseling to all disabled families—unless \nthey retain counsel. Even then, disabled households who have nominally been offered \nmobility counseling by HANH as a result of legal action are in fact denied it by HANH’s \nfailure, for over a year, to hire a mobility counseling firm.  See July 9, 2008 Quarterly \nReport at p. F-3, attached hereto as Exhibit F.  Thus, in practice, HANH uniformly denies \nmobility counseling to all disabled Section 8 households.   \n  Based on the above criteria, Rebecca Taylor and Karl Hunter are both typical of \nthis class.  Neither Taylor nor Hunter has been provided with a list of available, \naccessible units. See Hunter Affidavit, attached hereto as Exhibit E; Taylor Affidavit,  \nEx. 4 to Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Injunctive Relief. Both have \n  11 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 12 of 15\nexperienced HANH’s failure to either offer or actually provide mobility counseling to \nthose disabled Section 8 households who need it.  Id.   \n  4.  Adequacy \n \n  The adequacy inquiry focuses on whether the named representatives of the \nproposed class have interests antagonistic to those of the class. Diaz, 165 F.R.D. at 693.  \nIn this case, the plaintiffs interests do not conflict in any way with those of the rest of the \nputative class members.   Moreover, by obtaining counsel, each of the proposed name \nplaintiffs has already demonstrated the capacity to vigorously pursue the vindication of \nthe rights of the entire class.  See Ex. 22 to Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of \nPreliminary Injunctive Relief at ¶2 - ¶4. \n \nC.  THE PROPOSED CLASS MEETS ALL RULE 23(b)(2) REQUIREMENTS \n \n  The proposed plaintiff class falls squarely within the parameters for a traditional \n(b)(2) class based on allegations that the defendants have acted or refused to act “on \ngrounds generally applicable to the class,” by adhering to a discriminatory policy, pattern \nand/or practice of failing to provide the listing and mobility counseling services to \ndisabled Section 8 households that HANH readily provides to non-disabled households. \n“Clarification of the meaning of the subpart (b)(2) . . . is provided by the Federal Rules \nAdvisory Committee's Notes to the 1966 Amendments to Rule 23 under which subpart \n(b)(2) was created. The applicable note states that action or inaction is directed to a class \nwithin the meaning of [subpart (b)(2)] even if it has taken effect or is threatened only as \nto one or a few members of the class, provided it is based on grounds which have general \n  12 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 13 of 15\napplication to the class.”  Arnold v. United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc., 158 F.R.D. 439, \n453-54 (N.D. Cal. 1994).   \n  Here, many members of the proposed class have been affected, although only a \nfew may realize it.  Some have engaged in the lengthy process of asking for mobility \ncounseling as a reasonable accommodation, only to receive a patronizing denial of \nresponsibility from HANH’s reasonable accommodations coordinators, in the form of a \nreminder that “you may select to live in any eligible apartment.”  Others have been told \nthat their request for search assistance was granted, only to inquire further and learn that \nno one was prepared to assist them.  In essence, these letters show the disabled household \nthat all they can expect from its Section 8 specialist is a voucher—the same paper work \nthat housing authorities must produce when any Section 8 household moves.  In the face \nof this record, whether or not HANH claims to have changed its official policy, see \nsubsection II.B. 2, infra, any such change is so clearly motivated by a desire to avoid \nfurther liability that it has no bearing on class certification. \n \nIII.  CONCLUSION \n  The proposed class meets the prerequisites for certification. Proposed named \nplaintiffs Hunter and Taylor respectfully ask the Court to be mindful that unusually high \nnumbers of putative class members are being required to move or experiencing \nhomelessness, due to the current turbulent housing market. For this reason, they urge the \nCourt to certify their class at the earliest possible opportunity. \n  13 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 47    Filed 08/07/08   Page 14 of 15\n \n          Respectfully submitted by, \n                         \n          ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS \n          /s/________________________ \n          Jennifer C.

This is an action to \nrequire the defendants to help Ms. Taylor use her Section 8 subsidy to rent accessible housing.  \nMs. Taylor participates in the federal Section 8 program, administered in New Haven by the \nHousing Authority of the City of New Haven (“HANH”).  Unable to navigate her wheelchair \ndown the steps to the apartment building where she now lives, Ms. Taylor is exposed to danger \nfrom accidents or intruders whenever she is home alone. \n  Upon information and belief, her situation is similar to that of a significant number of \nother Section 8 participants.  The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and \ncompensatory damages to the named plaintiff, attorney’s fees and costs of litigation under the \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 2 of 12\nFair Housing Act Amendments, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the National Housing \nAct.   \nHISTORY OF NONCOMPLIANCE BY THE DEFENDANTS \n1.  HANH is a recipient of funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) with which it administers the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher \nprogram in New Haven (“Section 8”). \n2.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, HUD requires recipient housing authorities to assist disabled \nindividuals and their families who are attempting to use their Section 8 vouchers to find \naccessible dwellings.  The regulation specifies, inter alia, that: \n“(a)  . . . [A] recipient administering a Section 8 . . .housing voucher program shall: . . . . \n (3) When issuing a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher to a family which includes an \nindividual with handicaps include a current listing of available accessible units known to the \nPHA and, if necessary, otherwise assist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling \nunit.” \n3.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, HUD additionally requires recipient housing authorities to \nreasonably accommodate disabled individuals and their families where necessary to allow them \nto participate in the Section 8 program.   \n4.  In or about 1994, HUD reviewed HANH to assess its compliance with Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  As a result, HANH entered into a voluntary agreement with HUD addressing \npast non-compliance with their obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including the \nobligations to help search for accessible apartments under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 3 of 12\n100.204 (the “1994 Agreement”).  In 2006, HUD again reviewed HANH to assess its compliance \nwith Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In 2007, HUD issued a report, stating that HANH \nwas not in compliance with certain obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including \nthe obligations of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204. See Exhibit A, Section 504 Report \nby Carl Harris. As a result, HANH agreed to enter into another Voluntary Compliance \nAgreement (the “2007 Agreement”).   \n5.  On September 19, 2007, a federal court ordered HANH to provide a current list of accessible, \navailable apartments known to it, as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) to one Section 8 family.  \nSee Gaither v. Housing Authority of the City of New Haven, 2007 WL 3378533, D. Conn., \nNovember 2, 2007 (NO. 3:07-CV-667WWE).  \n6. As of April 9, 2008—a more than six months later—HANH has failed to create the current list \nof available, accessible apartments known to it, as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3), and \ntherefore still does not provide such list when issuing a Section 8 voucher to a family which \nincludes an individual with handicaps. \n7. Jimmy Miller currently serves as the Executive Director of HANH.  At the direction of Miller, \nHANH “does not do searches for apartments.” See Exhibit B, Admission #1 from Plaintiffs’ First \nRequest for Admissions from Jimmy Miller, dated July 18, 2007. \n8.  Each of the defendant members of the Commission personally knows that HANH was not in \nfull compliance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, yet each has voted in favor of \nmeasures that violate such regulations, and fraudulently voted to certify that HANH was in \ncompliance with its fair housing obligations.   \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 4 of 12\n9.  HANH has not been fully compliant with either 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 or 24 C.F.R. §100.204, at \nany time during the tenure of Miller.   Instead, HANH has demonstrated a continuous pattern of \nnon-compliance with its obligations under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, the Fair \nHousing Act Amendments and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Such pattern continues \nthrough the present. \nTHE NAMED PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR SEARCH ASSISTANCE \n10.  Taylor family currently resides in a three-bedroom apartment at 205 Dover Street, 1st floor in \nNew Haven. The family consists of Rebecca Taylor and her son and daughter. Although it is \nlocated on the first floor, the apartment is not wheelchair accessible, in that both the front and \nback entrances to the building must be reached by stairs. \n11.  Whenever she is alone in the home, Rebecca Taylor is endangered by the lack of any \nwheelchair-accessible way of exiting from her home.  \n12. Rebecca Taylor has searched via the newspaper for an accessible two or three-bedroom \napartment, without success.  \n13. In early 2008, the Bank of America instituted foreclosure proceedings on the apartment \nbuilding where the Taylor family resides.  \n14.  Soon thereafter, Section 8 staff person Denise Senior conducted a recertification of the \nTaylor household. \n15.  During that recertification, Ms. Senior and Ms. Taylor discussed the fact that the 205 Dover \nStreet apartment building was in foreclosure, and the strong likelihood that Ms. Taylor would \nhave to move out of the building very soon. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 5 of 12\n16.  Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Senior if HANH would help her search for an accessible apartment. \n17.  Ms. Senior responded by stating that searching for an apartment was Ms. Taylor’s \nresponsibility under the Section 8 program.  \n18.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, was a misrepresentation of the Section 8 \nprogram rules.  \n19.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, represents the policy, pattern and/or \npractice of HANH toward disabled persons on Section 8 who ask for HANH’s assistance in \nsearching for an apartment. \n20.  On or about March 14, 2008 Ms. Taylor reiterated her concerns in a written request for a \nreasonable accommodation, which was received by HANH that same day.  See Exhibit C, \nReasonable Accommodation Letter from R. Taylor.  HANH’s own Administrative Plan requires \nHANH to respond to such a request within thirty days. Over thirty days have passed and HANH \nhas not responded in any way. \n21. On April 3, 2008 the Superior Court for the district of New Haven granted a motion for \ndefault against the owner of the building, Ms. Taylor’s landlord, for failure to appear and defend \nthe foreclosure proceedings against 205 Dover Street.  See Exhibit D, Case Detail Docket for \nCV-08-5017975-S.  Upon information and belief, the Taylor family is likely to be ejected from \n205 Dover Street within the next sixty days. \nCLASS MEMBERS \n22. The proposed class definition is: “All current and future participants in the Section 8 Housing \nChoice Voucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or handicaps of themselves or \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 6 of 12\nsomeone in their household, need assistance in searching for suitable dwellings to lease under the \nprogram.” \n23.  The proposed class is appropriate for certification under Rule 23 (b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, because the Defendants have refused to act “on grounds generally applicable \nto the class,” and the plaintiffs seek primarily injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n24. The proposed class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” within the \nmeaning of Rule 23 (a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon information and belief, \nthe Defendants’ policy, pattern and/or practice of refusing to assist disabled Section 8 \nparticipants in their searches for accessible housing pursuant to their obligations under 24 C.F.R. \n§ 8.28 affects over three hundred current participants who hold Section 8 vouchers administered \nby HANH.  Upon information and belief, HANH issues at least one hundred additional vouchers \neach year, and at least a third of those vouchers are issued to households that include a disabled \nmember.  Thus the class, while fluid, nevertheless comprises least four hundred voucher-holders \nand participants at any given point. \n25.   The proposed class has been subjected to identical or similar treatment by the Defendants, \nsuch that  “there are questions of law or fact common to the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 \n(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n26.  The claims of named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor are “typical of the claims or defenses of the \nclass” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n27.  The named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor will “fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nclass” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 77    Filed 11/14/08   Page 7 of 12\n \n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and 42 U.S.C. §1983, jurisdiction is proper in \nthat plaintiff’s claims alleged herein arise under federal law. \n29.  Venue is proper in that the facts giving rise to the claims alleged herein occurred in New \nHaven, Connecticut, and all parties reside or have their business address in New Haven, \nConnecticut. \nPARTIES \n30.  Named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor is a member of a household that participates in the Section \n8 program, and has disabilities and handicaps, as those terms are defined in the Fair Housing Act \nAmendments and the Rehabilitation Act.  \n31.  Defendant Jimmy Miller currently serves as the Executive Director of HANH.  He is sued in \nhis individual and official capacities. \n32.  Defendants David Alvarado, Ilona Leffingwell, Louise Persall, Robert Solomon, and Jason \nTurner are Commissioners of the Housing Authority Commission of the City of New Haven, and \nas such are responsible for directing and supervising the actions of HANH.  They are each sued \nin their individual and official capacities.   \n33.

The Defendants’ have intentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs on account of their \ndisabilities, denying the plaintiffs the right to enjoy the benefits of participating in the Section 8 \nProgram by refusing to provide search assistance to the plaintiffs that they routinely provide to \nnon-disabled Section 8 households, including lists of available Section 8 apartments and mobility \ncounseling services, and by refusing to reasonably accommodate them.   \n36.  The Defendants have a policy, pattern and/or practice of discriminating against persons with \ndisabilities and/or handicaps, as described in this Complaint.      \n37. The acts described in this Count I have injured and continue to injure the plaintiffs by making \nhousing and services unavailable to them, or available only on different terms in violation of 42 \nU.S.C. §3604 et seq., and by denying them reasonable accommodation that were necessary to \nallow them to enjoy Section 8 housing. \n38.  The acts described in this Count I have injured and continue to injure the plaintiffs by \ncausing them to suffer frustration, anxiety, emotional distress, and despair. \n39.

The Defendants have been advised by HUD and others on numerous occasions from 1994 to \nthe present that such policies, pattern and/or practices were unlawful.   \n48.  The Defendants were further put on notice that their policies pattern and/or practices \nviolated subpart (a)(3) of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 by an Order issued by the Honorable Warren Eginton \non September 19, 2007, enjoining HANH from its refusal to supply such listing.  \n49.

The plaintiffs are likely to be irreparably harmed by the defendants’ continuing \nnoncompliance, as demonstrated by the defendants’ failure to assist the named plaintiff, Rebecca \nTaylor, exposing her family to imminent homelessness and loss of her Section 8 benefits. \n54.  The plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims. \n55.  The balance of hardships tips decidedly in the plaintiffs’ favor, inasmuch as the defendants \nare being asked to provide a purely administrative remedy, whereas Rebecca Taylor may lose her \nhome, and her continued eligibility for a housing subsidy. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays for relief from this Court, in the form of: \n1.

Introduction\nPlaintiffs Rebecca Taylor, Karl Hunter, and Heiwa Salovitz claim that the Housing\nAuthority of New Haven (“HANH”)1 discriminated against them and other disabled persons\nby failing to afford them certain accommodations to which they claim entitlement under the\nstatutes and regulations governing HANH’s implementation in New Haven of the Housing\nChoice Voucher Program (the “Section 8 Program” or “HCV Program”) of the United States\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).  They claim that HANH’s\ndiscrimination took place during a liability period of 2006 through April 22, 2008, the date\non which Taylor filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,2 and they raise four claims\nrelated to HANH’s actions during this period.\nAfter full trial on the merits, and for the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that\nPlaintiffs have not shown Defendants’ liability on any of the counts.  While Plaintiffs alleged\nthat Defendants programmatically applied a policy that either intentionally discriminated\nagainst  disabled  HCV  Program  participants  or  failed  to  afford  them  reasonable\naccommodations, the evidence shows no discriminatory policy or programmatic approach\nto disabled participants’ requests for reasonable accommodations.  Therefore, the Court\nmust decertify the class that it earlier certified.  Plaintiffs also seek to enforce certain HUD\n1 Plaintiffs also bring suit against HANH Executive Director Karen DuBois–Walton,\nformer  HANH Executive Director Jimmy Miller, and five  members of the Housing\nAuthority Commission for the City of New Haven (David Alvarado, Ilona Leffingwell,\nLouise Persall, Robert Solomon, and Jason Turner).\n2 See Tr. 7/29/09 (Pre-Trial Conf.) at 13.\n2\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 3 of 84\nregulations, but they have no private right of action to enforce them.  Finally, there is\ninsufficient evidence that Defendants discriminated against the three named Plaintiffs, or\nthat Defendants’ conduct toward them deprived them of meaningful access to the benefits\nof the Section 8 Program.\nII. Claims\nA. Plaintiffs’ Claims\nIn  Count  One,  Plaintiffs  allege  that  HANH  violated  the  Fair  Housing  Act\nAmendments, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), by failing to provide them “mobility counseling” to assist\nthem in searching for, finding, applying for, and moving into disabled-accessible housing,\nin some cases despite express requests for such assistance; failing to furnish them with a list\nof available accessible units (an “AAUL”), again in some cases despite express requests for\nsuch a list; and providing “grossly incompetent supervision of the staff responsible for\nresponding to such requests.”  (3d Am. Compl. [Doc. # 140] at ¶¶ 64–69.)\nIn Count Two, they allege that HANH violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n(“Section 504”), 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), by “den[ying] the plaintiffs’ requests for a reasonable\naccommodation through chaotic lack of adherence to their own procedures, repetitive and\nunnecessary  procedural  hurdles,  unconscionable  delays,  or  other  acts  of  gross\nincompetence,” despite the plaintiffs’ need for such accommodations “in order to have equal\naccess to the Section 8 [P]rogram.”  (Id. at ¶¶ 70–76.)  At summation, counsel for Plaintiffs\nstated that this claim “has sort of meta[morpho]sized during the course of this litigation,”\n3\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 4 of 84\nand clarified that the claim was a “Rehabilitation Act claim that there was not a reasonable\naccommodation made.”  (Tr. Vol. IX (9/9/09) at 34.)\nCount Three raises a claim, through 42 U.S.C. § 1983, that HANH has violated two\nrelevant HUD regulations, 24 C.F.R. §§  8.28(a) and 100.204, by instituting, condoning,\nknowing about, and failing to correct “policies, pattern and/or practices” that violate\nPlaintiffs’ right to certain specific reasonable accommodations.  (Id. at ¶¶ 77–83.)\nFinally, in Count Four, Plaintiffs claim that HANH has violated Section 504 and 42\nU.S.C. § 3604(d) and (f)(3) by failing to use “administrative fee[s],” which are provided by\nHUD under a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, to make its units accessible to persons\nwith disabilities; by “refusing under any and all circumstances to use” these funds “to help\npermanently or temporarily modify privately owned units to make them accessible for rental\nby the plaintiffs”; by “failing to assist the plaintiffs in applying for other sources of funding\nfor such modifications that are known to it”; and by “failing and/or refusing to include any\ninformation on applying for exception rents” or other sources of “additional amount of rent”\nfor this purpose.  (Id. at ¶¶ 84–92.)\nB. Class Certification\nPlaintiffs moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for class certification as\nto their first and third counts, and on March 10, 2009 the Court granted the certification\nmotion.    See  Taylor  v.  Hous.  Auth.  of New  Haven, 257 F.R.D.  23  (D.  Conn. 2009)\n[Doc. # 108].  Without “holding ‘a protracted mini-trial of substantial portions of the\n4\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 5 of 84\nunderlying litigation,’” the Court concluded that the requirements of Rule 23 were met.  It\nfirst held that the proposed class was ascertainable:\nPlaintiffs’ claims relate to Defendants’ alleged failure to provide two distinct\nitems: an [AAUL] and mobility counseling. . . . Defining the class as those\nwho were eligible for but did not receive either or both of these items\nprovides objective criteria whose applicability to a given household can be\ndetermined in an administratively feasible manner and thus sets forth a\nsufficiently ascertainable class.\nTaylor, 257 F.R.D. at 27, 29 (quoting In re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 41\n(2d Cir. 2006) (“In re IPO”)).  It next held that there was sufficient numerosity, because\nPlaintiffs alleged that no acceptable AAUL existed, so HANH could not have provided such\na list to any of the “approximately 691” “households including at least one disabled member\nto which HANH has issued a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher (‘Disabled Section\n8 Household’),” and also because “the putative class members are not financially incentivized\neither to join this suit or institute their own individual suits.”  Id. at 26, 29–30.  It rejected\nDefendants’ argument that there was no commonality or typicality of class members due to\nthe differences in disabilities, holding instead that “[w]hile the circumstances and nature of\neach plaintiff’s and class member’s disability may differ, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’\ndiscriminatory policy or practice applies to them regardless of these differences, and that\nDefendants’ application of that policy or practice to them is unlawful for reasons unrelated\nto each person’s individual disability.”  Id. at 30; see also id. at 31.  The Court certified the\nclass under Rule 23(b)(2) because Plaintiffs “allege[d] that [HANH’s] policy, pattern and/or\npractice is triggered by their status as Disabled Section 8 Households, regardless of their\nparticular disabilities, such that Defendants allegedly act on grounds generally applicable to\n5\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 6 of 84\nall named plaintiffs and putative class members.”  Id. at 32.  The Court certified the following\nclass:\nAll households including at least one handicapped person to which the\nHousing Authority of New Haven has issued a Housing Certificate or\nHousing Voucher, and:\n(a) that did not receive a list of available, accessible apartments, as\nrequired under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, and/or 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3); and/or\n(b) that did not receive Mobility Counseling services, or offer thereof, as\nrequired under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, and/or 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3).\nTaylor, 257 F.R.D. at 32–33.\nC. Private Right of Action to Enforce 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs do not have a private right of action to enforce the\nregulations found at 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a), which Plaintiffs invoke in their third count.  The\nCourt agrees.\nPart 8 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations contains a set of regulations\npromulgated under Section 504.  See HUD, Section 8 Certificate and Voucher Programs\nConforming Rule, 63 Fed. Reg. 23825, 23856 (Apr. 30, 1998) (Final Rule) (“Conforming\nRulemaking”) (Pl.’s Ex. 3).3  Plaintiffs invoke 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(2), (3), and (5), and seek\n3 Plaintiffs argue that when it issued the Conforming Rulemaking in 1998, HUD re-\nissued part 8 under both Section 504 and the United States Housing Act of 1937, as\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq., and therefore part 8 is a “hybrid regulation.”  This\nargument misreads the 1998 Rulemaking, which states that part 8 “implements [S]ection 504\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.”  Conforming Rule, 63 Fed. Reg. at 23856; see also id. at\n23849, 23851 (explaining that part 8 implements Section 504); id. at 23853 (noting that\n“[t]he citation authority for part 8 continues to” be Section 504 (emphasis added)); see also\nHUD, Nondiscrimination Based on Handicap in Federally Assisted Programs and Activities\nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 53 Fed. Reg. 20215, 20216 (June 2,\n6\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 7 of 84\nto enforce these subsections through 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Defendants argue that there is no\nprivate cause of action under § 1983 to enforce § 8.28(a).  For the reasons that follow, the\nCourt concludes that although the subsections of § 8.28(a) may provide guidance on whether\na proposed accommodation would be reasonable under Section 504 itself, Plaintiffs do not\nhave a private right of action to enforce § 8.28(a) through § 1983.4\n1988) (promulgating 24 C.F.R. pt. 8 and noting that “[t]he rule implements [S]ection 504 of\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.”); 24 C.F.R. § 8.1(a) (“The purpose of this part\nis to effectuate [S]ection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.”).  In fact, the Conforming\nRulemaking stated that in promulgating 24 C.F.R. § 982.517(e), HUD was “add[ing] a new\nprovision allowing the [housing authority] to establish a special higher utility allowance, on\na case-by-case basis, as a reasonable accommodation for a disabled person,” and explained\nthat the idea was to assist housing authorities to provide “a reasonable accommodation in\naccordance with 24 C.F.R. part 8 to make the program accessible to and usable by the family\nmember with a disability.”  63 Fed. Reg. at 23846.\nIt also bears noting that in its September 2006 investigative report of HANH, HUD\nitself described part 8 as “the general regulatory provisions of Section 504.”  (HUD\nInvestigation Report Review No. 01-06-R001-4, Jt. Ex. 3, at 9.)  Cf. Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S.\n452, 462 (1997) (giving deference to agency’s interpretation of its own regulation where it\n“is in no sense a ‘post hoc rationalizatio[n]’ advanced by an agency seeking to defend past\nagency  action  against  attack”  and  “[t]here  is  simply  no  reason  to  suspect  that  the\ninterpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair and considered judgment on the matter in\nquestion”).\n4 Plaintiffs argue that a difference exists between assertion of authority to enforce\n§ 8.28(a) through § 1983, and assertion of authority to enforce these regulations through\nSection 504’s implied right of action.  While Plaintiffs are correct that “the standards\ndiverge” in “the implied cause of action doctrine” and “under [a] § 1983 analysis,” the\ndifference is immaterial here, since the initial inquiry—beyond which this Court need not\ngo in this case—is the same: “Under both tests, [a court] must initially decide if the statutory\nlanguage ‘unambiguously confer[s] an enforceable right’ upon an identifiable class of\nbeneficiaries.”  Taylor v. Vermont Dep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d 768, 783 (2d Cir. 2002) (discussing\nGonzaga and Sandoval); see also Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 285 (2002) (“A court’s\nrole in discerning whether personal rights exist in the § 1983 context should . . . not differ\nfrom its role in discerning whether personal rights exist in the implied right of action\ncontext.”); accord Save Our Valley v.

In Sandoval, the Court further explained that\nwhen a statute has provided a general authorization for private enforcement\nof regulations, it may perhaps be correct that the intent displayed in each\nregulation can determine whether or not it is privately enforceable.

However, Plaintiffs do not (and could\nnot) argue that the Rehabilitation Act, which contains an implied right of action, “provide[s]\na general authorization for private enforcement of regulations,” Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291,\nso if Plaintiffs have any private right of action to enforce § 8.28(a), under Sandoval it cannot\nbe any broader than the private right of action conferred on them by Section 504 itself.  Thus\nthe question arises as to the scope of Section 504’s implied private right of action, a question\nunaddressed by the parties aside from Defendants’ reliance on one Third Circuit case that\ndoes not squarely address the question.\nAs 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2) makes clear,6 a private plaintiff’s right of action to enforce\nSection 504 is derived from, and thus “coextensive with[,] the remedies available in a private\ncause of action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.”  Gorman, 536 U.S.\nat 184–85 (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2)); see also Olmstead v.

It does not, however, speak in terms of specific components of a benefit,\nprogram, or activity, or access to any specific components.  See Loeffler, 582 F.3d at 276\n(Section 504 “does not ensure equal medical treatment, but does require equal access to and\nequal participation in a patient’s own treatment” (citing Choate, 469 U.S. at 301)); Harris v.\nMills, 572 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2009) (similar); cf. Choate, 469 U.S. at 299 (Section 504\nembodies “two powerful but countervailing considerations—the need to give effect to the\nstatutory objectives and the desire to keep § 504 within manageable bounds”).  Therefore,\nthe statute cannot be construed to unambiguously provide a private right of action to obtain\nany such specific or tangible components of the benefits of a program or activity.  Cf. Streck\nv. Bd. of Educ. of East Greenbush School Dist., 280 F.

Giuliani, 230 F.3d 543, 548 (2d Cir. 2000)).\nSince the regulation cannot provide a right that the statute does not, it follows a\nfortiori that no right to specific, distinct, tangible, or concrete things purportedly granted to\ndisabled persons by regulation can be said to fall within the scope of the private right\nprovided by the statute itself, and therefore no such regulation-based right may be enforced\nthrough § 1983.  See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291; see also Three Rivers, 382 F.3d at 429 (if “the\nregulations . . . construe non-personal rights or obligations that Section 504 creates . . .

Since 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) speaks to specific components of the Section 8 Program,\nit cannot be said to confer rights that come within the scope of the right conferred by Section\n504 itself.  In the language of Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 284, the prohibitions and obligations\nimposed by § 8.28(a) are not “covered by the cause of action to enforce” Section 504. \nTherefore, § 8.28(a)’s provisions are not enforceable under Section 504 or through § 1983.\nEven taken on its own, 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) does not speak with the clarity necessary\nto conclude that it unambiguously confers any enforceable rights on Plaintiffs.8  In Gonzaga\n8 Notwithstanding its having concluded that § 8.28(a) does not confer rights that fall\nwithin  the  right  conferred  by  Section  504,  the  Court  undertakes  an  analysis  of  the\nregulation’s language given the lack of clarity in the case-law regarding whether, and when,\na court must apply the Gonzaga analysis, which is applicable to statutes, to the text of a\n13\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 14 of 84\nthe Supreme Court “reject[ed] the notion that [its] cases permit anything short of an\nunambiguously conferred right to support a cause of action brought under § 1983.” \nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283.  The Second Circuit made clear in Vermont Department of\nEducation  that  under  Gonzaga  determination  of  whether  “language  ‘unambiguously\nconfer[s] an enforceable right’ upon an identifiable class of beneficiaries” must turn on “the\nspecific language” of the “provisions” on which the right of action is claimed to be based,\nVermont Dep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d at 784, and also emphasized that to be enforceable through\n§ 1983 the right purportedly found in “the specific language” must be “‘unambiguously\nconferred,’” id. at 785 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 283 (emphasis in Vermont Department\nof Education)).  If a provision “combines elements of both . . . language that . . . does not\nregulation.  It may be that no such analysis is appropriate, since in Sandoval the Court\nreiterated that “[l]ike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal\nlaw must be created by Congress,” 532 U.S. at 286, the Gonzaga analysis focuses on whether\nstatutory text contain “the sort of ‘rights-creating’ language critical to showing the requisite\ncongressional intent to create new rights,” 536 U.S. at 287 (quoting Sandoval, 532 U.S. at\n288–89), and the argument that “regulations [may] contain rights-creating language . . . skips\n[the] analytical step” of first determining whether “Congress through statutory text created”\na private right of action, Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291 (second emphasis added).\nOn the other hand, where Congress has, through statutory text, created a private\nright of action (in this case, an implied one), Sandoval can be read to suggest that an\nexamination of the regulation’s text might be appropriate to determine the scope of the\npurported regulation-created right so as to compare it with the statutory right, at least in\ncircumstances where the right purportedly conferred by a regulation is less far afield from\nthe statute than the relationship the Court confronted in Sandoval between the disparate-\ntreatment statute, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1, and the disparate-impact regulation, 28 C.F.R.\n§ 42.104(b)(2).  See Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 291; see also Three Rivers, 382 F.3d at 424\n(reaffirming precedent “extend[ing] Sandoval’s reasoning to the Section 1983 context” in\nlight of Gonzaga, and explaining that “a regulation cannot create a right enforceable through\nsection 1983 where the alleged right does not appear explicitly in the statute, but only\nappears in the regulation.  A plaintiff can only enforce a regulation under Section 1983 if the\nregulation merely defines the specific right that Congress already has conferred through the\nstatute” (internal quotations, citations, and alterations omitted)).\n14\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 15 of 84\nconfer an individual right” and “individually focused language that evidences an intent to\ncreate a right,” no right enforceable through § 1983 has been “unambiguously conferred,”\nand therefore no § 1983 action lies.  See id. at 785.\nTurning to the regulations at issue, Plaintiffs seek to enforce three subsections of\n§ 8.28(a), which provide:\n[A] recipient administering a Section 8 Existing Housing Certificate program\nor a housing voucher program shall: . . .\n(2) In  its  activities  to  encourage  participation  by  owners,  include\nencouragement of participation by owners having accessible units; \n(3) When issuing a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher to a family\nwhich includes an individual with handicaps include a current listing\nof available accessible units known to the PHA and, if necessary,\notherwise assist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling\nunit; . . . and\n(5) If necessary as a reasonable accommodation for a person with\ndisabilities, approve a family request for an exception rent under\n§ 982.504(b)(2) for a regular tenancy under the Section 8 certificate\nprogram so that the program is readily accessible to and usable by\npersons with disabilities.\n24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a).\nWhile HUD’s use of the word “shall” in § 8.28(a), which is directed at public housing\nauthorities (“PHAs”), is “mandatory”—rather than “precatory” or “hortatory,” see Pennhurst,\n451 U.S. at 24 (where statutory provision is “hortatory, not mandatory,” no private right can\nbe implied); Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340–41 (“the provision giving rise to the asserted right must\nbe couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms”)—examination of each subsection\nof § 8.28(a) reveals that at least two of the subsections are not enforceable through § 1983,\nand that, a fortiori, taken as a whole, § 8.28(a) cannot be read to “unambiguously confer[]”\nsuch a right.  See Vermont Dep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d at 785.\n15\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 16 of 84\nFirst,  subsection  (2)  of  §  8.28(a)  does  not  speak  in  terms  of  individuals’  or\nbeneficiaries’ rights.  Instead, it addresses PHAs’ obligation to encourage participation of\nowners who can offer units that are accessible to disabled persons.  Even assuming,\narguendo, that PHAs’ compliance with § 8.28(a)(2) would necessarily increase the availability\nof accessible housing in the private market, and, further, would thereby strengthen the ability\nof people with disabilities to find opportunities to use the benefit provided by PHAs, the\nsubsection’s language is directed at the relationship between PHAs and unit owners, and\ntherefore does not evidence any intent to benefit Plaintiffs.  In addition, any individual’s\nright under this subsection would be vague and amorphous because the regulation is devoid\nof an “objective benchmark,” see Wilder v. Virginia Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 519–20 (1990),\nby which the judiciary could measure PHAs’ efforts and determine whether particular\nactions by the PHA are sufficiently “encourag[ing]” to satisfy the regulation.  Thus,\nsubsection (2) cannot be read to create any private right, let alone one that is within the\nscope of the right enforceable under Section 504 itself.\nSubsection (5) speaks in terms of necessity without providing any benchmarks for\nwhen the “reasonable accommodation” of an exception rent would be necessary.  Because\nthe Supreme Court has implied a private right of action in Title VI, and because the\nRehabilitation Act expressly invokes this implied right of action, the vagueness of the phrase\n“reasonable accommodation” cannot be understood to make the statute unenforceable. \nHowever, subsection (5), standing on its own without the Rehabilitation Act’s express\ninvocation of another law’s private right of action analogous to 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2), is too\nvague and amorphous for the Court to conclude that this regulation includes an implied\nprivate right of action.  See, e.g., Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. 347, 363 (1992) (concluding that\n16\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 17 of 84\na statute requiring a State to make “reasonable efforts” “does not unambiguously confer an\nenforceable right upon the Act’s beneficiaries” because the language “is at least as plausibly\nread to impose only a rather generalized duty on the State, to be enforced not by private\nindividuals, but by the Secretary” pursuant to an administrative-enforcement scheme);\nGonzaga, 536 U.S. at 281–83 (summarizing holdings in Suter and Blessing that rejected\nefforts to read implied private rights of action into statutes, and forcefully rejecting argument\nthat the Court’s cases “establish a relatively loose standard for finding rights enforceable by\n§ 1983”); cf. id. at 295 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining that majority was rejecting a\nproposed right that “is more specific and clear than rights previously found enforceable\nunder § 1983 in [Wright] and [Wilder], both of which involved plaintiffs’ entitlement to\n‘reasonable’ amounts of money”).9\nIn addition, the first part of Subsection (3) contains language that could be read to\ngive rise to a private right, but that right—to an accessible unit list, which is a particular\ndocument containing particular information, upon receipt of a housing voucher—is too\nspecific and is directed at a particular object (i.e., a document listing certain apartments),\nand therefore falls outside the scope of the general right to meaningful access provided by\nSection 504.  Assuming, arguendo, that this language creates a private right, it is a right to\na concrete and tangible object—an AAUL.  But Section 504 does not create rights to any\nspecific components of any program or activity and cannot be construed to unambiguously\nprovide a private right of action to obtain any such specific or tangible components.  See, e.g.,\nStreck, 280 F. App’x at 68 (“a demand for ‘additional or different substantive benefits’ is not”\n9  It  is  also  worth  noting  that  Subsection  (5)  references  another  regulation,\n§ 982.504(b)(2), that does not exist.\n17\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 18 of 84\ncognizable under Section 504).  Therefore, the private right to an accessible unit list, which\narguendo arises under § 8.28(a)(3), is a right that extends beyond the enforceable right\nunambiguously conferred by the statutory language, and thus cannot be privately enforced. \nSee Vermont Dep’t of Educ., 313 F.3d at 783.\nEven if § 8.28(a)(3) and (5) could be construed to contain “individually focused\nlanguage that evidences an intent to create an enforceable right,” those provisions are\nsurrounded by language that “does not confer an individual right,” so, like the court in\nVermont Department of Education, 313 F.3d at 785, this Court “cannot say that [§ 8.28(a)]\ncreates . . . ‘unambiguously conferred right[s].”  Bolstering the Court’s conclusion that\n§ 8.28(a)(2), (3) and (5) are not enforceable directly through § 1983 is HUD’s description of\nthe purpose of 24 C.F.R. part 8 and the fact that its regulations provide an administrative-\nenforcement scheme.  HUD explains that\nThe policies and standards for compliance established by this part are\nestablished in contemplation of, and with a view to enforcement through, the\nDepartment’s administration of programs or activities receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance and the administrative procedures described in Subparts\nD  and  E  (including,  without  limitation,  judicial  enforcement  under\n§ 8.57(a)).\n24  C.F.R.  §  8.1(b).    In  turn,  the  compliance  provisions  in  Subpart  D  of  part  8\n(“Enforcement”)  specify  the  contemplated  enforcement  scheme,  which  is  primarily\nadministrative.    First,  the  regulation  entitled  “Compliance  information”  specifies,  in\npertinent part: “Cooperation and assistance. The responsible civil rights official and the\naward official shall, to the fullest extent practicable, seek the cooperation of recipients in\nobtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients\n18\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 19 of 84\nto help them comply voluntarily with this part.”  Id. § 8.55(a).10  Second, the regulation\nentitled “Procedure for effectuating compliance” provides:\n(a) General. If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply\nwith this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance\ncannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may\nbe effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to\ncontinue Federal financial assistance, or by other means authorized by\nlaw. Such other means may include, but are not limited to:\n(1) A referral to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that\nappropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the\nUnited States under any law of the United States, or any assurance or\nother contractual undertaking;\n(2) The initiation of debarment proceedings pursuant to 2 [C.F.R.] part\n2424; and\n(3) Any applicable proceeding under State or local law.\nId. § 8.57(a).  The regulations thus clearly contemplate an enforcement scheme in which a\npublic housing authority’s compliance with the regulations is to be enforced administratively\nby HUD, first, through “informal means,” and second, by discontinuing, or threatening to\ndiscontinue, federal funding.  Where these administrative mechanisms do not achieve\ncompliance, the regulations contemplate both judicial and administrative proceedings,11 but\nthe only entity which the regulation contemplates will bring an action under federal law is\nthe Department of Justice, which is the only entity described in the regulations as having any\n10 Other regulations make clear that the “responsible civil rights official” designates\na set of HUD employees in Washington, DC who oversee PHAs and administrative\ncomplaints brought against them.  See 24 C.F.R. § 8.56 (“Conduct of investigations”).\n11 2 C.F.R. part 2424 concerns “Nonprocurement Debarment and Suspension” and\nprescribes the procedures to be followed when HUD seeks to stop funding a project.  See 2\nC.F.R. § 2424.220 (“this part applies to any contract . . . if the contract is to be funded or\nprovided by HUD under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the\ncontract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000”).\n19\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 20 of 84\n“rights.”  To the extent  that §  8.57(a)  could be construed as contemplating private\nenforcement by court action, such enforcement would be accomplished through “State or\nlocal law”—but not federal law or the regulations themselves.\nWhile  this  administrative-enforcement  scheme  does  not  clearly  foreclose  the\npossibility that some of the regulations in 24 C.F.R. part 8 may be enforceable through\n§ 1983, it further counsels in favor of the Court’s conclusion that § 8.28(a)(2), (3), and (5)\nare not so enforceable.  Indeed, even if an administrative-enforcement scheme is not so\ncomprehensive as to “preclude a finding of . . . intent to create a private right of action,” it\nmay “tend to contradict a[n] . . . intent to create privately enforceable rights.”  Sandoval, 532\nU.S. at 290–91 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the availability of “administrative procedures” to\nenforce regulations “further counsel[s] against [a court’s] finding a congressional intent to\ncreate individually enforceable private rights.”  Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289–90.\nFor all these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs may not enforce any part of\n24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) through 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Nonetheless, Defendants do not challenge the\nvalidity of § 8.28(a), and regulations may be valid even if they do not create provide rights\nenforceable through § 1983.  See Three Rivers, 382 F.3d at 429 n.18 (“Nothing here is meant\nto cast doubt on the validity of the HUD regulations themselves. But the validity of the\nregulations is a different question than whether they are privately enforceable.”).  Consistent\nwith the parties’ positions, the Court will assume that § 8.28(a) is valid and applicable to\nHANH, see Taylor, 257 F.R.D. at 26 n.2 (“Defendants admit that as the administrator of the\nSection 8 Program for this area, HANH is subject to the regulations under which Plaintiffs\n20\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 21 of 84\nbring this suit.”),12 and therefore will construe them probatively, as providing interpretive\nmeaning as to whether particular kinds of accommodations by a PHA such as HANH are\nreasonable.  See, e.g., Telesca v. Long Island Hous. Partnership, Inc., 443 F. Supp. 2d 397, 410\n(E.D.N.Y. 2006) (“The Court notes that any of the HUD regulations implementing the\nRehabilitation Act may be relevant in determining whether the defendants are liable under\nSection 504, and what remedies are available to address such violation.”); see also Henrietta\nD. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 280 (2d Cir. 2003) (“We do not intimate that either the mere\nfact that [a city ordinance] was enacted or the fact that it was viewed as ‘access’ legislation\nper se makes it a reasonable accommodation under the relevant federal statutes.  We find it\nto be a prima facie reasonable accommodation because we agree with the District Court that\nits provisions are consistent with its goal of serving as a reasonable accommodation, and it\ndoes not appear to impose costs that obviously outweigh its benefits.”).\nNow that the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs cannot enforce § 8.28(a), and\nbecause they bring another claim under Section 504 itself—under which HUD promulgated\n§ 8.28(a)—Plaintiffs’ third count is coterminous with the second count, which invokes\nSection 504 itself.\nIII. Legal Principles\nA. The Statutes\nThe Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-430, § 6(b), 102 Stat. 1619,\n1622, amended the Fair Housing Act to prohibit discrimination on the basis of “handicap”\n12 See also HANH Reply to HUD Section 504 Investigative Report, Jt. Ex. 4, at 2 (“In\naccordance with 24 CFR 8.28, HANH is obligated to provide specific assistance to Section\n8 families that include persons with disabilities.”).\n21\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 22 of 84\nor disability13 in advertising for or showing a “dwelling” for sale or lease.  See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(c)–(e).  Section 6(a) of the 1988 act amended the Fair Housing Act to prohibit\ndiscrimination on the basis of a “handicap” of a buyer/renter or anyone associated with or\nplanning to live in the “dwelling,” in offering for sale or lease, or in crafting and construing\nthe terms of sale or lease, of any “dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in\nconnection with such dwelling.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).\nPlaintiffs bring suit under § 3604(d) (the “FHA”) and § 3604(f)(3) (the “FHAA”). \nIn relevant part, § 3604(d) provides: “[I]t shall be unlawful . . . [t]o represent to any person\nbecause of . . . handicap . . . that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental\nwhen such dwelling is in fact so available.”  § 3604(f), a longer provision, states in relevant\npart:\n[I]t shall be unlawful . . .\n(f) (1) To discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make\nunavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap\nof— [“that buyer or renter,” anyone “associated with that person,” or anyone\nwho is or will be the tenant or the subject dwelling; and]\n(2) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or \nfacilities in connection with such dwelling, because of a handicap of— [“that\nperson,” anyone “associated with that person,” or anyone who is or will be\nthe tenant or the subject dwelling].\n(3) For purposes of this subsection, discrimination includes—\n13 The term “handicap” as used in the FHA has the same legal meaning as the now\nmore generally accepted term “disability.”  Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 631 (1998); see\nalso Taylor, 257 F.R.D. at 26 n.4.  The Court will use the latter except when quoting the\nstatute.\n22\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 23 of 84\n(A) a refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped\nperson, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be\noccupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford\nsuch person full enjoyment of the premises . . .\n(B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules,\npolicies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary\nto afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or\n(C) in connection with the design and construction of covered\nmultifamily dwellings for first occupancy after [March 13, 1991 that does not\nprovide accessibility for disabled persons].\n42 U.S.C. § 3604(f).\nPlaintiffs also bring suit under Section 504, which, as described above, provides that\n“[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by\nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or\nby the United States Postal Service.”  29 U.S.C. § 794(a).\nB. Applicability of the FHA and FHAA to Plaintiffs’ Claims\nIt is not entirely clear whether the FHA and FHAA apply to HANH’s administration\nof the Section 8 Program.  Section 8 participants are tenants in privately-owned dwellings\nrather  than  dwellings  owned  by  the  federal  government,  state  government,  local\nmunicipality, or HANH, so HANH is not acting in the capacity of a “landlord,” “owner,” or\n“seller” when it administers the program.  It appears that no court has addressed the\nquestion of whether the Fair Housing Act or its Amendments apply to the conduct of a\npublic housing authority acting not as a dwelling owner (i.e., in the context of low income\npublic housing), but instead as a provider of funds for use in renting privately-owned\n23\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 24 of 84\ndwellings (i.e., in the context of administering a Section 8 Program).  Some courts have\naddressed the merits of such claims, but in contexts where the issue of the statutes’\napplicability has not been raised.  See, e.g., Sierotowicz v. New York City Hous. Auth., 214 F.\nApp’x 101, 102–03 (2d. Cir. 2007) (reversing, on other grounds, dismissal of Section 8\nparticipants’ suit under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f) against housing authority); Burgess v. Alameda\nHous. Auth., 98 F. App’x 603, 605–06 (9th Cir. 2004) (same).\nNevertheless, Court will assume the applicability of the FHA and the FHAA for two\nreasons.  First, no party has disputed the statutes’ applicability.  Second, the Act states an\nextremely broad governmental policy—“to provide, within constitutional limitations, for fair\nhousing throughout the United States,” 42 U.S.C. § 3601—that would be furthered by\npreventing public housing authorities administering Section 8 voucher programs from\ndiscriminating on the basis of disability.  Indeed, “[t]he Supreme Court has repeatedly\ndirected the courts to give a ‘generous construction’ to the Fair Housing Act.”  Hack v.\nPresident and Fellows of Yale Coll., 237 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir. 2000) (opinion of Moran, J.)\n(quoting, inter alia, Trafficante v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211–12 (1972)),\nabrogated on other grounds by Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506 (2002); see also\nThompson v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. and Urban Dev., 348 F. Supp. 2d 398, 415–16 (D. Md. 2005)\n(“At least with respect to government defendants, the case law indicates that there can be a\nconstructive illegal ‘denial’ of housing—i.e., a government entity may violate § 3604(a) by\ndenying a plaintiff a housing opportunity (as opposed to an actual brick-and-mortar\ndwelling). . . . Indeed, in an era where housing authorities are transitioning from the\nprovision of ‘hard units’ to the administration of more intangible housing programs\ninvolving vouchers etc., a broad reading of § 3604(a) is appropriate to continue to hold\n24\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 25 of 84\ngovernment entities accountable under the subsection.”).  And courts, including the Second\nCircuit, have applied the Act to towns and zoning boards that similarly do not act in the\ncapacity of owners, landlords, or sellers.  See Tsombanidis v. West Haven Fire Dep’t, 352 F.3d\n565, 573 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting, in the context of a challenge to a municipal zoning decision,\nthat “the FHAA . . . prohibit[s] governmental entities from implementing or enforcing\nhousing policies in a discriminatory manner against persons with disabilities”); see also, e.g.,\nReg’l Econ. Cmty. v. City of Middletown, 294 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2002); Lapid–Laurel, L.L.C. v.\nZoning Bd. of Adjustment, 284 F.3d 442 (3d Cir. 2002).\nThe Court remains cognizant that there is authority suggesting that § 3604 applies\nonly to landlords, owners, and others who offer dwellings for rent or sale, and therefore that\nthe statute would be inapplicable to a PHA administering a Section 8 voucher program, since\nin that capacity the PHA does not own or otherwise offer a dwelling for rent or sale to a\nSection 8 participant.  See Growth Horizons, Inc. v. Delaware County, Pa., 983 F.2d 1277,\n1283 (3d Cir. 1993) (“As its text and legislative history evidence, the purpose of [§ 3604(f)]\nis to protect the housing choices of handicapped individuals who seek to buy or lease\nhousing and of those who seek to buy or lease housing on their behalf.  The conduct and\ndecision-making that Congress sought to affect was that of persons in a position to frustrate\nsuch  choices—primarily,  at  least,  those  who  own  the  property  of  choice  and  their\nrepresentatives.” (emphasis added)); see also Hack, 237 F.3d at 88 (opinion of Pooler, J.)\n(rejecting claim of religious discrimination under the FHA because “the FHA does not\nrequire a landlord or seller to provide a reasonable accommodation with respect to an\nindividual applicant’s religion” (emphasis added)).\n25\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 26 of 84\nC. Claims under the FHA\n“The framework of burdens fashioned in Title VII cases is fully applicable to [FHA]\nhousing discrimination cases.”  Cabrera v. Jakabovitz, 24 F.3d 372, 383 (2d Cir. 1994); see\nalso id. 381–82 (describing “the three-step formulation of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n411 U.S. 792 (1973), and Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981)”\nin the context of fashioning jury instructions).  To establish a prima facie case under this\nfamiliar framework, a plaintiff must show that “(1) the plaintiff is a member of the class\nprotected by the statute, (2) the plaintiff sought and was qualified for an apartment . . .,\n(3) the plaintiff was denied the opportunity to rent the apartment . . ., and (4) the apartment\n. . . remained available thereafter.”  Id. at 381 (references to discrimination in employment\nomitted).  After a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant\n“to produc[e] evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.  This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it\ncan involve no credibility assessment.”  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S.\n133, 142 (2000) (internal quotations omitted).  At the third stage of the McDonnell Douglas\ntest, “the sole remaining issue [is] ‘discrimination vel non,’” Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell, 243\nF.3d 93, 101–02 (2d Cir. 2001) (citations omitted), and “the governing standard is simply\nwhether the evidence, taken as a whole, is sufficient to support a reasonable inference that\nprohibited [retaliation] occurred,” James v. New York Racing Ass’n, 233 F.3d 149, 156 (2d\nCir. 2000); see also Reeves, 530 U.S. at 150.\nD. Claims under the FHAA and Section 504\n“To establish discrimination under . . . the FHAA . . . plaintiffs have three available\ntheories: (1) intentional discrimination (disparate treatment); (2) disparate impact; and\n26\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 27 of 84\n(3) failure to make a reasonable accommodation.”  Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 573.  Plaintiffs\nassert the first and third theories.  The third theory, and the case-law governing it, also\napplies to Section 504.\n1. Intentional Discrimination\nUnder the intentional discrimination theory applicable to the FHAA, Plaintiffs must\nfirst show that their status as disabled persons was “a motivating factor behind the”\nDefendants’ actions.  Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 579.  “Factors to be considered in evaluating\na  claim  of  intentional  discrimination  include:  (1)  the  discriminatory  impact  of  the\ngovernmental decision; (2) the decision’s historical background; (3) the specific sequence\nof events leading up to the challenged decision; (4) departures from the normal procedural\nsequences; and (5) departures from normal substantive criteria.”  Id. at 580.  Thereafter, the\ncourt analyzes a claim under this theory pursuant to the McDonnell Douglas test described\nabove.  Reg’l Econ. Cmty., 294 F.3d at 48–49.\n2. Reasonable Accommodation\nThe reasonable accommodation theory of liability applies to both the FHAA and\nSection  504.14    Even  before  a  plaintiff  can  bring  suit  for  denial  of  a  reasonable\naccommodation,  she  must  request  the  accommodation  she  seeks  directly  from  the\ngovernmental entity she sues:\nTo prevail on a reasonable accommodation claim, plaintiffs must first\nprovide the governmental entity an opportunity to accommodate them\nthrough the entity’s established procedures used to adjust the neutral policy\nin question[, because] [a] governmental entity must know what a plaintiff\nseeks prior to incurring liability for failing to affirmatively grant a reasonable\naccommodation.  It may be that once the governmental entity denies such an\n14 See infra note 14.\n27\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 28 of 84\naccommodation, neither the FHAA nor [Section 504] require a plaintiff to\nexhaust the state or local administrative procedures.  But a plaintiff must first\nuse the procedures available to notify the governmental entity that it seeks\nan exception or variance from the facially neutral laws when pursuing a\nreasonable accommodation claim.\nTsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 579 (internal quotations omitted).15  A plaintiff must then make\nout a prima facie claim:\nTo make out a claim of discrimination based on failure to reasonably\naccommodate, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he suffers from a\nhandicap . . .; (2) defendants knew or reasonably should have known of the\nplaintiff’s handicap; (3) accommodation of the handicap ‘may be necessary’\nto afford plaintiff an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling; and\n(4) defendants refused to make such accommodation.”\nBentley v. Peace and Quiet Realty 2 LLC, 367 F. Supp. 2d 341, 344 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (citations\nomitted).\nA person is “otherwise qualified” for purposes of Section 504 if she “is able to meet\nall of the programs’ requirements in spite of [her] handicap.”  Doe v. Pfrommer, 148 F.3d 73,\n82 (2d Cir. 1998) (citing Davis, 442 U.S. at 406).  As the Supreme Court has construed it,\nSection 504 “requires that an otherwise qualified handicapped individual must be provided\nwith meaningful access to the benefit that the grantee offers,” and the “benefit” must not “be\n15 Tsombanidis addressed § 3604(f) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”),\n42 U.S.C. § 12131(2).  However, its holding is fully applicable to Section 504 as well.  Indeed,\nTsombanidis relies on Shapiro v. Cadman Towers, Inc., 51 F.3d 328 (2d Cir. 1995), which\nheld  that  “in  enacting  [§  3604(f)],  Congress  relied  on  the  standard  of  reasonable\naccommodation developed under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified at\n29 U.S.C. § 794,” observed that “[t]he legislative history of section 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f) plainly\nindicates that its drafters intended to draw on case law developed under section 504,” and\napplied Section 504 case-law to interpret § 3604(f).  Shapiro, 51 F.3d at 333–35; see\nTsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 578 (citing Shapiro, 51 F.3d at 333–35).  Therefore, the discussion\nin Tsombanidis regarding reasonable accommodations applies to Plaintiffs’ claims under\n§ 3604(f) and Section 504.\n28\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 29 of 84\ndefined in a way that effectively denies otherwise qualified handicapped individuals the\nmeaningful access to which they are entitled.”  Choate, 469 U.S. at 301.  “[T]o assure\nmeaningful access, reasonable accommodations in the grantee’s program or benefit may\nhave to be made,” id., but courts should be mindful that the statute prohibits “illegal\ndiscrimination against the disabled,” but not “the substance of the services provided to”\nthem, Doe, 148 F.3d at 84.\n“On the issue of reasonable accommodation, the plaintiff bears only the burden of\nidentifying an accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed its\nbenefits.”  Borkowski v. Valley Cent. School Dist., 63 F.3d 131, 139 (2d Cir. 1995) (discussing\n“reasonable accommodation” in the context of a Section 504 claim for employment\ndiscrimination); accord Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 280 (applying Borkowski burdens to claim\nunder Section 504 by disabled persons for reasonable accommodations in provision of city-\nadministered benefits programs).  Indeed, “[i]t is enough for the plaintiff to suggest the\nexistence of a plausible accommodation, the costs of which, facially, do not clearly exceed\nits benefits.  Once the plaintiff has done this, she has made out a prima facie showing that\na reasonable accommodation is available.”  Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 138.  The Second Circuit\nhas held that the FHAA and Section 504\nrequire  that changes  be  made  to such traditional rules or practices if\nnecessary to permit a person with handicaps an equal opportunity to use and\nenjoy a dwelling.  Plaintiffs must show that, but for the accommodation, they\nlikely will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing of their\nchoice.      A  defendant  must  incur  reasonable  costs  and  take  modest,\naffirmative  steps  to  accommodate  the  handicapped  as  long  as  the\naccommodations sought do not pose an undue hardship or a substantial\nburden.\nTsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 579 (internal quotations omitted).\n29\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 30 of 84\nAfter  a  plaintiff  “has  made  out  a  prima  facie  showing  that  a  reasonable\naccommodation is available, . . . the risk of nonpersuasion falls on the defendant.” \nBorkowski, 63 F.3d at 138.  A defendant need not, “in attempting to meet [its] burden of\npersuasion on the reasonableness of the proposed accommodation and in making out an\naffirmative defense of undue hardship, . . . analyze the costs and benefits of proposed\naccommodations with mathematical precision. . . . [A] common-sense balancing of the costs\nand benefits in light of the factors listed in the regulations is all that is expected.”  Id. at 140.\nAs this standard suggests, “[w]hether a requested accommodation is required . . . is\nhighly fact-specific, requiring case-by-case determination.  Ordinarily, the duty to make\nreasonable accommodations is framed by the nature of the particular handicap.”  Bentley,\n367 F. Supp. 2d at 344 (internal quotations omitted).  This is because “‘[r]easonable is a\nrelational term: it evaluates the desirability of a particular accommodation according to the\nconsequences that the accommodation will produce.  This requires an inquiry not only into\nthe benefits of the accommodation but into its costs as well. . . .  In short, an accommodation\nis reasonable only if its costs are not clearly disproportionate to the benefits that it will\nproduce.”  Borkowski, 63 F.3d at 138.\nIV. The Benefit Provided by the Section 8 Program\nA. Principles\nThe Rehabilitation Act prohibits the exclusion of disabled people from “the benefits\nof . . . any program or activity,” 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), states that “the term ‘program or activity’\nmeans all of the operations of” HANH, id. § 794(b)(1)(B), and leaves the task of defining the\nrelevant “benefit” to the courts, see Choate, 469 U.S. at 301.  Thus, in order to consider\n30\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 31 of 84\nPlaintiffs’ Section 504 claim, the Court must first define the “benefit that [HANH] offers”\nthrough the Section 8 Program.\nThe critical issue in defining a “benefit” when considering a Section 504 claim is the\nlevel of abstraction at which to answer the question.  In Choate disabled Medicaid recipients\nin Tennessee claimed that that state violated Section 504 when it reduced from 20 to 14 the\nnumber of inpatient treatment days covered by its Medicaid program because disabled\nMedicaid recipients needed longer inpatient care than non-disabled recipients, and therefore\nthe reduction had a disparate impact.  469 U.S. at 289–91.  The Supreme Court rejected this\nclaim, holding that \nThe  new  limitation  does  not  invoke  criteria  that  have  a  particular\nexclusionary effect on the handicapped; the reduction, neutral on its face,\ndoes not distinguish between those whose coverage will be reduced and those\nwhose coverage will not on the basis of any test, judgment, or trait that the\nhandicapped as a class are less capable of meeting or less likely of having. . . .\nTo the extent respondents . . . suggest that their greater need for prolonged\ninpatient care means that, to provide meaningful access to Medicaid services,\nTennessee must single out the handicapped for more than 14 days of\ncoverage, the suggestion is simply unsound.  At base, such a suggestion must\nrest on the notion that the benefit provided through state Medicaid programs\nis  the  amorphous  objective  of  “adequate  health  care.”    But  Medicaid\nprograms do not guarantee that each recipient will receive that level of health\ncare precisely tailored to his or her particular needs.  Instead, the benefit\nprovided through Medicaid is a particular package of health care services,\nsuch as 14 days of inpatient coverage.  That package of services has the\ngeneral aim of assuring that individuals will receive necessary medical care,\nbut  the  benefit  provided  remains  the  individual  services  offered—not\n“adequate health care.”\nId. at 302–03.  The Supreme Court went on to explain that the Medicaid Act “makes . . .\nclear” that the benefit Medicaid provides is “a particular package of health care services”\nrather than “the amorphous objective of ‘adequate health care.’”  See id. at 303.  The Court\n31\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 32 of 84\nfurther held that defining a benefit with specificity also accorded with the purpose of the\nRehabilitation Act, since “Section 504 does not require the State to alter this definition of the\nbenefit being offered simply to meet the reality that the handicapped have greater medical\nneeds” and “does not . . . guarantee the handicapped equal results from the provision of state\nMedicaid, even assuming some measure of equality of health could be constructed.”  Id. at\n303–04.\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s lead in Choate, the Second Circuit has declined to\ndefine benefits abstractly or broadly.  Instead, a benefit should be defined as specifically as\npossible, keeping in mind that Section 504 prohibits discrimination but does not mandate\nthe provision of new benefits.  Specifically, the Second Circuit has warned against construing\na “benefit” in a Section 504 case at an “incorrect level of generality.”  See Rodriguez v. City\nof New York, 197 F.3d 611, 617 (2d Cir. 1999).  In Rodriguez, mentally disabled Medicaid\nrecipients charged the City of New York with discriminating on the basis of mental disability\nby “fail[ing] to include safety monitoring” as part of a constellation of “personal-care\nservices” provided by the City pursuant to New York’s Medicaid plan.  Id. at 613–14.  They\nargued “that, because safety monitoring is ‘comparable’ to the personal care services already\nprovided by New York” to physically disabled people, the City violated both the Medicaid\nlaw and Section 50416 by failing to provide the mentally disabled with safety monitoring, a\nservice they need and that is “comparable” to a service the City does provide.  Id. at 614–16. \n16 The Rodriguez plaintiffs brought claims under both Section 504 and the ADA. \nRodriguez, 197 F.3d at 613.  The court held that “[b]ecause Section 504 . . . and the ADA\nimpose identical requirements,” it would “consider these claims in tandem.”  Id. at 618.  For\nsimplicity and relevance, this Court refers to the claims under Section 504 and the ADA in\nRodriguez as simply a claim under Section 504.\n32\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 33 of 84\nThe court first rejected the argument that the non-provision of safety monitoring violated\nthe Medicaid laws, holding that “[a] clear and legitimate distinction exists . . . between\nproviding safety monitoring as an incidental benefit when the [personal-]care-giver is\nassisting with another task,” on the one hand, and “providing [safety monitoring] as an\nindependent task, when the caregiver is present only to monitor the patient’s safety.”  Id. at\n616 (emphases added).  The court then rejected the Section 504 claim.  It rejected the\nplaintiffs’ argument that “the purpose of the personal care services is to enable recipients to\nreside in their homes,” and that they were denied meaningful access to that benefit because\nthey need safety monitoring to remain in their homes, id. at 617, holding that that argument\n“fail[ed] to focus on the particular services provided by” the City and framed in too\namorphous and broad a fashion the “benefit” at issue, id. at 618.  The court concluded:\n[Section 504] requires only that a particular service provided to some not be\ndenied to disabled people. . . . [T]he services that New York provides to the\nmentally disabled are no different from those provided to the physically\ndisabled.  Neither group is provided with independently tasked safety\nmonitoring.    Hence,  what  appellees  are  challenging  “is  not  illegal\ndiscrimination  against  the  disabled,  but  the  substance  of  the  services\nprovided.”  Thus, New York cannot have unlawfully discriminated against\nappellees by denying a benefit that it provides to no one.\nId. at 618 (quoting Doe, 148 F.3d at 83, 84).\nMore generally, the Second Circuit has explained that “the central purpose of\n[Section 504] is to assure that disabled individuals receive ‘evenhanded treatment’ in relation\nto the able-bodied,” and has suggested that in light of its specific prohibition—it “mandate[s]\nonly that the services provided . . . to non-handicapped individuals not be denied to a\ndisabled person because he is handicapped”—the relevant inquiry in a Section 504 case is of\nthe benefits provided to disabled people “as compared to the benefits given to non-[disabled]\n33\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 34 of 84\nindividuals.”  See Doe, 148 F.3d at 83.  As another circuit has recently framed it, Section 504\ndoes not provide a right of action to bring “a challenge to the scope of a non-discriminatory\nprogram.”  Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson, 525 F.3d 1256, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\nFollowing Choate, Doe, and Rodriguez, the Court will determine the “benefits” of the\nSection 8 Program primarily by reference to the laws and regulations that control HANH’s\nadministration of the program: the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, 42\nU.S.C. § 1437 et seq. (the “1937 Act”) and HUD’s implementing regulations.  The Court is\nmindful that another court has construed the benefit provided by Section 8 in the context\nof a Rehabilitation Act challenge premised on the inability of “mobility disabled people . . .\nto locate and obtain accessible housing units.”  That court held:\nThe benefits of the [Section 8] Program are a package of services that provide\nassistance to voucher holders in locating affordable housing.  These benefits\ninclude: inspection of premises for compliance with quality standards,\ntraining for landlords, a service representative who may be contacted for\nquestions, weekly landlord briefings to educate landlords interested in\nparticipating in [Section 8], a list of known available units, monthly housing\nfairs, and various other services.\n[Section 8] does not offer participants a place to live as a benefit.  [Section 8]\nis not responsible for locating participant housing. Rather, the onus is on\nprogram participants to find their own rental units.\nLiberty Res., Inc. v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 528 F. Supp. 2d 553, 568, 568 (E.D. Pa. 2007).\nB. The Section 8 Program\nHUD administers the Section 8 Program under the authority of the 1937 Act.  The\nfirst subsection of the Section 8 portion of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f, describes the\npurpose of the Section 8 Program.  It provides: “For the purpose of aiding low-income\nfamilies in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing,\n34\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 35 of 84\nassistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a) (emphasis added).  Under the Section 8\nProgram, in which Plaintiffs participated,17 HUD “may provide assistance to public housing\nagencies for tenant-based assistance using a payment standard established in accordance\nwith [the statute].  The payment standard shall be used to determine the monthly assistance\nthat may be paid for any family.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(1)(A).  There are two forms of assistance\navailable under the voucher program: tenant-based and project-based assistance.\n1. Tenant-Based Assistance\nUnder the tenant-assistance portion of the voucher program, the PHA enters into\n“housing assistance payment contract[s]” with private landlords,18 and the Section 8\nparticipant enters into a lease with the owner under that contract.  Thus, in the statute’s\nterminology,  the  PHA–landlord  document  is  a  “contract,”  and  the  tenant–landlord\ndocument is a “lease.”  See generally id. § 1437f(o)(6), (7).\nThe Act imposes certain requirements on PHA–landlord contracts.  They must\nspecify that except in certain circumstances, the tenant–landlord lease “shall be for a term\nof not less than 1 year,” id. § 1437f(o)(7)(A) (emphasis added),19 and that the tenant–owner\n17 In 1998 Congress merged the then-existing Section 8 certificate and voucher\nprograms, see generally Comer v. Cisneros, 37 F.3d 775, 782 (2d Cir. 1994) (describing these\nprograms), into a single program, the Housing Choice Voucher Program, see Quality\nHousing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, Pub. L. 105–276, Title V, 112 Stat. 2518–2670\n(Oct. 21, 1998) (“QHWRA”).\n18 The statute uses the term “owner,” which is synonymous with the term “landlord,”\nwhich term was used at trial.  Consistent with the parties, the Court uses the term “landlord.”\n19 A lease may be for a term of less than one year “if the [PHA] determines that such\nshorter term would improve housing opportunities for the tenant and if such shorter term\nis considered to be a prevailing local market practice.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(7)(A).\n35\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 36 of 84\nlease be one that is standard in the marketplace and “consistent with State and local law,” id.\n§ 1437f(o)(7)(B).  In addition, the contracts “may include any addenda required by the\nSecretary [of HUD] to set forth the provisions of” the HCV Program.  Id. § 1437f(o)(7)(F). \nMoreover, once the PHA enters into a contract with an owner, it must annually “inspect the\nunit before any assistance payment is made to determine whether the dwelling unit meets”\nhousing quality standards set either by the Secretary of HUD, or “by local housing codes or\nby [PHAs] that . . . (I) meet or exceed housing quality standards . . . and (II) do not severely\nrestrict housing choice.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(8)(B) (housing quality standards), (D) (inspections\nmust be annual).  HUD regulations further specify that the PHA must obtain HUD’s\napproval to “apply standards in local housing codes or other codes adopted by the PHA.” \n24 C.F.R. § 382.401(a)(4)(ii).  Finally, the statute implies that HUD may authorize grounds\nupon which a PHA “may elect not to enter into a housing assistance payments contract.”\nAs to the rent paid to a landlord, the 1937 Act requires that the rent paid pursuant\nto the Section 8 Program be reasonably comparable to “rents charged for comparable\ndwelling units in the private, unassisted local market.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(10)(A).  The\nPHA must assist the recipient, at her request, in negotiating the amount of rent for which\nthe unit is leased:\nA [PHA] . . . shall, at the request of a family receiving tenant-based assistance\nunder this subsection, assist that family in negotiating a reasonable rent with\na dwelling unit owner.  A [PHA] . . . shall review the rent for a unit under\nconsideration by the family (and all rent increases for units under lease by\nthe family) to determine whether the rent (or rent increase) requested by the\nowner is reasonable.  If a [PHA] . . . determines that the rent (or rent\nincrease) for a dwelling unit is not reasonable, the [PHA] . . . shall not make\nhousing assistance payments to the owner under this subsection with respect\nto that unit.\n36\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 37 of 84\nId. § 1437f(o)(10)(B).\nAs these statutes suggest, using funds received from HUD, HANH provides eligible\nfamilies with vouchers to cover a portion of the cost of rent and utilities that such families\nincur by living in privately-owned housing.  In the statutory language, HUD “provide[s]\nassistance to public housing agencies for tenant-based assistance using a payment standard.” \nId. § 1437f(o)(1)(A).  Or as HUD explains, “[i]n the HUD Housing Choice Voucher\nProgram . . . HUD pays rental subsidies so eligible families can afford decent, safe and\nsanitary housing.  Both programs are generally administered by State or local governmental\nentities called public housing agencies (PHAs).”  24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(1).  See also Langlois\nv. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 45 (1st Cir. 2000) (the Section 8 Program “requires the\nPHA to pay the family’s landlord the difference between the gross rent or a ‘payment\nstandard’ adopted by the PHA, and a lesser amount paid by the family”).\nEach year, HUD establishes by publication in the Federal Register a “fair market\nrent[],”  or  “FMR,”  for  thousands  of  geographic areas  across  the  country,  42  U.S.C.\n§ 1437f(c)(1), and these FMRs provide the baseline for calculating the payment standard for\nthe voucher program’s tenant-based assistance, which, unless the HUD Secretary otherwise\nprovides, is to be between 90 and 110 percent of the FMR, id. § 1437f(o)(1)(B).  The\nstatutory scheme contemplates that the payment standard will be flexible.  HUD may\nestablish an “adjustment pool” of money from its budget allocation to use “to make adjusted\npayments to [PHAs] . . . to ensure continued affordability, if the Secretary determines that\nadditional assistance for such purpose is necessary, based on documentation submitted by\na [PHA].”  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(1)(C).  HUD may also authorize a payment standard that\n37\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 38 of 84\nis more than 110 percent of the FMR—resulting in the so-called “exception rent.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(1)(D).\nOnce a payment standard has been determined for an area, a family that is deemed\neligible to participate in the Section 8 Program20 and whose application has been accepted\nby the PHA receives a voucher, during the term of which the family must find a unit to rent. \nThereafter, the PHA provides the family financial assistance in the form of a “monthly\nassistance payment” calculated in one of two ways: (1) where the cost of rent plus tenant-\npaid utilities “does not exceed the applicable payment standard,” the payment is calculated\nas the difference between that sum and the family’s contribution;21 or (2) where the cost of\nrent plus tenant-paid utilities “exceeds the applicable payment standard,” the payment is\ncalculated as the difference between the payment standard and the family’s contribution. \nA family’s contribution “may not exceed 40 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the\nfamily.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(2)(A)–(C).  HUD regulations explain that “[h]ousing assistance\npayments are paid to the owner.”  24 C.F.R. § 982.311(a).  These payments are made under\na housing assistance payment (“HAP”) contract.\n2. Project-Based Assistance\nIn the project-based assistance scheme,\n[a] [PHA] may use  amounts provided under an annual contributions\ncontract under this subsection to enter into a housing assistance payment\ncontract with respect to an existing, newly constructed, or rehabilitated\nstructure, that is attached to the structure, subject to the limitations and\nrequirements of this paragraph.\n20 Eligibility criteria are set forth at § 1437f(o)(4).\n21 The family’s contribution is the greatest of “30 percent of the monthly adjusted\nincome of the family,” or “10 percent of the monthly income of the family,” or the amount\nof welfare payments designated by the public welfare agency “to meet the housing costs of\nthe family.”  42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(2)(A).\n38\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 39 of 84\n42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(13)(A).\nA PHA may enter into a project-based assistance contract—which “may have a term\nof up to 15 years,” id. § 1437f(o)(13)(F)—if “the contract is consistent with” both the PHA’s\nadministrative plan and “the goal of deconcentrating poverty and expanding housing and\neconomic opportunities.”  Id. § 1437f(o)(13)(C).  A PHA may apply up to “20 percent of the\nfunding  available  [to  it]  for  tenant-based  assistance”  to  project-based  assistance,  id.\n§ 1437f(o)(13)(B), and unless the contract is “for dwelling units that are” either “single\nfamily properties” or “specifically made available for households comprised of elderly\nfamilies, disabled families, and families receiving supportive services,” a maximum of one-\nquarter of the units in the structure receiving project-based assistance “may be assisted\nunder  a  housing  assistance  payment  contract  for  project-based  assistance.”    Id.\n§ 1437f(o)(13)(D).  A PHA–owner contract for project-based assistance “shall establish rents\nfor each unit assisted in an amount that does not exceed 110 percent of the applicable fair\nmarket rental (or any exception payment standard approved by the Secretary pursuant to\nparagraph (1)(D)),” id. § 1437f(o)(13)(H), and reasonable rent adjustments are permitted,\nid. § 1437f(o)(13)(I).  The PHA has discretion to “establish preferences or criteria for\nselection for a unit assisted under this paragraph that are consistent with” its administrative\nplan.  Id. § 1437f(o)(13)(J).\n3. Moving to Work\nIn 1996 Congress created the Moving to Work (“MTW”) demonstration program,\nthe purpose of which is \nto  give  [PHAs]  and  [HUD]  the  flexibility  to  design  and  test  various\napproaches for providing and administering housing assistance that: reduce\ncost and achieve greater cost effectiveness in Federal expenditures; give\n39\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 40 of 84\nincentives to families with children where the head of household is working,\nseeking work, or is preparing for work by participating in job training,\neducational programs, or programs that assist people to obtain employment\nand become economically self-sufficient; and increase housing choices for\nlow-income families.\nOmnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104–134, Title\nII, § 204, 110 Stat. 1321, 1321–281 to 282 (Apr. 26, 1996).  The program is still in a\ndemonstration phase, and has not been codified.  See id.  The PHAs selected by HUD to\nparticipate in the Moving to Work program (of which there may be up to 30) receive from\nHUD “training and technical assistance during the demonstration,” and HUD must\n“conduct detailed evaluations of up to 15 such agencies in an effort to identify replicable\nprogram models promoting the purpose of the demonstration.”  Id. § 204(b).  The benefit\nto a PHA participating in the Moving to Work program is that \nnotwithstanding any provision of the United States Housing Act of 1937\nexcept as provided in subsection (e), [the PHA] may combine operating\nassistance provided under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937,\nmodernization  assistance  provided  under  section  14  of  such  Act,  and\nassistance provided under section 8 of such Act for the certificate and voucher\nprograms, to provide housing assistance for low-income families, as defined in\nsection 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, and services to\nfacilitate the transition to work on such terms and conditions as the [PHA]\nmay propose and the Secretary may approve.\nId. (emphases added).  Thus, the idea of the MTW program is to grant PHAs additional\nflexibility in managing their funding and assets with the goals of both providing housing and\nfacilitating participants’ transition to employment.  Id.  A PHA’s overall funding level “shall\nnot be diminished by its participation” in the Moving to Work program.  Id. at § 204(f).  A\nPHA participating in the MTW program must administer its Section 8 Program in\naccordance with an agreement it executes with HUD.\n40\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 41 of 84\n4. The Benefit of Section 8\nNeither the 1937 Act nor implementing HUD regulations, nor the MTW legislation,\nstate that as part of its administration of a Section 8 housing voucher program, a PHA must\nassist an eligible family in finding a unit; in fact they strongly suggest the contrary.  The 1937\nAct states only that “the term ‘tenant-based assistance’ means rental assistance . . . that\nprovides for the eligible family to select suitable housing and to move to other suitable\nhousing.”    42  U.S.C.  §  1437f(f)(7)  (emphasis  added).    HUD  explains  that  “[w]ith\ntenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family,” 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(b)(1)\n(emphasis added), and “[w]hen a family is selected [to participate in the program] or when\na participant family wants to move to another unit, the PHA issues a voucher to the family. \nThe  family  may  search  for  a  unit,”  id.  §  982.302(a)  (emphasis  added);  see  also  id.\n§ 982.1(b)(2) (“To receive tenant-based assistance, the family selects a suitable unit.”). When\nthe family finds a suitable unit, it “must submit to the PHA a request for approval of the\ntenancy and a copy of the lease” pursuant to a PHA-set procedure.  Id. § 982.302(c), (d); see\nalso Liberty Res., 528 F. Supp. 2d at 568, 569 (holding that §§ 982.1(b)(1) and 982.302\ndemonstrate that “the onus is on program participants to find their own rental units” and\nthat “[t]he regulations generally put the onus of locating an available unit in the marketplace\nwholly on the voucher holder”).\nSimilarly, HANH’s Administrative Plans dated March 28, 2006 and May 27, 2008,\nwhich “establish[] local policies for administration of the program in accordance with HUD\nrequirements” upon adoption by HANH’s Board of Commissioners, and under which\nHANH must administer its Section 8 voucher program, see 24 C.F.R. § 982.54(a)–(c), explain\nthat when HANH selects a family from the waiting list, or when a family wants to move,\n41\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 42 of 84\n“HANH issues a Housing Choice Voucher,” which “is the family’s authorization to search\nfor housing” (March 2006 Admin. Plan, Jt. Ex. 2, at 5-13; May 2008 Admin. Plan, Jt. Ex. 16,\nat 56).  The Plans state that the voucher’s initial term is 60 calendar days, during which a\nfamily must find a suitable unit and submit a request for tenancy approval.  HANH states\nthat it may extend the period if “[i]t is necessary as a reasonable accommodation for a person\nwith disabilities.”  (March 2006 Admin. Plan at 5-14; May 2008 Admin. Plan at 57.)\nThese sources make clear that the “individual services offered,” Choate, 469 U.S. at\n303, constituting the “benefit” of HANH’s “program or activity,” includes the provision of\na voucher to a participant to find a unit; monthly assistance payments to a landlord to cover\nsome portion of the cost of renting a private dwelling; and, upon request, assistance in a\nfamily’s negotiation of a “reasonable rent.”  But this benefit does not include help finding\nhousing, the provision of housing, or a guarantee that a participant will find suitable\nhousing.  As the Liberty Resources court concluded, “[n]either the [1937 Act] nor the HUD\nregulation promise to provide housing to all eligible participants.  Rather, they state that the\npurpose of [the Section 8 Program] is to aid families in locating and affording decent\nhousing through the provision of rental subsidies.  The [Section 8] Program facilitates the\nplacement of low-income families in affordable housing by seeking the assistance of private\nsector landlords.”  528 F. Supp. 2d at 567.  Congress’s statement of purpose bolsters this\nconclusion.  In 1998 Congress amended the 1937 Act to explain that\nIt is the policy of the United States . . . that the Federal Government cannot\nthrough its direct action alone provide for the housing of every American\ncitizen, or even a majority of its citizens, but it is the responsibility of the\nGovernment to promote and protect the independent and collective actions\nof  private  citizens  to  develop  housing  and  strengthen  their  own\nneighborhoods.\n42\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 43 of 84\n42 U.S.C. § 1437(a)(2), as amended by QHWRA, Pub. L. 105–276, sec. 505, 112 Stat. 2461,\n2523; see also id. § 1437(a)(4).  And as noted above, Congress has explained that the HCV\nProgram’s purpose is to “aid[] low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live” by\nhaving PHAs make “assistance payments . . . with respect to existing housing.”  Id.\n§ 1437f(a).\nC. HANH Policies Regarding Disabled Participants\nIn a section entitled “Assistance to Voucher Holders,” HANH’s Administrative Plans\nstate that\nFamilies who require additional assistance during their search may call\nHANH Office to request assistance.  Voucher holders will be notified at their\nbriefing session that HANH periodically updates the listing of available units\nand how the updated list may be obtained.\nHANH will assist families with negotiations with owners and provide other\nassistance related to the families’ search for housing.\n(March 2006 Admin. Plan at 5-16; May 2008 Admin. Plan at 59.)  These Administrative\nPlans predate and postdate, and are not inconsistent with, a HUD investigative report of\nHANH, dated September 26, 2006, that explained, with reference to Section 504 and 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28, that HANH “is obligated to aid persons with disabilities in locating accessible\nunits in its Section 8 [P]rogram.”  (HUD Sec. 504 Investigative Report # 1-06-R001-4, Jt. Ex.\n3, at 9.)  Similarly, HANH Executive Director Karen DuBois–Walton testified that while a\nparticipating family is using a housing choice voucher to search for an apartment, “[i]f a\nfamily requires assistance, [HANH] will offer assistance in identifying [a] unit,” and will also\nextend the voucher’s term “[i]f they’re having a hard time finding a unit.”  (Trial Tr. Vol. II\n(8/18/09) at 348, 351 (emphasis added).)\n43\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 44 of 84\nThese services provided by HANH do not change the Court’s conclusions that the\nSection 8 Program’s benefit consists of the voucher, housing assistance payments, and, upon\nrequest, lease negotiation; and that the program’s benefit does not include search assistance,\nhousing, or a guarantee of suitable housing.  Indeed, as one court has explained them, “the\nregulations reflect an expectation by HUD that [Section 8] participants will select units that\nalready meet individual needs and quality standards based on their existing state. . . . The\nregulations generally put the onus of locating an available unit in the marketplace wholly on\nthe voucherholder.”  Liberty Res., 528 F. Supp. 2d at 569.  While HANH may help its Section\n8 participants participate in the private housing market, the benefit—the very purpose—of\nthe Section 8 Program is to provide recipients financial assistance necessary for them to\nparticipate in the private housing market.\nV. General Findings of Fact\nHANH is a public housing authority created by the State of Connecticut and\nempowered by the City of New Haven to conduct its business within the jurisdiction of the\nNew  Haven–Meriden  Metropolitan  Statistical  Area  (“New  Haven  MSA”).22    HANH\nadministers both the low-income public housing (“LIPH”) program and the Section 8\nProgram for the New Haven MSA.  It now administers approximately 4,520 vouchers under\nthe Section 8 Program (HANH Moving to Work Annual Plan for Fiscal Year 2008, Jt. Ex. 13,\n22 See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 8-40, 8-41; see also March 2006 Admin. Plan, Jt. Ex. 2, at\n1-2 (stating jurisdiction as “City of New Haven”); May 2008 Admin. Plan, Jt. Ex. 16, at 242\n(stating jurisdiction as the New Haven MSA and listing towns in it); see also, e.g., HUD,\nFinal Fair Market Rents for Fiscal Year 2010, 74 Fed. Reg. 50552, 50568 (Sept. 30, 2009)\n(listing this MSA and the towns in it, and assigning fair market rents to the area for Fiscal\nYear 2010).\n44\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 45 of 84\nat 29 (Draft Rev. Jan. 25, 2008)), and in July 2006 it administered approximately 4,345\nvouchers (HUD Investigation Report Review No. 01-06-R001-4, Jt. Ex. 3, at 9).\nIn 2001, HUD selected HANH to participate in the MTW program, and while Jimmy\nMiller was executive director, HANH, with the help of the mayor of New Haven and other\nofficials, negotiated and executed a renewed MTW agreement with HUD to begin in the\n2007–08 fiscal year.  (Vol. I (8/17/09) at 161–65 (Miller).)  As a MTW PHA, HANH was\nfreed from the obligation to comply with many of the regulations covering non-MTW\nSection 8 programs, but it was required to submit an annual plan to HUD for approval. \nUnder Miller’s direction, in 2008 HANH sought HUD’s approval to amend its plan to permit\nHANH to provide housing assistance payments  of up to 150 percent of the HUD-\ndetermined fair market rent without seeking approval from HUD, in part to permit it to\nprovide  higher  payments  to  its  disabled  Section  8  participants  as  a  reasonable\naccommodation without having to ask HUD for approval each time.  (HANH Draft 2008\nMTW Plan, Jt. Ex. 13, at 10, 74; HUD Letter to Jimmy Miller dated Jan. 28, 2008, Pls.’ Ex. 17\n(approving HANH 2008 MTW Plan); see also, e.g., Tr. Vol. I at 163 (Miller); Tr.

Vol. VII (9/8/09) at 1257, 1272,\n1374–76 (Heinrichs).)  By way of explanation for why HANH did not earlier seek HUD’s\napproval for the higher pre-approved payment amount, William Heinrichs, HANH’s former\nSpecial Assistant to the Executive Director and Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator,\ntestified that because the MTW program is in a demonstration stage, “being an MTW agency\nis akin to building an airplane while you fly it,” and HANH was one of the first agencies to\nconsider asking for this specific form of pre-approval.  (Tr. Vol. VII at 1387–88.)\n45\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 46 of 84\nMiller, who had previously been a deputy director at the PHAs in Newark and New\nYork City, became HANH’s executive director on December 5, 2005.  He stayed in that\nposition for over two and a half years, when on July 30, 2008 Karen DuBois–Walton replaced\nhim as executive director.  DuBois–Walton remains executive director today.  (Tr. Vol. I at\n42–43, 62–63 (Miller); Tr. Vol. II at 339–40 (DuBois–Walton).)\nMaureen Novak began working for HANH in July 2001 as the Special Assistant to\nthe Deputy Executive Director.  On January 8, 2007, Miller named her Special Assistant to\nthe Executive Director, in which position she worked until August 6, 2007, when she\nrequested a leave of absence.  Novak never returned to HANH.  (Jt. Ex. 6.)  Although Miller\ntestified that at some point he recognized a “philosophical difference” between Novak and\nhimself about “the scope of” HUD’s regulations under Section 504 and “the amount of\nservices and nature of services” that the regulations obligated HANH to provide—including\nmobility counseling—and that he, unlike she, believed that HANH “should be doing that on\na proactive nature” (Tr. Vol. I at 103–04 [sic]), no supervisor ever reprimanded Novak or\notherwise unfavorably reviewed her work (see Jt. Ex. 6).\nWhile Novak was working at HANH, the agency’s reasonable accommodation forms\nlisted her as HANH’s Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator.  (E.g., Defs.’ Ex. 300.)  In\nFebruary 2007 Miller hired William Heinrichs—who had previously served as Representative\nRosa DeLauro’s congressional aide for housing, environment, homeland security, and\nveterans affairs—to serve as a Special Assistant to HANH’s Executive Director.  When\nNovak left HANH in August 2007, Heinrichs also took on the position of Reasonable\nAccommodations Coordinator.  He served in both positions until May 12, 2008, when he\nleft HANH.  (Tr. Vol. VI (8/24/09) at 1178–82.)  Thereafter, Laura Woodie, who had been\n46\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 47 of 84\nworking at HANH in different capacities since February 2005, took over as Reasonable\nAccommodations Coordinator.  (Jt. Ex. 29 at ¶ 6.)23\nBefore Miller became executive director, HANH had contracted with Housing\nOpportunities Unlimited (“HOU”) on June 9, 2004 to, inter alia, “[p]rovide individualized\ncounseling  and  assistance  to  help  referred  families  locate  and  lease  up  appropriate\napartments in the private market,” including meeting with families to assess their needs,\nidentifying available apartments, transporting families to see available apartments, assisting\nfamilies to apply for the apartments, and coordinating with HANH so that HANH staff\ncould complete inspections, pay security deposits, and “arrange moving services and\ntransfers of utilities.”  (Jt. Ex. 1, Contract No. AD-04-C-007, at 1–2.)  The contract covered\nup to $100,000 worth of services to be completed by June 10, 2005, and permitted HANH,\n“at its option, [to] elect to renew th[e] contract for an additional consecutive 2-year period.” \n23 Woodie began at HANH in February 2005 as a Quality Assurance Analyst.  In\nOctober 2006 she became the Acting Service Center Supervisor, and then in February 2007\nthe Service Center Supervisor.  In February 2008, Woodie became Acting LIPH Supervisor,\na  position  she  maintained  until  May  2008,  when  she  became  Acting  Reasonable\nAccommodations Coordinator.  Woodie was named the Reasonable Accommodations\nCoordinator in December 2008, a position she held until May 2009 when she requested a\nleave of absence.  (See Jt. Ex. 29.)\n47\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 48 of 84\n(Id. at 1, 4.)24   Miller testified that when he became executive director in December 2005 the\nHANH–HOU contract had expired.  (Tr. 8/17/09 at 43–46.)\nOn July 20 and 21, 2006, HUD began an investigation of HANH to determine\nwhether HANH’s programs complied with “the general regulatory provisions of Section 504,\nprogram accessibility and employment policies,” and on September 26, 2006 reported to\nHANH Board Chairman William DeMayo that HUD’s “preliminary finding [was] that\n[HANH] is not in compliance with Section 504 regulations with respect to program\naccessibility requirements.”  HUD “did not find evidence that [] HANH is fulfilling [its]\nobligations” under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, a finding that HANH disputed.25  Nonetheless, a year\nlater, on June 27, 2007, HANH entered into a Voluntary Compliance Agreement (“VCA”)\n24 On July 29, 2004 HANH and HOU amended the contract so that HANH could\nprovide HOU with office space (id. at 6), and on June 17, 2005, HANH renewed the contract\n“for another consecutive two years or until required residents have been successfully\nrelocated from the Brookside Community” (id. at 7).  Brookside is a building operated by\nHANH as part of its LIPH portfolio.  The original Brookside building had stairs and was not\naccessible, and therefore the people living there—whom HOU needed to relocate under the\nJune 2005 contract addendum—were not disabled.  (Tr. 8/20/09 at 818 (Woodie); see also \nHUD Investigation Report Review No. 01-06-R001-4, Jt. Ex. 3, at 7 (noting that Brookside\nwas built in 1960 and that three of its 295 units (1 percent) were accessible in June 2006).) \nHANH has planned to re-build Brookside and include in it accessible units.  Greg Brunson,\none HOU employee who provided the relocation services, testified that Brookside’s tenants\nwere relocated in “[e]arly 2000” (Tr. Vol. V (8/21/09) at 1037 (Brunson)), but that does not\naccord with the 2005 contract addendum date.  In any event, at this point no one lives in \nBrookside, and construction on the new Brookside building was set to begin in October 2009\nand be completed in February 2012.  (Defs.’ Ex. 290; Tr. Vol. II at 410 (DuBois–Walton).)\n25 HUD Investigation Report Review No. 01-06-R001-4, Jt. Ex. 3, at 1, 4, 9; HANH\nReply to HUD Section 504 Investigative Report, Jt. Ex. 4, at 2–3 (“HANH believes that we\nare compliant with the requirements of 24 CFR 8.28. . . . We are concerned that statements\nin the report may be understood as a representation that HUD has determined that HANH\nis not compliant with 24 CFR 8.28.”).\n48\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 49 of 84\nwith HUD, under which HANH “voluntarily” agreed to settle its differences with HUD\nregarding HUD’s view of HANH’s compliance with Section 504 and 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 without\nadmitting “any violation of Section 504 . . . or any other Statute, Regulation or Executive\nOrder.”  (VCA, Jt. Ex. 5, at 2.)  The VCA primarily addressed HANH’s obligations to\nconstruct or modify its own LIPH buildings to make them accessible, but also included some\nprovisions regarding the Section 8 Program.  HANH agreed to “compile a list of units that\nare accessible to persons with disabilities and otherwise eligible for participation in its\nhousing choice voucher program so that persons with disabilities may participate in the\nprogram,” including identification of what features in the unit are accessible—and to submit\nthat list to HUD.  (Id. at 7, 8.)  HANH also agreed to improve its recordkeeping of its\nparticipants’ requests for reasonable accommodations by “record[ing] each reasonable\naccommodation request, the date received, the action taken, and the date the action was\ntaken,” and to train its staff on how to comply with Section 504.  (Id. at 8, 10.)  Finally, the\nVCA stated that HANH’s noncompliance “may serve as grounds for [HUD] imposing\ndebarment” under 24 C.F.R. part 24 and 2 C.F.R. part 2424 (id. at 12), following the\nadministrative-enforcement scheme described above in the discussion of a private right of\naction to enforce 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a).\nPrivately-owned wheelchair-accessible apartments in New Haven are very scarce,26\nand disabled Section 8 Program participants have particular difficulty finding and leasing\naccessible apartments because private landlords exhibit both bias against the disabled (see,\ne.g., Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 35 (Taylor)) as well as “bias about people with Section\n26 Tr. Vol. V at 1102–03 (Salovitz); see also Tr. Vol. III at 488 (Gaither) (agreeing that\n“four-bedroom accessible units were very hard to come by in New Haven”).\n49\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 50 of 84\n8” (Tr. Vol. I at 133–34 (Runlet)).  In August 2007 and under Miller’s direction, HANH\npublished a Request for Proposals (“RFP”) to provide mobility counseling, including search\nassistance, for all of its Section 8 participants, including its disabled participants.  (RFP, Jt.\nEx. 9, at 5, 20–24.)  Only one entity, Home, Inc., submitted a proposal, but negotiations\nbetween HANH and Home, Inc., broke down because Miller “wanted a performance-based\ncontract that would have specific deliverables,” while Home, Inc. wanted to use almost 65\npercent of the $250,000 in funds to pay for its salaries.  (Tr. Vol. I at 59–61 (Miller).) \nNegotiations ended in early 2008, after which Miller re-published the RFP.  HANH has not\ncontracted with an outside entity to provide mobility counseling under a contract reached\npursuant to this RFP.  (Id. at 60–61.)\nOn April 25, 2007 Rhonda Gaither, a Section 8 participant whose 14-year-old son has\ncerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, sued HANH to obtain assistance relocating her family\nto a wheelchair-accessible four-bedroom unit.  Just over three months later, on August 3,\n2007 and with the approval of HANH’s Board, Miller extended the expired HANH–HOU\ncontract—under which $57,000 in services had not yet been rendered by HOU—so that an\nHOU employee could help Gaither find and move into an accessible unit.27\n27 On August 7, 2007, Miller wrote to HUD’s Hartford field office to explain that he\nwas “declaring an emergency so that I can engage the services of [HOU] to provide mobility\ncounseling  to  the  Gaither  family,”  that  he  would  do  so  by  extending  the  expired\nHANH–HOU contract for three months, and that under the extension “HOU will provide\nthese services for the Gaither family and other families having similar needs for accessible\nunits.”  (Jt. Ex. 7.)  To extend the contract Miller needed the approval of HANH’s Board of\nCommissioners, to whom he submitted a recommendation and draft resolution.  On August\n28, 2007 the Board of Commissioners met and discussed the language of the resolution.  (See\nMinutes of the Meeting, Jt. Ex. 10, at 20.)  Commissioner Robert Solomon suggested that the\nproposal “was totally unintelligible” and recommended clarifying the language by making\n“a grammatical change.”  (Tr. Vol. III at 612–13 (Solomon); see also Jt. Ex. 10 at 21.)  On\n50\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 51 of 84\nThat HOU employee, Greg Brunson, located at least one accessible unit (Tr. Vol. III\nat 477–78 (Gaither); see also id. at 488–89 (noting that absent her direction, Brunson was\nfinding apartments in areas to which Gaither had no interest in moving)), but HANH did\nnot permit Gaither to rent the apartment because it was above the payment standard HANH\nwas authorized to provide to Gaither (Tr. Vol. V (8/21/09) at 1041–41 (Brunson)).\nWith assistance Gaither also located a local developer, Joseph O’Sullivan, who\nexpressed a willingness to purchase a building and retrofit it to make the units wheelchair-\naccessible, and to lease one of these units to the Gaither family.  He and HANH estimated\nthat once the Gaither family’s four-bedroom unit was constructed, its monthly rent would\nbe $1,994, and the monthly cost of utilities would be an additional $328 to $394.  (Tr. Vol.\nAugust 28, 2007, the Board approved and Miller signed a resolution that permitted him to\nextend the contract expend “funds to assist the [Gaither] family . . . and . . . to provide such\nassistance to other families in the Section 8 Program who . . . have the need for accessible\nrental units.”  (Jt. Ex. 8 at 2.)  Because the resolution passed pursuant to his emergency\ndeclaration, Miller felt uncomfortable extending services under the extension to more than\ntwo families:\n[T]he broad issue was hopefully being addressed by request for proposal,\nwhich is the appropriate way to handle the procurement.  I would not have\ndone this for 10, 15, 20, 30 families because in my opinion that would have\nbeen violation of the procurement requirements. . . . As a matter of scope,\nand one can disagree, but the issue was we had those two families that I knew\nof that needed immediate assistance.  We thought we were going to cure the\nother issue with the RFP that was already there and have a broad RFP to\ncover everyone.  Again, this was me saying this is an emergency. If I’m saying\nit’s an emergency, then I’m saying it’s of a limited scope and of limited\nduration; otherwise, it negates the issue of being emergency.  So it’s a matter\nof scope, it’s not a matter of me making up it. . . . There is no magic about the\nthree or four or five, it’s just that I am rather conservative when it comes to\nprocurement, and that’s all it is.\n(Tr. Vol. I at 115–16.)\n51\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 52 of 84\nIII at 492–94, 518 (Gaither); id. at 639–40 (Barber); Tr. Vol. VI at 1155–56, 1165–72\n(Barber); Tr. Vol. VII at 1265–66 (Heinrichs).)  Because the total monthly cost—between\n$2,322 to $2,388—exceeded by 59 to 64 percent the FMR approved by HUD for that fiscal\nyear ($1,238), and also exceeded the maximum payment HANH was authorized to make to\na Section 8 participant without HUD approval, HANH sought approval from HUD’s field\noffices in Hartford and Boston to pay for this housing for Gaither.  The HUD field office in\nBoston denied the request, explaining that Section 8 payments may only be made to existing\nunits, and that this request sought too high an increase over the fair market rent.  (See\ngenerally Jt. Ex. 7.)\nUltimately, Gaither herself found an accessible unit in Hamden, for which HANH\nwould execute a HAP contract.  Gaither executed the lease on June 20, 2008.  (See Pls.’ Ex.\n6 at 66–76; Tr. Vol. III at 482 (Gaither agreeing that she found the apartment by herself).) \nHANH had agreed to pay Brunson only if he found a unit into which Gaither actually\nmoved; because Gaither did not move into a unit Brunson had located, Brunson was never\npaid for his work.  (Tr. Vol. V at 1039–40 (Brunson).)\nVI. Discussion\nA. Decertification of the Class\nIt is the Second Circuit’s “longstanding view that the district court is often in the best\nposition to assess the propriety of the class and has the ability . . . to alter or modify the class,\ncreate subclasses, and decertify the class whenever warranted,” In re Sumitomo Copper Litig.,\n262 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir. 2001), so long as it is “before final judgment,” see Fed. R. Civ. P.\n23(c)(1)(C).  Thus, “[i]f factual or legal underpinnings of the plaintiffs’ successful class\ncertification motion are undermined once they are tested [on the merits], a modification of\n52\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 53 of 84\nthe  order,  or  perhaps  decertification,  might  then  be  appropriate.”    In  re  Visa\nCheck/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., 192 F.R.D. 68, 89 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (“Visa Check”), aff’d,\n280 F.3d 124, 141 (2d Cir. 2001) (noting the existence of “a number of management tools\navailable to a district court to address any individualized . . . issues that might arise in a class\naction, including” decertification), abrogated on other grounds, In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 39–40\n(regarding scope of evidentiary inquiry district court must make when certifying class under\nRule 23).  Indeed, “courts are ‘required to reassess their class rulings as the case develops,’”\nand “‘[t]he district judge must define, redefine, subclass, and decertify as appropriate in\nresponse to the progression of the case from assertion to facts.’”  Boucher v. Syracuse Univ.,\n164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Barnes v. The Am. Tobacco Co., 161 F.3d 127, 140\n(3d Cir. 1998) and quoting, in parenthetical, Richardson v. Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th\nCir. 1983)).\nThe evidence at trial does not support the continued viability of a certified class.  In\nparticular, the Court based its conclusion that there was sufficient commonality and\ntypicality on Plaintiffs’ allegation “that [HANH’s] policy, pattern and/or practice is triggered\nby their status as Disabled Section 8 Households, regardless of their particular disabilities,\nsuch that Defendants allegedly act on grounds generally applicable to all named plaintiffs\nand putative class members.”  Taylor, 257 F.R.D. at 32 (alteration in original).  The evidence\nat trial does not support a conclusion that HANH took any discriminatory action or a\nprogrammatic approach to Disabled Section 8 Households because of their disability. \nTherefore, the class cannot remain certified.  In addition, judgment  must  enter for\nDefendants on any part of Count Three—in which Plaintiffs claimed the existence of such\n53\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 54 of 84\na policy—that survived the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs do not have a private right of\naction to enforce 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a).\n1. Findings of Fact\nThe evidence showed that HANH’s Section 8 Program includes participants with a\nnumber of different disabilities in a number of different circumstances, who required myriad\ndifferent accommodations.  The evidence also does not support any conclusion that\nDefendants acted in a programmatic fashion.\nIn some cases, such as that of the Taylor family, the head of the household, who must\naccept an apartment, submit to HANH a request for tenancy approval, and sign a lease, is\nmobility impaired, and therefore to reasonably accommodate the household HANH may be\nrequired to transport the head of household as part of its mobility counseling.  In other\ncircumstances, such as those of the Gaither family, the head of household is not mobility-\ndisabled, but another member of the household is.  The services that an able-bodied head of\nhousehold requires to find an accessible unit differs from the services that a disabled head\nof household needs.  Cf. 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) (applying not only when the voucher-holder\nis disabled, but also where “a family . . . includes an individual with [disabilities]”).  Indeed,\nthe evidence showed that while HANH contracted with HOU to provide Rhonda Gaither\nassistance in searching for accessible units, Gaither—who is able-bodied and whose son is\nconfined to a wheelchair—was physically able to travel around to search for accessible units\non her own, and in fact she herself found the unit in which she now lives.\nIn addition, some HANH Section 8 voucher-holders seek to move—and thus may\nrequire mobility counseling—while others do not.  For example, Taylor sought HANH’s\nservices to help her family move to an accessible unit (see Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg.\n54\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 55 of 84\n[Doc.  #  43]  at  36),  but  voucher-holder  Alberto  Oko  requested,  as  a  reasonable\naccommodation, a utility allowance increase to account for rising electricity costs associated\nwith his powered wheelchair (see Pls.’ Ex. 41 at No. 71 at 2).  In at least one other case, the\nvoucher-holder, Patricia Borelli, did not want to move out of her non-accessible home, but\nHANH demanded that she move anyway because she required one bedroom but had a\nvoucher entitling her to three bedrooms.  (Pls.’ Ex. 40 at P.B. at 1–9; Tr. Vol. IV at 952–55\n(Woodie).)  And Salovitz reflects both circumstances.  In April 2008, he requested a\nreasonable accommodation to increase his utility allowance in the apartment in which he\nthen resided.  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 15.)  This was not a request for which HANH needed to provide\nSalovitz any mobility counseling.  (See id. at 20.)  In May 2009, by contrast, he wanted to\nmove to another accessible unit, and in this circumstance sought HANH’s assistance with\nsearching for units with accessibility features.  (Id. at 21.)28\nMoreover, different Disabled Section 8 Households had different needs, and HANH\ndid not act programmatically in responding to different needs or requests of different\nDisabled Section 8 Households.\nMany  disabled  voucher-holders  sought,  as  a  reasonable  accommodation,  an\nallowance in their vouchers for an extra bedroom to accommodate a live-in aide.  (See, e.g.,\nPls.’ Ex. 40 at 25 (Borelli’s request for a live-in aide); Tr. Vol. V at 981 (Woodie) (stating that\nDuBois–Walton approved Borelli’s request); see also Tr. Vol. VII at 1404–06 (Heinrichs)\n(estimating that one-third of all reasonable accommodation requests were for an extra\nbedroom for a live-in aide, and they were routinely approved); March 2006 Admin. Plan at\n15-4 to 5 (“HANH will approve a live-in aide if needed as a reasonable accommodation so\n28 The facts pertaining to Salovitz’s claim are discussed in greater detail infra.\n55\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 56 of 84\nthat the program is readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.”); May 2008\nAdmin. Plan at 180 (same); id. at 51–53, 154; Spreadsheet of Reasonable Accommodation\nRequests as of Feb. 20, 2008, Pls.’ Ex. 41f (cataloging bases of requests).)\nSalovitz also reflects this circumstance, since in early 2006 he requested a voucher\nthat permitted him a three-bedroom apartment that would provide sufficient space for a\nlive-in aide, his equipment, and himself.  (See Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 2.)  The evidence shows that\nthese  requests  were  generally  granted  after  HANH  received  verification  from  the\nparticipant’s physician of the participant’s medical need for a live-in aide.  This, for example,\nis how HANH handled Patricia Borelli’s and Karl Hunter’s requests for live-in aides.  (Pls.’\nEx. 40 (Borelli); Tr. Vol. IV at 940 (Woodie) (describing her verification of Hunter’s medical\nneed for a live-in aide).)  And many disabled voucher-holders requested, as reasonable\naccommodations, that HANH extend the period of validity of their shopping vouchers so\nthat they would have more time to find new apartments.  The evidence showed that\nthroughout the liability period, HANH routinely granted these requests for up to six months. \n(Tr. Vol. VIII (9/8/09) at 156 (Plaintiffs’ counsel stating that “I have never contested HANH\nnever provided extensions”); see also Tr. Vol. I at 257 (Miller); Tr. Vol. VI at 1156–57\n(Barber); Tr. Vol. VIII at 19–20 (Santiago).)\nThe evidence also reflects no programmatic decision by HANH not to request\nexception rents as a reasonable accommodation for Disabled Section 8 Households, even\nbefore January 2008, when HANH obtained HUD’s approval under the MTW program to\nmake payments of up to 150 percent of FMR without seeking HUD’s approval each time. \nIn June 2007, when Andre Knox filed a reasonable accommodation request for a barrier-free\nunit that was wheelchair accessible, HANH had authority to authorize payments of only up\n56\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 57 of 84\nto 110 percent of FMR; to go above this amount HANH required approval from HUD.  After\nobtaining verification of Knox’s need for accessible housing, Novak, on HANH’s behalf,\nrequested from HUD’s Boston office permission to exceed the 110 percent threshold.  (See\nDefs.’ Ex. 220 at 2.)  And the reply from HUD’s Boston office to HANH’s request for an\nexception rent to pay for O’Sullivan’s proposed construction stated that the field office could\nonly grant an exception up to 120 percent of the FMR, after which HANH would need to\nseek approval from the central office in Washington, DC.  (See Jt. Ex. 7 (citing 24 C.F.R.\n§ 982.503(c)(2)(ii)).)\nFinally, the evidence shows that HANH did not, on a programmatic or policy-wide\nbasis, deny mobility counseling to those who requested it, even during the claimed liability\nperiod of January 2006 through April 2008.  Although Miller testified that he “d[id] not\nbelieve” that during the liability period HANH’s Section 8 specialists performed a “mobility\ncounseling function for disabled individuals who asked for help moving” within the meaning\nof the RFP (Tr. Vol. I at 52–53), during this period HANH received and Miller approved a\nJune 2006 request from Lona Mitchell, who has arthritis, for “mobility counseling to assist\n[Mitchell’s] family in finding an appropriate unit” on the first floor of a building or in a\nbuilding with an elevator.  (See Defs.’ Ex. 227.)  In late 2007 Louis Eugene Morrison\nrequested a unit on the first floor of a building without stairs, as well as help filling out\nnecessary forms.  Miller approved what HANH construed as Morrison’s request for mobility\ncounseling services to help him locate a first-floor apartment as well as assistance in\ncompleting the relevant forms.  (See Defs.’ Ex. 228.)  Plaintiffs have proffered no evidence\nthat HANH approved these requests but failed to provide the services promised.\n57\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 58 of 84\nIn addition, each of the two subclasses are unsustainable.  Because Plaintiffs do not\nhave a private right of action to enforce 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3), the first subclass no longer\nhas legal relevance, since the Court certified that subclass on the assumption—which, as the\nCourt has now concluded, supra, was incorrect—that its members had privately enforceable\nlegal entitlement to an AAUL under § 8.28(a)(3).  Assuming HANH did not provide an\nappropriate AAUL, that failure is not actionable by these plaintiffs.\nInstead, as explained above, the regulation suggests what kind of accommodation\nwould be reasonable for HANH to make for Disabled Section 8 Households.  But neither the\nFHAA nor Section 504 itself specify that PHAs must provide AAULs to these households. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ action under Section 504 cannot proceed on the ground that they were\ninjured by their inability to obtain the list.  Instead, what the regulation reflects is that to\nmake the Section 8 Program accessible to Disabled Section 8 Households, HANH must,\nwhen issuing vouchers to a family it has newly accepted into the Section 8 Program or to a\nfamily that wishes to move,29 give those households any information about “available\naccessible units known to [HANH].”  24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) (emphasis added).30  If subclass\n29 Under HUD regulations, a PHA issues a voucher—the act that triggers its\nobligation under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) to provide “a current listing of available accessible\nunits known to the PHA”—only “[w]hen a family is selected” by the PHA to participate in\nthe Section 8 Program, or “when a participant family wants to move to another unit.”  24\nC.F.R. § 982.302(a).\n30 The other legal authorities cited in the definition of this subclass are not to the\ncontrary.  The cited regulation simply repeats the broad prohibition embodied in Section 504\nand the Fair Housing Act.  See 24 C.F.R. 100.204(a) (“It shall be unlawful for any person to\nrefuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when\nsuch accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity\nto use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas”).  The statute, 42\nU.S.C. § 3604(f), speaks broadly of discrimination “in the sale or rental” or “the terms,\n58\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 59 of 84\n(a) retains any viability, it must be based not on HANH’s failure to provide an up-to-date\nlisting of all accessible available privately-owned units in New Haven, but rather on HANH’s\nfailure to share with its Section 8 Disabled Households, when issuing them vouchers,\ninformation in HANH’s possession about available accessible units.\nPlaintiffs, however, did not adduce any evidence at trial that HANH had any\ninformation about available accessible units that it failed to share with Disabled Section 8\nHouseholds.  To the contrary, much of the evidence focused on HANH’s attempts to gather\nthe very information necessary to compile an AAUL.  Heinrichs designed a landlord survey\nand sent it out to approximately 1500 landlords in New Haven, but he left HANH just as the\nresults were coming back in the Spring of 2008, so Tanya DeLoatch, a Program Clerk  with\nHANH, completed the project in September 2008.  (Tr. Vol. VII at 1261–63 (Heinrichs); Tr.\nVol. II at 306, 316–17 (DeLoatch); Defs.’ Ex. 266 (blank survey form used by Heinrichs and\nDeLoatch).)  Woodie testified that she, too, sought information about accessible units from\nlandlords in order to compile a list of available accessible units at the same time that\nDeLoatch was compiling her list.  (Tr. Vol. IV at 849–50.)  Moreover, Woodie testified that\nshe put her name down on waiting lists for units in buildings that were accessible, and that\nwhen landlords called her for units in those buildings, she would place a disabled family in\nthe accessible unit.  (Tr. Vol. IV at 887.)  This evidence shows that to the extent HANH had\ninformation about accessible units, it obtained that information for the very purpose of\nconditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling” on the basis of disability, including\n“a refusal to make reasonable accommodations” when “necessary to afford such person equal\nopportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)(1), (2), (3)(B).  These\nauthorities are therefore no more specific than Section 504 itself.  Compare ibid., with 29\nU.S.C. § 794(a).\n59\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 60 of 84\nsharing it with, and benefitting, its Disabled Section 8 Households.  Therefore, subclass (a)\ncannot stand.\nThe second subclass cannot survive in its breadth.  “To prevail on a reasonable\naccommodation claim, plaintiffs must first provide the governmental entity an opportunity\nto accommodate them through the entity’s established procedures used to adjust the neutral\npolicy in question[, because] [a] governmental entity must know what a plaintiff seeks prior\nto incurring liability for failing to affirmatively grant a reasonable accommodation.” \nTsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 578–79.  As certified, the second subclass includes all Disabled\nSection 8 Households “that did not receive Mobility Counseling services, or offer thereof.” \nTaylor, 257 F.R.D. at 33 (stating subclasses certified).  But Tsombanidis teaches that a\nplaintiff does not have an actionable reasonable accommodation claim until she has\nrequested, but failed to obtain, a specific accommodation.  Therefore, subclass (b) cannot\nstand as-is.  Plaintiffs have not shown any basis on which an entity may be liable for denying\na specific reasonable accommodation to individuals who have not requested that specific\naccommodation because the entity has not offered that specific accommodation to its\nbeneficiaries.\nIn addition, these fundamental problems with commonality and typicality also point\nto a third problem with the certified class: numerosity.  Because at the class certification\nstage Plaintiffs argued that Defendants’ allegedly unlawful conduct applied programmatically\nto all Disabled Section 8 Households, the relevant number in determining numerosity was\nthe total number of Disabled Section 8 Households who receive Section 8 vouchers from\nHANH.  Relying on Defendants’ own statistics, the Court concluded that HANH served\napproximately 691 Disabled Section  8 Households.  This  number certainly reflected\n60\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 61 of 84\nsufficient numerosity to satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, since “[i]n the Second\nCircuit ‘numerosity is presumed at a level of 40 members.’”  Taylor, 257 F.R.D. at 29\n(quoting Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995)).\nBut the discussion above shows that this calculation was based on an inaccurate\npremise, that is, that the same conduct by Defendants applied to all Disabled Section 8\nHouseholds.  The facts in evidence simply do not support this contention.  Instead, Plaintiffs\nhave not shown the existence of any Disabled Section 8 Household to which HANH did not\nprovide information known to it about available accessible units.  It is also clear after\npresentation of the trial evidence that the relevant numerosity inquiry for subclass (b) is the\nnumber of Disabled Section 8 Households that requested, but did not receive, mobility\ncounseling, and Plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence as to what this number is.  To the\ncontrary, the evidence showed that only a small number of disabled voucher-holders asked\nfor mobility counseling.  On cross-examination Miller testified that at the time he declared\nan emergency in order to extend HANH’s contract with HOU to provide Rhonda Gaither\nwith mobility counseling, he knew of five instances in which Disabled Section 8 Households\nrequested but had not received mobility counseling.  (Tr. Vol. I at 113–18 (Miller).) \nSimilarly,  Heinrichs  testified  that  during  his  tenure  as  Reasonable  Accommodations\nCoordinator, which lasted from August 2007 through May 2008, he encountered only “three\nor four” cases of reasonable accommodation requests, all of which were approved.  (Tr. Vol.\nVII at 1405–06 (Heinrichs).)\n2. Conclusions of Law\nIn this case, the “factual [and] legal underpinnings of the plaintiffs’ successful class\ncertification motion [were] undermined once they [were] tested,” Visa Check, 192 F.R.D. at\n61\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 62 of 84\n89, and decertification is now “appropriate,” id.; see also In re Sumitomo Copper Litig., 262\nF.3d at 139, because it is clear that the certified class does not actually have three of “four\nfamiliar features,” McLaughlin v. Am. Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215, 222 (2d Cir. 2008), that a\nclass  must  have  to  be  certified:  it  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  numerosity,\ncommonality, or typicality, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  Therefore, the March 10, 2009 Class\nCertification Order is now vacated.31\n31 On August 19, 2009 the Court discussed with the parties Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nSanctions [Doc. # 193] for Defendants’ failure to timely provide in discovery e-mails to and\nfrom Maureen Novak between May and September 2007.  In their motion Plaintiffs argued\nthat the failure to timely produce the evidence warranted sanctions because it was done with\n“a culpable state of mind.”  See Residential Funding Corp. v. DeGeorge Fin. Corp., 306 F.3d\n99, 107 (2d Cir. 2002).  It is Plaintiffs’ burden to establish the propriety of an adverse\ninference.  Id.\nPlaintiffs argued that “Mr. Miller would like to shift blame on to Ms. Novak for much\nof what happened” (Tr. Vol. II at 292) and sought, as an adverse inference, that Defendants\n“be deemed to have intended to discriminate during the period covered by these emails”\n(Pls.’ Mot. at 2).  The Court determined to take the motion under advisement until after “the\nend of all of the evidence because the materiality of this may evaporate or not.”  (Tr. Vol. II\nat 293.)\nThe Court has now concluded that the is evidence shows that HANH did not, in fact,\nhave  a  policy  or  practice  of  denying  disabled  participants’  requests  for  reasonable\naccommodation on the basis of their disability.  Moreover, to the extent Novak, the\nReasonable Accommodations Coordinator until August 2007, believed that HANH did not\nhave the obligation to provide mobility counseling as a reasonable accommodation, she was\noverridden  by  her  direct  supervisor,  Miller,  who  believed  HANH  did  have  such an\nobligation.  (Tr. Vol. I at 103 (Miller).)  In addition, Plaintiffs’ counsel received a computer\ndisk containing these e-mails in the week before trial and the Court permitted counsel to\nexamine the emails after trial “to do some sort of random analysis of what you got” in that\nproduction in light of the Court’s inability “to come to a conclusion as to the disposition [of\nthe motion] without further knowledge” (Tr. Vol. II at 279, 293–94), but Plaintiffs have not\nshown that the e-mails were material.\nTherefore, the Court concludes that the materiality of the missing e-mails has\n“evaporate[d],” that Plaintiffs have not met their burden, and thus that no sanctions are\nappropriate.  For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions will be denied.\n62\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 63 of 84\nB. Claim of Rebecca Taylor\n1. Findings of Fact\nPlaintiff Rebecca Taylor passed away on March 23, 2009, during the pendency of this\nlitigation, and she is represented in this action by her cousin, who lives in Florida.  (Pls.’\nSuggestion of Death [Doc. # 120]; Pls.’ Am. Mot. to Substitute Rep. [Doc. # 197]; Order\ndated Aug. 26, 2009 [Doc. # 208] (granting amended motion to substitute).)  On May 7,\n2008, Taylor testified during a preliminary injunction hearing in this case that she had spina\nbifida, that she was confined to a wheelchair, and that she “ha[d] a hard time getting\naround.”  (Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. [Doc. # 43] at 30–31.)  Taylor lived with her 25-\nyear-old son and 15-year-old daughter (id. at 30), and there is no evidence that either her\nson or daughter are mobility-impaired.32\nAt that time, Taylor lived in an apartment at 205 Dover Street,33 a building that was\nnot wheelchair-accessible because there were three steps out front.  To get out of the house,\nshe would “usually sit on the steps and pull [her] wheelchair down” after her.  (Id. at 30, 50.) \nIn early 2008 Bank of America initiated a foreclosure action against her landlord (3d Am.\nCompl. at ¶ 16; Defs.’ Am. Answer [Doc. # 168] at ¶ 16), a fact of which Taylor became\naware when she saw mail intended for her landlord but addressed to her (Tr. of 5/7/08\nPrelim. Inj. Hrg. at 38).  Taylor had had a previous experience having her home foreclosed\n32 According to Taylor, her son has attention-deficit disorder.  (Tr. of Prelim. Inj.\nHrg. at 37.)\n33 Taylor testified that for the most recent year she had lived on the first floor, and\nfor the four years before that she lived on the second floor of a neighboring building, 207\nDover Street.  (Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 50.)\n63\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 64 of 84\nupon—in  2003  she  was  left  homeless  after  a  bank  had  foreclosed  on  her  previous\nlandlord—and wanted to avoid a similar experience.  (Id. at 38–40.)\nTaylor testified that during her recertification interview with her Section 8 Specialist,\nDenise Senior, she personally asked Senior for help searching for an accessible apartment,\nin response to which Senior said that it was Taylor’s responsibility to find a new unit.  (Id.\nat 41, 42.)  According to Taylor, Senior did not discuss Taylor’s right to request a reasonable\naccommodation (id. at 43–47), but Taylor acknowledged receiving notice of her right to seek\na reasonable accommodation on July 7, 2006 and May 4, 2007 (Jt. Ex. 32; Defs.’ Ex. 208).\nIt is unclear when Taylor first asked Senior for assistance.  Taylor testified that the\nmeeting took place earlier in 2008.  However, HANH’s file for Taylor, which contains\ndocuments dated as early as July 2006 and as late as July 2008,34 contains no notes of any\n34 On September 30, 2009, Plaintiffs moved for an adverse inference against Miller\nand DuBois–Walton for what they characterized as Defendants’ “fail[ure] to preserve\nunquestionably relevant documents,” that is, HANH’s files for Taylor covering the time span\n2006 through April 22, 2008, which files Plaintiffs sought by subpoena dated September 3,\n2009.  (Pls.’ Mot. Adverse Inference [Doc. # 227] at 1, 2.)  Plaintiffs sought as sanctions an\nadverse inference that Miller and DuBois–Walton intended to discriminate against disabled\nSection 8 participants.  (Id. at 2.)  One week later, on October 7, 2009, Defendants produced\nHANH’s file for Taylor as well as files of three other Section 8 participants.  An exhibit to\nPlaintiffs’  motion suggests that Defendants had produced this file to Plaintiffs before\nPlaintiffs moved for an adverse inference.  (See id. at Ex. B (letter from Defendants’ counsel\nthat is identical, except for date, to the letter accompanying Defendants’ production to the\nCourt).)  In all, these files total over 1,000 pages.  (See Jt. Ex. 32 (Taylor); Jt. Ex. 33 (Ida\nWilson); Pls.’ Ex. 58 (Dorothy Stokes–Hall); Pls.’ Ex. 59 (Rhonda Gaither).)  \nAs described in the text, HANH’s file for Taylor covers the time-span addressed by\nPlaintiffs’ motion, including the time-span during which Taylor testified that she made a\nrequest for mobility counseling.  (See generally Jt. Ex. 32.)  The Court has examined this\nfile—which totals approximately 500 pages—and has found no record of any request by\nTaylor for mobility counseling.  In light of the Court’s review of Defendants’ October 7, 2009\nproduction of Taylor’s file, Plaintiffs’ motion for an adverse inference is moot, and will be\ndenied as such.\n64\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 65 of 84\nmeeting between Senior and Taylor in early 2008 (see generally Jt. Ex. 3235), Taylor testified\nthat she never saw Senior in person except at the recertification meetings (Tr. of 5/7/08\nPrelim. Inj. Hrg. at 36–37), and Senior was on a medical leave of absence from HANH\nbetween March and September 2008 (Tr. Vol. VIII at 132).  HANH’s file for Taylor also\ncontains no indication that she requested mobility counseling or any other reasonable\naccommodation from Senior, the spreadsheet in which Heinrichs tracked reasonable\naccommodation requests through February 20, 2008 contains no entry for any request for\nmobility counseling or other reasonable accommodation by Taylor (see Pls.’ Ex. 41f), and\nHeinrichs testified that he did not receive any such request from Taylor (Tr. Vol. VII at\n1275–76) even though, according to Senior, any request for a reasonable accommodation\nwould be routed to the Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator (Tr. Vol. VIII at 126, 130). \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c), Defendants seek sanctions against\nPlaintiffs for their having filed the Motion for an Adverse Inference.  (Defs.’ Mot. Sanctions\n[Doc. # 232].)  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ assertion that Joint Ex. 32 “did not state\ninformation as to whether or not Ms. Taylor had been recertified in May of 2007 or February\nof 2008” is incorrect, because “the truth of the matter is that Joint Exhibit 32 does establish\nthat Ms. Taylor had her recertification done on May 4, 2007 at HANH.”  (Id. at 1–2.)  As the\nCourt’s discussion reflects, Joint Exhibit 32 does not conclusively establish anything\nregarding when during the calendar year 2007 Taylor was recertified, and does not\nconclusively establish that the recertification was done on May 4, 2007.  Although Taylor did\nsign a number of forms on May 4, 2007 related to her recertification, her file also shows that\nHANH had, the previous year, sent her a number of forms to complete in anticipation of her\nrecertification, and it also indicates that Senior performed Taylor’s recertification on August\n1, 2007.  Taylor’s May 4, 2007 signatures therefore do not conclusively establish anything\nrelated to the timing of her 2007 recertification interview.  Defendants’ motion will be\ndenied.\n35 Defendants produced this exhibit without pagination, bates-stamping, or other\nindication of page order.  Therefore, the Court cannot cite precisely to the pages on which\nit relies.\n65\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 66 of 84\nMoreover, Taylor’s file indicates that HANH conducted her annual recertification in August\nof each year—not in the first few months of the year.  Senior conducted Taylor’s 2007 annual\nrecertification on August 1, 2007, and consistent with a conclusion that Taylor’s annual\nrecertification was in August, Taylor submitted a number of forms and documents in July\n2006 in anticipation for a recertification planned for August 2006.  (See Jt. Ex. 32.)36\nThe Court concludes that Taylor’s first request was in late February or early March\n2008 in light of Taylor’s testimony that she was motivated to request assistance because of\nthe potential foreclosure, which she learned about in early 2008: she testified that she asked\nSenior for assistance finding another apartment “[b]ecause the landlord is going to lose the\napartment,” which Taylor determined was the case because the mail made it “seem[] like he\nwas being sued . . . because he[ was] not paying his mortgage” and “[was] being foreclosed\non.”  (Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 37–38.)  In late February or early March 2008, Taylor\ncalled Senior and left her a voicemail asking for mobility counseling, to which she did not\nreceive any response.37  On March 14, 2008, Taylor wrote a letter to Senior asking Senior or\n36  Having  been  shown  Taylor’s  May  4,  2007  acknowledgement  of  receipt  of\nnotification of her right to seek a reasonable accommodation, Woodie testified that Section\n8  participants  signed  these  forms  during  their  annual  recertifications,  and  therefore\nsurmised that Taylor’s annual recertification “would have been” in May.  (Tr. Vol. IV at 875.) \nEven if the recertification was in May, Taylor filed her motion for a preliminary injunction\nin April, the month before the date of what would have been her 2008 recertification.\n37 Taylor’s testimony is unclear and inconsistent as to when she first asked Senior for\nassistance finding a new apartment.  She testified that asked Senior in person at her most\nrecent recertification, and that aside from her recertification meetings she never saw Senior. \n(Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 36.)  She also testified that she could not remember when\nshe last met with Senior, but she thought it was earlier in 2008.  (E.g., id. at 36–37.)  Taylor’s\nmost recent recertification prior to the preliminary injunction hearing was on August 1,\n2007.  (See Jt. Ex. 32.)  Taylor also testified that she asked for assistance moving because she\nwas concerned about the foreclosure action against her landlord.  (Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj.\n66\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 67 of 84\nHANH to help her find “an apartment with a ramp or no stairs” because of her disability. \nCounsel for Taylor faxed this letter to HANH the same day.  (March 14, 2008 Letter from\nTaylor to Senior, Ex. C to Compl. [Doc. # 3]; Fax Verification Form, Ex. 17 to Pls.’ Mot.\nPrelim. Inj. [Doc. # 12].)38  In the meantime, Taylor conducted her search by examining\nHrg. at .)  She did not learn about the foreclosure until the first few months of 2008.  Taylor\nalso averred that “[d]uring my last recertification, [Senior] and I talked about my landlord’s\n[foreclosure]  problem”  after  she  learned  that  her  landlord  was  being  sued  in  strict\nforeclosure.  (See Taylor Aff. Dated April 10, 2008, Ex. 4 to Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Doc. # 12]\nat ¶¶ 12–13.)\nBank of America filed the foreclosure action against Taylor’s landlord on February\n14, 2008 in New Haven Superior Court.  (See Docket Report for Case No. NNH-CV-08-\n5017975-S, Ex. D to Compl. [Doc. # 3].)  At the preliminary injunction hearing, counsel for\nTaylor represented that “Taylor has requested a reasonable accommodation three times in\nthree different ways: First, she requested it in person at the beginning of this year to her\nworker, [Senior], and that was a verbal request; second, she . . . attempted to request by\ntelephone, [but] was not able to get [Senior] by telephone; third, she faxed [a] written\nrequest for accommodation [on March 14, 2008].”  (Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 3.) \nBoth Taylor’s March 14, 2008 letter and her April 10, 2008 affidavit suggest that the letter\nwas a follow-up to a voicemail that Taylor had recently left for Senior, and therefore close\nin time.  (See March 14, 2008 Letter from Taylor to Senior, Ex. C to Compl.; Taylor Aff. at\n¶ 15.)\nThe  Court  concludes  from  this  combination  of  Taylor’s  testimony  and\ndocumentation that Taylor first requested mobility counseling from Senior by voicemail in\nlate February or early March 2008, and thereafter attempted to fax a request to Senior on\nMarch 14, 2008.  In light of Taylor’s difficulty dating her requests or recalling the details of\nher oral request to Senior, and the fact that there is no evidence that Taylor had any meeting\nwith Senior after her August 1, 2007 recertification, which meeting predated the foreclosure\naction by more than six months, the Court cannot identify the date—a material fact—on\nwhich Taylor orally asked Senior for mobility counseling.  Absent this material fact, the\nCourt cannot, in considering Taylor’s claim, rely on Taylor’s testimony that she orally\nrequested mobility counseling from Senior.\n38 Defendants claim that the number to which counsel faxed the letter was out of date\nand therefore neither Senior nor anyone else on HANH’s Section 8 staff received Taylor’s\nrequest.  (See, e.g., Tr. Vol. VII at 1276 (Heinrichs).)  The number to which counsel faxed the\nletter is located on a reasonable accommodation form produced by HANH and used as\n67\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 68 of 84\napartment listings provided by HANH and in the newspaper; the list she got from HANH\ndid not list which apartments were accessible.  (Tr. of 5/7/08 Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 32–35, 40,\n50.)  She testified that she would call landlords, but they demurred because she was disabled\nand, she explained, they “don’t want to be responsible if something happens . . . if they don’t\nhave the correct things for a handicapped person, like a ramp or whatever.”39  Taylor testified\nthat she would call landlords rather than visit units because it was difficult for her to leave\nher house and travel to see the units.  (Id. at 35.)\nTaylor filed suit less than a month after faxing the letter, and on April 22, 2008 she\nmoved  for  a  preliminary  injunction  requiring  HANH  to  provide  her  with  mobility\ncounseling and find her a new, accessible apartment.  (See Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj.)  The Court\napproved and adopted the parties’ joint stipulated order for preliminary injunctive relief,\nWoodie provided Taylor mobility counseling and found her an accessible apartment in New\nHaven, Taylor signed a lease for a new apartment on July 22, 2008, and the lease term for the\nnew apartment began on August 1, 2008.  (See Proposed Stip. [Doc. # 24]; Order dated May\n27, 2008 [Doc. # 27]; Jt. Ex. 32.)  Plaintiffs agree that HANH provided Taylor with mobility\ncounseling after she filed suit.  (See, e.g., Tr. Vol. IV at 852–53; 3d Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 25–26.)\nrecently as January 2006.  That form indicated that Maureen Novak, Heinrichs’s predecessor\nas HANH’s former Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator, received faxes sent to that\nnumber.  (See, e.g., Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 2.)  Absent evidence that Defendants ceased using the\nnumber altogether, informed Taylor (or anyone) of the change in fax number, or took steps\nto retract the form listing the outdated number, the Court concludes that the fax was\nreceived somewhere within the HANH bureaucracy.\n39 If the landlords did discriminate against her on the basis of her disability, their\nactions may constitute violations of the FHA and FHAA.  However, those landlords are not\nnamed in this action, and Defendants may not be held liable for others’ unlawful conduct.\n68\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 69 of 84\n2. Conclusions of Law\nPlaintiffs assert that Taylor was constructively denied a reasonable accommodation\nby HANH’s failure to respond to her request for mobility counseling before she filed suit. \nPlaintiffs rely on three cases for the proposition that a delay can become a denial.  Groome\nRes. Ltd., L.L.C. v. Parish of Jefferson, 234 F.3d 192, 199 (5th Cir. 2000); Langlois, 207 F.3d\nat 48; Matyasovszky v. Hous. Auth. of the City of Bridgeport, 226 F.R.D. 35, 45–46 (D. Conn.\n2005).  These cases do not support Plaintiffs’ argument.  In Matyasovszky, a court in this\nDistrict certified a class of disabled persons eligible for low-income public housing in\nBridgeport, members of which claimed that the housing authority’s designation of certain\nhousing units as only for elderly participants constituted discrimination on the basis of\ndisability.  226 F.R.D. at 36–38.  The case did not address the delay-as-denial issue at all.  In\nLanglois, the First Circuit addressed a claim that PHAs unlawfully discriminated in favor of\nSection 8 applicants within their jurisdiction.  Those outside the jurisdictions claimed that\nalthough their applications were not technically denied, as a practical matter the applications\nwould rarely be granted since most openings would be given to in-jurisdiction applicants. \n207 F.3d at 46–47.  The First Circuit recited the PHAs’ argument that the “residency\npreference does not permanently deny vouchers to any qualified person” but instead “merely\ndelays them,” and summarily rejected it, holding instead that “given the limits on funding,\nthe delays apparently stretch into years, so delay may for practical purposes be the equivalent\nof denial.”  Id. at 48.  Finally, in Groome the Fifth Circuit upheld a district court’s\ndetermination that a zoning board’s delay in acting on an application for a variance from\nzoning laws to be able to operate a group home for disabled patients constituted a denial. \n234 F.3d at 196, 199.  Before the plaintiffs filed suit in that case, their “full and complete\n69\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 70 of 84\napplication  had  been  submitted  and  reviewed,”  and  had  been  pending for  95  days,\nnotwithstanding the zoning board’s target of responding to applications within 45 days, the\n“officials in charge of the application could not provide any timetable or plan for acting on\nthe application,” the fact that the plaintiff’s ability to close on a house it had purchased was\ncontingent on obtaining a variance, and the fact that the application had already been\nunofficial approved.  Id. at 199 & n.7.  The defendant did not challenge on appeal the district\ncourt’s conclusion that its delay constituted a denial.\nThe Court does not intend to cast doubt on the proposition that delay may eventually\nbecome denial.  Cf.  United Techs. Corp. v. Am. Home Assur. Co., 118 F. Supp. 2d 181, 188\n(D. Conn. 2000) (suggesting that an insurer may engage in a “procedural[ly] unfair\npractice[]” by failing to respond to insurance claims within a reasonable time).  However,\nthe Court cannot conclude from the evidence in this case that HANH’s delay in responding\nto Taylor’s request for a reasonable accommodation constituted a denial.  Unlike the\ndefendants in Langlois, where the delay lasted “years,” HANH’s delay in this case was\napproximately two months, only one of which predated Taylor’s filing suit.  In addition to\nthe fact that Taylor’s application was pending for one-third less time than the plaintiff’s\napplication in Groome, HANH’s reasonable accommodation staff had not received or\nreviewed Taylor’s letter, let alone unofficially approved it and left her waiting for what was\nessentially a ministerial act.\nIn addition, there is no evidence that HANH delayed acting on Taylor’s application\nin order to prevent her from moving, or with any motive to prevent a disabled Section 8\nparticipant from obtaining housing.  If, as the evidence suggests, HANH failed to respond\nto Taylor’s request because of bureaucratic incompetence, that fact—unlike in Groome,\n70\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 71 of 84\nwhere the zoning board’s delay “demonstrated an attempt to frustrate [the plaintiff’s]\npurchase and operation of a group home,” 234 F.3d at 199 n.7—does not show violations of\nSection 504 or the FHAA, which are “addressed to ‘rules . . . that hurt [people with\ndisabilities] by reason of their handicap, rather than that hurt them solely by virtue of what\nthey have in common with other people.’”  Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 276 (quoting Good\nShepherd Manor Found., Inc. v. City of Momence, 323 F.3d 557, 561 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(emphasis in Good Shepherd)).\nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not shown that HANH\ndenied Taylor a reasonable accommodation by failing to respond to her request for mobility\ncounseling or search assistance in the two months between when she first requested it and\nthe date she moved for a preliminary injunction.  In addition, because HANH did not deny\nTaylor  her  request,  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  that  Taylor  was  subjected  to  intentional\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability in violation of the FHA or FHAA.\nC. Claims of Karl Hunter\n1. Findings of Fact\nKarl Hunter is a 52-year-old man confined to a wheelchair who has lived in\nFellowship Place, on the corner of Dwight Street and Whalley Avenue in New Haven, since\n2005.  (Hunter Aff., Defs.’ Ex. 257, at ¶¶ 1–3; Tr. Vol. VIII at 66, 67, 81 (Hunter).)  Hunter\nresides there under a project-based voucher administered by HANH.  (Id. at 65–66; see also\nTr. Vol. IV at 868 (Woodie).)  He does not like living there, since that area is dangerous, and\nhe has been mugged.  (Tr. Vol. VIII at 67–68.)  In addition, his apartment has a kitchen area\nwith a microwave and a sink, but no stove.  (Id. at 66.)  Hunter testified that there came a\ntime when he sought help moving from Kristen Barber, a disability advocate with the City\n71\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 72 of 84\nof New Haven, who advised him to contact HANH.  He could not recall when that was.  In\nan affidavit dated August 4, 2008, he averred that until earlier that month, when Barber told\nhim, he did not know that HANH could help him search for apartments (Hunter Aff. at ¶ 9),\nbut he later testified that he did not learn until his June 2, 2009 deposition that he could\nobtain assistance moving—mobility counseling—from HANH (Tr. Vol. VIII at 74).  The\ndocuments in evidence show that Hunter received information about his right to request\nreasonable accommodations on June 13, 2007 and again on November 10, 2008.  (Defs.’ Exs.\n202, 206.)\nThe documents in evidence show that Hunter sought reasonable accommodations\nfrom HANH on December 8, 2008, at which time he requested, on a HANH reasonable\naccommodations form, a barrier-free apartment, accommodation for a live-in attendant, and\nmobility counseling.  (Pls.’ Ex. 38 at 4.)  Hunter testified that he did not personally complete\nthe form, but instead it was filled out by staff at Fellowship Place.  (Tr. Vol. VIII at 69–70.) \nHe stated that he did not want a live-in aide, but that the Fellowship Place staff wanted him\nto request one anyway.  (Id. at 96.)\nThree weeks later, on December 29, 2008, Woodie sent Hunter a letter reciting his\nthree reasonable accommodation requests, notifying him that HANH was “currently unable\nto process [his] application because it was incomplete,” sending him his application, and\nasking him to “complete the highlighted sections.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 38 at 6; Defs.’ Ex. 205.)  While\nHunter thought Woodie’s request was redundant since it sought information already within\nHANH’s possession or knowledge such as his birth certificate and social security number\n(Tr. Vol. VIII at 71), Woodie testified that she pulled Hunter’s HANH files to gather what\ninformation HANH already had about Hunter, and in her letter she asked Hunter for\n72\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 73 of 84\ninformation about his medical treatment so she could verify with Hunter’s physician\nHunter’s medical need for a live-in aide (Tr. Vol. IV at 872–74), which was consistent with\nher approach to other requests requiring medical verification.  When HANH received this\ninformation in calendar year 2009, Woodie sent a verification form to Hunter’s physician. \n(Id.)\n2. Conclusions of Law\nEven if an apartment without a stove does not comply with the housing quality\nstandards set by HUD regulation,40 that fact would not show any violation of Section 504 or\nthe FHAA, since these statutes are “addressed to ‘rules . . . that hurt [people with disabilities]\nby reason of their handicap, rather than that hurt them solely by virtue of what they have in\ncommon with other people.’”  Henrietta D., 331 F.3d at 276 (quoting Good Shepherd, 323\nF.3d at 561).\nHunter’s testimony regarding when he learned of his right to seek a reasonable\naccommodation was internally inconsistent, and it was also inconsistent with his signed\nacknowledgement that he received information about this right eighteen months before he\nfirst requested any reasonable accommodation.  The evidence further shows that after\nreceiving Hunter’s request, Woodie promptly followed up with him—within three weeks—to\nconfirm Hunter’s need for a live-in aide, which need would affect the size of voucher to\nwhich  Hunter  would  be  entitled.    Liability  for  failure  to  provide  a  reasonable\naccommodation cannot attach until the defendant has received and denied a request for\n40 See 24 C.F.R. § 982.401(c)(2)(i) (“[a] microwave may be substituted for an owner-\nsupplied oven and stove or range if the tenant agrees and microwave ovens are furnished\ninstead of an oven and stove or range to both subsidized and unsubsidized tenants in the\nbuilding or premises” (emphases added)).\n73\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 74 of 84\nreasonable accommodation.  Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d at 578–79.  Here, there is no evidence\nthat HANH has denied Hunter’s request for a reasonable accommodation, and indeed the\nevidence indicates that HANH has been working to approve Hunter’s request and provide\nthe accommodations.  Therefore, Defendants cannot be liable to Hunter under the FHAA\nor Section 504.\nIn addition, because Hunter has not shown that he “sought and was qualified for an\napartment,” Cabrera, 24 F.3d at 381, or that he “was denied the opportunity to rent [an]\napartment,” id., he cannot make out an intentional-discrimination claim against HANH.\nD. Claim of Heiwa Salovitz\n1. Findings of Fact\nHeiwa Salovitz, a man with cerebral palsy who is confined to a wheelchair, has been\na Section 8 participant since July 2001.  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 2; Tr. Vol. V at 1045 (Salovitz).) \nWhen he became a Section 8 participant, he attended an orientation run by HANH, but he\ndid not learn of his right to request an exception rent, search assistance, mobility counseling,\nor utility allowances.  (Id. at 1047.)  He testified that he did not learn about these possible\naccommodations  at  his  recertifications,  and  learned  about  “these  particular  items”\n“recently,” when in 2007 he began serving on New Haven’s Commission for Persons with\nDisabilities.  (Id. at 1048–49.)  In 2003 Salovitz moved into the Residences at Ninth Square. \nAlthough he did not learn the term “exception rent” until later (id. at 1088), the rent at this\nbuilding was above the FMR published annually by HUD, so to permit its Section 8 Program\nparticipants to live there HANH had to approve exception rents (e.g., Tr. Vol. IV at 885–86\n(Woodie)).\n74\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 75 of 84\nSalovitz  also  testified,  however,  that  he  was  informed  annually,  during  his\nrecertification, of his right to request a reasonable accommodation.  (Id. at 1081, 1120.)  In\nlate 2005, Salovitz completed a request for a  reasonable accommodation on a HANH form\nthat listed a revision date of January 2004.41  In his 2005 request, Salovitz represented as\nfollows:\nCurrently I have a reasonable accommodation for 2 bedrooms.  Originally I\nhad a reasonable accommodation because I have a live-in aide.  However, I\nhave 2 powerchairs, a manual wheelchair, and a shower chair and there is not\nenough room for the live in aid[e] in my 2 bedroom unit.  I am therefore\nrequesting a voucher for a three bedroom, so I will have room for both my\nequipment and the live in aide.\n(Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 1.)  Salovitz’s physician confirmed on January 10, 2006 that Salovitz suffers\nfrom cerebral palsy and required a wheelchair, a permanent live-in aide, and a three-\nbedroom apartment to store his equipment.  (Id. at 2.)  Salovitz testified that HANH granted\nthe request.  (Tr. Vol. V at 1078–79.)\nSalovitz filed another reasonable accommodation request on April 30, 2008 for “a\nhigher utility allowance” given his high electricity usage in charging batteries for his powered\nwheelchairs.  (Id. at 15; see also Tr. Vol. V at 1082–86.)  Two months later, on July 1, 2008,\nWoodie e-mailed Salovitz to inform him that she needed additional information regarding\nhis batteries.  (Cf. Tr. Vol. IV at 962 (Woodie) (explaining, in the context of Oko’s request,\nwhy specific verification of battery type and usage is required).)  Salovitz then filed a CHRO\n41 The form provided the following “type[s] of accommodation” from which a\nrequester could choose: “physical modification to a unit”; “barrier-free unit (wheelchair\naccessible)”; “unit adapted for sensory impairments”; “[a]ssignment of a reserved parking\nspace”;  “provision  of  the  property  lease  or  program  regulations”;  “[l]ive  in  [a]ide”;\n“[h]ousekeeping [s]tandard”; and “[o]ther.”  Salovitz determined that his request fell under\nthe “[o]ther” category.  (See Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 1 (emphasis in original).)\n75\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 76 of 84\ncomplaint against HANH on July 18, 2008, alleging that HANH’s failure to act on his request\nconstituted discrimination on the basis of disability.   (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 3–4 (Salovitz’s CHRO\ncomplaint); see also id. at 5–9 (HANH’s response to CHRO).)  Woodie and Salovitz\nscheduled a home visit on August 11, 2008, but Woodie did not appear.  (Id. at 18 (Salovitz\nletter).)  HANH’s Reasonable Accommodations Committee met and considered Salovitz’s\nrequest on September 4, 2008, and on September 8th, DuBois–Walton informed Salovitz by\nletter that HANH had “approved an increase of $80.00 a month” in his utility allowance, and\nalso “offer[ed] [him] Mobility Counseling which will include assisting [him] in [his] search\nfor a new housing unit.”  (Id. at 20.)  According to Salovitz, DuBois–Walton’s letter “was the\nend of this particular issue” as far as he was concerned.  (Tr. Vol. V at 1086.)\nSalovitz had lived in the Residences at Ninth Square for six years, from May 2003\nthrough May 2009, when there was a fire in his apartment and he was forced to relocate. \n(See id. at 35–37; see also Tr. Vol. V at 1087, 1099–1100.)  He requested mobility counseling\nfrom HANH to assist him in his move.  Salovitz testified that the mobility counseling, which\nhad been provided by Woodie and then Jennifer DeJesus, was “successful.”  He needed to\nmove immediately, and HANH paid for Salovitz to stay at a hotel while DeJesus searched for\napartments for him.  HANH helped Salovitz travel around to, and view, different apartments\nduring this search; with HANH’s help Salovitz found a new apartment in three weeks.  (Tr.\nVol. V at 1054, 1103–05.)42  With DeJesus’s assistance, Salovitz visited the new unit he would\neventually lease, and saw that it was a barrier-free, wheelchair-accessible unit that lacked\ngrab-bars in the bathroom.  (Id. at 1106.)\n42 Salovitz’s current address is sealed.  (Order dated Aug. 26, 2009 [Doc. # 207].)\n76\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 77 of 84\nOn May 27, 2009, HANH approved a monthly housing assistance payment to\nSalovitz’s landlord of $1210.  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 30.)  According to both Salovitz’s testimony and\ndocuments, the landlord promised both Salovitz and DeJesus to make the unit fully\naccessible.  DeJesus and Salovitz discussed with the landlord’s agent Salovitz’s need for grab-\nbars,43 and the agent represented to them that the landlord would install grab-bars in the\nbathroom at no cost to him or to HANH.  (See id. at 1055–57, 1106–07; see also Pls.’ Ex. 39\nat 26–29 (e-mails among Salovitz, DeJesus, and the new unit’s property manager).) \nHowever, after Salovitz signed the lease and picked up his keys—and, presumably, after\nHANH executed a HAP contract with the landlord—Salovitz requested that the landlord\ninstall the grab-bars, but the landlord informed Salovitz that he would have to pay for the\ninstallation by a contractor of his choice.  (Tr. Vol. V at 1057–61; Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 26–29,\n31–34.)  The landlord repeated this position on August 10, 2009.  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 38.)  A\ncontractor estimated the installation cost at $1,046.60.  (Id. at 25.)\nSalovitz turned to HANH for assistance.  According to Salovitz, DeJesus advocated\non his behalf with the landlord, but the landlord refused to pay for the installation.  (Tr. Vol.\nV at 1062–63.)  On July 7, 2009 Salovitz e-mailed DeJesus to ask if HANH could approve an\nexception rent to pay for the grab-bars, but DeJesus replied two hours later that “HANH has\nno control over” any agreement between Salovitz and his new landlord, that she had “no\nluck” in her negotiation with his landlord, and that the issue “is something that is out of my\nhands.”  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 26.)\n43 Salovitz testified at trial about the substantial difficulties, disruptions, and distress\nhe suffers daily as a result of not having grab-bars to make the bathroom safely accessible to\nhim.  (See, e.g., Tr. Vol. V at 1050–53, 1122–23.)\n77\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 78 of 84\nMiller testified, in connection with his handling of the Gaither matter, that HANH\nhad a policy of not providing funds to modify privately-owned units.  (See Tr. Vol. I at\n77–78, 266–68 (concluding that such a policy would be a fundamental alteration to the\nprogram).)  Rather than provide funds for individual modifications of privately-owned units\nattached to which were one-year HAP contracts that were not guaranteed to be renewed,\nMiller  sought  to  use  “other  options,”  including  “a  loan program,”  to  make  capital-\nimprovement loans to landlords, along the lines of a program he had operated while working\nat the New York City housing authority.  (Id. at 268.)  The record is silent on whether\nHANH ever implemented a loan program.\n2. Conclusions of Law\nSalovitz’s claim is that DeJesus’s rejection of his request for an exception rent to pay\nfor the grab-bars constitutes HANH’s failure to provide a reasonable accommodation, in\nviolation of Section 504 and the FHAA.  He may also be claiming that this failure constitutes\nintentional discrimination under the FHAA.  The facts show that Defendants have neither\nintentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his disability, nor failed to provide\nhim a reasonable accommodation.44\n44 Salovitz and his counsel have considered whether, in refusing Salovitz’s request to\ninstall the grab-bars, the landlord has violated Section 504 or the FHAA.  In fact, Salovitz’s\ncounsel informed HANH on June 4, 2009 that “Salovitz plans to take legal action against [his\nlandlord], but this is unlikely to produce any solution in the short term.”  (Defs.’ Ex. 212 at\n3.)  Nonetheless, on August 21, 2009, Salovitz testified that he “would prefer not to” sue his\nlandlord to force them to install the grab-bars, and instead “to solve this in an amicable way”\nwith the landlord because he recently moved in to the unit.  (Tr. Vol. V at 1065; accord id.\nat 1112–13.)  In any event, even if the landlord’s actions violated Section 504 or the FHAA,\nthe landlord is not a party in this litigation, and the Defendants in this action cannot be held\nliable for others’ unlawful conduct.  If Plaintiffs were to contend otherwise, they would be\n“asking [HANH], the public entity responsible for [the Section 8 Program,] to resolve a\n78\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 79 of 84\nFirst,  HANH’s  refusal  does  not  constitute  a  failure  to  provide  a  reasonable\naccommodation.  As explained above, the “benefit” of Section 8 does not include housing,\nor a guarantee that a participant will find suitable housing.  While HANH administers the\nthe LIPH program—in which it does provide housing directly to participants—Salovitz\ntestified that he preferred participating in the Section 8 Program because that program\n“allows [him] to have choice and options within the community that [he] choose[s].”  (Tr.\nVol. V at 1046–47).  Even if HANH had the power to control private landlords and force or\ncoerce them to provide accessibility features promised but not provided, the “benefit” of the\nSection 8 Program does not include a guarantee of suitable housing, or any housing\nwhatsoever, and does not include the funding of modifications to units by private landlords. \n“A plain reading of HUD regulations governing Section 8 programs shows that funding\nmodifications to privately-owned units is not a service offered by [Section 8] Programs.” \nLiberty Res., 528 F. Supp. 2d at 569.\nThe benefit of the Section 8 Program for its participants is that the program provides\nthem financial assistance to afford units available in the private market.  It is undisputed that\nHANH helped Salovitz find a unit that was available on the private market, and now\nprovides him financial assistance to afford the monthly rent for that unit.  Therefore, Salovitz\nhas not been denied access to the benefit of the Section 8 Program, and he cannot make out\na claim under Section 504 or the reasonable-accommodation theory of the FHAA.\nSecond,  Plaintiffs  have  not  sustained  their  burden  to  show  that  Defendants\nintentionally discriminated against Salovitz on the basis of disability.  To the contrary,\ndifficulty experienced  by disabled people that  is the result  of the actions of private\nindividuals.”  Liberty Res., 528 F. Supp. 2d at 569.\n79\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 80 of 84\nHANH approved Salovitz’s previous two reasonable accommodation requests and provided\nhim mobility counseling—by hosting Salovitz in a hotel, searching for accessible units for\nhim, and helping him travel around with DeJesus to look at units—and contacted Salovitz’s\nlandlord to request that it provide grab-bars, as Salovitz and DeJesus had understood the\nlandlord to have promised.  Moreover, the evidence suggests that HANH had already\nprovided Salovitz with an exception rent to be able to afford to live in the unit.45  This\n“specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision,” Tsombanidis, 352 F.3d\nat 579, of DeJesus’s refusal to provide an exception rent to pay to install the grab-bars weighs\nagainst any conclusion that the refusal was based on DeJesus’s discrimination against\nSalovitz on the basis of his disability.  Moreover, Plaintiffs adduced no evidence that\nHANH’s “normal procedural sequences,” id., included the offer or approval of an exception\nrent to pay for modifications to privately-owned units for which a disabled Section 8\nparticipant had a one-year lease, or that the “normal substantive criteria,” id., that HANH\napplied when determined whether to provide an exception rent (or a Section 8 voucher\nitself) involved modification of privately-owned units—or that HANH departed from these\nsequences and criteria in refusing Salovitz’s request.46\n45 In his request for a reasonable accommodation from his landlord, Salovitz\nrepresented that he lived alone.  (Pls.’ Ex. 39 at 31.)  If Salovitz had a two-bedroom voucher\n(cf. id. at 1 (stating he had a two-bedroom voucher)), the HUD-determined fair market rent\nwas $1101 per month.  See 73 Fed. Reg. 56638, 56649 (Sept. 29, 2008).  The HUD-\ndetermined fair market rent for a one-bedroom unit was $915 per month.  Id.  The $1210\nper month approved by HANH represents 110 percent of the fair market rent for a two-\nbedroom unit, or 132 percent of the fair market rent for a one-bedroom unit.  The record\ndoes not contain any rent reasonable calculation for Salovitz’s current unit.\n46 The evidence also does not show that Salovitz has made out a prima facie case\nunder the FHA, since there is no evidence that he “was denied the opportunity to rent [an]\n80\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 81 of 84\nMiller testified that HANH had a blanket policy of not funding any modifications of\nprivately-owned units, regardless of who asked for such funding.  (Tr. Vol. I at 77–78; Tr.\nVol. IV at 719–20.)  Whether or not this policy is countenanced by Section 8, there is no\nevidence that HANH applied it in a discriminatory manner, and Plaintiffs may not rely on\nSection 504 or the FHAA to “challenge . . . the scope of a non-discriminatory program,” Am.\nCouncil of the Blind, 525 F.3d at 1268.47\nMoreover, in Count Four, Plaintiffs claim that to make the Section 8 Program’s\nbenefits equally accessible to participants with disabilities, HANH must fund modifications\nto privately-owned units.  Because the provision of any privately-owned housing, let alone\nsuitable housing, is not a benefit of the Section 8 Program, it would be a fundamental\nalteration, not a reasonable accommodation, for HANH to fund modifications to units\napartment,” Cabrera, 24 F.3d at 381, at all, let alone that such denial was at the hands of\nHANH.\n47 Miller testified that rather than use HANH funds to modify individual privately-\nowned units, HANH used project-based vouchers to provide landlords with guaranteed\nincome for a number of years—10 to 15 years—and in that manner “hopefully to encourage\nthe owner to do the modification and development.”  (Tr. Vol. I at 252.)  He explained that\nhe determined not to use HANH funds to “mak[e] a modification to a tenant-based unit”\nbecause under the tenant-based program, HANH could not obtain “any long-term . . .\ncommitment from the landlord,” the Section 8 recipient could “leave[]” after one year, and\ntherefore funding modifications was not “a fiscally prudent thing to do for a one-year lease\nunless [HANH] could find a way to recapture our investment.”  (Tr. Vol. IV at 720–21.) \nEven if private unit modifications could be construed to be within the benefit HANH offered\nin the Section 8 Program, “[s]ensibly construed, the fundamental-alteration component of\nthe reasonable-modification” obligation does not require an accommodation if, “in the\nallocation of available resources, immediate relief” by funding such modifications “would\nbe inequitable, given the responsibility [HANH] has undertaken” to assist “a large and\ndiverse population of persons with . . . disabilities” to participate in the private housing\nmarket.  See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 604 (plurality op.).\n81\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 82 of 84\nowned by entities other than HANH who are not obligated to provide housing for Section\n8 Participants.  The Rehabilitation Act and the FHAA’s reasonable accommodation mandate\nrequire that programs be administered in a non-discriminatory manner, but do not support\nchallenges to “the substance of the services provided to” the disabled, Doe, 148 F.3d at 84. \nTherefore, judgment must enter in favor of Defendants on Count Four.\nE. Summary\nThe evidence in this case leaves the Court with the firm conclusion that people with\ndisabilities, and especially disabled recipients of Section 8 Program benefits, face severe\nhardships in finding apartments in New Haven that include the features necessary to make\nthem accessible and safe.  Taylor, for example, contacted private landlords who explicitly\ndiscriminated against her on the basis of her disability.  Salovitz movingly described how the\nlack of grab-bars that would permit him to use the bathroom in a safe and efficient manner\nis deleterious and profoundly hinders his ability to go about everyday life activities.  Hunter\ndescribed how his disability left him subject to greater dangers on the streets outside his\napartment.  However, the evidence does not show that Defendants named in this litigation\nviolated the rights that Section 504, the FHA, and the FHAA provide to Taylor, Hunter, or\nSalovitz.  Therefore, judgment must enter in Defendants’ favor on all of Plaintiffs’ claims.48\n48 After trial Defendants Jimmy Miller, Karen DuBois–Walton, and Robert Solomon\nmoved for a judgment that they are not liable for punitive damages.  (Defs.’ Mot. J.\n[Doc. # 212].)  Because the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have not proved Defendants’\nliability under the FHA, FHAA, or Section 504, Defendants’ motion is therefore moot, and\nwill be denied as such.\nPlaintiffs’ Motion to Compel an Unredacted Tax Return from Jimmy Miller (Pls.’\nMot. [Doc. # 236]) is similarly directed to discovery relevant to punitive damages against\nMiller.  The Court earlier ruled that Plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees for their previous\nmotion to compel Miller to disclose his tax returns.  (See Order dated Aug. 26, 2009\n82\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 83 of 84\nVII. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that, in administering the Section\n8 Program and providing the benefits of that program to Rebecca Taylor, Karl Hunter, and\nHeiwa Salovitz, Defendants did not violate the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Housing Act\nAmendments, or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\nIn addition, for the reasons stated above, the Court’s Order Certifying a Class in this\ncase [Doc. # 108] is VACATED; Plaintiffs’ Emergency Motion for Sanctions [Doc. # 193] is\n[Doc. # 208].)  Plaintiffs seek attorney fees in the amount of $5,525, representing 22.1 hours\nat $250 per hour, for their attorney’s pursuit of this discovery (Pls.’ Mot. Atty Fees\n[Doc. # 230]), as to which the Court found that Miller was “out of compliance” for failing\nto produce his tax return (Tr. Vol. II at 278).  Although Miller belatedly complied on\nOctober 5, 2009 (see Pls.’ Notice of Filing Under Seal [Doc. # 229]), his production contained\nnone of the pertinent financial information that Plaintiffs’ discovery sought.  Miller’s\nproduction of a redacted tax return defeated the purpose of the discovery Plaintiffs sought,\nand he therefore remains out of compliance.  However, Plaintiffs’ purpose for seeking the\ntax return is now moot.  Plaintiffs’ motion to compel will therefore be denied as moot.\nDefendants object to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s fee application for 22.1 hours of work in\nconnection with her efforts to obtain Miller’s compliance with his discovery obligations. \nThey argue that Miller was not obligated to produce his tax return until this Court overruled\nhis objections to Magistrate Judge Fitzsimmons’s ruling granting the Plaintiffs’ motion to\ncompel.  (Defs.’ Obj. [Doc. # 231].)  Since Miller’s grounds for objecting to the discovery\nwere meritless, his perpetuating his objection provides no grounds to reduce the attorney-fee\naward; rather, it substantiates the amount of time Plaintiffs’ counsel required to pursue the\nissue.  Notwithstanding Miller’s unjustified opposition to the request for production,\ndetermined to be proper by both Magistrate Judge Fitzsimmons and this Court, the\ndiscovery issue is simple, and some reduction of compensable time is warranted (for\nexample, for the 10.1 hours spent preparing and filing a sur-reply to Defendants’ objections). \nHowever, after Plaintiffs filed the motion for attorney fees, additional time was required to\nprepare and file the motion to compel an unredacted tax return.  Although that motion to\ncompel is moot, counsel is entitled to fees for her efforts to enforce Miller’s discovery\ncompliance.  To cover Attorney Vickery’s subsequent motion to compel after Miller\ncontinued his resistance, the Court will award total fees of $5,000.00, representing 20 hours\nat $250 per hour.\n83\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 240    Filed 03/29/10   Page 84 of 84\nDENIED; Defendants’ Motion for Judgment Regarding Punitive Damages [Doc. # 212] is\nDENIED; Plaintiffs’ Motion for Sanctions [Doc. # 227] is DENIED; Plaintiffs’ Motion for\nAttorney Fees [Doc. # 230] is GRANTED IN PART, in the amount of $5,000.00; Defendants’\nMotion for Sanctions [Doc. # 232] is DENIED; and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel Production\nof Unredacted Tax Return [Doc. # 236] is DENIED.\nPursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52 and 58, the Clerk is directed to enter\njudgment for Defendants on all of Plaintiffs’ claims, and to close this case.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n/s/\nJanet Bond Arterton, U.S.D.J.\nDated at New Haven, Connecticut this 29th day of March, 2010.\n84",

Conn. Sept. 19, 2007); whether any\nlist produced by HANH contained information about availability and accessibility; whether\nany individually–named Defendant participated in the production of the lists; and whether\nthe lists were made available to the public.\nThe Court specifically declined to make any factual findings on the subject matter\nof the requested findings, all of which relate to questions regarding the existence and\nsufficiency of any AAUL produced by HANH, because those findings would have been\n3\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 248    Filed 07/14/10   Page 4 of 6\nimmaterial to the Court’s disposition of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Plaintiffs had argued that HANH\nhad  an  obligation  to  produce  an  AAUL  under  24  C.F.R.  §  8.28(a)(3)  (a  regulation\npromulgated under Section 504), and sought to enforce subsections (2), (3), and (5) of\n§ 8.28(a) through 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  But the Court “conclude[d] that although the\nsubsections of § 8.28(a) may provide guidance on whether a proposed accommodation\nwould be reasonable under Section 504 itself, Plaintiffs do not have a private right of action\nto enforce § 8.28(a) through § 1983.”  Taylor, 267 F.R.D. at 40–41 (emphasis in original); see\ngenerally id. at 40–47.\nA corollary of the Court’s conclusion was that “the private right to an accessible unit\nlist . . . cannot be privately enforced” by Plaintiffs, id. at 46, who therefore could not “proceed\non the ground that they were injured by their inability to obtain the list,” id. at 64.  To the\nextent § 8.28(a)(3) guided the Court’s interpretation of Section 504 itself (which Plaintiffs\nundisputedly have a private right of action to enforce), see id. at 42, 64, the regulation\nsuggested that Section 504 required HANH to give Plaintiffs’ households “any information\nabout ‘available accessible units known to [HANH],’” and therefore to prove Defendants’\nliability Plaintiffs would have to show “HANH’s failure to share with its Section 8 Disabled\nHouseholds, when issuing them vouchers, information in HANH’s possession about available\naccessible units.”  Taylor, 267 F.R.D. at 64–65 & n.30 (emphases in original).\nIn concluding that Plaintiffs had not done so, the Court found, as a factual matter,\nthat\n4\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 248    Filed 07/14/10   Page 5 of 6\nPlaintiffs . . . did not adduce any evidence at trial that HANH had any\ninformation about available accessible units that it failed to share with\nDisabled Section 8 Households.  To the contrary, much of the evidence\nfocused on HANH’s attempts to gather the very information necessary to\ncompile an AAUL. . . . Th[e] evidence shows that to the extent HANH had\ninformation about accessible units, it obtained that information for the very\npurpose  of  sharing  it  with,  and  benefitting,  its  Disabled  Section  8\nHouseholds.\nId. at 65.\nThe  subject  matter  of  the  factual  findings  Plaintiffs  now  ask  the  Court  to\nmake—whether the AAULs that HANH provided complied with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3),\nwhether they contained up–to–date and accurate information about availability and details\nabout accessibility, and whether were made available to the public—could not affect the\nCourt’s determination that Plaintiffs did not show Defendants to be liable under Section 504. \nCombined with the legal conclusion that HANH’s AAUL–related liability under Section 504\ncould be shown only by its “failure to share . . . information in [its] possession about available\naccessible units,” the Court’s factual finding that Plaintiffs did not show “that HANH had\nany information about available accessible units that it failed to share with Disabled Section\n8 Households” demonstrated Defendants’ non–liability and was the basis for the Court’s\ndecision on that claim.  The Court declined to make factual findings about the content and\nprovision of any lists HANH actually produced precisely because its legal conclusions\nreflected that those findings could not alter its decision that Defendants are not liable.\nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs have not shown that the proposed factual findings they\nask the Court to make would “materially have influenced its earlier decision,” Vanderveer\n5\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 248    Filed 07/14/10   Page 6 of 6\nEstates Holding, 2001 WL 243534 at *2,  or “the availability of new evidence, or the need to\ncorrect a clear error or prevent manifest injustice,’” Virgin Atl.

They receive Section 8 rental \nsubsidies administered by HANH. In 2006, three such persons sued HANH for \nassistance searching for wheelchair accessible apartments.  PI. Ex. 5, 6 & 7.  In \n2007, one ofthese filed a federal lawsuit and obtained partial injunctive relief \nGaither Docket #59.  In 2008, Rebecca Taylor, in response to imminent \nforeclosure on the building where she lived, sought and won preliminary \ninjunctive reliet:  Taylor Docket #1, 19,22 & 23. In 2009, the district courts \ncertified a class under Rule 23(b)(2), and consolidated discovery with that ofthe \nGaither case.  Taylor Docket #108 & Gaither Docket # 109.  By stipulation, the \nmerged all issues from the related Gaither lawsuit, except for damages, into the \ninstant case.  Transcript,  pp. 8, line 15 to 9, line 10.  Both cases alleged \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act, as amended, Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act, and 24 C.F.R. §100.204 and 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a). Both sought \ninjunctive relief in the form of independent monitoring, and compensatory and \npunitive damages. \nVlI \n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 8    02/15/2011    209692    44\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nIn July of2006, HUD conducted a Section 504 compliance audit of the \nHousing Authority ofthe City of New Haven (\"HANH\" or the \"Housing \nAuthority\").  Joint Ex. 3. HUD found that the Housing Authority pervasively \nnoncompliant with HUD's Section 504 regulations. The 2006 report noted that \nthe Housing Authority had not followed through on its promise to issue more \nSection 8 vouchers to disabled families, to make up for having excluded them \nfrom its accessible public housing, and had failed to assist disabled Section 8 \nparticipants in lIsing the Section 8 program, by providing services such as a \ncurrent listing of wheelchair accessible apaliments available for rent, assistance \nfinding funds to make modifications to non-accessible apartments, or mobility \ncounseling.l  Joint Ex. 3.  One year after issuing the report, on July 30, 2007, \nHANH and HUD executed a second Voluntary Compliance Agreement (\"the \nVCA\"). Joint Ex. 52  Executive Director Jimmy Miller did not inform the \n\"Mobility counseling\" is a service provided by many large housing authorities \n1 \nto help Section 8 participants search for and ultimately lease a privately-owned \napartment. 53:11-54:14.  HANH provided such services for other purposes, but \nrefused to do so for disabled families who needed help finding accessible units. \n49:15-50:17  PI Ex. 6, p. 46; 51:13-53:5; 68:22-69:8 \nIn1994, HUD had performed the same type of investigation on HANH, \n2 \nthereafter executing the same type of a Voluntary Compliance Agreement, \nwhich described the steps HANH would take to become compliant with \ndisability laws. Subsequently, HANH did not perform many of the actions \nrequired by the first VCA.  However, it suffered no consequences whatsoever \nfrom HUD as a result.

The troubled agency \ndesignation a resulted in part from the fact that the Housing Authority was \nfailing to distribute thousands of the Section 8 vouchers it had been granted. \nTranscript  P. Ex. 30, pp. 166-196.  Instead of issuing the vouchers to those who \nqualified for the Section 8 program, the Housing Authority repeatedly returned \nmillions of dollars in unused Section 8 subsidies to the federal government. \nTranscript p. 549, lines 19-25.  By January of 2008, I-IANH had amassed a \n$15,000,000 surplus of unused Section 8 funds, and was using just 1,300 of the \n3,000 Section 8 vouchers aUotted to it by HUD. Transcript, p. 453, lines 14-19; \nJoint 13 at p. 373 \nIt was at this time that named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor learned that a \njudgment had entered against her landlord.  Born witb spina bifida, Taylor \nFrom 2001 to tbe present I-IANH participated in a HUD pilot program \n3 \ncalled Moving to Work (\"MTW\"). The program gives I-IANH flexibility in how \nit spends Section 8 funding, but does not affect HA NH's obligations to comply \nwith civil rights laws.  From 2006 to 2008, HANH did not use that flexibility to \ncreate any type of housing specifically for the disabled, and added just I3 \nwheelchair accessible units to its public housing stock.

Senior never returned the call.  PI. Ex. 1. \nTaylor also sent a fax to HANH's Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator on \nMarch 14,2008, requesting help finding an apartment.  [d.  When 110 one \nresponded, Taylor filed a federal lawsuit on April 15, 2008.' \nThe district court ordered HANH to give Taylor mobility counseling at a \nMay 7, 2008 hearing.  On May 13, 2008, HANH replaced its current Reasonable \nAccommodations Coordinator, and weeks later,  Jimmy Miller stepped down as \nExecutive Director six months ahead of his contract renewal date. Joint Ex. 31. \nARGUMENT \n1.  TAYLOR MAY ENFORCE 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a) AND §lUU.204 \nTHROUGH SECTION 1983. \nPlaintiffs documented at least six other disabled Section 8 participants who had \n4 \nmade the same type of request as Taylor, in written form.

Legal Authority and Standard of Review \nA district court's conclusions of law are reviewed by this Court de novo, \nConnors v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co.,272 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir.2001). \nThe Fair Housing Act bas been determined to be privately enforceable, \nbecause, unlike the FERP A provisions under consideration in Gonzaga \nUniversity. the Fair Housing Act carries an express right of action. See \ne.g. . Anderson v.  Jackson, 2007 WL 458232, *4 (E.D. La. 2007). Tfthe law \nsought to be enforced \"focuse[s] on 'the aggregate services provided by the \nState,' rather than 'the needs of any particular person,' it confer[s] no individual \nrights and thus cannot be enforced by Section 1983.  Gonzaga University v Doe, \n536 U.S. 273, 28 I (quoting Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 343-44 (1997)). \nThe Second Circuit had recognized the enforceability of Section 504 \nregulations prior to Gonzaga University. but has yet to revisit the issue in light \nof Gonzaga.  Telesca v. Long Island housing Partnership. Inc., 443 F.Supp.2d \n397, 406 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (citing Oopico v. Goldschmidt, 687 F.2d 644, 651, n. \n5 (2d Cir.1982) (\"[P]laintiffs' private right of action under section 504 \nencompasses a right to allege violations of the [implementing] regulations. \"). \nB.  The District Court's Analysis Failed to Account for 24 C.F.R. \n§100.204, which Interprets the Fair Housing Act. \n4\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 12    02/15/2011    209692    44\nThe district court recognized the possibility that 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) \ndescribes the types of reasonable accommodations that HUD requires a housing \nauthority to grant.  But it stopped short by applying this recognition to Section \n504 alone, and failed to consider the same issue with respect to 24 C.F.R. \n§ 100.204.  Plaintiffs contend on appeal that each regulation is independently \nenforceable, 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) implicitly, and 24 C.F.R. § I 00.204  expressly. \nIn addition, plaintiffs contend that because 24 C.F.R. §100.204 tracks the same ' \n\"reasonable accommodation\" language that appears the Rehabilitation Act, \nplaintiffs may use it to enforce the accommodations more specifically described \nin 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a). Thus, the two regulations together, both of which were \nrelied upon by plaintiffs' Count III, are privately enforceable. \nPlaintiffs claimed in Count III that the defendants knowingly violated 24 \nC.F.R. § 100.204, a regulation issued in part 100 pursuant to the Fair Housing \nAct.  The district did not perfOlm the private right of action analysis on it. \nHowever, if it had, the reasoning employed in the decision would have required \nrecognition ofthe plaintiffs' right to privately enforce 24 C.F.R. § 100.204. \nTo decide the 24 C.r-.R. § 8.28(a) claim, the district court first determined \nthat, after Gonzaga University. a court asked to enforce a regulation through \nSection 1983 must first answer, as a threshold question, whether the statute \n5\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 13    02/15/2011    209692    44\nwhich the regulation interprets carries with it a private right of action.  Next, the \ndistrict court evaluated the Rehabilitation Act, searching for language \ndemonstrating an unambiguous intent by Congress to create rights in a limited \n. class of individuals.  It found such language, and proceeded to deem the \nRehabilitation Act itself privately enforceable under Gonzaga University. \nNevertheless, the district court deemed 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) unenforceable, \nbecause it concerned matters not covered by the language of the ·Rehabilitation \nAct itself.' \nYet the above decision-making process trajectory leads to the opposite \nconclusion if applied to 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, because this regulation tracks \nverbatim the language of the Rehabilitation Act, yet was issued in part 100, \npursuant to the FHA and FHAA.  First, the district court's threshold question \nThe district court arrived at its conclusion in two steps. First, it detennined that although \nS \nneither the Second Circuit nor the Supreme Court have detennined whether a regulation may be \nenforced through Section 1983 on its own, if such enforcement is available, it is only to the \nextent that the underlying statute already carries a private right of action, whe.ther expressed or \ns \nimplied. Second, the district court reasoned that because all parties were in agreement that the \nRehabilitation Act itself carnes an implied right of action, then the relevant question was \nwhether the regulation at issue in this case goes beyond the \"scope\" of the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe district court answered this question in the negative, apparently because the text of the \nRehabilitation Act does not mention the specific things discussed in the regulation.  It stated: \nSince the regulation cannot provide a right that tbe statute does not, it follows a \nfortiori  that  no  right  to  specific,  distinct,  tangible,  or  concrete  things \npurportedly granted to disabled persons by regulation can be said to fall within \nthe scope of the private right provided by the statute itself, and therefOre no \nsuch regulation-based right may be enfOrced through § 1983. \n[emphasis added]. \n6\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 14    02/15/2011    209692    44\nabout the private enforceability of the statute would be answered affirmatively. \nCourts within and outside of the Second Circuit have uniformly held that the \nFHA and FHAA are privately enforceable, and continue to do so following \nGonzaga  University.  See Anderson v.  Jackson, 2007 WL 458232, *4 (E.D. La. \n2007) (following the Second Circuit, and reviewing cases holding that § 3608 of \nthe Fair Housing Act is not too vague to be privately enforceable against a \nhousing authority).  Second, because 24 C.F.R. § 100.204 simply reiterates the \ntext of the Rehabilitation Act, as confirmed by the district court's own analysis, \nthat text is unambiguously rights-creating. Thus, although the district court's \ndecision does not specifically render decision upon this claim, applying its \nreasoning to the regulation would compel a finding that 24 C.F.R. §100.204 is \nprivately eniorceable through Section 1983. \nll.  THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY USING THE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FRAMEWORK TO \nDECIDE CLAIMS UNDER 42 U.S.c. § 3604(t)(2). \nDefendants argued they had no legal obligation to provide mobility \ncounseling, and the district court adopted this view in its decision.  The Decision \nreasons that mobility counseling is not a part of what it defines as the benefit of \nthe Section 8 program, and therefore the defendants could never be liable for \nfailing to provide it.  This reasoning is legally flawed, however,. because (1) its \nrestrictive definition of the benefit was not supported by the cited authority, \n7\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 15    02/15/2011    209692    44\nLiberty Resources, and (2) the\" benefit\" concept, while relevant to claims under \nsubsection (f)(3) of 42 U.S.C. §3604, has no role in deciding a claim under \nsubsection (f)(2).  Instead, (f)(2) requires that if a defendant chooses to provide \nan optional service, such as parking space or mobility counseling, it must ensure \nequal access to that same service by disabled persons. \nA.  The District Court Subsumed the § 3604(1}(2) Claim Into \nIts Analysis of the Reasonable Accommodation Claims. \nThe district court determined that, in ruling on the Section 504 claims, it \nmust first ask what did Congress intended to be the benefit of the Section 8 \nprogram. Decision, p. 30-31. Somewhat enigmatically, the district court then \nanswered its question by stating that \"help finding housing\" is not a part of the \nbenefit, and immediately quoting a case that declares that \"aid\" in \"locating\" \nhousing is a part of the benefit: \nThese  sources  make  clear that  the  \"individual  services  offered,\" \nChoate,  469  U.S.  at  303,  constituting  the  \"benefit\"  of HANH's \n\"program  or  activity,\"  inc1udes  the  provision  of a  voucher  to  a \nparticipant to find a unit; monthly assistance payments to a landlord \nto cover some p0l1ion of the cost of renting a private dwelling; and, \nupon request, assistance in a family's negotiation of a \"reasonable \nrent.\"  But this benefit does not include help finding  housing, the \nprovision  of housing,  or  a  guarantee  that a  participant  will  find \nsuitable  housing.  As  the  Liberty  Resources  court  concluded, \n\"[n   ]either the [1937 Act] nor the HUn regulation promise to provide \nhousing  to  all  eligible  participants.  Rather,  they state  that  the \npurposeo[[the Section 8 Program] is to aid families in locating and \naffording decent housing through the provision of rental subsidies. \n8\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 16    02/15/2011    209692    44\nThe  [Section 8]  Program facilitates the  placement of low-income \nfamilies in affordable housing by seeking the assistance of private \nsector landlords.\"  528 F. Supp. 2d at 567.  Decision, p. 42. \nTbe district court went on to apply its determination tbat Section 8 does not \ninclude help finding housing not only to tbc Section 504 claims, but also to the \nclaims under the FHA and FHAA.  Decision, pp. 58 & 71. \nAlthough this process resolves the claim under (1)(3), which contains the \n\"reasonable accommodation\" phrasing found in Section 504, it has no bearing \non the (1)(2) claim.  The federal courts have recognized that (1)(2) and (1)(3) are \nnot co-extensive, in part because their textual differences make (1)(2) applicable \nto plaintiffs who have not requested a reasonable accommodation. See, \n~ \nRadecki v. Joura,  114 F.3d 115, 116 (8th Cir.1997) (reversing dismissal of \nclaim under § 3604(1)(1 )(A), even in the absence of evidence that plaintiff had \nalleged denial of a reasonable accommodation under 3604(1)(3)). The text of \n(1)(2) reads: \n§ 3604. Discrimination in the sale or rental of housing and other \nprohibited practices \n(I) ... [I]t shall be unlawful-\n(2) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or \nprivileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or \nfacilities in connection witb such dwelling, because of a handicap of \n(A) that person; or \n(B) a person residing in or intending to reside in that \ndwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available; or \n(C) any person associated with that person. \n9\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 17    02/15/2011    209692    44\nPlaintiffs alleged in Count I of their Amended Complaint a violation of all \nsections of § 3604(f), and echoed the language of the both subsections, each in \nseparate parts of paragraph 65 of the Third Amended Complaint: \n65.  The Defendants have intentionally discriminated against the \nplaintiffs on account of their disabilities and handicaps, discriminating \nagainst them in the provision of services and otherwise making dwellings \nunavailable to them by: \na. refusing to maintain a current listing of the available, accessible \napartments  (\"AUL\"), such as HANH maintains for non-disabled Section \n8 households; \nb. refusing to provide the same mobility counseling services as HANH \nprovides to non-disabled Section 8 households;Lemphasis added]. \nThe \"provision of services\" language of subsection (f)(2) appears not only in the \nplaintiffs' pleadings and in their proposed Conclusions of Law, but throughout \nthe motions and memoranda submitted in the course of this case, including \nplaintiffs' motions for preliminary injunctive relief.  In this context, it was an \nerror not to decide the (f)(2) claim independently. \nB.  By Offering Mobility Counseling to Section 8 Participants for \nOther Purposes, Yet Denying It for the Purpose of Finding \nWheelchair Accessible Apartments, Defendants Violated \n§ 3604(f)(2). \nIt is undisputed that from 2006 to 2008 the Housing Authority had chosen \nto provide mobility counseling services to non-disabled Section 8 families. They \ndid so in two ways, through outside consultants and in-house.  In 2004, the \ndefendants had executed a contract with a consultant named HOU to provide up \n10\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 18    02/15/2011    209692    44\nto $100,000 annually in such services. The parties renewed the contract twice, \nbut by 2007, over half of the funds remained unused. Also, in 2006, defendants \ndirected HANH staff to offer a limited form of mobility counseling to all \nSection 8 participants if they would agree to move to the subsurbs. Miller related \nthat HANH was under \"pressure\" from HUD to help Section 8 families move \nout of high minority, high poverty neighborhoods. Miller testified that \n\"anybody\" could receive mobility counseling services as part of the latter effort. \nNevertheless, Miller admitted that disabled Section 8 participants were not \npermitted to use either of these services for the purpose offmding a wheelchair \naccessible apartment.  HANH's Section 8 Director and staff confirmed his \ntestimony, stating that they had never been instructed to provide mobility \ncounseling themselves to help disabled tamilies in need of accessible \napaltments, as they did to the general population.  Instead, these requests were \nsent \"upstairs\" to the Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator.  There, the \nrequest would languish for months or years until it was ultimately denied per \nHANH policy, unless the requesting family retained counsel.  This practice of \nrefusing requests for mobility counseling to find a wheelchair accessible \naprutment, but providing mobility counseling to families who wanted it for other \nreasons, amounted to intentional discrimination under §3604(t)(2). \n11\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 19    02/15/2011    209692    44\nC.  HANH Denied Taylor Mobility Connseling By Failing to \nInform Her She Could Use the Service to Find a Wheelchair \nAccessible Apartment. \nIf the court had applied the legal standards relevant to subsection (1)(2), \nthe plaintiffs would have prevailed on that claim.  A claim that defendants hid \nthe truth about a service offered in connection with renting housing is \nactionable.  See Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 375-76 (1982) \n(holding testers have standing as persons \"directly injured\" by a defendant's \nuntruthful statements about housing, even if they are not themselves suing for a \ndenial of housing). Taylor herself ultimately received mobility counseling after \nwinning preliminary injunctive relief as part of this lawsuit. Yet by previously \nhiding from Taylor the availability of mobility counseling, the Housing \nAuthority caused her to remain in an unsuitable dwelling. Throughout 2006 and \n2007, Taylor lived in an apartment that was not wheelchair accessible. She was \nforced to essentially crawl down the front steps if no one was available to help \nher exit the building.  From March of 2008 forward, Taylor endured extreme \nanxiety as she wondered whether she would be rendered homeless by the \nforeclosure proceedings against her landlord. Even assuming arguendo that the \ndistrict court's conclusion that Taylor was not denied a reasonable \naccommodation is correct, the question of whether Taylor's rights to be \n12\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 20    02/15/2011    209692    44\ninformed of and provided mobility counseling were violated remains \nunanswered. \nIII.  THE DISTRICT COURT'S FINDINGS ON MOBILITY \nCOUNSELING MUST BE REVERSED IN LIGHT OF \nADMISSION #1,  AND THE RECORD AS WHOLE. \nA.  Legal Authority and Standard of Review \nA district court's decision on the exclusion of evidence by reason of an \nadmission is reviewed by this Court for abuse of discretion. Commodity Futures \nTrading Comm'n v. In!,1 Financial Services (NYl. lnc., 323 F. Supp. 2d 482 \n(S.O.N.Y.2004). \nA matter admitted under Rule 36(a) is conclusively established, unless the \ncourt grants a motion to permit the admission to be withdrawn or amended.  See \nfed.R.Civ.P. 36(b); United States v. Kasuboski, 834 f.2d 1345, 1249 (7th \nCir.1987); Moosman v. Joseph P. Blitz, Inc., 358 F.2d 686, 688 (2d Cir.1966). \nAny evidence that contradicts a binding Rule 36 admission is properly excluded. \n999 v. C.l.T. Corp., 776 F.2d 866, 870 (9th Cir.1985); Switchmusic.com, Inc. v. \nU.S. Music Corp., 416 F.Supp.2d 812, 818 (C.O.Cal. 2006).  An admission \n\"cannot be rebutted by contrary testimony or ignored by the district court simply \nbecause it finds the evidence presented by the party against whom the admission \noperates more credible.\"  Cooke v. Allstate Ins. Co., 337 F.Supp.2d 1206, 1210 \n(C.O.Cal. 2004).  While a court has discretion to permit withdrawal of an \n13\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 21    02/15/2011    209692    44\nadmission upon motion, such discretion should be exercised only \"compelling \ncircumstances,\" and where the party who obtained the admission will not be \nprejudiced. Moosman at 688; Commodity Futures, 323 F. Supp. 2d at 510-11 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2004). \nB.  Disregarding Admission #1, Which States a Policy of Not \nProviding Mobility Counseling, Was An Abuse of Discretion. \nOn July 18, 2007, defendant Jimmy Miller responded to plaintiffs Request \nfor Admissions #1 as follows: \n\"The Housing Authority does not do searches for apartments.\" \nSee PI. Ex. 21.  The district court impermissibly altered the evidence by \ndisregarding this conclusive admission.  Pursuant to Rule 36(b), a matter \nadmitted \"is conclusively established\" and a party may not introduce \ncontradictory evidence. At the pretrial conference on July 29, 2009, the district \ncourt and the parties confirmed their mutual understanding that any evidence \noffered to regarding HANH's mobility counseling efforts would not be for the \npurposes of contesting liability on this issue, but solely for collateral purposes, \nsuch as proving punitive damages.  7-29-2009 Transcript, p. 27, lines 6-17. \nHowever, throughout trial, defense witnesses attempted to contradict \nAdmission #1. For example, under questioning from the district court, Miller \ntried again, first admitting that under his leadership, HANH mobility counseling \n\" \nto disabled families, Transcript, p. 766, lines 1-19, but adding that he had read \n14\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 22    02/15/2011    209692    44\n\"records\" indicating that HANH staff had nevertheless given mobility \ncounseling all along,  \"although there was not authorization.\"  Id. 6 \nPlaintiffs objected to two of the most blatant of these attempts. First, \nplaintiffs objected to relevance and lack of time frame when HANH's newest \nreasonable accommodations coordinator as of May 13, 2008, Laura Woodie, \ntestified that she had provided mobility counseling for disabled Section 8 \nparticipants before actually taking the job.  Transcript, p. 862, line 15 to p. 866, \nlinc 12.  Thc district court permittcd the tcstimony. Transcript, p 864, line 16. \nSecond, plaintiffs objected when defense counsel attempted to elicit trom \nHANH's former Section 8 Director, Iris Santiago, generalized assertions that she \nhad performed mobility counseling on an ad hoc basis in 2006 and 2007. \nTranscript, pp.  1437-1438.  Plaintiffs specifically pointed to Admission #1 as \nrequiring that the testimony be excluded.  The district court reserved judgment, \nsee Transcript, p. 1439, but its subsequent finding that \"HANH did not, on a \nprogrammatic or policy-wide basis, deny mobility counseling to those who \n6  Miller's testimony shows that all of the two programs through which mobility counseling \noccurred during his tenure-Expanded Housing Opportunities and Brookside-served the \ngeneral population, and were not available as a reasonable accommodation to disabled \nfamilies who needed wheelchair accessihle apartments. Miller described that Laura Woodie \nworked in HANH's public housing department prior to becoming the Reasonable \nAccommodations Coordinator on May 13,2008, and part of her job was to relocate pubic \nhousing families so that HANH could demolish the Brookside public housing complex. \nTranscript, pp. 36-37; It. Ex. 29. \n15\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 23    02/15/2011    209692    44\nrequested it, even during the claimed liability period\" squarely contradicts \nAdmission #1, and appears to credit the objected-to testimony. Decision at 57. \nA court has discretion to permit an amendment to an admission if it \n\"promotes the presentation of the merits\" and will not prejudice the opposing \nparty.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b).  The trial testimony by Laura Woodie about \npre-2008 mobility counseling directly contradicted the admission.  In addition, it \ncontravened the pretrial conference ruling that any evidence about mobility \ncounseling would not be admissible to contest liability. Moreover, the district \ncourt's decision to pennit this testimony was a mid-trial reversal of its own prior \nrulings that defendants could not withdraw or supplement Admission #l. This \nruling rewarded the defendants' strenuous efforts to shield Novak and from \ndeposition and prevent plaintitls from discovering her correspondence, see \nTranscript, pp. 278, line 20 to 295, line 8, at a time when plaintiffs could no \nlonger do anything about it.  In short, the district couri's action in refusing to \nexclude this testimony from evidence, and failing to regard the matter in the \nadmission as conclusively established, was an abuse of discretion that has \nseverely prejudiced the plaintiffs. \nC.  The Record as a Whole Compels A Finding That HANH Did \nNot Change Its Mobility Counseling Policy Until April 2008, \nAfter This Lawsuit Was Filed. \n16\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 24    02/15/2011    209692    44\nThe bulk of the evidence and testimony offered at trial about individuals \nwho received mobility counseling described events that took place after these \nlawsuits had commenced. Hence, it was irrelevant to liability. Such evidence did \nnot contradict that, up until April 2008, HANH's policy was to deny mobility \ncounseling based on disability.  All of the individuals whom the evidence \nshowed actually received mobility counseling prior to April 2008 had filed \nlawsuits against HANH. \nPlaintiffs challenge the evidentiary basis of district court's findings of fact \non the absence of a practice of denying mobility counseling to families seeking \naccessible apartments as unsupported by the record as whole, or even the court's \nown citations to the record.  This brief addresses each such fmding in order of its \nappearance in the Decision. \n1.  Page 57 \nThe district court placed great weight upon its finding that Jimmy Miller \nhad provided mobility counseling for two disabled individuals, Lona Mitchell \nand Louis Morrison. It accurately stated that Mitchell and Morrison each had \nrequested mobility counseling before April 2008, in June of2006 and November \nof 2007 respectively. The court then treated those dates as the dates when Miller \napproved the requests.  However, such request dates do not show anything by \nthemselves, because at HANH, such requests often sat for years unanswered. \n17\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 25    02/15/2011    209692    44\nMitchell's case is illustrative: her file shows that she received a letter stating she \nhad been  \"approved\" in September of 2007, but she was not actually provided \nmobility counseling until March of2009.  Transcript, p. 983, line 20 to p. 984, \nline 17. \nThe record as a whole shows that in August 2007, Mitchell and Morrison \nwere part of the group of five families whose paperwork was submitted by the \nnewly created Reasonable Accommodations Committee to the HANH \nCommission. The Committee recommended that they receive mobility \ncounseling, but needed the Commissions approval to pay for the,services.  The \nCommittee's written recommendation was then \"edited\" by HANH's \nCommission, and the resulting resolution was then approved. Although \nCommission Chair Solomon disputed the accuracy ofthe minutes, he admitted \nthat as written they appear to record that two families were excluded from \nreceiving mobility counseling, because they had not commenced litigation \nagainst HANH.  After the vote, HOU in fact provided mobility counseling to \njust the three families (Rhonda Gaither, Shirley Hampton, and Dorothy Stokes \nHall) who had filed.lawsuits.  The services were provided using HANH's \nexisting contract with HOU, through their consultant, Greg Brunson. \nAt trial, Heinrichs ac.lmitted under cross-examination that the two non-\nlitigant families were Mitchell and Morrison. Exhibits drawn from HANH's \n18\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 26    02/15/2011    209692    44\nfiles showed that Mitchell and  Morrison finally received their reasonable \naccommodation approval decision letters in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Laura \nWoodie, HANH's Reasonable Accommodations Coordinator from May 2008 \nforward, testified to having personally  provided Mitchell the mobility \ncounseling services in 2009, three years after her 2006 request. Thus, while \nMitchell and Morrison did ultimately receive mobility counseling, each of them \nwaited much longer to receive help than they would have ifHANH had used its \nexisting contract with HOU to assist them in August of2007.  The plaintiffs \nsubmit that these additional parts of the record strengthen, rather than weaken, \nthe case that, at least until April 2008, HANH had an overall policy of refusing \nmobility counseling as a reasonable accommodation. \n2.  Page 61 \nThe district court further found that \"only a small number of \ndisabled voucher holders asked for mobility counseling.\" Decision at 61. \nHowever, this finding ignores overwhelming evidence that the reason so few \nasked for mobility counseling is that the defendants had conveyed to disabled \nSection 8 participants that mobility counseling was not an option for them. First, \nin March of2006, when Miller himself revised HANH' reasonable \naccommodation forms- papers which defendants touted as their primary device \nfor communicating the services available to Section 8 participants-he did not \n19\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 27    02/15/2011    209692    44\nlist mobility counseling as one of the options.  PI. Ex. 34 & 36. Second, from \n2006 thtough April 2008, Miller continued to sign or authorized pleadings and \nother representations that HANH would not provide mobility counseling to \nSection 8 participants.  Admission #1; PI. Ex. 5,6 and 7.  For example, at \nTaylor's hearing for preliminalY injunctive relief on May 7, 2008, Miller was \npresent and did not object when HANH's counsel answered the court's query \nabout whether HANH would at that time give mobility counseling to Taylor by \nsaying \"[W]e can't provide that, we don't have a contract.\" PI. Ex.  I, p. 20, lines \n13-18. Third, HANH's Section 8 staff confirmed that lbey were not instructed \nabout lbe availability of mobility counseling to help lbeir disabled participants \nfind Section 8 apartments until at least April of2008. Fourth, HANH's internal \nmanual of Section 8 procedures says nothing about the availability of mobility \ncounseling. Fifth, William Heinrichs, the Reasonable Accommodations \nCoordinator under Miller, testified in his January of 2008 deposition lbat neither \nhe nor anyone else at HANH was currently providing mobility counseling as a \nreasonable accommodation. Sixth, every Section 8 participant who testified \nconfirmed that prior to April of2008, no HANH employee had ever told them \nthey could ask for or have mobility counseling.  Seventh, and most significantly, \nHANH did not add mobility counseling to the list of available reasonable \n20\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 28    02/15/2011    209692    44\naccommodations on its fonns for Section 8 participants until after this lawsuit \ncommenced on April 22, 2008,  PI, Ex. 35 &  37. \n3.  Page 62, footnote 31 \nThe court cited page 103 of the transcript as evidence that even if \nMaureen Novak, the reasonable accommodation coordinator, did not believe the \nHousing Authority was legally obligated to provide mobility counseling as a \nreasonable accommodation, \"she was overridden by her direct supervisor, \nMiller, who believed he did have such an obligation.\"  Decision, footnote 31. \nPage 103 confirms that Miller admits to a \"philosophical\" disagreement with \nNovak, but does not suggest that he actually overruled her decisions. The \nexchange goes on for five more pages, without any indication that Miller \novenuled any of Novak's decisions about mobility counseling requests.  On the \ncontrary, Miller testifies that he continued to sign off on the reasonable \naccommodations decisions made by Novak until thc day she resigned. \nTranscript, p.1 08, lines 1-14. Miller also stated that his disagreement with \nNovak about mobility counseling did not cause him to remove her from the \nposition, or to reassign the reasonable accommodation decision-making function \nto another employee--even though he did reassign some of her other duties. \nTnmscript, p.I07, lines 9-19. Thus, the section of the testimony provides no \n21\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 29    02/15/2011    209692    44\nsupport for the finding that Miller had \"overridden\" Novak's anti-mobility \ncounseling policy. \nMoreover, the transcript as a whole compels the opposite conclusion. \nMiller himself testified that HANH did not start offering mobility counseling as \na reasonable accommodation until after he left the role of Executive Director in \nJune of2008. See Transcript,  p.759, lines 5-8; pp. 761, line 8 to 762, line I; p. \n766, line II. Miller's basic defense strategy at trial was to claim that he had \nwanted the Housing Authority to provide mobility counseling as a reasonable \naccommodation, but was prevented from following his better judgment. Miller \nalso blamed many other things for stopping him from changing HANH's \npolicies while he was Executive Director, including HUD, various mobility \ncounseling companies, HANH's budget problems, the \"state of disarray\" at \nHANH prior to his arrival, and even a flood in Indiana. When Miller was \npresented with a June of2007 letter denying mobility counseling signed by \nNovak, see PI. Ex. 40, p. 4, he exclaimed, \"[Y]ou should talk to her.'\"  While \n7  Novak was an individual defendant in the Gaither litigation filed in May 0[2007.  The \nplaintiffs sought and received an expedited discovery schedule in that case. 'When Novak \n\"went on medicalleavc\" to Nebraska in August of2007, plaintiffs sought and received \nassurances from defense counsel  that she would be made available to be deposed, Thereafter, \nparties engaged in a two-year hattie over whether Novak would return to Connecticut.  The \nplaintiffs' filed multiple motions to compel, sanction, and appoint a forensic computer expert \nto investigate the defendants' representations that Novak's computer hard drive had been \naccidentally erased. As to Novak's deposition, the motions were resolved by the parties' \nstipulation that neither side would call Novak as a witness at trial.  The court denied the other \nmotions in its Decision. \n22\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 30    02/15/2011    209692    44\nMiller may well have been implying that Novak was to blame for the policy, he \nnever testified that he corrected it.  Thus, the district court's finding that any \ndecisions by Novak to deny mobility counseling were \"overridden\" by Miller is \nplain error. \nUltimately, three facts can be derived from Miller's testimony \naffirming that he personally signed off on each of the reasonable \naccommodation decision letters denying requests for mobility counseling. First, \nMiller clearly knew that disabled families were requesting and being routinely \ndenied mobility counseling. See PI. Exhibit 40. Second, Miller must have \nknown, based on the absence of any specific facts articulated within the letters \nhe was signing, that the requests were being denied in a blanket manner-i.e., \nnot tor individualized reasons.  Id.  Whereas other denial letters signed by \nMiller typically included comments such as that the request was incomplete or \ndid not seem to be necessary based on the severity ofthc disability, the mobility \ncounseling denials did not include such comments. Id.  Third, Miller's \ntestimony admits that he was aware that he had the authority to order Novak to \nchange the policy, but did not do so. In sum, regardless of whether these letters \nreflected the personal views of Novak or Miller, the evidence shows that, as an \norganization, HANH's practice was to deny requests for mobility counseling as \na reasonable accommodation, until Novak's departure in August 0[2007. \n23\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 31    02/15/2011    209692    44\nIV.  HANH'S PATTERN OF REFUSING TO PRODUCE EITHER \nNOVAK OR HER COMPUTER FILES JUSTIFIES AN ADVERSE \nINFERENCE IN TAYLOR'S FAVOR THAT SHE REQUESTED \nMOBILITY COUNSELING AS A REASONABLE \nACCOMMODATION. \nIn the course of discovery, defendants at various points represented \nthat the computer hard drive used by Maureen Novak, HANH's Reasonable \nAccommodations Coordinator until August of 2007, was lost, or that it had been \n\"wiped.\"  Plaintiffs filed and renewed motions asking the district court to \nsanction the defendants by requiring them to pay for a forensic examination of \nthe computer's hard drive, or to pay to transp0l1 Novak back to Connecticut \nfrom Nebraska to be deposed.  Defendants then claimed the hard drive was not \nlost and had not been erased, and complied with Order # 101  and # 134 by \nproducing certain forms of electronic discovery in May and June 2009. A week \nbefore trial, defendants disclosed thousands more \"newly discovered\" emails \nfrom the time period when Novak worked at HANH. Plaintiffs immediately \nrenewed their motions for sanctions, but asked that the district cgurt infer intent \nto discriminate from both the untimely emails and the misrepresentations about \nNovak's hard drive that  defendants.  The district court reserved judgment.  Its \nDecision ultimately held that the onus was on the plaintiffs to have proven post· \ntrial that the late email disclosures contained relevant material.  However, it did \nnot analyze the result of the defendants pattern as a whole, or whether their false \n24\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 32    02/15/2011    209692    44\nstatements and/or failure to preserve the Novak hard drive justified the requested \nadverse inference. \nA.  Legal Authority and Standard of Review \nA district court's decision on a motion for discovery sanctions may be \nreviewed by this Court for abuse of discretion. See. lUb Selletti v. Carey. 173 \nF.3d 104, 110 (2d Cir.1999). \"A district court would necessarily abuse its \ndiscretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly \nerroneous assessment of the evidence.\" Cooter & aell v. Hartmarx Com., 496 \nU.S. 384, 405 (1990). An adverse inference instruction serves the remedial \npurpose, \"insofar as possible, of restoring the prejudiced party to the same \nposition he would have been in absent the wrongful destruction of evidence by \nthe opposing party.\" Kronisch v. United States, ISO F.3d 112, 126-28 (2d \nCir.1998). \n\"The party seeking an adverse inference must adduce sufficient evidence \nfrom which a reasonable trier of fact could infer that 'the destroyed [or \n1 \nunavailable  evidence would have been of the nature alleged by the party \naffected by its destruction' but Courts must take care not to 'hold[] the \nprejudiced party to too strict a standard of proof regarding the likely contents of \nthe destroyed [or unavailable1  e vidence,' because doing so 'would subvert the ... \npurposes of the adverse inference, and would allow parties who have ... \n25\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 33    02/15/2011    209692    44\ndestroyed evidence to profit from that destruction.'; .... Accordingly, where a \nparty seeking an adverse inference adduces evidence that its opponent destroyed \npotential evidence (or otherwise rendered it unavailable) in bad faith or through \ngross negligence (satisfying the \"culpable state of mind\" factor), that same \nevidence of the opponent's state of mind will frequently also be sullicient to \npermit a jury to conclude that the missing evidence is favorable to the party \n(satisfying the \"relevance\" factor).\" Residential Funding Com. v. Degeorge \nHome Alliance, Inc., 306 F.3d 99, 57-59 (2d Cir, 2002). \nThe burden-shifting analysis articulated in McDonnell Douglas Com. v. \nGreen, 41 1 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973) requires the plaintiffs in this case to \nproduce evidence of a prima facie case of reasonable accommodation. 2922 \nSherman Avenue Tenants' Assoc. v. District of Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 682 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006). Under the FHAA, The burden then shifts, such that \"[tlhe \nultimate burden at trial of proving that a proposed accommodation is not \n\" \nreasonable or that plaintiffs cannot be accommodated rests with defendants.\" \nAssisted Living Assoc. of Moorestown, L.L.c. v. Moorestown Township, 996 F. \nSupp. 409, 435 (D. NJ 1998). \nB,  Taylor's Evidence of the Timing and Exigent Circumstances  of \nHer Requests Was Sufficient to Create a Prima Facie Case of \nDiscrimination Under the FHAA, \n26\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 34    02/15/2011    209692    44\nThe district court's subsidiary factual findings state a prima facie case for \nRebecca Taylor.  Nevertheless, the court refused to fmd that Taylor had met her \nburden, because it viewed the date of the request as a critical piece of evidence \ntbat was highly contested. \nBecause the voice mail request certainly would have fallen within a \nperiod of time when the defendants admit to not providing mobility counseling \nto the disabled, the precise date was wmecessary to establish Taylor's prima \nfacie case. In fact, the testimony of William Heinrichs at the preliminary \ninjunction hearing revealed that the Housing Authority had been aware of the \nnamed plaintiff's immediate need for assistance for two weeks prior to the \nhearing, but had not done anything.  See  PI. Ex. I (Transcript of PI Hearing). \nAt trial, Heinrichs answered differently, but then admitted again under cross-\nexamination that he was advised of Taylor's dire need to move, but did not offer \nher mobility counseling: \nQ. Were you aware before the lawsuit that Rebecca Taylor was seeking \nreasonable accommodation from HANH? \nA. No, I was not. \nMR. SWIFT: I have nothing further, your \nHonor. \nTHE COURT: All right, cross-examination. \nCROSS-EXAMINA nON \nBY MS. VICKERY: \nQ. Mr. Heinrichs, is it your testimony that you never spoke with me about Ms. \nTaylor, Rebecca Taylor, prior to attending her preliminaryinjunction hearing? \nA. No, it is not. \n27\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 35    02/15/2011    209692    44\nQ. So you did in fact have communication with me between the time that Ms. \nTaylor's case was filed on April 22nd, 2008, and the time of the hearing on May \n7,2008, correct? \nA. That is correct. \nQ. And it was about her needs and how to reasonably accommodate her, \ncorrect? \nA. Does that have to be a yes or no? \nQ. Yes. \nA. I don't remember. \nQ. It's possible that it was about her needs for reasonable accommodation, is it \nnot? \nA. Yes. \nQ. When you attended the actual preliminary injunction hearing, you testified- \nyou indicated \nthrough your attorney, correct, that you had in fact been communicating with \nme in trying to resolve Ms. Taylor's issue, correct? \nA. I guess so. I'm sorry if I'm not remembering it well. \nQ. And, in fact, Ms. Taylor had not been assisted in any -- she had not been \ngiven mobility \ncounseling within that timeframe of April 22\"' through May 7th, correct? \nA. She had not, to my knowledge. \nQ. You hadn't given it to her? \nA. That is correct. \nTranscript, pp.  1277-78. \nGiven the fact that part of the infonnation HANH and Heinrichs had \nreceived about Taylor on April 22, 2008 was a pleading that attached a default \njudgment on a foreclosure against her landlord, Taylor's request for mobility \ncounseling as a reasonable accommodation was clearly an emergency request. \nA defendant's actual knowledge that a disabled plaintiff needs a reasonable \naccommodation trumps technical requirements.  See Radecki v. Joura, 114 F.3d \n115, 116 (8th Cir.1997). In this case, it is undisputed that Taylor's needed to \n28\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 36    02/15/2011    209692    44\nreceive mobility counseling on an emergency basis had been clearly \ncommunicated to Heinrichs, the proper person at HANH, in several ways, and \nHANH chose to adhere to its policy of not providing mobility counseling until \nafter the district court had announced it intended to order relief for Tay lor on \nMay 7, 2008. \nJust as significantly, prior to the events that triggered this lawsuit, HANH \nhad been aware of Rebecca Taylor's need for mobility counseling for years, \ninasmuch as its staff had inspected the apartment, and had undoubtedly seen that \nit has stairs at all points of egress. When Denise Senior met on a yearly basis \nwith Ms. Taylor, she undoubtedly saw that Taylor is confined to a wheelchair. \nWhether or not Taylor's Section 8 worker directly refused to help her find a new \napartment when she was faced with foreclosure, it should be troubling enough \nthat HANH staff members had for years ignored Ms. Taylor's obvious need for \na wheelchair  accessible apartment. \nC.  The District Court's Refusals to Order Forensic Examination \nof Novak's Hard Drive Prejudiced Taylor Severely. \nIf the district court is correct in finding the exact date necessary, its \nabsence must be construed in Taylor's favor, inasmuch as the defendants either \nfailed to preserve Novak's hard drive. Taylor was intensely fearful of becoming \nhomeless and perhaps losing custody of her daughter-so much so that her \ntestimony at the preliminary injunction hearing had to be stopped for a period in \n29\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 37    02/15/2011    209692    44\norder to collect herself. PI. Ex.  J. Extreme anxiety may have kept Taylor from \nrecalling the date of her last Section 8 recertification, but she was certain she \nhad called Denise Senior in March. Yet, defendants made no effort to contradict \nTaylor on this issue while she was alive. Despite having requested and received \ntwo weeks to prepare for Taylor's preliminary injunction hearing, defense \ncounsel did not call the obvious witness, Denise Senior. \nInstead, HANH waited until trial to put Senior on as a witness. Transcript, \npp. 1541 to 1572.  Senior testified that that if Taylor had requested a reasonable \naccommodation her HANH file would not show it, because Senior would have \nsent the request to Novak, without keeping a copy in the Taylor file. Senior's \ntestimony shows that Novak's computer records could be expected to show \nTaylor's request.  Pl. Ex. 32; Transcript, p. 1567, line 17- to p.  1568, line 14; Jt. \nEx. 19, p.27. PI. Ex. 33. On this record, an adverse inference was justified. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs pray this Court will reverse the district court's conclusions that \nthe plaintiffs lack a private right to enforce 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a) through 24 \nC.F.R. § 100.204; decide the § 3604(f)(2) claim and recertify subclass (b) class \nas to mobility counseling.  Alternatively, plaintiffs pray that this Court reverses \nthe denial of plaintiff' Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 37 motions, and imposes an adverse \ninference that Taylor requested mobility counseling. \n30\n\nCase: 10-1144   Document: 103   Page: 38    02/15/2011    209692    44\nRespectfully Submitted, \nAT  IORNEY FOR PLAINTIFFS-APPELLANT \nREBECCA TA  , ET AL \n/ s/----c+-<>~:-::-:_J'---::.~--=-----:-:: \nJennifer C.

The evidence relevant to such \nadditional findings is summarized below. \nA.  LEGAL BASIS  \n  “Rule 52(b) provides that “[o]n a party's motion filed no later than 10 days after \nentry of judgment, the court may amend its findings-or make additional findings-and may \namend the judgment accordingly.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(b). “[A] party may move to amend \nthe findings of fact even if the modified or additional findings in effect reverse the \njudgment. If the trial court has entered an erroneous judgment, it should correct it.” \nGolden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson, 438 F.3d 1354, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  “This \ndirective to correct erroneous judgments appears particularly clear where, as here, the \n  1 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 247    Filed 04/07/10   Page 2 of 7\nparties have not contributed to the court's error.” U.S. v. Texas, 572 F. Supp.2d 726, 730 \n(E.D. Texas 2008) (noting that the court’s duty to alter its findings where the evidence \nrelied upon by the movant was admitted at trial).  \nB.  EVIDENTIARY BASIS \n  Plaintiffs have claimed since the commencement of these proceedings that the \ndefendants’ refusal to provide a list of units to the disabled that is comparable to the list it \nprovides to the non-disabled violates the FHAA. Thus, findings related to this issue are \nmaterial.  The claim and the facts to support it were presented by the plaintiffs in both \npleadings1 and proposed findings of fact. At trial, plaintiffs produced a number of \ndocuments specifically related to these claims.  See generally, Pl. Ex. 42-50.  In addition, \nwitnesses Calvin, Deloatch, and Salovitz gave live testimony relevant to the issue, and \nwitnesses Ford, Jones and Taylor gave testimony admitted by agreement in the form of \ntranscripts from other proceedings, depositions and/ or affidavit. Thus, there exists \nsufficient basis for the Court to issue specific factual findings on whether the defendants \nviolated the FHAA by adhering to a policy of providing housing-related services to its \nnon-disabled Section 8 participants that it refused to provide to the disabled. The \n                                                 \n1  See Third Amended Complaint, ¶65: \n “The Defendants have intentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs on account of \ntheir disabilities and handicaps, discriminating against them in the provision of services \nand otherwise making dwellings unavailable to them by:  \n a. refusing to maintain a current listing of  the available, accessible apartments   \n  (“AUL”), such as HANH maintains for non-disabled Section 8 households;. . . ” \n \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 247    Filed 04/07/10   Page 3 of 7\nMemorandum of Decision would be incomplete without specific findings of fact on this \nclaim.  \n  The following paragraphs in bold are quoted from plaintiffs’ pre-trial proposed \nfindings of fact. \n1.  HANH generates a monthly listing of available apartments to give to Section \n8 voucher holders (“Section 8 List”), but fails to provide a comparable monthly \nlisting of available accessible apartments to give to disabled Section 8 voucher \nholders (“AUL”). \n \n  Testimony of Rebecca Taylor:  Ex. 1, pp. 33-34. \n \n   \n  Admissions of Defendants:  Tr. Oral Argument May 7, 2008, p 20, lines19-25 \n \n \n4.  In September of 2007, a federal court ordered HANH to produce an AUL \npursuant to its obligations under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3).  However, the list did not \ninclude any information on availability.  \n \n  Exhibit 43: List produced by Defendants in compliance with Gaither v. HANH, \nDocket No. 59. \n \n5.  In May of 2008, this Court entered a stipulated order that HANH would \nproduce an AUL, update it monthly, and to make it continuously available to the \npublic.  In response to the August 7, 2008 deadline, HANH produced a list very \nsimilar to the Gaither list, again without availability information.  However, HANH \nadded to the Taylor List the following disclaimer, which is not present on the \nregular Section 8 List:  “Check with the rental office for information about pricing \nand availability.”   \n \n  Taylor v. HANH, Docket No. 24, ¶ 5: \n \n“HANH will provide a current list of available accessible units in New Haven within \nthree months of May 6, 2008, to be updated on a monthly basis, and that list will be \nprovided by HANH to individuals who request it.” \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 247    Filed 04/07/10   Page 4 of 7\n \n \n \n  Ex. 46:  Example of Section 8 listing regularly produced by Defendants, dated \nJuly 1, 2008. \n \n  Ex. 47:  List produced by Defendants in compliance with Docket No. 24, ¶ 5.  \n \n \n6.  The Taylor List was personally reviewed, edited, and approved by Karen \nDubois-Walton, as the current Executive Director of HANH.  It did not use the same \nheadings or format as the Section 8 List, and it was not produced using the same \ndatabase or staff person.  \n \n  Testimony of DeLoatch:  Tr. August 18, 2009, pp.310-314. \n7.  As of July 2008, HANH Section 8 Specialists had not been trained to offer an \nAUL to disabled Section 8 households unless directly asked for it. \n \nEVIDENCE: \n \n  Testimony of Lashanda Jones: Joint Ex. 19, Depo. Tr. pp. 68-69 \n \n  Testimony of  Heiwa Salovitz:  Tr. August 21, 2009, pp.1047-1048. \n \n  Testimony of Iris Santiago:  [Cite to be provided upon completion of transcript]. \n \n \n10.  Until at least September 2008, HANH front desk receptionists, if asked by \nmembers of the public for an accessible unit listing, responded that there is no such \nlisting.  \n \nEVIDENCE:  \n  Affidavit of Terri Ford:  \n  Ex. 44: In February of 2008, Terri Ford asked for a listing of accessible Section 8 \nhousing. A HANH employee told her that there was no such listing. \n  Testimony of Ed Calvin:  Tr. August 18, 2009, pp. 300-303. \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 247    Filed 04/07/10   Page 5 of 7\n  Ex. 45:   Documents provided to Ford and Calvin. \nC.  ANALYSIS \n  The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendants provided a \nvaluable service to the non-disabled community that they refused to provide to the \ndisabled community. This service is a listing of apartments whose owners are willing to \nrent to Section 8 participants, updated monthly. Such listing includes the date that the \napartment is expected to become available, a piece of information that is obviously \ncritical to the usefulness of the listing.  See Ex. 46, July 1, 2008 Section 8 Listing.  \nDefendants, in response to the plaintiffs’ lawsuits, have created separate lists for the \ndisabled. Yet these lists have never included availability information, and as such are in \nthe classic sense, “separate, but not equal.”  \n  While the defendants managed to produce some confusion about which staff \nmembers produced which versions of the court-ordered lists, they ultimately offered no \nevidence to contradict plaintiffs’ showing that such lists were never distributed—despite \nthis Court’s order (#24) requiring distribution to the public. Similarly, even the \ndefendants concede that they do not update the disabled listing, in the same manner that \nthey do the non-disabled listings.  See Ex. 52 (DeLoatch Excel Spreadsheet, containing \nthe notation “Last updated August 5, 2008”). \n  The defendants owe the plaintiffs at least the basic dignity of a comparable listing, \nand thereby a fighting chance to find an accessible Section 8 apartment. \n \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 247    Filed 04/07/10   Page 6 of 7\nD.  CONCLUSION \n  Plaintiffs respectfully move this Court to make additional factual findings in \naccord with the weight of the evidence, which has been summarized and cited above. \n          ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS \n          /s/________________________ \n          Jennifer C.

SWIFT,  Lynch,  Traub,  Keefe  & \nErrante,  New  Haven,  Connecticut, \nfor  Defendants-Appellees. \nPER  CURIAM: \nPlaintiffs-appellants,  Rebecca  Taylor,  Karl \nHunter,  and  Heiwa  Salovitz  (\"plaintiffs\"),  commenced  this \naction,  alleging  that  defendants-appellees,  the  Housing \nAuthority  of  the  City of  New  Haven  (\"HANH\")  and  a  group  of \nHANH  officials  (\"defendants\"),  discriminated against  them  in \nadministering New  Haven's  Housing  Choice  Voucher  (\"Section \n8\")  program,  in violation of  plaintiffs'  rights  under  the \nFair  Housing  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(d);  the  Fair Housing \nAmendments  Act  of  1988  (the  \"FHAA\") ,  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(f); \nand  §  504  of  the  Rehabilitation Act  of  1973,  29  U.S.C.  § \n794;  and  regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  24  C.F.R.  §§ \n8.28,  100.204.  After  a  nine-day  bench  trial,  the  district \ncourt  entered  judgment  on March  29,  2010,  finding  in  favor \nof  defendants  on  all  claims  and vacating  its earlier class \ncertification order.  See  Taylor v.  Hous.  Auth.  of  New  Haven \n(Taylor  II),  267  F.R.D.  36,  75-76  (D.  Conn.  2010),  vacating \nTaylor v.  Hous.  Auth.  of  New  Haven  (Taylor  I),  257  F.R.D.  23 \n(D.  Conn.  2009).  The  facts  and  procedural  history of  this \n-2-\n\ncase  are  fully  set  forth  in  the  district court's  opinion  in \nTaylor  II,  familiarity with which  is  assumed. \nOn  appeal,  plaintiffs  challenge  the  district \ncourt's  (1)  conclusion  that  24  C.F.R.  §§  8.28  and  100.204 \nmay  not  be  privately enforced  through  42  U.S.C.  §  1983;  (2) \nanalysis  of  Taylor's  intentional  discrimination  claim under \nthe  FHAA;  (3)  factual  findings  regarding  the  provision  of \nSection  8  services  to  the  class;  (4)  rulings  on  certain \ndiscovery  issues;  and  (5)  decertification. \nThis  Court  has  not  addressed  the  private \nenforceability of  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment  (\"HUD\")  regulations  at  issue here  or  the  private \nenforceability of  agency  regulations  generally  since  the \nSupreme  Court's  decision  in Alexander  v.  Sandoval,  532  U.S. \n275  (2001).  The  Sandoval  Court  held  that  a  regulation may \nbe  privately enforced  if it  \"invoke[s]  a  private  right  of \naction  that  Congress  through  statutory text  created.\"  Id. \nat  291.  In  other words,  a  right  of  action  \"can  extend no \nfurther  than\"  the  personal  right  conferred by  the  plain \nlanguage  of  the  statute.  Taylor  II,  267  F.R.D.  at  42-43; \nsee  Gonzaga  Univ.  v.  Doe,  536  U.S.  273,  283  (2002); \nSandoval,  532  U.S.  at  291  (\"Agencies  may  play  the  sorcerer's \napprentice  but  not  the  sorcerer himself.\");  see  also  Mark  H. \nv.  Lemahieu,  513  F.3d  922,  935  (9th Cir.  2008)  (\"Sandoval \ninstructs  that whether  the  §  504  regulations  are  privately \n-3-\n\nenforceable will  turn  on  whether  their requirements  fall \nwithin  the  scope  of  the  prohibition contained  in  §  504 \nitself. \" ) . \nWe  adopt  the  district court's  carefully considered \nand  thorough  discussion  of  these  issues.  See  Taylor  II,  267 \nF.R.D.  at  40-47,  52-54;  see  also  Three  Rivers  Ctr.  for \nIndep.  Living,  Inc.  v.  Hous.

See Ex. 1, 2, and 3.  No \ngenuine issue of material fact or possible defense remains unexplored.  Rather, a question \nof legal accountability is the sole issue to be resolved: Can the defendants be liable for \nfailing to follow HUD’s directives to assist disabled Section 8 voucher holders who are \nunable to effectively search for accessible housing themselves?  The attached \ndocumentary evidence in the form of public documents, signed correspondence and \nsworn statements made by the defendants’ own staff provides ample evidence that the \ndefendants currently refuse to assist disabled families who request help locating \napartments to lease under the section 8 program.  In doing so, the defendants choose to \noperate in a manner that is at odds with HUD’s interpretation of the Fair Housing Act \nAmendments, the Rehabilitation Act, and 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a)(3).  The plaintiffs suffering \nfrom this legal stand off desperately need to have it resolved as rapidly as possible.  \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 2 of 27\n \n \nI.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n  The plaintiffs set forth all relevant facts in the attached Local Rule 56(a)(1) \nStatement of Facts. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARDS \n  A.  Summary Judgment \n  Summary judgment is available to fair housing plaintiffs where the \ndefendants fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning the existence of \na “pattern and practice” discrimination claim.  United States v. Incorporate Village \nof Island Park, 888 F.Supp. 419, 449 (E.D.N.Y. 1995).  Summary judgment or \npartial summary judgment is permitted “if, when ‘[v]iewing the evidence \nproduced in the light most favorable to the nonmovant ... a rational trier could not \nfind for the nonmovant.’ Binder v. Long Island Lighting Co., 933 F.2d 187, 191 \n(2d Cir.1991).” Clarkson v. Coughlin, 898 F.Supp. 1019, (S.D.N.Y. 1995); Algie \nv. RCA Global Communications, Inc., 891 F.Supp. 875 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).  All \nevidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, yet \nthe nonmovant “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical \ndoubt as to the material facts.” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., \n475 U.S. 574, 587(1986).  \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 3 of 27\n  B.  Preliminary Injunction \n  Preliminary injunctive relief is available to a plaintiff if she is “likely to \nsuffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted and ‘either (1) likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of its case, or (2) sufficiently serious questions going to the \nmerits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping \ndecidedly in favor’ of the party requesting preliminary relief.”  K.P. v.  Juzwic, \n891 F. Supp. 703, 710 (D. Conn. 1995).  Likelihood of success does not mean \ncertainty of success; a greater than fifty percent probability of success is sufficient.   \nAbdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d Cir. 1985).   Housing \ndiscrimination “almost always results in irreparable injury.” Gresham v.  \nWindrush Partners, Ltd., 730 F.2d 1417, 1424 (11th Cir.); Ruiz v. New Garden \nTownship, 232 F. Supp. 2d 418, 428-29 (E.D. Pa.  1984).  “[W]here a plaintiff \ndemonstrates a likelihood of success on the merits of a fair housing claim, \nirreparable injury may be presumed.” Forest City Daly Housing, Inc. v.  Town of \nHempstead, 175 F.3d 144, 153 )2d Cir. 1999).  Violation of a federal statute or \nregulation is irreparable harm as a matter of law.  See Concerned Residents of \nTaylor Wythe v. New York City Housing Authority, 1996 WL 452432  at *3 \n(S.D.N.Y. August 9, 1996) (citing Hueblin, Inc. v. Federal Trade Comm’n, 539 \nF.Supp. 123, 128 (D. Conn.  1982)). \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 4 of 27\n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  The Defendants Offer Less Housing Search Assistance to the Disabled Than \n  to the Non-Disabled, in Violation of 42 U.S.C. §3604(f). \n \n  1.  Mobility Counseling Services. \n  The defendants take the position that “The housing authority does not do housing \nsearches.”  See Exhibit B to Complaint. They have claimed repeatedly in legal pleadings \nthat providing housing search assistance to Section 8 tenants is so contrary to the vision \nand purpose of the Section 8 program as to constitute a “fundamental alteration” of it: \nThe plaintiffs are asking the Housing Authority to take an action which is \noutside the requirements of the Section 8 Program.  As can be seen from \nthe information contained in the administrative plan for the program, \nreferred to in the Affidavit of Mr. Heinrichs and attached as an exhibit to \nthe Affidavit, there is no requirement under the law that the Housing \nAuthority find a place for any member of the Section 8 program and then \nmove the family to that location.”  Docket # 55, Gaither v. HANH, 3:07-\ncv-667 (WWE). \n \nIn fact, housing authorities have been assisting Section 8 tenants in with specialized \nhousing searches or in finding hard-to-find types of housing for over two decades, with \nexcellent success.  See, e.g., Wallace v. Chicago Housing Authority, 298 F.Supp. 2d 710 \n(N.D. Ill. 2003) Walker v. HUD, 734 F.Supp. 1231 (N.D. Texas 1989).  Search assistance \nis an important tool in helping the Section 8 program meet its goals of allowing families \nexercise the freedom to move to unfamiliar neighborhoods, become more fully integrated \ninto mainstream society, and receive numerous benefits like decent quality housing and \nsafer streets.  HANH itself has commented on publicly on why Section 8 participants \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 5 of 27\nneed search assistance.  A 2003 study of local housing needs co-authored by HANH \nstated:  “HANH needs additional housing search assistance resources to serve all section \n8 participants who would benefit.  HANH considers housing search assistance to be a \ncritical tool for helping participant families to lease-up.”  Ex. 8 at 44. \n  So many housing authorities now provide search assistance to certain participants \nin their Section 8 programs that private companies now exist that offer search assistance \nto housing authorities nation-wide.  See Ex. 23. Yet HANH persists in claiming that \nproviding search assistance to disabled households like Ms. Taylor’s would \nfundamentally alter the Section 8 program.  Incredibly, not only do the defendants know \nvery well that such organizations exist, but one mobility counseling company actually \nlists HANH as a star client on its web site. See Ex 23.  The decision by Housing \nOpportunities Unlimited to feature HANH on its web site as a client reflects HANH’s \nhistory as a repeat client that has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on such services \nbetween 2004 and 2007.  Id. at p. 2; Ex. 9.  Unfortunately, those services were rarely \noffered to disabled families Section 8 who needed to find accessible housing, and then \nonly in response to litigation.  \n  HANH’s position is not based on lack of funding. In addition to the $15,000,000  \nbudget surplus currently enjoyed by HANH, see Ex. 10,  it had entered into a contract \nwith a mobility counseling firm, Housing Opportunities Unlimited. The contract provided \nfor  $100,000  per  year  to  be  spent  on  mobility  counseling  services  for  Section  8 \nparticipants, from June 2004 through October 2007.  See Ex. 7. The existence of this \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 6 of 27\nsearch assistance contract shows that HANH was  always in a position to assist the \nplaintiffs, and had long been receiving special funding from HUD for this purpose. Thus, \nthe Housing Opportunities Unlimited contract was effective and the mobility counseling \nservices available when the Gaither, Hampton, and Stokes-Hall households first sought a \nreasonable accommodation in 2006.   See Ex. 1, 2, and 3. \n  Yet the defendants chose not to use the service to serve disabled household until \nnine months later, after a specific request to do so by a federal judge.  On August 28, \n2007, when the defendant  Commissioners voted to extend mobility counseling services \nto the Gaither and Stokes-Hall families, each had filed actions against HANH at the \nConnecticut  Commission  on  Human  Rights  and  Opportunities  (“CHRO”),  HUD’s \nidentified  local  clearinghouse  for  discrimination  complaints.  See  Ex.  1  and  3.  Ms. \nGaither’s  case  had  been  the  subject  of  three  status  conference  calls  with  federal \nMagistrate Judge Holly Fitzsimmons during August of 2007 alone.  Accordingly, the \nAugust 28, 2007 minutes for the Commission actually specify that this vote occurred \nbecause  “HUD  has  directed  HANH  to  provide  immediate  relocation  services  to  a \nspecifically named family.”1  Id. at p.1 \n                                                 \n1  Though referred to only indirectly in the August 28, 2007 minutes, at the time of this \nvote, the Gaither family had informed HANH of their intent to file a motion for \npreliminary injunction against HANH for failing to offer such services to a disabled \nhousehold within the next week.  They did so on September 4, 2007. The court ruled in \nthe defendants’ favor on the issue of mobility counseling on September 19, 2007.  Having \nreceived word that the Court had ruled in their favor, the defendants stopped providing \nmobility counseling services to the Gaither family.  See Ex.6. \n \n  6 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 7 of 27\n  This vote represented a calculated effort by the commissioners to offer the \nminimum of mobility counseling necessary to appear to have altered the defendants’ \nillegal practices.  The minutes make clear that the commissioners did not merely ratify \nthe course recommended by Executive Director Miller.  Rather, the minutes include an \nexchange between Commissioner Solomon and the Reasonable Accommodations \nCoordinator William Heinrichs in which Heinrichs tries to convince the Commission to \nassist additional families that he has identified as needing the same  mobility counseling \nservices. Id.  Even though these families have not taken any legal action against HANH,  \nHeinrichs avers that he has obtained the approval of “management” to use the mobility \ncounseling services to benefit them, and that the language of the resolution is open-ended \nenough to encompass such an approach. Id.  Commissioner Solomon reacts by proposing \nto revise the resolution, saying “why don’t we assist the families specifically named by \nHUD.”  Id. The Commissioners then vote in accord with Commissioner Solomon’s \nproposal to provide mobility counseling services only those who have commenced legal \naction against HANH. Id.  \n  The vote to revise the resolution to exclude the additional families in need of \nassistance was unanimous, despite the fact that the discussion had already made clear that \nthe mobility counseling contract had over $57,000 of unused capacity—funding already \nbudgeted by HANH for such services . Ex. 9 at p. 1.  According to the minutes, none of \nthe Commissioners commented in supported of Henrichs’ effort to extend mobility \ncounseling to disabled families who had not filed suit. Id. at p. 2.  Instead, the \n  7 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 8 of 27\ncommissioners chose to continue HANH’s decades-long practice of blatantly hoarding \nresources for the benefit of the politically vocal elderly at the expense of the disabled.  \nSee HUD 504 Investigative Report, attached as Ex. A to Complaint; Ex. 19. \n  2.  Current Listing of Available, Accessible Apartments  \n  For over two years, the defendants have been told by HUD and numerous other \nadvocates and agencies that they have an obligation to provide disabled Section 8 \nhouseholds with an apartment listing that is at least as complete and up-to-date as the list \nthey routinely provide to non-disabled Section 8 households.  Their answer each time has \nbeen the same: we will.  Each time, HANH claims that they are in the midst of doing a \nsurvey of landlords that will finally provide them with an accessible apartment listing.  \nYet each time another judge or agency prods HANH to produce the results of said survey, \nthey simply promise once again that they are about to complete it.  In 2003, a study co-\nauthored by HANH included the following bullet point in a list of actions that it intended \nto take to improve fair housing in New Haven: “development of an accurate listing of \naccessible and adaptable housing units available in the City . . . This listing should build \nupon the existing Housing Authority inventory listing.”  See Ex. 8 at p. 7.  Accordingly, \non August 14, 2006, defendant Jimmy Miller represented to the City of New Haven \nCommission on Disabilities that HANH “will be conducting a survey” on the issue of \naccessible housing stock for Section 8 participants. See Ex. 19  at p. 2, fourth paragraph. \nOn October 9, 2007, HANH reported to HUD as part of its obligations under the 2007 \nVoluntary Compliance Agreement that “HANH shall compile a list of units that are \n  8 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 9 of 27\naccessible to persons with disabilities. . . . The list will identify what features of such unit \nare accessible (i.e. wheelchair accessible).  The HANH listing form for landlords to list \navailable units has questions addressing this objective. . . We are reviewing this form to \nmake improvements and will conduct a mailing to landlords.” See Ex. 13  at p. 2, last two \nparagraphs.   Three months later, on January 30, 2008, William Heinrichs of HANH \noffered as an update that “I’ve also drafted and haven’t had time to put out yet a \nquestionnaire to all Section 8 landlords asking as to what accessible units they own.” See \nEx. 6  at p. 14, lines 14-17. And finally, five years after it was first mentioned, on March \n27, 2008, the defendants issued Supplemental Compliance to Discovery Requests in \nwhich they note that “A copy of a survey sent to 1,444 owners and property managers in \nthe New Haven in regard to rental units. The survey was sent out in February 2008 and as \nof this time, over 700 responses have been received.” See Ex.14  at p. 2, #6(3). \nRemarkably, after repeatedly claiming that the survey was necessary to create the listing, \nthe defendants still do not offer any apartment listings based on the survey responses. See \nEx. 5 and 16 at p. 5.   \n  Ultimately, HANH’s empty promises to produce a listing in the future are \nirrelevant.  As other courts have observed, there is a point at which delay in providing \nhousing-related services turns into a denial of those services. Langlois v. Abington \nHousing Authority, 207 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2000); Groome Resources, Ltd., L.L.C. v.  \nParish of Jefferson, 234 F.3d 192, 199 (5th Cir. 2000); Matyasovszky v. Housing \nAuthority of the City of Bridgeport, 226 F.R.D. 35, 45-46 (D.Conn. 2005). On two \n  9 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 10 of 27\nseparate occasions in the past four months, HANH staff who were asked by members of \nthe public for the accessible apartment listing responded that there is no such listing.  See, \ne.g., Ex. 5. After two years, the defendants’ continual promises to provide a listing in the \nfuture have become no more than a technique for distracting from the reality that HANH \ndoes not and has never provided the required listing. \n3.  Repeated Discrimination Shows Sufficient Intent for Liability. \n \n  Intent to discriminate can be inferred from a pattern of conduct alone, for \npurposes of the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988. “Factors to be considered in \nevaluating a claim of intentional discrimination include: “(1) the discriminatory impact of \nthe governmental decision; (2) the decision’s historical background; (3) the specific \nsequence of events leading up to the challenged decision; (4) departures from the normal \nprocedural sequences; and (5) departures from normal substantive criteria.” Tsombanidis \nv. West Haven Fire Dep’t, 352 F.3d 565, 579-80 (2d Cir. 2003).  In the present case, the \ndefendants continue to violate the law until sued, and to repeatedly alter their policy only \non a case-by-case basis.  The defendants’ knowledge of the illegality of their policy, \ncombined with a pattern of responses expressly aimed at neutralizing or settling lawsuits \nrather than adjusting the illegal policy, creates a strong basis for inferring intent to \ndiscriminate. Such knowledge is sufficient to show intent under §3604(f)(2)2 of the Fair \n                                                 \n2  42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(2) provides that “. . . [I]t shall be unlawful— \n(f)(2) To discriminate against any person . . . in the provision of services or facilities in \nconnection with [a] dwelling, because of a handicap of—  \n(A) that person; or  \n  10 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 11 of 27\nHousing Amendments Act, and a showing of intent is unnecessary to create liability \nunder §3604(f)(3)3.  See Id.; accord, Wisconsin Community Services, Inc. v. City of \nMilwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 747-50, 753 (7th Cir. 2006). \nB.  The Defendants Refuse Comply with 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a)(3). \n  HUD has asked  HUD on three separate occasions by HUD to stop violating 24 \nC.F.R. §8.28(a)(3) by refusing to assist disabled Section 8 participants who need help \nlocating an apartment to lease under the program.  See, e.g., Ex. A to Complaint; Ex. 19 \nand 20.  The defendants also openly admit their policy of refusing to provide accessible \napartment listings to disabled families or perform housing searches, see Ex. B to \nComplaint.  In light of the amount of energy that HUD and other agencies have put into \ninforming HANH of the specific actions required by 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a)(3), these \npositions can only be described as willful noncompliance.   \n  1.  The Commissioners understand how to comply with 24 C.F.R. §  \n    8.28(a)(3), but have chosen not to do so.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                \n(B) a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or \nmade available. . .” \n \n \n3  42 U.S.C. §3604(f)(2) provides that“(f) (3) For purposes of this subsection, \ndiscrimination includes. . . .  \n(B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, \nwhen such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to \nuse and enjoy a dwelling. . . ”  \n \n \n  11 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 12 of 27\n  The Second Circuit has consistently held that deference is due to the interpretation \nthat a federal agency, such as HUD, gives its regulations. See, e.g., Shapiro v. Cadman \nTowers, 844 F. Supp. 116,  aff’d, 51 F.3d 328, (2d Cir. 1995); see generally Chevron \nU.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 844, (1984).  For \nexample, in Liddy v. Cisneros, the court rejected a plaintiff who urged the court to \ninterpret a regulatory interpretation in way that contradicted HUD guidance, stating:  \nA federal agency's interpretation of its own regulations is ‘ “of controlling \nweight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.’  \nUdall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17 (1965) ; . . . Soler v. G. & U., Inc., \n833 F.2d 1104, 1108 (2d Cir.1987) (“Even if a court concludes that its \nalternative construction of the agency's  regulation is ‘more equitable’ or \n‘more reasonable,’ the agency's interpretation of its regulation is not \nthereby rendered invalid”) (citations omitted),  cert. denied, 488 U.S.  832 \n(1988). 823 F.Supp. 164, 174 (S.D.N.Y. 1993). \n \n  The defendants regularly receive messages from HUD and other agencies \nattempting to correct HANH’s failure to comply with 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a)(3). See Ex. 6,9, \n12, 13, 19, 20 and 21.  Nevertheless, the defendant commissioners have shown no \nconcern that HANH refuses to acknowledge HUD’s interpretation of 24 C.F.R. \n§8.28(a)(3), even going out of their way to keep HANH management from adopting a \nnew policy of compliance on August 28, 2007.  As discussed infra in section A.1 of this \nbrief, the commissioners were presented with a resolution proposed by HANH’s \nmanagement that would have authorized extending the services of a mobility counseling \nfirm to all the Section 8 households with disabled members who needed it.  See Ex.9. \nWithout any case-by-case analysis or apparent concern for why the particular disabled \n  12 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 13 of 27\nfamilies involved needed mobility counseling services, the commissioners rejected the \nplan.  Id.  Because HANH chooses not to devote any of its own manpower to providing \nsearch assistance, their vote was tantamount to a decision not to provide the disabled \nfamilies with any search assistance at all.  See Ex. 6 at p. 2. The August 28, 2007 vote \ndemonstrates yet again that the defendants’ standard practice is to refuse all search \nassistance to disabled families, unless and until the family obtains legal assistance and \nnotifies HUD.  The named plaintiff is just the latest in a line of families that have \nexperienced the human cost of this strategy.  \n  2.  Noncompliance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) is politically expedient. \n  In the absence of background information, HANH’s decision not to help the \ndisabled Section 8 population to determine whether an accessible unit is available might \nseem so irrational that it could only be the product of some legitimate disagreement or \nambiguity in the regulation.  Why would HANH, whose mission is to help vulnerable \npopulations such as the disabled choose to provide less assistance to persons with \nmobility disabilities than to the general population?  The answer is because such a listing \nwould show that there are only a handful of accessible units available to disabled people \nin New Haven.  In turn, this lack of available units exposes the Housing Authority to an \nadditional form of liability.  A 2007 Investigative 504 Report by HUD explains the issue, \nhaving concluded that HANH is in violation of its responsibilities to the disabled, as \nfollows: \n  13 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 14 of 27\nHUD is also concerned that a substantial amount of HANH’s accessible \nhousing stock is grouped in developments that are subject to an elderly-\nonly Designated Housing Plan. While the plan calls for housing the non-\nelderly disabled with Section 8 vouchers, there is no evidence that the \nnon-elderly disabled have been provided with such certificates.  There \nwere further questions raised regarding HANH’s provision of assistance to \nnon-elderly disabled to assist in locating accessible properties eligible for \nSection 8 assistance that meet the needs of non-elderly persons with \ndisabilities. . . . The Section 504 Regulations at 24 C.F.R. 8.28 govern the \nrecipient’s obligations in administering Section 8 certificates or vouchers.  \nThe reviewer did not find evidence that HANH is fulfilling these \nobligations.  See Ex. A to Complaint. \n \nIn other words, HANH itself helped create to the shortage of privately owned accessible \nunits available for rental by Section 8 households. HANH regularly asks HUD for \npermission to reserve even more public housing units exclusively for the elderly, see Ex. \n8 at p. 33 and 52.  These requests are made in spite of the fact that HANH itself \nacknowledges that “public units. . .are now experiencing vacancies and declining \napplications from elderly families,” and observes the opposite trend for its disabled client \npopulation.  Id. Defendant Miller observed in 2006 that applications from persons with \ndisabilities had been increasing, which suggests they now exceed the 35% mark reached \nin 2003.  See  Ex. 12 at p.2 ; Ex. 8 at p. 14. In order to obtain from HUD politically \npopular “elderly-only” designations for its public housing complexes, HANH repeatedly \npromises to make up the loss of the accessible public housing units to disabled persons by \noffering them Section 8 vouchers.  See Ex. 8 at p. 9; Ex. 13; Ex. A attached to Complaint.   \nNot only has HANH failed to follow through on providing these extra Section 8 \nvouchers, as HUD points out in the quoted paragraph above, but the existing Section 8 \n  14 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 15 of 27\nvouchers have turned out to be meaningless to households that include mobility-impaired \nindividuals who cannot find any available accessible units on the private market.  In \n2003, HANH participated in a HUD-required “Analysis of Fair Housing Impediments” \nwhich concluded that Section 8 vouchers are not effective in housing the disabled unless \ncoupled with search assistance: \n. . .A significant proportion of HANH’s Section 8 participants have mental \nhealth problems and other disabilities that limit their ability to effectively \nuse their Section 8 assistance.  HANH has sought HUD grant funding for \nhousing search assistance , but, most recently in 2001, HANH’s grant \napplication was denied  because of a technical threshold requirement. Id. \nat 44. \n \nAs HANH itself recognizes, absent search assistance services, Section 8 vouchers will \nnot relieve the artificial drain on New Haven’s supply of accessible apartments that is \nimposed by HANH’s insistence on designating the majority of its accessible units as \n“elderly-only.” \n   In sum, if HANH were to distribute a list of accessible units that included a \ncolumn showing the date of availability, that list would show that there is no principled \nbasis for HANH’s claims that it can justify reserving the vast majority of the accessible \npublic housing in the City for the elderly by claiming that the needs of younger disabled \npersons are being met through the Section 8 vouchers.  The listing would expose the \ndefendants as having acted based on political pressure rather than in furtherance of their \nmission. Therefore, the defendants continue to refuse to provide a listing of accessible \n  15 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 16 of 27\napartments that includes current availability information, even though their duty to do so \ncould hardly be clearer under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3). \n  3.  The database is ready, but HANH refuses to create the listing. \n  Since 1994, HANH has been promising to create a database to produce the current \nlistings of available accessible units required by HUD.  See Ex. 21.  After fourteen years, \nHANH’s reasons for not yet having completed this task are neither technical nor funding-\nrelated.  See Ex. 10. On January 30, 2008, HANH staff member William Heinrichs \nadmitted under deposition that HANH already has such a database, and that the database \nalready contains the necessary field for entering accessibility features.  See Ex.6 at p. 3. \nThus, the database could easily print out a listing of accessible apartments.  In fact, \nHANH did so in response to a court order on September 21, 2007.  See Ex. 18.   \nHowever, in its most recently published Administrative Plan, HANH stated that it is still \nnot ready to share the data on accessibility with the public or even internally with its own \nstaff.  See Ex. 16 at p.5; Ex. 24.   \n  4.  The Listing would help the plaintiff class. \n  The named plaintiff’s circumstances illustrate why the absence of even the most \nbasic form of assistance HANH could give in locating an apartment—a list of the type \nthat the defendants readily provide to non-disabled Section 8 families—makes it harder \nfor disabled families to use their Section 8 vouchers. See Ex. 4  at ¶ 9, 10 and 13-16.  For \nRebecca Taylor—a  person who  for whom even telephone service is not always \naffordable, much less access to the internet to perform online searches—an accurate, \n  16 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 17 of 27\ncurrent listing of accessible apartments could make all the difference.  But even disabled \npersons who have the ability to perform online searches need HANH’s listing in order to \nhave an equal opportunity to lease an apartment through the Section 8 program. The \nreason that HANH, like every other urban housing authority in the nation, supplies its \ncurrent apartment listings to non-disabled families is precisely because such lists are so \neffective in connecting tenants to landlords who are ready and willing to rent to Section 8 \ntenants. See Ex. 7, 8, 11 and 23.  Simply put, the listings greatly cut down on the literal \n“leg work” it takes to find an apartment.   \n  The timesaving component of the listings produced by housing authorities \nbecomes even more crucial where the Section 8 voucher is in the hands of a disabled \nhouseholder.  Unable to leave her home, Rebecca Taylor cannot simply visit advertised \napartments to determine whether they are accessible. Ex. 4, at ¶ 6, 8 and 9.  Because \naccessibility features are rarely included in the limited space of a newspaper classified ad, \nher search for apartments becomes very much like the proverbial search for a needle in a \nhaystack. Id. By the time she finally locates a viable apartment, it has invariably already \nbeen rented.  See Ex. 4 at ¶ 10 and 11.   A current listing of such apartments from HANH \ncould by itself have eliminated much of this problem. \n  The best that can be said of HANH’s fourteen years of refusing to comply with 24 \nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) is that HANH and its governing Commission evidence a deeply \ningrained culture of deliberate indifference to the disabled.  Injunctive relief in favor of \nthe proposed class is necessary to overcome such a culture. \n  17 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 18 of 27\nC.  The Defendants Denied Rebecca Taylor a Reasonable Accommodation. \n  The Second Circuit enumerates the elements of a claim of denying a \nreasonable accommodation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act as follows: \n“(1) the plaintiffs are ‘handicapped persons’ under the Act; (2) they are ‘otherwise \nqualified’ to participate in the offered activity or program or to enjoy the services \nor benefits offered; (3) they are being excluded from participation or enjoyment \nsolely by reason of their disability; and (4) the entity denying plaintiffs \nparticipation or enjoyment receives federal financial assistance.” Clarkson v. \nCoughlin, 898 F. Supp. 1019 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary \njudgment where civil rights violation was clear from the record).  The standard for \njudging a denial of a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Amendments \nAct is the same. Wisconsin Comm. Services, Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, 465 F.3d 737 \n(7th Cir. 2006) (en banc); Hovsons, Inc. v. Township of Brick, 89 F.3d 1096 (3rd Cir. \n1996). \n  The Second Circuit has been followed by many others in using the burden-\nshifting analysis articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 \n(1973) when a plaintiff claims that intentional discrimination occurred, but cannot \nprovide direct evidence of such intent. 2922 Sherman Avenue Tenants’ Assoc. v. District \nof Columbia, 444 F.3d 673, 682 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “Plaintiffs must show that, but for the \naccommodation, they likely will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing of \n  18 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 19 of 27\ntheir choice.”  Smith & Lee Assocs., Inc. v. City of Taylor,102 F.3d 781, 795 (6th Cir. \n1996).  The burden then shifts, such that “[t]he ultimate burden at trial of proving that a \nproposed accommodation is not reasonable or that plaintiffs cannot be accommodated \nrests with defendants.”  Assisted Living Assoc. of Moorestown, L.L.C. v. Moorestown \nTownship, 996 F. Supp. 409, 435 (D. NJ 1998). \n  As a victim of spina bifida, Rebecca Taylor is unquestionably handicapped and \ndisabled within the meanings of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Fair \nHousing Amendments Act.  See Ex. 4.  at ¶ 2. The second element is also established; \nas a current Section 8 program participant, it is clear that the named plaintiff is \n“otherwise qualified” for the program. See Ex. 4  at ¶ 3.  Similarly, the fourth element—\nreceipt of federal funding by HANH—has been admitted by HANH in numerous \ndocuments.  See Ex. 16 at p. 1. \n  Proof of the remaining element comes from a series of events. The Taylor family \nasked for a reasonable accommodation twice.  First, Ms. Taylor made her request orally, \nexplaining in detail why she needs the assistance and her reasons for believing that \nforeclosure would force her to move very soon.  This request was denied on the spot by a \nHANH staff person. See Ex. 4 at ¶ 13-14. \n  Ms. Taylor’s second attempt to request a reasonable accommodation has been \nconstructively denied, through delay.  “[D]elay for practical purposes may be denial.” \nLanglois v. Abington Housing Authority, 207 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 2000); Groome \nResources, Ltd., L.L.C. v.  Parish of Jefferson, 234 F.3d 192, 199 (5th Cir. 2000).  On \n  19 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 20 of 27\nMarch 14, Ms. Taylor tried again to explain her situation to HANH, this time in writing.  \nHer request was successfully submitted to HANH that same day, as verified by the fax \ntransmission report.  See Ex. 17.  More than thirty days later, HANH has made no \nresponse whatsoever to her plea.  HANH’s own procedural manual, the Administrative \nPlan, states that it will respond to reasonable accommodation requests within thirty days.  \nSee Ex. 16, p. 2.   In addition, it is obvious on the face of Ms. Taylor’s written request \nthat waiting longer than thirty days could cause her family great harm.  Together, these \nevents establish the third and final element of her claim under Count II.   \n  If a requested accommodation is necessary before a disabled individual can derive \nbenefit from the program, then denying such request is a form of disability \ndiscrimination.   Here, the Section 8 voucher cannot serve its purpose of saving Ms. \nTaylor from homelessness and integrating her into the community until someone helps \nher take the threshold step of leasing an accessible apartment. Failure to timely grant her \nreasonable accommodation request for assistance in finding an accessible Section 8 \napartment has forced her to live in physical danger, and will very likely deprive her of a \nhome altogether within the next month, absent this Court’s order.  \nD.  CLASS CERTIFICATION FOR PURPOSES OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \n  The proposed plaintiff class would include “All current and future participants in \nthe Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or \nhandicaps of themselves or someone in their household, need assistance in searching for \nsuitable dwellings to lease under the program.”   \n  20 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 21 of 27\n  The burden is on the plaintiff to properly allege the prerequisites for class \ncertification, but a plaintiff has a right to class certification if the allegations contained in \nher complaint and associated filings meet the prerequisites.  United States Parole \nCommission v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 403 (1980); Sirota v. Solitron Devices, Inc., 673 \nF.2d 566, 571 (2d Cir. 1982). “Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1)-(4) sets forth \nfour prerequisites to a class action that are commonly referred to as: (1) numerosity, (2) \ncommonality, (3) typicality, and (4) adequate representation. See Hanlon v. Chrysler \nCorp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1019 (9th Cir.1998) (citing Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, \n521 U.S. 591 (1997)).”  Amone v. Aveiro, 226 F.R.D. 677, 68 (D. Haw. 2005). This \naction is appropriate for certification under Rule 23 (b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, because the plaintiffs’ pleadings meet the four prerequisites, the defendants \nhave refused to act “on grounds generally applicable to the class,” and the plaintiffs seek \nprimarily injunctive and declaratory relief.   In the Second Circuit, a Rule 23(b)(2) class \nmay be certified even where certain plaintiff class members request compensatory or \npunitive damages, provided that injunctive relief predominates. Matyasovszky v. Housing \nAuthority of the City of Bridgeport, 226 F.R.D. 35, 45-46 (D.Conn. 2005).  Where “the \ninterests of the class members in the liability phase of [a] case would be identical,” class \ncertification may be provisionally granted during that phase of the action.   Id. \n  1.  Numerosity \n  The proposed class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” \nwithin the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Of the \n  21 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 22 of 27\n1,640 new Section vouchers that HANH issued from 2003 to 2006, 386 went to \nhouseholds that included a disabled person.  See Supplemental Compliance dated April 4, \n2008 at p. 2.  These figures suggest that at least 24% of HANH’s total 4,500 population \nof Section 8 participants include a disabled person, yielding a class size of 1,080.  HANH \nreported in 2003 that 35% of  its applicants for public housing were disabled, a number \nthat suggests that the true number of Section 8 participant families that include a disabled \nperson might be closer to 1,575.  In addition, the defendant’s records confirm that at least \n75 new vouchers were issued to households that include a disabled member during each \nyear from 2003 to 2006.  Id. at p. 1.  It is therefore likely that at least 75 new class \nmembers will be added to the class over the course of 2008. Thus the class, while fluid, \nnevertheless comprises between 1,466 and 1,961  voucher-holders and participants at any \ngiven moment.  Moreover, the plaintiff class members are by definition persons who not \nonly struggle to meet basic needs because of their low income levels, but also suffer from \nextreme isolation by virtue of living in non-accessible apartments or from other \ndisability-related impediments.   The impracticability and inefficiency of joinder as a \nmethod of adjudicating the claims of such persons is also a relevant consideration.  \nRobidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936 (2d Cir. 1993). \n  2.  Commonality \n   The proposed class has been subjected to identical or similar treatment by the \ndefendants, such that  “there are questions of law or fact common to the class” within the \nmeaning of Rule 23 (a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The plaintiff class \n  22 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 23 of 27\nalleges that they have been treated identically with respect to the two services mandated \nby 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3): apartment listings and mobility counseling. Each complainant \nto HUD and the CHRO called or wrote to her Section 8 worker requesting help finding an \naccessible apartment—a request, in lay person’s terms, for apartment listings and \nmobility counseling.  See Ex. 1, 2 and 3.  Each was ignored for months or years until they \nfiled a CHRO complaint.  Id. The glaring similarity between how the plaintiffs have been \ntreated was highlighted on August 28, 2007, when the defendant commissioners met to \ndiscuss HUD’s order to provide mobility counseling to the Gaither household.  Of the \ngroup of disabled families that HANH staff member William Heinrichs identified as \nneeding mobility counseling, the commissioners would only agree to offer the service to \nthe two who had pending CHRO suits.  Rather than discussing the five based on their \nindividual needs and characteristics, the defendant commissioners treated the group \nidentically based on its well-established practice of only assisting disabled persons when \nnecessary to evade legal scrutiny.  See Ex. 9. \n  3.  Typicality \n  The claims of named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor are “typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  As described above and in detail in her affidavit, see Ex. 4, plaintiff Rebecca \nTaylor’s housing needs and experience with HANH is typical of the class.  Cf. Ex. 1, 2 \nand 3. \n  4.  Adequacy \n  23 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 24 of 27\n  The named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor will “fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  The named plaintiff has diligently sought legal advice from appropriate \nsources, see Ex. 22 at ¶ 3-4, and   Ex. 4 at ¶ 12,  and has shown herself to be ready to \nvigorously protect the interests of the class.  Id. \nE.  NECESSITY OF EMERGENCY SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND/OR \n  PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n    1.  Irreparable harm to the named plaintiff. \n  The Housing Authority is well aware of the named plaintiff’s immediate need for \nassistance.  See Ex. 4 at ¶ 13-16; Ex. 17.  Prior to the events that triggered this lawsuit, \nHANH had been aware of Rebecca Taylor’s extremely dangerous current housing \narrangement for years, inasmuch as its staff had inspected the apartment, and seen that it \nhas stairs at all points of egress. The Section 8 worker assigned to Ms. Taylor has met on \na yearly basis with Ms. Taylor, who is always confined to a wheelchair.  While it is \ntroubling enough that these staff members ignored Ms. Taylor’s obvious need for an \naccessible apartment, it is outrageous that Ms. Taylor’s Section 8 worker directly refused \nto help her find a new apartment before she is ejected due to foreclosure.  \n  That Ms. Taylor’s fears of being ejected and put into a homeless shelter are \ngrounded in reality is demonstrated by the existence of an uncontested motion for strict \nforeclosure pending against her landlord.  See Exhibit D to Complaint. As the case detail \nprintout demonstrates, the landlord for Ms. Taylor’s building has failed to even file an \n  24 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 25 of 27\nappearance in the proceeding.  Id. This motion will likely be acted upon today, April 21, \n2008. Foreclosure and ejection are virtually certain to follow.  Ms. Taylor is suffering \nemotionally before this even occurs, because she believes that ejection and placement in a \nhomeless shelter will put her at risk of losing custody of her daughter. See Ex. 3 at ¶ 7.  \nThese facts justify emergency summary judgment and preliminary injunctive relief. \n    2.  Irreparable harm to the proposed class. \n  Families who are headed by disabled persons, or preoccupied with the care of a \nprofoundly disabled child, are more vulnerable to homelessness because resources they \nmight otherwise be able to devote to locating appropriate housing are drained by dealing \nwith the disability.  Such families generally also lack the time, money, and energy to \nobtain the advice of counsel concerning their housing problems. The Taylor household \nexemplifies these issues.  See Ex. 3. Requiring the defendants to retrain and monitor the \nSection 8 staff who interact with disabled families is justified, given the defendants’ long \nhistory of noncompliance with their obligations to this group.  See Ex. 1,2,3,4,5,13,18,19, \n20 and 21.  Moreover, staff retraining is an efficient and low-cost way to require the \ndefendants to begin preventatively meeting the needs of this group, as opposed to settling \nindividual lawsuits as they are filed.   \n  Since 2003, the defendants are aware of having issued 386 Section 8 vouchers  to \nfamilies that include persons with disabilities. See Ex. 15 at p. 3. At least 75 additional \npersons with rights to search assistance are added to this number on a weekly basis, when \nSection 8 families’ circumstances change or new applicants obtain Section 8 vouchers. \n  25 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 26 of 27\nId. at p. 1. These families are likely to need search assistance, whether currently or in the \nfuture. For most of them, Section 8 workers are their sole source of information about the \nprogram rules. It is both inhumane and a waste of judicial resources to force each of these \nfamilies to confront the defendants to separately via a lawsuit.  An injunction requiring \nthe defendants to retrain and independently monitor their Section 8 staff on the issue of \nappropriately assisting disabled families in searching for apartments is necessary to \nadequately serve the public interests at stake in this case. \nF.   WAIVER OF BOND FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF   \n  The named plaintiff’s Motion to Proceed In Forma Pauperis was granted on April \n15, 2008.  Whether to require a bond from plaintiffs in this circumstance is within the  \ndiscretion of this Court.  See Doctor’s Ass’n, Inc. v. Stuart, 85 F.3d 975 (2d Cir. 1996).  \nAs a single parent with disabilities that prevent her from working, named plaintiff \nRebecca Taylor’s income barely covers essentials.  Paying a bond would be a hardship \nupon herself and her daughter.  The plaintiffs therefore respectfully request waiver  of the \nbond. \nCONCLUSION \n  The plaintiffs move this Court for summary adjudication of the above described \nissues, and/or preliminary injunctive relief, in recognition of the gravity of the risks they \nare exposed to by HANH’s continuing noncompliance with the Fair Housing Act \nAmendments, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the National Housing Act as \namended and its implementing regulation 24 C.F.R. §8.28(a)(3).  \n  26 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 12    Filed 04/22/08   Page 27 of 27\n \n \n \n          Respectfully submitted, \n                         \n          ATTORNEY FOR THE PLAINTIFFS \n          /s/________________________ \n          Jennifer C.

Plaintiffs now move for class certification on\ntwo of their claims, which Defendants oppose.\n1 Plaintiffs also bring suit against HANH Executive Director Karen Dubois-Walton,\nformer HANH Executive Director Jimmy Miller, and five members of the Housing\nAuthority Commission for the City of New Haven (David Alvarado, Ilona Leffingwell,\nLouise Persall, Robert Solomon, and Jason Turner).\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 2 of 17\nI. Background\nHANH operates HUD’s Section 8 Program within the area of New Haven.2  Among\nthe participants in HANH’s Section 8 Program are the named plaintiffs in this suit: Ms.\nTaylor, who suffers from spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, and Mr. Hunter, who has used\na wheelchair since 1989 when he became permanently disabled after breaking his neck.  (2d\nAm. Compl. [Doc. # 81] at page 1 (Taylor); Affidavit of Karl Hunter, Ex. 2 to Hunter’s Mot.\nIntervene [Doc. # 45] (“Hunter Aff.”), at ¶ 2.)  At the time suit was brought, both had sought\nto move from the apartments in which they lived, and both claim that HANH did not help\nthem locate accessible residences and/or help them to move in the ways and to the extent to\nwhich it was obligated under federal law.  Specifically, Plaintiffs assert that HANH failed to\nprovide them with a listing of apartments that are both available and accessible to them (the\n“Accessible Unit List” or “AUL”) and failed to  inform them of the availability of, or provide\nthem with, “mobility counseling” (a service which includes helping them identify apartments\naccommodating their needs, transporting them during their apartment search, helping them\ncomplete and submit rental applications, physically moving them and their belongings to\ntheir new apartments, and providing other forms of support).  Plaintiffs allege that HANH\nhas a policy and/or practice of failing to maintain and provide an AUL, and of failing to offer\nor provide mobility counseling, to households including at least one disabled member to\n2 Defendants admit that as the administrator of the Section 8 Program for this area,\nHANH is subject to the regulations under which Plaintiffs bring this suit: 24 C.F.R.\n§§ 8.28(a)(3) and 100.204.  (Defs.’ Answer to 2d Am. Compl. [Doc. # 82] at ¶¶ 2 & 3.)\n2\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 3 of 17\nwhich HANH has issued a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher (“Disabled Section 8\nHousehold”).  In Counts I and III of their complaint,3 they allege that Defendants’ failure to\nprovide the AUL and offer and provide mobility counseling constitutes discrimination on\nthe basis of their disability4 in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), violates\nDefendants’ duty to provide Plaintiffs with “reasonable accommodations” under 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.204, and violates 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3).  (2d Am. Compl. [Doc. # 81] at ¶¶ 34–39 &\n45–50.)\nAt oral argument, the Court proposed5 a class definition which the parties agreed\nencapsulated Plaintiffs’ claims and should be the basis for analyzing whether Plaintiffs’\nMotion for Class Certification should be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n23(b)(2):\n3 Plaintiffs do not seek to certify a class as to Counts II or IV of the Second Amended\nComplaint.  (See Pls.’ Suppl. Mem. Supp. Mot. Class Cert. [Doc. # 67] at 2 n. 3.)\n4 While in some cases Congress has replaced the term “handicapped” with “the more\npolitically correct term ‘disabled,’” see Alison Nodvin Barkoff, Revisiting de jure Educational\nSegregation: Legal Barriers to School Attendance for Children with Special Health Care Needs,\n8 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 135, 141 n. 47 (1998), the terminology of the regulations at issue\nhere refer to the “handicaps” of members of households participating in the Section 8\nProgram.  See 24 C.F.R. 8.3 (defining “[h]andicap” and “[i]ndividual with handicaps” for\npurposes of, inter alia, § 8.28(a)(3)); id. § 100.201 (defining “handicapped” for purposes of,\ninter alia, § 100.204).  The parties agree that the definition of “handicap” is the same for the\npurposes of considering the regulations and statutes at issue.\n5 “It is well-established that a court has the inherent power and discretion to redefine\nand modify a class in a way which allows maintenance of an action as a class action.”  In re\nMethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Prods. Liability Litig., 241 F.R.D. 435, 438 (S.D.N.Y.\n2007).\n3\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 4 of 17\nAll households including at least one handicapped person to which the\nHousing Authority of New Haven has issued a Housing Certificate or\nHousing Voucher, and:\n(a) that did not receive a list of available, accessible apartments, as\nrequired under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, and/or 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3); and/or\n(b) that did not receive Mobility Counseling services, or offer thereof, as\nrequired under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, and/or 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3).\nFor the reasons that follow, Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification will be granted.\nII. Standards for Class Certification\n“It would seem to be beyond dispute that a district court may not grant class\ncertification without making a determination that all of the Rule 23 requirements are met.”\nIn re Initial Public Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 40 (2d Cir. 2006) (“In re IPO”).\nPlaintiffs moving for class certification must demonstrate that their proposed class\nmeets the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b).  Rule 23(a) outlines “four familiar features”\nthat must be present if a class is to be certified: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and\nadequacy of representation.  McLaughlin v. Am. Tobacco Co., 522 F.3d 215, 222 (2d Cir.\n2008); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  In addition to these four express criteria, there is an\nimplicit  but  “fundamental”  requirement  under  Rule  23(a)  that  a  certified  class  be\nascertainable, i.e., “[t]he class that plaintiffs seek to certify must be readily identifiable so that\nthe court can determine who is in the class, and thus, who is bound by the ruling.  A class\nis ascertainable when defined by objective criteria that are administratively feasible, without\na subjective determination.”  McBean v. City of New York, 228 F.R.D. 487, 492 (S.D.N.Y.\n2005).  Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2), under which their action must allege\nthat “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally\n4\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 5 of 17\nto the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate\nrespecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\nIn the Second Circuit, although a court considering a motion for class certification\nmust “assess all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class certification stage and\ndetermine whether each Rule 23 requirement has been met,” In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 42, it\nshould avoid holding “a protracted mini-trial of substantial portions of the underlying\nlitigation,” id. 41, as it seeks to obtain this evidence.  It must consider the merits of the\nlawsuit to the extent necessary to determine whether the Rule 23 requirements have been\nmet, but is precluded from considering any dispute about the suit’s merits unrelated to these\nrequirements.  Id.\nIII. Discussion\nA. Allegations of Unlawful Policies and/or Practices\nPlaintiffs allege that “HANH has failed to create [a] current list of available, accessible\napartments known to it, as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3),” and thus is unable to provide\nsuch list to households which include a disabled individual and to which it has issued a\nHousing Certificate or Housing Voucher.  (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 6.)  They further allege that\nDefendants have an unlawful a “policy, pattern and/or practice . . . toward disabled persons\non Section 8 who ask for HANH’s assistance in searching for an apartment” of not providing\nmobility counseling and instead telling such persons that “searching for an apartment [is\ntheir] responsibility under the Section 8 [P]rogram.”  (Id. ¶¶ 17–19.)\nIn support of their class certification motion Plaintiffs submit a review of HANH in\nwhich a HUD analyst stated that HANH believed, incorrectly, that it did not have “the\nresponsibility of locating accessible units” within its jurisdiction.  (HUD Investigation\n5\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 6 of 17\nReport, Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Original Compl. [Doc. # 3], at 2.)  Plaintiffs also submit a three-page\nlist Defendants provided on August 4, 2008, entitled “Accessible Housing in the New Haven\narea,” listing only street addresses with accessible apartments but not which specific units\nare accessible.  (Accessible Housing in the New Haven area, Ex. D to Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Cert.)\nThis list contains a disclaimer that HANH has not verified the information, which was self-\nreported by landlords, that it “is not comprehensive,” and that “it does not imply an\nendorsement nor a guarantee of quality or accessibility.”  It directs readers to “[c]heck with\n[each apartment’s] Rental Office for information about pricing and availability.”  In a short\nnotice for “Families Who Require Accessible Housing,” HANH offers an extension of these\nfamilies’ voucher terms as a method of “tak[ing] into account the special problem of ability\nto locate an accessible unit,” and states that it “will provide reasonable accommodations of\nour policies, procedures, practices, or services if necessary” for persons with disabilities.  (Id.)\nPlaintiffs also point to the July 2007 admission of former HANH Executive Director Jimmy\nMiller that because HANH “does not do searches for apartments,” its staff “do[es] not know\nif any [four-bedroom units in the area] are currently available.”  (Miller’s Resp. to Req.\nAdm., Ex. B to Pl.’s Original Compl., at No. 1.)  In support of the class claim regarding the\nabsence of mobility counseling, Plaintiffs submit an HANH report prepared in July 2008 in\nwhich it states that while it has published requests for proposals for mobility counseling\nservices, it is “still unsuccessful in finding a vendor who is willing to service both for families\nneeding accessible units and for families seeking to relocate to suburban areas” within its\n“newly defined service area,” and acknowledges that it has responded only to those Disabled\nSection 8 Households which have actually requested assistance searching for accessible units.\n(HANH 504 Voluntary Compliance Agreement, Four Quarterly Report, July 9, 2008, Ex. F\n6\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 7 of 17\nto Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Cert., at 2.)  Finally, Plaintiffs cite testimony of Lashanda Jones, a Section\n8 Specialist with HANH who works with individual participant households, that neither she,\nnor any other staffer she knows of, assists Disabled Section 8 Households to locate accessible\nunits.  (Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Cert. at 8–9 (citing Jones Dep., Ex. C to Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Cert., at\n68–69).)\nClaiming lack of foundation for Plaintiffs’ claim of pattern and practice, Defendants\npoint to Ms. Jones’s testimony that she responded to Disabled Section 8 Household\nmembers’ requests for reasonable accommodation made to her by assisting them in\ncompleting and submitting the paperwork necessary to formalize their requests, and that she\nhas never heard a Section 8 participant state that HANH has not helped him or her seek\naccessible housing upon request.  (Defs.’ Obj. Pls.’ Mot. Class Cert. [Doc. # 59] (“Defs.’ Obj.\nCert.”) at 6–7 (citing Jones Dep., Ex. A, at 69–74).)  However, Ms. Jones also testified that\nshe does not “have any responsibility for granting or denying a reasonable accommodations\nrequest,” but instead “pass[es] it along” to another office.  (Jones Dep., Ex. A to Defs.’ Obj.\nCert., at 74:19–23.)  Defendants also submit affidavits of Laura Woodie, HANH’s Acting\nReasonable Accommodation Coordinator, and Iris Santiago, HANH’s Service Center\nDirector, both of whom aver that they have assisted disabled Section 8 participants.  (See\nWoodie Aff., Ex. 1 to Defs.’ 2d Suppl. Mem. Supp. Obj. Pls.’ Mot. Class Cert. [Doc. # 76]\n(“Defs.’ 2d Suppl. Obj.”), at ¶¶ 2–12; Suppl. Woodie Aff. [Doc. # 87] at ¶¶ 2–4; Santiago Aff.,\nEx. 2 to Defs.’ 2d Suppl. Obj., at ¶¶ 1–9.)  Finally, Defendants provide examples of forms and\nletters that they argue “show the conduct of HANH in regard to the issue of addressing\nreasonable accommodation issues.”  (Defs.’ 2d Suppl. Obj. at 2; see also id. at Exs. 3–6.)\n7\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 8 of 17\nB. Class Certification under Rule 23(a) Requirements\ni. Ascertainability\nDefendants argue that by any definition the class is not “ascertainable” because\nHANH has no policy discriminating against Disabled Section 8 Households (Defs.’ Obj.\nCert. at 8), and because Defendants treat different individuals differently based on HANH\nstaff members’ interactions with different Section 8 participants (id. 8–9).  Defendants’\nargument misses a critical distinction between considerations of ascertainability and the\nmerits.  A class is ascertainable if its members can be identified by reference to objective\ncriteria and if such identifications can be made in an administratively feasible manner.\nMcBean, 228 F.R.D. at 492.  The questions of what HANH’s policy or practice is and whether\nit is lawful are the core merits questions of this lawsuit, and they need not be resolved to\ndetermine the ascertainability of the class.  Therefore, Defendants’ argument that no\nascertainable (or sufficiently numerous6) class exists because the challenged policy or\npractice does not exist is the argument foreclosed at the class certification stage by Eisen and\nIn  re  IPO’s  preclusion  of  consideration  of  merits  questions  unrelated  to  Rule  23\nrequirements.  See In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 41 (explaining that Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417\nU.S. 156, 177 (1974), “preclude[s] consideration of the merits . . . when a merits issue is\nunrelated to a Rule 23 requirement”).\n6 Defendants make a similar argument regarding numerosity—namely, that a\ndetermination of numerosity would be speculative because the court would have to assume\nthe existence of the alleged policy—and in fact conflate their arguments as to ascertainability\nand numerosity in their opposition to class certification.  See infra.  For the reasons\narticulated here, such argument must fail.\n8\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 9 of 17\nPlaintiffs’ claims relate to Defendants’ alleged failure to provide two distinct items:\nan Accessible Units List and mobility counseling.  In Count I of their Second Amended\nComplaint Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ failure to provide these items violates 42 U.S.C.\n§ 3604(f), a statute that bars discrimination on the basis of the disability of a person in a\nSection 8 Program participant’s household, as well as 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, a regulation that\nrequires Defendants to provide “reasonable accommodation” including services such as an\nAUL and mobility counseling.  In Count III they allege that this same failure violates 24\nC.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3), a regulation specific as to the AUL and to the provision of other\nassistance “if necessary.”  Defining the class as those who were eligible for but did not receive\neither or both of these items provides objective criteria whose applicability to a given\nhousehold can be determined in an administratively feasible manner and thus sets forth a\nsufficiently ascertainable class.\nii. Numerosity.\nA proposed class may not be certified unless “the class is so numerous that joinder\nof all members is impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1).  The Court need not determine\nthe precise number of people in the putative class in order to determine that the requirement\nof numerosity is satisfied.  Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993) (“Courts\nhave not required evidence of exact class size or identity of class members to satisfy the\nnumerosity requirement.”).  In the Second Circuit “numerosity is presumed at a level of 40\nmembers.”  Consol. Rail Corp. v. Town of Hyde Park, 47 F.3d 473, 483 (2d Cir. 1995).\nThe evidence here suggests that the class will consist of far more than 40 members.\n Plaintiffs show that of the 1,640 households to which HANH issued a Housing Voucher or\nHousing Certificate between 2003 and 2006, 386—approximately 24%—of them were\n9\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 10 of 17\nDisabled Section 8 Households.  (Pls.’ Mem. Supp. Mot. Class Cert. [Doc. # 47] (“Pls.’ Mem.\nSupp. Cert.”) at 4–5 (citing “Summary of New Vouchers” (spreadsheet provided to Plaintiffs\nby Defendants), Ex. 15 to Pl.’s Mem. Supp. Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Doc. # 12], at 2).)  Plaintiffs\nargue that applying this percentage to the total number of households participating in the\nSection 8 Program through HANH yields approximately 691 Disabled Section 8 Households\nto which Defendants have not provided an acceptable AUL.\nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ showing of numerosity is mere speculation which\nis insufficient under Russo v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc., 201 F.R.D. 291 (D. Conn. 2001).  Russo\nheld that a plaintiff seeking to certify a class in his suit for injunctive and monetary relief for\n“alleged warrantless seizure of his private pharmaceutical records” from a pharmacy did not\nsatisfy the numerosity requirement because “an individual civil rights case cannot be\ntransformed into a class action simply by virtue of the ipse dixit that since it happened to the\nplaintiff, it must have happened to others, without some indication allowing the Court to\nmake the ‘reasonable estimate’ that the law requires.”  Id. 295.  Russo is inapposite here.\nPlaintiffs offer HANH documents which list the number of Housing Vouchers that HANH\nissued as well as the number of such vouchers it issued to Disabled Section 8 Households.\nUnlike the speculation, conclusory assertions, and unreasonable assumptions offered by the\nplaintiff in Russo, here the Court is able to estimate that the size of the class exceeds 40\npersons on the basis of Defendants’ own statistics.\nIn addition, to the large number of putative class members, joinder may be\nimpracticable for other reasons.  See Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936 (“Determination of\npracticability [of joinder] depends on all the circumstances surrounding a case, not on mere\nnumbers[, including] judicial economy arising from the avoidance of a multiplicity of\n10\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 11 of 17\nactions, geographic dispersion of class members, financial resources of class members, the\nability of claimants to institute individual suits, and requests for prospective injunctive relief\nwhich would involve future class members.”).  Here, the putative class members—members\nof Disabled Section 8 Households—are definitionally people of limited financial means\nwhich would be further strained if they were required to institute individual suits or to join\nthis lawsuit individually.  Furthermore, since this action seeks only injunctive, and not\nmonetary, relief, the putative class members are not financially incentivized either to join\nthis suit or institute their own individual suits.\nPlaintiffs’ evidence of the order of magnitude of putative class members, coupled\nwith these other factors, show the class to be so numerous that joinder of all members is\nimpracticable7 under Rule 23(a)(1).\niii. Commonality and Typicality\nA class may not be certified unless “there are questions of law or fact common to the\nclass,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), and “the claims or defenses of the representative parties are\ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  As the Supreme Court\nhas noted, these commonality and typicality requirements “tend to merge” because “[b]oth\nserve as guideposts for determining whether . . . the named plaintiff’s claim and the class\nclaims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately\nprotected in their absence.”  Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 158 n. 13 (1982).\n7 Joinder only need be impracticable; it need not be impossible.  Cent. States Se. & Sw.\nAreas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 504 F.3d 229, 244–45\n(2d Cir. 2007) (“The numerosity requirement in Rule 23(a)(1) does not mandate that joinder\nof all parties be impossible—only that the difficulty or inconvenience of joining all members\nof the class make use of the class action appropriate”).  \n11\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 12 of 17\nHere, plaintiffs allege discrimination arising from Defendants’ application of policies\nor practices, i.e., that Defendants acted towards all “[putative] class members in the same\ngeneral fashion” by denying them an AUL and mobility counseling by virtue of a common\npolicy or practice and in violation of the same regulations, preventing their full enjoyment\nof the Section 8 Program.  See Attenborough v. Const. and Gen. Bldg. Laborers’ Local 79, 238\nF.R.D. 82, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“In discrimination cases commonality does not mandate that\nall class members make identical claims and arguments, but requires that ‘the gravamen of\nthe [c]omplaint is that defendants discriminated against class members in the same general\nfashion.’”) (citation omitted, alteration in Attenborough).\nDefendants argue that the proposed classes suffer from a lack of commonality and\ntypicality because “each of the plaintiffs has a unique history, where placement decisions\nwere made by a variety of different individuals considering the unique factors of each\nplaintiff’s situation.”  (Defs.’ Obj. Cert. 14.)  As a result, they argue, “[i]t would be difficult\nfor this court to find either commonality among the named plaintiffs or with absent class\nmembers.”  (Id. 14–15.)  They further argue that there is no commonality or typicality\nbecause “the harm allegedly caused each member of the proposed class resulted from some\nseparate, distinct act or incident involving these defendants,” such that “[t]he class members\nwere not all injured as a result of one single act or event.”  (Id. 15.)  Defendants’ arguments\nmisconstrue Plaintiffs’ allegations.  While the circumstances and nature of each plaintiff’s\nand class member’s disability may differ, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ discriminatory\npolicy or practice applies to them regardless of these differences, and that Defendants’\napplication of that policy or practice to them is unlawful for reasons unrelated to each\nperson’s individual disability.  See Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936–37 (“When it is alleged that the\n12\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 13 of 17\nsame unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class\nsought to be represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of minor\nvariations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.”).\nPlaintiffs’ and the putative class members’ theory of liability is based on Defendants’\nalleged policy in relation to the fact of their disability, and not to the nature of their\nindividual disabilities.  Cf.  Raymond v. Rowland, 220 F.R.D. 173, 180 (D. Conn. 2004)\n(certifying a class of plaintiffs challenging the failure of the Connecticut Department of\nSocial Services (“DSS”) to reasonably accommodate disabled persons, and explaining that\n“the question of reasonable accommodations is common to the class as defined here since\nPlaintiffs are challenging acts and omissions of DSS that are not specific to any particular\nPlaintiff”).  Thus, the fact that the named plaintiffs are disabled Section 8 tenants—and thus\nmembers of Disabled Section 8 Households—makes them typical of the class.  They\nrepresent the universe of factual scenarios encompassed by their theories of liability in\nCounts I and III because both Ms. Taylor and Mr. Hunter are disabled and use wheelchairs\nand are “handicapped” for purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f) and 24 C.F.R. §§ 8.28 and\n100.204, the statute and regulations under which they bring suit.  Ms. Taylor sought help\nfrom an HANH staff member in searching for an accessible apartment, was refused, and was\ninformed that searching for an apartment was her responsibility, reflecting a “policy, pattern\nand/or practice of HANH toward disabled persons on Section 8 who ask for HANH’s\nassistance in searching for an apartment.”  (2d Am. Compl. ¶¶ 15–19.)  Mr. Hunter was\nnever provided an AUL by HANH, did not know that such a list was available, and never\nreceived any assistance searching for an apartment.  He did not know that he could request\neither the AUL or assistance.  (Hunter Aff. ¶¶ 9–11.)\n13\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 14 of 17\nIt may be, as Defendants argue, that no discriminatory policies exist, such that\nPlaintiffs cannot prevail on their theories of liability underpinning the two counts for which\nthey seek class certification.  This merits dispute, however, does not affect determination of\nwhether  the  requirements  of  typicality  and  commonality  have  been  met.    These\nrequirements having been satisfied, the Court next addresses the requirement of adequacy\nof representation.\niv. Adequacy of Representation\nA class may only be certified if “the representative parties will fairly and adequately\nprotect the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  While the commonality and\ntypicality  requirements  “also  tend  to  merge  with  the  adequacy-of-representation\nrequirement, . . . the [adequacy-of-representation] requirement also raises concerns about\nthe competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.”  Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n. 13.\nAlthough Defendants refer to Ms. Taylor’s changed circumstances after suit was commenced\nand a preliminary injunction requiring HANH to provide her with assistance was granted\non joint stipulation (See Defs.’ Suppl. Mem. Supp. Obj. Class Cert. [Doc. # 65] at 8–9; Order\nGranting Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. [Doc. # 23]), they do not otherwise challenge the adequacy\nof representation that the named plaintiffs would provide to class members.  HANH has not\nsuggested that Mr. Hunter’s claim is moot.  As to the effect of the preliminary injunction\nrequiring HANH to assist Ms. Taylor, “[w]here class claims are inherently transitory, ‘the\ntermination of a class representative's claim does not moot the claims of the unnamed\nmembers of the class,’” and in any event “[e]ven where the class is not certified until after\nthe claims of the individual class representatives have become moot, certification may be\ndeemed to relate back to the filing of the complaint in order to avoid mooting the entire\n14\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 15 of 17\ncontroversy.”  Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 938–39 (quoting Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 110\nn. 11 (1975), and citing Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 401–02 & n. 11(1975) and Cty. of\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 51–52 (1991)).  As a result, and because Ms. Taylor and\nMr. Hunter represent all factual scenarios encompassed by their class claims, the Court\ndetermines that Rule 23(a)(4) is satisfied here.\nC. Class Certification under Rule 23(b) Requirement\nPlaintiffs seek certification of a class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2).  A class may be\ncertified under this subsection when “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act\non grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding\ndeclaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).\nWhere, as here, plaintiffs allege discriminatory and unlawful systemic or policy-level actions,\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2) is proper, and in fact this case presents a “prime example[]”\nof the type of case for which Rule 23(b)(2) certification is particularly appropriate.  Amchem\nProds., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 614 (1997) (“Civil rights cases against parties charged\nwith unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples” of Rule 23(b)(2) cases.).  On\nthe claims for which they seek class certification, Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory\nrelief as well as costs and fees, but do not seek compensatory damages.  (See 2d Am. Compl.\nat Prayer For Relief at ¶¶ 1 & 3 & 5.)  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engage in an unlawful\nand discriminatory policy, pattern and/or practice by which they deprive Plaintiffs and\nputative class members of their rights under federal statute and regulation.  They allege that\nthis policy, pattern and/or practice is triggered by their status as Disabled Section 8\nHouseholds, regardless of their particular disabilities, such that Defendants allegedly act on\n15\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 16 of 17\ngrounds generally applicable to all named plaintiffs and putative class members.  On this\nbasis, the Court determines that Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied.\nD. Conclusion as to Class Certification\nThe Court concludes that all requirements for class certification under Rule 23(a)\nand (b) have been met, and that class certification is appropriate here.8\nE. Appointment of Class Counsel\nIf the Court certifies a class, it “must appoint class counsel.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1).\nIn doing so, it “must consider” the counsel’s work “in identifying or investigating potential\nclaims in the action,” her “experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and\nthe types of claims asserted in the action,” her “knowledge of the applicable law,” and “the\nresources that the counsel will commit to representing the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).\nIt may also consider “any other matter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately\nrepresent the interests of the class.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B).\nPlaintiffs move to appoint their counsel, Jennifer C. Vickery, as class counsel (Pls.’\nMot. App’t Class Counsel [Doc. # 101]), to which Defendants have no objection.  Attorney\nVickery avers that she served as “appointed class counsel in a similar fair housing matter,”\nthat she has “been involved in litigating civil rights, housing and discrimination claims for\nthe entirety of [her] legal career,” and that she is “familiar with the problems experienced by\npersons with disabilities in trying to rent decent housing within the City of New Haven.”\n(Id. at Ex. 1 at ¶¶ 3–5.)  See also Matyasovszky v. Bridgeport Housing Auth., 226 F.R.D. 35 (D.\n8 At oral argument Plaintiffs agreed that if the Court were to certify a class the\nMotion to Intervene by Plaintiffs and Proposed Intervenor Grady Reynolds [Doc. # 83]\nshould be denied.  Because a class is certified, the Motion to Intervene is denied.\n16\n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 108    Filed 03/10/09   Page 17 of 17\nConn. 2005) (granting class certification to plaintiffs represented by Attorney Vickery and\nanother attorney).  On these bases, and absent objection, the Court concludes that Attorney\nVickery will be able to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class.\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, Grady Reynolds and Plaintiffs’ Motion to Intervene\n[Doc. # 83] is DENIED, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification [Doc # 46] and Motion to\nAppoint Class Counsel [Doc. # 101] are GRANTED, and the following class is certified with\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, Jennifer C. Vickery, as class counsel:\nAll households including at least one handicapped person to which the\nHousing Authority of New Haven has issued a Housing Certificate or\nHousing Voucher, and:\n(a) that did not receive a list of available, accessible apartments,\nas required under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R. § 100.204,\nand/or 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3); and/or\n(b) that did not receive Mobility Counseling services, or offer\nthereof, as required under 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f), 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.204, and/or 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3).\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n/s/\nJanet Bond Arterton, U.S.D.J.\nDated at New Haven, Connecticut this 9th day of March, 2009.\n17",

This is an action to \nrequire the defendants to help Ms. Taylor use her Section 8 subsidy to rent accessible housing.  \nMs. Taylor participates in the federal Section 8 program, administered in New Haven by the \nHousing Authority of the City of New Haven (“HANH”).  Unable to navigate her wheelchair \ndown the steps to the apartment building where she now lives, Ms. Taylor is exposed to danger \nfrom accidents or intruders whenever she is home alone. \n  Upon information and belief, her situation is similar to that of a significant number of \nother Section 8 participants.  The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 2 of 12\ncompensatory damages, and costs of litigation under the Fair Housing Act Amendments, Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the National Housing Act.   \nHISTORY OF NONCOMPLIANCE BY THE DEFENDANTS \n1.  HANH is a recipient of funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) with which it administers the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher \nprogram in New Haven (“Section 8”). \n2.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, HUD requires recipient housing authorities to assist disabled \nindividuals and their families who are attempting to use their Section 8 vouchers to find \naccessible dwellings.  The regulation specifies, inter alia, that: \n“(a)  . . . [A] recipient administering a Section 8 . . .housing voucher program shall: . . . . \n (3) When issuing a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher to a family which includes an \nindividual with handicaps include a current listing of available accessible units known to the \nPHA and, if necessary, otherwise assist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling \nunit.” \n3.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, HUD additionally requires recipient housing authorities to \nreasonably accommodate disabled individuals and their families where necessary to allow them \nto participate in the Section 8 program.   \n4.  In or about 1994, HUD reviewed HANH to assess its compliance with Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  As a result, HANH entered into a voluntary agreement with HUD addressing \npast non-compliance with their obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including the \nobligations to help search for accessible apartments under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 3 of 12\n100.204 (the “1994 Agreement”).  In 2006, HUD again reviewed HANH to assess its compliance \nwith Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In 2007, HUD issued a report, stating that HANH \nwas not in compliance with certain obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including \nthe obligations of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204. See Exhibit A, Section 504 Report \nby Carl Harris. As a result, HANH agreed to enter into another Voluntary Compliance \nAgreement (the “2007 Agreement”).   \n5.  On September 19, 2007, a federal court ordered HANH to provide a list of accessible, \navailable apartments as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) to one Section 8 family.  See Gaither \nv. Housing Authority of the City of New Haven, 2007 WL 3378533, D. Conn., November 2, \n2007 (NO. 3:07-CV-667WWE).  \n6. As of April 9, 2008—a more than six months later—HANH still does not provide a list of \navailable, accessible apartments to all Section 8 participants that include disabled persons.   \n7. Jimmy Miller currently serves as the Executive Director of HANH.  At the direction of Miller, \nHANH “does not do searches for apartments.” See Exhibit B, Admission #1 from Plaintiffs’ First \nRequest for Admissions from Jimmy Miller, dated July 18, 2007. \n8. Each of the defendant members of the Commission personally knew that HANH was not in \nfull compliance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, yet each fraudulently voted to \ncertify that HANH was in compliance with its fair housing obligations.   \n9.  HANH has not been fully compliant with either 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 or 24 C.F.R. §100.204, at \nany time during the tenure of Miller.   Instead, HANH has demonstrated a continuous pattern of \nnon-compliance with its obligations under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, the Fair \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 4 of 12\nHousing Act Amendments and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Such pattern continues \nthrough the present. \nTHE NAMED PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR SEARCH ASSISTANCE \n10.  Taylor family currently resides in a three-bedroom apartment at 205 Dover Street, 1st floor in \nNew Haven. The family consists of Rebecca Taylor and her son and daughter. Although it is \nlocated on the first floor, the apartment is not wheelchair accessible, in that both the front and \nback entrances to the building must be reached by stairs. \n11.  Whenever she is alone in the home, Rebecca Taylor is endangered by the lack of any \nwheelchair-accessible way of exiting from her home.  \n12. Rebecca Taylor has searched via the newspaper for an accessible two or three-bedroom \napartment, without success.  \n13. In early 2008, the Bank of America instituted foreclosure proceedings on the apartment \nbuilding where the Taylor family resides.  \n14.  Soon thereafter, Section 8 staff person Denise Senior conducted a recertification of the \nTaylor household. \n15.  During that recertification, Ms. Senior and Ms. Taylor discussed the fact that the 205 Dover \nStreet apartment building was in foreclosure, and the strong likelihood that Ms. Taylor would \nhave to move out of the building very soon. \n16.  Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Senior if HANH would help her search for an accessible apartment. \n17.  Ms. Senior responded by stating that searching for an apartment was Ms. Taylor’s \nresponsibility under the Section 8 program.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 5 of 12\n18.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, was a misrepresentation of the Section 8 \nprogram rules.  \n19.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, represents the policy, pattern and/or \npractice of HANH toward disabled persons on Section 8 who ask for HANH’s assistance in \nsearching for an apartment. \n20.  On or about March 14, 2008 Ms. Taylor reiterated her concerns in a written request for a \nreasonable accommodation, which was received by HANH that same day.  See Exhibit C, \nReasonable Accommodation Letter from R. Taylor.  To date, HANH has not responded in any \nway. \n21. On April 3, 2008 the Superior Court for the district of New Haven granted a motion for \ndefault against the owner of the building, Ms. Taylor’s landlord, for failure to appear and defend \nthe foreclosure proceedings against 205 Dover Street.

Upon information and belief, the Taylor family is likely to be ejected from \n205 Dover Street within the next sixty days. \nCLASS MEMBERS \n22. The proposed class definition is: “All current and future participants in the Section 8 Housing \nChoice Voucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or handicaps of themselves or \nsomeone in their household, need assistance in searching for suitable dwellings to lease under the \nprogram.” \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 6 of 12\n23.  The proposed class is appropriate for certification under Rule 23 (b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, because the Defendants have refused to act “on grounds generally applicable \nto the class,” and the plaintiffs seek primarily injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n24. The proposed class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” within the \nmeaning of Rule 23 (a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon information and belief, \nthe Defendants’ policy, pattern and/or practice of refusing to assist disabled Section 8 \nparticipants in their searches for accessible housing pursuant to their obligations under 24 C.F.R. \n§ 8.28 affects over three hundred current participants who hold Section 8 vouchers administered \nby HANH.  Upon information and belief, HANH issues at least one hundred additional vouchers \neach year, and at least a third of those vouchers are issued to households that include a disabled \nmember.  Thus the class, while fluid, nevertheless comprises least four hundred voucher-holders \nand participants at any given point. \n25.

The plaintiffs are “otherwise qualified” to participate in the Section 8 program.  \n42.  The plaintiffs requested that the defendants reasonably accommodate them by helping them \nto search for and lease a suitable unit under the Section 8 program. \n43.  The Defendants denied the plaintiffs’ requests for a reasonable accommodation, either \ndirectly or through unconscionable delay. \n44. The acts described in this Count II have injured and continue to injure the plaintiffs by \ncausing them to suffer frustration, anxiety, emotional distress, and despair.   \nCOUNT III \nSection 1983 and the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 \n \n45. The plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 44 of this Complaint as if repeated in this \nCount III. \n46.  The Defendants’ policies, pattern and/or practices violated subpart (a)(3) of 24 C.F.R. § \n8.28, which requires that housing authorities must: “When issuing a Housing Certificate or \nHousing Voucher to a family which includes an individual with handicaps include a current \nlisting of available accessible units known to the [housing authority] and, if necessary, otherwise \nassist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling unit.” \n  9 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 10 of 12\n47.  The Defendants have been advised by HUD and others on numerous occasions from 1994 to \nthe present that such policies, pattern and/or practices were unlawful.   \n48.  The Defendants were further put on notice that their policies pattern and/or practices \nviolated subpart (a)(3) of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 by an Order issued by the Honorable Warren Eginton \non September 19, 2007, enjoining HANH from its refusal to supply such listing.  \n49.

The acts and omissions described in this Count III were committed knowingly, intentionally, \nand with callous disregard for the rights of the plaintiffs. \nCOUNT IV \nPreliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief \n \n51. The plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 50 of this Complaint as if repeated in this \nCount IV.   \n52.  The plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo by enjoining the Defendants’ refusal to comply \nwith 42 U.S.C. § 3604(F)(3)(B), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 24 C.F.R. § \n8.28(a)(3). \n53.  Plaintiffs are likely to be irreparably harmed by the defendants’ continuing noncompliance, \nas demonstrated by the defendants’ failure to assist the named plaintiff, Rebecca Taylor, \nexposing her family to imminent homelessness and loss of her Section 8 benefits. \n54.  Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims. \n  10 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 3    Filed 04/15/08   Page 11 of 12\n55.  The balance of hardships tips decidedly in the plaintiffs’ favor, inasmuch as the defendants \nare being asked to provide a purely administrative remedy, whereas Rebecca Taylor may lose her \nhome, and her continued eligibility for a housing subsidy. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays for relief from this Court, in the form of: \n1.  An injunction requiring the defendants to timely assist the plaintiffs in finding and \nleasing an accessible or modifiable dwellings in New Haven County, by: \n  a.  providing a list of the currently available, accessible apartments; and \n  b.  using third party mobility counseling services or their own staff, if necessary, to:  \n    i.   search for two-bedroom dwellings that are accessible or modifiable; \n    ii.  visit such dwellings to determine whether they are truly accessible or  \n      modifiable; \n    iii.  make modifications for accessibility if necessary; and \n    iv.  facilitate the leasing process. \n3.

This is an action to \nrequire the defendants to help Ms. Taylor use her Section 8 subsidy to rent accessible housing.  \nMs. Taylor participates in the federal Section 8 program, administered in New Haven by the \nHousing Authority of the City of New Haven (“HANH”).  Unable to navigate her wheelchair \ndown the steps to the apartment building where she now lives, Ms. Taylor is exposed to danger \nfrom accidents or intruders whenever she is home alone. \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 2 of 13\n  Upon information and belief, her situation is similar to that of a significant number of \nother Section 8 participants.  The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, declaratory judgment, and \ncompensatory damages to the named plaintiff, attorney’s fees and costs of litigation under the \nFair Housing Act Amendments, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the National Housing \nAct.   \nHISTORY OF NONCOMPLIANCE BY THE DEFENDANTS \n1.  HANH is a recipient of funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (“HUD”) with which it administers the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher \nprogram in New Haven (“Section 8”). \n2.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, HUD requires recipient housing authorities to assist disabled \nindividuals and their families who are attempting to use their Section 8 vouchers to find \naccessible dwellings.  The regulation specifies, inter alia, that: \n“(a)  . . . [A] recipient administering a Section 8 . . .housing voucher program shall: . . . . \n (3) When issuing a Housing Certificate or Housing Voucher to a family which includes an \nindividual with handicaps include a current listing of available accessible units known to the \nPHA and, if necessary, otherwise assist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling \nunit.” \n3.  Through 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, HUD additionally requires recipient housing authorities to \nreasonably accommodate disabled individuals and their families where necessary to allow them \nto participate in the Section 8 program.   \n  2 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 3 of 13\n4.  In or about 1994, HUD reviewed HANH to assess its compliance with Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  As a result, HANH entered into a voluntary agreement with HUD addressing \npast non-compliance with their obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including the \nobligations to help search for accessible apartments under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § \n100.204 (the “1994 Agreement”).  In 2006, HUD again reviewed HANH to assess its compliance \nwith Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In 2007, HUD issued a report, stating that HANH \nwas not in compliance with certain obligations to disabled persons in need of housing, including \nthe obligations of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204. See Exhibit A, Section 504 Report \nby Carl Harris. As a result, HANH agreed to enter into another Voluntary Compliance \nAgreement (the “2007 Agreement”).   \n5.  On September 19, 2007, a federal court ordered HANH to provide a current list of accessible, \navailable apartments known to it, as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3) to one Section 8 family.  \nSee Gaither v. Housing Authority of the City of New Haven, 2007 WL 3378533, D. Conn., \nNovember 2, 2007 (NO. 3:07-CV-667WWE).  \n6. As of April 9, 2008—a more than six months later—HANH has failed to create the current list \nof available, accessible apartments known to it, as required by 24 C.F.R. § 8.28(a)(3), and \ntherefore still does not provide such list when issuing a Section 8 voucher to a family which \nincludes an individual with handicaps. \n7. Jimmy Miller currently serves as the Executive Director of HANH.  At the direction of Miller, \nHANH “does not do searches for apartments.” See Exhibit B, Admission #1 from Plaintiffs’ First \nRequest for Admissions from Jimmy Miller, dated July 18, 2007. \n  3 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 4 of 13\n8.  Each of the defendant members of the Commission personally knows that HANH was not in \nfull compliance with 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 and 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, yet each has voted in favor of \nmeasures that violate such regulations, and fraudulently voted to certify that HANH was in \ncompliance with its fair housing obligations.   \n9.  HANH has not been fully compliant with either 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 or 24 C.F.R. §100.204, at \nany time during the tenure of Miller.   Instead, HANH has demonstrated a continuous pattern of \nnon-compliance with its obligations under 24 C.F.R. § 8.28, 24 C.F.R. § 100.204, the Fair \nHousing Act Amendments and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Such pattern continues \nthrough the present. \nREBECCA TAYLOR’S REQUEST FOR SEARCH ASSISTANCE \n10.  Taylor family currently resides in a three-bedroom apartment at 205 Dover Street, 1st floor in \nNew Haven. The family consists of Rebecca Taylor and her son and daughter. Although it is \nlocated on the first floor, the apartment is not wheelchair accessible, in that both the front and \nback entrances to the building must be reached by stairs. \n11.  Whenever she is alone in the home, Rebecca Taylor is endangered by the lack of any \nwheelchair-accessible way of exiting from her home.  \n12. Rebecca Taylor has searched via the newspaper for an accessible two or three-bedroom \napartment, without success.  \n13. In early 2008, the Bank of America instituted foreclosure proceedings on the apartment \nbuilding where the Taylor family resides.  \n  4 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 5 of 13\n14.  Soon thereafter, Section 8 staff person Denise Senior conducted a recertification of the \nTaylor household. \n15.  During that recertification, Ms. Senior and Ms. Taylor discussed the fact that the 205 Dover \nStreet apartment building was in foreclosure, and the strong likelihood that Ms. Taylor would \nhave to move out of the building very soon. \n16.  Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Senior if HANH would help her search for an accessible apartment. \n17.  Ms. Senior responded by stating that searching for an apartment was Ms. Taylor’s \nresponsibility under the Section 8 program.  \n18.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, was a misrepresentation of the Section 8 \nprogram rules.  \n19.  Ms. Senior’s response, described in paragraph 17, represents the policy, pattern and/or \npractice of HANH toward disabled persons on Section 8 who ask for HANH’s assistance in \nsearching for an apartment. \n20.  On or about March 14, 2008 Ms. Taylor reiterated her concerns in a written request for a \nreasonable accommodation, which was received by HANH that same day.  See Exhibit C, \nReasonable Accommodation Letter from R. Taylor.  HANH’s own Administrative Plan requires \nHANH to respond to such a request within thirty days. Over thirty days have passed and HANH \nhas not responded in any way. \n21. On April 3, 2008 the Superior Court for the district of New Haven granted a motion for \ndefault against the owner of the building, Ms. Taylor’s landlord, for failure to appear and defend \nthe foreclosure proceedings against 205 Dover Street.  See Exhibit D, Case Detail Docket for \n  5 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 6 of 13\nCV-08-5017975-S.  Upon information and belief, the Taylor family is likely to be ejected from \n205 Dover Street within the next sixty days. \nCLASS MEMBERS \n22. The proposed class definition is: “All current and future participants in the Section 8 Housing \nChoice Voucher program who, because of the disabilities and/or handicaps of themselves or \nsomeone in their household, need assistance in searching for suitable dwellings to lease under the \nprogram.” \n23.  The proposed class is appropriate for certification under Rule 23 (b)(2) of the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure, because the Defendants have refused to act “on grounds generally applicable \nto the class,” and the plaintiffs seek primarily injunctive and declaratory relief.  \n24. The proposed class is “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable” within the \nmeaning of Rule 23 (a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon information and belief, \nthe Defendants’ policy, pattern and/or practice of refusing to assist disabled Section 8 \nparticipants in their searches for accessible housing pursuant to their obligations under 24 C.F.R. \n§ 8.28 affects over three hundred current participants who hold Section 8 vouchers administered \nby HANH.  Upon information and belief, HANH issues at least one hundred additional vouchers \neach year, and at least a third of those vouchers are issued to households that include a disabled \nmember.  Thus the class, while fluid, nevertheless comprises least four hundred voucher-holders \nand participants at any given point. \n  6 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 7 of 13\n25.   The proposed class has been subjected to identical or similar treatment by the Defendants, \nsuch that  “there are questions of law or fact common to the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 \n(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n26.  The claims of named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor and Karl Hunter are “typical of the claims or \ndefenses of the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \n27.  The named plaintiff Rebecca Taylor and Karl Hunter will “fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class” within the meaning of Rule 23 (a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n28.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3) and 42 U.S.C. §1983, jurisdiction is proper in \nthat plaintiff’s claims alleged herein arise under federal law. \n29.

The plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 44 of this Complaint as if repeated in this \nCount III. \n46.  The Defendants’ policies, pattern and/or practices violated subpart (a)(3) of 24 C.F.R. § \n8.28, which requires that housing authorities must: “When issuing a Housing Certificate or \nHousing Voucher to a family which includes an individual with handicaps include a current \nlisting of available accessible units known to the [housing authority] and, if necessary, otherwise \nassist the family in locating an available accessible dwelling unit.” \n47.  The Defendants have been advised by HUD and others on numerous occasions from 1994 to \nthe present that such policies, pattern and/or practices were unlawful.   \n48.  The Defendants were further put on notice that their policies pattern and/or practices \nviolated subpart (a)(3) of 24 C.F.R. § 8.28 by an Order issued by the Honorable Warren Eginton \non September 19, 2007, enjoining HANH from its refusal to supply such listing.  \n49.  The acts described in this Count III have injured and continue to injure the plaintiffs by \ncausing them to suffer frustration, anxiety, emotional distress, and despair.  \n  10 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 11 of 13\n50. The acts and omissions described in this Count III were committed knowingly, intentionally, \nand with callous disregard for the rights of the plaintiffs. \nCOUNT IV \nInjunctive Relief \n \n51. The plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 50 of this Complaint as if repeated in this \nCount IV.   \n52.  The plaintiffs seek to preserve the status quo by enjoining the Defendants’ refusal to comply \nwith 42 U.S.C. § 3604(F)(3)(B), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and 24 C.F.R. § \n8.28(a)(3). \n53.  The plaintiffs are likely to be irreparably harmed by the defendants’ continuing \nnoncompliance, as demonstrated by the defendants’ failure to assist the named plaintiff, Rebecca \nTaylor, exposing her family to imminent homelessness and loss of her Section 8 benefits. \n54.  The plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims. \n55.  The balance of hardships tips decidedly in the plaintiffs’ favor, inasmuch as the defendants \nare being asked to provide a purely administrative remedy, whereas Rebecca Taylor may lose her \nhome, and her continued eligibility for a housing subsidy. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the plaintiff prays for relief from this Court, in the form of: \n1.  An injunction requiring the defendants to cease their noncompliance with the law, by: \n  11 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 12 of 13\n  a.  making available to all Section 8 applicants and plaintiff class members a list of \ncurrently available, accessible apartments known to HANH, and continuing to update and  make \navailable such list on a monthly basis;  \n  b.  notifying in writing all members of HANH staff who have direct contact with Section \n8 applicants and participant household of the policy changes contained in this order, and contract \nwith the Connecticut Fair Housing Center to randomly perform testing of the effectiveness of \nsuch notice upon the practices of HANH staff on at least three occasions over the next twelve \nmonths; \n  c.  using a mobility counseling service, or their own staff, if necessary, to timely assist \nplaintiff class members who need to move by providing assistance with the following activities:  \n    i.   searching for suitably sized dwellings that are accessible or modifiable; \n    ii.  visiting such dwellings to determine whether they are truly accessible or  \n      modifiable; \n    iii.  applying for funding to make modifications for accessibility if necessary; \nand \n    iv.  facilitating the leasing process. \n  3.  A declaration that the defendants have violated their obligations under 24 C.F.R. \n§ 8.28, and the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973. \n4.  An award of compensatory damages to the named plaintiff; \n  12 \n\nCase 3:08-cv-00557-JBA   Document 81    Filed 11/19/08   Page 13 of 13\n5.  An award of costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§3613(c)(2) and any other applicable statute that would permit such award; and \n6.
