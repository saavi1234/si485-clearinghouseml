    "summary": "<p>On June 16, 2009, Arabic Christian Perspective (ACP), a nonprofit with a self-described mission of “proclaiming the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims”, filed this lawsuit against the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Earlier that year, the Dearborn police department instituted a leafleting restriction for the Arab International Festival that permitted leafleting at the Festival only from a stationary booth and not while walking around the Festival. Each year prior to this ordinance, the plaintiffs had passed out pamphlets while walking around the festival to promote Christianity in an effort to convert the Muslims. The plaintiffs alleged in the complaint that this leafleting restriction violated their First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, free exercise of religion, and Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection. The plaintiffs sought a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction enjoining the enforcement of the restriction, and nominal and compensatory damages. </p><p>On June 18, 2009 Judge Nancy Edmunds of the District Court denied the plaintiffs' request for a temporary restraining order to prevent the restriction from going into effect before the 2009 Festival. Judge Edmunds concluded that the restriction was narrowly focused, still provided the plaintiffs’ access to the Festival to carry out their mission, and supported a legitimate government interest for crowd safety. Though only an order, without legal explanation, is available on the docket, reasoning for this decision can be found in 720 F.Supp.2d 817.</p><p>On July 7, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint including several exhibits of pictures from the Festival. On January 15, 2010, one of the plaintiffs, Arabic Christian Perspective, voluntarily dismissed itself from the case, leaving its founder and director as the sole plaintiff.</p><p>On March 15, 2010, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment and injunctive relief. The defendants also moved for summary judgment on April 9, 2010. At some point prior to the ruling on the motions, this case was transferred to District Court Judge Paul D. Borman. </p><p>On June 7, 2010, Judge Borman dismissed the case, granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and injunctive relief. Specifically, he granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion as to the plaintiff’s First Amendment free speech claim because the leafleting restriction was a valid time, place, and manner restriction of speech, as it was content neutral and served a government interest in safety. He also granted the defendants’ summary judgment motion as to the plaintiff’s freedom of association claim because the restriction did not force or prevent the plaintiff’s from organizing during the event, and as to the plaintiff’s free exercise claim because the plaintiff did not address this claim in his summary judgment motion. Lastly, Judge Borman granted summary judgment in favor the defendants as to the plaintiff’s equal protection claim because the restriction was based on a location, not based on a specific message or idea. 720 F.Supp.2d 817.</p><p>Also on June 7, 2010, the plaintiff appealed to the Sixth Circuit. On June 17, 2010, the Court of Appeals (Judges Richard Suhrheinrich, Eugene Siler, and Eric Clay) granted the plaintiff’s motion for an injunction pending appeal., This order, pertaining only to the 2010 Festival, allowed the plaintiff to distribute leaflets from the outer sidewalks and roads, but not on the sidewalks that were directly adjacent to the Festival attractions.</p><p>On May 26, 2011, in a published opinion, Judge Karen Nelson Moore for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, reversed the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the free speech claim, thereby invalidating the leafleting restriction within both the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival. The Court of Appeals held that the restriction on the sidewalks directly adjacent to the Festival attractions did not serve a substantial government interest. The City kept those same sidewalks open for public traffic and permit sidewalk vendors, whose activity was more obstructive to sidewalk traffic flow than pedestrian leafleting. Moreover, the prohibition of pedestrian leafleting in the outer perimeter was not narrowly tailored to the goal of isolating inner areas from vehicular traffic. The City could be held liable because the Chief of Police, who instituted the leafleting restriction, created official municipal policy. 641 F.3d. 727.</p><p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment for the defendants on all other claims. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. 641 F.3d. 727.</p><p>Back in the District Court, on June 14, 2010, Judge Borman entered a judgment in accordance with the Court of Appeals opinion. Judge Borman reversed his previous order, now granting the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to the First Amendment free speech claim and permanently enjoining the defendants and anyone in concert with the defendants from enforcing the leafleting restriction.  </p><p>A satisfaction of judgment was entered by Judge Borman on February 27, 2012 and on March 9, 2012, Judge Borman adopted the recommendations by Magistrate Judge R. Steven Whalen to award the plaintiff $1.00 in nominal damages and $103,401.96 in cost and attorney fees. The case is now closed.</p>",

ELLERBRAKE,  MATTHEW  J.  ZALEWSKI,  and  DEBRA  A. \nWALLING, and in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment brought pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, state as follows: \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 2 of 40\n1.  Plaintiff has visited the City of Dearborn annually for the past five years \nduring  the  weekend  of  the  Annual  Arab  International  Festival  (“the  Festival”)  to \nconduct outreach intended to convert Muslims to Christianity. \n2.  Plaintiff’s activities have included and will continue to include training \nprograms  at  sites  including  a  City  park,  mosque  visits,  door-to-door  visits,  and \noutreach at the Festival that includes speaking to people, and distributing literature, \nbooks, and DVDs. \n3.  At all times relevant to Plaintiff’s Complaint, Plaintiff has been welcomed \nto the City of Dearborn, and has not been denied access to the public fora in which he \nseeks to spread his message. \n4.  The Festival is an annual event occurring on the streets of the City of \nDearborn,  but  which  is  privately  organized  by  the  American  Arab  Chamber  of \nCommerce.  Though the event receives the support of many sponsors, including the \nCity of Dearborn, the event is not a City of Dearborn event. \n5.  The Festival that occurred in 2009 was the 14th that has occurred.  Each \nyear the event grows larger, and planning for the 2009 event was premised on a \n300,000-person attendance factor – an increase of approximately 50,000 from the \nprevious year. \n6.  Due to the expectation of increased attendance, the festival boundaries \nin 2009 were expanded to include the sidewalks.  Accordingly, all activities on the \nsidewalks were subject to rules and regulations promulgated by the American Arab \nChamber of Commerce.   \n2 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 3 of 40\n7.  To participate in the Festival, any entity or individual must complete an \napplication and pay a nominal registration fee to obtain a booth within the festival \ngrounds.  Plaintiff refused to follow this procedure, and instead sought a level of \naccess that far exceeded what all other entities and individuals present at the Festival \n(including other Christian groups) were allowed to obtain. \n8.  Plaintiff has been, and will continue to be allowed to convey his message \nby mingling with the Festival attendees, distributing materials from a fixed Festival \nlocation, conducting training on City property, and proselytizing door-to-door during the \nFestival weekend.  He has ample alternative means of communication. \n9.  The City of Dearborn provides police support to the Festival to ensure \npublic health, safety, and welfare.  All enforced regulations are content-neutral and \nnarrowly tailored to serve this legitimate government interest.  \n10.  Plaintiff’s  First  Claim  for  Relief  alleges  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  First \nAmendment free speech rights.  For the reasons expressed above, and for those \nstated in Defendants’ brief in support, Plaintiff’s free speech rights have not been \ninfringed, and his Complaint should be dismissed. \n11.  Plaintiff’s  Second  Claim  for  Relief  alleges  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  First \nAmendment right to freedom of expressive association.  For the reasons expressed \nabove,  and  those  stated  in  Defendants’  brief  in  support,  Defendants  have  not \ninterfered with Plaintiff’s freedom to associate, and his Complaint should be dismissed. \n12.  Plaintiff’s  Third  Claim  for  Relief  alleges  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  First \nAmendment  right  to  free  exercise.    As  explained  in  Defendant’s  brief  in  support, \nPlaintiff is freely exercising his religion, and his Complaint should be dismissed. \n3 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 4 of 40\n13.  Plaintiff’s  Fourth  Claim  for  Relief  alleges  violation  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment Equal Protection Clause.  As discussed in Defendant’s brief in support, \nPlaintiff has been treated as all other entities and individuals at the Festival, and his \nComplaint should be dismissed. \n14.  Plaintiff’s  Complaint  seeks  an  injunction  against  enforcement  of  the \nFestival rules and regulations, and the City’s narrowly-tailored police support activity.  \nAs  fully  explained  in  Defendant’s  brief  in  support,  Plaintiff  does  not  satisfy  the \nrequirements for preliminary or permanent injunctive relief, and his Complaint should \nbe dismissed. \n15.  As also explained in Defendant’s brief in support, Plaintiff has failed to \njoin all necessary parties in this case, and his Complaint should be dismissed. \n16.  Pursuant to L.R. 7.1(a), Defendants sought Plaintiff’s concurrence in this \nMotion, but concurrence was denied. \nWHEREFORE, Defendants City of Dearborn and Ronald Haddad respectfully \nrequest that this Honorable Court grant their Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant \nto  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  12(b)(7)  and  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56,  dismiss  Plaintiff’s  case  with \nprejudice,  grant  Defendants  attorneys’  fees,  and  grant  any  other  relief  deemed \nappropriate. \nRespectfully submitted, \n            ____s/ LAURIE M.

Clearly, the festival area is \nmore akin to a fair than a normal city street.  But, regardless \n. . . the Ordinance is examined under the same intermediate \nlevel of scrutiny.   \n \nSpingola, at 983. \n \nSpingola  argues  that  the  regulation  does  not  relieve  the \ncrowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place \nduring  the  festival  regardless.  That,  however,  is  not  the \nquestion. The question is whether preventing uncontrolled \npublic  speaking  in  these  areas  promotes  a  significant \ngovernmental interest that would be less effectively achieved \nwithout  the  law.  That  is  accomplished  by  providing  a \nsmoother flow of traffic within the festival crowd.   \n \nSpingola, at 984. \nvii \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 13 of 40\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n \n  This case is about a Plaintiff who already has equal access to a public forum, \nbut now seeks to expand that forum by obtaining a level of access far beyond what \nany other speaker in the same forum currently enjoys.   \nPlaintiff’s ministry activities \n  Plaintiff  is  a  Christian  who  has  been  ministering  to  Muslims  since  1987. \n(Transcript of Deposition of George Saieg, p. 21, attached as Exhibit A. [Hereinafter \n“Saieg Dep.”])  In 2003, he founded the California-based nonprofit organization Arabic \nChristian Perspective (“ACP”), which served to “present the gospel of Jesus Christ to \nthe Muslims in the U.S.”  (Saieg dep., p. 16.)  ACP dissolved in 2009.  (Saieg dep., p \n16.)    ACP  trained  people  throughout  the  country  to  minister  to  Muslims,  and \ncoordinated  with  other  groups  to  organize  large-scale  outreach  missions  such  as \nattending an Arabic Festival in Seattle, Washington, an international festival in St. \nLouis, Missouri, and an Arab Festival in Dearborn, Michigan.  (Saieg dep., p. 27-32.)  \nAdditionally,  Plaintiff  and  ACP  would  orchestrate  smaller-scale  visits  to  mosques.  \n(Saieg dep., p. 26-27.)  Although ACP has been dissolved, Plaintiff plans to continue \nministering, including in Dearborn.  (Saieg dep., p. 66.)   \nPlaintiff regularly seeks the assistance of police departments when planning \nmission trips to inform the police of his intentions and receive guidance.  (Saieg dep., \np. 30.)  When planning a mosque visit, Plaintiff specifically requests a police presence.  \n(Saieg dep, p. 34.)  Plaintiff believes that a police presence is necessary to “keep \npeace between both side[s]” and to prevent any “false accusations” from being made \nagainst him or his colleagues.  (Saieg dep., p. 34.)   \n1 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 14 of 40\nAs part of Plaintiff’s outreach, Plaintiff and his missionaries distribute a range of \nChristian materials including the Gospel of John, a booklet called “How to Know God,” \nreligious tracts, and Jesus DVDs.  (Saieg dep., p. 29.) \nThe Annual Arab International Festival \n  Attending the annual Arab International Festival (“the Festival”) in Dearborn is \none of Plaintiff’s major activities.  He has been visiting Dearborn since 2004.  (Saieg \ndep.,  p.  36.)    In  conjunction  with  their  Festival  attendance,  Plaintiff  and  ACP \ncoordinated  an  annual  event  titled  “Facing  the  Muslim  Challenge,”  which  in  2009 \nextended from June 16-21, and included training programs, debates, prayer sessions, \nmosque visits, and door-to-door outreach.  (Exhibit B.)  Planning for the program \nbegan at least six months in advance.  (Saieg dep., p. 66.)  Activities took place in a \nnumerous venues, including Dearborn’s Hemlock Park.  (Exhibit B.)  Plaintiff organized \napproximately 90 people to visit Dearborn that weekend.  (Saieg dep., p. 69.)   \n  The 14th Annual Arab International Festival occurred on the streets of Dearborn, \nMichigan from June 19-21, 2010.  The Festival will occur again in 2010.  (Transcript of \ndeposition of Fay Beydoun, p. 20, attached as Exhibit C. [Hereinafter “Beydoun dep.”])  \nIt is free and open to the public.  (Exhibit D.)  The purpose of the Festival is to \ncelebrate Arabic culture, build bridges, and “promote the Warren Avenue Business \nDistrict.”  (Exhibit E.)  Some of the activities that take place include a carnival, music \nacts, food booths, merchandise vendors, and a fashion show.  (Exhibit D.)   \n  The Festival grounds extend approximately fourteen city blocks, east to west, \non Warren Avenue in east Dearborn.  (Maps attached as Exhibit F.)  The Festival \noccupies the public roads and sidewalks.  (Beydoun dep., p. 34, 37.)  The main stage \n2 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 15 of 40\noccupies the western edge of the Festival, while carnival rides are on the eastern edge \nof the Festival.  A series of tents line the rest of the street.  One of those is the \nchildren’s tent.  (Exhibits D and F.)  The other tents are dedicated to festival sponsors, \nfood vendors, artisans, and information tables staffed by community, religious, and \ncorporate organizations.  (Exhibit D.)  In total, the 2009 Festival featured 14 food \nvending areas, 17 sponsor areas, 40 artisan booths, and 25 information tables, for a \ntotal of 96 booths or tables throughout the Festival area.  (Exhibit D.)   \n  The Festival attracts hundreds of thousands of people.  The Dearborn Press \nand Guide reported on June 17, 2009 that more than 250,000 people were expected \nto attend the 2009 Festival.  (Exhibit G.)  With such a large number of visitors, close \nattention is paid by Festival organizers to issues related to street closures, crowd \ncontrol, and public safety.    \nThe Festival grounds \nStreet  closures  are  necessary  to  accommodate  the  Festival.  To  ensure  an \norderly and safe transition from the open streets and the streets occupied by the \nFestival, Festival organizers requested that a buffer zone be created between the \nopen streets and the area where the core Festival activities were occurring.  (Beydoun \ndep., p. 40; Transcript of deposition of Jeffrey Mrowka, p. 15, attached as Exhibit H. \n[Hereinafter “Mrowka dep.”])  The two perimeters established around the Festival have \nbeen  termed  as  the  “inner  perimeter”  and  “outer  perimeter.”    Street  closures  are \naccomplished by the placement of barricades and “road closed” signs in the streets.  \n(Exhibit I.)   \n3 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 16 of 40\n  The western inner perimeter boundary was established at Warren and Hartwell \n(except  when  it  was  briefly  established  at  Reuter,  one  block  further  west  to \naccommodate a ribbon-cutting ceremony).  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and Exhibit F.)  The \neastern perimeter boundary was established at Middlepoint (except when it was briefly \nestablished at Kingsley).  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and Exhibit F.)  The northern and \nsouthern “inner” borders were established at the front of the businesses along Warren \nAvenue – thus encompassing the sidewalks.  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and Exhibit F.)  To \nthe  extent  that  the  Festival  occurred  on  Miller  Road,  the  northern  and  southern \nboundaries extended one block behind the businesses.  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and \nExhibit F.)   The “outer perimeter” of the Festival was established to the west at \nSchaefer, to the east at Wyoming, to the north at Morrow Circle South, and to the \nsouth at Blesser.  (Mrowka dep., p. 16, and Exhibit F.)   \n  Festival-related activities took place within both the inner and outer perimeters.  \nThe core Festival activities took place within the inner perimeter, and covered area on \nboth the streets and sidewalks.  (Exhibit J.)  Ancillary activities, such as parking for \nFestival vendors, took place within the outer perimeter.  (Beydoun dep., p. 43-44.)  \nThus, while the outer perimeter did not include activities such as carnival rides or \nvendor booths, the area serviced the Festival by providing a safe, controllable buffer \nbetween the bulk of the Festival activities and the outside world. \nFestival sponsors and the role of the City of Dearborn\nThe Festival is organized by the American Arab Chamber of Commerce (“Arab \nChamber”), a private organization.  (Beydoun dep., p. 14.)  Fay Beydoun is the current \nExecutive Director of the Arab Chamber.  (Beydoun dep., p. 11-12.)  As Executive \n4 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 17 of 40\nDirector, Beydoun has the leading role in coordinating Festival logistics.  Beydoun \nbecame Executive Director in 2009, and consequently the 2009 Festival was the first \nthat she spearheaded.  The Festival accepts monetary and in-kind contributions from a \nwide range of sponsors including AT&T, General Motors, Chrysler, Art Van, Oakwood \nHospital, the U.S. Army, and the City of Dearborn.  (Exhibit D.)    \nWhile the Festival is not a City of Dearborn event, any large-scale event that \noccurs within the City of Dearborn inevitably requires City services.  For example, the \nArab Chamber cannot close the streets and sidewalks without the City’s permission.  \n(Exhibit E.)   Police support is needed for crowd control, to maintain a perimeter \naround the event, and to ensure public safety.  (Transcript of deposition of Ronald \nHaddad, p. 15, 18, attached as Exhibit K.  [Hereinafter “Haddad dep.”])  To facilitate \nthis  support,  the  Dearborn  Police  Department  set  up  a  command  post  within  the \nFestival boundaries.  (Haddad dep., p. 52.)  Additionally, the City is responsible for \nmaintaining the cleanliness of the streets and sidewalks.   \nTo ensure orderly planning, the City sends representatives to meetings of the \nFestival committee.  Five meetings took place for the 2009 Festival.  (Mrowka dep., p. \n8.)  City participants included Sgt. Jeffrey Mrowka and Deputy Recreation Director Eric \nPeterson.  (Mrowka dep., p. 9.)  Mrowka is special events coordinator for the police \ndepartment.  (Mrowka dep., p. 5.)  Peterson is the special events coordinator for the \nrecreation  department.    Mrowka  and  Peterson  ensure  that  organizations  hosting \nevents in the City obtain necessary approvals, and they identify the steps that will \nneed to be taken to maintain the public health, safety, and welfare during the event.   \n5 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 18 of 40\n  In a memo to the City Council recommending approval of the Arab Chamber’s \nrequest  to  stage  the  Festival,  Peterson  stated  that,  as  a  result  of  the  planning \nmeetings, City officials did not have any immediate concerns about the Arab Chamber \nconducting the Festival.  (Exhibit L.)  Accordingly, the City Council granted the Arab \nChamber’s request via Resolution 5-330-09.  (Exhibit M.)  In addition to authorizing \nstreet  closures  and  the  use  of  several  City  parking  lots,  the  Council  authorized \n“assistance  from  the  Dearborn  Police,  Fire,  Public  Works,  Building  &  Safety  and \nRecreation Departments to insure a safety [sic], healthy, fun and successful event.”  \n(Exhibit M.)  Significantly, the Resolution does not identify the City as the organizer the \nFestival.   \nImproving the 2009 Arab Festival: Expanding and Regulating the Grounds \n \n  Peterson’s memo noted that the planning meetings addressed “the city/public \nconcerns from previous festival years (traffic safety, parking, temporary food license \ncompliance,  issuing  of  sidewalk  sales  permits,  carnival  license,  noise  and  litter).  \n(Exhibit L.)  This is consistent with minutes of a Festival meeting held on February 11, \n2009, which note concerns about  cleanup and sidewalk sales.  (Exhibit N.)   \n  The  2009  Festival  provided  a  unique  opportunity  to  implement  changes \nbecause of the presence of several people new to the planning process. Not only was \nit Beydoun’s first Festival, but it was also the first year Sgt. Mrowka served as special \nevents coordinator for the police (Mrowka Dep., p. 9), and it was Chief Haddad’s first \nyear in office.  (Haddad dep., p. 14.)   \n  Regarding sidewalk sales, in past years (when the Festival did not extend to the \nfronts of the businesses), any business located around the Festival area would apply \n6 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 19 of 40\nto the City for a sidewalk sales permit.  (Beydoun dep., p. 31.)  This changed in 2009.  \nFestival organizers recognized that it was becoming difficult for pedestrians to travel \nthrough the Festival and within the business district.  (Beydoun dep., p. 34, 37.)  To \naddress this concern, the Arab Chamber asked to take control of the sidewalks from \nthe City, including the approval process for sidewalk sales.  (Beydoun dep., p. 31.)  \nThe City agreed.  Consequently, any business along Warren Avenue that wanted to \nset up a sidewalk sale was required to submit an application to participate in the \nFestival,  just  like  any  other  entity  or  person  who  sought  space  within  Festival.  \n(Beydoun dep., p. 32.)  If it was feasible to allow the sidewalk sale, the Arab Chamber \nwould approve the application.  (Beydoun dep., p. 32.)  Significantly, this change in \nprocedures caused the sidewalks to become subsumed within the Festival boundaries.   \nThe application process and Festival rules  \n  The  application  process  is  straightforward.    A  potential  participant  at  the \nFestival  must  obtain  an  application  from  the  Arab  Chamber  and  submit  it  by  a \ndeadline, which in 2009 was April 31.  (Exhibit O.)  The Chamber does not guarantee \napproval.  (Exhibit N.)  The application is required for food booths and artisan booths \nand information tables.  All applicants must pay a fee.  Information tables require the \nlowest  fee  –  $150.00  –  which  covers  the  costs  associated  with  being  given  an \nassigned area within the Festival.  (Exhibit O.)   \nThe application packet includes rules and regulations, including: \nMiscellaneous Rules: \n2.  No  unauthorized  performances,  sales, \ndemonstrations, exhibits, or solicitations of any kind \nshall be permitted. \n \n7 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 20 of 40\n*    *    * \n8.  No loitering shall be permitted at the Festival entrance \npoints  or  in  any  area  where  such  activity  would \nimpede pedestrian flow. \n \n(Exhibit O.) \nThe Festival rules apply to all solicitation and distribution activities.  (Beydoun dep., p. \n51-52.)  Pedestrian flow clearly is a concern of the Arab Chamber, as the Chamber \nnot only referenced pedestrian flow in its “Miscellaneous Rules,” but also in Festival \nrules regarding political solicitation, which restrict solicitation and materials distribution \nin order to maintain “an orderly and uninterrupted schedule of Festival activities and a \nfree flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.”  (Exhibit O.)  Thus, regardless of the type \nof solicitation being conducted, it is subject to rules designed to maintain order at the \nFestival. \n  The  regulations  further  warn,  “any  infraction  of  above  rules  will  result  in \nimmediate ejection from the Festival site and other appropriate enforcement action.”  \n(Exhibit O.)   \n Plaintiff’s participation in the 2009 Festival \n  Despite planning his outreach mission for at least six months, Plaintiff did not \nattempt to contact the City about participating in the Festival until after the April 31, \n2009 deadline for applications had passed.  Plaintiff initially left a voice mail for Sgt. \nMrowka on or about May 15, 2009.  (Mrowka dep., p. 19.)  Sgt. Mrowka returned the \ncall within the next few days, at which time Plaintiff told Sgt. Mrowka that he wanted to \ncome to the Festival and distribute literature and materials.  (Mrowka dep., p. 20.)  Sgt. \nMrowka informed Plaintiff that he would only be allowed to hand out materials in a \n8 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 21 of 40\nfixed location.  (Mrowka dep., p. 20.)  Plaintiff told Sgt. Mrowka that he would not pay \nfor a booth.  (Mrowka dep, p. 25.)   \n  Sgt. Mrowka informed Plaintiff that the Festival could accommodate him by \nallowing him to set up a table on the edge of the festival.  (Mrowka dep., p. 25.)  \nHowever, Plaintiff resisted, stating that he wanted to bring 90 people to the Festival.  \n(Mrowka  dep.,  p.  25.)    Sgt.  Mrowka  assured  Plaintiff  that  his  group  could  be \naccommodated at a location on Warren Avenue and Kingsley. (Mrowka dep., p. 25.)  \nPlaintiff  still  protested.    (Mrowka  dep.,  p.  25.)    Though  Plaintiff  alleges  that  he \nattempted to resolve this issue through Chief Haddad and the City’s legal department, \nneither he nor his counsel followed up on voicemails, nor returned a call made by the \nCity’s legal department in the week prior to Plaintiff filing this Complaint.  \nThe Temporary Restraining Order hearing \n  Plaintiff filed his original Complaint and Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder on June 16, 2010. A hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion was held before the Hon. \nNancy G. Edmunds on June 18, 2010.  Plaintiff argued that the sidewalks should not \nbe considered part of the Festival and that he and his group should have unrestricted \naccess to the sidewalks.  (Transcript of hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for a Temporary \nRestraining Order, p. 13, attached as Exhibit P. [Hereinafter “Tr.”].)  However, Judge \nEdmunds disagreed, finding that “there is a significant distinction between a public \nsidewalk that is a sidewalk during an ordinary weekend . . . and a sidewalk which is \ncontiguous to a festival which . . .  involves basically wall-to-wall people, over 250,000 \nover the three day period.  (Tr., p. 34.)  She concluded that the “area immediately \nadjacent to the street, separated only by a curb . . . [is] subject to the same crowd and \n9 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 22 of 40\nsafety concerns during the period of the fair as the street area itself.”  (Tr., p 35.)  \nJudge Edmunds ruled that the regulation and its enforcement are content-neutral time, \nplace, and manner restrictions that provide an alternative means of communication.  \n(Tr., p., 36.)  She cited Spingola v. Granville, 39 Fed. Appx. 978 (6th Cir., 2002), for the \nproposition that the sidewalks are not serving their normal function during the Festival, \nand that regardless of whether the Festival and sidewalks are considered a traditional \npublic forum or a limited public forum, “the same intermediate level of scrutiny” should \napply.    (Tr.,  p.  37.)    Accordingly,  Judge  Edmunds  declined  to  issue  a  temporary \nrestraining order.  (Tr., p. 38.)  She concluded by stating, \nI assume that the City of Dearborn and the managers of the festival \nwill still provide to the plaintiff the same accommodations that they \nwere willing to provide prior to this hearing. \n \n(Tr., p. 38.) \n  Dearborn’s counsel agreed.  (Tr., p. 38.)    \n  In light of Judge Edmund’s ruling, Plaintiff prepared for the Festival.  Initially, the \nArab Chamber thought it would be able to provide space inside a tent, but none was \navailable.  (Mrowka dep., p. 29.)  Plaintiff ultimately was provided the originally-offered \nlocation at Warren and Kingsley, pursuant to Judge Edmund’s direction. \n  Plaintiff was successful in reaching his audience at the Festival.  Plaintiff’s own \nphotographs demonstrate that members of his group mingled with the crowd, and that \npeople visited his booth.  (Exhibit Q.)  Plaintiff does not deny that he distributed \nliterature through the Festival without City interference.  He also conducted a training \nprogram  at  Dearborn’s  Hemlock  Park  and  canvassed  Dearborn’s  residential \nneighborhoods without objection.  (Saieg dep., p. 68, 109.) \n10 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 23 of 40\n  Plaintiff has vaguely alleged that he was “harassed” by City employees, but \nwhen pressed for details, Plaintiff could not identify a single instance of harassment by \nCity employees.  Instead, Plaintiff referenced the legal argument in his First Amended \nComplaint.  (Plaintiff’s answer to Defendants’ Second Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff \nGeorge Saieg, no. 1, attached as Exhibit R.)  While there were some incidents at the \nFestival that required police intervention, they did not involve any City employees, nor \ndid they arise from City actions, nor did they involve Plaintiff or ACP.   Rather, in one \ninstance, two individuals from another Christian outreach group known as Acts 17 \nApologetics  staged  an  ambush  interview  at  a  booth  promoting  Islam.    As  the \nconfrontation got heated, it caught the attention of private Festival security guards (not \nemployed or trained by the City of Dearborn).  A crowd gathered and migrated to the \nDearborn  Police  command  post,  at  which  time  officers  asked  the  two  ambush \ninterviewers to leave.  (Exhibit S.)   In a second instance, an individual got into an \nargument with a Festival security guard who took exception to the individual calling a \nwoman a “Jezebel,” which means “whore.”  (Exhibit T.)   These are exactly the types of \nsituations that create the need for a set of rules designed to control the crowds and \nprotect public safety. \nUltimately, these isolated disturbances should not take away from the peaceful \nexperience that Plaintiff and his organization had at the Festival.  Plaintiff does not \npoint  to  any  problems  at  booths,  including  his  own.    Perhaps  one  of  the  most \nsuccessful  booths  was  that  of  Dr.  Josh  McDowell,  another  Christian  minister  to \nMuslims who properly applied for a booth, and who had such a pleasant time that he \nwrote a letter to the editor describing his positive experience.  (Exhibit U.)   \n11 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 24 of 40\nFuture festivals \n  Plaintiff intends to visit Dearborn during the Festival weekend in 2010.  (Saieg \ndep., p. 66.)  Likewise, the Arab Chamber is preparing for a successful event in 2010.  \nMs. Beydoun will be in her second year leading the event.  She intends to ask to \nexpand  the  Festival  boundaries  to  accommodate  more  vendors  and  activities.  \n(Beydoun dep., p. 54-55.)  Again this year, any individual or organization wishing to \ndistribute literature or other materials will be required to do so from a booth.  (Beydoun \ndep., p. 54-56.)  The Arab Chamber also anticipates providing more training to their \nprivate security personnel.  (Beydoun dep., p. 78.) \nThe lawsuit\n  In  his  Amended  Complaint,  Plaintiff  alleges  violation  of  First  Amendment \nFreedom  of  Speech,  Freedom  of  Expressive  Association  and  Free  Exercise,  and \nFourteenth  Amendment  Equal  Protection.    Plaintiff  alleges  Defendants  are  liable \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983, and seek an injunction against the City enforcing the \nFestival rules requiring literature distribution to take place at a booth.  Defendants now \nmove for dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7) for failure to join all necessary \nparties, and for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, on all counts, on \nthe grounds that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the regulation is not a \nCity regulation, the Festival is not a City event, and any enforcement activities are \ncontent-neutral and premised on legitimate time, place, and manner regulations. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nSummary judgment is proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) where no genuine \nissue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \n12 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 25 of 40\nlaw.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  In \nevaluating a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and \ndraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.  Id.  The proper inquiry \nis “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a \njury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).  When confronted with a \nproperly supported motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must set forth \nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Mitchell v. Chapman, 343 \nF.3d 811 (6th Cir. 2003).  In this case, the evidence is so one-sided that Defendants \nshould prevail as a matter of law. \nARGUMENT\nI.  PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR FAILURE TO \nJOIN ALL NECESSARY PARTIES. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 19 provides, in pertinent part, \nA person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder \n  will  not  deprive  the  court  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction  must  be \n  joined as a party if: \n \n(A) in  that  person’s  absence,  the  court  cannot  accord  complete \nrelief among existing parties. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 19. \n \n  As a defense to a claim, a party may assert by motion failure to join a party \nunder Rule 19.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7). \n  In the instant case, Plaintiff asks this Court to enjoin Defendants from providing \ncrowd  control  and  public  safety  services  supportive  of  the  Festival  and  its  rules.  \nHowever, even if it is assumed for purposes of this Motion that Plaintiff is successful \n13 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 26 of 40\nagainst these Defendants, it would not change the rules of the Festival that require \nPlaintiff to submit an application, pay a fee, and limit materials distribution to a fixed \nlocation.    Likewise,  it  would  not  prevent  the  Arab  Chamber  from  deeming  the \nsidewalks to be part of the Festival, and asking for police protection.  Ultimately, the \nFestival is not a City event, no City ordinances are at issue in this lawsuit, and the City \ndoes  not  promulgate  the  Festival  rules  and  regulations.    Consequently,  the  Arab \nAmerican Chamber is a necessary party to this lawsuit, without which complete relief \ncannot be granted.  Because Plaintiff failed to join a necessary party, his Complaint \nshould be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 19. \nII.  THE STREETS AND SIDEWALKS SERVE AS FESTIVAL GROUNDS \nDURING THE ANNUAL ARAB INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL, AND ARE \nPROPERLY REGULATED AS A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM. \n \nThe most significant factor in this case is that the sidewalks are part of the \nFestival,  and  therefore  are  properly  subject  to  content-neutral,  narrowly-tailored \nregulations of First Amendment activity. \nThe  instant  case  is  controlled  by  the  Supreme  Court’s  ruling  in  Heffron  v. \nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981) and its \nprogeny.  In Heffron, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (“ISKCON”), \nsought  to  distribute  materials  during  Minnesota’s  State  Fair.    Heffron,  at  645.  \nHowever, the State Fair promulgated rules requiring that “all persons, groups or firms \nwhich desire to sell, exhibit, or distribute materials during the annual State Fair must \ndo so only from fixed locations on the fairgrounds.”  Id., at 643.  The rule did not \nprohibit speakers from traversing through the Fair and speaking to Fair-goers in face-\nto-face conversations provided that no materials were distributed.  Id., at 643-644.  \n14 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 27 of 40\nThough  ISKCON  compared  the  Fairgrounds  to  city  streets,  the  Court  recognized \ndistinctions: \nA street is continually open, often uncongested, and constitutes not \nonly a necessary conduit in the daily affairs of a locality’s citizens, \nbut  also  a  place  where  people  may  enjoy  the  open  air  or  the \ncompany of friends and neighbors in a relaxed environment.  The \nMinnesota Fair . . . is a temporary event attracting great numbers of \nvisitors for a short period to see and experience the host of exhibits \nand attractions at the Fair.  The flow of the crowd and demands \nof safety are more pressing in the context of the Fair.  As such \nany comparisons to public streets are necessarily inexact. \n \nId., at 651, emphasis added. \nIn upholding the rule facially and as applied to ISKCON, the Supreme Court \nnoted  that  the  Fairgrounds  were  a  “relatively  small  area,”  that  the  average  daily \nattendance on weekdays had been 115,000 people (160,000 on weekends), and that \nat least 1,400 other exhibitors and concessionaires rented space at the fair, including \nmany non-profit and religious organizations representing a broad spectrum of views.  \nId.,  at  643-644.    The  Court  also  recognized  that  the  First  Amendment  does  not \n“guarantee the right to communicate one’s views at all times or in any manner that \nmay be desired.”  Id., at 647.   \nThough  ISKCON’s  oral  and  written  distribution  of  its  religious  views  was \nprotected by the First Amendment and is an important ritual of the religion, the Court \ndeclared that ISKCON “and its ritual . . . have no special claim to First Amendment \nprotection as compared to that of other religions who also distribute literature and \nsolicit funds.”  Id., at 652.  The Supreme Court concluded that, if the rule was found to \nbe invalid with respect to ISKCON, it could not be considered any more valid with \n15 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 28 of 40\nrespect  to  other  organizations,  and  could  even  call  in  to  question  restrictions  on \ncommercial activity.  Id., at 653.  The Court stated, \nObviously,  there  would  be  a  much  larger  threat  to  the  State’s \ninterest  in  crowd  control  if  all  other  religious,  nonreligious,  and \nnoncommercial organizations could likewise move freely about the \nfairgrounds distributing and selling literature and soliciting funds at \nwill.  \n \nId., at 654. \n   \n  Accordingly, the Court upheld the regulation, providing that it was a valid time \nplace, and manner restriction that served a substantial government interest.  Id., at \n655. \n  The Sixth Circuit has applied Heffron to street fairs.  In Spingola v. Village of \nGranville, 39 Fed. Appx. 978 (6th Cir. 2002), the Sixth Circuit reviewed an ordinance in \nwhich  the  village  restricted  public  speaking  to  a  designated  area  of  a  street  fair.  \nSpingola  involved  a  two-block  fair,  at  which  the  plaintiff  –  a  self-described \n“confrontational evangelist” – had previously preached at various locations within the \nfair area.  Spingola, at 979.  After the ordinance was passed, he was restricted to a \nsingle location.  Id., at 980.  During the fair, the streets were closed to vehicular traffic.  \nId.   The plaintiff argued that strict scrutiny should apply because he sought to preach \non the “public streets,” which are traditional public fora.  Id., at 982.  However, the \nSixth Circuit declared that the plaintiff’s argument was “misguided,” stating, \nThe designated speaking area within the festival perimeters, though \ncomprised of public streets, is not serving that function during the \nfestival . . . Clearly, the festival area is more akin to a fair than a \nnormal city street.  But, regardless of whether we would classify the \nGranville  festival  area  as  a  traditional  public  forum  or  a  limited \npublic  forum,  as  a  content  neutral  regulation,  the  Ordinance  is \nexamined under the same intermediate level of scrutiny. \n \n16 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 29 of 40\nId., at 983. \n \n  In reaching this conclusion, the Sixth Circuit quoted Heffron, \n \nThe flow of the crowd and demands of safety are far more pressing \nin the context of the Fair.  As such, any comparisons to public \nstreets are necessarily inexact. \n \nId., at 983. \n \n  Thus, the Sixth Circuit ruled that, when public streets are closed off for a fair, \nthey can be regulated like the fairgrounds in Heffron.  In essence, the public streets \nare no longer public streets. \n  Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals has acknowledged that regulations \nrestricting picketing on capitol grounds could validly apply to the sidewalks just as they \ndo to the grounds, provided that the sidewalks are included in the area intended to be \nregulated.  Michigan Up & Out of Poverty Now Coalition v. Michigan, 210 Mich App \n162,  174,  n.  7  (1995).    Indeed,  the  sidewalks  “command  no  greater  status  as  a \ntraditional public forum” when they are within a regulated area.  Id. \n  In the instant case, as explained in the Statement of Facts, the streets and \nsidewalks that comprise the Festival grounds do not function as streets or sidewalks \nduring the Festival, and therefore are subject to the type of content-neutral regulations \napproved in Heffron and Spingola.  Consequently, by seeking to distribute literature on \nthe sidewalks, Plaintiff is seeking access to the Festival grounds, and must follow \nFestival rules requiring him to distribute from a designated location.   \n  Plaintiff’s Complaint suggests that the presence of some Festival activities on \nthe  sidewalk  frustrates  the  goals  of  maintaining  crowd  control  and  keeping  open \npassageways  through  the  Festival.    This  argument  parallels  the  argument  of  the \n17 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 30 of 40\nplaintiff in Spingola, who asserted that “the regulation does not relieve the crowding \nand pedestrian flow obstructions that take place during the festival.”  Spingola, at 984.   \nHowever,  the  question  is  not  whether  the  regulation  cures  all  obstructions  and \npedestrian flow problems, but rather “whether preventing uncontrolled public speaking \nin  these  areas  promotes  a  significant  governmental  interest  that  would  be  less \neffectively achieved without the law.”  Id.  It is sufficient that the rules provide “a \nsmoother  flow  of  traffic  within  the  festival  crowd.”    Id.    By  taking  control  of  the \nsidewalks, the Arab Chamber has been able to maintain open spaces throughout the \nsidewalk system for pedestrian passage from one area to another.  (Exhibit V.)  If the \nArab Chamber were to lose control, then the risks of overcrowding and disorderliness \nwould be multiplied exponentially, especially as other individuals, groups, and vendors \nmigrated to the sidewalks, just as the Supreme Court feared in Heffron.  This is \nespecially  a  concern  given  the  fact  that  as  many  as  300,000  people  attend  the \nFestival, and as the crowds gather, the streets are filled with people from curb to curb.  \n(Exhibit W.)  Consequently, the regulation at issue in this case does promote the free \nflow of pedestrians and traffic through the Festival.  Plaintiff’s Complaint should be \ndismissed. \nIII.  PLAINTIFF HAS NOT SUFFERED AN ABRIDGMENT OF HIS FIRST \nAMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. \n \nA. Standards for Content-Neutral Time, Place and Manner Regulations. \n \n“Even protected speech is not equally permissible in all places at all times.”  \nFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 479 (1988).  Content-neutral regulations of the time, \nplace, and manner of communicative activity are permitted where necessary to further \nsignificant government interests.  Id.   A content-neutral regulation is “justified without \n18 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 31 of 40\nreference to the content of the regulated speech.”  Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 320 \n(1988).  Even where an ordinance has an incidental effect on select speakers or \nmessages, it is considered neutral if it “serves purposes unrelated to the content of the \nexpression.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).   “The principal \ninquiry in determining content neutrality . . . is whether the government has adopted a \nregulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.”  Id.    \nContent-neutral regulations are evaluated under intermediate scrutiny.  Phelps-\nRoper v. Strickland, 539 F.3d 356, 362 (6th Cir. 2008).  The regulation must 1) serve a \nsignificant governmental interest; 2) be narrowly tailored; and 3) leave open ample \nalternative channels of communication.  Perry Education Association v. Perry Local \nEducator’s Association et. al, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983).  \nSignificant  government  interests  include  protecting  public  safety  during  a \nfestival,  ensuring  smooth  traffic  flow,  and  balancing  one’s  free  speech  against \nanother’s freedom to be free from hindrance.  Spingola, at 983.   \n“A statute is narrowly tailored if it targets and eliminates no more than the exact \nsource of the “evil” it seeks to remedy.”  Frisby, at 485.   The means of regulation, \nhowever,  need  not  be  the  “least  restrictive  alternative.”    Ward,  at  797-798.    The \nregulation will qualify as “narrowly tailored” if it does not “burden substantially more \nspeech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.”  Id., at 799.   \nFinally,  if  a  speaker  is  able  to  reach  his  “intended  audience,”  then  ample \nalternative channels of communication exist.  Phelps-Roper, at 372-373, citing Prime \nMedia, Inc. v. City of Franklin, 181 Fed. Appx. 536, 541 (6th Cir. 2006).  “Ample \nalternative channels” does not guarantee a person his “best means of communication.”  \n19 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 32 of 40\nPhelps-Roper, at 372.  Alternative channels do not need to exist “at every location, or \nat the most desirable location, within a city.”  Prime Media, at 541, citing Renton v. \nPlaytime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 53-54 (1986).    \nB. The  regulations  at  issue  are  content-neutral  and  satisfy \nintermediate scrutiny. \n \nThe regulations at issue in this case are not City ordinances, but rather rules \npromulgated by the Arab Chamber that are indirectly enforced by the City insofar as \nthe  City  provides  services  geared  toward  public  safety  and  crowd  control.    As \nexplained  in  the  Statement  of  Facts,  the  Arab  Chamber  requires  that  all  entities \nseeking to distribute information within the Festival area fill out an application, pay a \nfee, and limit their activities to a designated location.  Inasmuch as these regulations \nare universally applicable and were passed before the Arab Chamber was aware that \nthe instant Plaintiff would seek access to the Festival, the regulations are not designed \nin response to Plaintiff’s speech.  Accordingly, the regulations are content-neutral, and \nenforcement of the regulations need only satisfy the intermediate scrutiny standard.  \nMichigan Up & Out of Poverty Now, at 173.  \nAs expressly stated in the regulations, they are intended to promote pedestrian \ntraffic and an orderly Festival.  (Exhibit N.)  To the extent that the regulations are \nenforced by the City, the City’s significant interest is to keep sidewalks flowing, and \nmaintain crowd safety (Haddad dep., p. 18, 35-36; Mrowka dep., p. 15), each of which \nis  recognized  as  a  legitimate  government  interest.    Heffron,  at  651.    Thus,  the \nenforcement of Festival vendor regulations in this case is akin to the enforcement of \nsimilar regulations in Heffron and Spingola.   \n20 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 33 of 40\n  The regulations are also enforced in a narrowly-tailored fashion.  The evils \ntargeted by the regulations are pedestrian traffic overcrowding, threats to public safety, \nand  disorderliness  at  the  Festival.    Requiring  distribution  of  literature  from  fixed \nlocations and enforcing a perimeter around the Festival prevents these evils without \nrestricting people from mingling with the crowd or distributing literature from a fixed \nlocation.  In fact, Plaintiff even acknowledges the importance of a police presence, as \nhe asks for a police presence as part of his outreach efforts in order to “keep peace \nbetween both side[s].”  (Saieg dep., p. 34.)  Thus, the Festival rules and regulations \nare narrowly-tailored toward accomplishing their intended goals, just like the regulation \nat issue in Spingola. \n  Finally, Plaintiff has ample alternative channels of communication.  Even though \nPlaintiff was late in seeking space at the Festival, the Arab Chamber found a place for \nhis group to set up a booth, without even charging a fee.  (Mrowka dep., p. 25, 29.)  \nFrom the booth, Plaintiff distributed materials and discussed his message with visitors.  \n(Exhibit Q.)  Additionally, Plaintiff and his colleagues spread throughout the crowd to \ntalk with Festival attendees.  (Exhibit Q.)  Members of Plaintiff’s group also held a \nweekend-long training program at locations that included a City of Dearborn park, and \nthey went door-to-door throughout Dearborn’s residential neighborhoods.  (Saieg dep., \np. 52, 68, 109.)     \n  Plaintiff does not deny that he is reaching his intended audience.  He simply \nargues  that  conducting  his  activities  from  a  booth  is  not  his  preferred  means  of \ncommunication.  (Saieg dep., p. 75.)  While he also argues that the location of his \nbooth in 2009 (near children’s rides) was not ideal, he admits that the presence of \n21 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 34 of 40\nchildren would not actually deter him from approaching adults who are with children.  \n(Saieg dep., p. 29.)   Plaintiff admits that the City did not prohibit him from distributing \nliterature, tracts, DVDs, or any other materials during the Festival.  (Saieg dep., p. 89, \n90, 109.)  Plaintiff’s only goal in this litigation is to obtain unfettered access to the \nFestival.  However, the law clearly instructs that Plaintiff is not entitled to his “best” \ntime, place, and manner of expressing himself.  Phelps-Roper, supra, at 372.   \nThe regulations at issue are valid time, place, and manner restrictions, and \nPlaintiff’s right to free speech has not been infringed.  Summary judgment should be \ngranted to Defendants, and Plaintiff’s Complaint should be dismissed.   \nIV.  PLAINTIFF’S FREEDOM TO ASSOCIATE HAS NOT BEEN RESTRICTED. \n \nCount II of Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges infringement of his First Amendment \nright  to  freedom  of  association,  as  applied  to  the  states  through  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Freedom of association rights can be summarized as falling into one of \ntwo categories: 1) the State is not to intrude in an individual’s decision to “enter into \nand maintain certain intimate human relationships,” and 2) an individual has a right to \n“associate for the purpose of engaging in” activities protected by the First Amendment.  \nRoberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617-618 (1984).   An infringement of freedom \nof association may occur, for example, when the government “imposes penalties or \nwithhold[s]  benefits  from  individuals  because  of  their  membership  in  a  disfavored \ngroup,” requires disclosure of the members of an anonymous group, or requires that \nthe group accept members it does not desire.  Id., at 622-623.  Where freedom of \nassociation  is  implicated,  the  government  action  must  serve  a  compelling  state \ninterest.  Id., at 623-624. \n22 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 35 of 40\nThe regulations and enforcement activities at issue in this case do not implicate \nPlaintiff’s  right  to  freely  associate.    Nobody  from  the  Arab  Chamber  or  the  City \nprevented  Plaintiff  from  being  a  member  of  the  Arabic  Christian  Perspective \norganization or any other missionary organization, nor was Plaintiff told that he could \nnot bring his group of approximately ninety people to conduct a training program, go \ndoor-to-door throughout the City of Dearborn, or establish a booth and mingle with \nFestival attendees.  Likewise, Plaintiff was not prohibited from seeking out additional \nlike-minded people through these means, nor was Plaintiff required to associate with \nanybody who did not embrace his message.  Plaintiff’s Complaint is devoid of specific \nfacts supporting his freedom of association claim, and no evidence exists in the record \nto support this claim.  Because there has been no government violation of Plaintiff’s \nfreedom to associate, Count II of Plaintiff’s Complaint must be dismissed. \nV.  PLAINTIFF HAS NOT SUFFERED A VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHTS UNDER \nTHE FIRST AMENDMENT FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE. \n \nWhere a law is “neutral and of general applicability,” the law does not need to \nbe justified by a compelling governmental interest even if it has an incidental effect on \nthe exercise of a religious practice.  Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHiaeleah, 508 U.S. 520, 531 (1993).  An individual’s religious beliefs do not excuse \nhim from his obligation to comply with a valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is \nfree to regulate.  Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-879 (1990).  A law \nwill not be considered neutral if the “object of the law, whether overt or hidden,” is to \ninterfere with religious practice.  Mount Elliott Cemetery Association v. City of Troy, \n171 F.3d 398, 405 (6th Cir. 1999).  The courts generally do not strike down a law solely \non free exercise grounds, but rather must find a violation of a hybrid right – e.g., free \n23 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 36 of 40\nexercise plus free speech.  Smith, at 881.  Laws deemed to be neutral and of general \napplicability include a zoning ordinance enforced against a Catholic cemetery (Mount \nElliott Cemetery Assoc., at 405), and denial of tax exemptions to members of the \nAmish religion who did not believe in participating in governmental support programs \n(U.S. v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 258-261 (1982)). \nThe  regulation  involved  in  this  case  is  a  content-neutral  law  of  general \napplicability that does not infringe on Plaintiff’s free exercise or a hybrid right.  As \ndemonstrated,  supra,  the  regulations  at  issue  were  enacted  prior  to,  and  without \nreference  to,  Plaintiff’s  speech  or  religion,  thus  making  them  content-neutral  and \ngenerally  applicable.    Moreover,  the  regulations  have  been  applied  uniformly  to \nChristian groups, Arabic groups, and non-religious groups.  Significantly, Plaintiff has \nnot suffered a violation of his rights to free speech or free association, thus negating \nthe key component of his asserted hybrid right. \nVI.  DEFENDANT DEARBORN IS NOT LIABLE UNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983. \n \nPlaintiff  asserts  municipal  liability  under  42  U.S.C.  §1983  for  all  causes  of \naction.  A municipality can be held liable under §1983 only if “the municipality itself \ncauses the [alleged] constitutional violation at issue.”  City of Canton v. Harris, 489 \nU.S. 378, 385 (1989), citing Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 \nU.S. 658 (1978).  The plaintiff must demonstrate that the municipality, through its \ndeliberate conduct, “was the ‘moving force’ behind the injury alleged” – i.e., there must \nbe a “direct causal link between the municipal action and the [alleged] deprivation of \nfederal rights.”  Board of County Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).  \nSpecifically,  the  plaintiff  must  show  a  custom  or  policy  of  the  legislative  body  or \n24 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 37 of 40\nofficials acting on behalf of the municipality that results in the alleged constitutional \ndeprivation.  Id., at 403-404.  A municipality cannot be held liable merely because it \nemploys an alleged tortfeasor.  Id., at 403. \nIn the instant case, Plaintiff fails to assert a viable claim for municipal liability \nbecause his constitutional rights have not been deprived and there is no municipal \ncustom or policy at issue.  As clearly explained above, the regulation at issue was \npromulgated by the Arab Chamber.  Neither the City Council, the Dearborn Police \nDepartment, Chief Haddad, Sgt. Mrowka, or any other individual or body affiliated with \nthe City of Dearborn designed or endorsed the Festival rules or regulations.  To the \nextent the City enforced the regulations, it did so only to pursue the City’s legitimate \ninterests in crowd control and public safety.   \nFar from denying Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights, Defendants supported his \neffort to bring his message to the Arab Festival.  Despite the fact that Plaintiff was late \nin applying for a booth, Sgt. Mrowka worked with Plaintiff to find a place to set up a \ntable within the Festival.  Plaintiff was also allowed to participate in the Festival without \npaying the application fee.  Additionally, the Dearborn Police Department assisted \nPlaintiff’s group throughout the Festival, including fielding concerns that were brought \nby ACP-affiliated individuals to the officers stationed at the police command post.  \n(Mrowka dep., p. 31.)   \nBecause there was no constitutional violation, Plaintiff cannot demonstrate that \nthe City was a “moving force” behind any form of constitutional violation.  Defendant \nDearborn is not liable under 42 U.S.C. §1983, and summary judgment should be \ngranted in its favor.  \n25 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 38 of 40\nVII.  DEFENDANT HADDAD IS ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON \nTHE GROUNDS OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. \n \nDefendant  Chief  Haddad  is  also  entitled  to  summary  judgment,  as  Plaintiff \ncannot show a constitutional violation to defeat his qualified immunity.  To overcome a \nsummary judgment motion based on qualified immunity, 1) “the allegations must state \na claim of the violation of clearly established law and 2) “a plaintiff must present \nevidence sufficient to create a genuine issue as to whether the defendant in fact \ncommitted the acts that violated the law.”   Secot v. City of Sterling Heights, 985 \nF.Supp. 715, 720 (E.D. Mich. 1997).  To satisfy the second requirement in a First \nAmendment context, the plaintiff must show that the police official “would not have \nengaged in [the] conduct . . . but for the police officer’s intent to interfere with plaintiff’s \nfreedom of speech.”  Id.  It is not enough for the plaintiff to merely allege an improper \nmotive – there must be sufficient evidence to submit the question to a jury.  Id., at 721.  \nIndeed, in Secot, it was not enough for the plaintiff who was struck by an officer to \nsimply allege he was engaged in speech at the time and that the officer’s motivations \nwere an issue of fact.  Id.   \nThe instant case resembles Secot.  Even assuming for this Motion that this \ncase implicates “clearly established law,” Plaintiff cannot show an intentional violation.  \nPlaintiff merely alleges that his speech activity was regulated.  The regulations and \ntheir enforcement were content-neutral.  Chief Haddad has testified that the role of the \npolice department at the Festival is to provide crowd control and ensure public safety.  \n(Haddad dep., p. 35-36.)   Plaintiff presents only a bald allegation of improper motive, \nand the evidence clearly shows that Chief Haddad’s department was simply providing \n26 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 39 of 40\nroutine police support to a major event.  Summary judgment should be granted for \nDefendant Chief Haddad on the grounds of qualified immunity. \nVIII.  PLAINTIFF IS NOT ENTITLED TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \n \nTo obtain a permanent injunction, the movant must succeed on the merits of the \ncase by demonstrating that he has suffered a constitutional injury, and must further \nshow that he will suffer “‘continuing irreparable injury’ for which there is no adequate \nremedy at law.”  Women’s Medical Professional Corporation v. Baird, 438 F.3d. 595, \n602 (6th Cir., 2006).   \n  As already established above, Plaintiff’s claim fails on the merits.  Plaintiff failed \nto join necessary parties, no constitutional violation occurred, and Plaintiff does not \nmeet the thresholds for imposing §1983 liability.  Plaintiff has not suffered irreparable \nharm because he has many alternative channels of communication available to reach \nhis audience.  However, threats to public safety and the orderly execution of the \nFestival would be rekindled if the Festival’s rules and regulations were obliterated and \nthe City was not allowed to provide necessary police support.  Finally, the public \ninterest would be harmed, as the City would be prohibited from exercising its police \npowers, and Plaintiff would be given carte blanche to dictate how individuals and \norganizations participate in the Festival.  Accordingly, none of the facts upon which \nJudge Edmunds premised her denial of a Temporary Restraining Order have changed, \nand Plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction should be denied. \nCONCLUSION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF \nFor  the  reasons  stated  above,  Defendants  City  of  Dearborn  and  Ronald \nHaddad respectfully request that this Honorable Court grant their Motion for Summary \n27 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 41    Filed 04/09/10   Page 40 of 40\nJudgment  pursuant  to  Fed.

INTRODUCTION\nThis case is brought under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution.  Plaintiff George Saieg is the founder  and  former  director  of  Arab  Christian\nPerspective (“ACP”), a national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel of\nJesus Christ to Muslims.1  Defendants are the City of Dearborn (“Dearborn” or “the City”) and its\nPolice Chief, Ronald Haddad (collectively, “Defendants”).2  Plaintiff seeks a declaration that his free\nspeech rights were abridged when Defendants restricted the ability of Plaintiff and his associates to\ndistribute religious literature while walking around last year’s annual Arab International Festival\n1 ACP and George Saieg were the original plaintiffs in this case.  ACP was dissolved in\n2009, but Plaintiff and his associates continue their Christian ministry of evangelizing Muslims. \nOn January 15, 2010, ACP was voluntarily dismissed from this action, see docket entry 25,\nleaving only Saieg as a party plaintiff. \n2 Haddad is sued in his official capacity only.\n1\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 2 of 44\n(the “Festival”), which is an outdoor event organized by a private organization and held every\nsummer in Dearborn, Michigan.  Plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief preventing Defendants from\nimposing the same restrictions on his speech at this year’s Festival, which is scheduled for June 18-\n20, 2010.  Finally, Plaintiff seeks his reasonable attorney fees, costs, and expenses pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1988.3  Plaintiff does not seek monetary damages.\nPlaintiff filed his Motion for Summary Judgment and Request for Injunctive Relief on March\n15, 2010.  Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment on April 9, 2010.  After the parties\ncompleted their briefing, but before oral argument, the Court issued an order requiring Defendants\nto “designate . . . where Plaintiff’s booth/table would be located at th[e] [2010 Festival].”  See docket\nentry 55.  Defendants responded, stating that Plaintiff’s booth/table would be located within the\n“Artesian Tent,” which, according to the map attached to Defendants’ submission, is centrally\nlocated within the inner perimeter.  See docket entry 56.  That tent has night lighting.  Counsel for\nDefendants stated at oral argument that Plaintiff would receive the tent location free of charge.\nThese cross-motions mark a continuation of the case filed last year by Plaintiff and his then-\norganization, ACP, seeking to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the anti-leafleting ban against\nPlaintiffs, who wanted to carry out their Christian missionary activities at the Festival, which was\nheld on June 19-21, 2009.\nThe present action was filed on June 16, 2009.  The next day, on June 17, 2009—which was\ntwo days before the start of the 2009 Festival—Plaintiff filed an “Emergency Motion for Temporary\nRestraining Order” after learning that Defendants would not allow ACP members to distribute their\n3 Section 1988(b) authorizes a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorney’s fees\nto the prevailing party in a civil rights case.\n2\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 3 of 44\nreligious literature on the public sidewalks within the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival.  \nThe next day, on June 18, 2009—the day before the start of the 2009 Festival—Presiding\nU.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds held an evidentiary hearing on Plaintiff’s emergency motion\nand denied injunctive relief.4  Ruling from the bench, Judge Edmunds stated:\nthe question is really whether the restriction imposed by the organizers of the\nfestival and enforced by the City of Dearborn are neutral with respect to\ncontent and are justified under the restriction of time – places on time,\nmethod and place.  And it seems to me that they clearly are.  They do not\ndistinguish among the content of what’s being distributed or promulgated,\nthey are narrowly focused, they do provide an alternative means of access.\nIt’s not the method of access that the plaintiffs would choose if they could\nhave their way on this, but it appears to support a legitimate government\ninterest for crowd control and safety.\nDef. Ex. P., p. 36.  Judge Edmunds also held that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\nHeffron v. Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981), and the Sixth Circuit’s\ndecision in Spingola v. Village of Granville, 39 F. App’x 978 (6th Cir. 2002) (unpublished), both\ncases upon which Defendants heavily rely, control here, precluding the relief sought by Plaintiff.\nPlaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on July 7, 2009.  The Amended Complaint contains\nfour counts.  The first count alleges a violation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freedom of\nspeech.  The second count alleges a violation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to association.\nThe third count alleges a violation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise his\nreligion.  Finally, the fourth count alleges a violation of Plaintiff’s Fourteenth Amendment right to\nequal protection.  Although not the subject of an independent count in the Amended Complaint,\nPlaintiff also alleges municipal liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n4 A full transcript of the hearing is attached as Exhibit P to Defendants’ motion.\n3\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 4 of 44\nNow before the Court is Plaintiff’s Request for Injunctive Relief and the parties’ cross-\nmotions for summary judgment.  The matters have been fully briefed and the Court heard oral\nargument on May 21, 2010.  For the reasons that follow, Defendants’ Motion for Summary\nJudgment will be granted; Plaintiff’s Request for Injunctive Relief and Motion for Summary\nJudgment will be denied. \nII.  BACKGROUND\nA.\nPlaintiff, a Christian pastor with “a deeply-held religious conviction to evangelize non-\nChristians” and convert them to the Christian faith, is the founder and former director of ACP, a\nnational ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims.5\nSaieg Aff. ¶¶ 1, 3; Saieg Dep. at 15-16.  As stated by Plaintiff,\n[a]s part of my Christian outreach efforts, I travel around the country with\nfellow Christians attending and distributing Christian literature at various\nfestivals and mosques to exercise my religion and to follow my religious duty\n. . .\nSaieg Aff. ¶ 4.  Plaintiff’s religious materials, which are distributed free of charge to willing\nrecipients, “do not contain solicitations” or “commercial speech” – only “religious messages.”  Id.\n¶ 5.\n5 ACP dissolved in 2009 but its mission remains important to Plaintiff and his associates:\n[i]n  December  2009,  the  Board  of  Directors  voted  to  dissolve  ACP.\nNonetheless, my fellow Christians and I will continue our public ministry to\nevangelize  Muslims,  including  evangelizing  Muslims  in  the  City  of\nDearborn, Michigan . . . during the annual Dearborn Arab International\nFestival.\nSaieg Aff. ¶ 6.  See also Saieg Dep. at 16.\n4\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 5 of 44\nB.\nThe Festival is organized and operated by the American Arab Chamber of Commerce\n(“AACC”), a private organization.  Beydoun Dep. at 14.  The purpose of the Festival is to “bring\nas many Metro Detroiters to the East Dearborn area,” “promote the Warren Avenue Business\nDistrict,” and “build bridges from the Warren Avenue community to the Greater Metro Detroit\narea.”  Def. Ex. E, p. 3.  Festival events include a carnival, main stage with live performers,\nchildren’s tent, vendor and artisan tents, sidewalk sales, and multi-cultural food and entertainment.\nId. at p. 1; Def. Ex. D (flyer and program).\nFay Beydoun is the current Executive Director of the AACC, a position that she has held\nsince 2009.  Beydoun Dep. at 11-12.  As Executive Director of the AACC, Beydoun was the chief\norganizer of the 2009 Festival; she will also organize this year’s Festival.  Plaintiff has not sued the\nAACC.\nThe Festival is held in an area that envelops public streets and sidewalks in Dearborn.  See\nDef. Ex. F (map).  Thus, street closures by the City are necessary to facilitate the Festival.  See Def.\nEx. E (memo from the AACC to the Dearborn City Council listing street closure requests); Def. Ex.\nM (Dearborn City Council resolution approving the closure of streets); Def. Ex. I (memo regarding\nplacement of barricades on roads).  \n“Core” Festival activities—including the main stage, the carnival, the children’s tent, and\nthe vendor and artesian tents—take place within what the parties call the “inner perimeter,” which\nis defined by the following boundaries: western and eastern boundaries at Hartwell Street and\nKingsley Street, respectively; northern and southern boundaries at the front of the businesses located\non Warren Avenue, encompassing the sidewalks on Warren Avenue.  To the extent that core Festival\n5\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 6 of 44\nactivities occur on Miller Road, the northern and southern boundaries extend one block beyond the\nWarren Avenue businesses.  See Def. Ex. M (Dearborn City Council resolution listing Festival\nboundaries).  See also Beydoun Dep. at 41-42 (discussing Festival boundaries).\n“Ancillary” activities take place in what the parties call the “outer perimeter,” which is\ndefined by the following boundaries: western and eastern boundaries at Schaefer Road and\nWyoming Avenue, respectively; northern and southern boundaries at Morrow Circle and Blesser\nAvenue, respectively.  Defendants concede in their brief that “the outer perimeter [does] not include\nactivities such as carnival rides or vendor booths,” but rather “provid[es] a safe, controllable buffer\nbetween the bulk of the Festival activities and the outside world.”  Def. Br. at 4-5.6  Also within the\nouter perimeter is parking for both Festival-related and non-Festival-related traffic:\n[parking in the outer perimeter] was for people that were going to the\nbusinesses [on or around Warren Avenue], not just [for people] coming to\nattend the festival, and it was also for some [Festival] vendors.\nBeydoun Dep. at 43-44.\nA map of the inner perimeter is attached as Exhibit D to Defendants’ motion.  The main stage\nis located on the western edge of the inner perimeter; the carnival is located on the eastern edge of\nthe inner perimeter.  A series of tents line the space in between – from west to east along Warren\nAvenue: food booths, sponsor booths, children’s tent, and artisan tent containing forty booths.  See\nDef. Ex. D.  In total, the 2009 Festival featured fourteen food vending areas, seventeen sponsor\nareas, forty artisan booths, and twenty-five information tables, for a total of ninety-six booths or\ntables throughout the inner perimeter.  See id.  Beydoun anticipates that the inner perimeter will be\n6 The Festival organizers requested that this “buffer zone” be created  “between the open\nstreets and the area where the core Festival activities were occurring” “[t]o ensure an orderly and\nsafe transition from the open streets and the streets occupied by the Festival.”  Id. at 3. \n6\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 7 of 44\nexpanded at the upcoming 2010 Festival to accommodate additional sponsors and vendors.  Beydoun\nDep. at 54-55.\nThe Festival attracts hundreds of thousands of people.  Def. Ex. G (Dearborn Press & Guide\narticle).  More than 250,000 were expected to attend the 2009 Festival.  Id. \nC.\nThe Festival is organized by the AACC, not by the City.  However, as Defendants\nacknowledge in their brief,\nany large-scale event that occurs within the City of Dearborn inevitably\nrequires City services.  For example, the [AACC] cannot close the streets and\nsidewalks without the City’s permission.  (Exhibit E.)  Police support is\nneeded for crowd control, to maintain a perimeter around the event, and to\nensure public safety. (Transcript of deposition of Ronald Haddad, p. 15, 18,\nattached as Exhibit K. [Hereinafter “Haddad dep.”])  To facilitate this\nsupport, the Dearborn Police Department set up a command post within the\nFestival  boundaries.  (Haddad  dep.,  p.  52.)  Additionally,  the  City  is\nresponsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the streets and sidewalks.\nDef. Br. at 5.  Moreover, \n[t]o ensure orderly planning, the City sends representatives to meetings of the\nFestival  committee.    Five  meetings  took  place  for  the  2009  Festival.\n(Mrowka dep., p. 8.) City participants included Sgt. Jeffrey Mrowka and\nDeputy Recreation Director Eric Peterson. (Mrowka dep., p. 9.)  Mrowka is\nspecial events coordinator for the police department.  (Mrowka dep., p. 5.)\nPeterson is the special events coordinator for the recreation department.\nMrowka and Peterson ensure that organizations hosting events in the City\nobtain necessary approvals, and they identify the steps that will need to be\ntaken to maintain the public health, safety, and welfare during the event.\nId.  See also Beydoun Dep. at 21 (testifying that “[t]he City provides a lot of support for the festival\nand . . . they’re the key people that would help . . . facilitat[e] the festival and so forth, so [City\nofficials] were invited to the [AACC] meetings”); id. at 40 (testifying that City police officers are\nphysically present at the Festival to “ensure that sidewalks and traffic . . . [are] . . . maintained”); id.\n7\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 8 of 44\nat 77 (testifying that the AACC “coordinated with the police” in attempting to control handbilling).\nDearborn’s Chief of Police, Ronald Haddad, and its Mayor, both participated in the 2009 Festival\nopening ceremony.  Beydoun Dep. at 75.\nThe City granted permission to the AACC to conduct the 2009 Festival “subject to all\napplicable ordinances and the rules and regulations of the Police Department.”  Def. Ex. M\n(Dearborn City Council Resolution 5-330-09).  Via the same resolution, the City Council also (1)\nauthorized the road closures sought by the AACC, (2) authorized the use of certain City-owned lots\nfor off-site Festival parking, and (3) authorized assistance from the Dearborn Police, Fire, Public\nWorks, Building & Safety and Recreational Departments to “insure a safe[], healthy, fun and\nsuccessful event.”  Id.\nD.\nAs noted above, the Festival grounds include the sidewalk area along Warren Avenue.  Any\nexisting business along Warren Avenue that wanted to set up a sidewalk sale on the sidewalk in front\nof their store was required to submit an application to the AACC and obtain an AACC-issued\npermit/certificate.7  Beydoun Dep. at 31-32.\n7 For Festivals prior to 2009, any Warren Avenue business that wanted to set up a\nsidewalk sale at the Festival was required to apply to the City for a permit and obtain a City-\nissued permit/certificate.  This changed beginning with the 2009 Festival:\nA:  [I]n the past [before 2009] the city had issued the sidewalk sales\npermits and then after that [the AACC] had a discussion [with the\nCity] and it was agreed that the [AACC] would issue permits or\ncertifications allowing [Warren Avenue businesses] to have things\noutside . . .\nBeydoun Dep. at 31.  See also id. at 65.  According to Defendants, “this change in procedures\ncaused the sidewalks to become subsumed within the Festival boundaries.”  Def. Br. 7.\n8\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 9 of 44\nNon-Warren Avenue businesses, such as food vendors, artists, and private organizations such\nas ACP, were also allowed to participate in the 2009 Festival.  Such businesses and organizations\nwere required to submit a timely application to the AACC and pay a fee.  As explained by Beydoun:\nQ: Now, the tables and vendors that wanted to set up along Warren\nAvenue, did you have a separate process for them?\nA: Yes.\nQ: Was there a fee for individuals to set up a vending table or a tent\nalong Warren Avenue?\nA: We don’t allow just anybody to come and set up, and they’re not\nallowed to decide where they want to set up.  We have specific areas\nfor specific things.\nQ: If somebody wanted to do vending, wanted to sell food items but not\nbe on the sidewalk but wanted to be on Warren Avenue, was there an\napplication process that they would go through with [the AACC]?\nA: Yes.\nQ: Was there a fee associated with that?\nA: Yes.\nBeydoun Dep. at 33.  \nThe fee schedule applicable to non-Warren Avenue businesses/organizations wishing to\nparticipate in the Festival is attached as the last two pages to Defendants’ Exhibit O.  An\norganization wishing to distribute religious materials at the Festival would have to purchase an\ninformation table.  Beydoun Dep. at 50.  An information table costs $150 plus a $100 refundable\ndeposit.  Id.  A sign costs an extra $55, if needed by the business/organization.  Id.\nPlaintiff has never sought an information table through the AACC: “I never asked for a booth\nand I don’t want a booth.”  Saieg Dep. at 105.  Plaintiff wants to freely roam the public sidewalks,\n9\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 10 of 44\nhanding out religious literature, for the purpose of evangelizing Muslims; he does not want to\ndistribute his materials from a fixed location.  In 2009, the AACC provided Plaintiff with a booth,\nfree of charge.  This year, counsel for Defendants stated at the hearing on May 21, 2010, that the\nAACC would provide Plaintiff with a booth, free of charge, in the artisan tent, which is closer to the\nmiddle of the Festival than was last year’s booth location next to the children’s carnival.  Also,\nunlike last year’s fixed location, this booth is equipped with lighting to facilitate nighttime activity.\nE.\nThe Festival rules, which are promulgated by the AACC, prohibit “solicitation . . . outside\ndesignated vendor areas.”  Def. Ex. O, p. 3, ¶ 2.  The rules also prohibit “political solicitation.”  Id.\nat p. 2.  Beydoun conceded in her deposition that ACP’s activity, because it is not commercial in\nnature, would not fall under the definition of “solicitation.”  Beydoun Dep. at 53-54.  ACP’s activity\nalso would clearly not constitute “political solicitation.”  Thus, there does not appear to be any\nwritten rule, promulgated by the AACC, preventing the distribution of religious materials at the\nFestival.  Nonetheless, Beydoun testified that “handbilling along the sidewalks adjacent to the\nfestival” is not allowed.  Beydoun Dep. at 35-36.  As stated by Beydoun, “[i]f you want to distribute,\nthere is a specific place for you to distribute, which is at an information table.”  Id. at 51-52.\nBeydoun testified that the AACC was concerned about keeping the sidewalks clear for the benefit\nof both Festival-goers and non-Festival-goers alike: “[w]e wanted to make sure that the sidewalks\nwere available . . . for the people attending the festival [and] [for the] people that were trying to get\nfrom one location to another to go to the businesses.”  Beydoun Dep. at 37.  See also id. at 62 (“[t]he\nconcerns were that we wanted to make sure that there was a clear path for people, for pedestrians\nto be able to walk and to get from one place to another”).  Beydoun further testified that\n10\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 11 of 44\n[ACP] wanted to hand out items and we have the information tables for them\nto do that.  That’s how we control making sure that we have a safe\nenvironment by creating those information tables within the tents for them.\nId. at 54.\nBeydoun testified that, during the 2009 Festival, she was aware that “city police officers\nwere prohibiting individuals from distributing literature in [the] outer [perimeter].”  Beydoun Dep.\nat 55.  She expects that City police officers will again prohibit the distribution of literature in both\nthe inner and outer perimeters during the upcoming 2010 Festival.  Id. at 56.  Beydoun testified\nregarding the potential problems that could arise if handbilling was allowed in the outer perimeter:\nQ: [W]hat would be the pedestrian or traffic issues with . . . allowing\nindividuals to distribute literature in that outer boundary area?\nA: [I]f you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer\narea, you might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables\nand start selling things in that area, too.  That is the buffer between\ngoing in and out.  You got to maintain a security area.\nId. at 58.\nDearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad also testified that his officers patrolled the sidewalks\nduring the 2009 Festival to ensure that they remain clear and open.  Haddad Dep. at 17-18.  He\nfurther testified that handbilling on the sidewalks during the Festival “was not going to be\npermitted” because \nwe have rules where everybody is going to be in an assigned booth or table\nor tent, and anything that would delay the passage of anyone that would have\na free access to the sidewalk, anything that would occur there that wasn’t part\nof the sanctioned festival, it was not going to be permitted.\nId. at 18.8  Moreover, Haddad and his officers “were going to make sure that we kept the sidewalks,\n8 Haddad has extensive experience in law enforcement and, specifically, in crowd\ncontrol.  As he testified before Judge Edmunds:\n11\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 12 of 44\nknowing that it was going to be a very crowded situation, we were going to do our very best to keep\nthe sidewalks flowing.”  Id.  Dearborn police officers who observed an individual distributing\nliterature of any kind would be expected to stop that activity from occurring.  Haddad Dep. at 70,\n76.  Haddad testified that if the individual persisted despite a police warning to stop, the individual\nwould be subject to possible arrest.  Id. at 72. \nWith regard to handbilling at the upcoming 2010 Festival, Haddad testified as follows:\nI’m going to recommend that no one be allowed to give out any kind of free\nmaterial in a venue that swells up to a hundred thousand plus at any hour of\nthe day and that hopefully will attract 300,000 people in the course of one\nweekend.  I think it’s a bad practice.  I think that I’m not the only one that\nfeels that way.  You can go to the Michigan State Fair, they will not allow\nyou to give out a paper clip unless you’re stationary and at a booth.  It just\nmakes good sense, it’s a good practice and it’s not a standard that is applied\nindiscriminately, it’s across the board.\nId. at 95.\nI’m in my 35th year of law enforcement.  I spent 34 short years of my life in\nthe City of Detroit. . . . I worked for Chrysler security over their fire and\nsecurity at three major plants for nine months, and I’ve been the 18th police\nchief for the City of Dearborn since December 15th.\n* * * * \nI was assigned in charge of Detroit’s east side, and that included the\ndowntown area.  Also, southwest Detroit was attached to it, and I had the\noccasion to be the commanding officer of the 11th Precinct for eight years\nduring which time we did the Michigan State Fair for eight consecutive\nyears.  I was the task force commander there, as well.  And the short answer\nis yes, I’ve been assigned many jobs for crowd control.\n* * * * \nAnd I was also in charge of Homeland Security for six years as an added\nresponsibility for the City of Detroit, and I oversaw all major special events.\nDef.

Id. ¶ 9.  The\nFestival has grown in size every year.  The ability of Plaintiff and his associates to freely roam the\nFestival grounds distributing their religious literature became circumscribed beginning at the 2009\nFestival.  Plaintiff describes his experience at Festivals prior to 2009 as follows:\n9. For the five years prior to 2009 (2004-2008), I and other ACP\nmembers and volunteers visited the City during the Festival.  During\neach of these years, we freely roamed the public areas adjacent to and\nsurrounding the Festival, including public sidewalks, handing out\nreligious literature and discussing our Christian faith. \nSaieg Aff. ¶ 9.  See also Saieg Dep. at 80 (explaining that at Festivals prior to 2009, Plaintiff and\nhis associates conducted their outreach only on public sidewalks).\nHowever, at the 2009 Festival, ACP members were not permitted to freely distribute their\nreligious materials on the public sidewalks along Warren Avenue, as they had done in previous\nyears.  See Saieg Aff. ¶¶ 12-13; Saieg Dep. at 70-71. \nG.\nDearborn Police Sergeant Jeffrey Mrowka testified that the fixed location limitation applied\nequally to everyone wishing to distribute literature at the 2009 Festival:\nQ: My  understanding  is  you  couldn’t  even  distribute  literature\nindividually  within  the  festival  unless  you  were  in  your  fixed\nlocation, that’s right.\nA: In a fixed location, that’s right.\nQ: So if individuals were away from their booths trying to distribute\nliterature, either on the sidewalks or on Warren Avenue, that would\n13\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 14 of 44\nhave been stopped; is that right?\nA: Yes.\nQ: So the only location then – and then you said the outer boundaries\nthey weren’t permitted to do the same thing, is that right, distribute\nthe literature?\nA: Yes.\nQ: So the only place, then, in the City of Dearborn during the time this\nfestival was going on that you could distribute the literature would be\nbeyond those outer boundaries; is that right sir?\nA: In relationship to this festival, yes.\nMrowka Dep. at 32-33.\nH.\nPlaintiff states that ACP members were unable to reach their intended audience from the\neastern location.  According to Plaintiff, their tent/booth was not equipped with electricity and\n“[p]eople appeared unwilling to approach [their] location at night.”  Id. ¶ 36.  Additionally, because\nthe eastern location was near the carnival, “the vast majority of people who came to this location\nwere children.”  Id. ¶ 37.  As stated by Plaintiff, “[t]he ability to evangelize adult Muslims is made\nmore difficult if Muslim children receive materials from Christians because the adult Muslims get\nangry if this happens.”  Id.  See also Saieg Dep. at 74 (explaining that adult “Muslims get offended\nif you give gospel material to their children”).\nPlaintiff also complains that his 2009 tent/booth was far from the main stage area, which was\non the western edge of the inner perimeter: “[t]he majority of the people attending the Festival\ncongregated around the stage to listen to the free concert.  From our location, we were unable to\nreach these people with our materials.”  Id. ¶ 38.  As noted above, this year’s tent/booth location is\n14\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 15 of 44\ncloser to the main stage area, and not next to the children’s rides, and provides electricity to facilitate\nnighttime activity.\nPlaintiff states that it is essential to his mission that he and his associates be permitted to\nfreely roam the sidewalks of the Festival handing out their religious materials:\n39. It is very difficult to evangelize Muslims from a fixed location\nbecause there are severe penalties under Islamic law for converting\nto Christianity . . . . The Muslims who do approach us will inevitably\nbe watched by family, neighbors, and friends, subjecting them to\npossible ridicule, scorn, and punishment.  As a result, Muslims who\nare interested in Christianity are typically not willing to go to and be\nseen  at  a  location  that  is  known  to  be  occupied  by  Christian\nevangelists, such as ACP.  I have personally experienced this in the\npast, and I experienced this at the 2009 Festival.\n40. In order to reach our intended audience—Muslims who we want to\nconvert to Christianity—with our religious message, it is essential for\nus to be able to distribute our religious materials while walking on the\npublic sidewalks where the exchange between the Christian brother\nor sister and the person he or she is evangelizing is more personal and\nconfidential.  This allows the person receiving the religious materials\nto do so discretely and to read or view the materials in private at a\nlater time without being exposed to ridicule, scorn, or punishment,\nwhich is likely if the individual was seen receiving materials at a\nChristian “booth.”  In fact, it is not uncommon for a Muslim woman\nto take the Christian materials and hide them under her burqa for fear\nthat her husband will see her with them.  I have experienced this\nmany times myself.\nId. ¶¶ 39-40.  See also Saieg Dep. at 75-76.9\nWhen permitted to freely roam the sidewalks at Festivals prior to 2009, ACP members\ndistributed approximately 37,000 and 20,000 packets of religious materials at the 2007 and 2008\n9 In short, Plaintiff states that he wishes to reach Muslims who have “been [held] captive\nin their countries for years,” who have previously “not [been] allowed to hear about Jesus\nChrist”; in other words, “the people that are afraid to walk to a Christian booth.”  Saieg Dep. at\n96.\n15\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 16 of 44\nFestivals, respectively.

Thus, the speech restriction placed on ACP members at the 2009 Festival\n“severely limited [their] ability to distribute [their] religious materials” and consequently, ACP had\nto seek storage space for the leftover materials.

See also Saieg Dep. at 66.\nIII.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(b), a party against whom a claim is asserted may “at any time,\nmove with or without supporting affidavits, for a summary judgment in the party’s favor as to all\nor any part thereof.”  Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates that\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of an essential element of the\nnonmoving party’s case on which the nonmoving party would bear the burden of proof at trial.\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  “Of course, [the moving party] always bears\nthe initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying\nthose portions of ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of\n16\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 17 of 44\nmaterial fact.”  Id. at 323.\nA fact is “material” for purposes of a motion for summary judgment where proof of that fact\n“would have [the] effect of establishing or refuting one of the essential elements of a cause of action\nor defense asserted by the parties.”  Kendall v. Hoover Co., 751 F.2d 171, 174 (6th Cir. 1984)\n(quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 881 (6th ed. 1979)) (citations omitted).  A dispute over a material\nfact is genuine “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\nnonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-248 (1986).  Conversely,\nwhere a reasonable jury could not find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue of material\nfact for trial.  Feliciano v. City of Cleveland, 988 F.2d 649, 654 (6th Cir. 1993).  In making this\nevaluation, the court must examine the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnon-moving party.  Bender v. Southland Corp., 749 F.2d 1205, 1210-1211 (6th Cir. 1984).  \nIf this burden is met by the moving party, the non-moving party’s failure to make a showing\nthat is “sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which\nthat party will bear the burden of proof at trial,” will mandate the entry of summary judgment.\nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 322-323.  The non-moving party may not rest upon the mere allegations or\ndenials of his pleadings, but the response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in Rule 56, must\nset forth specific facts which demonstrate that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\nThe rule requires the non-moving party to introduce evidence of evidentiary quality” demonstrating\nthe existence of a material fact.  Bailey v. Floyd County Bd. of Educ., 106 F.3d 135, 145 (6th Cir.\n1997).\nIV.  ANALYSIS - FREEDOM OF SPEECH (COUNT I)\n17\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 18 of 44\nDefendants argue, as Judge Edmunds found in her ruling on June 18, 2009, that the City’s\nban on handbilling in both the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival constitutes a valid time,\nplace, and manner restriction under Heffron and Spingola.  Additionally, Defendants argue that the\nAmended Complaint should be dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7) for failure to join the\nAACC, a purported necessary party under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19.\nPlaintiff, on the other hand, contends that (1) this case is distinguishable from Heffron and\nSpingola, (2) Defendants may not, consistent with the First Amendment, ban handbilling on public\nstreets and sidewalks, and (3) the ban is not a valid time, place, and manner restriction because it\nis impermissibly content-based and does not satisfy intermediate scrutiny.  Additionally, Plaintiff\nargues that dismissal of this case for failure to join a party is unwarranted. \nThe Court first addresses Defendants’ joinder argument.  The Court then addresses whether\nthe handbilling ban in the inner and outer perimeters is a valid time, place, and manner restriction\nunder the First Amendment.\nA.  Should the Case be Dismissed for Failure to Join a Party?\nDefendants urge the Court to dismiss this case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7) because\nPlaintiff failed to name the AACC as a party defendant.  According to Defendants, the AACC is a\nnecessary party defendant because “even if . . . Plaintiff is successful against . . . Defendants, it\nwould not change the rules of the Festival that require Plaintiff to . . . limit materials distribution to\na fixed location.”  Def. Br. at 14.  For this reason, Defendants contend that “complete relief” could\nnot be granted to Plaintiff unless the AACC is a party.\n Defendants’ argument is unpersuasive because it ignores two crucial facts.  First, even if he\nwanted to, Plaintiff probably could not sue the AACC, a private organization, for First Amendment\n18\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 19 of 44\nviolations.  See Hudgens v. Nat’l Labor Relations Bd., 424 U.S. 507, 513 (1976) (“[i]t is, of course,\na commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against\nabridgment by government, federal or state”).  But see also Lansing v. City of Memphis, 202 F.3d\n821, 828 (6th Cir. 2000) (“a private entity can be held to constitutional standards when its actions\nso approximate state action that they may be fairly attributed to the state”).\nSecond, and more importantly, the City—and not the AACC—is the proper party defendant\nin this case because it is the City’s police officers who will be enforcing an “across the board” ban\non all handbilling (except for handbilling occurring from assigned booths).  As mentioned above in\nSection II(E), there is no written AACC-promulgated rule prohibiting religious handbilling.  The\nAACC-promulgated rules prohibit only “solicitation” (which, according to Beydoun, is meant to\ncover distribution of handbills of a commercial nature) and “political solicitation.”  Plaintiff’s\nreligious literature does not qualify under either of these two banned categories.  However,\nnotwithstanding the lack of a written AACC-promulgated rule banning all handbilling, Dearborn\nPolice Chief Haddad testified that he and his officers will be enforcing an “across the board” ban\non all handbilling at the Festival (except handbilling from a assigned booths).  Haddad Dep. at 18,\n70, 76, 95.  Haddad also testified that an individual handing out materials at the Festival in violation\nof the ban would be subject to possible arrest.  Id. at 72.  Plaintiff seeks an order preventing the City\nfrom enforcing, via threat of arrest, what he contends to be an unconstitutional speech restriction.\nSee Saieg Aff. ¶ 44 (“[m]y fellow Christians and I . . . . intend to, visit the City during the 2010\nFestival to distribute our religious materials . . . . However, because we are subject to arrest by City\npolice officers for engaging in this . . . speech activity in the City, we are deterred from doing so”).\nBecause Plaintiff seeks to enjoin Dearborn police officers from enforcing what is alleged to be an\n19\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 20 of 44\nunconstitutional speech restriction, the City and its Police Chief are the proper party defendants.\nDefendants’ joinder argument is unpersuasive.\nB.  Is the Handbilling Ban a Valid Time, Place, and Manner Restriction?\n1.  The First Amendment, Generally\nThe First Amendment—which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, see\nMurdock v. Commonwealth of Pa., 319 U.S. 105, 108 (1943)—declares, in relevant part: “Congress\nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.”  U.S. Const. amend I.  As stated by the\nSixth Circuit,\n[g]overnmental restrictions on the content of speech pose a high risk that the\ngovernment really seeks to suppress unwelcome ideas rather than achieve\nlegitimate objectives.  As a general rule, therefore, the government cannot\ninhibit, suppress, or impose differential content-based burdens on speech.\nNevertheless, courts will uphold such a regulation if necessary to serve a\ncompelling state interest and it is narrowly tailored to the achievement of that\nend.\nSpingola, 39 F. App’x at 982 (citations omitted).  “[T]he First Amendment does not guarantee the\nright to communicate one’s views at all times and places or in any manner that may be desired.”\nHeffron, 452 U.S. at 647.\nLaws that do not regulate speech per se, but, rather, restrict the time, place\nand manner in which expression may occur are treated differently.  Such laws\nburden speech only incidentally, for reasons unrelated to the speech’s content\nor the speaker’s viewpoint.  In considering such content-neutral, time, place\nand manner restrictions, the Supreme Court employs “intermediate scrutiny,”\nupholding limitations on the time, place, and manner of protected expression\nas long as “they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated\nspeech, . . . are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,\nand . . . leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the\ninformation.” \nSpingola, 39 F. App’x at 982 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).  Thus, time, place, and\nmanner restrictions are valid so long as they (1) are content-neutral, (2) are narrowly tailored, (3)\n20\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 21 of 44\nserve a significant governmental interest, and (4) leave open ample alternative channels for\ncommunication.\nFirst of all, this Court reiterates that Plaintiff and his fellow missionaries will be able to\nmingle throughout the Festival and talk to people.  Additionally, while circulating freely, they will\nbe able to wear pins containing a message.  The sole issue of contention is leafleting.  \nHeffron and Spingola both provide examples of speech restrictions that were upheld as valid\ntime, place, and manner restrictions.  In Heffron, the Supreme Court upheld a regulation on speech\nat the Minnesota State Fair, which was held on a 125-acre tract of state-owned land, that prohibited\nthe distribution of literature or the soliciting of funds except at a rented booth.  452 U.S. at 643, 656.\nThe Court held that the regulation was content-neutral because it “applie[d] evenhandedly to all who\nwish to distribute and sell written materials or to solicit funds” regardless of the speaker, viewpoint,\nor subject matter.  Id. at 648-649.  The Court also accepted the State’s argument that the regulation\nwas justified by a substantial state interest: protecting the “safety and convenience” of the fair-goers\nand ensuring the orderly flow of pedestrian traffic through the crowded fairgrounds.  Id. at 650.\nRelatedly, the Supreme Court held that “consideration of a forum’s special attributes is relevant to\nthe constitutionality of a regulation since the significance of the governmental interest must be\nassessed in the light of the characteristic nature and function of the particular forum involved.”  Id.\nat 650-651.  As stated by the Court,\nthere are significant differences between a street and the fairgrounds.  A\nstreet is continually open, often uncongested, and constitutes not only a\nnecessary conduit in the daily affairs of a locality’s citizens, but also a place\nwhere people may enjoy the open air or the company of friends and\nneighbors in a relaxed environment.  The Minnesota Fair, as described above,\nis a temporary event attracting great numbers of visitors who come to the\nevent for a short period to see and experience the host of exhibits and\nattractions at the Fair.  The flow of the crowd and demands of safety are\n21\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 22 of 44\nmore pressing in the context of the Fair.  As such, any comparisons to public\nstreets are necessarily inexact.\nId. at 651.  Finally, the Court held that the regulation left open ample alternative means for the\ncommunication of information because (1) the rule did not prevent members of the religious sect\nwho brought the case, the Krishna, from practicing their religion outside the fairgrounds and (2) the\nrule did not prevent Krishna members from mingling with the crowd, orally propagating their views,\nor arranging for a booth to distribute and sell their religious literature.  Id. at 654-655.\nIn Spingola, the Sixth Circuit upheld an ordinance requiring anyone engaged in public\nspeaking during a town assemblage to speak from a designated “public speaking area.”  39 F. App’x\nat 979.  The assemblage at issue was a street fair, drawing thousands of people over a two-block area\ncomprised of public streets.  Id. at 978.  There was no dispute in Spingola that the ordinance was\ncontent-neutral.  Id. at 983.  Relying heavily on Heffron, the court found that the fair area, “though\ncomprised of public streets, [was] not serving in that function during the festival.”  Id. at 983.  The\ncourt also held, citing Heffron, that the ordinance served the important governmental purposes of\nincreasing public safety during the festival, ensuring smoother traffic flow, and balancing free\nspeech with the rights of persons attending the festival to be free from hindrance.  Id. at 984.\nMoreover, alternative channels for speech existed because the ordinance called for a designated\nspeaking area and the plaintiff, a “confrontational evangelist,” could stand outside the festival\ngrounds if he chose.  Id. at 984-985.\nIn the instant case, the Court concludes that the site at issue is in reality a fairgrounds.\n2.  The Parties’ Arguments\n  The crucial question in this case is whether the “across the board” ban on mobile handbilling\nin the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival, which was enforced at the 2009 Festival and will\n22\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 23 of 44\nagain be enforced at the upcoming 2010 Festival, see Haddad Dep. at 18, 70, 72, 76, 95, qualifies\nas a valid time, place, and manner restriction.10  \nPlaintiff makes several arguments.  First, he broadly contends that Defendants may not,\nconsistent with the First Amendment, ban handbilling on public streets and sidewalks.  Second, he\nargues that the handbilling ban does not qualify as a valid time, place, and manner restriction.  In\nso arguing, Plaintiff attacks each of the four required elements of a valid time, place, and manner\nrestriction; specifically, he contends that the handbilling ban (1) does not leave open ample\nalternative channels for communication, (2) is content-based, (3) does not serve a significant\ngovernmental interest, (4) is not narrowly tailored.\nDefendants disagree with Plaintiff on each point.  According to Defendants, they may\nregulate handbilling on public streets and sidewalks and the restriction at issue here—the “across\n10 The Court takes this opportunity to clarify precisely what rule/regulation is being\nsubjected to constitutional scrutiny in this case.  Again, as discussed above, there is no written\nrule promulgated by the AACC banning all handbilling at the Festival.  Instead, the written\nFestival rules ban “solicitation,” which, according to Beydoun, covers commercial handbilling\nonly, and “political solicitation.”  These written rules are not at issue in this case because they\nare rules that are promulgated by a private organization and Dearborn Police Chief Haddad has\nnever indicated that he and his officers will be enforcing them.  Instead, Haddad indicated that he\nand his officers will be enforcing an “across the board” ban on all types of handbilling at the\nFestival, except for handbilling that occurs at designed booths.  It is this “across the board” ban\nabout which Plaintiff complains; it is therefore the “across the board,” police enforced ban that is\nthe subject of constitutional scrutiny.\nThus, the City has vowed to enforce a broad ban on handbilling in both the inner and\nouter perimeters of the Festival, except for handbilling from a designated booth/table.  Plaintiff\ncomplains about this police-enforced ban and, because Dearborn police officers did (in 2009),\nand will (in 2010), enforce it, the First Amendment applies.\nThe Court finds that the public streets on which the Festival is held are “not serving in\nthat function during the festival” see Spingola, 39 F. App’x at 983, rather, they comprise part of\na fairground.\n23\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 24 of 44\nthe board” ban on handbilling in the inner and outer perimeters—constitutes a valid time, place, and\nmanner restriction.\n3.  Discussion\nBefore addressing Plaintiff’s arguments, the Court first notes that the speech at issue in this\ncase is undisputably protected by the First Amendment.  See Murdock, 319 U.S. at 110 (“spreading\none’s religious beliefs or preaching the Gospel through distribution of religious literature and\nthrough personal visitations is an age-old type of evangelism with as high a claim to constitutional\nprotection as the more orthodox types [of religious practices]”).\nPlaintiff first argues that because the Festival grounds are comprised of public streets and\nsidewalks, Defendants may not, consistent with the First Amendment, ban handbilling on public\nstreets and sidewalks.  In so arguing, Plaintiff emphasizes in his brief that public streets are\ntraditional public fora and are thus “held in public trust,” Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 481\n(1988), as “proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion.”  Schneider v. State of\nN.J., Town of Irvington, 308 U.S. 147, 151 (1939).  While this is a component of the relevant First\nAmendment analysis, Plaintiff does not acknowledge that the Festival grounds here are analogous\nto those in Spingola inasmuch as both festival grounds are comprised of public streets that, in the\nwords of the Spingola court, are “not serving in that function during the festival.”  See 39 F. App’x\nat 983.  As such, Plaintiff’s reliance on cases such as Jamison v. State of Tex., 318 U.S. 413 (1943),\nMartin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943), and Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444\n(1938)—all of which involve the enforcement of speech restrictions on streets and sidewalks that\nare serving in their ordinary function as open streets and sidewalks—is misplaced.  This is because\n“[t]he flow of the crowd and demands of safety are more pressing in the context of [a] [f]air” and\n24\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 25 of 44\n“[a]s such, any comparisons to public streets are necessarily inexact.”  Heffron, 452 U.S. at 541. \nAdditionally, Plaintiff also fails to acknowledge that speech—even if taking place in a\ntraditional public forum—is subject to valid time, place, and manner restrictions.  See Spingola, 39\nF. App’x at 983 (“regardless of whether we would classify the . . . festival area as a traditional public\nforum or a limited public forum . . . , the Ordinance is examined under the same intermediate level\nof scrutiny”).  Therefore, the argument that Defendants may not regulate speech on public streets\nand sidewalks is unpersuasive.\nPlaintiff’s main argument is that the handbilling ban in the inner and outer perimeters of the\nFestival does not constitute a valid time, place, and manner restriction.  Specifically, Plaintiff\ncontends  that  the  handbilling  ban  (1)  does  not  leave  open  ample  alternative  channels  for\ncommunication, (2) is content-based, (3) does not serve a significant governmental interest, (4) is\nnot narrowly tailored. The Court addresses each of these requirements, in turn, below.  Ultimately,\nthe Court concludes that the ban on handbilling in the inner and outer perimeters qualifies as a valid\ntime, place, and manner restriction.\na.  Does the Handbilling Ban Leave Open Alternative Channels for Communication?\n \nPlaintiff argues that \nby banning the distribution of religious literature on the sidewalk and in other\npublic areas and forcing Plaintiff to a fixed location, Defendants’ restriction\ndoes not leave open ample alternative means of communication, and it\nprevents Plaintiff from reaching his intended audience in violation of the\nConstitution.\nPl. Br. at 18-19.  Heffron and Spingola preclude Plaintiff’s argument.  The speech restriction at issue\nin Heffron prohibited the distribution of literature or the soliciting of funds at the Minnesota State\nFair except at a rented booth.  The Supreme Court found that the restriction left open ample\n25\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 26 of 44\nalternative means for the communication of information because (1) the regulation did not prevent\nKrishna members from practicing their religion outside the fairgrounds and (2) the regulation did\nnot prevent Krishna members from mingling with the crowd, orally propagating their views, or\narranging for a booth to distribute and sell their religious literature.  See 452 U.S. at 654-655.  \nSimilarly, in Spingola, the Sixth Circuit held that alternative channels for speech existed\nbecause the ordinance, which required anyone engaged in public speaking during a town assemblage\nto speak from a designated “public speaking area,” called for a designated speaking area and the\nplaintiff, a “confrontational evangelist,” could stand outside the festival grounds if he chose.  See\n39 F. App’x at 985-985.  \nSo too, the instant case.  There is no allegation that Plaintiff missionaries were in anyway\nprohibited or discouraged from distributing their religious literature outside the Festival boundaries.\nNor does Plaintiff allege that then-ACP members were prevented from mingling with the Festival\ncrowd and orally propagating their religious views; Plaintiff and his associates were only prevented\nfrom  distributing  literature  outside  of  their  designated  booth.    Finally,  then-ACP  members\ncould—and did at the 2009 Festival—utilize a booth to distribute their religious literature.11  They\nwill be permitted to do the same at the 2010 Festival.12  This year, Plaintiff will receive a booth, free\nof charge, with electricity to facilitate evening activities, and a location closer to the center of the\nFestival.\nPlaintiff and his fellow missionaries have never been denied access to the Festival forum,\n11 As noted in the background section, the AACC waived Plaintiff’s rental fee.\n12 During oral argument, counsel for Defendants indicated that the AACC would waive\nPlaintiff’s rental fee, as it did last year.\n26\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 27 of 44\nnor have they been denied the opportunity to interact with their intended audience, Festival-goers.\nThus, the case upon which Plaintiff relies—Bay Area Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224,\n1229-1230 (9th Cir. 1990), where the speech restriction in question prevented the plaintiff from\nreaching its intended audience with its message—is inapposite.  In short, the very same alternative\navenues of communication are available to Plaintiff in this case as were available to the respective\nplaintiffs in both Heffron and Spingola.  These alternative avenues were deemed constitutionally\nadequate by the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit in Heffron and Spingola, respectively; they are\nconstitutionally adequate here, as well.\nThe Court acknowledges Plaintiff’s complaint that “[p]eople appeared unwilling to approach\n[the booth] location at night” because their tent was not equipped with electricity, see Saieg Aff. ¶\n36, and the tent was not ideally located because it was near the children’s area.  Id. ¶ 38.  This year,\nthe tent is equipped with electricity, and the location is not in the children’s area, but instead in the\ncentral area.  \nThe  Constitution  does  not  guarantee  a  person  “her  best  means  of  communication.”\nPhelps-Roper v. Strickland, 539 F.3d 356, 372 (6th Cir. 2008) (citing Heffron, 452 U.S. at 647 (“the\nFirst Amendment does not guarantee the right to communicate one’s views at all times and places\nor in any manner that may be desired”)).  See also Prime Media, Inc. v. City of Franklin, Tenn., 181\nF. App’x 536, 541 (6th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (“alternative channels of communication need not\nbe available at every location, or at the most desirable location, within a city”).  Plaintiff and his\nfellow missionaries will not be denied access to the Festival forum, nor denied the opportunity to\ninteract with their intended audience.  Under these circumstances, notwithstanding Plaintiff’s\ncomplaints, alternative channels for communication of their message remained sufficiently open.\n27\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 28 of 44\nSee Heffron, 452 U.S. at 654-655; Spingola, 39 F. App’x at 985-985.\nb.  Is the Handbilling Ban Content-Neutral?  \n“[A]bove all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict\nexpression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”  Police Dep’t of City\nof Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972).  Thus,\n[g]overnment action that stifles speech on account of its message . . .\ncontravenes this essential [First Amendment] right.  Laws of this sort pose\nthe inherent risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate\nregulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate\nthe public debate through coercion rather than persuasion.\nTurner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Fed. Commc’n Comm’n, 512 U.S. 622, 641 (1994).  For this reason,\ncontent-based  regulations  are  subject  to  “the  most  exacting  scrutiny,”  id.  at  642,  and  are\n“presumptively invalid.”  R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992).\nPlaintiff argues that the ban on handbilling is content-based and therefore subject to strict\nscrutiny.  Plaintiff believes that the ban favors commercial speech in violation of the First\nAmendment because it permits local businesses along Warren Avenue, and no one else, to set up\nsidewalk sales immediately outside their respective storefronts.13  Plaintiff relies mainly upon the\nfollowing three cases in support of his argument, all of which hold that the government cannot favor\ncommercial speech over non-commercial speech, or vice-versa: S.O.C., Inc. v. County of Clark, 152\nF.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998) (invalidating as content-based an ordinance that prohibited the\ndistribution of handbills that contain commercial advertising while allowing the distribution of\nhandbills that did not contain commercial advertising); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453\n13 Plaintiff also argues that the ban violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal\nprotection for the same reason.\n28\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 29 of 44\nU.S. 490, 513 (1981) (White, J., plurality opinion) (invalidating as content-based a city ordinance\nthat, among other things, favored commercial advertisements on billboards over non-commercial\nadvertisements);  City  of  Cincinnati  v.  Discovery  Network,  Inc.,  507  U.S.  410,  429  (1993)\n(invalidating as content-based a city regulation banning newsracks that distributed commercial\nhandbills but not newsracks that distributed newspapers).  The regulations in each of these cases\nwere invalidated essentially because, in the words of the Ninth Circuit, “an officer who seeks to\nenforce the [regulation] would need to examine the contents of the handbill to determine whether\nits distribution was prohibited.”  See S.O.C., Inc., 152 F.3d at 1145.\nDefendants, on the other hand, argue that the ban on handbilling is content-neutral:\nPlaintiff has taken great pains to argue that distinctions have been made\nbetween commercial and non-commercial speech, but the evidence clearly\ndemonstrates that no such content-based decisions were made.  First and\nforemost, . . . the sidewalks were not functioning as sidewalks, but instead\nwere incorporated in to the Festival grounds, and the [AACC] was granted\nthe same control over the sidewalks that it had over the streets during the\nFestival.  Beydoun explained, “we don’t allow just anybody to come and set\nup, and they’re not allowed to decide where they want to set up.  We have\nspecific areas for specific things.”  (Beydoun dep., at 33.)  For example, there\nwere numerous themed tents – one for food vendors, one for artists, and one\nfor children’s activities.  (Exhibit D.)  The Warren Avenue businesses\neffectively constitute their own themed area of the Festival, and they are able\nto take advantage of their location by setting up in front of their business,\nwhen logically feasible.  (Beydoun dep., p. 36.)\n \nResp. Br. at 21.\nDefendants’ position is persuasive.  One of the stated purposes of the Festival is  to “promote\nthe Warren Avenue Business District.”  Def. Ex. E, p. 3.  Thus, the AACC affords anyone who\noccupies existing store space along Warren Avenue, subject to logistical concerns, the opportunity\n29\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 30 of 44\nto utilize the sidewalk in front of their store during the Festival.14  As Defendants note, and the Court\nagrees, “[t]he Warren Avenue businesses effectively constitute their own themed area of the\nFestival, and they are able to take advantage of their location by setting up in front of their business,\nwhen logically feasible.”  \nTo the extent that Defendants enforce the AACC’s rule permitting occupants of space along\nWarren Avenue to set up on the sidewalk outside their storefronts at the exclusion of those who do\nnot occupy space along Warren Avenue, the restriction is not content-based because no expression\nis being restricted based on “its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”  See Mosley,\n408 U.S. at 95.  Rather, Defendants, by enforcing the AACC’s rule, are favoring, if anyone, those\nwith space along Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their message.  In reality, this is\na quid pro quo for stores negatively impacted by the Festival.  In exchange for subjecting them to\nFestival crowds in front of their stores and closed-off streets that block regular customers’ ingress\nand egress, the existing merchants are permitted to set up tables out front to sell their wares.  Thus,\nif ACP had an existing office located in the inner perimeter along Warren Avenue, there is nothing\n14 Beydoun testified that only businesses along Warren Avenue were permitted to be\nsidewalk vendors:\nQ: Is there anybody other than the businesses [along Warren Avenue]\nwho were the sidewalk vendors?\n* * * *\nA: No.\nQ: So the sidewalk vendors are essentially the businesses along\nWarren Avenue?\nA: That is correct.\nBeydoun Dep. at 64-65.\n30\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 31 of 44\nin the record to suggest that it could not set up a table outside its office like everyone else occupying\nspace along Warren Avenue.  In other words, there is nothing to suggest that the criterion to set up\na sidewalk sale along Warren Avenue has anything to do with the message of the occupant, or the\nsubject matter of the occupant’s speech (i.e., commercial versus non-commercial); rather, the\ncriterion is that the occupant simply occupy space in the inner perimeter along Warren Avenue.  See\nBeydoun Dep. at 65 (testifying that the sidewalk vendors along Warren Avenue are Warren Avenue\nbusinesses).    Because  Defendants  are  not  enforcing  a  restriction  on  expression  that  favors\ncommercial speech over non-commercial speech, the cases cited by Plaintiff, discussed above, are\nnot controlling.15\nc.  Does the Handbilling Ban Serve a Substantial Governmental Interest?\nIn Heffron, the Supreme Court held that the government’s interest in ensuring the orderly\nflow of pedestrian traffic through a crowded fairgrounds constitutes a substantial governmental\ninterest.  See 452 U.S. at 650.  The Sixth Circuit, in Spingola, held the same.  See 39 F. App’x at\n984.  Indeed, Judge Edmunds also held the same in the instant case, in denying Plaintiff’s request\nfor a temporary restraining order last year.  \nDefendants argue that the holdings in Heffron and Spingola apply with equal force here\nbecause the goals underlying the handbilling ban are the same as those proffered by the governments\n15 For the same reason, Plaintiff’s equal protection claim fails.  The case upon which\nPlaintiff relies in support of his equal protection claim, Mosley, is inapplicable.  In Mosley, the\nSupreme Court held that a city ordinance prohibiting all picketing within 150 feet of a school,\nexcept peaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute, violated the Equal Protection\nClause because it makes an impermissible distinction between peaceful labor picketing and other\npeaceful picketing.  Id. at 94.  Here, on the other hand, as explained, occupants along Warren\nAvenue are conferred the right to conduct sidewalk sales during the Festival because of their\nlocation alone, not because of a message, idea, or subject matter of speech espoused by the\noccupant.\n31\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 32 of 44\nin both Heffron and Spingola.  Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the holdings are inapplicable\nhere for two reasons.  First, Plaintiff points out that the fairgrounds in Heffron were not located on\npublic streets and sidewalks as are the Festival grounds here.  Thus, as Plaintiff notes, “the fair [in\nHeffron] occurred at a closed, fixed location entirely dedicated for that purpose—there was no\nongoing business activity on the fairgrounds nor pedestrian traffic moving through that was\nunrelated to the fair.”  Pl. Br. at 19.  Plaintiff contends that Heffron is inapplicable here based on this\ndistinction.  In Heffron, everyone on the fairgrounds was there for the fair; here, because the Festival\ntakes place on public streets that are lined with stores that are open to Festival-goers and non-\nFestival-goers alike, not everyone at the Festival, presumably, was there for the Festival – some\nwere there for matters unrelated to the Festival.\nThis argument is foreclosed by Spingola.  The fair at issue in Spingola took place over a two-\nblock area comprised of public streets in the Village of Granville.  See 39 F. App’x at 978.  Thus,\nin upholding the public speaking ban at issue in Spingola as a valid time, place, and manner\nrestriction, the Sixth Circuit applied the Heffron holding to a venue, like the one here, that was\ncomprised of public streets and was open to pedestrian traffic unrelated to the fair.\nPlaintiff’s second argument as to why Heffron does not apply here is also unpersuasive.\nPlaintiff argues that the presence of some Festival activities on the sidewalk along Warren Avenue\nfrustrates the government’s stated goal of ensuring the orderly flow of pedestrian traffic through the\ncrowded Festival.  As stated by Plaintiff, “it makes little sense to permit businesses to set up fixed\nlocations that plainly block the public sidewalks and then prohibit individuals from distributing\nnoncommercial, religious literature in the same forum.”  Pl. Br. at 17.  However, a similar argument\nwas made by the plaintiff, and rejected by the Sixth Circuit, in Spingola:\n32\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 33 of 44\nSpingola argues that the [public speaking] regulation does not relieve the\ncrowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place during the festival\nregardless.  That, however, is not the question. The question is whether\npreventing uncontrolled public speaking in these areas promotes a significant\ngovernmental interest that would be less effectively achieved without the\nlaw.  That is accomplished by providing a smoother flow of traffic within the\nfestival crowd.\n39 F. App’x at 984.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s second argument, like his first one, is foreclosed by\nSpingola.\nBased on the Supreme Court’s holding in Heffron and the Sixth Circuit’s holding in\nSpingola, Defendants’ proffered justifications for the handbilling ban—maintaining crowd control,\nrelieving  pedestrian  congestion,  and  ensuring  an  orderly  Festival—constitute  substantial\ngovernmental interests.\nd.  Is the Handbilling Ban Narrowly Tailored to Serve \nthe City’s Substantial Governmental Interests?\nAs stated by the Sixth Circuit, \ntime, place, and manner regulations of speech must be narrowly tailored to\nserve  the  government’s  legitimate,  content-neutral  interests.    Narrow\ntailoring means that the “[g]overnment may not regulate expression in such\na manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to\nadvance its goals,” but it does not require that the means chosen “be the least\nrestrictive or least intrusive means” of serving its goals.  “Rather, the\nrequirement  of  narrow  tailoring  is  satisfied  so  long  as  the  regulation\npromotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively absent the regulation.”\nRichland Bookmart, Inc. v. Knox County, Tenn., 555 F.3d 512, 528 (6th Cir. 2009) (citations\nomitted).  For example, in United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171 (1983), a case upon which Plaintiff\nheavily relies, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a broad restriction on speech on the\npublic sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court’s building.  The regulation banned, in part, the\ndisplay of “any flag, banner, or device designed . . . to bring into public notice any party,\n33\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 34 of 44\norganization, or movement.”  Id. at 175.  The purpose of the regulation was to “provide for the\nprotection of the [Supreme Court] building and grounds and of the persons and property therein, as\nwell as the maintenance of proper order and decorum.”  Id. at 182.  The Court found that the\nregulation was not a valid time, place, and manner restriction “because it ha[d] an insufficient nexus\nwith any of the public interests that may be thought to undergrid [it].”  Id. at 181.  In other words,\nthe regulation did “not sufficiently serve those public interests that [were] urged as its justification.”\nId.  See also Nat’l Ass’n for Advancement of Colored People v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963)\n(“[b]road prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect.  Precision of regulation must\nbe the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms”).\nPlaintiff argues that the City’s goals of maintaining crowd control, relieving pedestrian\ncongestion, and ensuring an orderly Festival are not furthered by prohibiting handbilling in the outer\nperimeter.  This is because the outer perimeter is not crowded with wall-to-wall people as is the\ninner perimeter, which serves as the actual Festival grounds.  As stated by Plaintiff,\nDefendants do not limit their speech restriction to the public sidewalks\nimmediately adjacent to where the Festival activities are taking place on\nWarren Avenue and Miller Road.  Instead, they created a broad, prophylactic\nprohibition on the distribution of literature that extends beyond the actual\nFestival grounds to include more than 30 surrounding City blocks (“outer\nperimeter”).  Consequently, the City has created a “First-Amendment-free-\nzone” that has little to no connection with the Festival.\nPl. Br. at 17 (footnote omitted).  Via this argument, then, Plaintiff is challenging the handbilling ban\nin the outer perimeter only, asserting that the ban is not narrowly tailored to alleviate the City’s\ncrowd control concerns since those concerns are not implicated in the uncrowded outer perimeter.\nPlaintiff does not mount a “narrow tailoring” challenge with respect to the enforcement of the\nhandbilling ban in the inner perimeter.  For the reasons that follow, the Court rejects Plaintiff’s\n34\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 35 of 44\nargument and finds that the ban on handbilling in the outer perimeter is narrowly tailored to serve\nthe City’s legitimate and substantial interest in ensuring an orderly Festival.\nThe outer perimeter runs approximately five blocks to the west of the western edge of the\ninner perimeter, covering the following blocks: Rueter Avenue, Jonathon Street, Bingham Street,\nCalhoun Street, and Schaefer Highway.  The outer perimeter runs approximately four blocks to the\neast of eastern edge of the inner perimeter, covering the following blocks: Emanon Street, Freda\nStreet, Normile Street, and Wyoming Avenue.16\nThe stated purpose of the outer perimeter is to “provid[e] a safe, controllable buffer between\nthe bulk of the Festival activities and the outside world” in order “[t]o ensure an orderly and safe\ntransition from the open streets and the streets occupied by the Festival.”  Def. Br. at 3-4.  See\nMrowka Dep. at 15 (testifying that the purpose of the outer perimeter is to “restrict traffic and crowd\ncontrol into the festival area”).  There is no dispute that this constitutes a substantial interest under\nHeffron.  See 452 U.S. at 650 (“it is clear that a State’s interest in protecting the ‘safety and\nconvenience’ of persons using a public forum is a valid governmental objective”).  Rather, the\ndispute is whether a handbilling prohibition in the outer perimeter is narrowly tailored to serve the\nCity’s interest.  The Court finds that it is.\nIt is crucial to note that this case is not just about Plaintiff’s right to exercise his First\nAmendment rights in the outer perimeter; it is about the right of everyone to do so.  That is, if the\nCourt  struck  down  the  ban  as  unconstitutional,  everyone—not  just  Plaintiff  and  his\nassociates—would be permitted to distribute literature in the outer perimeter.  Organizations of all\n16 Plaintiff’s briefs contain repeated references to an outer perimeter that is “30 blocks” in\nsize.  This description is misleading because, as discussed, the outer perimeter runs only one\nblock to the north and south of the inner perimeter and five and four blocks, respectively, to the\nwest and east of the inner perimeter. \n35\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 36 of 44\nkinds, businesses, and individuals alike would all flock to the outer perimeter to promote their\nrespective interests and messages.  The consequence of this would be to effectively extend the\nFestival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the\noutside world.  This result would undermine the legitimate and substantial interest of the City to\n“ensure an orderly and safe transition from the open streets and the streets occupied by the Festival.”\nIt is for this reason that a ban on handbilling in the outer perimeter is narrowly tailored.  A result to\nthe contrary would severely undercut the City’s substantial interest in maintaining a safe zone, clear\nof wall-to-wall Festival crowds, between the Festival grounds and the outside world.\nIt is also for this reason that the Court finds the Supreme Court’s decision in Grace\ninapplicable here.  In Grace, the ban on certain communicative activity on the public sidewalks\nsurrounding the Supreme Court building did not sufficiently serve the government’s interest in\nprotecting the Supreme Court grounds and maintaining proper order and decorum.  There was an\n“insufficient nexus” between the ban and the public interests undergridding it.  In other words, the\nGrace Court effectively held that the government could accomplish its goals, which were deemed\nto be substantial governmental interests, without imposing the ban.  The same is not true here for\nthe reasons stated in the preceding paragraph.  Without a ban on the distribution of literature in the\nouter perimeter—which is meant to serve as a safe zone for three days out of the year—the City\ncould not accomplish its goal.\nThe  Court  also  finds  Grace  distinguishable  because  the  ban  in  Grace  applied  to\ncommunicative activity taking place on sidewalks that were serving in their traditional function as\nsidewalks.  See Grace, 461 U.S. at 179 (“[t]he sidewalks comprising the outer boundaries of the\n[Supreme] Court grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in Washington, D.C., and\n36\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 37 of 44\nwe can discern no reason why they should be treated any differently”).  The same is not true here.\nFor three days out of the year, the streets and sidewalks of the outer perimeter are not serving as\ntraditional streets and sidewalks; rather, they are serving in an entirely different role.  See Heffron,\n452 U.S. 651 (“[t]he flow of the crowd and demands of safety are more pressing in the context of\n[a] Fair.  As such, any comparisons to public streets are necessarily inexact”).  For these reasons,\nGrace is not controlling here.  \nThe Court analogizes the two perimeters to airport traffic; the inner perimeter is like the main\nrunway, while the outer perimeter is like a taxiway which serves the purpose of unimpeded ramp\nup and ramp down of traffic speeds into the inner perimeter.\nFor the reasons stated above, the Court finds that the handbilling ban in the inner and outer\nperimeters meets the requirements for a valid time, place, and manner restriction on speech.\nAccordingly, summary judgment will be granted in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff’s First\nAmendment free speech claim.\nV.  ANALYSIS - FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION (COUNT II)\nDefendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment in their favor on Plaintiff’s\nfreedom of association claim.  Plaintiff does not seek summary judgment on this claim, and the\nclaim is scarcely discussed in Plaintiff’s motion papers, and not at all at oral argument.\nIn the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff states that “Defendants have deprived [him] of [his]\nright to expressive association guaranteed by the First Amendment” “[b]y reason of the [handbilling\nrestriction].”  Am. Compl. ¶ 78.  In his response to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment,\nPlaintiff states that the handbilling ban forces Plaintiff “to be a participant in—and thus [a] supporter\nof—the Festival.”  Resp. at 9 (emphasis deleted). \n37\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 38 of 44\nThis argument, although interesting, is unpersuasive.  Plaintiff relies solely upon Hurley v.\nIrish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995), in support of his\nargument.  There, the Supreme Court held that the government cannot force private citizens who\norganize a parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message that the organizers\ndo not wish to convey.  Id. at 559.  Thus, the Court found that compelling the parade organizer to\ninclude  the  Irish-American  Gay,  Lesbian,  and  Bisexual  Group  in  the  parade  “violates  the\nfundamental rule . . . under the First Amendment, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the\ncontent of his own message.”  Id. at 572.\nThe present case is not like Hurley.  Hurley involved a situation where the government was\nattempting to use its power to compel a private speaker, the parade organizer, to alter its message.\nHere, the government is not forcing Plaintiff to do anything; Plaintiff, by his own choice, wishes to\nimpart his religious message upon Festival-goers.  For this reason, Hurley is inapplicable.  Plaintiff’s\nfreedom of association claim is unavailing.\nVI.  ANALYSIS - FREE EXERCISE CLAIM (COUNT III)\nPlaintiff does not discuss his free exercise claim in his motion papers despite the fact that\nthe claim is discussed by Defendants.  Therefore, the claim is deemed abandoned.  See Guarino v.\nBrookfield Twp. Trustees, 980 F.2d 399, 405 (6th Cir. 1992) (if the non-moving party fails to carry\nits burden of setting forth specific facts showing genuine issues of fact for trial, “its opportunity is\nwaived and its case wagered”).  \nIn any event, the claim is not viable.  As stated in a respected treatise,\nthe free exercise clause is invoked in several situations.  One is when the\ngovernment prohibits behavior that a person’s religion requires. . . . The free\nexercise clause also is invoked when the government requires conduct that\na person’s religious prohibits. . . . Additionally, the free exercise clause is\n38\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 39 of 44\ninvoked when individuals claim that laws burden or make more difficult\nreligious observances.\nE. Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law § 12.3.1, p. 1247 (3d ed. 2006).  None of these situations\nappear to be implicated in this case; if one is, Plaintiff does not explain how.  Accordingly, summary\njudgment will be granted in favor of Defendants on Plaintiff’s free exercise claim.\nVII.  ANALYSIS - EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM (COUNT IV)\nPlaintiff’s equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment is not viable for the\nreasons stated in footnote 15, above.\nVIII.  ANALYSIS - MUNICIPAL LIABILITY\nAlthough not the subject of a separate count, Plaintiff broadly asserts municipal liability\nagainst the City.  Plaintiff contends that the City is liable under § 1983 because it enforced an\nunconstitutional speech restriction.  In addition, Plaintiff alleges throughout his Amended Complaint\nand motion papers that the handbilling ban at the 2009 Festival was selectively enforced by\nDearborn police officers.  Although the parties do not explicitly acknowledge it as such, the\nselective enforcement claim constitutes a municipal liability claim.\nThree general rules govern a municipal liability claim.  First, “a municipality cannot be held\nliable [under § 1983] solely because it employs a tortfeasor–or, in other words, a municipality cannot\nbe held liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior theory.”  Monell v. Dep’t of Social Servs. of\nCity of New York, 436 U.S. 658, 691 (1978).  In other words, \na local government may not be sued under § 1983 for an injury inflicted\nsolely by its employees or agents.  Instead, it is when execution of a\ngovernment’s policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those\nwhose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the\ninjury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.\nId. at 694.  Second, “[a] local government entity violates § 1983 where its official policy or custom\n39\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 40 of 44\nactually serves to deprive an individual of his or her constitutional rights.”  Gregory v. City of\nLouisville, 444 F.3d 725, 752 (6th Cir. 2006).  Third, “[t]he burden of proof is on the plaintiff to set\nforth the unconstitutional policy and link it with both the municipality and the injuries at issue.”\nKing v. City of Eastpointe, 86 F. App’x 790, 801 (6th Cir. 2003) (unpublished).  \nThe  Supreme  Court  has  explained  why  a  plaintiff  seeking  to  impose  liability  on  a\nmunicipality under § 1983 must identify a municipal “policy” or “custom” that caused injury:\nLocating a “policy” ensures that a municipality is held liable only for those\ndeprivations resulting from the decisions of its duly constituted legislative\nbody or of those officials whose acts may fairly be said to be those of the\nmunicipality.  Similarly, an act performed pursuant to a “custom” that has not\nbeen formally approved by an appropriate decisionmaker may fairly subject\na municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice is so\nwidespread as to have the force of law. \nBd. of County Comm’rs of Bryan County v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403-404 (1997) (citation omitted).\nPut differently,\n[t]he requirement that a municipality’s wrongful actions be a “policy” is not\nmeant  to  distinguish  isolated  incidents  from  general  rules  of  conduct\npromulgated by city officials.  It is meant to distinguish those injuries for\nwhich “the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983” from those\ninjuries for which the government should not be held accountable.  “Monell\nis a case about responsibility.”  “The ‘official policy’ requirement was\nintended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of employees of the\nmunicipality, and thereby make clear that municipal liability is limited to\naction for which the municipality is actually responsible.”\nMeyers v. City of Cincinnati, 14 F.3d 1115, 1117 (6th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted) (emphasis in\noriginal).\nBecause the Court has found that enforcement of the handbilling ban in the inner and outer\nperimeters is constitutional, Plaintiff cannot establish an unconstitutional policy or custom.  His\nmunicipal liability claim, therefore, is not viable. \n40\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 41 of 44\nWith regard to Plaintiff’s selective enforcement claim, the Third Circuit has stated that\nin order to establish municipal liability for selective enforcement of a facially\nviewpoint- and content-neutral regulation, a plaintiff whose evidence consists\nsolely of the incidents of enforcement themselves must establish a pattern of\nenforcement activity evincing a governmental policy or custom of intentional\ndiscrimination on the basis of viewpoint or content.\nBrown v. City of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d 263, 294 (3d Cir. 2009).  There is no policy of selective\nenforcement at issue in this case.  Thus, in order to sustain his selective enforcement claim, Plaintiff\nmust demonstrate a municipal custom of selective enforcement or, in the words of the Third Circuit,\n“a pattern of enforcement activity evincing a governmental . . . custom of intentional discrimination\non the basis of viewpoint or content.”  Brown, 586 F.3d at 294.  \nPlaintiff testified that he observed Dearborn police officers selectively enforcing the\nhandbilling ban at the 2009 Festival:\n27. During the 2009 Festival, the rules and regulations were selectively\nenforced.  For example, various festival booths on Warren Avenue\nblocked parts of the sidewalk (Haddad deposition exhibit 14); ART\n(Arabic Radio & Television) had a booth at the Festival and was\nallowed to pass out flyers outside of the booth, even in front of the\npolice and security guards; a “Monster” truck was allowed to pass out\nfree drinks within the border areas to Festival goers; and a Five Star\nVideo representative was permitted to distribute flyers to Festival\ngoers in the street and on the sidewalks without first purchasing a\nbooth.  True and accurate photographs of these activities are attached\nto this declaration as Exhibit F.\n28. Even though my fellow Christians and I were prohibited from\ndistributing our religious literature on the adjacent and surrounding\npublic streets and sidewalks during the Festival, certain individuals\nunrelated to us and our Christian outreach were not so prohibited.  In\nfact, some individuals were distributing literature within the Festival\nitself on Warren Avenue and the City police did not stop them.  A\ntrue and accurate photograph of an individual distributing literature\nto me on Warren Avenue during the Festival (Haddad deposition\nexhibit 17) and a true and accurate photograph of an individual\ndistributing literature to me on the public sidewalk adjacent to\n41\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 42 of 44\nWarren Avenue during the Festival (Haddad deposition exhibit 18)\nare attached to this declaration as Exhibit G.  Additional true and\naccurate photographs of individuals distributing materials on the\npublic sidewalks and on Warren Avenue during the 2009 Festival are\nattached to this declaration as Exhibit H.\nSaieg Aff. ¶¶ 27-28.\nAccepting Plaintiff’s testimony as true and assuming that the pictures show what they are\nalleged to show, and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the testimony above\nis insufficient to establish a cognizable municipal liability claim based on selective enforcement.\nPlaintiff alleges the following instances of selective enforcement of the handbilling ban during the\n2009 Festival: (1) Arabic Radio & Television was allowed to pass out flyers outside of its booth;\n(2) a “Monster” truck was allowed to pass out free drinks within the border areas to Festival-goers;\n(3) a Five Star Video representative was permitted to distribute flyers to Festival-goers in the street\nand on the sidewalks without first purchasing a booth; (4) “some individuals were distributing\nliterature within the Festival itself on Warren Avenue and the City police did not stop them.”\n \nThese four instances, even if true, do not amount to “a pattern of enforcement activity\nevincing a governmental . . . custom of intentional discrimination on the basis of viewpoint or\ncontent.”  Brown, 586 F.3d at 294.  This is because these instances, alone, are insufficient to show\nthat selective enforcement of the handbilling ban was “so widespread as to have the force of law.”\nBrown, 520 U.S. at 403-404.  \nIn addition, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that “those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said\nto represent official policy,” such as Chief Haddad, are responsible for the above-described instances\nof selective enforcement.  See Monell, 426 U.S. 694.  In other words, Plaintiff has not alleged that\n42\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 57    Filed 06/07/10   Page 43 of 44\nthe constitutional injury, selective enforcement of the handbilling ban, was inflicted by the City\nitself, through its decision-makers (i.e., Haddad), as opposed to one or more of its employees or\nagents (i.e., individual patrol officers).  See Monell, 436 U.S. at 691 (“a municipality cannot be held\nliable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior theory”).  For these reasons, Plaintiff’s selective\nenforcement claim is not viable under § 1983.\nIX.  QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\nHaddad mistakenly argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity.  This is not an action for\nmonetary relief; it is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief.  Moreover, Haddad is sued in\nhis official capacity only.  “Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense to damage liability; it does\nnot bar actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.  Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) v. United States,\n870 F.2d 518, 527 (9th Cir. 1989).  Moreover, “[q]ualified immunity shields [a] defendant from\npersonal liability, but it does not shield him from . . . claims brought against him in his official\ncapacity.”  Hall v. Tollett, 128 F.3d 418, 430 (6th Cir. 1997).  Accordingly, Haddad is not entitled\nto qualified immunity.\nX.  ORDER\n   For the reasons stated, Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.  Plaintiff’s\nMotion for Summary Judgment and Request for Injunctive Relief is denied.  All other outstanding\nmotions are denied as moot.  This case is dismissed.\nSO ORDERED.\ns/Paul D.

(p. 22), delivered a separate dissenting opinion.\n_________________\nOPINION\n_________________\nKAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge.  Each summer, Plaintiff George\nSaieg attends the Arab International Festival (“Festival”) in the City of Dearborn,\nMichigan (“City”).  At the Festival, Saieg leads a group of Christians whose goal is to\nconvert Muslims to Christianity.  In 2009, Dearborn police instituted a leafleting\n1\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 2\nrestriction for the Festival.  Pursuant to the restriction, no one may leaflet from the\nsidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival attractions, or on the sidewalks and\nroads that surround the Festival’s core on each side by one to five city blocks.  The\nrestriction permits leafleting at the Festival only from a stationary booth and not while\nwalking around the Festival.\nSaieg sued the City of Dearborn and its Chief of Police, alleging that the\nleafleting restriction violated his First Amendment right to free speech, as well as his\nfreedom to associate, his free exercise of religion, and his right to equal protection.  The\ndistrict court denied a temporary restraining order before the 2009 Festival and granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants in 2010.  This court granted Saieg an injunction\npending appeal for the 2010 Festival, permitting Saieg to distribute leaflets from the\nouter sidewalks and roads, but not on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the\nFestival attractions.\nOn the free speech claim, we REVERSEthe district court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.  We\nthereby invalidate the leafleting restriction within both the inner and outer perimeters of\n1\nthe Festival.   The restriction on the sidewalks that are directly adjacent to the Festival\nattractions does not serve a substantial government interest.  The City keeps those same\nsidewalks open for public traffic and permits sidewalk vendors, whose activity is more\nobstructive to sidewalk traffic flow than pedestrian leafleting is.  Moreover, the\nprohibition of pedestrianleafleting in the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to the\ngoal of isolating inner areas from vehiculartraffic.  The City can be held liable because\nthe Chief of Police, who instituted the leafleting restriction, created official municipal\npolicy.  We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment for the defendants on all other\nclaims. We REMANDto the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent\nwith this opinion that may be warranted.\n1\nSaieg has not requested the ability to leaflet on the street that contains Festival attractions.  As\na result, we do not pass judgment on whether a ban on leafleting on that street itself is constitutionally\npermissible.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 3\nI.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Substantive Facts\n1.  The Arab International Festival\nThe American Arab Chamber of Commerce (“AACC”) organizes the Festival,\nwhich is free and open to the public.  Each year, over 250,000 people attend the Festival,\nwhich features carnival rides, a main stage with live entertainment, international food,\nmerchandise sales, a tent targeted at children, and tents in which artisans and other\nvendors display products.  In 2009, forty artisan vendors, twenty-five information tables,\nfourteen food vendors, and seventeen sponsor booths took part in the Festival.  These\nattractions are all located within the “inner perimeter” of the Festival:  the eight blocks\nof Warren Avenue between Hartwell Street to the west and Kingsley Street to the east,\nas well as one block south on Miller Road, which intersects Warren Avenue.  Due to the\nscale of the event, officers from the Dearborn Police Department supply extensive\nsecurity and support the Festival from a “[c]ommand post trailer.”  R. 47-11 (Ex. K:\nHaddad dep. at 52).  The resolution authorizing the Festival “subject[s]” the Festival to\n“the rules and regulations of the Police Department.”  R. 47-13 (Ex. M:  Council\nResolution)\nBusinesses located along the inner perimeter on Warren Avenue can obtain\npermits to display and sell their goods on the sidewalks outside their storefronts.\nAlthough the City itself issued the sidewalk permits prior to 2009, the City now\ndelegates authority to issue the permits to the AACC.  Businesses and organizations not\nlocated on Warren Avenue can purchase an information table.  In fact, if businesses or\norganizations wish to distribute materials, the City’s police department requiresthat the\ndistribution occur from a “fixed location,” which in practice means an information table\nlocated in the street, not on the sidewalk.  R. 47-8 (Ex. H:  Mrowka dep. at 32).\n“[H]andbilling along the sidewalks that are adjacent to the [F]estival” is not permitted.\nR. 47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun dep. 35).  Police officers are expected to warn anyone who\ndistributes leaflets and, if the person continues, to arrest the offender.  Dearborn Chief\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 4\nof Police Ronald Haddad, who assumed his position shortly before the 2009 Festival and\nhas prior experience with crowd control in other capacities, testified that a similar policy\nis in place at the Michigan State Fair. The Michigan State Fair “will not allow you to\ngive out a paper clip unless you’re stationary and at a booth.  It just makes good sense,\nit’s a good practice[,] and it’s not a standard that is applied indiscriminately[;] it’s across\nthe board.”  R. 47-11 (Ex. K:  Haddad Dep. at 95).  Fay Beydoun, Executive Director of\nthe AACC, testified that the leafleting policy exists “to make sure that the sidewalks\n[a]re available, whether it’s for the people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re\ntrying to get from one location to another to go to the businesses” along Warren Avenue.\nR. 47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun Dep. at 37); see also R. 47-11 (Ex. K:  Haddad Dep. at 18)\n(“[K]nowing that it [i]s going to be a very crowded situation, we . . . do our very best to\nkeep the sidewalks flowing.”).\nTo accommodate Festival traffic, the City barricades the roads within an “outer\nperimeter” or “buffer zone” that surrounds the inner perimeter.  Although the outer\nperimeter does not contain attractions, it services the Festival by “restrict[ing] traffic,”\nR. 47-8 (Ex. H:  Mrowka Dep. at 15), and “giv[ing] [vehicular] traffic some final point\nto turn away from the Warren Avenue destination,” R. 47-11 (Ex. K:  Haddad Dep. at\n26–27).  The outer perimeter also enhances “crowd control [leading] into the [F]estival\narea.”  R. 47-8 (Ex. H:  Mrowka Dep. at 15).  Finally, the outer perimeter includes\nparking for Festival attendees and vendors, as well as for displaced employees of Warren\nAvenue businesses and any of those businesses’ patrons who are not attending the\nFestival.   R. 47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun Dep. at 43–44).  The outer perimeter stretches one\nblock north of Warren Avenue (Morrow Circle), one block south of Warren Avenue\n(Blesser Avenue), five blocks west of Hartwell Street (Schaefer Road), and four blocks\neast of Kingsley Street (Wyoming Avenue).\nThe restriction on leafleting applies in the outer perimeter area as well.  Beydoun\nexplained why:  “if you allowed someone to distribute literature within [the] outer area,\nyou might as well allow the other street vendors to set up tables and start selling things\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 5\nin that area, too.  That is the buffer between going in and going out.  You [have] to\nmaintain a security area.”  R. 47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun Dep. at 58).\n2.  Saieg and the Arabic Christian Perspective\nSaieg  founded  the  Arabic  Christian  Perspective  (“ACP”),  a  now-defunct\n“national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy Gospel of Jesus\nChrist to Muslims.  As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travel[ed] around the country\nattending  and  distributing  Christian  literature  at  festivals  and  mosques.”    R.  13\n(Amended Compl. ¶ 9).  Because the City is home to a “big Muslim community,” the\nFestival provides Saieg the opportunity to evangelize “thousands of Muslims in one\nplace.”  R. 48 (Ex. A:  Saieg Dep. at 42, 44).  Before each Festival, the ACP operated\nan annual event called “Facing the Muslim Challenge.”  In 2009, the program featured\npanel discussions, workshops on “[e]ffectively witnessing to Muslims,” debates, door-to-\ndoor outreach, and mosque tours.  R. 47–2 (Ex. B:  Program).  The program culminated\nin outreach at the Festival.  At each Festival from 2004 to 2008, Saieg and 90 to 120\nACP members distributed leaflets from the public sidewalks that abut Warren Avenue.\nIn 2009, Saieg had planned for 90 ACP members to continue the practice of\nleafleting while roaming the Festival.  However, when Saieg shared these plans with a\nCity police sergeant, Saieg learned that the new Chief of Police, Chief Haddad, would\nnot permit anyone to distribute leaflets while walking around the Festival.  Instead, the\nCity provided the ACP with a booth, waiving the standard fee.  The booth was poorly\nlit and located by carnival rides, which attracted mostly children.  This problem was\nremedied in 2010, when the ACP’s booth was lit and located “in the central area.”  Saieg\nv. City of Dearborn, 720 F. Supp. 2d 817, 834–35 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (describing then-\nupcoming plans for the 2010 festival).  Saieg also faces a more basic problem with\nbooth-based evangelism:  “[t]he penalty of leaving Islam according to Islamic books is\ndeath,” which makes Muslims reluctant to approach a booth that is publicly “labeled as\n. . . Christian.”  R. 48 (Ex. A:  Saieg Dep. at 75).  Saieg believes that evangelism is more\neffective when he can roam the Festival and speak to Muslims more discreetly.  The\nACP distributed 37,000 packets of religious materials in 2007 and 20,000 packets in\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 6\n2008, but only 500 packets in 2009 due to the remote, fixed location.  Numbers from\n2010 are not in the record.\nB.  Procedural History\nOn June 16, 2009, Saieg and ACP sued the City and Chief Haddad for violating\ntheir First Amendment rights to free speech, free association, and free exercise of\nreligion, in addition to violating the Equal Protection Clause.  Saieg has specified that\n“this is not a facial challenge” to the leafleting restriction but “an as-applied challenge.”\nAppellant Br. at 38.  Moreover, Saieg has “at no time . . . requested to engage in his\nreligious activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road,” although he has asked to leaflet\non the sidewalks that are adjacent to those roads.  Id. at 2.  The plaintiffs sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and nominal damages.  Two\ndays after the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the district court denied a temporary\nrestraining order.  At the 2009 Festival, the plaintiffs distributed leaflets from the\ninconveniently located booth.\nThe ACP was dismissed from the case after the organization dissolved.  On\nJune 7, 2010, the district court denied Saieg’s motion for summary judgment and granted\nsummary judgment to the defendants.  The district court held that the leafleting\nrestriction was a valid time, place, and manner restriction, relying heavily on Heffron v.\nInternational Society for Krishna Consciousness, 452 U.S. 640 (1981), and the Sixth\nCircuit’s application of Heffron in Spingola v. Village of Granville, 39 F. App’x 978 (6th\nCir. 2002) (unpublished opinion).  The district court reasoned that Saieg retains\nalternative channels of communication, even though they are not his preferred channels,\nbecause he could “orally propagat[e] [his] religious views,” distribute materials from a\nbooth, and distribute materials outside of the Festival.  Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 834–35.\nThe leafleting restriction is content neutral, said the district court, because permitting\nWarren Avenue businesses to have sidewalk sales “favor[s], if anyone, those with space\nalong Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their message” is.  Id. at 837.  The\nleafleting restriction serves a substantial government interest “in ensuring the orderly\nflow of pedestrian traffic through the crowded Festival.”  Id. at 838.  Finally, the district\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 7\ncourt found that the restriction is narrowly tailored because allowing everyone to\ndistribute leaflets in the outer perimeter area would “effectively extend the Festival\ngrounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer zone between the Festival and the\noutside world.” Id. at 840.  Even though streets and sidewalks are traditionally public\nfora, “[f]or three days out of the year, the streets and sidewalks of the outer perimeter . . .\nare serving an entirely different role.”  Id.  The district court found that Saieg had\nabandoned his free exercise claim, and also disposed of the freedom of association and\nequal protection claims.  Finally, the district court found that the City was not liable\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because there was no constitutional violation.  The four\ninstances of selective enforcement that Saieg highlighted were “insufficient to show that\nselective enforcement . . . was so widespread as to have the force of law,” and Saieg had\nnot shown that the selective enforcement stemmed from official policy.  Id. at 844\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\nSaieg appealed to the Sixth Circuit and filed an emergency motion for expedited\nreview.  On June 17, 2010, this court ruled that Saieg was likely to succeed on the merits\nof his claim because, although Heffron and Spignola “may support the restriction of\nleaflet distribution among the crowds within the core area of the Festival, they do not\nappear to preclude similar activity in the ‘outer perimeter’ or ‘buffer zone’ leading up\nto the core area.”  Sixth Circuit 06/17/10 Order at 3.  The panel therefore granted Saieg’s\nmotion for an injunction pending appeal, permitting Saieg “to distribute his religious\nliterature in the streets contained within . . . the ‘outer perimeter’ or ‘buffer zone,’” but\nnot “within the Festival itself.”  Id.  That order expired after the 2010 Festival.  Id.  The\n16th annual Festival will be held June 17–19, 2011.

Standard of Review\nWhen a district court denies a permanent injunction, we review the court’s legal\nconclusions de novo, its factual findings for clear error, and the scope of the injunction\nfor abuse of discretion. Worldwide Basketball & Sport Tours, Inc. v. NCAA, 388 F.3d\n955, 958 (6th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 813 (2005).  “A party is entitled to a\npermanent injunction if it can establish that it suffered a constitutional violation and will\nsuffer continuing irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at law.” \nWedgewood Ltd. P’ship I v. Twp. of Liberty, 610 F.3d 340, 349 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1007 (2011).\nThe  district  court  granted  the  defendants  summary  judgment  on  the  first\npoint—whether Saieg suffered a constitutional violation.  That is a legal question, so the\nstandard of review coincides with the de novo standard that we apply to summary\njudgments generally.  Id.  “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows\nthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “We review cross motions for\nsummary judgment under this standard as well, evaluating each motion on its own\nmerits.”  La Quinta Corp. v. Heartland Props. LLC, 603 F.3d 327, 335 (6th Cir. 2010).\nB.  Free Speech\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s guidance in Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense\n& Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 797 (1985), we analyze free speech claims in\nthree steps.  Parks v. City of Columbus, 395 F.3d 643, 647 (6th Cir. 2005).  The first step\nis to determine whether the plaintiff’s conduct is protected speech.  Id.  Saieg’s conduct\nis clearly protected.  “‘[T]he hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of\nmissionary evangelism,’ Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 108 (1943), and such\nactivity ‘has the same claim as [oral and written dissemination] to the guarantee[] of\nfreedom of speech . . . ,’ id. at 109.” Parks, 395 F.3d at 647.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 9\nThe second step is to “‘identify the nature of the forum, because the extent to\nwhich the Government may limit access depends on whether the forum is public or\nnonpublic.’” Id. (quoting Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 797).  Public streets and sidewalks “are\n‘quintessential’ public forums for free speech,” Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 715\n(2000); see alsoFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 480–81 (1988), although “there have\nbeen limited circumstances where public streets or sidewalks are not considered public\nfora,” Parks, 395 F.3d at 648 (mentioning sidewalks by post offices and sidewalks in\nmilitary reservations).  Restrictions on speech in traditional public fora must either be\n(1) reasonable time, place, and manner regulations or (2) “narrowly drawn to accomplish\na compelling governmental interest.”  United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983).\nIn general, then, “the government’s ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct”\non public streets and sidewalks “is very limited.”  Id.\nThe parties disagree about whether the streets and sidewalks within the inner and\n2\nouter perimeters were functioning as traditional public fora or limited public fora  during\nthe Festival. Compare Parks, 395 F.3d at 652 (holding that “the streets remained a\ntraditional public forum notwithstanding the special[, non-exclusive] permit” that\nallowed a private group to operate a public Arts Festival on public streets), with\nSpingola, 39 F. App’x at 983 (holding that the “public streets” were “not serving in\nth[eir traditional] function during the festival”); see also Heffron, 452 U.S. at 651\n(explaining that the Minnesota Fair, which is “a temporary event attracting great\nnumbers of visitors,” presents problems of traffic flow and crowd control that make “any\ncomparisons to public streets . . . necessarily inexact”).  This disagreement, however, is\nnot germane to the free speech issue in this case.  If a rule is “content-neutral, [then] the\nappropriate test is intermediate scrutiny,” even when the rule governs speech in a\ntraditional public forum.  Phelps-Roper v. Strickland, 539 F.3d 356, 361–62 (6th Cir.\n2008); see also Spingola, 39 F. App’x at 983 (“[R]egardless of whether we would\nclassify the . . . festival area as a traditional public forum or a limited public forum . . . ,\n2\n“The government may restrict speech in a limited public forum as long as the restrictions do ‘not\ndiscriminate against speech on the basis of viewpoint’ and are ‘reasonable in light of the purpose served\nby the forum.’”  Miller v. City of Cincinnati, 622 F.3d 524, 535 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Good News Club\nv. Milford Central Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 106–07 (2001)).\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 10\nthe Ordinance is examined under the same intermediate level of scrutiny.”).  As\nexplained below, the leafleting restriction is content neutral.\nTherefore, it is the third step that decides this case:  “whether the justifications\nfor exclusion from the relevant forum satisfy the requisite standard.”  Cornelius, 473\nU.S. at 797.  The requisite principle applicable to this case is that “[t]ime, place, and\nmanner restrictions may be enforced even in a traditional public forum so long as they\nare content neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and\nleave open ample alternative channels of communication.”  M.A.L. ex rel. M.L. v.\nKinsland, 543 F.3d 841, 850 (6th Cir. 2008).  The leafleting restriction does not satisfy\nthis standard.\n1.  Content Neutrality\nThe leafleting restriction is content neutral.  Whether a restriction on speech is\ncontent neutral has substantial bearing on the constitutionality of the restriction because\n“the government is held to a very exacting and rarely satisfied standard when it disfavors\nthe discussion of particular subjects or particular viewpoints within a given subject\nmatter.”  Hill, 530 U.S. at 735 (Souter, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted).\nGovernment regulations of speech are content neutral if they are “justified without\nreference to the content or viewpoint of the regulated speech.”  Christian Legal Soc’y\nChapter of the Univ. of Cal., Hastings Coll. of the Law v. Martinez, --- U.S. ---, 130\nS. Ct. 2971, 2994 (2010) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted); see also\nHill, 530 U.S. at 719 (“‘The principal inquiry . . . is whether the government has adopted\na regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.’” (quoting\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989))).  “The government’s purpose\nis the controlling consideration.”  Ward, 491 U.S. at 791.  “[D]ifferential impact”\nwithout more does not demonstrate that a regulation is content based.  Christian Legal\nSoc’y, 130 S. Ct. at 2994.\nRequiring that all literature be distributed from a stationary location is a content-\nneutral regulation.  Designating “specific areas for specific things” at the Festival, R. 47-\n3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun dep. at 33), “is not a ‘regulation of speech.’  Rather, it is a regulation\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 11\nof the places where some speech may occur.”  Hill, 530 U.S. at 719.  Supporting this\nconclusion is the fact that “the State’s interests” in crowd control and public safety “are\nunrelated to the content of [the regulated] speech.”  Id. at 719–20.  In addition, Saieg has\nnot produced evidence that the regulation was “adopted ‘because of disagreement with\nthe message [that his speech] conveys.’”  Id. at 719 (quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 791).\nSaieg argues that the leafleting restriction is content based because it privileges\ncommercial speech over noncommercial speech.  He points to the City’s practice of\nletting Warren Avenue storefronts erect sidewalk tables, whereas he cannot distribute\nmaterials from the same sidewalk.  This argument misapprehends the criterion for who\ncan vend from the sidewalk.  The criterion is location, not content or type (commercial\nor noncommercial) of speech.  Any entity with a storefront on Warren Avenue can set\nup sidewalk table, and no one without a storefront can become a sidewalk vendor.  R.\n47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun Dep. at 64–65).  The defendants do not inquire into whether the\nsidewalk vendor is commercial or noncommercial, and the defendants do not screen the\nmessages that sidewalk tables convey for content.\nThe AACC’s proposal for the 2009 Festival confirms that location of the\nspeakers, not the content of their speech, is the criterion for permitting sidewalk sales.\nThe AACC describes “sidewalk sales . . . by merchants on Warren Ave[nue]” as a\ncomponent of the Festival, alongside the “main stage, children’s tent, vendor tents,\nartisan’s tents,” “carnival,” and “[f]ood and entertainment.”  R. 47-5 (Ex. E:  Request\nfrom AACC at 1).  Moreover, the 2009 proposal names “promot[ing] the Warren\nAvenue Business District” as one of two objectives for the Festival.  R. 47-5 (Ex. E: \nRequest from AACC at 3).  As a way of promoting the Warren Avenue Business\nDistrict, the sidewalk tables offer a “quid pro quo for stores negatively impacted by the\nFestival.  In exchange for subjecting them to Festival crowds in front of their stores and\nclosed-off  streets  that  block  regular  customers’  ingress  and  egress,  the  existing\nmerchants are permitted to set up tables out front to sell their wares.”  720 F. Supp. 2d\nat 837.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 12\nIn sum, the leafleting restriction does not use location as a guise for the content\nof speech.  Neither the leafleting restriction nor the interest that the defendants seek to\npromote are related to the content of the restricted speech.  The restriction, then, is\ncontent neutral.\n2.  Substantial Governmental Interest\nThe leafleting restriction does not further a substantial governmental interest. \nTime, place, and manner regulations must “‘promote[] a substantial government interest\nthat would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.’”  Ward, 491 U.S. at 799\n(quotingUnited States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 689 (1985)).  “‘The validity of time,\nplace, or manner regulations does not turn on a judge’s agreement with the responsible\ndecisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant\ngovernment interests’ or the degree to which those interests should be promoted.”  Id.\nat 800 (quoting Albertini, 472 U.S. at 689) (internal alteration marks removed).\nThe defendants have named several interests that they find significant:  relieving\n“pedestrian overcrowding,” enhancing “traffic flow,” minimizing “threats to public\nsafety,” and limiting “disorderliness at the Festival.”  Appellee Br. at 37.  In appropriate\ncontexts, each of these governmental interests can be substantial.  In fact, the interests\nthat the defendants have identified closely parallel the interests that the Supreme Court\nvalidated in Heffron.  In Heffron, Minnesota imposed leafleting restrictions at the state\nfair because the state was concerned with “maintain[ing] the orderly movement of the\ncrowd given the large number of exhibitors and persons attending the Fair.”  452 U.S.\nat 649–50.  The Supreme Court held that “the State’s interest in confining distribution,\nselling, and fund solicitation activities to fixed locations is sufficient to satisfy the\nrequirement that a place or manner restriction must serve a substantial state interest.”\nId. at 654; see also Madsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 768 (1994)\n(recognizing the state’s “strong interest in ensuring the public safety and order” and “in\npromoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks”).\nThe defendants must do more, however, than “assert[] interests [that] are\nimportant in the abstract.”  Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 664 (1994).\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 13\nIn the context of the Festival’s inner perimeter, the interests that the defendants have\nnamed are merely “conjectural,” as opposed to “real.”  Id.  Two activities that Festival\norganizers permit on sidewalks abutting Warren Avenue erode the significance of the\ngovernment’s interest in restricting leafleting on those same sidewalks.  These activities\nare legally relevant because “[e]xemptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of\na medium of speech . . . may diminish the credibility of the . . . rationale for restricting\nspeech in the first place.” City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 52 (1994).\nFirst, Festival organizers keep sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue\nopen for public traffic.  In Heffron, attendees paid an admission fee to enter the\nfairgrounds, 452 U.S. at 658 (Brennan, J., dissenting), which means that the fairgrounds\nwere closed to members of the public who were not attending the fair.  In fact, the\nSupreme Court expressly distinguished the fairgrounds in Heffron from a public street.\n452 U.S. at 651.  In contrast, Festival organizers have intentionally maintained the public\ncharacter of the sidewalks that are adjacent to the Festival attractions, keeping those\nsidewalks open for traffic that is unrelated to the Festival.  R. 47-3 (Ex. C:  Beydoun\nDep. at 37) (“We wanted to make sure that the sidewalks [a]re available, whether it’s for\nthe people attending the [F]estival or people [who a]re trying to get from one location\nto another to go to the businesses.”).  The sidewalks may well host more traffic during\nthe Festival than they do on other days of the year.  Nevertheless, the defendants have\nchosen to keep the sidewalks open for public use, showing that the interests in crowd\ncontrol and public safety are not so pressing that they justify restricting normal activity\nthat occurs on streets and sidewalks.  Therefore, because Festival organizers permit\npublic traffic on the sidewalks next to Warren Avenue, the interest in curtailing First\n3\nAmendment expression on those sidewalks is not substantial.\nSecond and more importantly, Festival organizers permit sidewalk vendors on\nthe sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue, belying the significance of their\ninterest in clear sidewalks and crowd control.  The sidewalk vendors have no analog in\n3\nThe district court rejected this argument because Spingola applied Heffron to a two-block fair\non public streets.  However, Spingola was an unpublished opinion that did not analyze the issue.  To the\nextent that Spingola’s holding runs counter to our analysis, we do not find Spingola persuasive.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 14\nthe facts of Heffron, where the fair “confin[ed] individual exhibitors to fixed locations,\nwith the public moving to and among the booths or other attractions, using streets and\nopen spaces provided for that purpose.”  452 U.S. at 650.  Leafleting is less obtrusive\nthan sidewalk tables are because “‘[t]he distribution of literature does not require that\nthe recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to convey; instead\nthe recipient is free to read the message at a later time.’”  Int’l Soc’y for Krishna\nConsciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 690 (1992) (O’Connor, J., concurring)\n(quotingUnited States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 734 (1990)).  The defendants admitted\nat oral argument that leafleters have never posed any problems of public safety or breach\nof the peace at the Festival that could make leafleters more obtrusive than sidewalk\nvendors. By permitting the more obstructive sidewalk tables in the same place where\nSaieg wishes to leaflet by foot, the defendants have undercut the credibility of the\n4\nasserted government interests.\nThe defendants respond that an interest can be substantial even if the state does\nnot promote it in every conceivable way.  A restriction on speech can satisfy the time,\nplace, and manner test if the restriction “promotes a substantial government interest that\nwould be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.”  Ward, 491 U.S. at 799\n(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  This statement of the law is drawn\nfrom the requirement of narrow tailoring.  Immediately after the quoted language, Ward\nclarifies that, “[t]o be sure, this standard [for narrow tailoring] does not mean that a time,\nplace, or manner regulation may burden substantially morespeech than is necessary to\nfurther the government’s legitimate interests.”  Id.(emphasis added).  By analogy, even\nwhen  a  regulation  promotes  a  government  interest  that  would  be  achieved  less\neffectively absent the regulation, the government’s interest may still be insubstantial if\nthe  regulation  burdens  substantially  less  speech  than  is  necessary  to  further  the\n4\nThe district court’s response to Saieg’s argument is not persuasive.  According to the district\ncourt, the Sixth Circuit rejected an argument similar to Saieg’s in Spingola.  In Spingola, the plaintiff\n“argue[d] that the regulation does not relieve the crowding and pedestrian flow obstructions that take place\nduring the festival regardless.”  39 F. App’x at 984.  Saieg’s argument goes further than saying that the\nregulation is not a panacea for crowd control.  Saieg claims that the defendants permit one activity that\nseriously harms the government’s supposed interest at the same time that they ban another activity that\nonly mildly harms that same supposed interest.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 15\ngovernment’s interest. See City of Ladue, 512 U.S. at 51 (“[T]he notion that a regulation\nof speech may be impermissibly underinclusive is firmly grounded in basic First\nAmendment principles.”); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 489 (1995)\n(holding  that  a  policy  violates  the  First  Amendment  because  “exemptions  and\ninconsistencies bring into question the purpose” of the policy, even though “the\nGovernment’s interest . . . remains a valid goal”); Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524,\n540 (1989) (holding that “the facial underinclusiveness” of the state’s restriction on\nspeech “raises serious doubts about whether Florida is, in fact, serving . . . the significant\ninterests [that it has] invoke[d] in support” of the policy).  In this case, the nature and\nscale of the activities that the defendants permit on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren\nAvenue show that the government’s asserted interests are not substantial in the context\nof those sidewalks.\nWith regard to the outer perimeter, the roads and sidewalks are open for\npedestrians in the same way as the sidewalks that are adjacent to Warren Avenue.\nConcerns about crowd control seem to be exclusively conjectural.  However, Saieg\nfocuses his argument about the outer perimeter on the question of narrow tailoring.  We\nfollow his lead and address the outer perimeter below.\n3.  Narrow Tailoring\nThe leafleting restriction within the outer perimeter is not narrowly tailored to\nfurther the government’s objectives.  To be narrowly tailored, a regulation must not\n“burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s\nlegitimate interests.”  Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.  Put differently, the regulation must not be\n“substantially broader than necessary.”  Id. at 800.  “[W]hen a content-neutral regulation\ndoes not entirely foreclose any means of communication, it may satisfy the tailoring\nrequirement even though it is not the least restrictive or least intrusive means of serving\nthe [state’s] goal.”  Hill, 530 U.S. at 726.\nThe parties disagree about whether the sidewalks adjacent to the Festival and the\nstreets  and sidewalks within the outer perimeter area are “part of” the Festival.\nConsequently, the parties also disagree about whether Saieg seeks to participate in the\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 16\nFestival or to leaflet nearthe Festival, a distinction that informs their arguments about\nnarrow tailoring.  This debate is a red herring.  The narrow-tailoring requirement focuses\non the nexus between the regulation and the government’s interest.  Grace, 461 U.S. at\n181.  The government’s interests need not be coterminous with “the Festival” as a\nmonolithic area, and the government may have different interests in different areas of the\nFestival or near the Festival.  As a result, whether these locations are classified as part\nof “the Festival” does not determine whether the leafleting restriction is narrowly\ntailored to accomplish the government’s interests.\nSaieg has not requested to leaflet on Warren Avenue.  Moreover, Saieg has not\ndisputed that the restriction on leafleting within the inner perimeter—the sidewalks\nadjacent to Warren Avenue—is narrowly tailored.  Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 839\n(“Plaintiff does not mount a ‘narrow tailoring’ challenge with respect to the enforcement\nof the handbilling ban in the inner perimeter.”).  As explained above, we agree with\nSaieg that the inner-perimeter restriction on leafleting does not further a substantial\ngovernment interest, making the question of narrow tailoring irrelevant.\nThe restriction on leafleting within the outer perimeter is substantially broader\nthan necessary to further the government’s interests, assuming that those interests are\nsubstantial.  In reaching the opposite conclusion, the district court and the defendants\ncorrectly analyze the issue from the perspective of permitting everyone to leaflet, not\nonly Saieg. See Heffron, 452 U.S. at 653 (“Obviously, there would be a much larger\nthreat to the State’s interest in crowd control if all other religious, nonreligious, and\nnoncommercial  organizations  could  likewise  move  freely  about  the  fairgrounds\ndistributing and selling literature and soliciting funds at will.”).  The district court,\nhowever, used that perspective to magnify an unsubstantiated fear.  “[M]ere speculation\nabout danger” is not an adequate basis on which to justify a restriction of speech.  Bay\nArea Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224, 1228 (9th Cir. 1990); see also Turner\nBroad. Sys., Inc., 512 U.S. at 664 (requiring that the government “demonstrate that the\nrecited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact\nalleviate these harms in a direct and material way”).  Although the government has an\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 17\ninterest in crowd control, the defendants “must do more than simply posit the existence\nof the disease sought to be cured.”  Turner Broad. Sys., Inc., 512 U.S. at 664 (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see alsoKlein v. City of San Clemente, 584 F.3d 1196, 1202\n(9th Cir. 2009) (“[M]erely invoking interests is insufficient.  The government must also\nshow that the proposed communicative activity endangers those interests.” (internal\nalteration marks and quotation marks omitted)), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1706 (2010). \nThe district court neglected these principles by concluding that throngs of people “would\nall flock to the outer perimeter to promote their respective interests and messages,”\nthereby “extend[ing] the Festival grounds into an area that is meant to serve as a buffer\nzone between the Festival and the outside world.” Saieg, 720 F. Supp. 2d at 840.  The\nweakness in the district court’s argument is that the primary justification for the outer\nperimeter is to curb vehicular traffic and provide parking, not to cabin pedestrian crowds.\nDespite the district court’s speculation, the record does not mention any existing problem\nof pedestrian traffic in the outer perimeter area.  Saieg leaflets by foot.  While his\nleafleting might attract pedestrian listeners who would congregate on the sidewalks, it\nis hard to imagine that leafleters, who would be competing with more interesting\nattractions on Warren Avenue, could draw crowds so large that the Festival would\nballoon outward.  Attracting merely a few listeners on a sidewalk would not implicate\na substantial governmental interest in crowd control.\nBeydoun’s testimony mirrors the hyperbole of the district court:  “if you allowed\nsomeone to distribute literature within [the] outer area, you might as well allow the other\nstreet vendors to set up tables and start selling things in that area, too.  That is the buffer\nbetween going in and going out.  You [have] got to maintain a security area.”  R. 47-3\n(Ex. C:  Beydoun Dep. at 58).  Beydoun’s worry is exaggerated.  Although “[t]he\njustification for the [challenged rule] should not be measured by the disorder that would\nresult from granting an exemption solely to” the challenging party, Heffron, 452 U.S. at\n652, permitting everyone to leaflet in the outer perimeter area does not require the city\nto permit street vending or other attractions in the area defined by the outer perimeter.\nInstead, by invalidating the leafleting restriction, we hold only that the defendants must\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 18\npermit speech—including, but not limited to, archetypical First Amendment activity such\nas distributing leaflets, books, or DVDs.\nThe restriction on pedestrian leafleting is substantially broader than necessary\nto further the interest in vehicular traffic control and parking.  In other words, the\nrestriction is not narrowly tailored because there is “an insufficient nexus” between the\ngovernment’s asserted interest and the leafleting restriction.  Grace, 461 U.S. at 181.\n4.  Ample Alternative Channels of Communication\nWe do not decide whether the restriction on leafleting leaves Saieg with ample\nalternative methods of communicating to his target audience.  Any time, place, and\nmanner restriction must leave open ample alternative channels by which speakers can\ncommunicate their messages, although speakers are “not entitled to [their] best means\nof communication.”  Phelps-Roper, 539 F.3d at 372.  “An alternative is not ample if the\nspeaker is not permitted to reach the intended audience.”  Bay Area Peace Navy, 914\nF.2d at 1229 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The requirements for a time, place, and\nmanner restriction are conjunctive.  See, e.g., Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y of New\nYork, Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150, 168–69 (2002) (invalidating an ordinance\nthat  served  a  substantial  government  interest  because  it  was  not  narrowly\ntailored—without discussing whether ample alternative channels of communication\nexisted).  Thus, the leafleting restriction is unconstitutional even if it leaves open ample\nalternative channels of communication.\n5.  Summary\nEven though the leafleting restriction is content neutral and might provide ample\nalternative means of communication, the policy is not a reasonable time, place, and\nmanner  restriction.    Within  the  inner  perimeter,  the  restriction  does  not  serve  a\nsubstantial governmental interest, as evidenced by the defendants’ willingness to permit\nsidewalk vendors and ordinary pedestrian traffic on the same sidewalks where they\nprohibited Saieg from leafleting.  Within the outer perimeter area, the restriction is not\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 19\nnarrowly tailored because the government’s interest in vehicular traffic control is\n5\nattenuated from concern about pedestrian crowds that pedestrian leafleting might draw.\nSaieg has requested, in the event that this court rules in his favor, “that the\ndecision be crafted to prevent Defendants from circumventing it by playing a game of\nshifting ‘perimeters.’”  Reply Br. at 1 n.1.  Our holding is not predicated on the\nboundaries of the Festival or a distinction between the inner and outer perimeters.  Saieg\nand other members of the public may leaflet from any street or sidewalk that remains\nopen for typical, non-Festival pedestrian traffic, even if the street or sidewalk is\nsimultaneously used for Festival traffic.  We note that, should the City’s conjectural\nharms come to pass, the City can move to modify the injunction.  Deja Vu of Nashville,\nInc. v. Metro. Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson Cnty., 466 F.3d 391, 395 (6th Cir. 2006),\ncert. denied, 549 U.S. 1339 (2007).\nIn addition to declarative and injunctive relief, Saieg is entitled to nominal\ndamages for the violation of his constitutional rights.  See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247,\n266 (1978).\nC.  Freedom of Association\nSaieg’s freedom-of-association claim lacks merit.  The freedom to associate\nprotects “choices to enter into and maintain certain intimate human relationships” as well\nas “associat[ion] for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First\nAmendment.”  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617–18 (1984).  Unless\nthey promote compelling state interests, government actions violate the freedom of\nassociation when, for example, they “seek to impose penalties or withhold benefits from\nindividuals because of their membership in a disfavored group; . . . attempt to require\ndisclosure of the fact of membership in a group seeking anonymity; . . . [or] try to\ninterfere with the internal organization or affairs of the group.”  Id.at 622–23 (internal\n5\nAlthough Saieg has sought to leaflet on the sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue and Miller\nRoad, he has repeatedly declined to request permission to leaflet on those streets themselves.  Appellant\nBr. at 2.  Because Saieg has not raised the issue, we have no occasion to decide whether Saieg may leaflet\non those streets.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 20\ncitations  omitted).    Even  though  Saieg  has  been  deprived  of  one  outlet  for  his\nassociation’s expression, his freedom to associate has not been abridged in any way\ncomparable to these examples.  Saieg is free to associate even at the Festival.  Only\nleafleting, not association, has been restricted.\nD.  Free Exercise of Religion\nSaieg abandoned his free exercise claim before the district court.  720 F. Supp.\n2d at 841.  He has not contested the waiver on appeal.  Therefore, his free exercise claim\nis not one that we must consider.  Doe v. Bredesen, 507 F.3d 998, 1007 (6th Cir. 2007),\ncert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 287 (2008).\nE.  Equal Protection\nThe leafleting restriction does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  Saieg\nargues that the leafleting restriction distinguishes by content between religious leaflets\nand commercial sidewalk tables.  He relies on Police Department of City of Chicago v.\nMosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972), which held that “[s]elective exclusions from a public\nforum may not be based on content alone, and may not be justified by reference to\ncontent alone.”  Unlike the restriction in Mosley, however, the restriction in this case\ndoes not “describe[] permissible [speech] in terms of its subject matter.”  Id. at 95.\nInstead, sidewalk tables are permissible according to the location of the organization that\noperates them, not the subject matter of the message that the organization conveys.  See\nsupra Section II.B.1.  Therefore, the restriction does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause.\nF.  City’s Liability\nThe City may be held liable for the restriction of Saieg’s free speech rights that\nthe leafleting restriction caused.  A municipality is liable if a constitutional injury results\nfrom a policy or custom “made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may\nfairly be said to represent official policy.”  Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658,\n694–95 (1978).  In this case, the City approved the Festival “subject to . . . the rules and\nregulations of the Police Department.”  R. 47-13 (Ex. M:  Council Resolution).\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 21\nAlthough the AACC also wanted to prohibit leafleting, Chief Haddad described the\nleafleting policy as his department’s policy, subject only to the approval of the city\ncouncil and the mayor.  R. 47-11 (Ex. K:  Haddad Dep. at 95–96) (stating that “the\npolice department will supply the standards that must be met,” such as the “prohibition\nof individuals handing out . . . materials on the public sidewalk”).  The police\ndepartment’s leafleting policy, made with the authority that the City Council delegated\nto it, fairly represents official City policy.  Therefore, Saieg may hold the City liable for\nviolating his First Amendment right to free speech.\nHowever, the City is not liable for claims of selective enforcement.  Because the\nargument portion of Saieg’s appellate brief does not identify or provide citations for any\ninstances of selective enforcement, Saieg has waived the claim.  Even considering the\nmerits of Saieg’s claim, the district court properly found that the incidents of supposedly\nselective enforcement were not “so widespread as to have the force of law,” Bd. of Cnty.\nComm’rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 403–04 (1997), and are not actions\nascribable to Chief Haddad as opposed to individual officers.  720 F. Supp. 2d at 844.\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nThe leafleting restriction is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction.\nIn the inner perimeter, the restriction does not serve a substantial governmental interest.\nIn the outer perimeter, the restriction is not narrowly tailored.  The defendants therefore\nviolated Saieg’s First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  Absent an injunction,\nSaieg will continue to suffer irreparable injury for which there is no adequate remedy at\nlaw.  As a result, on the free-speech claim, we REVERSEboth the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment to the defendants and its denial of summary judgment to the\nplaintiffs.  We AFFIRM the district court’s judgment for the defendants on all other\nclaims.  We REMAND to the district court for such further proceedings as are consistent\nwith this opinion that may be warranted, including the entry of such injunctive relief in\nfavor of Saieg as may be appropriate in advance of the Festival scheduled for June\n17-19, 2011.\n\nNo. 10-1746 Saieg v. City of Dearborn, et al. Page 22\n_________________\nDISSENT\n_________________\nMARTHA CRAIG DAUGHTREY, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  In contrast to the\nmajority here, I am persuaded that the restrictions on leafleting imposed during the Arab\nInternational Festival did not violate the plaintiff’s First Amendment right to free speech.\nThose restrictions constituted a reasonable time, place, and manner limitation in service\nof a substantial government interest, and they were sufficiently narrowly tailored to\nfurther that substantial interest, as the district court held in a thoughtful and well-\ndocumented opinion granting summary judgment to the City of Dearborn and its Chief\nof Police.  While I would normally set out an analysis to support this conclusion, there\nis no reason to delay issuance of the majority’s order in this expedited appeal, given that\nthe district court has provided a masterful explanation for judgment in the defendants’\nfavor.  I therefore dissent for reasons set out in the district court’s opinion and order filed\non June 7, 2010.",

This case seeks to protect and vindicate fundamental constitutional rights.  It is a \ncivil rights action brought under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging Defendants’ policy, practice, custom, and/or \nprocedure of restricting Plaintiffs’ right to engage in religious speech activity in a traditional \npublic forum in the City of Dearborn during the 14th Annual Dearborn Arab International \nFestival (hereinafter “Free Speech Restriction”).  \n2.  The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that all public streets are \nproperly considered traditional public fora.  Public streets have immemorially been held in trust \nfor the use of the public, and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, \ncommunicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.  The Supreme Court \nhas emphasized that the streets are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information \nand opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places \nabridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.  The public streets in the City \nof Dearborn are no exception.  \n3.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants violated their clearly  established \nconstitutional rights as set forth in this Complaint; a declaration that Defendants’ Free Speech \nRestriction violates the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as set forth in this \nComplaint;  a  declaration  that  through  the  enforcement  and  attempted  enforcement  of \nDefendants’ Free Speech Restriction, Defendants have substantially burdened and unlawfully \ninfringed  upon  Plaintiffs’  rights  to  religious  exercise,  religious  expression,  and  expressive \nassociation in violation of the United States Constitutions and 42 U.S.C. § 1983; a temporary \n  2 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 3 of 12\nrestraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction enjoining the enforcement of \nDefendants’  Free  Speech  Restriction  as  set  forth  in  this  Complaint;  and  nominal  and \ncompensatory damages for the harm caused by Defendants.  Plaintiffs also seek an award of \nreasonable costs of litigation, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § \n1988 and other applicable law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This  action  arises  under  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United  States.  \nJurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343.   \n5.  Plaintiffs’ claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 2201 and 2202, by Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in \nthis district.   \nPLAINTIFFS \n6.  Plaintiff ACP is a non-profit corporation recognized by the  Internal Revenue \nService  as  a  501(c)(3)  organization.    ACP  is  incorporated  under  the  laws  of  the  State  of \nCalifornia.   \n7.  ACP is a national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy \nGospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims.  As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travels around the \ncountry attending and distributing Christian literature at Muslim festivals and mosques.  ACP \nmembers and volunteers are drawn from various church affiliations, cities, and backgrounds.  \nThe members and volunteers of ACP have the desire to practice their religious freedom and to \n  3 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 4 of 12\nfollow their religious duty based on the Great Commission.      \n8.  Plaintiff George Saieg is an adult resident of California and the founder and \ndirector of ACP.  He is a Christian pastor with a deeply-held religious conviction to evangelize \nto non-Christians.  Evangelizing and handing out religious literature and materials are important \naspects of Plaintiff Saieg’s religious beliefs and vocation. \nDEFENDANTS \n9.  Defendant City of Dearborn (hereinafter “City”) is a municipal entity organized \nand existing under the laws of the State of Michigan.  It is a municipal corporation with the right \nto sue and be sued.  The City and its officials are  responsible for creating, adopting, and \nenforcing the rules, regulations, ordinances, laws, policies, practices, procedures, and/or customs \nof the City, including the Free Speech Restriction and others related to the 14th Annual Dearborn \nArab International Festival.   \n10.  Defendant Ronald Haddad is the chief of police for the City of Dearborn Police \nDepartment.  As the chief of police, he is responsible for creating, adopting, and enforcing the \nrules, regulations, ordinances, laws, policies, practices, procedures, and/or customs of the City, \nincluding the Free Speech Restriction and others related to the 14th Annual Dearborn Arab \nInternational Festival.  Defendant Haddad is sued in his official capacity only. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n11.  The City is one of the most densely populated Muslim communities in the United \nStates.  It is estimated that out of 98,000 inhabitants, nearly 30,000 are Muslims.  Consequently, \nthe City is an important place for ACP’s outreach efforts. \n \n  4 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 5 of 12\n12.  For the past five years, ACP members and volunteers, including Plaintiff Saieg, \nhave visited the City to attend the annual Dearborn Arab International Festival (“Festival”).  \nDuring each of these years, ACP members and volunteers freely roamed the Festival, handing \nout religious literature and discussing their Christian faith.   \n13.  During prior visits, Plaintiffs have never caused any disruption to the Festival \nwith their peaceful, non-obstructive speech activities.  In fact, among the people approached by \nPlaintiffs  at  the  Festival,  approximately  eighty  to  ninety  percent  of  them  willingly  accept \nPlaintiffs’ religious materials.  ACP members and volunteers have also visited the homes of \nDearborn-area Muslims where they are often cordially invited in for tea or dinner. \n14.  The Festival, which is open to the public, will be held again in the City from \nFriday, June 19, 2009 through Sunday, June 21, 2009.  The Festival boundaries this year are as \nfollows: Warren Avenue between Hartwell and Kingsley Street; Miller Road between Warren \nAvenue and Blesser Street.  Plaintiffs plan to be at the Festival during each of these days to hand \nout religious literature and materials and to evangelize those who attend.  Plaintiffs’ materials do \nnot contain solicitations nor do they contain commercial speech; they contain religious messages. \n15.  While the roads  are closed for vehicle traffic during the  Festival, the public \nsidewalks  remain  open  for  pedestrian  traffic  in  the  City,  including  pedestrian  traffic  not \nassociated with the Festival.  For example, local commercial establishments remain open, and \npedestrians visit these establishments for commercial purposes while the Festival is being held. \n16.  Plaintiff Saieg was born and grew up in the Sudan where he never had the basic \nfreedom to share his religious beliefs with others.  Plaintiff Saieg praises God for the United \nStates of America and for its Constitution, which guarantees him the right to practice and speak \n  5 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 6 of 12\nto others about his religious faith, and to gather with others for that purpose, which is part of the \nmission of ACP. \n17.  In early June 2009, Plaintiff Saieg telephoned the Dearborn Police Department \nand spoke to Sergeant Jeff Mrowka.  Plaintiff’s purpose for telephoning the Police Department \nwas to introduce himself and his organization, to inform Defendants of Plaintiffs’ peaceful \nintention to visit the Festival once again this year to distribute religious literature and evangelize, \nand to request information concerning the precise location of the event.  Sergeant Mrowka said \nhe would call Plaintiff Saieg back with the requested information.   \n18.  When Plaintiff Saieg did not promptly hear back from Sergeant Mrowka, on June \n9, 2009, Plaintiff telephoned him again.  During that conversation, Sergeant Mrowka asked \nPlaintiff Saieg to send him an email with the name of his group, contact information, and details \nabout when Plaintiffs planned to be at the Festival.  Sergeant Mrowka advised Plaintiff of the \nFestival’s  location  and  stated  that  ACP’s  speech  activities  would  now  be  restricted  to  a \ndesignated corner on the east side of the Festival.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs would be denied the \nright to use the public sidewalks to hand out its religious materials and to discuss their Christian \nfaith. \n19.  Upon being told of the Free Speech Restriction, Plaintiff Saieg informed Sergeant \nMrowka that this was unacceptable because ACP members and volunteers were expected to \nnumber more than ninety people, that Plaintiffs had never experienced any problems during past \nvisits to the City and the Festival, that it would be impractical for so many people to be restricted \nto a single corner of the Festival, and that to be so restricted would prevent Plaintiffs from \nreaching their intended audience with their religious message.  Plaintiff Saieg told Sergeant \n  6 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 7 of 12\nMrowka that the purpose of Plaintiffs’ outreach mission would be frustrated if they were so \nrestricted by City officials. \n20.  During this conversation with Sergeant Mrowka, Plaintiff Saieg also informed the \nofficer that ACP members and volunteers had attended the Festival for the past five  years \nwithout incident, and that he instructs them to observe specific rules regulating their activities.  \nPlaintiff Saieg instructs his members and volunteers not to distribute religious materials within \nthe Festival, which occupies the street itself, and to remain on the public sidewalks on either side \nof the street.  He also advises them that they should not block any pedestrian traffic along the \nsidewalks when they are handing out their materials.  Plaintiffs have always complied with these \nsimple rules, and there has never been a problem in the past.  Consequently, Plaintiffs’ speech \nactivity is peaceful and non-obstructive. \n21.  Sergeant Mrowka responded to Plaintiff Saieg by stating that political parties and \nprotesters are limited to a specific area.  Plaintiff told the officer that ACP and its members and \nvolunteers were neither a political party nor protestors.   \n22.  Following  this  conversation  with  Sergeant  Mrowka,  Plaintiff  Saieg  tried  to \ncontact Defendant Haddad via telephone and was referred to Commander Joe Doulette, Sergeant \nMrowka’s supervisor.  Plaintiff Saieg attempted to contact Commander Doulette, but had to \nleave him a voicemail message regarding his concerns and objections with the Free Speech \nRestriction.  Commander Doulette did not return Plaintiff’s call. \n23.  After his futile attempts to get Defendants’ Free Speech Restriction lifted for \nPlaintiffs’ religious speech, Plaintiff Saieg attempted to get the matter resolved through counsel.  \n  7 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 8 of 12\nDespite these efforts, Defendants have refused to lift their Free Speech Restriction, thereby \ndenying Plaintiffs access to the public sidewalks in the City for free speech activity.  \n24.  Approximately 300,000 people annually attend the Festival.  Unless an injunction \nis issued, ACP and its members and many volunteers, who will be traveling from around the \ncountry at their own expense, will suffer irreparable harm if they are not able to fully participate \nin ACP’s outreach mission.  Many of the volunteers have limited financial resources and will be \ndeprived of their opportunity to evangelize at great personal cost. \n25.  Additionally, Plaintiffs have already invested in Gospel materials for the Festival, \nincluding leaflets, DVDs, various booklets, and books, which are packaged into a bundle and \nready  to  be  distributed  to  willing  takers.    In  all,  Plaintiffs  have  prepared  15,000  separate \npackages at a cost of approximately $50,000.  These packages are to be given away at no cost as \npart of Plaintiffs’ speech activity.  Plaintiffs recruited and/or invited ten guest speakers and \nleaders who will partake in a training program for volunteers prior to the start of the Festival.  \nThese individuals act as team leaders during the outreach program.  ACP provides these leaders \nwith airfare, lodging, ground transportation, and food at a cost of approximately $15,000.  ACP \nalso incurred a charge of approximately $2,000 for the rental of a training facility.  ACP’s \noutreach program in the City involves more than six months preparation. \n26.  In light of Plaintiffs’ history of attending the Festival for many years without \nincident, Defendants have no basis for believing or concluding that Plaintiffs’ presence on the \npublic sidewalks of the Festival for the purpose of handing out religious materials and discussing \ntheir Christian faith poses any public safety or security risks to justify restricting Plaintiffs’ \nexpressive activity.  Also, the public interest is best served by granting Plaintiffs free access to \n  8 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 1    Filed 06/16/09   Page 9 of 12\nthe Festival, specifically including free access to the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival, so \nthat they and those they associate with can exercise their fundamental rights. \n27.  Defendants’  Free  Speech  Restriction  deprives  Plaintiffs  of  their  fundamental \nrights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nFreedom of Speech—First Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n \n28.

Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 \n(1986) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).  Rule 56 provides that a summary judgment \nmotion should be granted when “the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and \nany affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is \nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”1  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   \nSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS \nA.  Plaintiff’s Constitutionally Protected Speech Activities. \nPlaintiff George Saieg is the founder and former director of Arabic Christian Perspective \n(“ACP”), a national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ to \nMuslims.2  Plaintiff is a Christian pastor with a deeply-held religious conviction to evangelize to \nnon-Christians.  Evangelizing and handing out religious literature and materials are important \naspects of Plaintiff’s religious beliefs and vocation.  Plaintiff travels around the country with other \nChristians attending and distributing Christian literature at various festivals and mosques to exercise \nhis religion and to follow his religious duty based on the Great Commission, which is the instruction \n                                            \n1 See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65 (“Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing.”). \n2 ACP board members voted to dissolve ACP in December 2009.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff will \ncontinue his Christian ministry of evangelizing Muslims at the Festival.  (Saieg Decl. at ¶6 at Ex.1). \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 10 of 29\nof the resurrected Jesus Christ to His disciples that they spread His teachings to all the nations of the \nworld.  Because the City contains one of the largest Muslim communities in the country, it is an \nimportant location for Plaintiff’s religious activities.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 1-8 at Ex.1). \nB.  City Sponsorship of the Festival. \nFor the past fourteen years, the City has sponsored the annual Festival.  The City “continues \nto be one of the major sponsors of this event providing numerous services from various city \ndepartments,”  including  the  police,  fire,  recreation,  building  and  safety,  and  public  works \ndepartments, at no cost to the Festival.3  (Beydoun 22-23, 44-46, 96-97 at Ex.3; Dep.20 at Ex.4; \nDep.2 at Ex.5; Dep.22 at Ex.6).  In 2009, for example, the police department provided 970.5 man-\nhours, which included 46.5 “volunteer hours.”  (Mrowka 44-45, 58 at Ex.7; Dep.31, 32 at Ex.8).  At \na rate of approximately $45 per hour and excluding the “volunteer hours,” the City contributed \napproximately $41,580 worth of free police services alone.4  (Mrowka 44-45, 58 at Ex.7; Dep.31, 32 \nat Ex.8; Haddad 54 at Ex.9).  The City also provides a mobile police command trailer.  (Haddad 52, \n77 at Ex.9; Dep.15, 19 at Ex.10).  City police officers patrol the Festival and the surrounding areas to \nensure compliance with the rules and regulations.  (Haddad 15-18, 70-72, 75-76 at Ex.9; Mrowka at \n18, 20, 24 at Ex.7; Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 12, 20 at Ex.1; Beydoun 40, 66, 68-69, 77 at Ex.3).  City officials \nparticipate in the opening ceremony.  (Haddad 65-68 at Ex.9; Dep.16 at Ex.11).  The City allows the \nuse of its official seal in the public advertising and marketing of the event.  (Beydoun 74-76, 96-97 \nat Ex.3; Dep.16 at Ex.11; Dep.44 at Ex.12).  Prior to its commencement, Festival organizers hold \n                                            \n3 Pursuant to the City’s ordinance, a sponsor of a special event receiving City services is required to \nenter into a contract to repay the cost for those services.  (Morello Decl. ¶ 4, C at Ex.2).   \n4 According to Ms. Fay Beydoun, the director of the Festival and the executive director of the \nAmerican Arab Chamber of Commerce, the cost of running the entire Festival, excluding the free \nCity services, is approximately $180,000.  (Beydoun 11, 14, 22-23 at Ex.3).   \n  2\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 11 of 29\nnumerous planning meetings that are attended by City officials.  (Beydoun 20-21, 81-82, 94-96 at \nEx.3; Mrowka 8-9, 63-68 at Ex.7; Dep.36, 37, 43 at Ex.13).  City officials review the various \napplications, rules, and regulations of the Festival to ensure compliance with City requirements.  \n(Beydoun 63 at Ex.3; Haddad 87, 89-91, 93, 95-96, 110-12 at Ex.9; Dep.2 at Ex.5; Mrowka 7 at \nEx.7).  City officials make special accommodations for local businesses that want to engage in \ncommercial activity on the sidewalks during the Festival.  (Beydoun 64-66, 82-83, 90-91 at Ex.3; \nDep.42 at Ex.14; Haddad 34 at Ex.9).  And City officials make special accommodations for local \nbusinesses to ensure that their commercial activity unrelated to the Festival is not adversely affected \nby the event.  (Haddad 16-18, 36-38 at Ex.9; Mrowka 69-73 at Ex.7; Beydoun 39 at Ex.3).   \nC.  Festival Boundaries: Creating a “First Amendment-Free Zone.” \nOrganizers requested via a “special events” application the use of “Warren Avenue and \nMiller Road” for the Festival.  (Beydoun 25-27, 29-30 at Ex.3; Dep.24 at Ex.15; Dep.25 at Ex.16).  \nThe City approved the application on April 27, 2009.  (Dep.24 at Ex.15).  On May 4, 2009, the City \nCouncil granted “permission to conduct the 14th Annual Dearborn Arab International Festival from \nJune 19 through June 21, 2009[,] subject to all applicable ordinances and the rules and regulations of \nthe Police Department.”  (Dep.2 at Ex.5 (emphasis added); Haddad 21, 51-52 at Ex.9).  The City \nCouncil approved “the festival boundaries” as follows: “Warren Avenue between Hartwell and \nKingsley Streets; Miller Road between Warren Avenue and Blesser Street.”  (Dep.2 at Ex.5).  \nAccordingly, the Festival’s activities took place on Warren Avenue, with a few activities held on \nMiller Road.5  (Beydoun 29, 42 at Ex.3; Mrowka 15-18 at Ex.7; Dep.3 at Ex.17).  \n                                            \n5 Defendant Haddad testified as follows: \nQ:  How about those public sidewalks, those are open all around the periphery of the festival? \nA:  They’re basically open. \n  3\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 12 of 29\nThe Festival is open to the general public; there is no admission fee required.  (Mrowka 74 at \nEx.7).  Pedestrians have free access to the Festival and the surrounding areas (Mrowka 74-75 at \nEx.7), and the City ensures pedestrian access to the local Warren Avenue businesses that do not want \nto participate in the Festival (Haddad 16-18 at Ex.9; Mrowka 69-72 at Ex.7; Tr. 19-20, 22-23, 26-27 \nat Ex.18).  In fact, the City created special parking areas that were open to persons who had no \ninterest in the Festival, but who wanted to park so as to have access to these businesses.  These \nparking areas were located along Oakman Boulevard.  (Mrowka 69-72 at Ex.7). \nDuring the 2009 Festival, the City closed off two areas to vehicle (not pedestrian) traffic, thus \ncreating two border areas—the “inner perimeter” and the “outer perimeter.”6  (Mrowka 9-11 at \nEx.7).  The “inner perimeter” contained the actual Festival activities, and its borders ran east to west \nalong Warren Avenue and a block south along Miller Road.7  (Mrowka 11-18 at Ex.7; Dep.29 at \nEx.19).  The “outer perimeter,” which contained no Festival activities, included Morrow Circle to \nthe north (running east to west), Blesser Street to the south (running east to west), Wyoming to the \neast (running north to south), and Schaeffer to the west (running north to south).8  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ \n20-21, C, at Ex.1).  The special parking areas for the business patrons were located within the “outer \nperimeter.”  (Mrowka 69-73 at Ex.7). \n                                                                                                                                          \nQ:  The festival itself, though, is closed off[,] those particular streets, isn’t that the area that they \nhave responsibility for, the actual streets themselves, isn’t that right, the festival? \nA:  That’s correct. \n(Tr. 27 at Ex.18; Mrowka 15-18 at Ex.7).  The City also erects barriers to separate the Festival \nactivities from the public sidewalks.  (Saieg Decl. ¶ 19, B at Ex.1; Beydoun 73-74 at Ex.3). \n6 The City intends to close off the same areas for the Festival in 2010.  (Haddad 99-100 at Ex.9). \n7 The “inner perimeter” consisted of areas A-1/A-2 to B-1/B-2 running east to west and area C to the \nnorth and area D to the south as depicted on Dep. 29.  (Mrowka 11-18 at Ex.7; Dep.29 at Ex.19). \n8 The “outer perimeter” consisted of area G to the north, which runs east to west, area H to the south, \nwhich runs east to west, area E to the east, which runs north to south, and area F to the west, which \nruns north and south, as depicted on Dep. 29.  (Mrowka 11-18 at Ex.7; Dep.29 at Ex.19). \n  4\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 13 of 29\nD.  Defendants’ Enforcement of the Challenged Speech Restriction. \nCity police officers would not permit Plaintiff to distribute noncommercial handbills, such as \nreligious literature, in either the “inner perimeter” or the “outer perimeter” areas during the Festival.9  \n(Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 20-21 at Ex.1; Mrowka 18, 32-33 at Ex.7; Haddad 99-100 at Ex.9; Beydoun 55, 77 at \nEx.3).  If Plaintiff did engage in such speech activity, he was subject to arrest.10  (Haddad 70-72 at \nEx.9).  Defendants enforced this restriction despite the fact that the City ordinance dealing with the \ndistribution of handbills expressly states, “It shall not be unlawful for any person to hand out or \ndistribute, without charge to the receiver thereof, any noncommercial handbill in any public place to \nany person willing to accept such noncommercial handbill.”  (Morello Decl. ¶ 2, A at Ex.2). \nE.  Defendants’ Favored Treatment of Commercial Speech. \nThe City made special provisions to accommodate the businesses along Warren Avenue to \nensure that the public sidewalks remained open for commercial activity, including commercial \nactivity unrelated to the Festival.  Defendant Haddad testified as follows: \n                                            \n9 Baby strollers were not banned from the sidewalks or other pedestrian areas during the Festival, \neven though they were a “huge” safety concern for the City.  (Haddad 18-20 at Ex.9; Ex.20). \n10 Defendant Haddad testified as follows: \nQ:  You indicated if this was distributing literature, it wouldn’t be permitted.  Would that be \nsomething if police officers were [walking] through, saw someone distributing literature within the \nconfines of the festival, they would direct them to stop doing so? \nA:  I would hope so. \nQ: Why would you hope so? \nA: Because that’s what’s expected, and you asked me would they do that, my hope would be \nthat they would. \n* * * * \nQ: Is it fair to say, for example, distributing literature either in the festival or on the sidewalks \nadjacent, somebody persisted in doing that, that there’s a possibility he could be arrested by not \ncomplying with your instructions, your officers’ instructions? \nA: Did you say possibility or probability? \nQ: There’s a possibility? \nA: Yeah, possibility. . . . \n(Haddad 70-72 at Ex.9) (emphasis added). \n  5\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 14 of 29\nQ:  You indicated you had some communications with the Warren businesses, is that \nright, sir? \nA:  That’s correct. \nQ:  And they indicated to you that they had a serious concern about making sure that \nthe public sidewalks are open for their business patrons, is that right? \nA:  That’s correct. \nQ:  And these would be business patrons who perhaps might not have any interest at \nall in the festival but want to attend that business for business purposes, is that \nright? \nA:  Any interest in anything else going on on Warren was the actual concern. \nQ:  So it might not even be people associated with the festival, but people who just \nwant to, that afternoon, they want to go down to whatever business is open, like \nthey have done in the past, and they want to make sure they can get in and out of \nthat business and have nothing to do with the festival, is that right, sir? \nA:  That’s right. \nQ:  And the City is doing everything it can to accommodate those business interests \nto make sure those sidewalks are open, is that right? \nA:  We’re going to do our best. \n \n(Tr. 26-27 at Ex.18 (emphasis added); see also Tr. 29 at Ex.18). \n* * * * \nQ:  Did you explain to [the businesses] that you were going to take any steps or \nmeasures to accommodate their concerns? \nA:  I just advised them that we’d do our very best to keep the sidewalks open. \nQ: And how were you going to do that? \nA: Have patrol on the sidewalks, officers walking up and down. \nQ: What were the things that these police officers patrolling the sidewalks, that they \nwould be looking for to ensure that you were accommodating the businesses’ \nneeds? \nA:  Just make sure that sidewalks stayed open, nobody was unduly standing around \nin places that weren’t designed for that. \nQ: How about with regard to people distributing literature or other materials on the \nsidewalk? \nA: That was not going to be permitted. \n \n(Haddad 16-18 at Ex.9) (emphasis added). \n  In addition to ensuring that the public sidewalks remained open for commercial activity, the \nCity permitted the Festival organizers to issue special sidewalk vending permits, at no charge, to the \n  6\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 15 of 29\nbusinesses along Warren Avenue.11  (Beydoun 34, 64-66, 72-73, 82-83 at Ex.3).  This commercial \nactivity was permitted even though it caused traffic problems at prior Festivals, (Beydoun 34-35 at \nEx.3; Mrowka 21-22 at Ex.7; Dep.36 at Ex.13), and during the 2009 Festival (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 25-26, \nD, E at Ex.1).  And these special “permits” were provided to persons who owned a business along \nWarren Avenue and no one else.  (Beydoun 90-91 at Ex.3; Dep.42 at Ex.14).  To distribute \nnoncommercial materials to persons during the Festival, a private citizen would have to remain at a \nfixed location on Warren Avenue and pay a fee in the amount of $150.00, as well as a $100.00 \nrefundable deposit.  If the person wanted to post a sign, there was an additional $55.00 fee for doing \nso.  (Beydoun 50-51 at Ex.3; Dep.26 at Ex.21).   \nF.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activities During the Festival. \nDuring the five years prior to 2009 (2004 to 2008), Plaintiff and his fellow Christians visited \nthe City during the Festival to evangelize and distribute their religious materials without charge to \npersons willing to accept them.  During each of these prior years, they freely roamed the perimeter of \nthe Festival, including the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival (“inner perimeter”) and the \npublic streets and sidewalks immediately surrounding the Festival (“outer perimeter”), handing out \nreligious literature and discussing their Christian faith.  During theses prior visits, City officials \ndirected Plaintiff and his associates to distribute their religious materials on the public sidewalks \nadjacent to the Festival and not to distribute them on the road where the Festival activities were \ntaking place.  Plaintiff complied with this direction and received approval from City police officers \nto distribute his religious materials accordingly.  During these prior visits, Plaintiff and his associates \n                                            \n11 In their application, Festival organizers requested that the City issue the sidewalk permits, per the \nCity’s ordinance.  (Beydoun 31 at Ex.3; Dep.24 at Ex.15; Morello Decl. ¶ 3, B (“Street Vendors” \nordinance) at Ex.2).   \n  7\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 16 of 29\nnever caused any disruption to the Festival with their speech activity, nor did they ever block or \nobstruct in any way the pedestrian traffic along the sidewalks.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 9-10 at Ex.1; Mrowka \n24 at Ex.7).  \nPlaintiff’s religious literature and materials do not contain solicitations nor do they contain \ncommercial speech.  Plaintiff is not a “vendor.”  His activities do not constitute “political \nsolicitations.”  He does not endorse a “political candidate” or a “political cause.”  His religious \nmaterials are not “political literature or paraphernalia.”  And he and his associates distribute their \nreligious materials at no charge to those who are willing to accept them.  (Saieg Decl. ¶ 23 at Ex.1; \ncompare Dep.26 at Ex.21; see also Morello Decl. ¶ 2, A at Ex.2).  The distribution of Plaintiff’s \nreligious materials does not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the message that \nPlaintiff wishes to convey; instead the recipient is free to read and view the message at a later time.  \nConsequently, Plaintiff’s distribution of his religious materials does not entail the same kind of \nproblems presented by face-to-face solicitations or sales, such as those permitted by City officials \nduring the 2009 Festival.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 14, 25-26, 29, 40, 41, D, E, I at Ex.1). \nPlaintiff does not want to participate in the Festival; he wants to evangelize the people who \ncome to Warren Avenue during the Festival.  In 2009, Defendants prohibited him from doing so and \nrequired him to remain at a fixed location as a Festival participant.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 33-40 at Ex.1). \nG.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activities During the 2009 Festival. \n \nIn 2009, Plaintiff planned to visit the City every day of the Festival to distribute religious \nliterature and materials and to evangelize.  Prior to arriving in the City, Plaintiff telephoned the City \nPolice Department and spoke to Sgt. Jeff Mrowka.  Plaintiff ’s purpose for the courtesy call was to \nintroduce himself and his organization, to inform the police of his peaceful intention to visit the City \n  8\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 17 of 29\nduring the Festival to distribute religious literature and evangelize, and to request information \nconcerning the precise location of the event.  Sgt. Mrowka said he would call Plaintiff back with the \ninformation.  During this subsequent conversation, Sgt. Mrowka advised Plaintiff of the Festival’s \nlocation and that Plaintiff would be restricted to a fixed location within the Festival.  Sgt. Mrowka \ninformed Plaintiff that he would not be allowed to use the public sidewalks to distribute his \nliterature.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 11-15 at Ex.1; Mrowka 20 at Ex.7). \nH.  Defendants’ Denial of Access to Plaintiff’s Intended Audience. \n \nDuring  the  2009  Festival,  Plaintiff  and  his  associates  had  to  restrict  their  literature \ndistribution to a fixed location on Warren Avenue pursuant to the direction of Sgt. Mrowka.  Sgt. \nMrowka initially gave Plaintiff a choice of two locations: one was near the mobile police station, \nwhich was centrally located, and the other was a more remote location on the far eastern side of the \nFestival between two carnival rides.  Plaintiff chose the central location because it would allow him \nto reach more people and because it was near the police station, which would deter people from \ndisrupting his activities and making false claims against him.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 33-34 at Ex.1). \nShortly after moving to the central location, Sgt. Mrowka informed Plaintiff and his \nassociates that they had to now move to the remote eastern location.  (Mrowka 27-30 at Ex.7 (“I \ninformed them at that point they would have to move.”)).  Plaintiff complied with the order.  As \nexpected, because the eastern location was near the Festival rides, the vast majority of people who \ncame to this location were children.  The ability to evangelize adult Muslims is made more difficult \nif Muslim children receive materials from Christians because the adult Muslims get angry if this \nhappens.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 35-37 at Ex.1). \n  9\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 18 of 29\nAdditionally, the majority of the people attending the Festival congregated around the stage \nthat was located on the far western side of the Festival to listen to the free concerts.  Plaintiff’s \neastern location was on the far opposite side of where the stage was located.  Moreover, it is very \ndifficult to evangelize Muslims from a fixed location without inviting attention to the individuals \nvisiting the booth.  Because Islamic law provides for severe penalties, including death, for \nconverting to Christianity, such attention is naturally undesirable to anyone wishing to hear \nPlaintiff’s message.  The Muslims who do approach will inevitably be watched by family, neighbors, \nand friends, subjecting them to possible ridicule, scorn, and punishment.  Consequently, Muslims \nwho are interested in Christianity are typically not willing to go to and be seen at a location that is \nknown to be occupied by Christians.  Plaintiff experienced this difficulty at the 2009 Festival.  To \nreach their intended audience with their religious message, it is essential for Plaintiff and his \nassociates to be able to distribute their religious materials while walking on the public sidewalks and \nin other public places where the exchange between the Christian and the person he or she is \nevangelizing is expected to be more personal and confidential.  This method allows the person \nreceiving the materials to do so discretely and to view them later in private.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 38-40 at \nEx.1). \nDuring prior Festivals in which Plaintiff was permitted to distribute his religious literature on \nthe public sidewalks, Plaintiff was able to reach significant numbers of people with his message.  In \n2007, Plaintiff and his associates distributed approximately 37,000 packets of religious materials, \nand in 2008, they distributed approximately 20,000.  From the fixed location in 2009, Plaintiff and \nhis associates distributed approximately 500 packets, thereby significantly diminishing their ability \nto express their message and reach their intended audience.  (Saieg Decl. ¶ 41, L at Ex.1). \n  10\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 19 of 29\nPlaintiff wants to visit the City during future Festivals to engage in his speech activities.  \nHowever, he is deterred from doing so by the threat of arrest.  (Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 44-45 at Ex.1). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activity Is Protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. \n  The First Amendment is made applicable to the States and their political subdivisions \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).  The \nFirst Amendment protects Plaintiff’s right to publicly express his religious beliefs and distribute his \nreligious materials.  Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 452 (1938) (holding that the First \nAmendment protects handing out pamphlets and leaflets).  As the United States Supreme Court has \nlong recognized, “[S]preading one’s religious beliefs” and “preaching the Gospel” are activities \nprotected by the First Amendment.  Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 110 (1943).  Supreme \nCourt precedent “establishes that private religious speech, far from being a First Amendment orphan, \nis as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private expression.”  Capitol Square \nRev. & Adv. Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 760 (1995).  Accordingly, the First Amendment’s Free \nSpeech and Free Exercise clauses protect Plaintiff’s “religious proselytizing.”  Id.    \nMoreover, “[a]mong the rights protected by the First Amendment is the right of individuals \nto associate to further their personal beliefs.  While the freedom of association is not explicitly set \nout in the Amendment, it has long been held to be implicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and \npetition.”  Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 181 (1972) (citations omitted).  As the Sixth Circuit \nechoed, “Freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable \naspect of freedom of speech.”  Connection Distributing Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 295 (6th Cir. \n1998).  “[I]mplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment” is “a \n  11\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 20 of 29\ncorresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, \neconomic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.”  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. \n609, 622 (1984).  Thus, Plaintiff’s activities are also protected by “the First Amendment’s expressive \nassociational right.”   Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 650 (2000).   \nII.  All City Streets and Sidewalks Are Traditional Public Forums. \nTo determine the extent of Plaintiff’s free speech rights, the court must engage in a forum \nanalysis.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800 (1985) (adopting “a \nforum analysis as a means of determining when the Government’s interest in limiting the use of its \nproperty to its intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for \n[expressive] purposes”).  Forum analysis traditionally divides public property into three categories: \ntraditional public forums, designated public forums, and nonpublic forums.  Id.  Traditional public \nforums, such as streets and sidewalks, are places that “have immemorially been held in trust for the \nuse of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating \nthoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions.”  Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 515 \n(1939).  Restrictions on speech in traditional public forums are sharply limited.   \nAs the Supreme Court emphasized, “[O]ur decisions identifying public streets and sidewalks \nas traditional public fora are not accidental invocations of a ‘cliché,’ but recognition that wherever \nthe title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the \npublic.  No particularized inquiry into the precise nature of a specific street is necessary; all public \nstreets are held in the public trust and are properly considered traditional public fora.”  Frisby v. \nSchultz, 487 U.S. 474, 480-81 (1988) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  “[T]he streets are \nnatural and proper places for the dissemination of information and opinion; and one is not to have \n  12\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 21 of 29\nthe exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be \nexercised in some other place.”  Schneider v. New Jersey, 308 U.S. 147, 163 (1939).  The public \nsidewalks and streets at issue here are no exception.       \nIII.  Defendants’ Speech Restriction Cannot Withstand Constitutional Scrutiny. \nA.  The Restriction on Distributing Religious Literature Violates the Constitution. \n \nIn Jamison v. Texas, 318 U.S. 413, 416 (1943), the Supreme Court stated, “[O]ne who is \nrightfully on a street which the state has left open to the public carries with him there as elsewhere \nthe constitutional right to express his views in an orderly fashion.  This right extends to the \ncommunication of ideas by handbills and literature as well as by the spoken word.”  Indeed, the \nconstitutional importance of this traditional method of communication is well established.  Lovell, \n303 U.S. at 451-452 (invalidating ordinance that banned the distribution of pamphlets); Martin v. \nCity of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141, 145-149 (1943) (invalidating ban on literature distribution and \nstating, “Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever he desires to receive it is so \nclearly vital to the preservation of a free society that . . . it must be fully preserved”). \nThere is no dispute that Defendants “may provide for control of travel on their streets to \ninsure the safety and convenience of the traveling public” and thus “may punish conduct on the \nstreets which is in violation of a valid law,” such as a City ordinance against littering, obstructing \ntravel, disorderly conduct, or disturbing the peace.  Jamison, 318 U.S. at 416.  But the Constitution \ndoes not allow Defendants to ban Plaintiff’s distribution of religious literature on public sidewalks \nthat are open to the general public, as they have done here.  Jamison, 318 U.S. at 416. \nIn this case, Defendants ensure that the public sidewalks leading into and immediately \nadjacent to Warren Avenue (“inner perimeter” and “outer perimeter”), as well as nearby parking lots \n  13\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 22 of 29\nlocated on Oakman Boulevard (“outer perimeter”), remain open for commercial traffic and \ncommercial activity unrelated to the Festival.  Thus, all of the public sidewalks in the City remain \nopen to the general public for travel and activity unrelated to the Festival.  Yet, these areas—and the \npersons using them—are deemed off limits for Plaintiff to express his views through the distribution \nof religious literature in violation of the Constitution.  Jamison, 318 U.S. at 416.  Moreover, speech \nrestrictions that impose “an absolute prohibition on a particular type of expression,” as here, “will be \nupheld only if narrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.”  United States v. \nGrace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983) (citing cases).  Defendants have no such compelling interest. \nB.  The Speech Restriction Is Content-Based in Violation of the Constitution. \n \nContent-based speech restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny.  Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802 \n(“[S]peakers can be excluded from a public forum only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a \ncompelling state interest and the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.”); Rosenberger \nv. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995).  They “are presumptively \nunconstitutional.”  S.O.C., Inc. v. County of Clark, 152 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. 1998).  And speech \nrestrictions that discriminate between commercial speech and noncommercial speech are content-\nbased.    Id.  at  1145  (“By  distinguishing  between  commercial  and  noncommercial  forms  of \nexpression, the [ordinance] is content-based.”); see generally Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, \n453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding unconstitutional a city ordinance prohibiting outdoor advertising \nbecause it discriminated on the basis of content by permitting on-site commercial speech while \nbroadly prohibiting noncommercial messages) (White, J., plurality opinion);  City of Cincinnati v. \nDiscovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 418 (1993) (invalidating an ordinance that permitted news \nracks on public streets for newspapers, but not news racks for commercial handbills).   \n  14\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 23 of 29\nIn this case, Defendants permit the local businesses—and no one else, including Plaintiff—to \nengage in commercial speech (advertising) and commercial activities (distributing items for sale) on \nthe public sidewalks immediately adjacent to Warren Avenue during the Festival—at no cost, no \nless.  As the photographic evidence shows, the crowd control, traffic, and safety issues associated \nwith the commercial sale of items along the sidewalks of Warren Avenue during the Festival far \nexceed those associated with individuals distributing (albeit contrary to the Festival restrictions) \nnoncommercial materials at no cost in this same forum.  (See Saieg Decl. ¶¶ 26-29, D, E, F, G, H, I \nat Ex.1).  In International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 690 (1992), \nJustice O’Connor, whose concurring opinion provided the narrowest grounds for the decision \nupholding the ban on solicitation and striking down the ban on leafleting in a nonpublic forum, \nstated the following: \nWhile the difficulties posed by solicitation in a nonpublic forum are sufficiently \nobvious that its regulation may ring of common-sense, the same is not necessarily \ntrue of leafleting.  To the contrary, we have expressly noted that leafleting does not \nentail  the  same  kinds  of  problems  presented  by  face-to-face  solicitation.  \nSpecifically, one need not ponder the contents of a leaflet or pamphlet in order \nmechanically to take it out of someone’s hand.  The distribution of literature does not \nrequire that the recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to \nconvey; instead, the recipient is free to read the message at a later time.  With the \npossible exception of avoiding litter, it is difficult to point to any problems intrinsic \nto the act of leafleting that would make it naturally incompatible with a large, \nmultipurpose forum such as those at issue here. \n \nId. at 690 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (internal quotations, citations, and punctuation omitted). \n  In Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981), \nJustice Blackmun made the following relevant observation: \n  15\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 24 of 29\nI think that commonsense differences between literature distribution, on the one \nhand, and solicitation and sales, on the other, suggest that the latter activities present \ngreater crowd control problems than the former.  The distribution of literature does \nnot require that the recipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes \nto convey; instead, the recipient is free to read the message at a later time. . . .  In \ncontrast, . . . sales and the collection of solicited funds not only require the fairgoer to \nstop, but also engender additional confusion because they involve acts of exchanging \narticles for money, fumbling for and dropping money, making change, etc. \n \nId. at 665 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (internal citations and punctuation omitted). \nIndeed, there is no legitimate—let alone compelling—reason for allowing businesses to \nengage in commercial activity on the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival while denying \nPlaintiff access to this same public forum by subjecting him to possible arrest for distributing \nreligious literature.  By making special accommodations that favor commercial speech and activity \nin this traditional public forum and completely banning persons who want to engage in the \ndistribution of noncommercial, religious literature, Defendants are violating the Constitution.12  As \nthe Court noted in City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 52 (1994), exemptions from a speech \nrestriction—such as allowing commercial activity on the sidewalks that Defendants claim must \nremain open for pedestrian traffic—“may be noteworthy for a reason quite apart from the risks of \nviewpoint and content discrimination:  They may diminish the credibility of the government’s \nrationale for restricting speech in the first place.”   \nIn sum, Defendants’ discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff’s speech activity in a traditional \npublic forum violates the Constitution.  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crimes \n                                            \n12 For similar reasons, Defendants’ speech restriction violates the Equal Protection Clause.  Police \nDept. of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972) (striking down under the Equal \nProtection Clause a city ordinance that prohibited all picketing within 150 feet of a school, except \npeaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute); Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980). \n  16\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 25 of 29\nVictim Bd., 592 U.S. 105, 117 (1991) (rejecting the argument that “discriminatory . . . treatment is \nsuspect under the First Amendment only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas”). \nC.  The Speech Restriction Is Not a Valid Time, Place, and Manner Restriction. \nAssuming, arguendo, that the restriction is content-neutral, the Supreme Court explained that \neven a content-neutral, time, place, and manner restriction must be narrowly tailored to advance a \nsignificant state interest, and must leave open ample alternative means of communication.  Ward v. \nRock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 802 (1989).  If it “burdens substantially more speech than is \nnecessary to further the government’s legitimate interests,” it is invalid.  Id. at 799.   \nHere, the government’s interests are crowd control, traffic, and safety.  However, as noted \npreviously, it makes little sense to permit businesses to set up fixed locations that plainly block the \npublic sidewalks and then prohibit individuals from distributing noncommercial, religious literature \nin the same forum.  If anything, Defendants should ban the sidewalk vendors—who could set up a \nbooth on Warren Avenue like all of the other vendors if they wanted to participate in the Festival—\nand allow the religious speech on the now open sidewalks.   \nMoreover—and perhaps most important—Defendants do not limit their speech restriction to \nthe public sidewalks immediately adjacent to where the Festival activities are taking place on \nWarren Avenue and Miller Road.  Instead, they created a broad, prophylactic prohibition on the \ndistribution of literature that extends beyond the actual Festival grounds to include more than 30 \nsurrounding City blocks (“outer perimeter”).13  Consequently, the City has created a “First-\nAmendment-free-zone” that has little to no connection with the Festival.  As the Supreme Court \n                                            \n13 The justification for banning vehicles does not extend to restricting literature distribution.  \nSchneider, 308 U.S. at 160 (“So long as legislation [designed to keep streets open] does not abridge \nthe constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the street to impart information through speech or the \ndistribution of literature, [the City] may lawfully regulate the conduct of those using the streets.”). \n  17\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 26 of 29\nstated, “Broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect. . . .  Precision of \nregulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms.”  \nNAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963).  Indeed, if creating a 30-block buffer zone around the \narea actually used for the Festival is a “narrowly tailored” means of ensuring crowd control, free \nflow of pedestrian traffic, or safety at the Festival, which is mostly occurring on one City street—\nWarren Avenue—then “narrow tailoring must refer not to the standards of Versace, but to those of \nOmar the tentmaker.”  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 749 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nIn United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171 (1983), the Court struck down a restriction on certain \nexpressive activity, including the distribution of literature, on the grounds of the Supreme Court, \nwhich included the surrounding sidewalks.14  The government argued that the restriction qualified as \na reasonable time, place, and manner restriction that was content-neutral, id. at 180, claiming that its \npurpose “was to provide for the protection of the building and grounds and of the persons and \nproperty therein, as well as the maintenance of proper order and decorum,” id. at 182.  The Court \nrejected the argument, noting that while the restriction did further the government’s interests, it did \nso with insufficient precision and hence at excessive cost to the freedom of speech.  Id. at 181.  \nThere was, as the Court stated, “an insufficient nexus” between the government’s interest and all of \nthe expressive activity that was banned, id.—just as here there is an insufficient nexus between the \nCity’s interests and the banning of all literature distribution within a 30-block area within the City. \nAdditionally, by banning the distribution of religious literature on the sidewalks and in other \npublic areas and forcing Plaintiff to a fixed location, Defendants’ restriction does not leave open \nample alternative means of communication, and it prevents Plaintiff from reaching his intended \n                                            \n14 The restriction did not prohibit oral expression.  Grace, 461 U.S. at 181, n.10. \n  18\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 27 of 29\naudience in violation of the Constitution.  See Bay Area Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224, \n1229 (9th Cir. 1990) (“[A]lternative mode[s] of communication may be constitutionally inadequate \nif the speaker’s ‘ability to communicate effectively is threatened [and] an alternative is not ample if \nthe speaker is not permitted to reach the ‘intended audience.’”); Members of the City Council v. \nTaxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 812 (1984) (“[A] restriction on expressive activity may be \ninvalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate.”) (citations omitted).   \nIV.  Heffron Does Not Control. \n  Plaintiff and his associates have never desired to be a part of the Festival, and they have \nnever requested to distribute literature on the Festival grounds.  Rather, Plaintiff desires to distribute \nhis religious materials in the public forums adjacent to the Festival.  Consequently, Heffron v. \nInternational Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981), is inapplicable.   \n  In Heffron, the entire fairground was used for the fair, and persons paid an admission fee to \nenter.  The fair occurred at a closed, fixed location entirely dedicated for that purpose—there was no \nongoing business activity on the fairgrounds nor pedestrian traffic moving through that was \nunrelated to the fair, as in this case.  Indeed, here, the only locations dedicated solely for Festival \nactivities are Warren Avenue and parts of Miller Road—the areas requested by the organizers and \napproved by the City—excluding the sidewalks, which are open to pedestrian traffic unrelated to the \nFestival.  And none of the “outer perimeter”—the 30-block buffer zone—is dedicated to Festival \nactivities.  In sum, Heffron involved a “place” restriction upon expressive activity undertaken on \nproperty that was designated for a limited, special purpose.  The restriction did not extend beyond \nthe fairgrounds and into the surrounding city sidewalks and streets, as in this case.   \n \n  19\n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 30-2    Filed 03/15/10   Page 28 of 29\nV.  Plaintiff Is Entitled to Preliminary and Immediate Injunctive Relief. \nIn determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a court considers four factors: \n  (1) the plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the plaintiff could \nsuffer irreparable harm without the injunction; (3) whether granting the injunction \nwill cause substantial harm to others; and (4) the impact of the injunction on the \npublic interest. \n \nConnection Distributing Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998); Hamilton’s Bogarts, Inc. v. \nMichigan, 501 F.3d 644, 649 (6th Cir. 2007).  In a First Amendment case, however, “the crucial \ninquiry is usually whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.  This \nis so because, as in this case, the issues of the public interest and harm to the respective parties \nlargely depend on the constitutionality of the [restriction].”  Id; Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976) (“The loss of First Amendment freedoms . . . constitutes irreparable injury.”).   \nHere, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment on his constitutional claims as a matter of law.  \nConsequently, this court should enjoin the enforcement of Defendants’ speech restriction so as to \nallow Plaintiff to engage in his speech activity during the 2010 Festival, which is scheduled for June \n18-20, 2010.  See Norfolk v. Cobo Hall Conference & Exhibition Ctr., 543 F. Supp. 2d 701 (E.D. \nMich. 2008) (preliminarily enjoining a restriction on leafleting inside Cobo Center). \nCONCLUSION \n \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this court grant his motion and immediately enjoin the \nenforcement of Defendants’ speech restriction. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nTHOMAS MORE LAW CENTER \n \n/s/Robert J.

This case seeks to protect and vindicate fundamental constitutional rights.  It is a \ncivil rights  action brought under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United  States \nConstitution and 42  U.S.C.  § 1983, challenging Defendants' policy, practice,  custom,  and/or \nprocedure of restricting Plaintiffs'  right to  engage  in religious  speech activity in traditional \npublic fora in the City of Dearborn during the Annual Dearborn Arab  International Festival \n(hereinafter  \"Free  Speech  Restriction\").  Defendants'  Free  Speech  Restriction  prohibited \nPlaintiffs from distributing their religious materials at no  charge to willing recipients on the \npublic sidewalks and within other public places during the 2009 annual festival and relegated \nthem to a fixed, remote location that denied them access to their intended audience and frustrated \ntheir efforts to evangelize. \n2.  The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that all public streets and \nsidewalks are properly considered traditional public fora.  These public fora have immemorially \nbeen held in trust for the use of the public, and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of \nassembly,  communicating thoughts  between  citizens,  and  discussing public  questions.  The \nSupreme Court has emphasized that the streets and sidewalks are natural and proper places for \nthe dissemination of information and opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of \nexpression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other \nplace.  The public streets and sidewalks in the City of Dearborn are no exception. \n3.  Defendants'  Free  Speech  Restriction  favors  commerCial  speech  over \nnoncommercial speech and is thereby an impermissible content-based restriction.  Moreover, the \n2 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 3 of 25\nFree Speech Restriction is not narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest nor \ndoes it leave open ample alternatives for Plaintiffs' religious speech. \n4.  Defendants'  selective  enforcement  of the  Free  Speech  Restriction  disfavored \nPlaintiffs'  Christian  religious  speech  and  favored  other  viewpoints,  messages,  and  speech, \nincluding commercial speech and solicitations. \n5.  Plaintiffs  seek  a declaration that  Defendants  violated their clearly  established \nconstitutional rights as set forth in this First Amended Complaint; a declaration that Defendants' \nFree Speech Restriction violates the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as set forth \nin this First Amended Complaint;  a declaration that through the enforcement and attempted \nenforcement of Defendants' Free Speech Restriction, Defendants have substantially burdened \nand unlawfully infringed upon Plaintiffs' rights to religious exercise, religious expression, and \nexpressive association in violation of the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C.  § 1983; a \npreliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the enforcement of Defendants'  Free Speech \nRestriction  as  set  forth  in  this  First  Amended  Complaint;  and  nominal  and  compensatory \ndamages for the harm caused by Defendants.  Plaintiffs also seek an award of reasonable costs of \nlitigation,  including  attorneys'  fees  and  expenses,  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  §  1988  and  other \napplicable law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This  action  arises  under  the  Constitution  and  laws  of the  United  States. \nJurisdiction is conferred on this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343. \n7.  Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \n§§  2201  and 2202, by Rules 57  and 65  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the \n3 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 4 of 25\ngeneral legal and equitable powers of this Court.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) \nbecause a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiffs' claims occurred in \nthis district. \nPLAINTIFFS \n8.  Plaintiff ACP is a nonprofit, religious organization that is incorporated under the \nlaws of the State of California. \n9.  ACP is a national ministry established for the purpose of proclaiming the Holy \nGospel of Jesus Christ to  Muslims.  As part of its outreach efforts, ACP travels around the \ncountry attending and distributing Christian literature at festivals and mosques.  ACP members \nand  volunteers  are  drawn  from  various  church  affiliations,  cities,  and  backgrounds.  The \nmembers and volunteers of ACP have the desire to practice their religious freedom and to follow \ntheir religious duty based on the Great Commission. \n10.  The Great Commission, in Christian tradition, is the instruction of the resurrected \nJesus Christ to His disciples that they spread His teachings to all the nations of the world.  It has \nbecome a tenet in Christian theology, emphasizing mission work, evangelism, and baptism.  It \nhas been a primary basis for Christian missionary activity.  It is found in the New Testament at \nMatthew 28:16-20, Mark 16:14-18, Luke 24:44-49, Acts 1:4-8, and John 20:19-23. \n11.  Plaintiff George  Saieg is  an  adult resident of California and  the founder  and \ndirector of ACP.  He is a Christian pastor with a deeply-held religious conviction to evangelize \nto non-Christians.  Evangelizing and handing out religious literature and materials are important \naspects of Plaintiff Saieg's religious beliefs and vocation. \n4 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 5 of 25\nDEFENDANTS \n12.  Defendant City of Dearborn (hereinafter \"City\") is a municipal entity organized \nand existing under the laws of the State of Michigan.  It is a municipal corporation with the right \nto  sue  and  be  sued.  The  City and  its  officials  are  responsible  for  creating,  adopting,  and \nenforcing the rules, regulations, ordinances, laws, policies, practices, procedures, and/or customs \nof the City,  including the Free Speech Restriction,  the Festival \"Rules &  Regulations,\" and \nothers related to the Annual Dearborn Arab International Festival. \n13.  Defendant Ronald Haddad is the chief of police for the City of Dearborn Police \nDepartment.  As the chief of police, he is responsible for creating, adopting, and enforcing the \nrules, regulations, ordinances, laws, policies, practices, procedures, and/or customs of the City, \nincluding the Free Speech Restriction, the Festival \"Rules & Regulations,\" and others related to \nthe Annual  Dearborn Arab  International Festival.  Defendant Haddad is  sued in his official \ncapacity only. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Annual Arab Festival Sponsored by the City. \n14.  The City contains one of the most densely populated Muslim communities in the \nUnited States.  It is estimated that out of 98,000 inhabitants, approximately 30,000 are Muslims. \nConsequently, the City is an important location for ACP's Christian outreach efforts. \n15.  For the  past  fourteen  years,  the  Annual  Dearborn Arab  International  Festival \n(\"Festival\") was held in the City.  The City will continue to hold the Festival in the future. \n16.  On  or about May 4,  2009,  the  City granted  the American Arab  Chamber of \nCommerce and the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services (\"A.C.C.E.S.S.\") \n5 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 6 of 25\n\"pennission to  conduct the  14th Annual Dearborn Arab  International  Festival from  June  19 \nthrough June 21, 2009 subject to all applicable ordinances and the rules and regulations of the \nPolice Department.\" \n17.  The  City  also  authorized  \"assistance  from  the  Dearborn  Police,  Fire,  Public \nWorks, Building & Safety and Recreation Departments to insure a safety (sic), healthy, fun and \nsuccessful event.\" \n18.  As in prior years, the 2009 Festival was open to the general public. \n19.  According to the City, the Festival boundaries for 2009 were as follows: Warren \nAvenue between Hartwell Street and Kingsley Street; Miller Road between Warren Avenue and \nBlesser Street.  The Festival was mainly held on Warren Avenue, which is a public place.  And \nthe eastern barrier was actually placed at Middlepoint Avenue. \n20.  The Festival occupied the streets; it did not occupy the public sidewalks.  The \npublic sidewalks were not part of the Festival. \n21.  As  in prior years,  the City closed  certain roads  for  vehicle traffic during the \nFestival.  However,  while  the  roads  were  closed  to  vehicular  traffic,  the  adjacent  public \nsidewalks remained open for pedestrian traffic, including pedestrian traffic not associated with \nthe Festival.  For example, local commercial establishments along Warren Avenue remained \nopen, and pedestrians visited these establishments for commercial purposes while the Festival \nwas being held. \n22.  Defendants made special provisions to accommodate the businesses along Warren \nAvenue to  ensure that  the  public  sidewalks  remained  open  for  business  activity,  including \ncommercial speech, which was unrelated to the Festival. \n6 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 7 of 25\n23.  Defendants  ensured  that  the  public  sidewalks,  including  those  immediately \nadjacent to  the Festival, remained open for pedestrians who had no  interest in attending the \nFestival  but  wanted  to  patronize  the  businesses  along  Warren  Avenue  instead.  This \naccommodation was made to assist and promote the Warren Avenue businesses.  Consequently, \nthe Festival boundaries did not include the adjacent public sidewalks. \n24.  In addition to the boundaries of the Festival, Defendants also placed barriers on \nthe public streets to restrict vehicular traffic beyond the Festival boundaries.  These barriers were \nplaced approximately one block to  the north (along Morrow Circle),  one block to  the south \n(along  Blesser  Street),  approximately  five  blocks  to  the  west  (along  Schaefer  Road)  and \napproximately  five  blocks  to  the  east  (along  Wyoming  Street)  of the  Festival  boundaries \n(hereinafter referred to as the \"Border Area\").  A true and accurate photo graph taken during the \n2009 Festival of the western border at Hartwell Street looking toward the stage at the Festival is \nattached to this First Amended Complaint as Exhibit 1.  A true and accurate photograph taken \nduring the 2009 Festival of the western border at Schaefer Road looking toward Hartwell Street \n(the western section of the Border Area) is attached to this First Amended Complaint as Exhibit \n2. \n25.  The City police department established a mobile police station in the center of the \nFestival, and the City employed uniform police officers to enforce the rules, regulations, and \nrestrictions of the Festival, including the Free Speech Restriction.  City police officers patrolled \nthe public sidewalks in order to enforce the Free Speech Restriction against Plaintiffs. \n7 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 8 of 25\nB.  Plaintiffs' Free Speech Activity. \n26.  Plaintiff Saieg was born and grew up in the Sudan where he never had the basic \nfreedom to share his religious beliefs with others.  Plaintiff Saieg praises God for the United \nStates of America and for its Constitution, which guarantees him the right to practice and speak \nto others about his religious faith, and to gather with others for that purpose, which is part of the \nmission of ACP. \n27.  During the previous five  years (2004 to  2008), ACP members and volunteers, \nincluding Plaintiff Saieg, visited the City to express their religious message to persons attending \nthe Festival by evangelizing and distributing their religious materials without charge to persons \nwilling to accept them.  During each of these prior years, ACP members and volunteers freely \nroamed the perimeter of the Festival (i.e., along the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival), \nhanding out religious literature and discussing their Christian faith. \n28.  During Plaintiffs' prior visits to the Festival, Festival officials directed Plaintiffs \nto distribute their religious materials on the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival borders and \nnot to distribute them within the Festival.  Plaintiffs complied with this direction and received \napproval  from  City  police  officers  to  distribute  their  religious  materials  on  these  public \nsidewalks. \n29.  During these prior visits, Plaintiffs never caused any disruption to the Festival \nwith their peaceful, non-obstructive speech activity.  Plaintiffs never blocked nor obstructed in \nany way the pedestrian traffic along the sidewalks adjacent to the Festival.  And anl0ng the \npeople approached by Plaintiffs during these visits to the Festival, approximately eighty to ninety \npercent of them willingly accepted Plaintiffs' religious materials.  ACP members and volunteers \n8 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 9 of 25\nalso visited the homes of Dearborn-area Muslims where they were often cordially invited in for \ntea or dinner. \n30.  Plaintiffs planned to visit the 2009 Festival and/or the public areas immediately \nadjacent  to  it  every day of the  event  to  distribute religious  literature  and  materials  and  to \nevangelize those individuals who attended the event and those individuals who were patronizing \nthe business establishments along Warren Avenue that were not part of the Festival.  Plaintiffs' \nmaterials  do  not  contain  solicitations  nor  do  they  contain  commercial  speech;  they  contain \nreligious messages. \n31.  Plaintiffs  are  not  \"vendors.\"  Their  activities  do  not  constitute  \"political \nsolicitations.\"  Their activities do not endorse a \"political candidate\" or a \"political cause.\"  And \nPlaintiffs' religious materials are not \"political literature or paraphernalia.\"  Plaintiffs distribute \ntheir religious materials at no charge to those who are willing to accept them. \n32.  The  distribution  of Plaintiffs'  religious  materials  does  not  requIre  that  the \nrecipient stop in order to receive the message that Plaintiffs wish to convey; instead the recipient \nis free to read and view the message at a later time.  Consequently, Plaintiffs' distribution of their \nreligious  materials  does  not  entail  the  same  kind  of problems  presented  by  face-to-face \nsolicitations or sales.  Indeed, one need not ponder the contents of Plaintiffs' religious materials \nin order mechanically to take them out of the hand of one of the members or volunteers of ACP. \n33.  Plaintiffs invested in Gospel materials for the Festival, including leaflets, DVDs, \nvarious booklets, and books, which were packaged into a bundle and ready to be distributed to \nwilling takers.  In all, Plaintiffs prepared 15,000 separate packages at a cost of approximately \n$50,000.  These packages were to be given away at no cost as part of Plaintiffs' speech activity. \n9 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 10 of 25\n34.  Plaintiffs recruited and/or invited over 75 team members, 6 guest speakers, and 11 \nteam leaders to participate in the outreach program during the Festival.  The team leaders and \nspeakers held a training program for the team members prior to the start of the Festival.  ACP \nprovided  the  leaders,  guest  speakers,  and  some  members  with  airfare,  lodging,  ground \ntransportation, and food.  Additionally, the speakers received an honorarium.  The total cost for \nthese expenses was approximately $29,860. \n35.  ACP  incurred  a  charge  of approximately  $1,200  for  the  rental  of a  training \nfacility. \n36.  ACP's outreach program in the City involves more than six months preparation. \nIn April 2009, for example, Plaintiff Saieg and 3 other members of ACP traveled to Michigan in \norder to make preparations for their religious activities.  This trip cost approximately $2,000. \nC.  Content-Based \"Rules & Regulations\" & Free Speech Restriction. \n37.  According to the 2009 Festival \"Rules & Regulations,\" \"No political solicitation \nof any kind shall be permitted at Festival entrance points or other areas where such activity \nwould impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic,\" \"No political literature or paraphernalia shall be \npassed out inside anywhere on festival  grounds,\" \"Political candidates, or those supporting a \npolitical cause, shall not set up any stands, booths tables tents [sic] or podiums,\" \"No sales or \nsolicitation shall be permitted outside designated vendor areas,\" \"No tents, booths, canopies, tent \nextensions or temporary shelters may be erected without prior approval of the Festival Director,\" \n\"No political or unrelated advertising signs shall be posted in booths or outside the vendor tents,\" \nand \"All vendor activities shall be confined to designated rental areas.\" \n10 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 11 of 25\n38.  Defendants selectively enforced the 2009 Festival \"Rules & Regulations\" in a \nmanner that favored certain political, commercial, and other speech, including solicitations, over \nPlaintiffs' religious expression. \n39.  For example, some \"vendors\" with booths inside the Festival were permitted to \ndistribute \"political paraphernalia\" expressing a political message.  One such item was at-shirt \nwith the Calvin character from the Calvin & Hobbes cartoon urinating on the national flag of the \nState of Israel.  Additionally, local businesses were permitted to sell items and solicit customers \noutside designated vendor areas.  These businesses were not confined to designated rental areas; \nthey were permitted to engage in commercial transactions and commercial speech on the public \nsidewalks adjacent to the Festival boundaries. \n40.  In addition to and as an extension of the 2009 Festival \"Rules &  Regulations,\" \nDefendants created and enforced against Plaintiffs the Free Speech Restriction, which restricted \nPlaintiffs'  distribution  of free  religious  materials  to  one  fixed  location  within  the  Festival, \nthereby  prohibiting  Plaintiffs  from  distributing  their  free  religious  materials  on  the  public \nsidewalks  adjacent to  the Festival.  Defendants  also  enforced the  speech restriction  against \nPlaintiffs in the northern, southern, and western sections of the Border Area, thereby prohibiting \nPlaintiffs from distributing their free religious materials in these public places as  well.  The \nwestern  section  of the  Border Area was  the  most  densely  populated  area  surrounding  the \nFestival.  Consequently, Plaintiffs were denied access to this \"audience\" for distributing their \nreligious materials. \n41.  According  to  Section  14-81  of Chapter  14  of Article  IV  of the  Code  of \nOrdinances for the City (hereinafter \"Section 14-81 \"), \"It shall be unlawful for any person to \n11 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 12 of 25\ndeposit, place, throw, scatter or cast any commercial handbill in or upon any public place within \nthis city.  It shall be unlawful for any person to hand out, distribute or sell any commercial \nhandbill in any public place.  It shall not be unlawful for any person to hand out or distribute, \nwithout charge to the receiver thereof, any noncommercial handbill in any public place to any \nperson willing to accept such noncommercial handbill.\"  (emphasis added). \n42.  During the Festival, Defendants suspended the protections of Section 14-81  for \nPlaintiffs by prohibiting them from distributing their religious materials on the public sidewalks \nadjacent to the Festival and from within certain other public places in the Border Area. \n43.  During the Festival, commercial establishments were permitted by Defendants to \nset up tables along the sidewalks to engage in commercial speech and to sell items to pedestrians \non the public sidewalks.  Defendants did not restrict this commercial speech and activity to a \nfixed location within the Festival boundaries.  True and accurate photographs taken during the \n2009 Festival demonstrating these facts are attached to this First Amended Complaint as Exhibit \n3. \n44.  During the Festival, Defendants permitted individuals and groups not associated \nwith Plaintiffs to distribute commercial, political, religious, and other materials on the public \nsidewalks adjacent to the Festival and in the Border Area.  These individuals and groups were \nnot restricted to a fixed location within the Festival.  Defendants also permitted individuals and \ngroups not  associated with Plaintiffs to  distribute  commercial,  political,  religious,  and  other \nmaterials while roaming within the Festival.  Defendants did not restrict these individuals and \ngroups  to  a  fixed  location.  True and  accurate photographs  taken  during the 2009  Festival \ndemonstrating these facts are attached to this First Amended Complaint as Exhibit 4. \n12 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 13 of 25\n45.  During the 2009 Festival, Defendants allowed the public sidewalks to be used for \nand to be blocked by commercial activities, including commercial speech activity.  During the \nFestival, private businesses placed out tables that blocked major sections of the sidewalk, and \nsome of the commercial vendors within the Festival were permitted to block the sidewalk.  True \nand accurate photographs taken during the 2009 Festival demonstrating these facts are attached \nto this First Amended Complaint as Exhibits 3 and 5. \nD.  Plaintiffs\" Notification of Their Intent to Distribute Free Religious Materials. \n46.  In early June 2009, Plaintiff Saieg telephoned the City Police Department and \nspoke to Sergeant Jeff Mrowka.  Plaintiff's purpose for telephoning the Police Department was \nto introduce himself and his organization, to inform Defendants of Plaintiffs' peaceful intention \nto visit the Festival area once again this year to distribute religious literature and evangelize, and \nto request information concerning the precise location of the event.  Sergeant Mrowka said he \nwould call Plaintiff Saieg back with the requested information. \n47.  When Plaintiff Saieg did not promptly hear back from Sergeant Mrowka, on June \n9,  2009,  Plaintiff telephoned him again.  During that conversation,  Sergeant Mrowka asked \nPlaintiff Saieg to send him an email with the name of his group, contact information, and details \nabout when Plaintiffs planned to be at the Festival.  Sergeant Mrowka advised Plaintiff of the \nFestival's  location  and  stated  that  ACP's  speech  activities  would  now  be  restricted  to  a \ndesignated comer on the east side of the Festival.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs would be denied the \nright to use the public sidewalks to express their faith by handing out religious materials. \n48.  Upon being told of the Free Speech Restriction, Plaintiff Saieg informed Sergeant \nMrowka that this was unacceptable because ACP members and volunteers were expected to \n13 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 14 of 25\nnumber more than ninety people, that Plaintiffs had never experienced any problems during past \nvisits to the City and the Festival, that it would be impractical for so many people to be restricted \nto  a single comer of the Festival, and that to  be so  restricted would prevent Plaintiffs from \nreaching their intended audience with their religious message.  Plaintiff Saieg told Sergeant \nMrowka that the purpose of Plaintiffs'  outreach mission would be frustrated if they were so \nrestricted by City officials. \n49.  During this conversation with Sergeant Mrowka, Plaintiff Saieg also informed the \nofficer that ACP  members  and  volunteers  had  attended  the Festival  for  the past five  years \nwithout incident, and that he instructs them to observe specific rules regulating their activities. \nPlaintiff Saieg customarily instructs his members and volunteers, and so instructed them prior to \nvisiting  the  2009  Festival,  not  to  distribute  religious  materials  within  the  Festival,  which \noccupies the street itself, and to remain on the public sidewalks on either side of the street.  He \nalso customarily advises them, and so advised them prior to visiting the 2009 Festival, that they \nshould not block any pedestrian traffic along the sidewalks when they are handing out their \nmaterials.  Plaintiffs have always complied with these simple rules, and there has never been a \nproblem in the past.  Consequently, Plaintiffs' speech activity is peaceful and non-obstructive. \n50.  Sergeant Mrowka responded to Plaintiff Saieg by stating that political parties and \nprotesters are limited to a specific area.  Plaintiff told the officer that ACP and its members and \nvolunteers were neither a political party nor protestors. \n51.  Following  this  conversation  with  Sergeant  Mrowka,  Plaintiff Saieg  tried  to \ncontact Defendant Haddad via telephone and was referred to Commander Joe Doulette, Sergeant \nMrowka's supervisor.  Plaintiff Saieg attempted to  contact Commander Doulette, but had to \n14 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 15 of 25\nleave him a voicemail message regarding his  concerns and objections with the Free Speech \nRestriction.  Commander Doulette did not return Plaintiff scalI. \n52.  After his  futile  attempts to  get  Defendants'  Free  Speech Restriction lifted for \nPlaintiffs' religious speech, Plaintiff Saieg attempted to get the matter resolved through counsel. \nDespite these efforts, Defendants refused to lift their Free Speech Restriction, thereby denying \nPlaintiffs access to the public sidewalks and other public areas within the City for free speech \nactivity. \nE.  Plaintiffs  Were  Denied  Access  to  Their  Intended  Audience  and  Denied \nAmple Alternatives to Communicate Their Religious Message. \n53.  During  the  Festival  and  pursuant  to  the  Free  Speech  Restriction,  Sergeant \nMrowka gave Plaintiffs a choice of two fixed locations.  One was near the mobile police station, \nwhich was centrally located, and the other was a remote location on the far eastern side of the \nFestival between two rides.  Plaintiffs chose the central location because it would allow them to \nreach more people and because it was near the police station, which would deter people from \ndisrupting their activities and from making false claims against them.  Plaintiffs also did not want \nto be situated between rides where adults attending the Festival with their children would be \nunlikely to approach Plaintiffs' booth. \n54.  Shortly after moving all of their materials to the central location, which was a \ndifficult and time consuming task, Sergeant Mrowka informed Plaintiffs that the City required \nthem to move from the location they had chosen-and that they had gone to significant effort to \nset up-to the remote eastern location.  Plaintiffs complied with this order and moved to the \nremote location. \n15 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 16 of 25\n55.  Plaintiffs were relegated to this remote location in order to minimize the impact of \ntheir message. \n56.  Because the remote eastern location was near the Festival rides, the vast majority \nof people who came to this location were adults with children. \n57.  The ability to evangelize Muslims is made more difficult when the adult Muslims \nare with their children because Muslims are reluctant to have their children receive any materials \nfrom Christians. \n58.  A majority of the people attending the Festival congregated around the stage that \nwas located on the far western side of the Festival to  listen to  the free  concerts.  Plaintiffs' \neastern location was on the far opposite side of where the stage was located.  Consequently, \nPlaintiffs  were unable to  reach the  majority of the people attending the  Festival  with their \nreligious materials. \n59.  It is very difficult to evangelize Muslims fron1 a fixed location without inviting \nattention to the individuals visiting the booth.  Because Islamic law provides for severe penalties, \nincluding death, for converting to Christianity, such attention is naturally undesirable to anyone \nwishing to hear Plaintiffs' religious message.  The Muslims who do approach will inevitably be \nwatched  by family,  neighbors,  and  friends,  subjecting them  to  possible ridicule,  scorn,  and \npunishment.  Consequently, Muslims who are interested in Christianity are typically not willing \nto go to and be seen at a location that is known to be occupied by a Christian organization such \nas  ACP.  Plaintiffs experienced this difficulty at the 2009 Festival and were thus denied the \nability to adequately distribute their religious materials, to reach their intended audience, and to \n16 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 17 of 25\naccomplish their goal of interacting with and evangelizing large numbers of people attending the \nFestival. \n60.  In order to reach their intended audience-Muslims that Plaintiffs seek to inform \nabout and convert to Christianity-with their religious message, it is essential for Plaintiffs to be \nable distribute their religious materials while walking on the public sidewalks and in other public \nplaces where the exchange between the ACP member or volunteer and the person he or she is \nevangelizing is expected to be more personal and confidential.  This method allows the person \nreceiving the religious materials to do so discretely and to take the materials to read or view in \nprivate at a later time without being exposed to ridicule, scorn, or punishment, which is likely if \nthe individual was seen receiving materials at the ACP booth. \n61.  During  prior  Festivals  in  which  Plaintiffs  were  permitted  to  distribute  their \nreligious materials on the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival, Plaintiffs were able to reach \nsignificant numbers of people with their religious message.  For example, in 2007, Plaintiffs \ndistributed approximately 37,000 packets of religious materials, and in 2008, they distributed \napproximately 20,000.  From the remote location at the 2009 Festival, Plaintiffs were only able \nto  distribute  approximately  500  packets  of their  religious  materials,  thereby  significantly \ndiminishing their ability to express their message and reach their intended audience.  This remote \nlocation did not provide an ample alternative for Plaintiffs to engage in their religious speech. \n62.  It was known by the City that Plaintiffs effectively evangelized and converted \nmany Muslims to Christianity during prior Festivals.  To avoid any controversies arising from \nPlaintiffs'  religious  activity  and  to  minimize  the  impact  of Plaintiffs'  speech,  Defendants \n17 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 18 of 25\nimposed the Free Speech Restriction against Plaintiffs and relegated them to locations where \ntheir speech would be less effective. \nF.  Defendants Had No Legitimate Basis for Restricting Plaintiffs' Speech. \n63.  In light of Plaintiffs' history of attending the Festival for many years without \nincident, Defendants had no basis for believing or concluding that Plaintiffs' presence on the \npublic sidewalks adjacent to the Festival for the purpose of handing out religious materials and \ndiscussing their Christian faith posed any public safety, crowd control, or security issues or risks \nto justify restricting Plaintiffs' expressive activity.  Also, the public interest would have been \nbest served by granting Plaintiffs free access to the Festival, specifically including free access to \nthe public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival and to the entire Border Area, so that Plaintiffs and \nthose they associate with could have exercised their fundamental rights. \n64.  Defendants permitted business establishments to engage in commercial activity \nand speech on the public sidewalks adjacent to the Festival, and they permitted other groups and \nindividuals  to  distribute materials  on the public  sidewalks  adjacent to  the Festival with no \nevidence  of public  safety,  crowd  control,  security  or  other  such  issues  or  risks,  thereby \ndemonstrating that Defendants' justification for restricting Plaintiffs'  religious  speech was  a \nsham. \nG.  Present and Future Harm Caused by Defendants. \n65.  As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' restrictions on Plaintiffs' religious \nspeech activity, Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm. \n66.  Defendants'  Free  Speech  Restriction  prevented  Plaintiffs  and  those  who \nassociated with Plaintiffs from reaching their intended audience with their religious message. \n18 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 19 of 25\nAdditionally, due to the Free Speech Restriction, many ACP volunteers, nearly 25% of them, \ndecided not to travel to the Festival since the restriction greatly limited their ability to effectively \nevangelize. \n67.  Plaintiffs will attend future Festivals in order to engage in their speech activities, \nwhich  include  handing  out  religious  materials.  However,  upon  information  and  belief, \nDefendants  will  impose their  Free  Speech Restriction  against  Plaintiffs  during  these  future \nFestivals,  thereby  requiring  injunctive  relief  to  allow  Plaintiffs  to  engage  in  their  First \nAmendment activity without government interference. \n68.  As a direct consequence of Defendants' Free Speech Restriction, Plaintiffs had to \npurchase a tent, table, and chairs in order to establish their booth for distributing their religious \nmaterials.  Persons  seeking to  distribute  materials  at  the  Festival  must pay fees  and  incur \nadditional costs to do so.  Upon information and belief, Plaintiffs will be charged such fees and \nwill incur such costs during future visits. \n69.  Because  Defendants'  Free  Speech  Restriction  substantially  limited  Plaintiffs' \nability to distribute their religious materials, Plaintiffs were left with a large surplus of materials. \nConsequently, Plaintiffs were required to rent space to store the leftover materials.  A true and \naccurate photograph of the leftover materials is attached to this First Amended Complaint as \nExhibit 6. \n70.  An estimated 300,000 people annually attend the Festival.  Defendants expected \nthe 2009 Festival to be the largest Festival to  date.  As a result of Defendants' Free Speech \nRestriction, ACP and its members and many volunteers, who travelled from around the country \nat their own expense, suffered irreparable harm by not being able to fully participate in ACP's \n19 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 20 of 25\noutreach mission.  Many of the  volunteers have limited  financial  resources  and have been \ndeprived of their opportunity to evangelize at great personal cost. \n71.  Defendants' Free Speech Restriction deprived Plaintiffs and those who associate \nwith them of their fundamental rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nFreedom of Speech-First Amendment \n(42 U.S.C. § 1983) \n72.  Plaintiffs hereby incorporate by reference all above-stated paragraphs. \n73.  By reason of the aforementioned Free Speech Restriction, created, adopted, and \nenforced under color of state law, Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of their right to engage in \nreligious expression in traditional public fora in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First \nAmendment  as  applied  to  the  states  and  their  political  subdivisions  under  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \n74.  By favoring commercial speech over private religious speech, Defendants' Free \nSpeech  Restriction  is  content  based  in  violation  of the  Free  Speech  Clause  of the  First \nAmendment. \n75.  Defendants' Free Speech Restriction is not narrowly tailored to serve a significant \ngovernment interest nor does it leave open ample alternatives for Plaintiffs to meaningfully and \neffectively express their religious message in violation of the Free Speech Clause of the First \nAmendment. \n20 \n\nCase 2:09-cv-12321-PDB-RSW   Document 13    Filed 07/07/09   Page 21 of 25\n76.

INTRODUCTION  The next day, on June 18, 2009—the day before the start \nof  the  2009  Festival—Presiding  U.S.  District  Judge \nThis  case  is  brought  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth  Nancy  G.  Edmunds  held  an  evidentiary  hearing  on \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. Plaintiff  Plaintiffs emergency motion and denied injunctive relief.4 \nGeorge Saieg is the founder and former director of Arab  Ruling from the bench, Judge Edmunds stated: \nChristian  Perspective  (“ACP”),  a  national  ministry    \nestablished for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel of \nJesus  Christ  to  Muslims.1  Defendants  are  the  City  of  the question is really whether the restriction imposed \nDearborn (“Dearborn” or “the City”) and its Police Chief,  by the organizers of the festival and enforced by the \nRonald  Haddad  (collectively,  “Defendants”).2  Plaintiff  City of Dearborn are neutral with respect to content and \nseeks  a  declaration  that  his  free  speech  rights  were  are justified under the restriction of time—places on \nabridged  when  Defendants  restricted  the  ability  of  time, method and place. And it seems to me that they \nPlaintiff and his associates to distribute religious literature  clearly are. They do not distinguish among the content \nwhile  walking  around  last  year’s  annual  Arab  of what’s being distributed or promulgated, they are \nInternational Festival (the “Festival”), which is an outdoor  narrowly focused, they do provide an alternative means \nevent organized by a private organization and held every  of  access.  It’s  not  the  method  of  access  that  the \nsummer  in  Dearborn,  Michigan.  Plaintiff  also  seeks  plaintiffs would choose if they could have their way on \ninjunctive relief preventing Defendants from imposing the  this, but it appears to support a legitimate government \nsame restrictions on his speech at this year’s Festival,  interest for crowd control and safety. \nwhich  is  scheduled  for  June  18–20,  2010.  Finally,  Def. Ex. P., p. 36. Judge Edmunds also held that the \nPlaintiff seeks his reasonable attorney fees, costs, and  United States Supreme Court’s decision in Heffron v. \nexpenses pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.3 Plaintiff does not  Int’l Soc’y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. \nseek monetary damages.  640, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 69 L.Ed.2d 298 (1981), and the \n   Sixth  Circuit’s  decision  in  Spingola  v.

After the parties completed their briefing,  by Plaintiff. \nbut  before  oral  argument,  the  Court  issued  an  order  Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on July 7, 2009. \nrequiring Defendants to “designate ... where Plaintiff’s  The Amended Complaint contains four counts. The first \nbooth/table would be located at th[e] [2010 Festival].” See  count alleges a violation of Plaintiff’s First Amendment \ndocket  entry  55.  Defendants  responded,  stating  that  right to freedom of speech. The second count alleges a \nPlaintiff’s  booth/table  would  be  located  within  the  violation  of  Plaintiff’s  First  Amendment  right  to \n“Artesian Tent,” which, according to the map attached to  association.  The  third  count  alleges  a  violation  of \nDefendants’ submission, is centrally located within the  Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise his \ninner perimeter.

Br. 7. \n \n22 \n \n\n8  Haddad has extensive experience in law enforcement and, specifically, in crowd control. As he testified before Judge Edmunds: \nI’m in my 35th year of law enforcement.

I worked for Chrysler \n \nsecurity over their fire and security at three major plants for nine months, and I’ve been the 18th police chief for the City of \nDearborn since December 15th. \n* * * \nI was assigned in charge of Detroit’s east side, and that included the downtown area. Also, southwest Detroit was attached \nto it, and I had the occasion to be the commanding officer of the 11th Precinct for eight years during which time we did the \nMichigan State Fair for eight consecutive years. I was the task force commander there, as well. And the short answer is yes, \nI’ve been assigned many jobs for crowd control. \n* * * \nAnd I was also in charge of Homeland Security for six years as an added responsibility for the City of Detroit, and I oversaw \nall major special events. \nDef. Ex. P., pp. 18–19. \n \n9  In short, Plaintiff states that he wishes to reach Muslims who have “been [held] captive in their countries for years,” who have \npreviously “not [been] allowed to hear about Jesus Christ”; in other words, “the people that are afraid to walk to a Christian \n \nbooth.” Saieg Dep. at 96. \n \n10  The Court takes this opportunity to clarify precisely what rule/regulation is being subjected to constitutional scrutiny in this case. \nAgain, as discussed above, there is no written rule promulgated by the AACC banning all handbilling at the Festival. Instead, the \n \nwritten Festival rules ban “solicitation,” which, according to Beydoun, covers commercial handbilling only, and “political \nsolicitation.” These written rules are not at issue in this case because they are rules that are promulgated by a private \norganization and Dearborn Police Chief Haddad has never indicated that he and his officers will be enforcing them. Instead, \nHaddad indicated that he and his officers will be enforcing an “across the board” ban on all types of handbilling at the Festival, \nexcept for handbilling that occurs at designed booths. It is this “across the board” ban about which Plaintiff complains; it is \ntherefore the “across the board,” police enforced ban that is the subject of constitutional scrutiny. \nThus, the City has vowed to enforce a broad ban on handbilling in both the inner and outer perimeters of the Festival, except \nfor handbilling from a designated booth/table. Plaintiff complains about this police-enforced ban and, because Dearborn police \nofficers did (in 2009), and will (in 2010), enforce it, the First Amendment applies. \nThe Court finds that the public streets on which the Festival is held are “not serving in that function during the festival” see \nSpingola, 39 Fed.Appx. at 983, rather, they comprise part of a fairground. \n \n11  As noted in the background section, the AACC waived Plaintiff’s rental fee. \n \n \n12  During oral argument, counsel for Defendants indicated that the AACC would waive Plaintiff’s rental fee, as it did last year. \n \n \n13  Plaintiff also argues that the ban violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection for the same reason. \n \n \n14  Beydoun testified that only businesses along Warren Avenue were permitted to be sidewalk vendors: \nQ: Is there anybody other than the businesses [along Warren Avenue] who were the sidewalk vendors? \n \n* * * \nA: No. \nQ: So the sidewalk vendors are essentially the businesses along Warren Avenue? \nA: That is correct. \nBeydoun Dep. at 64–65. \n \n15  For the same reason, Plaintiff’s equal protection claim fails. The case upon which Plaintiff relies in support of his equal protection \nclaim, Mosley, is inapplicable. In Mosley, the Supreme Court held that a city ordinance prohibiting all picketing within 150 feet of \n \na school, except peaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute, violated the Equal Protection Clause because it \nmakes an impermissible distinction between peaceful labor picketing and other peaceful picketing. Id. at 94, 92 S.Ct. 2286. Here, \non the other hand, as explained, occupants along Warren Avenue are conferred the right to conduct sidewalk sales during the \nFestival because of their location alone, not because of a message, idea, or subject matter of speech espoused by the occupant. \n \n16  Plaintiff’s briefs contain repeated references to an outer perimeter that is “30 blocks” in size. This description is misleading \nbecause, as discussed, the outer perimeter runs only one block to the north and south of the inner perimeter and five and four \n \n23 \n \n\nblocks, respectively, to the west and east of the inner perimeter. \n \n \n24 \n ",

(R-1: Compl.).  The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n1331 and 1343.   \n  On July 7, 2009, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (R-13: Am. Compl.), \nwhich Defendants answered on August 12, 2009 (R-20: Answer). \n  After the close of discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  (R-30: Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. & Inj.; R-47: Defs.’ Opp’n; R-41: Defs.’ \nMot. for Summ. J.; R-50: Pl.’s Opp’n).   \nOn June 7, 2010, the court entered an opinion and order denying Plaintiff’s \nmotion for summary judgment, denying Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief, and \ngranting  Defendants’  motion  for  summary  judgment.    (R-57:  Op.  &  Order).  \nJudgment was subsequently entered in favor of Defendants.  (R-58: J.).   \nOn June 7, 2010, Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal (R-59: Notice of \nAppeal), seeking review of the district court’s opinion and order.  This court has \njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.   \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n  This case challenges Defendants’ unconstitutional restriction on Plaintiff’s \nright to distribute religious literature on the public streets, sidewalks, and other \n1 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 13\npublic areas in the City of Dearborn (“City”) during the Annual Dearborn Arab \nInternational Festival (“Arab Festival”).  Defendants’ restriction violates Plaintiff’s \nrights protected by the First Amendment (freedom of speech, right to expressive \nassociation, and free exercise of religion),1 and it deprives Plaintiff of the equal \nprotection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n  It is important to highlight that at no time has Plaintiff requested to engage \nin his religious activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road—the streets that are \nexclusively reserved for the Arab Festival.  Instead, he seeks only to peacefully \nexercise his constitutional rights on the adjacent public sidewalks, which remain \nopen  to  the  general  public  for  purposes  unrelated  to  the  Arab  Festival.  \nConsequently, these sidewalks continue to serve their function as public sidewalks.   \n  In addition to restricting Plaintiff’s First Amendment activity on the adjacent \npublic sidewalks, Defendants also created a broad prophylactic prohibition on the \ndistribution of literature that extends beyond the actual festival to include more \nthan 30 surrounding City blocks (“buffer zone” or “outer perimeter”) where no \nfestival activities take place.   \n  Defendants’  unconstitutional  restriction  prevents  Plaintiff  and  his  fellow \nChristian missionaries from expressing their religious beliefs, engaging in the free \n                                                 \n1 Contrary to the district court’s assertion and as demonstrated further in this brief, \nPlaintiff did not “abandon” his free exercise claim.  (See R-57: Op. & Order at 38 \n(stating that “the claim is deemed abandoned”)). \n2 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 14\nexercise of religion, and associating to further their religious beliefs in violation of \nthe Constitution. \n  In the final analysis, Defendants’ restriction on Plaintiff’s religious activity \ncannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.  Consequently, this court should reverse \nthe district court. \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES FOR REVIEW \n  I.  Whether the district court erred by denying Plaintiff injunctive relief, \ndenying  Plaintiff’s  motion  for  summary  judgment,  and  granting  Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment. \n  II.  Whether denying Plaintiff access to traditional public forums for the \npurpose of engaging in peaceful, non-obstructive, noncommercial religious speech \nthrough the distribution of literature violates Plaintiff’s constitutional rights.  \n  III.  Whether denying Plaintiff access to a traditional public forum for the \npurpose of engaging in peaceful, non-obstructive, noncommercial religious speech \nactivity, while permitting commercial speech and other commercial activity in the \nsame forum, violates Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. \n  IV.  Whether  Defendants’  broad,  prophylactic  restriction  on  Plaintiff’s \npeaceful, non-obstructive, noncommercial religious speech activity in traditional \npublic forums burdens more speech than is necessary to achieve the particular \ninterests of the government in violation of Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. \n3 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 15\n  V.  Whether Defendants are liable for violating Plaintiff’s constitutional \nrights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for selectively enforcing their restriction against \nPlaintiff’s religious speech activity. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  On  June  16,  2009,  Plaintiff  filed  this  action  against  Defendants.    (R-1: \nCompl.).    And  on  June  17,  2009,  Plaintiff  filed  an  emergency  motion  for  a \nTemporary Restraining Order (R-5: TRO Mot.), which was denied on June 18, \n2009 (R-7: Order denying TRO).2   \n  On July 7, 2009, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint.  In his amended \ncomplaint, Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as “nominal \nand compensatory damages for the harm caused by Defendants.”3  (R-13: Am. \nCompl. at ¶ 5).  Defendants answered on August 12, 2009.  (R-20: Answer). \n                                                 \n2 The 2009 Arab Festival took place on June 19 through 21, 2009. \n3  Arabic  Christian  Perspective  (“ACP”)  was  a  plaintiff  in  the  original  action; \nhowever, ACP board members voted to dissolve ACP in December 2009.  (R-30: \nSaieg  Decl.  at  ¶6  at  Ex.  1).    Consequently,  ACP,  which  had  the  claim  for \ncompensatory damages, was subsequently dismissed from this case on January 25, \n2010.  (R-26: Order Dismissing ACP).  Plaintiff Saieg’s claims for declaratory and \ninjunctive relief, as well as his claim for nominal damages, remain.  Thus, the \ndistrict court was incorrect when it stated that “Plaintiff does not seek monetary \ndamages,” (R-57: Op. & Order at 2), insofar as nominal damages are “monetary \ndamages.”  Indeed, Plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages for the past loss of his \nconstitutional rights as a matter of law.  See Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266-67 \n(1978);  Floyd  v.  Laws,  929  F.2d  1390  (9th  Cir.  1991)  (holding  that  nominal \ndamages  must  be  awarded  as  a  matter  of  law  upon  finding  a  constitutional \nviolation).   \n4 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 16\n  The parties engaged in discovery, and on March 15, 2010, Plaintiff filed a \nmotion for summary judgment and request for injunctive relief.  (R-30: Pl.’s Mot. \nfor Summ. J. & Inj.).  Plaintiff requested that the district court preliminarily enjoin \nthe enforcement of Defendants’ speech restriction so as to allow him to engage in \nhis speech activity during the 2010 Arab Festival, which was scheduled for June 18 \nthrough 20, 2010.  (R-30: Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. & Inj.).  Defendants opposed the \nmotion on April 16, 2010.  (R-47: Defs.’ Opp’n). \n  Previously,  on  April  9,  2010,  Defendants  filed  a  motion  for  summary \njudgment (R-41: Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J.), which Plaintiff opposed on April 23, \n2010 (R-50: Pl.’s Opp’n).   \nThe district court held a hearing on the motions on May 21, 2010.  And on \nJune 7, 2010, the court entered an opinion and order denying Plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment, denying Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief, and granting \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment.  (R-57: Op. & Order).  Judgment was \nsubsequently entered in favor of Defendants.  (R-58: J.).  That same day, Plaintiff \nfiled a timely notice of appeal (R-59: Notice of Appeal), seeking review of the \ndistrict court’s opinion and order.   \nOn June 8, 2010, Plaintiff filed with this court an emergency motion for \nexpedited review and reversal of the district court’s order denying his request for \ninjunctive relief so as to allow him to engage in his First Amendment activity \n5 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 17\npending this appeal.  On June 17, 2010, this court, finding that Plaintiff would \nlikely succeed on the merits of his appeal, granted Plaintiff’s request as follows: \n“During the hours that the Festival is open to the public on June 18, 19, and 20, \n2010, Saieg shall be permitted to distribute his religious literature in the streets \ncontained within the area referred to as the ‘outer perimeter’ or ‘buffer zone.’”  \n(Order, Doc. No. 006110657885, at 3; R-60: Order Granting Inj.).   \nThis appeal follows. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  Plaintiff’s Protected Speech Activity. \n  Plaintiff  is  the  founder  and  former  director  of  ACP,  a  national  ministry \nestablished for the purpose of proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Muslims.  \nPlaintiff is a Christian pastor with a deeply-held religious conviction to evangelize \nto non-Christians.  Accordingly, Plaintiff travels around the country with other \nChristians attending and distributing Christian literature at various festivals and \nmosques.  Because the City contains one of the largest Muslim communities in the \ncountry, it is an important location for Plaintiff’s religious activities.  (R-30: Saieg \nDecl. at ¶¶ 1-8 at Ex. 1).4 \n \n \n                                                 \n4 All of the relevant references are available electronically through the court’s \nelectronic filing system. \n6 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 18\nB.  The City’s Sponsorship of the Arab Festival. \nFor the past fifteen years, the City has sponsored the Arab Festival.5  (R-36: \nDep. Ex. 20 at Ex. 4; Dep. Ex. 22 at Ex. 6; R-37: Dep. Ex. 16 at Ex. 11; Dep. Ex. \n44  at  Ex.  12).    In  2009,  as  in  past  years,  organizers  requested  and  the  City \nauthorized the use of “Warren Avenue and Miller Road” for the festival.  (R-36: \nBeydoun Dep. at 25-27, 29-30 at Ex. 3; R-38: Dep. Ex. 24 at Ex. 15; Dep. Ex. 25 \nat  Ex.  16)  (emphasis  added).    On  May  4,  2009,  the  City  Council  granted \n“permission to conduct the [Arab Festival] from June 19 through June 21, 2009[,] \nsubject to all applicable ordinances and the rules and regulations of the Police \nDepartment.”  (R-36: Dep. Ex. 2 at Ex. 5 (emphasis added); R-37: Haddad Dep. at \n21, 51-52 at Ex. 9).  The City Council approved “the festival boundaries” in the \nCity as follows: “Warren Avenue between Hartwell and Kingsley Streets; Miller \nRoad between Warren Avenue and Blesser Street.”  (R-36: Dep. Ex. 2 at Ex. 5) \n(emphasis added).  Accordingly, the 2009 Arab Festival took place on Warren \nAvenue, with a few activities held on Miller Road. (R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 29, 42 \nat Ex. 3; Mrowka Dep. at 15-18 at Ex. 7; R-38: Dep. Ex. 3 at Ex. 17; Tr. at 27 at \nEx.  18).    The  City  erected  barriers  to  separate  the  festival  from  the  public \n                                                 \n5 The City provides its services at no cost to the Arab Festival, (R-36: Beydoun 22-\n23, 44-46, 96-97 at Ex. 3; Dep. Ex. 20 at Ex. 4; Dep. Ex. 2 at Ex. 5; Dep. Ex. 22 at \nEx. 6), even though the City’s ordinance requires a sponsor of a special event \nreceiving City services to enter into a contract to repay the cost for those services, \n(R-36: Morello Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. C (“Special Events” ordinance ) at Ex. 2). \n7 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 19\nsidewalks.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶ 19, Ex. B at Ex. 1; R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 73-\n74 at Ex. 3). \nThe Arab Festival is open to the general public; there is no admission fee \nrequired.  (R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 74 at Ex. 7).  Pedestrians have free access to the \nfestival and the surrounding areas (R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 74-75 at Ex. 7), and the \nCity ensures pedestrian access to the local Warren Avenue businesses that do not \nwant to participate in the festival (R-37: Haddad Dep. at 16-18 at Ex. 9; R-36: \nMrowka Dep. at 69-72 at Ex. 7; R-38: Tr. 19-20, 22-23, 26-27 at Ex. 18).  In fact, \nthe  City  created  special  parking  areas  that  were  open  to  persons  who  had  no \ninterest in the festival, but who wanted to have access to these businesses.  (R-36: \nMrowka Dep. at 69-72 at Ex. 7).  Unlike Warren Avenue and parts of Miller Road, \nthe public sidewalks adjacent to these streets were not used exclusively for the \nArab Festival.  Consequently, these sidewalks maintained their principle function \nas public sidewalks.6  Indeed, as noted previously, the City ensured that this was \nthe case by erecting barriers between the public sidewalks and the actual festival \nactivities taking place on Warren Avenue.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶ 19, Ex. B at Ex. \n1; R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 73-74 at Ex. 3). \n \n                                                 \n6 The fact that a “street vendor” may obtain a permit to sell his wares on a public \nsidewalk does not transform that sidewalk into something else. \n8 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 20\nC.  Defendants’  First  Amendment-Free  Zone:  the  “Inner”  and \n“Outer” Perimeters. \n \nDuring the 2009 Arab Festival, the City closed off two areas to vehicle (not \npedestrian)  traffic,  creating  two  areas—the  “inner  perimeter”  and  the  “outer \nperimeter.”  (R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 9-11 at Ex. 7).  These same areas will be \nclosed off for future festivals.  (R-37: Haddad Dep. at 99-100 at Ex. 9).   \nThe “inner perimeter” contained the actual festival activities, and its borders \nran east to west along Warren Avenue and a block south along Miller Road.  The \n“outer perimeter,” which contained no festival activities, included Morrow Circle \nto the north (running east to west), Blesser Street to the south (running east to \nwest), Wyoming to the east (running north to south), and Schaeffer to the west \n(running north to south).  (R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 11-18 at Ex. 7; R-38: Dep. Ex. \n29 at Ex. 19 (Map of the Perimeter Areas); R-30, R-31: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21, \nEx. C, at Ex. 1).  The “outer perimeter” was established to address vehicle traffic.  \n(R-41: Haddad Dep. at 26-27 at Defs.’ Ex. K) (“They’re set up strategically to give \ntraffic  some  final  point  to  turn  away  from  the  Warren  Avenue  Destination.”) \n(emphasis added)).   \nThe total area that is closed off in the City for Plaintiff’s speech activity is in \nexcess of 30 City blocks.7   \n                                                 \n7 The Arab Festival occupies approximately 12 City blocks along Warren Avenue.  \nThe “perimeter” area extends a block to the north and a block to the south (for a \n9 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 21\nD.  Defendants’ Enforcement of the Challenged Speech Restriction. \nCity  police  officers  would  not  permit  Plaintiff  to  distribute  his  religious \nliterature in either the “inner perimeter” or the “outer perimeter” areas during the \nArab Festival.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 20-21 at Ex. 1; R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 18, \n32-33 at Ex. 7; R-37: Haddad Dep. at 99-100 at Ex. 9; R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 55, \n77 at Ex. 3).  If Plaintiff did engage in such speech activity, he was subject to \narrest.  (R-37: Haddad Dep. at 70-72 at Ex. 9).  Defendants enforced this restriction \ndespite the fact that the City ordinance dealing with the distribution of handbills \nexpressly states, “It shall not be unlawful for any person to hand out or distribute, \nwithout charge to the receiver thereof, any noncommercial handbill in any public \nplace to any person willing to accept such noncommercial handbill.”  (R-36: \nMorello  Decl.  at  ¶  2,  Ex.  A  (“Distribution  of  Handbills”  ordinance)  at  Ex.  2) \n(emphasis added). \nE.  Defendants’ Favored Treatment of Commercial Speech. \nThe  City  made  special  provisions  to  accommodate  the  businesses  along \nWarren Avenue to ensure that the public sidewalks remained open for commercial \n                                                                                                                                                             \ntotal of 24 City blocks) and approximately 5 blocks to the west and 4 blocks to the \neast for a grand total of 33 City blocks.  (R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 11-18 at Ex. 7; R-\n38: Dep. Ex. 29 at Ex. 19 compare R-57: Op. & Order at 35, n. 16 (affirming the \nsize of the boundaries, but apparently refuting the math, claiming that Plaintiff’s \nreference to “30 blocks” is “misleading”)).  Plaintiff is prohibited from distributing \nhis literature on the public sidewalks and public streets within the entire (“inner” \nand “outer”) perimeter area. \n10 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 22\nactivity unrelated to the festival.  (R-38: Tr. at 26-27, 29 at Ex. 18; R-37: Haddad \nDep. at 16-18 at Ex. 9).  Defendant Haddad testified as follows: \nQ:  You  indicated  you  had  some  communications  with  the  Warren \nbusinesses, is that right, sir? \nA:  That’s correct. \nQ:  And they indicated to you that they had a serious concern about \nmaking sure that the public sidewalks are open for their business \npatrons, is that right? \nA:  That’s correct. \nQ:  And these would be business patrons who perhaps might not have \nany interest at all in the festival but want to attend that business for \nbusiness purposes, is that right? \nA:  Any interest in anything else going on on Warren was the actual \nconcern. \nQ:  So it might not even be people associated with the festival, but \npeople who just want to, that afternoon, they want to go down to \nwhatever business is open, like they have done in the past, and they \nwant to make sure they can get in and out of that business and \nhave nothing to do with the festival, is that right, sir? \nA:  That’s right. \nQ:  And the City is doing everything it can to accommodate those \nbusiness interests to make sure those sidewalks are open, is that \nright? \nA:  We’re going to do our best. \n \n(R-38: Tr. at 26-27 at Ex. 18 (emphasis added); see also R-38: Tr. at 29 at Ex. 18). \n \n* * * * \nQ:  Did you explain to [the businesses] that you were going to take any \nsteps or measures to accommodate their concerns? \nA: I  just  advised  them  that  we’d  do  our  very  best  to  keep  the \nsidewalks open. \nQ: And how were you going to do that? \nA: Have patrol on the sidewalks, officers walking up and down. \nQ: What  were  the  things  that  these  police  officers  patrolling  the \nsidewalks, that they would be looking for to ensure that you were \naccommodating the businesses’ needs? \n11 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 23\nA:  Just make sure that sidewalks stayed open, nobody was unduly \nstanding around in places that weren’t designed for that. \nQ: How about with regard to people distributing literature or other \nmaterials on the sidewalk? \nA: That was not going to be permitted. \n \n(R-37: Haddad 16-18 at Ex. 9) (emphasis added). \nIn  addition,  the  City  authorized  the  festival  organizers  to  issue  special \nsidewalk vending permits, at no charge, to the businesses along Warren Avenue.8  \n(R-36:  Beydoun  Dep.  at  34,  64-66,  72-73,  82-83  at  Ex.  3).    This  commercial \nactivity  was  permitted  even  though  it  caused  traffic  problems  at  prior  Arab \nFestivals, (R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 34-35 at Ex. 3; Mrowka Dep. at 21-22 at Ex. 7; \nR-37: Dep. Ex. 36 at Ex. 13), including the 2009 Arab Festival (R-30, R-31, R-32, \nR-33: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 25-26, Exs. D, E at Ex. 1).  And these special “permits” \nwere provided to persons who owned a business along Warren Avenue.  (R-36: \nBeydoun Dep. at 90-91 at Ex. 3; R-38: Dep. Ex. 42 at Ex. 14).  Ms. Beydoun, the \nfestival organizer, testified as follows: \nQ:  And the individuals listed on [Dep. Ex. 42], they’re actually the \n  businesses where the sidewalk vendor is; isn’t that right? \n                                                 \n8 In their application, festival organizers requested that the City issue the sidewalk \npermits, per the City’s ordinance.  (R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 31 at Ex. 3; R-38: Dep. \nEx. 24 at Ex. 15; R-36: Morello Decl. at ¶ 3, Ex. B (“Street Vendors” ordinance) at \nEx. 2).  However, not wanting to deal with the additional administrative burdens, \nthe City took the unprecedented step of granting the authority it retains under its \n“Street Vendors” ordinance to the festival organizers.  Nonetheless, the individual \nvendors still had to receive final City approval for their displays.  (R-36: Beydoun \nDep. at 66-69 at Ex. 3). \n12 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 24\nA:  The business owner was permitted to put things on the sidewalk \n  and that’s why you think it’s called sidewalk vendor.  But it’s \n  actually the business owner that’s allowed to set up right in \n  front of their store. \nQ:  And they’re the only ones that are allowed on their sidewalks, \n  correct? \nA:   That’s correct. \n \n(R-36: Beydoun Dep. at 90-91 at Ex. 3 (emphasis added); R-38: Dep. Ex. 42 at Ex. \n14). \nF.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activities During the Arab Festival. \nDuring the five years prior to 2009 (2004 to 2008), Plaintiff and his fellow \nChristians visited the City during the Arab Festival to evangelize and distribute \ntheir religious materials.  During each of these prior years, they freely roamed the \nperimeter of the festival, including the public sidewalks adjacent to the festival \n(“inner perimeter”) and the public streets and sidewalks immediately surrounding \nthe festival (“outer perimeter”), handing out religious literature and discussing their \nChristian faith.  During these prior visits, City officials directed Plaintiff and his \nassociates to distribute their religious materials on the public sidewalks adjacent to \nthe festival and not to distribute them on the road where the festival activities were \ntaking place.  Plaintiff complied with this direction and received approval from \nCity police officers to distribute his religious materials accordingly.  During these \nprior visits, Plaintiff and his associates never caused any disruption, nor did they \n13 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 25\never block or obstruct pedestrian traffic.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 9-10 at Ex. 1; R-\n36: Mrowka Dep. at 24 at Ex. 7).  \nPlaintiff’s religious literature and materials do not contain solicitations, nor \ndo they contain commercial speech.  Plaintiff and his associates distribute their \nreligious materials at no charge to those who are willing to accept them.  (R-30: \nSaieg Decl. at ¶ 23, Ex. A at Ex. 1 compare R-38: Dep. Ex. 26 at Ex. 21; see also \nR-36: Morello Decl. at ¶ 2, Ex. A at Ex. 2).  The distribution of Plaintiff’s religious \nmaterials does not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the message; \ninstead,  the  recipient  is  free  to  read  and  view  the  message  at  a  later  time.  \nConsequently, Plaintiff’s literature distribution does not entail the same kind of \nproblems presented by face-to-face solicitations or sales, such as those permitted \nby Defendants during the 2009 Arab Festival.  (R-30, R-31, R-32, R-33, R-35: \nSaieg Decl. at ¶¶ 14, 25-26, 29, 40, 41, Exs. D, E, I at Ex. 1). \nPlaintiff  does  not  want  to  participate  in  the  Arab  Festival;  he  wants  to \nevangelize the people who come to Warren Avenue during the festival.  In 2009, \nDefendants prohibited him from doing so and required him to remain at a fixed \nlocation as a festival participant.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 33-40 at Ex. 1). \nG.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activities During the 2009 Arab Festival. \n \nIn 2009, Plaintiff planned to visit the City every day of the Arab Festival to \ndistribute  religious  literature  and  to  evangelize.    Prior  to  arriving  in  the  City, \n14 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 26\nPlaintiff telephoned the City Police Department and spoke to Sgt. Jeff Mrowka.  \nDuring this call, Plaintiff introduced himself and his organization, informed the \npolice of his intention to visit the City during the festival to distribute religious \nliterature  and  evangelize,  and  requested  information  concerning  the  precise \nlocation of the event.  Sgt. Mrowka said he would call Plaintiff back with the \ninformation.  During this subsequent conversation, Sgt. Mrowka advised Plaintiff \nof  the  festival’s  location,  that  Plaintiff  would  be  restricted  to  a  fixed  location \nwithin  the  festival,  and  that  Plaintiff  would  not  be  allowed  to  use  the  public \nsidewalks to distribute his literature.  Plaintiff objected.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ \n11-15 at Ex. 1; R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 20 at Ex. 7). \nDuring the festival, Plaintiff’s literature distribution was restricted to a fixed \ntent location on Warren Avenue per Sgt. Mrowka’s order.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ \n33-34 at Ex. 1; R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 27-30 at Ex. 7).  Because this location was \nnear  the  festival  rides,  the  people  who  came  to  Plaintiff’s  tent  were  mostly \nchildren.  Evangelizing adult Muslims is made more difficult if Muslim children \nreceive materials from Christians because the adult Muslims get angry when this \nhappens.  Moreover, the majority of the people attending the festival congregated \naround the stage that was located on the far opposite side from where Plaintiff was \nlocated.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 35-38 at Ex. 1). \n15 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 27\nIt  is  very  difficult  to  evangelize  Muslims  from  a  fixed  location  without \ninviting attention to the individuals visiting the tent.  Because Islamic law provides \nfor severe penalties, including death, for converting to Christianity, such attention \nis  naturally  undesirable  to  anyone  wishing  to  hear  Plaintiff’s  message.    The \nMuslims who do approach will inevitably be watched by family, neighbors, and \nfriends,  subjecting  themselves  to  possible  ridicule,  scorn,  and  punishment.  \nConsequently, Muslims who are interested in Christianity are typically not willing \nto go to and be seen at a location that is known to be occupied by Christians.  \nPlaintiff experienced this difficulty in 2009.  To reach his intended audience, it is \nessential for Plaintiff to be able to distribute his religious materials on the public \nsidewalks and in other public places where the exchange between him and the \nperson he is evangelizing is more personal and confidential.  This method allows \nthe person receiving the materials to do so discreetly and to view them later in \nprivate.  (R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 38-40 at Ex. 1). \nDuring prior Arab Festivals in which Plaintiff was permitted to distribute his \nreligious literature on the public sidewalks, Plaintiff was able to reach significant \nnumbers  of  people  with  his  message.    In  2007,  Plaintiff  and  his  associates \ndistributed approximately 37,000 packets of religious materials, and in 2008, they \ndistributed approximately 20,000.  From the fixed location in 2009, Plaintiff and \nhis  associates  distributed  approximately  500  packets,  thereby  significantly \n16 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 28\ndiminishing  their  ability  to  express  their  message  and  reach  their  intended \naudience.  (R-30, R-35: Saieg Decl. at ¶ 41, Ex. L at Ex. 1). \nH.  Defendants’ Disfavored Treatment of Plaintiff’s Speech. \n  The testimonial and photographic evidence shows that Defendants did not \nenforce their speech restriction in an even-handed manner.  As Plaintiff testified in \nhis sworn declaration: \nEven  though  my  fellow  Christians  and  I  were  prohibited  from \ndistributing our religious literature on the adjacent and surrounding \npublic streets and sidewalks during the Festival, certain individuals \nunrelated to us and our Christian outreach were not so prohibited.  In \nfact, some individuals were distributing literature within the Festival \nitself on Warren Avenue and the City police did not stop them. . . .  It \nwas  evident  to  me  based  on  my personal  experience  and  personal \nobservations  during  the  2009  Festival  that  the  City  police  officers \nwere  discriminating  against  the  Christian  evangelists  in  the \nenforcement  of  the  City’s  speech  restrictions.    They  allowed  non-\nChristians  to  distribute  literature  on  the  sidewalks  and  on  Warren \nAvenue  in  plain  view  of  the  police  officers  and  Festival  security \nguards, most of whom appeared to be Muslims, but prohibited me and \nmy  fellow  Christians  from  distributing  literature  anywhere  in  the \npublic areas within the “inner perimeter” and the “outer perimeter.”  \nThe Muslim security guards were constantly watching over us in an \nobvious effort to intimidate us.  The City police officers allowed this \nto happen, and when there was a complaint, the City police officers \nwould side with the Muslim security guards. \n \n(R-30, R-34: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 27, 28, 31, (emphasis added), Exs. F, G, H at Ex. 1; \nsee also R-36: Mrowka Dep. at 47-50 at Ex. 7; Dep. Ex. 32 at Ex. 8). \n17 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 29\nPlaintiff  wants  to  visit  the  City  during  future  festivals  to  engage  in  his \nspeech activities.  However, he is deterred from doing so by the threat of arrest.  \n(R-30: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 44-45 at Ex. 1). \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nPlaintiff desires to distribute religious literature in traditional public forums \nin the City during the Arab Festival.   The public streets and sidewalks where \nPlaintiff wants to distribute his religious literature are not properly part of the \n“fairgrounds.”  These areas are open to the general public and pedestrian traffic \nthat is wholly unrelated to the festival.  Consequently, these sidewalks continue to \nserve their function as public sidewalks.  And based on controlling U.S. Supreme \nCourt precedent, one who is rightfully on a street or sidewalk that the state has left \nopen to the public carries with him there and elsewhere the right to express his \nviews  in  an  orderly  fashion  through  the  distribution  of  literature.    Indeed,  the \npublic sidewalks are natural and proper places for the dissemination of information \nand opinion, and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in \nappropriate places abridged on the plea that it can be exercised elsewhere. \nHere, Defendants do not have a compelling reason for completely banning \nPlaintiff’s form of protected expression on the City’s public sidewalks and streets, \nwhich are properly considered traditional public forums. \n18 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 30\nMoreover,  Defendants’  speech  restriction  is  not  a  content-neutral,  time, \nplace,  and  manner  restriction.    First,  Defendants’  restriction  is  content-based \nbecause it prefers commercial activity (and commercial speech) over Plaintiff’s \nnoncommercial speech.  Second, Defendants’ speech restriction, and in particular \nthe restriction on Plaintiff’s speech within the “outer perimeter” or “buffer zone,” \nburdens  substantially  more  speech  than  is  necessary  to  further  Defendants’ \ninterests.  Third, because Defendants are so willing to disregard the traffic and \ncrowd control problems associated with the commercial activity permitted on the \nvery  sidewalks  that  are  closed  for  Plaintiff’s  non-obstructive  religious  speech, \nDefendants’ interests in restricting Plaintiff’s speech are not substantial.  Finally, \nDefendants’  speech  restriction  is  constitutionally  inadequate  because  Plaintiff’s \nability to communicate effectively is threatened in that the remaining modes of \ncommunication are inadequate. \nIn  sum,  Defendants’  speech  restriction,  for  which  the  City  is  liable  for \nenforcing, operates to violate Plaintiff’s rights to freedom of speech, freedom of \nexpressive association, and the free exercise of religion, and it deprives Plaintiff of \nthe  equal  protection  of  the  law,  all  in  violation  of  the  First  and  Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution. \n \n \n19 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 31\nARGUMENT \nI.  STANDARD OF REVIEW. \n \n  This court reviews the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.  \nWatkins v. City of Battle Creek, 273 F.3d 682, 685 (6th Cir. 2001).  It may affirm \nonly if the record, read in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, reveals no genuine \nissues of material fact and shows that Defendants were entitled to judgment as a \nmatter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  Upon its review of the record, this court must \nconsider  the  evidence  and  draw  all  reasonable  inferences  in  favor  of  Plaintiff.  \nSiggers-El v. Barlow, 412 F.3d 693, 699 (6th Cir. 2005).   \nAdditionally, because this case implicates First Amendment rights, this court \nmust closely scrutinize the record, without deference to the district court.  Hurley \nv. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557, 567 \n(1995) (requiring courts to “conduct an independent examination of the record as a \nwhole,  without  deference  to  the  trial  court”  in  cases  involving  the  First \nAmendment); see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 \nU.S.  485,  499  (1984)  (noting  that  in  cases  raising  First  Amendment  issues \nappellate courts must make an independent examination of the whole record). \nII.  DEFENDANTS’ SPEECH RESTRICTION VIOLATES PLAINTIFF’S \nRIGHTS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. \n \n  Whether Defendants’ speech restriction violates Plaintiff’s right to freedom \nof speech is examined in essentially three steps.  First, the court must determine \n20 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 32\nwhether  the  speech  in  question—the  distribution  of  religious  literature—is \nprotected  speech.    Second,  the  court  must  conduct  a  forum  analysis  as  to  the \nprecise forum in question to determine the proper constitutional standard to apply.  \nAnd third, the court must then determine whether Defendants’ speech restriction \ncomports with the applicable standard.  Parks v. City of Columbus, 395 F.3d 643, \n647 (6th Cir. 2005) (setting forth three-part analysis).  Upon completion of this \nanalysis,  it  is  evident  that  Defendants’  speech  restriction  cannot  withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny. \nA.  Plaintiff’s Speech Activity Is Protected by the First Amendment. \n \n  The First Amendment is made applicable to the States and their political \nsubdivisions through the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Cantwell v. Connecticut, \n310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940).  There is no dispute that the First Amendment protects \nPlaintiff’s right to publicly express his religious beliefs through the distribution of \nliterature.  Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444, 452 (1938) (holding that the First \nAmendment  protects  literature  distribution);  Jamison  v.  Texas,  318  U.S.  413 \n(1943) (same); Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943) (same).  Indeed, \n“spreading one’s religious beliefs” and “preaching the Gospel” are constitutionally \nprotected activities.  Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105, 110 (1943); Capitol \nSquare  Rev.  &  Adv.  Bd.  v.  Pinette,  515  U.S.  753,  760  (1995)  (“[Religious \nexpression] is as fully protected under the Free Speech Clause as secular private \n21 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 33\nexpression.”).  Accordingly, the First Amendment’s Free Speech and Free Exercise \nClauses  protect  Plaintiff’s  “religious  proselytizing.”    See  Board  of  Educ.  v. \nMergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250 (1990) (O’Connor, J.) (observing that “private speech \nendorsing religion” is protected by “the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses”); \n(see also R-30: Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. & Inj. at 11). \nB.  All  Streets  and  Sidewalks  Are  Traditional  Public  Forums, \nIncluding the Public Streets and Sidewalks in the City that Are \nOpen to the General Public. \n \nThe Supreme Court adopted “a forum analysis as a means of determining \nwhen the Government’s interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended \npurpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for [expressive] \npurposes.”  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 800 \n(1985).  This analysis traditionally divides public property into three categories: \ntraditional public forums, designated public forums, and nonpublic forums.  Id.  \nTraditional public forums include streets and sidewalks.  See Hague v. CIO, 307 \nU.S. 496, 515 (1939).  Restrictions on speech in traditional public forums are \nsharply  limited.    See  American-Arab  Anti-Discrimination  Comm.  v.  City  of \nDearborn, 418 F.3d 600, 605 (6th Cir. 2005) (striking down city ordinance and \nstating,  “Constitutional  concerns  are  heightened  further  where,  as  here,  the \n[challenged  ordinance]  restricts  the  public’s  use  of  streets  and  sidewalks  for \npolitical speech”).   \n22 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 34\nAs  the  Supreme  Court  emphasized,  “[O]ur  decisions  identifying  public \nstreets and sidewalks as traditional public fora are not accidental invocations of a \n‘cliché,’ but recognition that wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they \nhave immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public.  No particularized \ninquiry into the precise nature of a specific street is necessary; all public streets are \nheld in the public trust and are properly considered traditional public fora.”  Frisby \nv. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 480-81 (1988) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  \nIndeed,  “the  streets  are  natural  and  proper  places  for  the  dissemination  of \ninformation and opinion; and one is not to have the exercise of his liberty of \nexpression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in \nsome other place.”  Schneider v. New Jersey, 308 U.S. 147, 163 (1939).   \nThe City streets and sidewalks within the “inner perimeter” and the “outer \nperimeter” are no different.  For example, in Parks v. City of Columbus, 395 F.3d \n643, 652 (6th Cir. 2005), this court struck down a restriction on the plaintiff’s right \nto distribute religious literature on the streets of Columbus, Ohio, during a festival, \nholding that the “streets remained a traditional public forum notwithstanding the \nspecial  permit  that  was  issued  to  the  Arts  Council”  to  use  the  streets  for  the \nColumbus Arts Festival, which was open to the public. \nMoreover, contrary to the district court’s imprecise conclusion (see R-57: \nOp. & Order at 23, n. 10 (quoting Spingola v. Village of Granville, 39 Fed. Appx. \n23 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 35\n978, 983 (6th Cir. 2002), and finding “that the public streets on which the Festival \nis  held  are  ‘not  serving  in  that  function  during  the  festival,’  .  .  .  rather,  they \ncomprise part of a fairground”)),9 the public sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue \nand Miller Road were not part of the “fairgrounds.”  Instead, they maintained their \n“function” as public sidewalks.  Thus, it was error to include these sidewalks with \n“the public streets on which the Festival is held” for purposes of Plaintiff’s free \nspeech claim.  Indeed, identifying the precise forum is a crucial aspect of the First \nAmendment forum analysis.  As the Supreme Court stated,  \n[F]orum  analysis  is  not  completed  merely  by  identifying  the \ngovernment property at issue.  Rather, in defining the forum we have \nfocused on the access sought by the speaker.  When speakers seek \ngeneral  access  to  public  property,  the  forum  encompasses  that \nproperty.  In cases in which limited access is sought, our cases have \ntaken a more tailored approach to ascertaining the perimeters of a \nforum within the confines of the government property. \n \nCornelius, 473 U.S. at 801 (emphasis added) (finding that the Combined \nFederal Campaign charity drive rather than the federal workplace was the relevant \nforum).   \nIn this case, Plaintiff only seeks access to the public sidewalks adjacent to \nWarren Avenue and Miller Road and the public sidewalks, streets, and other public \nareas within the “outer perimeter.”  Thus, it is imprecise (and incorrect as a matter \nof law) to lump these adjacent public areas and the City streets where the actual \n                                                 \n9 Indeed, as discussed infra, the district court’s reliance on Spingola v. Village of \nGranville, 39 Fed. Appx. 978, 983 (6th Cir. 2002), is wholly misplaced. \n24 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 36\nfestival activities take place (Warren Avenue and Miller Road) into one forum in \nthe court’s forum analysis, as the district court did below. \n  C.  Defendants’ Speech Restriction Cannot Withstand Constitutional  \n    Scrutiny. \n \n1.  Defendants’  Complete  Ban  on  Distributing  Religious \nLiterature in Traditional Public Forums Violates the First \nAmendment. \n \nIn Jamison v. Texas, 318 U.S. 413 (1943), the Court stated, “[O]ne who is \nrightfully on a street which the state has left open to the public carries with him \nthere  as  elsewhere  the  constitutional  right  to  express  his  views  in  an  orderly \nfashion.  This right extends to the communication of ideas by handbills and \nliterature as well as by the spoken word.”  Id. at 416 (emphasis added); see also \nMartin,  319  U.S.  at  145-49  (invalidating  a  ban  on  literature  distribution  and \nstating, “Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever he desires to \nreceive it is so clearly vital to the preservation of a free society that . . . it must be \nfully preserved”). \nThere is no dispute that Defendants “may provide for control of travel on \ntheir streets in order to insure the safety and convenience of the traveling public” \nand thus “may punish conduct on the streets which is in violation of a valid law,” \nsuch as a City ordinance against littering, obstructing travel, disorderly conduct, or \ndisturbing the peace.  Jamison, 318 U.S. at 416.  But the Constitution does not \nallow Defendants to completely ban Plaintiff’s distribution of religious literature \n25 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 37\non public sidewalks that are open to the general public, as they have done here.10  \nJamison, 318 U.S. at 416.   \nIn this case, Defendants ensure that the public sidewalks leading into and \nimmediately adjacent to Warren Avenue (“inner perimeter” and “outer perimeter”), \nas well as nearby parking lots located on Oakman Boulevard (“outer perimeter”), \nremain open for commercial traffic and activity unrelated to the festival.  Thus, all \nof the public sidewalks in the City remain open to the general public for travel and \nactivity unrelated to the festival—that is, these public sidewalks are serving in \ntheir ordinary function as sidewalks.11  Yet, these areas—and the persons using \nthem—are  deemed  off  limits  for  Plaintiff  to  express  his  views  through  the \ndistribution of religious literature in violation of the Constitution.  Jamison, 318 \nU.S. at 416.  Indeed, speech restrictions that impose “an absolute prohibition on a \nparticular type of expression” in a public forum, as here, “will be upheld only if \nnarrowly drawn to accomplish a compelling governmental interest.”  United States \nv. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177 (1983) (citing cases) (emphasis added); Schad v. \nMount  Ephraim,  452  U.S.  61,  67  (1981)  (“[E]xclusion  of  a  broad  category  of \nprotected expression [demands heightened scrutiny].”).  Defendants have no such \n                                                 \n10 Consequently, the district court’s conclusion that Jamison v. Texas and other \nrelated cases do not apply here is incorrect.  (See R-57: Op. & Order at 24). \n11 The same cannot be said for Warren Avenue and parts of Miller Road—the areas \nused exclusively for festival activities—but Plaintiff is not seeking access to these \nareas. \n26 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 38\ncompelling interest.  Therefore, the restriction is unconstitutional as a matter of \nlaw. \n2.  The Speech Restriction Is Content-Based in Violation of the \nFirst Amendment. \n \nContent-based speech restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny.  Cornelius, \n473 U.S. at 802 (“[S]peakers can be excluded from a public forum only when the \nexclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclusion is \nnarrowly  drawn  to  achieve  that  interest.”).    They  “are  presumptively \nunconstitutional.”  S.O.C., Inc. v. County of Clark, 152 F.3d 1136, 1145 (9th Cir. \n1998).  And speech restrictions that discriminate between commercial speech and \nnoncommercial speech are content-based.  Id. at 1145; see generally Metromedia, \nInc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding unconstitutional a city \nordinance prohibiting outdoor advertising because it discriminated on the basis of \ncontent  by  permitting  on-site  commercial  speech  while  broadly  prohibiting \nnoncommercial messages) (White, J., plurality opinion).   \nIn  this  case,  Defendants  permit  the  local  businesses—and  no  one  else, \nincluding Plaintiff—to engage in commercial speech (advertising) and commercial \nactivities (distributing items for sale) on the public sidewalks immediately adjacent \nto Warren Avenue during the festival—at no cost, no less.  As the undisputed \nevidence shows, the crowd control, traffic, and safety issues associated with this \ncommercial  activity  far  exceed  those  associated  with  individuals  distributing \n27 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 39\n(albeit contrary to Defendants’ speech restrictions) noncommercial materials in this \nsame forum.  (See R-30, R-31, R-32, R-33, R-34, R-35: Saieg Decl. at ¶¶ 26-29, \nExs. D, E, F, G, H, I at Ex. 1). \nMoreover, to claim, as the district court did below, that the application of \nthis restriction does not discriminate on the basis of content because Plaintiff, an \nitinerant Christian missionary, could purchase a business along Warren Avenue \nand then set up a table to sell whatever he sold in his store is, quite frankly, \nnonsense.  (See R-57: Op. & Order at 30-31).  As the record reveals, the City and \nthe festival organizers had concerns about congestion on the sidewalks during prior \nArab Festivals, and the main source of that congestion was the sidewalk vendors—\nthat is, those persons who had commercial establishments along Warren Avenue.  \nHowever, Defendants permitted the sidewalks to be used for these exceedingly \nobstructive  commercial  sales,  but  prohibited  non-obstructive,  noncommercial \nactivity, such as Plaintiff’s distribution of religious literature, in this same forum.  \nThus, it is obvious what is going on here: the City is quite purposefully banning \nChristian missionaries from distributing religious literature at an Arab (Muslim) \nfestival.12  This is a content-based restriction.   \n                                                 \n12 As the evidence shows without contradiction, distributing religious literature at \nthe Arab Festival is the most effective way for Christians to evangelize Muslims \nattending this event.  There can be little doubt then as to why Defendants have \nimposed  such  draconian  measures  to  prohibit  this  effective  form  of  peaceful \nreligious expression. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 40\nAs the Supreme Court stated in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993), “Official action that targets religious \nconduct for distinctive treatment cannot be shielded by mere compliance with the \nrequirement of facial neutrality.”  Here, “mere compliance” with facial neutrality \ndoes  not  shield  the  actual  and  intended  effect  of  Defendants’  restriction: \nprohibiting Christian missionaries from handing out religious literature at the Arab \nFestival.    Such  “practical”  effects  are  “still  within  the  prohibition  of  the \nConstitution.”13 \nIn International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, \n690 (1992), Justice O’Connor, whose concurring opinion provided the narrowest \ngrounds for the decision upholding the ban on solicitation and striking down the \nban on leafleting in a nonpublic forum, stated the following: \nWhile the difficulties posed by solicitation in a nonpublic forum are \nsufficiently obvious that its regulation may ring of common-sense, the \n                                                 \n13 In the famous case of Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), the Court held \nthat  a  law  which  eliminated  the  use  of  wooden  buildings  for  hand  laundries \nviolated the Constitution in its administration when all Chinese persons owning \nsuch  laundries  were  forced  to  give  up  their  businesses  while  all  non-oriental \npersons  who  had  similar  laundries  were  not.    In  reaching  its  conclusion,  the \nSupreme Court stated,  \nThough the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, \nyet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil \neye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal \ndiscriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to \ntheir rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of \nthe Constitution. \nId. at 373-74 (emphasis added). \n29 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 41\nsame is not necessarily true of leafletting.  To the contrary, we have \nexpressly  noted  that  leafletting  does  not  entail  the  same  kinds  of \nproblems  presented  by  face-to-face  solicitation.    Specifically,  one \nneed  not  ponder  the  contents  of  a  leaflet  or  pamphlet  in  order \nmechanically to take it out of someone’s hand.  The distribution of \nliterature does not require that the recipient stop in order to receive the \nmessage the speaker wishes to convey; instead the recipient is free to \nread the message at a later time.   \n \nId.  at  690  (O’Connor,  J.,  concurring)  (internal  quotations,  citations,  and \npunctuation omitted). \n  In Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U.S. \n640 (1981), Justice Blackmun made the following relevant observation: \nI think that commonsense differences between literature distribution, \non the one hand, and solicitation and sales, on the other, suggest that \nthe latter activities present greater crowd control problems than the \nformer.    The  distribution  of  literature  does  not  require  that  the \nrecipient stop in order to receive the message the speaker wishes to \nconvey; instead, the recipient is free to read the message at a later \ntime. . . .  In contrast, . . . sales and the collection of solicited funds \nnot  only  require  the  fairgoer  to  stop,  but  also  engender  additional \nconfusion because they involve acts of exchanging articles for money, \nfumbling for and dropping money, making change, etc. \n \nId. at 665 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (internal citations and punctuation omitted). \n  Here,  there  is  no  legitimate—let  alone  compelling—reason  for  allowing \nbusinesses to engage in commercial activity on the public sidewalks adjacent to the \nfestival while denying Plaintiff access to this same public forum for distributing \nreligious literature.   \n30 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 42\n  In Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators, 460 U.S. 37 (1983), the \nCourt stated, “[I]n a public forum . . . all parties have a constitutional right of \naccess and the State must demonstrate compelling reasons for restricting access to \na single class of speakers. . . .”  Id. at 55 (emphasis added).  By making special \naccommodations that favor commercial activity in this traditional public forum and \ncompletely  banning  persons  who  want  to  engage  in  the  distribution  of \nnoncommercial, religious literature, Defendants are violating the Constitution. \n  Indeed, exemptions from a speech restriction—such as allowing commercial \nactivity on the sidewalks that Defendants claim must remain open for pedestrian \ntraffic—“may be noteworthy for a reason quite apart from the risks of viewpoint \nand content discrimination:  They may diminish the credibility of the government’s \nrationale for restricting speech in the first place.”  City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. \n43, 52 (1994).  And as the Supreme Court stated in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, \nInc., “Where government restricts only conduct protected by the First Amendment \nand fails to enact feasible measures to restrict other conduct producing substantial \nharm or alleged harm of the same sort, the interest given in justification of the \nrestriction is not compelling.”  508 U.S. at 546-47. \nIn sum, Defendants’ discriminatory treatment of Plaintiff’s religious speech \nactivity violates the Constitution.   \n \n31 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 43\n  3.  The Speech Restriction Is Not a Valid Time, Place, and  \n      Manner Restriction. \n \nAssuming, arguendo, that the restriction is content-neutral, it must still be \nnarrowly  tailored  to  advance  a  significant  state  interest  and  leave  open  ample \nalternative means of communication.  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, \n802  (1989).    If  the  restriction  “burden[s]  substantially  more  speech  than  is \nnecessary to further the government’s legitimate interests,” it is invalid.  Id. at 799; \nAmerican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. v. City of Dearborn, 418 F.3d 600, \n605 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that a city ordinance was unconstitutional because it \nwas not narrowly tailored and stating, “While the government may burden the \nexercise of First Amendment freedoms to serve its significant interests, it may not \nburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further its goal”) (quotations \nand punctuation omitted) (emphasis added). \nHere, Defendants’ claimed interests are crowd control, traffic, and safety.  \nHowever, it makes little sense to permit businesses to set up fixed locations that \nplainly block the sidewalks and then prohibit Plaintiff from distributing religious \nliterature in the same forum.  If anything, Defendants should ban the sidewalk \nvendors—who could set up a booth on Warren Avenue like all of the other vendors \nparticipating  in  the  festival—and  allow  the  religious  speech  on  the  now  open \nsidewalks.  As this court observed in Congregation Lubavitch v. City of Cincinnati, \n997 F.2d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir. 1993), “Because the City is so willing to disregard \n32 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 44\nthe traffic problems [by making exceptions], we cannot accept the contention that \ntraffic control is a substantial interest.”  (quoting Beckerman v. City of Tupelo, 664 \nF.2d 502, 513 (5th Cir. 1981)).  Similarly here, because the City is so willing to \ndisregard the significant traffic problems associated with commercial sales on the \nsidewalks, this court should not accept “the contention that traffic control is a \nsubstantial interest.”  Thus, there is no legitimate basis for Defendants’ speech \nrestriction on the public sidewalks in the first instance. \nMoreover, Defendants do not limit their speech restriction to the sidewalks \nimmediately adjacent to where the festival activities are taking place on Warren \nAvenue and Miller Road.  Instead, they created a broad, prophylactic prohibition \non the distribution of literature that extends beyond the actual festival to include \nmore than 30 surrounding City blocks (“outer perimeter”).14  See The World Wide \nStreet Preachers’ Fellowship v. Reed, 430 F. Supp. 2d 411, 415 (M.D. Pa. 2006) \n(holding that a fifty-foot buffer zone around a private festival violated the First \nAmendment);  (see  also  Order,  Doc.  No.  006110657885,  at  2-3;  R-60:  Order \nGranting Inj.) (temporarily enjoining restriction in “outer perimeter” or “buffer \n                                                 \n14  The  justification  for  banning  vehicles,  which  is  the  reason  for  the  “outer \nperimeter,”  (R-41:  Haddad  Dep.  at  26-27  at  Defs.’  Ex.  K)  (“They’re  set  up \nstrategically  to  give  traffic  some  final  point  to  turn  away  from  the  Warren \nAvenue Destination.”) (emphasis added), does not extend to restricting literature \ndistribution.  Schneider, 308 U.S. at 160 (“So long as legislation [designed to keep \nstreets open] does not abridge the constitutional liberty of one rightfully upon the \nstreet to impart information through speech or the distribution of literature, [the \nCity] may lawfully regulate the conduct of those using the streets.”). \n33 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 45\nzone” pending appeal)).  Consequently, the City has created a “First Amendment-\nfree zone” that has little to no connection with the festival.  As the Supreme Court \nstated, “Broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression are suspect. . . .  \nPrecision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our \nmost precious freedoms.”  NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 438 (1963).  Indeed, if \ncreating a 30-block buffer zone around the area actually used for the Arab Festival \nis a “narrowly tailored” means of ensuring crowd control, free flow of pedestrian \ntraffic, or safety at the festival, which is mostly occurring on one City street—\nWarren  Avenue—then  “narrow  tailoring  must  refer  not  to  the  standards  of \nVersace, but to those of Omar the tentmaker.”  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 749 \n(2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). \nIn United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171 (1983), for example, the Court \nstruck down a restriction on certain expressive activity, including the distribution \nof literature, on the grounds of the Supreme Court, which included the surrounding \nsidewalks.15  The government argued that the restriction qualified as a reasonable \ntime, place, and manner restriction that was content-neutral, id. at 180, claiming \nthat its purpose “was to provide for the protection of the building and grounds and \nof the persons and property therein, as well as the maintenance of proper order and \ndecorum,” id. at 182.  The Court rejected the argument, noting that while the \n                                                 \n15 The restriction did not prohibit oral expression.  Grace, 461 U.S. at 181, n.10. \n34 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 46\nrestriction  did  further  the  government’s  interests,  it  did  so  with  insufficient \nprecision and hence at excessive cost to the freedom of speech.  Id. at 181.  There \nwas, as the Court stated, “an insufficient nexus” between the government’s interest \nand all of the expressive activity that was banned, id.—just as here there is an \ninsufficient nexus between the City’s interests and the banning of all literature \ndistribution within a 30-block area within the City.   \nAdditionally,  by  banning  the  distribution  of  religious  literature  on  the \nsidewalks  and  in  other  public  areas  and  forcing  Plaintiff  to  a  fixed  location, \nDefendants’  restriction  does  not  leave  open  ample  alternative  means  of \ncommunication, and it prevents Plaintiff from reaching his intended audience.  See \nThe World Wide Street Preachers’ Fellowship, 430 F. Supp. 2d at 415 (“We also \nagree with Plaintiffs that a location across the street [from the festival] is not an \nample alternative channel of communication when they could have been standing \nin the park.”); see generally Bay Area Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224, \n1229  (9th  Cir.  1990)  (“[A]lternative  mode[s]  of  communication  may  be \nconstitutionally inadequate if the speaker’s ‘ability to communicate effectively is \nthreatened’ [and a]n alternative is not ample if the speaker is not permitted to reach \nthe ‘intended audience.’”); Members of the City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, \n466 U.S. 789, 812 (1984) (“[A] restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if \nthe remaining modes of communication are inadequate.”) (citations omitted); see \n35 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 47\nalso American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 418 F.3d at 607 (“[B]ecause we \nhave already found that the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored, whether the City of \nDearborn has provided ample alternatives of communication is now irrelevant in \nthis case. . . .”); NAACP, Western Region v. City of Richmond, 743 F.2d 1346 (9th \nCir. 1984) (“[L]aws regulating public fora cannot be held constitutional simply \nbecause  they  leave  potential  speakers  alternative  fora  for  communicating  their \nviews.”).   \nIn this case, the undisputed objective evidence (20,000 to 37,000 pieces of \nreligious literature distributed without Defendants’ restriction versus 500 pieces of \nreligious  literature  distributed  with  it)  compels  the  conclusion  that  “alternative \nmeans of communication” are constitutionally inadequate.  (See also R-30: Saieg \nDecl.  at  ¶¶  38-40  at  Ex.  1  (stating  specific,  undisputed  reasons  for  why  it  is \ndifficult for a Christian to evangelize Muslims from a fixed location)). \nIn sum, Defendants’ speech restriction violates the First Amendment. \n  D.  Heffron Does Not Control. \n  Plaintiff  and  his  associates  have  never  desired  to  be  a  part  of  the  Arab \nFestival,  and  they  have  never  requested  to  distribute  literature  on  the  festival \ngrounds, which consists of Warren Avenue and parts of Miller Road.16  Instead, \n                                                 \n16 Warren Avenue and Miller Road are the specific locations requested by the \nfestival  organizers.    They  are  the  specific  locations  authorized  by  the  City \n36 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 48\nPlaintiff desires to distribute his religious materials in the public forums adjacent to \nthe festival—areas open to the general public for purposes wholly unrelated to the \nfestival.  Consequently, Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, \nInc., 452 U.S. 640 (1981), is inapplicable.   \n  In Heffron, the entire fairground was used for the fair, and persons paid an \nadmission  fee  to  enter.    The  fair  occurred  at  a  closed,  fixed  location  entirely \ndedicated  for  that  purpose—there  was  no  ongoing  business  activity  on  the \nfairgrounds nor pedestrian traffic moving through that was unrelated to the fair, as \nin this case.  Indeed, here, the only locations dedicated solely for festival activities \nare  Warren  Avenue  and  parts  of  Miller  Road—the  actual  “fairgrounds”—\nexcluding  the  sidewalks,  which  are  open  to  pedestrian  traffic  unrelated  to  the \nfestival.    And  none  of  the  “outer  perimeter”—the  30-block  buffer  zone—is \ndedicated to festival activities.  In sum, Heffron involved a “place” restriction upon \nexpressive  activity  undertaken  on  property  that  was  designated  for  a  limited, \nspecial purpose.  The restriction did not extend beyond the fairgrounds and into \nthe surrounding city sidewalks and streets, as in this case.   \n  E.  Spingola Does Not Control. \n  Spingola v. Village of Granville, 39 Fed. Appx. 978 (6th Cir. 2002), is an \nunpublished  decision  addressing  the  denial  of  a  request  for  a  preliminary \n                                                                                                                                                             \nCouncil’s  resolution.    And  they  are  the  specific  locations  where  the  festival \nactivities actually took place.   \n37 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 49\ninjunction.    In  Spingola,  the  plaintiff  made  a  facial  challenge  to  a  Village \nordinance, which provided that “during an assemblage for which a permit has been \nissued the Village may designate a specific area for the purpose of public speaking \nand that public speaking shall be confined to the designated area.”  Id. at 979.  The \ncourt  noted  in  its  decision  that  “it  was  important  as  a  preliminary  matter  to \ndetermine the type of claim raised [because a] party attempting a facial challenge \ncarries a ‘significantly heavier burden.’”  Id. at 981.  The court also noted that “the \ndistrict court made no factual findings regarding the as-applied claim,” thus, it \nwas not addressed.  Id. (emphasis added).  Consequently, the district court’s claim \nthat Plaintiff’s “argument is foreclosed by Spingola” is simply not true.  (See R-57: \nOp. & Order at 32).  Unlike Spingola, this is not a facial challenge to a content-\nneutral regulation (nor an appeal of a denial of a preliminary injunction).  It is an \nas-applied  challenge  to  a  speech  restriction  based  on  a  well  developed  factual \nrecord.  Thus, any discussion in Spingola beyond the facial challenge presented in \nthat case is simply dicta. \n  In this case, it is essential to be precise about the facts.  Unlike the plaintiff \nin Spingola, see id. at 979 (“Spingola attended the Granville Kiwanis Fourth of \nJuly  celebration.  .  .  .”),  Plaintiff  does  not  want  to  attend  the  festival  or  be  a \nparticipant in any of its activities.  Instead, he wants to engage in free speech \nactivity in the areas adjacent to the festival that are open to the general public for \n38 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 50\npurposes unrelated to the festival.  There is no reasonable dispute that (1) the City \nauthorized the festival to take place on Warren Avenue and Miller Road, with \nWarren being the main location for the event (and the associated crowds); (2) the \nCity ensured that the public sidewalks adjacent to Warren Avenue and Miller Road \nremained  open  to  the  general  public  and  the  local  businesses  for  purposes \nunrelated to the festival (the City constructed barriers to ensure the separation); (3) \nthe City gave preferential treatment to local businesses by allowing them to engage \nin  commercial  activities,  which  were  exceedingly  obstructive,  on  the  public \nsidewalks  where  Plaintiff  was  prohibited  from  engaging  in  his  non-obstructive \nreligious speech; and (4) the City created a 30-block “buffer zone” around the \nfestival.  In this zone, there were no crowds; yet, Plaintiff was denied the right to \ndistribute  his  religious  literature  in  these  public  areas  as  well.    Furthermore, \nPlaintiff has no desire to distribute his religious literature on Warren Avenue or \nMiller Road—he has never requested to do so.  Thus, similar to Heffron, Spingola \nis inapplicable because Plaintiff is not challenging Defendants’ ability to restrict \nhis speech activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road—the designated location of \nthe “street fair.”  \n  In sum, in light of controlling case law, which is not Heffron or Spingola, \nDefendants’ speech restriction is unconstitutional. \n \n39 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 51\nIII.  DEFENDANTS’ SPEECH RESTRICTION VIOLATES PLAINTIFF’S \nRIGHT TO EXPRESSIVE ASSOCIATION. \n \n  Plaintiff and his fellow Christian missionaries travel to the City from all \nacross the United States to join together as part of a Christian outreach to Muslims \nwhich takes place during the Arab Festival.  The primary purpose of this Christian \nassociation is to evangelize Muslims.  And this purpose is accomplished through \nthe  distribution  of  religious  literature.    Consequently,  this  association  and  its \npurpose are constitutionally protected.  Any government restriction, such as the \nchallenged  restriction  at  issue  here,  that  prevents  Plaintiff  and  his  Christian \ncompanions  from  fulfilling  the  lawful  purpose  of  their  expressive  association \ncannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.   \n“Among  the  rights  protected  by  the  First  Amendment  is  the  right  of \nindividuals to associate to further their personal beliefs.  While the freedom of \nassociation is not explicitly set out in the Amendment, it has long been held to be \nimplicit in the freedoms of speech, assembly, and petition.”  Healy v. James, 408 \nU.S. 169, 181 (1972) (citations omitted).  As this Circuit echoed, “Freedom to \nengage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable \naspect of freedom of speech.”  Connection Distributing Co. v. Reno, 154 F.3d 281, \n295 (6th Cir. 1998).  “[I]mplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the \nFirst Amendment” is “a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit of a \nwide  variety  of  political,  social,  economic,  educational,  religious,  and  cultural \n40 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 52\nends.”    Roberts  v.  United  States  Jaycees,  468  U.S.  609,  622  (1984).    Thus, \nPlaintiff’s  activities  are  protected  by  “the  First  Amendment’s  expressive \nassociational right.”   Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 650 (2000).   \nAs  an  “inseparable  aspect  of  freedom  of  speech,”  Plaintiff’s  expressive \nassociational  right  is  similarly  violated  by  Defendants’  unconstitutional  speech \nrestriction, which deprives Plaintiff and his fellow Christian missionaries of their \nright to pursue their religious ends free from government interference. \nIV.  DEFENDANTS’ SPEECH RESTRICTION VIOLATES PLAINTIFF’S \nRIGHT TO THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION. \n \nPlaintiff testified in support of his motion for summary judgment as follows: \n“As part of my Christian outreach efforts, I travel around the country with fellow \nChristians attending and distributing Christian literature at various festivals and \nmosques to exercise my religion and to follow my religious duty based on the \nGreat Commission, which is the instruction of the resurrected Jesus Christ to His \ndisciples that they spread His teachings to all the nations of the world.”  (R-30: \nSaieg Decl. at ¶ 4 at Ex. 1) (emphasis added). \n  Consequently,  there  can  be  no  dispute  that  Plaintiff’s  activity—the  very \nactivity that the challenged restriction prohibits—is not only protected by the Free \nSpeech Clause, but it is protected by the Free Exercise Clause as well.  See, e.g., \nMurdock, 319 U.S. at 110; Mergens, 496 U.S. at 250 (O’Connor, J.) (observing \n41 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 53\nthat “private speech endorsing religion” is protected by “the Free Speech and Free \nExercise Clauses”). \n  In Employment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), the Court was faced with \nthe issue of whether the Free Exercise Clause could prohibit the application of \nOregon drug laws to the ceremonial ingestion of peyote and thus permit the state to \ndeny unemployment compensation for work-related misconduct based on the use \nof this drug.  The Court held that “the right of free exercise does not relieve an \nindividual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general \napplicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his \nreligion prescribes (or proscribes).”  Id. at 879 (quotations and citation omitted) \n(emphasis added).  The Court further stated, “The only decisions in which we have \nheld that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable \nlaw to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause \nalone,  but  the  Free  Exercise  Clause  in  conjunction  with  other  constitutional \nprotections, such as freedom of speech and of the press.”  Id. at 881.  The Court \nthen concluded that “[t]he present case does not present such a hybrid situation, but \na free exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental \nright.”  Id. at 882.  And while some courts, including this one, have been critical of \nthe “hybrid” distinction, see Kissinger v. Board of Trustees, 5 F.3d 177, 180-81 \n(6th Cir. 1993) (describing the “hybrid” outcome as “illogical”), but see Vandiver \n42 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 54\nv. Hardin County Bd. of Educ., 925 F.2d 927, 933 (6th Cir. 1991) (“The Smith \ndecision  implies  without  stating  that  those  hybrid  claims  which  raise  a  free \nexercise challenge coupled with other constitutional concerns remain subject to \nstrict  scrutiny.”),  it  makes  perfect  sense  in  this  case.    As  noted  previously, \nDefendants’  restriction  violates  Plaintiff’s  rights  to  freedom  of  speech  and \nexpressive  association  under  the  First  Amendment.    This  restriction,  which  is \ninvalid (i.e., not a valid and neutral law of general applicability), also operates to \ndeprive Plaintiff of his right to the free exercise of religion.  Consequently, it \ncannot  be  gainsaid  that  Defendants’  unconstitutional  restriction  on  Plaintiff’s \nreligious activity violates the Free Exercise Clause as well as the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment. \n  Moreover, as demonstrated previously, the restriction also runs afoul of the \nSupreme Court’s reasoning set forth in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. \nCity of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993).  According to the Court, “Legislators may \nnot devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a \nreligion or its practices.”  Id. at 547.  “A law burdening religious practice that is \nnot neutral or not of general application must undergo the most rigorous scrutiny.”  \nId. at 546.  As the Court further noted, “Where government restricts only conduct \nprotected by the First Amendment and fails to enact feasible measures to restrict \n43 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 55\nother conduct producing substantial harm or alleged harm of the same sort, the \ninterest given in justification of the restriction is not compelling.”  Id. at 546-47. \nTherefore,  the  fact  that  Defendants’  speech  restriction  might  be  facially \nneutral does not protect it from challenge under the Free Exercise Clause because it \noperates to target Plaintiff’s religious conduct for distinctive treatment.  Id. at 534.  \nDefendants restrict “conduct protected by the First Amendment”—that being the \ndistribution of religious literature on the public sidewalks—but “fail[] to enact \nfeasible measures to restrict other conduct,” such as the commercial activity taking \nplace on the public sidewalks that produces substantially greater harm of the same \nsort.  Thus, the restriction is not “generally applicable,” and it infringes upon rights \nprotected by the Free Exercise Clause without a compelling reason in violation of \nthe Constitution.  \nV.  DEFENDANTS’ SPEECH RESTRICTION VIOLATES THE EQUAL \nPROTECTION  GUARANTEE  OF  THE  FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT. \n \n  The relevant principles of law at issue here were articulated in Police Dept. \nof the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) and in Carey v. Brown, \n447 U.S. 455, 461-62 (1980).  In Mosley, the Court stated, “[U]nder the Equal \nProtection Clause, not to mention the First Amendment itself, government may not \ngrant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to \n44 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 56\nthose wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.” (emphasis \nadded).  And in Carey, the Court described the applicable test as follows: \nWhen  government  regulation  discriminates  among  speech-related \nactivities in a public forum, the Equal Protection Clause mandates \nthat  the  legislation  be  finely  tailored  to  serve  substantial  state \ninterests, and the justifications offered for any distinctions it draws \nmust be carefully scrutinized. \n \nCarey, 447 U.S. at 461-62 (emphasis added); see also Congregation Lubavitch v. \nCity of Cincinnati, 997 F.2d 1160, 1166 (6th Cir. 1993) (striking down on equal \nprotection grounds a speech restriction that made distinctions between privately-\nsponsored  and  publicly-sponsored  exhibits  and  displays  and  stating  that  the \nordinance at issue “violates the Equal Protection Clause unless the distinction can \nbe shown to be finely tailored to governmental interests that are substantial”).   \nIn  this  case,  Defendants’  speech  restriction  makes  a  distinction  between \npersons who want to engage in constitutionally protected speech activity through \nthe distribution of religious literature on the public sidewalks, and those persons \nwho want to engage in commercial activity in this very same forum.  The former is \nprohibited by Defendants, while the latter is not.  This restriction plainly implicates \nFirst Amendment liberties, as demonstrated previously.  Thus, upon the court’s \ncareful scrutiny of the justifications offered by Defendants for the distinction, the \nquestion  becomes  whether  the  distinction  is  “finely  tailored  to  governmental \ninterests that are substantial”?  As the overwhelming evidence shows, the answer \n45 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 57\nto this question is an unequivocal “no.”  The commercial activity, which causes \ngreater traffic control problems (the alleged governmental interest), is permitted, \nwhile  the  less  obstructive  literature  distribution  in  the  same  forum  is  not.17  \nTherefore,  “under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  not  to  mention  the  First \nAmendment itself,” Defendants’ speech restriction is unconstitutional.  \nVI.  THE  CITY  IS  LIABLE  FOR  VIOLATING  PLAINTIFF’S \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. \n \n  In Monell v. New York City Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694-95 \n(1978), the Supreme Court affirmed that municipalities are liable under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 if municipal policy or custom was the “moving force” behind the alleged \nunconstitutional  action.    And  “when  execution  of  a  government’s  policy  or \ncustom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may \nfairly be said to represent official policy [such as the acts of the chief of police in \nthis case], inflicts the injury . . . the government as an entity is responsible under § \n1983.”  Id. at 694 (emphasis added).  Here, the City passed an official resolution \nauthorizing the Arab Festival, “subject to all applicable ordinances and the rules \nand  regulations  of  the  Police  Department.”    This  includes  the  “buffer-zone” \nrestriction, the use of the City’s police to restrict Plaintiff’s speech on the public \n                                                 \n17 Consider further the fact that these businesses can still sell their items from \nwithin their stores, and, in addition, they could set up vending booths within the \nfestival along with all of the other commercial activity, thereby leaving the public \nsidewalks clear for Plaintiff’s constitutionally protected religious activity (as well \nas pedestrian traffic). \n46 \n \n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110696538   Filed: 08/03/2010   Page: 58\nsidewalks,  the  decision  to  not  enforce  the  City’s  “distribution  of  handbills” \nordinance,  which  expressly  allows  Plaintiff’s  speech  activity,  the  preferential \ntreatment for the local businesses, and the widespread pattern of discriminatory \ntreatment of Plaintiff and other Christians.  The City cannot escape liability for \nthe unconstitutional acts it authorized.   \nCONCLUSION \n  Plaintiff respectfully requests that this court reverse the grant of summary \njudgment in Defendants’ favor and reverse the denial of Plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment and his request for injunctive relief. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nTHOMAS MORE LAW CENTER \n \ns/Robert J.

This case involves the \nconstitutionality of a City’s actions to  enforce content-neutral tim e, place \nmanner regulations, and turns on the significant question of whether the \nregulations withstand First Amendment scrutiny.  This case also involves a \nfact-intensive inquiry about the boundaries of a street festival, and whether \nthose  boundaries fit within existing precedent involving street festivals.   \nTherefore, this case involves issues of a nature and com plexity that justifies \nthe type of consideration and exchange inherent in oral argument.

Introduction\n  This case is about a Plaintiff-Appellant (“Plaintiff”) who is freely exercising \nhis First Amendment rights during the Dearborn Arab International Festival (“the \nFestival”), but who seeks a level of access to the Festival beyond what is enjoyed \nby all other speakers within the same forum .  While Plaintiff alleges that he does \nnot  seek access to the Festival, his argument is refuted by the uncontroverted \nevidence that the areas within which he seeks to distribute materi als are, in fact, \nwithin the boundaries of the Festival.   He challenges a narrowly-tailored content-\nneutral regulation on handbilling within the Festival that is enforced to promote \npublic safety and crowd control.  Plaintiff has twice been denied the relief he seeks \nbelow.  Plaintiff requests reversal of Eastern District Judge Paul Borman’s grant of \nsummary  judgment  to Defendants-Appellees (“Defendants”), and seeks an \ninjunction against enforcement of regulations at future Festivals.  However, in light \nof Plaintiff’s demonstrated failure on the m erits, the lack of error on the part of \nJudge Borman, and the fact that Plaintiff was offered am ple access to the 2010 \nFestival,  Judge Borman’s Opinion and Order granting Defendants summary \njudgment should be affirmed. \n4\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 16\nB. The Arab International Festival \nFor the past fifteen years, Dearborn has served as the venue for the Festival.  \nth th\nThe 14  Festival occurred June 19-21, 2009.  The 15  Festival occurred June 18-\n20, 2010.  It is free and open to the public.  (Defendant’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment, Exhibit D, at Record Entry No. 41-4.  [Hereinafter “RE No.”] )  The \nFestival is intended to celebrate Arabic culture, build bridges, and “prom ote the \nWarren Avenue Business District.”  (RE No. 41-5.)  Some of the activities includ e \na carnival, music, food booths, merchandise vendors, and a fashion show.  (RE No. \n41-4.)   It is organized by the American Arab Chamber of Co mmerce  (“Arab \nChamber”).  (Transcript of Deposition of Fay Beydoun, p. 14, at RE No. 41-3.  \n[Hereinafter “Beydoun dep.”])  Contributions supporting the Festival are provided \nby sponsors including AT&T, General Motors, Chrysler, Oakwood Hospital, the \nU.S. Army, and the City of Dearborn.  (RE No. 41-4.)\n  The Festival extends approximately 14 city blocks, east to west, on Warren \nAvenue in east Dearborn, and occupies both the streets and  sidewalks.  (Maps \nattached as RE No. 41-6; Beydoun dep., p. 34, 37.)  Tents line the street and are \ndedicated  to festival sponsors, children’ s  activities, food ve ndors,  artisans, and \ninformation tables staffed by c ommunity, religious, and corporate orga nizations.  \n(RE No. 41-4, 5.)  The 2009 Festival featured 96 booths or tables.  (RE No. 41-4.)\n5\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 17\n  The Festival attracts hundreds of thousands of people.  The Dearborn Press \nand Guide reported on June 17, 2009 that more than 250,000 people were expected \nto attend the 2009 Festival.  (RE No. 41-7.)  With such a large num ber of visitors, \nclose attention is paid by Festival organizers to public safety issues.    \nTo ensure an orderly and safe transition from the open streets and the streets \noccupied by the Festival, Festival organizers requested that an area be maintained \nbetween  the open streets and the area where the core Festival activities were  \n1\noccurring.   (Beydoun dep., p. 40; Transcript of deposition of Jeffrey Mrowka, p. \n15,  at RE No. 41-8. [Hereinafter “Mrowka dep.”])  The City agreed and  \naccomplished this by setting up a second set of barricades.  This resulted in the \nestablishment of what has been referred to for purposes of this litigation as tw o \n“perimeters”  – the “inner perimeter” and the “outer perimeter.”  In 2009, the \nwestern  inner perimeter boundary w as  established at Warren and Hartwell.   \n(Mrowka dep., p. 14, and RE No. 41-6.)  The eastern perimeter boundary was \nestablished at Middlepoint.  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and RE No. 41-6.)  The northern \nand southern “inner” borders were established at the front of the businesses along \nWarren Avenue, thus encompassing the sidewalks.  (Mrowka dep., p. 14, and RE \nNo. 41-6.)  The Festival also occurred on Miller Road, wh ere the northern and \n1 While this area, at times, has been de scribed in common parlance as a “buffer zone,” the area actually was the \nouter edge of the festival boundaries. (Transcript of hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment, p. 6.  \n[Hereinafter “MSJ Tr.”])  As will be fully explaine d in this brief, the area did  not function as a “buffer” to any \nspeech, as all speakers were welcome within the Festival area, subject to the Festival’s content neutral time, place, \nand manner regulations. \n6\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 18\nsouthern boundaries extended one block behind the  businesses.  (Mrowka dep., p. \n14, and RE No. 41-6.)   The “outer pe rimeter” was established to the west at \nSchaefer, Wyoming to the east, Morrow Circ le South to the north, and Blesser to \nthe south.  (Mrowka dep., p. 16, and RE No. 41-6.)\n  Festival-related  activities took place within both “perimeters.”  The core \nFestival activities took place within the inner perimeter, and covered area on both \nthe streets and sidewalks.  (RE 41-10.)  Ancillary activities, such as parking for \nFestival vendors, took place within the outer perimeter.  (Beydoun dep., p. 43-44.)  \n  In 2009, new leaders joined the Festival planning process, thus providing the \nopportunity  to im plement  changes. The Arab Cham ber  had a new Executive \nDirector, Fay Beydoun.  Ronald Haddad was in his first year as Dearborn Police \nChief.   (Transcript of deposition of Ronald Had dad,  p. 1 4,  at RE No. 41-11.   \n[Hereinafter  “Haddad dep.”] )   It also  was  Sgt. Jeffrey Mrowka ’s  first year as \nSpecial  Events Coordinator for the Dearborn Police.  (Mrowka Dep., p. 9.)   \nThrough  the planning process, these individuals were among the leaders that \naddressed “the city/public concerns from previous festival years (traffic safety, \nparking, temporary food license com pliance, issuing of sidewalk sales perm its, \ncarnival license, noise and litter).”  (RE No. 41-12.)\nRegarding sidewalk sales, in past years (when the Festival did not extend to \nthe fronts of the businesses), any busine ss located around the Festival area could \n7\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 19\napply to the City for a permit.  (Beydoun dep., p. 31.)  This changed in 2009.  To \naddress concerns about impediments to pedestrian traffic, the Arab Chamber asked \nto take control of the sidewalk sales perm itting process.  (Beydoun dep., p. 31, 34, \n37.)  The City agreed.  Consequently, any business along Warren Avenue that \nwanted to set up a sidewalk sale was required to subm it an application.  (Beydoun \ndep., p. 32.)  If it was feasible to allow the sidewalk sale, the Arab Chamber would \napprove the application.  (Beydoun dep., p. 32.)  Significantly, this change caused \nthe  sidewalks to be come  subsumed within the Festival boundaries.  As noted \nduring oral argument on the parties’ cross-m otions for summary judgment, the \nDearborn City Council passed a resolution identifying the boundaries of the 2010 \nFestival as extending from business alley to business alley, thus incorporating the  \nstorefronts, streets, and sidewalks.\nC. Police presence at the Festival \nWhile the Festival is not a City of Dearborn event, any large-scale event that \noccurs within the City of Dearborn inevitably requires City services.  For example, \nthe  Arab Cham ber  cannot close the streets and sidewalks without the City’s \npermission.   (RE No. 41-5.)   Police s upport  is needed for crowd control, to \nmaintain a perimeter around the event, and  to ensure public safety.  (Haddad dep.,  \np. 15, 18.)  The police achieve their goals by enforcing content-neutral,  narrowly-\ntailored regulations.  Am ong the regulations enforced are rules and regulations \n8\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 20\npromulgated by the Arab Chamber to ensure an orderly Festival.  To facilitate this \nsupport,  the Dearborn Police Department set up a command post within the \nFestival boundaries.  (Haddad dep., p. 52.)   \nD. The application process and Festival rules\n  Any person or entity wishing to participate in the Festival m ust submit an \napplication to the Arab Chamber by a deadline, which in 2009 was April 31.  (RE \nNo. 41-15.)  All applicants m ust pay a fee.  The application packet inclu des rules \nand regulations, including: \nMiscellaneous Rules: \n2. No  unauthorized perform ances,  sales, dem onstrations, \nexhibits, or solicitations of any kind shall be permitted. \n*    *    * \n8.  No loitering shall be perm itted at the Festival entrance \npoints or in any area where such activity would impede \npedestrian flow. \nRE No. 41-15. \nThe  Festival rules apply to all solicitation and distribution activities.   \n(Beydoun  dep., p. 51-52.)  Pedestrian flow clearly is a concern of the Arab \nChamber,  as the Chamber not only re ferenced  pedestrian flow in its \n“Miscellaneous  Rules,” but also in rules restricting political solicitation and  \nmaterials distribution in order to m aintain “an orderly and uninterrupted schedule \nof Festival activities and a free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.”  (RE No . \n9\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 21\n41-15.)  The regulations further warn, “any infraction of above rules will result in \nimmediate  ejection from   the Festival site and other appropriate enforcement \naction.”  (RE No. 41-15.)\nE. Plaintiff’s Christian ministry and preparation for the 2009 Festival \nPlaintiff is a Christian who has been ministering to Muslims since 1987. \n(Transcript  of Deposition of George Saieg, p. 21, at RE No. 42. [Hereinafter  \n“Saieg Dep.”])  In 2003, he founded the California-based nonprofit organization \nArabic  Christian Perspective (“ACP”), which served to “present the gospel of \nJesus Christ to the Muslim s in the U.S.”  (Saieg dep., p. 16.)  ACP dissolved in \n2009, after the Festival.  (Saieg dep., p 16.)  ACP trained people throughout the \ncountry to minister to Muslims, and coordinated with other groups to organize \nlarge-scale  outreach missions such as attending an Arabic Festival in Seattle,  \nWashington, an international festival in St. Louis, Missouri, and an Arab Festival \nin Dearborn, Michigan.  (Saieg dep., p. 27-32.)  A dditionally, Plaintiff and ACP \nwould  orchestrate smaller-sca le  visits to m osques.   (Saieg dep., p. 26-27.)   \nAlthough  ACP has been dissolved, Plaintiff plans to continue m inistering, \nincluding in Dearborn.  (Saieg dep., p. 66.)\nPlaintiff regularly seeks the assistance of police departments when planning \nmission trips to inform the police of his intentions and receiv e guidance.  (Saieg \ndep., p. 30.)  When planning a mosque visit, Plaintiff specifically requests a police \n10\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 22\npresence  to “keep peace b etween  both side[s]” and to prevent any “false \naccusations” from being made against him or his colleagues.  (Saieg dep., p. 34.)\nAttending  the Festival has been one of Plaintiff’s major activities since \n2004.  (Saieg dep., p. 36.)  In conjunction with the Festival, Plaintiff and ACP  \ncoordinated an annual event titled “Facing  the Muslim Challenge,” which in 2009 \nextended  from  June 16-21, and included training progra ms,  debates, prayer  \nsessions, mosque visits, and door-to-door  outreach.  (RE No. 41-2.)  Planning fo r \nthe program began at least six months in advance.  (Saieg dep., p. 66.)  Activities \ntook place at numerous venues, including Dearborn’s Hemlock Park.  (RE No. 41-\n2.)  Plaintiff organized approximately 90  people to visit Dearborn that weekend.   \n(Saieg dep., p. 69.)  As part of their outreach, Plaintiff’s group distributes materials \nincluding the Gospel of John, religious tracts, and Jesus DVDs.  (Saieg dep., p. 29.) \n  Despite planning his outreach mission for at least six months, Plaintiff did \nnot inquire about participating in the Festival until after the application deadline  \nhad passed.  When Plaintiff finally did contact Sgt. Mrowka in May 2009, he \nlearned about the regulation requiring that materials could only be handed out from \na fixed location.  (Mrowka dep., p. 20.)  Plaintiff told Sgt. Mrowka that he would \nnot pay for a booth.  (Mrowka dep, p. 25.)  Sgt. Mrowka informed Plaintiff that the \nFestival could accommodate him at a table on the edge of  the Festival.  ( Mrowka \ndep., p. 25.)  However, Plaintiff resisted, noting that he wanted to bring 90 people \n11\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 23\nto the Festival.  (Mrowka dep., p. 25.)  Sgt. Mrowka assured Plaintiff that his group \ncould be accommodated at a location on Warren Avenue and Kingsley. (Mrowka \ndep., p. 25.)  Plaintiff still protested.  (Mrowka dep., p. 25.)   \nF. The Temporary Restraining Order denial and the 2009 Festival \n  Plaintiff  filed his original Com plaint  and Motion for a Tem porary \nRestraining Order on June 16,  2010.  A  hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion was held \nbefore the Hon. Nancy G. Edm unds on June 18, 2010.  Judge Edm unds ruled that \n“there is a significant distinction between a public sidewalk that is a sidewalk \nduring an ordinary weekend . . . and a sidewalk which is contiguous to a festival \nwhich . . .  involves basically wall-to-wall people, over 250,000 over the three day \nperiod.”  (Transcript of hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for a Tem porary Restraining \nOrder, p. 34, at RE No. 10.  [Hereinafter “TRO Tr.”])  She concluded that the “area \nimmediately adjacent to the street, separated only by a curb . . . [is ] subject to the \nsame crowd and safety concerns during the period of the fair as the street area \nitself.”   (TRO Tr., p 35.)  Judge Edmunds ruled that the regulation and its \nenforcement are content-neutral time, place, and manner  restrictions that provide \nan alternative means of communication.  (TRO Tr., p., 36.)  She cited  Spingola v. \nth\nGranville, 39 Fed. Appx. 978 (6  Cir., 2002) for the proposition that the sidewalks \nare not serving their norm al function during the Festival, and that interm ediate \nscrutiny should apply.  (TRO Tr., p. 37.)  Accordingly, Judge Edmunds declined to \n12\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 24\nissue a temporary restraining order.  (TRO Tr., p. 38.)  She concluded by inquiring \nwhether Plaintiff would still be offered “the same accommodations that they were \nwilling to provide prior to the hearing.”  (TRO Tr., p. 38.)  Dearborn’s counsel  \nagreed.  (TRO Tr., p. 38.)  Plaintiff was provided the origina lly-offered location at \nWarren and Kingsley, at no charge. \n  Plaintiff successfully reached his audience.  Plaintiff’s group m ingled with \nthe crowd, and people visited his booth.  (RE No. 41-17.)  Plaintiff does not deny \nthat  he distributed litera ture,  conducted a training program at a city park, and \ncanvassed Dearborn’s residential neighborhoods without City interference. (Saieg \ndep., p. 68, 109.)   Plaintiff does not point to any problems at any booths.  Perhaps \none of the most successful booths was that of Dr. Josh McDowell, a Christian \nminister to Muslims who properly applied for a booth, and who had such a pleasant \ntime that he wrote a letter to the editor describing his experience.  (RE No. 41-20.) \nG. The Motions for Summary Judgment, hearing, and 2010 Festival \n  Oral argument on the parties’ cross-Motions for Summary Judgm ent was \nheard before the Hon. Paul D. Borman in the Eastern District of Michigan on May \n21,  2010.  Prior to oral argum ent,  Judge Borman requested that Defendants \nindicate where Plaintiff’s booth would be located within the 2010 Festival.  (RE \nNo. 55.)  Upon consulting with the Arab Cham ber, Defendants presented a letter \nand map indicating that Plaintiff would be  offered a location in the artesian tent, \n13\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 25\nwhich is centrally located within the Festival, and included electricity and lighting.   \n(RE No. 56.)   It was also established during oral argum ent that the City would \nrecommend that the Arab Chamber waive Plaintiff’s fee.  (Transcript of hearing on \ncross-motions for summary judgment, p. 32. [Hereinafter “MSJ Tr.”]) \n  Judge Borman issued his Opinion and O rder denying Plaintiff’s Motion for \nSummary Judgment and granting Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgm ent on \nJune 7, 2010.  (RE No. 57, 58.)  Judge Borman ruled that the streets and sidewalks \nwithin both the “inner” and “outer” perimeters are part of the fairground and are \nnot serving as streets and sidewalks during the Festival.  (Opinion p. 23 n. 10, and \n36-37,  at RE No. 57. [Hereinafter “Op. ”])   He concluded that Plaintiff’s \nmissionaries “have never been denied access to the Festival forum .”  (Op., p. 26-\n27.)  The Court also agreed that allowing businesses to set up tables outside of \ntheir stores on Warren Avenue is content-neutral, noting, \nIf ACP had an existing office located in the inner perim eter along \nWarren Avenue, there is nothing in th e record to suggest that it could \nnot set up a table outside its office like everyone else occupying space \nalong Warren Avenue.\nOp., p. 30-31. \n  Significantly, like Judge Edmonds, Judge Borman concluded that Spingola,\nsupra, and Heffron v. International Socie ty of Krishna Consciousness,  452 U.S. \n640 (1981), control the instant case.     Judge Borman emphasized, as the Spingola\ncourt did, that “The question is whether preventing uncontrolled public speaking in \n14\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 26\nthese  areas prom otes  a significant governmental interest that would be less \neffectively achieved without the law.”  (Op., p. 33, citing Spingola, at 984.) \n  Ultimately,  Judge Borman concluded that Defendants’ enforcement of \nhandbilling regulations in this case serves the significant governm ent interests of \n“maintaining  crowd control, relieving pe destrian  congestion, and e nsuring  an \norderly Festival.”  (Op., p. 33.)  Likewise, Judge Borm an found that the regulation \nis  narrowly tailored. (Op., p. 33-34.)  Accordingly, Judge Borman granted \nsummary judgment to Defendants, and denied summary judgment to Plaintiff on \nPlaintiff’s  First Amendment free speech claim ,  and denied Plaintiff injunctive \nrelief.  Judge Borman also granted summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiff’s \nfreedom  of  association, free exercise, equal protection, and m unicipal  liability \nclaims.  (Op., p. 40.) \nH. The Sixth Circuit appeal and request for injunctive relief. \n  Plaintiff filed his claim of appeal on June 7, 2010.  On June 8, 2010, he filed \nan  Emergency Motion for Expedited Re view  and Reversal of Order Denying \nRequest for Injunctive Relief.   Pending review of the merits of Plaintiff’s claim , \nthis Court granted Plaintiff a  limited injunction that allowed Plaintiff, only, to \ndistribute literature within the area referred to as the “outer perimeter” during the \n2010 Festival held on June 18, 19, and 20, 2010.  (RE No. 61.)   The Order expired \nat the close of the 2010 Festival.  Within  its Order, this Court recognized the \n15\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 27\napplicability  of  Heffron to  the Festival boundaries, noting “This order leaves \nundisturbed the ability of the defendants to prohibit Saieg from  distributing his \nreligious literature within the Festival itself.   See Heffron.”  (RE No. 61.)  Of \ncourse,  this Court also recognized that the order “shall be fully subject to \n2\nreconsideration and revision or modification.”   (RE No. 61.) \n  Defendants now submit their brief in opposition to Plaintiff’s principal brief, \nand request that this Honorable Court affirm the District Court’s grant of summary \njudgment for Defendants, as the sidewalks and the area comm only referred to as \nthe “outer perimeter” are within the Festival grounds and are subject to content-\nneutral time place manner regulations under Heffron and its progeny. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n  Defendants  are charged with enforcing content-neutral time, place, and \nmanner  regulations designed to prom ote  significant  governmental interests in \nfurtherance of public health, safety, and welfare.  Each year, during the privately -\norganized Festival, Defendants provide police support and enforce the Festival’s \ncontent-neutral  regulations, with the goal of prom oting  smooth  traffic flow,  \ncontrolling pedestrian flow, and providing for general public safety.  Specifically , \nit enforces a rule req uiring that all literatu re distribution, vending, soliciting, and \n2 Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion that this Court found that Plaintiff “would likely succeed on the merits of his \nappeal,” this Court did not reach any conclusions on the merits, as it only determined that, due to time constraints \nand the nature the issues presented by the appeal, a limited temporary injunction would be appropriate.  (RE No. 61.) \n16\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 28\nsimilar activity occurring within the Festival grounds be conducted from a fixed \nlocation.\n  The Festival is a street fair and is properly regulated as a lim ited public \nforum; thus any regulations m ust be evaluated under intermedia te scrutiny.  The  \nFestival grounds include streets and sidewalks that are offset from  the rest of the  \nstreets and sidewalks by a perimeter of barricades.  The outer border of the Festival \ngrounds provides a separation of the Festival from the outside world, and further \nserves  the Festival by providing parking for Festival volunteers and as an \naccommodation  for patrons of businesses   along the Festival perimeter whose \nparking  is displaced by the Festival.  All portions of the Festival – including \nstreets, sidewalks, and the “outer perimeter” area are part of the Festival grounds \nand  subject  to content-neutral time, place, manner regulations, including the \nrequirement that all literature distribution occur from a fixed location. \n  Plaintiff was offered a booth inside the Festival, and was free to roam  the \nstreets to spread his message to Festiva l attendees – there is no “buffer zone”  \nprohibiting free speech at any place in t he Festival.  Only materials distribution is \nregulated.  The rules apply to all Christian, Arab, non-profit, and corporate groups,  \nand many such groups willingly abide by the requirement.  If Plaintiff were to be \nexempted from the regulation, the City’s interest in crowd control and public safety \nwould  be jeopardized as all c ontrol  would be lost over the activities of many \n17\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 29\nvendors  and organizations seeking to distribute materials.  The regulations are  \nnarrowly-tailored to achieve the interests of crowd control and public safety, and \nleave  Plaintiff amp le  alternative chann els  of communication.  Accordingly,  \nPlaintiff’s First Amendment right to free speech has not been violated.  Because \nthe regulations are content-neutral and enforced in an evenhanded manner, Plaintiff \nalso fails to state a claim  under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\n  Because  Plaintiff’s First Amend ment  right to free speech has not been \nviolated,  he cannot dem onstrate  the violation of a hybrid right necessary to \nestablish a violation of his free exercise.  Likewise, he cannot dem onstrate that the \nCity has in any way compelled him to engage in practices offensive to his religion, \nor to abstain from those required by his religion.  Because Plaintiff failed to state \nissues of material fact in response to Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgm ent, \nhis free exercise claim was abandoned, and is otherwise not viable. \n  Plaintiff also has failed to demonstrate that his freedom of association has \nbeen violated, as he has not been required to accept views with which he disagrees, \nto associate with people with whom he does not wish to associate, and the City has \nnot prohibited him from engaging in any of his activities with like-m inded people \nor any other people who he chooses to approach. \n18\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 30\nAdditionally,  because  there has been no constitutional violation,   and \nPlaintiff has produced no evidence of a pattern or policy of selective enforcemen t, \nDefendant Dearborn has no liability under 42 U.S.C. §1983.\nUltimately, because Plaintiff failed to state a genu ine issue of material fact \nfor trial, and failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation, the Eastern District of \nMichigan  properly denied Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgm ent,  properly \ndenied injunctive relief to Plaintiff, and properly granted De fendants’ Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  This Court should affirm Judge Borman’s Opinion and Order \ndated June 7, 2010.   \nARGUMENT\nI. STANDARDS OF REVIEW \nA. Summary Judgment \nThis  Court reviews a grant or denial of sum mary  judgment de novo.   \nTrustees of the Mich. Laborers' Health Care Fund v. Gibbons , 209 F.3d 587, 590 \nth\n(6  Cir., 2000).  Summary judgment is proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) where no \ngenuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \n587 (1986).  In evaluating a m otion for summary judgment, the court must view \nthe evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonm oving party.  \nMatsushita,  at  587.   The proper inquiry is “whether the evidence presents a \n19\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 31\nsufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided \nthat one party must prevail as a matter of law.”   Anderson v. Liberty Lobby Inc., \n477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).  When confr onted with a properly supported motion \nfor summary judgment, the nonmoving party must set forth specific facts showing \nth\nthat there is a genuine issue for trial.   Mitchell v. Chapman, 343 F.3d 811 (6  Cir. \n2003).  In this case, the evidence is so one-sided that Defendants should prevail as \na matter of law. \nB. Injunctive Relief \nWhen examining a district court's denial of an injunction, this Court applies \nthe clear error standard for factual findings, and reviews legal conclusions de novo.  \n“But the district court' s ultimate decision regarding injunctive relief is reviewed \nunder the ‘highly deferential’ abuse-of-discretion standard.”  H.D.V. - Greektown, \nth\nLLC v. City of Detroit, 568 F.3d 609, 618-619 (6  Cir., 2009).  This Court reviews \nthe district court’s findings for “clear error” and its legal conclusions “de novo.”   \nth\nACLU v. Taft, 385 F.3d 641, 645 (6  Cir., 2004).  Permanent injunctive relief will \nonly be available upon the plaintiff’s e stablishment of a constitutiona l violation, \nand “upon showing 1) a continuing irreparable injury if the court fails to issue the \ninjunction, and 2) the lack of an adequate remedy at law.”   Kallstrom v. Columbus, \nth\n136 F.3d. 1055, 1067 (6  Cir., 1998).\n20\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 32\nII. THE  DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY RULED THAT \nPLAINTIFF’S  FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREE S PEECH \nWAS  NOT VIOLATED, AS TH E  FESTIVAL RULES WERE \nPROPERLY  APPLIED TO ALL STREETS AND SIDEWALKS \nWITHIN THE FESTIVAL GROUNDS. \nA. Festival  grounds, including the street s  and sidew alks  within a \nstreet fair, are part  of a single forum that is pr operly subject to \ntime, place, and manner restrictions identifying fixed locations for \nliterature distribution. \n1. Heffron and Spingola control the instant case. \nJudge Borman correctly held that this c ase is controlled by  Heffron and \nSpingola, supra.  In Heffron, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness \n(“ISKCON”),  sought to distribute materials during Minnesota’s State Fair.   \nHeffron, at 645.  H owever, the State Fair prom ulgated rules requiring that “all \npersons, groups or firms which desire to sell, exhibit, or distribute materials during \nthe annual State Fair m ust do so only from  fixed locations on the fairgrounds.”   \nHeffron, at 643.  The rule did not prohibit speakers from traversing through the fair \nand speaking to fair-goers provided that no materials were distributed.   Heffron, at \n643-644.  Though ISKCON com pared the fairgrounds to city streets, the Court \nruled:\nThe flow of the crowd and demands of safety are more pressing in the \ncontext of the Fair.  As such any com parisons to public streets are \nnecessarily inexact. \nHeffron, at 651. \n21\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 33\nIn upholding the rule facially and as applied to ISKCON, the Supreme Court \nnoted that the Fairgrounds were a “relat ively small area,” that the av erage daily \nattendance  had been 115,000-160,000 people, and that at least 1,400 other \nexhibitors  rented space at the Fair, including many non-pro fit  and religious \norganizations representing a broad spectrum of views.  Heffron, at 643-644.\nThough ISKCON’s oral and written distri bution of its religious views was \nan important ritual of the religion, the Court declared that ISKCON “and its ritual    \n. . .  have no special clai m to First Amendment protection.”  Heffron, at 652.  It \nconcluded that, if the rule was invalidated with respect to ISKCON,\nThere would be a mu ch larger threat to the State’s interest in crowd \ncontrol  if all other religious, nonreligious, and noncommercial \norganizations  could likewise m ove  freely about the fairgrounds \ndistributing and selling literature and soliciting funds at will.\nHeffron, at 653. \n  The Court therefore upheld the regulation as a valid time, place, and manner \nrestriction serving a substantial government interest.  Heffron, at 655. \n  In Spingola, this Court applied Heffron to a village ordina nce restricting \npublic speaking during street fairs.   Spingola involved a two-block fair, at which \nthe plaintiff had previously preached at various locations.   Spingola, at 979.  After \nthe ordinance was passed, he was restricted to a single location.   Spingola, at 980.  \nThe plaintiff argued that strict scrutiny should apply because he sought to preach  \non  the “public stre ets,”  which are traditional public fora.   Spingola,  at  982.  \n22\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 34\nHowever,  this Court declared that the plaintiff’s argum ent  was “m isguided,” \nstating,\nThe  designated speaking area within the festival perimeters, \nthough comprised of public streets,  is not serving that function \nduring the festival . . . Clearly, the festival area is more akin to a \nfair than a normal city street.  But, regardless . . . the Ordinance \nis examined under the same intermediate level of scrutiny. \nId., at 983. \n  Thus, this Court ruled that, when public streets are closed for a fair, they can \nbe regulated like the fairgrounds in Heffron.\n  Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals has acknowledged that regulations \nrestricting picketing on capitol grounds could validly apply to the sidewalks just as \nthey  do to the grounds, provided that the side walks  are included in the area \nintended  to be regulated.   Michigan  Up & Out of Poverty Now Coalition v. \nMichigan, 210 Mich. App 162, 174, n. 7 (1995).  Indeed, the sidewalks “command \nno greater status as a traditional public forum ” when they are within a regulated \narea. Michigan Up & Out of Poverty, at 162, 174, n. 7.\n2. The  streets and sidew alks  constitute part of the  \nFestival grounds subject to Heffron and Spingola.\nIn the instant case, the streets and sidewalks are the Festival grounds and are \nsubject  to the type of content-neutral regulations approved in  Heffron and\nSpingola.  By seeking to distribute literature on the sidewalks, Plaintiff is seeking \naccess to the Festival grounds, and must follow Festival rules.  Moreover, because \n23\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 35\nthe streets and sidewalks are not functioning as streets and sidewalks during the \nFestival,  Plaintiff’s reliance on cases such as  Jamison v. Texas,  318 U.S. 413 \n(1943), and U.S. v. Grace,  461 U.S. 171 (1983), is m isplaced since those cases \naddress open streets and sidewalks, and any comparison between the facts of those \ncases and the facts of a case involving a festival is “necessarily inexact.”  Heffron,\nat 651.\n  Plaintiff argues that the presence of some Festival activities on the sidewalk \nfrustrates the goals of m aintaining crowd control and keeping open passageways \nthrough  the Festival.  However, as em phasized  by Judge Borman,  Spingola \ninstructs that the question is not whethe r the regulation cures all obstructions and \npedestrian  flow problem s,  but rather “whether preventing uncontrolled public  \nspeaking in these areas promotes a significant governmental interest that would be \nless effectively achieved without the la w.”  Spingola, at 984. It is sufficient that \nthe rules provide “a smoother flow of traffic within the festival crowd.”   Spingola, \nat 984. By taking control of the sidewalks, the Arab Chamb er has been able to  \nmaintain open spaces throughout the sidewalk system for pedestrian passage fro m \none area to another.  (RE No. 41-21.)  If the Arab Cham ber were to lose control,  \nthen  the risks of overcrowding and disorderliness would be m ultiplied \nexponentially, especially as other individuals, groups, and vendors m igrated to the \nsidewalks,  just as the Supreme Court feared in  Heffron.    This  is especially a \n24\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 36\nconcern given the fact that more than 250,000 people attend the Festival, and as the \ncrowds gather, the streets are filled with people from curb to curb.  (RE No. 41-\n22.) Consequently, the regulation at issue in this case does promote the free flow \nof pedestrians and traffic through the Festival.  Th e Eastern District of Michigan’s \nOpinion and Order granting Defendants summary judgment should be affirmed. \n3. The “outer perimeter” is within the Festival grounds, \ndoes  not serve as a “buffer”   to free speech, and is \nsubject to Heffron and Spingola.\nThis Court and Plaintiff have expresse d specific interest in the question of \nwhether the Festival rules regarding ha ndbilling apply to the area that has been \ntermed  for convenience through this litiga tion  as the “outer perimeter.”  The \nquestion necessarily hinges on whether the “outer perim eter” constitutes a portion \nof the Festival grounds.  As has been  established by the facts on the record, the \n“outer perimeter” is within the Festival grounds, and therefore it was proper for \nJudge Borman to conclude that the “outer perimeter” is controlled by  Heffron and\nSpingola just like the streets and sidewalks. \nPlaintiff has referred to the “outer pe rimeter” as a “buffer zone” an d has \nsuggested  that this case should be likened to  Worldwide  Street Preacher s’ \nFellowship, et. al. v. Reed,  430 F. Supp. 2d 411 (M.D. PA, 2006).  However, \nWorldwide Street Preachers’ is not instructive not only because it is a non-binding \ncase from the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, but even more \n25\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 37\nsignificantly because that case involved an actual “buffer zone” that functioned to \nexclude speakers from a forum,  which is not comp arable to the instant case.  In \nWorldwide Street Preachers,’ the Court found a First Am endment violation where \nthe defendant “did enforce a fifty-foot buffer zone . . . directing the Christian  \nprotestors to keep back fifty feet from ” the area for which the defendants had a  \npermit to host a Pride Fest.   Worldwide Street Preachers, at 414.  There, the Pride \nFest obtained a permit to use a designated area of a park for their event, and asked \nthe City to enclose a portion of that area with a fence to control access to the event.  \nId., at 413.  According to the plaintiff in that case, when the plaintiff approached \nthe area fenced off for the Pride Fest, he  was told that the p ermit holders for the \nevent “had the exclusive right to use the perm itted area and could exclude anyone \nthey chose.”  Worldwide Street Preachers, at 414.  He was instructed to conduct \nhis First Amendment activity across the street.   Worldwide Street Preachers, at\n414.  Thus, the distance between the fenced  area and the area where plaintiff w as \ntold to engage in his activities truly was a “buffer” to plaintiff’s speech.  However, \nthe Court recognized that the fact that a “buffer zone” existed was not in itself fatal \nto defendants, concluding that “a buffer zone is not per se im proper under the First \nAmendment, but it must be analyzed as a ‘time place and manner restriction.’”   \nWorldwide Street Preachers, at 415.  Because the defendants made no attem pt to \nexplain why the buffer zone had been esta blished, and defendants even denied its \n26\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 38\nexistence,  the Court concluded that the zone violated the First Amend ment.  \nWorldwide Street Preachers, at 415.\nTwo critical factual distinctions exist between  Worldwide Street Preachers’ \nand  the instant case that cause the instant case to fall outside the am bit  of \nWorldwide Street Preachers.  First, as will be detaile d within the discussion of \nalternative channels of communication, infra, Plaintiff has not been excluded from \nthe Festival.  Second, whereas in Worldwide Street Preachers, there was ambiguity \nabout  whether the “buffer zone” was part of the “perm itted  area” (and the \ndefendants even denied its existence), there is no such ambi guity in the instant \ncase, and it is clear that the “outer perimeter” is part of the Festival boundaries and \nsubject to the same Festival rules and regulations.   \nIn Worldwide Street Preachers,  only a portion of the perm itted area was \nactually fenced off for the event, and the non-fenced area was not in any way being \nused in connection with the Pride Fest, whereas  in the instan t case, the “outer \nperimeter”  is expressly inte nded  to service the Festival.  Indeed, the Festival \norganizers specifically requested that the City establish the  “outer perimeter” to \nmaintain  an area between the core festival activities and the open streets.   \n(Beydoun  dep., p. 40; Mrow ka  dep., p. 15.)  Establishm ent  of this additional \nperimeter  effectively e xpanded  the Festival boundaries, and the perim eter \nultimately was utilized to support the Festival, namely by keeping vehicular traffic \n27\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 39\nat a distance and turning it away on major roads, providing parking for Festival \nemployees and Festival attendees, and establishing parking for the Warren Avenue \nbusinesses  that were adversely im pacted  by the closure of Warren Avenue.   \n(Beydoun  dep., p. 43-44.)  Thus, while  the  “outer perimeter” may not ha ve \nincluded carnival rides, stages, or vendors, that was exactly the point.  Without the  \n“outer  perimeter,” vehicles could have driven right up to the Festival, traffic \nencountering the Fair would inevitably direct itself onto residential streets rather \nthan turning on to the major roads of Schaefer or Wyoming, and there would have \nbeen a logistical problem finding places for Festival workers and for patrons of the \nWarren Avenue businesses to park.  Likewise, as explained during oral argum ent, \nif the instant Plaintiff or any other pamphleteer or vendor was permitted to conduct \nliterature distribution or solicitation activities within the “outer perim eter,” then \nthat opportunity would be necessarily extended to  everybody, and ultimately th e \n“inner perimeter” would be extended to the boundaries of the “outer perimeter.”   \n(MSJ Tr., p. 28.)  This would produce one of two results: either there would be 1) \nabsolutely no separation or sm ooth transition between the outside world and the \n“core”  Festival activities and no ability for the Festival to maintain an area \ndesignated to service the Festival, or 2) a new “outer perimeter” would need to be \nestablished,  and the cycle would begin all over again.  Judge Borman aptly \nsummarized the importance of the “outer perimeter,” stating, \n28\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 40\nIt is crucial to note that this c ase is not just about Plaintiff’s right to \nexercise his First Amendment rights in the outer perimeter; it is about \nthe right of everyone to do so.  That is, if the Court struck down the \nban as unconstitutional, everyone – not just Plaintiff and his associates \n– would be perm itted to distribute lite rature in the outer perimeter.   \nOrganizations of all kinds, businesses, and individuals alike would all \nflock to the outer perimeter to promote their respective interests and  \nmessages.  The consequence of this would be to effectively extend the \nFestival grounds into an area that is meant to serve  as a buffer zone \nbetween  the Festival and the outside world.  This result would \nundermine the legitimate and substantial interest of the city to ‘ensure  \nan orderly and safe transition from  the open streets and the streets \noccupied  by the Festival.’  It is for this reason that a ban o n \nhandbilling in the outer perimeter is narrowly tailored.  A result to the \ncontrary  would severely undercut the City’s substantial interest in \nmaintaining  a safe zone, clear of wall-to-wall Festival crowds, \nbetween the Festival grounds and the outside world.  \nOp., p. 36.\nThe role of the “outer perimeter” and the distinction from  Worldwide Street \nPreachers can be further accentuated by envisioning a “single perimeter” Festival.  \nSuppose,  to avoid confusion over the   boundaries, the Arab Chamb er  chose to  \nremove the barricades constituting the “inner perimeter” but keep all o ther aspects \nof the Festival layout – including the location of the rides, tents, and ancillary \nactivities such as Festival parking – exac tly the same.  Th e result would be the  \nexact same Festival, with each area – including the form er “outer perimeter” – \nserving the Festival in the exact same way.  The only difference would be that, \nwith a single barricaded “perimeter,” the grounds would be solely defined by tha t \nperimeter, and those grounds – whether they be occupied by a Ferris Wheel or a \n29\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 41\nFestival  volunteer’s vehicle – would be   subject to the Festival rules and \nregulations, including regulations regarding the location and manner of literature \ndistribution activity.  This is quite different from  the situation in Worldwide Street \nPreachers, where the “buffer zone” in question was not fenced off, apparently was \nnot  being used in any way to facilitate the Pride Fest, and which even the \ndefendants  could not begin to explain.  As Judge Borman subm itted,  the two \nperimeters of the Festival are analogous to an airport: \nThe inner perimeter is like the main runway, while the outer perimeter \nis like a taxiway which serves the purpose of unimpeded ramp up and \nramp down of traffic speeds into the inner perimeter. \nOp, p. 37. \n  Finally, Plaintiff argues about the size of the outer perimeter, but as Judge  \nBorman  correctly noted, Plaintiff’s description of the oute r  perimeter  as “30 \nblocks” is “misleading because . . . the out er perimeter runs only one block to the \nnorth and south of the inner perimeter and five and four blocks, respectively, to the \nwest and east of the inner pe rimeter.”  (Op. p. 35, n. 16.)  Plaintiff’s argum ent is \nfurther diminished by the fact that, for the 2010 Festival, the Festival boundaries \nwere  expressly expanded “a  block  in either direction, and busine ss  alley to \nbusiness alley.” (MSJ Tr., p. 29.)  Regardless, the fact that the “outer peri meter” is \nas much a part of the Festival as the “inner perimeter”  and is sized to serve the \nlegitimate  interest of traffic   control  and  public safety, ne cessarily  renders \n30\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 42\nPlaintiff’s argument unavailing inasmuch as it is subject to the same the same time, \nplace, manner restrictions as the “inner perimeter.” \nGiven the essential role of the “outer perimeter ” to the Festival as a wh ole, \nJudge Borman correctly concluded that the handbilling ban in the outer perimeter,  \nlike the ban in the inner perimeter, “meets the requirements for a valid time, place, \nand manner restriction on speech.”  (Op ., p. 37.)  Accordingly, Judge Bor man’s \nOrder granting Defendants summary judgment should be upheld. \n4.    The  “inner perimeter,” sidew alks,  and “outer \nperimeter” all comprise a single forum – the Festival. \nPlaintiff invokes Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund,  473 U.S. \n788, 800 (1985) to suggest that the forum should be defined based on “the access \nsought by the speaker.”  (Appellant’s brie f, p. 24.)  Assuming for purposes of this \nbrief that Plaintiff is correct and Plaintiff can define the forum, it does not help him \nin this case, as there is only one forum in play in this case: the Festival.  Plaintiff \nadmits in his brief that he “is not challenging Defendants’ ability to restrict his  \nspeech activity on Warren Avenue or Miller Road – the designated location of the \n“street fair.”  (Appellant’s brief, p. 39.)  Plaintiff’s concession is fatal because, a s \nestablished  above, the “designated location of the ‘street fair’” includes the \nsidewalks and the “outer perimeter.”  Thus, while Plaintiff repeats throughout his \nbrief that he “does not want to attend the Festival,” the reality is that, by seeking to \ndistribute literature on the sidewalks along Warren and M iller Roads or in the \n31\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 43\n“outer  perimeter” – all of which ar e  within the Festival boundaries   – he is\nseeking to participate in the Festival.   Rather than identifying the proper forum, it \nappears that Plaintiff wishes to re-define the boundaries of the forum  by excluding \nthe sidewalks and “outer perimeter,” but that goes against the facts of this case.   \nUltimately,  then, neither the sidewalks nor the “outer perimeter” are a \n“buffer”  to free speech.  On the contrary, the Arab Chamb er  and the City of  \nDearborn have invited Plaintiff to come in to the Festival, m ingle with the crowd, \nand establish an information table like every other organization that seeks access to \nthe  Festival audience.   Consequently,  Plaintiff m ust  abide by the rules and \nregulations set forth by the Arab Chamber that he ad mits the City can enforce \npursuant  to  Heffron and Spingola.   And, pursuant to  Heffron and Spingola, a\nFestival is a limited public forum where regulations need only satisfy intermediate \nscrutiny.\nB. Plaintiff has not suffered an abridgement of his First Amendment \nright to free speech.   \n1. Standards for time, place, and manner regulations. \n“Even protected speech is not equally perm issible in all places at all times.”   \nFrisby v. Schultz,  487 U.S. 474, 479 (1988).  Content-neutral regulations of the \ntime, place, and manner of communicati ve activity are permitted where necessary \nto further significant government interests.  Frisby, at 474, 479.   A content-neutral \nregulation is “justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.”   \n32\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 44\nBoos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 320 (1988).  Even where an ordinance has an effect \non speakers, it is neutral if it “serves purposes unrelated to the content of th e \nexpression.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).\nContent-neutral  regulations a re  evaluated under interm ediate  scrutiny.  \nth\nPhelps-Roper v. Strickland, 539 F.3d 356, 362 (6  Cir. 2008).  The regulation must \n1) serve a significant governm ental interest; 2) be narrowly tailored; and 3) leave \nopen ample alternative channels of communication.   Perry Education Association \nv. Perry Local Educator’s Association et. al, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983).\nSignificant government interests include  protecting public safety during a \nfestival,  ensuring sm ooth  traffic flow, and balancing one ’s  free speech against \nanother’s freedom to be free from hindrance.  Spingola, at 983.\n“A statute is narrowly tailored if it targets and elim inates no more than the \nexact source of the “evil” it seeks to remedy.”   Frisby, at 485.   The m eans of \nregulation need not be the “least restrictive alternative.”  Ward, at 797-798.\nFinally, if a speaker  is able to reach  his “intended audience,” then ample \nalternative  channels of  communication exist.   Phelps-Roper, at  372-373, citing \nth\nPrime Media, Inc. v. City of Franklin,  181 Fed. Appx. 536, 541 (6  Cir. 2006).  \n“Ample  alternative channels” does not guarantee a person his “best m eans  of \ncommunication.”  Phelps-Roper, at 372.\n33\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 45\n2. The handbilling regulations are content-neutral. \nAs explained in the Statement of Fact s, the Arab Chamber requires that all \nindividuals or entities seeking to distribute information within the Festival area fill \nout an application, pay a fee, and limit their activities to a designated location.  The \nregulations were passed without reference to Plaintiff’s spe ech activity, and they \nare expressly intended to prom ote pedestrian traffic and an orderly Festival.  (RE \nNo. 41-15.)  The City’s interest in enforcing the regulations is to keep sidewalks \nflowing and maintain crowd safety (Hadda d dep., p. 18, 35-36; Mrow ka dep., p. \n15), each of which is a legitimate government interest. Heffron, at 651.\nPlaintiff  attempts  to argue that distinctions have been made between \ncommercial and non-commercial speech, but the evidence dem onstrates that no \nsuch content-based decisions were made.  First and forem ost, the sidewalks were \nincorporated into the Festival grounds, and the Arab Chamb er controlled what \noccurred on the sidewalks.   Beydoun explained, “We don’t allow just anybody to \ncome and set up, and they’re not allowed to decide where they want to set up.  We \nhave specific areas for specific things.”  (Beydoun dep., at 33.)   For exam ple, \nthere were numerous themed tents – one  for food, one for artisans, and one for \nchildren’s activities.  (RE No. 41-4.)  The Warren  Avenue businesses constitute  \ntheir own themed area of the Festival, and they are able to take advantage of their \nlocation  by setting up in front of their business, when logistically feasible, \n34\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 46\nregardless  of what their business prom otes.  (Beydoun dep., p. 36.)   \nNotwithstanding this fact, Beydoun stated that entities other than Warren Avenue \nbusinesses might be permitted to distribute in the “sidewalk” area: \nQ:  So some outside organization that didn’t have a business \nalong Warren Avenue and they wanted to put a table . . .   \nalong Warren Avenue within the festival boundarie s, that \nwas not going to be permitted? \nA:  If  they had gone through the festival, com pleted  an \napplication  and went through   the process and if it was \nlogistically feasible, then we would have agreed to it and \nyes, if it did not interfere. \nBeydoun dep., p. 32. \nAgreeing  with the Defendants’ characterization of the Warren Avenue \nbusinesses as their own themed area of the Festival, Judge Borman ruled, \nTo  the ex tent  that Defendant s  enforce the [Arab Cham ber’s]  rule \npermitting occupants of space along Warren Avenue to set up on the \nsidewalk outside their storefronts at the exclusion of those who do not \noccupy space along Warren Avenue, the restriction is not content-\nbased because no expression is being restricted based on ‘its m essage, \nits ideas, its subject matter, or its content.’  See [Police Department of \nthe City of Chicago v.] Mosley, 408 U.S. [92], 95.  Rather Defendants, \nby enforcing the [Arab Chamber’s] rule, are favoring, if anyone, those \nwith space along Warren Avenue no matter who they are or what their \nmessage.   In reality, this is a quid pro quo for stores negatively \nimpacted by the Festival.  In exchange for subjecting them  to Festival \ncrowds in front of their stores and closed-off streets that block regular \ncustomers’ ingress and egress, the existing merchants are permitted to \nset up tables out front to sell their wares.  . . . There is nothing to \nsuggest  that the criterion to set up a sidewalk sale along Warren \nAvenue has anything to do with the m essage of the occupant, or the \nsubject matter of the occupant’s speech (i.e., co mmercial versus non-\ncommercial). \n35\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 47\nOp., p. 31. \n  Plaintiff invokes the existence of this limited sidewalk activity as suggesting \nthat the interest in traffic control and safety is not le gitimate, and to make the bald \nassertion  that the regulations are content-based.  However, again, as noted in \nSpingola, the  question is not whether the regulation cures all obstructions and \npedestrian  flow problem s,  but rather “whether preventing uncontrolled public  \nspeaking in these areas promotes a significant governmental interest that would be \nless effectively achieved without the la w.”  Spingola, at 984. It is sufficient that \nthe rules provide “a smoother flow of traffic within the festival crowd.”   Spingola, \nat 984. Plaintiff alleges it is “obvious” that the City is “purposefully banning \nChristian missionaries from distributing religious literature at an Arab (Muslim ) \nfestival”, but Plaintiff cites no evidence dem onstrating any such “obvious” intent \nor purpose.  On the contrary, the record clearly dem onstrates that the regulations \nwere  adopted  and enforced in a content neutral way, and, m ost  significantly, \nChristians  (including Plaintiff) were allowed to, and actually did, distribute  \nreligious literature at the Arab Festival, subject to the content neutral time, place, \nand manner restrictions allowed under Heffron and Spingola.\nBecause  the  regulations at issue are content-neutral, they should be \nevaluated under intermediate scrutiny. Phelps-Roper, at 372.\n36\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 48\n3. The regulations are narrowly-tailored. \nThe  regulations are enforced in a narrowly-tailored fashion.  The evils \ntargeted by the regulations are pedestrian overcrowding, tra ffic flow, threats to \npublic safety, and disorderliness at the Festival.  Requiring distribution of literature \nfrom fixed locations and enforcing a peri meter around the Festival prevents these \nevils  without restricting people from   mingling with the crowd or distributing \nliterature from a fixed location.  In fact, Plaintiff acknowledges the importance of a \npolice presence, as he asks for a police presence as part of his outreach efforts in  \norder to “keep peace between both side[s].”  (Saieg dep., p. 34.)  The Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan has indicated that, while a complete prohibition on expressive \nactivity that has the effect of removing a speaker from a forum may be enjoined, a \nregulation can be valid when it seeks to \nrestrict  the location of leafleting, limit the time during which \ninformation can be distributed, restrict the size of the brochure s or the \nnumber of leafletters, or otherwise im pose limits on the activity that \nmight address their asserted concerns. \nNorfolk v. Cobo Hall, 543 F. Supp. 2d 701, 711 (E.D. Mich., 2008) \n  Here, the rules and regulations only seek to place materials distribution in a \nfixed location.  Neither the Arab Chamber nor the City has told Plaintiff that he \ncannot bring 90 or m ore people to the Festival and spread throughout the crowd, \nthat he cannot pass out whatever materials he wishes to distribute, nor have they \nrestricted the time during which he can conduct his distribution, and therefore the \n37\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 49\nregulation here is much m ore narrowly tailored than what the Eastern District of \nMichigan has previously contemplated as  being acceptable.  The rules here are \nalso completely distinguishable from the ordinance in Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303\nU.S. 444 (1938), a case relied upon by Plaintiff, where an ordinance required \nanybody seeking to distribute literature anywhere within the city to first obtain a \npermit from the City Manager.   Lovell, at 447, 451.   Here Plaintiff was not \n3\nrequired to obtain perm ission to canvass door-to-door  or engage in any kind of \nspeech activity throughout the City, and he was not required to gain perm ission to \nwalk freely about the crowd at the Festival.  He only was asked to abide by a  \nuniversal rule of the Arab Chamber to confine his distribution activities to a fixed \nlocation within the Festival grounds.  Because this rule is reasonably calculated to \ncure the evils it targeted, it is narrowly-tailored.  Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary \nJudgment and Request for Injunctive Relief should be denied, Defendants’ Motion \nfor  Summary Judgment should be grante d,  and Judge Borm an’s  Opinion a nd \nOrder granting Defendants summary judgment should be affirmed. \n4. Plaintiff  enjoys ample alternative channels of \ncommunication  and is reaching his intended \naudience.\nFinally, Plaintiff has am ple alternative channels of comm unication.  Even \nthough Plaintiff was late in seeking space at the 2009 Festival, the Arab Cham ber \n3 Accordingly, Plaintiff’s reference to Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141 (1943), striking down a prohibition \non door-to-door solicitation, also fails to provide support for Plaintiff’s position. \n38\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 50\nfound a place for him  to set up a booth,  at no charge.  (Mrowka dep., p. 25, 29.)   \nFrom  the booth, Plaintiff distributed materials and discussed his message with \nvisitors.   (RE No. 41-17.)  Additionall y,  Plaintiff and his colleagues spread \nthroughout the crowd to talk with Festival attendees.  (RE No. 41-17.)  Members of \nPlaintiff’s group also held a weekend-long training program at locations including \na  City of Dearborn park, and they w ent  door-to-door throughout Dearborn’s \nresidential neighborhoods.  (Saieg dep., p. 52, 68, 109.)\nth\nPlaintiff cites Bay Area Peace Navy v. United States, 914 F.2d 1224 (9  Cir., \n1990), as proposed controlling authority on the point of alternative channels, but \nthe case is a non-binding decision out of the Ninth Circuit, and is not on point.  Bay\nArea Peace Navy involved a non-profit organization that annually staged a peace-\noriented flotilla, targeted at a group of 3, 000 invited guests who viewed an annual \nNaval parade from a specific location at Aquatic Park Pier.  When the Coast Guard \nimposed a 75-yard safety and security zone around the pier, the peace flotilla could \nnot be observed by the targeted audience.   Bay Area Peace Navy,  at 1226.  The \naudience on the pier also could not be  reached by alternative means because all \nother access to the visitors and the pier was blocked.   Id., at 1228.  In fact, the \nNinth Circuit distinguished the case from Heffron, stating that\nIn Heffron, requiring [ISKCON] to deliver its m essage to state fair \npatrons from a booth did not prevent it from  reaching its audience. . . \nIn contrast, the 75-yard security zone on the water side and the large \ncrowd of the general public on the land side has clearly been shown to \n39\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 51\ninsulate the 3,000 or m ore Fleet Week official invitees on the pier \nfrom  receiving the messag e  of the Peace Navy and other \ndemonstrators. \nBay Area Peace Navy, at 1229-1230. \n  Thus, in Bay Area Peace Navy, the alternative channels were inadeq uate \nbecause there were no alternative channels. \nIn contrast, in the instant case, as recognized by Judge Borman, Plaintiff’s \naudience is not “insulated.”  Plaintiff does not deny that he is reaching his intended \naudience.  He simply argues that conducting his activities from  a booth is not his \npreferred means of communication.  (Saieg dep., p. 75.)  While he also argues that \nthe location of his booth in 2009 (near children’s rides) was not ideal, he adm its \nthat the presence of children would not actually deter him  from approaching adults \nwho are with children.  (Saieg dep., p. 29.)   Plaintiff adm its that the City did not \nprohibit  him from distributing literature, tracts, DVDs, or any other m aterials \nduring the Festival.  (Saieg de p., p. 89, 90, 109.)  Plaintiff likewise has not been \nprohibited  from mingling with the crowd, and extending his outreach into  \nDearborn’s residential neighborhoods and a city pa rk.  While Plaintiff attempts to \nportray a “First Amendment-free zone,” Plaintiff has been freely exercising his \nFirst Amendment rights throughout Dearborn, and only has had to accept m inimal \nregulation of his activities – like every other speaker – where his activities have  \nmerged with those of many other speakers, vendors, and a group of nearly 300,000 \n40\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 52\npeople  converging on a 14-block strip of Warren Avenue during a three-day \nperiod.  The law clearly instructs that Pl aintiff is not entitled to his “best” tim e, \nplace,  and  manner  of expressing hims elf.    Phelps-Roper,  supra,  at  372.  \nNevertheless, for 2010, Plaintiff was offered an even m ore advantageous central \nlocation within the Festival grounds, at a booth that included electricity, at no cost.  \n(MSJ Tr., p. 3, 32.)  Plaintiff has ample alternative means of communication. \n  Because  the regulations at issue are valid time, place, and manner \nrestrictions,  Judge Borman’s Opinion and Order granting  Defendants  summary \njudgment should be upheld.  \nC. The Festival rules and regulations are constitutional, as applied. \nPlaintiff argues that, even if the Festival rules and regulations are de emed \nfacially constitutional, they should be deemed unconstitutiona l as applied, but the \nevidence  demonstrates that the regulations have been enforced in a consistent \nmanner, and apply to all groups seeking access to the Festival.  An as-applied \nchallenge could prevail, for instance, if the regulation burdens more sp eech than \nnecessary to achieve the purpose of the regulation.   Madsen v. Women’s Health \nCenter, Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 771 (1994).  However, as has already been established \nabove, unlike in  Madsen, there is no “buffer” to free speech at the Festival, as \nspeakers are still welcome to mingle with the crowd at all locations, including the  \n“outer perimeter.” Additionally, the requirem ent of distributing literature from a \n41\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 53\nbooth  is narrowly tailored to acco mplish  the goals of reducing pedestrian  \novercrowding, controlling traffic flow, and providing for order and public safety at \nthe Festival. \nTo the ex tent that Plaintiff’s as-app lied challenge i mplicates a char ge of \n“selective enforcement,” Judge Borman also correctly ruled that the evidence did \nnot support a clai m of “selective enforcement.”  The facts  have already clearl y \nestablished, as Judge Bor man noted, that the businesses with tables outside their \nstorefronts were effectively their own themed area of the Festival, and any Warren  \nAvenue storefront was qualified for a table whether it was commercial, nonprofit, \nor religious.  Additionally, Plaintiff provides no specific facts to demonstrate that \nChief Haddad or any other City official authorized a selective enforcement policy, \nbecause there was no such policy.  As demonstrated above, all Festival participants \n–  including other C hristian  groups, Arab   groups,  non-profit organizations, and \ncorporate  entities – were required to obtain a booth to conduct their activities \nwithin the Festival.  Though Plaintiff alleges that the police allowed others to \n4\ndistribute  literature on the sidewalks,   as Judge Bor man  noted, “these four \ninstances, even if true, do not amount to ‘a pattern of enforcement activity evincing \na governmental . . . custom of intentional discrimination on the basis of viewpoint \n4 Though Plaintiff asserte d in an affi davit that the po lice allowed sidewalk distribution to  occur, he did not  \nconclusively state that he saw police allowing it to occur.   However, as Judge Borman noted, even if everything \nPlaintiff states is true, it still does not amount to a policy of selective enforcement. \n42\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 54\nrd\nor content.’”  (Op., p. 42, citing Brown v. City of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d 263, 294 (3\nCir., 2009).) \nUltimately, because the Festival regulations regarding handbilling constitute \nclear standards, they do not burden more speech  than necessary to achieve their \nstated goals, and all speakers who wish to participate in the Festival are bound by \nthe regulations, Plaintiff’s as-applied challenge necessarily fails.  There has been \nno selective enforcement and, accordingly, no unconstitutional application of the  \nregulations  against Plaintiff.  Judge Borman’s Opinion and Order granting \nDefendants summary judgment should be upheld. \nIII. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT PLAINTIFF’S \nFREEDOM TO ASSOCIATE HAS NOT BEEN RESTRICTED. \nCount  II of Plaintiff’s Com plaint  alleges infringem ent  of his First \nAmendment right to freedom  of association, as applied to the states through the \nFourteenth  Amendment.   Freedom of association rights can be summarized as \nfalling into one of two categories: 1) the State is not to intrude in an individual’s \ndecision to “enter into and m aintain certain intimate human relationships,” and 2) \nan individual has a right to “associate for the purpose of engaging in” activities \nprotected by the First Amendment.   Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees,  468 U.S. 609, 617-\n618 (1984).   An infringem ent of freedom of association m ay occur, for example, \nwhen the government “imposes penalties or withhold[s] benefits from individuals \nbecause of their membership in a disfavored group,” requires disclosure of the \n43\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 55\nmembers of an anonym ous group, or requires that the group accept mem bers it \ndoes not desire.  Roberts, at 622-623.  Where freedom of association is implicated, \nthe government action must serve a compelling state interest.  Roberts, at 623-624. \nThe  regulations and enforcement activities at issue in this case do not \nimplicate Plaintiff’s right to freely associate.  Nobody from  the Arab Chamber or \nthe  City prevented Plaintiff from   being a memb er  of the Arabic Christian \nPerspective organization or any other missionary organization, nor w as Plaintiff \ntold that he could not bring his group of approximately 90 people to conduct a \ntraining program, go door-to-door throughout the City of Dearborn, or establish a \nbooth and mingle with Festival attendees.  Likewise, Plaintiff was not prohibite d \nfrom  seeking out additional like-m inded  people through these means, nor was \nPlaintiff required to associate with anybody who did not em brace his message.  \nPlaintiff’s brief is devoid of specific facts supporting his freedom  of association \nclaim, and no evidence exists in the record to support this claim.  Likewise, when \nmoving beyond the general legal principles highlighted in Plaintiff’s brief, and \nevaluating Plaintiff’s claim in light of the full set of standards set forth in  Roberts,\nit is clear that his claim  is not supported.  Because there has been no governm ent \nviolation of Plaintiff’s freedom to associate, Judge Borm an correctly dismissed \nCount II of Plaintiff’s Complaint, finding that “here, the government is not forcing \nPlaintiff to do anything.”  (Op., p. 38.) \n44\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 56\nIV. THE  DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY DETERMINED THAT \nPLAINTIFF HAS NOT SUFFERED A VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHTS \nUNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE. \nJudge Borman ruled that Plaintiff’s  free exercise claim was abandoned for \nfailure to set forth specific facts dem onstrating a material issue of fact in response \nto  Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgm ent.  (Op., p. 38, citing  Guarino  v. \nth\nBrookfield  Twp. Trustees,  980  F.2d 399, 405 (6   Cir., 1992).)  Accordingly,  \nPlaintiff’s free exercise count should continue to be deemed abandoned, and Judge \nBorman’s Opinion and Order should be upheld. \nAlternatively, assuming for purposes of this brief that the free exercise claim \nis not abandoned, it was properly dism issed on the merits.  (Op., p. 38.)  Where a \nlaw is “neutral and of general applicability,” the law does not need to be justified  \nby a compelling governmental interest even if it has an incidental effect on the \nexercise of a religious practice.   Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHiaeleah, 508  U.S. 520, 531 (1993).  An individual’s religious beliefs do not \nexcuse him from his obligation to comply with a valid law prohibiting conduct that \nthe state is free to regulate.  Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878-879 \n(1990).  A law will not be considered neutral if the “object of the law, whether \novert or hidden,” is to interfere with religious practice.   Mount Elliott Cemetery \nth\nAssociation v. City of Troy, 171 F.3d 398, 405 (6  Cir. 1999).  The courts generally \ndo not strike down a law solely on free exercise grounds, but rather must find a \n45\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 57\nviolation of a hybrid right – e.g., free exercise plus free speech.   Smith, at 881.  \nLaws deemed to be neutral and of general applicability  include a zoning ordinance \nenforced against a Catholic cemetery (Mount Elliott Cemetery Assoc., at 405), and \ndenial of tax exemptions to members of the Amish religion who did not believe in  \nparticipating in governmental support programs (U.S. v. Lee,  455 U.S. 252, 258-\n261 (1982)). \nThe  regulation involved in this case is a content-neutral law of general \napplicability that does not infringe on Plaintiff’s free exercise or a hybrid right.  As \ndemonstrated, supra, the regulations at issue were enacted prior to, and without \nreference to, Plaintiff’s speech or religion, thus making them content-neutral and  \ngenerally applicable.  More over, the regulations have been applied uniform ly to \nChristian groups, Arabic groups, and non-religious groups.  A dditionally, as noted \nby Judge Borman, there is no evidence that the City prohibited activity required by \nPlaintiff’s religion, required activity prohibited by Plaintiff’s religion, or otherwise \nburdened  Plaintiff’s religious observations.  (Op., p. 38-39.)  Significantly,  \nPlaintiff has not suffered a violation of his rights to free speech or free association,  \nthus negating the key com ponent of his asserted hybrid right.  Judge Borman’s \nOpinion and Order granting Defendants summary judgment should be upheld. \n46\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 58\nV. THE  DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY HELD THAT TH E \nFESTIVAL RULES AND REGULATI ONS DO NOT VI OLATE THE \nEQUAL  PROTECTION CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT.\n  As recognized by Judge Borman, Plaintiff’s equal protection claim  must fail \ninasmuch as the r egulations are content-neutral and no action has been taken by \nDefendants to favor one form of speech over another.  (Op., p. 31 n. 15.)  Plaintiff \ncites Police Department of the City of Chicago v. Mosley,  408 U.S. 92 (1972);  \nhowever,  that case involved a very different scenario where a city ordinance \nprohibited  all picketing at schools during designated tim es  of the day, except \n“peaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute.”  Mosley, at 92.  The \nordinance  was subject to evaluation for co mpliance  with the Equal Protection \nClause  because it specifically   treated o ne  class of picketers differently from \nanother.  Mosley, at 94-95.  Rather than being a time, place, manner restriction, the \nChicago ordinance was a subject matter restriction.   Mosley, at 99.  The ordinance \nwas deemed unconstitutional since it imposed a “selective restriction on expressive \nconduct” that exceeded what was necessary to advance a significant government \ninterest. Mosley, at 101. \n   The regulation at issue in the  instant case is not comparable to Mosley, as it \ndoes  not discrim inate  between different types of handbilling, is not based on  \nsubject matter, and is applie d in a consistent man ner that requires all speakers at \nthe Festival to distribute literature from  fixed locations.  Because the regulation is \n47\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 59\ncontent-neutral and enforced in a content-neutral manner, it does not violate the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.  Judge  \nBorman correctly dismissed Plaintiff’s Equal Protection claim, and h is Opinion \nand Order should be affirmed. \nVI. THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY RULED THAT DEFENDANT \nDEARBORN IS NOT LIABLE UNDER 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nPlaintiff asserts municipal liability under 42 U.S.C.  §1983 for all causes  of \naction.  A m unicipality can be held  liable under §1983 only if “the municipality  \nitself causes  the [alleged ]  constitutional  violation at issue.”   City  of Canton v. \nHarris, 489 U.S. 378, 385 (1989), citing  Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social \nServices, 436  U.S. 658 (1978).  The plaintiff m ust  demonstrate  that the \nmunicipality, through its deliberate conduct, “was the ‘m oving force’ behind the  \ninjury alleged” – i.e., there must be a “direct cau sal link between the municipal \naction  and  the [al leged]  deprivation  of federal rights.”   Board  of County  \nCommissioners v. Brown,  520 U.S. 397, 404 (1997).  Specifically, the plaintiff \nmust show a custom or policy of the legislative body or officials acting on behalf \nof the municipality that results in the alleged constitutional deprivation.  Brown, at\n403-404.   A m unicipality  cannot be held liable merely because it em ploys  an \nalleged tortfeasor. Brown, at 403. \nIn  the instant case, Plaintiff fails to assert a viable clai m  for municipal \nliability because his constitutional rights have not been deprived and there is no \n48\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 60\nmunicipal custom or policy at issue.  As clearly explained above, the regulation a t \nissue  was prom ulgated  by the Arab Cham ber.   Neither the City Council, the \nDearborn Police Department, Chief Haddad, Sgt. Mrowka, or any other individual \nor body affiliated with the City of Dearborn designed or endorsed the Festival rules \nor regulations.  To the extent the City  enforced the regulations, it did so only to \npursue the City’s legitimate interests in crowd control and public safety.\nFar from denying Plaintiff’s First Amendment rights, Defendants  supported\nPlaintiff’s effort to bring his message to the Arab Festiv al.  Despite the fact that \nPlaintiff was late in applying for a booth, Sgt. Mrowka worked with Plaintiff to \nfind a place to set up a table within the Festival.  Plaintiff was also allowed to  \nparticipate in the Festival without paying the application fee.  Additionally, the  \nDearborn  Police Department assisted Plaintiff’s group throughout the Festival, \nincluding fielding concerns that were brought by A CP-affiliated individuals to the \nofficers stationed at the police command post.  (Mrowka dep., p. 31.)  For the 2010 \nFestival, the City again offered Plaintiff a prime location within the Artesian Tent, \nfor no fee.  (RE No. 56.)\nTo the extent that Plaintiff’s municipal liability claim  implicates allegations \nof selective enforcement, these likewise fail for the reasons stated in the discussion \nregarding Plaintiff’s as-applied challenge, discussed in Section II-C, supra.\n49\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 61\nBecause there was no constitutional violation and no selective enforcement, \nPlaintiff cannot demonstrate that the City was a “ moving force” behind any form  \nof  constitutional violation.  Defendant Dearborn is not lia ble  under 42 U.S.C. \n§1983, and summary judgment was properly granted in its favor.\nVII. THE  DISTRICT COURT PR OPERLY  EXERCISED ITS  \nDISCRETION IN DENYING PLAINTIFF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \nJudge Borman did not abuse his discretion in denying Plaintiff’s request for \ninjunctive relief.  First and foremost, inasmuch as Plaintiff did not and cannot state \na constitutional violation, he has not succeeded on the merits, and his request for \ninjunctive  relief necessarily fails.  For the reasons stated above,  Heffron and\nSpingola control  the instant case, and Judge Borm an  did not com mit  error in \nmaking  his legal conclusions.  Additi onally,  Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a  \ncontinuing injury, as the facts have clearly demonstrate that he has been invited to  \nparticipate  in the Festival at a booth like every other individual that seeks to  \ndistribute  materials at the Festival, and he has am ple  alternative  channels of \ncommunication, including the opportunity to  walk around the Festival to interact \nwith Festival attendees.\nIf an injunction were to be issued, the public interest would be significantly \nharmed.  If Plaintiff was allowed to distribute materials anywhere in the inner or \nouter perimeter, then it will be necessary to afford all other speakers the same \nopportunity.  This would extend the Festival boundaries, and the City would not be \n50\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 62\nallowed to maintain a barrier between the Festival and open streets.  Moreover, due \nto the increased congestion, public safety would be at risk.  Significantly, allowing \nspeakers  carte blanche to dictate the means of their activity would im peril \nestablished case law stating that speakers are not entitled to their best m eans of \ncommunication and that governments can establish content-neutral time, place, and \nmanner regulations of speech.  Because Plaintiff cannot satisfy any of the elements \nfor  an injunction, his request for injunctive relief was properly denied, and \nsummary judgment was properly granted to Defendants.  Judge Borman’s Opinion \nand Order should be affirmed. \n51\n\nCase: 10-1746   Document: 006110726290   Filed: 09/07/2010   Page: 63\nCONCLUSION & REQUEST FOR RELIEF\n  For  these reasons, Defendants City of Dearborn and Ronald Haddad \nrespectfully request that this Honorable Court affirm  the District Court’s Order \ndated June 7, 2010 denying Plaintiffs’ Motion for Summary Judgment and granting \nDefendant’s  Motion for Sum mary  Judgment, and dism iss  Plaintiff’s appeal, \ntogether with costs, attorney fees, and any other relief deemed appropriate. \nRespectfully submitted, \n       ____s/  LAURIE M.
