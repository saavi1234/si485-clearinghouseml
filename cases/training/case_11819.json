    "summary": "<p>On July 30, 2003, Plaintiff, a male inmate suffering from Gender Dysphoria (\"GD\") confined by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"), filed a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Division. Although the complaint was originally filed pro se, Plaintiff was later represented by counsel appointed by the court. When the Third Amended Complaint was filed on July 13, 2007, Plaintiff was housed at the Wisconsin Resource Center (\"WRC\"), a Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (\"DHFS\") facility for inmates with mental health needs. Plaintiff named all employees and/or officials of DOC and DHFS as Defendants. Plaintiff claimed that Defendants were inadequately treating his GD in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. </p><p>For the violation of his Eighth Amendment rights, Plaintiff sought injunctive relief for the following: (1) enjoining Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office from providing medical care and treatment to Plaintiff that is inconsistent with the standards of medical care and treatment for GD in the State of Wisconsin as a whole; (2) enjoining Defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office from refusing to provide and delaying provision of necessary medical treatment and care for GID to Plaintiff either at suitable and adequate facilities within the WRC or elsewhere; (3) enjoining Defendants and their successors in office from failing to instruct, supervise and train their employees and agents in such a manner as to assure the delivery of medical treatment and care to Pplaintiff which is consistent with the standards of medical care in the State of Wisconsin as a whole; and (4) that the court establish a panel of independent medical experts to regularly evaluate the delivery of medical treatment and care administered to Plaintiff and insure the compliance of Defendants and their successors in office with the court's orders.</p><p>On January 17, 2006, Plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order ('TRO\") and preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from stopping Plaintiff's hormonal therapy. According to Plaintiff's brief and declarations by his doctor and one of his attorneys, Plaintiff had been receiving female hormonal and anti-adrogen therapy since 1999 for treatment of GD. Plaintiff argued that Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m), enacted on January 6, 2006, also known as the \"Inmate Sex Change Prevention Act,\" would become effective on January 24, 2006, and that pursuant to the statute, Defendants would begin reducing Plaintiff's hormone therapy with the intention of eventually stopping it completely. The papers supporting the motion added that all of Plaintiff's endocrine functions and organ systems would be affected by cessation of the therapy. Further, they maintained that Plaintiff's depression would become more acute, blood pressure would rise and suicide ideation would accelerate. Consequently, Plaintiff concluded that the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Ex Post Facto Clause of article I, section 10 of the U.S. Constitution supported injunctive relief and entry of an order barring Defendants from terminating Plaintiff's hormonal therapy.</p><p>On January 20, 2006, in an unpublished order, Judge Charles N. Clevert, Jr. granted Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. </p><p>On February 08, 2008, Defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment. On March 31, 2010, Judge Clevert granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment. Judge Clevert further ordered that Plaintiff's request that only female correctional officers conduct any future strip searches of Plaintiff was denied. In a decision issued on May 10, 2010, Judge Clevert concluded that no reasonable jury could find that Defendants had been deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff's medical needs in regard to strip searches, and therefore summary judgment was granted as to this issue; however, as to all other issues raised in Defendants' summary judgment motion, summary judgment was denied.</p><p>In July 2010, Judge Clevert referred the case to Magistrate Judge Patricia J. Gorence for mediation. On December 27, 2010, Judge Clevert approved the parties' Settlement Agreement which provides, among other things, DOC will continue Plaintiff's hormone therapy consistent with state law, unless such therapy is medically contraindicated or the plaintiff agrees to the cessation of such therapy. On the same day, the court also denied Plaintiff's motion to reopen the case and dismissed the case.</p><p>Plaintiff appealed the District Court's grant of partial summary judgment to the Seventh Circuit as a pro se appellant. However, because Plaintiff failed to pay the required docketing fee within the statutory period, the appeal was dismissed on June 02, 2011.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\nDONNA DAWN KONITZER\na/k/a Scott Konitzer, \nPlaintiff,\nv.  Case No. 03-C-717 \nMATTHEW J. FRANK, TOM MICHLOWSKI,\nMARIO CANZIANI, SHARON ZUNKER,\nTOM SPEECH, DAVID BURNETT,\nand BYRAN BARTOW, \nDefendants.\nDECISION ON GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART DEFENDANTS'\nMOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT (DOC. # 155)\nPlaintiff1, an inmate at the Wisconsin Resource Center (WRC), is proceeding\non a Third Amended Complaint, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331, 1343(a)(3) and (4), and\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, claiming the defendants are violating rights secured to the plaintiff by\nthe Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.  The Third Amended Complaint\ncharges that the defendants are subjecting the plaintiff to cruel and unusual punishment\nby failing to administer proper treatment for the plaintiffโs Gender Identity Disorder (\"GID\")\nand is seeking an order: \n1Konitzer is a male-to-female transsexual who has been prescribed feminizing hormones for\nseveral years and feels like a woman trapped in a man's body. While the court recognizes that this action\nwas filed by Konitzer under the apparent chosen name of Donna Dawn, Konitzer remains a biological\nmale. Therefore, for clarity, this decision will utilize male pronouns where appropriate, although the court is\nsensitive to Konitzer's preference.\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 1 of 68   Document 238 \n\n(1)  enjoining the defendants, their employees, agents and successors in\noffice from providing medical care and treatment to the plaintiff that is inconsistent with the\nstandards of medical care and treatment for GID in the State of Wisconsin as a whole;\n(2) enjoining the defendants, their employees, agents and successors in\noffice from refusing to provide and delaying provision of necessary medical treatment and\ncare for GID to the plaintiff either at suitable and adequate facilities within the WRC or\nelsewhere; \n(3) enjoining the defendants, their employees, agents and successors in\noffice from failing to instruct, supervise and train their employees and agents in such a\nmanner as to assure the delivery of medical treatment and care to the plaintiff which is\nconsistent with the standards of medical care in the State of Wisconsin as a whole;\n(4) establishing an independent panel of medical experts to regularly\nevaluate the delivery of medical treatment and care to the plaintiff and ensuring compliance\nwith court orders respecting this matter; and\n(5) awarding the costs and expenses of this action. \nThe defendants disagree and are asking for partial summary judgment\ndismissing all but one of the plaintiffโs claims for injunctive relief.\nI.  STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\nSummary  judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\nto a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); see also Anderson v. Liberty\nLobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986);\n2\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 2 of 68   Document 238 \n\nMcNeal v. Macht, 763 F. Supp. 1458, 1460-61 (E.D. Wis. 1991).  \"Material facts\" are those\nfacts that, under the applicable substantive law, \"might affect the outcome of the suit.\"  See\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 248.  A dispute of \"material fact\" is \"genuine\" if \"the evidence is\nsuch that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\" Id.\nThe burden of showing the needlessness of trialโ(1) the absence of a\ngenuine issue of material fact; and (2) an entitlement to judgment as a matter of lawโis\nupon the moving party.  However, when the opponent is the party with the ultimate burden\nof proof at trial, that party retains its burden of producing evidence which would support a\nreasonable jury verdict. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 267; see also Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at\n324 (stating that \"proper\" summary judgment motion may be \"opposed by any of the kinds\nof evidentiary materials listed in Rule 56(c), except the mere pleadings\"). \"Rule 56(c)\nmandates the entry of summary judgment, . . . upon motion, against a party who fails to\nestablish the existence of an element essential to that party's case and on which that party\nwill bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322.\nIn evaluating a motion for summary judgment, courts draw all inferences in\na light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Johnson v. Pelker, 891 F .2d 136, 138 (7th\nCir. 1989).  \"However, we are not required to draw every conceivable inference from the\nrecordโonly those inferences that are reasonable.\" Bank Leumi Le-Israel, B.M. v. Lee,\n928 F.2d 232, 236 (7th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted).\nII.  RELEVANT UNDISPUTED FACTS2\n2 Facts are taken from the July 15, 2005 Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact and February 28,\n2006 Amendment to Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact, both of which are cited as \"DFOF\". Facts are\nalso taken from the October 3, 2005 Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact, the April 28, 2006 Amended\nand Additional Proposed Findings of Fact, and the November 28, 2006 Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of\nFact in Support of Surreply in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, all of which are\n3\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 3 of 68   Document 238 \n\nA.  Background\nKonitzer was first committed to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections\n(DOC) in April 1982. (DFOF ยถ 1.)  Between April 1982 and May 1993, Konitzer was housed\nin  several  DOC  correctional  institutions,  having  been  released  on  three  separate\noccasions. (DFOF ยถ 2.)  He escaped from custody in May 1991, and was unaccountable\nuntil being captured on May 28, 1991. Id.  Konitzer's most recent period of incarceration\nbegan December 20, 1994, following a conviction on three counts of armed robbery\nmasked; three counts of armed robbery; one count of armed robberyโrepeater; and one\ncount of possession of a firearm by a felon. (DFOF ยถ 3.)  He is serving a 128-year\nsentence and is eligible for parole on June 10, 2026. (DFOF ยถ 4.)  Konitzer's maximum\nrelease date is February 9, 2081, whereas his maximum discharge date is June 11, 2122.\nId. \nAt an early age, Konitzer did not feel comfortable as a biological male. (PFOF\nยถ 34.)  Often, he would dress in his sister's clothes and wear his mother's makeup. Id.\nMost of the time, Konitzer kept his discomfort about his body to himself. (PFOF ยถ 35.)\nWhen he told his parents that he felt like a girl, his stepfather tried to convince him\notherwise and beat him when that failed.  Id.\nWhile serving a previous sentence, Konitzer told prison psychiatrists that he\nbelieved he was a transsexual.  Id.  A February 13, 1988, clinical dictation by Pauline\nThome states:\nMr.  Konitzer  was  found  guilty  of  making  a  weapon.  He\nappealed but the appeal was denied. During the appeal, he\ncited as \"PFOF\". \n4\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 4 of 68   Document 238 \n\nsaid he was making a weapon to disguise the fact that he was\nmaking stockings for himself with the shirts. By admitting what\nhe was doing, Mr. Konitzer broke a 10 year secret about his\ntranssexualism. Mr. Konitzer does not experience a conflict\nabout his sexual identity, only a conflict about bringing it out in\nthe open. He feels extremely threatened by the possibility that\nother inmates will know about his transsexual behavior, and his\nhomosexual inclination.\n (PFOF ยถ 37, Cothroll Decl. ยถ 4, Ex. 208, Bates No. 2668-69.)\nIn 1993, Konitzer began seeking treatment for GID at Pathways Counseling\nCenter in Milwaukee. (PFOF ยถ 38.)  Pathways evaluated Konitzer and determined that he\nsuffered from GID, placed him in group therapy, and referred him for hormone therapy. Id.\nDuring that time, Konitzer began referring to himself as Donna, initiated electrolysis,\ndressed as a woman, and sought relationships with friends who supported his belief that\nhe was a woman. Id.\nAbout three months into the hormone therapy, Konitzer was introduced to\ncocaine by a friend, Kelly Stark. (PFOF ยถ 40.)  Stark pressured Konitzer to quit hormone\ntherapy in hopes of an intimate relationship with her. Id.  Addicted to cocaine, Konitzer\nceased taking his female hormones and stopped attending therapy sessions at Pathways,\nthereby causing his female development to end. (PFOF ยถ 41.)  While on cocaine, Konitzer\ncommitted several crimes which led to his arrest in June 1994 and the sentence he is now\nserving. (PFOF ยถ 42.)\nKonitzer has been housed at various DOC correctional institutions, including\nDodge Correctional Institution (DCI), Waupun Correctional Institution (WCI), Green Bay\nCorrectional Institution (GBCI), the Wisconsin Resource Center (WRC), and Columbia\nCorrectional Institution (CCI). (DFOFยถ 7.)  While incarcerated at GBCI, Konitzer used a\n5\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 5 of 68   Document 238 \n\nrazor blade to cut open his scrotal tissue, leaving one testicle exposed and losing a lot of\nblood. (DFOF ยถ 47.)  On September 5, 2002, he was moved to the WRC due to\ndisfigurement attempts involving use of a nail clipper to wound his scrotum. (DFOF ยถ 10.)\nThe WRC is part of the Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS),\nDivision of Disability and Elder Services and provides mental health treatment to the DOC\ninmates as its primary mission. (DFOF ยถ 12-13.)  The DOC and the DHFS employees work\nat the WRC. (DFOF ยถ 14.)  The DOC employees include security staff, namely, the\ncaptains, the sergeants, and the correctional officers.\nDefendant Byran Bartow has been employed by the DHFS as Director of the\nWRC since approximately March 28, 2000. (DFOF ยถ 15.)  As Director, Bartow manages\nthe WRC. (DFOF ยถ 16.)  He is involved in policy making and signs all the WRC policies\nand procedures, including those related to treatment.  Defendant Mario Canziani has been\nemployed by the DHFS as the WRC Security Director since August 1996. (DFOF ยถ 17.)\nThere are approximately 344 DOC inmates housed in the WRC for mental\nhealth care programs, and 60 patients detained or committed as sexually violent persons\nunder Wis. Stat. Chapter 980. (DFOF ยถ 18.)  Only male inmates and patients are housed\nat the WRC. (DFOF ยถ 19.)  Typically, inmates are transferred to the WRC when they\nexhibit  mental  health  problems  in  the  prison  environment,  such  as  withdrawn  or\nunresponsive demeanor and adjustment difficulties, including suicide attempts. (DFOF ยถ\n20.)  The DOC is required to provide the WRC with referral information, but there are no\nstrict diagnostic criteria required of the DOC inmates transferred to the WRC. (DFOF ยถ\n21.)  The WRC conducts intake and does an assessment of new inmates, which includes\n6\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 6 of 68   Document 238 \n\nmedication review and psychiatric evaluations. (DFOF ยถ  22.)  Inmates are then placed in\na program or series of programs which staff believe best meet their needs. \nThe DOC does not establish policies at the WRC, but the WRC adheres to\nthe DOC's policies and administrative rules, except when the issue is central to the mental\nhealth care of the inmates housed at the WRC. (DFOF ยถ 23.)  Eventually, most inmates\nat the WRC are transitioned back to the DOC. (DFOF ยถ  24.)  The WRC administrators\nbelieve it is in the best interests of inmates that they are treated no differently at the WRC\nthan they would be at the DOC because consistent treatment makes it easier for the\ninmate to transition back into the DOC.  Also, they believe that if inmates were treated\ndifferently, other inmates may be encouraged to seek transfers to the WRC by acting out\nin a manner that would facilitate their transfer to the WRC and delay their return to the\nDOC. Thus, the WRC attempts to maintain as much of a prison environment as possible\nfor safety, as well as for treatment and inmate management. (DFOF ยถ  26.)\nB.  Gender Identity Disorder\nThe DOC diagnosed Konitzer with GID in December 1999 and the DOC has\nprescribed hormone therapy since that date. (PFOF ยถ 2; DFOF ยถ 28; DFOF ยถยถ 210-303.)\nKonitzer feels \"trapped in the wrong body.\" (PFOF ยถ  3.)  The disconnect between\nKonitzer's male body and his female identity causes him a great deal of stress, and he has\nbeen diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. (PFOF ยถ  4.)  To relieve this stress,\nKonitzer has tried to live as a female while in prison. Id.\nGID is a rare disorder with an approximate incidence between 1 in 11,900 to\n45,000 in males and 1 in 30,000 to 100,000 in females. (PFOF ยถ  6.)  Persons with GID are\nuncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in society, as a member of their\n7\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 7 of 68   Document 238 \n\ndesignated sex. (PFOF ยถ 5.)  Some persons with GID seek hormonal and surgical\ntreatments to alleviate their discordance. Id.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (\"DSM-IV\"), is a manual\nthat lists various mental health conditions and is used to standardize diagnoses and to\nprovide a reference point respecting diagnoses, including GID. (PFOF ยถยถ  14-15.)  The\nDSM-IV defines GID as: (1) A strong and persistent cross-identification (not merely a\ndesire  for any  perceived  cultural advantage  of  being  the other  sex) manifested  by\nsymptoms such as a stated desire to be the other sex, frequent passing as the other sex,\ndesire to live or be treated as the other sex, or the conviction that he or she has the typical\nfeelings and reactions of the other sex; (2) Persistent discomfort with his or her sex or\nsense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex manifested by symptoms such\nas preoccupation with getting rid of primary and secondary sex characteristics (e.g.,\nrequest  for  hormones,  surgery,  or  other  procedures  to  physically  alter  sexual\ncharacteristics to simulate the other sex) or belief that he or she was born the wrong sex;\n(3) The disturbance is not concurrent with a physical intersex condition; and (4) The\ndisturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning. (PFOF ยถ  16.)\nThe DSM-IV sub-classifies a GID patient by the patient's sexual preference\nas attracted to males, attracted to females, attracted to both, or attracted to neither. (PFOF\nยถ  17.)  The sub-classification was intended to assist in determining, over time, whether\nindividuals of one sexual orientation or another experienced better outcomes using\nparticular therapeutic approaches; it was not intended to guide treatment decisions. (PFOF\nยถ 18.)  Id.\n8\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 8 of 68   Document 238 \n\nThe Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards\nof Care for Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version, February 2001 (\"Standards of Care\")3,\nprovide in relevant part:\nThe Purpose of the Standards of Care. The major purpose of\nthe Standards of Care (SOC) is to articulate this international\norganization's professional consensus about the psychiatric,\npsychological, medical, and surgical management of gender\nidentity disorder. Professionals may use this document to\nunderstand  the  parameters  within  which  they  may  offer\nassistance to those with these conditions. Persons with gender\nidentity disorders, their families, and social institutions may use\nthe SOC to understand the current thinking of professionals.\nAll readers should be aware of the limitations of knowledge in\nthis area and of the hope that some of the clinical uncertainties\nwill be resolved in the future through scientific investigation. \nThe  Overarching  Treatment  Goal.  The  general  goal  of\npsychotherapeutic, endocrine, or surgical therapy for persons\nwith gender identity disorders is lasting personal comfort with\nthe gendered self in order to maximize overall psychological\nwell-being and self-fulfillment.\nThe Standards of Care Are Clinical Guidelines. The SOC\nare intended to provide flexible directions for the treatment of\npersons  with  gender  identity  disorders.  When  eligibility\nrequirements  are  stated  they  are  meant  to  be  minimum\nrequirements. Individual professionals and organized programs\nmay modify them. Clinical departures from these guidelines\nmay come about because of a patient's unique anatomic,\n3 The parties dispute the relevance of the Standards of Care to the professional treatment of\nindividuals with GID. According to the defendants, the Standards of Care provide guidelines that have\nbeen helpful in professionalizing the treatment of GID. (DFOF ยถ  30.) The defendants further assert that\nthe Standards of Care have no regulatory authority and there is not universal consensus in the psychiatric\ncommunity about what constitutes \"the\" treatment for GID or what constitutes medical necessity in the\ntreatment of GID. (DFOF ยถยถ 31-32.) \nThe plaintiff disputes that the Standards of Care are merely helpful guidelines. According to\nKonitzer, the Standards of Care were designed to present professional consensus about psychiatric,\nmedical, and surgical management of gender conditionsโreferred to as the \"Triadic Treatmentโโand the\nparameters within which professionals could offer services to individuals. (PFOF ยถ  20.) Typically, the\nTriadic Therapy takes place in the order of: 1) hormones, 2) real-life experience, and 3) surgery. (PFOF ยถ\n24.)  A GID patient, however, may undergo a variety of different therapeutic options because clinicians\nrecognize that not all persons with GID need or want all three elements of Triadic Therapy. (PFOF ยถ  25.) \n9\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 9 of 68   Document 238 \n\nsocial,  or  psychological  situation,  an  experienced\nprofessional's  evolving  method  of  handling  a  common\nsituation, or a research protocol. These departures should be\nrecognized as such, explained to the patient, and documented\nboth for legal protection and so that the short and long term\nresults can be retrieved to help the field to evolve.\nThe Clinical Threshold. A clinical threshold is passed when\nconcerns, uncertainties, and questions about gender identity\npersist during a person's development, become so intense as\nto seem to be the most important aspect of a person's life, or\nprevent the establishment of a relatively unconflicted gender\nidentity. The person's struggles are then variously informally\nreferred to as a gender identity problem, gender dysphoria, a\ngender problem, a gender concern, gender distress, gender\nconflict, or transsexualism. Such struggles are known to occur\nfrom the preschool years to old age and have many alternate\nforms.  These  reflect  various  degrees  of  personal\ndissatisfaction  with  sexual  identity,  sex  and  gender\ndemarcating  body  characteristics,  gender  roles,  gender\nidentity,  and  the perceptions  of  others. When  dissatisfied\nindividuals  meet  specified  criteria  in  one  of  two  official\nnomenclatures  - the International Classification of Diseases\n10 (ICD-10) or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders  -  Fourth  Edition  (DSM-IV)  they  are  formally\ndesignated as suffering from a gender identity disorder (GID).\nSome  persons  with  GID exceed another  threshold  -  they\npersistently possess a wish for surgical transformation of their\nbodies.\nTwo Primary Populations with GID Exist - Biological Males\nand Biological Females. The sex of a patient always is a\nsignificant factor in the management of GID. Clinicians need to\nseparately consider the biologic, social, psychological, and\neconomic dilemmas of each sex. All patients, however, should\nfollow the SOC. \n. . . .\nAfter the diagnosis of GID is made the therapeutic approach\nusually includes three elements or phases (sometimes labeled\ntriadic therapy): a real-life experience in the desired role,\nhormones of the desired gender, and surgery to change the\ngenitalia and other sex characteristics. \n10\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 10 of 68   Document 238 \n\n. . . .\nMany persons with GID will desire all three elements of triadic\ntherapy. Typically, triadic therapy takes place in the order of\nhormones => real-life experience => surgery, or sometimes:\nreal-life experience => hormones => surgery.\n. . . .\nHowever, the diagnosis of GID invites the consideration of a\nvariety  of  therapeutic  options,  only  one  of  which  is  the\ncomplete  therapeutic  triad.  Clinicians  have  increasingly\nbecome  aware  that  not  all  persons  with  gender  identity\ndisorders need or want all three elements of triadic therapy.\n(George Daley Dep., Sept. 10, 2004, Ex. 12, Bates No. 5478-80.)\nWhen Konitzer's current period of incarceration began, he did not have any\nfemale development. (PFOF ยถ 43.)  Following his convictions, Konitzer's gender dysphoria\ndid not subside, and his distress worsened because he was living as a male. (PFOF ยถ 45.)\nKonitzer tried to obtain hormone therapy while incarcerated at WCI, but his request was\ndenied by a nurse. Id.  In November 1999, Konitzer wrote defendant Sharon Zunker, then\nDirector  of  the  Bureau  of  Health  Services,  requesting  hormone  therapy  and  an\norchiectomy.  (PFOF  ยถ    46.)    The  request  proved  unsuccessful.  Id.    However,  on\nDecember 8, 1999, Dr. Metodio Reyes requested authorization to continue Konitzer's\nhormone therapy. (DFOF ยถ  214.)  The next day, DOC Medical Director George Daley\napproved the request. (DFOF ยถ 215).\nWhile at GBCI, Konitzer also requested the opportunity to live as female, and\nsought the help of Dr. Gerald Wellens in obtaining makeup and female undergarments.\n(PFOF ยถ 60.)  Dr. Wellens was unable to assist Konitzer in obtaining makeup or female\nundergarments and was told by GBCI Warden Daniel Bertrand, \"if you let one inmate wear\n11\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 11 of 68   Document 238 \n\na bra and panties, then they'll all want to wear a bra and panties.\" (PFOF ยถ 62.) \nAfterward, Konitzer would make cosmetics and find ways to obtain female undergarments.\n(PFOF ยถ 63.)\nOn April 27, 2000, Konitzer received an adult conduct report at GBCI for\nwearing a bra. (PFOF ยถ 66.)  While at GBCI, Dr. Wellens observed that Konitzer wore\nmakeup regularly. (PFOF ยถ 64.)  On October 4, 2000, GBCI Deputy Warden Michael\nBaenen wrote Konitzer that \"[a] prohibition against make up at work is not a prohibition\nagainst make up in your cell or other areas.\" (PFOF ยถ  65.)   According to Dr. Randi Ettner,\nliving as a female consolidates the female identity for the male-to-female transsexual and\ncreates harmony between outward appearance and inner self.4 (PFOF ยถ  61.)\nOn June 15, 2000, Dr. Laurens D. Young, Chief Psychiatric Consultant to the\nDOC, wrote Sharon Zunker informing her that in addition to Konitzer, two other inmates in\nthe DOC system on hormone therapy had mutilated their genitals and that such behavior\nwas typical for patients with GID. (PFOF ยถ 69.)\nIn early January 2001, Konitzer attempted suicide at GBCI by trying to hang\nhimself.  (PFOF ยถ 70.)  Konitzer felt depressed over incidents of sexual assault involving\na GBCI prison guard, and because he felt that he was not receiving the proper treatment\nfor his GID.  Id.  In late January 2001, Konitzer cut skin away from his scrotum and tied a\n4Dr. Randi Ettner is a practicing clinical psychologist and a practicing forensic psychologist, who\nprovides diagnoses, psycho assessments, and treatments for persons with mental illnesses. (PFOF ยถ 50.)\nForensic psychologists are trained to understand the interface between psychology and the law. (PFOF ยถ\n51.) She has published numerous papers and books on the subject of GID, including research every two\nyears at the meeting of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association. (PFOF ยถ 53.) Dr.\nEttner sees patients approximately 60% of the time and has acted in an expert capacity in legal matters\nincluding four or five cases involving gender identity issues. (PFOF ยถยถ  54-55.) Dr. Ettner has authored\nConfessions of a Gender Defendant: Psychologist's Reflection on Life Amongst the Transgendered, and\nGender Loving Care: A Guide to Counseling Gender Variant Clients.

Konitzer was transported to a hospital in Green Bay for treatment of the genital\nwound. (PFOF ยถ 72.)  Prior to transferring Konitzer to the hospital, female guards at GBCI\nconducted a strip search. Id.  Konitzer's self-mutilation required transfer to the University\nof Wisconsin Hospital where surgeons removed Konitzer's left testicle and portions of the\nright testicle after obtaining court authorization. The hospital went to court after Konitzer\ninsisted on removal of both testicles. (PFOF ยถยถ 83-84.)  Konitzer was taken to the WRC\nfollowing release from the hospital. Id.\nWhen Konitzer was transferred to the WRC, he had three sets of women's\nunderwear, three bras, one nightgown, and six sets of men's bikini style underwear. (PFOF\nยถ 73.)  The WRC confiscated these items as unallowable property.  Id.  On February 19,\n2001, Konitzer filed an offender complaint stating that Steve Hamilton of the WRC had\nconfiscated the six sets of men's bikini underwear as female clothing and that they should\nbe returned. (PFOF ยถ 74.)  The complaint was affirmed and staff returned the underwear\nto Konitzer. Id.\nAn Inmate Classification Summary for the WRC states that during staffing for\nKonitzer's case on March 8, 2001, Dr. Arong stated she believes Konitzer is stable for\ntransfer.  (PFOF ยถ 75.)  She added that it is possible he will attempt to hurt himself again\ndue to his gender identity disorder.  Id.  On May 1, 2001, Deputy Warden Baenen wrote\nKonitzer stating:  \"You further raise the issue of wearing make up and being searched by\nfemale officers. Clearly you did do both of these at GBCI. The issue, however, is not\nwhether this ever happened, but whether it was sanctioned as part of institutional policy\n13\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 13 of 68   Document 238 \n\nwhile you were here. The answer to that question is no, neither was sanctioned.\"   (PFOF\nยถ 76.)  \nOn March 25, 2003, Dr. Kevin Kallas wrote to Konitzer, noting his six\nattempted self-castrations and self-penectomy. (Cothroll Decl. ยถ 4, Ex. 203, Bates No.\n5402-03.)  Dr. Kallas stated that \"[t]his letter is in response to your correspondence with\nGovernor Jim Doyle,\" and that \"[y]ou state that treating you as a male has caused you six\nattempted self-castrations and one instance of attempting to cut your penis off.\"  Id.\nIn July 2003, Konitzer attempted suicide at the WRC by standing in a bucket\nof water and dropping a plugged-in alarm clock. (PFOF ยถ 88.)  Staff at the WRC turned off\nthe power, however, before the alarm clock reached the water. Id. Shortly thereafter,\nKonitzer again attempted suicide by crushing his hyoid bone in his neck with a nylon cord.\n(PFOF ยถ 90.)  Konitzer attempted suicide because he did not want to live life as a male.\n(PFOF ยถยถ 89,91.)\nKonitzer's March 28, 2005, Revised Release Transfer Summary states that\nhis self-abusive behavior does not result from any form of manipulation, but appears to\nresult from a sense of hopelessness that causes self-destructive feelings. (PFOF ยถ 92.)\nWRC Security Director Canziani is aware of one of Konitzer's self-castration attempts and\none of his suicide attempts (PFOF ยถ 93), and Director Bartow recalls Konitzer's suicide and\ncastration attempts (PFOF ยถ 94).  According to Dr. Tom Speech, Konitzer had a long\nhistory of attempted self-castration, which as a form of self-injury was a concern to the\nWRC staff. (PFOF ยถ 95.)  Dr. Thomas Michlowski, a psychiatrist and Medical Director of\nthe WRC, knows that attempted castration has been an issue for Konitzer from time to\ntime, and is aware that Konitzer attempted suicide at the WRC. (PFOF ยถ 97.)\n14\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 14 of 68   Document 238 \n\nOn May 15, 2006, in an effort to further alleviate his gender dysphoria,\nKonitzer attempted to castrate his remaining teste. (PFOF ยถ 209.)  Konitzer's attempt\nresulted in his transfer to Theda Clark Medical Center in Neenah, Wisconsin.  Id.  There,\non May 16, 2006, doctors surgically removed Konitzer's remaining testicle. Id.\nSince May 17, 2006, shortly after his castration attempt, Konitzer has lived in\na WRC cell containing a private toilet. (PFOF ยถ 210.)  A window shutter over the door\nprevents other inmates from viewing Konitzer in compromising situations, such as when he\nuses the toilet, but staff are still able to see him during rounds. Id.  Although some inmates\nhave made comments to Konitzer about his living situation, none have been negative, nor\nhas Konitzer been assaulted since May 17, 2006.  Id.\nAround the same time, on or about March 17, 2006, the WRC medical staff\nrequested that Konitzer be referred to the University of Wisconsin endocrinology clinic\n(\"UW\") for \"recommendations on dosages of medication, estrogen, etc.\" (Id.; Konitzer\nSuppl. Decl., Ex. 217.)  The request further stated that the WRC \"will be required to\nwithdraw Estrogen.  Please recommend method and associate [sic] medical problems.\"  Id.\nIn September 2006, Dr. Roger Kulstad of the UW Hospital recommended that\nKonitzer receive Vaniqa cream, a hair growth retardant, for folliculitis (hair follicle infection)\non his face.  (PFOF ยถ 214.)  In addition, Dr. Kulstad recommended Rogaine and a bra,\nnoting with respect to the latter that Konitzer receive \"a bra for adequate breast support.\nBreasts are Tanner IV consistent with adult female.  This is medically necessary.\"  Id.  On\nSeptember 28, 2006, UW Hospital issued an Endocrine-Diabetes Consult Note signed by\nthe attending endocrinologist, Dr. Elaine M. Pelley.  Id.  The Note reiterates Dr. Kulstad's\n15\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 15 of 68   Document 238 \n\nprevious recommendations regarding Vaniqa and a bra. Id.

DOC Policy\nThe DOC has in place Executive Directive #68. (DFOF ยถ  72.) This directive\nis entitled \"Scope of Services for Treatment of Gender Identity Disorder.\"5 (Bartow Dep.,\n5Executive Directive #68 provides: \nSUBJECT: Scope of Services for the Treatment of Gender Identity Disorder \nI. Background \nIt is the policy of the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) to provide appropriate treatment\nservices to offenders meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (DSM-IV 302.85).\nPractitioners shall take correctional and community standards of care into consideration when providing\ntreatment services.\nII.  Definitions\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th Edition, Revised (DSM-IV): The standard manual of psychiatric\ndiagnoses and classification codes.\n \nGender Identity Disorder: A psychiatric disorder in which a person is not satisfied and is seriously dysphoric\nwith regard to their anatomical gender. In general, this condition is a stable, nonviolent condition and not due\nto psychosis, but it may accompany other mental disorders.\nHormonal Therapy: The use of hormones to stimulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics\nsuch as enlargement of breasts and which may exert systemic effects such as body hair loss. \nSexual Reassignment Therapy: Treatment for gender identity disorder in which one or more of the following\nare used: hormonal medications, surgical procedures to alter a person's physical appearance so that he/she\nappears more like the opposite gender and psychological counseling.\n \nII. [sic] Guidelines \nA.  No surgical procedures for the purpose of sexual reassignment shall be provided to any offenders\nincarcerated in the WDOC. \nB.  After consultation with the Gender Identity Disorder Committee, hormonal therapy for severe gender\ndysphoria may be initiated by the WDOC physicians. The Gender Identity Disorder Committee will consult with\na non-WDOC consultant before approving or denying a request from a WDOC physician for initiating\nhormonal therapy. If the Committee and the non-WDOC consultant do not agree regarding initiating hormonal\ntherapy for severe gender dysphoria, the DOC Medical Director and non-WDOC Consultant will meet with the\nSecretary's Office to reach a decision. \n16\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 16 of 68   Document 238 \n\nC.  An offender who is receiving hormonal medications as a part of an established sexual reassignment\ntherapy regimen under the supervision of a medical doctor at the time of incarceration may be continued on\nhormonal medications provided that the offender cooperates with the DOC in obtaining confirmation of his/her\nprevious treatment. If an offender chooses to discontinue hormonal medications and then wishes to restart\nhormonal medications, the committee referenced below will evaluate the request and make a determination.\nD.  The offender must agree to sign DOC-1163, Confidential Information Release Authorization, allowing DOC\nmedical and mental health staff access to medical and mental health records regarding all prior treatment\nrelated to gender identity disorder. \nE.  Offenders identified or claiming to suffer from gender identity disorder shall have access to the full range\nof mental health therapies available through the Wisconsin DOC. They shall have access to therapies in which\nthey may explore their ambivalence, confusion and conflict around sexual identity as well as those services\nfocusing on enabling those with identifiable mental health problems to better adjust to institutional living. \nF.  Self-inflicted genital mutilation or other forms of self-mutilation are not consistent with successful sexual\nreassignment therapy. \nFacility Placement \nA.  In the event that an offender who has completed a surgical sexual reassignment treatment program is\ncommitted to the DOC, that offender shall be placed in a correctional facility appropriate for his/her reassigned\ngender.\nB.  In general, offenders shall be placed in facilities in accordance with their gender as determined by their\nexternal genitalia.\nName and Apparel for Inmates with Gender Identity Disorder\nA. The DOC shall use the name of the offender as it appears on the Judgement [sic] of Conviction. The only\nexception to a name change will be through an order of a judge to have the name of the offender legally\nchanged after the Judgement [sic] of Conviction.  A new Judgement [sic] of Conviction must be issued or the\ncourt order must specifically state \"change all records\". \nB. Property and apparel shall be consistent with the offender's determined gender. \nGender Identity Disorder Management and Treatment Committee\nA. Composition: The Committee shall be composed of the DOC Medical Director, the DOC Mental Health\nDirector, the Bureau of Health Services Director or designee, an assigned doctoral prepared psychologist, and\na Warden or designee. In addition, a medical specialist in the treatment of gender identity disorder from the\ncommunity may be retained as a consultant on specific cases. If the offender is identified as a sex offender,\nthe Chief Psychologist, Sex Offender Specialist shall participate as a member. \nB. Function: The committee shall be convened to address issues in the management of individuals with\ngender identity disorder after review and referral by the medical director, mental health director or Bureau\ndirector. Inmates may be referred to the medical director, mental health director or bureau director to address\nissues of concern through the committee by institution Wardens or their designees. \nThe committee shall advise the medical director or treating physician on issues such as appropriate\ndiagnoses, complications of treatment, management issues, and/or the design and implementation of a plan\nof care. \n17\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 17 of 68   Document 238 \n\nSept. 9, 2004, Ex. 6.)  Executive Directive #68 was the result of a collaborative effort by\nDOC  health  services  staff,  DOC's  chief  psychiatrist,  other  DOC  psychiatrists  and\npsychologists, and members of the DOC executive staff. (DFOF ยถ 73.)  According to\ndefendant Sharon Zunker, DOC Health Services Coordinator, the policy was based upon\nthe input of the \"executive staff who reviewed this policy and procedure, including wardens\nand other members of the executive staff at the time.\" (Zunker Dep. at 76.)  Executive\nDirective #68 was signed by then DOC Secretary Jon E. Litscher on December 17, 2002.\n(DFOF ยถ 74.)  Prior to January 24, 2006, the effective date of Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m),\nExecutive Directive #68 allowed for hormonal therapy to be initiated by a DOC physician for\ninmates with severe gender dysphoria. (DFOF ยถ 75.)\nGender dysphoria is a broader term that includes GID. (DFOF ยถ 77.)  Under\nExecutive Directive #68, offenders are placed in facilities in accordance with their gender\nas determined by their external genitalia. (DFOF ยถ 78.)  The WRC has directed its staff to\ntreat Konitzer as a male in all respects. (DFOF ยถ 80.)\nThe WRC will not deviate from general corrections practice regarding the\nmanagement of an inmate's mental illness unless it considers the departure to be central\nto the mental illness at issue. (PFOF ยถ 100.)  Bartow, as the leader of the WRC, has\ndecided that the WRC will not treat any male inmate as a female and will not do so in\nKonitzer's case because of DOC policy. (PFOF ยถ 101.)  Regarding the prospect of treating\nKonitzer as a female, Bartow maintains that \"if our team was convinced and had a\nconvincing argument that is what really needed to be done for his case, I would arrange to\n(Bartow Dep., September 9, 2004, Ex. 6.) \n18\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 18 of 68   Document 238 \n\nhave him go somewhere else, by whatever means it took, because we don't do that here.\"\n(Bartow Dep. at 136; PFOF ยถ 102.)\nIn discussing Konitzer's therapy sessions to address his disorders, Dr. Speech\ntestified:  \"From our point of view, you're in a male correctional facility, and it looks like\nyou're going to be there a very long time.  And what we can do is help you adjust to that.\nWe can help you cope with having a gender identity disorder under those circumstances.\"\n(Speech Dep. at 49-50; PFOF ยถ 109.)  When asked whether he had explored the options\nof allowing Konitzer to wear makeup, to wear female attire or to be referred to as a female,\ndefendant Dr. Speech testified:  \"We determined that since the Department of Corrections\ndid not allow any of those things, that it would be inappropriate to allow Konitzer to do any\nof that here, because he's going to go back to an environment where he only stands to lose\nall of those things, which would be a significant setback to him, particularly given his\nemotional makeup and his diagnoses. That would be setting him up for failure when he\nreturns.  He would become extremely angry is our belief and we would be right back where\nwe started, just setting him up for frustration.\" (Speech Dep. at 57-58; PFOF ยถ 110.)\nIn 2002, the WRC clinical staff suggested to DOC staff treatment strategies\nsuch as \"allowing Mr. Konitzer to wear female clothing or undergarments as a reward for\nlack of self-mutilation, or having us pursue sex reassignment surgery.\" (Kallas Dep. at 62;\nPFOF ยถ 111.)  On October 8, 2002, Dr. Speech wrote Dr. Kallas stating that he had\n\"reservations about not having female staff present at searches. This provision was set up\nfor our protection as much as for the protection of the inmates.\" (Speech Dep. Ex. 41, Bates\nNo. 5444; PFOF ยถ 112.)  Dr. Kallas testified that Dr. Speech made the recommendations\nfor female clothing and sex reassignment surgery, but that the DOC would not implement\n19\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 19 of 68   Document 238 \n\nany of them because of the DOC policy and that the correctional environment would not\nallow the WRC's suggestions. (PFOF ยถ 113.)  Konitzer continues to wear makeup and\nfeminize his appearance at the WRC, despite the policy against him possessing and\nwearing feminine items. (PFOF ยถ 121.)\nD.  Expert Opinions\nThe WRC staff diagnosed Konitzer with the following DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses\nin addition to GID:  cocaine dependence in remission in a controlled environment, post\ntraumatic stress disorder, and major depression, as well as the DSM-IV Axis II diagnosis\nof  personality  disorder  with  cluster  B  traits.  (DFOF  ยถ  43.)    Cynthia  Osborne,  a\npsychotherapist and assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral\nSciences at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, has a similar opinion and\nbelieves  that  Konitzer  meets  the  criteria  for  DSM-IV  Axis  II  diagnoses  of  antisocial\npersonality and borderline personality disorder. (DFOF ยถยถ  44, 45.)  Because of the\npresence of Axis II symptomatology, Osborne is uncertain whether Konitzer's GID is the\n\"cause\" of his disruptive, suicidal, or self-harming behaviors. (DFOF ยถ 54.)\nIn the view of Dr. Daniel Claiborn, who has a Ph.D. in counseling psychology\nand is a licensed psychologist in Kansas and Missouri, Konitzer manifests severe, chronic\n\"Cluster B\" personality disorders, characterized by self-centeredness, drama, volatile\nemotions, and erratic behaviors.6  (DFOF ยถยถ 46,48.)  Morever, Dr. Claiborn opines that\nthese combined personality disorders (antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic)\n6 It is undisputed that Dr. Claiborn did not interview Konitzer, despite stating that it was his practice\nto do so in almost every case in which he was retained as an expert, and that he only had not interviewed\na subject when he was asked to review another expert's report or determine whether another evaluation of\nthe subject was warranted. (Claiborn Dep. at 25-26, 51-52, 54.)\n20\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 20 of 68   Document 238 \n\nmilitate against honest self-exploration, trust, commitment, and taking responsibility for\nchange. Id.  Further, Dr. Claiborn believes antisocial personality disorder is Konitzer's most\nsevere disorder. (DFOF ยถ 47.)  It is Dr. Claiborn's opinion that Konitzer's treatment must be\ndesigned carefully to address GID in the context of severe and overlaying personality\npathologies and that failure to do so will likely result in disappointing outcomes for Konitzer\nand the State of Wisconsin. (DFOF ยถ 49.)\nRandi Ettner, Ph.D., who was retained by Konitzer, recommends that Konitzer\nreceive the following treatment for GID:  (1) evaluation by a physician who specializes in the\ncare of GID patients so that Konitzer's hormonal protocol can be accurately reconfigured;\n(2) follow-up with the same medical specialist every six months, or as necessary; (3)\nnonโmedical security examinations should be executed by female correctional personnel;\n(4) periodic access to a mental health care giver with expertise in treatment of this class of\ndisorder, i.e. a member of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association;\n(5) access to a modest amount of make-up; (6) use of female undergarments; (7) privacy\ntoilet and showering; (8) the ability to use a female name in addressing oneself, and to be\nso addressed by others; (9) the ability to use products such as depilatories and/or hair\ngrowth stimulators that are harmless and enhance one's ability to live in the preferred\ngender role.  (DFOF ยถ 50.)  However, she does not know the exact status of Konitzer's\nmedical treatment and it is beyond her experience to comment on Konitzer's particular\nhormone treatment.  (DFOF ยถ 52.)  Nonetheless, Dr. R. Ettner believes it is not malpractice\nfor an endocrinologist to treat a patient who has GID even though they have not done that\nbefore.  (DFOF ยถ 56.)  Dr. R. Ettner does not have experience treating individuals while they\n21\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 21 of 68   Document 238 \n\nare incarcerated or in prison security issues or prison administration, and only interviewed\nKonitzer once at the WRC.  (DFOF ยถ 55.)  \nIn the opinion of Dr. Claiborn, physicians who are generally informed about\ntranssexualism and consult with an endocrinologist are competent to help Konitzer make\ninformed decisions about his treatment options. (DFOF ยถ 57.)   Psychologists are not\nallowed to practice outside their areas of expertise, but, in Dr. Claiborn's opinion, education\nand familiarity are sufficient qualifications for a mental health provider to help Konitzer\nconsider his options within the prison system. (DFOF ยถ 60.)  Dr. Claiborn opines that mental\nhealth personnel should have an understanding of the prison resources and of techniques\nfor helping individuals adjust to circumstances beyond their control, whatever those might\nbe. Id. Mental health personnel in prisons and working with Konitzer should also have\nfamiliarity with personality disorders. Id. \nIn the opinion of Osborne, focusing Konitzer's treatment on adjustment rather\nthan cross gender transition is a clinically sound and ethically wise stance. (DFOF ยถ 61.)\nFrederic Ettner, M.D. was also retained by Konitzer and recommends that\nKonitzer receive the following protocol:  (1) complete physical examination and laboratory\ntesting  including  hormonal  assessment;  (2)  HRT  (hormone  replacement  therapy),\nspecifically non-conjugated estrogens, i.e. estradiol valerate (bio-identical) in the form of\npatch, gel, or cream; (3) anti-androgen finasteride to block exogenous androgens and\nstimulate scalp hair and decrease body hair; (4) consistent follow-up every three months;\nand (5) coordination with psychiatrists and psychological recommendations.  (DFOF ยถ 62.)\nIt is the view of Dr. F. Ettner that a medical doctor may give Konitzer a complete physical\nexamination and laboratory testing including hormonal assessment, and that it is not\n22\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 22 of 68   Document 238 \n\nnecessary that the doctor have expertise in GID to perform this. (DFOF ยถ 65.)  Dr. F. Ettner\nconcedes that Konitzer probably could have conjugated estrogens for a period of time until\nstabilized, and then after a period of perhaps a year or two, could easily be transferred to\na non-conjugated estrogen. (DFOF ยถ 66.)\nAccording to defendants' expert Dr. Samuel Westrick, there are no \"official\"\nguidelines for the best medical treatment of male-to-female transsexuals but a few authors\nhave published recommendations based on their considerable experience with these\npatients. (DFOF ยถ 63; Westrick Dep., May 16, 2005, Ex. 88 at 2.)  Consensus exists among\nexperts that estrogen therapy is a cornerstone of treatment for a male-to-female individual\nwith GID, while nuances of type and dose remain controversial, or at least subject to much\ndiversity of opinion. (DFOF ยถ 64.)\nFrom  a  psychiatric  perspective,  hormones  are  not  prescribed  to  a\nmale-to-female GID patient for feminization per se. (DFOF ยถ 67.)  Rather, hormones are\nprescribed to reduce symptoms of dysphoria and to improve function. Id.  Osborne also\nopines that while feminization may be the male-to-female GID patient's desire, the clinically\nneutral clinician is invested only in assisting the patient to function better, to adjust to his\nenvironment, and to ameliorate to the greatest extent possible dysphoria and any co-morbid\nsymptoms. (DFOF ยถ 68.)\nWith  regard  to  the  administration  of  anti-androgen  finasteride  to  block\nexogenous androgens, stimulate scalp hair and decrease body hair, Dr. F. Ettner believes\nthat finasteride is not absolutely necessary for the treatment of transgendered males to\nfemales. (DFOF ยถ 69.)  Dr. F. Ettner testified:\n23\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 23 of 68   Document 238 \n\nIn the standards of care, it is recommended that it [finasteride]\nbe utilized. Is it absolutely necessary?  If it wasn't available in\nher  part  of  the  universe,  no,  it  would  not  be  absolutely\nnecessary.  One could utilize other hormones to help treat the\ngender dysphoria, but certainly if it is available, it should be\nlooked into and utilized.\n(F. Ettner Dep., May 6, 2005, at 37.)  Similarly, in the opinion of Dr. Westrick, it does not\nappear there is any rationale to prescribe an anti-androgen agent to Konitzer because there\nare no androgens in Konitzer's system causing masculinization. (DFOF ยถ 70.)\nAs  for  coordination  of  Konitzer's  psychiatrists  and  his  psychological\nrecommendations, Dr. F. Ettner acknowledges that phone calls, e-mails or any type of\ncoordination with someone such as an endocrinologist and a treating psychiatrist would\nsatisfy Konitzer's treatment needs.  (DFOF ยถ 71.)  Further, Dr. F. Ettner opines that refusing\nto provide Konitzer with the real-life experience puts him at risk for castration and self harm,\nand that the frustration of living with an untreated gender condition always has disastrous\nconsequences. (PFOF ยถ 118.)  Dr. F. Ettner testified:\nStandard of care does not specify a list of particular ingredients\nthat will create the image that Donna Down Konitzer needs to\nestablish a level of well-being. It does, however, provide a\nguideline, and in that guideline, the thrust of it is to help these\npeople consolidate an identity that is ego-syntonic and causes\nthem to feel comfortable and safe in this world, therefore, the\nreal-life experience, so they get practice in living 24 hours a\nday, seven days a week in their preferred gender.\n(F. Ettner Dep. at 101; PFOF ยถ 122.)\nDr. Randi Ettner's opinion is that certain things, such as depilatories and hair\ngrowth stimulators, which may appear superficial or not medical, play a very prominent role\nin the treatment of GID and allow the patient to move from a discordant and uncomfortable\nlife that interferes with their functioning into a safer and more comfortable gendered\n24\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 24 of 68   Document 238 \n\necology. (PFOF ยถ 123.)  Moreover, Dr. R. Ettner opines that Konitzer has not received the\nminimum standard of care for the treatment of GID. (PFOF ยถ 124.)  Indeed, she maintains\nthat many of Konitzer's interventions have been counter-therapeutic. Id.  It is the view of Dr.\nR. Ettner that the overarching goal of Konitzer's treatment is to assist him to adapting to life\nas a male.\nCynthia Osborne advised the DOC to consider:  (1) use of the inmate's chosen\nname and feminine pronouns by all treatment, security and administrative personnel, which\ncan be done without pursuit of a legal name change; (2) the wearing of feminine apparel,\nsuch as undergarments, in ways that minimize security risks, for example, Konitzer could\nbe allowed cross dressing opportunities in the privacy of his own room; (3) the use of some\nitems of light makeup in the privacy of his room; (4) the use of Rogaine, hair removal wax,\nand other products that may assist Konitzer in quieting the dysphoria; (5) the opportunity\nto shower privately; (6) the assignment of female guards whenever possible to conduct strip\nsearches; and (7) the thorough training of institutional staff to understand GID. (PFOF ยถ\n126.)  Additionally,  Osborne  recommends  that  the DOC consider allowing  feminizing\nstrategies that do not constitute a threat to security, interfere with daily operations of prison\nprograms, or undermine the safety, functioning, and options of inmates. (PFOF ยถ 127.)\nAccording to Osborne, \"I have no clinical opposition to this inmate or some other inmates\nbeing accommodated in their gender preferences to a reasonable extent.  If it does not put\nthem at risk, or other people at risk, I have no objection.\" (PFOF ยถ 128.)  She added that\nher opinion was based on the consensus of the collegial community with which she is\naffiliated. (PFOF ยถ 130.)  This collegial community consists of Osborne's colleagues at\nJohns Hopkins and other colleagues around the nation with whom she consults and shares\n25\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 25 of 68   Document 238 \n\ntreatment opinions.  Id.  Every group that operates in this country and abroad in the area\nof GID is familiar with the Standards of Care and recognizes them as guidelines. (PFOF ยถ\n131.)\n Osborne admits that the literature says it is appropriate to address a GID\npatient by their preferred gender name, but she believes it is bad clinical advice. (PFOF\nยถ 132.)  The only literature that supports her opinion is her article on split gender identity,\nwhich was the first to advocate that viewpoint. Id. The article on split gender identity was\nbased upon Osborne and her co-author's observational research and no empirical data.\n(PFOF ยถ 133.)  In defendant Dr. David Burnett's understanding of the Standards of Care,\nthe real-life experience is a legitimate form of treatment for a GID patient, depending upon\nthat person's individual situation. (PFOF ยถ 134.)\nDr. Claiborn testified that, more often than not, he interviews individuals when\nhe prepares an expert report. (PFOF ยถ 135.)  However, Dr. Claiborn did not interview\nKonitzer prior to preparing his report. (PFOF ยถ 136.)  Dr. Claiborn has never published or\nwritten books on GID, and has seen only about thirty patients with GID over the past twenty\nyears, does not subscribe to any journals specific to GID or belong to any associations\nspecific to GID. (PFOF ยถ 137.) Dr. Claiborn testified that the DSM is an economic and\npolitical process, and that many so-called disorders are included in the DSM that are not\nreally disorders or diseases at all and he would include GID as one of those. (PFOF ยถ 138.)\nCiting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), but admitting that he did not\nread the case, Dr. Claiborn understands the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution to prohibit deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. (PFOF ยถ 140, 142.)\nDr. Claiborn explained that \"serious medical needs\" as outlined in his report focuses on the\n26\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 26 of 68   Document 238 \n\nword  medical  and  that  a  medical  need  would  be  one  that  was  resolved  through\npharmacological or surgical treatment. (PFOF ยถ 141.)  In his experience, Dr. Claiborn\ntestified that patients with borderline personality disorder that practice self-mutilation usually\ndo so in the form of wrist slitting.  (PFOF ยถ 143.)  Dr. Claiborn has never in his experience\nseen, or heard, of a patient with borderline personality disorder who has attempted genital\nmutilation, and believes it unusual to see any kind of self-mutilation with a person with\nantisocial personality disorder. (PFOF ยถ 144.)  He does not think that female security\nexaminations, makeup, female clothing, toilet and shower privacy, and referring to Konitzer\nby a female name is necessary because GID is not a disorder or disease that requires\ntreatment. (PFOF ยถ 145.)  Dr. Claiborn does not consider himself to be an expert in prison\nsecurity, and cannot comment on the issue of what prisons can and cannot do since that\nis not his area of expertise. (PFOF ยถ 146.)\n Osborne, who also stated that she is not an expert in prison security,\ntestified:\nA.  The presence of sociopathy tendencies does not mean someone\nhas necessarily acted on those behaviorally. This is all a matter of\nclinical  judgment.  And  I  would  not,  I  don't  think  I  have  ever\nrecommended  full  cross  gender  transition  for  someone  who  has\nsevere personality disorder traits.\nQ.  So when you state the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care include\na criterion of being crime free, are you referring to, is it your impression\nthat the Harry Benjamin standards require crime free criterion for sex\nreassignment surgery? \nA.  Yes. I think it is implicit. \nQ.  Would you say that the Harry Benjamin Standards of Care require\nthat a person be crime free for treatments of gender identity disorder\nother than sex reassignment surgery? \n27\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 27 of 68   Document 238 \n\nA.  This criteria right here is for hormones. That is a requirement for\nhormone therapy. So that precedes surgery.\n \nQ.   So you are saying then in general the Harry Benjamin Standards\nof Care require criteria of being crime free? \nA.   Require is a strong word for something that is a non-regulatory\nguideline. But this is a recommended way by this foundation of treating\nGID. And it includes this criterion, suggested criterion that sociopathy\nbe under control. A person who is actively acting out or in prison\nbecause they have acted out I would say that is just a major logical\ncontraindication.\n(PFOF ยถ 141; Osborne Dep., May 17, 2005, at 134-36.)  Osborne opines:\nI recommend that the DOC consider allowing feminizing strategies that\ndon't constitute a threat to security, or interfere with daily operations of\nprison programs, the safety or functioning of inmates, and that don't\njeopardize the future options of the inmate. Some accommodation will\nreduce  power  struggles,  invite  better  cooperation,  and  raise  the\npotential for smoother sailing for both the inmate and the DOC. But\naccommodating strategies should not be confused with medically\nnecessary treatments. Of the hundreds of gender identity disordered\npatients I have treated and the dozens in my current caseload, none\nhas these kinds of products and services funded by third party payers.\n(Osborne Dep., Ex. 95 at 43.)\nDr. R. Ettner testified that simply because a particular treatment is cost\nprohibitive, that does not mean it is not medically necessary. (PFOF ยถ 151.)  There are\nsome people who do not have insurance, which makes any medically necessary procedure\nprohibitive for them.  Id.  Moreover, even if the DOC were to change its policy and permit\nKonitzer to wear makeup, the final authority as to whether Konitzer could wear makeup at\nthe WRC rests with Bartow, who is not a clinician. (PFOF ยถ 153.)\n Dr. Santos-Borja testified:\nQ. . . . Konitzer's self-abuse and self-harm appear to result from\na sense of hopelessness that caused self-destructive feelings.\nWhat's your sense of what this hopelessness is?\n28\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 28 of 68   Document 238 \n\nA.  Hopelessness about being confined in a - - his identity as a\nmale, her identity, hopelessness in terms of being confined in\nprison for a long, long time and not being able to do anything to\nbe able to live as a female. Also some relationships. I don't\nknow, problems, those kinds of things. \nQ. So hopelessness in the sense that Inmate Konitzer has\ngender identity disorder and can't do anything about it? \nA. It's a general sense of hopelessness. It's cumulative. I\nwouldn't say that it's just because of that particular thing.  I think\na  lot  of  things  makes  [sic]  Konitzer  hopeless.  He  has  a\ntendency to seek out relationships and there's, you know, very\nlittle chance of having a really long-lasting relationship in this\nkind of setting.\n(Santos-Borja Dep., April 27, 2005, at 69-70.) \nCo-morbid disorders mean that an individual has more than one disorder,\nsuch as antisocial personality disorder and depression, at the same time. (PFOF ยถ 155.)\nDr. R. Ettner would not approach a patient who had GID any differently because that patient\nmight also have other co-morbid personality disorders such as borderline personality\ndisorders. (PFOF ยถ 156.)  Just like a medical doctor might see diabetes and GID and\nRaynaud's syndrome in the same patient, he would not refuse treatment for anyone of\nthose conditions just because they exist in a person simultaneously. (PFOF ยถ 157.)\nOsborne testified that she is not aware of any antisocial or borderline patient who has\nauto-castrated, but that she has had GID patients who have done so.  Id.\nDr. R. Ettner interviewed Konitzer at the WRC and administered the MMPI.\n(PFOF ยถ 159.)  The MMPI confirms that Konitzer is at risk for suicide or castration attempt\nbecause it indicates a lot of suicidal ideation and depression.  Id.  The value of the MMPI\nis that it is normed (compares results against the same group) for correctional settings.\n29\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 29 of 68   Document 238 \n\n(PFOF ยถ 160.)  If MMPI test scores are not normed to a matched group that resembles the\nindividual, the scores are meaningless. Id. \nOsborne did not administer the MMPI to Konitzer because she is not qualified\nto administer it. (PFOF ยถ 161.)  However, she agrees that the MMPI is normed for the prison\npopulation. Id.  Instead, Osborne administered the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Derogatis\nAffects Balance Scale, and the NEO-P-I-R to understand Konitzer's psychological distress.\n(PFOF ยถ 162.)  None of these psychological tests are normed for prison populations. Id.\nE.  Security\nThe risk of danger to staff and inmates in a correctional environment is higher\nthan most aspects of normal society. (DFOF ยถ 86.)  The nature of the correctional\nenvironment, particularly in view of recent severe population increases, represents a density\nof human living conditions that is only comparable to the worst of human slums in major\nurban areas around the world. Id.  The human living conditions in correctional facilities are\nfurther aggravated in that this density consists of hundreds of individuals at each institution\nwho have led lives of severe social dysfunction in the form of drug abuse, violence, unstable\nfamily relationships, and mental health disorders. (DFOF ยถ 87.)  In high security prison\npopulations, nearly forty percent of the inmates have committed acts of violence while\nincarcerated. (DFOF ยถ 88.)  The risk that inmates will commit acts of violence while\nincarcerated is dramatically elevated by a number of conditions that may or may not be\npresent in the prison population. (DFOF ยถ 89.)  One is the presence of lethal weapons in\nthe possession of inmates, another is the possession and sale of illegal drugs by inmates,\nand another is the sexual behavior among inmates. Id.  It is not unusual to find that over fifty\npercent of the incidents in prison are related to sexual partnering among inmates where\n30\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 30 of 68   Document 238 \n\nconflict has developed in the form of jealous partners, failed relationships, or competition\nfrom other inmates. (DFOF ยถ 90.)  The level of risk of incidents of violence in prison is\nfurther elevated when any of the participants has a history of violent, assaultive behavior,\nsuch as Konitzer. (DFOF ยถ 91.)\nIt is the mission and obligation of all American correctional systems to protect\ninmates and staff from physical harm. (DFOF ยถ 92.)  Where inmates show an inclination to\nbe sexually active towards one another, it is common practice for staff to investigate, to be\naware, and to take active measures in terms of prevention. (DFOF ยถ 93.)  Inmate sexual\nactivity is commonly the subject of administrative discipline. Id.  Additionally, corrections\nstaff  may  elect  to  separate  inmates  by  a  change  of  cell  assignment  or  cell  house\nassignment. (DFOF ยถ 94.)   Where violence appears imminent, inmates may be segregated\nfrom others.  Id.  These are continual practices in an effort to keep the peace in correctional\ninstitutions. Id. \nThe movement of contraband is a security risk at the DOC and the WRC.\n(DFOF ยถ 110.)  Due to the WRC's open treatment philosophy, inmates are moving from\narea to area in the facility, and some of the inmates are highly dangerous. (DFOF ยถ 111.)\nThe movement of contraband is an even greater concern at the WRC because inmates are\nhoused there to receive programming for mental health and/or behavioral issues, and the\nWRC does not typically hold inmates in long-term segregation. (DFOF ยถ 112.)\nStrip searches are conducted at the WRC when there is reason to believe that\ncontraband could be concealed on the clothing or body of an inmate. (DFOF ยถ 115.)  These\nsearches are required any time an inmate leaves or enters the WRC or any time that an\ninmate is brought to a secure unit. (DFOF ยถ 116.)  Strip searches are necessary under\n31\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 31 of 68   Document 238 \n\nthese circumstances to prevent contraband from being brought into the facility and on\nsecure units. It is particularly important to prevent contraband from being brought on to\nsecure units at the WRC because these are disciplinary units that house highly assaultive\nor abusive inmates, and contraband must be controlled to prevent injury to inmates and\nstaff. (DFOF ยถ 117.)\nPersonal searches or pat searches on inmates are required randomly; and\neach WRC unit has criteria for how many random pat searches staff are expected to\nconduct. (DFOF ยถ 118.)  The WRC staff is expected to stop inmates and to conduct pat\nsearches randomly.  Pat searches are also conducted whenever inmates leave work areas,\nas well as kitchen and maintenance areas to ensure that inmates are not smuggling tools,\nfood, or other things to and from their housing unit. (DFOF ยถ 119.)  Moreover, pat searches\nare done as a general security practice. (DFOF ยถ 120.)\nThe WRC adheres to the DOC administrative rules when conducting strip\nsearches and pat searches. (DFOF ยถ 121.)  These rules require that a person of the same\nsex as the inmate being searched shall conduct the strip search, although any staff member\nmay conduct pat searches.\nDOC Security Chief Daniel A. Westfield testified that contraband can be\nconcealed in body cavities, or taped to the body.  For these reasons, strip searches must\nbe conducted in accordance with DOC rules and cannot be compromised for any inmate,\nincluding Konitzer.  Such searches are unpleasant for both the inmate and the staff. (DFOF\nยถ 135.)  During a strip search, inmates are required to completely expose body orifices for\nvisual inspection. The entire body of the inmate is to be checked, including armpits, hands,\npubic region, between toes, soles of feet, rectum, and inner portion of legs. Consequently,\n32\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 32 of 68   Document 238 \n\nDOC rules require that a person of the same sex as the inmate being searched conduct the\nstrip search.\nExecutive Directive #68 states in part: \nThe DOC shall use the name of the offender as it appears on\nthe Judgement [sic] of Conviction. The only exception to a\nname change will be through an order of a judge to have the\nname of the offender legally changed after the Judgement [sic]\nof Conviction. A new Judgement [sic] of Conviction must be\nissued or the court order must specifically state \"change all\nrecords\".\n(Bartow Dep., Sept. 9, 2004, Ex. 6.) \nKonitzer's  name  appears  as  \"Scott  A.  Konitzer\"  on  his  Judgments  of\nConviction dated June 11, 1997, and December 16, 1994. (DFOF ยถ 140.)  Konitzer is in a\nmale institution; was incarcerated under the name of Scott Konitzer and the WRC staff is\ndirected not to address Konitzer by any female name or pronoun.  Id.  However, the WRC\npartially accommodates Konitzer's request to be referred to as a female is by referring to\nhim as \"Konitzer,\" avoiding the use of Scott. (DFOF ยถ 149.)\nPursuant to Executive Directive #68, property and apparel allowed to an\ninmate shall be consistent with the offender's determined gender. (DFOF ยถ 158.)  Gender,\nunder Executive Directive #68, is determined by the inmate's external genitalia.  Konitzer\nis not authorized by the DOC to obtain and wear female clothing while housed at the WRC.\n(DFOF ยถ 159.)\nWhile housed at the WRC, Konitzer is allowed items of clothing and property\nthat males in the DOC prison system are typically allowed. (DFOF ยถ 162.)  The WRC\nconforms its policies related to inmates housed at this facility and allowable clothing and\nproperty to the DOC policies and procedures, because eventually most DOC inmates\n33\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 33 of 68   Document 238 \n\nhoused at the WRC are returned to a DOC correctional institution.  The WRC also conforms\nits policies and procedures related to an inmate's allowed clothing and property to DOC's\npolicies because it is managed as a prison and seeks to avoid wasting resources such as\nclothing and personal items that an inmate may not retain following transfer to a DOC\ncorrectional institution. (DFOF ยถยถ 163-164.)\nDOC 309 IMP #2, \"Subject: Inmate Personal Clothing,\" provides a listing of\nfemale and male clothing items that DOC inmates are allowed to obtain and possess.\n(DFOF ยถ 172.)  The IMP #2 includes a specific listing of allowed personal clothing items to\nbe obtained and possessed by male and female inmates. (DFOF ยถ 173.)  The IMP #2\nindicates that only traditional style briefs and boxers are permitted for male inmates, and\nonly traditional style briefs are permitted for female inmates. The IMP #2 does not allow for\nmale inmates to have bras. (DFOF ยถ 174.)\nEach WRC housing unit has a separate shower area. (DFOF ยถ 189.)  The\nshower area on Konitzer's housing unit consists of two individual shower stalls with curtains\nfor privacy. These shower stalls are in an area that is \"L\" shaped, and are located on the\nright-hand side of the entrance and walkway leading to the stalls. The shower stalls are\nopen daily from 6:00 a.m. until approximately 9:00 a.m. (DFOF ยถ 190.)  Only two inmates\nmay shower at a time in the separate shower stalls.  WRC unit staff have accommodated\nKonitzer's request for separate showering hours on his unit, although this has not been\nprovided uniformly. (DFOF ยถ191.)  Currently Konitzer is allowed to take a daily shower and\nis able to use the shower area alone with the exterior door leading to the shower stalls\nsecured. (DFOF ยถ 192.)  This accommodation for private showering is included in Konitzer's\nRelease/Transfer Summary Inmate form dated March 28, 2005. (DFOF ยถ 193.)  The DOC\n34\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 34 of 68   Document 238 \n\nrepresents that it intends to allow Konitzer to shower separately from other inmates when\nor if he is transferred back to a DOC institution. (DFOF ยถ 194.)\nThe restroom (toilet area) floor plan on Konitzer's housing unit includes urinals\nand three individual stalls with doors that secure similar to a public restroom; however, the\ndoor to the restroom area is opened to the hallway.7 (DFOF ยถ 195.)  Konitzer may use the\nindividual stall and secure the door when using this facility.\nIn January 2004, Dr. Don S. Schalch, an endocrinologist from the University\nof Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics recommended that Konitzer be prescribed Rogaine for\nhair loss.  (DFOF ยถ 200.)  Dr.  Schalch did not believe that Rogaine was necessary to treat\nfunctional impairment Konitzer may have. (DFOF ยถ 201.) Rather, it was Dr. Schalch's\nclinical judgment that it was reasonable for Konitzer to use Rogaine to enhance the amount\nof his scalp hair. \nThe DOC considered Dr. Schalch's recommendation to provide Konitzer with\nthe non-formulary medication, Rogaine, but refused to provide it because it was considered\na cosmetic for hair loss, and thus would not be a covered benefit provided by the DOC.\n(DFOF ยถ 203.)  Further, the WRC determined that it was not in Konitzer's best interest for\nit to provide Rogaine, if the treatment would not be allowed to continue following any\ntransfer back to a DOC institution. (DFOF ยถ 204.)  Furthermore, female inmates housed at\nTaycheedah Correctional Institution are not permitted Rogaine or any other type of hair\ngrowth stimulators except for medical purposes, and not allowed to purchase and/or use\nproducts to decrease or remove unwanted body hair, except for disposable razors. (DFOF\n7 As indicated above, since Konitzer's May 17, 2006 castration attempt, he has lived in a cell at the\nWRC containing a private toilet. (PFOF ยถ 210.)\n35\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 35 of 68   Document 238 \n\nยถยถ 205, 207.)  There have been no instances where depilatory products, Rogaine, or\nPrepuce (finasteride) have been approved for use by any DOC inmate or prescribed for use\nby any DOC physician or medical professional for the treatment of hair loss.  (DFOF ยถ 208.)\nIn any event, Dr. Claiborn opines that hair removal and hair growth products are not\nrequired or necessary for Konitzer's mental health. (DFOF ยถ 209.)\nDr. Gerald Wellens, the former Chief Psychologist at GBCI, oversaw the\npsychological staff and programs at GBCI. (PFOF ยถ 171.)   Dr. Wellens also provided direct\npsychological services to inmates at the institution. Id. Dr. Wellens became involved with\nKonitzer's case in the fall of 1999 following a self-castration attempt by Konitzer. (PFOF ยถ\n172.)  At that time, Konitzer had not begun female hormone therapy. Id.  In his entire\nexperience in the DOC, this was the only castration attempt that came to Dr. Wellens's\nattention. Id.  Initially, Dr. Wellens referred to Konitzer as \"Scott\" or \"Mr. Konitzer.\" (PFOF\nยถ 173.)  After Konitzer corrected him, he quickly began using Donna Dawn or Ms. Konitzer\nin Konitzer's presence. Id.  However, Dr. Wellens was not able to do so in other settings.\nId.  GBCI would not permit the use of Donna Dawn in any context, and he, along with all\nstaff, was verbally ordered by GBCI's warden at the time, Daniel Bertrand, not to refer to\nKonitzer as \"Donna Dawn\" or \"DD.\" Id.\nIn December 1999, Konitzer was placed on female hormone therapy. (PFOF\nยถ 174.)  Following the initiation of female hormone therapy, Dr. Wellens observed female\ndevelopment, such as breasts. Id.  While the hormone therapy provided some relief,\nKonitzer remained distressed because he was not allowed to wear makeup or a bra, and\ncould not be referred to by his preferred female name.  Id.\n36\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 36 of 68   Document 238 \n\nAccording to Dr. R. Ettner, a gynecomastia vest, a supportive undergarment\ndesigned for male breast development, fails to substitute for a bra inasmuch as it does not\nprovide Konitzer with an ego-syntonic state of mind. (PFOF ยถ 179.)  It would not satisfy the\nrecommendation that Konitzer be provided with a bra. Id.  The importance of the female\nattire is to provide Konitzer with an ego-syntonic state of mind. Id.  Canziani testified that\nif you provide one inmate with a bra, then others will want them or be able to order them.\n(PFOF ยถ 188.)\nKonitzer is classified as a low risk for escape.8  (PFOF ยถ 191.)  WRC staff are\nsupposed to check the identification of persons leaving the WRC. (PFOF ยถ 192.)  Women\nprisoners at Taycheedah Correctional Institution (TCI) are permitted to wear makeup, which\nwould present concerns over feigning injury. (PFOF ยถ 193.)\nStaff refusal to treat Konitzer as a female causes him a great deal of pain.\n(PFOF ยถ 197.)  When staff refer to him as a male, it defeats his self-image and serves as\na constant reminder of feeling that he is trapped in the wrong body. Id. Konitzer believes\nthere is nothing more disrespectful and painful than the actions by WRC staff which\nreinforce his biological male status. Id.\nOn July 2, 2002, Phil Kingston, Warden at Columbia Correctional Institution,\nwrote a letter to Konitzer. (PFOF Amended ยถ 206.)  In the letter, Kingston states that he\nreviewed Konitzer's correspondence about a job denial. Id. Kingston further states that\n8Konitzerโs Program Review Inmate Risk Assessment, dated January 26, 2001, indicates a โLowโ\nrating under the escape history category and notes a 1991 escape attempt.  This low rating is in contrast\nto the defendantsโ characterization of Konitzer as high-risk for escape given Konitzerโs sentence length\nand prior escape attempt.  (See DFOF ยถ 180.)  The facts must be taken in Konitzerโs favor.\n37\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 37 of 68   Document 238 \n\nCCI's Security Director, Tim Douma, stated that \"there is no security issue regarding your\nappearance, presentation, or lifestyle issues.โ  Id.\nOn January 24, 2006, Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m) became effective.  Section\n302.386(5m), which codifies the Inmate Sex Change Prevention Act, 2005 Wis. Act 105,\nwas prompted by this lawsuit.\nOn December 1, 2005, Dr. Speech wrote to Konitzer regarding his statement\nthat his treatment at the WRC did not meet the Standards of Care:\nYour  request  presumes  we  are  or  will  be  providing  you\ntreatment for the gender identity disorder; we have consistently\nsaid such treatment is outside the realm of expertise and that\nwe did not consider this a focus of treatment for you here at\nWRC.  Unless the court says otherwise, you are not here for\nGID treatment.\n(Cothroll Suppl. Decl., Ex. 213.)\nOn or about March 24, 2006, the WRC stopped selling \"Majic Shave\" in its\ncanteen. (PFOF ยถ 211.)  Majic Shave is a cream that removes hair without requiring a razor.\nIn other words, it is a type of \"depilatory.\" Id.  Currently Majic Shave is sold in at least two\nDOC institutions, Waupun Correctional Institution and Oshkosh Correctional Institution. Id.\nIII.  ANALYSIS\nThe defendants contend that:  (1) they are entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law on Konitzer's medical experts' recommendations 1-10 and 12-14 for injunctive relief\nbecause there is no evidence that the defendants have or would be deliberately indifferent\nto any serious medical need Konitzer may have absent such injunctive relief9; and (2) the\n9 The defendants do not contend that recommendation 11, that Konitzer continue on hormone\nreplacement therapy, is ripe for summary judgment. According to the defendants, given the new law, Wis.\nStat. ยง 302.386(5m), that prevents the DOC from continuing the administration of hormones to inmates,\n38\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 38 of 68   Document 238 \n\ncourt should decline to issue injunctive relief and should not adopt the recommendations\nthat only female officers conduct strip searches of Konitzer, Konitzer be provided with\nmakeup and female undergarments, Konitzer be addressed by a female name, and\nKonitzer  be  allowed  the  use  of  hair  removal/growth  products  because  such\nrecommendations are contrary to the WRC and the DOC's legitimate institutional interests\nand beyond the relief allowed under the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act.\nKonitzer contends that: (1) as a matter of law, his GID is a serious medical\nneed for which he is entitled to treatment under the Eighth Amendment; (2) summary\njudgment should be denied because his treatment by the defendants does not stem from\nany medical judgment but rather strict adherence to Directive #68; (3) there is a material\nfactual dispute as to whether his GID requires deference to administrative decisions based\non vague security risks and theoretical management issues; (4) Rooker-Feldman does not\napply because he is not seeking review or rejection of the state court's denial of his petition\nfor a legal name change; and (5) his hormone treatment should be established and closely\nmonitored.\nTo establish liability under the Eighth Amendment, a prisoner must show: (1)\nthat his medical need was objectively serious; and (2) that the official acted with deliberate\nindifference to the prisoner's health or safety.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\n(1994); Chapman v. Keltner, 241 F.3d 842, 845 (7th Cir. 2001); see also Estelle v. Gamble,\n429 U.S. 97,104-05 (1976); Zentmyer v. Kendall County, Ill., 220 F.3d 805, 810 (7th Cir.\n2000).\nand the DOC's obligation to follow the new law, recommendation 11 creates a disputed issue of material\nfact. (Defs.'

Factors that\nindicate a serious medical need include \"the existence of an injury that a reasonable doctor\nor patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; the presence of a\nmedical condition that significantly affects an individual's daily activities; or the existence of\nchronic and substantial pain.\" Gutierrez, 111 F.3d at 1373 (citations omitted).  A medical\ncondition need not be life-threatening to qualify as serious and to support a ยง 1983 claim,\nproviding the denial of medical care could result in further significant injury or in the\nunnecessary infliction of pain.

Relevant Case Law\n40\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 40 of 68   Document 238 \n\nAs an initial matter, the court recognizes that claims regarding GID, although\nunusual, are not unprecedented:\nIn  view  of  the  general  lack  of  public  knowledge  and\nunderstanding of gender identity disorders, the idea that an\nimprisoned male murderer may ever have a right to receive\nfemale  hormones  and  sex  reassignment  surgery  may\nunderstandably strike  some as bizarre. However, Kosilek's\nclaims  raise  issues  involving  substantial  jurisprudence\nconcerning the application of the Eighth Amendment to inmates\nwith serious medical needs. This case requires the neutral\napplication of the principles that emerge from that jurisprudence\nto the facts established by the evidence in this case.\nKosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156, 160 (D. Mass. 2002). The court turns to a review\nof case law containing claims brought by prisoners with GID issues.\nThe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has issued two opinions on this topic.\nIn Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987), the court held that an inmate\nstated a valid claim under the Eighth Amendment in connection with denial of medical\ntreatment for transsexualism, reversing the lower court's dismissal of the complaint for\nfailure to state a claim. The prisoner in that case was a biological male who underwent nine\nyears of estrogen therapy before incarceration. Id. at 410.  Once incarcerated the inmate\nwas denied all medical treatmentโchemical, psychiatric or otherwiseโfor his GID and\nrelated medical needs. Id.  In concluding that the complaint stated a claim, the court found\nthat transsexualism was a serious medical need. Id. at 411-13. In doing so it defined\ntranssexualism as:\nโa condition that exists when a physiologically normal person\n(i.e., not a hermaphrodite - a person whose sex is not clearly\ndefined due to a congenital condition) experiences discomfort\nor discontent about nature's choice of his or her particular sex\nand prefers to be the other sex. This discomfort is generally\naccompanied by a desire to utilize hormonal, surgical, and civil\n41\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 41 of 68   Document 238 \n\nprocedures to allow the individual to live in his or her preferred\nsex role. The diagnosis is appropriate only if the discomfort has\nbeen continuous for at least two years, and is not due to\nanother mental disorder, such as schizophrenia . . . .

Eastern Airlines, Inc., 742 F.2d 1081, 1083 n.3 (7th Cir.\n1984))  (alteration  in  original).    Additionally,  the  court  determined  that  the  complaint\ncontained allegations indicating that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to that\nneed because they \"failed to provide the plaintiff with any kind of medical treatment, not\nmerely hormone therapy, for her gender dysphoria.\" Id. at 413.  The court went on to say,\nWe therefore conclude that plaintiff has stated a valid claim\nunder the Eighth Amendment which, if proven, would entitle her\nto some kind of medical treatment. It is important to emphasize,\nhowever, that she does not have a right to any particular type\nof treatment, such as estrogen therapy which appears to be the\nfocus of her complaint. The only two federal courts to have\nconsidered the issue have refused to recognize a constitutional\nright under the Eighth Amendment to estrogen therapy provided\nthat some other treatment option is made available. See Supre\nv. Ricketts, 792 F.2d 958 (10th Cir.1986); Lamb v. Maschner,\n633  F.  Supp.  351  (D.  Kan.  1986).  Both  of  these  courts\nnevertheless agreed that a transsexual inmate is constitutionally\nentitled to some type of medical treatment.\nIn Supre v. Ricketts, the plaintiff, an inmate in the Colorado\nDepartment  of  Corrections,  was  examined  by  two\nendocrinologists and a psychiatrist. These doctors considered\nestrogen treatment, but ultimately advised against it, citing the\ndangers associated with this controversial form of therapy.\n42\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 42 of 68   Document 238 \n\nInstead they prescribed testosterone replacement therapy and\nmental health treatment consisting of a program of counseling\nby psychologists and psychiatrists. Given the wide variety of\noptions available for the treatment of the plaintiffโs psychological\nand physical medical conditions, the Tenth Circuit refused to\nhold that the decision not to provide the plaintiff with estrogen\nviolated the Eighth Amendment as long as some treatment for\ngender dysphoria was provided. Similarly, in Lamb v. Maschner,\nthe plaintiff, an inmate at the Kansas State Penitentiary, had\nbeen evaluated by medical doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists\nand social workers and was undergoing some type of mental\ntreatment. As a result of this treatment, the court held that the\ndefendant prison officials were not constitutionally required to\nprovide the plaintiff with pre-operative hormone treatment and\na sex change operation.\nThe courts in Supre and Lamb both emphasized that a different\nresult would be required in a case where there had been a total\nfailure to provide any kind of medical attention at all. That is\nprecisely the type of case before us. We agree with the Tenth\nCircuit that given the wide variety of options available for the\ntreatment of gender dysphoria and the highly controversial\nnature of some of those options, a federal court should defer to\nthe informed judgment of prison officials as to the appropriate\nform of medical treatment. But no such informed judgment has\nbeen made here. While we can and will not prescribe any\noverall plan of treatment, the plaintiff has stated a claim under\nthe Eighth Amendment entitling her to some kind of medical\ncare.\nId. at 413-14.\nThe other Seventh Circuit case is Maggert v. Hanks, 131 F.3d 670 (7th Cir.\n1997).  In Maggert, the district court's dismissal of the action was affirmed because the\nprisoner failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that he had GID.  Id. at 671.\nHowever,  the Court of Appeals went on to address \"a broader issue, having to do with the\nsignificance of gender dysphoria in prisoners' civil rights litigation.\"  Id.  First, it defined\ngender dysphoria, \"the condition in which a person believes that he is imprisoned in a body\n43\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 43 of 68   Document 238 \n\nof the wrong sex, that though biologically a male (the more common form of the condition)\nhe is 'really a female,'\" as a \"serious psychiatric disorder.\" Id.  Treatment, or \"the cure,\" for\ntranssexualism, was discussed as well:\nThe cure for the male transsexual consists not of psychiatric\ntreatment  designed  to  make  the  patient  content  with  his\nbiological sexual identity - that doesn't work - but of estrogen\ntherapy designed to create the secondary sexual characteristics\nof a woman followed by the surgical removal of the genitals and\nthe construction of a vagina-substitute out of penile tissue.\n. . .\nSomeone eager to undergo this mutilation is plainly suffering\nfrom a profound psychiatric disorder.\nId.  However, prisons do not necessarily have a duty to authorize these hormonal and\nsurgical curative procedures:\nWithholding from a prisoner an esoteric medical treatment that\nonly the wealthy can afford does not strike us as a form of cruel\nand unusual punishment. It is not unusual; and we cannot see\nwhat is cruel about refusing a benefit to a person who could not\nhave obtained the benefit if he had refrained from committing\ncrimes.  We  do  not  want  transsexuals  committing  crimes\nbecause it is the only route to obtaining a cure.\nIt  is  not  the  cost  per  se  that  drives  this  conclusion.  For\nlife-threatening  or  crippling  conditions,  Medicaid  and  other\npublic-aid,  insurance,  and  charity  programs  authorize\ntreatments that often exceed $100,000. Gender dysphoria is\nnot, at least not yet, generally considered a severe enough\ncondition to warrant expensive treatment at the expense of\nothers than the person suffering from it. That being so, making\nthe  treatment  a  constitutional  duty  of  prisons  would  give\nprisoners a degree of medical care that they could not obtain if\nthey obeyed the law.\n44\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 44 of 68   Document 238 \n\nId. at 672.  Lastly, the Seventh Circuit stated: \"We conclude that, except in special\ncircumstances that we do not at present foresee, the Eighth Amendment does not entitle\na prison inmate to curative treatment for his gender dysphoria.\"  Id. at 672.\nIn Phillips v. Michigan Department of Corrections, 731 F. Supp. 792, 801\n(W.D. Mich. 1990), the court granted a prisoner's motion for preliminary injunction ordering\ncorrectional officials to provide the inmate with estrogen therapy. The prisoner in that case\nwas a thirty-four-year-old male-to-female transsexual who lived as a woman since she was\nseventeen.  Id. at 793-94.  Prior to incarceration, she had a number of \"surgeries and other\nprocedures to enhance her appearance as a female, including electrolysis, a brow lift,\ndermabrasions, a chemical face peel, jaw reduction, a chin implant, and breast implant\nsurgery.\"  Id. at 794.  In addition, the inmate took estrogen treatment starting at the age of\nseventeen or eighteen to slow hair growth, soften skin, develop the breast implants, and\nfurther develop female characteristics.  Id.  Not long after her incarceration, the plaintiff was\nexamined by a Michigan Department of Corrections physician who stopped the hormonal\ntreatments and denied her requests for brassieres. Id.  The prisoner's request for brassieres\nwas later granted, after the physician's supervisor intervened.  Id.  In granting the request\nfor a preliminary injunction, the court found that the prisoner had a serious medical need\nand that the defendant denied her medical care through both intentional conduct and\ndeliberate indifference:\nThe denial of medical care in this case stems from at least\nthree sources - which in concert violate plaintiff's right under the\nconstitution to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. A\nresult decried in Meriwether and in dicta by the Supre and\nLamb courts is present here: defendant has failed to provide\nplaintiff with treatment of any kind. And, as was the plaintiff in\n45\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 45 of 68   Document 238 \n\nMeriwether,  plaintiff  has  been  the  subject  of  ridicule  and\noffensive remarks at the hands of Dr. Opika. Third, this Court\ncharacterizes defendant's conduct in this case as conduct\nwhich actually reversed the therapeutic effects of previous\ntreatment. It is one thing to fail to provide an inmate with care\nthat would improve his or her medical state, such as refusing to\nprovide  sex  reassignment  surgery  or  to  operate  on  a\nlong-endured cyst. Taking measures which actually reverse the\neffects of years of healing medical treatment, as I observe here,\nis  measurably  worse,  making  the  cruel  and  unusual\ndetermination much easier.\nId. at 800 (footnote omitted).\nIn Kosilek v. Maloney, 221 F. Supp. 2d 156, 158 (D. Mass. 2002), plaintiff\nKosilek  was  a  male-to-female  transsexual  sentenced  to  life  in  prison.    Since  his\nincarceration in 1990, Kosilek had tried to access proper diagnosis and treatment, but his\nclaims were consistently denied by the institution. Id. at 159. While incarcerated, he tried\nto commit suicide on two occasions and to castrate himself. Id. at 158. Kosilek also\ncomplained of being in severe mental anguish. Id.  He sued the Massachusetts Department\nof Corrections and Commissioner Michael Maloney, who in 2000 had adopted a blanket\npolicy regarding the treatment of transsexuals in prisons. Id.  Under the policy, transsexuals\nwho had received treatment by doctors prior to incarceration could have that treatment\ncontinued after incarceration; however, transsexuals taking hormones that had not been\nprescribed by a doctor were not permitted to continue hormone usage in prison. Id. at\n159-60. The policy also denied the possibility of any inmate receiving gender reassignment\nsurgery. Id. at 160.  Because Kosilek's transsexualism was undiagnosed, the policy denied\nhim access to doctors for treatment and diagnosis of GID. Id.\n46\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 46 of 68   Document 238 \n\nThe court found that Kosilek's GID was a serious medical need. Id. at 184.\nKosilek's GID \"has prompted him to attempt suicide twice while incarcerated, and to try to\ncastrate himself as well. There is a significant risk that he will attempt to kill, mutilate, or\notherwise harm himself again if he is not afforded adequate treatment for this disorder.\" Id.\nNext, the court found that Kosilek had not been offered adequate treatment for the serious\nmedical need in that \"[t]he services now being offered Kosilek are not sufficient to diminish\nhis intense emotional distress, and the related risks of suicide and self-mutilation, to the\npoint at which he would no longer be at a substantial risk of serious harm.\" Id. at 185. The\ncourt reasoned that \"no informed medical judgment has been made by the DOC concerning\nwhat treatment is necessary to treat adequately Kosilek's severe gender identity disorder.\"\nId. at 186.  The Massachusetts Department of Corrections policy, also known as the\nGuidelines, prevented an individualized medical assessment:\nHowever, the Guidelines preclude the possibility that Kosilek\nwill ever be offered hormones or sex reassignment surgery,\nwhich are the treatments commensurate with modern medical\nscience  that  prudent  professionals  in  the  United  States\nprescribe  as  medically  necessary  for  some,  but  not  all,\nindividuals  suffering  from  gender  identity  disorders.  The\nGuidelines, in effect, prohibit forms of treatment that may be\nnecessary to provide Kosilek any real treatment. Maloney's\ndecision to implement the Guidelines precluded the medical\nprofessionals and social workers he employs and regularly\nrelies upon from even considering whether hormones should be\nprescribed to treat Kosilek's severe gender identity disorder.\nId. at 186 (internal citation omitted). Thus, the court concluded that Kosilek satisfied the\nobjective component of the Eighth Amendment.  Id. at 189.\nHowever, the court found that Maloney's failure to provide Kosilek with\nadequate care had not been due to deliberate indifference.  Id. at 189-92.  It pointed out\n47\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 47 of 68   Document 238 \n\nthat his actions were like those of \"a defendant with a legal problem\" and were not taken\nto inflict pain on Kosilek.  Id. at 162, 191.  Finally, the court found that Maloney was not\nlikely to be indifferent to Kosilek's serious medical need in the future.  Id. at 193-95.  It\nreasoned that Maloney \"is now on notice that Kosilek's severe gender identity disorder\nconstitutes a serious medical need\" and, therefore, \"the DOC has a duty to provide Kosilek\nadequate treatment.\"  Id. at 193.\nIt  is  permissible  for  the  DOC  to  maintain  a  presumptive\nfreeze-frame  policy.  However,  decisions  as  to  whether\npsychotherapy, hormones, and/or sex reassignment surgery are\nnecessary to treat Kosilek adequately must be based on an\n\"individualized medical evaluation\" of Kosilek rather than as \"a\nresult of a blanket rule.\"  Those decisions must be made by\nqualified  professionals.    Such  professionals  must  exercise\nsound medical judgment, based upon prudent professional\nstandards, particularly the Standards of Care.\nThus, the court expects that Maloney will follow the DOC's\nusual policy and practice of allowing medical professionals to\nassess what is necessary to treat Kosilek.  As the DOC does\nnot employ anyone with expertise in treating gender identity\ndisorders, the DOC may decide to follow its regular practice of\nretaining  an  outside  expert  to  evaluate  Kosilek  and  to\nparticipate in treating, or recommending treatment for him.\nThe evidence demonstrates that, at a minimum, Kosilek should\nreceive genuine psychotherapy from, or under the direction of,\nsomeone qualified by training and experience to address a\nsevere gender identity disorder.  It will be Kosilek's obligation to\ncooperate  in  establishing  a  proper  relationship  with  his\ntherapist(s). The Standards of Care indicate that such therapy,\nor such therapy and pharmacology, may be sufficient to reduce\nthe anguish caused by Kosilek's gender identity disorder so that\nit no longer constitutes a serious medical need.\nIf psychotherapy, and possibly psychopharmacology, do not\neliminate the significant risk of serious harm that now exists,\nconsideration should be given to whether hormones should be\nprescribed to treat Kosilek.  Administering female hormones to\na male prisoner in a male prison could raise genuine security\n48\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 48 of 68   Document 238 \n\nconcerns.  Maloney would be entitled to consider whether those\nconcerns make it necessary to deny Kosilek care that the\nmedical professionals regard as required to provide minimally\nadequate treatment for his serious medical need.\n. . . .\nAs the Standards of Care explain, \"hormone therapy alone may\nprovide sufficient symptomatic relief to obviate the need for\ncross-living  or  surgery.\"   If  psychotherapy,  hormones,  and\npossibly psychopharmacology are not sufficient to reduce the\nanguish caused by Kosilek's gender identity disorder to the\npoint that there is no longer a substantial risk of serious harm\nto him, sex reassignment surgery might be deemed medically\nnecessary.  Id. at 18.  If that occurs, Maloney may consider\nwhether security requirements make it truly necessary to deny\nKosilek adequate care for his serious medical need.  If and\nwhen he makes such a decision, a court may have to determine\nagain whether the Eighth Amendment has been violated.\nId. at 193-95 (citations omitted).\nIn De'Lonta v. Angelone, 330 F.3d 630 (4th Cir. 2003), the court of appeals\nreversed the district court's dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim. The\nprisoner in that case, a biological male, had GID and was incarcerated in the custody of the\nVirginia Department of Corrections since 1983. Id. at 632. Department of Corrections\ndoctors diagnosed the prisoner with GID and the prisoner received estrogen therapy from\n1993 until 1995, at which time the treatment was terminated pursuant to a new Department\nof Corrections policy. Id. The policy provided that neither medical nor surgical interventions\nrelated to gender or sex change would be provided to inmates with GID. Id. Inmates\nentering prison taking hormone medication or already receiving such medication were to be\ninformed of the policy and then the medication would be tapered immediately and afterward\ndiscontinued. Id. Following termination of his hormone medication, the prisoner developed\n49\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 49 of 68   Document 238 \n\nan uncontrollable urge to mutilate his genitals. Id.  Repeatedly he requested resumption of\nthe hormone therapy and treatment by a gender specialist, however, his requests were\ndenied and the self-mutilation continued. Id. The court held first that the prisoner's \"need\nfor protection against continuous self-mutilation constitutes a serious medical need to which\nprison officials may not be deliberately indifferent.\" Id. at 634 (citing Lee v. Downs, 641 F.2d\n1117,  1121  (4th  Cir.  1981)).    Next,  it  found  that  the  inmate  had  stated  an  Eighth\nAmendment claim by alleging inadequate medical treatment to protect him from his\ncompulsion to mutilate himself. Id. at 635.\nIn Brooks v. Berg, 270 F. Supp. 2d 302 (N.D.N.Y.), vacated in part on other\ngrounds, 289 F. Supp. 2d 286 (N.D.N.Y. 2003), a prisoner, who was a biological male,\ndiagnosed himself with GID. Id. at 304. The prisoner sought treatment by writing letters to\na Mental Health Satellite Unit and to a supervisor; however, he never received a response.\nId. The prisoner then filed his lawsuit alleging that the defendants failed to provide him with\nnecessary medical treatment for his serious medical need in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment and asking the court to force the defendants to allow him to see a doctor\nqualified to propose a course of treatment. Id. at 305-06.  Pursuant to a Department of\nCorrections policy, inmates who could prove that they received hormone therapy prior to\nincarceration might be eligible for continued hormone therapy. Id. at 305. The policy further\nstated that transsexual surgical operations were not honored during incarceration. Id.\nThe court found that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to the\nprisoner's serious medical need:\nDefendants do not contest Plaintiffโs claim that he was never\ntreated  for  GID  notwithstanding  numerous  requests  for\n50\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 50 of 68   Document 238 \n\ntreatment.  In addition, Defendants have not provided the Court\nwith any evidence showing that the decision to refuse Plaintiff\ntreatment  was  based  on  sound  medical  judgment.  Finally,\nDefendants have failed to submit any evidence that they were\nnot  aware  that  Plaintiffโs  health  could  be  jeopardized  if\ntreatment  was  refused.  Accordingly,  the  Court  finds  that\nDefendants have failed to establish, as a matter of law, that\nPlaintiff  was  provided  adequate  treatment  for  his  serious\nmedical needs.\nId. at 310.  The court went on to say:\nThis blanket denial of medical treatment is contrary to a decided\nbody of case law. Prisons must provide inmates with serious\nmedical  needs  some  treatment  based  on  sound  medical\njudgment.  There is no exception to this rule for serious medical\nneeds that are first diagnosed in prison.  Prison officials are\nthus  obliged  to  determine  whether  Plaintiff  has  a  serious\nmedical need and, if so, to provide him with at least some\ntreatment. Prison officials cannot deny transsexual inmates all\nmedical treatment simply by referring to a prison policy which\nmakes a seemingly arbitrary distinction between inmates who\nwere and were not diagnosed with GID prior to incarceration. In\nlight of the numerous cases which hold that prison officials may\nnot deny transsexual inmates all medical attention, especially\nwhen this denial is not based on sound medical judgment, the\nCourt finds that Defendants have failed to establish as a matter\nof law that their actions were objectively reasonable. \nId. at 312.\nIn Praylor v. Texas Department of Criminal Justice, 430 F.3d 1208, 1208-09\n(5th Cir. 2005), a transsexual state prison inmate sought an injunction instructing the Texas\nDepartment  of  Criminal  Justice  [โTDCJโ]  to  provide  him  with  hormone  therapy  and\nbrassieres.  The court simply concluded that the prisoner was not entitled to such treatment.\nThis circuit has not addressed the issue of providing hormone\ntreatment  to  transsexual  inmates.  Other  circuits  that  have\nconsidered the issue have concluded that declining to provide\na transsexual with hormone treatment does not amount to\nacting with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.\nSee,  e.g.,  White  v.  Farrier,  849  F.2d  322  (8th  Cir.  1988)\n51\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 51 of 68   Document 238 \n\n(acknowledging  that  transsexualism  is  a  serious  medical\ncondition, but holding that declining to provide hormone therapy\ndid not constitute deliberate indifference to that medical need);\nMeriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987)\n(holding transsexual prisoner has no constitutional right to \"any\nparticular type of treatment, such as estrogen therapy\"); Supre\nv. Ricketts, 792 F.2d 958, 963 (10th Cir. 1986) (concluding that\ndeclining  to  provide  hormone  therapy  did  not  constitute\ndeliberate indifference when prison officials offered alternate\ntreatment). Assuming, without deciding, that transsexualism\ndoes present a serious medical need, we hold that, on this\nrecord,  the  refusal  to  provide  hormone  therapy  did  not\nconstitute the requisite deliberate indifference.\nIn Praylor's case, the record reflects that he did not request any\nform of treatment other than hormone therapy. Testimony from\nthe medical director at the TDCJ revealed that the TDCJ had a\npolicy for treating transsexuals, but that Praylor did not qualify\nfor hormone therapy because of the length of his term and the\nprison's inability to perform a sex change operation, the lack of\nmedical necessity for the hormone, and the disruption to the\nall-male prison. Cf. De'Lonta v. Angelone, 330 F.3d 630, 635\n(4th Cir. 2003).  Moreover, the director testified that Praylor had\nbeen evaluated on two occasions and denied eligibility for\nhormone treatment and that the TDCJ did provide mental health\nscreening as part of its process for evaluating transsexuals. See\nSupre, 792 F.2d at 963. Accordingly, based upon the instant\nrecord and circumstances of Praylor's complaint, the denial of\nhis specific request for hormone therapy does not constitute\ndeliberate indifference.  See Meriwether, 821 F.2d at 413;\nSupre, 792 F.2d at 963.\nId. at 1209.\nB.  Discussion\nIt is undisputed that in December 1999, the DOC diagnosed Konitzer with GID\nand prescribed hormone therapy.  It is also undisputed that since December 1999, Konitzer\nhas cut open scrotal tissue (following transfer to GBCI); cut skin from his scrotum and tied\ncord around his testes (January 2001); attempted castration  (May 2001); attempted\ncastration  (August  2001);  succeeded  in  partial castration  (October  2001);  attempted\n52\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 52 of 68   Document 238 \n\ncastration (August 2002); and attempted to castrate his remaining teste (May 2006).  In\naddition, Konitzer attempted suicide in January 2001 and July 2003.  With due regard for\nthese undisputed facts, the defendants' statement admitting that Konitzer has a serious\nmedical need for the purpose of summary judgment and the relevant case law lead the\ncourt to the conclusion that Konitzer's GID constitutes a serious medical need. See\nMeriwether, 821 F.2d at 411-13; Maggert, 131 F.3d at 671.\nWhile it is undisputed that Konitzerโs GID is a serious medical need, the\ndefendants contend that they have not been deliberately indifferent to Konitzer's medical\nneed.  The parties disagree whether the defendantsโ failure to follow the Standards of Care\nin treating Konitzerโs GID constitutes a substantial departure from accepted professional\njudgment.  Moreover, they disagree whether the defendantsโ justifications for not providing\nthe real-life experience to Konitzer are supported by a legitimate penological interest. \nDefendants  contend  that  they  have  not  been  deliberately  indifferent  to\nKonitzer's medical need because he has been evaluated consistently and treated by\nmedical professionals.  Konitzer's medical records establish that he has been seen many\ntimes for medical issues since 1999.  (DFOF ยถยถ4 210-588.)  Inasmuch as Konitzer has\nreceived medical attention consistently, the defendants submit that they cannot be found\nto have been deliberately indifferent.  Instead, they submit their course of treatment is\ndifferent from what Konitzer, or his medical experts, would have chosen.  And, because\ndisagreement  with  medical  professionals  about  treatment  needs  does  not  state  a\ncognizable Eighth Amendment claim under the deliberate indifference standard of Estelle\nv. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), the defendants argue that Konitzer's Eighth Amendment\nclaim must fail. Ciarpaglini v. Saini, 352 F.3d 328, 331 (7th Cir. 2003).  Moreover, the\n53\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 53 of 68   Document 238 \n\ndefendants contend, the real-life experience that Konitzer seeks is contrary to the WRC and\nthe DOC's legitimate institutional interest of prison security.  See Helling v. McKinney, 509\nU.S. 25, 37 (1993) (stating that the \"realities of prison administration\" are relevant to the\nissue of deliberate indifference); Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994) (finding that\nunder the Eighth Amendment prison officials must, among other things, take reasonable\nmeasures to guarantee the safety of the inmates).\nDefendants claim the Standards of Care are not necessary for the treatment\nof GID and GID is largely a self-diagnosed condition. (DFOF ยถ 33.)  A patient diagnosed\nwith GID chooses how to live after acknowledging the GID.  (DFOF ยถ 34.)  For individuals\nwith GID, the Standards of Care emphasize the person's choices and options rather than\nspeak of a diagnosis that requires necessary \"treatment.\"  (DFOF ยถ 35.)  The Standards of\nCare put emphasis on flexible choices for individuals with GID.  (DFOF ยถ 36.)  The\nStandards of Care state that they \"are intended to provide flexible directions for the\ntreatment of persons with gender identity disorders.\"  (DFOF ยถ 37; Daley Dep., Sept. 10,\n2004, Ex. 12, Bates No. 5478.)  Moreover, the Standards of Care advise that \"[m]any adults\nwith gender identity disorder find comfortable, effective ways of living that do not involve all\nthe components of the triadic treatment sequence.\"  (DFOF ยถ 38.)  The transgendered\nsituation is about choices, not medical necessity. (DFOF ยถ 39.)  Each transgendered\nindividual decides which options to pursue and how far and how fast to go with regard to\nthose life-changing optionsโbased on age, physical characteristics, income, employment,\npersonality, pain tolerance, and desired lifestyle, among other considerations.  (DFOF ยถ\n40.)  The Standards of Care include a criterion of being crime free.  (DFOF ยถ 41.)  This is\naccepted as the community standard in gender clinics throughout the world.  Id.  However,\n54\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 54 of 68   Document 238 \n\nprison life presents an inherent and irresolvable contradiction to this standard.  Id.  Prison\nlife is a context that renders existing standard treatment guidelines for GID unrealistic and\nimpossible.  (DFOF ยถ 41.)  New treatment guidelines for GID within prisons, with awareness\nof  and  in  consideration  of  the complexities  created by  that  situation,  are  yet  to  be\ndeveloped.  Id.\nOn  the  other  hand,  Konitzer  submits  that  the  Standards  of  Care  were\ndesigned to present professional consensus about psychiatric, medical, and surgical\nmanagement of gender conditions and the parameters within which professionals could\noffer services to individuals. (PFOF ยถ 20.)  The Standards of Care are now in their sixth\nedition, having been revised in 2001.  Id.  The Standards of Care establish a triadic\ntherapeutic sequence (the \"Triadic Therapy\"):  (1) hormone therapy, (2) real-life experience,\nand (3) sex reassignment surgery. (PFOF ยถ 23.)  Typically, the Triadic Therapy takes placed\nin the order of hormones => real-life experience => surgery.  (PFOF ยถ 24.)  A GID patient,\nhowever,  may  undergo  a  variety  of  different  therapeutic  options  because  clinicians\nrecognize that not all persons with GID need or want all three elements of Triadic Therapy.\n(PFOF ยถ 25.)  For a male-to-female GID patient like Konitzer, the first step of the Triadic\nTherapy, hormone therapy, entails the prescription of female hormones like estrogen.\n(PFOF ยถ 26.)  The second step in the Triadic Therapy is the real-life experience, which is\nthe act of fully adopting a new or evolving gender role or gender presentation in everyday\nlife. (PFOF ยถ 27.)  The real-life experience for male-to-female transsexuals includes the\nremoval of unwanted hair, which further consolidates their female identity. (PFOF ยถ 28.)\nHair is also removed with depilatories or lasers.  (PFOF ยถ 29.)  The final step of the Triadic\n55\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 55 of 68   Document 238 \n\nTherapy is sex reassignment surgery.  (PFOF ยถ 30.)  For individuals with profound GID, sex\nreassignment surgery, along with hormone therapy and real-life experience, is a treatment\nthat has proven to be effective.  Id.  Such a therapeutic regimen, when prescribed or\nrecommended by qualified practitioners, is medically indicated and medically necessary.\nId.  Sex reassignment is not \"experimental,\" \"investigational,\" \"elective,\" cosmetic,\" or\noptional in any meaningful sense.  Id.  It constitutes very effective and appropriate treatment\nfor transsexualism or profound GID.  Id.  Psychotherapy is not a component of the Triadic\nTherapy.  (PFOF ยถ 31.)  The goal of psychotherapy, when it is employed, is to help the\nperson live more comfortably within a gender identity and to deal effectively with non-gender\nissues. (PFOF ยถ 32.)  Konitzer is not a good candidate for psychotherapy. (PFOF ยถ 33.)\nTaking the facts in Konitzerโs favor, the Standards of Care suggest necessary\nor recommended treatment for many GID patients.  Further, although some persons may\nchoose not to follow the Triadic Therapy, a reasonable jury could find that components of\nthe Triadic Therapy, including the real-life experience, are appropriate for Konitzer.  Among\nthe evidence supporting this conclusion, is Dr. F. Ettnerโs opinion that refusing to provide\nKonitzer with the real-life experience puts him at risk for castration and self harm, and that\nthe  frustration  of  living  with  an  untreated  gender  condition  always  has  disastrous\nconsequences.  Dr. R. Ettner opined that Konitzer has not received the minimum standard\nof care for the treatment of GID and that many of Konitzer's interventions have been\ncounter-therapeutic.  Her view is that the overarching goal of Konitzer's treatment has been\nto assist him to adapting to life as a male.  Cynthia Osborne stated that every group that\noperates in this country and abroad in the area of GID is familiar with the Standards of Care\n56\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 56 of 68   Document 238 \n\nand recognizes them as guidelines.  (PFOF ยถ 131.)  In defendant Dr. David Burnett's\nunderstanding of the Standards of Care, the real-life experience is a legitimate form of\ntreatment for a GID patient, depending upon that person's individual situation. (PFOF ยถ\n134.)\nMere differences of opinion among medical personnel regarding a plaintiffโs\nappropriate treatment do not give rise to deliberate indifference.  Estate of Cole by Pardue\nv. Fromm, 94 F.3d 254, 261 (7th Cir. 1996).  However, deliberate indifference may be\ninferred โwhen the medical professionalโs decision is such a substantial departure from\naccepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that the person\nresponsible did not base the decision on such a judgment.โ Id.; see also Steele v. Choi, 82\nF.3d 175, 179 (7th Cir. 1996) (citing as examples โthe leg is broken, so it must be set; the\nperson is not breathing, so CPR must be administeredโ).\nโ[T]o prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim โa prisoner is not required to show\nthat he was literally ignored.โโ Greeno v. Daley, 414 F.3d 645, 653-54 (7th Cir. 2005)\n(quoting Sherrod v. Lingle, 223 F.3d 605, 611 (7th Cir. 2000)).  A defendant โs contention\nthat a medical care claim fails because the prisoner โreceived some treatment overlooks the\npossibility that the treatment [the prisoner] did receive was โso blatantly inappropriate as to\nevidence intentional mistreatment likely to seriously aggravateโ his condition.โ  Greeno, 414\nF.3d at 654 (quoting Snipes v. DeTella, 95 F.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\nThis is not a case, as in Meriwether, Phillips, and Brooks, where a prisoner\nhas been denied all medical care for GID.  This case is more analogous to Kosilek, where\n57\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 57 of 68   Document 238 \n\nthe treatment offered for GID is arguably inadequate because the patient keeps exhibiting\nthe behavior seen in GID sufferers, repeated self-castration attempts.  The next level of\ntreatment for Konitzer, according to the Standards of Care, is the real-life experience.\nHowever, most aspects of the real-life experience are unavailable to Konitzer because they\nare contrary to DOC policy as stated in Executive Directive #68. \nTaking all reasonable inferences in a light most favorable to Konitzer, as the\ncourt must do at this stage, a reasonable jury could find that the defendants were\ndeliberately indifferent to Konitzerโs serious medical need when they failed to provide him\nwith the second step of treatment from the Standards of Care, the real-life experience, in\nthe face of his repeated self-mutilations and suicide attempts.  Clearly, what the defendants\nwere doing to treat Konitzer was not working. \nNext, the parties disagree whether denial of the real-life experience is justified\nby prison security concerns. The defendants assert that allowing Konitzer to have the\nreal-life experience would compromise prison security.  According to the defendants, when\nan inmate enhances his differences in appearance or identity, such as appearing more\nfeminine or homosexual in a male prison population, it significantly increases the likelihood\nthat the inmate will be the target of aggression or the center of conflict among the prison\npopulation.  (DFOF ยถ 81.)  The inmate's use of female clothing and undergarments, the use\nof a female name, the use of hair removal products, and feminine makeup products gives\na loud message to all observers.  It says to all inmates that the person is of the female\ngender and is available for sexual conduct; it is seen by all inmates as an open invitation\n58\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 58 of 68   Document 238 \n\nto compete for that person's attention and invites assaults.10  The consequences of\nproviding Konitzer with property items typically associated with females while housed in a\nmale correctional environment, could compromise Konitzerโs safety and security, especially\nconsidering Konitzer's lengthy sentence structure.  (DFOF ยถ 84.) \nFurther, say defendants, the feminization of an inmate increases the work\ndemand of existing staff resources by creating additional property management challenges,\nsuch as making sure that an inmate is not doing a brisk business in the sales or bartering\nof cosmetics or undergarments; resolving disputes over who is eligible to possess such\nitems and who is not eligible; determining whether hair removal products or hair growth\nstimulators are an appropriate product for the general inmate population; finding an\nopportunity for peaceful integration of an inmate to a new living condition as he is being\nmoved from another location; or continuously observing an inmate based upon a perception\nof increased risk.  Staff resources that would be required due to the increases of work\ndemand created by the feminization of an inmate are exceptional, and staff will be drawn\nfrom attending to other operational duties in the institution that are also likely to involve\nsafety and control. (DFOF ยถ 97.)  When an inmate enhances his differences in appearance\nor identity, such as appearing more feminine or homosexual in a male prison population,\nit significantly increases the likelihood that the inmate will be the target of aggression or the\ncenter of conflict among the prison population. (DFOF ยถ 98.) \n10 The defendants' argument that institution security would be compromised by allowing Konitzer\nto enhance his femininity is undermined inasmuch as the DOC has prescribed Konitzer feminizing\nhormone therapy since December 1999.\n59\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 59 of 68   Document 238 \n\nHowever, although a jury may well find that the defendants are justified in\nhaving a blanket policy that does not allow Konitzer to experience life as a female (through\nthe use of modest makeup, womensโ undergarments, female strip searches, facial hair\nremover, and being referred to as a female) in a male institution, on this record the court\ncannot grant summary judgment.  Taking the facts in Konitzerโs favor, modest makeup,\nfemale undergarments, facial hair remover or growth items, and being referred to as a\nfemale are part of the real-life experience.\nWith regard to a bra and makeup, it is undisputed that  Konitzerโs hormone\ntherapy resulted in breast development.  In September 2006, Dr. Kulstad of the UW\nHospital noted that Konitzerโs breasts were โconsistent with [an] adult femaleโ and that while\nhormone therapy provided some relief for GID, Konitzer remained distressed because he\nwas not allowed to wear makeup or a bra.  \nInstead  of  a  bra,  the  WRC  provided  Konitzer  with  a  male-appropriate\nundergarment.    Unlike  a  bra,  a  support  undergarment  for  men  who  suffer  from\ngynecomastia is a vest that acts to bind.  (PFOF ยถ 180.)  It is a garment that a female-to-\nmale transsexual may use to disguise breast development.  Id.  A supportive undergarment\ndesigned for gynecomastia does not support the breasts, but damages them.  Id.  It is\nextremely tight and does not provide any support for Konitzerโs breasts. (PFOF ยถ 181.)\nInstead it crushes them against Konitzerโs chest wall and is very painful.  Id.\nFurther, according to Dr. R. Ettner, the gynecomastia vest fails to substitute\nfor a bra inasmuch as it does not provide Konitzer with an ego-syntonic state of mind.\n(PFOF ยถ 179.)  The importance of the female attire is to  provide Konitzer with an\nego-syntonic state of mind. Id.  )  In Dr. Claibornโs opinion, the use of female undergarments\n60\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 60 of 68   Document 238 \n\nis a choice on the part of Konitzer.  However, Dr. Kulstad stated that a bra was medically\nnecessary.  Dr. Wellens felt that things like makeup and female underwear were necessary\nto alleviate Konitzerโs psychological distress.  (PFOF ยถ 175.)  So, he would serve as a go-\nbetween for Konitzer and Warden Bertrand.  Id.  \nThus, rather than providing Konitzer with a supportive undergarment, the\nWRC has provided him with an undergarment that may cause him physical pain and fails\nto address his GID.\nMakeup and items such as depilatories and hair growth stimulators are similar\nto feminine clothing for purposes of Konitzerโs GID treatment.  According to Dr. R. Ettner,\nthe hair-related items may appear superficial or not medical but in fact play a prominent role\nin the treatment of GID and allow the patient to move from a discordant and uncomfortable\nlife that interferes with their functioning into a safer and more comfortable gendered\necology.  Again, Dr. Wellens believed things like makeup and female underwear were\nnecessary to alleviate Konitzerโs psychological distress and Dr. Kulstad noted that Konitzer\nwas distressed because he was not allowed to wear makeup.\nSimilarly, sufficient evidence exists in the record that use of a female name\nmay be required for Konitzerโs treatment.  For instance, Dr. Wellens observed after Konitzer\nwas placed on hormone therapy that while the hormone therapy provided some relief,\nKonitzer remained distressed because he could not be referred to by his preferred female\nname.  Konitzer has stated that staff refusal to treat Konitzer as a female causes him a\ngreat deal of pain, defeats his self-image and serves as a constant reminder of feeling that\nhe is trapped in the wrong body.  (PFOF ยถ 197.) \n61\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 61 of 68   Document 238 \n\nDefendants argue security concerns.  As to a bra, defendants say the largest\nsecurity concern with allowing Konitzer to wear female undergarments is furthering him\nbeing identified as a female in the prison population.  (DFOF ยถ 169.)  However, Konitzer has\nbreastsโbra or no bra.  Notably, upon meeting Konitzer for the first time, WRC inmate\nWayne Polakowski thought he was a woman. (PFOF ยถ 167.)  Thus, a reasonable jury could\nfind that Konitzer looks female enough such that the addition of a bra will make little\ndifference in singling him out among the male prison population.\n Barstow and Canziani opine that if one male inmate has a bra, others will\nwant them and security issues will arise.  But other than this conclusory opinion, no\nevidence suggests that other inmates desire bras  or  that other inmates are denied\nrecommended treatment items because others may desire them, too.  Further, although\nsome inmates have commented to Konitzer about his living situation, such as his shuttering\nthe window of his cell when using the toilet, none has been negative, nor has Konitzer been\nassaulted since May 17, 2006, even though he has possessed womenโs undergarments in\nviolation of WRC rules.  \nTheodore Witheril has visited Konitzer several times and has observed\nKonitzer wearing bras because the bra straps were visible as an outline underneath his\nshirts and because Konitzer told Witheril that he was wearing bras.   (PFOF ยถ 169.)  WRC\ninmate Wayne Polakowski has been incarcerated with Konitzer since June 2004, and has\nobserved Konitzer wearing his clothes in a feminine manner, but is not aware of any\nproblems between other inmates and Konitzer because of his appearance.  (PFOF ยถ 168.)\nDr. Wellens observed at GBCI that Konitzer was respected by inmates and was not aware\nof a single instance of hostility towards him by another inmate.  (DFOF ยถ 185.)\n62\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 62 of 68   Document 238 \n\nKonitzer is not allowed to possess or use makeup because he could use it to\ndisguise his appearance and identity and escape from the institution. (DFOF ยถ 177.)  An\ninmate at Waupun Correctional Institution almost escaped from that institution after a visitor\nof the inmate came in and provided makeup to the inmate, who used it to nearly make it\npast the guard station because he looked like a female visitor.  (DFOF ยถ 178.)  For\ncorrectional staff members who are trained to look for males leaving the institution, say\ndefendants, it is much more difficult if they have to be concerned about males made up to\nlook like females.  (DFOF ยถ 179.)  And, argue defendants, given Konitzerโs sentence\nstructure and escape history, he is classified as a high risk for escape attempt.  (DFOF ยถ\n180.)\nBut a reasonable jury could find that this is a poor reason for denying Konitzer\nmodest makeup.  Again, Konitzer looks like a woman with or without the makeup; makeup\nmay not change his appearance much at all.  And WRC staff are supposed to check the\nidentification of persons leaving the WRC.  (PFOF ยถ 192.)  Further, Konitzerโs risk\nassessment indicates a low rating for escape history.  (PFOF ยถ 191.)\nAdditionally, say defendants, possessing makeup could put Konitzer in a\nposition of being in control of something that other inmates may want.  (DFOF ยถ 182.)\nContraband moves, and Konitzer can be offered money for things that other inmates want.\n(DFOF ยถ 183.)  Further, if the makeup is in the hands of other inmates it could be used to\nfeign an injury, such as a black eye to lure a staff member or other inmate to an inmatesโs\nroom.  But while Dr. Wellens was Chief Psychologist at GBCI, he observed Konitzer wearing\nmakeup regularly without any apparent problems.  Polakowski has observed Konitzer\nwearing makeup and is not aware of any problems between other inmates and Konitzer.\n63\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 63 of 68   Document 238 \n\nDefendants have pointed to no instances of Konitzer selling makeup items.  And women\nprisoners at Taycheedah Correctional Institution are permitted to wear makeup, which\nwould  present  similar  concerns  over  feigning  injury  yet  it  appears  that  makeup  is\nacceptable to the DOC when it is used by women prisoners.\nDefendants  have  not  provided  sufficient  security  reasons  regarding\ndepilatories or Rogaine such that summary judgment could be granted.  Majic Shave is sold\nin Waupun Correctional Institution and Oshkosh Correctional Institution.  (PFOF ยถ 211.)\nFemale inmates housed at Taycheedah Correctional Institution appear to be permitted\nRogaine or other type of hair growth stimulators for medical purposes.  (DFOF ยถยถ 205, 207.)\nAlthough there have been no instances where hair-related products have been approved\nfor use by any DOC inmate or prescribed for use by any DOC medical professional for the\ntreatment of hair loss (DFOF ยถ 208), Konitzerโs treatment would be for GID, not a less\nserious hair loss issue.\nIn addition, summary judgment must be denied as to Konitzerโs use of a\nfemale name or identification by female pronouns.  Defendants argue that DOC inmates are\nprohibited from using false names and titles; they are not allowed to call themselves doctor\nif they are not a doctor, nor are they allowed to call themselves by nicknames, by their rank\nin a gang, or by religious titles.  Calling inmates by names other than their legal names\ncreates order and maintenance issues at a prison, presenting identity problems, escape\nissues, and power and control issues with inmates.  (DFOF ยถ 147.)  Staff need to know who\nan inmate is at the immediate time wherever they are, and they need to be accountable for\ntheir first and last name and inmate number.  That is how the WRC identifies people, how\n64\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 64 of 68   Document 238 \n\nstaff members maintain order, and how staff members ensure that inmates do not have\npower over other inmates. \nFurther, say defendants, allowing Konitzer to use a name other than the name\nunder which he was incarcerated, would be treating him differently than other inmates who\nmay want to use a name other than their legal name.  The Wisconsin Administrative Code\nยง DOC 303.31 makes it a disciplinary offense for any inmate to use a name other than the\nname by which the inmate was committed to the department unless the name was legally\nchanged. (DFOF ยถ 151.)  This is uniformly enforced for legitimate penological purposes.\nAllowing inmates to use nicknames or other titles would allow inmates to have a power\nrelationship relative to other inmates.  (DFOF ยถ 152.)  In the past, inmates have used these\nterms, such as religious or gang titles, to exert their will, control, influence, and power over\nother inmates.  Allowing inmates to identify themselves by something other than their legal\nnames would enable them to misrepresent themselves to the public and could lead to\npredatory behavior and victimization.\nFurther, according to defendants, the database system used by the DOC's\nDivision of Adult Institutions does not allow for more than one name to be used for the DOC\nnumber assigned to an offender.  (DFOF ยถ 155.)   This system carries essential information\nconcerning  each  inmate  offender,  including  background  information,  convictions,\ninstitutional transfer histories, program review actions, etc.  DOC staff need to be able to\nquickly and uniformly identify any given inmate at any given time to access essential\ninformation about the inmate. (DFOF ยถ 156.)  Allowing an inmate to use a name other than\nhis or her legal name could also cause tracking problems for victim notifications.  (DFOF ยถ\n157.)  Victims may be confused if a notification letter came that did not have the offender's\n65\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 65 of 68   Document 238 \n\nlegal name listed.  In addition, if a victim is not already in the system but later wishes to\nenroll for notification and only provides the inmate's old name, DOC may have difficulty\nfinding the offender in the system.\nAgain, this is a jury issue.  Referring to Konitzer by female pronouns does not\nappear to impinge on any of these security issues.  Moreover, verbal reference about\nKonitzer or use of a female name in Konitzerโs presence would not require any change to\nthe DOCโs database system or victim notification system.  And the court is unpersuaded\nthat staff at WRC will not know who Konitzer is when he uses his last name and prisoner\nidentification number with โDonna Dawnโ rather than โScott.โ  Further, Cynthia Osborne\nnoted that the DOC should consider use of an inmate's chosen name and feminine\npronouns by all treatment, security and administrative personnel, which can be done without\npursuit of a legal name change.\nHowever, in one respect summary judgment has been granted, and that is in\nregard to strip searches.  Although the WRC will not tolerate deliberate mistreatment related\nto strip searches conducted on Konitzer, such as unnecessary lookers, the WRCโs practices\nrelated to strip searches do not differ from the DOC, and it is reasonable that the practices\nbe consistent.  Order is very important in a prison environment. Therefore, Konitzer is strip\nsearched and pat searched in accordance with DOC administrative rules.\nIt would become a management issue if the WRC were required to have only\nfemale officers strip search and pat search Konitzer.  (DFOF ยถ 124.)  Each correctional\ninstitution is operated with a specific number of established \"posts.\"  (DFOF ยถ 125.)  These\nare locations where specific tasks are performed critical to the safe and controlled operation\nof the facility.  It is essential that the posts in correctional institutions remain in operation.\n66\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 66 of 68   Document 238 \n\n(DFOF ยถ 126.)  Staff is seldom pulled from posts except in the most extreme circumstances.\nOccasionally, where some scheduling overlaps or staff may be temporarily assigned from\njobs that do not staff posts, they are available for reassignment. (DFOF ยถ 127.)  It is best\nto leave the judgment to make reassignment up to the institution shift commander of the\nmoment because he or she is closest to the conditions to exercise the best judgment.\nIt is not possible for the DOC to ensure that Konitzer will be pat searched or\nstrip searched by female staff. (DFOF ยถ 137.)  Also, staffing patterns and staff resources\nmay not allow for this to occur.  The availability of female correctional officers is controlled\nby the number of female officers employed at an institution, and staff who may be on leave.\nLabor contracts also affect the number of male and female correctional staff at institutions.\nThere may be occasions when a female on any given shift is not available due to these\nfactors.  To create work positions merely for the purpose of ensuring that a female is\navailable  at  all  times  to  pat  search  or  strip  search  Konitzer  is impractical  and  cost\nprohibitive. (DFOF ยถ 138.)\nThe record indicates that Dr. R. Ettner cannot predict that being searched by\na male guard would cause Konitzer harm, only that it would be extremely agitating for\nKonitzer.  (DFOF ยถ 130.)  And, in Dr. Claiborn's opinion, requiring that Konitzer be searched\nby female security officers only does not constitute a necessity and cannot be construed as\n\"treatment\" for Konitzer.  (DFOF ยถ 131.)  Additionally, Dr. Claiborn believes that examination\nby male personnel will not harm Konitzer.\nKonitzer's situation is not unique or new to DOC.  (DFOF ยถ 136.)  There have\nbeen other inmates with breast development or gender issues that have been managed in\nadult male institutions. These inmates with similar situations have been managed safely\n67\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 05/10/10   Page 67 of 68   Document 238 \n\nwithout special accommodations for searches.  Male officers perform the strip searches of\nthese other inmates with breast development or gender issues. \nOn these facts, no reasonable jury could find that defendants have been\ndeliberately indifferent to Konitzerโs medical needs in regard to strip searches, and summary\njudgment has been granted as to this issue.  However, as to all other issues raised in\ndefendantsโ summary judgment motion, summary judgment has been denied.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 10th day of May, 2010.\nBY THE COURT\n/s/ C.

Todd;  and  the  defendants  appeared  by  Assistant  Attorney  General  Jody  J.\nSchmelzer.\nThe plaintiff, a Wisconsin prison inmate, brings this civil rights action under 42\nU.S.C. ยง1983 and the Eighth Amendment to redress an alleged deprivation of rights and\nimmunities, under color of state laws.  The plaintiff claims that the defendants refuse to\nprovide the plaintiff adequate medical care necessary for the treatment of plaintiffโs Gender\nIdentity Disorder (GID).  The Third Amended Complaint asserts, in part, that the defendants\nhave unreasonably jeopardized the plaintiffโs future health and that they are deliberately\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 01/20/06   Page 1 of 5   Document 150 \n\nindifferent to the plaintiffโs serious medical needs under the Eighth Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution.\nAlso pending before the court is the defendantsโ motion for summary judgment\nbrought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.  The motion was accompanied by supporting briefs,\naffidavits, exhibits and proposed findings.  Opposing submissions have been filed by the\nplaintiff and the motion will be decided in due course.\nThe plaintiffโs emergency motion of January 17, filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 65, asks this court to direct the defendants and persons acting under their authority to\ncontinue administration of the hormonal therapy that the plaintiff has been receiving while in\nthe defendantsโ custody at the Wisconsin Resource Center.  According to the plaintiffโs brief\nand declarations by Frederic M. Ettner, M.D. and one of the  plaintiffโs attorneys, Leon W.\nTodd, the plaintiff has been receiving female hormonal and anti-adrogen therapy since 1999\nfor treatment of GID.  They submit that Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m), enacted January 6, 2006,\nalso known as the โInmate Sex Change Prevention Act,โ will become effective on January 24,\n2006, and that pursuant to the statute, the defendants will begin reducing the plaintiffโs\nhormone  therapy with  the  intention  of  eventually  stopping  it  completely.    The  papers\nsupporting the motion add that all of the plaintiffโs endocrine functions and organ systems will\nbe affected by cessation of the therapy, including but not limited to the cardiovascular system,\nmetabolic function, gonadal function, pancreatic function, and adrenal function.  Further, they\nmaintain that the plaintiffโs depression will become more acute, blood pressure will rise and\nsuicide  ideation  will accelerate.   Consequently,  the  plaintiff  concludes that the  Eighth\nAmendmentโs ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Ex Post Facto Clause of article\n2\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 01/20/06   Page 2 of 5   Document 150 \n\nI, section 10 of the United States Constitution support  injunctive relief and entry of an order\nbarring the defendants from terminating the plaintiffโs hormonal therapy.\nDuring the telephonic hearing on January 18, defense counsel acknowledged\nreceipt of the plaintiffโs motion and advised that the defense needs time to prepare for a full\nhearing on a preliminary injunction.  The ensuing statements of the plaintiffโs counsel and\ndefense counsel noted that the defendants acknowledge, at least for the purpose of their\nmotion for summary judgment, that the plaintiff has GID and is receiving hormonal therapy\nfor the condition.  The defendants plan to wean the plaintiff from hormonal therapy starting\nJanuary 24, based on the Inmate Sex Change Prevention Act, Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m).\nMoreover, the defendants did not dispute that an Assistant Professor Psychotherapist/\nForensic Consultant/Human Service Consultant, whose report they rely on in support of their\nmotion for summary judgment, states โthat to discontinue that [hormonal] treatment at this\npoint, given the considerable feminine development that has occurred [with the plaintiff] and\nthe inmateโs reported satisfaction with that development, would be cruel and clinically\ninappropriate.  GID is accepted in the medical nomenclature as a psychiatric illness that\nrequires treatment.  And hormonal reassignment is one recognized treatment for GID.โ ( Ex.\n95 at 34.) \nTo prevail on a motion for a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff must establish\n(1) a likelihood of success on the merits of at least one of the plaintiffโs claims; (2) that there\nis no adequate remedy at law; and (3) that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the\ninjunction is not granted.  Promatek Industries, Ltd. v. Equitrac Corp., 300 F.3d 808, 811 (7th\nCir. 2002); see also Abbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 11 (7th Cir. 1992).  If\nthese three conditions are met, the court must balance the harm to the plaintiff if the injunction\n3\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 01/20/06   Page 3 of 5   Document 150 \n\nis not issued against the harm to the defendants if it is issued.  Storck v. Farley Candy Co.,\n14 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1994).  This balancing involves a sliding scale analysis: the greater\nthe plaintiffโs chances of success on the merits, the less strong a showing the plaintiff must\nmake that the balance of harm is in its favor.  Id. \nBased on the record in this case, including the statements of counsel at the\nJanuary 18 telephonic hearing, the court finds that the plaintiff has established a basis for a\ntemporary injunction.  Specifically, it is likely that the plaintiff can establish an Eighth\nAmendment violation inasmuch as the withdrawal of hormonal therapy will injure the plaintiffโs\nlong term health, and the adverse effects will be irreparable.  Moreover, money damages\nwould not provide an adequate remedy to the plaintiff.  Further, the balance of harms tips in\nfavor  of  the  plaintiff  because  the  Wisconsin  Department  of  Corrections  has  been\nadministering hormones to the plaintiff since 1999, ostensibly for health reasons, and at least\none of the defendantsโ witnesses agrees with the plaintiffโs claim that termination of that\ntherapy would be cruel and clinically inappropriate.  With due regard for this proof, continuing\nthe plaintiffโs hormone treatments is more important than the saving of state and federal funds\nthat must be expended for the treatments pending a further preliminary injunction hearing.\nFor the reasons stated above and those set forth in the record of the hearing of January 18,\n2006,\nIT IS ORDERED that the plaintiffโs motion for preliminary injunction is granted.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, nunc pro tunc 3:51 p.m., January 18, 2006, that\nthe defendants and anyone acting under their authority or the authority of the State of\nWisconsin, is enjoined until February 7, 2006, from withdrawing from the plaintiff any hormone\ntherapy prescribed as of January 17, 2006.\n4\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 01/20/06   Page 4 of 5   Document 150 \n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no security for costs is warranted with respect\nto the plaintiffโs motion.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a telephonic status conference is scheduled\nfor January 27, 2006, at 11:30 a.m.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a full hearing on the plaintiffโs motion for\npreliminary injunction shall commence February 7, 2006, at 1:00 p.m., In Courtroom 222 U.\nS. Courthouse, 517 East Wisconsin Ave., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \nInasmuch as the plaintiff failed to present specific facts establishing that\nimmediate and irreparable injury would be suffered by the plaintiff before the defendants were\nheard, as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b),\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiffโs motion for a Temporary Restraining\nOrder is denied.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 20th day of January, 2006.\nBY THE COURT\ns/ C.

Green Bay \nCorrectional Institution (\"GBCI\"), Columbia Correctional Institution (\"CCr\"), and the WRC. \nThe plaintiff is currently incarcerated at the WRC and has been since September 2002. \n14.  Between 1994 and 2002, the plaintiff has been transferred between WCI, \nDCI. GBCI, CCI, and the WRC. Between 1998 and 200 I, Plaintiff was housed at GBCI. \nI S.  Upon information and belief, prison medical personnel diagnosed the \nplaintiff as having Gender Identity Disorder (\"GID\") sometime prior to December 1999. \n16.  GlD is a disorder that necessitates specific medical and psychiatric \ntreatment. \n17.  The defendants refuse to provide adequate medical care necessary for the \ntreatment of an inmate suffering from GlD. \n3 \n001.1844547,1 \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 07/13/05   Page 3 of 7   Document 96 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-00717 -CNC  Document 93  Filed 07/11/2005  Page 6 of 9 \n18.  On or about December 1999 at the request of a state-employed physician \nat GBCI, the plaintiff was started on hormone therapy.  The request was approved by the former \nMedical Director of the DOC, George M. Daley. \n19.  The plaintiff had no female development prior to her incarceration. \n20.  As a result of the hormone therapy, plaintiff now has substantial female \ndevelopment. \n21.  The DOC's stated policy is to treat prisoners with GlD in accordance with \ntheir external genitalia. \n22.  Treating an individual suffering from GID in accordance with his or her \nexternal genitalia fails to meet an adequate standard of medical care. \n23.  The plaintiffs external genitalia is male. \n24.  Since her incarceration plaintiff has engaged in multiple suicide and \ncastration attempts as a result of defendants' inadequate medical treatment of her GID. \n25.  A number of the plaintiffs attempts at self-inflicted harm have resulted in \nhospitalization due to lite-threatening complications. \n26.  Throughout her incarceration, the plaintiff has repeatedly alerted officials \nof her need for proper medical treatment in accordance with the medical standards for treating \nGID. \n4 \n001.1844547.1 \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 07/13/05   Page 4 of 7   Document 96 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC  Document 93  Filed 0711112005  Page 7 of 9 \n27.  Despite this knowledge, the defendants have deliberately refused to \nprovide the plaintiff with the adequate medical care necessary for the treatment of an inmate \nsuffering from GID. \nCLAIM UNDER 42 U.S.c. ยง 1983 FOR VIOLATION OF EIGHTH AMENDMENT \nRIGHTS \n28.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs \n1-27 of her complaint. \n29.  In committing the acts and omissions complained of herein, the defendants \nare and were at all times persons who were acting under color of the laws of the State of \nWisconsin. \n30.

The plaintiff suffers from GID, a serious medical condition. \n32.  By failing to administer proper treatment, including but not limited to, by \nimplementing a policy that does not follow standard protocol for the treatment of GID, the \ndefendants have failed to treat adequately the plaintiffs GID. \n33.  By failing to provide proper treatment for the plaintiffs GID, including \nbut not limited to, by initiating hormone therapy for the plaintiff, but refusing to otherwise \nadequately treat plaintiff, the defendants' have unreasonably jeopardized the plaintiffs future \nhealth. \n5 \n001.1844547.1 \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 07/13/05   Page 5 of 7   Document 96 \n\nCase 2:03-cv-00717 -CNC  Document 93  Filed 07/11/2005  Page 8 of 9 \n34.  After being informed of plaintiffs medical condition and resulting needs \nthe defendants, by their actions and omissions complained of herein,  demonstrated deliberate \nindifference towards her that fails to meet the standards for proper medical care for the treatment \nof prisoners with GID. \n35.  By failing to properly treat the plaintiffs GID, the defendants worsened \nher serious medical condition and jeopardized her future health with deliberate indifference to \nboth of these results, thereby violating the plaintiffs rights under the Eighth Amendment. \n36.

Are  the  defendants  are  entitled  to  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  on \nrecommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 for injunctive \nrelief because there is no evidence that the defendants have or would be \ndeliberately indifferent to any serious medical need Konitzer may have \nabsent such injunctive relief? \n \n2.  Should the court decline to issue injunctive relief, as a matter law, refusing \nto implement the recommendations that Konitzer receive searches from \nfemale guards only, makeup, female undergarments, a female name, and \nthe use of hair removal/growth products where such recommendations are \ncontrary  to  WRC  and  DOCโs  legitimate  institutional  interests  and  are \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 1 of 31   Document 156 \n\nbeyond  the  scope  of  injunctive  relief  available  under  the  Prisoner \nLitigation Reform Act (โPLRAโ)?  \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  This  is  a  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  action  brought  by  Scott  (a/k/a  Donna  Dawn)  Konitzer \n(Konitzer), an inmate confined to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC).  It was \ninitiated on August 11, 2003.  Konitzer is a male inmate currently housed at the Wisconsin \nResource  Center  (WRC),  a  State  of  Wisconsin  Department  of  Health  and  Family Services \n(DHFS) facility for inmates with mental health needs.  The defendants are all employees and/or \nofficials of DOC and DHFS. In an order dated September 24, 2003, the court granted Konitzer \nleave to proceed in forma pauperis on his claim that the defendants were inadequately treating his \nGender Identity Disorder (GID) in violation of the Eighth Amendment.  The only claim that \nKonitzer makes is that the defendants have violated his Eighth Amendment rights. See Third \nAmended Complaint. \n  Konitzer seeks injunctive relief for the following: (1) enjoining the defendants, their \nemployees, agents, and successors in office from providing medical care and treatment to the \nplaintiff that is inconsistent with the standards of medical care and treatment for GID in the State \nof Wisconsin as a whole; (2) enjoining the defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in \noffice from refusing to provide and delaying provision of necessary medical treatment and care \nfor GID to the plaintiff either at suitable and adequate facilities within the WRC or elsewhere; (3) \nenjoining the defendants and their successors in office from failing to instruct, supervise and train \ntheir employees and agents in such a manner as to assure the delivery of medical treatment and \ncare to the plaintiff which is consistent with the standards of medical care in the State of \nWisconsin as a whole; and (4) that the Court establish a panel of independent medical experts to \n- 2 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 2 of 31   Document 156 \n\nregularly evaluate the delivery of medical treatment and care administered to the plaintiff and \ninsure the compliance of the defendants and their successors in office with the Courtโs Orders \n(See Third Amended Complaint, p. 6, ยถ (B)(1)-(4). \n  Presumably, the specific injunctive relief1 sought by Konitzer is set forth by his retained \nexperts in this case, Dr. Randi Ettner and Dr. Frederic Ettner.  Dr. Randi Ettner recommends that \nKonitzer  receive  the  following  while  incarcerated  in  order  to  receive  the  appropriate, \nacknowledged treatment for GID: (1) evaluation by a physician who specializes in the care of \nthese patients so that Konitzerโs hormonal protocol be accurately reconfigured; (2) follow-up \nwith this medical specialist every six months, or as necessary; (3) non-medical examinations for \nsecurity purposes executed by female personnel; (4) periodic access to a mental health caregiver \nwith expertise in treatment of this class of disorder, i.e. a member of the Harry Benjamin \nInternational Gender Dysphoria Association; (5) access to a modest amount of make-up; (6) use \nof female undergarments; (7) privacy in toilet and shower; (8) the ability to use a female name in \naddressing oneself, and to be so addressed by others; and (9) the ability to use products such as \ndepilatories and/or hair growth stimulators that are harmless and enhance oneโs ability to live in \nthe preferred gender role (DFOF ยถ 50).   \n  Dr. Frederic Ettner recommends that in order to provide for the health and welfare of \nKonitzer,  he  must  receive  the  following  protocol:  (10)  complete  physical  examination  and \nlaboratory testing including hormonal assessment; (11) HRT (hormone replacement therapy), \nspecifically non-conjugated estrogens, i.e. estradiol valerate (bio-identical) in the form of patch, \ngel, or cream; (12) anti-androgen finesteride in order to block exogenous androgens and stimulate \n                                                 \n1 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d). \n- 3 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 3 of 31   Document 156 \n\nscalp  hair  and  decrease  body  hair;  (13)  consistent  follow-up  every  3  months;  and  (14) \ncoordination with psychiatrists and psychological recommendations (DFOF ยถ 62). \n  Through their motion for partial summary judgment, the defendants submit that there is \nno dispute of material facts in this case as to recommendation No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, \n13,  and  14,  and  that  they  are  entitled  to  summary  judgment  on  Konitzerโs  requests  for \nprospective relief based upon these recommendations.2  This brief is submitted in support of that \nmotion.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedures 56(c), summary judgment \"shall be rendered \nforthwith if  . . . there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled \nto a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Summary judgment must be granted โagainst a party who fails to \nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element to that partyโs case, and on which \nthat party will bear the burden of proof at trial.โ  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 \n(1986).   \n  The opposing party \"may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials\" in the pleadings, but \n\"must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Rule 56(e).  Also, the \nopposing party \"must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the \nmaterial facts.\"  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corporation, 475 U.S. 574, 586 \n                                                 \n2  The  only  recommendation  that  the  defendants  do  not  submit  is  ripe  for  summary  judgment  is \nrecommendation No. 11, that Konitzer continue on hormone replacement therapy.  While there is no \ndispute that DOC has provided hormone therapy to Konitzer since December of 1999 (DFOF ยถ 216), the \nnewly enacted Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m) prevents DOC from continuing the administration of hormones \nto inmates.  The defendants submit that given the new law, and DOCโs obligation to follow the new law, \nrecommendation No. 11 now creates a disputed issue of material fact.  A preliminary injunction hearing \n- 4 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 4 of 31   Document 156 \n\n(1986).  \"[A] party must produce specific facts showing that there remains a genuine issue for trial \nand evidence 'significantly probative' as to any [material] fact claimed to be disputed.\" Branson v. \nPrice River Coal Company, 853 F.2d 768, 771-72 (10th Cir. 1988). In order for a party โto avoid \nsummary judgment that party must supply evidence sufficient to allow a jury to render a verdict \nin his favor.โ  Williams v. Ramos, 71 F.3d 1246, 1248 (7th Cir. 1995).   \n  Presenting only a scintilla of evidence is not sufficient to oppose a motion for summary \njudgment.  Walker v. Shansky, 28 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. 1994).  Moreover, more than mere \nconclusory allegations are required to defeat a motion for summary judgment.  Mills v. First Fed. \nSav. & Loan Assโn of Belvidere, 83 F.3d 833, 840 (7th Cir. 1996). \n  The  requirements  for  a  valid  injunction  are  found  in  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(d),  which \nprovides, so far as pertinent here, that \"[e]very order granting an injunction ... shall set forth the \nreasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by \nreference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained.\" Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(d).  Before a court may award permanent injunctive relief, a party must demonstrate \n(1) it has succeeded on the merits; (2) no adequate remedy at law exists; (3) the moving party \nwill suffer irreparable harm without injunctive relief; (4) the irreparable harm suffered without \ninjunctive  relief  outweighs  the  irreparable  harm  the  nonprevailing  party  will  suffer  if  the \ninjunction is granted; and (5) the injunction will not harm the public interest. Old Republic Ins. \nCo. v. Employers Reinsurance Corp., 144 F.3d 1077, 1081 (7th Cir. 1998), citing,  Amoco Prod. \nCo. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 12 (1987). \n                                                                                                                                                             \nis scheduled for August 24, 2006, to address recommendation No. 11, namely, the continuation of \nhormone therapy for Konitzer in the wake of Wis. Stat. ยง 302.386(5m). \n- 5 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 5 of 31   Document 156 \n\n  In this case, the scope of injunctive relief must also comply with the requirements of the \nPrison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626 (PLRA). The PLRA requires that, prior to \ngranting prospective relief, a court must find that the relief is: (1) narrowly drawn; (2) extends no \nfurther than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right; and (3) is the least intrusive \nmeans necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right. 18 U.S.C. ยง 3626(a)(1).  Not only \nmust these findings be made, but the court must also give \"substantial weight to any adverse \nimpact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused by the relief.\" Id.  \nMoreover, in order to obtain an injunction an inmate must prove that a prison official is, at the \ntime of trial, โknowingly and unreasonably disregarding an intolerable risk of harm, andโฆwill \ncontinue to do so.โ Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 846 (1994). \nARGUMENT \nI.  THE  DEFENDANTS  ARE  ENTITLED  TO  JUDGMENT  AS  A \nMATTER OF LAW ON RECOMMENDATIONS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \n9,  10,  12,  13  AND  14  FOR  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF  BECAUSE \nTHERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAVE OR \nWOULD BE DELIBERATELY INDIFFERENT TO ANY SERIOUS \nMEDICAL  NEED  KONITZER  MAY  HAVE  ABSENT  SUCH \nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF. \nA.  Introduction.  \n  Before the court could order any of the injunctive relief sought by Konitzer, he must first \nsucceed on the merits of his Eighth Amendment claim.  See Hunter v. Quinlan,  815 F. Supp. \n273,  275 (N.D.  Ill.  1993).    Even  though  Wis.  Stat.  ยง  302.386(5m)  may  ultimately  force \nKonitzerโs withdrawal from hormone therapy, the undisputed facts in this case support summary \njudgment on all the remaining recommendations.  The court cannot find that the defendants were \nor would act with deliberate indifferent to Konitzerโs GID absent these specific requests for \n- 6 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 6 of 31   Document 156 \n\ninjunctive relief.  Therefore, they are entitled to summary judgment on recommendation Nos. 1, \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14. \nB.  The Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons where \ninmates are entitled to the medical treatment of his or her \nchoice. \n  At the outset, it must be emphasized that this case is about what the Constitution requires. \n The Eighth Amendment forbids cruel and unusual punishment; it does not require the most \nintelligent, progressive, humane, or efficacious prison administration. Oliver v. Deen, 77 F.3d \n156,  161  (7th  Cir.  1996).    What  Konitzer  seeks  here  is  the  sort  of  federal  court \nโmicromanagementโ of a state prison that the Seventh Circuit deplored in Anderson v. Romero, \n72 F.3d  518 (7th Cir. 1995); see Oliver, at 161.   \n  The Constitution \"does not mandate comfortable prisons,\" Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. \n337, 349 (1981), but neither does it permit inhumane ones.  Farmer v. Brennan,  511 U.S. 825, \n832 (1994).  It is well established that prisoners have a right to receive adequate medical care. \nEstelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976).  There can be little doubt that this right encompasses a \nright to receive mental health treatment. Jones 'El v. Berge, 164 F. Supp.2d 1096 (W.D. Wis. \n2001) (citing Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir.1987); Wellman v. Faulkner, \n715 F.2d 269, 272 (7th Cir.1983)). But see Lewis v. Sullivan, 279 F.3d 526, 529 (7th Cir. 2002) \n(prisoners  \"do  not  have  a  fundamental  right  to  psychiatric care at public expense\") (dicta) \n(emphasis in original). \n  The Supreme Courtโs decision in Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991), makes it clear \nthat there is both an objective component of an prisonerโs Eighth Amendment claim (was the \ndeprivation sufficiently serious?), as well as a subjective component (did the official act with a \nsufficiently culpable state of mind?).  Id. at 298.  After incarceration, only the unnecessary and \n- 7 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 7 of 31   Document 156 \n\nwanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth \nAmendment.    It  is  obduracy and wantonness, not inadvertence or error in good faith, that \ncharacterize conduct prohibited by the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause.  Whitley v. Albers, \n475 U.S. 312, 319 (1986).  Therefore, it is necessary that an inquiry into the prison officialโs state \nof mind be made when it is claimed that the official has inflicted cruel and unusual punishment.  \nWilson, 501 U.S. at 299.  In the context of provision of medical care to prison inmates, the \nrequisite wantonness is defined as deliberate indifference to a prisonerโs serious medical needs.  \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 104;  Wilson, 501 U.S. at 302. \n  โDeliberate indifferenceโ is recklessness in the criminal law sense, that is recklessness \nimplying โan act so dangerous that the defendantโs knowledge of the risk [of harm resulting from \nthe act] can be inferred.โ  Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F.2d 645, 652 (7th Cir. 1985).  The \nSeventh Circuit in Duckworth determined that deliberate indifference to an inmateโs safety could \nnot constitute cruel and unusual punishment unless the defendant had โactual knowledge of \nimpending harm easily preventable.โ  Id. at 653.  Ordinary negligence and even gross negligence \nin the tort sense are not enough.  McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F.2d 344, 348 (7th Cir. 1991).   \n  A  prison  inmateโs  dissatisfaction  with  the  adequacy  of  medical  treatment  actually \nreceived does not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.  Courts will not attempt to second-guess \nlicensed physicians as to the propriety of a particular course of medical treatment for a given \nprisoner-patient.  Thomas v. Pate, 493 F.2d 151, 158 (7th Cir. 1974), vacated on other grounds \nsub nom Cannon v. Thomas, 419 U.S. 813 (1974) (a difference of opinion does not raise a \nmaterial issue of fact).  A difference of opinion between physician and patient concerning the \nadequacy of medical treatment actually provided does not rise to a claim under ยง 1983.  Davis v. \nSchmidt, 57 F.R.D. 37, 41 (W.D. Wis. 1972).  Where medical experts disagree, a prison official \n- 8 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 8 of 31   Document 156 \n\ndoes not act indifferently by following the advice of one of the experts.  Thomas, 493 F.2d at \n158; Jorden v. Farrier, 788 F.2d 1347 (8th Cir. 1986) (states in dicta that following the advice of \none treating medical official over another does not raise a constitutional claim); see also United \nStates v. Rovetuso, 768 F.2d 809, 825 (7th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1076 (1986) (a \nprisoner has no right to a doctor of his own choice). \n  Questions of medical judgment simply do not form the basis of Eighth Amendment \nclaims: \n[T]he question whether an X-rayโor additional diagnostic techniques or forms of \ntreatmentโis indicated is a classic example of a matter for medical judgment.  A \nmedical decision not to order an X-ray, or like measures, does not represent cruel \nand unusual punishment.  At most it is medical malpractice, and as such the \nproper forum is the state courtโฆ. \n \nEstelle, 429 U.S. at 107-108.  As the Seventh Circuit reformulated the applicable standard, a \nprisoner alleging that prison officials inflict cruel and unusual punishment must demonstrate that \nthose officials actually wish to harm him, or at least, are totally unconcerned with his welfare.  \nDuane v. Lane, 959 F.2d 673, 677 (7th Cir. 1992). \n  The Supreme Court in Farmer, defined the standard in the following terms: \nWe hold instead that a prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth \nAmendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the \nofficial knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the \nofficial must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that \na substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference. \n \nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837 (emphasis added.) \n \n  Farmer requires that medical professionals exercise medical judgment.  If a decision is \nmade by a health care professional, it is presumably valid.  Estate of Cole by Pardue v. Fromm, \n94 F.3d 254, 261 (7th Cir. 1996).  The constitution does not require prison officials to administer \n- 9 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 9 of 31   Document 156 \n\nthe least painful treatment.  Snipes v. DeTella, 95 F.3d 586, 592 (7th Cir. 1996).  The constitution \nis not a medical code that mandates specific treatment.  Id. \nC.  Defendants have treated Konitzerโs serious medical need and \nany disagreement over the course of treatment he receives does \nnot constitute deliberate indifference to that serious medical \nneed. \n1.  Summary of argument. \n  For purposes of this summary judgment only, the defendants do not dispute that Konitzer \nhas a serious medical need given his overall mental health diagnosis and diagnosis of GID.  The \ndefendants, however, strongly dispute that they have been deliberately indifferent to Konitzerโs \nGID and his mental health care, or that the court must order recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, \n8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 to prevent/cure any Eighth Amendment violation.  Konitzerโs treatment in \nthese  regards  has  been  constitutionally  thorough  and  completeโa  far  cry  from  being  a \ndemonstration of deliberate indifference (DFOF ยถยถ 210-589).  At its core, this action is nothing \nmore than an attempt by Konitzer to garner his preferred form of โtreatmentโ for GID while at \nthe same time ignoring his more severe and overlaying personality pathologies.  Simply put, the \ndefendants disagree with Konitzerโs preferred form of treatment for GID and have instead treated \nall of his serious medical needs.  Given that recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 \nand 14 amount to nothing more than a disagreement over what form of treatment should be \nimplemented, Konitzer fails to state an Eighth Amendment claim.  The defendants are entitled to \nsummary judgment. \n- 10 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 10 of 31   Document 156 \n\n2.  There is no universal consensus as to what โtheโ treatment \nfor GID is or what constitutes a medical necessity in the \ntreatment of GID. \n  There is no dispute that Konitzer has been diagnosed with GID (DFOF ยถ 28).3  However, \nthere  is  no  universal  consensus  in  the  psychiatric  community  about  what  constitutes  โtheโ \ntreatment for GID or what constitutes medical necessity in the treatment of GID (DFOF ยถ 32). In \nfact, a patient diagnosed with GID chooses how they want to live the remainder of their life after \nthey have acknowledged that they have GID (DFOF ยถ 33). Each transgendered individual decides \nwhich options to pursue and how far and how fast to go with regard to those life-changing \noptions (DFOF ยถ 40).  Age, physical characteristics, income, employment, personality, pain \ntolerance, and desired lifestyle all factor into the equation when a transgendered individual  \nmakes his or her decision as to how to live (id.).   \n  The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Associationโs Standards of Care for \nGender Indentity Disorder (โHarry Benjamin standardsโ) provide guidelines that have been \nhelpful in professionalizing the treatment of GID (DFOF ยถ 30).   The Harry Benjamin standards \nโare intended to provide flexible directions for the treatment of persons with gender identity \ndisordersโ (DFOF ยถ 37).  The standards provide: โ[m]any adults with gender identity disorder \nfind comfortable, effective ways of living that do not involve all the components of the triadic \ntreatment sequenceโ (DFOF ยถ 38), which is the sequence of hormone therapy, real life experience \nin  the  preferred  gender,  and  reassignment  surgery  discussed  in  the  standards.    Hence,  for \nindividuals with GID, the Harry Benjamin standards emphasize the personโs choices and options \nrather than diagnosis that requires necessary โtreatmentโ (DFOF ยถ 35). \n- 11 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 11 of 31   Document 156 \n\n  However, the Harry Benjamin standards require being crime free (DFOF ยถ 41).  This is \nwithout exception accepted as the community standard in gender clinics throughout the world \n(id.).  Prison life presents an inherent and irresolvable contradiction to this standard (id.), and is a \ncontext that renders existing standard treatment guidelines for GID unrealistic and impossible \n(DFOF ยถ 42).  New treatment guidelines for GID within prisons, with awareness of and in \nconsideration of the complexities created by that situation, have not been developed (id.). \n3.  Konitzerโs  medical  record  overwhelmingly  demonstrates \nthat he has been receiving care and treatment. \n  Konitzer is, and has been, receiving exhaustive treatment by the defendants for his mental \nhealth needs, including his GID (see DFOF ยถยถ 210-589).  This treatment includes countless \npsychiatric evaluations, physical examinations, hormone therapy4 (most recently in the non-\nconjugated  form),  laboratory  testing,  assessment  and  reassessment  of  his  prescription \nmedications,  referral  to  the  University  of  Wisconsin  Hospitals  and  Clinic  to  see  an \nendocrinologist, and consistent follow-up with his treatment providers (id.)  The psychiatric and \nmedical care provided to Konitzer has been exhaustive and complete.  To now argue otherwise is \nto simply ignore the voluminous medical record.  This is not a case where treatment has been \nabruptly halted and no treatment provided. See e.g. Wolfe v. Horn, 130 F.Supp.2d 648 (E.D.Pa. \n2001).  It is precisely the opposite.  The court should grant defendantsโ motion for summary \njudgment. \n                                                                                                                                                             \n3 GID is defined as a persistent desire to live as a member of the opposite sex (DFOF ยถ 29).  The \ncondition is manifested by an intense desire to adopt the social role, and to acquire the physical \nappearance, of the opposite sex (id.).  GID is largely a self-diagnosed condition (DFOF ยถ 33). \n4 See, note 2, supra.   \n- 12 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 12 of 31   Document 156 \n\n4.  Disagreements over Konitzerโs course of treatment do not \nconstitute an Eighth Amendment violation. \n  Simply put, Konitzerโs requests reflect a desire to be more comfortable in prison and \nreceive his preferred form of treatment for GID.  Once again, this amounts to nothing more than \na disagreement about Konitzerโs treatment, not whether the defendants have been deliberately \nindifferent to him.  Although the government has a duty to provide medical care for those it \npunishes by incarceration, Snipes, 95 F.3d at 590, it is equally true that a prisoner is not entitled \nto whatever treatment he desires.  Means v. Cullen, 297 F. Supp.2d 1148, 1154 (W.D. Wis. \n2003).    โ[D]ifferences  in  opinion  between  the  patient  and  the  doctor  [regarding  medical \ntreatment] never give rise to a constitutional claim.โ  Higgins v. Correctional Medical Services of \nIllinois, Inc., 8 F. Supp.2d 821, 830 (N.D. Ill. 1998).  Hence, no Eighth Amendment claim lies to \nsupport a court order implementing recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, or \n14.  Just because Konitzer believes he has a right to a particular type of treatment for GID, that \nparticular type of treatment does not set the parameters of the Eighth Amendment.  In fact, just \nthe opposite is true.  \n  For  instance,  case  law  from  analogous  Eighth  Amendment  cases  is  in  accord  with \ndefendantsโ position here.  Transsexual inmates have no constitutional right to any particular type \nof treatment.  Meriwether v. Faulkner, 821 F.2d 408, 413 (7th Cir. 1987); Supre v. Ricketts, 792 \nF.2d 958 (10th Cir. 1986); Lamb v. Maschner, 633 F. Supp. 351 (D. Kansas 1986); White v. \nFarrier,  849  F.2d  322,  327  (recognizing  other  courtsโ  holdings  that  inmates  are  not \nconstitutionally entitled to hormone therapy); Tiller v. Owens, 719 F. Supp. 1256, 1308 (W.D. \nPenn. 1989); Long v. Nix, 877 F. Supp. 1358 (S.D. Iowa 1995).  Moreover, the controlling case \nin the Seventh Circuit is even more deferential to the defendants.   \n- 13 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 13 of 31   Document 156 \n\n  In Maggert v. Hanks, 131 F.3d 670 (7th Cir. 1997), a prisoner sought estrogen therapy \nunder the Eighth Amendment for his gender dysphoria.  The court affirmed dismissal of the case, \nholding that: \nexcept in special circumstances that we do not at present foresee, the Eighth \nAmendment does not entitle a prison inmate to curative treatment for his gender \ndysphoria. \n \nId. at 672.  In so holding, the court reasoned that: \nA prison is not required by the Eighth Amendment to give a prisoner medical care \nthat is as good as he would receive if he were a free person, let alone an affluent \nfree person. (Citation omitted).  He is entitled only to minimum care. \n \nId. at 671.  The court went on to state: \nGender dysphoria is not, at least not yet, generally considered a severe enough \ncondition to warrant expensive treatment at the expense of others than the person \nsuffering from it.  That being so, making the treatment a constitutional duty of \nprisons would give prisoners a degree of medical care that they could not obtain if \nthey obeyed the law. \n \n Id. at 672.   \n  Here, Konitzer and his experts disagree with the defendants and their experts about the \nproper course of mental health treatment (see DFOF ยถยถ 44-71, 130-131, 150, 176, 186-188, 209). \n While  Konitzerโs  expert,  Dr.  Randi  Ettner,  advocates  allowing  Konitzer  to  feminize  his \nappearance, be treated as a female, and to see GID medical and mental health specialists, the \ndefendants have instead (and quite properly) focused Konitzerโs treatment on adjustment rather \nthan cross gender transition (DFOF ยถยถ 50, 61).  Instead of concentrating solely on Konitzerโs \nGID, the defendants have also been treating Konitzerโs other mental health needs.  These mental \nhealth needs include the following DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II diagnoses: Cocaine Dependence \nin Remission in a Controlled Environment, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression, \nand Personality Disorder with Cluster B traits (DFOF ยถ 43).   \n- 14 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 14 of 31   Document 156 \n\n  Defense expert Professor Cynthia Osborne believes this is a clinically sound and ethically \nwise stance (DFOF ยถ 61).  For Konitzer, treatment must be carefully designed to address not just \nthe GID, but GID in the context of severe and overlaying personality pathologies (DFOF ยถ 49).  \nIn the opinion of Professor Cynthia Osborne, to not do so will likely result in disappointing \noutcomes for both Konitzer and the defendants (id.).  Juxtaposed with Osborneโs opinion is that \nof Konitzerโs own expert, Dr. Randi Ettner.  However, Dr. Randi Ettner does not even know the \nstatus  of  Konitzerโs  medical  treatment,  does  not  have  experience  treating  incarcerated \nindividuals, and has never made a finding as to what was causing Konitzer to experience extreme \nstress  and  psychological  distress  (DFOF  ยถยถ  51,  53,  55).    Any  recommendations  regarding \nKonitzerโs course of treatment ring particularly hollow when his own expert knows so little about \nhim and his treatment. \n  Defense expert, Dr. Daniel Claiborn, is in accord with Professor Osborne.  Dr. Claiborn \nasserts that Konitzer manifests severe and chronic personality disorders, characterized by self-\ncenteredness, drama, volatile emotions, and erratic behaviors.  The very nature of these combined \npersonality  disorders  (Antisocial,  Borderline,  Histrionic,  and  Narcissistic)  militates  against \nhonest self-exploration, trust, commitment, and taking responsibility for change (DFOF ยถ 46).  \nAccording to Dr. Claiborn, Konitzerโs Antisocial Personality Disorder is his most severe disorder \n(DFOF ยถ 47).  Since Konitzer has other more severe disorders in addition to GID, it logically \nfollows that defendantsโ course of treatment is appropriate and not an example of deliberate \nindifference. \n  As for any of Konitzerโs potential medical needs, Konitzerโs expert, Dr. Frederic Ettner, \nrecommends specific types of medical treatment for Konitzer (DFOF ยถยถ 62).  However, he \nwavers on whether such recommendations are even medically necessary (DFOF ยถยถ 62-71). This \n- 15 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 15 of 31   Document 156 \n\nis not surprising since there are no โofficialโ guidelines for the best medical treatment of male-to-\nfemale transsexuals (DFOF ยถ 63).  This of course begs the following questions: How can the \ndefendants be acting deliberately indifferent toward Konitzerโs GID when there are no official \nguidelines  for  treating  male-to-female  transsexuals?    How  can  the  defendants  be  acting \ndeliberately indifferent toward Konitzerโs GID when his very own expert concedes that his \nrecommendations are not even medically necessary?  The answer to both questions is that they \ncannot.   \n  Konitzerโs complaint that defendants are being deliberately indifferent to his GID by not \nimplementing recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 simply does not hold \nany  water.  It  ignores  the  voluminous  medical  record  detailing  the  thorough  and  complete \npsychiatric and medical treatment that Konitzer has received.  This is not a case in which the \ndefendants  have  done  nothing  for  Konitzer  or  ignored  Konitzer.    On  the  contrary.    The \ndefendants have provided treatment for Konitzerโs long list of disorders and continue to do so.  \nWith little doubt, the type of care and attention that Konitzer has received has gone far beyond \nthe type of care and attention he would have received if he had not been in state custody over the \npast decade.  In addition, a disagreement between experts over what treatment Konitzer should \nreceive does not state an Eighth Amendment violation.  In turn, Konitzerโs request for injunctive \nrelief on recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 fails.  Konitzerโs request for \ninjunctive relief goes way beyond what the Eighth Amendment requires, is overly broad, and \noverly intrusive.  Defendantsโ motion for summary judgment must be granted. \n- 16 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 16 of 31   Document 156 \n\nII.  THE  COURT  SHOULD  DECLINE  TO  ISSUE  INJUNCTIVE \nRELIEF AND NOT ADOPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT \nONLY  FEMALE  OFFICERS  CONDUCT STRIP SEARCHES OF \nKONITZER, PROVIDE HIM MAKEUP, PROVIDE HIM FEMALE \nUNDERGARMENTS,  A  FEMALE  NAME,  AND  THE  USE  OF \nHAIR  REMOVAL/GROWTH  PRODUCTS  BECAUSE  SUCH \nRECOMMENDATIONS ARE CONTRARY TO WRC AND DOCโS \nLEGITIMATE  INSTITUTIONAL  INTERESTS  AND  BEYOND \nTHE SCOPE OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALLOWED UNDER THE \nPLRA. \nA.  Introduction.  \n  In his Complaint, Konitzer alleges that the defendants have implemented policies that \nconflict with his needs as a biological male inmate with GID (Third Amended Complaint).  \nPresumably,  these  would  include  conditions  of  Konitzerโs  confinement  that are contrary to \nrecommendations made by Konitzerโs experts.  These conditions include: (a) the requirement that \nKonitzer be searched by same-sex guards (male) (contrary to recommendation No. 3); (b) the \nprohibition  of  possession  and  use  of  makeup  (contrary  to  recommendation  No.  5);  (c)  the \nprohibition of possession and use of female undergarments (contrary to recommendation No. 6); \n(d) the prohibition of use of a female name since such name would be considered a false names \nor title (contrary to recommendation No. 8); and (e) the denial of hair removal and/or hair growth \nproducts (contrary to recommendation Nos. 9 and 12).  The policies supporting these types of \nconditions, however, are reasonably related to legitimate institutional interests in safety, security, \nmanagement,  and  administration.    Therefore,  they  do  not  violate  the  Eighth  Amendment, \nregardless of Konitzerโs desired treatment. \n- 17 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 17 of 31   Document 156 \n\nB.  When  determining  whether  an  inmateโs  conditions  of \nconfinement  violate  the  Constitution,  security  concerns  of \ncorrectional officials must be given great deference. \n1.  Deference  to  prison  officialsโ  decisions  regarding \nsecurity is essential. \n  Courts are obligated to defer to prison officials' adoption of policies necessary to preserve \nsecurity and internal order.  Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 474 (1983).  In the prison environment, \n\"safety of the institution's guards and inmates is perhaps the most fundamental responsibility of the \nprison administration.\"  Id. at 473. \n  \"[P]rison officials are to remain the primary arbiters of the problems that arise in prison \nmanagement.\"  Shaw v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223, 230 (2001). \nJudges should be cautious about disparaging disciplinary and security concerns \nexpressed by the correctional authorities.  American jails are not safe places, and \njudges should not go out of their way to make them less safe. \n \nKeeney v. Heath, 57 F.3d 579, 581 (7th Cir. 1995).   \n  The nature of operating a penal institution, including the management of inmates \nand  prevention  of  escapes,  requires  \"moment-to-moment  decisions  and  crisis \nmanagement\" which requires that correctional officers have discretion on how they \nwill deal with any situation that arises. \n \nOttinger v. Pinel, 215 Wis. 2d 266, 279, 572 N.W.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting from Barillari \nv. City of Milwaukee, 194 Wis. 2d 247, 260, 533 N.W.2d 759 (1995)). \n  In determining whether prison policies are reasonably related to the government's interests \nin maintaining security and order and operating the institution in a manageable fashion, courts heed \nthe Supreme Court's admonition that \"[s]uch considerations are peculiarly within the province and \nprofessional expertise of corrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the \nrecord to indicate that the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts \nshould ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.\"  Childs v. Duckworth, 705 F.2d \n- 18 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 18 of 31   Document 156 \n\n915, 920 (7th Cir. 1983); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 827 (1974); Bell, 441 U.S. at 540 n. 23.  \nAs stated in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987): \nA second principle identified in [Procunier v.] Martinez, [416 U.S. 396 (1974)] ... \nis the recognition that \"courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent \nproblems  of  prison  administration  and  reform.\"    As  the  Martinez  Court \nacknowledged, \"the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, \nand, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.\"  \nRunning a prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires expertise, \nplanning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the \nprovince  of  the  legislative  and  executive  branches  of  government.    Prison \nadministration is, moreover, a task that has been committed to the responsibility \nof those branches, and separation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial \nrestraint.  \n \n(Citations omitted.) \n  An illustration of judicial restraint comes from Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).  \nThere, the Court overturned the rule in Hewitt that mandatory prison regulations created protectible \nliberty interests in prisoners.  In doing so it said: \nSecond, the Hewitt approach has led to the involvement of federal courts in the \nday-to-day management of prisons, often squandering judicial resources with little \noff-setting benefit to anyone.  In so doing, it has run counter to the view expressed \nin several of our cases that federal courts ought to afford appropriate deference \nand flexibility to state officials trying to manage a volatile environment. \n \n515 U.S. at 482. \n  The Seventh Circuit has identified as \"the animating theme\" of the Supreme Court's prison \njurisprudence for the last 20 years as being \"the requirement that judges respect the hard choices \nmade by prison administrators.\"  Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 145 (7th Cir. 1995) (emphasis in \nthe original).  As indicated, Sandin expresses disapproval of excessive judicial involvement in \nday-to-day  prison  management,  which  often  squanders judicial resources with little offsetting \nbenefit to anyone.  515 U.S. at 482.  Remember, these are convicted felons who have lost some of \ntheir  rights.    Imprisonment \"necessarily makes unavailable many rights and privileges of the \n- 19 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 19 of 31   Document 156 \n\nordinary citizen, 'a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal systems.\"'  Wolf v. \nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 555 (1974).   \n2.  When determining the constitutionality of a prisonerโs \nconditions of confinement courts must always give great \ndeference to security concerns and corrections officialsโ \nobligation  to  take  reasonable  measures  to  protect \nprisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners. \n  Like most other claims under the Eighth Amendment, a claim asserting cruel and unusual \nconditions  of  confinement  must  satisfy  a  two-part  test,  with  a  subjective  and  an  objective \ncomponent.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835.  Generally, the standard for determining whether prison \nconditions satisfy the objective component of the Eighth Amendment focuses on whether the \nconditions  are  contrary  to  โthe  evolving  standards  of  decency  that  mark  the  progress  of  a \nmaturing society.โ  Id. at 833-834 (internal quotations omitted).  To meet this standard, the \ndeprivation must be โextreme;โ mere discomfort is not sufficient.  Hudson v. McMillan, 503 U.S. \n1,  8-9  (1993).    โOnly  those  deprivations  denying  the  minimal  civilized  measures  of  lifeโs \nnecessities โฆ are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation.โ  Craig \nv. Eberly, 164 F.3d 490, 495 (10th Cir. 1998) quoting, Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 \n(1991). \n  The duty imposed by the Eighth Amendment on prison officials to โprovide humane \nconditions of confinement,โ Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832, requires prison officials to take reasonable \nmeasures to โโprotect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.โ  Farmer, 511 U.S. \nat 833 (quoting Cortes-Quinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F.2d 556, 558 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, \n488 U.S.823 (1988)).  Violent assaults, of course, are not โpart of the penalty that criminal \noffenders pay for their offenses.โ  Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S.337, 347 (1981). \n- 20 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 20 of 31   Document 156 \n\n  A prison official may enact a security measure, even one that impinges on medical needs, \nif the measure \"was applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline.\" Whitley v. \nAlbers, 475 U.S. 312, 320-21 (1986). In such situations, an official is liable only for acting \n\"maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm.\" Id.  Constraints facing a \nprison official are relevant to whether his conduct can be characterized as \"wanton.\" Wilson, 501 \nU.S. at 303.  Thus, the \"realities of prison administration\" are relevant to the issue of deliberate \nindifference. Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 37 (1993).  \n  Hence, prison officials, acting reasonably and in good faith, do not violate the Eighth \nAmendment because the resulting infliction of pain on the inmate would not be unnecessary or \nwanton. Rather, such a decision would be reasonable.  Prison officials who act reasonably cannot \nbe found liable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  Farmer, 511 U.S. at 845. \n  In addition, prison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to \ninmate  health  or  safety  may  be  found  free  from  liability  if  they  responded \nreasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.  A prison \nofficialโs duty under the Eighth Amendment is to ensure โreasonable safety,โโฆa \nstandard that incorporates due regard for prison officialsโ โunenviable task of \nkeeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions.โ \n \nId.  (citations omitted); see also White v. Farrier, 849 F.2d 322, 325 (8th Cir.1988) (\"Denial of \nmedical care that results in unnecessary suffering in prison is inconsistent with contemporary \nstandards of decency and gives rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Actions without \npenological justification may constitute an unnecessary infliction of pain.\") (emphasis added). \nC.  Preventing  Konitzer  from  possessing  makeup,  female \nundergarments, and hair growth/removal products in a male \nprison is reasonably related to WRC and DOCโs legitimate \ninterests in safety and security. \n  Preventing  Konitzer  from  possessing  makeup,  female  undergarments,  and  hair \ngrowth/removal products in a male prison is reasonably related to WRC and DOCโs legitimate \n- 21 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 21 of 31   Document 156 \n\ninterests in safety, security, and fair administration.  The reasons supporting DOCโs position are \nmany. See also Star v. Gramley, 815 F.Supp. 276, 278 (C.D.Ill. 1993) (denial womenโs makeup \nand apparel at male prison upheld); Wolfe v. Horn, 130 F.Supp.2d 648, 654 (E.D.Pa. 2001) \n(denial of female clothing and makeup is not a constitutional violation); Lamb v. Maschner, 633 \nF. Supp. 351 (D. Kansas 1986) (denial of female clothing and cosmetics to GID inmate not a \nconstitutional violation); Long v. Nix, 86 F.3d 761 (8th Cir. 1996) (denial of womenโs clothing \nand makeup upheld); Murray v. United States Bureau of Prisons, 106 F.3d 401, 1997 WL 34677 \n(deprivation  of  hair  and  skin  products  for  GID  inmate  do not state a constitutional claim. \nCosmetics are not among the civilized measure of lifeโs necessities as to be required under \nconstitution). \n  Allowing Konitzer these items would create a serious security risk.  When an inmate \nenhances his differences in appearance or identity, such as appearing more feminine in a male \nprison population, it significantly increases the likelihood that the inmate will be the target of \naggression or the center of conflict among the prison population.  The inmateโs use of female \nundergarments, the use of hair removal products, and makeup gives a loud message to all \nobservers.  It says to all inmates that the person is of the female gender and is available for sexual \nconduct.  It is seen by all inmates as an open invitation to compete for that personโs attention and \ninvites assaults (DFOF ยถ 81). The consequences of providing Konitzer with property items \ntypically associated with females, such as makeup and female undergarments, while he is housed \nin  a  male  correctional  environment,  could  compromise  his  safety  and  security,  especially \nconsidering his lengthy sentence structure (DFOF ยถ 84).  It is not unusual to find that over 50% \nof the incidents of violence in prison are related to sexual partnering among inmates where \nconflict has developed in the form of jealous partners, failed relationships, or competition from \n- 22 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 22 of 31   Document 156 \n\nother inmates. (DFOF ยถ 90).  The level of risk of incidents of violence in prison is further \nelevated when any of the participants have a history of violent, assaultive behavior, such as \nKonitzer (DFOF ยถ 91). \n  Allowing Konitzer to have these items would also interfere with fair administration of the \ninstitution.  Anytime an inmate is the recipient of an exception to rules and practices, then all \nother inmates immediately consider themselves candidates for the same exceptions.  The logical \nextension of flexing the rules for all inmates, in operational terms, can be a condition that is \nunsafe and unmanageable in the correctional environment (DFOF ยถ 82). Prison riots often times \noccur because staff may not be uniformly enforcing rules.  This creates tension within the inmate \npopulation and confusion among staff (DFOF ยถ 83). Any time an inmate is allowed to make \nhimself a target of attention by enhancing his femininity in the form of clothing and makeup, it \nautomatically  increases  the  work  demand  of  existing  staff  resources  (DFOF  ยถ  95).  The \nfeminization of an inmate increases the work demand of existing staff resources by: creating \nadditional property management challenges such as making sure that an inmate is not doing a \nbrisk business in the sales or bartering of cosmetics or undergarments; resolving disputes over \nwho is eligible to possess such items and who is not eligible; determining whether hair removal \nproducts or hair growth stimulators are an appropriate product for the general inmate population; \nfinding an opportunity for peaceful integration of an inmate to a new living condition as he is \nbeing  moved  from  another  location;  or  continuously  observing  an  inmate  based  upon  a \nperception of increased risk (DFOF ยถ 96). Staff resources that would be required due to the \nincreases of work demand created by the feminization of an inmate are exceptional, and staff will \nbe drawn from attending to other operational duties in the institution that are also likely to \ninvolve safety and control (DFOF ยถ 97). The logical extension of flexing the rules for all inmates, \n- 23 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 23 of 31   Document 156 \n\nin operational terms, can be a condition that is unsafe and unmanageable in the correctional \nenvironment (DFOF ยถ 101). See also DFOF ยถยถ 81-109; 170; 181. \n  Allowing makeup also creates a security risk because Konitzer could use it to disguise his \nappearance and escape from the institution (DFOF ยถ 177). For example, an inmate at Waupun \nCorrectional Institution almost successfully escaped from that institution after a visitor of the \ninmate came in and provided makeup to the inmate.  This inmate almost made it past the guard \nstation wearing the makeup that made him look like a female visitor (DFOF ยถ 178).  When \ncorrectional staff is trained to look for males leaving the institution, it is much more difficult \nwhen they have to be concerned about males made up to look like females. (DFOF ยถ 179).  Given \nKonitzerโs sentence structure and escape history, he is classified as a high risk for an escape \nattempt (DFOF 180) and it would make absolutely no sense to allow him to possess makeup. It \ncould not only be used to disguise his identity, but it could also be used to feign an injury, such as \na black eye, in order to lure a staff member or other inmate in their room   (DFOF ยถ 185). \n  Allowing makeup could also put Konitzer in a position of being in control of something \nthat other inmates may want (DFOF ยถ 182).  Contraband moves, and Konitzer could be offered \nmoney for things that other inmates want.  This would put him in a power position over other \ninmates (DFOF ยถ 183).  Allowing Konitzer to possess makeup could create a black market for \npeople wanting it.  (DFOF ยถ 184). 5 \n                                                 \n5 Dr. Randi Ettner does not believe that makeup, per se, treats GID.  (DFOF ยถ 186).  In Dr. Claibornโs \nopinion, the use of makeup is a choice on the part of Konitzerโs and a privilege with possible safety \nramifications.  There is no reasonable basis for considering this a necessary โtreatmentโ for GID. (DFOF \n188).  The same is true regarding female undergarments (DFOF ยถยถ 160-61) and hair products (DFOF ยถยถ \n198-209). \n \n- 24 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 24 of 31   Document 156 \n\nD.  Refusing to accommodate Konitzerโs request to be searched by \nfemale guards only is reasonably related to WRC and DOCโs \nlegitimate  penological  interests  in  prison  management, \nadministration, and security. \n  Refusing to accommodate Konitzerโs request to be searched by female guards only is \nreasonably related to WRC and DOCโs legitimate penological interests in prison management, \nadministration, and security.  DOC rules require that a person of the same sex as the inmate being \nsearched conduct the strip search, although any staff member may conduct pat searches (DFOF ยถ \n121).  Although WRC does not and will not tolerate deliberate mistreatment related to strip \nsearches conducted on Konitzer, such as unnecessary onlookers, WRC will not adopt practices \nthat are different from DOC related to strip searches (DFOF ยถ 122).  It is essential that WRC staff \ntreat DOC inmates under its control in a consistent manner.  If staff were to treat inmates \ndifferently or grant special favors, it would become a serious management issue and would \ncompromise the ability of staff to maintain order in the facility (DFOF ยถ 123). \n  In addition, it would become a difficult management issue if WRC were required to have \nonly female officers strip search and pat search Konitzer.  This is because officers are assigned to \na certain post and have certain job responsibilities (DFOF ยถ 124).  Each correctional institution is \noperated with a specific number of established โPosts.โ  These are locations where specific tasks \nare performed critical to the safe and controlled operation of the facility (DFOF ยถ 125).  It is \nessential that the posts in correctional institutions remain in operation.  Staff is seldom pulled \nfrom  posts  except  in  the  most  extreme  circumstances  (DFOF  ยถ  126).    Institution  shift \ncommanders must have the discretion to make assignments as he or she sees fit (DFOF ยถ 127). \n  It is not possible for DOC to ensure that Konitzer be pat searched or strip searched only \nby female staff.  Staffing patterns and staff resources may not allow for this to occur.  The \n- 25 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 25 of 31   Document 156 \n\navailability  of  female  correctional  officers  is  controlled  by  the  number  of  female  officers \nemployed at an institution, and staff who may be on leave.   Labor contracts also affect the \nnumber of male and female correctional staff at institutions.  There may be occasions when a \nfemale on any given shift is not available due to these factors (DFOF ยถ 137). To create work \npositions merely for the purpose of ensuring that a female is available at all times to pat search or \nstrip search Konitzer is impractical and cost prohibitive (DFOF ยถ 138). \n  Another management issue that would arise if WRC were required to have only female \nofficers strip search and pat search Konitzer would be the effect that it would have on the rest of \nthe inmate population.  WRC houses many people who would much rather be searched by \nfemales than by males for reasons not related to GID (DFOF ยถ 128).  This creates a managerial \nproblem and security risk because once you treat one inmate with special favors, other inmates \nwill feel entitled.  This creates disorder in the prison and therefore, a security risk (DFOF ยถ 129). \n  Finally, Konitzerโs situation is not unique or new to DOC.  There have been other \ninmates  with  breast  development  or  gender  issues  that  have  been  managed  in  adult  male \ninstitutions.  These inmates have been safely managed without special accommodations for \nsearches.    Male  officers  perform  the  strip  searches  of  these  other  inmates  with  breast \ndevelopment or gender issues (DFOF ยถ 136).6 \n                                                 \n6 Dr. Randi Ettner cannot predict that being searched by a male guard would cause Konitzer to inflict \nharm, only that it would be extremely agitating for Konitzer (DFOF ยถ130).  In Dr. Claibornโs opinion, \nrequiring that Konitzer be searched only by female security officers does not constitute a necessity and \ncannot be construed at โtreatmentโ for Konitzer.  Dr. Claiborn believes that examination by male \npersonnel will not harm Konitzer (DFOF ยถ 131). \n- 26 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 26 of 31   Document 156 \n\nE.  Refusing to accommodate Konitzerโs request to be referred to \nby a female name is reasonably related to WRC and DOCโs \nlegitimate interests in prison management and administration. \n1.  Allowing  Konitzer  the  use  of  a  female  name  would \ncreate a security risk, cause administrative problems, \nand give him special privileges in comparison to other \nprisoners. \n  Allowing  Konitzer  the  use  of  a  female  name  would  create  a  security  risk,  cause \nadministrative  problems,  and  give  him  special  privileges  in  comparison  to  other  prisoners. \nKonitzer  wants  WRC  staff  to  address  him  by  using  a  female  name  and  female  pronouns.  \nHowever, Konitzer is in a male institution and he was incarcerated under the name of Scott \nKonitzer  (DFOF  ยถ  145).    WRC  already  accommodates  Konitzer.    Staff  refers  to    him  as \nโKonitzer,โ avoiding the use of his legal first name, Scott (DFOF ยถ 149).   \n  Calling inmates by names other than their legal names creates order and maintenance \nissues at a prison.  It presents identity problems, escape issues, and power and control issues with \ninmates.  Staff needs to know who an inmate is at all times wherever they are, and they need to \nbe accountable for the inmateโs first and last name and inmate number.  That is how WRC \nidentifies people, how staff maintains order, and how staff ensures that inmates do not have \npower over other inmates (DFOF ยถ 147).  \n  Administrative  code  provisions and policies are also designed to protect the public.  \nAllowing inmates to identify themselves as something other than their legal name would enable \nthem  to  misrepresent  themselves  to  the  public  and  could  lead  to  predatory  behavior  and \nvictimization  (DFOF  ยถ  153).    Wisconsin  Administrative  Code  ยง  DOC  303.31  makes  it  a \ndisciplinary offense for any inmate to use a name other than the name by which the inmate was \ncommitted to the department unless the name was legally changed.  This is uniformly enforced \n- 27 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 27 of 31   Document 156 \n\nfor legitimate penological purposes (DFOF ยถ 151).  Allowing inmates to use nicknames or other \ntitles would allow inmates to have a power relationship relative to other inmates.  In the past, \ninmates have used these terms to exert their will, control, influence and power over other inmates \n(DFOF ยถ 152). \n  In addition, the database system used by DOCโs Division of Adult Institutions (CIPIS) \ndoes not allow for more than one name to be used for the DOC number assigned to the offender.  \nThis system carries essential information concerning each inmate offender, including background \ninformation, convictions, institutional transfer histories, and program review actions (DFOF ยถ \n155).  DOC staff needs to be able to quickly and uniformly identify any given inmate at any \ngiven time in order access essential information about the inmate.  If an inmate does not use their \nlegal name, staff may be delayed in finding, utilizing, and recording necessary information, \nincluding inmate health records, security information, disciplinary records, and other records that \nare necessary in order for DOC to perform its necessary duties and obligations in a timely fashion \n(DFOF ยถ 156). \n  Allowing an inmate to use a name other than his legal name could also cause tracking \nproblems for victim notifications.  Victims may be confused if a notification letter came that did \nnot have the offenderโs legal name listed.  In addition, if a victim is not already in the system but \nlater wishes to enroll for notification and only provides the inmatesโ old name, DOC may have \ndifficulty finding the offender in the system (DFOF ยถ 157). \n- 28 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 28 of 31   Document 156 \n\n2.  The court is prevented from issuing an order requiring \nthe  defendants  and  everyone  else  from  referring  to \nKonitzer by a female name under the Rooker-Feldman \ndoctrine. \n  Among the recommendations made by Konitzerโs expert Dr. Randi Ettner is that the court \norder the defendants and everyone else to refer to Konitzer by a female name.  Presumably this \nname is โDonna Dawn Konitzer.โ  However, such a request is inextricably intertwined with the \nstate court petition for a name change that took place and which was ultimately denied (DFOF ยถยถ \n141-44). Therefore, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine is controlling, and this court lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction to collaterally review the appropriateness of that state court determination. \n  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine is based on 28 U.S.C. ยง 1257, which grants the Supreme \nCourt jurisdiction to review the decisions of the highest state courts for compliance with the \nConstitution.  See 28 U.S.C. ยง 1257; District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. \n462, 467 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 416 (1923).  In Rooker, the \nSupreme Court held that no matter how wrong a state court decision may have been, a federal \ndistrict court had no jurisdiction to reverse or modify it.  Rooker, 263 U.S. at 415-416; Garry v. \nGeils, 82 F.3d 1362, 1366 (7th Cir. 1996).  The Feldman Court similarly held that federal district \ncourts \"do not have jurisdiction . . . over challenges to state-court decisions in particular cases \narising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court's action was \nunconstitutional.\"  Feldman, 460 U.S. at 486.  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine has since emerged \nto  stand  for  the  proposition  that  lower  federal  courts  do  not  have  authority  to  review  the \njudgments of the state courts even when a federal question is presented.  Centres, Inc. v. Town of \nBrookfield, 148 F.3d 699, 700 (7th Cir. 1998).  If the injury complained of resulted from the state \ncourt judgment itself, or if the plaintiffs ask the district court to consider collateral attacks on \n- 29 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 29 of 31   Document 156 \n\nstate court judgments, the doctrine will apply.  See GASH Assocs. v. Village of Rosemont, 995 \nF.2d 726, 727 (7th Cir. 1993). \n  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine extends beyond issues actually raised in state court to \nissues that are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the state court proceedings.  Feldman, 460 U.S. at \n483 n.16; Johnson v. Collins, 58 F. Supp. 2d 890, 897 (N.D. Ill. 1999).  The Seventh Circuit \nnoted that there is \"no bright line that separates a federal claim that is 'inextricably intertwined' \nwith a state court judgment from a claim that is not so intertwined.\"  Ritter v. Ross, 992 F.2d 750, \n754 (7th Cir. 1993).  The crucial point is whether the district court is in essence being called \nupon to review the state-court judgment.  Id.  Thus, while 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 creates a civil cause \nof action against public officials for violating a person's constitutional rights, that cause of action \nis constrained by the jurisdictional principles of Rooker-Feldman.  Young v. Murphy, 90 F.3d \n1225, 1230-31 (7th Cir. 1996). \n  Konitzer has already litigated a petition for a name change in Brown County Case No. 00 \nIP 32 captioned In the Matter of a Change of Name of Scott Allen Konitzer, where he requested that \nhis name be changed to Donna Dawn Konitzer (DFOF ยถ 141).  Through this action, a state court \nwas called on to determine both Konitzerโs rationale for wanting the name change, and DOCโs \nrationale for opposing such a change (see DFOF ยถ 142).  As such, the present request to be referred \nto as โDonna Dawn Konitzerโ is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the state court proceedings.  \nKonitzer is, in essence, requesting a federal district court to review the state-court judgment \ndenying his name change petition.  This is not permissible under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, and \nsummary judgment is proper. \n- 30 - \nCase 2:03-cv-00717-CNC   Filed 02/28/06   Page 30 of 31   Document 156 \n\nCONCLUSION \n  This court should grant the defendantsโ motion for partial summary judgment as to the \nplaintiffโs request for injunctive relief to implement recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, \n12, 13 and 14. \n  Dated at Madison, Wisconsin, this 28th day of February, 2006. \n  PEGGY A.
