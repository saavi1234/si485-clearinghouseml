    "summary": "<p>On February 14, 2008, a pretrial detainee filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff sued TransCor America, LLC and two of its employee officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988.  TransCor is a company that transports pretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United States for federal, state, and local governments. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, initiated this action on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated. He requested declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The complaint included two claims for relief for: (1) violations of the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and (2) violation of civil rights under California Civil Code § 52.1. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's policy, practice, or custom of transporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in poor conditions amounted to violations of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. He also claimed that these practices violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from the use to excessive force.</p><p>The plaintiff alleged that TransCor transported pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages in which they could neither stand up nor lie down for more than 24 hours at a time, handcuffed, chained, and in shackles. He also claimed that TransCor failed to provide its detainees with adequate foods, fluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care. Plaintiff also claimed that after four days of traveling, the two individual defendant employees of TransCor sprayed his face with pepper spray, walked him into poles, and punched him. Plaintiff was not allowed to shower or change clothes or see a nurse or a doctor until approximately two days later.     </p><p>On May 8, 2008, the case was assigned to Judge Susan Illston who remained the district court judge for the life of the case. On August 11, 2008, she denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint but granted its motion for a more definite statement on the plaintiff's claims under California law. In response to that order, on August 21, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint adding two additional named plaintiffs and specifying its claimed civil rights violations under California law.  </p><p>Discovery began in early 2009. Judge Illston issued a protective order to maintain business confidentiality for TransCor. </p><p>On October 14, 2009, Judge Illston denied the defendants' motion to transfer venue and granted the plaintiffs' motion to file a second amended complaint. 2009 WL 3334889. On October 19, 2009, the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint. It widened the definition of the class to include pretrial detainees and prisoners whose claims were timely as of February 14, 2006, two years before the original complaint was filed. The plaintiffs indicated that they had unintentionally excluded class members, including juveniles and state hospital inmates, who they learned more about during pre-class certification discovery. </p><p>On February 16, 2010, Judge Illston granted part of the plaintiffs' motion for class certification by granting certification to a class more narrow than sought by the plaintiffs. 2010 WL 583972. Specifically, it defined the class as pretrial detainees and prisoners transported by TransCor on behalf of a state agency between February 14, 2006 and February 16, 2010 who were forced to remain in restraints in the transport vehicle for more than 24 hours without being allowed to sleep overnight in a bed. It excluded anyone transported by TransCor on behalf of a federal agency. She also established a subclass to include people transported for more than 24 hours without being allowed to sleep in a bed. On March 16, 2010, Judge Illston approved the plaintiffs' motion to post a notice of pendency of this class action in Prison Legal News for three successive months. </p><p>The defendants subsequently sought to appeal that order. On April 21, 2011, Judges Raymond Fisher and Milan Smith Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, denied defendants' petition to appeal the District Court's class action certification. On January 24, 2011, the United States Supreme Court denied defendants' petition for writ of certiorari.</p><p>Once back before the District Court, the parties each moved for summary judgment. On August 8, 2012, Judge Illston granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, finding that on a class-wide basis, the fact that class members were transported, restrained, and denied overnight sleep in a bed for 24 hours did not amount to a constitutional violation. 2012 WL 3257659. She noted that this did not preclude finding a constitutional violation for individual prisoners who were detained for longer periods or in different conditions with specific injuries. </p><p>On October 11, 2012, Judge Illston denied plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class certification order to establish classes of persons transported for two, three, four or more days. The effect of these orders was to restart the clock on the statute of limitations applicable to claims of persons who had been in the originally certified class. On December 12, 2012, the court granted the plaintiffs' request to prominently publish information about the litigation in Prison Legal News, explaining that the claims of other prisoners would be barred if they did not move to file their own actions in court. </p><p>On January 31, 2013, Judge Illston ordered the case dismissed with prejudice after the parties advised her that they agreed to a private settlement, though she noted that they could file something with the court within the next 90 days to get it back on the calendar if settlement had not yet occurred. On April 3, 2013, Judge Illston granted the parties' request to amend the order to stipulate that while the claims for the three named plaintiffs were dismissed with prejudice, the claims of the other class members were dismissed without prejudice. It also stated that the settlement did not include any side paying the others' attorney fees.</p><p>On April 8, 2013, members of the original class who did not settle filed another class action complaint in the Northern District of California, which is also in this <a href=\"https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16818\">Clearinghouse</a>. On May 24, 2013, Judge Illston issued a notice that this second suit against Transcor America was related to the first and would be reassigned to her. Transcor moved for a venue transfer to the Middle District of Tennessee, which Judge Illston granted finding that while either venue was generally proper, Tennessee was more convenient as the location of TransCor's headquarters, non-party witnesses, and relevant documents. That case was transferred on August 29, 2013.</p><p>This case, however, is now closed.</p>",

The company attempted to appeal the judge's definition of the class to the United States Supreme Court but certiorari was denied. The case was later settled between the company and the three named plaintiffs. As a result, other members of the class filed their own separate lawsuit with a related claim against the same company.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part \ndefendants' motion, and GRANTS plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. \n \nBACKGROUND  \nOn  [*2] February 14, 2008, plaintiff Kevin Schilling filed this lawsuit against Transcor America, LLC \n(\"Transcor\"), Sergeant John Smith, Officer Blanden, and Does 1-100. The complaint alleges that Transcor is a for-profit \nTennessee corporation licensed to do business in California whose business entails the transportation of pretrial detain-\nees and prisoners throughout the United States on behalf of federal, state and local governments. Complaint P 10. The \ncomplaint also alleges that at all material times, each of the defendants was acting under color of state and federal law. \nId. P 14. \nPlaintiff alleges that in or about early September 2006, he was arrested at his home in Vallejo, California on a no-\nbail warrant issued by a court in Las Vegas. Id. P 18. After being detained for several days at a detention facility in \nFairfield, California, plaintiff was picked up at the detention facility by agents and/or employees of Transcor. Id. P 19. \nThe complaint alleges that plaintiff was strip searched before boarding the transport van, and that he \"was then hand-\ncuffed, a restraint was applied that secured his hands to his waist, and he was shackled. After boarding the transport van, \n\n \nplaintiff was seated  [*3] on a metal bench in a small, locked metal cage in which it was impossible for him to stand up \nor sit down.\" Id. The complaint alleges that for the next several days, plaintiff remained in the transport van, restrained \nand shackled in the metal cage, while the van meandered around California picking up and dropping off pretrial detain-\nees and/or prisoners. Id. P 20. Plaintiff alleges that during approximately 6 days total in the transport van, he was pro-\nvided with only two meals per day; he was not permitted to lie down, stand up, bathe, shave, brush his teeth or change \nhis clothes; he was forced to use the on-board toilet at defendants' convenience; and aside from the steps from his cage \nto the toilet and back, he was allowed no physical activity. Id. PP 21-22. Plaintiff also alleges that after being in the van \nfor several days, he realized that the van was headed back to Fairfield and he demanded to speak to the warden. Id. P 22. \nThe complaint alleges that in response, and while he was detained as described above, defendants Blanden and Smith \ngrabbed him, sprayed pepper spray in his face, purposely walked him into poles, and along with an unknown Transcor \nemployee, punched him. Id.  [*4] Plaintiff alleges that he was not allowed to see a doctor or a nurse until the transport \nvan reached Imperial County Jail. Id. \nPlaintiff filed this action on behalf of class consisting of all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported \nby Transcor and forced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, from two years preceding the filing of the \ncomplaint to the date this case is resolved. Id. P 28. The complaint also alleges a similar subclass of all pretrial detainees \nand prisoners transported in California. Id. P 29. The complaint alleges claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of \nthe Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and the California State Unruh Act. Plaintiff \nseeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages. \n \nDISCUSSION  \nDefendants contend that plaintiff Schilling, who was a pretrial detainee when he was transported by Transcor, lacks \nstanding to assert any claims under the Eighth Amendment, which defendants assert only applies to claims by convicted \nprisoners. Defendants also contend that Schilling lacks standing to seek injunctive and declaratory relief because the \ncomplaint does not - and could not -  [*5] allege the likelihood that he would suffer a future injury, namely being ar-\nrested, charged with a crime, transported to a correctional facility by Transcor, and that he would be subjected to the \nsame constitutional deprivations as alleged in the complaint. \nPlaintiff responds, and the Court agrees, that defendants' arguments are premature and can be renewed in the con-\ntext of a motion for class certification. At the time of class certification and upon a fuller factual record, the Court will \nconsider whether Schilling could adequately represent convicted prisoners. Plaintiff also states that he will consider \namending the complaint to define subclasses prior to moving for class certification. Similarly, the Court cannot deter-\nmine solely on the basis of the complaint and in the absence of any discovery that plaintiff cannot maintain a claim for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. \nDefendants also move for a more definite statement related to plaintiff's claim under the California Unruh Act. \nPlaintiff concedes that the complaint cites to a different California statute, the Tom Bane Act, and not the Unruh Act, \nand seeks leave to correct this error. The Court GRANTS plaintiff leave to so amend  [*6] the complaint. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part defendants' motion to dismiss the com-\nplaint and for a more definite statement. (Docket No. 4). Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint no later than August \n22, 2008. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: August 11, 2008 \n/s/ Susan Illston \nSUSAN ILLSTON \nUnited States District Judge \n ",

For the reasons set forth \nbelow, plaintiffs' motion will be GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \n \nBACKGROUND  \nPlaintiffs Kevin Schilling, John Pinedo and William Tellez filed this lawsuit against TransCor America, LLC \n(\"TransCor\"). TransCor is a Tennessee corporation licensed to do business in California, whose business entails the \ntransportation of pretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United States on behalf of federal, state and local gov-\nernments. Plaintiffs allege that TransCor transports pretrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that amount to cruel \nand unusual punishment. Each of the named plaintiffs alleges that he was transported by TransCor for more than 24 \n\n \nhours and subjected to inhumane conditions during his journey, including being shackled and kept in a cage, and de-\nprived of access to regular food, water, and bathrooms. The second amended complaint alleges two class claims  [*3] \nfor relief: (1) a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and (2) a \nclaim under Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1, for violation of civil rights under California law. \nThe evidence shows that between February 14, 2006 and July 21, 2009, 1 thousands of prisoners 2 were transported \nfor more than 24 continuous hours on at least one leg of their journeys. Plaintiffs assert that some of these prisoners \nwere also picked up by a second vehicle, and transported for an additional period of more than 24 continuous hours. \nAccording to TransCor, prisoners in transit for more than 24 hours are transported on 19-, 23-, or 30-passenger trans-\nporters. 3 The 19- and 23-passenger transporters are staffed with four \"transportation specialists,\" and the 30-passenger \ntransporters are staffed with five specialists. Each crew is assigned to a 5-day transport, which originates from and re-\nturns to the same hub location. During a 5 day trip, prisoners are picked up and dropped off at various correctional fa-\ncilities. Prisoners will sometimes be dropped off at a hub before reaching their final destination, and TransCor states \nthat its goal is to \"deliver all inmates within  [*4] 10 days of pickup,\" which includes both transit and housing time. \nDef's Ex. 8 at 114-15; Ex. 9 at 18-19. \n \n1   The class period is February 14, 2006 to the present. \n2   The parties dispute whether TransCor's records can be interpreted as showing how many prisoners were \ntransported, as opposed to the number of \"instances of transport.\" According to TransCor, one prisoner could \nhave multiple \"instances of transport.\" In any event, there is no dispute that TransCor transported thousands of \nprisoners during the class period. \n3   There are also some prisoners transported on vans. That issue is discussed infra. \nTransCor's policy and practice is that restraints, including handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, interconnects and \nblack boxes, are applied to all prisoners, with the exception that pregnant women are not required to wear a belly chain \nor shackles. An \"interconnect\" is a chain approximately two feet long that is used to connect two prisoners together. \nHandcuffs are attached to the belly chain to prevent the prisoner from raising his or her arms. The black boxes are \nplaced over the links connecting a prisoner's handcuffs, and they restrict wrist movement. \nEach TransCor transport vehicle is divided  [*5] into compartments, or cages. Prisoners are locked inside the cages. \nMost transport vehicles have a toilet on board, and prisoners are permitted to use the toilets only when the vehicle is \nstopped and they are let out of their cage and escorted to the toilet by a TransCor employee. TransCor asserts that stops \nare made for bathroom breaks every 3 to 4 hours, and that prisoners are also allowed to use the restroom any time the \ntransporter stops for a pick up or a drop off. Prisoners remain in restraints and are chained to one another while using \nthe toilet. Prisoners are advised against lying down in the transport vehicle, and if they sleep, they sleep sitting in their \nseats. \nThe parties dispute the extent to which prisoners are allowed to exercise. Plaintiffs assert that when the vehicle is \nstopped, prisoners are sometimes allowed to stand up and stretch, to the extent that they can in their restraints and while \nchained to one another. TransCor asserts that prisoners are encouraged to stand up and stretch during stops, and that \nprisoners are permitted to walk up and down the transporter's aisle, two at a time, during restroom breaks once those \ninmates who need to use the restroom have  [*6] done so. \nPrisoners are provided with \"fast food\" meals during a transport. TransCor asserts that water is available to prison-\ners on all transporters at any time upon request. \nTransCor asserts that prisoners are issued TransCor uniforms upon boarding a transporter, while plaintiffs assert \nthat prisoners are not given a change of clothes. 4 It is undisputed that there is no running water on the transporters, and \nprisoners are not allowed to brush their teeth or shave. TransCor asserts that prisoners are provided hand sanitizers and \nhand wipes to use after using the bathroom and before eating. \n \n4   TransCor asserts that prisoners who are staying overnight at a hub are permitted to shower, shave, and wash \ntheir clothes. However, these prisoners are not members of the proposed class or subclass. \n \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nThe decision as to whether to certify a class is committed to the discretion of the district court within the guidelines \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23; see also Cummings v. Connell, 316 F.3d 886, 895 (9th \nCir. 2003). A court may certify a class if a plaintiff demonstrates that all of the prerequisites of Federal Rule of Civil \n\n \nProcedure 23(a) have been met, and  [*7] that at least one of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b) \nhave been met. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23; see also Valentino v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 (9th Cir. 1996). \nRule 23(a) provides four prerequisites that must be satisfied for class certification: (1) the class must be so numer-\nous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) questions of law or fact exist that are common to the class, (3) the \nclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representa-\ntive parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). \nA plaintiff must also establish that one or more of the grounds for maintaining the suit are met under Rule 23(b), in-\ncluding (1) that there is a risk of substantial prejudice from separate actions; (2) that declaratory or injunctive relief \nbenefitting the class as a whole would be appropriate; or (3) that common questions of law or fact predominate and the \nclass action is superior to other available methods of adjudication. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b). \nIn determining the propriety of a class action, the question is not whether the plaintiffs  [*8] have stated a cause of \naction or will prevail on the merits, but, rather, whether the requirements of Rule 23 are met. See Staton v. Boeing Co., \n327 F.3d 938, 954 (9th Cir. 2003); see also Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. \n2d 732 (1974). The Court is obliged to accept as true the substantive allegations made in the complaint. See In re Petro-\nleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., 691 F.2d 1335, 1342 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Blackie v. Barrack, 524 F.2d 891, 901 (9th \nCir. 1975). Therefore the class order is speculative in one sense because the plaintiff may not be able to later prove the \nallegations. See Blackie, 524 F.2d at 901 n. 17. However, although the Court may not require preliminary proof of the \nclaim, it \"need not blindly rely on conclusory allegations which parrot Rule 23 requirements. Courts may also consider \nthe legal and factual issues presented by plaintiff's complaint.\" 2 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on Class \nActions, 7.26 (4th ed.2005). Sufficient information must be provided to form a reasonably informed judgment on each \nof the requirements of Rule 23. See Blackie, 524 F.2d at 901 n. 17. In order to safeguard due process interests and the \njudicial process,  [*9] the Court conducts an analysis that is as rigorous as necessary to determine whether class certifi-\ncation is appropriate. See Chamberlan v. Ford Motor Co., 402 F.3d 952, 961 (9th Cir. 2005); see also Gen. Tel. Co. of \nSw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 161, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982). \n \nDISCUSSION  \nPlaintiffs seek to certify a class of \"all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor America \nLLC, its agents and/or employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, whose claims are \ntimely under California law, including the tolling provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 352 and \n352.1.\" Second Amended Compl. P 18. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a subclass of pretrial detainees and prisoners who \nwere transported in California. Id. P 19. \nDefendants oppose class certification on numerous grounds. First, defendants contend that the proposed class is not \nobjectively ascertainable, and they raise specific objections to the inclusion of particular types of inmates in the pro-\nposed class and subclass. Second, defendants contend that the named plaintiffs are not typical or adequate. Third, de-\nfendants argue that while there are some common legal and factual issues,  [*10] individual issues predominate such \nthat class certification is not appropriate. Fourth, defendants argue that a class action is not a superior method of adjudi-\ncation because of manageability problems and the interest of class members in pursuing individual actions. Finally, de-\nfendants contend that plaintiffs' claims under the California Tom Bane Civil Rights Act cannot be certified because that \nstatute only provides for individual actions. \n \nI. Challenges to scope and definition of class and subclass  \n \nA. \"Objectively ascertainable\" and tolling  \nDefendants contend that the proposed class and subclass are not objectively ascertainable \"to the extent they are de-\nfined by prisoners falling within the tolling provision of [California Code of Civil Procedure] § 352.\" Section 352 tolls \nthe time to file a claim if the claimant was \"under the age of majority or insane\" at the time the claim accrued. Cal. \nCode Civ. Proc. § 352. Defendants argue that while a class member's age is objectively ascertainable, the Court would \nnevertheless be required to conduct individualized determinations about an inmate's length of minority status and re-\nlease date. Defendants argue that making determinations about a class  [*11] member's insanity is even more compli-\ncated because it would require an inquiry into each person's medical history and evidence that he or she was \"incapable \nof caring for his or her property or transacting business or understanding the nature or effects of his or her acts\" at the \ntime of the transport. Alcott Rehab. Hosp. v. Superior Court, 93 Cal. App. 4th 94, 101, 112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807 (2001). \n\n \nDefendants argue that simply because a prisoner was picked up or dropped off at a hospital for the mentally ill does not \nmean that the prisoner was \"insane\" under Section 352, because a finding of insanity requires an inquiry into each per-\nson's medical history, and evidence that he was \"incapable of caring for his or her property or transacting business or \nunderstanding the nature of his or her acts\" at the time of transport. Alcott Rehab. Hosp. v. Superior Court, 93 Cal. App. \n4th 94, 101, 112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 807 (2001). Plaintiffs respond that this standard -- \"incapable of caring for his or her \nproperty or transacting business or understanding the nature of his or her act\" -- is an objective one, and that \"while lay \nopinion may or may not be sufficient to establish the requisite mental disability, the expert reports used to justify the  \n[*12] potential plaintiffs' confinement should be available, and can be obtained during the claims process.\" Plaintiffs' \nReply at 3:7-9. \nThe Court agrees with defendants that including inmates who were transported prior to the class period but whose \nclaims have been tolled raises significant ascertainability problems. To determine whether a putative class member's \nclaim is timely, the Court would need to evaluate each person's length of insanity or minority status, as well as prison \nrelease date. With regard to those persons whose claims are tolled on account of insanity, the tolling analysis would \ninvolve the further individualized inquiry about the degree and nature of the person's mental illness. The Court finds it \nappropriate to define the class to include only those pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported between Feb-\nruary 14, 2006 and the present because this class period will encompass all timely claims and is precise, objective and \nascertainable. \n \nB. Federal prisoners  \nNext, defendants contend that the proposed class and subclass cannot include federal inmates because § 1983 only \nauthorizes claims against state actors, and not against entities acting under color of federal  [*13] law. See Daly-Murphy \nv. Winston, 837 F.2d 348, 355 (9th Cir. 1987) (\"There is no valid basis for a claim under section 1983, in that Daly-\nMurphy's allegations are against federal officials acting under color of federal law.\"). However, as plaintiffs correctly \nnote, the issue is not whether a potential class member was a federal or state inmate, but rather whether TransCor was \nacting on behalf of a state or federal agency when transporting inmates. Plaintiffs provide the example of plaintiff Wil-\nliam Tellez, who was transported from the Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, California, to the Las Vegas Metro Police \nDepartment pursuant to a writ issued on behalf of the Las Vegas Metro Police Department. TransCor's Order Detail for \nthat transport states that the \"customer\" was the Las Vegas Metro Police Department. Snell Decl. Ex. S at 1. The Court \nagrees with plaintiffs that because the \"customer\" is identified on each prisoner's Order Detail, the determination of \nwhether TransCor was acting on behalf or a state or federal agency can easily be made during the claims process. \n \nC. Administrative remedies  \nDefendants also argue that the proposed class and subclass cannot include prisoners who failed  [*14] to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act. The PLRA requires that prior to bringing an \n\"action with respect to prison conditions under section 1983,\" a prisoner confined in any jail or prison must exhaust \n\"such administrative remedies as are available.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). However, administrative exhaustion is not re-\nquired \"when no pertinent relief can be obtained through the internal process.\" Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 935 (9th \nCir. 2005); see also Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 675, 384 U.S. App. D.C. 240 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (the Act's \nexhaustion requirement does not apply in a case \"in which there is no administrative process to exhaust.\"). Because the \nfailure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, defendants have the burden of raising and proving that an administrative \nremedy is available. Id. at 936. \nPlaintiffs contend that the evidence relied on by defendants fails to prove that an administrative remedy was avail-\nable to plaintiffs. The Court agrees. Defendants have submitted excerpts from the depositions of Sondra Pedigo, who \nwas designated by TransCor as the person most knowledgeable about prisoner complaints, and Charles Westbrook, \nTransCor's Director  [*15] of Operations. Ms. Pedrigo testified that there is \"not a standard form for a prisoner to make \na complaint,\" and that \"Normally, if there is a prisoner complaint, they'll wait until they get to their facility they're being \ndropped off at, and that's where they'll make their complaint. And then once they make that complaint, then that's when \nwe get a phone call in our corporate office from that facility.\" Snell Supp. Decl. Ex. HH (Pedigo depo. at 171:14-24). \nMs. Pedigo did not know whether records were kept of those complaints. Id. at 171:25-172:7. Mr. Westbrook testified \nthat he has never seen any complaints, and that \"if [prisoners] have any complaints, what they're told is, once you get to \nyour facility -- once you get to your destination, you can file a grievance at that point.\" Def's Ex. 11 (Westbrook depo. \nat 42:12-14). When asked, \"Do you know what happens to prisoner grievances that may be filed at the institutions to \nwhich they are transported?,\" Mr. Westbrook answered, \"Again, sir, that's not my field.\" Id. at 42:15-19. Defendants \n\n \nhave also submitted the deposition testimony of Fred Wisdom, who trains TransCor employees, and who testified that \nhe trains employees to record  [*16] prisoner complaints on incident reports, which are then sent to headquarters. Def's \nEx. 6 (Wisdom depo. at 24:1-25:1). This evidence falls far short of showing that there was an internal TransCor griev-\nance process available to inmates who had complaints about their transports. To the extent defendants assert that prison-\ners should exhaust their administrative remedies by filing complaints at the institutions to which they are dropped off or \npicked up, TransCor has made no showing that the institutions would be able to address or remedy the alleged deficien-\ncies in TransCor's policies and procedures. Cf. Malik v. District of Columbia, 574 F.3d 781, 785, 387 U.S. App. D.C. \n420 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (examining correctional facility's grievance policy and finding that institutional transfers were not \ngrievable matters). \nDefendants also rely on Malik v. District of Columbia, 512 F. Supp. 2d 28 (D.D.C. 2007), rev'd on other grounds, \n574 F.3d 781, 387 U.S. App. D.C. 420. In Malik, a pro se prisoner 5 sued the District of Columbia, a correctional serv-\nices company retained by the District, and TransCor, claiming Eighth Amendment violations during a 40-hour bus ride \ntransferring the inmate between two facilities. The court found that the inmate failed  [*17] to exhaust administrative \nremedies as to the District and the correctional services company, and denied TransCor's motion for summary judgment \non the ground that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff had exhausted remedies under \nthe company's informal grievance policy. Id. at 32. In Malik the plaintiff claimed that he had filed a complaint, and it \ndid not appear that the then-pro se plaintiff challenged the adequacy of the grievance process itself. Moreover, in Malik \nTransCor submitted evidence of an informal policy whereby inmates were directed to send complaints to particular de-\npartments or people, and TransCor employees were assigned to investigate complaints. Id. at 32. There has been no \nsuch factual showing here. Finally, even if TransCor had administrative remedies available to inmates, plaintiff Schill-\ning was not required to exhaust those remedies under the PLRA because he was not an inmate at the time he filed this \nlawsuit. See Talamantes v. Leyva, 575 F.3d 1021, 1024 (9th Cir. 2009). \n \n5   The 2007 district court decision states that the plaintiff was pro se. At the February 12, 2010 hearing, defense \ncounsel, who is also defense counsel in Malik,  [*18] stated that the Malik plaintiff is currently represented by \ncounsel. \n \nD. Physical injury  \nDefendants also argue that the class and subclass cannot include prisoners who suffered no physical injury. The \nPLRA provides that \"[n]o Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" 42 \nU.S.C. § 1997e(e). The Ninth Circuit has held that the injury \"need not be significant but must be more than de mini-\nmis,\" and that \"[t]his interpretation reflects Congress's intent in passing the PLRA . . . to curtail frivolous prisoner litiga-\ntion . . . [and] to reduce the burgeoning volume of prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\" Oliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d \n623, 627-28 (9th Cir. 2002). \nPlaintiffs contend that the \"physical injury\" requirement of the PLRA is met because the named plaintiffs allege \nthat they suffered physical injuries as a result of their treatment by TransCor, and it is not necessary for every member \nof the class to demonstrate \"physical injury.\" See Kelsey v. County of Schoharie, No. 1:04-CV-299, 2007 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 16252, 2007 WL 603406, at *11 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 21, 2007)  [*19] (\"The language of § 1997e(e) requires a show-\ning of physical injury only in suits brought, i.e. commenced or filed, by prisoners, not those in which they join as mem-\nbers of a class action.\"), rev'd on other grounds, 567 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 2009). Defendants have not cited any authority \nholding that the physical injury requirement applies to class members. In the absence of any such authority, the Court \nfinds that the physical injury requirement is satisfied because the named plaintiffs allege physical injury. This interpreta-\ntion is consistent with the intent of the PLRA, because it ensures that the lawsuit is not frivolous, and requiring every \nclass member to meet the physical injury requirement would not reduce prisoner litigation. Moreover, claims for de-\nclaratory and injunctive relief are unaffected by § 1997e(e); therefore, the statute \"does not nullify the Eighth Amend-\nment by leaving violations of it without a remedy.\" Zehner v. Trigg, 133 F.3d 459, 464 (7th Cir. 1997); accord Harper \nv. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999); Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342, 1346, 332 U.S. App. D.C. \n436 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \n \nE. \"24 hour\" aspect of class definition  \nDefendants contend that the class and subclass  [*20] definition is vague because it does not specify whether it in-\ncludes only those individuals who were on a transporter for more than 24 continuous hours, or whether it also includes \n\n \nindividuals whose total transport was more than 24 hours, but who were taken off a transporter to switch vehicles or to \nbe housed a hub for some period of time during the transport. \nPlaintiffs respond that there is nothing vague about the definition because the total amount of time of each pris-\noner's journey is objectively measurable, and defendants' computerized data makes it possible to calculate the precise \nlength of each prisoner's transport, including each segment of a transport. Plaintiffs clarify that they are seeking certifi-\ncation of a class of prisoners who were transported continuously for more than 24 hours and who were not allowed to \nsleep overnight in a bed, even if those prisoners switched vehicles at some point during their journey. To the extent \nthere is any ambiguity in the proposed definition, this order clarifies that the class and subclass include those individu-\nals. \n \nF. Van transports  \nDefendants contend that individuals who were transported in vans (as opposed to the 19-, 23-, or 30-passenger  \n[*21] \"transporters\") should not be included in the class and subclass for a number of reasons. First, defendants contend \nthat plaintiffs never requested data on van transports during class discovery. However, plaintiffs state that they re-\nquested documents reflecting, inter alia, the types of vehicles in which prisoners were transported. \nSecond, defendants assert that as a factual matter, prisoners transported in vans do not meet the class definition be-\ncause van transports are limited to 15 hours, and if a prisoner has not reached his destination within 15 hours, he is \nhoused overnight and picked up the next day. However, defendants acknowledge that \"occasionally are they transferred \nto another van,\" Opposition at 14:22-23, and thus there could be individuals who were transported for more than 24 \nhours by van. Defendants also object that TransCor's system does not contain information about whether a van transport \nincluded a \"Rest Over Night,\" and therefore TransCor cannot provide a list of van order segments that reflects only \nthose prisoners who were in transit for more than 24 hours. Plaintiffs assert, however, that TransCor has other records, \nsuch as Order Detail Reports, Trip Reports,  [*22] Activity Logs, and Trip Manifests, from which it can be determined \nwhether prisoners transported by van were housed in a facility long enough to sleep in abed. Based on defendants' ad-\nmission that, at least on occasion, prisoners transported in vans have been transported for more than 24 hours, and the \nexistence of records by which these prisoners can be identified, the Court finds it appropriate to include these prisoners \nin the class and subclass. \n \nII. Rule 23(a) requirements: numerosity, commonality, typicality and adequacy  \n \nA. Numerosity  \nBased upon TransCor's records, the estimated total number of members of the proposed class is approximately \n16,000, and the total number of members of the proposed subclass of prisoners transported in California is approxi-\nmately 4,800. Defendants do not contest numerosity, and the Court finds that his requirement is met. \n \nB. Commonality  \nDefendants concede that there are some common issues of law and fact, and instead contend that plaintiffs cannot \ndemonstrate the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement that common issues predominate over individualized questions. The Court \naddresses this issue infra. \n \nC. Typicality and adequacy  \nRule 23(a) requires that plaintiffs show that  [*23] the named plaintiffs' claims are typical of those of the class, and \nthat the named plaintiffs will adequately represent the class. \"Under the rule's permissive standards, representative \nclaims are 'typical' if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substan-\ntially identical.\" Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1020 (9th Cir. 1998). \"Resolution of two questions deter-\nmines legal adequacy: (1) do the named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class mem-\nbers and (2) will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?\" Id. \nDefendants contend that the named plaintiffs are not typical or adequate for a variety of reasons, discussed below. \nDefendants do not challenge the qualifications of plaintiffs' counsel, and the Court finds that the plaintiffs' counsel is \nqualified and able to litigate this case. \n \n1. John Pinedo  \n\n \nDefendants assert that plaintiff Pinedo is not typical because his transport was only 23 hours and 28 minutes, and \nthus he cannot represent a class of prisoners who were transported for more than 24 hours. In so arguing, defendants \nassert that the TransCor  [*24] \"PECS\" 6 report for Pinedo's transport, which shows that he was in transit for 24 hours \nand 23 minutes, is inaccurate and overstates the time of the transport. Defendants have submitted the declaration of \nJames Crouch, TransCor's Director of Planning, which states that the time of pick up contained on a report is the time \nthat the vehicle arrived at the facility, not the time that the prisoner is actually restrained and put in TransCor's care. \nDef's Ex 1 (Crouch Decl. PP 46). Defendants assert that the accurate pick up and drop off times can be determined from \nthe \"Activity Logs\" kept for each transport. \n \n6   \"PECS\" stands for TransCor's proprietary Prisoner Extraction and Control System, which is used to track \ntransport orders and plan trips. Def's Ex. 1 (Crouch Decl. P 6). \nPlaintiffs respond that defendants are asking the Court to ignore TransCor's business records, which purport to \nshow the \"actual time\" of inmate pick up and drop off, and to rely instead on Mr. Crouch's \"understanding\" and \"expec-\ntation.\" Plaintiffs also note that notwithstanding defendants' assertions about the inaccuracy of the times reported in the \nPECS system, defendants use those same PECS records when calculating  [*25] the length of transports. See id. PP 31-\n36. The Court finds that Mr. Crouch's testimony does not outweigh TransCor's business records, which TransCor itself \nrelies upon, and thus that Mr. Pinedo may represent the class. \nDefendants also contend that Mr. Pinedo is not an adequate representative because he had not read the complaint \nprior to the time it was filed. However, this fact does not render Mr. Pinedo inadequate to represent the class, and as \nplaintiffs note, Mr. Pinedo had read the complaint by the time he was deposed, and plaintiffs assert that Mr. Pinedo has \ntaken an active role in the case. Defendants do not contend that Mr. Pinedo has any conflicts of interest with the class, \nand the Court finds that he is an adequate named plaintiff. \n \n2. Plaintiff William Tellez  \nDefendants argue that Mr. Tellez is not typical or adequate because he was and is a federal inmate. As explained \nsupra, however, TransCor transported Mr. Tellez to and from the Las Vegas Metro Police Department, and TransCor's \nOrder Detail states that its \"customer\" was the Las Vegas Metro Police Department. Snell Decl. Ex. S at 1. Thus, absent \nevidence to the contrary, TransCor was acting on behalf of a state agency  [*26] when it transported Mr. Tellez, and \nthus he can maintain a § 1983 claim against TransCor. \nDefendants also challenge Mr. Tellez on the ground that he became involved in this case after reading about it in \nPrison Legal News. This fact alone does not render Mr. Tellez an inadequate plaintiff, and defendants do not assert that \nMr. Tellez has any conflicts with the proposed class. The Court finds that he is an adequate named plaintiff. \n \n3. Plaintiff Kevin Schilling  \nDefendants challenge plaintiff Schilling's typicality on the ground that he alleges he was assaulted by defendants \nSmith and Brummett during his transport. Defendants argue that Schilling's individual assault claims are unique to him \nand thus somehow render him atypical. However, Rule 23 permits actions that include both class and individual claims, \nand such cases are common. See Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 23(c)(4); Probe v. State Teachers' Retirement Sys., 780 F.2d 776, \n780 (9th Cir. 1986). Defendants have not identified any particular problems with the concurrent litigation of the class \nclaims and Schilling's individual claims, and the Court finds that Schilling's individual claims do not bar him from act-\ning as a named plaintiff. \n \nIII. Rule 23(b)(3)  [*27] requirements  \n \nA. Common vs. individual issues  \nDefendants contend that plaintiffs cannot show that \"questions of law or fact common to class members predomi-\nnate over any questions affecting only individual members,\" as required by Rule 23(b)(3). Defendants contend that al-\nthough there are common issues as to the nature of TransCor's policies and procedures, whether those policies and pro-\ncedures violated a prisoner's constitutional rights will involve individualized, fact-specific determinations. For example, \ndefendants argue that a prisoner's Fourth Amendment excessive force claim challenging the use of restraints will depend \non the facts and circumstances of his transport, including whether he was convicted of or charged with a violent crime, \nand whether he had a history of escape attempts. Defendants argue that the Eighth Amendment claims involve even \n\n \nmore individualized inquiries about whether each class member was adequately provided food, fluids, exercise, hy-\ngiene, and medical care. Defendants note that the three named plaintiffs had different experiences with regard to how \nmany meals and bathroom breaks they were provided during their transports. \nPlaintiffs respond that minor variations  [*28] in inmates' experiences during their transports should not defeat cer-\ntification because the predominant issue in this case is whether defendants' policy of denying prisoners \"rest over night\" \nwhile the prisoners remain in restraints in a vehicle violates the inmates' constitutional rights. Plaintiffs rely on cases in \nwhich similar claims were certified, such as Thomas v. Baca, 231 F.R.D. 397 (C.D. Cal. 2005), in which the court certi-\nfied a class of county jail detainees who alleged that their constitutional rights were violated when the sheriff's depart-\nment required them to sleep on the floor. See id. at 402 (\"The central issue to a claim brought by any potential class \nmember is whether the fact that LASD allegedly required him to sleep on the jail floor permits him to recover under § \n1983.\"). \nIn Tyler v. Suffolk County, 253 F.R.D. 8 (D. Mass. 2008), the court certified a class of inmates at a state prison who \nalleged that the conditions of their confinement violated the Eighth Amendment because they were denied free access to \ntoilet facilities. The inmates were housed in \"dry\" cells that were not equipped with toilets, and when the inmates were \nlocked in their cells from 11:00 pm to  [*29] 7:00 am, they could only use the toilets if permitted by the guards on duty. \nId. at 9. The plaintiffs alleged that, due to either the guards' inattention or malice, \"their bathroom access was unreliable \nand they were, at times, forced to urinate and defecate into bags or bottles which could not be emptied until the follow-\ning morning.\" Id. The defendants argued, as TransCor does here, that individual issues predominated because the court \nwould be required to conduct an individualized inquiry about whether each inmate was actually denied access to the \ntoilet facilities. The court rejected that argument, holding \"[t]he government's objections extend beyond the bounds of \nclass certification and address, instead, the merits of the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs' position is that the system of \nbathroom access under which Building 4 operated is per se a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. The questions \nraised by the defendants of whether the system itself was unlawful and how it was modified over time present issues of \nlaw and fact, respectively, which are common to all class members.\" Id. at 10. The court also held that the objections \nraised by the government \"relates to the  [*30] divergent damages among class members rather than to differences in \nliability.\" Id. at 11. \nSimilarly, in Dunn v. City of Chicago, 231 F.R.D. 367 (N.D. Ill. 2005), the court held that the commonality re-\nquirement was satisfied by a class of detainees who were held in interrogation rooms for more than 16 hours and who \nalleged they were subjected to inhuman conditions. The plaintiffs alleged that they were at the \"whim\" of officers and \ndetectives for food, water, and access to bathroom facilities, and that they became sleep-deprived because the metal \nbenches in the interrogation rooms were not long enough for an adult to lie down on. Id. at 370-71. The plaintiffs chal-\nlenged \"(1) the maintenance of an unconstitutional, written policy requiring shackling of detainees held in interrogation \nrooms; (2) the failure to enact policies limiting the amount of time a detainee may be held in an interrogation room; (3) \nthe failure to establish policies for food services and other humane treatment for persons held in the rooms; (4) the fail-\nure to provide proper sleeping facilities for persons held in the rooms, including bedding; and (5) the deliberately indif-\nferent failure to correct a repeated pattern  [*31] of neglect of the human needs of persons held in interrogation rooms.\" \nId. at 372. The defendants opposed certification by arguing that detainees were not subjected to standardized conduct or \nconditions, and they submitted evidence showing, inter alia, that some detainees had been provided food, water, and \naccess to bathrooms. Id. The court held that these factual differences did not defeat commonality: \"The fact that certain \ndetainees were treated marginally better on an ad hoc basis than others does not alter plaintiffs' allegations that they \nwere subject to the standard practice of prolonged detention in interrogation rooms rather than the lock-up without a \nlegitimate police purpose, and that the interrogation rooms are inherently unfit for human occupancy for more than a \nfew hours.\" Id. 7  \n \n7   The Dunn court did not certify the class because the named plaintiff's claims were time-barred. Id. at 374. \nThe court stated that it would consider allowing a new named plaintiff to represent the class. \nPlaintiffs' claims are similar to those advanced in Tyler, Baca, and Dunn, and the Court agrees with the reasoning \nof those courts that any factual differences in how class members were treated  [*32] do not defeat certification. Plain-\ntiffs challenge the conditions to which they were subjected during 24 hour transports, and it is undisputed that all in-\nmates are restrained during such transports and not provided with a \"rest over night.\" As in Baca and Dunn, plaintiffs \nchallenge the failure to enact policies to ensure adequate access to food, water, and bathroom facilities, and they allege \nthat as a result of such failures, they have been subject to the whim of TransCor employees responsible for each trans-\nport. In order to establish liability, plaintiffs must objectively show that they were deprived of something \"sufficiently \n\n \nserious.\" Foster v. Runnels, 554 F.3d 807, 812 (9th Cir. 2009). Whether inmates who have been transported for more \nthan 24 hours and who are not allowed to sleep overnight have been deprived of something \"sufficiently serious\" can be \ndetermined on a classwide basis. While there is also a subjective component to the analysis in that inmates must also \nshow that a deprivation occurred with deliberate indifference the inmates' needs, id., that inquiry does not mean that the \nlegality of policies and practices applied to all inmates cannot be litigated on a class  [*33] basis. \nDefendants' reliance on Pierce v. County of Orange, 519 F.3d 985, 993-94 (9th Cir. 2008), amended and super-\nseded on denial of reh'g, 526 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 2008), is unavailing. In Pierce, the Ninth Circuit held that the district \ncourt did not abuse its discretion when it decertified a damages class estimated as large as 180,000 pretrial detainees \nbecause, inter alia, class membership was \"highly fluid and indefinite\" and it was undisputed that County records were \nincomplete and unreliable. Id. However, Pierce did not hold that classes challenging prison conditions could not be cer-\ntified, and in fact Pierce involved class-wide liability determinations on claims challenging prison conditions. See gen-\nerally id. \n \nB. Superior method of adjudication  \nRule 23(b)(3) also requires that a class action be superior to other methods of adjudication. Defendants contend that \nthe superiority requirement is not met because there are at least two other pending lawsuits against TransCor that raise \nsimilar claims. However, as plaintiffs note in their reply, both of these cases (Bagent v. Pierce, CV06-1842 (E.D. Cal.)) \nand Myers v. TransCor America LLC, CV 08-00656, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24125 (M.D. Tenn.)) involve pro se liti-\ngants  [*34] who are proceeding in forma pauperis. TransCor also cites a number of cases that have been dismissed \nagainst TransCor; those cases were also largely litigated by pro se plaintiffs. Rather than suggesting that a class action is \nnot a superior method of adjudicating these claims, these cases indicate that a class action with the class represented by \nqualified counsel, is superior to numerous individual pro se cases. 8  \n \n8   Defendants raise a number of other arguments about why a class action is not superior. These arguments are \nlargely duplicative of arguments addressed supra -- such as defendants' arguments about the ascertainability of \nthe class and the predominance of individual issues -- and thus will not be repeated here. \n \nIV. Tom Bane Civil Rights Act  \nDefendants contend that plaintiffs' claims under the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act cannot be certified. The Bane Act \nprovides that \"[a]ny individual whose exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the Constitution . . . has been inter-\nfered with or attempted to be interfered with [through threats, intimidation or coercion] may institute or prosecute in his \nor her own name and on his or her own behalf a civil action for damages.\" Cal. Civil Code § 52.1(b).  [*35] Defendants \nargue that under the plain language of the Bane Act, an individual can only bring a claim \"in his or her own name and \non his or her own behalf,\" and that the Bane Act does not authorize a representative action. \nThere is a split of authority regarding whether a class action can be brought under the Bane Act. Defendants rely on \nTaggart v. Solano County, CIV-S-05-0783 DFL, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31799, 2005 WL 3325752 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 6, \n2005), in which the court held that the structure and language of the statute does not authorize individuals to bring rep-\nresentative actions. The Taggart court noted that Section 52.1(a) authorizes the Attorney General, district attorneys, and \ncity attorneys to bring claims \"in the name of the people of the State of California against a person who interferes with \nthe exercise or enjoyment of the rights of an individual or individuals,\" while Section 52.1(b) specifies that an individual \nmay bring a civil action \"on his or her own behalf.\" 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31799, [WL] at *4. In contrast, plaintiffs rely \non Craft v. County of San Bernadino, No. EDCV 05-359-SGL, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 96979, 2006 WL 4941829 (C.D. \nCal. Mar. 23, 2006), which reached the opposite conclusion and found Taggart \"less than persuasive.\" 2006 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 96979, [WL] at *3. The Craft  [*36] court found that the term \"on his or her own behalf\" in subsection (b) \"may \nmore simply be read as a means to distinguish itself from subsection (a), which authorized suits by the state Attorney \nGeneral for statutory violations,\" rather than a limitation on class actions. Id. The court found significant \"the fact that \nsubsection (g) makes clear that any of the remedies available under section 52.1 are in addition to 'any other action, \nremedy, or procedure that may be available to an aggrieved individual under any other provision of law.' Such 'other \nremedy' includes that provided by California Code of Civil Procedure section 382, the class action statute.\" Id. (quoting \nCal. Civ. Code § 52(g)). The Court agrees with the analysis of the Craft court, and finds that the Bane Act permits class \nclaims because there is no language expressly prohibiting class actions, and because of the broad language of § 52(g) \nproviding that the Bane Act remedies are in addition to other available remedies. \n\n \nDefendants also contend that the Bane Act claim cannot be certified because the Bane Act requires an individual-\nized analysis as to whether each inmate was threatened, intimidated or coerced. See Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1(b).  [*37] \nHowever, plaintiffs have alleged that all inmates were handcuffed and shackled. These allegations are sufficient to meet \nthe \"coercion\" element of a Bane Act claim. See Martin v. County of San Diego, 650 F. Supp. 2d 1094, 1108-09 (S.D. \nCal. 2009). \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS plaintiffs' motion for class certification. (Docket No. 90). The Court \ncertifies the following class and subclass: \n  \n   1. A class of all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor America LLC, its \nagents and/or employees between February 14, 2006 and the present, and who were forced to remain in \nrestraints in the transport vehicle for more than 24 hours without being allowed to sleep overnight in a \nbed. The class includes pretrial detainees and prisoners who were removed from one transport vehicle \nand placed directly onto another, without being housed overnight, whose combined trip lasted more than \n24 hours. The class only includes those pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by \nTransCor on behalf of a state agency, and does not include pretrial detainees and prisoners who were \ntransported on behalf of a federal agency. \n2. A subclass of all pretrial detainees  [*38] and prisoners who were transported by TransCor Amer-\nica LLC, its agents and/or employees in the State of California between February 14, 2006 and the pre-\nsent, and who were forced to remain in restraints in the transport vehicle for more than 24 hours without \nbeing allowed to sleep overnight in a bed. The class includes pretrial detainees and prisoners who were \nremoved from one transport vehicle and placed directly onto another, without being housed overnight, \nwhose combined trip lasted more than 24 hours. The class only includes those pretrial detainees and pris-\noners who were transported by TransCor on behalf of a state agency, and does not include pretrial de-\ntainees and prisoners who were transported on behalf of a federal agency. \n \n  \nThe Court also appoints attorneys Andrew C. Schwartz, Karen L. Snell, and Mark E. Merin as class counsel. \nCounsel for plaintiffs and defendants shall meet and confer and, no later than March 12, 2010, submit a joint form \nof proposed Notice and plan for class notification. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: February 16, 2010 \n/s/ Susan Illston \nSUSAN ILLSTON \nUnited States District Judge \n ",

YOU \nMUST NOW YOUR OWN ACTION IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE YOUR \nRIGHTS.  TIME IS OF THE ESSENSE SO YOU MUST PROCEED IMMEDIATELY! \n \nWHAT HAPPENED? \n \nA case was filed in federal court, in the District Court for the Northern District of California, \non February 14, 2008, against TransCor America, LLC, by Kevin M. Schilling, John Pinedo, \nand William Tellez; on behalf of themselves similarly situated, alleging that the conditions of \ntransport violated the Constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment when \ninmates were transported for more than 24 hours, fully restrained, and deprived of overnight \nsleep in a bed. The case was initially certified to proceed as a class action and the statute of \nlimitation was then tolled for all persons in the class. \n \nOn August 8, 2012, the Court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, finding \nthat the mere fact that a person was transported, restrained, and denied overnight sleep in a \nbed for 24 hours did not violated the Eighth Amendment. On October 11, 2012, the Court \ndenied plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class certification order to establish classes of persons \ntransported for two, three, four or more days.  The effect of these orders is to restart the clock \nticking on the statute of limitations applicable to claims of persons who had been in the \noriginally certified class.  Those claims may be barred by the mere passage of time, unless \nyou take immediate action to preserve your rights by filing your own action in court. \n \nHOW DO I DETERMINE IF MY CLAIM IS BARRED? \n  \nThe statute of limitations is very tricky and varies from state to state.  Generally, the statute \nbegins to run when you were injured (the date of your transport).  You then have a certain \namount of time to pursue your claim by filing an action in court.  Sometimes, this period is \nextended by state statute because of confinement or disability, but these statutes vary from \nstate to state.  Sometimes, you must first exhaust administrative remedies by using the prison \nor jail’s grievance procedures, if available.  If this class action was filed before your right to \nfile a claim expired, the time to file was stayed or tolled until the court’s recent actions when \nthe clock started ticking again.  That’s why you must immediately consult with attorneys to \nfind out how and when you must act in order to protect your rights. \n \nWHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOTHING? \n  \nIf you do nothing, you will lose any right you had to seek relief, in court, for being subjected \nto unconstitutional treatment during transport on a TransCor America, LLC vehicle. \n \nWHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO PROCEED? \n  \nIf you want to pursue your remedies, you must immediately consult with counsel in the state \nwere you presently reside, in Tennessee where TransCor America, LLC has its corporate \noffices, or in any state through which you were transported, to determine your rights.

This is an action f or declaratory and  injunctive relief, damages, and punitive \n4 \ndamages against TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, SGT. JOHN SMITH, OFFICER BLANDEN \n5 \nand DOES 1 THROUGH 100 (persons sued herein by  their fictitious names) for violations of \n6 \nplaintiff’s constitutional rights and those of other similarly situated persons.   \n7 \n2.  In this complaint, plaintiff alleges that TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s official \n8 \npolicy, practice, or custom  of transporting pretri al detainees and prisoners in conditions that \n9 \namount to cruel and unusual punishm ent violated and violates the rights of plaintiff, and each \n10 \nof those persons similarly situated, secured by the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \n11 \nto the U.S. Constitution and entitles plaintiff, and each of those sim ilarly situated, to recover \n12 \ndamages and attorneys’ fees under the Fede ral Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988).   \n13 \nTRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s policies, practices  or customs include but are not lim ited to \n14 \ntransporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages in which a person can neither \n15 \nstand up nor lie down for more than 24 hours at a time while the person is handcuffed, chained, \n16 \nand in shackles, and failing to provide pretrial detainees and prisoners with adequate food, \n17 \nfluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care.    \n18 \n3.  Because TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s official policy, practice, or custom is \n19 \nto transport pretrial detainees and prisoners  in conditions that amount to unlawful detention, \n20 \nexcessive force, and cruel and unusual punishm ent, there is a likelihood of future injuries to \n21 \npretrial detainees and prisoners including members of the plaintiff class.  Accordingly, plaintiff \n22 \nseeks an order declaring unlawful TRANSCOR  AMERICA, LLC’s policy, practice or custom \n23 \nof  transporting pretrial detainees under the conditions described above and enjoining \n24 \nTRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC from engaging in this conduct in the future. \n25 \n4.  Plaintiff includes claims for damages and attorneys’ fees under California state \n26 \nlaw  against TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC for vi olation  of the Bane Civil Rights Act \n27 \n(California Civil Code § 52.1(b)) pursuant to wh ich plaintiff is, and each of those persons \n28 \nsimilarly situated in the subclass of  pretrial detainees and prisoners transported by defendants \nSchilling v.

Plaintiff includes claims for damages and attorneys’ fees under the Federal Civil \n5  Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988) against all de fendants for their violation of his Fourth \n6  and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force, and the right to be \n7  provided with adequate medical care.  \n8  6.  Finally, plaintiff includes a claim  for damages and attorneys’ fees under the \n9  Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988) against TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC and \n10  DOES 1-10 for its failure to adequately s upervise SGT.

This action is brought pursuant to 42  U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth, \n14 \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded \n15 \nupon  28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the aforem entioned  statutory and \n16 \nconstitutional provisions.   \n17 \n8.  The court has supplem ental jurisdiction over plaintiff’s state claim s under 28 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 1367(a). \n19 \n9.  The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs. \n20 \n  PARTIES \n21 \n10.  Plaintiff KEVIN M. SCHILLING is a reside nt of Vallejo, California.

Defendant OFFICER BLANDEN is an ag ent and/or employee of Defendant \n15  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n16  16.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe a nd thereon allege that defendants sued \n17  herein  by their fictitious nam es,  DOES 1 th rough  100, are agents and/or em ployees  of \n18  defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiffs are not currently aware of the true names \n19  and identities of those sued herein as DOES  1 through 100, but will amend their complaint to \n20  include such persons’ real names once said names are made available to them. \n21  17.

Class  action plaintiffs are all those sim ilarly  situated pretrial detainees and \n25  prisoners  who were transported by TRANS COR  AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or \n26  employees, and forced to rem ain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, within the two \n27  years preceding the filing of this Complaint and the date this matter is resolved. \n28  \\\\\\   \nSchilling v.

For purposes of the California Bane Act  Claim, class action plaintiffs are all \n2  those similarly situated pretrial detainees and  prisoners who were transported in the State of \n3  California  by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its ag ents  and/or em ployees,  and forced to \n4  remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, within the two years preceding the filing of \n5  this Complaint and the date this matter is resolved. \n6 \nFACTS \n7 \n20.  In  or about early Septem ber,  2006,  plaintiff  KEVIN M. SCHILLING was \n8 \narrested at his home in Vallejo, California on a no-bail warrant issued by a court in Las Vegas, \n9 \nNevada.   Plaintiff was booked into a detention  facility  in Fairfield, California, where he \n10 \nremained for several days.    \n11 \n21.  On  or about Septem ber  22, 2006, plainti ff  was picked up at the Fairfield \n12 \nDetention facility by agents and/or em ployees of defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n13 \nBefore boarding the transport va n, plaintiff was strip searched.  He was then handcuffed, a \n14 \nrestraint was applied that secured his hands to  his waist, and he was shackled.  After boarding \n15 \nthe transport van, plaintiff was seated on a m etal bench in a small, locked metal cage in which \n16 \nit was impossible for him to stand up or lie down.   \n17 \n22.  For the next several days, plaintiff rem ained in the transport van, restrained as \n18 \ndescribed above, while the van meandered around California -- from Fairfield through counties \n19 \nwithin the Northern District of the United States District Court, to Fresno and then back, once \n20 \nagain through counties within the Northern Distri ct of the United States District Court, to \n21 \nFairfield – picking up and dropping off pretrial detainees and/or prisoners.    \n22 \n23.  During his time in the transport van, plaintiff was provided with only two meals \n23 \na day, which consisted of a fast food sandwich or  hamburger and a cup of water.  Plaintiff was \n24 \nnot permitted to lie down or stand up or shower or shave or brush his teeth or change his \n25 \nclothes.  He was forced to use the on-board to ilet at the defendants’ convenience.  Eventually, \n26 \nit backed up and sm elled bad.  But for the steps  from his cage to the toilet and back, he was \n27 \nallowed no physical activity. \n28 \n\\\\\\ \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.

When, after approximately four days of  traveling in these conditions, plaintiff \n2  realized that the TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC transport van was headed back to Fairfield, he \n3  demanded to talk to the warden.  In response, and while he was still detained as described \n4  above, defendants SGT. JOHN  SMITH and OFFICER BLANDEN grabbed him  and sprayed \n5  pepper spray in his face.  While plaintiff was still unable to see, SGT. JOHN SMITH purposely \n6  walked him into poles and, along with an  unknown TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC employee, \n7  and proceeded to punch him .  Although this occu rred at approximately 3:00 a.m. outside the \n8  Fresno County Jail, plaintiff was not allowed to s hower or change clothes or see a nurse or a \n9  doctor until approximately two days later when, after m aking numerous stops along the way, \n10  the transport van reached Imperial County Jail. \n11  25.  Plaintiff remained in the Imperial County Jail for approximately three days, after \n12  which time he was transported to Las Vegas.    \n13  26.  On or about June 29, 2006, at approximately 9:00 a.m., plaintiff JOHN PINEDO \n14  was picked up by defendant TRANSCRO AMERIC A, LLC, at Kern Valley State Prison in \n15  Delano, California where he was  serving a sentence for possession and sale of m arijuana, and \n16  transported to Santa Barbara County Jail wh ere he arrived on June 30, 2005, m ore than 27 \n17  hours later for a child custody hearing.   \n18  27.  The entire time plaintiff PINEDO was  on defendant TRANSCOR’s transport \n19  vehicle, he was handcuffed, shackled, and restrain ed with a belly chain and chained to other \n20  inmates in a metal cage, unable to lie down, or to sleep during the entire time of his transport.   \n21  28.  During his time in the transport van,  plaintiff PINEDO was permitted only two \n22  opportunities to urinate but could not sit to use the toilet to defecate because the TRANSCOR \n23  personnel would not remove any of the restraints.   \n24  29.  During the entire tim e of his transport, plaintiff PINEDO  was fed only three \n25  “fast food” meals, not permitted to wash, to show er, or to change his clothes, before being \n26  delivered to Santa Barbara County Jail. \n27  30.  In  or about August 2005, plaintiff  TELLEZ  was serving a sentence at the \n28  Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, California, when he was first picked up for transport to Clark \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.  Page 6 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document26    Filed08/21/08   Page7 of 15\n1  County Detention Center.  The trip on the TRANSCOR transport van took six (6) days, during \n2  which time several stops were made to pick up and discharge prisoners along the way.   \n3  31.  Plaintiff TELLEZ was m anacled, shackled and handcuffed during the entire \n4  time of his transport.  He had lim ited access to toilet facilities, was not permitted to shower at \n5  any time during the six (6) day transport, and had only a restricted diet of “fast food” during the \n6  entire time on the transport van.   \n7  32.  Transported in a cage, manacled, shackled, and waist chained, he was unable to \n8  lie down and deprived of sleep during the entire time of the transport.   \n9  33.  Transported by TRANSCOR back to Atwa ter in late February 2006, plaintiff \n10  TELLEZ was again subjected to the sam e abominable conditions he experienced on the initial \n11  trip from Atwater:  six (6) day transport  while handcuffed, shackled and waist chained the \n12  entire time in a small metal cage in which he was unable to lie down and deprived of sleep.   \n13  34.  Again, he was fed only a restricted diet of “fast food”, denied bathroom breaks, \n14  and never unshackled in order to use the toilet to defecate.   \n15  35.  Defendants TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC  and SGT. SMITH and OFFICER \n16  BLANDEN and DOES 1 through 100 are jointly and  severally personally responsible for the \n17  unlawful conduct of which plaintiffs complain. \n18  36.  As a result of being subjected to the ha rsh transportation policies, practices, or \n19  customs described herein, plaintiffs, and all t hose similarly situated, have suffered physical, \n20  mental, and emotional distress, invasion of priv acy, and violation of due  process of law and \n21  federal  and state statutory and constitutional rights, and are entitled to recover dam ages \n22  according to proof, including exemplary damages. \n23 \nCLASS CLAIMS \n24 \n37.  The unlawful detention and transportation, use of excessive force, and cruel and \n25 \nunusual punishment to which plaintiffs and all  those similarly situated were subjected was \n26 \nperformed pursuant to policies, practices,  or customs of TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC and \n27 \nDOES 1-10.  The unlawful detention and transporta tion, use of excessive force, and cruel and \n28 \nunusual punishment complained of herein was enga ged in without regard to the nature of the \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.  Page 7 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document26    Filed08/21/08   Page8 of 15\n1  alleged offense for which plaintiffs, and each of  those similarly situated, had been arrested, \n2  without regard to whether or not plaintiffs,  and each of those sim ilarly situated, had been \n3  convicted of any crime, and without regard to  whether plaintiffs, and each of those sim ilarly \n4  situated, had any history of violence.   \n5  38.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their ow n behalf and on behalf of all persons \n6  similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n7  39.  The class is defined to include all pret rial detainees and prisoners who were \n8  transported by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its ag ents and/or employees, and forced to \n9  remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, from two years preceding the filing of this \n10  Complaint to the date this matter is resolved.   \n11  40.  The subclass for purposes of the Bane Act  claims is all pretrial detainees and \n12  prisoners  transported in California by TR ANSCOR  AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or \n13  employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, from two years \n14  preceding the filing of this Compliant to the date this matter is resolved. \n15  41.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civ il Procedure, Rule 23(a), the m embers \n16  of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know \n17  the exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, \n18  that more than 30,000 persons per year are transported by defendants, and that most of the trips \n19  last more than 24 hours.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that there are \n20  thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n21  42.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n22  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, th at there are m any facts common to the class \n23  including but not lim ited to:  (a)  whether defe ndants have a policy, practice, or custom  of \n24  transporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages, wearing handcuffs, shackles, \n25  and wrist restraints, for m ore than 24 hours at  a time; (b)  whether defendants have a policy, \n26  practice or custom of providing pretrial detain ees and prisoners with inadequate food; (c)   \n27  whether  defendants have a policy, practice or  custom  of providing pretrial detainees and \n28  prisoners with inadequate fluids; (d)  whether  defendants have a policy, practice or custom  of \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.

In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n6  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that  there are many questions of law com mon to \n7  the class including but are not lim ited to:  (a)   whether transporting pretrial detainees and \n8  prisoners in metal cages, wearing handcuffs, shackles, and wrist restraints, unable to lie down \n9  or stand up for m ore than 24 hours at a tim e, violates the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n10  Amendments;  (b)  whether defendants’ policy,  practice  or custom   of providing pretrial \n11  detainees and prisoners with inadequate food violat es pretrial detainees’ right to be free from  \n12  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners ’ right to be free from  cruel and unusual \n13  punishment; (c)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n14  and  prisoners with inadequate fluids violates   pretrial detainees’ right to be free from  \n15  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners ’ right to be free from  cruel and unusual \n16  punishment; (d)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n17  and  prisoners with inadequate hygiene violates   pretrial detainees’ right to be free from  \n18  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners ’ right to be free from  cruel and unusual \n19  punishment; (e)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n20  with inadequate exercise violates pretrial detainees’ right to be free from unreasonable seizure \n21  and detention; and (f)  whether defendants’ po licy, practice or custom  of providing pretrial \n22  detainees and prisoners with inadequate medical care violates pretrial detainees’ right to be free \n23  from unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners’ right to be free from cruel and unusual \n24  punishment. \n25  44.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of \n26  the representative plaintiffs are typical of the cl ass.  Representative plaintiffs have the sam e \n27  interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the class m embers.  Plaintiffs’ claims \n28  arose because of defendants’ official policy, pr actice, or custom of subjecting detainees to \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.  Page 9 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document26    Filed08/21/08   Page10 of 15\n1  unlawful transportation and detention, excessive  force, and cruel and unusual punishm ent.  \n2  Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the sam e legal theories as the claims of the class m embers.  \n3  Each  class m ember  suffered actual dam ages  as  a result of being transported under the \n4  conditions imposed by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n5  45.  In  accordance with Federal Rules of  Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n6  representative  plaintiffs  will f airly  and adequate ly  protect the class interests.  Plaintif fs’ \n7  interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n8  46.  In  accordance with Federal Rules of  Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n9  prosecutions of separate actions by individual m embers of the class would create a risk that \n10  inconsistent or varying adjudications with re spect to individual m embers of the class would \n11  establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.   \n12  47.  In  accordance with Federal Rules of  Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n13  prosecutions of separate actions by individual  members of the class would create a risk of \n14  inconsistent adjudications with respect to i ndividual members of the class which would, as a \n15  practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class \n16  to protect their interests. \n17  48.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs \n18  are  informed  and believe, and thereupon alle ge,  that defendants have acted on grounds \n19  generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory \n20  relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n21  49.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class \n22  action is superior to other available m ethods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \n23  controversy between the parties.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that \n24  the interests of members of the class in indi vidually controlling the prosecution of a separate \n25  action is low, in that most class members would be unable individually to prosecute any action \n26  at all.  Plaintiffs are inform ed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the am ounts at stake for \n27  individuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n28  believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.  Page 10 \nFIRST AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document26    Filed08/21/08   Page11 of 15\n1  represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to \n2  concentrate all litigation in one forum because it will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the \n3  common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.   \n4  50.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all  of the class members.  Plaintiffs are \n5  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class m embers may be \n6  ascertained from records maintained by defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiffs \n7  are informed and believe, and thereupon allege,  that records maintained by defendants reflect \n8  who was subjected to transportation, from where to where, when, and for how long.  Plaintiffs \n9  are  informed  and believe, and thereupon allege ,  that all of the foregoing inform ation  is \n10  contained  in defendants’ records and that the inform ation  necessary to identify the class \n11  members, by last known addresses, and the dates,  pick-up and drop-off points, and duration of \n12  their transportation, is readily available from said records.   \n13  51.  In  accordance with Federal Rules of Ci vil  Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), class \n14  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \n15  individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are \n16  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that  defendants’ computer records contain a last \n17  known address for class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to \n18  class members at such last known address by first  class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the \n19  notice will inform class members of the following: \n20  i.  The pendency of the class action  and the issues com mon to the \n21  class; \n22  ii.  The nature of the action; \n23  iii.  Their right to “opt out” of the ac tion within a given time, in which \n24  event they will not be bound by a decision rendered in the class \n25  action; \n26  iv.  Their right, if they do not “opt out,” to be represented by their own \n27  counsel and to enter an appearance in the case; otherwise they will \n28  be represented by the named class plaintiffs and their counsel; and  \nSchilling v.

TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n1\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 2 of 15\n1  PLAINTIFFS COME BEFORE THIS HONORABLE COURT AND ALLEGE: \n2  INTRODUCTION \n3  1.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and punitive \n4  damages  against  TRANSCOR  AMERICA,  LLC,  SGT.  JOHN  SMITH,  OFFICER  JEFF \n5  BRUMMETT and DOES 1 THROUGH 100 (persons sued herein by their fictitious names) for \n6  violations of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights and those of other similarly situated persons.   \n7  2.  In this complaint, plaintiffs allege that TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s official \n8  policy, practice, or custom of transporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that \n9  amount to cruel and unusual punishment violated and violates the rights of plaintiffs, and each \n10  of those persons similarly situated, secured by the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments \n11  to the U.S. Constitution and entitles plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, to recover \n12  damages and attorneys’ fees under the Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988).  \n13  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s policies, practices or customs include but are not limited to \n14  transporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages in which a person can neither \n15  stand up nor lie down for more than 24 hours at a time while the person is handcuffed, chained, \n16  and in shackles, and failing to provide pretrial detainees and prisoners with adequate food, \n17  fluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care.    \n18  3.  Because TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s official policy, practice, or custom is \n19  to transport pretrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that amount to unlawful detention, \n20  excessive force, and cruel and unusual punishment, there is a likelihood of future injuries to \n21  pretrial  detainees  and  prisoners  including  members  of  the  plaintiff  class.    Accordingly, \n22  plaintiffs seek an order declaring unlawful TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s policy, practice or \n23  custom of transporting pretrial detainees under the conditions described above and enjoining \n24  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC from engaging in this conduct in the future. \n25  4.  Plaintiffs include claims for damages and attorneys’ fees under California state \n26  law  against  TRANSCOR  AMERICA,  LLC  for  violation  of  the  Bane  Civil  Rights  Act \n27  (California Civil Code § 52.1(b)) pursuant to which plaintiffs are, and each of those persons \n28  similarly situated in the subclass of pretrial detainees and prisoners transported by defendants \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n2\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 3 of 15\n1  in California is, entitled to recover a minimum of $4,000 for each violation of rights secured to \n2  them by the constitution or laws of the state of California and the constitution or laws of the \n3  United States and attorneys’ fees (California Civil Code § 52.1(h)). \n4  5.  Plaintiffs include claims for damages and attorneys’ fees under the Federal Civil \n5  Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988) against all defendants for their violation of plaintiffs’ \n6  Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force, and the \n7  right to be provided with adequate medical care.  \n8  6.  Finally, plaintiffs include a claim for damages and attorneys’ fees under the \n9  Federal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988) against TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC and \n10  DOES  1-10  for  its  failure  to  adequately  supervise  SGT.  SMITH,  OFFICER  JEFF \n11  BRUMMETT, and DOES 11 through 100. \n12 \n  JURISDICTION \n13 \n7.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Fourth, \n14 \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Jurisdiction is founded \n15 \nupon  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  and  1341(3)  and  (4)  and  the  aforementioned  statutory  and \n16 \nconstitutional provisions.   \n17 \n8.  The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ state claims under 28 \n18 \nU.S.C. § 1367(a). \n19 \n9.  The amount in controversy exceeds $10,000, excluding interest and costs. \n20 \n  PARTIES \n21 \n10.  Plaintiff KEVIN M. SCHILLING is a resident of Pleasant Hill, California.  Like \n22 \nall those similarly situated, plaintiff is and at all material times herein was a citizen of the \n23 \nUnited States who was arrested in one jurisdiction for an offense allegedly committed in \n24 \nanother jurisdiction and was transported from one detention facility to another detention facility \n25 \nby defendants. \n26 \n11.

Plaintiff WILLIAM TELLEZ is a citizen of the United States who was serving \n5  the sentence of a criminal court for a term less than for life in the Federal Penitentiary in \n6  Atwater,  California,  when  he  was  picked  up  and  transported  to  and  from  Clark  County \n7  Detention Center in Nevada by defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiff TELLEZ \n8  remained in prison from the time he was returned to the Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, \n9  California to the date of the filing of this complaint. \n10  13.  Defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC is and at all material times referred to \n11  herein was a for-profit Tennessee corporation licensed to do business in California whose \n12  business entails the transportation of pretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United \n13  States on behalf of federal, state, and local governments.    \n14  14.  Defendant  SGT.  JOHN  SMITH  is  an  agent  and/or  employee  of  defendant \n15  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n16  15.  Defendant  OFFICER  JEFF  BRUMMETT  is  an  agent  and/or  employee  of \n17  Defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n18  16.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that defendants sued \n19  herein  by  their  fictitious  names,  DOES  1  through  100,  are  agents  and/or  employees  of \n20  defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiffs are not currently aware of the true names \n21  and identities of those sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, but will amend their complaint to \n22  include such persons’ real names once said names are made available to them. \n23  17.  At all material times mentioned herein, each of the defendants was acting under \n24  the color of law, to wit, under color of statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies, customs and \n25  usages of the United States and its States, including but not limited to the State of California.  \n26  18.  Class  action  plaintiffs  are  all  those  similarly  situated  pretrial  detainees  and \n27  prisoners  who  were  transported  by  TRANSCOR  AMERICA,  LLC,  its  agents  and/or \n28  employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, whose claims are \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n4\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 5 of 15\n1  timely  under  California  law,  including  the  tolling  provisions  of  California  Code  of  Civil \n2  Procedure sections 352 and 352.1. \n3  19.  For purposes of the California Bane Act Claim, class action plaintiffs are all \n4  those similarly situated pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported in the State of \n5  California  by  TRANSCOR  AMERICA,  LLC,  its  agents  and/or  employees,  and  forced  to \n6  remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, whose claims are timely under California \n7  law, including the tolling provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 352 and \n8  352.1. \n9 \nFACTS \n10 \n20.  In  or  about  early  September,  2006,  plaintiff  KEVIN  M.  SCHILLING  was \n11 \narrested at his home in Vallejo, California on a no-bail warrant issued by a court in Las Vegas, \n12 \nNevada.    Plaintiff  was  booked  into  a  detention  facility  in  Fairfield,  California,  where  he \n13 \nremained for several days.    \n14 \n21.  On  or  about  September  25,  2006,  plaintiff  was  picked  up  at  the  Fairfield \n15 \nDetention facility by agents and/or employees of defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  \n16 \nBefore boarding the transport van, plaintiff was strip searched.  He was then handcuffed, a \n17 \nrestraint was applied that secured his hands to his waist, and he was shackled.  After boarding \n18 \nthe transport van, plaintiff was seated in a small, locked metal cage.   \n19 \n22.  For the next several days, plaintiff remained in the transport van, restrained as \n20 \ndescribed above, while the van meandered around California -- from Fairfield through counties \n21 \nwithin the Northern District of the United States District Court, to Fresno and then back, once \n22 \nagain, through counties within the Northern District of the United States District Court, to \n23 \nFairfield – picking up and dropping off pretrial detainees and/or prisoners.    \n24 \n23.  During his time in the transport van, plaintiff was provided with only two meals \n25 \na day which consisted of a fast food sandwich or hamburger and a cup of water.  Plaintiff was \n26 \nnot permitted to lie down or stand up or shower or shave or brush his teeth or change his \n27 \nclothes.  He was forced to use the on-board toilet at the defendants’ convenience.  Eventually, \n28 \nit backed up and smelled bad.  But for the steps from his cage to the toilet and back, he was \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n5\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 6 of 15\n1  allowed no physical activity. \n2  24.  When, after approximately four days of traveling in these conditions, plaintiff \n3  realized that the TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC transport van was headed back to Fairfield, he \n4  demanded to talk to the warden.  In response, and while he was still detained as described \n5  above, defendants SGT. JOHN SMITH and OFFICER JEFF BRUMMETT grabbed him and \n6  sprayed pepper spray in his face.  While plaintiff was still unable to see, SGT. JOHN SMITH \n7  purposely walked him into poles and, along with an unknown TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC \n8  employee, proceeded to punch him.  Although this occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m. outside \n9  the Fresno County Jail, plaintiff was not allowed to shower or change clothes or see a nurse or \n10  a doctor until approximately two days later when, after making numerous stops along the way, \n11  the transport van reached Imperial County Jail. \n12  25.  Plaintiff remained in the Imperial County Jail for approximately three days, after \n13  which time he was transported to Las Vegas.    \n14  26.  On or about June 29, 2006, at approximately 9:00 a.m., plaintiff JOHN PINEDO \n15  was picked up by defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, at Kern Valley State Prison in \n16  Delano, California where he was serving a sentence for possession and sale of marijuana, and \n17  transported to Santa Barbara County Jail where he arrived on June 30, 2006, more than 27 \n18  hours later for a child custody hearing.   \n19  27.  The entire time plaintiff PINEDO was on defendant TRANSCOR’s transport \n20  vehicle, he was handcuffed, shackled, and restrained with a belly chain and chained to other \n21  inmates in a metal cage, unable to lie down, or to sleep during the entire time of his transport.   \n22  28.  During his time in the transport van, plaintiff PINEDO was permitted only two \n23  opportunities to urinate but could not sit to use the toilet to defecate because the TRANSCOR \n24  personnel would not remove any of the restraints.   \n25  29.  During the entire time of his transport, plaintiff PINEDO was fed only three \n26  “fast food” meals, not permitted to wash, to shower, or to change his clothes, before being \n27  delivered to Santa Barbara County Jail. \n28  \\\\\\ \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n6\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 7 of 15\n1  30.  In  or  about  August  2005,  plaintiff  TELLEZ  was  serving  a  sentence  at  the \n2  Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, California, when he was first picked up for transport to Clark \n3  County Detention Center.  The trip on the TRANSCOR transport van took six (6) days, during \n4  which time several stops were made to pick up and discharge prisoners along the way.   \n5  31.  Plaintiff TELLEZ was manacled, shackled and handcuffed during the entire \n6  time of his transport.  He had limited access to toilet facilities, was not permitted to shower at \n7  any time during the six (6) day transport, and had only a restricted diet of “fast food” during the \n8  entire time on the transport van.   \n9  32.  Transported in a cage, manacled, shackled, and waist chained, he was unable to \n10  lie down and deprived of sleep during the entire time of the transport.   \n11  33.  Transported  by  TRANSCOR  back  to  Atwater  in  February  2006,  plaintiff \n12  TELLEZ was again subjected to the same abominable conditions he experienced on the initial \n13  trip from Atwater:  transport while handcuffed, shackled and waist chained the entire time in a \n14  small metal cage in which he was unable to lie down and deprived of sleep.   \n15  34.  Again, he was fed only a restricted diet of “fast food”, denied bathroom breaks, \n16  and never unshackled in order to use the toilet to defecate.   \n17  35.  Defendants TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC and SGT. SMITH and OFFICER \n18  JEFF BRUMMETT and DOES 1 through 100 are jointly and severally personally responsible \n19  for the unlawful conduct of which plaintiffs complain. \n20  36.  As a result of being subjected to the harsh transportation policies, practices, or \n21  customs described herein, plaintiffs, and all those similarly situated, have suffered physical, \n22  mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of due process of law and \n23  federal  and  state  statutory  and  constitutional  rights,  and  are  entitled  to  recover  damages \n24  according to proof, including exemplary damages. \n25 \nCLASS CLAIMS \n26 \n37.  The unlawful detention and transportation, use of excessive force, and cruel and \n27 \nunusual punishment to which plaintiffs and all those similarly situated were subjected was \n28 \nperformed pursuant to policies, practices, or customs of TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC and \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n7\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 8 of 15\n1  DOES 1-10.  The unlawful detention and transportation, use of excessive force, and cruel and \n2  unusual punishment complained of herein was engaged in without regard to the nature of the \n3  alleged offense for which plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, had been arrested, \n4  without regard to whether or not plaintiffs, and each of those similarly situated, had been \n5  convicted of any crime, and without regard to whether plaintiffs, and each of those similarly \n6  situated, had any history of violence.   \n7  38.  Plaintiffs bring this action on their own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n8  similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n9  39.  The class is defined to include all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were \n10  transported by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or employees, and forced to \n11  remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, whose claims are timely under California \n12  law, including the tolling provisions of California Code of Civil Procedure sections 352 and \n13  352.1. \n14  40.  The subclass for purposes of the Bane Act claims is all pretrial detainees and \n15  prisoners  transported  in  California  by  TRANSCOR  AMERICA,  LLC,  its  agents  and/or \n16  employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, whose claims are \n17  timely  under  California  law,  including  the  tolling  provisions  of  California  Code  of  Civil \n18  Procedure sections 352 and 352.1. \n19  41.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the members \n20  of the class are so numerous that joinder of all members is impractical.  Plaintiffs do not know \n21  the exact number of class members.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, \n22  that more than 30,000 persons per year are transported by defendants, and that most of the trips \n23  last more than 24 hours.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that there are \n24  thousands of persons in the proposed class. \n25  42.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n26  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many facts common to the class \n27  including but not limited to:  (a)  whether defendants have a policy, practice, or custom of \n28  transporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages, wearing handcuffs, shackles, \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n8\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 9 of 15\n1  and wrist restraints, for more than 24 hours at a time; (b)  whether defendants have a policy, \n2  practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees and prisoners with inadequate food; (c)  \n3  whether  defendants  have  a  policy,  practice  or  custom  of  providing  pretrial  detainees  and \n4  prisoners with inadequate fluids; (d)  whether defendants have a policy, practice or custom of \n5  providing pretrial detainees and prisoners with inadequate hygiene; (e) whether defendants \n6  have a policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees and prisoners with inadequate \n7  exercise; and (f)  whether defendants have a policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial \n8  detainees and prisoners with inadequate medical care. \n9  43.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiffs are \n10  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there are many questions of law common to \n11  the class including but are not limited to:  (a)  whether transporting pretrial detainees and \n12  prisoners in metal cages, wearing handcuffs, shackles, and wrist restraints, unable to lie down \n13  or stand up for more than 24 hours at a time, violates the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \n14  Amendments;  (b)    whether  defendants’  policy,  practice  or  custom  of  providing  pretrial \n15  detainees and prisoners with inadequate food violates pretrial detainees’ right to be free from \n16  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners’ right to be free from cruel and unusual \n17  punishment; (c)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n18  and  prisoners  with  inadequate  fluids  violates  pretrial  detainees’  right  to  be  free  from \n19  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners’ right to be free from cruel and unusual \n20  punishment; (d)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n21  and  prisoners  with  inadequate  hygiene  violates  pretrial  detainees’  right  to  be  free  from \n22  unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners’ right to be free from cruel and unusual \n23  punishment; (e)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial detainees \n24  with inadequate exercise violates pretrial detainees’ right to be free from unreasonable seizure \n25  and detention; and (f)  whether defendants’ policy, practice or custom of providing pretrial \n26  detainees and prisoners with inadequate medical care violates pretrial detainees’ right to be free \n27  from unreasonable seizure and detention and prisoners’ right to be free from cruel and unusual \n28  punishment. \nSchilling v. TransCor America, LLC, et al.     \n9\nSECOND AMENDED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT \n\n \nCase 3:08-cv-00941-SI   Document 83   Filed 10/19/09   Page 10 of 15\n1  44.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the claims of \n2  the representative plaintiffs are typical of the class.  Representative plaintiffs have the same \n3  interests and suffered the same type of injuries as all of the class members.  Plaintiffs’ claims \n4  arose because of defendants’ official policy, practice, or custom of subjecting detainees to \n5  unlawful transportation and detention, excessive force, and cruel and unusual punishment.  \n6  Plaintiffs’ claims are based upon the same legal theories as the claims of the class members.  \n7  Each  class  member  suffered  actual  damages  as  a  result  of  being  transported  under  the \n8  conditions imposed by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n9  45.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(a),  the \n10  representative  plaintiffs  will  fairly  and  adequately  protect  the  class  interests.    Plaintiffs’ \n11  interests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n12  46.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(A), \n13  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk that \n14  inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class would \n15  establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the class.   \n16  47.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(1)(B), \n17  prosecutions of separate actions by individual members of the class would create a risk of \n18  inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would, as a \n19  practical matter, substantially impair or impede the interests of the other members of the class \n20  to protect their interests. \n21  48.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs \n22  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  defendants  have  acted  on  grounds \n23  generally applicable to the class, thereby making appropriate the final injunctive or declaratory \n24  relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n25  49.  In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this class \n26  action is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable adjudication of the \n27  controversy between the parties.

Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the amounts at stake for \n3  individuals are so small that separate suits would be impracticable.  Plaintiffs are informed and \n4  believe, and thereupon allege, that most members of the class will not be able to find counsel to \n5  represent them.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is desirable to \n6  concentrate all litigation in one forum because it will promote judicial efficiency to resolve the \n7  common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in multiple courts.   \n8  50.  Plaintiffs do not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiffs are \n9  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the identities of the class members may be \n10  ascertained from records maintained by defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiffs \n11  are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that records maintained by defendants reflect \n12  who was subjected to transportation, from where to where, when, and for how long.  Plaintiffs \n13  are  informed  and  believe,  and  thereupon  allege,  that  all  of  the  foregoing  information  is \n14  contained  in  defendants’  records  and  that  the  information  necessary  to  identify  the  class \n15  members, by last known addresses, and the dates, pick-up and drop-off points, and duration of \n16  their transportation, is readily available from said records.   \n17  51.  In  accordance  with  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  Rule  23(b)(3),  class \n18  members must be furnished with the best notice practicable under the circumstances, including \n19  individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort.  Plaintiffs are \n20  informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that defendants’ computer records contain a last \n21  known address for class members.  Plaintiffs contemplate that individual notice will be given to \n22  class members at such last known address by first class mail.  Plaintiffs contemplate that the \n23  notice will inform class members of the following: \n24  i.  The pendency of the class action and the issues common to the \n25  class; \n26  ii.

That motion is currently scheduled\naarr\nttee\nSShh\nd d rtrt 16 for hearing on October 12, 2012.  Purs uant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court finds this matter\noo\nteteNN\nninie e  17 appropriate for resolution without oral argument and hereby VACATES the hearing.  Having considered\nUUhh\ntt\n  \nrr\noo 18 the papers submitted, and for good cause shown, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiffs’ motion.\nFF\n19 On August 8, 2012, the Court granted defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment as to\n20 the class claims asserted in this case. 1  In that Order, the Court found that as a m atter of law, the\n21\n1  In February, 2010, on plaintiffs’ motion, the Court certified the following classes:  \n22\n1. A class of all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor America\n23\nLLC, its agents and/or employees between February 14, 2006 and the present, and who were\nforced to remain in restraints in the transport vehicle for more than 24 hours without being\n24\nallowed to sleep overnight in a bed.  The class includes pretrial detainees and prisoners who\nwere removed from one transport vehicle and placed directl yonto another, without being housed\n25\novernight, whose combined trip lasted more than 24 hours.  The class only includes those\npretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor on behalf of a state agency,\n26\nand does not include pretrial detainees and prisonres who were transported on behalf of a federal\nagency.\n27\n2. A subclass of all pretrial detainees and  prisoners who were transported by TransCor\n28\nAmerica LLC, its agents and/or employees in the State of California between February 14, 2006\n\n1 conditions of confinement challenged by plaintiffs – in the context of transportation of prisoners, over\n2 a  period of   24 hours or m ore  – did not, on a cl ass-wide  basis and w ithout  more,  constitute\n3 unconstitutional deprivations under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.  Docket No. 205 at 15. \n4 A  month  later, plaintiffs m oved  to am end/correct  the Court’s Febr uary  16, 2010 class\n5 certification order pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(C).  Plaintiffs ask the Court to\n6 certify subclasses of plaintiffs “based on the number of days an inmate was continuously transported”\n7 by defendants and to add four subclass representatives.2  Defendants oppose that motion, arguing that\n8 plaintiffs should not – after having sum mary judgment denied based on the class definition they\n9 proposed – get a second bite at the apple.  Defendants argue that allowing amendment would severely\n10 prejudice defendants.\na\nni 11 The Court has considered the parties’ arguments and DENIES plaintiffs’ motion.  As an initial\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 matter, the Court is not convinced that the motion to amend should be considered pursuant to Rule 23.\noa\nCC\nct of  13 While Rule 23 provides that “[a]n order that grants  or denies class certification m ay be altered or\nrict \nisttri 14 amended before final judgment,” the 2003 Advisory Committee notes suggest that the Committee’s\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 concern in removing “decision on the merits” and substituting “before final judgment” was to allow\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 district courts flexibility to amend class definitions following a determination of liability.3  Here, there\no\nteN\nnie  17 was a determination of no liability for the class as defined by the Court on plaintiffs’ request.  While\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF\nand the present, and who were forced to remain in restraints in the transport vehicle for more\n19\nthan 24 hours without being allowed to sleep overnight in a bed.  The class includes pretrial\ndetainees and prisoners who were removed from one transport vehicle and placed directly onto\n20\nanother, without being housed overnight, whose combined trip lasted more than 24 hours.  The\nclass only includes those pretrial detainees andp risoners who were transported by TransCor on\n21\nbehalf of a sta te agency, and does not include  pretrial detainees and prisoners who were\ntransported on behalf of a federal agency.\n22\nFebruary 16, 2010 Order [Docket No. 110] at 18-19.\n23\n2  Plaintiffs did not provide the Court with exact descriptions of their proposed subclasses.  In\n24\nthe motion, plaintiffs propose subclasses for class members who were “on a vehicle in restraints for two,\nthree, four and more than four days.”  Motion  at 6.  In Reply, plaintiffs describe their proposed\n25\nsubclasses as follows: “inmates who were transportedf or more than one, two, three and four consecutive\ndays.”  Reply at 14.\n26\n3   See 2003 Advisory Committee Notes (“The authority to amend an order under Rule 23(c)(1)\n27\nbefore final judgment does not restore the practice of ‘one-way intervention’ that was rejected by the\n1966 revision of Rule 23. A determination of liability after certification, however, may show a need to\n28\namend the class definition. Decertification may be warranted after further proceedings.”\n2\n\n1 plaintiffs cite a number of cases in support of theri request to amend under Rule 23, none of those cases\n2 addresses the situation at issue here:  where the  district court had granted defendants’ m otion for\n3 summary judgment on plaintiffs’ class claims, and that decision had not been reversed by the appellate\n4 court.\n5 The Court recognizes its responsibility to continually review the appropriateness of a certified\n6 class in light of developments subsequent to class certification.  Here, however, the only relevant\n7 development was the Court’s determ ination that plaintiffs could not dem onstrate a constitutional\n8 violation on their claims as a class-wide matter.  This was not a situation where the evidence or facts\n9 adduced as the litigation progressed demonstrated that the class certified was in need of redefinition or\n10 decertification.  But see Richardson v. Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5th Cir. 1983) (“The definition of\na\nni 11 a class is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. Under Rule 23 the district court is charged with the\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 duty of monitoring its class decisions in light of the evidentiary development of the case. The district\noa\nCC\nct of  13 judge must define, redefine, subclass, and decertify as appropriate in response to the progression of the\nrict \nisttri 14 case from assertion to facts.”) (emphasis added).  The Court notes that plaintiffs wholly failed to argue\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 or provide evidence on either their motion or defendants’ motion for summary judgment, that subclass\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 differentiation might be appropriate.  For example, plaintiffs’ experts stated only that the conditions\no\nteN\nnie  17 challenged by plaintiffs violated each class members’ rights at the 24 hours plus one m inute period.\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 There was no evidence or expert opinion that the C ourt could rely on t o, for example, find that a\nF\n19 constitutional violation had been demonstrated for class members who were subject to the complained\n20 of conditions for other periods of time, such as two or more days. \n21 In their Reply, plaintiffs contend that amendment is also appropriate under Rule 15(a).  In\n22 determining whether to grant leave to amend under Rule 15(a), the Court should consider various\n23 factors, including undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure\n24 to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue\n25 of allowance of the amendment, and futility of amendment.  See Eminence Capital, LLC v. Aspeon, Inc.,\n26\n316 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2003).  The “consideratoin of prejudice to the opposing party,” however,\n27\ncarries the greatest weight.  Id.  Moreover, it is important to recognize that summary judgment has been\n28\nentered against plaintiffs on their class claims.  As the Ninth Circuit has recognized, in a case relied\n3\n\n1 heavily on by plaintiffs:\n2 ‘[A] court ordinarily will be reluctant to allow leave to amend to a party against whom summary\njudgment has been entered . . . .’ C. W right, A. Miller & M. Kane, Federal Practice and\n3 Procedure § 2712 (2d ed. 1983). We note that\n4 much of the value of sum mary judgment procedure in the cases for which it is\nappropriate . . . would be dissipated if a pa rty were free to rely on one  theory in an\n5 attempt to defeat a motion for summary judgment and then, should that theory prove\nunsound, come back long thereafter and fight on the basis of some other theory.\n6\nNguyen v. United States, 792 F.2d 1500, 1503 (9th Cir. 1986) (quotingF reeman v. Continental Gin Co.,\n7\n381 F.2d 459, 469-70 (5th Cir. 1967).4  \n8\nThe potential need to distinguish among subclasses should have been clear since the inception\n9\nof this case.  The fact that theim  pact of the conditions-of-confinement complained of changes over time\n10\na is obvious; this is likely why plaintiffs suggested a class cons isting of  inmates subjected to these\nni 11\nr\nto conditions for 24 hours, and not, for example, 18 or 20 hours.  As defendants point out, plaintiffs have\nrf\nuli 12\noa\nCC had discovery in their possession since 2009 showing the duration of the trips for each class member.\nct of  13\nrict  Plaintiffs made a strategic decision to seek class-wide relief for one class of all inmates transported for\nstri 14\nit\nDs\n Di 24 hours or more.  The Court is wary of allowing amendment at this juncture simply because plaintiffs’\ns\nten  15\nar\nte strategy did not work.\nSh\nd rt 16\no\nteN More importantly, the Court finds that defendant will suffer prejudice if the Court were allow\nnie  17\nUh\nt plaintiffs to amend the class definition and add four new subclass representatives.  Defendants would\n \nr\no 18\nF\nneed to redepose all the individual plaintiffs previously deposed, to delve into how the length of their\n19\nvarious transports impacted them and whether a serious deprivation of a basic life necessity occurred\n20\nat a particular point during each of their transports.  Moreover,  expert disclosures and reports occurred\n21\non April 6, 2012 and rebuttal reports were disclosed May 4, 2012.  If amendment were allowed, the\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26 4  In Nguyen, because the district court did not follow the Ninth Circuit’s i nitial mandate\ndirecting entry of summary judgment for defendants – but instead allowed pl aintiffs to amend – the\n27\nNinth Circuit remanded the case to district court for a second time, directing that summary judgment\nbe entered for defendant and directnig the district court to “reconsider” its prior order granting plaintiffs\n28\nleave to amend. \n4\n\n1 parties would have to am end their expert reports, if not the designations of experts them selves.5\n2 Plaintiffs, in particular, would have to secure new or additional expert opinions on when the conditions\n3 complained of amount – over the course of time – to unconstitutional deprivations, since those opinions\n4 were missing from plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment and opposition to defendants’\n5 motion for partial summary judgment.  \n6 In these circumstances, in litigation that has been pending since 2008 and is just over four\n7 months from trial, it is not appropriate to allowu frther amendment.  For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n8 hereby DENIES plaintiffs’ motion to amend.6\n9\n10 IT IS SO ORDERED.\na\nni 11\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Dated: October 11, 2012                                                        \noa\nCC SUSAN ILLSTON\nct of  13 United States District Judge\nrict \nstri 14\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16\no\nteN\nnie  17\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n5  While the parties agreed to extend the deadline to depose the parties’ experts until 60 days\n25\nbefore trial, that does not obviate the need t o prepare new opinions and reports addressing how the\nlength of time inmates are subject to the challenged conditions impacts those inmates.\n26\n6  Defendants have admitted that the claims of individuals who were continuously transported\n27\nfor more than 24 hours and one m inute survive the Court’s m otion for summary judgment.  See\nDefendants’ Opposition at 14, n. 9.  Those individuals, therefore, are presumably free to file an action\n28\non their own behalf or on behalf of a class of those similarly situated.  \n5",

Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court determines that the matters are appropriate for resolu-\ntion without oral argument, and VACATES the hearing. For the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES defendants' \nmotion to transfer venue, and GRANTS plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. \n \nBACKGROUND  \nOn February 14, 2008, plaintiff Kevin Schilling filed this lawsuit against TransCor America, LLC (\"TransCor\"), \nSergeant John Smith, \"Officer Blanden,\" and Does 1-100. 1 On August 21, 2008, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint \n\n \nadding two additional named plaintiffs, John Pinedo and William Tellez, and correcting a typographical error. The \namended complaint alleges that TransCor is a for-profit Tennessee corporation licensed to do business in California \nwhose business entails the transportation of pretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United States on behalf of \nfederal, state and local governments. First  [*3] Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") P 13. The complaint also alleges that at \nall material times, each of the defendants was acting under color of state and federal law. Id. P 17. \n \n1   The complaint incorrectly named defendant Jeff Brummett as Officer Blanden. Plaintiffs' motion to amend \nthe complaint seeks to correct this error, and defendants have no objection to this amendment. This order will re-\nfer to defendant by his correct name, Brummett. \nThe FAC alleges that TransCor transports pretrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that amount to cruel and \nunusual punishment. The FAC alleges that TransCor's policies, practices or customs include but are not limited to trans-\nporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages in which a person can neither stand up nor lie down, for \nmore than 24 hours at a time, while the person is handcuffed, chained, and in shackles, and failing to provide pretrial \ndetainees and prisoners with adequate food, fluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care. Id. P 2. According to the FAC, \nplaintiff Schilling was picked up at a detention facility in Fairfield, California, by agents and/or employees of TransCor. \nId. P 21. The complaint alleges that Schilling was strip  [*4] searched before boarding the transport van, and that he \n\"was then handcuffed, a restraint was applied that secured his hands to his waist, and he was shackled. After boarding \nthe transport van, plaintiff was seated on a metal bench in a small, locked metal cage in which it was impossible for him \nto stand up or sit down.\" Id. The complaint alleges that for the next several days, plaintiff remained in the transport van, \nrestrained and shackled in the metal cage, while the van \"meandered around California - from Fairfield through counties \nwithin the Northern District of the United States Court and then back, once again through counties within the Northern \nDistrict of the United States District Court, to Fairfield - picking up and dropping off pretrial detainees and/or prison-\ners.\" Id. P 22. Plaintiff Schilling alleges that during the time in the transport van, he was provided with only two meals \nper day; he was not permitted to lie down, stand up, bathe, shave, brush his teeth or change his clothes; he was forced to \nuse the on-board toilet at defendants' convenience; and aside from the steps from his cage to the toilet and back, he was \nallowed no physical activity. Id. P 23. The FAC also  [*5] alleges that after being in the van for several days, Schilling \nrealized that the van was headed back to Fairfield and he demanded to speak to the warden. Id. P 24. The complaint \nalleges that in response, and while he was detained as described above, defendants Brummett and Smith grabbed him, \nsprayed pepper spray in his face, purposely walked him into poles, and along with an unknown TransCor employee, \npunched him. Id. Plaintiff alleges that he was not allowed to see a doctor or a nurse until the transport van reached Im-\nperial County Jail. Id. \nThe FAC alleges that plaintiff Pinedo was picked up by TransCor at Kern Valley State Prison in Delano, California, \nand transported to Santa Barbara County Jail. Id. P 26. The FAC alleges that the trip took more than 27 hours, and that \nduring the entire time Pinedo was in TransCor's vehicle, he was handcuffed, shackled, and restrained with a belly chain \nand chained to other inmates in a metal cage, unable to lie down or sleep during the entire time of his transport. Id. P 27. \nThe FAC also alleges that Pinedo was permitted only two opportunities to urinate, but could not sit to use the toilet to \ndefecate because TransCor personnel would not remove  [*6] any of the restraints. Id. P 28. Pinedo also alleges that he \nwas fed only three \"fast food\" meals, and not permitted to wash, shower or change his clothes before being delivered to \nSanta Barbara County Jail. Id. P 29. \nThe FAC alleges that plaintiff Tellez was picked up by TransCor at the Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, California. \nId. P 30. Tellez was transported to Clark County Detention Center in a trip that took six days, and then approximately \nsix months later, TransCor transported Tellez from Clark County Detention Center back to Atwater, California. Id. P 33. \nThe FAC alleges that Tellez experienced conditions similar to those experienced by Schilling and Pinedo. Id. PP 30-33. \nPlaintiffs filed this action on behalf of a class consisting of \"all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were trans-\nported by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for \nmore than 24 hours, from two years preceding the filing of this Complaint to the date this case is resolved.\" Id. P 39. \nThe complaint also alleges a similar subclass of all pretrial detainees and prisoners transported in California. Id. P 40. \nThe complaint alleges claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983  [*7] for violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments to the U.S. Constitution, and the California State Bane Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief, as well as monetary damages. \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \n\n \nI. Defendants' motion to transfer venue  \nDefendants move to transfer venue to the Middle District of Tennessee, or alternatively to the Eastern District of \nCalifornia. Defendants contend that transfer is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) because a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred in Tennessee, where TransCor is headquartered and thus where the \nTransCor policies and procedures were developed, or the Eastern District of California, because a large portion of the \nroute that plaintiff Schilling traveled on when he was transported from Fairfield, California to Las Vegas, Nevada, is in \nthe Eastern District. Alternatively, defendants contend that venue should be transferred to Tennessee pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1404(a) because it is more convenient for the parties and witnesses. \n \nA. 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a)  \nIn general, venue is covered by 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Under 29 U.S.C. 1391(b), where federal subject matter jurisdic-\ntion is not based  [*8] solely on diversity of citizenship, venue is proper in the following districts: (1) a judicial district \nwhere any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State; (2) a judicial district in which a \"substantial part \nof the events or omissions\" giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \"substantial part of the property\" that is the subject of \nthe action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought, a judicial district in \nwhich any defendant may be found. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Here, the defendants do not all reside in the same state, 2 and \nthere are districts in which the action may be brought, and thus the question is whether a \"substantial part of the events \nor omissions\" giving rise to plaintiffs' claims occurred in this district. \n \n2   Defendants Brummett and Smith reside in Oklahoma. \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs contend that defendants have waived an improper venue defense because Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) provides that any motion asserting the defense of improper venue must be made before \npleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. Plaintiffs note that TransCor filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \n12(b)  [*9] in 2008, and that it has since appeared at three different case management conferences and has represented \nin case management conference statements that \"there are no issues regarding personal jurisdiction or venue.\" TransCor \nargues that it has not waived a venue challenge because it was only recently that TransCor's counsel learned that plain-\ntiff Schilling's transport only traveled into the Northern District momentarily. Defendants also argue that defendants \nSmith and Brummett were only recently served with the complaint, and that these defendants preserved their venue ob-\njection by asserting it in their answer and by filing the instant motion. \nThe Court finds that defendants Smith and Brummett have not waived their venue objection since these defendants \nwere only recently served and have raised improper venue in their answer. Given the procedural history of this case and \nthe fact that this action has been pending since February 2008, it is a much closer call as to whether TransCor has \nwaived its right to challenge venue. However, because all defendants raise identical arguments regarding venue, the \nCourt will consider the motion as to all defendants. \nThe events or omissions on which  [*10] plaintiffs' claims are based occurred in several judicial districts, including \nthe Northern and Eastern Districts of California, Nevada, and Tennessee. Section 1391(b) \"do[es] not require that a ma-\njority of the 'events or omissions' occur in the district where suit is filed; nor that the events there predominate. It is suf-\nficient that a 'substantial part' occur there.\" Schwarzer, Tashima & Wagstaffe, Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, P \n4:316 (2009). The \"substantiality\" requirement is \"intended to preserve the element of fairness so that a defendant is not \nhaled into a remote district having no real relationship to the dispute.\" Cottman Transmission Systems, Inc. v. Martino, \n36 F.3d 291, 294 (3d Cir. 1994). \nThe parties dispute how much of plaintiff Schilling's transport route went through the Northern District versus the \nEastern District. 3 The Court finds it unnecessary to resolve this factual question -- which in any event cannot be conclu-\nsively determined upon this record -- because it is undisputed that at least some portion of Schilling's route was in the \nNorthern District. In addition, plaintiffs assert, and defendants do not deny, that discovery has revealed that during the  \n[*11] class period TransCor had contracts with seven law enforcement agencies in the Northern District to transport \nprisoners and pretrial detainees. In contrast, TransCor has closed the Fresno \"hub,\" and TransCor did not have any con-\ntracts to transport prisoner and pretrial detainees in the Middle District of Tennessee. Thus, it is likely that putative class \nmembers were transported throughout the Northern District of California. The Court concludes that based upon these \nfacts, venue is proper in this District. Moreover, any suggestion by defendants that litigating in this District is unfair or \nburdensome is undercut by their willingness to litigate in the Eastern District, which is equally remote from either Okla-\nhoma, where the individual defendants reside, or Tennessee, where TransCor is headquartered. \n\n \n \n3   The parties do not discuss the other named plaintiffs' transport routes. \n \nB. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)  \n\"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil matter \nto any other district or division where it might have been brought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). The purpose of § 1404(a) is to \n\"prevent the waste of time, energy, and money and to  [*12] protect litigants, witnesses and the public against unneces-\nsary inconvenience and expense.\" Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616, 84 S. Ct. 805, 11 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1964) (in-\nternal citations and quotation omitted). A motion for transfer lies within the broad discretion of the district court, and \nmust be determined on an individualized basis. See Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc., 211 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000). \nTo support a motion for transfer, the moving party must establish: (1) that venue is proper in the transferor district; \n(2) that the transferee district is one where the action might have been brought; and (3) that the transfer will serve the \nconvenience of the parties and witnesses, and will promote the interests of justice. See Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 820 F. Supp. 503, 506 (C.D. Cal. 1992). A motion for transfer lies within the broad discre-\ntion of the district court, and must be determined on an individualized basis. See Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc., 211 \nF.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000). \nDefendants contend that the Middle District of Tennessee is more convenient because TransCor witnesses and \ndocuments are located there. However, given the procedural posture of this case, the  [*13] Court finds that transfer \nwould be both inefficient and not in the interest of justice. This case has been pending since February 2008, the parties \nhave engaged in motion practice, and the Court has held three case management conferences. Under the current pretrial \nschedule, plaintiffs are scheduled to file a motion for class certification in December 2009, and the Court will hold a \nhearing on the motion in February 2010. According to plaintiffs' counsel, document discovery is virtually complete, and \nthe parties have cooperated to schedule depositions at convenient times and places, including in Tennessee and Okla-\nhoma. Thus, the only inconvenience to non-California witnesses will be if they are required to testify at trial. Given de-\nfendants' willingness to litigate in the Eastern District of California, any incremental inconvenience caused by traveling \nto the Northern District is marginal at best. \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES defendants' motion to transfer venue. \n \nII. Plaintiffs' motion to file second amended complaint  \nPlaintiffs seek to amend the complaint in several ways. Plaintiffs seek to correct the name of defendant Brummett, \nand to change the place of plaintiff Schilling's residence  [*14] as well as the date of his transport. Plaintiffs also wish to \namend the definition of the class to include pretrial detainees and prisoners whose claims were timely as of February 14, \n2006, despite having accrued more than two years before plaintiffs filed their original complaint, based on the tolling \nprovisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 352 (limitations period tolled due to the disability of minority \nor insanity) or 352.1 (limitations period tolled for a maximum of two years due to the disability of imprisonment). Fi-\nnally, plaintiffs wish to allege with additional particularity the facts showing that the tolling provisions of California \nCode of Civil Procedure section 352.1 apply to plaintiff Tellez. Defendants only oppose the proposed amendment to the \nclass definition. \nPlaintiffs state that through pre-class certification discovery they have learned that a substantial number of the pris-\noners and detainees transported by TransCor were juveniles and state hospital inmates. Plaintiffs state that in preparing \nto move for class certification, it has come to their attention that the complaint unintentionally excludes potential class \nmembers with timely claims. Plaintiffs  [*15] argue that there is no prejudice to defendants because the additional class \nmembers have the same claims as the original class, and that the proposed amendment does not affect the schedule for \nfiling and hearing the motion for class certification. \nDefendants oppose amending the class definition on several grounds. First, defendants argue that plaintiffs have un-\nreasonably delayed in seeking the current amendment, and they emphasize that plaintiffs have long known through dis-\ncovery that TransCor transported juveniles and state hospital inmates. However, delay alone is not a basis for denying \nleave to amend. See Owens v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712-713 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"Assuming \narguendo that Kaiser had unreasonably delayed the filing of the motion to amend its answer, undue delay by itself is \ninsufficient to justify denying a motion to amend.\") (internal citation and quotation omitted). Moreover, while defen-\ndants assert that the delay is unjustified, there is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of plaintiffs. \n\n \nDefendants also contend that the revised class definition will cause them prejudice because discovery has been lim-\nited to the class period alleged in  [*16] the complaint -- February 14, 2006 to February 14, 2008 -- and extending the \nclass period may require that eight witnesses will have to be re-deposed to ascertain if TransCor's policies and proce-\ndures were different prior to February 14, 2006. Defendants also assert that they will be required to \"scour\" through \nliterally thousands of pages of documents a second time if the class period is expanded. However, as plaintiffs note, \ndefendants have not offered any evidence in support of their speculation that the witnesses identified by defendants -- \nall of whom are TransCor employees - would need to be re-deposed. Plaintiffs argue that if any witness needs to be re-\ndeposed, that burden falls on plaintiffs, not defendants. Moreover, plaintiffs state that they believe there will be little if \nany additional discovery required. Plaintiffs have submitted the deposition testimony of Sondra Pedrigo, who was des-\nignated by defendants as the \"person most knowledgeable about any and all policies and procedures of TransCor relat-\ning to transportation of prisoners,\" \"the nutrition provided to prisoners during transportation,\" \"prisoner complaints,\" \netc., and who has worked for TransCor for eleven years.  [*17] See Snell Reply Decl. Ex. A. During her testimony, Ms. \nPedrigo testified about certain practices that have been in place since at least 2001 (such as use of black boxes over \nhandcuffs), and she gave no indication that TransCor's policies and practices had changed in material ways over the \nyears. If, in fact, there are material differences pre- and post- February 2006 with regard to TransCor's policies and pro-\ncedures, defendants can easily ascertain that fact because Ms. Pedrigo is a TransCor employee. With regard to docu-\nment discovery, plaintiffs state that in August 2008, plaintiffs requested transport records from TransCor's computer \nsystem dating back to February 2004, and that plaintiffs do not anticipate requiring any discovery other than that already \nserved or noticed prior to filing the class certification motion. \nDefendants also argue that the proposed amendment would be futile because the additional class members will be \ndifficult to identify, and individual tolling-issue inquiries will predominate over common questions. However, as defen-\ndants recognize in their opposition, those are questions for class certification, and the Court finds it premature to resolve \nthose questions  [*18] at this stage. Defendants may renew those arguments in opposition to class certification. \nFinally, the parties dispute whether the proposed amended class definition should relate back to the original com-\nplaint. Defendants argue that the amendment should not relate back because the claims of the additional class members \narise out of different transports in a different time period. Defendants also assert that the original complaint only gave \nthem notice that plaintiffs were challenging TransCor's policies and procedures from February 2006 to February 2008. \nThese arguments are not persuasive. While the additional class members' claims would arise from an earlier time pe-\nriod, the claims are substantively similar to those of the existing putative class, and defendants have not identified any \nmeaningful difference between the pre- and post- February 2006 class members. See Immigrant Assistance Project of \nthe Los Angeles County Federation of Labor v. INS, 306 F.3d 842, 858 (9th Cir. 2002) (addition of new plaintiffs who \nwere similarly situated to original plaintiffs did not prejudice defendants, claims related back). In addition, since the \nfiling of the FAC in August 2008, defendants have  [*19] been aware that plaintiff Tellez's claims arose in August 2005, \nprior to the asserted class period. See FAC PP 30-34 (alleging that Tellez was incarcerated at Federal Penitentiary in \nAtwater, California, and that transports occurred in August 2005 and February 2006). \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES defendants' motion to transfer venue and GRANTS plaintiffs' motion \nto file a second amended complaint. (Docket Nos. 69, 70). Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint no later than Octo-\nber 19, 2009 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: October 14, 2009 \n/s/ Susan Illston \nSUSAN ILLSTON \nUnited States District Judge \n ",

This  is an action for declarato ry  and injunctive relief, damages, and \n2 \npunitive  damages against TRANSCOR AM ERICA,  LLC, SGT. JOHN SMITH, \n3 \nOFFICER BLANDEN and DOES 1 THROUGH 100  (persons sued herein by their \n4 \nfictitious  names) for violations of plainti ff’s  constitutional rights and those of other \n5 \nsimilarly situated persons.   \n6 \n2.  In  this complaint, plaintiff all eges  that TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s \n7 \nofficial policy, practice, or  custom of transporting pretri al detainees and prisoners in \n8 \nconditions that amount to cruel and unusual  punishment violated and violates the \n9 \nrights of plaintiff, and each of those persons  similarly situated, secured by the Fourth, \n10 \nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and entitles plaintiff, and \n11 \neach of those similarly situated, to reco ver damages and attorneys’ fees under the \n12 \nFederal Civil Rights Act (42  U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988).  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s \n13  policies,  practices or customs include but  are  not limited to transporting pretrial \n14  detainees and prisoners in small metal cages  in which a person can neither stand up \n15  nor lie down for more than 24 hours at a time while the person is handcuffed, chained, \n16  and in shackles, and failing to provide  pretrial detainees and prisoners with adequate \nfood, fluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care.    \n17 \n3.  Because  TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC’s   official policy, practice, or \n18 \ncustom is to transport pretrial detainees  and prisoners in conditions that amount to \n19 \nunlawful detention, excessive force, and  cruel and unusual punishment, there is a \n20 \nlikelihood of future injuries to pretrial detainees and prisoners including members of the \n21 \nplaintiff class.  Accordingl y, plaintiff seeks an order declaring unlawful TRANSCOR \n22 \nAMERICA, LLC’s policy, practice or custom of transporting pretrial detainees under the \n23 \nconditions described above and enjoining TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC from engaging \n24 \nin this conduct in the future. \n25 \n4.  Plaintiff includes claims for damages and attorneys’ fees under California \n26 \nstate law against TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC  for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights \n27 \nAct (California Civil Code § 52.1(b)) pursuant  to which plaintiff is, and each of those \n28 \npersons  similarly situated in the subc lass  of pretrial  detainees  and prisoners \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiff  includes claims for dam ages  and attorneys’ fees under the \n5 \nFederal Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983,  1988) against all defendants for their \n6 \nviolation of his Fourth and  Fourteenth Amendment right to  be free from the use of \n7 \nexcessive force, and the right to be provided with adequate medical care.  \n8 \n6.  Finally, plaintiff includes a clai m for damages and attorneys’ fees under \n9 \nthe  Federal Civil Rights  Act  (42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1988) against TRANSCOR \n10 \nAMERICA, LLC and DOES 1-10 fo r its failure to adequately supervise SGT.

This action is brought pursuant  to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the \n14 \nFourth,  Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to  the  United States Constitution.   \n15 \nJurisdiction  is founded upon 28 U.S.C.   §§ 1331 and 1341(3) and (4) and the \n16 \naforementioned statutory and constitutional provisions.   \n17 \n7.    The court has supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiff’s state claims under \n18 \n28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \n19 \n8.    The  amount in controversy exc eeds  $10,000, excluding interest and \n20 \ncosts. \n21    PARTIES \n22  9.    Plaintiff KEVIN M. SCHILLING is a resident of Vallejo, California.  Like all \n23  those similarly situated, plaintiff is and at a ll material times herein was a citizen of the \n24  United States who was arrested in one juri sdiction for an offense allegedly committed \nin  another jurisdiction and was transport ed  from one detention facility to another \n25 \ndetention facility by defendants. \n26 \n10.

Defendant SGT. JOHN SMITH is an agent and/or employee of defendant \n3 \nTRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n4 \n12.   Defendant  OFFICER  BLANDEN  is  an agent and/or employee of \n5 \nDefendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n6 \n13.   Plaintiff is informed and belie ves and thereon alleges that defendants \n7 \nsued  herein by their fict itious  names, DOES 1 through 100, are agents and/or \n8 \nemployees of defendant TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.  Plaintiff is not currently aware \n9 \nof the true names and identities of those sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, but will \n10 \namend his complaint to include such persons ’ real names once said names are made \n11 \navailable to him. \n12 \n14.   At  all material times menti oned  herein, each of  the  defendants was \n13 \nacting under the color of law, to wit, under co lor of statutes, ordinances, regulations, \n14  policies, customs and usages of  the United States and its  States, including but not \n15  limited to the State of California.  \n16  15.   Class action plaintiffs are all those  similarly situated pretrial detainees \n17  and prisoners who were transported by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or \nemployees, and forced to remain in the tr ansport van for more than 24 hours, within \n18 \nthe  two years preceding the filing of this   Complaint and the date this matter is \n19 \nresolved.   \n20 \n16.   For purposes of the California Unruh Act Claim, class action plaintiffs are \n21 \nall those similarly situated pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported in the \n22 \nState of California by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or employees, and \n23 \nforced to remain in the transport van fo r more than 24 hours, within the two years \n24 \npreceding the filing of this Complaint and the date this matter is resolved. \n25 \nFACTS \n26 \n18.   In or about early September, 2006, plaintiff KEVIN M. SCHILLING was  \n27 \narrested at his home in Vallejo, California on a no-bail warrant issued by a court in Las \n28 \nVegas, Nevada.  Plaintiff was booked into a det ention facility in Fair field, California, \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N. California Blvd., \nSuite 1020 \nWalnut Creek, CA  94596  Schilling v.

On or about September 22, 2006, plaintiff was picked up at the Fairfield  \nDetention facility by agents  and/or employees of defend ant TRANSCOR AMERICA, \n3 \nLLC.  Before boarding the transport van, plai ntiff was strip searched.  He was then \n4 \nhandcuffed, a restraint was applied that se cured his hands to his waist, and he was \n5 \nshackled.  After boarding the transport van, pl aintiff was seated on a metal bench in a \n6 \nsmall, locked metal cage in which it was impossible for him to stand up or lie down.   \n7 \n20.   For  the next several days, plaint iff  remained in the transport van, \n8 \nrestrained as described above, while t he van meandered around California -- from \n9 \nFairfield  through counties within the Northern  District  of the United States District \n10 \nCourt, to Fresno and then back, once agai n through counties within the Northern \n11 \nDistrict of the United States District Cour t, to Fairfield – picking up and dropping off \n12 \npretrial detainees and/or prisoners.    \n13 \n21.   During his time in the transport v an, plaintiff was provided with only two \n14  meals a day, which consisted of a fast  food sandwich or hambur ger and a cup of \n15  water.  Plaintiff was not permitted to lie dow n or stand up or shower or shave or brush \n16  his teeth or change his clot hes.  He was forced to use the on-board toilet at the \n17  defendants’ convenience.  Eventually, it backed up and smelled bad.  But for the steps \nfrom his cage to the toilet and back, he was allowed no physical activity. \n18 \n22.   When,  after approximately four da ys  of traveling in these conditions, \n19 \nplaintiff realized that the TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC transport van was headed back \n20 \nto Fairfield, he demanded to talk to the wa rden.  In response, and while he was still \n21 \ndetained  as described above, defendant s  SGT. JOHN SMITH and OFFICER \n22 \nBLANDEN grabbed him and sprayed pepper spray in  his face.  While plaintiff was still \n23 \nunable to see, SGT. JOHN SMITH purposely walked him into poles and, along with an \n24 \nunknown TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC employee, proceeded to punch him.  Although \n25 \nthis occurred at approximately 3:00 a.m. out side the Fresno County Jail, plaintiff was \n26 \nnot allowed to shower or change clothes or see a nurse or a doctor until approximately \n27 \ntwo days later when, after making numerous  stops along the way, the transport van \n28 \nreached Imperial County Jail. \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

Plaintiff  remained in the Imper ial  County Jail for approximately three \n2  days, after which time he was transported to Las Vegas.    \n24.   Defendants  TRANSCOR AMER ICA,  LLC and SGT. SMITH and \n3 \nOFFICER BLANDEN and DOES 1 through 100 ar e jointly and severally personally \n4 \nresponsible for the unlawful conduct of which plaintiff complains. \n5 \n25.   As  a result of being subjected  to  the harsh transportation policies, \n6 \npractices, or customs described herein, plaintiff, and all those similarly situated, have \n7 \nsuffered physical, mental, and emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and violation of \n8 \ndue process of law and federal and state stat utory and constitutional rights, and are \n9 \nentitled to recover damages according to proof, including exemplary damages. \n10 \nCLASS CLAIMS \n11 \n26.   The unlawful detention and transporta tion, use of excessive force, and \n12 \ncruel and unusual punishment to which plainti ff and all those similarly situated were \n13 \nsubjected was performed pursuant to policies,  practices, or customs of TRANSCOR \n14  AMERICA, LLC and DOES 1-10.  The unlawfu l detention and transpo rtation, use of \n15  excessive  force, and cruel and unusual puni shment  complained of herein was \n16  engaged in without regard to the  nature of the alleged offens e for which plaintiff, and \n17  each of those similarly sit uated, had been arrested, without  regard to whether or not \nplaintiff, and each of those similarly sit uated, had been convicted  of any crime, and \n18 \nwithout regard to whether plaintiff, and each of those similarly situated, had any history \n19 \nof violence.   \n20 \n27.   Plaintiff brings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons \n21 \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \n22 \n28.   The class is defined to include a ll pretrial detainees and prisoners who \n23 \nwere transported by TRANSCOR AMERICA,  LLC, its agents and/or employees, and \n24 \nforced to remain in the transport van for more than 24 hours, from two years preceding \n25 \nthe filing of this Complaint to the date this matter is resolved.   \n26 \n29.

In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure,  Rule 23(a), the \n3 \nmembers of the class are so numerous that  joinder of all members is impractical.   \n4 \nPlaintiff does not know the exact number of  class members.  Plaintiff is informed and \n5 \nbelieves,  and thereupon alleges, that mo re  than 30,000 persons per year are \n6 \ntransported by defendants, and that most of the trips last more than 24 hours.  Plaintiff \n7 \nis informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that there are thousands of persons in \n8 \nthe proposed class. \n9 \n31.   In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n10 \nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that there are many facts common to \n11 \nthe class including but not limited to:  (a)  whether defendants have a policy, practice, \n12 \nor  custom of transporting pretrial detai nees  and prisoners in small metal cages, \n13 \nwearing handcuffs, shackles, and wrist restraints, for more than 24 hours at a time; (b)  \n14  whether defendants have a policy,  practice or custom of pr oviding pretrial detainees \n15  and prisoners with inadequate food; (c)  whether defendants have a policy, practice or \n16  custom  of providing pretrial detainees   and prisoners with inadequate fluids; (d)   \n17  whether defendants have a policy,  practice or custom of pr oviding pretrial detainees \nand prisoners with inadequate hygiene; (e) whether defendants have a policy, practice \n18 \nor custom of providing pretrial detainees and prisoners with inadequate exercise; and \n19 \n(f)   whether defendants have a policy, practi ce  or custom of  providing  pretrial \n20 \ndetainees and prisoners with inadequate medical care. \n21 \n32.   In accordance with Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), plaintiff \n22 \nis informed and believes, and thereupon alleges,  that there are many questions of law \n23 \ncommon to the class including but are not limit ed to:  (a)  whether transporting pretrial \n24 \ndetainees  and prisoners in metal cages, w earing  handcuffs, shackles, and wrist \n25 \nrestraints, unable to lie down or stand up for more than 24 hours at a time, violates the \n26 \nFourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments; (b)  whether defendants’ policy, practice \n27 \nor custom of providing pr etrial detainees and prisoners  with inadequate food violates \n28 \npretrial  detainees’ right to be free fr om  unreasonable seizure and detention and \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure,  Rule 23(a), the \n14  claims of the representative plaintiff are typi cal of the class.  R epresentative plaintiff \n15  has the same interests and suffered the same  type of injuries as all of the class \n16  members.  Plaintiff’s claims arose because  of defendants’ official policy, practice, or \n17  custom of subjecting detainees to unlawfu l transportation and detention, excessive \nforce, and cruel and unusual punishment.  Plai ntiff’s claims are based upon the same \n18 \nlegal theories as the claims of the class members.  Each class member suffered actual \n19 \ndamages  as a result of being transpor ted  under the conditions imposed by \n20 \nTRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC.   \n21 \n34.   In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a), the \n22 \nrepresentative plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the class interests.  Plaintiff’s \n23 \ninterests are consistent with and not antagonistic to the interests of the class.   \n24 \n35.   In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(A), \n25 \nprosecutions of separate actions by indivi dual members of the class would create a \n26 \nrisk that inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the \n27 \nclass would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the parties opposing the \n28 \nclass.   \nCASPER, MEADOWS, \nSCHWARTZ & COOK \n2121 N.

In accordance with Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(1)(B), \n2  prosecutions of separate actions by indi vidual members of the  class would create a \nrisk of inconsistent adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which \n3 \nwould, as a practical matter, substantially  impair or impede the interests of the other \n4 \nmembers of the class to protect their interests. \n5 \n37.   In  accordance with Federal Rule s  of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), \n6 \nplaintiff is informed and believes, and ther eupon alleges, that defendants have acted \n7 \non grounds generally applicable to the class,  thereby making appropriate the final \n8 \ninjunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole.   \n9 \n38.   In accordance with Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(3), this \n10 \nclass  action is superior to other available methods for the fair and equitable \n11 \nadjudication of the controversy between the parties.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, \n12 \nand  thereupon alleges, that the  interests  of members of the class in individually \n13 \ncontrolling the prosecution of  a separate action is low, in that most class members \n14  would be unable individually to prosecute any ac tion at all.  Plaintiff is informed and \n15  believes, and thereupon alleges, that the amounts at stake for individuals are so small \n16  that separate suits would be impracticable.   Plaintiff is informed and believes, and \n17  thereupon alleges, that most members of t he class will not be able to find counsel to \nrepresent them.  Plaintiff is informed and  believes, and thereupon alleges, that it is \n18 \ndesirable to concentrate all litigation in  one forum because it will promote judicial \n19 \nefficiency to resolve the common questions of law and fact in one forum, rather than in \n20 \nmultiple courts.   \n21 \n39.   Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members.  Plaintiff \n22 \nis  informed and believes, and thereupon alleges ,  that the identities of the class \n23 \nmembers may be ascertained from reco rds maintained by defendant TRANSCOR \n24 \nAMERICA, LLC.

Procedural Background\n21\nPlaintiffs Kevin Schilling, John Pinedo and William Tellez filed this lawsuit against TransCor\n22\nAmerica, LLC (“TransCor”).  TransCor is a Tennesese corporation licensed to do business in California,\n23\nwhose business entails the transportation o fpretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United States\n24\non behalf of federal, state and local governments.1 \n25\nPlaintiffs allege that TransCor transports pr etrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that\n26\n27\n1  The Second Amended Complaint also names as defendants Sgt. John Smith and Officer John\nBrummett, employees and/or agents of TransCor who allegedly assaulted Plaintiff Schilling.  Second\n28\nAmended Complaint, ¶ 24. \n\n1 amount to cruel and unusual punishment.  Each of the named plaintiffs alleges that he was transported\n2 by TransCor for more than 24 hours and subjectedt o inhumane conditions during his journey, including\n3 being shackled and kept sitting upright, thereby being prevented from sleeping, and also deprived of\n4 access to toilets and sanitation facilities2.  The Second Amended Complaint alleges two class claims for\n5 relief:  (1) a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and\n6 (2) a claim under Cal. Civ. Code § 52.1 (the Bane Act )for violation of civil rights under California law.\n7 On February 16, 2010, the Court granted in part  plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and\n8 certified the following classes: \n9 1. A class of all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor America\nLLC, its agents and/or employees between February 14, 2006 and the present, and who were\n10 forced to remain in restraints in the trans port vehicle for more than 24 hours without being\na allowed to sleep overnight in a bed.  The cla ss includes pretrial detainees and prisoners who\nni 11 were removed from one transport vehicle and palced directly onto another, without being housed\nr\nto overnight, whose combined trip lasted more than 24 hours.  The c lass only includes those\nrf\nuli 12 pretrial detainees and prisoners who were transported by TransCor on behalf of a state agency,\noa\nCC and does not include pretrial detainees and prisonres who were transported on behalf of a federal\nct of  13 agency.\nrict \nisttri 14 2. A subclass of all pretrial detainees and prisoner s who were transported by TransCor\nDs\n Di America LLC, its agents and/or employees in the State of California between February 14, 2006\ns\nten  15 and the present, and who were forced to remain in restraints in the transport vehicle for more\nar\nte than 24 hours without being allowed to sleep overnight in a bed.  The class includes pretrial\nSh\nd rt 16 detainees and prisoners who were removed from one transport vehicle and placed directly onto\no\nteN another, without being housed overnight, whose combined trip lasted more than 24 hours.  The\nnie  17 class only includes those pretrial detainees andp risoners who were transported by TransCor on\nUh\nt behalf of a state agency, and does not i nclude pretrial detainees and prisoners who were\n \nr\no 18 transported on behalf of a federal agency.\nF\n19 February 16, 2010 Order [Docket No. 110] at 18-19.  \n20 Defendants moved for clarification of the Court’s class certification Order and/or decertification.\n21 On July 9, 2012, the Court denied that motion, and affirmed the certification of plaintiffs’ “Eighth and\n22 Fourteenth Amendment claims regarding the use of restraints, lack of overnight rest, lack of access to\n23 sanitation facilities and inadequate provision of food during transportation.”  Docket No. 200 at 2.\n24 Plaintiffs now move for partial sum mary judgment on plaintiffs’ first claim  for relief; for\n25 violation of Eight and Fourteenth Amendment rights based on TransCor’s policy and practice of: (1)\n26\n27\n2  The Second Amended Complaint also contains allegations regarding inadequate provision of\n28\nwater and food, but plaintiffs do not rely on those allegations in moving for summary judgment.\n2\n\n1 keeping prisoners3 in transport vehicles for more than 24 hours, without rest overnight; (2) restraining\n2 prisoners in handcuffs with black boxes, leg irons, wiast chains, and connector chains; and (3) restricting\n3 prisoner’s access to toilet and sanitation facilities.  Palintiffs also move for summary judgment on their\n4 second claim for relief under California’s Bane Act.\n5 Defendants oppose and also cross-move for summary judgment, arguing that the conditions\n6 plaintiffs complain of are not sufficiently serious deprivations tos upport an Eight Amendment violation,\n7 but even if they were, legitimate security concerns justified those deprivations.  Defendants also argue\n8 that plaintiffs have failed to prove and cannot satifsy the independent “interference” requirement of the\n9 Bane Act.4\n10\na\nni 11 2. Factual Background\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 The following facts are not in dispute.  Between February 14, 2006 to date, 5 thousands of\noa\nCC\nct of  13 prisoners and pretrial detainees were transported by TransCor for more than 24 continuous hours on at\nrict \nisttri 14 least one leg of their journeys.  From 2006 though the end of 2008, TransCor operated a “hub and\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 spoke” system of prisoner transportation, providing both “Extradition Services” (typically or ders to\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 move a single prisoner from  one point in the county to anot her distant jurisdiction) and “Special\no\nteN\nnie  17 Operations” (moves of a larger number of prisoners from one secured facility to another).  Affidavit of\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 Curtiss Sullivan (“C. Sullivan Aff.,” Docket No. 95-1 at 8), ¶¶ 20, 22.  Ideally, the Extradition Trips\nF\n19 were designed to last no longer than 108 hours to en sure the crew did not violate the Department of\n20 Transportation’s “hours of service” regulations.   Third Affidavit of James Crouch (“Crouch Aff.,”\n21 Docket No. 95-1 at 18), ¶ 5.  Pris oners, however, could be in transit for m ore than five days.\n22 Declaration of Jack Atherton (“Atherton Decl.”, Docket No. 144), ¶ 7.  The trisp were designed to depart\n23 from one hub, follow a circular route, and return to the same hub.  Crouch Aff., ¶ 5.  TransCor asserts\n24\n25 3  The class consists of both prisoners and pretrial detainees.  However, the Court will refer to\nthem collectively as “prisoners.”\n26\n4  Plaintiffs and defendants move for summary judgment on all claims except for plaintiff\n27\nSchilling’s individual Fourth Amendment excessive force claim.\n28 5  The class period is February 14, 2006 to the present.\n3\n\n1 – and plaintiffs do not dispute – that for Extrad ition Services after February 1, 2006: 19% of “order\n2 segments” were less than 30 hours; 39% were lessth an 36 hours; 55% were less than 42 hours; and 68%\n3 were less than 48 hours.  Crouch Aff., ¶ 106.  The median order segment duration was 39.78 hours.  Id.\n4 In order to facilitate transport to a prisoner’sf inal destination, prisoners are sometimes dropped\n5 off  – housed or “stashed” – at correctional facilities or TransCor “hubs” overnight.  When housed, the\n6 facilities are expected to provide prisoners with  medical examination, food, clothes, laundry and\n7 recreation.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶¶ 23, 26.  After beingh oused, the prisoners are then loaded onto different\n8 transporters for the next stage of their transfer.  TransCor’s goal is to “deliver all inmates within 10 days\n9 of pickup,” which includes both transit and housing time.  Affidavit of W. Ken Katsaris (Katsaris Aff.,\n10 Docket No. 145), ¶ 3.  TransCor places no limit on the amount of time a prisoner can remain in transport\na\nni 11 vehicles prior to overnight housing or delivery to the destination.  Id.\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 At the end of 2008, TransCor stopped Extradition Services to focus instead on local transports\noa\nCC\nct of  13 serving correctional facilities near its hubs (Defined Services), but TransCor continues to provide its\nrict \nisttri 14 Special Operations mass-transit services, directly from one location to another.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 21;\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 Crouch Aff., ¶ 3.   Special Operations are provided for entities, including the State of Vermont and the\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 California Department of Corrections, which “reque st” that their prisoners be moved directly from\no\nteN\nnie  17 origin to destination without stops.  Crouch Aff., ¶ 12.  Some of these Special Operations trips last under\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 24 hours and some last 31 - 36 hours.  Id., ¶¶ 16-18.\nF\n19 TransCor’s policy and practice is that restraints, including handcuffs, bell y chains, leg irons,\n20 interconnects and black boxes, are applied to all prisoners, with the exception that pregnant women are\n21 not required to wear a belly chain or shackles.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 14.  An “interconnect” is a chain\n22 approximately two feet long that is used to connect two prisoners together.  Handcuffs are attached to\n23 the belly chain to prevent the prisoner from raising his or her arms.  The black boxes are placed over\n24 the links connecting a prisoner’s handcuffs and they restrict wrist movement.\n25\n26\n27\n6  26% lasted between 48 and 72 hours; 6% lasted between 72 and 96 hours and 0.25% lasted\n28\nlonger than 96 hours.  Crouch Decl., ¶ 10.\n4\n\n1 TransCor’s policy and practice is to train and require Transportation Specialists7 to check the\n2 prisoners’ restraints at each stop.  If an inmate complains about the tightness of his or her restraints and\n3 swelling is present, Transportation Specialists wil l report the incident to their supervisors and, if\n4 approved, are allowed to modify the restraints, use larger restraints, use flexible Grip restraints, or even\n5 remove an entire portion of the restraint system.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 14; Expert Report of George Earl\n6 Sullivan (G.E. Sullivan Report, Docket No. 195-2 at 2)., ¶ 248.   The use of the restrains at issue can lead\n7 to swelling of extrem ities and numbness, as well as  abrasions and lacerations in som e instances.\n8 Katsaris Aff., ¶ 10; Atherton Decl., at 10.  Despite  TransCor’s policy of having its Transportation\n9 Specialists check on prisoners’ restraints during stops, instances of excessive swelling, abrasions, and\n10 skin being rubbed raw by the restraints occurred and T ransCor was aware of these instances.   See\na\nni 11 Plaintiffs’ Opposition at 15-16 (citing deposition testimony of former TransCor CEO).  TransCor has\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 no written policy or practice stating the maximum number of hours a prisoner can be held in restraints\noa\nCC\nct of  13 without a break.  Katsaris Aff., ¶ 3.\nrict \nisttri 14 Each of TransCor’s transport vehicles is divide d into compartments or cages.  Prisoners are\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 locked inside the compartments and seated in leather chairs.  The trnasports have televisions which show\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 movies during the day.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 16. Nom ovies are shown between the hours of 10:00 pm and\no\nteN\nnie  17 6:00 am.  Id.  The transport vehicles have a chemical toilet on board, and prisoners are permitted to use\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 the toilet only when the vehicle is stopped and they are escorted to the toilet by a TransCor employee,\nF\n19 along with the other prisoner they are chained to.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 16.  Stops are made every 3.5 to\n20 4 hours, and prisoners are also allowed to use theto ilet any time the transporter stops. Supp. Snell Decl.,\n21 Ex. 3 at 116.  Prisoners remain in restraints and are chained to one another while using the toilet.  Other\n22 than the toilet, prisoners do not have access to sanitation facilities on the transporters.  There is no\n23 running water and prisoners are provided with hand sanitizer after using the toilet and before meals. C.\n24\n25 7  “Transportation Specialists” are TransCor em ployees who are responsible for driving and\nguarding the prisoners.\n26\n8  Four of the nine class m embers who were deposed testified that they had their restrai nts\n27\naltered.   See Defendants’ Exhibit 5 at 56, 59-60 (Arno restraints altered after complaint); Ex. 6 at 61\n(Kincheloe restraints altered after complaint); Ex. 7 at 45-46 (Wright restraints altered after complaint);\n28\nEx. 15 at 115, 140 (Pinedo not fitted with a black box). \n5\n\n1 Sullivan Aff., ¶ 16.  TransCor’s policy is not to provide prisoners with soap, tooth brushes or the ability\n2 to shave on the transporters, because of security concerns.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 27.  During transit, the\n3 prisoners are not allowed to change clothes, although if a prisoner is housed during his or her trip, the\n4 prisoner’s clothes will be laundered.  Id., ¶ 26.\n5 TransCor’s policy is to advise prisoners against lying down in the transport vehicle to sleep, due\n6 to possibility of injury and the dif ficulty of being chained to another prisoner.  Katsaris Aff., ¶ 6.\n7 Therefore, if prisoners sleep, they sleep sitting in their seats.I d .; see also Atherton Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.  The\n8 ability to sleep varies depending on the prisoner, the number of stops the transporter makes and other\n9 factors.  TransCor’s policy is to allow prisoners  to stand up and stretch – within the lim its of their\n10 restraints and dependent upon the agreement of the prisoner they are chained to – during stops.  Katsaris\na\nni 11 Aff., ¶ 7. Prisoners are permitted to walk up and down the transporter’s aisle, two at a tim e, during\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 restroom breaks once those inmates who need to use the restroom have done so.  Id.\noa\nCC\nct of  13 The parties dispute why overnight housing was not provided.  TransCor asserts that it was not\nrict \nisttri 14 able to house prisoners at local detention facilities because of jail overcrowding and a lack of facilities\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 that could separately house the TransCor prisoners in appropriate accommodations.  C. Sullivan Aff.,\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 ¶¶ 23-24.  In particular, TransCor asserts that only on Cealifornia facility, in Southern California, agreed\no\nteN\nnie  17 to provide housing services for TransCor prisoners.  Crouch Aff., ¶ 11.  As a result, TransCor secured\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 larger vehicles with “sleeper berths” for the Tranpsortation Specialists, so that TransCor could continue\nF\n19 to move the prisoners without vioalting the Department of Transportation regulations on hours of service\n20 for drivers.  C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 25.  For its ongoing Special Operations trips, some of which last 31-36\n21 hours,  TransCor contends that its custom ers  (State  of Verm ont  and California Departm ent  of\n22 Corrections) request and/or require that the prisoner sbe delivered without stops overnight.  Crouch Aff.,\n23 ¶¶ 12, 19.\n24 Plaintiffs contend that “contract facilities”  would be readily available to house TransCor\n25 prisoners overnight. Katsaris Aff., ¶ 25; Brook Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.  Plaintiffsa lso contend that TransCor did\n26\nnot plan or  attempt to secure overnight housing – but instead purchased larger transports with sleeping\n27\nberths for its own employees – to save time and avoid the need to look for overnight facilities.  Snell\n28\nDecl., Ex. 4 (Rion Depo.) at 71-72.  Plaintiffs’ affiants declare that they know of no other agency or\n6\n\n1 company which transports pri soners for more than 24 continuous hours rather than housing them\n2 overnight in a contract facility.  Katsaris Aff., ¶ 15 ;Brooks Decl., ¶ 6.  Defendanst’ affiants and experts\n3 do not address whether any other agencies or companies transport prisoners for 24 continuous hours\n4 without housing them overnight.\n5 Plaintiffs’ affiants also contend that depriv ing prisoners of sleep for over 24 hours, keeping\n6 prisoners in restraints for 24 hours, and depriving prisoners of sanitation facilities (running water, free\n7 use of a toilet) for 24 hours alone and in cobmination deprive prisoners of basic human needs and violate\n8 the custodian’s duty to provide humane treatment to prisoners.  Atherton Decl., at 7; Katsaris Aff., ¶ 8.\n9 Defendants’ expert does not address the use of restraints and lack of overnight rest for more than 24\n10 hours directly.  Instead, he states: “I do not read any complaint or condition that does not comport with\na\nni 11 sound correctional practices or are not within the Standard of Care.” G. E. Sullivan Report, Opinion 4.\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 TransCor’s Vice President and Chief Operating Officea sserts that the practice of transporting prisoners\noa\nCC\nct of  13 in a vehicle or combination of vehicles in excess of 24 hours is “an acceptable and humane practice.”\nrict \nisttri 14 C. Sullivan Aff., ¶ 31.\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 LEGAL STANDARD\no\nteN\nnie  17 Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, thed iscovery and disclosure materials on file, and\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled\nF\n19 to judgment as a matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  The moving party bears the initial burden of\n20 demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n21 323 (1986).  The moving party, however, has no burden to disprove matters on which the non-moving\n22 party will have the burden of proof at trial.  The moving party need only demonstrate to the Court that\n23 there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party's case.  Id. at 325.\n24 Once the moving party has met its burden, the burden shifts to the non-m oving party to “set\n25 out‘specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.’”  Id. at 324 (quoting then Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).\n26\nTo carry this bur den, the non-moving party must “do more than simply show that there is som e\n27\nmetaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,\n28\n475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  “The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence . . . will be insufficient; there\n7\n\n1 must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-moving party].”  Anderson v.\n2 Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\n3 In deciding a summary judgment motion, the Court must view the evidence in the light most\n4 favorable to the non-m oving party and draw all justi fiable inferences in its favor.   Id. at 255.\n5 “Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from\n6 the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge . . . ruling on a m otion for summary judgment.”  Id.\n7 However, conclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise\n8 genuine issues of fact and defeat summary judgment.  Thornhill Publ’g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp., 594 F.2d\n9 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).  The evidence the parties present must be admissible.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)).\n10\na\nni 11 DISCUSSION\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 1. Plaintiffs’ Federal Constitutional Claims\noa\nCC\nct of  13 A. Legal Standard\nrict \nisttri 14 The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishm ent requires that prison\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 officials take reasonable measures for the safety of inmates.  See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 (1994).  An official violates the Eighth Am endment only when two requirements are met:  (1) the\no\nteN\nnie  17 deprivation alleged is, objectively, sufficiently serious, and (2) the official is, subjectively, deliberately\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 indifferent to the inmate’s safety.  See id. at 834. “[O]nly those deprivations denying ‘the minimal\nF\n19 civilized measure of life’s necessities,’ are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth Amendment\n20 violation.”  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 298 (1991) (citation omitted).  Neither negligence nor gross\n21 negligence is actionable under § 1983 in the prison context.  See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 835-36 & n.4.\n22 “[W]hile the eighth amendment proscribes cruel and unusual punishment for convicted inmates,\n23 the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment proscribes any punishment of pretrial detainees.”\n24 Redman v. County of San Diego, 942 F.2d 1435, 1440 at n.7 (9th Cir1. 991).  “[E]ven though the pretrial\n25 detainees’ rights arise under the Due Process Clause, the guarantees of the Eighth Amendment provide\n26\na minimum standard of care for determining their rights.”  Or. Advocacy Ctr. v. Mink, 322 F.3d 1101,\n27\n1120 (9th Cir. 2003).\n28\n8\n\n1 B. Sufficiently Serious\n2 As an initial matter, the Court is required – in  light of the class definition –  to conf ine its\n3 analysis to determining whether the conditions complained of inflict a constitutional deprivation if their\n4 duration is “more than 24 hours.”  As 24 hours pluso ne minute is the lowest common denominator for\n5 the class, the Court m ust determine whether depriving prisoners of a bed, and/or holding them  in\n6 restraints, and/or depriving them of sanitation facilities for 24 hours and one m inute is “sufficiently\n7 serious” to amount to a constitutional deprivation.  Plaintiffs – in their evidence and argument – do not\n8 differentiate between prisoners transported under the challenged conditions for 24 hours plus one minute\n9 and prisoners transported for longer periods of time.  Similarly, plaintiffs’ experts do not address or\n10 provide evidence regarding the im pact of the c omplained of conditions on prisoners as the tim e\na\nni 11 increases above 24 hours.  As such, the Court has no evidentiary basis to consider whether prisoners\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 subjected to the complained of conditions for significantly more time than 24 hours have stated a\noa\nCC\nct of  13 constitutional claim.  But see, Hoptowit v. Ray, 682 F.2d 1237, 1258 (9th Cir. 1982) (“in considering\nrict \nisttri 14 whether a prisoner has been deprived of his rights,  courts may consider the length of time that the\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 prisoner must go without these benefits. . . . The longer the prisoner isw  ithout such benefits, the closer\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 it becomes to being an unwarranted infliction of pain.”).  \no\nteN\nnie  17 Plaintiffs contend that alone or collectiv ely, transporting prisoners over 24 hours without\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 allowing for overnight sleep in a bed, while in f ull restraints and without f ree access to sanitation\nF\n19 facilities, deprives the prisoners of the basic life necessities of sleep, freedom from pain and hygiene.\n20 Regarding the lack of overnight rest, plaintiffs rely on cases finding that forcing inmates to sleep on the\n21 floor is sufficient to state Eighth and Fourteenth  Amendment claims.  However, those cases were\n22 analyzed in the context of jails and prisons where – either due to an intent to discomfort prisoners or\n23 because of overcrowding – inm ates were forced  to sleep on m attresses  on t he  floor, often in\n24 inappropriate areas.  See, e,g., Union County Jail Inmates v. Di Buono, 713 F.2d 984, 996 (3d Cir. N.J.\n25 1983) (forcing detainees to sleep on mattresses placed on the floor adjacent to the toilet).  The Courts\n26\nfound that there was no legitimate government justification for forcing inmates to sleep on the floor,\n27\nsimply because there may not be sufficient capacity in the current facilities. S ee, e.g.,Thompson v. Los\n28\nAngeles, 885 F.2d 1439, 1448 (9th Cir. 1989) (ofrcing pretrial detainee to sleep on cement floor for two\n9\n\n1 nights served no legitimate governmental objective);  Thomas v. Baca, 514 F. Supp. 2d 1201, 1217\n2 (C.D. Cal. 2007) (“The basic humanity inherent in providing access to a bed highlights the practice of\n3 forced floor-sleeping as one of the unconstitutional effects of prison overcrowding.”); see also Lyons\n4 v. Powell, 838 F.2d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1988) (“subjecting pretrial detainees to the use of a floor mattress\n5 for anything other than brief emergency circumstances may constitute an impermissible imposition of\n6 punishment”).\n7 Here, the Court is addressing conditions on a prisonetrr ansport vehicle, a situation that is starkly\n8 different from a brick and mortar prison.  The parties do not dispute that transportation of these inmates\n9 is necessary, and that some deprivations will occur because the prisoners are being transported outside\n10 of secure facilities , e.g., restraints must be used for security purposes.  As the Ninth Circuit recognized\na\nni 11 in  Johnson v. Lewis, 217 F.3d 726, 731 (9th Cir. Ariz. 2000), “[t]he circumstances, nature, and duration\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 of a deprivation of  these necessities m ust be considered in determ ining whether a constitutional\noa\nCC\nct of  13 violation has occurred.”  This case, therefore, does not fall within the generally recognized prohibition\nrict \nisttri 14 against forcing pretrial detainees and inmates to sleep on the floor of jails or prisons.9\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 As defendants point out, in deposition testimony, some inmates testified that they were unable\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 to sleep on the transporter, but otherss aid they were able to sleep or napS. ee Defendants’ Ex. 5 at 65-66\no\nteN\nnie  17 (Arno; was not able to get an hour or m ore of sleep, but could nap 20 or 30 minutes); Ex. 6 at 59\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 (Kincheloe; was able to nap); Ex. 8 at 67-68 (Cedillo; was able to nap and others able to sleep).\nF\n19 TransCor would not play movies from 10:00 p.m. through 6:00 a.m. in order to allow rest, and there is\n20 no evidence that TransCor employees tried to prevent inmates from sleeping during their transport.\n21 Significantly, plaintiffs’ affiants do not state, or provide any support for the proposition, that sleep\n22 deprivation for a 24-hour period has any significant ill effects that would cause it, alone, to constitute\n23\n9  Nor does this case fall into the category of cases where, either by intentional conduct or by\n24\nfacility design, prisoners are routinely deprived of sleep. S ee, e.g., Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1090\n(9th Cir. 1996) (denying motion for summary judgment because there was no “legitimate penological\n25\njustification” for constant illumination of cell where prisoner was placed for six months).  The Court\nagrees with plaintiffs that defendants’ cases – addressing situations where temporary jail overcrowding\n26\nforced authorities to make pretrial detainees sleep on the floor overnight – are largely inapposite.\nHowever, those cases underscore the fact that the c ontext in which the Eighth Amendment claim is\n27\nraised – e.g., in emergency/temporary situations in defendants’ cases versus ongoing overcrowding in\nplaintiffs’ cases – is important in determining whether a constitutional deprivation has occurred.  Here,\n28\nthe Court is addressing transport vehicles during a 24-hour plus one minute time frame.\n10\n\n1 a significant deprivation of basic human needs.\n2 Plaintiffs also argue that the use of the restraitns – leg shackles, handcuffs, belly chains and black\n3 boxes to restrict wrist movement – creates an unconstitutional deprivation when used for more than 24\n4 hours.  Plaintiffs rely on Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730 (2002).  There, the Suprem e Court held that\n5 attaching an inmate to a hitching post for seven hours in the sun, during which time he was given water\n6 only once or twice and given no access to a bathroom, was an unconstitutional deprivation under the\n7 Eighth Amendment.  The Court held that use  of the hitching post clearly constituted an Eight\n8 Amendment violation because, “[d]espite the clear lack of an em ergency situation, the respondents\n9 knowingly subjected him to a substantial risk of physical harm, to unnecessary pain caused by the\n10 handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a 7-hour period, to unnecessary exposure to the\na\nni 11 heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a deprivation of bathroom breaks that created\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation,” and was “punitive treatment” amounting “to gratuitous\noa\nCC\nct of  13 infliction of ‘wanton and unnecessary’ pain.”  Id., at 738.  Here, there is no evidence that the use of the\nrict \nisttri 14 restraints is punitive or gratuitous.  The use of the extensive restraints is a policy TransCor adopted to\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 comply with the requirements of the Jeanna Act, see 42 U.S.C. § 13726,10 and to ensure security while\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 transporting prisoners outside of secure facilities, where accidents and other events that heighten the risk\no\nteN\nnie  17 of prisoner escape can occur.\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 Plaintiffs also rely on Myers v. Transcor America, LLC  2010 WL 3824083 (M.D.Tenn. 2010).\nF\n19 In Myers, a prisoner brought an Eighth Amendment excessive force claim based on  TransCor’s “custom\n20 of placing and leaving inmates in restraints in such a manner that the restraints caused inmates to suffer\n21 unnecessary pain and physical injury which were obvious and apparent and for which no relief wa s\n22 offered by the transport officers.”  Id., *4.  The plaintiff and other affiants subm itted evidence that\n23 although they each suffered extreme swelling, bleeding and other obvious ill effects from the restraints,\n24 the TransCor employees ignored the complaints and failed to take any action to provide relief.  Here,\n25 plaintiffs’ claim is that the use of the restraints for 24 hours, by itself, is the constitutional deprivation.\n26\nPlaintiffs do not allege – or submit any evidence – that use of the restraints for 24 hours will necessarily\n27\n10  Jeanna’s Act subjects “private prisoner tranpsort companies” to various regulations “in order\n28\nto enhance public safety.”  42 U.S.C. § 13726(5).\n11\n\n1 cause extreme swelling, bleeding, or other injuries on a classwide basis.  Additionally, while there is\n2 evidence that some of the class members’ restraints were too tight and/or caused swelling, chafing, and\n3 abrasions there are no allegations that TransCor had a custom or policy of ignoring prisoner complaints\n4 about excessive swelling or abrasions from ill-fitting restraints.  The Myers analysis of the individual\n5 excessive force claim, therefore, is inapposite.  \n6 In Bain v. Transcor America, LLC, 2009 WL 562586 (M.D.Tenn. 2009), the Court denied a\n7 motion to dismiss plaintiff’s Eighth Amendment claims that he “suffered pain for over 50 straight hours\n8 while restrained, was denied prescribed medication, and suffered swelling, bruising, and lacerations on\n9 his wrists, legs, and ankles which did not abate for nearly two weeks.”  Id., *7.   The Court noted that\n10 plaintiff had alleged that the particular restraints , the tightness of the restraints, and their ref usal to\na\nni 11 loosen any restraints were mandated by TransCor’s policies.  Here, the only policy at issue is the use\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 of restraints.  There are no classwide allegations of use of “overly tight” restraints or an alleged policy\noa\nCC\nct of  13 to refuse to loosen restraints.  Bain, therefore, is likewise inapposite.11\nrict \nisttri 14 The Court finds that use of the restraints at issue for a period exceeding 24 hours, by itself and\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 given the context of  transporting prisoners outside  of secure facilities, is not an unconstitutional\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 deprivation under the Eighth Amendment.  For example, in Key v. McKinney, 176 F.3d 1083, 1085 (8th\no\nteN\nnie  17 Cir. 1999) a plaintiff was put in restraints for 24 hours as a disciplinary measure; he complained that\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 restraints made it difficult to sleep and were painful, that it was difficult to take care of bodily functions,\nF\n19 and that his requests to have handcuffs loosened were denied.  The Court found that he failed to state\n20 an Eighth Amendment claim.  The Court noted that he was provided with bedding, food, or bathroom\n21 facilities, and he was checked on by a nurse and guard at regular intervals. The Court concluded that,\n22 “[w]hile the shackles made it more difficult to sleep and relieve himself, he has not shown that he\n23 suffered a serious deprivation of ‘the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities.’” Id., at 1086.\n24\n25 11  Plaintiffs also rely on Anderson-Bey v. District of Columbia, 466 F. Supp. 2d 51 (D.D.C.\n2006).  In that case, the Court denied sum mary judgment based on plaintiffs’ allegations that “each\n26\nprisoner’s restraints were applied far too tightly, with the handcuffs cutting off circulation and digging\ninto and sometimes cutting the skin. . . . The restraints remained too tight throughout the trip, despite\n27\nthe prisoners’ complaints.”  Id., at 58-59.  Here, the complaint is that the restraints were applied, not that\nthey were applied too tightly or otherwise manipulated in order to harm the plaintiffs.  Similarly, the\n28\nallegation that prisoner complaints were ignored, is not made on a class-wide basis here.\n12\n\n1 Here, while the plaintiffs did not have bedding, they had access to food, drinking water, and the toilet\n2 (restricted to stops).  The prisoners also had their restraints checked on by TransCor employees during\n3 stops and could have asked employees to loosen the restraints if significant problems occurred.  \n4 As to the claims of inadequate access to sanitation, the Court finds that the allegations do not\n5 result in a constitutional deprivation for a period of2 4 hours plus one minute.  Plaintiffs do not dispute\n6 that the transports stopped every 3.5 to 4 hours.  Plaintiffs do not disputet hat prisoners were able to use\n7 the toilet during any of the stops, except for plaintiff Pinedo’s com plaint that TransCor employees\n8 refused to remove his restraints so that  he could defecate.  Snell Decl., Ex. I at 7. 12  There were\n9 situations where the chemical toilet on board was dirty and not cleaned.  However, the question before\n10 the Court is not whether particular class members suffered a constitutional deprivation because they\na\nni 11 were unable to use the toilet at a specific time.  Instead, the question is whether TransCor’s policy of\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 not allowing prisoners at-will use of the toilets, instead restricting use to every 3.5 to 4 hours, and\noa\nCC\nct of  13 TransCor’s failure to provide running water, soap, toothbrushes and a change of clothes over a period\nrict \nisttri 14 of 24 hours plus one m inute imposes a constitutional deprivation of minimal hygiene.  The Court\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 concludes it does not.13\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 Plaintiffs’ reliance on Hoptowit v. Spellman, 753 F.2d 779 (9th Cir. 1985) is misplaced.  There,\no\nteN\nnie  17 the Ninth Circuit found “that various aspects of thep enitentiary’s ‘old, dilapidated, and ill-maintained’\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 physical plant,” including unsatisfactory plumbing, vermin infestation and unavailable or inadequate\nF\n19 cell cleaning supplies violated the Eighth Amendment.  Id., at 783.  Similarly, in Keenan v. Hall, 83\n20 F.3d 1083, 1091 (9th Cir. 1996), the Ninth Circuit held that requiring an indigent prisoner to purchase\n21 his own hygiene supplies created a “sanitation”  claim under the Eighth Am endment, precluding\n22 summary judgment.  These cases are wholly inapposite to the case at hand, which deals with a 24-hour\n23\n24 12  Pineda’s testimony is ambiguous on why he was not allowed to defecate.  The interrogatory\nresponses cited by plaintiffs reference Pineda’s  complaints about “noise” and not being let off the\n25\ntransport, in conjunction with his inability to defecate.  Id. at 5, 7-10.  Another class member testified\nthat because the toilet was locked while the vehiclew as in transit, fellow passengers soiled themselves.\n26\nSnell Decl., Ex. LL.\n27 13 The Court notes that a lack of access to running water and other hygiene measures for longer\nperiods of time raise different questions in terms of deprivation of rights, but the Court cannot reach\n28\nthose questions here in light of the posture of and evidence in this case.\n13\n\n1 plus one minute deprivation while prisoners are in transit.  But see Walker v. Sumner, 14 F.3d 1415,\n2 1421 (9th Cir. 1994) (denial of adequate clothing  might constitute Eighth Amendment violation);\n3 Toussaint v. McCarthy, 597 F. Supp. 1388, 1409 (N.D. Cal. 1984) (l“eaking pipes and fixtures, clogged\n4 drains, rotting sewer lines, and other plumbing and sewage deficiencies are a major cause of the serious\n5 health hazards”).14\n6 Plaintiffs argue that even if none of the three conditions in isolation amounts to a constitutional\n7 deprivation, the combination of them creates a “mutually enforcing effect” that deprived plaintiffs of\n8 the basic human needs of sleep and adequate shelter.  Plaintiffs’ Motion at 18.  Plaintiffs rely onW  ilson\n9 v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294, 304 (1991).  There, the Supreme Court explained that “[s]ome conditions of\n10 confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment violation ‘in combination’ when each would not do\na\nni 11 so alone, but only when they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single,\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 identifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise – for example, a low cell temperature at night\noa\nCC\nct of  13 combined with a failure to issue blankets.”  Here, however, the sanitation conditions complained of do\nrict \nisttri 14 not combine – either with the lack of sleep or the use of restraints – to cause the deprivation of a single\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 identifiable need over the 24-hour plus one minute period.  \nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 The combination of use of restraints and being continuously transported for 24 hours or more\no\nteN\nnie  17 has a nexus with respect to a prisoner’s ability tore st comfortably during a 24-hour period, as both sides\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 admit that the restraints are uncomfortable.  However, as noted above, plaintiffs do not dispute that\nF\n19 TransCor’s policy requires TransCor employees to check on the restraints for fit and for obvious signs\n20\n14  The two class certification cases relied on by plaintiffs are not apposite to the question now\n21\nbefore this Court -- that is, the determination on summary judgment whether plaintiffs have shown that\nthe conditions inflicted on them constitute unconstitutional deprivations.  Those cases are also\n22\ndistinguishable on their facts.  InT  yler v. Suffolk County, 253 F.R.D. 8 (D. Mass. 2008), prisoners were\nhoused in cells that were not equipped with toilets or sinks. When the inmates were locked in at night,\n23\nthey could use the toilets only if they were permitted to do so by the guards.  The inmates alleged “that,\ndue to inattention (and, possibly, malice) of the guards on duty, their bathroom access was unreliable.\n24\n. . .”  Id., at 9.  Here, however, the issue is not inattentoin or malice of the guards, but instead the policy\nof allowing inmates to use the toilet only every 3.5 t o4 hours during stops.  Moreover, given the context\n25\nat issue – prisoners being m oved outside secure facilities, transporters in m otion, and prisoners in\nrestraints – the Court does not find Tyler persuasive for purposes of determining the merits of plaintiffs’\n26\ndeprivation claim.  Similarly, while the Court in Dunn v. City of Chicago, 231 F.R.D. 367 (N.D. Ill.\n2005), indicated it would certify a class of pretrial detainees who were held for an “unlawful period of\n27\ntime (greater than 16 hours) in interrogation rooms that lacked the most basic amenities,” including\naccess to food service and sleeping facilities, the case does not provide support for plaintiffs’ summary\n28\njudgment claims here.\n14\n\n1 of harm every time transporters stop.  If a prisoner complains about discomfort and there are signs of\n2 swelling  or ill-f itting  restraints, TransCor em ployees  are authorized, with approval f rom  their\n3 supervisors, to take steps to address that discomfort.  The Court finds that even in combination, the lack\n4 of  sleep overnight and use of   full  restraints  – with periodic checks – does not constitute an\n5 unconstitutional deprivation when applied for 24 hours plus one minute.  See, e.g., Key v. McKinney,\n6 176 F.3d 1083 at 1085. \n7 For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that th e conditions plaintiffs complain of – in the\n8 context of transportation of prisoners and over a2 4-hour plus one minute period – do not, without more\n9 and on a class-wide basis, constitute unconstitutional deprivations under the Eighth or Fourteenth\n10 Amendments.  To be clear, the Court does not find that the conditions alleged, if imposed for periods\na\nni 11 exceeding 24 hours or if imposed in different manners or with specific injuries, could not constitute\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 unconstitutional deprivations to individual prisoners.  As a class–wide m atter, however, and on the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 record presented, the Court does not ifnd that plaintiffs have established or can establish a constitutional\nrict \nisttri 14 violation.15\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 2. Plaintiffs’ Bane Act Claims\no\nteN\nnie  17 California’s Bane Act, California Civil Code § 52.1, provides a cause of action for interference\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18 with constitutional rights.  However, as the Court has granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment\nF\n19 finding that the plaintif fs have not dem onstrated classwide constitutional deprivations by being\n20 subjected to the complained of conditions for 24 hours plus one minute, plaintiffs’ classwide Bane Act\n21 claims must likewise fail.\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27 15 In light of the above conclusion, the Court need not reach the issue of defendants’ deliberate\nindifference or penological necessity. \n28\n15\n\n1 CONCLUSION\n2 For the foregoing reasons and for good cause s hown, the Court hereby DENIES plaintiffs’\n3 motion for partial summary judgment and GRANTS defendants cross-motion for partial summary\n4 judgment on plaintiffs’ class claims.16\n5\n6 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n7\n8 Dated: August 8, 2012\n9                                                        \nSUSAN ILLSTON\n10 United States District Judge\na\nni 11\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12\noa\nCC\nct of  13\nrict \nstri 14\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16\no\nteN\nnie  17\nUh\nt\n \nr\no 18\nF\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n16  Defendants also move for summary judgment as to the claims of named plaintiff William\n25\nTellez.  Defendants argue that Tellez was  a resident of Nevada when he was arrested in 2002, and\ntherefore, even though he was imprisoned in California during early February 2006 – when his last\n26\ntransport by TransCor occurred – he is not entitled t otolling under California’s Code of Civil Procedure\n§ 352.1.  Compare Defendants’ Cross-Motion at 1, fn. 1 with Plaintiffs’ Opposition at 23.  However,\n27\nneither side provides the Court with any authority onh ow the residence of a prisoner is determined for\npurposes of applying a statute of limitations defense.  Therefore, defendants’ motion as to any individual\n28\nclaim plaintiff Tellez may have is DENIED.\n16",

Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court determines that the matters are appropriate for resolu-\ntion without oral argument, and VACATES the hearing. For the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES defendants' \nmotion to transfer venue, and GRANTS plaintiff leave to amend the complaint. \n \nBACKGROUND  \nOn February 14, 2008, plaintiff Kevin Schilling filed this lawsuit against TransCor America, LLC (\"TransCor\"), \nSergeant John Smith, \"Officer Blanden,\" and Does 1-100. 1 On August 21, 2008, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint \n\n \nadding two additional named plaintiffs, John Pinedo and William Tellez, and correcting a typographical error. The \namended complaint alleges that TransCor is a for-profit Tennessee corporation licensed to do business in California \nwhose business entails the transportation of pretrial detainees and prisoners throughout the United States on behalf of \nfederal, state and local governments. First  [*3] Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") P 13. The complaint also alleges that at \nall material times, each of the defendants was acting under color of state and federal law. Id. P 17. \n \n1   The complaint incorrectly named defendant Jeff Brummett as Officer Blanden. Plaintiffs' motion to amend \nthe complaint seeks to correct this error, and defendants have no objection to this amendment. This order will re-\nfer to defendant by his correct name, Brummett. \nThe FAC alleges that TransCor transports pretrial detainees and prisoners in conditions that amount to cruel and \nunusual punishment. The FAC alleges that TransCor's policies, practices or customs include but are not limited to trans-\nporting pretrial detainees and prisoners in small metal cages in which a person can neither stand up nor lie down, for \nmore than 24 hours at a time, while the person is handcuffed, chained, and in shackles, and failing to provide pretrial \ndetainees and prisoners with adequate food, fluids, exercise, hygiene, and medical care. Id. P 2. According to the FAC, \nplaintiff Schilling was picked up at a detention facility in Fairfield, California, by agents and/or employees of TransCor. \nId. P 21. The complaint alleges that Schilling was strip  [*4] searched before boarding the transport van, and that he \n\"was then handcuffed, a restraint was applied that secured his hands to his waist, and he was shackled. After boarding \nthe transport van, plaintiff was seated on a metal bench in a small, locked metal cage in which it was impossible for him \nto stand up or sit down.\" Id. The complaint alleges that for the next several days, plaintiff remained in the transport van, \nrestrained and shackled in the metal cage, while the van \"meandered around California - from Fairfield through counties \nwithin the Northern District of the United States Court and then back, once again through counties within the Northern \nDistrict of the United States District Court, to Fairfield - picking up and dropping off pretrial detainees and/or prison-\ners.\" Id. P 22. Plaintiff Schilling alleges that during the time in the transport van, he was provided with only two meals \nper day; he was not permitted to lie down, stand up, bathe, shave, brush his teeth or change his clothes; he was forced to \nuse the on-board toilet at defendants' convenience; and aside from the steps from his cage to the toilet and back, he was \nallowed no physical activity. Id. P 23. The FAC also  [*5] alleges that after being in the van for several days, Schilling \nrealized that the van was headed back to Fairfield and he demanded to speak to the warden. Id. P 24. The complaint \nalleges that in response, and while he was detained as described above, defendants Brummett and Smith grabbed him, \nsprayed pepper spray in his face, purposely walked him into poles, and along with an unknown TransCor employee, \npunched him. Id. Plaintiff alleges that he was not allowed to see a doctor or a nurse until the transport van reached Im-\nperial County Jail. Id. \nThe FAC alleges that plaintiff Pinedo was picked up by TransCor at Kern Valley State Prison in Delano, California, \nand transported to Santa Barbara County Jail. Id. P 26. The FAC alleges that the trip took more than 27 hours, and that \nduring the entire time Pinedo was in TransCor's vehicle, he was handcuffed, shackled, and restrained with a belly chain \nand chained to other inmates in a metal cage, unable to lie down or sleep during the entire time of his transport. Id. P 27. \nThe FAC also alleges that Pinedo was permitted only two opportunities to urinate, but could not sit to use the toilet to \ndefecate because TransCor personnel would not remove  [*6] any of the restraints. Id. P 28. Pinedo also alleges that he \nwas fed only three \"fast food\" meals, and not permitted to wash, shower or change his clothes before being delivered to \nSanta Barbara County Jail. Id. P 29. \nThe FAC alleges that plaintiff Tellez was picked up by TransCor at the Federal Penitentiary in Atwater, California. \nId. P 30. Tellez was transported to Clark County Detention Center in a trip that took six days, and then approximately \nsix months later, TransCor transported Tellez from Clark County Detention Center back to Atwater, California. Id. P 33. \nThe FAC alleges that Tellez experienced conditions similar to those experienced by Schilling and Pinedo. Id. PP 30-33. \nPlaintiffs filed this action on behalf of a class consisting of \"all pretrial detainees and prisoners who were trans-\nported by TRANSCOR AMERICA, LLC, its agents and/or employees, and forced to remain in the transport van for \nmore than 24 hours, from two years preceding the filing of this Complaint to the date this case is resolved.\" Id. P 39. \nThe complaint also alleges a similar subclass of all pretrial detainees and prisoners transported in California. Id. P 40. \nThe complaint alleges claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983  [*7] for violations of the Fourth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments to the U.S. Constitution, and the California State Bane Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive \nrelief, as well as monetary damages. \n \nDISCUSSION  \n \n\n \nI. Defendants' motion to transfer venue  \nDefendants move to transfer venue to the Middle District of Tennessee, or alternatively to the Eastern District of \nCalifornia. Defendants contend that transfer is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) because a substantial part of \nthe events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred in Tennessee, where TransCor is headquartered and thus where the \nTransCor policies and procedures were developed, or the Eastern District of California, because a large portion of the \nroute that plaintiff Schilling traveled on when he was transported from Fairfield, California to Las Vegas, Nevada, is in \nthe Eastern District. Alternatively, defendants contend that venue should be transferred to Tennessee pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1404(a) because it is more convenient for the parties and witnesses. \n \nA. 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a)  \nIn general, venue is covered by 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Under 29 U.S.C. 1391(b), where federal subject matter jurisdic-\ntion is not based  [*8] solely on diversity of citizenship, venue is proper in the following districts: (1) a judicial district \nwhere any defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State; (2) a judicial district in which a \"substantial part \nof the events or omissions\" giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \"substantial part of the property\" that is the subject of \nthe action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which the action may otherwise be brought, a judicial district in \nwhich any defendant may be found. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Here, the defendants do not all reside in the same state, 2 and \nthere are districts in which the action may be brought, and thus the question is whether a \"substantial part of the events \nor omissions\" giving rise to plaintiffs' claims occurred in this district. \n \n2   Defendants Brummett and Smith reside in Oklahoma. \nAs an initial matter, plaintiffs contend that defendants have waived an improper venue defense because Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) provides that any motion asserting the defense of improper venue must be made before \npleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. Plaintiffs note that TransCor filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule \n12(b)  [*9] in 2008, and that it has since appeared at three different case management conferences and has represented \nin case management conference statements that \"there are no issues regarding personal jurisdiction or venue.\" TransCor \nargues that it has not waived a venue challenge because it was only recently that TransCor's counsel learned that plain-\ntiff Schilling's transport only traveled into the Northern District momentarily. Defendants also argue that defendants \nSmith and Brummett were only recently served with the complaint, and that these defendants preserved their venue ob-\njection by asserting it in their answer and by filing the instant motion. \nThe Court finds that defendants Smith and Brummett have not waived their venue objection since these defendants \nwere only recently served and have raised improper venue in their answer. Given the procedural history of this case and \nthe fact that this action has been pending since February 2008, it is a much closer call as to whether TransCor has \nwaived its right to challenge venue. However, because all defendants raise identical arguments regarding venue, the \nCourt will consider the motion as to all defendants. \nThe events or omissions on which  [*10] plaintiffs' claims are based occurred in several judicial districts, including \nthe Northern and Eastern Districts of California, Nevada, and Tennessee. Section 1391(b) \"do[es] not require that a ma-\njority of the 'events or omissions' occur in the district where suit is filed; nor that the events there predominate. It is suf-\nficient that a 'substantial part' occur there.\" Schwarzer, Tashima & Wagstaffe, Federal Civil Procedure Before Trial, P \n4:316 (2009). The \"substantiality\" requirement is \"intended to preserve the element of fairness so that a defendant is not \nhaled into a remote district having no real relationship to the dispute.\" Cottman Transmission Systems, Inc. v. Martino, \n36 F.3d 291, 294 (3d Cir. 1994). \nThe parties dispute how much of plaintiff Schilling's transport route went through the Northern District versus the \nEastern District. 3 The Court finds it unnecessary to resolve this factual question -- which in any event cannot be conclu-\nsively determined upon this record -- because it is undisputed that at least some portion of Schilling's route was in the \nNorthern District. In addition, plaintiffs assert, and defendants do not deny, that discovery has revealed that during the  \n[*11] class period TransCor had contracts with seven law enforcement agencies in the Northern District to transport \nprisoners and pretrial detainees. In contrast, TransCor has closed the Fresno \"hub,\" and TransCor did not have any con-\ntracts to transport prisoner and pretrial detainees in the Middle District of Tennessee. Thus, it is likely that putative class \nmembers were transported throughout the Northern District of California. The Court concludes that based upon these \nfacts, venue is proper in this District. Moreover, any suggestion by defendants that litigating in this District is unfair or \nburdensome is undercut by their willingness to litigate in the Eastern District, which is equally remote from either Okla-\nhoma, where the individual defendants reside, or Tennessee, where TransCor is headquartered. \n\n \n \n3   The parties do not discuss the other named plaintiffs' transport routes. \n \nB. 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)  \n\"For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil matter \nto any other district or division where it might have been brought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). The purpose of § 1404(a) is to \n\"prevent the waste of time, energy, and money and to  [*12] protect litigants, witnesses and the public against unneces-\nsary inconvenience and expense.\" Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 616, 84 S. Ct. 805, 11 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1964) (in-\nternal citations and quotation omitted). A motion for transfer lies within the broad discretion of the district court, and \nmust be determined on an individualized basis. See Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc., 211 F.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000). \nTo support a motion for transfer, the moving party must establish: (1) that venue is proper in the transferor district; \n(2) that the transferee district is one where the action might have been brought; and (3) that the transfer will serve the \nconvenience of the parties and witnesses, and will promote the interests of justice. See Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp., 820 F. Supp. 503, 506 (C.D. Cal. 1992). A motion for transfer lies within the broad discre-\ntion of the district court, and must be determined on an individualized basis. See Jones v. GNC Franchising, Inc., 211 \nF.3d 495, 498 (9th Cir. 2000). \nDefendants contend that the Middle District of Tennessee is more convenient because TransCor witnesses and \ndocuments are located there. However, given the procedural posture of this case, the  [*13] Court finds that transfer \nwould be both inefficient and not in the interest of justice. This case has been pending since February 2008, the parties \nhave engaged in motion practice, and the Court has held three case management conferences. Under the current pretrial \nschedule, plaintiffs are scheduled to file a motion for class certification in December 2009, and the Court will hold a \nhearing on the motion in February 2010. According to plaintiffs' counsel, document discovery is virtually complete, and \nthe parties have cooperated to schedule depositions at convenient times and places, including in Tennessee and Okla-\nhoma. Thus, the only inconvenience to non-California witnesses will be if they are required to testify at trial. Given de-\nfendants' willingness to litigate in the Eastern District of California, any incremental inconvenience caused by traveling \nto the Northern District is marginal at best. \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES defendants' motion to transfer venue. \n \nII. Plaintiffs' motion to file second amended complaint  \nPlaintiffs seek to amend the complaint in several ways. Plaintiffs seek to correct the name of defendant Brummett, \nand to change the place of plaintiff Schilling's residence  [*14] as well as the date of his transport. Plaintiffs also wish to \namend the definition of the class to include pretrial detainees and prisoners whose claims were timely as of February 14, \n2006, despite having accrued more than two years before plaintiffs filed their original complaint, based on the tolling \nprovisions of California Code of Civil Procedure section 352 (limitations period tolled due to the disability of minority \nor insanity) or 352.1 (limitations period tolled for a maximum of two years due to the disability of imprisonment). Fi-\nnally, plaintiffs wish to allege with additional particularity the facts showing that the tolling provisions of California \nCode of Civil Procedure section 352.1 apply to plaintiff Tellez. Defendants only oppose the proposed amendment to the \nclass definition. \nPlaintiffs state that through pre-class certification discovery they have learned that a substantial number of the pris-\noners and detainees transported by TransCor were juveniles and state hospital inmates. Plaintiffs state that in preparing \nto move for class certification, it has come to their attention that the complaint unintentionally excludes potential class \nmembers with timely claims. Plaintiffs  [*15] argue that there is no prejudice to defendants because the additional class \nmembers have the same claims as the original class, and that the proposed amendment does not affect the schedule for \nfiling and hearing the motion for class certification. \nDefendants oppose amending the class definition on several grounds. First, defendants argue that plaintiffs have un-\nreasonably delayed in seeking the current amendment, and they emphasize that plaintiffs have long known through dis-\ncovery that TransCor transported juveniles and state hospital inmates. However, delay alone is not a basis for denying \nleave to amend. See Owens v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc., 244 F.3d 708, 712-713 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"Assuming \narguendo that Kaiser had unreasonably delayed the filing of the motion to amend its answer, undue delay by itself is \ninsufficient to justify denying a motion to amend.\") (internal citation and quotation omitted). Moreover, while defen-\ndants assert that the delay is unjustified, there is no suggestion of bad faith on the part of plaintiffs. \n\n \nDefendants also contend that the revised class definition will cause them prejudice because discovery has been lim-\nited to the class period alleged in  [*16] the complaint -- February 14, 2006 to February 14, 2008 -- and extending the \nclass period may require that eight witnesses will have to be re-deposed to ascertain if TransCor's policies and proce-\ndures were different prior to February 14, 2006. Defendants also assert that they will be required to \"scour\" through \nliterally thousands of pages of documents a second time if the class period is expanded. However, as plaintiffs note, \ndefendants have not offered any evidence in support of their speculation that the witnesses identified by defendants -- \nall of whom are TransCor employees - would need to be re-deposed. Plaintiffs argue that if any witness needs to be re-\ndeposed, that burden falls on plaintiffs, not defendants. Moreover, plaintiffs state that they believe there will be little if \nany additional discovery required. Plaintiffs have submitted the deposition testimony of Sondra Pedrigo, who was des-\nignated by defendants as the \"person most knowledgeable about any and all policies and procedures of TransCor relat-\ning to transportation of prisoners,\" \"the nutrition provided to prisoners during transportation,\" \"prisoner complaints,\" \netc., and who has worked for TransCor for eleven years.  [*17] See Snell Reply Decl. Ex. A. During her testimony, Ms. \nPedrigo testified about certain practices that have been in place since at least 2001 (such as use of black boxes over \nhandcuffs), and she gave no indication that TransCor's policies and practices had changed in material ways over the \nyears. If, in fact, there are material differences pre- and post- February 2006 with regard to TransCor's policies and pro-\ncedures, defendants can easily ascertain that fact because Ms. Pedrigo is a TransCor employee. With regard to docu-\nment discovery, plaintiffs state that in August 2008, plaintiffs requested transport records from TransCor's computer \nsystem dating back to February 2004, and that plaintiffs do not anticipate requiring any discovery other than that already \nserved or noticed prior to filing the class certification motion. \nDefendants also argue that the proposed amendment would be futile because the additional class members will be \ndifficult to identify, and individual tolling-issue inquiries will predominate over common questions. However, as defen-\ndants recognize in their opposition, those are questions for class certification, and the Court finds it premature to resolve \nthose questions  [*18] at this stage. Defendants may renew those arguments in opposition to class certification. \nFinally, the parties dispute whether the proposed amended class definition should relate back to the original com-\nplaint. Defendants argue that the amendment should not relate back because the claims of the additional class members \narise out of different transports in a different time period. Defendants also assert that the original complaint only gave \nthem notice that plaintiffs were challenging TransCor's policies and procedures from February 2006 to February 2008. \nThese arguments are not persuasive. While the additional class members' claims would arise from an earlier time pe-\nriod, the claims are substantively similar to those of the existing putative class, and defendants have not identified any \nmeaningful difference between the pre- and post- February 2006 class members. See Immigrant Assistance Project of \nthe Los Angeles County Federation of Labor v. INS, 306 F.3d 842, 858 (9th Cir. 2002) (addition of new plaintiffs who \nwere similarly situated to original plaintiffs did not prejudice defendants, claims related back). In addition, since the \nfiling of the FAC in August 2008, defendants have  [*19] been aware that plaintiff Tellez's claims arose in August 2005, \nprior to the asserted class period. See FAC PP 30-34 (alleging that Tellez was incarcerated at Federal Penitentiary in \nAtwater, California, and that transports occurred in August 2005 and February 2006). \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES defendants' motion to transfer venue and GRANTS plaintiffs' motion \nto file a second amended complaint. (Docket Nos. 69, 70). Plaintiff shall file an amended complaint no later than Octo-\nber 19, 2009 \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \nDated: October 14, 2009 \n/s/ Susan Illston \nSUSAN ILLSTON \nUnited States District Judge \n ",
