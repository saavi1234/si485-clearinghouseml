    "summary": "<p>On September 29, 1992, plaintiffs, white law school applicants denied admission to the University of Texas Law School, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, against the State of Texas, the Board of Regents of the Texas State University System, the Law School, and a number of individuals in their official capacities in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin Division (Judge Sam Sparks). The plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Individual Rights, asked the Court for injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. Specifically, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants discriminated against them by favoring less qualified black and Mexican American applicants for admission to the University of Texas School of Law through the use of a quota system. </p><p>On October 28, 1993, the Court (Judge Sam Sparks), denied defendants' motions for summary judgment for lack of standing and ripeness and for one plaintiff's failure to maintain eligibility for admission.</p><p>A bench trial began on May 18, 1994. On August 19, 1994, the Court (Judge Sam Sparks) held that the 1992 admissions procedure violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551; 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11870 (W.D. TX. August 19, 1994).  The court ordered that:</p><p>(1) the plaintiffs could reapply and be considered for admission to the law school for the 1995-96 school year without assessment of fees; (2) plaintiffs receive damages in the amount of one dollar each; (3) all further affirmative relief requested by any party herein against any other party was denied including a motion by certain other individuals to intervene. (Docket No. 94-50569.)</p><p>On September 19, 1994, plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. On March 18, 1996, the Fifth Circuit (Judge Jeremy E. Smith), dismissed the intervenors' appeal for want of jurisdiction, reversed the judgment as to the initial plaintiffs, and remanded for further proceedings. Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719 (5th Cir. 1996). The Fifth Circuit held that the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in determining admissions. The Court held that the plaintiffs had satisfied their burden of showing that they were scrutinized under an unconstitutional admissions system. The Fifth Circuit agreed that the plaintiffs were entitled to reapply, and directed the district court to reconsider the question of damages.</p><p>On June 24, 1996, the United States Supreme Court, granted petitioners' motion to consolidate their case with Thurgood Marshall Legal v. Hopwood, 116 S. Ct. 2580, 135 L.Ed. 2d 1094. Texas v. Hopwood, 518 U.S. 1016; 116 S. Ct. 2545 (1996).</p><p>On July 26, 1996, the Fifth Circuit, vacated the District Court opinion.  Hopwood v. Texas, 95 F.3d 53; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 22891 (5th Cir. 1996).</p><p>On March 20, 1998, on rehearing, the Court (Judge Sparks) entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and ordering damages in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) each, and enjoining Defendants from considering race in the admission process. The Court awarded plaintiffs  $703,992 in attorneys' fees and $571,768 in costs. Hopwood v. Texas, 999 F. Supp. 872 (W.D. TX 1998).</p><p>On December 21, 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit made findings on the District Court's decision on remand. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court finding that Texas had proved that the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of being offered admission to the Law School in 1992 under a constitutionally valid, race-blind admissions system.  Further, the Court of Appeals found that the District Court failed to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(a) when it failed to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law to justify its injunction prohibiting absolutely the use of race as a factor in the admissions process. The Fifth Circuit reversed the court's grant of the injunction and remanded for further proceedings but affirmed the district court's rulings on attorneys' fees and costs.  Hopwood v. Texas, 236 F.3d 256 (5th Cir. 2000.) </p><p>On January 17, 2001, the United States Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for Panel Rehearing. Hopwood v. Texas, 248 F.3d 1141 (5th Cir. 2001). </p><p>On June 24, 2001, the United States Supreme Court (Judge William Rehnquist) denied the petition for certiorari. Hopwood v. Texas, 533 U.S. 929 (2001). On July 24, 2001, the District Court closed the file, finding no viable issues remaining to be litigated. Hopwood v. Texas, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10658 (W.D. TX 2001).</p><p></p>",

Its membership is comprised of law stu-\ndents, predominantly African-American, currently in attendance at the law school. One of the goals of the orga-\nnization, according to the affidavit of the organization's current president, is to encourage the admission of \ngreater numbers of African-American students to the law school. \nThe Black Pre-Law Association, an organization of African-American undergraduate students currently at-\ntending the University of Texas, is comprised of students who have applied or who may apply to law school. A \ncentral goal of the organization, according to the affidavit of the current president, is to promote African-\nAmerican students' interest in the law and to assist them in the application and admission process. \n [*4]  \n2   Not surprisingly, the Plaintiffs are opposed to the intervention; the Defendants are not. \nThis is a lawsuit in which four individuals contend they were denied admission to the University of Texas School \nof Law because of a racially discriminatory admission policy. The initial lawsuit was filed in September 1992. A some-\nwhat lengthy and strongly argued debate on the issues of standing and ripeness soon ensued, which culminated in this \nCourt's denial of the Defendants' motions for summary judgment by order dated October 28, 1993. In November 1993, \nbecause of some confusion by the parties regarding the posture of the cause and because of the Court's concern with \nefficiently moving the cause to trial, the Court set deadlines for pleading and motion filings, as well as for discovery. Of \nconsequence to the motion now before the Court are the deadlines of March 11, 1994, for a final pretrial status confer-\nence to address pretrial issues and set a trial date; of April 1, 1994, for the completion of discovery; and of April 15, \n1994, for a joint pretrial order to be filed. Now, with only a little over [*5]  two months to go before the completion of \ndiscovery, which has already been a contentious process and evidently involves a multitude of documents, two new \nentities wish to become parties to the litigation. \nThe prospective intervenors seek intervention both under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), which provides \nfor intervention as a matter of right, and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b), which provides for permissive \n \n\n \nintervention. In seeking intervention, the prospective intervenors basically claim they have a substantial interest in pro-\ntecting the law school's affirmative-action admissions program that will not be adequately protected the Defendants. \nFor intervention under Rule 24(a), the movant must meet the following requirements: (1) the motion must be \ntimely; (2) the movant must have an interest relating to the transaction that is the subject of the ongoing action; (3) the \nmovant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its \ninterest in the litigation; and (4) the movant's interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties to the litiga-\ntion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a); Bush v. Viterna, 740 F.2d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 1984). [*6]  If a prospective intervenor fails \nto meet any one of the requirements, it cannot intervene as a matter of right. Bush, 740 F.2d at 354. \nThe prospective intervenors contend their specific interest in promoting the legal education for African Americans \nis not adequately represented by the Defendants, who have historically acted in a manner adverse to the interests of the \nproposed intervenors. However, as a practical matter, the prospective intervenors and the Defendants have the same \nultimate objective in this lawsuit -- the preservation of the admissions policy and procedure currently used by the law \nschool. \nWhen a prospective intervenor \"has the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit, a presumption arises that its \ninterests are adequately represented, against which the petitioner must demonstrate adversity of interest, collusion, or \nnonfeasance.\" Id. at 355 (citation omitted). While the presumption of adequate representation may be rebutted on a rela-\ntively minimal showing, the prospective intervenors must \"produce something more than speculation as to the purported \ninadequacy.\" Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips Corp., 610 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 1979). [*7]  Further, the poten-\ntial obstruction and delay that may be caused by allowing intervention fully justifies a requirement that a clear showing \nrather than a mere allegation that prospective intervenors' interests will not be adequately represented by an existing \nparty be made. United States v. Int'l Tel & Tel. Corp., 349 F. Supp. 22, 27 n.4 (D.C. Conn. 1972), aff'd sub nom. Nader \nv. United States, 410 U.S. 919, 35 L. Ed. 2d 582, 93 S. Ct. 1363 (1973). \nThe Court finds the prospective intervenors have not overcome the presumption of adequate representation. Fur-\nther, the Defendants have demonstrated they have sufficient motivation and ability to defend vigorously the current ad-\nmissions policy. Because this Court finds the prospective intervenors have failed to overcome the fourth test for inter-\nvention, inadequate representation by the Defendants, the prospective intervenors are not entitled to intervene as a mat-\nter of right. \nIn making a determination of whether to allow permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), a court must determine if \nthree conditions are met: (1) the movant must show an independent ground for jurisdiction; (2) the motion must be \ntimely;  [*8]  and (3) the movant's claim or defense and the main action must have a question of law or fact in common. \nVenegas v. Skaggs, 867 F.2d 527, 529 (9th Cir. 1989), aff'd sub nom. Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 109 L. Ed. 2d \n74, 110 S. Ct. 1679 (1990). Additionally, a court must consider whether the intervention will \"unduly delay or prejudice \nthe adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" See Fed R. Civ. P. 24(b). \nThe prospective intervenors contend that, because they seek to raise defenses sharing common factual and legal \nquestions with the main action, they are entitled to permissive intervention. However, the existence of a common ques-\ntion of law or fact will not automatically entitle a movant to intervene; the district court has the discretion to determine \nthe fairest and most efficient method of handling the lawsuit. Venegas, 867 F.2d at 530; see also Bush, 740 F.2d at 354 \n(permissive intervention wholly discretionary even if common question of law or fact or requirements of Rule 24(b) \notherwise satisfied). Further, as discussed above, the Court has found the interests of the prospective intervenors [*9]  \nare adequately represented by the Defendants; adding the prospective intervenors as defendants at this juncture in the \nlawsuit would needlessly increase cost and delay disposition of the litigation. 3 \n \n3   The Court believes the appropriate role for the prospective intervenors, if any, in this lawsuit is as amicus cu-\nriae. However, the prospective intervenors have not requested amicus curiae status. \nAccordingly, the Court enters the following order: \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion of Thurgood Marshall Legal Society and Black Pre-Law Association to Intervene \nas Defendants is DENIED without prejudice to seeking leave to participate as amicus curiae. \nSIGNED this the 19th day of January 1994. \nSAM SPARKS \n \n\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \n ",

The first appeal \n(\"Hopwood I\") was interlocutory and affirmed the district court's denial of intervention sought by several minority \nrights advocacy organizations. 1 The second appeal (\"Hopwood  [*261]  II\") followed the district court's judgment on \nthe merits (\"Hopwood A\") 2 of the individual claims of Plaintiffs-Appellants-Cross-Appellees, Cheryl J. Hopwood and \nDouglas Carvell, and Plaintiffs-Appellees-Cross-Appellants, Kenneth Elliott and David Rogers (collectively, the \"Plain-\ntiffs\"), against Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants-Cross-Appellees, The University of Texas at Austin (the \"Uni-\nversity\"), the University of Texas School of Law (the \"Law School\"), and the State of Texas, the Board of Regents of \nthe [**2]  University and its President, and the Dean and the Assistant Dean of the Law School (collectively, \"Texas\"), \ngrounded in the denial of the Plaintiffs' admission to the Law School. 3 Now, in \"Hopwood III,\" each of the parties either \n\n \nappeals or cross-appeals one or more of the district court rulings made at the conclusion of an extensive bench trial 4 \nconducted pursuant to our remand from Hopwood II. As a broad generalization, three areas dealt with by the district \ncourt in Hopwood B are implicated in this appeal: That court's (1) ultimate finding of fact that none of the Plaintiffs had \na realistic chance of being offered admission to the Law School in 1992, even under a constitutionally valid, race-blind \nadmissions program; (2) rulings on attorneys' fees; and (3) grant of an injunction prohibiting any consideration of race \nwhatsoever in the Law School's admissions process. In addition, Texas would have us disregard the law of the case doc-\ntrine and reverse the prior panel's decision in Hopwood II. We set forth below our reasons for affirming (1) the district \ncourt's factual findings that the Plaintiffs would not have been offered admission in 1992 under a race-blind [**3]  sys-\ntem, and (2) that court's awards of attorneys' fees. We also express our reasons for declining to reconsider the substance \nof Hopwood II, and for reversing the court's injunction against any consideration of race in the Law School's admission \nprocess and remanding that issue for further consistent proceedings. \n \n1   Hopwood v. Texas, 21 F.3d 603 (5th Cir. 1994)(\"Hopwood I\"), aff'g Hopwood v. Texas, No. Civ. A-92-CA-\n563-SS, 1994 WL 242362 at *1 (W.D. Tex Jan. 20, 1994). \n2   Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551 (W.D. Tex 1994)(\"Hopwood A\"). \n3   Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir.), cert. denied 518 U.S. 1033, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1095, 116 S. Ct. 2581 \n(1996) (\"Hopwood II\"). \n4   Hopwood v. Texas, 999 F. Supp. 872 (W.D. Tex 1998)(\"Hopwood B\"). \n \nI.  \nFACTS AND PROCEDURE \nIn Hopwood A, the case underlying the Hopwood II appeal, the district court held that the Plaintiffs had failed [**4]  \nto establish by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have been offered admission to the Law School under a \nconstitutional admissions system. 5 On appeal, a panel of this court held that, under the burden-shifting scheme of Mt. \nHealthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, 6 the Law School must bear the burden of proving by a pre-\nponderance of the evidence that, even under a race-blind admissions system, the Plaintiffs would not have been offered \nadmission. 7 The Hopwood II panel 8 stated that, \"in the event that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance \nof the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admis-\nsions system, the court is to  [*262]  award to that plaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\" 9 \n \n5   Hopwood A, 861 F. Supp. 551 (W.D. Tex. 1994). \n6   429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977). \n7   See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 956-57. \n8   As Judge Wiener specially concurred in Hopwood II, differing with portions of the panel majority's reasoning \nand parts of its judgment, references in this opinion to the holdings of the \"panel\" in Hopwood II do not always \nreflect those of a unanimous panel. \n [**5]  \n9   Id. at 957. \nIn the spring of 1997, following remand from Hopwood II, the district court conducted a four-day bench trial. The \nLaw School called one expert witness on the question of causation, i.e., what caused the Plaintiffs to be denied admis-\nsion in 1992 and whether they would have been offered admission under a race-blind system. That witness was Profes-\nsor Olin Guy Wellborn, a faculty member of the Law School. He presented both a primary report and a supplemental \nreport analyzing whether the Plaintiffs would have been admitted under a constitutional, race-blind admissions system, \nconcluding that none of the four plaintiffs would have been. After considering Professor Wellborn's reports and testi-\nmony, as well as the testimony of several members of the Law School's admissions committee and the Plaintiffs them-\nselves, the district court found that the Law School had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that none of the \nPlaintiffs would have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions system. 10 \n \n10   Id. 999 F. Supp. at 879. \n [**6]  The district court nevertheless proceeded to make alternative factual findings and legal conclusions on the \nissue of damages. These would only be used in the event that the Plaintiffs should be successful in an appeal     this ap-\npeal     of the trial court's causation findings. 11 Finally, the district court entered a permanent injunction prohibiting any \nconsideration of race, for any purpose, in the Law School's admissions process. \n\n \n \n11   In these conditional damages findings, the court concluded that (1) each Plaintiff would be entitled to one \ndollar in nominal damages, id. 999 F. Supp. at 923; (2) Hopwood would not be entitled to any economic dam-\nages but would be entitled to $ 6,000 for mental anguish, id. at 906, 908; (3) Carvell would be entitled to $ \n40,036 in economic damages, being the difference between the tuition at the Law School and the tuition at \nSouthern Methodist University where Carvell attended law school, id. at 909; but that Carvell did not suffer any \ncompensable emotional injuries, id. at 910; and (4) Rogers and Elliott would not be awarded any economic \ndamages, id. at 910-11.  \n [**7]  Following the initial trial of this action in Hopwood A, the Plaintiffs had requested an award of attorneys' \nfees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ß 1988. 12 The district court denied the request, finding that the Plaintiffs, \"although prevail-\ning parties under the statute, only attained de minimis relief.\" 13 When the adverse rulings in Hopwood A were appealed \nto us, we reversed and remanded the attorneys' fees issue with instructions for the district court to award reasonable \nattorneys' fees. 14 Before the commencement of the Hopwood B bench trial on remand, the district court entertained sup-\nplemental applications for attorneys' fees and made its final decision on the issue in the memorandum opinion resolving \nthe matters raised at that trial. 15 \n \n12   See Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 911. \n13   See id. \n14   Hopwood v. Texas, No. 95-50062 (5th Cir. May 17, 1996)(order vacating judgment denying attorneys' fees \nand remanding with instructions that reasonable attorneys' fees should be granted). \n15   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 923-24. \n [**8]  The Plaintiffs sought $ 853,847.69 for their counsel in payment for 4,840.56 hours of work related to the \nMay, 1994 trial of Hopwood A. They also asked for $ 614,138.56 for their counsel in payment for 2400.85 hours of \nwork related to the appellate phase of this litigation. The district court denied the portions of the fee request for time \nspent on (1) public and media relations, (2) opposing the attempted interventions by the Thurgood Marshall Legal Soci-\nety, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and \nEducational Fund, and (3) any legal work done after our remand in Hopwood II because the Plaintiffs were not prevail-\ning  [*263]  parties as to any issues resolved after that remand. The court reduced the number of hours spent for travel \nby one-half to reflect its judgment that travel should be billed at a lower rate than active legal work, and reduced all \nhours submitted by the Plaintiffs' counsel by twenty-five percent to account for duplicative work product and lack of \nbilling judgment. 16 The court then reviewed current billing rates for each of the Plaintiffs' counsel 17 and reduced all \nsubmitted rates for the stated purpose [**9]  of bringing those rates more into line with the prevailing legal market rate \nin the Austin, Texas trial venue. After multiplying the adjusted number of hours by the adjusted hourly rates, the district \ncourt arrived at tentative fee awards for each of the Plaintiffs' counsel. It then reduced the tentative awards for the trial \nattorneys by fifteen percent to reflect the lack of success in obtaining any injunctive or monetary relief for the Plaintiffs \nindividually. The court concluded its task with numerous tables displaying the relevant calculations. 18 This appeal fol-\nlowed. \n \n16   The district court reduced the Center for Individual Rights' hours by thirty-five per cent, finding its \"pad-\nding\" to be worse than that of the others. \n17   The district court used current rates to compensate for delay in payment. \n18   See Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 919-23. \n \nII.  \nANALYSIS \nA. Admission to the Law School \n \n1. Standard of Review  \nThe district court's determination that the Plaintiffs would [**10]  not have been admitted to the Law School under \na constitutional admissions system is a question of fact, which we review for clear error. 19 We review de novo whether \nthe district court faithfully and accurately applied our instructions on the burden of proof on remand from Hopwood II. \n20 We review for clear error the district court's weighing of the evidence in light of the burden of proof. 21 \n \n\n \n19   See, e.g., East Jefferson Coalition for Leadership and Development v. Parish of Jefferson, 926 F.2d 487, \n491 (5th Cir. 1991) (finding that the district court's determination of whether preconditions for a claim under the \nVoting Rights Act had been satisfied was a question a fact to be reviewed for clear error).  \n20   See Odom v. Frank, 3 F.3d 839, 843 (5th Cir. 1993) (concluding that in an appeal from a bench trial, we re-\nview issues of law de novo). \n21   Id. \n \n2. Burden of Proof  \nThe Hopwood II panel noted that, even though as a general rule [**11]  plaintiffs seeking money damages must \nbear the burden of proving that they have been injured, there can be a shift of burden on proof of discrimination. 22 That \npanel concluded that the Mt. Healthy methodology is appropriate in this case, and that under that methodology's burden-\nshifting minuet, the Law School should have a chance to prevail by showing, through a preponderance of the evidence, \nthat it would have reached the same admission decisions even in the absence of unconstitutional conduct. 23 The Hop-\nwood II panel stated that \" in the event that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a \nrespective plaintiff would not have been admitted under a constitutional admissions system, the court is to award that \nplaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\" 24 \n \n22   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 956. \n23   Id. at 956-57. \n24   Id. at 957. \nThe Plaintiffs argue that on remand the district court failed [**12]  to follow the Hopwood II panel's instructions on \nburden of proof, pointing to, among other things, the district court's criticism of the panel's instruction to use the Mt. \nHealthy burden-shifting  [*264]  methodology. The Plaintiffs insist that if the district court had followed the panel's \ninstructions faithfully by requiring the Law School to carry the burden of proof, Texas could not have prevailed because \nthe burden was \"impossible\" to carry. We disagree. \nFirst, even though the district court did express its disagreement with our instruction to apply the Mt.Healthy analy-\nsis, 25 there is no indication from the record that, despite having voiced its criticism, the district court failed to follow the \npanel's instructions. The court proclaimed that \"the Court is cognizant, however, of the panel's instructions on remand, \nand it will faithfully and responsibly execute them.\" 26 Our review of the record demonstrates that in fact the court did \nfaithfully and responsibly apply the Mt. Healthy burden as instructed. The Law School put forth plenteous evidence in \nthe form of Professor Wellborn's expert reports, as well as affidavits and testimony from admissions committee mem-\nbers,  [**13]  in support of the proposition that the Plaintiffs would not have been admitted to the Law School in 1992 \nunder a race-blind admissions procedure. In sum, the district court expressly disagreed with our remand instructions \nregarding application of Mt. Healthy but it clearly followed them. \n \n25   The district court included a lengthy discussion of its own views on the applicability of the Mt. Healthy \nanalysis. See Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 883-885. It observed that, among other things, the panel's analysis \nwas incomplete because it presupposed that race was a substantial or motivating factor in every denial of a non-\nminority candidate's application for admission, regardless of the applicant's qualifications.  Id. at 883. The dis-\ntrict court noted that mathematically this could not be true: Even if all 96 offers of admission made to minorities \nhad been made to nonminorities, approximately 1400 nonminority applicants would still have been denied ad-\nmission. Id. Therefore, said the court, only 7 percent of resident nonminority applicants were affected by the \nLaw School's use of racial preferences. Id. \n [**14]  \n26   Id. at 884-85 (emphasis added). \nNext, the Plaintiffs argue that if the district court had faithfully applied the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting analysis, it \nwould have had to find that the burden was \"impossible\" for the Law School to carry. The Plaintiffs note that in his \noriginal 1994 judgment, Hopwood A, the same district judge stated that \"it is virtually impossible to establish the out-\ncome of a comparison of the plaintiffs' applications against the other applicants, whether minority or nonminority.\" 27 \nThe Plaintiffs also refer us to statements by several of the Law School's administrators and admissions committee mem-\nbers voicing the opinion that to determine whether a candidate would have been admitted under a race-blind system \nwould require starting the admissions process over and reexamining every file. \n \n\n \n27   Hopwood A, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.86. \nWe do not share the Plaintiffs'  [**15]  interpretation of the Hopwood II instructions. That opinion merely requires \nthat the Law School carry its burden using \"a constitutional admissions system.\" 28 Nowhere does it state that the Law \nSchool must replicate the 1992 admissions process in its entirety or that review of every file is required if the Law \nSchool were to meet its proof burden. Furthermore, we find no jurisprudential support for the proposition that a defen-\ndant must employ any particular evaluation system or method to carry its burden of proof in a discrimination case. \nStatements by Law School officials recognized that recreating the 1992 process would have been extremely difficult. \nMoreover, because doing that was not mandated by Hopwood II or by precedent, the district court on remand did not err \nin allowing the Law School to try to meet its burden of proof through the demonstrated application of a hypothetical \nsystem free of racial preferences. In other words, the district court committed no error by allowing the Law School to \nattempt  [*265]  to meet its Mt. Healthy burden without replicating the 1992 admissions process. \n \n28   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957. \n [**16]  3. Admission Under a Race-Blind System \na. 1992 Admissions Procedure \nTo evaluate the quality of Professor Wellborn's testimony, we must start with an understanding of the admission \nprocedure that was employed by the Law School in 1992, when the Plaintiffs applied. In that year, the Law School re-\nceived 4,494 applications for approximately 500 available seats. Initially, each application was assigned to one of the \nthree administrative categories, based solely on the applicant's Texas Index (\"TI\") score. The TI score is determined \nindependently by the Law School Data Assembly Service (\"LSDAS\") using the applicant's undergraduate grade point \naverage (\"GPA\") and Law School Admissions Test (\"LSAT\") score. The three categories were (1) presumptive admit, \n(2) discretionary zone, and (3) presumptive deny. \nThe TI scores needed for placement in the various categories were lower for minority 29 applicants than for nonmi-\nnority applicants. Professor Stanley Johanson chaired the admissions committee in 1992 and had sole responsibility for \nsetting the cutoff scores for the three categories. In 1992, these cutoff scores were adjusted several times to increase the \nnumber of presumptive [**17]  admits. By March 1992, Professor Johanson had set the presumptive admit threshold for \nnonminority applicants at a TI score of 199 and the presumptive denial ceiling for those applicants at 192. 30 All appli-\ncants with scores between 192 and 199 went into the discretionary category. For minority applicants, however, the pre-\nsumptive admit threshold was 192 and the presumptive denial ceiling was 179. 31 Once an application had been placed \nin one of the three administrative categories, it was subject to different procedures for determining whether admission \nwould be offered. \n \n29   The term \"minority\" as used in the Law School's admissions procedure refers only to African Americans \nand Mexican Americans. \n30   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 880 (citation omitted). \n31   Id.(citation omitted). \ni. Presumptive Admits \nThe file of a presumptive admit application would be reviewed by Professor Johanson to ensure that the TI score \nwas not artificially inflated by a high GPA from a noncompetitive [**18]  college or university or by a noncompetitive \nmajor. 32 Any presumptive admit applicants whom he found to have \"questionable files\" were lowered to the discretion-\nary zone for further review. 33 The rest of the applicants in the presumptive admit category were offered admission by \nProfessor Johanson without consultation with other members of the admissions committee. 34 \n \n32   Id. (citation omitted). \n33   Id. (citation omitted). \n34   Id. (citation omitted). \nii. Discretionary Zone \nThe nonminority applications in the discretionary zone were separated into groups of thirty, and each group was \nthen reviewed by three members of the admissions committee. 35 Each group's three committee members would inde-\npendently review every file in that group of thirty. Each committee member could vote to offer admission to approxi-\nmately nine of the thirty applicants whose files that he or she reviewed. Applicants in the discretionary zone who re-\n\n \nceived either two or three favorable votes were offered admission;  [**19]  those who received one favorable vote were \nplaced on the waiting list; and those  [*266]  who received no favorable votes were turned down. \n \n35   The admissions committee in 1992 included nine professors, two assistant deans, and four students.  Hop-\nwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 879. \niii. Minority Applicants \nThree members of the admissions committee served on a special minority subcommittee that reviewed the files of \nall minority applicants in the discretionary zone. 36 This subcommittee would identify minority applicants whom they \ndeemed to be strong candidates for admission and would prepare summaries of each for review by the full admissions \ncommittee. \n \n36   Id. at 880. \niv. The Plaintiffs \nPlaintiff Hopwood had a TI score of 199. She had been graduated from California State University-Sacramento \nwith a GPA of 3.8 [**20]  and an LSAT score in the 83rd percentile and had received an associate's degree in account-\ning from Montgomery County Community College. Hopwood's TI score of 199 placed her in the presumptive admit \ncategory; however, after reviewing her file, Professor Johanson downgraded her application to the discretionary zone, \nconcluding that her GPA was inflated by the noncompetitive nature of her community college and undergraduate uni-\nversity. 37 On review by three members of the admissions committee, Hopwood received one vote. This one vote, cast \nby Assistant Dean Laquita Hamilton, put Hopwood on the waiting list, 38 from which she was ultimately denied admis-\nsion. \n \n37   Id. at 881. \n38   In 1992, there were separate waiting lists for minority and nonminority applicants.  \nPlaintiff Carvell had a TI score of 197, which placed him in the discretionary zone. Carvell had been graduated \nfrom Hendrix College in Arkansas with a degree in political science and a GPA of 3.28. He took the LSAT twice, scor-\ning in [**21]  the 61st percentile the first time, and in the 91st percentile the second time. His 197 TI score reflects only \nthe second, higher LSAT score 39; when averaged, his LSAT score would have placed him in the 76th percentile. Carvell \nreceived one vote for admission from a student member of the admissions committee, presumably placing him on the \nwaiting list, from which he never received an offer of admission. \n \n39   Id. at 881 n.18. \nPlaintiff Elliott also had a TI score of 197, placing him in the discretionary zone. He had been graduated from the \nUniversity with a bachelor's degree in accounting. He had a GPA of 2.98 and scored in the 95th percentile on his LSAT, \nbut received no votes for admission. This resulted in his automatic denial of admission. \nPlaintiff Rogers also had a TI score of 197 which placed him in the discretionary category. He had been graduated \nfrom the University of Houston-Downtown (UH-D) with a degree in professional writing. Before attending UH-D, he \nhad attended the University,  [**22]  where he was placed on academic probation once and dismissed twice for failing \ngrades. Rogers's GPA at UH-D was 3.13 and his LSAT was in the 94th percentile, but he received no votes for admis-\nsion. \nThe median GPA for all students entering the Law School from the 1992 admissions process was 3.52 and the me-\ndian LSAT score was in the 89th percentile. The Law School offered admission to 637 Texas residents, of which 541 \nwere nonminority applicants and 96 were minority applicants. 40 \n \n40   Id. \nb. Expert Report and Testimony \nThe Law School proffered Professor Wellborn as an expert witness on the question whether the Plaintiffs would \nhave been admitted to the Law School under a race-blind admissions procedure. Professor Wellborn is a tenured faculty \nmember of the Law School and has served on the  [*267]  admissions committee since 1979, having chaired it in 1992. \n\n \nAs the foundation for his trial testimony, Professor Wellborn presented a long and comprehensive expert report which \nwas followed by a supplemental expert [**23]  report. \ni. Primary Report \nIn his primary report, Professor Wellborn analyzed the way that the 1992 admissions procedure operated with re-\nspect to nonminority candidates. He then demonstrated how that procedure, if extended to all candidates, would yield \nthe same total number of admission offers under a race-blind system. Professor Wellborn also explained the relationship \nbetween the TI scores and offers of admission to resident nonminority applicants, concluding that 89 percent of such \napplicants with Hopwood's TI score of 199 were admitted. He also showed that, of all candidates with a TI score of 197 \n(as achieved by Carvell, Elliott, and Rogers), only 59 percent were admitted. Professor Wellborn then determined that if \nthis exact procedure were used for all 1992 applicants, regardless of race or ethnicity, too few offers would have been \nforthcoming. Consequently, he lowered the presumptive admit threshold from 199 to 198 and determined that 90 per-\ncent of the applicants with TI scores between 196 and 199 would be admitted, and that 70 percent of the applicants with \na TI score of 197 would be admitted. \nProfessor Wellborn found that 61 of the 68 applicants with Hopwood's TI score [**24]  of 199 were admitted, in-\ncluding four minority applicants. He postulated that, under a race-blind system, there would have been one more offer \nof admission. He then compared the four admitted minority applicants, Hopwood, and the other denied nonminority \napplicants, as potential candidates for this one additional spot. Professor Wellborn demonstrated that (1) all four minor-\nity applicants were \"clearly stronger\" candidates for admission than Hopwood, (2) three of the denied nonminority ap-\nplicants were clearly stronger than Hopwood, and (3) two more denied nonminority applicants were comparable to her. \nProfessor Wellborn concluded that, just as it was in the actual 1992 process, Hopwood's file would have been placed in \nthe discretionary voting zone, and in the end she would not have received an offer of admission. \nProfessor Wellborn found that 45 of 72 applicants at Plaintiffs Carvell, Elliott, and Rogers's TI score level of 197, \nincluding one minority applicant, had been offered admission. He projected that under a race-blind system, six addi-\ntional offers would have been made at the 197 TI level. Professor Wellborn then compared the files of the one admitted \nminority candidate, the [**25]  three Plaintiffs who had 197 TI scores, and the remaining nonminority applicants with \nthat score who had been denied admission. As a result of this exercise, Professor Wellborn concluded that the minority \napplicant would not have been admitted, and that there would have been a total of seven additional offers at the 197 TI \nlevel. He observed that seven of these nonminority applicants stood out as the strongest, all of whom were stronger than \nHopwood and the other three Plaintiffs. Additionally, Professor Wellborn identified four more applicants at the 197 TI \nlevel who were stronger than Carvell, Rogers, and Elliott, adding that Elliott and Rogers were among the weakest appli-\ncants at the 197 level. He offered his opinion that, although Carvell was a stronger applicant than Elliott and Rogers, \nCarvell still would have been in the bottom half of all applicants with TI scores of 197. Professor Wellborn also ex-\nplained that because Carvell took the LSAT twice, his scores should have been averaged by the LSDAS, which would \nhave placed him in a lower TI index group from the start. \nii. Supplemental Report \nProfessor Wellborn was asked to identify (1) all 1992 resident minority (African-American [**26]  and Mexican-\nAmerican) admittees who would likely have been denied  [*268]  admission in a race-blind process and (2) all resident \nnonminority applicants who were denied admission but would have been offered admission in a race-blind process, \nahead of the minority applicants identified in the answer to question (1). He did this in his supplemental report. \nProfessor Wellborn testified that, in completing this analysis, he examined the LSDAS reports of all admitted mi-\nnority applicants and all denied nonminority applicants with a TI score above 190, and that he then examined the files 41 \nof those who appeared to be viable candidates based on the LSDAS report. In examining the reports and files, Professor \nWellborn applied identical standards to the minority and nonminority candidates and considered the criteria that the \nLaw School had previously identified as standards used for admission. He explained that the most important factors for \nadmission are the LSAT score and undergraduate academic record, which are weighted about equally. He stated further \nthat the personal statement, letters of recommendation, and other materials in the file can be important in some in-\nstances. In addition, Professor [**27]  Wellborn acknowledged that even though the LSDAS treats all GPAs alike for \npurposes of calculating the TI index score, file reviewers customarily take cognizance of the applicant's class rank and \nmajor, the mean LSAT score for the applicant's college, and the applicant's college transcript. 42 He added that compar-\ning the colleges' mean LSAT scores is the best way of evaluating the various colleges and universities in terms of the \ncaliber of their respective student bodies. 43 \n \n\n \n41   Files include the applicant's personal statement, letters of recommendation, and application. \n42   The applicant's class rank, major, and the LSAT mean for the college are all shown on the LSDAS report. \n43   The college LSAT mean is the average LSAT score of students from that college. See Hopwood B, 999 F. \nSupp. at 888 n.34. \nWhen Professor Wellborn completed his examination of these files, he identified 18 minority applicants who, in his \nopinion, would likely have been admitted without regard to race, and [**28]  two more minority applicants who, al-\nthough weaker than the 18, might have been admitted. He labeled the first 18 minority applicants Group A and the two \nadditional minority applicants as Group B. \nProfessor Wellborn next noted that the Law School made 96 offers of admission to resident minority applicants in \n1992. After subtracting the 18 from Group A (those whom Professor Wellborn determined probably would be admitted \nunder a race-blind system), 78 offered places remained available for denied nonminority applicants. In 1992, 398 non-\nminority Texas residents with TI indexes above 190 (including the four Plaintiffs) were denied admission. Therefore, \nconcluded Professor Wellborn, fewer than twenty percent of these 398 candidates would have received one of the 78 \nadditional offers of admission under a race-blind system. He also examined the LSDAS reports for each of the 398 resi-\ndent nonminority applicants with a TI score above 190 who had been denied admission, then examined the files of those \napplicants among the 398 who, based on his review of the LSDAS report, appeared to be viable candidates. From \namong those, Professor Wellborn narrowed the remaining nonminority applicants to the [**29]  78 whom he found to \nbe the best candidates. He identified these 78 applicants as Group C, then selected the next-best 20 applicants and iden-\ntified them as Group D. None of the Plaintiffs qualified for inclusion in Group C or Group D. He testified that his com-\nparison of the files of all applicants in the four identified groups further confirmed the weakness of the Plaintiffs' appli-\ncations. \nAfter completing the selection of the 118 applicants comprising his four groups, Professor Wellborn identified four \ncommon  [*269]  characteristics: (1) an LSAT in the 80th percentile or higher; (2) a college class rank in the 60th per-\ncentile or higher; (3) graduation from a college with an LSAT mean of 30 or higher; and (4) no more than one year in a \ncommunity or junior college. He went on to explain his reasons for selecting any applicants who did not meet one of \nthese criteria. \nFinally, Professor Wellborn identified the specific weaknesses in each of the Plaintiffs' files that, in his opinion, \nwould have adversely affected their chances of being offered admission. He noted that Plaintiff Elliott was in the bottom \nhalf of his class at the University and had no letters of recommendation from faculty. Professor [**30]  Wellborn also \npointed out that only one presumptive admit in Group A had a class rank as low as Elliott's. \nProfessor Wellborn observed that Plaintiff Rogers's college record was a \"worse liability\" than Elliott's. He ex-\nplained that over the course of three separate stints at the University, Elliott had been placed on scholastic probation \nonce and dismissed for academic failure twice. Professor Wellborn remarked that, although Elliott subsequently did \nachieve a high GPA at UH-D, this school had a \"strikingly low\" LSAT college mean of 26, adding that an LSAT col-\nlege mean of 26 was among the lowest he had seen during his many years of service on the Law School admissions \ncommittee. He also noted that Rogers's file contained no letters of recommendation. \nProfessor Wellborn reported that Hopwood's degree school, Cal State at Sacramento, had an LSAT college mean of \n28, and that 60 of her credits were from a community college. He acknowledged that Hopwood's LSAT score in the \n83rd percentile would be adequate if combined with a reliable college record, but that alone her LSAT was not high \nenough to overcome the doubts raised by her undergraduate background. Professor Wellborn also mentioned [**31]  \nthat Hopwood's file contained no letters of recommendation. \nIn analyzing Plaintiff Carvell's application, Professor Wellborn observed that when this candidate's two LSAT \nscores are averaged, he has a score in the 76th percentile. Professor Wellborn acknowledged that some of the applicants \nin his four groupings had low LSAT scores, but explained that in each instance the weak LSAT was counterbalanced by \na \"very strong\" college performance. Professor Wellborn contrasted Carvell's college record, noting that Carvell was in \nthe 59th percentile at a college with an LSAT mean score of 32. He also characterized Carvell's two faculty letters of \nrecommendation as ranging between \"unimpressive to downright negative.\" \nc. Plaintiffs' View of Texas's Evidence \nThe Plaintiffs proffered no expert witness of their own, electing instead to attack the work of Professor Wellborn. \nThey ultimately argue that Professor Wellborn's analysis was not \"remotely adequate\" to carry the Defendants' burden. \nAs we have noted, the district court's eventual determination whether the Law School carried its burden of establishing \n\n \nthat the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of being offered admission [**32]  under a race-blind admis-\nsions system is a question of fact that we review for clear error. 44 \n \n44   Odom, 3 F.3d at 843. \nPlaintiffs Carvell and Hopwood argue that Professor Wellborn's supplemental report is unreliable because he began \nits analysis by using these Plaintiffs' applications as a \"floor,\" then seeking to identify applications that were stronger. \nHopwood and Carvell also contend that Professor Wellborn cherry-picked aspects of the 1992 system, embracing those \nthat favored his position while ignoring or rejecting aspects that were unfavorable. They point to his assumption that all \nof the nonminority applicants who were admitted in 1992 would  [*270]  have been admitted under a race-blind system \nand his rejection of the possibility that Hopwood and Carvell, who received one vote each, would have been selected \nahead of candidates who received no votes. \nTo repeat, the Hopwood II panel's remand instructions did not require the Law School to replicate precisely the ad-\nmissions system that it had [**33]  employed in 1992; rather, the Law School was simply required to use any reason-\nable race-blind system. Professor Wellborn clearly stated in his supplemental report that in his evaluation he used the \nsame criteria for minority and nonminority applicants alike. The assumption in his supplemental report that only 96 \nseats would have been open for admission because all nonminority applicants admitted in 1992 would have been admit-\nted under a race-blind system is logical. Not even the Plaintiffs dispute that it was more difficult for nonminority appli-\ncants to gain admission in 1992 than it would have been under a race-blind system; indeed, that is at the core of their \nargument of reverse discrimination. It is therefore logical to conclude that those nonminority applicants who were ad-\nmitted in 1992 would have been admitted under a race-blind system. \nHopwood and Carvell nevertheless contend that Professor Wellborn's assumption that the nonminority candidates \nwho were admitted in 1992 would have been admitted under a race-blind system is inconsistent with his refusal to con-\nsider the fact that Hopwood and Carvell received one vote each in 1992, placing them on a waiting list. 45 The flaw in \n[**34]  their argument lies in their failure to recognize that in 1992 there were two waiting lists, one for nonminority \napplicants and one for minority applicants, a situation that, by definition, could not exist in a race-blind system. Coupled \nwith Professor Wellborn's testimony regarding the aberrant nature of the one vote that each of them received     Hop-\nwood's cast for diversity on the basis of age, marital status, and childcare responsibilities, and Carvell's cast by a student \nmember of the Committee     makes problematical the giving of any significance to their positions on the 1992 waiting \nlist in the context of a race-blind system that would have a single, race-blind waiting list and no certainty that, under \nsuch a system, a single vote would get an applicant on the waiting list at all. \n \n45   Hopwood and Carvell also argue that failure to consider that each of them received one vote for admission \nis in direct contradiction to a statement made by Professor Johanson in another discrimination lawsuit, Malooly \nv. Texas, Civ. No. A96CA229SS (W.D. Tex. 1994). The record contains an affidavit by Professor Johanson \nfrom that case in which he avers that Mr. Malooly received no votes for admission and that candidates with one, \ntwo, or three votes would have been considered superior to Malooly. We do not agree that this statement neces-\nsarily makes the method employed by Professor Wellborn inherently unfair or illogical. Furthermore, the state-\nment would have more weight if it were Professor Johanson rather than Professor Wellborn who developed and \npresented the expert testimony in the instant case. \n [**35]  Professor Wellborn elected to employ a fair alternative. He reconsidered all applicants, both the admitted \nminority candidates and all of the nonminority candidates, who had TI scores in the same range as the Plaintiffs (above \n190). Thus, even though Hopwood and Carvell got no special consideration from Professor Wellborn for their respec-\ntive votes, neither did the admitted minority applicants     even those who received one or two votes. Under Professor \nWellborn's reconstruction, Hopwood and Carvell received treatment equal to all denied minority candidates in their TI \nrange. Professor Wellborn examined the LSDAS report of each one of these applicants and carefully re-examined the \nentire file of each of those whom he considered to be a viable candidate. All this was done using race-blind criteria.  \nThe Law School supplied additional evidence that cast light on the one vote received by both Hopwood and Car-\nvell. Assistant Dean Laquita Hamilton, who had cast Hopwood's one vote, testified, and  [*271]  provided an affidavit \nstating, that she had voted for Hopwood in the belief that Hopwood would bring diversity to the incoming class because \nshe was an older student, had worked while in [**36]  school, and was raising a handicapped child. Dean Hamilton's \nvote for Hopwood clearly was not cast in the belief that Hopwood was academically more qualified than other appli-\ncants based on the system's criteria of LSAT score, college academic record, personal statement, and letters of recom-\nmendation.  \n\n \nCarvell's one vote was cast by a student member of the admissions committee. Professor Johanson testified that \nsometimes the votes of student members of the committee are aberrant departures from the admissions decisions norm, \nnoting that Carvell received no votes from non-student members of the admissions committee. \nFinally, the Plaintiffs would make much of Professor Wellborn's acknowledgment that he made a number of small \nerrors in his analysis. These include such things as misstating that each committee member could vote for nine of the 30 \napplicants in the group of discretionary zone candidates when in fact each could vote for 10. The Plaintiffs also stress \nthat Professor Wellborn failed to consider the difference between applicants with two-digit scores under an older \nLSDAS system and those with a three-digit TI index in the newer LSDAS system. We have considered each of the \nflaws [**37]  singled out by the Plaintiffs and are satisfied that, neither alone nor in combination, are they sufficient to \naffect the validity of the studies or to impugn Professor Wellborn's ultimate conclusions. \nd. Plenary Evaluation of Defendants' Evidence \nThe nature and history of this case have influenced us to review the record de novo, including the Plaintiffs' \nLSDAS reports and files, all of the LSDAS reports included in Professor Wellborn's report, and the additional applica-\ntion files contained therein. As a result we are further convinced that the district court did not clearly err in finding that \nthe Plaintiffs would not have been offered admission to the Law School under a race-blind admissions system. \nThe application file of each Plaintiff includes at least one significant weakness. Even though Hopwood's LSAT \nscore was in the 83rd percentile, she had received her undergraduate degree from a relatively weak institution, had gar-\nnered at least 60 hours at a community college, and had earned her bachelor's degree from a school with a college LSAT \nmean of 28. Less than 2 percent of nonminority applicants admitted in 1992 had been graduated from schools with col-\nlege LSAT means [**38]  of 28 or below. 46 Furthermore, Hopwood's file contained no letters of recommendation or \npersonal statements. Testifying members of the admissions committee in addition to Professor Wellborn agreed unani-\nmously that Hopwood's undergraduate record and degree institution made her \"not well prepared academically\" and \n\"very weak in comparison with the overwhelming credentials of so many\" of the other applicants. \n \n46   The 1992 LSAT means at other colleges demonstrate the relative weakness of this LSAT mean. Harvard \nUniversity (40); Duke University (39); Rice University (38); Trinity University (36); The University of Texas at \nAustin (between 34 and 35); Texas A&M University (33). \nPlaintiff Carvell took the LSAT twice, and even when averaged, his LSAT score was only in the 76th percentile, \nwell below the median of 89th percentile of those admitted in 1992. Carvell's 3.28 GPA was also well below the 3.53 \nmedian for applicants admitted in 1992, and his file contained one distinctly negative letter: One of his college [**39]  \nprofessors had written that he was \"disappointed\" in Carvell's grades and that Carvell had a \"mediocre\" and \"uneven\" \nacademic performance. Other members of the admissions committee uniformly agreed that Carvell's undergraduate aca-\ndemic performance was \"unimpressive.\"  \n [*272]  Plaintiff Rogers also had a relatively weak undergraduate record. Initially he had attended the University, \nwhere he was not only placed on academic probation but was twice dismissed for failing grades in a period of three and \none-half years. Even though Rogers did eventually graduate with a GPA of 3.13, his degree institution, UH-D, had a \nvery low mean LSAT score of 26, and no letters of recommendation were provided. \nPlaintiff Elliott's LSAT score in the 95th percentile was quite good, but his GPA at the University was only 2.98. In \nhis own personal statement, Elliott acknowledged that in undergraduate school he was \"an average student, studying \nwhen I needed to, partying more than I should, and not managing my time efficiently.\" Elliott candidly admitted that his \nundergraduate academic performance \"is not of the caliber expected by the University of Texas School of Law.\" 47 \n \n47   After Elliott failed to gain admission, his father wrote to the Law School indicating that Elliott's friends and \nfamily believed that he was not offered admission because of \"the mandatory minority and women quotas.\" \n [**40]  The Plaintiffs' arguments criticizing the Law School's evidence were presented fully and forcefully to the \ndistrict court by able counsel and were considered in depth by that court. 48 Its analysis of the Plaintiffs' criticisms of \nProfessor Wellborn's analysis was painstakingly thorough. The district court independently evaluated Professor Well-\nborn's methodology by reviewing hundreds of application files itself. 49 Our equally painstaking review of the entire \nrecord convinces us that the district court was both indefatigable and disciplined in carefully considering all the evi-\ndence and was equally diligent in its consideration and application of the law and arguments presented by all the attor-\nneys. We conclude that the district court's ultimate finding that the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of \n\n \nbeing admitted to the Law School under a race-blind admission system was not merely free of reversible error but was \neminently correct. 50 \n \n48   See Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 889-92. \n49   Id. at 893. \n50   As we affirm the district court's finding that the Plaintiffs would not have been offered admission to the Law \nSchool in 1992 under a constitutionally valid system, we need not address the district court's alternative findings \non damages. \n [**41]  B. Hopwood II Revisited \n \n1. Law of the Case  \nWe could not reconsider the merits of Hopwood II and reverse or revise it, as Texas urges, without first clearing a \nvery substantial hurdle: The law of the case doctrine. Under the strictures of that maxim, \"we will not reexamine issues \nof law addressed by a prior panel opinion in a subsequent appeal of the same case unless: (i) the evidence on a subse-\nquent trial was substantially different, (ii) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision on the law applicable \nto such issues, or (iii) the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.\" 51 Texas acknowledges \nthat the first two exceptions to this doctrine, which bars a subsequent panel from reversing or disregarding the holding \nof a prior panel, do not apply to the instant case. Texas contends, however, that the third exceptional justification for \ndeparting from law of the case does apply here; that the Hopwood II panel decision is \"clearly erroneous\" and will \n\"work a manifest injustice\" if it is not overturned. \n \n51   Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F.3d 1347, 1351 n.1 (5th Cir. 1995)(internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). \n [**42]    \nIn the context of the law of the case doctrine, \"clearly erroneous\" is a very exacting standard. \"Mere doubts or dis-\nagreement about the wisdom of a prior decision of this or a lower court will not suffice for this exception. To be clearly  \n[*273]  erroneous, a decision must strike us as more than just maybe or probably wrong; it must be dead wrong.\" 52 \nTexas asserts that Hopwood II is in fact \"dead wrong,\" arguing that its rulings directly conflict with several Supreme \nCourt precedents. \n \n52   City Public Service Bd. v. General Elec. Co., 935 F.2d 78, 82 (5th Cir. 1991)(internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). \nThe Hopwood II panel held that: \n  \n   the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to \nadmit [1] in order to achieve a diverse student body, [2] to combat the perceived effects of a hostile envi-\nronment at the law school, [3] to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or \n[4] to eliminate any present [**43]  effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school. 53 \n \n  \nTexas attacks Hopwood II's rejection of two of the enumerated justifications as being clearly erroneous. Texas first con-\ntends that the University has a compelling interest in remedying the present effects of past discrimination, both by the \nUniversity itself and by the Texas public education system as a whole. Texas then argues that the University has a com-\npelling interest in obtaining a diverse student body. We shall analyze these two contentions in turn. \n \n53   78 F.3d at 962. \na. Remedying the Effects of Past Discrimination \nThe Supreme Court has conclusively established that the government can, consistent with the Constitution, use ra-\ncial preferences under particular circumstances to remedy the present effects of past discrimination. 54 But it has also \nplaced several limitations on the use of racial preferences for remedial purposes. In Wygant, the Court ruled that the \ngovernment cannot use racial preferences [**44]  to remedy general, societal discrimination. 55 In Croson, the Court \n\n \nruled that a municipality cannot use racial preferences in the awarding of construction contracts to remedy discrimina-\ntion in the construction industry as a whole. 56 \n \n54   See, e.g., United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167, 94 L. Ed. 2d 203, 107 S. Ct. 1053 (1987) (\"the Gov-\nernment unquestionably has a compelling interest in remedying past and present discrimination by a state ac-\ntor\"); Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 363, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750, 98 S. Ct. 2733 \n(1978). \n55   Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986). \n56   City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 (1989). \nDespite having addressed the subject of remedial racial preferences in several opinions, though, the Supreme Court \nhas yet to establish specific rules for determining precisely [**45]  how \"localized\" past discrimination must be before a \nparticular governmental entity (in this case, the Law School or even the University) can, consistent with the Constitu-\ntion, use racial preferences to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. The Hopwood II panel nevertheless stepped \ninto this \"rules vacuum\" and developed fairly specific guidelines for determining when remedial racial preferences are \njustified. The panel ruled that (1) the University cannot use racial preferences to remedy discrimination in other compo-\nnents of Texas's public education system, 57 and (2) the record evidence did not support the University's use of racial \npreferences to remedy the effects of its own past discrimination. 58 \n \n57   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 950. \n58   Id. at 952-55. \nIn arguing that the rulings of Hopwood II are clearly erroneous within the meaning of the law of the case doctrine, \nTexas contends, as it did then, that the University should be allowed to take race [**46]  into account as a means of \nremedying the effects  [*274]  of past discrimination in other components of Texas's public education system. Texas \nadvances two arguments in support of this contention. First, it insists that Hopwood II conflicts with the Supreme \nCourt's rejection in Croson of the \"stark\" notion that a governmental entity \"must limit any race-based remedial efforts \nto eradicating the effects of its own prior discrimination.\" 59 Texas takes this statement out of context, however: The \nCroson court went on to explain that \"if [a governmental entity] could show that it had essentially become a 'passive \nparticipant' in a [private] system of racial exclusion practiced by [local] elements...we think it clear that the [governmen-\ntal entity] could take affirmative steps to dismantle such a system.\" 60 This holding is wholly inapplicable here because \nTexas has never claimed that the University was ever a passive participant in a private system of racial exclusion. 61 \nThus, Hopwood II does not conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Croson. \n \n59   Croson, 488 U.S. at 486. \n [**47]  \n60   Id. at 492. \n61   Neither does the University contend that it was a \"passive participant\" in a public system of racial exclusion; \nits sole mea culpa is to having been an active participant in a public system of racial exclusion. \nSecond, Texas argues that neither Wygant nor Croson commands the broad approach taken by the Hopwood II \npanel. This is certainly true: Hopwood II went beyond established Supreme Court precedent in several important re-\nspects. Within the law of the case framework, however, it is not clear error for a court of appeals to tackle legal ques-\ntions that the Supreme Court has declined to answer: Lower courts are bound only by Supreme Court holdings and not \nby the Court's election, either express or implied, to leave open particular legal questions. This or other subsequent pan-\nels of our court may well disagree with the aggressive legal reasoning employed by the Hopwood II panel, 62 but it can-\nnot be said that, as a matter of law, the panel's decision is \"dead wrong.\" As Hopwood II's ruling with respect to the \n[**48]  appropriate scope of remedial racial preferences is not clearly erroneous within the intendment of the law of the \ncase doctrine, we cannot today reconsider that decision with an eye toward disregarding or reversing it. \n \n62   See, e.g., Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 962 (Wiener, J., specially concurring). \nb. Diversity as a Compelling Governmental Interest \nTexas also contends that \"in holding that diversity may never be a compelling interest justifying the consideration \nof race or ethnicity in admissions, the Hopwood II panel attempted to create a new rule of constitutional law despite the \nSupreme Court's continued hesitation to do so.\" Although we agree with Texas's characterization of the Hopwood II \n\n \npanel opinion, we have just demonstrated that a federal appeals court's creation of a new rule of constitutional law when \na lacuna exists in the Supreme Court's rulings on the point does not constitute clear error.  \nThe diversity rationale was first advanced by Justice Powell in his swing [**49]  opinion in Bakke, in which he \nwrote only for himself. 63 Although four Justices joined Justice Powell in holding that \"the State has a substantial interest \nthat legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of \nrace and ethnic origin,\" 64 the same four disagreed with him as to the rationale that is necessary to justify constitutionally \nthe government's use of racial preferences. Justice Brennan wrote separately on behalf of the four concurring Justices to \nexpress the view that the Constitution permits the government to use racial preferences only \"to  [*275]  remedy disad-\nvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.\" 65 None of the four other justices would go the extra step proposed \nby Justice Powell and approve student body diversity as a justification for a race-based admission criterion. \n \n63   Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316-19 (Opinion of Powell, J.).  \n64   Id. at 320. \n65   Id. at 325. \nAlthough [**50]  Bakke clearly stands for the proposition that the government can use racial preferences under \nsome circumstances, no controlling rationale emerged from that opinion to delineate precisely what those justifying \ncircumstances are. Thus, in deciding whether the system of racial preferences employed by the Law School was consti-\ntutional, the Hopwood II panel was free to determine which among the competing rationales offered by the justices in \nBakke is constitutionally valid. 66 Once the Hopwood II panel determined to decide the case on the question of compel-\nling state interest and not, as urged in the special concurrence, on the question of narrow tailoring, 67 the panel was con-\nstrained in its judgment only by other Supreme Court decisions and by the text of the Constitution itself. \n \n66   We respectfully disagree, then, with the Ninth Circuit's recent holding that Justice Powell's diversity ration-\nale is binding Supreme Court precedent. See Smith v. University of Washington, 233 F.3d 1188, 1200, 2000 WL \n1770045, at *10 (9th Cir. 2000). Despite the facts that (1) no Justice other than Justice Powell even discussed \ndiversity in Bakke and (2) no other Justice joined that part of Justice Powell's opinion that advanced the diversity \nrationale, the Ninth Circuit nevertheless hypothesized that Justice Brennan (joined by Justices White, Marshall, \nand Blackmun) \"would have embraced [the diversity rationale] if need be.\" See id. (emphasis added). It follows, \nat least according to the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, that Justice Powell's diversity rationale is \"the narrowest \nfooting upon which a race-conscious decision making process could stand\" and accordingly is the \"holding\" of \nBakke under Marks v. United States 430 U.S. 188, 193, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260, 97 S. Ct. 990 (1977) (\"When a frag-\nmented Court decides a case . . . the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Mem-\nbers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\"). See id. 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 31160, at *29, \nid. at *10. With respect, however, we do not read Marks as an invitation from the Supreme Court to read its \nfragmented opinions like tea leaves, attempting to divine what the Justices \"would have\" held. Rather, in the ab-\nsence of subsequent Supreme Court precedent squarely and unequivocally holding that diversity can never be a \ncompelling state interest, we read Bakke as not foreclosing (but certainly not requiring) the acceptance by lower \ncourts of diversity as a compelling state interest. \n [**51]  \n67   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 966 (Wiener, J., specially concurring). \nThe Hopwood II panel ruled that the Constitution does permit the government to use racial preferences for the pur-\npose of remedying the present effects of past discrimination, 68 but that the government cannot constitutionally use racial \npreferences for the purpose of fostering student body diversity. Although Justice Powell would surely have disagreed \nwith that holding, we cannot say that Hopwood II conflicts with any portion of Bakke that is binding on this court. 69 \nSome may think it was imprudent for the Hopwood II panel to venture into uncharted waters by declaring the diversity \nrationale invalid, but the panel's holding clearly does not conflict directly with controlling Supreme Court precedent. \nInasmuch as the Hopwood II panel's ruling on diversity did not rise to the level of clear error, the law of the case doc-\ntrine bars our revisiting or disregarding that decision today. \n \n68   Id. at 948-49 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 500). \n [**52]  \n69   We recognize that in a recent challenge to the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions decisions, \nthe district court held that Supreme Court precedent does not bar courts from considering diversity as a compel-\nling state interest. See Gratz v. Bollinger, 122 F. Supp. 2d 811, 2000 WL 1827468, at *9 (E.D. Mich. 2000). Al-\n\n \nthough decided contrary to Hopwood II with respect to the constitutional validity of the diversity rationale, \nGratz is nevertheless consistent with our position that the Hopwood II panel was neither constrained to accept, \nnor required to reject, diversity as a compelling state interest under binding Supreme Court precedent. \n [*276]  2. Hopwood B's Injunction \na. Standard of Review \nWe review the district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion. 70 \n \n70   Regions Bank of Louisiana v. Rivet, 224 F.3d 483, 488 (5th Cir. 2000)(citing Peaches Entertainment Corp. \nv. Entertainment Repertoire Assocs., Inc., 62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1995). \n [**53]  b. Injunction Against Consideration of Race \nOn remand from Hopwood II, the district court entered an injunction forbidding the Law School and its administra-\ntors \"from taking into consideration racial preferences in the selection of those individuals to be admitted as students.\" 71 \nTexas asks us to reverse that injunction, arguing that it conflicts with the Supreme Court's holding in Bakke. 72 In Hop-\nwood A, the district court refused to enter an injunction against the University that would forbid the Law School's use of \nracial preferences in its admissions process. On appeal of that ruling, the Hopwood II panel stated: \n  \n    \n  \nIt is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are confi-\ndent that the conscientious administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the directives \ncontained in this opinion. If an injunction should be needed in the future, the district court, in its discre-\ntion, can consider its parameters without our assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal \nto enter an injunction. 73 \n \n  \nDespite (1) the district court's original refusal to enjoin the Law School [**54]  and (2) the Hopwood II panel's admoni-\ntion that it did not believe that an injunction was necessary, on remand the district court in Hopwood B entered an in-\njunction barring the Law School \"from taking into consideration racial preferences in the selection of those individuals \nto be admitted as students.\" Given the Hopwood II panel's instructions on remand, the district court was certainly within \nits discretion to investigate the necessity of entering an injunction and to enter an appropriate injunction if it concluded \nthat one was needed     and apparently it did so. The particular injunction entered by the district court, however, must be \nreversed for two reasons. \n \n71   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 923. \n72   438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978). \n73   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 958-59. \nFirst, in its otherwise extensive and able management of this case on remand, one thing that the district court did \nnot do was conduct a hearing to determine whether an injunction [**55]  \"was needed in the future.\" 74 Neither did it \npurport to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), which requires federal trial courts to support their judg-\nments with written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Nowhere to be found in the district court's lengthy and oth-\nerwise thorough opinion are any express findings of fact or conclusions of law addressing or supporting the need for an \ninjunction; and we cannot glean any, even implicitly, from other parts of that opinion. We are left no choice, therefore, \nbut to reverse the court's injunction for failure to comply with Rule 52(a). We deliberately elect to reverse rather than \nvacate the district court's injunction, however, so that we may remand and thereby give the court an opportunity to ex-\nplicate its findings and conclusions if it should still perceive a need to issue an injunction. \n \n74   Id. \nIn reversing and remanding, however, we would be remiss if we did not emphasize a second reason for so doing: \nOn its face, the district court's injunction [**56]  impermissibly conflicts with the square holding in Bakke. The Hop-\nwood B injunction forbids the University from using racial preferences for any reason, despite Bakke's holding that ra-\ncial preferences are constitutionally  [*277]  permissible in some circumstances. 75 Consistent with that position, Hop-\nwood II does not bar the University from using race for any and all remedial purposes; rather Hopwood II bars the Uni-\n\n \nversity from using race to remedy the effects of previous discrimination in other components of Texas's public educa-\ntion system only. 76 By enjoining any and all use of racial preferences, the district court went beyond the holding of \nHopwood II and, in the process, entered a judgment that conflicts with Bakke. If, on remand, the district court should \ndetermine, after conducting an evidentiary hearing or hearings, that an injunction is necessary, and supports that deter-\nmination with findings of fact and conclusions of law, any injunction that it enters must not exceed the scope of the rul-\ning in Hopwood II or the holding in Bakke. \n \n75   Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320. \n [**57]  \n76   Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 952. \n \nC. Attorneys' Fees  \nBoth sides have expressed displeasure with the district court's rulings on attorneys' fees. Presumably their displeas-\nure will continue, for we affirm the court's attorneys' fees rulings in all respects. \nCongress has provided an incentive for attorneys to take on difficult civil rights cases by allowing district courts in \ntheir discretion to shift, from the plaintiffs to the defendants, the cost of prosecuting such an action. 77 Title 42, Section \n1988(b) of the United States Code provides: \n  \n   In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of . . . [section 1983] . . . the court, in its discretion, \nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the \ncosts[.] 78 \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n77   See 42 U.S.C. ß 1988(b); Riddell v. National Democratic Party, 624 F.2d 539, 543 (5th Cir. 1980) (\"Con-\ngress enacted this statute in 1976 to encourage private attorneys general to enforce fundamental constitutional \nrights under section 1983.\").  \n [**58]  \n78   42 U.S.C. ß 1988(b). \n \n1. Standard of Review  \nThe district courts' discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under ß 1988 is appropriately broad. We have repeatedly \nnoted in the past, \"'when a district court awards [attorneys' fee pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ß 1988], we review the award only \nfor an abuse of discretion. . . .\"A request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation.\". . .We cannot \noveremphasize the concept that a district court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a fee award.'\" 79 Ap-\npellate courts have only a limited opportunity to appreciate the complexity of trying any given case and the level of pro-\nfessional skill needed to prosecute it. In contrast, the district court here has, among other things, observed firsthand the \npresentation of testimony and argument at trial, sifted through countless depositions and interrogatories, and assessed \nthe value of numerous dispositive filings. \n \n79   Bell v. Schexnayder, 36 F.3d 447, 449 (5th Cir. 1994) (quoting Associated Builders & Contractors of Lou-\nisiana, Inc. v. Orleans Parish School Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1990)(quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 \nU.S. 424, 437, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983))). See also 1 Steven Alan Childress & Martha S. Davis, \nFederal Standards of Review ß 4.15 (3d ed. 1999) (\"The fee award [under ß 1988] will not be reversed unless it \nconstitutes an abuse of discretion, there is strong evidence that it is excessive or inadequate, or the amount cho-\nsen is clearly erroneous.\"). \n \n [**59]  2. Texas's Contentions  \nTexas raises two objections to the district court's award of attorneys' fees: (1) The Plaintiffs are not prevailing par-\nties within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. ß 1988(b); and (2) Even if the Plaintiffs are deemed to be prevailing parties, they \n\n \nwould not be entitled to any fees because they were unable to achieve any direct relief. The prevailing parties issue was \nresolved by the district court before the  [*278]  appeal in Hopwood II. 80 On completion of that appeal, we remanded \nwith instructions for the district court to determine the reasonableness of the fees, not for the parties to relitigate the \nprevailing party issue. 81 In any event, the Plaintiffs are quite clearly prevailing parties as \"the plaintiffs accomplished \nthe principal goal of the lawsuit     to dismantle all forms of racial preferences in public higher education in Texas.\" 82 \nThe insistence of Texas that the Plaintiffs achieved only limited monetary relief is unavailing. Even nominal damages \ncan support an award of attorneys' fees. 83 Attorneys' fees are particularly appropriate here, given the Law School's \nchange of its admissions process as a direct result [**60]  of the instant litigation. 84 \n \n80   See Hopwood v. Texas, No. A 92-CA-563 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 14, 1994)(order denying motion for attorneys' \nfees)(\"There is no dispute the plaintiffs have met the minimum condition for prevailing party status by obtaining \nan enforceable judgment for one dollar in nominal damages.\").  \n81   See Hopwood v. Texas, No. 95-50062 (5th Cir. May 17, 1996)(order vacating judgment denying attorneys' \nfees and remanding with instructions that reasonable attorneys' fees should be granted). \n82   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 916.  \n83   See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 112, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494, 113 S. Ct. 566 (1992)(holding that a plaintiff in \na civil rights action who wins an award of nominal damages is a prevailing party under ß 1988 and therefore eli-\ngible for attorneys' fees). \n84   See Robinson v. Kimbrough, 652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir. 1981) (noting that fee awards are reasonable when \nplaintiff's lawsuit is \"a substantial factor or a significant catalyst in motivating the defendants to end their uncon-\nstitutional behavior\"). \n [**61]  Texas contends, in the alternative, that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to any fee award because they \nachieved no specific injunctive or monetary relief. A prevailing plaintiff \"should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee \nunless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\" 85 As we discuss below, the district court properly \naccounted for the Plaintiffs' lack of success in obtaining monetary and other direct relief by reducing their attorneys' \nsubmitted hourly totals. We cannot credit Texas's argument that the Plaintiffs have not achieved a compensable goal. As \nnoted, the Plaintiffs have achieved \"the principal goal of their lawsuit\"     a benefit that inures to all future applicants to \nthe Law School, at least those who advocate a race-blind system. It is important to add in this respect that Section 1988 \n\"is a tool that ensures the vindication of important rights, even when large sums of money are not at stake, by making \nattorney's fees available under a private attorney general theory.\" 86 \n \n85   Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, 103 S. Ct. 1933 (1983) (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted). \n [**62]  \n86   Farrar, 506 U.S. at 121 (O'Connor, J., concurring). \n \n3. The Plaintiffs' Contentions  \nThe Plaintiffs assert numerous objections to the district court's awards of attorneys' fees. They first object to the \ncourt's refusal to consider fee requests for work done after the Supreme Court's refusal to grant their petition for a writ \nof certiorari. The Plaintiffs filed their final supplemental fee applications before the trial on remand in Hopwood B. \nEven if we were to conclude that the district court abused its discretion by entertaining the post-remand supplemental \napplication before the trial rather than after it, such error would be harmless because the Plaintiffs are not prevailing \nparties on any issues resolved in the post-remand trial. They were not able to prove entitlement to any monetary relief. It \nis true that the court granted injunctive relief barring any use of racial preferences by the Law School, but to the extent \nthe Plaintiffs prevailed on that issue, their victory was assured by professional services rendered  [*279]  prior to re-\nmand. 87 \n \n87   See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 962. \n [**63]  The Plaintiffs also object to the district court's 25 percent summary reduction based on the inadequacy of \nthe time entries, duplicative work product, and lack of billing judgment of their counsels' submitted hourly totals. The \ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in adjusting the number of hours downward. 88 In its opinion, the court lists and \ndescribes eleven different instances of lack of billing judgment by the Plaintiffs' counsel. 89 The Plaintiffs counter on \nappeal with an affidavit by one of the lead attorneys, insisting that he indeed did exercise billing judgment. Without \nmore, however, the Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion. \n\n \n \n88   See Walker v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 99 F.3d 761, 770 (5th Cir. 1996) (\"The proper remedy \nwhen there is no evidence of billing judgment is to reduce the hours awarded by a percentage intended to substi-\ntute for the exercise of billing judgment.\").  \n89   See Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 915-16 (describing, for example, how \"thousands of dollars were spent re-\npeatedly reading and reviewing the same Supreme Court cases on affirmative action\" and that \"compensation \n[was] sought for non-legal work such as reading a national best seller on affirmative action, attending a panel \ndiscussion regarding the impact of the case, and reviewing co-counsel agreements\"). \n [**64]  The Plaintiffs further object to the district court's reduction of the submitted hourly totals to account for \ntheir lack of success. The Plaintiffs argue that they achieved the \"principal goal of their lawsuit\" by striking down racial \npreferences in higher education admissions in Texas. As Texas points out, however, the Plaintiffs did not receive any \nspecific injunctive or monetary relief for their own asserted injuries, and they did not gain admission to the Law School. \nA fifteen per cent reduction for this lack of success is not an abuse of discretion. 90 \n \n90   See Albright v. Good Shepherd Hosp., 901 F.2d 438, 440 (5th Cir. 1990)(indicating that \"those achieving \nlimited or partial success may recover only that which is reasonable in light of the relief obtained\"). \nThe Plaintiffs next contend that in its analysis of the fee issue the district court ignored some of the factors listed in \nJohnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc. 91 to guide the district courts in their attorney's fee inquiries.  [**65]  92 Spe-\ncifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court either overlooked or failed to consider adequately the following \nJohnson factors: (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (2) the skill required to perform the legal service prop-\nerly; (3) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (4) the amount involved and the results obtained; and \n(5) the \"undesirability\" of the case. 93 The district court did not abuse its discretion in according these factors little or no \nweight. The issues presented by this case may well provide grist for the political and legal mills, but they are \"neither \nnovel nor extraordinarily difficult[.]\" 94 The underlying arguments about the place of affirmative action in the equal pro-\ntection paradigm have been percolating since the Supreme Court's decision in Bakke if not longer 95; only the evidence \nand analysis supporting each side have grown more sophisticated over the past two decades. Stated differently, this is \nnot an issue that demanded a large amount of legal excavation in this instance. Additionally, as earlier noted, the Plain-\ntiffs were indeed successful, but no amount of professional chest-pounding or  [*280]  puffery [**66]  can obscure the \nfact that none of the Plaintiffs has been offered admission to the Law School or awarded monetary damages for the Law \nSchool's refusal or failure to offer them admission. \n \n91   488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974). \n92   Id. at 717-19.  \n93   Id. \n94   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 921. \n95   Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750, 98 S. Ct. 2733 (1978).  \nThe district court's denial of fees for work of Plaintiffs' counsel in successfully opposing the attempted intervention \nby the Thurgood Marshall Legal Society, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the \nMexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, is another bone of contention advanced by the Plaintiffs. In \nparticular, they object to the extension of Independent Fed'n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes 96 to the facts of this case. The \nplaintiff in Zipes sought an award of attorney's fees from the intervenor. The Supreme Court held that recovery [**67]  \nof fees from the intervenor cannot be had unless the intervention is \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\" 97 \nOur fellow circuits have extended this holding, in varying degrees, to the award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs from the \npockets of losing defendants when the fees are based on interventions by third-parties. 98 We need not decide today \nwhether a prevailing plaintiff is absolutely barred from shifting to the defendant the costs associated with defending \nagainst an intervention, for here the Plaintiffs did not \"prevail\" on this issue vis-a-vis Texas. 99 Texas remained neutral \non the intervention issue. In addition, the potential intervenors made clear both to the trial court and to us in Hopwood I \nthat the purpose of their intervention was to raise arguments and defenses that Texas itself had no interest in raising. 100 \nBoth we and the trial court denied intervention, holding that Texas would adequately protect the interests of those af-\nfected by affirmative action. 101 It would be inequitable now for us to force Texas to pay for costs associated with a \nfailed intervention which, in our determination, would have brought nothing more to the table than did [**68]  Texas. 102 \nThe Plaintiffs elected to oppose intervention, and they were successful     but not against Texas: They succeeded against \nthe putative intervenors in a case instituted by Plaintiffs, not by Texas. Neither logic nor equity supports taxing Texas \n\n \nunder these circumstances. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys' fees to the Plaintiffs for \ntheir legal expenses incurred in opposing intervention. \n \n96   491 U.S. 754, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 105 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989).  \n97   Id. at 761.  \n98   See, e.g., Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 31 F.3d 169, 176-78 (4th Cir. 1994); Bigby v. City of \nChicago, 927 F.2d 1426, 1428-29 (7th Cir. 1991). \n99   Cf. Reeves v. Harrell, 791 F.2d 1481, 1483-84 (11th Cir. 1986). \n100   See Hopwood v. Texas, 1994 WL 242362, at *1; Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 605.  \n101   See id. at 606. \n102   See id. (\"[The proposed intervenors] have not met their burden of demonstrating that they have a separate \ninterest that the State will not adequately represent. The proposed intervenors have not demonstrated that the \nState will not strongly defend its affirmative action program. Nor have the proposed intervenors shown that they \nhave a separate defense of the affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\"); see also Hopwood II, \n78 F.3d at 960 n.59. \n [**69]  The Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees objections also include the district court's denial of fees for monitoring the \ncomments of Texas in the media and for responding to those comments. The Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to a \nfee award for this work because, for example, they were able to use one of the public comments by the Attorney Gen-\neral of Texas in their successful opposition to the granting of a writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court. We are chary \nabout granting requests for media fees. 103 The controversy underlying  [*281]  this case is a politically and socially divi-\nsive one. The district court's disallowance of fees for combat on the affirmative action issue in the non-legal media is \nnot an abuse of discretion. \n \n103   See, e.g., Watkins v. Fordice, 7 F.3d 453, 458 (5th Cir. 1993); Associated Builders & Contractors of Lou-\nisiana, Inc. v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir. 1990).  \nThe Plaintiffs object additionally to the district court's reduction [**70]  of their counsels' hourly rates. For in-\nstance, Theodore Olson, a noted appellate litigator in our nation's capital and one of the lawyers for Plaintiffs Hopwood \nand Carvell, had his hourly rate reduced from $ 450.00 to $ 225.00. Although Mr. Olson advises that his rate was ad-\njudged reasonable by the D.C. Circuit in an unrelated case, the attorneys' fees calculus is a fact-intensive one and its \ncharacter varies from case to case. In this case, the district court found that in the relevant legal market, which is not the \nDistrict of Columbia but Austin, Texas, high quality appellate representation could be obtained for a lower rate than that \nnormally charged by Mr. Olson. Hourly rates are to be computed according to the prevailing market rates in the relevant \nlegal market, not the rates that \"lions at the bar may command.\" 104 \n \n104   Leroy v. City of Houston, 906 F.2d 1068, 1079 (5th Cir. 1990)(internal quotation marks and citation omit-\nted). \nIn essence, the Plaintiffs' argument is that the out-of-town [**71]  rates should have been used because the out-of-\ntowners had special competence and there was a lack of available counsel of that quality locally. The district court ob-\nserved, however, that local counsel had \"provided competent and skilled representation\" 105 before the Plaintiffs obtained \nadditional non-local counsel, and ventured the belief that local counsel would have been \"capable of the same degree of \ncompetence regarding the appeal had it been determined he should have remained the plaintiffs' primary lawyer.\" 106 \nContrary to the Plaintiffs' counsel's appreciation of this case, we do not perceive it to have been extraordinarily difficult. \nAgain, the place of affirmative action in higher education has been the subject of legal discourse for many years. The \ndistrict court's decision to reduce the hourly rates does not constitute an abuse of discretion. 107  \n \n105   Hopwood B, 999 F. Supp. at 917. \n106   Id.  \n107   Steven Smith, counsel to plaintiffs Elliott and Rogers, objects that his submitted rate was not adjusted for \ndelay in payment. This contention is unavailing. The district court specifically indicated that it had reviewed the \nhourly rates for all the attorneys and adjusted them accordingly. In many cases, when the attorneys submitted \ncurrent hourly rates in addition to historical rates, the court used the current rates to compensate for delay in \npayment. In Smith's case, the submitted rate of $ 125.00 was \"higher than Smith's normal billing rate and is the \nhighest rate Smith has ever received in any federal civil rights litigation he has undertaken.\" See Hopwood B, \n999 F. Supp. at 918. In light of the district court's finding that Smith had limited trial and appellate experience \n\n \nand a limited role in the case, and that the court found many of the requested rates to be excessive, we conclude \nthat the lower court did not abuse its discretion in not increasing Smith's award for delay in payment. We find \nthat the higher rate that he received from the court     higher than any other case he has tried     takes into account \ndelay in payment. It is important to keep in mind that \"attorneys' fee litigation should not require specific reason-\ning by the trial court to justify every facet of its decision[.]\" Blanchard v. Bergeron, 893 F.2d 87, 91 (5th Cir. \n1990). \n [**72]  In sum, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its rulings on attorneys' fees. We therefore af-\nfirm those rulings.  \n \nIII.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe district court was correct, and thus free of clear error, in holding on remand that Texas had borne its burden of \nproving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of being offered \nadmission to the Law School in 1992 under a constitutionally valid, race-blind admissions system. In affirming that \nruling we avoid the  [*282]  need to address the district court's alternative findings of fact and conclusions of law re-\ngarding compensable damages incurred by the Plaintiffs. \nThe district court failed to comply with the strictures of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), however, when it \nfailed to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law to justify its injunction prohibiting absolutely the use of race as \na factor in the admissions process. The district court also exceeded the limits of the remand under which it was operat-\ning and at the same time conflicted with the aspect of Bakke that authorizes consideration of race in higher education \nadmissions to eradicate vestiges of previous discrimination.  [**73]  We therefore reverse the court's grant of that in-\njunction and remand for further proceedings on the injunction issue consistent with this opinion. \nAs the district court acted within its discretion in all rulings on attorneys' fees, we affirm those rulings in all re-\nspects. \nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part.   \n ",

We affirm.\nI.\nSince 1983, Texas has implemented an affirmative action policy in its higher education system, a component of\nwhich is a race conscious admissions policy for the University of Texas School of Law (Law School). On\nSeptember 29, 1992, two unsuccessful white applicants to the Law School filed a lawsuit challenging the\n[1]\nadmissions policy as racially discriminatory.  Named as defendants were the State of Texas, the Board of\nRegents of the Texas State University System, the Law School, and a number of individuals in their official\ncapacities. Although the parties commenced limited discovery, the parties' focus was a dispute over standing and\nripeness. This dispute was finally resolved on October 28, 1993, when the district court denied defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment on standing and ripeness grounds. On November 18, 1993, the district court set\nthe following deadlines: March 11, 1994 for a final pretrial conference; April 1, 1994, for completion of discovery;\nApril 15, 1994 for filing of a joint pretrial order.\n\nOn January 5, 1994, the TMLS and BPLA moved for intervention of right and permissive intervention. The\nproposed intervenors argued that they had an interest in the existing admissions policy and in the elimination of\nthe vestiges of past discrimination in the Law School's admissions policy. The state defendants did not oppose\nintervention, but the plaintiffs did. Without conducting a hearing, the district court denied intervention of right,\nruling that the state defendants adequately represented TMLS and BPLA's interests. The district court also\ndenied permissive intervention, reasoning that it would \"needlessly increase cost and delay disposition of the\nlitigation.\" TMLS and BPLA promptly appealed.\n605  II.\n*605\n[2]\nIn order to intervene as of right under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a),  the proposed intervenor must demonstrate 1) that it\nhas an interest in the subject matter of the action, 2) that disposition of the action may practically impair or\nimpede the movant's ability to protect that interest, and 3) that the interest is not adequately represented by the\nexisting parties. Diaz v. Southern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,400 U.S. 878, 91\nS.Ct. 118, 27 L.Ed.2d 115 (1970). The application must also be timely under the circumstances. Stallworth v.\nMonsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, 263 (5th Cir.1977).\nA. Adequacy of Representation\nThe district court held that BPLA and TMLS failed to demonstrate that the state did not adequately represent their\ninterests. The district court reached this conclusion principally because the petitioners' ultimate objective was the\nsame as the State's: to defend the affirmative action program.\nThe BPLA and TMLS contend that the State cannot adequately represent their interest because 1) the long\nhistory of discrimination against African-Americans by the State weighs against the State's willingness to\nvigorously represent the interests of the African-American students; 2) the State's interests are broader in that\nthey must balance the interests of the African-American students against other students as well as balancing\neducational goals, fiscal responsibility, administrative concerns and public opinion; while the petitioners' only\ninterest is in preserving an admissions policy that remedies the past effects of discrimination and fosters an\natmosphere that is receptive to African-American students, and 3) the petitioners are in a better position to\npresent evidence of recent discrimination.\nThe proposed intervenors have the burden of demonstrating inadequate representation. The Supreme Court held\nin 1972 that the burden is \"minimal\" and that the requirement \"is satisfied if the applicant shows that\nrepresentation of his interest `may be' inadequate ...\" Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528, 538 n. 10,\n92 S.Ct. 630, 636, 30 L.Ed.2d 686 (1972). But where the party whose representation is said to be inadequate is a\ngovernmental agency, a much stronger showing of inadequacy is required. See 7C Charles A. Wright and Arthur\nR. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 1909 (1986). In a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest, the State\nis presumed to represent the interests of all of its citizens. New Orleans Public Service v. United Gas Pipe Line\nCo., 690 F.2d 1203, 1213 n. 7 (5th Cir.1982),cert. denied,469 U.S. 1019, 105 S.Ct. 434, 83 L.Ed.2d 360 (1984); \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Higginson, 631 F.2d 738, 740 (D.C.Cir.1979). Because Texas is already a\nparty, \"the applicant for intervention must demonstrate that its interest is in fact different from that of the state and\nthat the interest will not be represented by the state.\" EDF at 740. See also, Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians\nv. Minnesota, 989 F.2d 994 (8th Cir.1993).\nThe BPLA and TMLS argue that they have met their burden of showing that their interests are different from the\nState's. They contend that the State must balance competing goals while they are sharply focused on preserving\nthe admissions policy. Moreover, they argue that because of its competing goals, the State is not in as good a\nposition to bring in evidence of present effects of past discrimination and current discrimination.\nIn order to justify an affirmative action program, the State must show that there are \"present effects of past\ndiscrimination.\" Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986); \nPodberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 57 (4th Cir.1992). Although the BPLA and TMLS may have ready access to\n\n606 more evidence than the State, we see no reason they cannot provide this evidence to the State. The *606 BPLA\nand the TMLS have been authorized to act as amicus and we see no indication that the State would not welcome\ntheir assistance. BPLA and TMLS have not met their burden of demonstrating that they have a separate interest\nthat the State will not adequately represent. The proposed intervenors have not demonstrated that the State will\nnot strongly defend its affirmative action program. Nor have the proposed intervenors shown that they have a\nseparate defense of the affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert. See, Jansen v. Cincinnati, 904\nF.2d 336 (6th Cir.1990).\nB. Permissive Intervention\nIn its January 1994 order, the district court also denied the prospective intervenors' motion to intervene pursuant\n[3]\nto Rule 24(b), Fed.R.Civ.P.  Specifically, Judge Sparks held that the proposed intervenors' interests were\nadequately being represented by the defendants in the case and that adding them to the lawsuit would\nneedlessly increase costs and delay disposition of the litigation.\nIntervention under Rule 24(b) is left to the sound discretion of the district court, and this court has jurisdiction only\nif the district court has abused its discretion. E.G., Woolen v. Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., 684 F.2d 324, 330 (5th\nCir.1982) (\"the denial of a motion for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) is not appealable unless there is\nan abuse of discretion\"). As we have noted, we have never reversed a lower court's decision on Rule 24(b)\nintervention. E.g., Kneeland v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285, 1289-90 (5th Cir.1987); Doe v.\nDuncanville Independent School District, 994 F.2d 160, 168 n. 10 (5th Cir.1993). The district court plainly did not\nabuse its discretion in denying petitioners' Rule 24(b) application to intervene.\nAFFIRMED.\n[1] The lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n2000d.\n[2] Rule 24(a) states that \n[U]pon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action ... when the applicant claims an\ninterest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated\nthat the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that\ninterest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\n[3] Rule 24(b) states that \n[U]pon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action ... when an applicant's claim or\ndefense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.... In exercising its discretion the court\nshall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original\nparties.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

SMITH, Circuit Judge: \nWith the best of intentions, in order to increase the enrollment of certain favored classes of minority students, the \nUniversity of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\") discriminates in favor of those applicants by giving substantial \nracial preferences in its admissions program. The beneficiaries of this system are blacks and Mexican Americans, to the \ndetriment of whites and non-preferred minorities. The question we decide today in No. 94-50664 is whether the Four-\nteenth Amendment permits the school to discriminate in this way. \nWe hold that it does not. The law school has presented no compelling justification, under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment or Supreme Court precedent, that allows it to continue to elevate some races over others, even for the wholesome \npurpose of correcting perceived racial imbalance in the student body. \"Racial preferences appear to 'even the score' . . . \nonly if one embraces the proposition that our society is appropriately viewed as divided into races, making it right that \n[**2]  an injustice rendered in the past to a black man should be compensated for by discriminating against  [*935]  a \nwhite.\" City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 528, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 (1989) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in the judgment). \nAs a result of its diligent efforts in this case, the district court concluded that the law school may continue to impose \nracial preferences. See Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551 (W.D. Tex. 1994). In No. 94-50664, we reverse and re-\nmand, concluding that the law school may not use race as a factor in law school admissions. Further, we instruct the \ncourt to reconsider the issue of damages in accordance with the legal standards we now explain. In No. 94-50569, re-\ngarding the denial of intervention by two black student groups, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. \n \nI.  \nA. \nThe University of Texas School of Law is one of the nation's leading law schools, consistently ranking in the top \ntwenty. See, e.g., America's Best Graduate Schools, U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT Mar. 20, 1995, at 84 (national \nsurvey ranking of seventeenth). Accordingly, admission to the law school is fiercely competitive, with over 4,000 appli-\ncants a year competing to be among the approximately [**3]  900 offered admission to achieve an entering class of \nabout 500 students. Many of these applicants have some of the highest grades and test scores in the country.  \nNumbers are therefore paramount for admission. In the early 1990's, the law school largely based its initial admis-\nsions decisions upon an applicant's so-called Texas Index (\"TI\") number, a composite of undergraduate grade point av-\nerage (\"GPA\") and Law School Aptitude Test (\"LSAT\") score. 1 The law school used this number as a matter of admin-\nistrative convenience in order to rank candidates and to predict, roughly, one's probability of success in law school. \nMoreover, the law school relied heavily upon such numbers to estimate the number of offers of admission it needed to \nmake in order to fill its first-year class. \n \n1   The formulae were written by the Law School Data Assembly Service according to a prediction derived from \nthe success of first-year students in preceding years. As the LSAT was determined to be a better predictor of \nsuccess in law school, the formulae for the class entering in 1992 accorded an approximate 60% weight to LSAT \nscores and 40% to GPA.  \n\nPage 3 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nThe formula for students with a three-digit LSAT, see infra note 5, was calculated as: LSAT + (10)(GPA) = \nTI. For students with a two-digit LSAT, the formula was: (1.25)LSAT + (10)GPA = TI. \n [**4]  Of course, the law school did not rely upon numbers alone. The admissions office necessarily exercised \njudgment in interpreting the individual scores of applicants, taking into consideration factors such as the strength of a \nstudent's undergraduate education, the difficulty of his major, and significant trends in his own grades and the under-\ngraduate grades at his respective college (such as grade inflation). Admissions personnel also considered what qualities \neach applicant might bring to his law school class. Thus, the law school could consider an applicant's background, life \nexperiences, and outlook. Not surprisingly, these hard-to-quantify factors were especially significant for marginal can-\ndidates. 2  \n \n2   Notably, but of less significance to this appeal, residency also had a strong, if not often determinant, effect. \nUnder Texas law in 1992, the law school was limited to a class of 15% non-residents, and the Board of Regents \nrequired an entering class of at least 500 students. The law school therefore had to monitor offers to non-\nresidents carefully, in order not to exceed this quota, while at the same time maintaining an entering class of a \nmanageable size. \n [**5]  Because of the large number of applicants and potential admissions factors, the TI's administrative useful-\nness was its ability to sort candidates. For the class entering in 1992 the admissions group at issue in this casethe law \nschool placed the typical applicant in one of three categories according to his TI scores: \"presumptive admit,\" \"pre-\nsumptive deny,\" or a middle \"discretionary zone.\" An applicant's TI category determined how extensive a review his \napplication would receive.  \nMost, but not all, applicants in the presumptive admit category received offers of  [*936]  admission with little re-\nview. Professor Stanley Johanson, the Chairman of the Admissions Committee, or Dean Laquita Hamilton, the Assis-\ntant Dean for Admissions, reviewed these files and downgraded only five to ten percent to the discretionary zone be-\ncause of weaknesses in their applications, generally a non-competitive major or a weak undergraduate education.  \nApplicants in the presumptive denial category also received little consideration. Similarly, these files would be re-\nviewed by one or two professors, who could upgrade them if they believed that the TI score did not adequately reflect \npotential to compete at the law [**6]  school. Otherwise, the applicant was rejected. \nApplications in the middle range were subjected to the most extensive scrutiny. For all applicants other than blacks \nand Mexican Americans, the files were bundled into stacks of thirty, which were given to admissions subcommittees \nconsisting of three members of the full admissions committee. Each subcommittee member, in reviewing the thirty files, \ncould cast a number of votes typically from nine to eleven 3 among the thirty files. Subject to the chairman's veto, if a \ncandidate received two or three votes, he received an offer; if he garnered one vote, he was put on the waiting list; those \nwith no votes were denied admission. \n \n3   The number of votes would change over the course of the admissions season in order to achieve the appropri-\nate number of offers.  \nBlacks and Mexican Americans were treated differently from other candidates, however. First, compared to whites \nand non-preferred minorities, 4 the TI ranges that were used to place them into the three admissions [**7]  categories \nwere lowered to allow the law school to consider and admit more of them. In March 1992, for example, the presumptive \nTI admission score for resident whites and non-preferred minorities was 199. 5 Mexican Americans and blacks needed a \nTI of only 189 to be presumptively admitted. 6 The difference in the presumptive-deny ranges is even more striking. The \npresumptive denial score for \"nonminorities\" was 192; the same score for blacks and Mexican Americans was 179.  \n \n4   As blacks and Mexican Americans were the only two minority categories granted preferential treatment in \nadmissions, it is inaccurate to say that the law school conducted separate admissions programs for \"minorities\" \nand \"non-minorities.\" While the law school application form segregated racial and ethnic classification into \nseven categories \"Black/African American,\" \"Native American,\" \"Asian American,\" \"Mexican American,\" \n\"Other Hispanic\" (meaning non-Mexican descent), \"White,\" and \"Other (describe)\"only American blacks and \nMexican Americans received the benefit of the separate admissions track.  \nThus, for example, the law school decided that a black citizen of Nigeria would not get preferential treat-\nment, but a resident alien from Mexico, who resided in Texas, would. Likewise, Asians, American Indians, \nAmericans from El Salvador and Cuba, and many others did not receive a preference.  \n\nPage 4 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nIt is important to keep the composition of these categories in mind. For the sake of simplicity and readabil-\nity, however, we sometimes will refer to two broad categories: \"whites\" (meaning Texas residents who were \nwhites and non-preferred minorities) and \"minorities\" (meaning Mexican Americans and black Americans). \n [**8]  \n5   Because of a recent change in the grading scale of the LSAT, the law school in 1992 had applicants who had \ntaken an earlier LSAT scored on a 10-to-48 scale and others who had taken a later one scored on a 120-to-180 \nscale. Equivalence calculations were used to compare scores received on the two scales. For example, TI num-\nbers of 199 (three-digit LSAT) and 87 (two-digit LSAT) were equivalent. For the sake of simplicity, we use \nthree-digit numbers throughout this opinion. \n6   In March 1992, the resident Mexican American and black presumptive admit lines were in parity, but they \nhad not started that way. The initial presumptive admit TI's were 196 for Mexican Americans and 192 for \nblacks. Thus, initially, blacks received preferential treatment over Mexican Americans by having a lower hurdle \nto cross to get into the discretionary zone. In March, Professor Johanson lowered the Mexican American TI in \norder to admit more of this group. \nWhile these cold numbers may speak little to those unfamiliar with the pool of applicants, the results demonstrate \nthat the difference in the two ranges was dramatic.  [**9]  According to the law school, 1992 resident white applicants \nhad a mean GPA of 3.53 and an LSAT of 164. Mexican Americans scored 3.27 and 158; blacks scored 3.25 and 157. \nThe category of \"other minority\" achieved a  [*937]  3.56 and 160. 7  \n \n7   The median scores of the 1992 class are as follows: \nEthnicity  Resident  Nonresident \n  GPA/LSAT  GPA/LSAT \nAll students  3.52/162  3.61/164   \nWhite  3.56/164  3.72/166   \nBlack  3.30/158  3.30/156   \nMexican American  3.24/157  3.38/174 * \nOther minority  3.58/160  3.77/157   \n* Only two matriculated applicants. \nIn 1992, the LSAT's national distribution was approximately as follows: \nLSAT  Percentile  2-Digit LSAT \n166  94%  43 \n164  91%  41 \n162  88%  40 \n160  83%  39 \n158  78%  38 \n156  71%  36 \nOn the basis of these percentiles, one-half of the law school's white resident matriculants were in the top 9% \nof all test-takers, one-half of the resident Mexican Americans were in approximately the top 25% of test-takers, \nand one-half of the resident blacks were in the top 22% of test-takers.  \nThese disparate standards greatly affected a candidate's chance of admission. For example, by March 1992, because \nthe presumptive denial score for whites was a TI of 192 or lower, and the presumptive admit TI for minorities was 189 \nor higher, a minority candidate with a TI of 189 or above [**10]  almost certainly would be admitted, even though his \nscore was considerably below 8 the level at which a white candidate almost certainly would be rejected. Out of the pool \nof resident applicants who fell within this range (189-192 inclusive), 100% of blacks and 90% of Mexican Americans, \nbut only 6% of whites, were offered admission. 9  \n \n8   To illustrate this difference, we consider the four plaintiffs in this case Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, \nKenneth Elliott, and David Rogers. For a student similarly situated to Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8, to avoid \npresumptive denial as a white, i.e., to obtain a TI of 193 or above, her LSAT had to be at least a 155, a score in \napproximately the top 32% of test-takers. If she were black (thus, needing a 180 TI), she would have had to \nscore a 142 on the LSAT, ranking her only in the top 80%. Likewise, a student similar to Carvell, who had a \n3.28 GPA, would have needed a \"white\" LSAT of 160 (top 17%) and a \"black\" 147 (top 63%). A student like \n\nPage 5 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nRodgers with a 3.13 would have needed either a 162 (top 12%) as a white or 149 as a black (top 56%). Finally, a \nstudent like Elliott with a 2.98 GPA would have needed a 163 (top 10%) or 150 (top 53%), respectively. \n [**11]  \n9   According to the plaintiffs, 600-700 higher-scoring white residents were passed over before the first blacks \nwere denied admission. There is no specific finding on this assertion, and though the law school does not appear \nto refute it, we do not rely upon it in making our decision. \nThe stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet an \"aspiration\" of admitting a class consisting of 10% \nMexican Americans and 5% blacks, proportions roughly comparable to the percentages of those races graduating from \nTexas colleges. The law school found meeting these \"goals\" difficult, however, because of uncertain acceptance rates \nand the variable quality of the applicant pool. 10 In 1992, for example, the entering class contained 41 blacks and 55 \nMexican Americans, respectively 8% and 10.7% of the class. \n \n10   Thus, the law school constantly had to adjust its TI range over the course of the admissions season to reach \na desired mix. See supra note 6.  \n [**12]  In addition to maintaining separate presumptive TI levels for minorities and whites, the law school ran a \nsegregated application evaluation process. Upon receiving an application form, the school color-coded it according to \nrace. If a candidate failed to designate his race, he was presumed to be in a nonpreferential category. Thus, race was \nalways an overt part of the review of any applicant's file. \nThe law school reviewed minority candidates within the applicable discretionary range differently from whites. In-\nstead of being evaluated and compared by one of the various discretionary zone subcommittees, black and Mexican \nAmerican applicants' files were reviewed by a minority subcommittee of three, which would meet and discuss every \nminority candidate. Thus, each of these candidates' files could get extensive review and discussion. And while the mi-\nnority subcommittee reported summaries of files to the admissions committee as a whole, the minority subcommittee's \ndecisions were \"virtually final.\"  \n [*938]  Finally, the law school maintained segregated waiting lists, dividing applicants by race and residence. \nThus, even many of those minority applicants who were not admitted could be set aside [**13]  in \"minority-only\" wait-\ning lists. Such separate lists apparently helped the law school maintain a pool of potentially acceptable, but marginal, \nminority candidates. 11  \n \n11   The district court did not find, nor is the record clear on, how these different classes of waiting list candi-\ndates were compared in the event the law school made last-minute admissions decisions. The record does show \nthat the school carefully monitored the race of applicants in filling the last openings in late spring and early \nsummer. \nB. \nCheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David Rogers (the \"plaintiffs\") applied for admission to \nthe 1992 entering law school class. All four were white residents of Texas and were rejected. \nThe plaintiffs were considered as discretionary zone candidates. 12 Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT of 39 \n(equivalent to a three-digit LSAT of 160), had a TI of 199, a score barely within the presumptive-admit category for \nresident whites, which was 199 and up. She was dropped into the discretionary [**14]  zone for resident whites (193 to \n198), however, because Johanson decided her educational background overstated the strength of her GPA. Carvell, \nElliott, and Rogers had TI's of 197, at the top end of that discretionary zone. Their applications were reviewed by ad-\nmissions subcommittees, and each received one or no vote. \n \n12   The district court discussed in detail the plaintiffs' qualifications and their rejections. See  861 F. Supp. at \n564-67. \n \nII.  \nThe plaintiffs sued primarily under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; they also claimed \nderivative statutory violations of 42 U.S.C. ßß 1981 and 1983 and of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \nß 2000d (\"title VI\"). 13 The plaintiffs' central claim is that they were subjected to unconstitutional racial discrimination \n\nPage 6 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nby the law school's evaluation of their admissions applications. They sought injunctive and declaratory relief and com-\npensatory and punitive damages. \n \n13   The defendants are the State of Texas; the University of Texas Board of Regents; the members of the board, \nnamed but sued in their official capacities; the University of Texas at Austin; the President of the university, \nsued in his official capacity; the University of Texas School of Law; the dean of the law school, sued in his offi-\ncial capacity; and the Chairman of the Admissions Committee, sued in his official capacity.  \n [**15]  After a bench trial, the district court held that the school had violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights.  \n861 F. Supp. at 579. The plaintiffs' victory was pyrrhic at best, however, as the court refused to enjoin the law school \nfrom using race in admissions decisions or to grant damages beyond a one-dollar nominal award to each plaintiff. The \ndistrict court, however, did grant declaratory relief and ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed to apply again without pay-\ning the requisite fee.  Id. at 583. \nThe district court began by recognizing the proper constitutional standard under which to evaluate the admissions \nprogram: strict scrutiny. Id. at 568. As it was undisputed that the school had treated applicants disparately based upon \nthe color of their skin, the court asked whether the law school process (1) served a compelling government interest and \n(2) was narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal. Under the first prong of the test, the court held that two of the \nlaw school's five proffered reasons met constitutional muster: (1) \"obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a \nracially and ethnically diverse student body\" and (2) \"the objective of overcoming [**16]  past effects of discrimina-\ntion.\" Id. at 571.  \nSignificantly, on the second justification, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the analysis of past dis-\ncrimination should be limited to that of the law school; instead, the court held that the State of Texas's \"institutions of \nhigher education are inextricably linked to the primary and secondary  [*939]  schools in the system.\" Id. 14 Accord-\ningly, the court found that Texas's long history of racially discriminatory practices in its primary and secondary schools \nin its not-too-distant past had the following present effects at UT law: \"the law school's lingering reputation in the mi-\nnority community, particularly with prospective students, as a 'white' school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the \nstudent body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile environment for minorities.\" Id. at 572. The court \nalso noted that \"were the Court to limit its review to the University of Texas, the Court would still find a 'strong eviden-\ntiary basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary.'\" Id. (citation omitted). \n \n14   Because of this conclusion, the district court examined at length the history of race relations in Texas and \ndiscrimination in its schools.  861 F. Supp. at 554-57. \n [**17]  The court next evaluated whether the Texas program was narrowly tailored to further these goals.  Id. at \n573. Applying a four-factor test devised by the Supreme Court, the court held only part of the 1992 admissions scheme \nunconstitutional. Those parts that gave minorities a \"plus,\" that is, the component of the admissions program that treated \ncandidates' TI scores differently based upon race, was upheld.  Id. at 578.  \nThe court held, however, that differential treatment was not allowed where candidates of different races were not \ncompared at some point in the admission process. Thus, the court struck down the school's use of separate admissions \ncommittees for applications in the discretionary zone, id. at 578-79, and in dictum speculated that presumptive denial \nlines would not pass muster, as many white candidates would get no review, while similarly situated minorities would, \nid. at 576 n.71.  \nThough it declared that the law school's 1992 admissions program violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights, the \ncourt granted little relief. First, the court did not order that the plaintiffs be admitted to the law school. Instead, it used \nwhat it saw as analogous [**18]  title VII caselaw on burden-shifting to hold that while the state had committed a con-\nstitutional violation, the plaintiffs had the ultimate burden of proving damages.  Id. at 579-80. The court then found that \nthe defendants had proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying the plaintiffs admission and that the \nplaintiffs had not met their burden of showing that they would have been admitted but for the unlawful system.  Id. at \n582.  \nMoreover, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to prospective injunctive relief, because \"of the law \nschool's voluntary change to a procedure, which on paper and from the testimony, appears to remedy the defects the \nCourt has found in the 1992 procedure.\" Id. 15 To pass muster under the court's reasoning, the law school simply had to \nhave one committee that at one time during the process reviewed all applications and did not establish separate TI num-\nbers to define the presumptive denial categories. In other words, if the law school applied the same academic standards, \n\nPage 7 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nbut had commingled the minority review in the discretionary zone with the review of whites, its program would not \nhave been struck down. The same [**19]  admissions result would occur, but the process would be \"fair.\" Id.  \n \n15   Shortly before trial, apparently in response to the filing of this lawsuit, the law school modified its 1992 \nadmissions practices to fit the district court's view of the proper constitutional system. See id. at 582 n.87. \nFinally, the court determined that the only appropriate relief was a declaratory judgment and an order allowing the \nplaintiffs to reapply to the school without charge. Id. at 582-83. No compensatory or punitive damages, the court rea-\nsoned, could be awarded where the plaintiffs had proven no harm. Moreover, the court reasoned that as the law school \nhad promised to change its admissions program by abandoning the two-committee system, no prospective injunctive \nrelief was justified.  \n \nIII.  \nThe central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause \"is to prevent the States from purposefully discriminating be-\ntween individuals on the basis of race.\" Shaw v.  [*940]  Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 2824 \n(1993) (citing Washington v. Davis, [**20]  426 U.S. 229, 239, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976)). It seeks ulti-\nmately to render the issue of race irrelevant in governmental decisionmaking. See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432, \n80 L. Ed. 2d 421, 104 S. Ct. 1879 (1984) (\"A core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all gov-\nernmentally imposed discrimination.\")(footnote omitted). \nAccordingly, discrimination based upon race is highly suspect. \"Distinctions between citizens solely because of \ntheir ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equal-\nity,\" and \"racial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited . . . .\" Hirabayashi v. \nUnited States, 320 U.S. 81, 100, 87 L. Ed. 1774, 63 S. Ct. 1375 (1943). Hence, \"preferring members of any one group \nfor no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake. This the Constitution forbids.\" Regents \nof Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750, 98 S. Ct. 2733 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.); see also \nLoving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010, 87 S. Ct. 1817 (1967); Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, \n493-94, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954). These equal protection maxims apply to all races.  Adarand Constructors v. \nPena, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2111 (1995). \nIn order to preserve these [**21]  principles, the Supreme Court recently has required that any governmental action \nthat expressly distinguishes between persons on the basis of race be held to the most exacting scrutiny. See, e.g., id. at \n2113; Loving, 388 U.S. at 11. Furthermore, there is now absolutely no doubt that courts are to employ strict scrutiny 16 \nwhen evaluating all racial classifications, including those characterized by their proponents as \"benign\" or \"remedial.\" 17  \n \n16   In their initial brief on appeal, the defendants argued that intermediate scrutiny is appropriate here. In a sup-\nplemental brief filed to address the subsequent opinion in Adarand, they now acknowledge that strict scrutiny is \nthe appropriate test. \n17   Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2112-13 (overruling Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C., 497 U.S. 547, 111 L. Ed. 2d \n445, 110 S. Ct. 2997 (1990), insofar as it applied intermediate scrutiny to congressionally mandated \"benign\" ra-\ncial classifications); City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 495, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 \n(1989) (plurality opinion) (\"the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the \nrace of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification\"); id. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judg-\nment); Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 273, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986) (plurality \nopinion) (\"The level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a \ngroup that historically has not been subject to government discrimination.\"). \n [**22]  Strict scrutiny is necessary because the mere labeling of a classification by the government as \"benign\" or \n\"remedial\" is meaningless. As Justice O'Connor indicated in Croson: \n  \n   Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justifications for such race-based measures, there is simply \nno way of determining what classifications are \"benign\" or \"remedial\" and what classifications are in fact \nmotivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of \nstrict scrutiny is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing \na goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means cho-\nsen \"fit\" this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classi-\nfication was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.  \n\nPage 8 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n \n  \nId. at 493 (plurality opinion).  \nUnder the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions: (1) Does the racial classification serve a compelling gov-\nernment interest, and (2) is it narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal?  Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2111, 2117. As \nthe Adarand Court emphasized,  [**23]  strict scrutiny ensures that \"courts will consistently  [*941]  give racial classifi-\ncations . . . detailed examination both as to ends and as to means.\" Id. 18  \n \n18   While Adarand -- -- the Supreme Court's most recent opinion on racial preferences -- -- does not directly \naddress the application of the strict scrutiny test, it underscores the presumptive unconstitutionality of racial \nclassifications. \"By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a gov-\nernment classification based on race, which 'so seldom provides a relevant basis for disparate treatment,' Ful-\nlilove [v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 534, 65 L. Ed. 2d 902, 100 S. Ct. 2758 (1980)], (Stevens, J., dissenting), is le-\ngitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race.\" 115 S. Ct. at 2113.  \nFinally, when evaluating the proffered governmental interest for the specific racial classification, to decide whether \nthe program in question narrowly achieves that interest, we must recognize that \"the rights created by . . . the Fourteenth \n[**24]  Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights.\" Shelley v. \nKraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22, 92 L. Ed. 1161, 68 S. Ct. 836 (1948). 19 Thus, the Court consistently has rejected arguments \nconferring benefits on a person based solely upon his membership in a specific class of persons. 20  \n \n19   See also Adarand, id. at 2111 (\"Any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any government \nactor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment un-\nder the strictest judicial scrutiny.\").  \n20   See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-500 (holding that past societal discrimination against a group confers no \nbasis for local governments to provide a specifically tailored remedy to current members of that group); Wygant, \n478 U.S. at 275-76 (rejecting argument that governmental discrimination in teacher layoffs is allowed to foster \nrole models within a group). \nWith these general principles of equal protection in mind,  [**25]  we turn to the specific issue of whether the law \nschool's consideration of race as a factor in admissions violates the Equal Protection Clause. The district court found \nboth a compelling remedial and a non-remedial justification for the practice.  \nFirst, the court approved of the non-remedial goal of having a diverse student body, reasoning that \"obtaining the \neducational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body remains a sufficiently compelling in-\nterest to support the use of racial classifications.\" 861 F. Supp. at 571. Second, the court determined that the use of ra-\ncial classifications could be justified as a remedy for the \"present effects at the law school of past discrimination in both \nthe University of Texas system and the Texas educational system as a whole.\" Id. at 573.  \nA. \n1. \nJustice Powell's separate opinion in Bakke provided the original impetus for recognizing diversity as a compelling \nstate interest in higher education. In that case, Allan Bakke, a white male, was denied admission to the Medical School \nof the University of California at Davis, a state-run institution. Claiming that the State had discriminated against him \nimpermissibly [**26]  because it operated two separate admissions programs for the medical school, he brought suit \nunder the state constitution, title VI, and the Equal Protection Clause.  \nUnder the medical school's admissions system, the white applicants, who comprised the majority of the prospective \nstudents, applied through the general admissions program. A special admissions program was reserved for members of \n\"minority groups\" or groups designated as \"economically and/or educationally disadvantaged.\" The university set aside \nsixteen of the one hundred positions in the entering class for candidates from the special program.  \nThe California Supreme Court struck down the program on equal protection grounds, enjoined any consideration of \nrace in the admissions process, and ordered that Bakke be admitted. The United States Supreme Court affirmed in part \nand reversed in part in an opinion announced by Justice Powell. 438 U.S. at 271-72 (opinion of Powell, J.). The Court \nreached no consensus on a justification for its result, however. Six Justices filed opinions, none of which garnered more \nthan four votes (including  [*942]  the writer's). The two major opinions one four-Justice opinion by Justices Brennan, \n\nPage 9 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nWhite,  [**27]  Marshall, and Blackmun and one by Justice Stevens in which Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart \nand Rehnquist joined reflected completely contrary views of the law. \nWhile Justice Powell found the program unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause and affirmed Bakke's \nadmission, Justice Stevens declined to reach the constitutional issue and upheld Bakke's admission under title VI. Jus-\ntice Powell also concluded that the California Supreme Court's proscription of the consideration of race in admissions \ncould not be sustained. This became the judgment of the Court, as the four-Justice opinion by Justice Brennan opined \nthat racial classifications designed to serve remedial purposes should receive only intermediate scrutiny. These Justices \nwould have upheld the admissions program under this intermediate scrutiny, as it served the substantial and benign pur-\npose of remedying past societal discrimination. \nHence, Justice Powell's opinion has appeared to represent the \"swing vote,\" and though, in significant part, see id. \nat 272 n. *, it was joined by no other Justice, it has played a prominent role in subsequent debates concerning the impact \nof Bakke. 21 In the present [**28]  case, the significance of Justice Powell's opinion is its discussion of compelling state \ninterests under the Equal Protection Clause. See id. at 305-15. Specifically, after Justice Powell recognized that the \nproper level of review for racial classifications is strict scrutiny, id. at 305-06, he rejected and accepted respective justi-\nfications for the school's program as \"substantial enough to support the use of a suspect classification,\" id. at 306. Nota-\nbly, because the first step in reviewing an affirmative action program is a determination of the state's interests at stake, 22 \nit often is the determinative step. Justice Powell outlined the four state interests proffered by the Bakke defendants: \n  \n   The special admissions program purports to serve the purposes of: (i) \"reducing the historic deficit of \ntraditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession,\"; (ii) countering the \neffects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the number of physicians who will practice in commu-\nnities currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational benefits that flow from an ethnically di-\nverse student body. \n \n  \n Id. at 305-06 [**29]  (emphasis added, citation and footnote omitted).  \n \n21   See, e.g., Vincent Blasi, Bakke as Precedent: Does Mr. Justice Powell Have a Theory?, 67 CAL. L. REV. \n21, 24 (1979) (arguing that Bakke's precedential force is governed by the common conclusions of Justices Pow-\nell and Stevens, though it is erroneous to conclude that Powell's opinion has \"controlling significance on all \nquestions\"); Robert G. Dixon, Jr., Bakke: A Constitutional Analysis, 67 CAL. L. REV. 69 (1979) (Justice Pow-\nell's \"tiebreaking opinion . . . has acquired wide pragmatic appeal.\"). \n22   As affirmative action programs are by definition purposeful classifications by race, they do not present the \nproblem of governmental action that is facially neutral but has a disparate impact and is motivated by race. See \nCity of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450, 97 S. Ct. 555 \n(1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976). \nJustice Powell reasoned that the second and third justifications--remedying societal [**30]  discrimination and pro-\nviding role models--were never appropriate. 23 He determined that any remedial justification was limited to eliminating \n\"identified discrimination\" with \"disabling effects.\" Id. at 307 (citing the school desegregation cases). He specifically \nemphasized that a particularized finding of a constitutional or statutory violation must be present before a remedy is \njustified. He determined not only that such findings were not present in Bakke, but that the medical school was not even \nin a position to make such findings.  Id. at 309. \n \n23   The Supreme Court subsequently has agreed with that position. See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274-76 (plurality \nopinion). The district court a quo erred in suggesting that societal discrimination is constitutionally cognizable. \nSee 861 F. Supp. at 570 n.56, 571 n.60. \nJustice Powell further reasoned that diversity is a sufficient justification for limited  [*943]  racial classification. Id. \nat 311-16. \"[The attainment of a diverse student body] clearly [**31]  is a constitutionally permissible goal for an insti-\ntution of higher education.\" Id. at 311. He argued that diversity of minorities' viewpoints furthered \"academic freedom,\" \nan interest under the Constitution. While acknowledging that \"academic freedom\" does not appear as a constitutional \nright, he argued that it had \"long . . . been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" Id. at 312. 24  \n \n\nPage 10 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n24   See also Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1311, 77 S. Ct. 1203 (1957) (Frank-\nfurter, J., concurring in result) (recognizing four separate components of \"academic freedom\").  \nJustice Powell presented this \"special concern\" as in tension with the Fourteenth Amendment. \"Thus, in arguing that \nits universities must be accorded the right to select those students who will contribute the most to the 'robust exchange \nof ideas,' petitioner invokes a countervailing constitutional interest, that of the First Amendment.\" Id. at 313. 25 The Jus-\ntice then concluded that  \n  \n   an otherwise qualified medical student with [**32]  a particular background -- -- whether it be ethnic, \ngeographic, culturally advantaged or disadvantaged -- -- may bring to a professional school of medicine \nexperiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its student body and better equip its graduates \nto render with understanding their vital service to humanity. \n \n  \n Id. at 314 (footnote omitted). Justice Powell therefore approved of a consideration of ethnicity as \"one element in a \nrange of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.\" Id. \n \n25   Saying that a university has a First Amendment interest in this context is somewhat troubling. Both the \nmedical school in Bakke and, in our case, the law school are state institutions. The First Amendment generally \nprotects citizens from the actions of government, not government from its citizens. \nSignificantly, Sweezy involved a person who was called before the Attorney General of New Hampshire to \nanswer for alleged subversive activities. He declined on First Amendment grounds to answer questions about a \nlecture he had delivered at the University of New Hampshire. While Justice Frankfurter spoke of a university's \ninterest in openness and free inquiry, it was plainly through the First Amendment rights of individual scholars.  \n354 U.S. at 262, 266-67 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).  \n [**33]  The next step for Justice Powell was to decide whether the medical school's program was necessary to fur-\nther the goal of diversity. He said it was not. As the program made race the only determining factor for a certain number \nof the open spots that had been set aside, it did not further full diversity but only a conception of that term limited to \nrace.  \nJustice Powell speculated that a program in which \"race or ethnic background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular \napplicant's file, yet does not insulate the individual from comparison with all the other candidates for the available \nseats,\" might pass muster.  Id. at 317. The Justice did not define what he meant by a \"plus,\" but he did write that a \n\"plus\" program would be one in which an  \n  \n   applicant who loses out to another candidate receiving a 'plus' on the basis of ethnic background will \nnot have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply because he was not the right color or \nhad the wrong surname. It would only mean that his combined qualifications, which may have included \nsimilar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of another applicant. His qualifications would have \nbeen weighted fairly and [**34]  competitively, and he would have no basis to complaint of unequal \ntreatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n  \n Id. at 318.  \nUnder this conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, a program that considered a host of factors that include race \nwould be constitutional, even if an applicant's race \"tipped the scales\" among qualified applicants. What a school could \nnot do is to refuse to compare applicants of different races or establish a strict quota on the basis of race. In sum, Justice \nPowell found the school's program to be an unconstitutional  [*944]  \"quota\" system, but he intimated that the Constitu-\ntion would allow schools to continue to use race in a wide-ranging manner. \n2. \nHere, the plaintiffs argue that diversity is not a compelling governmental interest under superseding Supreme Court \nprecedent. Instead, they believe that the Court finally has recognized that only the remedial use of race is compelling. In \nthe alternative, the plaintiffs assert that the district court misapplied Justice Powell's Bakke standard, as the law school \nprogram here uses race as a strong determinant rather than a mere \"plus\" factor and, in any case, the preference is not \n\nPage 11 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nnarrowly applied. The [**35]  law school maintains, on the other hand, that Justice Powell's formulation in Bakke is law \nand must be followed at least in the context of higher education. \nWe agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the purpose of achiev-\ning a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Powell's argument in \nBakke garnered only his own vote and has never represented the view of a majority of the Court in Bakke or any other \ncase. Moreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state interests will \nnever justify racial classifications. Finally, the classification of persons on the basis of race for the purpose of diversity \nfrustrates, rather than facilitates, the goals of equal protection.  \nJustice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this issue. While he announced the judgment, no other \nJustice joined in that part of the opinion discussing the diversity rationale. In Bakke, the word \"diversity\" is mentioned \nnowhere except in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion. In fact, the four-Justice opinion, which would have upheld \nthe special [**36]  admissions program under intermediate scrutiny, implicitly rejected Justice Powell's position. See \n438 U.S. at 326 n.1 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting) \n(\"We also agree with Mr. Justice POWELL that a plan like the \"Harvard\" plan . . . is constitutional under our approach, \nat least so long as the use of race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of past \ndiscrimination.\") (emphasis added). Justice Stevens declined to discuss the constitutional issue. See id. at 412 (Stevens, \nJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).  \nThus, only one Justice concluded that race could be used solely for the reason of obtaining a heterogenous student \nbody. As the Adarand Court states, the Bakke Court did not express a majority view and is questionable as binding \nprecedent.  115 S. Ct. at 2109 (\"The Court's failure in Bakke . . . left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-\nbased government action.\"). \nSince Bakke, the Court has accepted the diversity rationale only once in its cases dealing with race. Significantly, \nhowever, in that case, Metro  [**37]   Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n, 497 U.S. 547, 564-65, \n111 L. Ed. 2d 445, 110 S. Ct. 2997 (1990), the five-Justice majority relied upon an intermediate scrutiny standard of \nreview to uphold the federal program seeking diversity in the ownership of broadcasting facilities. In Adarand, 115 S. \nCt. at 2112-13, the Court squarely rejected intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for racial classifications, and \nMetro Broadcasting is now specifically overruled to the extent that it was in conflict with this holding. Id. at 2113. No \ncase since Bakke has accepted diversity as a compelling state interest under a strict scrutiny analysis. \nIndeed, recent Supreme Court precedent shows that the diversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny. Foremost, \nthe Court appears to have decided that there is essentially only one compelling state interest to justify racial classifica-\ntions: remedying past wrongs. In Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (plurality opinion), the Court flatly stated that \"unless [racial \nclassifications] are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of  [*945]  racial inferiority \nand lead to a politics of racial hostility.\" (emphasis added). 26  [**38]   \n \n26   See also Milwaukee County Pavers Ass'n v. Fiedler, 922 F.2d 419, 422 (7th Cir.) (\"The whole point of Cro-\nson is that disadvantage, diversity, or other grounds favoring minorities will not justify governmental racial dis-\ncrimination . . .; only a purpose of remedying discrimination against minorities will do so.\") (emphasis added), \ncert. denied, 500 U.S. 954, 114 L. Ed. 2d 714, 111 S. Ct. 2261 (1991). \nNotably, Justice Scalia rejected the use of racial classifications \"in order (in a broad sense) 'to ameliorate the \neffects of past discrimination.'\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (quoting Cro-\nson, 488 U.S. at 476-77). He, however, suggested one other possible compelling state interest: a social emer-\ngency. He opined that \"where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of im-\nminent danger to life and limb\" will justify racial classifications. Croson, 488 U.S. at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring \nin judgment). While such an interest is probably consistent with the widely criticized holdings of Hirabayashi v. \nUnited States, 320 U.S. 81, 87 L. Ed. 1774, 63 S. Ct. 1375 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, \n89 L. Ed. 194, 65 S. Ct. 193 (1944), plainly such an interest is not presented in this case. \n [**39]  Justice O'Connor, in her Adarand-vindicated dissent in Metro Broadcasting, joined by Justices Rehnquist, \nScalia, and Kennedy, explained this position: \n  \n   Modern equal protection has recognized only one [compelling state] interest: remedying the effects of \nracial discrimination. The interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a \n\nPage 12 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \ncompelling interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial, and too unrelated to any legitimate ba-\nsis for employing racial classifications. \n \n  \n 497 U.S. at 612 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Indeed, the majority in Metro Broadcasting had not claimed otherwise and \ndecided only that such an interest was \"important.\" Justice Thomas, who joined the Court after Metro Broadcasting was \ndecided, roundly condemned \"benign\" discrimination in his recent Adarand opinion, in which he suggests that the di-\nversity rationale is inadequate to meet strict scrutiny. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring in part \nand concurring in judgment). 27  \n \n27   The law school places much reliance upon Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wygant for the proposition \nthat Justice Powell's Bakke formulation is still viable. In her 1986 Wygant opinion, in the context of discussing \nJustice Powell's opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that \"although its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest \nin the promotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher edu-\ncation, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.\" 476 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor, J., con-\ncurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  \nThe law school's argument is not persuasive. Justice O'Connor's statement is purely descriptive and did not \npurport to express her approval or disapproval of diversity as a compelling interest. Her subsequent statements \noutlined above in Croson and Metro Broadcasting suggest strongly that reliance upon this statement in Wygant \nis unjustified. \n [**40]  In short, there has been no indication from the Supreme Court, other than Justice Powell's lonely opinion in \nBakke, that the state's interest in diversity constitutes a compelling justification for governmental race-based discrimina-\ntion. Subsequent Supreme Court caselaw strongly suggests, in fact, that it is not. \nWithin the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher \neducation contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use \nof race. It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals. It may further remedial purposes but, just as likely, \nmay promote improper racial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility. \nThe use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply achieves a student body that looks different. Such a crite-\nrion is no more rational on its own terms than would be choices based upon the physical size or blood type of appli-\ncants. Thus, the Supreme Court has long held that governmental actors cannot justify their decisions solely because of \nrace. See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 496 (plurality opinion); Bakke, 438 U.S. at [**41]  307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \nAccordingly, we see the caselaw as sufficiently established that the use of ethnic diversity simply to achieve racial \nheterogeneity,  [*946]  even as part of the consideration of a number of factors, is unconstitutional. Were we to decide \notherwise, we would contravene precedent that we are not authorized to challenge. \nWhile the use of race per se is proscribed, state-supported schools may reasonably consider a host of factors -- -- \nsome of which may have some correlation with race -- -- in making admissions decisions. The federal courts have no \nwarrant to intrude on those executive and legislative judgments unless the distinctions intrude on specific provisions of \nfederal law or the Constitution. A university may properly favor one applicant over another because of his ability to \nplay the cello, make a downfield tackle, or understand chaos theory. An admissions process may also consider an appli-\ncant's home state or relationship to school alumni. Law schools specifically may look at things such as unusual or sub-\nstantial extracurricular activities in college, which may be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades. Schools may \neven consider factors such [**42]  as whether an applicant's parents attended college or the applicant's economic and \nsocial background. 28  \n \n28   The law school's admissions program makes no distinction among black and Mexican American applicants \nin an effort to determine which of them, for example, may have been culturally or educationally disadvantaged. \nFor this reason, race often is said to be justified in the diversity context, not on its own terms, but as a proxy for \nother characteristics that institutions of higher education value but that do not raise similar constitutional concerns. 29 \nUnfortunately, this approach simply replicates the very harm that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to eliminate.  \n \n29   For example, Justice Powell apparently felt that persons with different ethnic backgrounds would bring di-\nverse \"experiences, outlooks, and ideas\" to the medical school.  Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314 (opinion of Powell, J.). \n\nPage 13 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n [**43]  The assumption is that a certain individual possesses characteristics by virtue of being a member of a cer-\ntain racial group. This assumption, however, does not withstand scrutiny. \"The use of a racial characteristic to establish \na presumption that the individual also possesses other, and socially relevant, characteristics, exemplifies, encourages, \nand legitimizes the mode of thought and behavior that underlies most prejudice and bigotry in modern America.\" Rich-\nard A. Posner, The DeFunis Case and the Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment of Racial Minorities, 1974 SUP. \nCT. REV. 12 (1974). \nTo believe that a person's race controls his point of view is to stereotype him. The Supreme Court, however, \"has \nremarked a number of times, in slightly different contexts, that it is incorrect and legally inappropriate to impute to \nwomen and minorities 'a different attitude about such issues as the federal budget, school prayer, voting, and foreign \nrelations.'\" Michael S. Paulsen, Reverse Discrimination and Law School Faculty Hiring: The Undiscovered Opinion, 71 \nTEX. L. REV. 993, 1000 (1993) (quoting Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627-28, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462, 104 \nS. Ct. 3244 (1984)). \"Social scientists [**44]  may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior reflect their background, \nbut the Constitution provides that the government may not allocate benefits or burdens among individuals based on the \nassumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or think.\" Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J., \ndissenting). 30  \n \n30   Thus, to put it simply, under the Equal Protection Clause  \n  \n   the distribution of benefits and costs by government on racial or ethnic grounds is impermissi-\nble. Even though it is frequently efficient to sort people by race or ethnic origin, because racial or \nethnic identity may be a good proxy for functional classifications, efficiency is rejected as a basis \nfor governmental action in this context. \n \n  \nPosner, supra, at 22. \nInstead, individuals, with their own conceptions of life, further diversity of viewpoint. Plaintiff Hopwood is a fair \nexample of an applicant with a unique background. She is the now-thirty-two-year-old wife of a member of the Armed \nForces stationed [**45]  in San Antonio and, more significantly, is raising a severely handicapped child. Her circum-\nstance would bring a different perspective to the law school. The school might consider this an  [*947]  advantage to her \nin the application process, or it could decide that her family situation would be too much of a burden on her academic \nperformance.  \nWe do not opine on which way the law school should weigh Hopwood's qualifications; we only observe that \"di-\nversity\" can take many forms. To foster such diversity, state universities and law schools and other governmental enti-\nties must scrutinize applicants individually, rather than resorting to the dangerous proxy of race. 31  \n \n31   We recognize that the use of some factors such as economic or educational background of one's parents may \nbe somewhat correlated with race. This correlation, however, will not render the use of the factor unconstitu-\ntional if it is not adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of race. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 \nU.S. 279, 95 L. Ed. 2d 262, 107 S. Ct. 1756 (1987). As Justice O'Connor indicated in Hernandez v. New York, \n500 U.S. 352, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395, 111 S. Ct. 1859 (1991), which was a challenge under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 \nU.S. 79, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986), based upon the prosecution's strike of potential jurors who \nspoke Spanish: \n  \n   No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race the explanation for a peremptory \nstrike may be, the strike does not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race. \nThat is the distinction between disproportionate effect, which is not sufficient to constitute an \nequal protection violation, and intentional discrimination, which is. \n \n  \n500 U.S. at 375 (O'Connor, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \n [**46]  The Court also has recognized that government's use of racial classifications serves to stigmatize. See, e.g., \nBrown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954) (observing that classification on the \nbasis of race \"generates a feeling of inferiority\"). While one might argue that the stigmatization resulting from so-called \n\nPage 14 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n\"benign\" racial classifications is not as harmful as that arising from invidious ones, 32 the current Court has now re-\ntreated from the idea that so-called benign and invidious classifications may be distinguished. 33 As the plurality in Cro-\nson warned, \"classifications based on race carry the danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are reserved for remedial \nsettings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to the politics of racial hostility.\" 488 U.S. at \n493. 34  \n \n32   According to one of the four-Justice opinions in Bakke, racial classifications stigmatize when \"they are \ndrawn on the presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government be-\nhind racial hatred and separation.\" 438 U.S. at 357-58 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring \nin the judgment in part and dissenting in part).  \nIn Bakke, however, these Justices rejected strict scrutiny because the program at issue could not be said to \nstigmatize as did other racial classifications.  \nThese Justices nevertheless recognized that rational-basis scrutiny would not be enough.  Id. at 361 (Bren-\nnan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). \n [**47]  \n33   As Judge Posner has indicated, \n  \n   the proper constitutional principle is not, no \"invidious\" racial or ethnic discrimination, but no \nuse of racial or ethnic criteria to determine the distribution of government benefits and burdens . . \n. . To ask whether racial exclusion may not have overriding benefits for both races in particular \ncircumstances is to place the antidiscrimination principle at the mercy of the vagaries of empirical \nconjecture and thereby free the judge to enact his personal values into constitutional doctrine. \n \n  \nPosner, supra, at 25-26. \n34   See also Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"But \nthere can be no doubt that racial paternalism and its unintended consequences may be as poisonous and perni-\ncious as any other form of discrimination.\"). One prominent constitutional commentator specifically has noted \nthat where programs involve lower and separate standards of selection, \"a new badge of implied inferiority, as-\nsigned as an incident of governmental noblesse oblige,\" results.  \n  \n   Explicit in state, local, or federal plans using separate and lower standards by race is a statement \nby government that certain persons identified by race are in fact being placed in positions they \nmay be presumed not likely to hold but for their race (because they are presumed to be unable to \nmeet standards the government itself requires to be met). The message from government is writ-\nten very large when these plans proliferate: a double (and softer) standard for admission, a double \n(and softer) standard for hiring, a double (and softer) standard for promotion, a double (and \nsofter) standard for competitive bidding, and so on. Without question, this is a systematic racial \ntagging by government a communication to others that the race of the individual they deal with \nbespeaks a race-related probability, created solely by the government itself, of lesser qualification \nthan others holding equivalent positions. \n \n  \nWilliam Van Alstyne, Rites of Passage: Race, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution, 46 U. CHI. L. REV. \n775, 787 n.38 (1979). \n [**48]  Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the ultimate goal of the Fourteenth  [*948]  Amend-\nment: the end of racially motivated state action. Justice Powell's conception of race as a \"plus\" factor would allow race \nalways to be a potential factor in admissions decisionmaking. While Justice Blackmun recognized the tension inherent \nin using race-conscious remedies to achieve a race-neutral society, he nevertheless accepted it as necessary.  Bakke, 438 \nU.S. at 405. Several Justices who, unlike Justices Powell and Blackmun, are still on the Court, have now renounced \ntoleration of this tension, however. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 495 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) (\"The dissent's wa-\ntered down version of equal protection review effectively assures that race will always be relevant in American life, and \nthat the 'ultimate goal' of 'eliminating entirely from government decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human be-\ning's race . . . will never be achieved.\") (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 320 (Stevens, J., dissenting)). 35  \n\nPage 15 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n \n35   As professor Van Alstyne has argued: \n  \n   Rather, one gets beyond racism by getting beyond it now: by a complete, resolute, and credible \ncommitment never to tolerate in one's own life -- -- or in the life or practices of one's government \n-- -- the differential treatment of other human beings by race. Indeed, that is the great lesson for \ngovernment itself to teach: in all we do in life, whatever we do in life, to treat any person less \nwell than another or to favor any more than another for being black or white or brown or red, is \nwrong. Let that be our fundamental law and we shall have a Constitution universally worth ex-\npounding. \n \n  \nVan Alstyne, supra note 34, at 809-10. \n [**49]  In sum, the use of race to achieve a diverse student body, whether as a proxy for permissible characteris-\ntics, simply cannot be a state interest compelling enough to meet the steep standard of strict scrutiny. 36 These latter fac-\ntors may, in fact, turn out to be substantially correlated with race, but the key is that race itself not be taken into account. \nThus, that portion of the district court's opinion upholding the diversity rationale is reversibly flawed. 37  \n \n36   Because we have determined that any consideration of race by the law school is constitutionally impermis-\nsible if justified by diversity, it is not necessary to determine whether, as plaintiffs argue, the admissions system \nunder which the plaintiffs applied operated as a de facto \"quota\" system similar to the one struck down in Bakke. \nWe do note that even if a \"plus\" system were permissible, it likely would be impossible to maintain such a sys-\ntem without degeneration into nothing more than a \"quota\" program. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 378 (\"For purposes \nof constitutional adjudication, there is no difference between [setting aside a certain number of places for mi-\nnorities and using minority status as a positive factor].\") (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concur-\nring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, in this case, the law school appeared to be especially \nadept at meeting its yearly \"goals.\" See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 574 n.67.  \n [**50]  \n37   Plaintiffs additionally have argued that the law school's program was not narrowly tailored in the diversity \ncontext because (1) it failed to award preferences to non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, \nAmerican Indians, or other minorities, and (2) it failed to accord as much weight to non-racial diversity factors, \nsuch as religion and socioeconomic background, as it did to race. \nB. \nWe now turn to the district court's determination that \"the remedial purpose of the law school's affirmative action \nprogram is a compelling government objective.\" 861 F. Supp. at 573. The plaintiffs argue that the court erred by finding \nthat the law school could employ racial criteria to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in Texas's primary \nand secondary schools. The plaintiffs contend that the proper unit for analysis is the law school, and the state has shown \nno recognizable present effects of the law school's past discrimination. The law school, in response, notes Texas's well-\ndocumented history of discrimination in education and argues that its effects continue today at the law school,  [**51]  \nboth in the level of educational attainment of the average minority applicant and in the school's reputation. \nIn contrast to its approach to the diversity rationale, a majority of the Supreme Court has held that a state actor may \nracially classify where it has a \"strong basis in the evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Cro-\nson, 488 U.S. at 500 [*949]  (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion)). Generally, \"in order to justify an \naffirmative action program, the State must show there are 'present effects of past discrimination.'\" Hopwood v. Texas \n(\"Hopwood I\"), 38 21 F.3d 603, 605 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (quoting Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 57 (4th \nCir. 1992), cert. denied, 131 L. Ed. 2d 1002, 115 S. Ct. 2001 (1995)); see also Wygant, 476 U.S. at 280 (opining that \"in \norder to remedy the effects of prior discrimination, it may be necessary to take race into account\") (opinion of Powell, \nJ.). 39  \n \n38   Hopwood I is the first appeal of the intervention issue that we address infra. \n39   Unfortunately, the precise scope of allowable state action is of somewhat undefined contours. Indeed, it is \nnot evident whether permitted remedial action extends to the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" This lan-\n\nPage 16 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nguage, derived from Justice Brennan's opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 362-66, appears intended to present little \nresistance to wide-ranging affirmative action plans.  \nWhile Justice Brennan began by stating that schools have a duty affirmatively to erase the vestiges of their \npast discriminatory practices, he compared this duty to the power of Congress to enforce ß 1 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment through ß 5. He reasoned that under that wide-ranging power, the beneficiaries of such a program \nneed not present proof that they were discriminated against; a showing that they were in the general class was \nsufficient.  \nId. at 363-64. Nor would a school need judicial findings of past discrimination.  Id. at 364. Finally, he ar-\ngued that such beneficiaries would not even have to show that that school had a history of past discrimination, \nbut need only suggest that they were the victims of general societal discrimination that prevented them from be-\ning otherwise qualified to enter the school.  Id. at 365-66. Hence, under this standard, almost any school could \nadopt an affirmative action plan. \nThere is no question, however, that subsequent Supreme Court opinions, notably Wygant and Croson, have \nrejected broad state programs that purport to be remedial and that, presumably, would have satisfied Justice \nBrennan's standard for meeting the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" And some members of the Court \nwould limit any remedial purpose to the actual victims of discrimination. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2118 \n(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"Government can never have a 'compelling interest' \nin discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direc-\ntion.\"). Nevertheless, we will not eschew use of the phrase \"present effects of past discrimination,\" as we used \nthis language in Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 605, and another circuit did so in Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, \n153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 131 L. Ed. 2d 1002, 115 S. Ct. 2001 (1995). We will, however, limit its appli-\ncation in accordance with Wygant and Croson.  \n- \n [**52]  Because a state does not have a compelling state interest in remedying the present effects of past societal \ndiscrimination, however, we must examine the district court's legal determination that the relevant governmental entity \nis the system of education within the state as a whole. Moreover, we also must review the court's identification of what \ntypes of present effects of past discrimination, if proven, would be sufficient under strict scrutiny review. Finally, where \nthe state actor puts forth a remedial justification for its racial classifications, the district court must make a \"factual de-\ntermination\" as to whether remedial action is necessary.  Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277-78. We review such factual rulings \nfor clear error. \n1. \nThe Supreme Court has \"insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved be-\nfore allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274 (plu-\nrality opinion of Powell, J.) (citing Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 53 L. Ed. 2d 768, 97 S. Ct. \n2736 (1977)). 40 In Wygant, the Court analyzed a collective bargaining agreement between a school board and a \nteacher's union [**53]  that allowed the board to give minorities preferential treatment in the event of layoffs. A plural-\nity rejected the theory that such a program was justified because it  [*950]  provided minority role models. Id. at 274-77 \n(plurality opinion). Such a claim was based upon remedying \"societal discrimination,\" a rationale the Court consistently \nhas rejected as a basis for affirmative action. Accordingly, the state's use of remedial racial classifications is limited to \nthe harm caused by a specific state actor. 41  \n \n40   See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286 (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"The \nCourt is in agreement that whatever the formulation employed, remedying past or present racial discrimination \nby a state actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant remedial use of a carefully constructed affirma-\ntive action program.\"). \n41   See also id. at 288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"I agree with the plurality \nthat a government agency's interest in remedying 'societal' discrimination, that is discrimination not traceable to \nits own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster under strict scrutiny.\").  \n [**54]  Moreover, the plurality in Wygant held that before a state actor properly could implement such a plan, it \n\"must ensure that . . . it has strong evidence that remedial action is warranted.\" Id. at 277. Accord id. at 289 (O'Connor, \nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The plurality felt that \"in the absence of particularized findings, a \n\nPage 17 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \ncourt could uphold remedies that are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\" \nId. at 276. \nThe Croson Court further discussed how to identify the relevant past discriminator. Writing for the Court, Justice \nO'Connor struck down a minority business set-aside program implemented by the City of Richmond and justified on \nremedial grounds. While the district court opined that sufficient evidence had been found by the city to believe that such \na program was necessary to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in the construction industry, the Court \nheld:  \n  \n   Like the \"role model\" theory employed in Wygant, a generalized assertion that there had been past dis-\ncrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to determine the precise \n[**55]  scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. It 'has no logical stopping point.' Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 \n(plurality opinion). 'Relief' for such an ill-defined wrong could extend until the percentage of public con-\ntracts awarded to [minority businesses] in Richmond mirrored the percentage of minorities in the popula-\ntion as a whole. \n \n  \n 488 U.S. at 498. 42 The Court refused to accept indicia of past discrimination in anything but \"the Richmond construc-\ntion industry.\" Id. at 505. \n \n42   Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Stevens, and Kennedy in this \nportion of the opinion. \nIn addition, in a passage of particular significance to the instant case, the Court analogized the employment contrac-\ntor situation to that of higher education and noted that \"like claims that discrimination in primary and secondary school-\ning justifies a rigid racial preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous claim that there has been past dis-\ncrimination in a particular industry cannot justify [**56]  the use of an unyielding quota.\" Id. at 499. Such claims were \nbased upon \"sheer speculation\" about how many minorities would be in the contracting business absent past discrimina-\ntion. Id.  \nApplying the teachings of Croson and Wygant, we conclude that the district court erred in expanding the remedial \njustification to reach all public education within the State of Texas. The Supreme Court repeatedly has warned that the \nuse of racial remedies must be carefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a state addresses a putative \ninjury that is vague and amorphous. It has \"no logical stopping point.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality opinion).  \nThe district court's holding employs no viable limiting principle. If a state can \"remedy\" the present effects of past \ndiscrimination in its primary and secondary schools, it also would be allowed to award broad-based preferences in hir-\ning, government contracts, licensing, and any other state activity that in some way is affected by the educational attain-\nment of the applicants. This very argument was made in Croson and rejected: \n  \n   The \"evidence\" relied upon by the dissent, history of school desegregation [**57]  in Richmond and \nnumerous congressional reports, does little to define the scope of any injury  [*951]  to minority contrac-\ntors in Richmond or the necessary remedy. The factors relied upon by the dissent could justify a prefer-\nence of any size or duration.  \n \n  \n 488 U.S. at 505. The defendants' argument here is equally expansive. 43  \n \n43   The fact that the plaintiffs named the State of Texas as one defendant does not mean that it is proper to scru-\ntinize the state as the relevant past discriminator. This argument confuses a theory of liability with a justification \nfor a limited racial remedy. The State of Texas simply may be responsible for the wrongs of the law school, \nwhich is a governmental entity the state has created. The Supreme Court, however, has limited the remedial in-\nterest to the harm wrought by a specific governmental unit. \nStrict scrutiny is meant to ensure that the purpose of a racial preference is remedial. Yet when one state actor begins \nto justify racial preferences based upon the actions of other state [**58]  agencies, the remedial actor's competence to \ndetermine the existence and scope of the harmand the appropriate reach of the remedy is called into question. The \nschool desegregation cases, for example, concentrate on school districts, singular government units and the use of in-\n\nPage 18 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nterdistrict remedies is strictly limited. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 132 L. Ed. 2d 63, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 2048 (1995); Milliken \nv. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 745, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1069, 94 S. Ct. 3112 (1974) (\"Without an interdistrict violation and interdis-\ntrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.\"). Thus, one justification for limiting the \nremedial powers of a state actor is that the specific agency involved is best able to measure the harm of its past dis-\ncrimination.  \nHere, however, the law school has no comparative advantage in measuring the present effects of discrimination in \nprimary and secondary schools in Texas. Such a task becomes even more improbable where, as here, benefits are con-\nferred on students who attended out-of-state or private schools for such education. Such boundless \"remedies\" raise a \nconstitutional concern beyond mere competence. In this situation, an inference is raised that the program was the result \nof [**59]  racial social engineering rather a desire to implement a remedy. \nNo one disputes that in the past, Texas state actors have discriminated against some minorities in public schools. In \nthis sense, some lingering effects of such discrimination is not \"societal,\" if that term is meant to exclude all state action. \nBut the very program at issue here shows how remedying such past wrongs may be expanded beyond any reasonable \nlimits.  \nEven if, arguendo, the state is the proper government unit to scrutinize, the law school's admissions program would \nnot withstand our review. For the admissions scheme to pass constitutional muster, the State of Texas, through its legis-\nlature, would have to find that past segregation has present effects; it would have to determine the magnitude of those \npresent effects; and it would need to limit carefully the \"plus\" given to applicants to remedy that harm. A broad program \nthat sweeps in all minorities with a remedy that is in no way related to past harms cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. \nObviously, none of those predicates has been satisfied here. \nWe further reject the proposition that the University of Texas System, rather than the law school, is [**60]  the ap-\npropriate governmental unit for measuring a constitutional remedy. The law school operates as a functionally separate \nunit within the system. As with all law schools, it maintains its own separate admissions program. The law school hires \nfaculty members that meet the unique requirements of a law school and has its own deans for administrative purposes. \nThus, for much the same reason that we rejected the educational system as the proper measure generally ensuring that \nthe legally-imposed racially discriminatory program is remedial we conclude that the University of Texas System is \nitself too expansive an entity to scrutinize for past discrimination. 44  \n \n44   And again, any such remedy here would be grossly speculative. As the defendants concede and the district \ncourt found, there is no recent history of overt sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas.  Hopwood, \n861 F. Supp. at 572. Nor does the record even suggest such discrimination at any of the other component \nschools of the University of Texas System. Thus, any harm caused to the students of those institutions would be \nthe result of the present effects of past discrimination.  \nWe do note that the law school is not autonomous. In Texas, the management of higher education has been \ndivided by the legislature into different \"systems.\" See 12 TEX. JUR. 3D, Colleges and Universities ß 2 (1993). \nThe University of Texas at Austin, with which the law school is associated, is part of the University of Texas \nSystem. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. ßß 67.01 to 67.62 (West 1991). Accordingly, the legislature, which has ulti-\nmate control over the school, has delegated its \"management and control\" to the regents of the University of \nTexas System. Id. ß 67.02. Thus, the law school is governed by both the legislature and the university's board of \nregents.  \nYet, while the state's higher authorities may have the power to require the law school to remedy its past \nwrongs, they may do so consistently with the Constitution only if the remedial actions are directed at the law \nschool. This requirement is what the Supreme Court dictated by limiting the remedial purpose to the \"govern-\nmental unit involved.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274 (plurality opinion).  \n [**61]   [*952]  In sum, for purposes of determining whether the law school's admissions system properly can act \nas a remedy for the present effects of past discrimination, we must identify the law school as the relevant alleged past \ndiscriminator. The fact that the law school ultimately may be subject to the directives of others, such as the board of \nregents, the university president, or the legislature, does not change the fact that the relevant putative discriminator in \nthis case is still the law school. In order for any of these entities to direct a racial preference program at the law school, \nit must be because of past wrongs at that school. \n2. \n\nPage 19 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nNext, the relevant governmental discriminator must prove that there are present effects of past discrimination of the \ntype that justify the racial classifications at issue:  \n  \n   To have a present effect of past discrimination sufficient to justify the program, the party seeking to \nimplement the program must, at a minimum, prove that the effect it proffers is caused by the past dis-\ncrimination and that the effect is of sufficient magnitude to justify the program. \n \n  \n Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, [**62]  131 L. Ed. 2d 1002, 115 S. Ct. 2001 \n(1995). Moreover, as part of showing that the alleged present effects of past discrimination in fact justify the racial pref-\nerence program at issue, the law school must show that it adopted the program specifically to remedy the identified pre-\nsent effects of the past discrimination. \nHere, according to the district court: \"The evidence presented at trial indicates those effects include the law school's \nlingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with prospective students, as a \"white\" school; an under-\nrepresentation of minorities in the student body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile environment for \nminorities.\" 861 F. Supp. at 572. Plaintiffs now argue that these three alleged effects are at most examples of societal \ndiscrimination, which the Supreme Court has found not to be a valid remedial basis. \"The effects must themselves be \nexamined to see whether they were caused by the past discrimination and whether they are of a type that justifies the \nprogram.\" Podberesky, 38 F.3d at 154. \nAs a legal matter, the district court erred in concluding that the first and third effects it identified bad reputation and \nhostile environment were [**63]  sufficient to sustain the use of race in the admissions process. The Fourth Circuit ex-\namined similar arguments in Podberesky, a recent case that struck down the use of race-based scholarships. The univer-\nsity in that case sought, in part, to justify a separate scholarship program based solely upon race because of the univer-\nsity's \"poor reputation within the African-American community\" and because \"the atmosphere on campus [was] per-\nceived as being hostile to African-American students.\" Id. at 152. \nThe Podberesky court rejected the notion that either of these rationales could support the single-race scholarship \nprogram. The court reasoned that any poor reputation by the school \"is tied solely to knowledge of the University's dis-\ncrimination before it admitted African-American students.\" Id. at 154. The court found that \"mere knowledge of histori-\ncal fact is not the kind of present effect that can justify a race-exclusive remedy. If it were otherwise, as long as there are \npeople  [*953]  who have access to history books, there will be programs such as this.\" Id. \nWe concur in the Fourth Circuit's observation that knowledge of historical fact simply cannot justify current racial \n[**64]  classifications. Even if, as the defendants argue, the law school may have a bad reputation in the minority com-\nmunity, \"the case against race-based preferences does not rest on the sterile assumption that American society is un-\ntouched or unaffected by the tragic oppression of its past.\" Maryland Troopers Ass'n v. Evans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1079 (4th \nCir. 1993). \"Rather, it is the very enormity of that tragedy that lends resolve to the desire to never repeat it, and find a \nlegal order in which distinctions based on race shall have no place.\" Id. Moreover, we note that the law school's argu-\nment is even weaker than that of the university in Podberesky, as there is no dispute that the law school has never had \nan admissions policy that excluded Mexican Americans on the basis of race.  \nThe Podberesky court rejected the hostile-environment claims by observing that the \"effects\" that is, racial tensions \nwere the result of present societal discrimination.  38 F.3d at 155. There was simply no showing of action by the uni-\nversity that contributed to any racial tension. Similarly, one cannot conclude that the law school's past discrimination \nhas created any current hostile environment [**65]  for minorities. While the school once did practice de jure discrimi-\nnation in denying admission to blacks, the Court in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 94 L. Ed. 1114, 70 S. Ct. 848 \n(1950), struck down the law school's program. Any other discrimination by the law school ended in the 1960's.  Hop-\nwood, 861 F. Supp. at 555.  \nBy the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first program designed to recruit minorities, id. at 557, and it \nnow engages in an extensive minority recruiting program that includes a significant amount of scholarship money. The \nvast majority of the faculty, staff, and students at the law school had absolutely nothing to do with any discrimination \nthat the law school practiced in the past.  \nIn such a case, one cannot conclude that a hostile environment is the present effect of past discrimination. Any ra-\ncial tension at the law school is most certainly the result of present societal discrimination and, if anything, is contrib-\nuted to, rather than alleviated by, the overt and prevalent consideration of race in admissions. \n\nPage 20 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nEven if the law school's alleged current lingering reputation in the minority community and the perception that the \nschool is a hostile environment for minorities were [**66]  considered to be the present effects of past discrimination, \nrather than the result of societal discrimination, they could not constitute compelling state interests justifying the use of \nracial classifications in admissions. A bad reputation within the minority community is alleviated not by the considera-\ntion of race in admissions, but by school action designed directly to enhance its reputation in that community.  \nMinority students who are aided by the law school's racial preferences have already made the decision to apply, de-\nspite the reputation. And, while prior knowledge that they will get a \"plus\" might make potential minorities more likely \nto apply, such an inducement does nothing, per se, to change any hostile environment. As we have noted, racial prefer-\nences, if anything, can compound the problem of a hostile environment. 45  \n \n45   The testimony of several minority students underscores this point.  \nThey stated generally that they felt that other students did not respect them because the other students as-\nsumed that minorities attained admission because of the racial preference program. \n [**67]  The law school wisely concentrates only on the second effect the district court identified: underrepresenta-\ntion of minorities because of past discrimination. The law school argues that we should consider the prior discrimination \nby the State of Texas and its educational system rather than of the law school. The school contends that this prior dis-\ncrimination by the state had a direct effect on the educational attainment of the pool of minority applicants and that the \ndiscriminatory admissions program was implemented partially to discharge the school's duty of eliminating the vestiges \nof past segregation. \nAs we have noted, the district court accepted the law school's argument that past  [*954]  discrimination on the part \nof the Texas school system (including primary and secondary schools), reaching back perhaps as far as the education of \nthe parents of today's students, justifies the current use of racial classifications. 46 No one disputes that Texas has a his-\ntory of racial discrimination in education. We have already discussed, however, that the Croson Court unequivocally \nrestricted the proper scope of the remedial interest to the state actor that had previously discriminated.  488 U.S.  [**68]  \nat 499. The district court squarely found that \"in recent history, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned dis-\ncrimination at the University of Texas.\" 861 F. Supp. at 572. As a result, past discrimination in education, other than at \nthe law school, cannot justify the present consideration of race in law school admissions.  \n \n46   The argument is that because the state discriminated in its primary and secondary school systems, the stu-\ndents' educational attainment was adversely affected, and this harm extended to their higher education, thus jus-\ntifying giving current applicants a \"plus\" based on race. This reasoning is especially important in justifying \nbenefits for Mexican Americans, as there is no evidence that the law school implemented de jure (or even de \nfacto) discrimination against this group in its admissions process. Because this logic ignores the relevant actions \nin this case, i.e., discrimination by the law school, it is not necessary for us to examine the potential causational \nflaws in the argument. \nMoreover, if we did find that the past wrongs of Texas school districts were the sort of discrimination that \nthe law school could address, the school still would have to prove the present effects of that past wrong. Without \nsome strong evidence in the record showing that today's law school applicants still bear the mark of those past \nsystems, such effects seem grossly speculative. The district court simply assumed that \"this segregation has \nhandicapped the educational achievement of many minorities. . . .\" 861 F. Supp. at 573. And we would still have \nto ask whether the program was narrowly tailored to this goal. \n [**69]  The law school now attempts to circumvent this result by claiming that its racial preference program is \nreally a \"State of Texas\" plan rather than a law school program. Under the law school's reading of the facts, its program \nwas the direct result of the state's negotiations with what was then the United States Department of Health, Education \nand Welfare's Office for Civil Rights (\"OCR\"). To bring the Texas public higher education system into compliance with \ntitle VI, the state adopted the so-called \"Texas Plan.\" \nIn light of our preceding discussion on the relevant governmental unit, this argument is inapposite. Even if the law \nschool were specifically ordered to adopt a racial preference program, its implementation at the law school would have \nto meet the requirements of strict scrutiny. 47  \n \n47   To the extent that the OCR has required actions that conflict with the Constitution, the directives cannot \nstand. The Supreme Court has addressed required state compliance with federal law in the voting rights context.  \n\nPage 21 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nMiller v. Johnson, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2491 (1995) (\"As we suggested in Shaw[v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 2830-31 (1993)], compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws \ncannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitu-\ntional reading and application of those laws.\") (emphasis added). \n [**70]  Moreover, these alleged actions in the 1980's are largely irrelevant for purposes of this appeal. There is no \nindication that the Texas Plan imposed a direct obligation upon the law school. To the contrary, the law school's admis-\nsions program was self-initiated. Moreover, the current admissions program was formulated primarily in the 1990's, and \nthe district court did not hold otherwise. See 861 F. Supp. at 557 (\"Against this historical backdrop [including Texas's \ndealing with the OCR], the law school's commitment to affirmative action in the admissions process evolved.\"). Thus it \nis no more correct to say that the State of Texas implemented the program at issue than it is to assert that the Common-\nwealth of Virginia, not the City of Richmond, was responsible for the minority set-aside program in Croson. \nThe district court also sought to find a remedial justification for the use of race and, at the same time, attempted to \ndistinguish Croson using United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 120 L. Ed. 2d 575, 112 S. Ct. 2727 (1992). The court \nheld that the law school had a compelling interest to \"desegregate\" the school through affirmative action.  [*955]  The \nreliance upon Fordice is misplaced, however. The [**71]  district court held that Fordice's mandate to schools \"to elimi-\nnate every vestige of racial segregation and discrimination\" made Croson inapplicable, 861 F. Supp. at 571, and rea-\nsoned that this mandate includes the effects of such prior practices or policies. \nFordice does not overrule Croson. The central holding of Fordice is that a state or one of its subdivisions must act \nto repudiate the continuing \"policies or practices\" of discrimination.  505 U.S. at 731-32. 48 In other words, a state has an \naffirmative duty to remove policies, tied to the past, by which it continues to discriminate. The Fordice Court did not \naddress, in any way, a state actor's duty to counter the present effects of past discrimination that it did not cause. 49  \n \n48   In more detail, the Fordice Court said the following:  \n  \n   If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have \nsegregative effects -- -- whether by influencing student enrollment or by fostering segregation in \nother facets of the university system -- -- and such policies are without sound educational justifi-\ncation and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it \nhas dismantled its prior system. \n \n  \n505 U.S. at 731. \n [**72]  \n49   In Croson, Justice O'Connor did argue that a state may act to prevent its powers from being used to support \nprivate discrimination.  488 U.S. at 491-92 (plurality opinion) (\"[A] state or local subdivision, (if delegated the \nauthority from the State) has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legis-\nlative jurisdiction.\") (emphasis added). Hence, a specific state actor can act to prevent the state from being used \nas a \"passive participant\" in private discrimination. This power does not create wide-ranging authority to remedy \nsocietal discrimination, however.  \nIn sum, the law school has failed to show a compelling state interest in remedying the present effects of past dis-\ncrimination sufficient to maintain the use of race in its admissions system. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to ex-\namine the district court's determination that the law school's admissions program was not narrowly tailored to meet the \ncompelling interests that the district court erroneously perceived. 50  \n \n50   The plaintiffs argue that indeed there is no narrow tailoring, for at least the following reasons: (1) In 1992, \nmore than two-thirds of all admission offers to blacks, and a majority of all blacks who matriculated, involved \nout-of-state residents, thus undercutting the law school's stated purpose of remedying past discrimination in \nTexas. (2) The system of preferences has no termination date, thus indicating that there is no connection between \nthe plan and a bona fide remedial purpose. (3) Preference is given even to blacks and Mexican Americans who \ngraduated from private secondary schools and thus did not suffer from state-ordered racial discrimination. \nThe law school apparently chose admission goals of 5% blacks and 10% Mexican Americans because those \nare the respective percentages of college graduates in Texas who are black and Mexican American. Nothing in \n\nPage 22 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nthe record, however, establishes any probative correlation between the degree of past discrimination and the per-\ncentage of students from a minority group who graduate from college. \nThere is no history either of de jure discrimination against Mexican Americans in education at any level in \nTexas or of de facto discrimination against Mexican Americans by the law school. Therefore, it is puzzling that \nthe law school would set an admissions goal for Mexican Americans that is twice that of blacks, as to whom the \nhistory of de jure discrimination in Texas Education in general, and by the law school in particular, is irrefutable. \nIf fashioning a remedy for past discrimination is the goal, one would intuit that the minority group that has \nexperienced the most discrimination would have the lowest college graduation rate and therefore would be enti-\ntled to the most benefit from the designed remedy. The goals established by the law school are precisely the re-\nverse of that intuitive expectation and are more reflective of a goal of diversity (which we hold is not compel-\nling) than of a goal of remedying past discrimination. \n \n [**73]  IV.  \nWhile the district court declared the admissions program unconstitutional, it granted the plaintiffs only limited re-\nlief. They had requested injunctive relief ordering that they be admitted to law school, compensatory and punitive dam-\nages, and prospective injunctive relief preventing the school from using race as a factor in admissions. \nA. \nWe must decide who bears the burden of proof on the damages issue. The district court refused to order the plain-\ntiffs' admission (or award any compensatory damages),  [*956]  as it found that they had not met their burden of persua-\nsion in attempting to show that they would have been admitted absent the unconstitutional system.  861 F. Supp. at 579-\n82. 51 The law school now argues that the plaintiffs had the burden of persuasion on the issue of damages and that the \ndistrict court's findings are not clearly erroneous. 52 The plaintiffs maintain, as they did in the district court, that once \nthey had shown a constitutional violation, the burden of persuasion shifted to the school to show that the denial of ad-\nmission was not caused by that violation.  \n \n51   This finding also affected the court's analysis in denying prospective relief and compensatory damages. \n [**74]  \n52   The district court applied a burden-shifting scheme similar to the methodology used in the title VII context.  \n861 F. Supp. at 579-80 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407, 113 S. Ct. 2742 \n(1993)). The law school concedes that the burden-shifting exercise was unnecessary, but it maintains nonethe-\nless that the \"ultimate burden of proof,\" including proof of damages, rests upon the plaintiffs. See id. \nThe well-established rule is that in order to collect money damages, plaintiffs must prove that they have been in-\njured.  Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254-57, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252, 98 S. Ct. 1042 (1978). Several Supreme Court cases, \nhowever, allow for a transfer of burden upon proof of discrimination. See Mt. Healthy City Sch., Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. \nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 284, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471, 97 S. Ct. 568 (1977); City of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing \nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450, 97 S. Ct. 555 (1977). 53  \n \n53   Some of Justice Powell's dicta in Bakke also squarely supports the plaintiffs' claim that once discrimination \nis proved, the defendant bears the burden of proving no damage.  Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320 (opinion of Powell, J.). \n [**75]  In Mt. Healthy, a discharged school teacher sued for reinstatement, claiming his termination was a result of \ncomments he had made on a radio show, a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The Court devised a \ntest of \"causation\" that placed the burden of proving no harm on the defendant: \n  \n   Initially, . . . the burden was properly placed upon the respondent to show that his conduct was consti-\ntutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \"substantial factor\" -- -- or to put it in other words, that it \nwas a \"motivating factor\" in the Board's decision not to rehire him. Respondent having carried that bur-\nden, however, the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a \npreponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to the respondent's \nreemployment even in the absence of the protected conduct. \n \n  \n\nPage 23 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n 429 U.S. at 287. In Arlington Heights, the Court applied a similar rule where the decision of a zoning board was chal-\nlenged as racially discriminatory. See 429 U.S. at 270 n.21. In sum, these cases allow a defendant, who intended to dis-\ncriminate or otherwise act unconstitutionally, to show [**76]  that its action would have occurred regardless of that in-\ntent.  \nCourts are split on whether the Mt. Healthy rubric applies in racial preference cases. 54 We conclude that the Mt. \nHealthy methodology is appropriate in the instant case. The Mt. Healthy plaintiff, like the present plaintiffs, brought a \nconstitutional challenge, and his injuries were analogous to the injuries alleged here. As we have said, the title VII bur-\nden-shifting scheme is designed to determine whether a violation of law has occurred.  \n \n54   Compare Henson v. University of Ark., 519 F.2d 576, 577-78 (8th Cir. 1975) (per curiam) (placing burden \nof persuasion on white applicant to show affirmative action program prevented her admission) and Martin v. \nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F. Supp. 1318, 1345 (W.D.N.C. 1979) (holding that plaintiff in non-\nclass action bears burden of proving damages) with Donnelly v. Boston College, 558 F.2d 634, 635 (1st Cir. \n1977) (dictum) (citing Bakke and Mt. Healthy, but finding no causation, as evidence showed that plaintiff would \nnot have been admitted regardless of affirmative action) and Heit v. Bugbee, 494 F. Supp. 66, 66-67 (E.D. Mich. \n1980) (adopting Bakke and Mt. Healthy reasoning in toto for firefighter's reverse discrimination claims) and \nUnited States v. McDonald, 553 F. Supp. 1003, 1006 (S.D. Tex. 1983) (dictum) (same for discriminatory crimi-\nnal prosecution). \n [**77]   [*957]  In this case, there is no question that a constitutional violation has occurred (as the district court \nfound) and that the plaintiffs were harmed thereby. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2105 (\"The injury in cases of this kind is \nthat a 'discriminatory classification prevents the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.'\") (citation omitted). The \nMt. Healthy burden-shifting exercise simply gives the defendant law school a second chance of prevailing by showing \nthat the violation was largely harmless. \nAs the district court held, to the contrary, that plaintiffs had the burden, it should revisit this issue in light of what \nwe have said in both the liability and remedial portions of this opinion. 55 In the event that the law school is unable to \nshow (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted to the law school \nunder a constitutional admissions system, the court is to award to that plaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it \ndeems appropriate.  \n \n55   The district court concluded that the plaintiffs proved only that they had been denied equal treatment but \nhad failed to \"prove an injury-in-fact.\" 861 F. Supp. at 582. To the extent that the court felt that plaintiffs failed \nto show injury-in-fact because they failed to prove that they would have been admitted under a constitutional \nadmissions system, this conclusion should be revisited on remand, where the district court must apply the proper \nburden and redetermine whether plaintiffs would have been admitted. \n [**78]  Obviously, if the school proves that a plaintiff would not have gained admittance to the law school under a \nrace-blind system, that plaintiff would not be entitled to an injunction admitting him to the school. On the other hand, \nthe law school's inability to establish a plaintiff's non-admission if that occurs on remand opens a panoply of potential \nrelief, depending in part upon what course that plaintiff's career has taken since trial in mid-1994. It then would be up to \nthe district court, in its able discretion, to decide whether money damages 56 can substitute for an order of immediate \nadmission relief that would ring hollow for a plaintiff for whom an education at the law school now is of little or no \nbenefit. 57  \n \n56   We do not opine on any Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case. See, e.g., United Carolina Bank v. \nBoard of Regents, 665 F.2d 553, 561 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred a civil \nrights suit brought by a professor against university officials in their official capacities). This issue is simply not \nbefore us. \n57   For example, if the school is unable to show that plaintiff Carvell would not have gained admission even \nunder a constitutional admissions system, he may be entitled to be compensated for the difference, to which he \ntestified, between tuition at the law school and tuition at Southern Methodist University School of Law, which \nhe attended instead. The district court should also consider the following paradox: The law school argued \nstrenuously that plaintiff Elliott did not have standing to sue, as he had been offered admission to the school al-\nbeit at the last moment and had failed to accept that offer. The district court found that this offer of admission \nhad not been communicated to Elliott. 861 F. Supp. at 566. In considering damages, however, the court held that \n\nPage 24 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n\"in all likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have been offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible \nprocess.\" Id. at 581. The district court should re-examine these contradictory results.  \n [**79]  Additionally, the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs did not prove that defendants had committed \nintentional discrimination under title VI. \"Intentional discrimination,\" as used in this context, means that a plaintiff must \nprove \"that the governmental actor, in adopting or employing the challenged practices or undertaking the challenged \naction, intended to treat similarly situated persons differently on the basis of race.\" Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, \n1000 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208, 112 \nS. Ct. 1028 (1992); Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582, 77 L. Ed. 2d 866, 103 S. Ct. 3221 (1983). \nWhile we agree with the district court's conclusion that the various defendants acted in good faith, there is no question \nthat they intended to treat the plaintiffs differently on account of their race.  \nB. \nThe plaintiffs argue that, because they proved a constitutional violation, and further violations were likely to result, \nthe district court erred in denying them prospective injunctive relief. We review denials of  [*958]  this sort of relief for \nan abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Peaches Entertainment Corp. v. Entertainment Repertoire, 62 [**80]  F.3d 690, 693 \n(5th Cir. 1995). The law school avers that the district court was well within its equitable discretion in denying relief, \nespecially as the school had abandoned the practices that the district court had found were unconstitutionalto-wit, the \nuse of separate admissions committees for whites and minorities. \nWe review denials of prospective injunctive relief as we would any other denial of permanent injunctive relief un-\nder FED. R. CIV. P. 65, keeping in mind, however, the questions of mootness, ripeness, and standing. See generally \n11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT ET AL., FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE ß 2942 (2d ed. 1995). That treatise \nnotes that \n  \n   perhaps the most significant single component in the judicial decision whether to exercise equity juris-\ndiction and grant permanent injunctive relief is the court's discretion. Of course, in some situations the \nfacts and relevant law may indicate that an injunction clearly should be granted or denied. However, in \nmost cases the determination whether to issue an injunction involves a balancing of interests of the par-\nties who might be affected by the court's decision -- -- the hardship on the plaintiff if relief is denied \n[**81]  as compared to the defendant if relief is granted and the extent to which the latter hardship can be \nmitigated by requiring a security bond. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court's decision depends on the \ncircumstances of each case. \n \n  \nId. at 41-42. Accordingly, the usual practice upon reversal of a denial of injunctive relief is to remand for a reweighing \nof the equities. Id. ß 2962, at 448; See, e.g., James v. Stockham Valves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 354-55 (5th Cir. \n1977). In other situations, the appellate court may order the district court to enter an injunction. See, e.g., Southeastern \nPromotions, Ltd. v. City of Mobile, 457 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. 1972).  \nAccording to the district court, the school had abandoned the admissions procedure consisting of the separate mi-\nnority subcommittee that was used in 1992, 1993, and 1994. The court reasoned that, as a new procedure was developed \nfor 1995, a prospective injunction against the school was inappropriate. We conclude, however, that, while the district \ncourt may have been correct in deciding that the new procedure eliminates the constitutional flaws that the district court \nidentified in the 1992 system,  [**82]  there is no indication that the new system will cure the additional constitutional \ndefects we now have explained.  \nThe new system utilizes a small \"administrative admissions group\" and does not use presumptive admission and \ndenial scores. See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.87. Most significantly, there is no indication that in employing the \nnew plan, the law school will cease to consider race per se in making its admissions decisions. To the contrary, as the \ndistrict court recognized, the law school continues to assert that overt racial preferences are necessary to the attainment \nof its goals. See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 573-75. \nThe district court has already granted some equitable relief: It directed that the plaintiffs be permitted to re-apply to \nthe law school without incurring further administrative costs. In accordance with this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled \nto apply under a system of admissions that will not discriminate against anyone on the basis of race. Moreover, the \nplaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law school will continue to take race into account in admissions unless it \nreceives further judicial instruction to the effect that it may [**83]  not do so for the purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse \n\nPage 25 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nstudent body; (2) altering the school's reputation in the community; (3) combating the school's perceived hostile envi-\nronment toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects of past discrimination by actors other than the law \nschool. \nIt is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are confident that the \nconscientious administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the directives contained in this opinion. If \nan injunction should be needed in the future, the district  [*959]  court, in its discretion, can consider its parameters \nwithout our assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to enter an injunction. \n \nC.  \nThe plaintiffs contend that the district court's application of the wrong standard causes it to deny punitive damages. \nThe plaintiffs aver that the court applied an animus standard, when it should have asked whether the school acted with \n\"reckless indifference\" to their constitutional rights. They ask for a remand on this issue.  \nIt is not apparent, from the record, what standard the district court applied in considering the punitive damages \n[**84]  issue. The court did determine, however, that the law school had always acted in good faith. This is a difficult \narea of the law, in which the law school erred with the best of intentions. As a result, the plaintiffs have not met the fed-\neral standard for punitive damages as stated in Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 75 L. Ed. 2d 632, 103 S. Ct. 1625 \n(1983). Thus, we agree with the district court that punitive damages are not warranted. We note, however, that if the law \nschool continues to operate a disguised or overt racial classification system in the future, its actors could be subject to \nactual and punitive damages.  \n \nV.  \nConsolidated with the appeal of the merits issues of this appeal is No. 94-50569, challenging the district court's de-\nnial of a motion to intervene. The proposed intervenors the Thurgood Marshall Legal Society and the Black Pre-Law \nAssociation (the \"associations\")ask this court, for the second time, for the right to intervene. On their first attempt, the \nassociations moved to intervene prior to trial either as of right or by permission. The district court denied intervention, \nand we affirmed. See Hopwood v. Texas, 21 F.3d 603 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (\"Hopwood I\"). \nNow, following the [**85]  trial, the associations believe they can show that the law school has failed to assert one \nof their proposed defenses, a circumstance they contend establishes their right to intervene. We apply the law of the case \ndoctrine and dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of jurisdiction.  \nA. \nThe proposed intervenors are black student organizations at the University of Texas at Austin and its law school \nthat, just prior to the trial of the merits appeal, sought to intervene, arguing that the law school would not effectively \nprotect their interests in continuing racial preferences at the law school. The district court denied the proposed interven-\ntion on the ground that the law school and the two associations had the same objective: preservation of the status quo. \nOn expedited appeal, this court affirmed on the ground that the associations had failed to show that the law school \nhad an interest different from theirs. We also commented that the two groups had failed to show \"a separate defense of \nthe affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\" Id. at 606. The panel implicitly considered and rejected, as \none potential divergence of interests, the possibility that the law school [**86]  would not raise a defense based upon the \nlegality of the use of TI scores under title VI, as the associations argued that possibility as one basis for intervention. \nAfter their first motion to intervene was denied, the associations remained involved in the case. Throughout the \ncourse of the trial, they acted as amici curiae. And, at the close of trial but before judgment, the district court intimated \nthat it would allow them to submit information for the record. Accordingly, the associations sought to introduce testi-\nmonial and documentary evidence supporting their arguments that (1) the TI by itself was an unlawful basis for admis-\nsions decisions under title VI and (2) that affirmative action at the university was constitutionally required. The plain-\ntiffs opposed the introduction of evidence on these \"new defenses,\" and the district court agreed. The associations were \nallowed to submit amicus briefs and highlight evidence that was already in the record but were not allowed to raise new \nissues or supplement the record. \n [*960]  Shortly thereafter, the associations again sought to intervene under FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(2) (intervention \nas of right), claiming that the law school had failed [**87]  to raise their two \"new defenses\" and, accordingly, that \n\nPage 26 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nevents now showed that that representation inadequately protected their interests. They sought to reopen the record to \nintroduce evidence supporting these arguments.  \nThe district court summarily refused this request. That order is the focus of this separate appeal, in which the asso-\nciations present only the title VI defense and ask to be allowed to present such evidence only if we do not affirm the \njudgment. \nB.  \nThere is no caselaw in this circuit that directly addresses how to review successive motions to intervene. 58 The par-\nties direct us to Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 153 U.S. App. D.C. 407, 473 F.2d 118, 125-26 (D.C. Cir. 1972); \nUnited States Envt'l Protection Agency v. City of Green Forest, 921 F.2d 1394, 1401 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 \nU.S. 956 (1991); and Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471, 1477 (11th Cir. 1993). These courts, which \nwere examining whether the appeal from a successive motion was timely as per the appellate requirements, devised the \ngeneral rule that a second motion would be treated as independent of the first if it was reached under materially changed \ncircumstances. \n \n58   There is circuit law regarding successive motions, but the pertinent opinions do not examine the standard of \nreview explicitly. See, e.g., Kneeland v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.) (implicit \napplication of de novo review without discussion of standard), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 817 (1987); United States \nv. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir. 1982) (application of abuse of discretion review for timeliness deter-\nmination on second motion where proposed intervenor failed to argue for first motion after remand); Calvert \nFire Ins. Co. v. Environs Dev. Corp., 601 F.2d 851, 857 (5th Cir. 1979) (implicit application of de novo review \nwhere district court treated second motion as both a reconsideration of prior motion and a new motion).  \n [**88]  Here, the associations assume that their second intervention motion is separate and distinct from their ear-\nlier failed attempt, because the law school's failure to raise their proposed defense constitutes a changed circumstance. 59 \nThus, they ask that we engage in de novo review of their motion.  \n \n59   The associations ground this argument in language taken from the prior appeal. One necessary element for \nintervention is a showing that the present parties will inadequately represent the proposed intervenors' interests. \nWhile the associations lost on this ground on the last appeal, they now claim that the opinion supports the argu-\nment that the law school's defense is inadequate. In the last appeal, we cited Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, 904 \nF.2d 336 (6th Cir. 1990), as support for the following statement: \"Nor have the proposed intervenors shown that \nthey have a separate defense of the affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\" Hopwood I, 21 \nF.3d at 606. Because the law school, now after trial, still has not asserted the associations' title VI defense, the \nassociations maintain that they now can meet their burden. \nIn Jansen, however, the court found that the proposed intervenors had an interest different from that of the \ndefendant city.  904 F.2d at 343. This was the basis for that court's holding that the city's representation was in-\nadequate. See id. (\"Proffering this alleged violation of the consent decree as an affirmative defense is directly \ncounter to the City's interest.\") (emphasis added). Here, we have already found that the law school's and the as-\nsociations' interests are the same. Jansen therefore does not support intervention. \n [**89]  The plaintiffs, however, note that this motion was entitled a \"renewed motion for intervention.\" The plain-\ntiffs argue that the district court was reconsidering its previous denial order under its FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) powers, and \nwe should review merely for abuse of discretion. \n \nC.  \nWhile the \"changed circumstances\" test may have meritan issue we do not decide today we do not find it applicable \nto this case. Instead, the \"law of the case\" doctrine militates against reconsideration of this motion. Normally, when a \nprior panel discusses an issue on the merits, a later panel cannot reach a contrary conclusion under the preclusive prin-\nciple of law of the case. See Williams v. City of New Orleans, 763 F.2d 667, 669 (5th Cir. 1985). There is no question \nthat the Hopwood I panel addressed the intervention as a matter of right de novo,  [*961]  on the merits, including the \npotential that the law school would not raise every defense proposed by the associations. \n\nPage 27 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nThe question of whether we can rely upon the law of the case doctrine, however, is clouded because of the \"anoma-\nlous\" rule that exists in this circuit concerning the procedural posture of these intervention cases. Under that rule,  \n[**90]  we have only provisional jurisdiction to review a district court's denial of a motion to intervene.  \nIf we agree with the district court, our jurisdiction \"evaporates.\" Hence, the denial of leave to intervene when the \nparty had a right to intervene is immediately appealable. On appeal, however, our rule \"requires a merit review of any \nclaim of intervention in order for [us] to determine whether or not the district court's order is appealable.\" Weiser v. \nWhite, 505 F.2d 912, 916 (5th Cir. 1975). If the claim is without merit, then the order \"is not appealable, the appellate \ncourt has no jurisdiction, and the appeal should be dismissed.\" Id. Thus, despite the merits review, this is a dismissal for \nwant of jurisdiction. 60  \n \n60   At least one set of commentators has eschewed this traditional rule. Their position is that \"any denial of in-\ntervention should be regarded as an appealable final order.\" 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, ß 1923, at 508. Under \nthis proposed rule, the federal court would \"affirm denial of intervention when previously, having determined on \nthe merits that the trial court was right, it would dismiss the appeal.\" Id. at 509. We have acknowledged that this \nwould be the better rule. See Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, 1279 n.26 (5th Cir. 1975) (citing WRIGHT ET \nAL., supra). In fact, the Hopwood I panel affirmed rather than dismissing for want of jurisdiction. Under the \nsuggested rule, because we would have a final order on the merits from a previous panel on this issue, this case \nwould probably be at an end. Nonetheless, as the anomalous rule constitutes our circuit caselaw, we are bound to \nfollow it. \n [**91]  Our anomalous rule complicates the analysis of the preclusive effects of the prior panel decision, because \ndismissals for lack of jurisdiction normally do not have preclusive effect. See, e.g., FED. R. CIV. P. 41(b). Accordingly, \nwhile appellate courts review denials of intervention motions on the merits, it is uncertain to what extent such a review \nhas preclusive effect. Nonetheless, we recognize the possibility of issue preclusion on the question of jurisdiction itself.  \nWhile a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not operate as an adjudication on the merits, \"this provision means \nonly that the dismissal permits a second action on the same claim that corrects the deficiency found in the first action. \nThe judgment remains effective to preclude relitigation of the precise issue of jurisdiction or venue that led to the initial \ndismissal.\" 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, ß 4436, at 338. 61 Thus, a party is precluded from successively appealing the \nsame intervention motion.  \n \n61   A dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, leaves open the possibility that the deficiency can be cured. If \nthat occurs, no issue preclusion exists. See 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, ß 4436, at 338. It is at this point in the \nanalysis that \"changed circumstances\" may become relevant. Arguably, the \"changed circumstances\" analysis, in \neffect, \"cures\" the earlier jurisdictional deficiency. Thus, if the circumstances of the case change to such an ex-\ntent that jurisdiction would lie, the subsequent motion to intervene should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdic-\ntion. In effect, the posture of the case has changed, as it would any time a given jurisdictional problem is cured.  \n [**92]  Here, the record shows that the associations raised this same title VI argument before the Hopwood I panel \nin both their brief and at oral argument. That panel, reviewing de novo the merits of the associations' claims, denied \nintervention. Accordingly, the last panel implicitly addressed this issue, and we must respect its decision to deny inter-\nvention. The law of the case doctrine prevents merits review, and we dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of jurisdiction. 62  \n \n62   In Hopwood I, we decided that (1) the interests of the associations were adequately represented by the law \nschool and the state, and (2) as a practical matter, disposition in the principal suit would not impair or impede ei-\nther of those groups' interests.  21 F.3d at 605. The law of the case doctrine militates against revisiting that deci-\nsion here. \nFor purposes of any future litigation, however, we note a necessary effect of our previous holding when \ncoupled with the law school's failure to raise a title VI argument: Neither the district court's decision nor ours in \nthis appeal is binding on the associations as res judicata, law of the case, collateral estoppel, or any other theo-\nretical bar. \nIn short, as the title VI issue has not been litigated, the associations are not precluded from instituting a \nseparate and independent title VI challenge to the law school's use of the TI. We neither express nor imply an \nopinion on the viability of such a challenge. \n [**93]   [*962]  VI. \n\nPage 28 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nIn summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which \napplicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived effects of a hostile environment \nat the law school, to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present \neffects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school. Because the law school has proffered these justifica-\ntions for its use of race in admissions, the plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that they were scrutinized \nunder an unconstitutional admissions system. The plaintiffs are entitled to reapply under an admissions system that in-\nvokes none of these serious constitutional infirmities. We also direct the district court to reconsider the question of dam-\nages, and we conclude that the proposed intervenors properly were denied intervention. \nIn No. 94-50569, the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. In No. 94-50664, the judgment is REVERSED \nand REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.  \n \nCONCUR BY: WIENER \n \nCONCUR \nWIENER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring.  \n\"We judge best when we [**94]  judge least, particularly in controversial matters of high public interest.\" 63 In this \nand every other appeal, we should decide only the case before us, and should do so on the narrowest possible basis. \nMindful of this credo, I concur in part and, with respect, specially concur in part.  \n \n63   League of United Latin American Citizens, Council No. 4434 v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 931 (5th Cir. \n1993)(Wiener, J., dissenting). \nThe sole substantive issue in this appeal is whether the admissions process employed by the law school for 1992 \nmeets muster under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The law school offers alternative justi-\nfications for its race-based admissions process, each of which, it insists, is a compelling interest: (1) remedying the pre-\nsent effects of past discrimination (present effects) and (2) providing the educational benefits that can be obtained only \nwhen the student body is diverse (diversity). 64 As to present effects, I concur in the panel opinion's analysis: Irrespec-\ntive [**95]  of whether the law school or the University of Texas system as a whole is deemed the relevant governmen-\ntal unit to be tested, 65 neither has established the existence of present effects of past discrimination sufficient to justify \nthe use of a racial classification. 66 As to diversity, however, I respectfully disagree with the panel opinion's conclusion \nthat diversity can never be a compelling governmental interest in a public graduate school. Rather than attempt to decide \nthat issue, I would take a considerably narrower path -- and, I believe, a more appropriate one -- to reach an equally \nnarrow result: I would assume arguendo that diversity can be a compelling interest but conclude that the admissions \nprocess here under scrutiny was not narrowly tailored to achieve diversity. \n \n64   See Hopwood v. State of Tex., 861 F. Supp. 551, 570 (W.D. Tex. 1994). \n65   I agree with the panel opinion that the defendants are overreaching when they urge that the State of Texas or \nits primary and secondary school system should be the relevant governmental unit.  \n66   Panel Opn. at 43 & n.44. \n [**96]  I \nTHE LAW \n \nA. EQUAL PROTECTION  \nThe Equal Protection Clause provides that \"no State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.\" 67 Accordingly, \"all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local govern-\nmental actor, must be analyzed  [*963]  by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\" 68 Racial classifications will survive \nstrict scrutiny \"only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\" 69 Thus, \nstrict scrutiny comprises two inquiries of equal valence: the \"compelling interest\" inquiry and the \"narrow tailoring\" \ninquiry. 70 Moreover, these inquiries are conjunctive: To avoid constitutional nullity, a racial classification must satisfy \nboth inquiries. Failure to satisfy either is fatal.  \n \n67   U.S. Const., amend. 14, ß 1. \n68   Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158, 115 S.

Ed. 2d 762, 115 S. \nCt. 2475, 2490 (1995)(\"To satisfy strict scrutiny, the State must demonstrate that its districting legislation is nar-\nrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\"). \n \n [**97]  B. RACIAL CLASSIFICATION  \nNone dispute that the law school's admission process for 1992 employed a racial classification. Depending on an \napplicant's race, his request for admission was considered under one of three different (and, as explained in the panel \nopinion, often dispositive 71 ) TI admission ranges: one for blacks only, a second for Mexican Americans only, and a \nthird for all other races and nationalities, including non-Mexican Hispanic Americans. In short, each applicant for ad-\nmission to the law school was classified by race, and his application was treated differently according into which of \nthose three racial classifications it fell. Thus, the law school's 1992 admissions process, like all racial classifications by \nthe government, is subject to strict scrutiny. 72  \n \n71   See Panel . Opn. at 6-7 (explaining that a Mexican American or a black applicant with a TI of 189 is pre-\nsumptively admitted, while an \"other race\" applicant with an identical TI is presumptively denied).  \n72   Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2115.  \n \n [**98]  C. STRICT SCRUTINY  \nThe law school contends that it employs a racially stratified admissions process to obtain, inter alia, the educational \nbenefits of a diverse student body. Translated into the constitutional idiom, the law school insists that achieving student \nbody diversity in a public graduate school is a compelling governmental interest. The law school invokes the opinion of \nJustice Powell in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke 73 to support that postulate. The panel opinion rejects \nthat support, concluding that from its inception Bakke had little precedential value and now, post-Adarand, has none. \nMy fellow panelists thus declare categorically that \"any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the pur-\nposes of achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 74  \n \n73   438 U.S. 265 (1978). Justice Powell opens his discussion of equal protection and diversity in Bakke by stat-\ning that the \"attainment of a diverse student body . . . clearly [is] a constitutionally permissible goal for an insti-\ntution of higher education,\" id. at 311-12, and, in the unique context of institutions of higher learning, he con-\ncludes that diversity is a compelling interest. Id. at 312. \n [**99]  \n74   Panel Opn. at 25 (emphasis added). \nThis conclusion may well be a defensible extension of recent Supreme Court precedent, an extension which in time \nmay prove to be the Court's position. It admittedly has a simplifying appeal as an easily applied, bright-line rule pro-\nscribing any use of race as a determinant. Be that as it may, this position remains an extension of the law--one that, in \nmy opinion, is both overly broad and unnecessary to the disposition of this case. I am therefore unable to concur in the \nmajority's analysis. \nMy decision not to embrace the ratio decidendi of the majority opinion results from three premises: First, if Bakke \nis to be declared dead, the Supreme Court, not a three-judge panel of a circuit court, should make that pronouncement. \nSecond, Justice O'Connor expressly states that Adarand is not the death knell of affirmative action -- to  [*964]  which I \nwould add, especially not in the framework of achieving diversity in public graduate schools. 75 Third, we have no need \nto decide the thornier issue of compelling interest, as the narrowly tailored inquiry of [**100]  strict scrutiny presents a \nmore surgical and -- it seems to me -- more principled way to decide the case before us. 76 I am nevertheless reluctant to \nproceed with a narrowly tailored inquiry without pausing to respond briefly to the panel opinion's treatment of diversity \nin the context of the compelling interest inquiry \n \n75   Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2117 (\"When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such ac-\ntion is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previ-\nous cases.\").  \n76   See, e.g, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 224, 114 L. Ed. 2d 233, 111 S. Ct. 1759 (1991)(O'Connor, J, dis-\nsenting)(\"It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in \n\nPage 30 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nadvance of the necessity of deciding them.\")(citing Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold \nEngineering, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 157, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113, 104 S. Ct. 2267 (1984)). \n \nD. IS DIVERSITY A COMPELLING INTEREST?  \nAlong its path to a per se ban [**101]  on any consideration of race in attempting to achieve student body diversity, \nthe panel opinion holds (or strongly implies) that remedying vestigial effects of past discrimination is the only compel-\nling interest that can ever justify racial classification. 77 The main reason that I cannot go along with the panel opinion to \nthat extent is that I do not read the applicable Supreme Court precedent as having held squarely and unequivocally ei-\nther that remedying effects of past discrimination is the only compelling state interest that can ever justify racial classi-\nfication, or conversely that achieving diversity in the student body of a public graduate or professional school can never \nbe a compelling governmental interest. Indeed, the panel opinion itself hedges a bit on whether the Supreme Court's \nsquare holdings have gone that far, 78 particularly in the realm of higher education. 79  \n \n77   Panel Opn. at 26-29.  \n78   The Court appears to have decided that \"there is essentially only one compelling state interest to justify ra-\ncial classification: remedying past wrongs.\" Panel opn. at 27 (citing City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 \nU.S. 469, 493, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854, 109 S. Ct. 706 (1989)(plurality opinion)(emphasis added)).  \n [**102]  \n79   Panel Opn. at 28 n.27, (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. \nCt. 1842 (1986) (O'Connor, J. concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). (\"Although its precise con-\ntours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently 'compel-\nling' at least in the context of higher education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that inter-\nest.\").  \nBetween the difficulty inherent in applying Bakke 80 and the minimal guidance in  [*965]  Adarand, 81 the definition \nand application of the compelling interest inquiry seems to be suspended somewhere in the interstices of constitutional \ninterpretation. Until further clarification issues from the Supreme Court defining \"compelling interest\" (or telling us \nhow to know one when we see one), I perceive no \"compelling\" reason to rush in where the Supreme Court fears -- or at \nleast declines -- to tread. Instead, I would pretermit any attempt at a compelling interest inquiry and accept Justice \nO'Connor's invitation to apply the Court's more discernible and less intrusive \"narrow [**103]  tailoring\" precedent. 82 \nThus, for the purpose of this appeal I assume, without deciding, that diversity is a compelling interest, 83 and proceed to \nthe narrowly tailored inquiry. \n \n80   I readily concede that problems are encountered when efforts are made to apply the Supreme Court's Bakke \ndecision. Panel Opn. at 20, 25, & 26 (respectively pointing out that (1) Bakke comprises multiple opinions and \ndivergent analyses, (2) no Justice, other than Justice Powell, discusses diversity, and (3) Bakke is questioned in \nAdarand). The panel opinion fails to describe this last problem with precise accuracy. That opinion's expurgated \nversion of the quotation at 26, lines 736-42 makes it appear as though the Adarand majority questioned Bakke. \nIn full, the sentence reads \"[the Court's] failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant \nleft unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.\" Thus, although the Court ac-\nknowledges that Bakke et al. left things unresolved, I do not read this quotation, (as the panel opinion suggests) \nas an order to throw out Bakke--bath water, baby, and all. \nNevertheless, the fractured nature of Bakke's holding has left more questions than answers in its wake. As \nobserved in the instant panel opinion, there has been \"no [other] indication from the Supreme Court, . . . \n[whether] the state's interest in diversity [in higher education] constitutes a compelling justification for govern-\nmental race-based classifications.\" Panel Opn. at 28. I agree that Bakke is the only indication that diversity is a \ncompelling interest. But, unlike the panel opinion, which jettisons Justice Powell's Bakke opinion because of its \nsingularity, I find that singularity to be precisely the factor that makes Justice Powell's opinion the most perti-\nnent Supreme Court statement on this issue. Therefore, when and if the Supreme Court addresses this case or its \nanalog, the Court will have no choice but to go with, over, around, or through Justice Powell's Bakke opinion. \nBy assuming, as I do, that diversity is a compelling interest, however, these problems are avoided altogether.  \n [**104]  \n81   Recently, in Adarand the Supreme Court stated that it had \"altered the [equal protection] playing field in \nsome important respects.\" 115 S. Ct. at 2118. In her opinion for the majority, however, Justice O'Connor repeat-\nedly emphasizes that Adarand did not drive a stake through the heart of affirmative action. To the contrary, she \n\nPage 31 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nemphatically states, \"we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\" Id. at \n2117 (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. 448, 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). Moreover, \"when race-based \naction is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within the constitutional constraints if it satis-\nfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.\" Id. \nIt seems to me that as a practical matter, Adarand resolves very little. In fact, the much heralded change is \nquite limited: Race-based classifications, imposed by the federal government, are now subject to strict scrutiny. \nCuriously (or perhaps not so curiously given the enigmatic difficulty of the task), the Supreme Court declined to \ndefine compelling interest or to tell us how to apply that term. Indeed, the Court did not even decide the case be-\nfore it, opting instead to remand the case for further adjudication.  \n [**105]  \n82   Id. (\"When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within the constitu-\ntional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.\"). \n83   Although I assume without deciding that diversity is a compelling interest, if I had no choice but to address \ncompelling interest I would do so in the context in which the issue is presented, i.e., the constitutionally permis-\nsible means of constructing an entering a class at a public graduate or professional school. This unique context, \nfirst identified by Justice Powell, differs from the employment context, differs from the minority business set \naside context, and differs from the re-districting context; it comprises only the public higher education context \nand implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12. \nConsequently, we play with fire when we assume an easy crossover of Fourteenth Amendment maxims pro-\nnounced in cases decided in such other contexts.  \nThe panel opinion concludes that this contextual distinction is unimportant, holding that, whatever the con-\ntext, remedying the past effects of discrimination is the only compelling interest that can justify a racial classifi-\ncation. Panel Opn. at 26-29. That opinion acknowledges, however, that Supreme Court precedent does not go \nthis far: namely, the higher education context is different. Indeed the panel opinion quotes Justice O'Connor's \nwords expressly stating that higher education is different. Panel Opn. at 28 n.27 (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. \nof Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986) (\"Although its precise contours are uncer-\ntain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently 'compelling' at least in \nthe context of higher education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.\")).  \n \n [**106]  F. TEST FOR NARROW TAILORING  \nWhen strictly scrutinizing a racial classification for narrow tailoring, the first question is \"What is the purpose of \nthis racial classification?\" 84 The present effects rationale having proven feckless in this case, today's answer to that first \nquestion is a given: The law school's purpose is diversity. Accordingly, I perceive the next question to be, \"Was the law \nschool's 1992 admissions process, with one TI range for blacks, another for Mexican Americans, and a third for other \nraces, narrowly tailored to achieve diversity?\" I conclude that it was not. Focusing as it does on blacks and Mexican \nAmericans only, the law school's 1992 admissions process misconceived the concept of diversity, as did California's in \nthe view of Justice Powell: Diversity which furthers a compelling state interest \"encompasses a far broader array of \nqualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\" 85  \n \n84   United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 94 L. Ed. 2d 203, 107 S. Ct. 1053 (1987). \n85   Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316. In the portion of his opinion that addresses narrow tailoring, Justice Powell con-\ncluded that California's admission process misconceived the concept of \"diversity.\" Id. California's preferential \nprogram, focused as it was solely on aiding black applicants, was not necessary to attain diversity. Id.  \n [**107]   [*966]  When the selective race-based preferences of the law school's 1992 admissions process are \nevaluated under Justice Powell's broad, multi-faceted concept of diversity, that process fails to satisfy the requirements \nof the Constitution. 86 The law school purported to accomplish diversity by ensuring an increase in the numbers of only \nblacks and Mexican Americans in each incoming class to produce percentages -- virtually indistinguishable from quo-\ntas--of approximately five and ten percent, respectively. Yet blacks and Mexican Americans are but two among any \nnumber of racial or ethnic groups that could and presumably should contribute to genuine diversity. By singling out \nonly those two ethnic groups, the initial stage of the law school's 1992 admissions process ignored altogether non-\nMexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, to name but a few.  \n \n\nPage 32 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n86   In the instant litigation, the law school created its own Catch-22 by advancing two putative compelling in-\nterests that ultimately proved to produce so much internal tension as to damage if not fatally wound each other. \nUnder the banner of prior discrimination, Texas had no choice but to single out blacks and Mexican-Americans, \nfor those two racial groups were the only ones of which there is any evidence whatsoever of de facto or de jure \nracial discrimination by the State of Texas in the history of its educational system. But, by favoring just those \ntwo groups and doing so with a virtual quota system for affirmative action in admissions, the law school estops \nitself from proving that its plan to achieve diversity is ingenuous, much less narrowly tailored.  \n [**108]  In this light, the limited racial effects of the law school's preferential admissions process, targeting exclu-\nsively blacks and Mexican Americans, more closely resembles a set aside or quota system for those two disadvantaged \nminorities than it does an academic admissions program narrowly tailored to achieve true diversity. I concede that the \nlaw school's 1992 admissions process would increase the percentages of black faces and brown faces in that year's en-\ntering class. But facial diversity is not true diversity, and a system thus conceived and implemented simply is not nar-\nrowly tailored to achieve diversity.  \nAccordingly, I would find that the law school's race-based 1992 admissions process was not narrowly tailored to \nachieve diversity and hold it constitutionally invalid on that basis. By so doing I would avoid the largely uncharted wa-\nters of a compelling interest analysis. Although I join my colleagues of the panel in their holding that the law school's \n1992 admissions process fails to pass strict scrutiny, 87 on the question of diversity I follow the solitary path of narrow \ntailoring rather than the primrose path of compelling interest to reach our common holding. \n \n87   I also concur in my colleagues' conclusion that intervention by the two black student organizations is not \nmandated, and do so for the same reasons. \n [**109]  II \nREMEDY \nBefore concluding, I am compelled to add a few words about the panel opinion's \"commentary\" regarding the rem-\nedy to be imposed by the district court on remand. Without employing the express language of injunction or affixing \nthat label to its holding, the panel opinion's discussion of the remedy on remand is \"strongly suggestive\" and has all of \nthe substantive earmarks of an injunction:  \n  \n   [The] plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law school will continue to take race into account in \nadmissions unless it receives further judicial instruction to the effect that it may not do so for the purpose \nof (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the school's reputation in the community; (3) combat-\ning the school's perceived hostile environment toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects of \npast discrimination by actors other than the law school. \n \n  \n   It is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are con-\nfident that the conscientious  [*967]  administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the \ndirectives contained in this opinion. If an injunction should be needed in the future,  [**110]  the district \ncourt, in its discretion, can consider its parameters without our assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact \nthat court's refusal to enter an injunction. 88  \n \n88   Panel Opn. at 59-60. \n  \nEssentially, the substance of the quoted portion of the panel opinion constitutes a de facto injunction -- telling the dis-\ntrict court precisely what to tell the law school that it can and can't do -- albeit without the use of the word injunction. \nTo me, if \"it\" has feathers, swims, waddles, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck; and I find such an \"un-injunction\" inap-\npropriate. If instead we were simply to reverse and remand on the violation issue, we would stop short of finding de \nnovo that the law school had violated these four plaintiffs' equal protection rights. It seems unavoidable to me that until \nthe district court determines that there has been a violation, a remedy cannot be fashioned and should not be the subject \nof appellate speculation. 89  \n \n\nPage 33 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n89   Hay v. Waldron, 834 F.2d 481, 484 (5th Cir. 1987)(The law is well-settled that the grant or denial of injunc-\ntive relief rests in the sound discretion of the district court); Lubbock Civ. Lib. Union v. Lubbock Ind. Sch. Dist., \n669 F.2d 1038, 1048 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1155, 74 L. Ed. 2d 1003, 103 S. Ct. 800 (1983). \n [**111]  The district court denied the plaintiffs injunctive relief, but only after assigning the burden of proof to the \nwrong party. 90 No member of this panel questions that, in the initial stanza of the burden-shifting minuet of Mt. Healthy \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 91 the plaintiffs met their burden. Once the plaintiffs did that, the burden should have \nshifted to the law school. Instead, the district court left it with the plaintiffs and concluded that they had failed to carry \nthe ultimate burden. The district court's failure to shift the burden to the law school, and the conclusion of that court \nwhich followed, were errors. Accordingly, like my colleagues of the panel, I would remand the case to the district court \nwith instructions to relieve the plaintiffs of the misplaced burden while affording the law school the opportunity to \nprove that the prima facie violation established by the plaintiffs was essentially harmless. But it seems clear to me that \nthis is where our analysis should end. As a result, I depart from the \"commentary\" in the panel opinion regarding the \nprecise elements of the remedy to be fashioned by the district court if it should conclude on remand that [**112]  the \nlaw school shall have failed to bear its burden. \n \n90   Panel Opn. at 55 (\"We conclude that the Mt. Healthy methodology is appropriate in the instant case.\"). On \nthis point, I agree with the panel majority that the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting minuet should apply.  \n91   429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977). \nIII \nCONCLUSION \nI end where I began: We should only decide the issues necessarily before this court, and then only on the narrowest \nbases upon which our decision can rest. This is not a class action; nothing is before us here save the claims of four indi-\nvidual plaintiffs. These four individual plaintiffs properly challenge only the admissions process employed by the law \nschool in 1992 -- not the admissions process that was in place and employed in 1995, not the admissions process that is \nbeing employed in 1996, and not the admissions process to be applied in any future years. In sum, I would remand, and \nin the process I would take care not to eviscerate the discretion of the district court with excessive [**113]  \"commen-\ntary\" or implicit directions on the precise nature of the remedy that must ensue. Rather, my remand would simply in-\nstruct the district court to apply the correct burden-shifting process articulated in Mt. Healthy, then see how the law \nschool deals with it. That way, if the Mt. Healthy application should demonstrate the need for a remedy, the district \ncourt would be free to fashion the appropriate relief -- including injunctive if necessary -- for those among the individ-\nual plaintiffs whose individual cases warrant it. For this court to do anything beyond that impresses me as overreaching.  \n[*968]  Thus I concur in the judgment of the panel opinion but, as to its conclusion on the issue of strict scrutiny and its \ngloss on the order of remand, I disagree for the reasons I have stated and therefore concur specially.   \n \nDISSENT BY: POLITZ; STEWART \n \nDISSENT \nPOLITZ, Chief Judge, and KING, WIENER, BENAVIDES, STEWART, PARKER, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges, \ndissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc \n  \n   Soon after the founding of the Republic, the Supreme Court indicated that the power of judicial review \nshould be exercised reluctantly, only because it is essential [**114]  to the decision of the case before a \nfederal court and because the Constitution and the laws of the United States, as the \"Supreme law of the \nLand,\" require it. 1 \n \n  \n \n \n1   Baker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289, 298 (5th Cir. 1985) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 \nU.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat) 304, 4 L. Ed. 97 (1816)). \nThis case was brought by four individual plaintiffs (not a class of plaintiffs) who were denied admission to the Uni-\nversity of Texas Law School (Law School) in 1992, claiming that the Law School's admission process in 1992 violated \n\nPage 34 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nthe Fourteenth Amendment by giving race-based preferences exclusively to blacks and Mexican Americans. 2 In resolv-\ning the case presented by these four plaintiffs, the panel opinion directed the Law School not to use race as a factor in \nthe admissions process at all. 3 In so doing, the opinion goes out of its way to break ground that the Supreme Court itself \nhas been careful to avoid [**115]  and purports to overrule a Supreme Court decision, namely, Regents of the Univer-\nsity of California v. Bakke. 4 The radical implications of this opinion, with its sweeping dicta, will literally change the \nface of public educational institutions throughout Texas, the other states of this circuit, and this nation. A case of such \nmonumental import demands the attention of more than a divided panel. It should have the attention of every active \njudge on this court. We respectfully but emphatically dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc. \n \n2   The Law School no longer employs the system that was in place for 1992. \n3   Judge Smith wrote the opinion for the panel, and Judge DeMoss joined that opinion in full. Judge Wiener, \nwho wrote separately, did not join the panel opinion in this conclusion. \n4   438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978). \nFor reasons that have not been communicated to this court, and upon which we can only speculate, neither the \nplaintiffs nor the defendants have sought [**116]  rehearing en banc. It would appear that in this case, some of our col-\nleagues may have embraced the rationale that, when sophisticated litigants represented by capable lawyers elect not to \nseek rehearing en banc, it is not our place to take any action. Our customary practice, however, does not support this \nposition. Indeed, not infrequently we propose rehearing en banc on our own motion, before the parties have requested \nthat we do so. We reject out of hand the notion that we are merely obsequious ciphers, subject to the tactical decisions \nand strategic maneuvers of the litigants before us. When the occasional case of such far reaching importance to this \ncourt, to public higher education, and to this nation comes down the pike, we have a duty to address it and to do the best \npossible job that our whole court is capable of, regardless of the tactical decisions of the litigants. To decline to rehear a \ncase of this magnitude because the parties have not suggested that we do so bespeaks an abdication of duty--the ducking \nof a tough question by judges who we know first-hand are made of sterner stuff. \nThe label \"judicial activism\" is usually found in the lexicon of those voicing concern [**117]  about judges whom \nthey perceive to be \"liberal,\" fashioning remedies beyond the scope of what is deemed to be appropriate under the law. \nSuch judicial legislating is generally excoriated as a \"bad thing.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas 5 is a text book example of \njudicial activism. Here, two members of the three-judge panel determined to bar any consideration of race in the Law \nSchool's admission process. This \"injunction\" is wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the matter appealed and thus is \nclearly dictum; yet dictum that is a frontal assault on contrary Supreme Court precedent and thus not the kind of dictum \nwe can ignore. By tenuously stringing together pieces and shards of recent Supreme Court opinions that have dealt with \nrace in such diverse settings as minority set asides for government contractors, broadcast licenses, redistricting, and the \nlike, the panel creates a gossamer chain which it proffers as a justification for overruling Bakke. We are persuaded that \nthis alone makes the instant case not just en banc-worthy but en banc mandatory. \n \n5       F.3d     (1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, 1996 WL 120235) (5th Cir. 1996). \n [**118]  The Supreme Court has left no doubt that as a constitutionally inferior court, we are compelled to follow \nfaithfully a directly controlling Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to over-\nrule it. 6 We may not reject, dismiss, disregard, or deny Supreme Court precedent, even if, in a particular case, it seems \npellucidly clear to litigants, lawyers, and lower court judges alike that, given the opportunity, the Supreme Court would \noverrule its precedent. \n \n6   See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d \n526 (1989). \nMembers of this court have frequently \"preached\" against such judicial activism. In Williams v. Whitley, 7 Judge \nHigginbotham explained the limits placed on appellate courts regarding Supreme Court precedent: \n  \n   Absent clear indications from the Supreme Court itself, lower courts should not lightly assume that a \nprior decision has been overruled sub silentio merely because its reasoning and [**119]  result appear in-\nconsistent with later cases. As [the district court] pointed out . . . the Court issued a reminder to this ef-\nfect only a few years ago in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 \nS. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989): \"If a precedent of [the Supreme] Court has direct application in a \ncase, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should \n\nPage 35 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its \nown decisions.\" Id. at 484-85, 109 S. Ct. at 1921-22; see also id. at 486, 109 S. Ct. at 1923 (Brennan, J., \ndissenting) (describing anticipatory overruling as \"an indefensible brand of judicial activism\") . . . In \nthese circumstances, our role as an inferior court counsels restraint, even if the result otherwise appears \ninescapable. \n \n  \nIn like manner, our colleagues have routinely counseled that judicial restraint is the order of the day, especially in the \nconstitutional context. For example, in Walton v. Alexander, 8 Judge Garwood insisted that courts have a duty not to \naddress constitutional issues not necessary to [**120]  the disposition of an individual case. \n   It is settled that courts have a \"strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in \norder to determine the rights of the parties to the case under consideration.\" County Court of Ulster \nCounty v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 154, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979). This \"responsibility to \navoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication\" is \"a fundamental rule of judicial restraint.\" Three Affili-\nated Tribes v. Wold Engineering, 467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S. Ct. 2267, 2279, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1984). All \nthis, of course, applies not only to the Supreme Court but to lower courts as well. See Bowen v. United \nStates, 422 U.S. 916, 920, 95 S. Ct. 2569, 2573, 45 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1975). \n \n  \nVariations of this theme can be found in the opinions of many of the judges of this court. 9 \n \n7   994 F.2d 226, 235 (5th Cir. 1993). \n8   20 F.3d 1350, 1356 (5th Cir. 1994). We cannot but note that a majority of our active judges voted Walton en \nbanc to correct the majority's erroneous interpretation of Supreme Court precedent regarding an issue that was \nnot necessary for the resolution of the case. \n [**121]  \n9   See also United States v. Mendiola, 42 F.3d 259, 260 n.1 (5th Cir. 1994) (Barksdale, J.) (\"It goes without \nsaying that we have a strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in order to determine \nthe rights of the parties to the case under consideration.\"); Manning v. Upjohn Co., 862 F.2d 545, 547 (5th Cir. \n1989) (Smith, J.) (\"Principles of judicial restraint dictate that if resolution of an issue effectively dispose of a \ncase, we should resolve the case on that basis without reaching any other issues that might be presented.\"); \nApache Bend Apartments, Ltd. v. United States, 987 F.2d 1174, 1175 (5th Cir. 1993) (Jolly, J.) (\"The judicial \npower to adjudicate constitutional questions is reserved for those instances in which it is necessary for the vindi-\ncation of individual rights.\") (emphasis added); Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., 15 F.3d 443 (5th Cir. 1994) \n(Jones, J., dissenting, joined by Garwood, Smith, Barksdale, and DeMoss, JJ.) (\"'The doctrine of judicial self-\nrestraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in [the constitu-\ntional] field.'\") (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 1068, 117 L. Ed. \n2d 261 (1992)). \n [**122]  Thus, it seems that this court has trouble practicing what it preaches, at least in this instance. For here, \nJustice Powell's opinion in Bakke made the Supreme Court's disposition precedential. 10 We unequivocally reject the \nproposition that it does not mandate our disposition. The syllogisms tacked together and proffered by the majority opin-\nion as proof that Justice Powell's diversity conclusion is no longer good law do not, under any standards of which we \nare aware, qualify as an overruling of Bakke. 11 To the contrary, direct reference to Justice Powell's diversity analysis \ndocuments, supports, and reinforces its continuing validity. 12 Consequently, even if the members of the panel majority \nwere convinced that the Supreme Court is certain to overrule Bakke, in the absence of an express overruling, they had \nno option but to grin, follow Bakke, bear it, and patiently await the Supreme Court's reconsideration. Rather than fol-\nlowing this universally recognized canon, adhering to our established rules, and applying Supreme Court precedent, the \npanel charted a path into terra incognita. Judicial self-restraint was the first casualty; it proved to be too burdensome. \nThe [**123]  teachings proscribing the consideration of constitutional issues unnecessary to the decision soon followed. \nWith these two limitations adroitly set aside, the panel majority apparently considered itself positioned to overrule \nBakke. \n \n10   In a part V.C. of his opinion, Justice Powell writes, \n  \n\nPage 36 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \n   In enjoining [the University of California at Davis] from ever considering the race of any appli-\ncant, however, the courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that le-\ngitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive \nconsideration of race and ethnic origin. \n \n  \n Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318. Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun joined Justice Powell in this holding.  \nId. at 271 n. *. \n11   Lest there be any doubt, we are firmly convinced that, until the Supreme Court expressly overrules Bakke, \nstudent body diversity is a compelling governmental interest for the purposes of strict scrutiny. \n12   See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. Of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986) (O'Con-\nnor, J., concurring) (recognizing racial diversity as sufficiently compelling in the context of higher education). \n [**124]  Giving the panel majority the benefit of the doubt, as we are wont to do and should do, and assuming ar-\nguendo that Bakke's diversity issue had to be addressed in this particular case, would it not have been the more judi-\ncious course to have brought our full en banc powers to bear on this difficult, vitally important question? It can hardly \nbe gainsaid that reasonable jurists can and likely will differ on an issue of such magnitude, depth, and importance. In-\ndeed, this very truism compels giving to the entire court the opportunity to devote to this crucial case its focused consid-\neration. Conceivably, after an en banc rehearing the panel result, its reasoning, and even its dicta, might be embraced by \na majority of the en banc court. But that is not the point; even if that unprecedented and, we suggest, impertinent step--a \nfederal circuit court, sitting en banc, purporting to overrule a Supreme Court precedent--were to be taken, it would not \nbe taken until sixteen of the seventeen active judges of this court 13 had an opportunity to consider and participate in the \ndeliberations on this matter fully. \n \n13   Judge Emilio M. Garza, our seventeenth active judge, recused himself from the outset. \n [**125]  There are many things which a \"yea\" vote on an en banc poll is not: It is not necessarily a vote against the \nanalysis; it is not necessarily a vote against the result; it is not necessarily a vote against a panel opinion or in favor of a \nspecial concurrence or a dissent. It is rather an affirmative statement that, for one or more reasons, a case or an issue is \nworthy of the time, attention, and efforts of the entire court. Hopwood is such a case. Unfortunately, a bare majority of \nour colleagues have joined hands to deny this storied court the opportunity to consider this case en banc. \nThe majority of the panel overruled Bakke, wrote far too broadly, and spoke a plethora of unfortunate dicta. That \nwas not their prerogative, yet this court declined to reconsider Hopwood en banc. From that decision we must, perforce, \ndissent. \nStewart, Circuit Judge, dissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc. \nI wholeheartedly concur in the dissent to the denial of en banc rehearing. I write separately to underscore the lack \nof historical perspective and sensitivity in both the panel majority's opinion and the vote not to consider this case en \nbanc. \nThat it is the University [**126]  of Texas School of Law's admissions policy at issue is a fact whose significance \nhas not been lost on any of us. In 1946, this very school denied admission to Heman Marion Sweart because he was \nblack, prompting him to sue the University. Sweaff's real difficulties began fifty years before when the United States \nSupreme Court scripted one of this nation's most evil conceits in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 41 L. Ed. 256, 16 S. \nCt. 1138 (1896), declaring \"separate but equal\" treatment of black Americans constitutional. Plessy was no more than a \nlicense for continued racial discrimination. However, in 1950 the Supreme Court held that excluding Sweatt on account \nof his race violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 94 L. \nEd. 1114, 70 S. Ct. 848 (1950). 1 \n \n1   When a court ordered the State to provide a law school for blacks, Texas created a \"makeshift law school that \nhad no permanent staff, no library staff, no facilities, and was not accredited.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F. \nSupp. 551, 555 (1994). This \"law school\" consisted of 3 rooms in a basement and had two professors. Paul But-\nler, Affirmative Action Admissions, Dallas Morning News, April 7, 1996, at 1J. \n [**127]  History, in its characteristic irony, takes this court to that hallowed ground of civil rights jurisprudence to \nassess the University's effort to encourage minority enrollment and counter its legacy of segregation. It is an unfortu-\nnate, further irony that the panel majority opinion should so overreach in its decision. In Sweatt's case, the Supreme \n\nPage 37 \n78 F.3d 932, *; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4719, ** \nCourt explicitly adhered to the \"principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the context of the particular case \nbefore the Court,\" drawing its decision \"as narrowly as possible.\" Id. at 631 (citing Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, \n1947, 331 U.S. 549, 91 L. Ed. 1666, 67 S. Ct. 1409 (1947)). If there ever were a time to end legalized segregation, that \nwas the time. The Court was in a position to paint with a broad brush and eliminate the very regime which denied civil \nrights to Sweatt and other blacks. Chief Justice Vinson's opinion for the Court, however, resisted calls to wax on \n\"broader issues . . . urged for our consideration.\" Id. \nThe panel majority in our case displayed no such discipline, instead taking the unauthorized liberty of deciding the \nappropriateness of diversity as an admissions criterion, not just the [**128]  merits of the instant admissions policy. \nConstitutional interpretation is a sensitive project. Limiting ourselves to the facts before the court keeps the process \nmeasured--it is a traditional check which respects the need to calibrate rights and interests carefully. Given the sensitiv-\nity of constitutional interpretation, the panel majority's decision disrespects the importance of the facts. Refusing to cor-\nrect this travesty en banc is a grave error. \nAs to the request to intervene, what class of persons is more qualified to adduce the evidence of the present effects \nof past discrimination than current and prospective black law students? Reading Sweatt as a benchmark decision mark-\ning the end of de jure segregation is akin to shelving Trotsky's The History of the Russian Revolution upon reading only \nthe preface. Just as those initial pages fall to give a true rendition of the entire work, so too does Sweatt give only a su-\nperficial understanding of the racism it hardly addressed. A year after the Supreme Court ordered that Sweatt be admit-\nted, he left the law school \"without graduating after being subjected to racial slurs from students and professors, cross \nburnings, and [**129]  tire slashings.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551, 555 (1994). Furthermore, \"the re-\ncord reflects that during the 1950s, and into the 1960s, the University of Texas continued to implement discriminatory \npolicies against both black and Mexican American students.\" Id. It was not until 1983 that Texas even agreed, after \nyears of threats of federal action, to an acceptable plan to desegregate its higher education system. In 1987 and again in \n1994, the Department of Education instructed Texas to maintain its plan. To this day, Texas's higher education system \nstill has not been declared in compliance with Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 556-57. \n\"The life of the law,\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, \"is not logic, but experience.\" To divorce the time \nin which it was legally possible for Sweatt to attend the Law School from the reality he experienced there is to ignore \nthe very insidiousness of racial discrimination. It was the vestiges of that discrimination which, far from being de-\nstroyed, thrived and drove Sweatt out of the Law School. We act no less callously now in pretermitting the considera-\ntion of that legacy of discrimination by denying [**130]  rehearing. \nFor all these reasons and those expressed in the collective dissent, I vehemently disagree with our court's decision \nnot to rehear this case en banc.   \n ",

The court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court, and\na majority of the judges in regular active service not having voted in favor (see FED.R.APP.P. 35 and 5TH CIR.R.\n35), the suggestion for rehearing en banc is DENIED.\nIn No. 94-50664, the court having been polled, at the request of one of the members of the court, on the\nreconsideration of this cause en banc, and a majority of the judges in regular active service not having voted in\nfavor, rehearing en banc is DENIED.\nA dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc is forthcoming and is to be published.\nPOLITZ, Chief Judge, and KING, WIENER, BENAVIDES, STEWART, PARKER and DENNIS, Circuit Judges,\ndissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc.\nSoon after the founding of the Republic, the Supreme Court indicated that the power of judicial\nreview should be exercised reluctantly, only because it is essential to the decision of the case\nbefore a federal court and because the Constitution and the laws of the United States, as the\n[1]\n\"Supreme law of the Land,\" require it.\nThis case was brought by four individual plaintiffs (not a class of plaintiffs) who were denied admission to the\nUniversity of Texas Law School (Law School) in 1992, claiming that the Law School's admission process in 1992\n722 violated the Fourteenth Amendment by giving race-based preferences exclusively to *722 blacks and Mexican\n[2]\nAmericans.  In resolving the case presented by these four plaintiffs, the panel opinion directed the Law School\n[3]\nnot to use race as a factor in the admissions process at all.  In so doing, the opinion goes out of its way to\nbreak ground that the Supreme Court itself has been careful to avoid and purports to overrule a Supreme Court\n[4]\ndecision, namely, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke.  The radical implications of this opinion, with\nits sweeping dicta, will literally change the face of public educational institutions throughout Texas, the other\nstates of this circuit, and this nation. A case of such monumental import demands the attention of more than a\ndivided panel. It should have the attention of every active judge on this court. We respectfully but emphatically\ndissent from the denial of rehearing en banc.\nFor reasons that have not been communicated to this court, and upon which we can only speculate, neither the\nplaintiffs nor the defendants have sought rehearing en banc. It would appear that in this case, some of our\ncolleagues may have embraced the rationale that, when sophisticated litigants represented by capable lawyers\nelect not to seek rehearing en banc, it is not our place to take any action. Our customary practice, however, does\nnot support this position. Indeed, not infrequently we propose rehearing en banc on our own motion, before the\nparties have requested that we do so. We reject out of hand the notion that we are merely obsequious ciphers,\nsubject to the tactical decisions and strategic maneuvers of the litigants before us. When the occasional case of\nsuch far-reaching importance to this court, to public higher education, and to this nation comes down the pike, we\nhave a duty to address it and to do the best possible job that our whole court is capable of, regardless of the\ntactical decisions of the litigants. To decline to rehear a case of this magnitude because the parties have not\nsuggested that we do so bespeaks an abdication of duty 00 the ducking of a tough question by judges who we\n97\nknow first-hand are made of sterner stuff.\n\nThe label \"judicial activism\" is usually found in the lexicon of those voicing concern about judges whom they\nperceive to be \"liberal,\" fashioning remedies beyond the scope of what is deemed to be appropriate under the\n[5]\nlaw. Such judicial legislating is generally excoriated as a \"bad thing.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas  is a text book\nexample of judicial activism. Here, two members of the three-judge panel determined to bar any consideration of\nrace in the Law School's admission process. This \"injunction\" is wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the\nmatter appealed and thus is clearly dictum; yet dictum that is a frontal assault on contrary Supreme Court\nprecedent and thus not the kind of dictum we can ignore. By tenuously stringing together pieces and shards of\nrecent Supreme Court opinions that have dealt with race in such diverse settings as minority set asides for\ngovernment contractors, broadcast licenses, redistricting, and the like, the panel creates a gossamer chain which\nit proffers as a justification for overruling Bakke. We are persuaded that this alone makes the instant case not just\nen banc-worthy but en banc mandatory.\nThe Supreme Court has left no doubt that as a constitutionally inferior court, we are compelled to follow faithfully\na directly controlling Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule\n[6]\nit.  We may not reject, dismiss, disregard, or deny Supreme Court precedent, even if, in a particular case, it\nseems pellucidly clear to litigants, lawyers, and lower court judges alike that, given the opportunity, the Supreme\nCourt would overrule its precedent.\n723 Members of this court have frequently \"preached\" against such judicial activism. In *723Williams v. Whitley[7]\nJudge Higginbotham explained the limits placed on appellate courts regarding Supreme Court precedent:\n[A]bsent clear indications from the Supreme Court itself, lower courts should not lightly assume\nthat a prior decision has been overruled sub silentio merely because its reasoning and result\nappear inconsistent with later cases. As [the district court] pointed out ... the Court issued a\nreminder to this effect only a few years ago in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American\nExpress, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989): \"If a precedent of [the\nSupreme] Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some\nother line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving\nto [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.\" Id. at 484-85, 109 S.Ct. at\n1921-22; see also id. at 486, 109 S.Ct. at 1923 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (describing anticipatory\noverruling as \"an indefensible brand of judicial activism\") ... In these circumstances, our role as an\ninferior court counsels restraint, even if the result otherwise appears inescapable.\nIn like manner, our colleagues have routinely counseled that judicial restraint is the order of the day, especially in\n[8]\nthe constitutional context. For example, in Walton v. Alexander,  Judge Garwood insisted that courts have a\nduty not to address constitutional issues not necessary to the disposition of an individual case.\n[I]t is settled that courts have a \"strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be\nresolved in order to determine the rights of the parties to the case under consideration.\" County\nCourt of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 154, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).\nThis \"responsibility to avoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication\" is \"a fundamental rule of\njudicial restraint.\" Three Affiliated Tribes v. Wold Engineering, 467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S.Ct. 2267,\n2279, 81 L.Ed.2d 113 (1984). All this, of course, applies not only to the Supreme Court but to\nlower courts as well. See Bowen v. United States, 422 U.S. 916, 920, 95 S.Ct. 2569, 2573, 45\nL.Ed.2d 641 (1975).\n[9]\nVariations of this theme can be found in the opinions of many of the judges of this court.\nThus, it seems that this court has trouble practicing what it preaches, at least in this instance. For here, Justice\n[10]\nPowell's opinion in Bakke made the Supreme Court's disposition precedential.  We unequivocally reject the\n724 proposition that it does not mandate our disposition. The syllogisms tacked together *724 and proffered by the\nmajority opinion as proof that Justice Powell's diversity conclusion is no longer good law do not, under any\n[11]\nstandards of which we are aware, qualify as an overruling of Bakke.  To the contrary, direct reference to\n[12]\nJustice Powell's diversity analysis documents, supports, and reinforces its continuing validity.  Consequently,\n\neven if the members of the panel majority were convinced that the Supreme Court is certain to overrule Bakke, in\nthe absence of an express overruling, they had no option but to grin, follow Bakke, bear it, and patiently await the\nSupreme Court's reconsideration. Rather than following this universally recognized canon, adhering to our\nestablished rules, and applying Supreme Court precedent, the panel charted a path into terra incognita. Judicial\nself-restraint was the first casualty; it proved to be too burdensome. The teachings proscribing the consideration\nof constitutional issues unnecessary to the decision soon followed. With these two limitations adroitly set aside,\nthe panel majority apparently considered itself positioned to overrule Bakke.\nGiving the panel majority the benefit of the doubt, as we are wont to do and should do, and assuming arguendo\nthat Bakke's diversity issue had to be addressed in this particular case, would it not have been the more judicious\ncourse to have brought our full en banc powers to bear on this difficult, vitally important question? It can hardly be\ngainsaid that reasonable jurists can and likely will differ on an issue of such magnitude, depth, and importance.\nIndeed, this very truism compels giving to the entire court the opportunity to devote to this crucial case its focused\nconsideration. Conceivably, after an en banc rehearing the panel result, its reasoning, and even its dicta, might\nbe embraced by a majority of the en banc court. But that is not the point; even if that unprecedented and, we\nsuggest, impertinent step 00 a federal circuit court, sitting en banc, purporting to overrule a Supreme Court\n97\n[13]\nprecedent 00 were to be taken, it would not be taken until sixteen of the seventeen active judges of this court\n97\nhad an opportunity to consider and participate in the deliberations on this matter fully.\nThere are many things which a \"yea\" vote on an en banc poll is not: It is not necessarily a vote against the\nanalysis; it is not necessarily a vote against the result; it is not necessarily a vote against a panel opinion or in\nfavor of a special concurrence or a dissent. It is rather an affirmative statement that, for one or more reasons, a\ncase or an issue is worthy of the time, attention, and efforts of the entire court. Hopwood is such a case.\nUnfortunately, a bare majority of our colleagues have joined hands to deny this storied court the opportunity to\nconsider this case en banc.\nThe majority of the panel overruled Bakke, wrote far too broadly, and spoke a plethora of unfortunate dicta. That\nwas not their prerogative, yet this court declined to reconsider Hopwood en banc. From that decision we must,\nperforce, dissent.\nSTEWART, Circuit Judge, dissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc.\nI wholeheartedly concur in the dissent to the denial of en banc rehearing. I write separately to underscore the lack\nof historical perspective and sensitivity in both the panel majority's opinion and the vote not to consider this case\nen banc.\nThat it is the University of Texas School of Law's admissions policy at issue is a fact whose significance has not\nbeen lost on any of us. In 1946, this very school denied admission to Heman Marion Sweatt because he was\nblack, prompting him to sue the University. Sweatt's real difficulties began fifty years before when the United\n725 States Supreme Court scripted one of this nation's *725 most evil conceits in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537,\n16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), declaring \"separate but equal\" treatment of black Americans constitutional. \nPlessy was no more than a license for continued racial discrimination. However, in 1950 the Supreme Court held\nthat excluding Sweatt on account of his race violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n[1]\nSweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950).\nHistory, in its characteristic irony, takes this court to that hallowed ground of civil rights jurisprudence to assess\nthe University's effort to encourage minority enrollment and counter its legacy of segregation. It is an unfortunate,\nfurther irony that the panel majority opinion should so overreach in its decision. In Sweatt's case, the Supreme\nCourt explicitly adhered to the \"principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the context of the particular\ncase before the Court,\" drawing its decision \"as narrowly as possible.\" Id. at 631, 70 S.Ct. at 849 (citing Rescue\nArmy v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947)). If there ever were a time to end\nlegalized segregation, that was the time. The Court was in a position to paint with a broad brush and eliminate\nthe very regime which denied civil rights to Sweatt and other blacks. Chief Justice Vinson's opinion for the Court,\nhowever, resisted calls to wax on \"[b]roader issues ... urged for our consideration.\" Id.\n\nThe panel majority in our case displayed no such discipline, instead taking the unauthorized liberty of deciding\nthe appropriateness of diversity as an admissions criterion, not just the merits of the instant admissions policy.\nConstitutional interpretation is a sensitive project. Limiting ourselves to the facts before the court keeps the\nprocess measured 00 it is a traditional check which respects the need to calibrate rights and interests carefully.\n97\nGiven the sensitivity of constitutional interpretation, the panel majority's decision disrespects the importance of\nthe facts. Refusing to correct this travesty en banc is a grave error.\nAs to the request to intervene, what class of persons is more qualified to adduce the evidence of the present\neffects of past discrimination than current and prospective black law students? Reading Sweatt as a benchmark\ndecision marking the end of de jure segregation is and to shelving Trotsky's The History of the Russian\nRevolution upon reading only the preface. Just as those initial pages fail to give a true rendition of the entire\nwork, so too does Sweatt give only a superficial understanding of the racism it hardly addressed. A year after the\nSupreme Court ordered that Sweatt be admitted, he left the law school \"without graduating after being subjected\nto racial slurs from students and professors, cross burnings, and tire slashings.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861\nF.Supp. 551, 555 (1994). Furthermore, \"the record reflects that during the 1950s, and into the 1960s, the\nUniversity of Texas continued to implement discriminatory policies against both black and Mexican American\nstudents.\" Id. It was not until 1983 that Texas even agreed, after years of threats of federal action, to an\nacceptable plan to desegregate its higher education system. In 1987 and again in 1994, the Department of\nEducation instructed Texas to maintain its plan. To this day, Texas's higher education system still has not been\ndeclared in compliance with Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 556-57.\n\"The life of the law,\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, \"is not logic, but experience.\" To divorce the time in\nwhich it was legally possible for Sweatt to attend the Law School from the reality he experienced there is to\nignore the very insidiousness of racial discrimination. It was the vestiges of that discrimination which, far from\nbeing destroyed, thrived and drove Sweatt out of the Law School. We act no less callously now in pretermitting\nthe consideration of that legacy of discrimination by denying rehearing.\n726 *726 For all these reasons and those expressed in the collective dissent, I vehemently disagree with our court's\ndecision not to rehear this case en banc.\n[1] Judge Emilio M. Garza did not participate in this decision.\n[1]Baker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289, 298 (5th Cir. 1985) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (citing Marbury v.

Its membership is comprised of law stu-\ndents, predominantly African-American, currently in attendance at the law school. One of the goals of the orga-\nnization, according to the affidavit of the organization's current president, is to encourage the admission of \ngreater numbers of African-American students to the law school. \nThe Black Pre-Law Association, an organization of African-American undergraduate students currently at-\ntending the University of Texas, is comprised of students who have applied or who may apply to law school. A \ncentral goal of the organization, according to the affidavit of the current president, is to promote African-\nAmerican students' interest in the law and to assist them in the application and admission process. \n [*4]  \n2   Not surprisingly, the Plaintiffs are opposed to the intervention; the Defendants are not. \nThis is a lawsuit in which four individuals contend they were denied admission to the University of Texas School \nof Law because of a racially discriminatory admission policy. The initial lawsuit was filed in September 1992. A some-\nwhat lengthy and strongly argued debate on the issues of standing and ripeness soon ensued, which culminated in this \nCourt's denial of the Defendants' motions for summary judgment by order dated October 28, 1993. In November 1993, \nbecause of some confusion by the parties regarding the posture of the cause and because of the Court's concern with \nefficiently moving the cause to trial, the Court set deadlines for pleading and motion filings, as well as for discovery. Of \nconsequence to the motion now before the Court are the deadlines of March 11, 1994, for a final pretrial status confer-\nence to address pretrial issues and set a trial date; of April 1, 1994, for the completion of discovery; and of April 15, \n1994, for a joint pretrial order to be filed. Now, with only a little over [*5]  two months to go before the completion of \ndiscovery, which has already been a contentious process and evidently involves a multitude of documents, two new \nentities wish to become parties to the litigation. \nThe prospective intervenors seek intervention both under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), which provides \nfor intervention as a matter of right, and under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b), which provides for permissive \n \n\n \nintervention. In seeking intervention, the prospective intervenors basically claim they have a substantial interest in pro-\ntecting the law school's affirmative-action admissions program that will not be adequately protected the Defendants. \nFor intervention under Rule 24(a), the movant must meet the following requirements: (1) the motion must be \ntimely; (2) the movant must have an interest relating to the transaction that is the subject of the ongoing action; (3) the \nmovant must be so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its \ninterest in the litigation; and (4) the movant's interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties to the litiga-\ntion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a); Bush v. Viterna, 740 F.2d 350, 354 (5th Cir. 1984). [*6]  If a prospective intervenor fails \nto meet any one of the requirements, it cannot intervene as a matter of right. Bush, 740 F.2d at 354. \nThe prospective intervenors contend their specific interest in promoting the legal education for African Americans \nis not adequately represented by the Defendants, who have historically acted in a manner adverse to the interests of the \nproposed intervenors. However, as a practical matter, the prospective intervenors and the Defendants have the same \nultimate objective in this lawsuit -- the preservation of the admissions policy and procedure currently used by the law \nschool. \nWhen a prospective intervenor \"has the same ultimate objective as a party to the suit, a presumption arises that its \ninterests are adequately represented, against which the petitioner must demonstrate adversity of interest, collusion, or \nnonfeasance.\" Id. at 355 (citation omitted). While the presumption of adequate representation may be rebutted on a rela-\ntively minimal showing, the prospective intervenors must \"produce something more than speculation as to the purported \ninadequacy.\" Moosehead Sanitary Dist. v. S.G. Phillips Corp., 610 F.2d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 1979). [*7]  Further, the poten-\ntial obstruction and delay that may be caused by allowing intervention fully justifies a requirement that a clear showing \nrather than a mere allegation that prospective intervenors' interests will not be adequately represented by an existing \nparty be made. United States v. Int'l Tel & Tel. Corp., 349 F. Supp. 22, 27 n.4 (D.C. Conn. 1972), aff'd sub nom. Nader \nv. United States, 410 U.S. 919, 35 L. Ed. 2d 582, 93 S. Ct. 1363 (1973). \nThe Court finds the prospective intervenors have not overcome the presumption of adequate representation. Fur-\nther, the Defendants have demonstrated they have sufficient motivation and ability to defend vigorously the current ad-\nmissions policy. Because this Court finds the prospective intervenors have failed to overcome the fourth test for inter-\nvention, inadequate representation by the Defendants, the prospective intervenors are not entitled to intervene as a mat-\nter of right. \nIn making a determination of whether to allow permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), a court must determine if \nthree conditions are met: (1) the movant must show an independent ground for jurisdiction; (2) the motion must be \ntimely;  [*8]  and (3) the movant's claim or defense and the main action must have a question of law or fact in common. \nVenegas v. Skaggs, 867 F.2d 527, 529 (9th Cir. 1989), aff'd sub nom. Venegas v. Mitchell, 495 U.S. 82, 109 L. Ed. 2d \n74, 110 S. Ct. 1679 (1990). Additionally, a court must consider whether the intervention will \"unduly delay or prejudice \nthe adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" See Fed R. Civ. P. 24(b). \nThe prospective intervenors contend that, because they seek to raise defenses sharing common factual and legal \nquestions with the main action, they are entitled to permissive intervention. However, the existence of a common ques-\ntion of law or fact will not automatically entitle a movant to intervene; the district court has the discretion to determine \nthe fairest and most efficient method of handling the lawsuit. Venegas, 867 F.2d at 530; see also Bush, 740 F.2d at 354 \n(permissive intervention wholly discretionary even if common question of law or fact or requirements of Rule 24(b) \notherwise satisfied). Further, as discussed above, the Court has found the interests of the prospective intervenors [*9]  \nare adequately represented by the Defendants; adding the prospective intervenors as defendants at this juncture in the \nlawsuit would needlessly increase cost and delay disposition of the litigation. 3 \n \n3   The Court believes the appropriate role for the prospective intervenors, if any, in this lawsuit is as amicus cu-\nriae. However, the prospective intervenors have not requested amicus curiae status. \nAccordingly, the Court enters the following order: \nIT IS ORDERED that the Motion of Thurgood Marshall Legal Society and Black Pre-Law Association to Intervene \nas Defendants is DENIED without prejudice to seeking leave to participate as amicus curiae. \nSIGNED this the 19th day of January 1994. \nSAM SPARKS \n \n\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \n ",

It appears \nall of the causes of action of the named plaintiffs have now been concluded along with all costs and attorney's fees in \nappropriate judgments that should be immediately paid. The Court has no basis whatsoever to set any hearings with \nregard to any past or proposed alleged misconduct or, behalf of any defendant. Therefore, there are no live issues to be \ndetermined in this case. \nThe Court regrets, as do all parties, that this case was not finally determined by the United States Supreme Court, \nbut the world is not a perfect place, and all things, especially old cases, most come to an end. The Court believes the end \nhas come for this case. \nThe Clerk is ORDERED to mark this file closed and permit no further filing except any notice of appeal. \nSIGNED this the 24th day of July 2001. \nSam Sparks \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n ",

Hopwood, Douglas W. Carvell, Kenneth R. Elliot, and David A.\nRogers filed suit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 (West 1994) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n[1]\nU.S.C. § 2000d (West 1994) (\"Title VI\"),  against the defendants the State of Texas, the University of Texas\nBoard of Regents, the University of Texas, the University of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\"), and various\n\n[2]\nUniversity of Texas officials in their official capacities.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as\nwell as compensatory and punitive damages. The Court held an eight-day bench trial in the case in May 1994.\nOn August 19, 1994, the Court issued its memorandum opinion in Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F.Supp. 551\n(W.D.Tex.1994) (\"Hopwood I\"). In deference to controlling Supreme Court precedent, the Court declined to\ndeclare the law school's use of racial preferences in its admissions system unconstitutional per se, see id. at\n553-54, and instead applied strict scrutiny to the law school's admissions system, see id. at 568-69. Relying\nprimarily on Justice Powell's opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct.\n2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), the Court found that the law school's use of racial preferences for the purpose of\nachieving a diverse student body served a compelling state interest under the Fourteenth Amendment. See \nHopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 569-571. Additionally, the Court found that the remedial nature of the admissions\nprocess, in which racial classifications were used as a means of overcoming the present effects of past race\ndiscrimination, served a compelling governmental interest. See id. at 571-73. The Court ultimately concluded,\n[3]\nhowever, that the law school's use of separate admissions procedures for minorities and nonminorities  was not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve those compelling interests because the process prevented any meaningful\ncomparative evaluation among applicants of different races. See id. at 573-579. The Court therefore entered\ndeclaratory judgment that the law school's 1992 admissions procedures violated the Fourteenth Amendment. See\nid. at 582.\nThe Court then considered whether any of the four plaintiffs was denied admission in 1992 as a result of the\nconstitutionally impermissible method in which the law school considered race in its admissions procedures. In\ndetermining which party bore the burden of persuasion on that issue, the Court adopted a burden-shifting\nscheme similar to that used in employment discrimination cases brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (West 1994) (\"Title VII\"), and placed the ultimate burden of persuasion on the\n878 plaintiffs.[4]See*878id. at 579-80. The Court found that the plaintiffs failed to establish by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that they would have been offered admission to the law school under a constitutional admissions\nprocess. See id. at 580-82. The Court therefore declined to award the plaintiffs injunctive relief (that is, an\n[5]\nimmediate order of admission) or compensatory damages. See id. at 582-83. Furthermore, given the\nundisputed remedial goals of the admissions program, as well as the fact that the law school adopted the\nprogram in a good faith effort to comply with federal guidelines under Title VI, the Court declined to issue an\naward of punitive damages. See id. at 583. Finally, because the law school had substantially modified its\nadmissions procedures by the end of the trial to provide for individual comparison among minority and\nnonminority applicants (thereby remedying the infirmity identified by the Court in its opinion), the Court declined\nto issue any permanent injunctive relief against the law school. See id. at 582.\nA three-member panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the Court's decision in part in \nHopwood v. State of Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir.),cert. denied,518 U.S. 1033, 116 S.Ct. 2581, 135 L.Ed.2d\n[6]\n1095 (1996) (\"Hopwood II\").  The Fifth Circuit declared that the law school's use of racial preferences served no\n[7]\ncompelling state interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. at 941-55. The divided Fifth Circuit panel\ntherefore directed the law school not to use race as a factor in admissions, although it declined to order any\npermanent injunctive relief to that effect. See id. at 958. Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Court's\nallocation of the burden of proof on the issue of causation 00 whether any of the four plaintiffs would have been\n97\nadmitted to the law school under a constitutional system. Using the burden-shifting scheme of Mt. Healthy City\nSchool District Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), the Fifth Circuit\ndetermined the law school bore the burden of proof on that issue because the plaintiffs had successfully\nestablished the unconstitutionality of the admissions system. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 955-57.\nOn remand, the Fifth Circuit directed the Court to reconsider two issues. First, the panel directed the Court to\napply the proper burden and to reevaluate whether any of the four plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law\nschool in the absence of admissions procedures which took into account an applicant's race or ethnicity. Second,\nthe Fifth Circuit instructed the Court to \"revisit\" the issue of damages in the event the law school fails to meet its\nburden: \"In the event that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a\n879 respective plaintiff would not have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions *879\n\n[8]\nsystem, the court is to award to that plaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\" Id. at\n957.\nIn accordance with the Fifth Circuit's instructions on remand, this case was tried before the Court on March 31\nand April 2, 3, and 7, 1997. Having carefully considered the evidence presented at both trials and the arguments\nand briefing of counsel, the Court finds the law school has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that none\nof the plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions system. In the\nevent any of the plaintiffs successfully appeals that decision, the Court makes several alternative factual findings\nand legal conclusions regarding the issue of damages. Finally, the Court enters its findings of fact and\nconclusions of law regarding the attorneys' fees to which the plaintiffs are entitled as prevailing parties under 42\nU.S.C. § 1988 (West 1994).\nII.\nThe admissions process employed by the law school in 1992 and the plaintiffs' qualifications for admission are\nsummarized here for the convenience of the reader and to provide a context for the opinions of the defendants'\n[9]\nexpert on causation, Professor Olin Guy Wellborn, III.  In 1992, the law school received 4,494 applications for\n[10]\nadmission to fill approximately 500 available seats. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 563; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d\nat 935 n. 2. Given the rather large volume of applications it receives, the law school devised and for several\ndecades has used an administrative procedure by which applicants are categorized according to their Texas\nIndex (\"TI\") score. An applicant's TI score is calculated by the Law School Data Assembly Service (\"LSDAS\"). It is\na composite number reflecting both the applicant's grade point average (\"GPA\") and score on the Law School\nAptitude Test (\"LSAT\"), and it is generally considered a rough predictor of one's probability of success in law\nschool. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 557 n. 9; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935 & n. 1. In 1992, the law school\nplaced each applicant, as dictated by his or her TI score, into one of the following three categories: presumptive\nadmit, presumptive deny, and the discretionary zone. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 558; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at\n935.\nThe admissions committee in 1992 comprised nine professors, two assistant deans, and four students. Hopwood\nI, 861 F.Supp. at 560. Three members of the admissions committee, Professor Stanley Johanson and Assistant\nDeans Susana Alemán and Laquita Hamilton, formed a subcommittee to review the files of minority applicants.\n[11]\nSee id. As chair of the admissions committee, Johnson had the responsibility of setting the presumptive\n[12]\nadmission and presumptive denial lines throughout the admissions process. See id. He set the first of several\npresumptive admission lines in late January 1992 and began extending offers at that time to ensure that the most\ndesirable applicants received offers as quickly as possible. See id. at 561. Because the law school application\n880 deadline was not until February 1, 1992 00 and thus the *880 quality of the entire applicant pool had not yet been\n97\n[13]\ndefined 00 Johanson set this initial presumptive admit line relatively high. See id. at 560-61. Johanson then\n97\nreviewed the files within the presumptive admission category to determine whether the applicant's TI score was\ninflated by high grades in a noncompetitive university and/or major, or whether there was some other\nquestionable aspect to the applicant's file. See id. at 561. \"Those applications with a high TI reflecting a high\nLSAT and high grades in a rigorous major at a leading undergraduate institution were admitted by Johanson, who\nhad unilateral authority to admit any applicant in this category without further consultation with the full admissions\ncommittee.\" Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561. Questionable files (roughly five to ten percent of all presumptive\nadmit files) were placed in the discretionary zone for further review. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936.\nEssentially the same procedure occurred at the other end of the spectrum. Johanson set the initial presumptive\ndenial line, and one or two members of the admissions committee then reviewed all of the applications in this\ncategory. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561. Applicants with TI scores that understated their competitive\nstanding relative to the rest of the pool were upgraded to the discretionary zone. See id. Johanson testified at the\nfirst trial that he could not recall the number of presumptive deny files that were upgraded in 1992, although\ngenerally twenty to forty files were moved to the discretionary zone as a result of this review. See id. The\ndiscretionary zone, therefore, comprised \"those applicants whose TIs fell between the presumptive denial line\nand the presumptive admission line, those applicants who Johanson had moved down from the presumptive\n\nadmission category, and those applicants who reviewers had moved up from the presumptive denial category.\" \nId.\nThe law school's admissions procedures treated minority applicants differently in two ways. First, the presumptive\n[14]\nadmissions and denial lines were lower for minorities than they were for nonminorities.  By March 1992, the\npresumptive admission line for resident nonminorities was lowered from 202 to 199, while the presumptive denial\nline was set at 192. See id. at 561-62. For Mexican-Americans, however, the presumptive admission line was\nlowered from 196 to 189, and for blacks this line was lowered from 192 to 189. For both minority groups, the\npresumptive denial line was 179. See id. at 562; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936. Second, minority and nonminority\nfiles within their respective discretionary zones were segregated and subjected to different procedures of review.\nThe minority subcommittee was to meet as a group to review and discuss all the minority files. Although the\nminority subcommittee provided the full admissions committee with summaries of the files they considered to be\ngood candidates, the subcommittee's admissions decisions were virtually final. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at\n562. Nonminority applications, on the other hand, were separated into weighted stacks of thirty files, and each\n[15]\nstack was reviewed by a random three-member panel of the admissions committee. See id. Rather than\nreview the piles as a group, each member of the panel conducted an independent and secret screening of the\n881 stack of thirty files and voted to offer admission to an average of nine applicants from the stack.[16]See id.*881\nJohanson then tallied the number of votes each applicant received within his or her stack of thirty. Applicants\nreceiving two or three votes were offered admission, applicants receiving no votes were immediately denied\nadmission, and applicants receiving one vote were offered a position on the waiting list. See id.\nThe plaintiffs were each reviewed by a three-member panel in the nonminority discretionary zone screening, and\nall were considered Texas residents by the admissions committee. Hopwood received an associate's degree in\naccounting from Montgomery County Community College in 1984, and she earned a bachelor's degree in\naccounting from California State University-Sacramento in 1988. She graduated with a GPA of 3.80 and had an\n[17]\nLSAT score in the 83rd percentile. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 564; P-145. Although Hopwood had a TI\nscore of 199 which, by March 1992, placed her just within the presumptive admit line, Johanson concluded her\nGPA overstated her educational background and therefore downgraded her file to the discretionary zone. See id.\nat 564. Carvell, Elliot and Rogers each had a TI score of 197. Carvell attended Hendrix College in Conway,\nArkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1991. He had a GPA of 3.28 and\n[18]\nan average LSAT score in the 76th percentile. See id. at 566-67; P-151. Elliot graduated with a bachelor's\ndegree in accounting from the University of Texas in 1984, where he earned a GPA of 2.98, and he scored in the\n95th percentile on the LSAT. Following graduation, he became a certified public accountant (\"CPA\") and worked\nfor various state agencies in Texas as an auditor or examiner. See id. at 565-66. Rogers earned an\nundergraduate degree in professional writing from the University of Houston-Downtown in 1990. In the early to\nmid-1980s, he attended the University of Texas, where he was placed on academic probation once and\ndismissed twice for poor scholastic performance. He had a cumulative GPA of 3.13 and an LSAT score in the\n94th percentile. Rogers earned a master's degree in professional writing from the University of Southern\nCalifornia in 1992. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 567; P-171. By contrast, the median GPA for white students in\nthe 1992 entering class was 3.56, and the median LSAT score was in the 91st percentile. See Hopwood II, 78\nF.3d at 936-37 & n. 7. For all students (minority and nonminority) in the 1992 entering class, the median GPA was\n3.52, while the median LSAT score was in the 89th percentile. See id.\nHopwood and Carvell each received one vote in screening, were offered positions on the waiting list, and were\neventually denied admission to the law school in Spring 1992. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 564-66. Elliot and\n[19]\nRogers received no votes in screening and were immediately notified of their rejection in April 1992. See id. at\n565-67. By the end of the admissions process, the law school had extended offers to 936 resident and\nnonresident applicants. See id. at 563 n. 32. Of the 637 offers extended to Texas residents, 96 went to blacks\nand Mexican-Americans and 541 went to whites and nonpreferred minorities. See D-519. The plaintiffs were\n882 therefore among over 3,500 individuals, including approximately 1,500 Texas residents, *882 who were denied\nadmission to the law school in 1992.\n\nIII.\nThe Fifth Circuit characterizes Mt. Healthy as devising \"a test of `causation' that place[s] the burden of proving no\nharm on the defendant\" when the plaintiff establishes the defendant intended to discriminate or otherwise acted\nunconstitutionally. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 956. The Court respectfully suggests that the Mt. Healthy\nframework is inapplicable to this case and the plaintiffs should retain the burden of proof. In Mt. Healthy, an\nuntenured teacher claimed a school board's decision not to rehire him was the result of the comments he had\nmade on a radio show. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 281-3, 97 S.Ct. at 573-74. Although the board conceded the\ncomments had influenced its decision not to rehire the teacher, the board asserted the teacher would not have\nbeen rehired in any event because of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons unrelated to the exercise of his First\nAmendment rights.\nThe district court found that the teacher's comments were protected by the First Amendment and that they played\na \"substantial part\" in the board's decision not to rehire him. See id. at 283, 97 S.Ct. at 574. The district court\nordered the teacher's reinstatement, which ultimately resulted in his receiving tenure, and the circuit court\naffirmed the trial court's findings and conclusions. See id. at 283-86, 97 S.Ct. at 574-75. Mt. Healthy was unique\nin that it presented the Supreme Court with a \"mixed motives\" case in which the governmental entity admitted it\nconsidered both legitimate and illegitimate factors in reaching its employment decision, in contrast to the typical\n[20]\n\"pretext\" case in which the only issue is whether any improper or discriminatory motive exists.  Therefore, the\nquestion before the Supreme Court was whether the plaintiff had necessarily shown a constitutional violation\njustifying remedial action simply by establishing that the protected conduct was a \"substantial\" factor in the\nboard's decision not to rehire him. See id. at 285, 97 S.Ct. at 575.\nThe Supreme Court answered that question in the negative. The Supreme Court reasoned that allowing a plaintiff\nto recover under those circumstances might \"place the employee in a better position as a result of the exercise of\nconstitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing,\" because it would require\nholding the defendant liable even though the same employment decision would have been made for entirely\nlegitimate reasons. Id. In response to this dilemma, the Supreme Court devised a burden-shifting framework in\nwhich the plaintiff initially bears the burden of proving that the constitutionally protected conduct was a\n\"substantial\" or \"motivating\" factor behind the employer's discriminatory action. See id. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576; \nVillage of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 270 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. 555, 566 n. 21,\n50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (characterizing the plaintiff's burden as a \"required threshold showing\"). Only after the\nplaintiff makes this showing does the burden then shift to the defendant to prove that the violation was \"largely\n883 harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957. Therefore, unlike the McDonnell Douglas framework *883 used in\nTitle VII pretext cases (in which the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff at all times), the burden of\npersuasion shifts to the defendant in mixed-motives cases once it is either conceded by the defendant or\ndetermined by the fact finder that the employer considered impermissible factors in reaching its adverse\nemployment decision. Mt. Healthy therefore confirms the rather uncontroversial proposition that plaintiffs are\nrequired to prove injury-in-fact in order to collect monetary damages. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. at 285, 97 S.Ct.\nat 575.\nUnlike the adverse employment action at issue in Mt. Healthy, there are two types of injury in a case involving the\nunlawful use of racial preferences. As the Court recognized in Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 583, there is an\nintangible injury resulting from the government's discriminatory classification which prevents a plaintiff from\n[21]\n\"competing on an equal footing\" with other applicants. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 (quoting Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2105, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995)). All nonminorities\nwho applied to the law school in 1992, including nonminority students who were admitted, suffered that kind of\ninjury. A second, tangible type of injury 00 an injury-in-fact 00 occurs when a plaintiff is actually denied some right or\n97 97\nbenefit, such as admission to the law school, as a direct result of the use of unlawful racial preferences. In\napplying the Mt. Healthy framework to this case, the Fifth Circuit affirmed this Court's conclusion that the law\nschool's 1992 admissions procedures were constitutionally flawed. With virtually no explanation, however, the\nFifth Circuit then asserted that, as a result of that determination alone, the defendants bear the burden of proving\nthat the constitutional violation against the four plaintiffs was \"largely harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957\n\n(\"In this case, there is no question that a constitutional violation occurred (as the district court found) and that the\nplaintiffs were harmed thereby.\"). The Fifth Circuit's analysis in this regard was incomplete at best; at worst, it was\na misapplication of the Mt. Healthy framework because it presupposed that race was a substantial or motivating\nfactor in every nonminority applicant's denial of admission to the law school in 1992, regardless of the applicant's\nqualifications to enter law school. As a matter of common sense and rudimentary mathematics, that cannot be\nthe case.\nThere is no basis in fact or logic to suggest, as the Fifth Circuit apparently does in Hopwood II, that all resident\nnonminority applicants who were denied admission to the law school in 1992 were denied admission substantially\n00 or, for that matter, even in small part 00 because of race. Even assuming all 96 offers of admission made to\n97 97\nresident minorities in 1992 were available, there would still remain approximately 1,400 resident applicants in\n1992 (the overwhelming majority of whom, presumably, were nonminorities) who would have been denied\nadmission without regard to race. At most, therefore, only 7% of resident nonminority applicants were affected by\n884 the law school's use of racial preferences.[22] Suppose this *884 case had been brought by the least qualified\nnonminority who applied to the law school in 1992. Under Adarand, that applicant clearly would have standing to\nchallenge the affirmative action program. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212, 115 S.Ct. at 2105. However, an\napplicant who has no conceivable chance of admission cannot possibly show that race was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in the law school's decision to deny him or her admission. The Mt. Healthy burden-shifting\nframework is never implicated. In contrast, Hopwood II always shifts the burden to the defendant 00 and would\n97\nshift the burden even in the example of the candidate with no chance of admission 00 once the plaintiff establishes\n97\nthe unconstitutionality of the affirmative action program. But being subjected to admissions procedures that take\ninto account racial preferences does not, in and of itself, establish or even imply that the applicant's race was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor in his or her denial. Importantly, in this case the law school, unlike the University\nof California in Bakke, never conceded that the plaintiffs would have been admitted in the absence of an\naffirmative action program, and this Court specifically found the plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of persuasion\non that point. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 581-82.\nThe harm in the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of Mt. Healthy is not readily apparent in the Court's example because\nit would be quite easy for the law school in that instance to establish the applicant's non-admission. The harm\noccurs, for example, when the suit is brought by a candidate who has some chance of admission under a race-\nneutral procedure but who would not be able to prove that he or she would have been admitted by a\npreponderance of the evidence. The Fifth Circuit decision potentially gives those candidates a windfall by placing\nthe ultimate burden of proof on the defendant: close calls must always be decided in favor of the plaintiff. And yet\nthe function and purpose of the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting scheme are just the opposite 00 to ferret out instances\n97\nof discrimination and to ensure that the plaintiff is not put in a better position than he or she ordinarily would have\noccupied. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit recognized in Hopwood II that Mt. Healthy was intended to give the defendant\n\"a second chance of prevailing by showing that the violation was largely harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at\n957. Instead of giving the defendant a second chance of prevailing, the Fifth Circuit gives the defendant little\nchance of prevailing when the applicant is an extremely close call. The Fifth Circuit decision essentially allows a\n[23]\nplaintiff to recover monetary damages without ever having to establish any injury-in-fact.\nMt. Healthy does not apply to this case. One might be able to make a normative argument that the defendants\nshould bear the ultimate burden of persuasion once the plaintiffs establish the unconstitutionality of the law\nschool's affirmative action program, but the legal argument cannot be justified. This is a classic pretext case in\nwhich the trier of fact 00 in this case, the Court 00 must determine why each of the four plaintiffs was denied\n97 97\nadmission to the law school. If the plaintiffs were denied admission because of their race, they should have to\nprove it, as plaintiffs must in every other pretext case brought in federal and state court. The Court therefore\n885 respectfully but strenuously objects to this portion of the Fifth Circuit *885 opinion. The Court is cognizant,\nhowever, of the panel's instructions on remand, and it will faithfully and responsibly execute them.\n\nA.\nThe defendants presented one expert on causation, Olin Guy Wellborn, a tenured professor who has taught at\n[24]\nthe law school since 1974.  Wellborn has served on the law school admissions committee for over 15 years\nand was a member of the admissions committee in 1992. In accordance with the Fifth Circuit decision, Wellborn\nanalyzed whether the plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions\nsystem. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 & n. 55. In preparation for his expert reports, Wellborn testified he\ncarefully examined the LSDAS sheets of approximately 450 applicants, including the LSDAS sheets of the 96\nminorities admitted in 1992. Wellborn, vol. 1 at 45. He then narrowed the field to approximately 200 of the \"most\npromising\" minority and nonminority candidates, as reflected by their LSDAS sheets, and he reviewed those\napplication files in their entirety. Id. Wellborn prepared two expert reports, employing a different methodology in\neach one. See D-519 and D-520. In both reports he concluded that none of the plaintiffs would have been\nadmitted in a raceblind admissions procedure. See id.\n(1) Wellborn's First Report\nIn his first report, Wellborn examined the 1992 admissions process and then considered how that process would\nhave been modified in a manner that would yield the same total number of admissions on a race-blind basis.\nWellborn first compared the relation between an applicant's TI score and the statistical rate of admittance in the\nactual 1992 admissions process. Wellborn detected the emergence of a pattern in which candidates with TI\nscores of 203 or higher were virtually all admitted and candidates with TI scores of 184 or lower were virtually all\ndenied. A discretionary zone candidate's statistical chance of admittance generally increased by an additional 10\n[25]\nor 20 percentage points with each successive TI score.  Hopwood's TI score of 199 corresponded to an\nacceptance rate of 89%, and a TI score of 197 (the TI score belonging to Carvell, Elliot, and Rogers)\n886 corresponded to an acceptance rate of 59%. This pattern of percentages reflected a *886 typical, yearly\n[26]\nphenomenon. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 145.\nBecause the actual 1992 presumptive admission and denial lines were lower for minorities than for nonminorities,\nWellborn had to adjust the overall presumptive admission and denial lines in creating a hypothetical admissions\n[27]\nsystem.  Wellborn therefore lowered the overall presumptive admit and deny lines to 198 and 190,\nrespectively, and retained the 1992 average of nine votes per pile of thirty files. Wellborn assumed the law school\n[28]\nwould extend the same number of resident offers that it had extended in 1992. See D-520; Wellborn, vol. 1 at\n237. Using this methodology, Wellborn predicted a pattern of percentages in admissions almost identical to the\n1992 admissions percentages, except that each percentage of admission would be \"notched down\" by one TI\nscore throughout. In other words, Wellborn predicted that virtually all candidates with a TI score of 202 and above\nwould have been admitted; 90% of applicants with TI scores ranging from 198 to 201 would have been admitted;\n[29]\n70% of applicants with TI scores of 197 would have been admitted, and so on down the Texas Index.\n887 Wellborn then reexamined *887 the application files of the four plaintiffs, the admitted minority resident\napplicants, and the denied nonminority resident applicants at their respective TI scores to determine who would\nhave received the additional offers as dictated by the predetermined percentages of admission.\nWellborn predicted that one additional offer of admission would be made at Hopwood's TI score. Of the ten\nadmitted minority and denied nonminority resident applicants at the 199 TI level, Wellborn concluded that seven\napplicants, including the four minority applicants, were \"clearly stronger\" than Hopwood and that the remaining\ntwo applicants were \"comparable\" to Hopwood. As in the actual admissions process in 1992, Wellborn\ndetermined that Hopwood would most likely have been placed in the discretionary zone by Professor Johanson\nand that she would not have received the two or three votes necessary to be admitted. At the 197 TI score of\nCarvell, Elliot, and Rogers, Wellborn estimated that the law school would have extended seven additional offers.\n[30]\n Wellborn identified the seven applicants he predicted would have been offered admission over Carvell, Elliot,\nand Rogers, and he also rated those seven applicants superior to Hopwood. Wellborn then identified four\nadditional applicants who, although not as strong as the original seven, were still stronger than Carvell, Elliot, and\n\nRogers. Indeed, Wellborn indicated that Rogers and Elliot were \"among the very weakest\" at that index and that\nCarvell, although a stronger applicant than Elliot and Rogers, does not compare favorably because of his\n[31]\nrelatively low combined LSAT score in the 76th percentile. See D-519.\n(2) Wellborn's Supplemental Report\nUsing his first report as a hypothesis for how the law school would have extended offers of admission in a race-\nblind procedure, Wellborn undertook the more difficult task in his supplemental report of specifically identifying (1)\nthe admitted resident minorities in 1992 who probably would have been denied admission in a race-blind\nprocedure, and (2) the denied resident nonminority applicants who most likely would have been admitted in their\nplace. Wellborn made several basic assumptions about a hypothetical race-blind admissions procedure. First, as\nhe had in his first report, Wellborn projected that the presumptive admission line would be set at 198 and that the\npresumptive denial line would be set at 190. He then assumed that all of the nonminority residents who had been\nadmitted in 1992 would have been admitted in a hypothetical race-blind admissions procedure. Therefore,\nWellborn only examined the application files of the 96 admitted minority applicants and the approximately 450\nLSDAS reports (which he then narrowed down to about 200 application files) of the denied residents (minority\n888 and nonminority) who had TI scores *888 above 190.[32]See D-520; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 45. In examining each\napplication, Wellborn primarily considered the applicant's college record and LSAT score, which he weighed\n[33]\n\"about equally,\"  and he applied identical standards to minority and nonminority candidates. See D-520. In\nevaluating the college record, he considered the caliber of the school, as manifested by the LSAT college mean,\n[34]\n and the applicant's major, rank in class, and college transcript. Wellborn also considered an applicant's\npersonal statement, letters of recommendation, and other factors and materials such as the applicant's age and\nbackground; the relevance and importance of these factors varied, of course, with each file.\nIn selecting a particular applicant for his supplemental report, Wellborn attempted to predict those candidates\nwho he believed would emerge as probable admittees. He did not, in other words, only select candidates for\nwhom he necessarily would have voted, nor did he attempt to predict how a particular admissions committee\nmember would have voted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 231-33, 249-51. Wellborn explained his approach as follows:\n[I]f I say these candidates are the ones that I judge most likely to be admitted, and these I judge to\nbe relatively unlikely to be admitted, that's not going to describe in exact detail the offers that go\nout. I'm making an overall estimate of probabilities, based upon many years of experience in\nwatching this process and having a judgment about on the average which criteria are going to be\nmost influential and most important to the reviewers as a group. And so, of course, there are going\nto be those vagaries in the voting, but I still believe in the overall validity of the prediction.\nIt certainly is not the case 00 absolutely is not the case that ... [all] denied nonminorities [within the\n97\ndiscretionary zone] ... have an equal chance [of admission] ... or that a person, as familiar as I am\nwith the process, couldn't tell you that these people have a better chance than these other people.\nI think ... it would be preposterous to suggest that ... it's just random, or that it's completely\nunpredictable.\nWellborn, vol. 1 at 250.\nThe law school made 96 offers of admission to resident minorities in 1992. Wellborn evaluated all 96 minority\nadmittees and concluded that 19 would have been admitted without regard to race. Wellborn named this group of\napplicants \"Group A.\" Wellborn then selected 2 additional resident minority admittees who, though weaker than\nthe original 19, would still have a better chance of admission than any of the plaintiffs in a color-blind procedure\n(\"Group B\"). Subtracting the Group A applicants from the actual number of resident minority admittees in 1992\n889 leaves 77 seats remaining for nonminority resident applicants who were denied in *889 1992. There were 398\nnonminority residents with TI scores of 190 or above who were denied admission in 1992; therefore, fewer than\n20% of candidates in Wellborn's hypothetical discretionary zone would have been offered admission. Of those\n[35]\n398 files, Wellborn selected 78 resident nonminority applicants  who he believed probably would have been\noffered admission in a race-blind procedure (\"Group C\"). As with the minority applicants reflected in Group B,\n\nWellborn also selected an additional 20 resident nonminority applicants who he believed had a reasonable\n[36]\nchance of admission as alternatives to the Group C candidates (\"Group D\").  Wellborn testified that none of\nthe plaintiffs merited inclusion in either Group C or D. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 115.\n[37]\nThe plaintiffs have several objections to the methodology Wellborn used in his supplemental report.  First, the\nplaintiffs argue the random admissions procedure employed in 1992 effectively prevents the defendants from\ncarrying their burden of proving that the plaintiffs would not have received offers of admission in a race-neutral\nprocedure. Second, Hopwood and Carvell argue that, in contravention of the Fifth Circuit decision, Wellborn\nmade no attempt to reconstruct the actual admissions process used in 1992 to determine which nonminority\nresidents would have been offered admission under a constitutional system, nor did he devise a methodology\nrevolving around either the piles of thirty or the waiting list actually generated in 1992. Third, the plaintiffs criticize\nWellborn for making the assumption that all nonminority residents who were given offers of admission in 1992\nwould nevertheless have been admitted under a constitutional system. Fourth, Hopwood and Carvell argue that\nWellborn's testimony is insufficient to carry the defendants' burden as a matter of law because Wellborn relied on\n\"mere statistical likelihoods\" in concluding that the four plaintiffs would have been denied admission under a race-\nneutral system. The Court considers each objection seriatim.\nAs this Court recognized in Hopwood I, reconstructing the actual 1992 admissions procedure is a conceptually\ndifficult, if not \"virtually impossible,\" task: \"[T]he difficulty does not stem from the unconstitutional aspects of the\nprocedure alone but from the random shuffle of files into stacks of thirty, each stack reviewed by different\n890 subcommittees of three.\"[38]Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at *890 582 n. 86. Although the stacks were weighted as\nclosely as possible with the same number of high to low TI scores, see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 41, an applicant's\nchances for admission may in some instances have depended upon the personal tastes of the reviewers who\nevaluated the applicant's file and whether the applicant was placed in a stack with an unusually strong or weak\npool of applicants. To the extent that the plaintiffs argue that the admissions procedure used in 1992 was\ninherently unfair due to the random composition of the piles of thirty and the subjectivity of each reviewer, the\npoint is very well taken. It goes without saying, however, that this unfairness does not implicate a constitutional\ndefect with the law school's admissions procedures. To the extent that the plaintiffs argue that the law school can\nnever meet its burden for that reason, the point is not well taken. A particular applicant's admission to the law\nschool in 1992 was not the result of a random and unpredictable process 00 after all, applicants were not admitted\n97\nby a flip of a coin. And it is nonsense to suggest that all nonminorities who were denied admission in 1992 would\nhave an equal chance of admission under a race-blind procedure. With or without the law school's ill-advised\npiles-of-thirty approach, even a superficial comparison of the four plaintiffs, for instance, reveals the varying\nquality of students who applied to the law school in 1992 and confirms that concrete distinctions can be made\namong those applicants 00 if not to a virtual certainty, then at least by a preponderance of the evidence.\n97\nThe plaintiffs' argument that Wellborn should have reproduced an admissions procedure by which application\nfiles were randomly placed into piles of thirty and then reviewed by randomly formed screening committees is\nalso without merit. Wellborn is a very talented law professor, but he cannot turn back the hands of time, nor does\nthe Fifth Circuit decision require him to do so. Rather, the inquiry posed by the Fifth Circuit is whether any of the\nfour plaintiffs would have been admitted under \"a constitutional admissions system.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at\n957 (emphasis added). The Court, therefore, does not read the Fifth Circuit opinion as instructing the defendants\nto replicate exactly the 1992 admissions procedure or to use the 1992 piles-of-thirty approach. First, how would\none go about reproducing a random process? By the very definition of the word random, it cannot be done. The\nonly logical, reasonable, and fair way to determine who would have received offers of admission under a\nconstitutional system is to compare the application files of all of the admitted minorities and the denied\n[39]\nnonminorities, and that is precisely the methodology Wellborn used in his supplemental report.  Furthermore,\n891 using the 1992 piles of thirty would perpetuate the unconstitutional aspects of the 1992 admissions procedure. \n*891 The admissions procedure employed in 1992 was fraught with constitutional error precisely because the\noriginal piles of thirty did not include any minority applicants. Those piles would never exist under a constitutional\nadmissions system, and as a result, it would make no sense to use them now to determine whether any of the\nplaintiffs would have gained admission to the law school in 1992. The Court finds it more than a little baffling that\nthe plaintiffs assert Wellborn should have utilized, as the very premise of his methodology, the admissions system\nfound unconstitutional as a result of this lawsuit.\n\nLikewise, using the 1992 waiting list to determine who would have been admitted under a constitutional system is\nequally problematic. In support of this method, Hopwood and Carvell argue that the one vote they actually\nreceived in 1992 placing them on the waiting list is more probative than any subsequent attempt to reconstruct a\nhypothetical race-blind admissions process. While this method certainly has some intuitive appeal, it is not the\nbest way to determine which nonminority applicants would have gained admission in 1992 in a race-blind\nprocedure. First, there were two waiting lists in 1992, each of which was segregated by race. See Hopwood I,\n861 F.Supp. at 574 n. 68. Second, this methodology suffers from the same defect identified with respect to the\noriginal piles of thirty: the waiting list was generated by an unconstitutional system in which minority and\nnonminority applicants were reviewed separately. Therefore, the waiting list created in 1992 would not exist under\na constitutional admissions system. Third, due to the change in the LSAT scoring system, 1992 was somewhat of\nan anomaly in that the law school had not extended a sufficient number of offers through its normal procedures.\nAs a result, the admissions committee had to select an unusually high number of candidates 00 42 out of 123\n97\n[40]\napplicants 00 from the waiting list. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 52-53, 144. Wellborn testified that the waiting list had\n97\nbeen pretty well \"picked over\" and, consequently, the remaining eighty-one applicants on the waiting list had, in a\n[41]\nsense, a third \"no\" vote denying them admission. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 52-54. Fourth, using the waiting list\nto determine who would have gained admission is, in the Court's opinion, self-defeating for all of the plaintiffs: the\nmethodology would unfairly exclude Elliot and Rogers from consideration because they received no votes in\nscreening, and the one vote Carvell and Hopwood each received is not necessarily probative of any increased\nlikelihood that they would have been admitted in a race-blind procedure. Carvell's vote was from a student\nmember of the admissions committee, not a faculty member, see Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 566, and Hopwood's\nvote was essentially a \"sympathy vote\" from Hamilton, then the Assistant Dean of Admissions for the law school.\n[42]\n892 The plaintiffs also argue that Wellborn arbitrarily and impermissibly \"picks and *892 chooses\" among actual\nevents in 1992 in that he (1) gave no weight to applicants who were placed on the waiting list by virtue of their\none vote and (2) assumed that all nonminority applicants who were admitted in 1992 would have been admitted\nin a race-blind procedure. The plaintiffs urge the Court to disregard Wellborn's supplemental report entirely\nbecause, they argue, he did not reconsider all offers of admission in hypothesizing a constitutional admissions\nsystem. Not only is this argument unpersuasive, it mischaracterizes Wellborn's methodology. The plaintiffs\nacknowledge it was more difficult for nonminorities to achieve offers of admission in 1992; indeed, the plaintiffs\nbrought this lawsuit for that very reason. The fact that those nonminority applicants received offers of admission\nunder the University's admissions program is very strong evidence to support the inference that they would\nemerge as probable admittees under a race-neutral system. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 42. Wellborn did not,\ntherefore, arbitrarily pick and choose among real events in 1992; rather, he drew logical inferences based upon\nthe admissions procedure in force in 1992. The fact that an applicant was presumptively admitted, received two\nor three votes in the screening process, or was an applicant chosen from the waiting list in 1992 correlates with a\nstrong likelihood that the applicant would have been admitted in a race-blind admissions procedure; for the\nreasons indicated above, however, there is not a sufficiently strong correlation between receiving a position on\n[43]\nthe waiting list and an increased probability of admittance.  Therefore, the distinction between nonminority\nadmittees and waiting list candidates is warranted. Furthermore, it is conceptually difficult to see the harm in the\ninference 00 to the extent that these individuals were offered admission over the four plaintiffs, it certainly was not\n97\nthe result of any unlawful or invidious discrimination.\nFinally, the Court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that Wellborn relied on \"mere statistical likelihoods\" in concluding\nthat the four plaintiffs would have been denied admission. In support of this argument, the plaintiffs cite Smith v.\nRapid Transit, 317 Mass. 469, 470, 58 N.E.2d 754, 755 (1945), a case in which the Massachusetts Supreme\nCourt held it is insufficient as a matter of law to prove a proposition merely by showing the mathematical chances\nfavor the veracity of the proposition. This argument might have been valid had Wellborn conclusorily asserted, for\ninstance, that Carvell would not have been admitted to the law school based solely on the fact that his \"true\" TI\nscore of 191 or 192 correlated to a 5% to 15% probability of admission in 1992. But Wellborn did not use\nmathematical probabilities to prove Carvell would not have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional\nsystem. Instead, Wellborn evaluated Carvell's application according to certain enumerated and, to a large extent,\nquantifiable criteria, compared his application to the applications of 450 other denied nonminorities, and\n\nconcluded that Carvell was less qualified than the 119 applicants chosen for inclusion in his supplemental report. \nSee D-520. Based on the applications in evidence, as well as his knowledge of the law school's admissions\nprocedures, it was Wellborn's considered opinion that it was more likely than not that Carvell would not have\nbeen admitted to the law school under a race-neutral admissions system. Indeed, Wellborn reached the same\nconclusion with respect to the other three plaintiffs despite the fact that their relatively high TI scores correlated\nwith a probability of admittance of greater than 50%. This objection is nugatory.\nThe Court therefore concludes that the methodology Wellborn employed in his supplemental report is sound.\nWellborn did not attempt to handicap the chances of admission of each and every applicant who was denied\n893 admission to the law school in 1992. Rather, *893 Wellborn presented evidence of 119 applicants who were\nbetter candidates for the study of law than the plaintiffs and who were therefore more likely to receive offers of\nadmission under a constitutional system. In hypothesizing a constitutional admissions system, Wellborn made\nreasonable projections regarding the lowering of the presumptive admission and denial lines and the probable\nnumber of offers to be extended. His assumption that all nonminority resident admittees in 1992 would be\nadmitted under a race-neutral system is not only reasonable but supported by the record. Finally, Wellborn\nidentified reasonable criteria to evaluate the application files, and as discussed below, he applied the criteria in a\nfair, consistent, and nondiscriminatory way.\nB.\nBefore Wellborn's conclusions are explored and explained, the Court offers the following disclaimer. This opinion\nprovides more information than anyone ever needed or wanted to know about the qualifications required for\nadmission to the law school. The Court once again undertook a painstaking review of the application files of\nhundreds of students, and, unfortunately, this opinion reflects the tedious and arduous process that it was. One\nprinciple the Court emphasized in its first opinion bears repeating here:\n[T]he Court appreciates the difficulty of the task facing the admissions committee each year.\nEvaluation of applications involves both objective and subjective factors, and the Court is aware\nthat some evaluators could use subjectivity to conceal discriminatory motives. As a general rule,\nhowever, judges are not as well suited to evaluate qualifications of applications as those who are\nfamiliar with the process and have many years of experience evaluating applications.\nSee Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 581 (citing Odom v. Frank, 3 F.3d 839, 847 (5th Cir. 1993)).\nThe plaintiffs openly accused Wellborn of manipulating certain criteria and of disingenuously using the\nsubjectivity of the admissions process to rig the desired outcome of this case. The Court emphatically finds that\nallegation to be false. The fact that subjective criteria necessarily informed Wellborn's analysis does not render\nWellborn's opinions arbitrary or untenable. Part of Wellborn's everyday responsibilities as a law professor is to\nmake subjective assessments of students, whether on a law school exam or as a member of the admissions\ncommittee, and the Court will not cavalierly disregard the conclusions Wellborn reached in his supplemental\nreport simply because they involve subjective judgments. Furthermore, Wellborn credibly supported the\napplicants he selected, and the faculty members who originally reviewed the plaintiffs' files in 1992 universally\nsupport Wellborn's judgment that the four plaintiffs were weak candidates for admission to the law school in 1992.\nSee Johanson Declaration D-332; Declaration of Laquita Hamilton D-333; Sharlot Declaration D-334; Declaration\nof Mark Gergen D-335; Goode Declaration D-336.\nBefore delving into the specific weaknesses of each plaintiff's application, the Court makes the following\nobservations and generalizations. First, TI scores are, to a certain degree, inherently unreliable because they do\nnot weigh the student's GPA by major or quality of school. For example, Hopwood's GPA of 3.80, with her high\nnumber of hours from community colleges and subsequent transfer to a relatively weak undergraduate institution,\ndoes not compare favorably with a student having a lower GPA from, say, Rice, Trinity, the University of Texas, or\nTexas A & M. Wellborn's evaluation of Carvell's chances for admission also illustrates the artificial nature of the\nTexas Index. Although Carvell's \"true\" TI score was 191 or 192, Wellborn rated Carvell \"roughly comparable\" to\nHopwood, \"slightly better\" than Elliot, and \"significantly better\" than Rogers. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 117. Large\ninstitutions such as the University of Texas use TI scores to make general distinctions among the many students\n\nwho apply. But a TI score is only as good as its two components 00 the student's GPA and LSAT score. They are\n97\nnot hard-and-fast numbers determining who is admitted, nor should they be treated as such, because to do so\n894 would *894 unfairly reward students who attended weak undergraduate institutions or who took less-than-\nchallenging curricula. In light of the fact that TI scores are not weighted by quality of school or difficulty of major, it\nis not surprising that the plaintiffs' relatively high TI scores significantly overstate their chances for admission to\nthe law school and that Wellborn's selections ran the gamut from high to low TIs.\nSecond, the law school admissions process is incredibly competitive. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935. In fact, the\nCourt was astonished to discover the number of applicants with drastically better credentials than the four\nplaintiffs who were denied admission in 1992. For instance, of the 78 nonminority Group C applicants Wellborn\nselected, 31 were in the top quarter of their classes at competitive universities such as the University of Texas\nand Texas A & M and had LSAT scores in the 80th percentile and above. See D-543, 550-51, 555, 557, 560-63,\n565, 568, 570, 572-73, 576-77, 580, 582, 584-85, 587-89, 591-93, 599, 609, 611, 613, and 619. Over one third of\nWellborn's Group C selections had a college class rank in the 80th percentile or higher; unlike Hopwood,\nhowever, these applicants attended competitive schools and, except for one applicant, had few, if any, hours from\na community or junior college. See D-543, 551, 556, 558-60, 562, 564-68, 572, 574-76, 578-84, 609, and 611.\nApplicants similar to Carvell who had a class rank below the 70th percentile virtually all came from colleges with\nan LSAT mean of 34 or better such as Duke, Cornell, Rice, Tufts, and the University of Texas, and their LSAT\nscores in all cases were better 00 and in most cases were considerably better 00 than Carvell's combined LSAT\n97 97\nscore in the 76th percentile. See D-542, 544-45, 547-49, 552, 554, 569, 594-98, 602-03, 614-15, and 618.\nMoreover, of the 97 Group A and C applicants Wellborn predicted would have been probable admittees under a\nconstitutional system, only 2 graduated in the bottom half of their classes, as did Elliot. One applicant earned an\nLSAT score in the 99th percentile and graduated in the 31st percentile of the class at the University of California\nat Berkeley, a 36 LSAT mean college. See D-524. The other applicant attended the University of Texas, majored\nin a rigorous liberal arts honors program called Plan II, was in the 48th percentile of the class, and earned an\n[44]\nLSAT score in the 96th percentile. See D-529. Wellborn did not select a single applicant who, like Rogers, had\nbeen dismissed from a four-year university or who had graduated from a university with an LSAT college mean\nas low as that of the University of Houston-Downtown.\nThird, the applicants Wellborn selected for inclusion in Groups A, B, C, and D have superior credentials to the\nfour plaintiffs even when one looks exclusively at a combination of objective factors. After making his 119\nselections, Wellborn discovered that his selections tended to satisfy the following four criteria: each applicant (1)\nhad an LSAT score in the 80th percentile or higher; (2) had a rank in class in his or her university of at least the\n60th percentile; (3) graduated from a college with an LSAT mean of at least thirty; and (4) had no more than one\nyear in a community or junior college. None of the plaintiffs satisfies all four criteria, while the vast majority of\nWellborn's selections do. Moreover, applicants who did not comply with all four criteria counterbalanced that\nweakness with a specific strength. For instance, five applicants in Group C have LSAT scores in the 78th\npercentile, and three applicants in Group A and one applicant in Group D have LSAT scores in the 74th\npercentile. Across the board, however, these applicants had exceptionally strong college records at high quality\n895 institutions.[45]*895 Likewise, applicants with low class ranks offset that weakness with strong LSAT scores\n[46]\ncoupled with very competitive universities and/or particularly rigorous majors such as engineering.\nFourth, the inherently subjective nature of the admissions process does not, as the plaintiffs contend, provide a\nreason to believe that distinctions cannot be made among different applicants. Of course, reasonable minds can\nand do differ on the quality of particular institutions or courses of study. For instance, whether accounting is a\nmore rigorous major than political science, economics, or English is, to the Court's chagrin, an issue of raging\ndebate among the parties in this case. In the Court's opinion, all four courses of study provide a good background\nfor the study of law, and the Court, like Wellborn, tended to focus more on the overall quality of the applicant's\nundergraduate institution and curriculum in evaluating the application files. And, the plaintiff's protestations to the\ncontrary, Wellborn's opinion regarding the quality of certain universities is not entirely subjective. He supported\n[47]\nhis assessment of each institution with an objective criterion, the LSAT college mean. Cf. P-414 (discretionary\nzone screening instructions stating that \"[t]he LSAT college mean should be used as a general indicator of the\nstrength of the undergraduate institutions' student body\" and indicating that reviewers should \"`watch out' for\ninflated GPA's due to community or junior college grades\"). Even without such quantifiable data supporting his\n\nassessments, the Court is confident Wellborn can fairly evaluate the quality of colleges and universities around\nthe nation given his twenty-three years as a law professor and fifteen years on the admissions committee. In\naddition, Hopwood, Carvell, and Rogers do not appear to object to Wellborn's use of the LSAT college mean as a\nlegitimate means of distinguishing among universities or, significantly, to the resulting inference Wellborn draws\nthat the applicant's GPA is inflated. Instead, they argue that Wellborn exaggerates the importance of this criterion.\nThe Court finds that argument unpersuasive. One of Wellborn's constant themes throughout his testimony was\nthe notion that the applicant be exposed to a \"rigorous testing ground\" to prepare him or her for the study of law\nat an elite law school. See, e.g., Wellborn, vol. 1 at 84. The evidence establishes an applicant's undergraduate\ninstitution can be of paramount importance in determining admission, particularly when the student attended a\nvery weak school.\nOn the other hand, Hopwood and Carvell also criticize Wellborn for failing to give greater weight to or for\nunevenly evaluating subjective and nonacademic factors such as post-graduate work experience, good personal\n[48]\nstatements, and improvement in grades over time.  First, some of these factors, such as improvement in\ngrades and working through school, are \"very common,\" see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 68, and/or are generally not\n896 given much weight, see Goode Declaration, D-336.[49] Second, although these kinds of subjective *896 factors\ntended to support Wellborn's assessment of a particular applicant, see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 249, they did not\n[50]\nappear to impact Wellborn's selections significantly except in one unusual case. See D-538. Indeed, Wellborn\ntestified that, with respect to marginal candidates in particular, members of the admissions committee tend to\nfocus primarily on an applicant's balanced and consistent college performance and LSAT:\nIn general, I think we are talking here about the margin.... The unimpeachable candidates have\nalready been admitted. I'm not asserting that these files I've selected are without fault or without\nweaknesses. It's a matter of relative weaknesses ....\n[I]t's a question, I think, of minimizing risk that over my years on the committee what I see\nmembers doing at this margin is looking for belts and suspenders .... That's why I put the\nemphasis on some kind of balance here with the LSAT and the college score. Those are the two\nbiggest things .... [O]ur feeling is that especially in this middle zone where the LSAT and the\ncollege record kind of balance one another, they reinforce one another, it's a little more reassuring,\nand reassurance is what you are looking for. You're not going to get excited about these margin\ncandidates.\nWellborn, vol. 1 at 87-88.\nPart of the plaintiffs' strategy throughout the remand trial has been to find the files of a small handful of 1992\nadmittees who the law school faculty members opined were as qualified, or in a few instances, perhaps less\n[51]\nqualified for admission than the plaintiffs.  This evidence does not persuade the Court to disregard the\nconclusions Wellborn reached in his expert report or the assessments made by faculty members who originally\n[52]\nreviewed the plaintiffs' files in 1992. The fact that a small number of admittees  had credentials similar to or\nworse than the plaintiffs does not lead one to the conclusion that the plaintiffs would have been admitted in a\nrace-neutral process. At most, this evidence proves that the plaintiffs had some chance of admission, however\n897 slim, a proposition the law school has conceded all along.[53]See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 115. But *897 having\n\"some\" chance of admission does not correlate to having a reasonable chance, which is the inquiry required by\nthe burden of proof in this case. Moreover, the plaintiffs' argument rests on a fallacious premise. The plaintiffs\nhave identified the lowest common denominator and, after determining that the plaintiffs meet or exceed that\nstandard, have concluded that the plaintiffs would therefore have a reasonable chance of admission (or,\nconversely, that the defendants cannot prove that the plaintiffs do not have a reasonable chance of admission).\nThe comparison to be drawn, however, is not among individual applicants but among the entire applicant pool. It\nsimply does not follow that anyone on a par with the least qualified admittee would have a reasonable chance of\nadmission, and it certainly does not reflect the way in which the law school selects its entering classes. Frankly,\nthe Court draws quite the opposite inference 00 the fact that so few applicants comparable to the plaintiffs were\n97\nactually admitted in 1992 is evidence that the plaintiffs probably would not have been offered admission in a\nconstitutional process.\n\nFinally, each of the plaintiffs has one or more significant weaknesses in his or her application that are not\ncounterbalanced by a specific strength. Hopwood earned 70 of her undergraduate hours at community colleges. \nSee Johanson Declaration D-332 (indicating that community colleges tend to be \"noncompetitive institutions with\nacademically weak student bodies and faculties\"); Declaration of Elizabeth Chambliss, D-338 (indicating that less\nthan 1% of resident nonminorities admitted in 1992 had more than 70 hours of undergraduate education at a\ncommunity college or junior college). Hopwood required 6 years to complete her associate's degree, resulting in\nan average of 10 credit hours per year. See P-145 (LSDAS record); 1994 trial transcript, Johanson, vol. 5 at 15\n(stating that Hopwood earned her GPA on \"a fairly slow track\"). She subsequently obtained a bachelor's degree\nfrom a university that is uncompetitive with the universities attended by the vast majority of students who are\nadmitted to the law school. See Chambliss Declaration, D-338 (indicating that less than 2% of resident\nnonminorities admitted in 1992 graduated from schools with college LSAT mean scores of 28 or below).\nWellborn testified that Hopwood's LSAT score was acceptable for a marginal candidate. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at\n67. Likewise, Hopwood's non-academic strengths (her age, the fact that she was the mother of a handicapped\nchild, had worked her way through college, and later became a CPA) merit some \"preferential consideration.\" \nSee Sharlot Declaration D-334. However, according to Wellborn and the admissions committee members who\nreviewed Hopwood's application in 1992, these positive attributes ultimately do not outweigh the negative\naspects of her application, the most important factor of which is the weakness of her undergraduate education. \nSee Wellborn, vol. 1 at 67-68; Johanson Declaration D-332 (\"Her transcript shows not only that she attended\nweak schools, but that the bulk of her education was in technical `how-to' courses rather than academic courses\nrequiring analytic skills.... Hopwood is simply not well-prepared academically for Law School.\"); Hamilton\nDeclaration D-333 (stating that Hopwood's undergraduate record \"reflects little analytic preparation for law\nschool\"); Sharlot Declaration (concluding that Hopwood's file \"is very weak in comparison with the overwhelming\n[54]\ncredentials of so many of our applicants\").\nAs the Court noted in Hopwood I, there is little else to Hopwood's file. She provided no letters of\nrecommendation, no personal statement, and the handwritten application is among the least impressive in\n898 appearance of all of the files examined by the Court.[55]See*898Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 581; Johanson\nDeclaration D-332 (\"It is also striking to see no letters of recommendation, particularly for an older applicant who\nhas been out of school a while.\"). Wellborn summed up her application as follows:\nSo the overall picture here I think is one that would raise a lot of concern because we don't have a\ncandidate who has been tested at a highly competitive college environment as many, many of our\napplicants have. A lot of it is kind of like high school, frankly, community college, and so forth, and\nwe 00 of course, we all know from our own personal experience of the high school honor student\n97\nwho goes to the major state university and doesn't fair [sic] very well. It's a lot tougher. And, of\ncourse, we feel that the University of Texas Law School is a lot tougher still. So that would be a\nconcern here.\nWellborn, vol. 1 at 68.\nCarvell's \"true\" TI score of 191 or 192 placed him with the group of applicants who were presumptively denied\nadmission in 1992. Only approximately 5% of candidates with TI scores of 191 and 15% of candidates with TI\nscores of 192 were admitted to the law school in 1992; therefore, it is not surprising that Carvell was denied\nadmission, as he was among an overwhelming majority of applicants with the same TI score who were not\nadmitted. Although Carvell's personal statement was \"well-written,\" see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 127, Wellborn testified\nthat it did not compensate for the overall weakness of his application. Both Carvell's GPA of 3.28 and LSAT score\nin the 76th percentile were significantly below the 1992 overall GPA median of 3.52 and overall LSAT median in\nthe 89th percentile. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 563 n. 32; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 937 n. 7; see also Sharlot\nDeclaration D-334 (\"The most striking feature [of his file] is his undergraduate GPA at a school with an extremely\nlow mean LSAT score .... I am also struck by the fact that this relatively unimpressive performance was by a\ngraduate of what is reputedly one of the best public high schools in the state [Highland Park High School in\nDallas, Texas].\"); Gergen Declaration D-335 (characterizing Carvell as \"an easy no vote\" and indicating that his\nGPA was weak \"even at a school that I don't suspect is very demanding\"); Goode Declaration D-336 (\"Mr.\n\nCarvell's transcript reveals a mediocre academic record from a mediocre school .... If Mr. Carvell could not finish\nin the top two-fifths of his college class, what chance is there that he would perform well in a much more\ncompetitive environment?\").\nCarvell provided two faculty and two professional letters of recommendation, which one of his 1992 faculty\nreviewers described as \"strikingly weak.\" See Goode Declaration D-336. At the remand trial, Wellborn described\none of the faculty letters as \"not very strong\" and \"vague.\" See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 74. The other faculty letter by\nall accounts is downright negative, characterizing Carvell's classroom performance as disappointing, mediocre,\nand uneven. See P-151; Gergen Declaration D-335 (\"I also cannot help but be impressed by a rare honest letter\nof recommendation intimating that Mr. Carvell is either lazy or unfocused.\"); Goode Declaration D-336 (\"It is a\nletter that first damns with faint praise and then damns without faint praise. In this day of inflated grades and\nrecommendations, I would definitely take notice of such a tepid assessment of Mr. Carvell's performance as an\n899 undergraduate.\"). In addition, Carvell was denied admission *899 to Vanderbilt Law School, a school which was\ngenerally considered inferior to the University of Texas in terms of national reputation. Carvell was also denied\nadmission to the University of Texas Graduate School of Business, which is less competitive than the law school\nin terms of admissions, as well as Vanderbilt Business School. See Johanson Declaration D-332; Carvell, vol. 4\nat 112.\nElliot's weakness, according to Wellborn, was his lack of \"belts and suspenders,\" that is, his \"consistently weak\nundergraduate record.\" See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 82; Johanson Declaration D-332 (\"[I]t is preposterous to suggest\nthat the ... challenged affirmative action program was the cause of his [denial] .... Elliot is simply a weak\ncandidate.\"). Wellborn testified that this type of \"disparity\" candidate 00 an applicant with a high LSAT score and\n97\nlow GPA, or vice versa 00 is occasionally admitted, but only when the scores are high enough to place the\n97\nindividual in the presumptive admit zone. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 88. Under those circumstances, Wellborn\ntestified, \"there is a reason to take risks on [such] candidates.\" Wellborn, vol. 1 at 88. Elliot did not provide any\n[56]\nfaculty letters of recommendation,  leaving the committee members with no information about his college\nrecord except his \"rather unimpressive 40th percentile class rank.\" See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 81-82. Even Elliot\nhimself acknowledged his weak college record in his personal statement: \"I was an average student, studying\nwhen I needed to, partying more than I should, and not managing my time efficiently.... [My GPA] is not of a\ncaliber expected by the University of Texas School of Law.\" P-153. Furthermore, Elliot was denied admission to\nBaylor Law School, a school which is less competitive in terms of admission standards and, importantly, one that\ndid not operate a significant affirmative action program in 1992. See Johanson Declaration D-332.\nOne of the issues the Court decided in the first trial was whether Elliot had standing to sue the law school.\nFollowing Elliot's rejection by the law school in April 1992, Elliot's father sent a letter to Dean Yudof complaining\nthat the law school had rejected his son's application because of the law school's \"mandatory minority and\n[57]\nwomen quotas.\" See P-165 (copy of the letter sent by Elliot's father). It is undisputed that Elliot's application\nwas thereafter placed under reconsideration. Hamilton testified that the law school offered Elliot admission in\nAugust 1992, shortly before classes were to begin. The law school asserted at the first trial that Elliot lacked the\nstanding to sue because he declined his offer of admission. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 565-66. On remand,\nthe Fifth Circuit instructed the Court to reconsider its \"contradictory\" findings in Hopwood I that (1) Elliot was not\nnotified of his admission to the law school, and (2) Elliot would not have received an offer of admission even\nunder a constitutional system. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 n. 57.\nAs the Court indicated in Hopwood I, Hamilton was the only law school official to testify that Elliot was extended\nan offer of admission. Unlike other applicants who were admitted late in the process, there was no documentation\nin Elliot's file to substantiate Hamilton's claims, and Elliot testified at the first trial that he was unaware he had\nbeen offered either a place on the waiting list or admission to the law school. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at\n565-66. Indeed, Johanson testified at the first trial that \"it was `quite unusual' for someone to be reconsidered and\nplaced on the waiting list without [his] awareness of the decision.\" See id. at 566 & n. 44; 1994 trial transcript,\n900 Johanson, vol. 5 at 19. Furthermore, the Court found several discrepancies in Hamilton's trial testimony *900 and\naffidavit, which, in addition to the troubling lack of documentation, \"weigh[ed] in Elliot's favor\" in terms of\ndetermining whether Elliot had standing to sue the law school. See id. at 566. The Court therefore found in \nHopwood I that no offer of admission had been communicated to Elliot, that is, that no offer of admission had\n\n[58]\nbeen made.  Moreover, Elliot's application was only placed under reconsideration because of the letter sent by\nElliot's father. In a race-neutral world, the letter would not have received the special treatment that it did in 1992,\nand Elliot's application would not have been reconsidered. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 80-81.\nWellborn testified that Rogers's extremely weak college record prevented his admission to the law school despite\nhis relatively high LSAT score. Rogers earned a bachelor's degree in professional writing, a non-standard major,\nfrom the University of Houston-Downtown, a college with one of the lowest LSAT means Wellborn testified he has\n[59]\never seen. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 83. Rogers's cumulative GPA of 3.13 was significantly below the overall\n1992 GPA median of 3.52. Although Rogers also received a master's degree in professional writing from the\nUniversity of Southern California in 1992, one of the law school admissions committee members who reviewed\nhis file in 1992 described Rogers's performance there as \"decidedly unimpressive.\" See Gergen Declaration\nD-335. Prior to graduating from the University of Houston-Downtown, Rogers attended the University of Texas,\nwhere he was placed on scholastic probation once and flunked out twice over a period of three and a half years.\n[60]\n Wellborn concluded that Rogers was \"clearly\" the weakest of all of the applicants with a TI score of 197. \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 82. And, Rogers's assertions that he was a \"turnaround\" candidate to the contrary, Wellborn\ntestified:\n[T]his was not the picture of someone who just had a shaky start or one bad semester when they\nwere having trouble, but this was extended over a three and a half year period. Three strikes. And\nthat was his experience at a major institution.... [H]e did make high grades later on at his degree\nschool, but it's not as through he transferred to a school that would provide a rigorous testing\nground in our opinion.\nWellborn, vol. 1 at 84. In addition, Rogers provided no letters of recommendation and his answers to the\nquestions on the application form were brief and relatively uninformative. See P-171. Given Rogers's disastrous\nthree and a half years as an undergraduate at the University of Texas and his subsequent failure to distinguish\nhimself academically, the Court is convinced beyond any doubt that Rogers would never be admitted to the law\nschool under any circumstances.\n901 *901 The Court regrets having to discuss publicly and in such great detail the specific weaknesses in each of the\nplaintiffs' applications. It goes without saying that their applications do not reflect the sum of their existence as\nstudents or individuals. And even though the Court finds the plaintiffs were not denied admission to the law\nschool as a result of the unlawful use of racial preferences, the Court once again acknowledges \"the gravity of\nthe noneconomic injury to persons denied equal treatment.\" See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 583. On a final note,\nbeing denied admission to the University of Texas School of Law should not be the defining moment in any of\nthese plaintiffs' lives. At the risk of sounding trite, there are much greater tragedies in life. Each year the law\nschool denies admission to many bright, qualified, and deserving individuals simply because there are not\nenough spaces available in each entering class. The plaintiffs should not let their denial letters from 199200or this\n97\nlawsuit00continue to determine the course of their lives or prevent them from becoming successful lawyers if that\n97\nis a goal they still wish to pursue.\nIV.\nThe Court makes the following alternative findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding each of the plaintiffs'\ndamages to ensure there is no third trial and for the benefit of the circuit court. It should be emphasized, however,\nthat the Court made the following finding in the first trial: \"[H]ad the plaintiffs been entitled to damages, none of\nthem established monetary damages as required under the law and rules of this circuit\" because the evidence\npresented merely \"consisted of each plaintiff's testimony and speculation about the value of a law degree.\" \nHopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 583. It is beyond the intellectual skills of this Court to comprehend why the plaintiffs\nhave been given a second trial to present evidence regarding damages when they utterly failed to present\n[61]\ncompetent evidence on damages at the first trial.  Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit has instructed the Court to\nconsider new evidence on damages, including damages allegedly accrued since May 1994. See Hopwood II, 78\n\nF.3d at 957 (\"[T]he law school's inability to establish the plaintiff's non-admission ... opens a panoply of potential\n[62]\nrelief, depending in part upon what course that plaintiff's career has taken since trial in mid-1994.\")\nEach of the plaintiffs, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, has requested on order from this Court directing his or\n[63]\nher admission to the law school. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 177; Rogers, vol. 2 at 86; Elliot, vol. 3 at 268. To the\nextent the Fifth Circuit concludes the plaintiffs were denied admission as a result of the law school's\n902 unconstitutional admissions procedures, an injunction ordering the law school to admit Hopwood, *902 Elliot, and\nRogers would be the most appropriate and equitable remedy the Court could fashion. The remaining issues,\ntherefore, are (1) whether Hopwood, Elliot, and Rogers have proved any economic damages for lost earnings in\ntheir second trial; (2) whether Carvell has established any economic damages; and (3) whether Hopwood and\n[64]\nCarvell have established any damages for mental anguish.  The plaintiffs must prove their damages by a\npreponderance of the evidence, and damages which are too speculative, remote, or conjectural cannot be\nawarded. Collectively, the plaintiffs request over five million dollars in compensatory damages, three million\ndollars of which is sought for emotional injuries. This figure is exponentially higher than the requests for damages\nmade at the May 1994 trial. See 1994 trial transcript, T. Smith, vol. 26 at 40 (counsel for plaintiffs explaining to the\n[65]\nCourt in closing arguments that the plaintiffs' damages \"are not great\").\nHopwood, Elliot, and Rogers request damages for loss of future income resulting from the delay in their legal\neducation. The defendants contend these so-called \"front pay\" damages are not available in nonemployment\n[66]\ncases, in part because they are not foreseeable by educational institutions.  They argue that the law school, in\nrejecting thousands of applicants each year, does not foresee that denied applicants will forego their law school\nplans entirely but merely that they will have to attend law school elsewhere. While the foreseeability of a plaintiff's\n[67]\ninjury is irrelevant in the context of intentional torts,  the argument raises two related points. The first point\nrelates to the remote and speculative nature of the plaintiffs' injuries. The Court emphatically rejects the notion\nthat the defendants' actions prevented Hopwood, Elliot, and Rogers from becoming lawyers. At most, the law\nschool prevented the plaintiffs from obtaining a law degree from the University of Texas. Many rejected\napplicants00Carvell, for instance00successfully attend other law schools. The second point pertains to a plaintiff's\n97 97\nability to prove front pay damages in a Title VI case. As a practical matter, front pay damages may simply be too\nspeculative or attenuated given the injury in this case00the denial of a seat in law school. Hopwood, Elliot, and\n97\nRogers have the burden of establishing they would have successfully graduated from the University of Texas and\nattained full-time employment as lawyers. To the extent this case is remanded for damages, the Fifth Circuit\nimplicitly rejected the argument that front pay damages are always improper under Title VI or too speculative as a\nmatter of law. But in determining whether a front pay award is appropriate in this case, the Court must grapple\nwith the inherently speculative nature of the plaintiffs' damages00particularly when, as in the case of Hopwood\n97\nand Carvell, the requests for damages extend forty years into the future. With these two thoughts in mind, the\nCourt now turns to each plaintiff's request for damages.\nA.\nHopwood contends she suffered economic damages in the amount of $1,360,000, which she claims is the\nprojected career earnings differential between an accountant, her current profession, and an attorney. See P-477.\n903 Hopwood additionally seeks $1,500,000 in emotional distress damages she claims resulted *903 from her denial\nof admission to the law school. See P-459.\n(1) Damages for Loss of Future Income\nHopwood is not entitled to any monetary damages for the alleged loss of future income as an attorney. The Court\nfails to find from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood would have completed her law degree by\nJanuary 1996: she would not have graduated from law school due to a series of personal tragedies occurring\nfrom 1992 to 1996, the time period during which she would have been attending law school. Hopwood\ncontemplated limited enrollment at the law school before she applied for admission in 1992. In a letter attached to\nher application to the law school, Hopwood sought information regarding reduced participation so that she could\n\ncontinue to care for her severely handicapped daughter Tara while attending law school. See Hopwood, vol. 1 at\n132-33. Hopwood testified at trial that Tara \"required a substantial amount of energy and time, and had a large\nnumber of doctors appointments and hospital visits [and] surgeries.\" See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 239. Furthermore,\nHopwood's husband was in the military and traveled extensively, see Hopwood, vol. 2 at 239, during which time\nHopwood was Tara's primary caretaker. In addition, Hopwood was living in San Antonio, Texas at the time and\nwould have been commuting to the law school seventy miles each way for three years.\nHopwood became pregnant with her second daughter Erica in August 1992, immediately before the start of the\nlaw school Fall semester. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 221. During what would have been the end of Hopwood's first\nyear in law school, Erica was born. Erica passed away on May 18, 1993, the day following her birth. See\nHopwood, vol. 2 at 221. Hopwood continued as Tara's primary caretaker and began experiencing marital\ndifficulties due to the stress and depression related to the impending death of Tara and to the demands Hopwood\nplaced on her husband to move away from Texas. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170-71, 222-23. In June 1995,\nHopwood and her husband separated, presumably leaving Hopwood as Tara's sole caretaker. On November 23,\n1995, Tara passed away. Hopwood, vol. 2 at 176. In February 1996, Hopwood relocated from San Antonio, Texas\nto Columbia, Maryland, and her husband moved to Korea. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 222-23.\nHopwood's limited employment during this time reflects the toll these events took on her professional life.\nHopwood was unemployed from June 1991 to January 1993. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 229. From January 1993 to\nMay 1995, Hopwood worked on a part-time basis as a CPA for a sole proprietorship in San Antonio; although she\nworked full-time during tax season, she was able to do so only because she frequently worked out of her home. \nSee Hopwood, vol. 2 at 230-31, 240. In anticipation of her move to Maryland, Hopwood was not employed from\nMay 1995 to February 1996. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 232. From February 1996 to May 1996, Hopwood worked\nas an accountant for a temporary agency, and for most of the remainder of the year she was unemployed. In\nJanuary 1997, Hopwood received her first full-time employment as a CPA since mid-1991. See Hopwood, vol. 2\nat 228, 233-34. Hopwood testified that she could have worked full time as a CPA during these years, but she\nchoose not to do so in part because she knew she had a limited amount of time with her daughter Tara. See\nHopwood, vol. 2 at 240.\nThe Court is not suggesting that women with families or severely handicapped children are incapable of\nsuccessfully pursuing a law degree or that individuals who suffer tremendous personal tragedies lack the will or\nability to accomplish their goals. However, in this case the facts are clear: Hopwood was facing many serious\nobstacles, as well as enormous time constraints, that would have undermined her ability to earn a law degree\nduring the 1992 to 1996 time frame. It would have been virtually impossible for anyone 00female or male00to\n97 97\ncomplete a law degree traveling 150 miles per school day to a highly competitive environment such as the\n904 University of Texas while undergoing similar *904 strains in his or her personal life.[68] Supporting the Court's\nfinding that Hopwood would not have graduated from law school is her own testimony. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at\n172 (testifying that \"Tara died unexpectedly ... I didn't feel I was mentally or emotionally ready to handle what I\nknow is a very difficult coarse [sic] load in the law program\"); Hopwood, vol. 2 at 175-76 (testifying that she has\nhad a \"sporadic work history\" since Tara's death). Hopwood's previous academic performance supports the\nCourt's conclusion as well. It took Hopwood eight years (instead of four) to earn her undergraduate degree\nbecause difficult financial circumstances forced her to spend much of her time working. In addition, although\nHopwood repeatedly refers to earning a law degree as a lifelong dream, she has not demonstrated her\ncommitment to that goal by seeking admission to any law school following her rejection from the University of\nTexas in 1992. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 172.\nEven assuming Hopwood would have completed her law degree, the evidence she proffered to prove economic\ndamages did not reasonably predict any loss in earnings she may have suffered as a result of her denial of\nadmission to the law school. Hopwood's first expert witness regarding her economic damages was economist\nWayne E. Ruhter, Ph.D. Ruhter performed two analyses, \"Analysis I\" and \"Analysis III,\" to determine the career\nearnings differential between attorneys and accountants. See P-477. In Analysis I, Ruhter compared attorney\n[69]\nsalaries in the private sector in Texas and the mid-Atlantic region with accountant salaries in Philadelphia. See\nP-477, Exhibit I, Tab 3, Analysis 1-Table 3. Ruhter assumes Hopwood would progress from associate to\npartnership level in both career paths. In Analysis III, he utilized 1990 Census data, which did not reflect any\n\nparticular career path or geographic location, to determine the difference in career earnings between female\nattorneys and female accountants. See P-477, Exhibit III, Tab 3, Analysis 3-Table 3. In both Analysis I and III,\nRuhter assumed Hopwood would have graduated from law school, passed the bar exam, attained full-time\nemployment by January 1996, and continued working until she reached age 75 in the year 2037. Subtracting the\ncosts of attending law school, Ruhter concluded the present value of Hopwood's economic damages to be\n$424,604 in Analysis I and between $400,364 and $416,876 in Analysis III. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 258, 265-66.\nFinally, Ruhter concluded in Analysis II that Hopwood could not have mitigated her damages by enrolling in law\n[70]\nschool in 1997. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 272.\nIn the Court's opinion, Ruhter's expert report was riddled with so many untenable premises, logical\ninconsistencies, and unreliable and inappropriate sources that it cannot support an award of economic damages.\nBy Ruhter's own admission, his expert report is merely \"an evaluation of two career paths\" that examines the\npotential career earnings that are \"available\" to Hopwood as an attorney and an accountant. Ruhter, vol. 2 at 253,\nvol. 3 at 48, 53. Ruhter unequivocally stated that he did not specifically attempt to \"forecast\" Hopwood's losses. \nRuhter, vol. 3 at 71. Furthermore, prior to preparing his expert report, Ruhter did not interview Hopwood or her\ncurrent employer or obtain enough information about Hopwood to predict her future earnings capacity to any\nreasonable degree of certainty. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 45, 48-49. It is from this initial, misguided premise that all\n905 other errors in his report flow. Some, but by no *905 means all, of the more glaring problems are described below.\nFirst consider Analysis I. The accountant career path does not reasonably predict Hopwood's future earnings.\nRuhter uses salary information from Philadelphia to predict future earnings (even for 1997) instead of reasonably\npredicting earnings from her current employment in Columbia, Maryland. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 53. Similarly, the\nattorney career path is implausibly optimistic, resulting in wildly inflated future earnings. Ruhter assumes\nHopwood would (1) become a partner (2) in eight years (3) in a private law firm (4) in a large city in Texas or the\nmid-Atlantic region. That particular career path is one of the most lucrative a lawyer can take and is extremely\ndifficult and rare. See D-513, Report of Stephen Mims; Ruhter, vol. 3 at 48-49 (recognizing that salaries for\nprivate law firm practice are generally higher than for government, corporate, or public interest practice); Mims,\nvol. 3 at 236 (stating that approximately less than 9% of University of Texas law graduates from the class of 1987\nare partners at large law firms by the year 1996). Furthermore, because empirical information related to\n[71]\npartnership buy-ins was unavailable, those costs are not reflected in Analysis I. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 268-69.\nThe Court also questions the use of the David J. White Survey as an appropriate source to project the growth\nrate of attorney salaries. See D-684, Tab 17 (indicating the survey does not ensure that the same law firms\nrespond to the survey each year it is given).\nThe most compelling reason to discount Analysis I, however, is its logical inconsistency. Hopwood graduated with\nan accounting degree in 1988 and earned her CPA license in 1991. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 140-41. Ruhter does\nnot begin to measure Hopwood's earnings capacity as an accountant, however, until 1997. Prior to 1997, Ruhter\nuses Hopwood's actual earnings, which, due to her personal circumstances, were low. See P-483. Had Ruhter\nproperly measured Hopwood's earnings capacity as a CPA starting in 1992, his own methodology reflects that\nshe would have earned more money over her lifetime by continuing to work as an accountant as opposed to\nenrolling in law school in 1992. See D-508, Report of James R. Vinson, Ph.D., Table I (indicating that Hopwood's\ncareer earnings as a CPA would have exceeded her attorney career earnings by $31,412); see also Ruhter, vol. 2\nat 271 (acknowledging that there is an opportunity cost associated with a delay in education). If, as Ruhter\ntestified, Analysis I was intended to be a hypothetical comparison of the lifetime earnings available to Hopwood\nas an accountant and as a lawyer, the analysis should have accounted for Hopwood's ability to earn as an\naccountant since the time she earned her degree in 1988 or, at the very latest, since she obtained her CPA\nlicense in 1991.\nThe chief problem with Analysis III is the unreliability and inappropriateness of the Census data which serves as\nthe source for Ruhter's conclusions. The salary information reflected in the data is self-reported by employees.\nSelf-reporting does not, in and of itself, necessarily render the data inaccurate, but in this case there are other\nindicia of unreliability. First, some of the data is implausible on its face. For instance, the Census includes salary\ninformation on individuals with less than a high school education who claim to be lawyers. See P-477, Exhibit III,\nTab 11. Second, the Census significantly undervalues Hopwood's future earnings potential as an accountant\n\nbecause the data pertaining to accountant salaries includes information for bookkeepers and accountants who,\nunlike Hopwood, have not obtained a CPA license. See Ruhter, vol 3 at 44-45, 94-95. Unrelated to the problem of\nself-reporting is the fact that salary information is categorized by age and, consequently, years of experience.\nWhile the average age of a female law graduate is twenty-six, Hopwood would have been thirty-four had she\n906 graduated from the law school in 1995. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 266. Ruhter overstates Hopwood's *906 earnings\npotential as a lawyer because the Census data he uses in Analysis III compares Hopwood to females who, as a\nresult of their additional eight years of experience, would undoubtedly have higher earnings than Hopwood. See\nP-477, Exhibit III, Tab 11. Ruhter belatedly recognized this problem and performed Alternative Analysis III, in\nwhich he replaces the Census data related to lawyer salaries for the years 1995 to 2000 with data from the David\nJ. White Survey. This approach is perhaps even more flawed because it improperly compares two sources of\ndata for attorney salaries (five years of data from the David J. White Survey and thirty-five years of data from the\nCensus) and only one source of data for accountant salaries (forty years of data from the Census). As Ruhter\nhimself acknowledged, as a general rule it is inappropriate to use different sources of information in a\ncomparative study because doing so can create a bias in the results. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 56.\nThe remaining $900,000 Hopwood claims in economic damages is based on the testimony of Bradford W.\nHildebrandt. Hildebrandt is chairman of Hildebrandt, Inc., a management consultant and placement firm related to\nthe legal profession. See D-501 (Hildebrandt's Report). Hildebrandt is not an economist and did not perform an\nindependent study of Hopwood's economic losses. See Hildebrandt, vol. 3 at 106. Instead, he reviewed the\naccuracy of the attorney compensation figures in the private sector as reflected in Ruhter's Analysis I. Hildebrandt\ntestified that Ruhter's figures, which project an average annual partner salary of $219,699, undervalue\npartnership compensation for University of Texas graduates by approximately $100,000 per year. See\nHildebrandt, vol. 3 at 107. The Court rejects Hildebrandt's testimony for two reasons. First, Hildebrandt's\ntestimony was wholly dependent upon the accuracy of Ruhter's Analysis I, which the Court has already found\nunpersuasive. Second, his testimony was inapposite to Hopwood's case. It is sheer speculation whether\nHopwood would have completed law school, much less whether she would have had an academic record\nsufficient to result in her recruitment by a private law firm, whether she would have remained at that law firm for\neight years, and whether she would have been selected as a partner in that law firm. In short, Hopwood has\nfailed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she has suffered the economic damages alleged as a\nresult of being denied admission to the law school.\n(2) Mental Anguish Damages\nNeither the Supreme Court nor the Fifth Circuit has specifically held that mental anguish damages are\nrecoverable in a suit brought pursuant to Title VI. Although a majority of the Supreme Court in Guardians\nAssociation v. Civil Service Commission of City of New York, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866\n(1983), would allow a plaintiff to recover compensatory damages for intentional violations of Title VI, the Supreme\nCourt did not definitively describe the scope of such remedies under the statute. See Shinault v. American\nAirlines, Inc., 936 F.2d 796, 803 (5th Cir.1991) (quoting Guardians for the proposition that damage remedies\nunder Spending Clause statutes such as Title VI may be limited). The lower federal courts have been grappling\nwith the issue since Guardians, and the law in this area is therefore somewhat muddled. See, e.g., Eastman v.\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute, 939 F.2d 204, 208 (4th Cir.1991) (concluding that compensatory damages for pain\nand suffering are not available under Title VI and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29\nU.S.C. § 794 (West 1994), which forbids discrimination on the basis of disability).\nIn Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 71, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 1035, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992),\nthe Supreme Court held that \"federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief\" under Title IX, a\n[72]\nstatute that was patterned after Title VI.  Since Franklin, the strong trend among federal courts is to allow\n907 plaintiffs to recover for mental injuries under Title VI and similar *907 federal anti-discrimination statutes. See \nRodgers v. Magnet Cove Public Schools, 34 F.3d 642, 644 (8th Cir.1994) (holding that \"the full spectrum\" of legal\nand equitable remedies are available under Title VI and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); Waldrop v.\nSouthern Co. Serv., Inc., 24 F.3d 152, 156-157 (11th Cir.1994) (citing Franklin for the holding that the full panoply\nof legal remedies are available under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act); Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ.,\n\n13 F.3d 823, 830 (4th Cir.1994) (overruling Eastman in light of Franklin). In any event, this issue is a question of\nlaw that is better left to the Fifth Circuit should the panel deem it proper to reach the issue of damages. The Court\nmerely assumes for purposes of this order that mental anguish damages are recoverable under Title VI.\nTo the extent the Court fails to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood would have completed her\nlaw degree, the defendants are not liable for any mental anguish damages because there is no causal connection\nbetween the harm and the violation. See, e.g., Patterson v. P.H.P Healthcare Corp., 90 F.3d 927, 938 (5th Cir.\n1996) (asserting the general principle that there must a causal connection between the injury and any award for\ndamages). Even assuming Hopwood would have earned a degree from the law school, several of Hopwood's\nclaims for emotional injury are not compensable because they are not the result of the defendants' conduct. For\nexample, claims for damages related to Hopwood's allegation that the defendants falsely maligned her\nqualifications in the media pertain to the litigation she initiated and the justifiable defense of this case and\n[73]\ntherefore are not recoverable. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 187-90 (describing her voluntary media appearances\nand interviews). Other claims for damages, such as her contention that the law school's discrimination was a\nfactor that caused her to begin smoking, are frivolous and do not merit discussion.\nHopwood testified she experienced frustration, depression, disappointment, diminished self-confidence, and\nanger as a result of being denied admission to the law school. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170. In her interrogatory\nresponses, Hopwood also claims feelings of hopelessness, confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, inability to\nconcentrate, indecisiveness, inadequacy, and stigmatization. See P-459; P-464. Finally, she contends her\nrejection by the law school indirectly strained her marriage. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170-71; P-470 (deposition\ntestimony of friend confirming these feelings). Hopwood testified she did not experience any physical symptoms\nor pain, nor did she seek any psychiatric or medical care, as a result of being denied admission, although she did\noccasionally discuss the situation with a therapist from whom she had sought grief counseling following Erica's\ndeath. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 217-18.\nIn addition to Hopwood's testimony, the Court heard corroborating evidence regarding the nature and extent of\nher emotional injuries from Paul Lees-Haley, Ph.D. Lees-Haley is a forensic psychologist, not a mental health\nprovider, and has never treated Hopwood for any mental injury. Rather, Lees-Haley evaluated Hopwood based\nupon her self-reported complaints to determine whether Hopwood suffered any emotional injury as a result of the\ndefendants' actions. See P-526 (Expert Report); Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 153. Lees-Haley testified that Hopwood\nsuffered some emotional distress from three independent sources: (1) the law school's discrimination against her,\n(2) the law school's rejection of her application for admission, and (3) public comments made by the law school\nand her interactions with lawyers in the case. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 152.\nLees-Haley diagnosed Hopwood with chronic \"adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,\"\n908 which he believes occurred partly in response to the \"stressor\"[74] of being denied admission and of *908 being a\nvictim of discrimination. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 155-56. He states in his report that adjustment disorder\n\"typically resolves within six months unless the symptoms are in response to ... a stressor that has enduring\nconsequences,\" such as Hopwood's rejection from the law school. P-526. Lees-Haley also testified that the law\nschool's actions aggravated other mental injuries, such as those resulting from the deaths of her children, the\nbreak-up of her marriage, and the loss of a job. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 152; P-526 (\"[Hopwood] plausibly\nsuggests that had she been accepted to law school, some of the other problems and their effects might have\nbeen mitigated to some degree ... because at least she would not have had the feeling she had lost all of her\ndreams at once.\"). On the other hand, Lees-Haley testified that the law school's actions \"might have caused\nsome mild disability in the sense of making it harder for her to concentrate,\" but that they have not caused\nHopwood any \"permanent\" problems that will cause her \"pain and suffering and disability ... for the rest of her\nlife.\" Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 154; vol. 3 at 209-11 (indicating that Hopwood is not suffering from any disability and is\nfully functional). Moreover, he opined that Hopwood would not have had a diagnosable mental condition were it\nnot for other negative \"stressors\" in her life. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 220-21.\nHopwood has had more than her share of tragedies, both before and after she was denied admission to the law\nschool, all of which have caused her severe emotional distress. Without doubt, the evidence establishes the least\ntraumatic \"stressor\" in her life was the law school's denial of her application. However, because of the unusual\ncircumstances occurring in Hopwood's personal life from 1992 through 1996 and her mental condition, the Court\n\nwould find from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood has suffered mental anguish damages as a\nresult of the law school's rejection of her application. The denial of admission aggravated Hopwood's preexisting\nemotional injuries beyond the mere hurt feelings, frustration, and anger that are a part of everyday life. See \nPatterson, 90 F.3d at 940. Accordingly, the Court would find from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood\nhas sustained mental anguish damages in the amount of $6,000 as a result of the law school's rejection of her\napplication for admission.\nB.\nCarvell is the only plaintiff who pursued a law degree in 1992 after his rejection from the law school. Carvell\ngraduated with a joint degree in law and a master's in business administration from Southern Methodist\nUniversity (\"SMU\") in 1996. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 101. Since August 1996, he has been employed as an attorney\n[75]\nwith the private law firm of Bickel & Brewer in Dallas, Texas,  where he was earning a starting salary of\n$50,000 plus benefits at the time of trial (Carvell has since earned a pay increase). See Carvell, vol. 4 at 105-06,\n114-15. Carvell seeks total economic damages in the amount of $705,886, consisting of $40,036 in increased\ntuition for attending SMU and $668,850 in damages resulting from the diminished value of an SMU law degree.\n[76]\n See P-478. Additionally, Carvell seeks $1,500,000 in mental anguish damages resulting from the law\nschool's discrimination against him and the denial of his application for admission. See P-460.\n(1) Tuition Differential\nCarvell would have attended the University of Texas over SMU Law School had he been admitted to the law\n909 school in *909 1992. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 98; 1994 trial transcript, Carvell, vol. 10 at 9. Accordingly, the Court\nfinds from a preponderance of the evidence the difference in the cost of tuition between the two schools was\n$40,036. See P-478, Exhibit 2, Table 2; Ruhter, vol. 3 at 4.\n(2) Damages for Loss of Future Income\nRuhter calculated the diminished value of Carvell's degree by comparing the difference in earnings hypothetically\navailable to University of Texas and SMU law graduates based upon the average starting associate salaries of all\nprivate law firms that recruited at those two schools in 1995, regardless of whether those firms actually hired\ngraduates of those two law schools that year. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 3; P-478, Exhibit 3, Table 3. Ruhter did not\nidentify any salary differential at the partnership level because he was unaware of any empirical information\navailable to calculate it; therefore, Ruhter analyzed Carvell's alleged lost earnings only as an associate until the\nyear 2003. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 80-81; P-478, Exhibit 3, Table 3. Ruhter testified that the present value of the\nearnings differential was $11,850. Ruhter, vol. 3 at 4. Hildebrandt reviewed the accuracy of the figures contained\nin Ruhter's report. He testified that Ruhter underestimated Carvell's losses by not carefully analyzing \"the weight\nof the law schools\" and by not including any damages for the differential in partnership compensation between\ngraduates of SMU and the law school. Hildebrandt testified these damages were approximately $50,000 per year,\nfor a total of $654,000. Hildebrandt, vol. 3 at 110-11.\nThe Court fails to find from a preponderance of the evidence that Carvell is entitled to any damages for loss of\nfuture income; indeed, his requests for economic damages are counterfactual. First, Carvell did not use the\nCareer Services office at SMU to obtain any employment. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 122. Consequently, a\ncomparative analysis of the average starting salaries of law firms that recruit at the University of Texas and SMU\nprovides an inappropriate basis for measuring damages in Carvell's case. Second, Ruhter calculates Carvell's\nlost earnings beginning in mid-1995 even though Carvell did not graduate from law school until May 1996. See\nCarvell, vol. 2 at 122. Third, the \"opportunity\" differential between SMU and the University of Texas is due in large\npart to the high starting salaries of national firms and regional boutiques which tend to recruit more heavily at the\nUniversity of Texas. In general, these firms only hire top-tier students with very strong academic records. See\nJones, vol. 4 at 82-84. Carvell, however, graduated in the third quarter of his class at SMU; therefore, these\nhigher earnings probably would not have been available to Carvell because he would not have had an academic\n\nrecord at the University of Texas sufficient to result in recruitment by those firms. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 114.\nFourth, in requesting $654,000 for the differential in partnership compensation, Carvell apparently overlooked the\n[77]\nsalient fact that he is not on partnership track at Bickel & Brewer. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 106.\nCarvell proffered speculative evidence that he has suffered lost earnings as a result of not obtaining his degree\nfrom the law school. In fact, the evidence suggests Carvell has suffered no loss in earnings: Carvell's starting\nsalary is higher than the average starting salary for graduates of the University of Texas in 1995. See D-685, Tab\n4 (indicating that the average starting salary for 1995 University of Texas graduates was $49,761); D-685, Tab 8\n(indicating that the average starting salary for 1995 SMU graduates was $51,464). Even assuming an earnings\ndifferential exists and that it can be quantified to a reasonable degree of certainty00a notion the Court seriously\n97\ndoubts00the statistics regarding average starting salaries in private, government, corporate, and public interest\n97\npractice suggest the differential actually favors SMU graduates. See D-685, Tab 4 & 8. Moreover, Carvell\n910 proffered no evidence that private law firms distinguish among lawyers, in terms of salary and/or benefits, on the \n*910 basis of where they obtained their law degree. True, graduates of highly regarded universities tend to have\nenhanced career opportunities over graduates of universities that are not as highly regarded. But, in the Court's\nopinion, the ability of an individual to succeed in his or her profession depends much more upon the value of that\n[78]\nindividual rather than the value of his or her degree.\n(3) Mental Anguish Damages\nCarvell testified he experienced disappointment, anxiety, stress, shock, frustration, and anger and that he\nbecame withdrawn from others as a result of his denial of admission to the law school. See Carvell, vol. 4 at\n98-101; P-472 (deposition testimony of friend confirming these feelings). In his interrogatory responses, Carvell\nalso indicated he suffered feelings of confusion, depression, embarrassment, inability to concentrate, lack of\nmotivation, indecisiveness, diminished confidence, inadequacy, stigmatization, and diminished self-esteem. See\nP-460; P-465. On the other hand, he testified he was not \"shattered or crippled\" by the experience and that he is\nfunctioning well at his current employment. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 101. Moreover, Carvell never sought psychiatric\nor medical treatment for any emotional injuries caused by the defendants' conduct, even though he has suffered\nfrom \"very serious and substantial mental health problems in the past.\" Carvell, vol. 4 at 101, 119-20; Carvell\nStipulation 1.\nAs with Hopwood, Lees-Haley evaluated Carvell's self-reported complaints to determine the nature and extent of\nhis emotional injuries resulting from the defendants' actions. Lees-Haley stated in his expert report that \"Carvell\nappears to have a chronic, mild depression that pre-existed this injury and continues to the present, which was \ntemporarily mildly aggravated by not being admitted to the University of Texas School of Law and by discovering\nthat he was the subject of race discrimination.\" See P-527 (emphasis added). The Court does not find from a\npreponderance of the evidence that the denial of admission caused Carvell any compensable emotional injuries,\neither by themselves or resulting from the alleged temporary aggravation of his preexisting depression. The\ndenial, at most, resulted in the mere hurt feelings, frustration, and anger that are simply a part of everyday life.\nC.\nElliot seeks $56,021 in lost earnings he contends resulted from his delayed entry into the workforce as a lawyer\nduring the pendency of this lawsuit. He arrived at this figure by calculating the five-year differential, adjusted for\ninflation and discounted to present value, between his current salary as a CPA and the average starting salary of\n1995 graduates of the law school. The Court does not find from a preponderance of the evidence that Elliot has\nsuffered any loss in earnings as an attorney that can be reasonably attributed to his rejection by the law school.\nElliot declined an offer of admission to attend Texas Tech Law School in 1992. See Elliot, vol. 3 at 273. Therefore,\nthe delay in his legal education resulted not from the law school's admissions procedures but from Elliot's\ndeliberate choice not to attend Texas Tech. Furthermore, separate from the issue of the remoteness of the injury\nis the issue of whether Elliot has mitigated his damages. Elliot could have attended Texas Tech in 1992 or he\ncould have applied to other law schools within the last five years. The damages Elliot seeks are also speculative\nand remote.\n\nD.\nRogers seeks compensatory damages of $332,867.94 plus one third of any amount awarded in attorneys' fees.\n911 [79]See D-660, Exhibit A. Rogers claims approximately *911 $200,000 in lost wages as a lawyer during the\npendency of the lawsuit; roughly half the lost earnings he claims are losses he sustained in unpaid loans he\n[80]\nmade to his business.  In addition, Rogers seeks $200 for the cost of reapplying to the law school, $795 to\nattend a Princeton Review LSAT course, $950 in costs to move back to Austin in the event the Court orders an\ninjunction, a minority scholarship in the amount of $20,000 plus tuition for three years, and $909.24 in expenses\nfor voluntarily attending a conference on affirmative action in California. The Court does not find from a\npreponderance of the evidence that Rogers has sustained any economic damages as a result of his rejection by\nthe law school. The reasons are essentially the same for which the Court denied Elliot's request for damages00the\n97\ndamages alleged are not attributable to the defendants' conduct and are speculative and remote. Rogers\ndeclined an offer to attend the University of Houston School of Law in 1992. See Rogers, vol. 2 at 100. The\nremaining requests for damages (those that do not relate to Rogers's request for lost earnings) are frivolous and\ndo not merit discussion.\nV.\nTitle 42 of the United States Code, Section 1988, provides that a court \"in its discretion, may allow the prevailing\nparty, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" The Court denied the\nplaintiffs' original requests for fees and expenses following the May 1994 trial, concluding that the plaintiffs,\nalthough prevailing parties under statute, only attained de minimis relief. The plaintiffs separately appealed that\njudgment on January 9, 1995. On July 26, 1996, the Fifth Circuit granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the\nCourt's judgment on attorneys' fees and remanded the case with an instruction to reconsider whether the fees\nand expenses requested at the trial and appellate levels were reasonable and necessary for the prosecution of\nthis case. The plaintiffs' attorneys purportedly spent 7,241.41 hours litigating this case, and the fees and\nexpenses sought exceed $1.5 million.\nAt the May 1994 trial, the plaintiffs were represented by (1) Steven Smith; (2) Terral Smith; (3) Joseph Wallace,\nPaul Harris, R. Kenneth Wheeler, and Scott Wilson of the private law firm of Wallace, Harris & Sims (\"WHS\"),\nlocated in West Virginia; and (4) Michael McDonald, Michael Rosman, Vincent Mulloy, Michael Troy, and Joseph\nShea of the Center for Individual Rights (\"CIR\"), a not-for-profit, public interest law firm located in Washington,\nD.C. Steven Smith is an Austin sole practitioner who initiated the suit. He was the only attorney representing the\nplaintiffs during the first eight months of the case. Terral Smith, also a sole practitioner in Austin, conducted the\nmajority of the trial presentation. Along with Terral Smith (although to a lesser degree), Wallace participated in the\ntrial presentation, while the other attorneys of WHS assisted in trial preparation. The CIR's main involvement in\nthe case was to conduct most of the legal research, write all legal briefs, and bankroll the case. Following the\n[81]\n1994 trial, the plaintiffs sought fees and expenses of $853,847.69 for 4,840.56 hours of work (\"trial hours\").\nAfter the successful appeal of this case, the plaintiffs increased their requests to $941,391.24 to reflect current\n[82]\nhourly billing rates.\n912 *912 Beginning in November 1994, the plaintiffs (for reasons unknown to the Court) obtained separate\nrepresentation on appeal to the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court. Hopwood and Carvell were represented by\n(1) Theodore Olson, Douglas Cox, Thomas Hungar, Walter J. Scott, and Daniel Nelson of the Washington, D.C.\n[83]\noffice of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (\"GDC\"); and (2) McDonald, Rosman, Troy, and Hans Bader of CIR.  Terral\nSmith and Steven Smith remained counsel of record for Elliot and Rogers. GDC primarily handled the appeal\nrelating to the constitutionality of the law school's use of racial preferences, including briefing the issues to both\nappellate courts and arguing the case to the Fifth Circuit. CIR worked on the appeals relating to the proposed\ninterventions by several minority groups and this Court's denial of attorneys' fees. In addition, CIR had primary\nresponsibility for coordinating activity among the lawyers representing Hopwood and Carvell. It appears Terral\nSmith and Steven Smith assisted GDC with the trial record only00their billing records demonstrate they did little\n97\n\nindependent appellate work and instead relied on GDC to argue the merits of the case to the Fifth Circuit and the\nSupreme Court. The plaintiffs seek fees and expenses of $614,138.56 for 2,400.85 hours of work during the\n[84]\nappellate phase of this case (\"appellate hours\").\nA.\nTo determine the appropriate award, the Court must calculate the \"lodestar\" by multiplying the number the\nnumber of hours reasonably spent on the litigation by a reasonable hourly billing rate. See Hensley v. Eckerhart,\n461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). The fee applicant bears the burden of\nestablishing that the hours expended and the billing rate are reasonable. Id. at 437, 103 S.Ct. at 1941. The Court\nshould consider the factors set forth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.\n1974), to evaluate the reasonableness of the fee requests. See Walker v. United States Dep't of Housing & Urban\nDev., 99 F.3d 761, 771 (5th Cir.1996) (indicating that most of the Johnson factors are reflected in the lodestar\namount and cannot be used to compute any upward or downward adjustment of the lodestar); Watkins v.\nFordice, 7 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir.1993). The Johnson factors are (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty\nand difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill required to perform the legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of\nother employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is\nfixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and\nthe results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" of the\ncase; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases. \nWatkins, 7 F.3d at 457 n. 4. As discussed below, the defendants challenge the fees sought for certain categories\nof work performed by counsel, as well as fees sought for duplicative, unnecessary, and excessive hours.\nMoreover, the Court made certain discretionary reductions in accordance with the Johnson factors.\n(1) Public and Media Relations\n913 The defendants argue the plaintiffs are not entitled to reimbursement for *913 time spent dealing with the media.\nAs the defendants correctly contend, the Fifth Circuit routinely denies such requests because they are not related\nto the litigation of the case. See id. at 458; Associated Builders & Contractors of La., Inc. v. Orleans Parish Sch.\nBd., 919 F.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir.1990) (affirming the district court's decision to discount award for time spent\npreparing press releases); see also Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 31 F.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 1994)\n(\"The legitimate goals of litigation are almost always attained in the courtroom, not in the media.\"). The plaintiffs\nurge the Court to apply the standard of recovery announced in Davis v. City and County of San Francisco, 976\nF.2d 1536, 1545 (9th Cir. 1992),vacated in part on other grounds,984 F.2d 345 (9th Cir.1993), in which the Ninth\nCircuit held that fees incurred in public relations efforts are recoverable as long as such efforts \"contributed,\ndirectly and substantially, to the attainment of [the party's] litigation goals.\" Watkins, 7 F.3d at 458 (noting the\nexistence of the Davis rule but refusing either to accept it or to reject it). Even applying the Davis standard to this\n[85]\ncase, the Court finds the plaintiffs have not shown that their efforts in the media assisted in the litigation.\nInstead, the public relations efforts in this case clearly relate to the divisive political00as opposed to legal00issue of\n97 97\naffirmative action. Cf. Rum Creek, 31 F.3d at 176 (refusing to allow recovery for time spent dealing with the media\nbecause those efforts were aimed at rehabilitating the plaintiff's public image). Accordingly, the Court deducts\n5.50 trial hours and 68 appellate hours from its award for time spent by counsel in press and television\ninterviews, as well as \"reviewing clips\" and other actions related to the media, because they were not reasonable\n[86]\nand necessary for the prosecution of this case.\n(2) Proposed Interventions\nThe defendants argue the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys' fees for work related to the failed interventions of\nthe Thurgood Marshall Legal Society, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the\nMexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The Supreme Court has held that a prevailing party in a\ncivil rights lawsuit cannot recover attorney's fees against an intervenor unless the intervention is \"frivolous,\n\nunreasonable or without foundation.\" Independent Fed. of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 761, 109\nS.Ct. 2732, 2737, 105 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989). Several circuit courts have read Zipes to imply that plaintiffs should\nbear the risk of incurring intervention-related costs as a result of filing a lawsuit and have therefore extended \nZipes's holding to a prevailing party's claims for intervention-related attorneys' fees against a losing defendant. \nSee Rum Creek, 31 F.3d at 176-78 (\"Zipes instructs us not to shift intervention-related expenses to the losing\ndefendant.\"); Bigby v. City of Chicago, 927 F.2d 1426, 1428-29 (7th Cir. 1991) (\"Zipes indicates that a ...\ndefendant's fee liability does not presumptively extend to cover fees incurred by plaintiffs in litigating third-party\n[87]\ninterests....\"). In this case, the defendants did not participate in the proposed third-party interventions.\n914 Because *914 the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties as against the defendants on the issue of intervention, they\nare not entitled to attorneys' fees for time spent litigating that issue, and the Court deducts 184.90 trial hours and\n[88]\n338.47 appellate hours from its award of fees. See Bigby, 927 F.2d at 1429 (holding that the plaintiff could not\nrecover against a defendant that opposed intervention); Reeves v. Harrell, 791 F.2d 1481, 1483-84 (11th Cir.\n1986) (holding that a plaintiff is not a prevailing party vis-a-vis a defendant who remains neutral on issues raised\nby an intervenor's complaint).\n(3) Travel Time\nThe Court is of the opinion that time spent for travel should not be billed at the same hourly rate sought for active\nlegal work. Accordingly, the number of hours sought for travel time shall be reduced by fifty percent. See Watkins,\n7 F.3d at 459 (affirming the district court's decision to completely disallow compensation for travel time); Sun\nPubl'g Co., Inc. v. Mecklenburg News, Inc., 594 F.Supp. 1512, 1520 (E.D.Va.1984) (reducing fees for travel time\nby eighty percent) (citing Younger v. Glamorgan Pipe & Foundry Co., 418 F.Supp. 743, 794 (W.D.Va. 1976),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds,561 F.2d 563 (4th Cir.1977)). The attorneys spent 155.50 trial hours\n[89]\nand 36.05 appellate hours traveling, resulting in a discount of 77.75 trial hours and 18.03 appellate hours.\n(4) Issues on Remand\nThe plaintiffs seek compensation for time spent preparing for the April 1997 trial. These time entries begin in mid-\nJuly 1996. Because the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties on the issues submitted by the Fifth Circuit on remand,\nthey are not entitled to compensation for those failed efforts. The Court has identified 249.10 appellate hours\n[90]\nspent in this endeavor.\n(5) Duplicative Work Product and Billing Judgment\nIn addition to disallowing hours for certain kinds of work altogether, the Court must also consider whether the\nplaintiffs have adequately eliminated fees sought for duplicative, unproductive, and unnecessary work product. \nSee Hensley, 461 U.S. at 432-34, 103 S.Ct. at 1939; League of United Latin American Citizens v. Roscoe Indep.\nSch. Dist., 119 F.3d 1228, 1232-1233 (5th Cir.1997) (\"LULAC\"). Moreover, the plaintiffs must exercise proper\n915 billing judgment when submitting fee applications.[91]See Walker, 99 F.3d at 769. The Court has very carefully \n*915 perused the attorney time entries for instances of redundant and wasteful hours. Given the sheer number of\nattorneys on the case (there were a total of sixteen attorneys involved00eleven at trial and twelve on appeal),\n97\nthere was significant duplication of effort for which the plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation. See Leroy v.\nCity of Houston, 906 F.2d 1068, 1079 (5th Cir.1990) (indicating that hours which result from the case being\noverstaffed are not hours reasonably expended and should be excluded from the lodestar calculation). Indeed,\nthe lawyers in this case exceeded the plaintiffs by three-to-one even though the legal issues for each plaintiff\nwere identical. Reductions for duplicative work are particularly appropriate in this case because only two\nattorneys, Terral Smith and Wallace, basically performed the trial presentation, while the bulk of the compensable\nappellate work was performed by GDC. See id. (\"[T]here should be no compensation for hours spent in\nduplicative activity or spent in the passive role of an observer while other attorneys performed.\") In addition,\nalthough it is the plaintiffs' prerogative to obtain additional representation on appeal, doing so in this case\nrequired attorneys for GDC to familiarize themselves with the record and legal issues already known by trial\n\ncounsel. Finally, the amount of billing in unproductive attorney and client conferences at the trial and appellate\nlevels is somewhat astonishing, especially given the fact that each attorney present at the conference usually\nbilled this time at his full hourly rate. For example, it appears that more than half of the $38,500 in fees Harris\nsubmitted relate exclusively to co-counsel conferences.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of additional examples of redundant and unnecessary work product, as well\nas a lack of billing judgment: (1) thousands of dollars were spent repeatedly reading and reviewing the same\nSupreme Court cases on affirmative action; (2) compensation is sought for non-legal work such as reading a\nnational best seller on affirmative action, attending a panel discussion regarding the impact of the case, and\nreviewing co-counsel agreements; (3) an excessive amount of time was spent reading the defendants' pleadings\n[92]\nand reviewing the documents in the case;  (4) virtually without exception, the attorneys listed hours spent\nlearning the rules and procedures of the Western District of Texas, the Fifth Circuit, and the Supreme Court; (5)\nseveral research projects involved basic civil rights doctrines which should already have been known by counsel,\nsuch as the standards of review in equal protection cases; (6) there was excessive research and drafting\nregarding the issue of Elliot's standing to sue; (7) the attorneys spent hours exhaustively reading, reviewing, and\nsummarizing the deposition testimony of Professor Johanson and Dean Yudof, such as one attorney from CIR\nwho spent 45 hours and $5,625 summarizing Johanson's deposition; (8) there was excessive and inappropriate\nbilling for routine clerical work, organization of files, and data entry which should have been accomplished by\nnon-attorneys; (9) many time entries were inadequately documented under the rules and standards of the Fifth\nCircuit, particularly by attorneys for GDC, WHS, and Terral Smith, and some of CIR's time entries did not even\n[93]\nhave a description of the work performed;  (10) Steven Smith had entries for time spent in relation to three\nplaintiffs who withdrew from the lawsuit prior to trial; and (11) CIR seeks compensation for Dr. Michael Greve, the\n916 founder of CIR and a non-lawyer, for consulting work performed *916 during the trial phase of the case. These\ncharges are inappropriate, and they will not count against the defendants.\nIt was impractical for the Court to wade through literally hundreds of time entries in order to assess a specific\nnumber of duplicative and excessive hours for each attorney. Moreover, \"[t]he proper remedy when there is no\nevidence of billing judgment is to reduce the hours awarded by a percentage intended to substitute for the\nexercise of billing judgment.\" Walker, 99 F.3d at 770. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Court concludes\nthat a twenty-five percent reduction in the amount of trial hours for Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and WHS is\nequitable and warranted. The fee application CIR submitted for trial work, however, is another story. The\n\"padding\" of attorney hours was quite extensive, not only in the amount of time it took attorneys to complete a\nparticular task but also in the types of tasks the attorneys performed. In the Court's opinion, a reduction of thirty-\nfive percent would more accurately reflect the number of hours CIR reasonably spent on litigation.\nThe percentage reduction for work at the appellate level is a more complex question because, unlike the work\nperformed for trial, the appeal was less of a collective endeavor. Compared to the work performed by GDC, the\nwork performed by CIR, Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and Wallace was of considerably less value to the plaintiffs.\n[94]\n In fact, their work on appeal primarily consisted of performing duplicative research, assisting GDC with the\ntrial record, filing notices of appearance, reviewing court decisions, and revising the plaintiff's supplemental\n[95]\napplications for attorneys' fees.  Therefore, the Court concludes the following reductions in appellate hours are\nfair and appropriate: a twenty-five percent reduction for GDC and a thirty-five percent reduction for CIR, Steven\nSmith, and Terral Smith.\n(6) Degree of Success\nWithout question, the plaintiffs attained extraordinary success in the appellate courts. The plaintiffs accomplished\nthe principal goal of the lawsuit00to dismantle all forms of racial preferences in public higher education in Texas.\n97\nThus, the Court does not question the success of the suit at the appellate levels through July 1, 1996, the date\nthe Supreme Court denied the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 103 S.Ct.\nat 1940 (\"[T]he fee should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised\nin the lawsuit.\"). However, the plaintiffs did not succeed in one important aspect of their lawsuit 00that they were\n97\ndenied admission because of the law school's affirmative action program. The failure of the plaintiffs to obtain\n\nspecific injunctive and monetary relief is not, in the Court's opinion, a trivial or insignificant matter. See Albright v.\nGood Shepherd Hosp., 901 F.2d 438, 441 (5th Cir. 1990) (asserting that fees must be apportioned in light of the\nresults obtained). Accordingly, the final fee award for trial level work shall be reduced for each attorney and/or law\nfirm by fifteen percent.\nB.\nSteven Smith, Terral Smith, and Wallace submitted current hourly rates of $125, $225, and $250, respectively.\nThe current hourly rates submitted by CIR are $280 for McDonald, the president of CIR; $260 for Rosman, CIR's\ngeneral counsel; $240 for Mulloy; $210 for Shea; $180 for Troy; and $150 for Bader. The current rates for\nparalegals (CIR used three at trial and six on appeal) is $70 per hour. GDC submitted the following hourly rates\n917 for its lawyers: $450 for Olson, *917 a former United States Assistant Attorney General, a partner, and head of\n[96]\nGDC's appellate and constitutional law practice group;  $275 for Cox, an attorney \"of counsel\" to firm; $275 for\nHungar and Scott, two senior associates with the firm; and $215 for Nelson, a junior associate with the firm. The\ncurrent billing rates for the four GDC paralegals who worked on the appeal range from $75 to $100 per hour. The\nCourt does not have current hourly rates for Harris, Wheeler, Wilson, and the one WHS legal assistant who\nworked on the case. Their historic hourly rates are $200 for Harris and Wheeler, both partners at WHS; $85 per\n[97]\nhour for Wilson, an associate; and $60 per hour for the legal assistant.\n(1) Relevant Community\nThe reasonable hourly billing rate is based on the prevailing market rates in the relevant community00in this\n97\ninstance, Austin, Texas, where the case was tried. See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S.Ct. 1541,\n1547, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). GDC, CIR, WHS, and Wallace argue, however, that they are entitled to the\nprevailing market rate for comparable services performed in Washington, D.C. (where GDC and CIR are located)\nbecause local counsel was unavailable to take the case. See National Wildlife Fed'n v. Hanson, 859 F.2d 313,\n317-18 (4th Cir.1988); Chrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., 670 F.2d 760, 768 (7th Cir.1982) (both holding that outside\ncounsel may be retained when local counsel is unavailable and the plaintiffs have acted reasonably in choosing\noutside counsel). Several attorneys submitted affidavits with the applications for attorneys' fees indicating that\nthey attempted the locate pro bono assistance from members of the private bar in Texas but, other than Terral\nSmith, none could be obtained. See, e.g., Affidavit of Michael McDonald, August 29, 1994. The plaintiffs'\nattorneys also assert the complexity of the case and the superior resources of the defendants required the\ninvolvement of outside counsel. The Court rejects those arguments and the affidavits. From the inception of this\ncase, there has been a shortage of clients, not lawyers. Steven Smith spent months soliciting clients through the\nmail, and only seven individuals responded. See D-650 (sample solicitation letter). Once Smith was retained, he\nsought the assistance of CIR because he apparently lacked both the expertise and the funds to try the lawsuit. \nSee id. The Court will not assess against the defendants the higher rates of Washington, D.C. because local\ncounsel got in over his head. In addition, Terral Smith provided competent and skilled legal representation in the\ntrial court, and the Court has no doubt he was capable of the same degree of competence regarding the appeal\nhad it been determined he should have remained the plaintiffs' primary lawyer.\n(2) Prevailing Market Rate\nWhen the attorney's customary rate fails within the range of hourly fees in the prevailing market for attorneys of\nsimilar skill and experience, the Court should consider that rate in setting a reasonable hourly rate; if the Court\ndeviates from the customary rate, the Court must specifically articulate its reasons for doing so. See LULAC,119\nF.3d at 1234; Watkins, 7 F.3d at 459. Although the hourly fee awarded must be supported by the record and\ncannot merely reflect the experiences of the Court, see LULAC,119 F.3d at 1234, the Court may consider\nevidence outside the record, such as the hourly rate given in similar cases in the Western District of Texas, see \nWalker, 99 F.3d at 770. Terral Smith was the only attorney who timely presented evidence regarding the\n918 prevailing market rates for comparable services performed *918 in Austin, Texas.[98] He indicates that the\n\nprevailing market rate for federal court practice in the Western District of Texas is between $220 to $300 per hour\n(these rates were charged in a case involving the Endangered Species Act). For federal civil rights litigation,\nTerral Smith indicates that a rate of $225 per hour is reasonable for an attorney of his skills and abilities. See\nAffidavit in Support of Motion for Attorney's Fees, Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees, August 29, 1994. In the\nCourt's experience, most recent fee awards in civil rights cases in the Western District of Texas generally have\n[99]\nbilling rates ranging from $150 to $200 per hour.  The record in this case does not support a billing rate higher\nthan $225 per hour. See LULAC,119 F.3d at 1234.\n(3) Assessing the Rates\nThe hourly rate of $125 requested by Steven Smith appears reasonable given both his limited trial and appellate\nexperience and his role in the case. He was primarily involved in discovery, including document review,\nresponding to the defendants' discovery requests, and participating in discovery disputes. He also performed\nlegal research related to tangential issues in the case, such as Hopwood's residency status. As discussed above,\nhe performed little substantive work on the appeal. Furthermore, this rate is higher than Smith's normal billing\nrate and is the highest rate Smith has ever received in any federal civil rights litigation he has undertaken. Terral\nSmith's hourly rate of $225 is also reasonable. Given his competence and years of experience, the rate is in line\nwith prevailing market rates for comparable work.\nThe rates requested by Wallace, CIR, and GDC, however, are excessive. Wallace's rate of $250 runs afoul of the\ncurrent prevailing market rates in Austin. Wallace's rate for trial level work is therefore reduced to $225, a rate\nthat reflects his role in the trial and his years of experience. As for the time Wallace spent on appeal, the Court\nconcludes that his rate should be reduced to $200 per hour because all of Wallace's compensable post-trial time\nrelates to his application for attorney's fees. As the Fifth Circuit has indicated, an attorney should not command\nhis or her normal billing rate for such work. See Leroy, 906 F.2d at 1079 (\"Certainly, the base rate for time spent\non computing and enforcing attorneys' fees should be less than that allowed for professional services rendered\nprimarily on the merits.\"). As for Harris and Wheeler, the Court assesses an hourly rate of $200. According to\ntheir billing records, their main function was to consult with co-counsel about the case; they performed very little\nindependent work and did not actively participate at trial. The Court concludes an hourly rate $100 for Wilson for\n[100]\nthe legal research and document review he performed is fair and reasonable.\nWith respect to CIR, its normal billing rates are excessive given its function at trial and on appeal. Considering\nthe evidence of prevailing market rates in the record, as well as the Court's experience in these kinds of cases, a\nrate higher than $200 per hour for any attorney who did not actively participate at the trial (in terms of presenting\nwitness or opening and closing statements) or on appeal (in terms of oral argument) would be unreasonable.\n919 Accordingly, an hourly rate of $200 *919 for McDonald and Rosman, the two most experienced CIR lawyers, is\nappropriate. A rate of $175 per hour is appropriate for Mulloy, Shea, and Troy, the mid-level lawyers, and a rate of\n$150 per hour is reasonable for Bader, the least experienced lawyer at CIR.\nGDC's billing rates are extreme even with respect to the evidence GDC itself offered. For instance, GDC's\nevidence establishes that no firm in Washington, D.C. charges an hourly rate for associate work over $230, and\nyet GDC requests that such work be compensated at a rate of $275 per hour. See Leroy, 906 F.2d at 1079\n(\"[T]he hourly rates are to be adequate to attract competent counsel,... not the rates which lions at the bar may\ncommand.\") (internal quotations omitted). Indeed, such exorbitant rates are particularly inappropriate when \"the\nexperience and special skill of the attorney does not result in the expenditure of fewer hours than counsel would\nnormally be expected to spend.\" Id. The Court assesses a rate of $225 per hour for Olson and Cox, the two most\nexperienced and distinguished lawyers from GDC and the two attorneys who controlled the appeal. The Court\nfinds an hourly rate of $175 for Hungar and Scott and an hourly rate of $150 for Nelson is appropriate in light of\ntheir contribution to the case (primarily legal research and assisting with the trial record and the briefs) and their\nlevels of experience.\nFinally, rather than assign a specific rate for each paralegal and law clerk from WHS, CIR and GDC who worked\non the case, the Court has aggregated the hours for each firm. The Court concludes a reasonable rate for work\n\nperformed by paralegals and law clerks from GDC is $80 per hour; for WHS and CIR paralegals, a reasonable\nrate is $70 per hour.\n(4) Compensation for Delay in Payment\nIn assessing a reasonable rate, the Court considered the attorneys' current hourly rates (as opposed to the\nhistoric rates submitted with the 1994 fee applications) in order to compensate for the delay in payment. See \nMissouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 282-84, 109 S.Ct. 2463, 2468-69, 105 L.Ed.2d 229 (1989) (\"[A]n appropriate\nadjustment for delay in payment00whether by the application of current rather than historic hourly rates or\n97\notherwise00is within the contemplation of [§ 1988].\"); In re Washington Public Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., 19\n97\nF.3d 1291, 1305 (9th Cir.1994) (\"Full compensation requires charging current rates for all work done during the\nlitigation, or by using historical rates enhanced by an interest factor.\"). Where appropriate (as with Wallace, Shea,\nTroy, Wilson, and paralegal work), the Court increased the original hourly rate to compensate for the delay in\npayment. In this case, however, the Court found that many of the requested billing rates were excessive. In those\ninstances, the Court assessed hourly rates which, although lower than the rates requested, are intended to reflect\ncurrent hourly rates in the prevailing market.\nC.\n(1) Trial Hours\nTable I represents the total hours for which the plaintiffs' are entitled to compensation for hours spent at the trial\nlevel, with the appropriate deductions identified in Part V(A) for time spent on public and media relations, the\nproposed interventions, travel, duplicative work product, and lack of billing judgment.

Aggregating the individual amounts of Olson, Cox, Hungar, Scott,\nNelson, and the GDC Clerks results in a total lodestar amount for GDC of $136,217.00.\nD.\nThe plaintiffs do not request a multiplier of the lodestar, see Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees, August 29,\n1994, and the Court does not believe adjustment of the lodestar is warranted. This case involved extensive\ndiscovery and has spanned over five years. The legal issues, however, were neither novel nor extraordinarily\ndifficult, as there have been many significant challenges to affirmative action since Bakke, both in and out of the\ncontext of higher education. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this case was the comprehensive marshaling\nand analysis of equal protection case law in the context of affirmative action. The Court is confident, however,\nthat the difficulties of the case are accurately reflected in the lodestar amount.\nThe Court realizes that, at first blush, the reductions may seem excessive. Frankly, that impression is due to the\nsloppy state of most of the fee applications and the considerable overstaffing of this case, both of which\nnecessitated significant reductions by the Court. In fact, the fee applications submitted by GDC, WHS, and Terral\nSmith were so vague and uninformative the Court seriously considered not awarding attorneys' fees to those\nindividuals at all. In any event, the Court conducted its own calculations regarding the number of hours it should\nhave taken to prepare, try, and appeal this case. Based on an evaluation of the work performed by counsel, the\nundersigned's thirty years of trial experience, and the Johnson factors, the Court concludes that the lodestar is a\nfair estimate of an appropriate fee award. A single law firm spending an average of fifty hours per week for an\nentire year could have easily prepared the case and tried it. Had the same law firm handled the appeal, the case\ncould have been prepared and argued to the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court in less than six hundred hours\n(an average of forty hours per week for fifteen weeks). Assuming an average rate of $200 per hour at trial and\n$225 per hour on appeal, the case should have cost around $650,000. The lodestar exceeds that amount by over\n$50,000.\nE.\nThe defendants object to the expenses sought in this case associated with the plaintiffs' opposition to the\n922 proposed interventions *922 and the costs relating to the involvement of outside counsel to try the case.[101]\nThese expenses include travel expenses, lodging, phone calls, mailing expenses, and Fifth Circuit fees relating to\nthe appeal of the motions to intervene. The Court agrees these charges are inappropriate under § 1988 and\nmakes a resulting deduction of $19,475.09 in CIR's first fee application. As for the post-appeal applications, the\nCourt was able to identify $246.25 spent by GDC in relation to NEXIS searches; presumably, these expenses\nrelate to GDC's efforts with the media and therefore are not recoverable. CIR's post-appeal records specifically\nlabel $955.70 spent on \"public relations\" which the Court will likewise exclude. However, given the general nature\nof the research, printing, mailing, and traveling expenses submitted by CIR, it was impossible for the Court to\n\nassess a specific dollar amount to be excluded from CIR's post-appeal fee application. Therefore, the Court\nreduces all such expenses by fifty-five percent as a reasonable approximation of the costs related to opposing\nthe intervention attempts. The Court also deducts $18.72 from Steven Smith's application for charges incurred\nafter July 1996, which charges presumably relate to the issues on remand.\nTables V and VI represent the amount of expenses requested by the plaintiffs in the trial and appellate levels of\nthis case, respectively, with the appropriate deductions made in accordance with the paragraph above. The\ninterest is calculated using the prime rate to compensate the plaintiffs for the delay in payment. See Alberti v.\nKlevenhagen, 896 F.2d 927, 938 (5th Cir.) (\"[T]he appropriate rate of interest to be used in compensating a delay\nin payment adjustment is the cost of borrowing money, the prime rate.\"), vacated in part on other grounds,903\nF.2d 352 (5th Cir.1990). The interest in Table V is calculated from August 29, 1994, the date the plaintiffs filed\ntheir initial applications for attorneys' fees, until the date of this order. The interest in Table VI is calculated from\nOctober 1, 1996, the date the plaintiffs filed their supplemental applications for attorneys fees, until the date of\n[102]\nthis order.\n                  TABLE V: TRIAL EXPENSES AND INTEREST\n          Expenses Sought   Deductions   Subtotal   Interest Rate   Total\nS.

To the extent\nminority and nonminority applicants share similar test scores 00 in which case subjective judgments will always\n97\ninform the admissions process 00 there is the risk that the rejected applicant will blame his or her nonadmission\n97\non race and sue for damages in court. In the end, the determination of who deserves an offer of admission and\nwho does not is left in the less-than-capable hands of people outside the academic arena 00 judges. Moreover,\n97\nthe specter of large compensatory damage awards could threaten to compromise the integrity of the admissions\nprocess itself. Public universities deserve the freedom to make the necessarily difficult choices regarding\nadmission, and part of that endeavor entails not only consideration of the individual applicant but also the needs\nof higher education in general and the educational institution and class in particular. This case certainly does not\nmake these serious responsibilities any easier.\nJUDGMENT\nBE IT REMEMBERED on the 20th day of March 1998 the Court entered its memorandum opinion consisting of\nits findings of fact and conclusions of law in the above-captioned matter and, consistent with those findings and\nconclusions, enters the following judgment:\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the plaintiffs Cheryl J. Hopwood, Douglas W. Carvell,\nKenneth R. Elliott, and David A. Rogers have judgments of and against the University of Texas at Austin in the\namount of One Dollar ($1.00) each, and further that the University of Texas at Austin as the University of Texas\nSchool of Law and its officers in their official capacities are hereby enjoined from taking into consideration racial\npreferences in the selection of those individuals to be admitted as students at the University of Texas School of\nLaw.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the plaintiffs Cheryl J. Hopwood, Douglas W.\nCarvell, Kenneth R. Elliott, and David A. Rogers TAKE NOTHING further in their causes of action against the\ndefendants the State of Texas; the University of Texas Board of Regents; Bernard Rapopart, Ellen C. Temple,\nLowell H. Leberman, Jr., Robert Cruikshank, Thomas O. Hicks, Zan W. Holmes, Jr., Tom Loeffler, Mario E.\nRamirez, and Martha E. Smiley, as members of the Board of Regents in their official capacities; and Robert M.\nBerdahl, in his official capacity as President of the University of Texas at Austin.\n924 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the plaintiffs *924 shall have and recover against\nthe University of Texas at Austin the sum of $703,992.29 in attorneys' fees; costs in the amount of $58,135.50\nincurred as of August 29, 1994, which includes an interest rate of 8.47 percent per annum (simple) from August\n29, 1994, to the date of this judgment; and costs in the amount of $13,632.52 incurred as of October 1, 1996,\nwhich includes interest of 8.38 percent per annum (simple) from October 1, 1996, to the date of this judgment, for\nwhich let execution issue.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that this judgment shall bear interest of 5.407 percent\nfrom the date of this judgment until paid.\nIT IS FINALLY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that all other relief requested by any party herein is\nDENIED as this is a final judgment.\n\n[1] Sections 1981 and 1983 are the vehicles by which the plaintiffs assert violations of the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Title VI provides in relevant part: \nNo person in the United states shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\n42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n[2] Many of the University of Texas officials sued by the plaintiffs in 1992 are no longer associated with the\nUniversity of Texas system and/or the law school. Defendants Bernard Rapopart, Ellen C. Temple, Lowell H.\nLeberman, Jr., Robert Cruikshank, Thomas O. Hicks, Zan W. Holmes, Jr., Tom Loeffler, Mario E. Ramirez, and\nMartha E. Smiley were sued in their official capacities as members of the University of Texas Board of Regents.\nDefendant Robert M. Berdahl was sued in his official capacity as President of the University of Texas at Austin;\nthe current interim President is Peter T. Flawn. Defendant Mark Yudof was sued in his official capacity as the\nDean of the University of Texas School of Law; M. Michael Sharlot, an Assistant Dean of the law school in 1992,\nhas since replaced Yudof as Dean. Defendant Stanley M. Johanson was sued in his official capacity as Chair of\nthe University of Texas School of Law Admissions Committee and remains in that capacity to this date.\n[3] The 1992 admissions procedures favored only black and Mexican-American applicants. Other minority\ngroups, including Hispanics not of Mexican-American descent, were not granted preferences in admission. In this\nopinion, the Court loosely uses the term \"minority\" to refer to blacks and Mexican-Americans; the term \"non-\nminority\" is used to refer to whites and non-preferred minorities.\n[4] In the Title VII arena, the Supreme Court has developed a burden-shifting scheme to be used when there is\nno direct evidence of an employer's racial animus. See, e.g., Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450\nU.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct.\n1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The employee bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54, 101 S.Ct. at 1094. If successful, the burden of production shifts\nto the defendant to establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for the adverse employment action. See id. at\n254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95. If such grounds are shown, the burden shifts back to the employee to establish\nthat the reasons proffered by the defendant are merely pretext for unlawful discrimination. See id. at 255-56, 101\nS.Ct. at 1095. The burden of persuasion remains on the employee at all times. See id. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093.\nIn this case, the Court held that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case of discrimination by proving that the\n1992 admissions process was constitutionally flawed. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 580. The plaintiffs failed to\npersuade the Court, however, that the law school's proffered reasons for the plaintiffs' non-admission were\npretextual. See id. at 581-82.\n[5] In view of the unequal treatment to which the plaintiffs were subjected, however, the Court granted nominal\ndamages in the amount of one dollar to each plaintiff and allowed the plaintiffs to reapply to the law school in\n1995 without incurring any administrative costs or fees. See id. at 582-83.\n[6] Over the strenuous and critical objections of Chief Judge Politz and Circuit Judges King, Weiner, Benavides,\nStewart, Parker, and Dennis, the Fifth Circuit declined to reconsider the case en banc. See Hopwood v. State of\nTexas, 84 F.3d 720 (5th Cir.1996).\n[7] Finding no compelling state interest, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the second inquiry of whether the\naffirmative action program was narrowly tailored. See id. at 955.\n[8] The Court need not reconsider the issue of punitive damages, as the Fifth Circuit upheld the Court's\ndetermination that punitive damages were inappropriate in this case. See id. at 959.\n[9] The 1992 admissions procedures and the evolution of the law school's admissions procedures since the\n1960s are explained in greater detail in the Court's first opinion, see Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 557-563, as are\nthe plaintiffs' qualifications for admission to the law school, see id. at 564-567.\n\n[10] Slightly less than half of the applications the law school received were submitted by Texas residents. See \nHopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 22. In 1992, the University of Texas Board of Regents required an entering law\nschool class of at least 500 students, and Texas law mandated that at least 85% of the entering class be Texas\nresidents (the latter figure has since decreased to 80%). See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 563; Hopwood II, 78\nF.3d at 935 n. 2.\n[11] Although members of the minority subcommittee were supposed to review nonminority files as well,\ntestimony from the first trial established that Alemán did not review any nonminority files in 1992. See Hopwood I,\n861 F.Supp. at 562.\n[12] Because of the limited number of seats available for nonresidents, Johanson set the presumptive admission\nand denial lines at a higher level for nonresidents than for residents. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 22.\n[13] \"Johanson's setting of these scores was a process that evolved over the course of the admissions process\nbased on the pool of applicants, the number of offers, and the number of acceptances. Initially, the numbers were\nset high and lowered as the yield from offers and composition of the entering class began to develop.\" Hopwood\nI, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 24.\n[14] During the preliminary review process in January 1992, however, Johanson reviewed minority and\nnonminority files together. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 23.\n[15] The law school recently discarded the piles-of-thirty approach in favor of a smaller admissions committee\ncomprising three members. All three members of the admissions committee review each application. See\nWellborn, vol. 1 at 51, 246-47. (All references to the trial transcript in this opinion are from the second trial unless\notherwise noted.)\n[16] There were 18 stacks in the nonminority discretionary zone. Seventeen stacks contained 30 application files;\nthe remaining stack comprised only 16 files. Each committee member was required to screen 5 stacks. See \nHopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 562 n. 26 & 27.\n[17] In 1992, LSDAS was in the process of changing the LSAT scoring system from a two-digit system to a three-\ndigit system. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 25; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936 n. 5. For sake of consistency\nwith the Fifth Circuit decision, the TI scores reported in this opinion reflect only the three-digit scoring system. \nSee Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936 n. 5. With respect to LSAT scores, the Court refers to the applicants' percentile\nrank on the exam rather than to the applicant's two- or three-digit score in order to draw a more accurate\ncomparison among the applicants.\n[18] Carvell took the LSAT twice, once under the two-digit system and again under the three-digit system. He\nscored in the 61st percentile on his first exam and in the 91st percentile on his second exam. P-151. Carvell's TI\nscore of 197 only reflects his higher LSAT score in the 91st percentile. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 71. The Court's\nfirst opinion, which indicates that Carvell's TI score of 197 reflects his averaged LSAT score, see Hopwood I, 861\nF.Supp. at 566 n. 47, is in error.\n[19] As explained in further detail in Part III(B) infra, the law school reconsidered Elliot's application for admission\nfollowing Elliot's initial rejection in April 1992.\n[20] In his concurring opinion in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1795, 104 L.Ed.2d\n268 (1989), a case in which the Supreme Court applied the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting scheme to a Title VII sex\ndiscrimination case, Justice White explained the distinction between a \"mixed-motives\" and \"pretext\" case: \nThe Court has made it clear that `mixed-motives' cases, such as the present one, are different from pretext cases\nsuch as McDonnell Douglas and Burdine. In pretext cases, the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but\nnot both, were the true motives behind the decision. In mixed-motives cases, however, there is no one `true'\nmotive behind the decision. Instead, the decision is a result of multiple factors, at least one of which is\nlegitimate.... [T]he showing required by Mt. Healthy does not improperly shift from the plaintiff the ultimate burden\nof persuasion on whether the defendant intentionally discriminated against him or her.\n\nId. at 260, 109 S.Ct. at 1796 (citations and quotations omitted); see also Holo-Krome Co. v. N.L.R.B., 954 F.2d\n108, 110 (2nd Cir.1992) (\"[P]retext analysis determines what the true motivation actually was; dual motivation\nanalysis determines what the employer's conduct would have been if the improper motivation had not been\npresent.\").\n[21] The Supreme Court in Adarand implicitly recognized that an individual's inability to compete on an equal\nfooting as a result of discriminatory classifications is a harm that is related to the issue of standing. In holding that\nthe plaintiff had standing to challenge the use of racial preferences in the awarding of subcontractor bids in\nfederal agency contracts, the Supreme Court stated: \nWe note that ... [the plaintiff] Adarand need not demonstrate that it has been, or will be, the low bidder on a\ngovernment contract. The injury in cases of this kind is that a discriminatory classification prevent[s] the plaintiff\nfrom competing on an equal footing. The aggrieved party need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit\nbut for the barrier in order to establish standing.\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 211, 115 S.Ct. at 2105 (citations and quotations omitted).\n[22] For that reason, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52\nL.Ed.2d 396 (1977) is inapplicable as well. Teamsters was a Title VII disparate impact case in which the Supreme\nCourt held that once the employee establishes a system-wide pattern or practice of discrimination, the burden\nshifts to the employer to prove that individual hiring decisions were not made in pursuit of that policy. See id. at\n359-60, 97 S.Ct. at 1866-67. In that case, however, the Supreme Court specifically supported the burden-shifting\nscheme on the ground that an employee's proof of broad-based employment discrimination creates \"a greater\nlikelihood that any single [employment] decision was a component of the overall pattern,\" id. at 361 n. 45, 97\nS.Ct. at 1867 n. 45, and, consequently, there are \"reasonable grounds to infer that individual hiring decisions\nwere made in pursuit of the discriminatory policy,\" id. at 359, 97 S.Ct. at 1867. No similar inference can or should\nbe made in this case: a policy that affects 7% of a given population can hardly be called broad-based or\nwidespread, nor would it cause one to infer that an individual decision was infected by the discriminatory policy.\n[23] Furthermore, as a matter of public policy, it may be imprudent to apply the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting\nframework to the admissions procedures of public universities. In making its admissions decisions every year, the\nlaw school is faced with the enormous responsibility and discretion to select an entering class among applicants\nwho share similar academic qualifications (in terms of GPAs and LSAT scores), but who have varying personal\nbackgrounds and vastly different educational circumstances. Public universities are put in the unfortunate,\nperhaps even untenable, position of making such decisions with the threat of liability hanging in the background.\n[24] The plaintiffs did not proffer their own expert to testify as to what a constitutional admissions system would\nlook like or whether any of the plaintiffs would have been admitted under such a system.\n[25] The statistical breakdown for the 1992 resident admissions occurred as follows: \n    TI       Nonpreferred       Nonpreferred        % Nonpreferred      Minorities\n   score      Residents        Residents Denied          Residents         Admitted\n              Admitted                                   Admitted\n  203 up        169                     1                 -100%               4\n   202           27                     3                   90%               2\n   201           48                     5                   90%               1\n   200           51                     4                   92%               1\n   199           57                     7                   89%               4\n   198           34                    15                   69%               2\n   197           44                    27                   59%               1\n   196           29                    44                   40%               2\n   195           24                    40                   38%               3\n   194           15                    64                   19%               7\n\n   193           13                    59                   18%               5\n   192           10                    57                   15%               3\n   191            4                    72                    5%               5\n   190            5                    71                    7%              11\n   189            2                    63                    3%               3\n   188            1                    57                    2%               4\n   187            3                    55                    5%               9\n   186            2                    50                    4%              10\n   185            3                   393                 -  0%              19\n  down\n[26] The percentages in Wellborn's report, however, are not hard-and-fast figures, as there were small variations\nin the percentages from year to year. Furthermore, the 1992 percentages varied from other years because\nLSDAS was in the process of changing the LSAT scoring system from a two-digit score to a three-digit score.\nUnder the two-digit system, applicants were more compressed along the Texas Index. Because this methodology\nrelies too heavily on unreliable percentages of admission, the Court finds the methodology employed in\nWellborn's supplemental report preferable.\n[27] It was the practice of the law school to lower the presumptive admission and/or denial scores in order to\ngenerate more offers. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561-62; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 937 n. 10. Wellborn did not\nalter the number of votes per pile for discretionary zone applicants because doing so, he testified, would have\nyielded too many offers.\n[28] In 1992, the law school extended 637 resident offers to achieve 425 matriculants. Therefore, the overall\nresident yield rate, i.e., the rate at which candidates accepted their offers of admission, was approximately 67%. \nSee Johanson Declaration, D-332; Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 561 n. 22. The 1992 yield rate was approximately\n80% for African-Americans and 73% for Mexican-Americans. Wellborn assumed the yield rate for marginal\nnonminority candidates in a color-blind admissions process would be higher than 67% (and probably as high as\n75%) because the additional offers of admission to nonminorities would be made to less qualified (and therefore\nless desirable) applicants for whom the law school would probably be their first choice. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at\n152-53.\n[29] Wellborn's projected statistical breakdown in a race-blind admissions procedure: \n  TI score      % Nonpreferred        Total         % Admitted 00           Projected\n97\n               Admitted 00 Actual      Applicants        Projected        Number Admitted\n97\n  203 up            -100%              174              100%                 174\n   202                90%               32              100%                  32\n   201                90%               54               90%                49 + 1\n   200                92%               56               90%                50 + 1\n   199                89%               68               90%                61 + 1\n   198                69%               51               90%                46 + 1\n   197                59%               72               70%                50 + 1\n   196                40%               75               60%                45 + 1\n   195                38%               67               40%                27 + 1\n   194                19%               86               40%                34 + 1\n   193                18%               77               20%                  15\n   192                15%               71               20%                  14\n   191                 5%               81               15%                  12\n   190                 7%               87                5%                   4\n   189                 3%               68                5%                   3\n   188                 2%               63                5%                   3\n   187                 5%               71                5%                   4\n\n   186                 4%               65                5%                   3\n   185              -  0%               63                5%                   3\n184 down               0%              658                0%                   0\nAdjusting the presumptive admit and deny lines would not have accounted for all of the offers that would have\nbeen made assuming the same yield rate. Eight offers would still have to be made, and Wellborn accounted for\nthem by assuming that one candidate from each TI score between 201 and 194 would have been chosen from a\nwaiting list.\n[30] Statistically, Wellborn estimated that six additional offers would have been made at this index. He concluded,\nhowever, that the minority admittee might not have been admitted at a TI score of 197. Wellborn therefore\nprojected seven additional offers.\n[31] For purposes of stacking application files into piles of thirty, the law school classified Carvell as a TI 197\napplicant. Carvell's \"true\" TI score, using his combined LSAT score in the 76th percentile, was either 191 or 192. \nSee Wellborn, vol. 1 at 70. Although it was and is the normal practice of LSDAS to average multiple scores,\nLSDAS did not do so in 1992 for candidates who received LSAT scores under both systems. See Wellborn, vol. 1\nat 70-71. For purposes of reviewing Carvell's application, Wellborn testified that reviewers would have mentally\ndiscounted Carvell's TI score and would do so again in a color-blind process. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 73; see also\nDeclaration of Steven Goode D-336 (stating that he would discount Carvell's attempts to explain his poor\nperformance on his first LSAT since applicants have the option of canceling their scores). At trial, Carvell objected\nto Wellborn's circular argument in his first report that Carvell compares unfavorably to other TI 197 applicants in\npart because \"Carvell does not really belong at this index.\" See D-519. For purposes of his first report, Wellborn\nclassified Carvell with other TI 197 applicants because it was Carvell's actual classification in 1992. In his\nsupplemental report, however. Wellborn compares Carvell to the entire pool of discretionary zone applicants,\nincluding applicants with TI scores of 191 and 192.\n[32] As Wellborn testified, the fact that he only evaluated LSDAS sheets with TI scores of 190 or above was an\nomission that probably benefitted the plaintiffs. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 50. Wellborn acknowledged that \"one or\ntwo\" candidates with TI scores below 190 might have been \"extraordinary\" enough to compensate for their low\nindex. Id. To the extent that Wellborn did not consider those applicants 00 or, for that matter, the 250 applicants\n97\nwithin the hypothetical discretionary zone whose entire application files might have revealed extraordinary\nqualities meriting the applicant's admission 00 Wellborn eliminated from the applicant pool a few potential\n97\ncompetitors who probably would have been admitted.\n[33] The TI scores calculated by LSDAS in 1992, on the other hand, gave slightly greater weight to an\napplicants's LSAT score. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935 n. 1 (indicating that LSDAS assigned a 60% weight to a\ncandidate's LSAT score and a 40% weight to his or her GPA in 1992). Of course, the law school is not bound by\nLSDAS's determination that the LSAT score should be weighed more heavily in determining admission.\n[34] The college LSAT mean is the average LSAT score of students who took the LSAT from that particular\ncollege or university. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 44. In Wellborn's opinion, \"the college LSAT mean is the best way of\ncomparing colleges in terms of the caliber of the student body.\" See D-520. The numbers bear out Wellborn's\nassessment. The 1992 LSAT means of the following universities illustrate the difference: Harvard University (40);\nDuke University (39); Rice University (38); Trinity University (36); the University of Texas (between 35 and 34);\nTexas A & M University (33); Hendrix College (32); California State University-Sacramento (28); and the\nUniversity of Houston-Downtown (26).\n[35] Wellborn initially identified 18 minorities who he believed would have been admitted in a raceneutral system.\nThe file of one minority applicant was inadvertently omitted from the original report; Wellborn reviewed that file\nand concluded that the applicant would have been admitted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 89-90 and D-669 (indicating\nthat the applicant graduated in the 98th percentile at Texas A & M University and received an LSAT score in the\n96th percentile). Therefore, the original calculation of 78 additional offers is erroneous.\n[36] Wellborn segregated the applicants by race into Groups A, B, C, and D for administrative convenience only.\nWhen evaluating the application files, he did not review the minority and nonminority files separately.\n\n[37] Although the plaintiffs openly questioned Wellborn's integrity and ability to render an unbiased opinion at trial,\nthey did not contend that Wellborn was unqualified to render an expert opinion regarding the plaintiffs'\nqualifications for admission vis-a-vis other denied nonminority applicants. And, other then the nonsensical\nobjection that Wellborn is not a mathematician or statistician (discussed infra), the plaintiffs do not argue that\nWellborn is incapable of assessing the plaintiffs' chances of admission under a constitutional admissions system.\n[38] Johanson recognized this difficulty as well. When asked in his 1993 deposition whether Hopwood's chances\nof admission would have been improved in the absence of the law school's affirmative action program, Johanson\ntestified: \nI haven't got a clue.... I can't say, if she was in another stack, whether she would have gotten two votes to admit\nor no votes to admit .... What was it in that file that impressed one screener and didn't impress two? Was it the\nmakeup of the overall competition? What was it? There is no way that 00 it would be not only sheer speculation,\n97\nbut I think it would be improper to speculate because it's just based on the misunderstanding of the relativity of\nevery decision.\nJohanson, vol.1 at 256-57.\nThe plaintiffs have attempted to use Johanson's testimony to demonstrate that the law school cannot establish by\na preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs would not have been admitted under a constitutional system.\nWellborn testified, however, that the validity of his predictions is not dependent on whether the admissions\nprocedure uses stacks of thirty or whether one reviewer or group of reviewers evaluates all of the application\nfiles. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 251-52. Likewise, Sharlot testified that, although the piles-of-thirty approach had a\n\"certain degree of artificiality\" (given the limited number of choices each reviewer could make), the voting\npatterns of the faculty members on the admissions committee was not aberrational or unpredictable:\nI think that as the committee, which maintained its personnel to a very large extent [for a very long time], as the\ncommittee worked over many years, there came to be a fairly high degree ... of shared agreement as to which\ncriteria were more pertinent and the weights that should be given to them. And that is why I believe it is possible\nto undertake a review of hundreds of files and to make a reasonable prediction as to the likelihood, given the\nmake up [sic] of the committee, who was most likely to receive an offer of admission.\nSharlot, vol. 2 at 22-23. Using the piles of thirty was, in the Court's opinion, a flawed approach. However, the\napproach was intended to produce the most qualified candidates for admission, and that was the same goal\nWellborn attempted to achieve in his expert reports.\n[39] In 1992, the application files in the discretionary zone were separated according to whether the applicant had\na two-digit or three-digit LSAT score. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 161. Although two-digit and three-digit candidates\nwere, for the most part, compared separately in 1992, Wellborn did not separate the two groups in preparing his\nreports. Wellborn, vol. 1 at 159. The plaintiffs complain that Wellborn's failure to segregate applicants by their\nLSAT score is another fundamental flaw in his methodology. In view of the fact that Wellborn did not attempt to\nreplicate the 1992 admissions system, the Court finds that Wellborn's failure to evaluate two-digit and three-digit\ncandidates separately is inconsequential.\n[40] Wellborn testified that 123 wait list letters were sent to applicants and that the \"vast majority\" of the waiting\nlist offers were accepted. See Wellborn,\nvol. 1 at 55-56. Therefore, the actual number of individuals on the waiting list was somewhat smaller than 123.\n[41] Wellborn explained the fact that committee members were required to cast a certain number of votes per pile\nmeant that in some instances the last vote was \"forced.\" In Wellborn's words, it would have been \"crazy\" to\nconstruct a process in advance in which anyone who received a forced vote in the screening process would\nautomatically be admitted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 54.\n[42] At the remand trial, Hamilton testified as follows: \nAnd the Hopwood file I remember in particular having read the file and agonizing over her personal situation with\nrespect to her child. And then I returned my files to the admissions office, I checked to 00 I did not vote for Ms.\n97\n\nHopwood at all. I checked to see if other members had voted for her, and they did not. And out of sympathy for\nher case, again, which I had some concern about, I changed my vote to put her on the waiting list and took a vote\nfrom someone else who had already gained admission.\nHamilton, vol. 2 at 27. Although Professor Johanson had instructed committee members to conduct blind voting,\nHamilton did not follow this instruction in 1992. She testified she was concerned that her voting had been\n\"particularly aberrational\" compared to other members of the admissions committee; she therefore reviewed the\nvoting patterns of other faculty members \"to try to get a sense of what was valuable.\" Hamilton, vol. 2 at 42-44.\n[43] Waiting list candidates were moderately over-represented in Wellborn's C and D Groups, suggesting some\ncorrelation between placement on the waiting list and an increased probability of admission. See Wellborn, vol. 1\nat 211. Of the 98 Group C and D selections, 44 received one vote in discretionary zone screening in 1992. In the\nCourt's opinion, this correlation is not strong enough to support the inference that all individuals on the waiting list\nwould be more likely to receive offers of admission in a race-neutral world.\n[44] According to Wellborn's supplemental report, these individuals had TI scores of 202 and 198, respectively,\nand thus would probably have been presumptively admitted under a constitutional system. See D-521.\n[45] In Group A, one applicant graduated in the 95th percentile of her class from Washington University, a college\nwith an LSAT mean score of 36, see D-5-33; another applicant graduated from the University of Texas in the 90th\npercentile of her class, see D-539. In Group C, two applicants graduated from Trinity University where they were\nin the 90th and 86th percentiles of their classes, see D-567 and D-583; another applicant graduated in the 94th\npercentile of her class at George Washington University, a 33 LSAT mean school, see D-581.\n[46] In addition to the Berkeley and Plan II applicants described supra (D-524 and D-529), one applicant from\nGroup C graduated from Rice with a GPA of 3.40 and had an LSAT score in the 83rd percentile. That applicant\nhad also completed one semester at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas with a GPA of\n3.77. See D-547. Another Group C applicant had a GPA of 2.99 from Rice with a degree in architecture and an\nLSAT score in the 86th percentile; the applicant also earned a master's degree from Princeton and had been\nworking as an architect for many years. See D-605. The final Group C applicant was an engineering major from\nSouthern Methodist University with a 3.07 GPA and had an LSAT score in the 90th percentile. See D-594.\n[47] A small number of applicants attended under-graduate institutions that were too small to provide the\nstatistical sampling needed for LSDAS to compile the college LSAT mean. In those instances, Wellborn looked at\na \"ribbon\" showing the distribution (in terms of percentile rank) of LSAT scores by students who took the LSAT\nfrom that institution. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 44, 103-04.\n[48] This criticism, in the Court's opinion, is puzzling coming from the plaintiffs. At the first trial, the plaintiffs\nrepeatedly emphasized the relative strength of their TI scores 00 a purely objective factor that did not account for\n97\nthe quality of the applicant's undergraduate institution or curriculum 00 as compared to minority admittees. See,\n97\ne.g., Hopwood, vol. 2 at 195.\n[49] Carvell contends that improvement in grades is an \"important\" criteria simply because the defendants listed\nthis factor first in their answers to interrogatories regarding subjective criteria to be considered in admissions.\nThis argument is absurd. Likewise, the Court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that reviewers must grant preferential\nconsideration to subjective factors such as age or work experience because the admissions committee lists such\nfactors as criteria to consider in determining whether a particular applicant should be admitted. For instance,\nJohanson (unlike Hopwood's other reviewers) reacted negatively to the fact that Hopwood had worked\nsubstantially during college; he viewed it as evidence she earned her undergraduate degree on \"a slow track.\" \nSee 1994 trial transcript, Johanson, vol. 5 at 15-16. The Court declines Hopwood's invitation to find that\nJohanson abused his discretion in failing to consider her work experience a \"plus\" factor.\n[50] Although this applicant, like Hopwood, had a significant number of hours from a junior college, he completed\nhis associate's degree in two and a half years, had a distinguished military career in the Marine Corps, had a\nstrong personal statement in which he recounted overcoming an abusive childhood, and, importantly, transferred\nto a challenging undergraduate institution (the University of Texas) following junior college. He also had several\nstrong faculty letters of recommendation. See D-538; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 99.\n\n[51] Hopwood and Carvell also identify three files (D-605, D-619, and D-632) they contend should not be\nconsidered under a hypothetical admissions system because they were untimely applications. In fact, only two\napplications (D-605 and D-632) were considered untimely; the other application (D-619) lacked a transcript, an\nerror that was attributed to the undergraduate institution, not the applicant. The evidence establishes the law\nschool nevertheless considered all three applications on their merits in 1992, and the Court therefore sees no\nreason to exclude them from consideration in this case. Even if the Court were to exclude these files from\nconsideration, the Court's conclusions regarding the plaintiffs' chances for admission would not be disturbed.\n[52] Indeed, at trial the plaintiffs identified only 4 such applicants out of the 936 applicants who were offered\nadmission in 1992 00 less than 0.5%. See Sharlot, vol. 2 at 3-6; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 221.\n97\n[53] It might be the case, for instance, that one or more of these individuals were admitted because their parents\nwere influential alumni or generous benefactors of the University of Texas, a practice specifically condoned by the\nFifth Circuit. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 946 (\"An admissions process may also consider an applicant's home\nstate or relationship to school alumni.\").\n[54] In 1992, Johanson reviewed Hopwood's application file twice-first when he pulled her application from the\npresumptive admit zone and a second time as a part of the initial waiting list screening. See Johanson\nDeclaration D-332.\n[55] Hopwood contends the law school should be equitably estopped from arguing that the absence of a personal\nstatement and letters of recommendation in her file weakened her application because of written and oral\nstatements allegedly made by representatives and employees of the law school. Hopwood claims that in May\n1991 and January 1992 she spoke to unnamed individuals in the law school's admissions office at length about\nthe information required to complete her application. Hopwood claims these individuals told her that, based on\nher GPA and LSAT score, she would be within the pool of applicants who would be \"automatically admitted.\"\nHopwood claims that these representations were confirmed by the law school's 1992 bulletin, which indicated\nthat \"approximately 55% of the available admissions are automatically granted\" to candidates reflecting\n\"outstanding\" GPAs and LSAT scores, see P-172. Based on these statements, Hopwood declined to \"embellish\"\nher application. This contention is so frivolous it barely merits discussion. Even assuming the statements were\nmade and that the law school and the State of Texas should be bound by them, the Court finds that any reliance\non those statements was unreasonable. Hopwood did not know what the presumptive admission line would be\nprior to submitting her application; in fact, the line was not lowered to include Hopwood's application until March\n1992, well into the admissions process.\n[56] Although Elliot provided two professional letters of recommendation, Johanson described them as \"not\noverwhelmingly impressive.\" See Johanson Declaration D-332. Additionally, Wellborn testified that members of\nthe admissions committee generally tend to focus more heavily on letters of recommendation from faculty\nmembers as opposed to employers because faculty members \"are usually commenting on students in an\nacademic environment, which is what we are looking for.\" Wellborn, vol. 1 at 74.\n[57] For the record, the law school's 1992 admissions procedures did not impose quotas or grant admissions\npreferences on the basis of sex. Mr. Elliot was mistaken.\n[58] Admittedly, the Court used a poor choice of words when it wrote, \"Elliot was not notified of his admission to\nlaw school.\" See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 566. The Court recognizes that the sentence could lead one to the\nimplicit conclusion that an offer of admission had been contemplated by the law school but simply not\ncommunicated to Elliot. The Court did not intend for readers to reach that conclusion and regrets the error.\n[59] The University of Houston-Downtown is a separate campus from the University of Houston-Main Campus,\nand the two campuses therefore have different LSAT college means (26 and 30, respectively).\n[60] Rogers argues the fact that he was dismissed from the University of Texas as an undergraduate is not a valid\nreason to deny him admission to the law school. Rogers identifies one individual who also was dismissed from\nthe University of Texas as an undergraduate but who was nevertheless admitted in 1992. See P-304. If anything,\nthe individual identified by Rogers is the exception that proves the rule. See Gergen Declaration, D-335 (\"[I]t\n\nwould take a great deal of redemption to overcome the disastrous performance as an undergraduate at [the\nUniversity of Texas].\"). That applicant had a TI score of 204, received an LSAT score in the 99th percentile, and\nreturned to the University of Texas at Austin where he participated in the history honors program. See P-304. The\napplicant graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.10 and received almost all A's after his return from academic\ndismissal. In addition, the applicant provided 3 exceptional faculty letters of recommendation. One professor\ndescribes the applicant as one of the 10 best of the 10,000 students he had ever taught. See P-304. Another\ndescribes him as better than the 2,500 students he had ever taught; the professor observed, \"[o]n reflection, I\nwish I had the nerve to ask him to grade the course rather than take it.\" See P-304. Frankly, Rogers's application\ndoes not compare.\n[61] Because the Fifth Circuit gave no weight to the Court's more conclusory finding in its first opinion that the\nplaintiffs did not prove their damages by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court finds it necessary in this\nopinion to provide very detailed and extensive findings regarding damages.\n[62] The defendants likewise object to any damage award in light of the Court's factual finding at the first trial that\nthe plaintiffs failed to prove any damages resulting from their rejections by the law school. Additionally, the\ndefendants argue they cannot be held liable for monetary damages because the State of Texas enacted its\nadmissions program in response to a court-ordered investigation of Texas's public higher education system by\nthe United States Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\") and the Department of Education. In the late 1970s, the OCR\nfound that Texas was in violation of Title VI for its failure to eliminate the vestiges of its former de jure segregation\nof public higher education. In an effort to comply with directives from the OCR, Texas instituted a plan to increase\nenrollment of blacks and Hispanics in public higher education. In June 1983, after years of negotiations between\nthe OCR and the State of Texas, the OCR conditionally found Texas in compliance with Title VI, but the OCR\nrequired Texas to continue to implement plans to increase minority enrollment. These plans paved the way for the\ncontinued receipt of federal funds for public higher education in Texas. See Hopwood I, 861 F.Supp. at 555-57\n(discussing the negotiations between the OCR and the State of Texas regarding Texas's failure to comply with\nTitle VI). Notwithstanding the factual validity of these two arguments, the Court complied with the instructions of\nthe Fifth Circuit.\n[63] As discussed more fully in Part IV(B) infra, Carvell was the only plaintiff who attended law school following\nhis rejection by the University of Texas.\n[64] Elliot and Rogers did not seek any mental anguish damages. See Elliot, vol. 3 at 269-71; P-322; Rogers, vol.\n2 at 96-99, 101-11.\n[65] This statement by the plaintiffs' lawyer is virtually an admission that the damages after the first trial result\nfrom the lawsuit itself, which damages, of course, are not compensable. The scope and measure of both\neconomic and emotional damages should have been the same after the May 1994 trial and post-appeal.\n[66] The defendants argue that the evidence Hopwood, Carvell, and Rogers presented on damages is legally\ninsufficient because they did not compute their future income stream using the below market discount rate\nmethod set forth in Culver v. Slater Boat Co., 722 F.2d 114 (5th Cir.1983),cert. denied, Reederei v. Byrd, 467\nU.S. 1252, 104 S.Ct. 3537, 82 L.Ed.2d 842 (1984); the Court did not consider this argument because it was not\nfactually persuaded that these plaintiffs suffered any economic damages.\n[67] The Fifth Circuit overruled the Court's determination that the defendants did not intentionally discriminate\nunder Title VI. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957.\n[68] The Court is not finding Hopwood incapable of passing the courses; to the contrary, to the degree Hopwood\nwould have been able to take and complete her courses, the Court believes she would have received a passing\ngrade.\n[69] Ruhter relied on the David J. White Survey for attorney salaries in private law firms in Dallas, Houston,\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Ruhter gave special consideration to attorney salaries in Texas\nbecause many graduates of the law school remain in Texas following graduation. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 254. He\nalso considered attorney salaries from the mid-Atlantic region because that is where Hopwood is currently living. \nSee Ruhter, vol. 2 at 253-54. For data on accountant salaries, Ruhter relied on the ROMAC Report.\n\n[70] Ruhter did not examine whether Hopwood could have mitigated her damages by enrolling in law school in\n1993, 1994, 1995, or 1996. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 65.\n[71] Even more troubling to the Court is Ruhter's failure to account for the benefits of not being a lawyer.\nPresumably one of the reasons for the salary differential is that, on average, lawyers tend to work longer, harder\nhours than accountants and require more years of education. It seems inherently unfair to award Hopwood the\nlifetime salary differential between accountant and attorney earnings without even attempting to take into account\nsuch quality of life issues.\n[72] Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (West 1994) (\"Title IX\"). Title IX\nprevents discrimination on the basis of sex by any education program or activity receiving federal funds. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1681(a).\n[73] Carvell was also \"upset\" and \"bothered\" by public statements made by the defendants and other state\nofficials during the pendency of this case. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 108. These damages, if they exist, are not\ncompensable.\n[74] Lees-Haley defines a \"stressor\" as an experience, either positive or negative, \"that usually involves change\nin the patient's life that's great enough that it requires some coping or adjustment.\" Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 192.\n[75] Employment in Dallas by private law firms (with their attendant high starting salaries) is one of the positive\nbenefits of graduating from SMU Law School, as the school purposefully seeks to place its graduates in the\nDallas law market.\n[76] When specifically questioned by his counsel at the May 1994 trial whether he was claiming any loss in\nearnings as a result of his rejection by the law school, Carvell explicitly stated he was not. See 1994 trial\ntranscript, Carvell, vol. 10 at 9-10.\n[77] To the extent Carvell implies he might have been considered for partnership track at Bickel & Brewer had he\ngraduated from the University of Texas, that proposition is ridiculous. One of the name partners of that firm is a\ngraduate of SMU Law School, so it is highly unlikely that members of the firm regard SMU law alumni\nunfavorably. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 124; D-653.\n[78] In any prestigious area of the law one examines, from top practitioners to Supreme Court Justices, few\npeople know which law school the individual attended, and, presumably, not all such individuals are graduates of\nthe University of Texas.\n[79] At trial, Rogers testified he sustained losses of approximately $382,000. See Rogers, vol. 2 at 95-96; P-325.\nBecause Rogers failed to supplement his interrogatory responses regarding the extent of his damages as\nrequired during discovery, the Court considered only his original request.\n[80] This last contention00that the State of Texas should pay for Rogers's poor business judgment 00sounds like a\n97 97\nbad joke and, perhaps, betrays a lack of analytical skills Rogers will sorely need if he intends to succeed in law\nschool.\n[81] The first set of attorneys' fee applications were filed on August 29, 1994. One application was submitted on\nbehalf of Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and WHS. Steven Smith sought compensation for 1,552 hours at $125 per\nhour plus $164.21 in expenses for a total of $194,164.21. Terral Smith sought compensation for 837.80 hours at\n$225 per hour for a total of $188,505.00. WHS sought compensation for 1,005.82 hours plus $151.09 in\nexpenses for a total of $171,104.34. The billing rates for WHS ranged from $95 to $200 per hour. The second\napplication, filed on behalf of CIR, sought $235,461.95 in fees for 1,444.94 hours of work and $64,526.19 in\nexpenses, for total compensation of $299,988.14. CIR's rates ranged from $125 to $230 per hour.\n[82] In their supplemental requests for attorneys fees filed on October 1, 1996, Hopwood and Carvell argue that\nthe original request for fees should be adjusted in order to compensate for the delay in payment. The adjusted\nfigures are $362,250.19 for CIR (representing current rates of $150 to $280 per hour) and $196,471.84 for WHS\n(representing a current rate for Wallace at $250 per hour).\n\n[83] WHS did not represent any of the plaintiffs on appeal, but Joseph Wallace (now with the law firm of Harris &\nBush) consulted with GDC, CIR, and Terral Smith during the appeal on a limited basis.\n[84] The post-appeal applications were filed beginning in October 1996. One application for attorneys' fees was\nfiled on behalf of CIR, GDC, and Wallace. CIR seeks total compensation of $243,421.68, consisting of\n$195,897.50 in fees for 909.8 hours, $17,638.56 in expenses, and $29,885.62 in interest. GDC seeks\ncompensation of $287,925.00 in fees for 1,010.5 hours of work and $4,189.87 in expenses for a total of\n$292,114.87. GDC's hourly rates range from $450 to $275 per hour. Wallace seeks compensation for 18 hours at\n$250 per hour, plus expenses of $70.30 and interest of $25.50, for a total of $4,595.50. Terral Smith submitted a\npost-appeal application seeking compensation for 155.8 hours at $225 per hour for a total of $35,055 in fees.\nSteven Smith's post-appeal application seeks compensation for 306.75 hours at $125 per hour plus $607.76 in\nexpenses for a total of $38,951.51.\n[85] For instance, the plaintiffs argue they are entitled to such fees because they relied on and cited to press\ncoverage in their motion for attorneys' fees to demonstrate the impact of the results the plaintiffs achieved in the\nFifth Circuit. The significance of the Fifth Circuit opinion did not need to be explained to this Court by the media.\n[86] The following is the breakdown, by firm and/or attorney, of time spent dealing with the media during the trial\nphase of the case: Steven Smith (4.50 hours) and Terral Smith (1 hour). The following is the breakdown of the\nappellate hours: GCD (48.25 hours), CIR (5.90 hours), Terral Smith (7.10 hours) and Steven Smith (6.75 hours).\n[87] The extent of the defendants' involvement in the intervention was as follows: On January 10, 1994, the\ndefendants filed a one-sentence response to the proposed intervention in this Court, stating that they \"do not\nobject to the intervention.\" On February 16, 1994, the defendants supported a motion filed by the intervenors in\nthe Fifth Circuit to expedite the appeal of the proposed intervention, stating \"Defendants believe that the\nintervention would be beneficial to an appropriate resolution of the litigation and believe it to be important to\nresolve the intervention issue expeditiously.\" On May 3, 1994, the defendants submitted a letter to the Fifth\nCircuit case manager indicating that they did not oppose intervention and that \"the adverse parties in this appeal\nare the plaintiffs and the potential intervenors.\" See Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, Plaintiffs' Second Supplemental\nMemorandum in Further Support of Attorneys' Fees, October 11, 1994. On February 1, 1995, the defendants\nsubmitted another letter, this time to the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit, indicating that they did not intend to file a brief\non the issue of intervention but reiterating that intervention \"would be beneficial to the final resolution\" of the\ncase. See Exhibit K, Supplemental Appendix, Supplemental Memorandum of Plaintiffs Hopwood and Carvell in\nsupport of Attorneys' Fees, October 1, 1996. These actions are insufficient to support the plaintiffs' contention that\nthe defendants participated in the intervention.\n[88] The breakdown of trial hours: CIR (127.60 hours), Terral Smith (27.80 hours), WHS (18.75 hours), and\nSteven Smith (4.75 hours). The breakdown of appellate hours: CIR (302.57 hours), GDC (23 hours), and Terral\nSmith (12.90 hours).\n[89] Travel time during the trial phase of the case is 153.25 hours for WHS, 15.75 hours for Steven Smith, 12\nhours for Terral Smith, and 10 hours for CIR. There are 23.50 appellate hours for GDC and 12.55 appellate hours\nfor CIR relating to travel. The numbers reflected here do not reflect the 50% reduction.\n[90] Given the time sequence, these hours were listed in the plaintiffs' supplemental applications for attorneys'\nfees. These hours will therefore be subtracted from the \"appellate hours\" calculation. The breakdown for each\nattorney and/or firm is CIR (151 .10 hours), Steven Smith (52.50 hours), and GDC (45.50 hours).\n[91] As evidence of billing judgment, the CIR claims it excluded from its fees application time spent on\nfundraising, publicity, efforts to obtain additional counsel, expenses related to the turnover of attorneys assigned\nto the case, compensation on behalf of a pro bono attorney who conducted a deposition, and fees related to the\nsubmission of the fee application. Except for the latter two items, these hours are not compensable. Therefore,\nthe Court does not consider the majority of these exclusions to be evidence of billing judgment. See Walker, 99\nF.3d at 769-70.\n\n[92] CIR, for instance, submitted one entry labeled \"Read Defendant-Appellee's brief\" which the attorney claims\ntook 4.50 hours at a cost of $810.\n[93] For instance, GDC's records are replete with such time entries as \"REVIEW AND REVISE BRIEF,\" \"LEGAL\nRESEARCH RE 5TH CIRCUIT ISSUES,\" \"REVIEW OF MATERIALS,\" and \"TC W/MR ROSMAN,\" all of which\nare simply too vague and brief to inform the Court precisely what work was done. CIR had similar entries, such\nas \"Review Court Filings,\" as did WHS, which had the following imaginative and informative entries: \"Research\"\nand \"Trial Preparation.\" Furthermore, GDC, Terral Smith, CIR, and WHS did not separate the activities for each\nday and instead lumped all work together under one heading. The Fifth Circuit has specifically and repeatedly\ndenounced such billing practices. See, e.g., Walker, 99 F.3d at 773 (calling identical billing practices \"woefully\ninadequate to support any fee application ... [because] ... no responsible client would accept [such] records as\ncapable of supporting a bill\").\n[94] Wallace submitted only 18 post-trial hours which primarily consisted of reviewing motions and court orders.\nThese hours were of minimal or no value to the plaintiffs and will be reduced to 3.50 hours, the time he\nreasonably spent on the plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees.\n[95] Other than the pleadings related to their requests for attorneys' fees, a brief requested by the Fifth Circuit\nregarding the Adarand decision, and two briefs related to the defendants' failed petition for writ of certiorari, all of\nCIR's post-trial filings relate to the intervention attempts. See Exhibit J, Supplemental Memorandum in Support of\nMotion for Attorneys' Fees, Supplemental Appendix (Part I), October 1, 1996.\n[96] The undersigned has been privileged to try lawsuits against some of the most competent trial lawyers in the\nUnited States from 1965 to 1991 before taking a seat on the federal bench. The undersigned has never seen a\nlawyer worth $450 per hour or $4,500 per day00only successful promoters.\n97\n[97] Terral Smith, Wallace, Wheeler, and Olson have over 20 years experience; McDonald, Rosman, and Cox\nhave over 10 years experience; and Steven Smith, Troy, Bader, Shea, Hungar, Scott, and Nelson have less than\n10 years experience. The Court was provided with no information regarding the years of experience of Harris,\nMulloy, or Wilson.\n[98] Steven Smith untimely submitted evidence that the prevailing market rates in Austin range from $123 to $150\nper hour for an attorney of his skill and experience. The remaining attorneys only submitted evidence of the\nprevailing market rate in Washington, D.C. and Virginia. WHS's evidence establishes a prevailing market rate for\ncivil rights litigation at $200 per hour. CIR submitted evidence that the prevailing market rates range from $90 to\n$190 per hour for associates and from $195 to $350 per hour for partners. GDC submitted evidence that hourly\nrates range from $90 to $230 for associates and $195 to $525 for partners. The rates submitted by CIR and GDC\nonly reflect the general hourly rates charged to clients in Washington, D.C. and do not purport to reflect the\nmarket rate for work performed in federal civil rights litigation.\n[99] The Court has never granted an application for attorney's fees with a billing rate higher than $200 per hour\nwithout the agreement of the parties so stipulating.\n[100] Three other WHS associates (all of whom have rates lower than $100 per hour) performed a total of one\nhour of work on the case. For the sake of simplicity, the Court will assign this hour of work to Wilson in calculating\nthe lodestar.\n[101] The defendants also object to over $7,000 for the deposition costs and travel expenses related to the\nplaintiffs' expert witness at trial. Under § 1988(c), it is within the Court's discretion to include such expenses as\npart of a reasonable attorney's fee for cases brought pursuant to § 1981. 42 U.S.C. § 1988(c). The Court declines\nto deduct this expense.\n[102] The Court derived the prime rate from a booklet entitled \"Selected Interest Rates\" published by the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System. For the sake of simplicity, the Court applied the average prime rate\nper annum (simple) for the relevant time period rather than applying a different prime rate for each quarter.\n\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The Court has no basis whatsoever to set any hearings with \nregard to any past or proposed alleged misconduct or, behalf of any defendant. Therefore, there are no live issues to be \ndetermined in this case. \nThe Court regrets, as do all parties, that this case was not finally determined by the United States Supreme Court, \nbut the world is not a perfect place, and all things, especially old cases, most come to an end.

Hopwood, Douglas W. Carvell, Kenneth R. Elliot, and David A. \nRogers filed suit under 42 U.S.C. ßß 1981 and 1983 (West 1994) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \nß 2000d (West 1994) (\"Title VI\"), 1 against the defendants the State of Texas, the University of Texas Board of Regents, \nthe University, of Texas, the University of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\"), and various University of Texas \n \n\n \nofficials in their official capacities. 2 The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and \npunitive damages. The Court held an eight-day bench trial in the case in May 1994. \n \n1   Sections 1981 and 1983 are the vehicles by which the plaintiffs assert violations of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Title VI provides in relevant part: \n  \n   No person in the United states shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be ex-\ncluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under \nany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. \n \n  \n42 U.S.C. ß 2000d. \n [**5]  \n2   Many of the University of Texas officials sued by the plaintiffs in 1992 are no longer associated with the \nUniversity of Texas system and/or the law school. Defendants Bernard Rapopart, Ellen C. Temple, Lowell H. \nLeberman, Jr., Robert Cruikshank, Thomas O. Hicks, Zan W. Holmes, Jr., Tom Loeffler, Mario E. Ramirez, and \nMartha E. Smiley were sued in their official capacities as members of the University of Texas Board of Regents. \nDefendant Robert M. Berdahl was sued in his official capacity as President of the University of Texas at Austin; \nthe current interim President is Peter T. Flawn. Defendant Mark Yudof was sued in his official capacity as the \nDean of the University of Texas School of Law; M. Michael Sharlot, an Assistant Dean of the law school in \n1992, has since replaced Yudof as Dean. Defendant Stanley M. Johanson was sued in his official capacity as \nChair of the University of Texas School of Law Admissions Committee and remains in that capacity to this date. \nOn August 19, 1994, the Court issued its memorandum opinion in Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551 \n(W.D. Tex. 1994) [**6]  (\"Hopwood I\"). In deference to controlling Supreme Court precedent, the Court declined to \ndeclare the law school's use of racial preferences in its admissions system unconstitutional per se, see id. at 553-54, and \ninstead applied strict scrutiny to the law school's admissions system, see id. at 568-69. Relying primarily on Justice \nPowell's opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 \n(1978), the Court found that the law school's use of racial preferences for the purpose of achieving a diverse student \nbody served a compelling state interest under the Fourteenth Amendment. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 569-571. \nAdditionally, the Court found that the remedial nature of the admissions process, in which racial classifications were \nused as a means of overcoming the present effects of past race discrimination, served a compelling governmental inter-\nest. See id. at 571-73. The Court ultimately concluded, however, that the law school's use of separate admissions proce-\ndures for minorities and nonminorities 3 was not narrowly tailored to achieve those compelling interests because the \nprocess prevented any [**7]  meaningful comparative evaluation among applicants of different races. See id. at 573-\n579. The Court therefore entered declaratory judgment that the law school's 1992 admissions procedures violated the \nFourteenth Amendment. See id. at 582. \n \n3   The 1992 admissions procedures favored only black and Mexican-American applicants. Other minority \ngroups, including Hispanics not of Mexican-American descent, were not granted preferences in admission. In \nthis opinion, the Court loosely uses the term \"minority\" to refer to blacks and Mexican-Americans; the term \n\"nonminority\" is used to refer to whites and non-preferred minorities. \nThe Court then considered whether any of the four plaintiffs was denied admission in 1992 as a result of the consti-\ntutionally impermissible method in which the law school considered race in its admissions procedures. In determining \nwhich party bore the burden of persuasion on that issue, the Court adopted a burden-shifting scheme similar to that used \nin employment discrimination cases brought [**8]  pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ß \n2000e (West 1994) (\"Title VII\"), and placed the ultimate burden of persuasion on the plaintiffs. 4 See  [*878]  861 F. \nSupp. at 579-80. The Court found that the plaintiffs failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that they \nwould have been offered admission to the law school under a constitutional admissions process. See id. at 580-82. The \nCourt therefore declined to award the plaintiffs injunctive relief (that is, an immediate order of admission) or compensa-\ntory damages. 5 See id. at 582-83. Furthermore, given the undisputed remedial goals of the admissions program, as well \nas the fact that the law school adopted the program in a good faith effort to comply with federal guidelines under Title \nVI, the Court declined to issue an award of punitive damages. See id. at 583. Finally, because the law school had sub-\nstantially modified its admissions procedures by the end of the trial to provide for individual comparison among minor-\n \n\n \nity and nonminority applicants (thereby remedying the infirmity, identified by the Court in its opinion), the Court de-\nclined to issue any permanent injunctive relief against the law [**9]  school. See id. at 582. \n \n4   In the Title VII arena, the Supreme Court has developed a burden-shifting scheme to be used when there is no \ndirect evidence of an employer's racial animus. See, e.g., Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. \n248, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. \n1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). The employee bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of dis-\ncrimination. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253-54; 101 S. Ct. at 1094. If successful, the burden of production shifts \nto the defendant to establish legitimate, nondiscriminatory grounds for the adverse employment action. See id. at \n254-55; 101 S. Ct. at 1094-95. If such grounds are shown, the burden shifts back to the employee to establish \nthat the reasons proffered by the defendant are merely pretext for unlawful discrimination. See id. at 255-56; 101 \nS. Ct. at 1095. The burden of persuasion remains on the employee at all times. See id. at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1093. \nIn this case, the Court held that the plaintiffs established a prima facie case of discrimination by proving that the \n1992 admissions process was constitutionally flawed. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 580. The plaintiffs failed \nto persuade the Court, however, that the law school's proffered reasons for the plaintiffs' non-admission were \npretextual. See id. at 581-82. \n [**10]  \n5   In view of the unequal treatment to which the plaintiffs were subjected, however, the Court granted nominal \ndamages in the amount of one dollar to each plaintiff and allowed the plaintiffs to reapply to the law school in \n1995 without incurring any administrative costs or fees. See id. at 582-83. \nA three-member panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the Court's decision in part in \nHopwood v. State of Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1033, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1095, 116 S. Ct. 2581 \n(1996) (\"Hopwood II\"). 6 The Fifth Circuit declared that the law school's use of racial preferences served no compelling \nstate interests under the Fourteenth Amendment. 7 See id. at 941-55. The divided Fifth Circuit panel therefore directed \nthe law school not to use race as a factor in admissions, although it declined to order any permanent injunctive relief to \nthat effect. See id. at 958. Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit disagreed with the Court's allocation of the burden of proof on \nthe issue of causation--whether any of the four plaintiffs [**11]  would have been admitted to the law school under a \nconstitutional system. Using the burden-shifting scheme of Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. \nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977), the Fifth Circuit determined the law school bore the burden \nof proof on that issue because the plaintiffs had successfully established the unconstitutionality of the admissions sys-\ntem. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 955-57. \n \n6   Over the strenuous and critical objections of Chief Judge Politz and Circuit Judges King, Weiner, Benavides, \nStewart, Parker, and Dennis, the Fifth Circuit declined to reconsider the case en banc. See Hopwood v. States of \nTexas, 84 F.3d 720 (5th Cir. 1996). \n7   Finding no compelling state interest, the Fifth Circuit did not reach the second inquiry of whether the af-\nfirmative action program was narrowly tailored. See 78 F.3d at 955. \nOn remand, the Fifth Circuit directed the Court to reconsider two issues. First, the panel directed the Court to apply \nthe [**12]  proper burden and to reevaluate whether any of the four plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law \nschool in the absence of admissions procedures which took into account an applicant's race or ethnicity. Second, the \nFifth Circuit instructed the Court to \"revisit\" the issue of damages in the event the law school fails to meet its burden: \n\"In the event that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would \nnot have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions  [*879]  system, the court is to award to that \nplaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\" 8 Id. at 957. \n \n8   The Court need not reconsider the issue of punitive damages, as the Fifth Circuit upheld the Court's determi-\nnation that punitive damages were inappropriate in this case. See id. at 959. \nIn accordance with the Fifth Circuit's instructions on remand, this case was tried before the Court on March 31 and \nApril 2, 3, and 7, 1997. Having carefully considered [**13]  the evidence presented at both trials and the arguments and \nbriefing of counsel, the Court finds the law school has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that none of the plain-\ntiffs would have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional admissions system. In the event any of the plain-\ntiffs successfully appeals that decision, the Court makes several alternative factual findings and legal conclusions re-\ngarding the issue of damages. Finally, the Court enters its findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the attor-\nneys' fees to which the plaintiffs are entitled as prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C. ß 1988 (West 1994). \n \n\n \n \nII.  \nThe admissions process employed by the law school in 1992 and the plaintiffs' qualifications for admission are \nsummarized here for the convenience of the reader and to provide a context for the opinions of the defendants' expert on \ncausation, Professor Olin Guy Wellborn, III. 9 In 1992, the law school received 4,494 applications for admission to fill \napproximately 500 available seats. 10 See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 563; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935 n.2. Given the \nrather large volume of applications it receives, the law school [**14]  devised and for several decades has used an ad-\nministrative procedure by which applicants are categorized according to their Texas Index (\"TI\") score. An applicant's \nTI score is calculated by the Law School Data Assembly Service (\"LSDAS\"). It is a composite number reflecting both \nthe applicant's grade point average (\"GPA\") and score on the Law School Aptitude Test (\"LSAT\"), and it is generally \nconsidered a rough predictor of one's probability of success in law school. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 557 n.9; \nHopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935 & n.1. In 1992, the law school placed each applicant, as dictated by his or her TI score, into \none of the following three categories: presumptive admit, presumptive deny, and the discretionary zone. See Hopwood I, \n861 F. Supp. at 558; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935. \n \n9   The 1992 admissions procedures and the evolution of the law school's admissions procedures since the 1960s \nare explained in greater detail in the Court's first opinion, see Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 557-563, as are the \nplaintiffs' qualifications for admission to the law school, see id. at 564-567. \n [**15]  \n10   Slightly less than half of the applications the law school received were submitted by Texas residents. See \nHopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n.22. In 1992, the University of Texas Board of Regents required an entering \nlaw school class of at least 500 students, and Texas law mandated that at least 85% of the entering class be \nTexas residents (the latter figure has since decreased to 80%). See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 563; Hopwood II, \n78 F.3d at 935 n.2. \nThe admissions committee in 1992 comprised nine professors, two assistant deans, and four students.  Hopwood I, \n861 F. Supp. at 560. Three members of the admissions committee, Professor Stanley Johanson and Assistant Deans \nSusana Aleman and Laquita Hamilton, formed a subcommittee to review the files of minority applicants. 11 See id. As \nchair of the admissions committee, Johnson had the responsibility of setting the presumptive admission and presumptive \ndenial lines throughout the admissions process. 12 See id. He set the first of several presumptive admission lines in late \nJanuary 1992 and began extending offers at [**16]  that time to ensure that the most desirable applicants received offers \nas quickly as possible. See id. at 561. Because the law school application deadline was not until February 1, 1992--and \nthus the  [*880]  quality of the entire applicant pool had not yet been defined--Johanson set this initial presumptive ad-\nmit line relatively high. 13 See id. at 560-61. Johanson then reviewed the files within the presumptive admission category \nto determine whether the applicant's TI score was inflated by high grades in a noncompetitive university and/or major, \nor whether there was some other questionable aspect to the applicant's file. See id. at 561. \"Those applications with a \nhigh TI reflecting a high LSAT and high grades in a rigorous major at a leading undergraduate institution were admitted \nby Johanson, who had unilateral authority to admit any applicant in this category without further consultation with the \nfull admissions committee.\" Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561. Questionable files (roughly five to ten percent of all pre-\nsumptive admit files) were placed in the discretionary zone for further review. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936. \n \n11   Although members of the minority subcommittee were supposed to review nonminority files as well, testi-\nmony from the first trial established that Aleman did not review any nonminority files in 1992. See Hopwood I, \n861 F. Supp. at 562. \n [**17]  \n12   Because of the limited number of seats available for nonresidents, Johanson set the presumptive admission \nand denial lines at a higher level for nonresidents than for residents. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n.22. \n13   \"Johanson's setting of these scores was a process that evolved over the course of the admissions process \nbased on the pool of applicants, the number of offers, and the number of acceptances. Initially, the numbers were \nset high and lowered as the yield from offers and composition of the entering class began to develop.\" Hopwood \nI, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n.24. \nEssentially the same procedure occurred at the other end of the spectrum. Johanson set the initial presumptive de-\nnial line, and one or two members of the admissions committee then reviewed all of the applications in this category. \nSee Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561. Applicants with TI scores that understated their competitive standing relative to \nthe rest of the pool were upgraded to the discretionary zone. See id. Johanson testified at the first trial that he could not \n \n\n \nrecall the number of presumptive [**18]  deny files that were upgraded in 1992, although generally twenty to forty files \nwere moved to the discretionary zone as a result of this review. See id. The discretionary zone, therefore, comprised \n\"those applicants whose TIs fell between the presumptive denial line and the presumptive admission line, those appli-\ncants who Johanson had moved down from the presumptive admission category, and those applicants who reviewers \nhad moved up from the presumptive denial category.\" Id. \nThe law school's admissions procedures treated minority applicants differently in two ways. First, the presumptive \nadmissions and denial lines were lower for minorities than they were for nonminorities. 14 By March 1992, the presump-\ntive admission line for resident nonminorities was lowered from 202 to 199, while the presumptive denial line was set at \n192. See id. at 561-62. For Mexican-Americans, however, the presumptive admission line was lowered from 196 to 189, \nand for blacks this line was lowered from 192 to 189. For both minority groups, the presumptive denial line was 179. \nSee id. at 562; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936. Second, minority and nonminority files within their respective discretionary \n[**19]  zones were segregated and subjected to different procedures of review. The minority subcommittee was to meet \nas a group to review and discuss all the minority files. Although the minority subcommittee provided the full admis-\nsions committee with summaries of the files they considered to be good candidates, the subcommittee's admissions de-\ncisions were virtually final. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 562. Nonminority applications, on the other hand, were \nseparated into weighted stacks of thirty files, and each stack was reviewed by a random three-member panel of the ad-\nmissions committee. 15 See id. Rather than review the piles as a group, each member of the panel conducted an inde-\npendent and secret screening of the stack of thirty files and voted to offer admission to an average of nine applicants \nfrom the stack. 16 See id.  [*881]  Johanson then tallied the number of votes each applicant received within his or her \nstack of thirty. Applicants receiving two or three votes were offered admission, applicants receiving no votes were im-\nmediately denied admission, and applicants receiving one vote were offered a position on the waiting list. See id. \n \n14   During the preliminary review process in January 1992, however, Johanson reviewed minority and nonmi-\nnority files together. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n. 23. \n [**20]  \n15   The law school recently discarded the piles-of-thirty approach in favor of a smaller admissions committee \ncomprising three members. All three members of the admissions committee review each application. See Well-\nborn, vol. 1 at 51, 246-47. (All references to the trial transcript in this opinion are from the second trial unless \notherwise noted.) \n16   There were 18 stacks in the nonminority discretionary zone. Seventeen stacks contained 30 application files; \nthe remaining stack comprised only 16 files. Each committee member was required to screen 5 stacks. See Hop-\nwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 562 n.26 & 27. \nThe plaintiffs were each reviewed by a three-member panel in the nonminority discretionary zone screening, and all \nwere considered Texas residents by the admissions committee. Hopwood received an associate's degree in accounting \nfrom Montgomery County Community College in 1984, and she earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from Califor-\nnia State University-Sacramento in 1988. She graduated with a GPA of 3.80 and had an LSAT score in the 83rd percen-\ntile. 17 See Hopwood I, 861 [**21]  F. Supp. at 564; P-145. Although Hopwood had a TI score of 199 which, by March \n1992, placed her just within the presumptive admit line, Johanson concluded her GPA overstated her educational back-\nground and therefore downgraded her file to the discretionary zone. See id. at 564. Carvell, Elliot and Rogers each had a \nTI score of 197. Carvell attended Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in \npolitical science in 1991. He had a GPA of 3.28 and an average LSAT score in the 76th percentile. 18 See id. at 566-67; \nP-151. Elliot graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Texas in 1984, where he earned a \nGPA of 2.98, and he scored in the 95th percentile on the LSAT. Following graduation, he became a certified public ac-\ncountant (\"CPA\") and worked for various state agencies in Texas as an auditor or examiner. See id. at 565-66, P-153. \nRogers earned an undergraduate degree in professional writing from the University of Houston-Downtown in 1990. In \nthe early to mid-1980s, he attended the University of Texas, where he was placed on academic probation once and dis-\nmissed twice for poor scholastic performance. He had [**22]  a cumulative GPA of 3.13 and an LSAT score in the 94th \npercentile. Rogers earned a master's degree in professional writing from the University of Southern California in 1992. \nSee Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 567; P-171. By contrast, the median GPA for white students in the 1992 entering class \nwas 3.56, and the median LSAT score was in the 91st percentile. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936-37 & n.7. For all stu-\ndents (minority and nonminority) in the 1992 entering class, the median GPA was 3.52, while the median LSAT score \nwas in the 89th percentile. See id. \n \n \n\n \n17   In 1992, LSDAS was in the process of changing the LSAT scoring system from a two-digit system to a \nthree-digit system. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n. 25; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936 n. 5. For sake of con-\nsistency with the Fifth Circuit decision, the TI scores reported in this opinion reflect only the three-digit scoring \nsystem. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 936 n.5. With respect to LSAT scores, the Court refers to the applicants' \npercentile rank on the exam rather than to the applicant's two- or three-digit score in order to draw a more accu-\nrate comparison among the applicants. \n [**23]  \n18   Carvell took the LSAT twice, once under the two-digit system and again under the three-digit system. He \nscored in the 61st percentile on his first exam and in the 91st percentile on his second exam. P-151. Carvell's TI \nscore of 197 only reflects his higher LSAT score in the 91st percentile. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 71. The Court's \nfirst opinion, which indicates that Carvell's TI score of 197 reflects his averaged LSAT score, see Hopwood I, \n861 F. Supp. at 566 n.47, is in error. \nHopwood and Carvell each received one vote in screening, were offered positions on the waiting list, and were \neventually denied admission to the law school in Spring 1992. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 564-66. Elliot and \nRogers received no votes in screening and were immediately notified of their rejection in April 1992. 19 See id. at 565-\n67. By the end of the admissions process, the law school had extended offers to 936 resident and nonresident applicants. \nSee id. at 563 n.32. Of the 637 offers extended to Texas residents, 96 went to blacks and Mexican-Americans and 541 \nwent to whites and nonpreferred [**24]  minorities. See D-519. The plaintiffs were therefore among over 3,500 indi-\nviduals, including approximately 1,500 Texas residents,  [*882]  who were denied admission to the law school in 1992. \n \n19   As explained in further detail in Part III(B) infra, the law school reconsidered Elliot's application for admis-\nsion following Elliot's initial rejection in April 1992. \n \nIII.  \nThe Fifth Circuit characterizes Mt. Healthy as devising \"a test of 'causation' that place[s] the burden of proving no \nharm on the defendant\" when the plaintiff establishes the defendant intended to discriminate or otherwise acted uncon-\nstitutionally. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 956. The Court respectfully suggests that the Mt. Healthy framework is inap-\nplicable to this case and the plaintiffs should retain the burden of proof. In Mt. Healthy, an untenured teacher claimed a \nschool board's decision not to rehire him was the result of the comments he had made on a radio show. See Mt. Healthy, \n429 U.S. at 281-3, 97 S. Ct. at 573-74. [**25]  Although the board conceded the comments had influenced its decision \nnot to rehire the teacher, the board asserted the teacher would not have been rehired in any event because of legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reasons unrelated to the exercise of his First Amendment rights. \nThe district court found that the teacher's comments were protected by the First Amendment and that they played a \n\"substantial part\" in the board's decision not to rehire him. See id. at 283, 97 S. Ct. at 574. The district court ordered the \nteacher's reinstatement, which ultimately resulted in his receiving tenure, and the circuit court affirmed the trial court's \nfindings and conclusions. See id. at 283-86, 97 S. Ct. at 574-75. Mt. Healthy was unique in that it presented the Su-\npreme Court with a \"mixed motives\" case in which the governmental entity admitted it considered both legitimate and \nillegitimate factors in reaching its employment decision, in contrast to the typical \"pretext\" case in which the only issue \nis whether any improper or discriminatory motive exists. 20 Therefore, the question before the Supreme Court was \nwhether the plaintiff had necessarily shown a constitutional violation justifying [**26]  remedial action simply by estab-\nlishing that the protected conduct was a \"substantial\" factor in the board's decision not to rehire him. See id. at 285, 97 \nS. Ct. at 575. \n \n20   In his concurring opinion in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1795, 104 L. Ed. \n2d 268 (1989), a case in which the Supreme Court applied the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting scheme to a Title VII \nsex discrimination case, Justice White explained the distinction between a \"mixed-motives\" and \"pretext\" case: \n  \n   The Court has made it clear that 'mixed-motives' cases, such as the present one, are different \nfrom pretext cases such as McDonnell Douglas and Burdine. In pretext cases, the issue is whether \neither illegal or legal motives, but not both, were the true motives behind the decision. In mixed-\nmotives cases, however, there is no one 'true' motive behind the decision. Instead, the decision is \na result of multiple factors, at least one of which is legitimate. . . . The showing required by Mt. \nHealthy does not improperly shift from the plaintiff the ultimate burden of persuasion on whether \nthe defendant intentionally discriminated against him or her. \n \n\n \n \n  \n Id. at 260, 109 S. Ct. at 1796 (citations and quotations omitted); see also Holo-Krome Co. v. N.L.R.B., 954 F.2d \n108, 110 (2nd Cir. 1992) (\"Pretext analysis determines what the true motivation actually was; dual motivation \nanalysis determines what the employer's conduct would have been if the improper motivation had not been pre-\nsent.\"). \n [**27]  The Supreme Court answered that question in the negative. The Supreme Court reasoned that allowing a \nplaintiff to recover under those circumstances might \"place the employee in a better position as a result of the exercise \nof constitutionally protected conduct than he would have occupied had he done nothing,\" because it would require hold-\ning the defendant liable even though the same employment decision would have been made for entirely legitimate rea-\nsons. Id. In response to this dilemma, the Supreme Court devised a burden-shifting framework in which the plaintiff \ninitially bears the burden of proving that the constitutionally protected conduct was a \"substantial\" or \"motivating\" fac-\ntor behind the employer's discriminatory action. See id. at 287, 97 S. Ct. at 576; Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro-\npolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 270 n.21, 97 S. Ct. 555, 566 n.21, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977) (characterizing \nthe plaintiff's burden as a \"required threshold showing\"). Only after the plaintiff makes this showing does the burden \nthen shift to the defendant to prove that the violation was \"largely harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957. There-\nfore, unlike the  [**28]  McDonnell Douglas framework  [*883]  used in Title VII pretext cases (in which the burden of \npersuasion remains on the plaintiff at all times), the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant in mixed-motives cases \nonce it is either conceded by the defendant or determined by the fact finder that the employer considered impermissible \nfactors in reaching its adverse employment decision. Mt. Healthy therefore confirms the rather uncontroversial proposi-\ntion that plaintiffs are required to prove injury-in-fact in order to collect monetary damages. See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S. \nat 285, 97 S. Ct. at 575. \nUnlike the adverse employment action at issue in Mt. Healthy, there are two types of injury in a case involving the \nunlawful use of racial preferences. As the Court recognized in Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 583, there is an intangible \ninjury resulting from the government's discriminatory classification which prevents a plaintiff from \"competing on an \nequal footing\" with other applicants. 21 See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, \n515 U.S. 200, 211, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2105, 132 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1995)). All nonminorities who applied to the law [**29]  \nschool in 1992, including nonminority students who were admitted, suffered that kind of injury. A second, tangible type \nof injury--an injury-in-fact--occurs when a plaintiff is actually denied some right or benefit, such as admission to the \nlaw school, as a direct result of the use of unlawful racial preferences. In applying the Mt. Healthy framework to this \ncase, the Fifth Circuit affirmed this Court's conclusion that the law school's 1992 admissions procedures were constitu-\ntionally flawed. With virtually no explanation, however, the Fifth Circuit then asserted that, as a result of that determi-\nnation alone, the defendants bear the burden of proving that the constitutional violation against the four plaintiffs was \n\"largely harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 (\"In this case, there is no question that a constitutional violation \noccurred (as the district court found) and that the plaintiffs were harmed thereby.\"). The Fifth Circuit's analysis in this \nregard was incomplete at best; at worst, it was a misapplication of the Mt. Healthy framework because it presupposed \nthat race was a substantial or motivating factor in every nonminority applicant's denial of admission to [**30]  the law \nschool in 1992, regardless of the applicant's qualifications to enter law school. As a matter of common sense and rudi-\nmentary mathematics, that cannot be the case. \n \n21   The Supreme Court in Adarand implicitly recognized that an individual's inability to compete on an equal \nfooting as a result of discriminatory classifications is a harm that is related to the issue of standing. In holding \nthat the plaintiff had standing to challenge the use of racial preferences in the awarding of subcontractor bids in \nfederal agency contracts, the Supreme Court stated: \n  \n   We note that . . . [the plaintiff] Adarand need not demonstrate that it has been, or will be, the \nlow bidder on a government contract. The injury in cases of this kind is that a discriminatory \nclassification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing. The aggrieved party \nneed not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish \nstanding. \n \n  \n Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211, 115 S. Ct. at 2105 (citations and quotations omitted). \n \n\n \n [**31]  There is no basis in fact or logic to suggest, as the Fifth Circuit apparently does in Hopwood II, that all \nresident nonminority applicants who were denied admission to the law school in 1992 were denied admission substan-\ntially--or, for that matter, even in small part--because of race. Even assuming all 96 offers of admission made to resident \nminorities in 1992 were available, there would still remain approximately 1,400 resident applicants in 1992 (the over-\nwhelming majority of whom, presumably, were nonminorities) who would have been denied admission without regard \nto race. At most, therefore, only 7% of resident nonminority applicants were affected by the law school's use of racial \npreferences. 22 Suppose this  [*884]  case had been brought by the least qualified nonminority who applied to the law \nschool in 1992. Under Adarand, that applicant clearly would have standing to challenge the affirmative action program. \nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 212, 115 S. Ct. at 2105. However, an applicant who has no conceivable chance of admission \ncannot possibly show that race was a substantial or motivating factor in the law school's decision to deny him or her \nadmission. The Mt. Healthy burden-shifting [**32]  framework is never implicated. In contrast, Hopwood II always \nshifts the burden to the defendant--and would shift the burden even in the example of the candidate with no chance of \nadmission--once the plaintiff establishes the unconstitutionality of the affirmative action program. But being subjected \nto admissions procedures that take into account racial preferences does not, in and of itself, establish or even imply that \nthe applicant's race was a substantial or motivating factor in his or her denial. Importantly, in this case the law school, \nunlike the University of California in Bakke, never conceded that the plaintiffs would have been admitted in the absence \nof an affirmative action program, and this Court specifically found the plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of persua-\nsion on that point. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 581-82. \n \n22   For that reason, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 \nL. Ed. 2d 396 (1977) is inapplicable as well. Teamsters was a Title VII disparate impact case in which the Su-\npreme Court held that once the employee establishes a system-wide pattern or practice of discrimination, the \nburden shifts to the employer to prove that individual hiring decisions were not made in pursuit of that policy. \nSee id. at 359-60, 97 S. Ct. at 1866-67. In that case, however, the Supreme Court specifically supported the bur-\nden-shifting scheme on the ground that an employee's proof of broad-based employment discrimination creates \n\"a greater likelihood that any single [employment] decision was a component of the overall pattern,\" id. at 361 \nn.45, 97 S. Ct. at 1867 n.45, and, consequently, there are \"reasonable grounds to infer that individual hiring deci-\nsions were made in pursuit of the discriminatory policy,\" id. at 359, 97 S. Ct. at 1867. No similar inference can \nor should be made in this case: a policy that affects 7% of a given population can hardly be called broad-based \nor widespread, nor would it cause one to infer that an individual decision was infected by the discriminatory pol-\nicy. \n [**33]  The harm in the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of Mt. Healthy is not readily apparent in the Court's example \nbecause it would be quite easy for the law school in that instance to establish the applicant's non-admission. The harm \noccurs, for example, when the suit is brought by a candidate who has some chance of admission under a race-neutral \nprocedure but who would not be able to prove that he or she would have been admitted by a preponderance of the evi-\ndence. The Fifth Circuit decision potentially gives those candidates a windfall by placing the ultimate burden of proof \non the defendant: close calls must always be decided in favor of the plaintiff. And yet the function and purpose of the \nMt. Healthy burden-shifting scheme are just the opposite--to ferret out instances of discrimination and to ensure that the \nplaintiff is not put in a better position than he or she ordinarily would have occupied. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit recog-\nnized in Hopwood II that Mt. Healthy was intended to give the defendant \"a second chance of prevailing by showing \nthat the violation was largely harmless.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957. Instead of giving the defendant a second \nchance of [**34]  prevailing, the Fifth Circuit gives the defendant little chance of prevailing when the applicant is an \nextremely close call. The Fifth Circuit decision essentially allows a plaintiff to recover monetary damages without ever \nhaving to establish any injury-in-fact. 23 \n \n23   Furthermore, as a matter of public policy, it may be imprudent to apply the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting \nframework to the admissions procedures of public universities. In making its admissions decisions every year, \nthe law school is faced with the enormous responsibility and discretion to select an entering class among appli-\ncants who share similar academic qualifications (in terms of GPAs and LSAT scores), but who have varying \npersonal backgrounds and vastly different educational circumstances. Public universities are put in the unfortu-\nnate, perhaps even untenable, position of making such decisions with the threat of liability hanging in the back-\nground. \nMt. Healthy does not apply to this case. One might be able to make a normative argument [**35]  that the defen-\ndants should bear the ultimate burden of persuasion once the plaintiffs establish the unconstitutionality of the law \n \n\n \nschool's affirmative action program, but the legal argument cannot be justified. This is a classic pretext case in which \nthe trier of fact--in this case, the Court--must determine why each of the four plaintiffs was denied admission to the law \nschool. If the plaintiffs were denied admission because of their race, they should have to prove it, as plaintiffs must in \nevery other pretext case brought in federal and state court. The Court therefore respectfully but strenuously objects to \nthis portion of the Fifth Circuit  [*885]  opinion. The Court is cognizant, however, of the panel's instructions on remand, \nand it will faithfully and responsibly execute them. \n \nA.  \nThe defendants presented one expert on causation, Olin Guy Wellborn, a tenured professor who has taught at the \nlaw school since 1974. 24 Wellborn has served on the law school admissions committee for over 15 years and was a \nmember of the admissions committee in 1992. In accordance with the Fifth Circuit decision, Wellborn analyzed whether \nthe plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law school under [**36]  a constitutional admissions system. See Hop-\nwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 & n. 55. In preparation for his expert reports, Wellborn testified he carefully examined the \nLSDAS sheets of approximately 450 applicants, including the LSDAS sheets of the 96 minorities admitted in 1992. \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 45. He then narrowed the field to approximately 200 of the \"most promising\" minority and nonmi-\nnority candidates, as reflected by their LSDAS sheets, and he reviewed those application files in their entirety. Id. Well-\nborn prepared two expert reports, employing a different methodology in each one. See D-519 and D-520. In both reports \nhe concluded that none of the plaintiffs would have been admitted in a race-blind admissions procedure. See id. \n \n24   The plaintiffs did not proffer their own expert to testify as to what a constitutional admissions system would \nlook like or whether any of the plaintiffs would have been admitted under such a system. \n(1) Wellborn's First Report \nIn his first report, Wellborn [**37]  examined the 1992 admissions process and then considered how that process \nwould have been modified in a manner that would yield the same total number of admissions on a race-blind basis. \nWellborn first compared the relation between an applicant's TI score and the statistical rate of admittance in the actual \n1992 admissions process. Wellborn detected the emergence of a pattern in which candidates with TI scores of 203 or \nhigher were virtually all admitted and candidates with TI scores of 184 or lower were virtually all denied. A discretion-\nary zone candidate's statistical chance of admittance generally increased by an additional 10 or 20 percentage points \nwith each successive TI score. 25 Hopwood's TI score of 199 corresponded to an acceptance rate of 89%, and a TI score \nof 197 (the TI score belonging to Carvell, Elliot, and Rogers) corresponded to an acceptance rate of 59%. This pattern \nof percentages reflected a  [*886]  typical, yearly phenomenon. 26 See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 145. \n \n25   The statistical breakdown for the 1992 resident admissions occurred as follows: \nTI  Nonpreferred  Nonpreferred  % Nonpreferred  Minorities \nscore  Residents  Residents Denied  Residents  Admitted \n   Admitted    Admitted    \n203 up  169  1  -100%  4 \n202  27  3  90%  2 \n201  48  5  90%  1 \n200  51  4  92%  1 \n199  57  7  89%  4 \n198  34  15  69%  2 \n197  44  27  59%  1 \n196  29  44  40%  2 \n195  24  40  38%  3 \n194  15  64  19%  7 \n193  13  59  18%  5 \n192  10  57  15%  3 \n191  4  72  5%  5 \n190  5  71  7%  11 \n189  2  63  3%  3 \n188  1  57  2%  4 \n \n\n \nTI  Nonpreferred  Nonpreferred  % Nonpreferred  Minorities \nscore  Residents  Residents Denied  Residents  Admitted \n   Admitted    Admitted    \n187  3  55  5%  9 \n186  2  50  4%  10 \n185  3  393  -0%  19 \ndown             \n [**38]  \n26   The percentages in Wellborn's report, however, are not hard-and-fast figures, as there were small variations \nin the percentages from year to year. Furthermore, the 1992 percentages varied from other years because \nLSDAS was in the process of changing the LSAT scoring system from a two-digit score to a three-digit score. \nUnder the two-digit system, applicants were more compressed along the Texas Index. Because this methodology \nrelies too heavily on unreliable percentages of admission, the Court finds the methodology employed in Well-\nborn's supplemental report preferable. \nBecause the actual 1992 presumptive admission and denial lines were lower for minorities than for nonminorities, \nWellborn had to adjust the overall presumptive admission and denial lines in creating a hypothetical admissions system. \n27 Wellborn therefore lowered the overall presumptive admit and deny lines to 198 and 190, respectively, and retained \nthe 1992 average of nine votes per pile of thirty files. Wellborn assumed the law school would extend the same number \nof resident offers that it had extended in 1992. 28 See [**39]  D-520: Wellborn, vol. 1 at 237. Using this methodology, \nWellborn predicted a pattern of percentages in admissions almost identical to the 1992 admissions percentages, except \nthat each percentage of admission would be \"notched down\" by one TI score throughout. In other words, Wellborn pre-\ndicted that virtually all candidates with a TI score of 202 and above would have been admitted; 90% of applicants with \nTI scores ranging from 198 to 201 would have been admitted; 70% of applicants with TI scores of 197 would have been \nadmitted, and so on down the Texas Index. 29 Wellborn then reexamined  [*887]  the application files of the four plain-\ntiffs, the admitted minority resident applicants, and the denied nonminority resident applicants at their respective TI \nscores to determine who would have received the additional offers as dictated by the predetermined percentages of ad-\nmission. \n \n27   It was the practice of the law school to lower the presumptive admission and/or denial scores in order to \ngenerate more offers. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561-62; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 937 n.10. Wellborn did \nnot alter the number of votes per pile for discretionary zone applicants because doing so, he testified, would \nhave yielded too many offers. \n [**40]  \n28   In 1992, the law school extended 637 resident offers to achieve 425 matriculants. Therefore, the overall \nresident yield rate, i.e., the rate at which candidates accepted their offers of admission, was approximately 67%. \nSee Johanson Declaration, D-332; Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 561 n.22. The 1992 yield rate was approximately \n80% for African-Americans and 73% for Mexican-Americans. Wellborn assumed the yield rate for marginal \nnonminority, candidates in a color-blind admissions process would be higher than 67% (and probably as high as \n75%) because the additional offers of admission to nonminorities would be made to less qualified (and therefore \nless desirable) applicants for whom the law school would probably be their first choice. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at \n152-53. \n29   Wellborn's projected statistical breakdown in a race-blind admissions procedure: \nTI score  % Nonpreferred  Total  % Admitted--  Projected \n  Admitted--Actual  Applicants  Projected  Number Admitted \n203 up  -100%  174  100%  174 \n202  90%  32  100%  32 \n201  90%  54  90%  49 + 1 \n200  92%  56  90%  50 + 1 \n199  89%  68  90%  61 + 1 \n198  69%  51  90%  46 + 1 \n197  59%  72  70%  50 + 1 \n196  40%  75  60%  45 + 1 \n195  38%  67  40%  27 + 1 \n194  19%  86  40%  34 + 1 \n \n\n \nTI score  % Nonpreferred  Total  % Admitted--  Projected \n  Admitted--Actual  Applicants  Projected  Number Admitted \n193  18%  77  20%  15 \n192  15%  71  20%  14 \n191  5%  81  15%  12 \n190  7%  87  5%  4 \n189  3%  68  5%  3 \n188  2%  63  5%  3 \n187  5%  71  5%  4 \n186  4%  65  5%  3 \n185  -0%  63  5%  3 \n184 down  0%  658  0%  0 \nAdjusting the presumptive admit and deny lines would not have accounted for all of the offers that would \nhave been made assuming the same yield rate. Eight offers would still have to be made, and Wellborn accounted \nfor them by assuming that one candidate from each TI score between 201 and 194 would have been chosen from \na waiting list. \n [**41]  Wellborn predicted that one additional offer of admission would be made at Hopwood's TI score. Of the \nten admitted minority and denied nonminority resident applicants at the 199 TI level, Wellborn concluded that seven \napplicants, including the four minority applicants, were \"clearly stronger\" than Hopwood and that the remaining two \napplicants were \"comparable\" to Hopwood. As in the actual admissions process in 1992, Wellborn determined that \nHopwood would most likely have been placed in the discretionary zone by Professor Johanson and that she would not \nhave received the two or three votes necessary to be admitted. At the 197 TI score of Carvell, Elliot, and Rogers, Well-\nborn estimated that the law school would have extended seven additional offers. 30 Wellborn identified the seven appli-\ncants he predicted would have been offered admission over Carvell, Elliot, and Rogers, and he also rated those seven \napplicants superior to Hopwood. Wellborn then identified four additional applicants who, although not as strong as the \noriginal seven, were still stronger than Carvell, Elliot, and Rogers. Indeed, Wellborn indicated that Rogers and Elliot \nwere \"among the very weakest\" at that index and [**42]  that Carvell, although a stronger applicant than Elliot and \nRogers, does not compare favorably because of his relatively low combined LSAT score in the 76th percentile. 31 See D-\n519. \n \n30   Statistically, Wellborn estimated that six additional offers would have been made at this index. He con-\ncluded, however, that the minority admittee might not have been admitted at a TI score of 197. Wellborn there-\nfore projected seven additional offers. \n31   For purposes of stacking application files into piles of thirty, the law school classified Carvell as a TI 197 \napplicant. Carvell's \"true\" TI score, using his combined LSAT score in the 76th percentile, was either 191 or \n192. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 70. Although it was and is the normal practice of LSDAS to average multiple \nscores, LSDAS did not do so in 1992 for candidates who received LSAT scores under both systems. See Well-\nborn, vol. 1 at 70-71. For purposes of reviewing Carvell's application, Wellborn testified that reviewers would \nhave mentally discounted Carvell's TI score and would do so again in a color-blind process. See Wellborn, vol. 1 \nat 73; see also Declaration of Steven Goode D-336 (stating that he would discount Carvell's attempts to explain \nhis poor performance on his first LSAT since applicants have the option of canceling their scores). At trial, Car-\nvell objected to Wellborn's circular argument in his first report that Carvell compares unfavorably to other TI \n197 applicants in part because \"Carvell does not really belong at this index.\" See D-519. For purposes of his first \nreport, Wellborn classified Carvell with other TI 197 applicants because it was Carvell's actual classification in \n1992. In his supplemental report, however, Wellborn compares Carvell to the entire pool of discretionary zone \napplicants, including applicants with TI scores of 191 and 192. \n [**43]  (2) Wellborn's Supplemental Report \nUsing his first report as a hypothesis for how the law school would have extended offers of admission in a race-\nblind procedure, Wellborn undertook the more difficult task in his supplemental report of specifically identifying (1) the \nadmitted resident minorities in 1992 who probably would have been denied admission in a race-blind procedure, and (2) \nthe denied resident nonminority applicants who most likely would have been admitted in their place. Wellborn made \nseveral basic assumptions about a hypothetical race-blind admissions procedure. First, as he had in his first report, \n \n\n \nWellborn projected that the presumptive admission line would be set at 198 and that the presumptive denial line would \nbe set at 190. He then assumed that all of the nonminority residents who had been admitted in 1992 would have been \nadmitted in a hypothetical race-blind admissions procedure. Therefore, Wellborn only examined the application files of \nthe 96 admitted minority applicants and the approximately 450 LSDAS reports (which he then narrowed down to about \n200 application files) of the denied residents (minority and nonminority) who had TI scores  [*888]  above 190. 32  \n[**44]  See D-520; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 45. In examining each application, Wellborn primarily considered the applicant's \ncollege record and LSAT score, which he weighed \"about equally,\" 33 and he applied identical standards to minority and \nnonminority candidates. See D-520. In evaluating the college record, he considered the caliber of the school, as mani-\nfested by the LSAT college mean, 34 and the applicant's major, rank in class, and college transcript. Wellborn also con-\nsidered an applicant's personal statement, letters of recommendation, and other factors and materials such as the appli-\ncant's age and background; the relevance and importance of these factors varied, of course, with each file. \n \n32   As Wellborn testified, the fact that he only evaluated LSDAS sheets with TI scores of 190 or above was an \nomission that probably benefitted the plaintiffs. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 50. Wellborn acknowledged that \"one or \ntwo\" candidates with TI scores below 190 might have been \"extraordinary\" enough to compensate for their low \nindex. Id. To the extent that Wellborn did not consider those applicants--or, for that matter, the 250 applicants \nwithin the hypothetical discretionary zone whose entire application files might have revealed extraordinary \nqualities meriting the applicant's admission--Wellborn eliminated from the applicant pool a few potential com-\npetitors who probably would have been admitted. \n [**45]  \n33   The TI scores calculated by LSDAS in 1992, on the other hand, gave slightly greater weight to an appli-\ncants's LSAT score. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935 n. 1 (indicating that LSDAS assigned a 60% weight to a \ncandidate's LSAT score and a 40% weight to his or her GPA in 1992). Of course, the law school is not bound by \nLSDAS's determination that the LSAT score should be weighed more heavily in determining admission. \n34   The college LSAT mean is the average LSAT score of students who took the LSAT from that particular col-\nlege or university. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 44. In Wellborn's opinion, \"the college LSAT mean is the best way of \ncomparing colleges in terms of the caliber of the student body.\" See D-520. The numbers bear out Wellborn's as-\nsessment. The 1992 LSAT means of the following universities illustrate the difference: Harvard University (40); \nDuke University (39); Rice University (38); Trinity University (36); the University of Texas (between 35 and \n34); Texas A&M University (33); Hendrix College (32); California State University-Sacramento (28); and the \nUniversity of Houston-Downtown (26). \n [**46]  In selecting a particular applicant for his supplemental report, Wellborn attempted to predict those candi-\ndates who he believed would emerge as probable admittees. He did not, in other words, only select candidates for whom \nhe necessarily would have voted, nor did he attempt to predict how a particular admissions committee member would \nhave voted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 231-33, 249-51. Wellborn explained his approach as follows: \n  \n   If I say these candidates are the ones that I judge most likely to be admitted, and these I judge to be \nrelatively unlikely to be admitted, that's not going to describe in exact detail the offers that go out. I'm \nmaking an overall estimate of probabilities, based upon many years of experience in watching this proc-\ness and having a judgment about on the average which criteria are going to be most influential and most \nimportant to the reviewers as a group. And so, of course, there are going to be those vagaries in the vot-\ning, but I still believe in the overall validity of the prediction. \nIt certainly is not the case--absolutely is not the case that . . . [all] denied non-minorities [within the \ndiscretionary zone] . . . have an equal chance [**47]  [of admission] . . . or that a person, as familiar as I \nam with the process, couldn't tell you that these people have a better chance than these other people. I \nthink . . . it would be preposterous to suggest that . . . it's just random, or that it's completely unpredict-\nable. \n \n  \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 250. \nThe law school made 96 offers of admission to resident minorities in 1992. Wellborn evaluated all 96 minority ad-\nmittees and concluded that 19 would have been admitted without regard to race. Wellborn named this group of appli-\ncants \"Group A.\" Wellborn then selected 2 additional resident minority admittees who, though weaker than the original \n19, would still have a better chance of admission than any of the plaintiffs in a color-blind procedure (\"Group B\"). Sub-\n \n\n \ntracting the Group A applicants from the actual number of resident minority admittees in 1992 leaves 77 seats remain-\ning for nonminority resident applicants who were denied in  [*889]  1992. There were 398 nonminority residents with \nTI scores of 190 or above who were denied admission in 1992; therefore, fewer than 20% of candidates in Wellborn's \nhypothetical discretionary zone would have been offered admission. Of those 398 files,  [**48]  Wellborn selected 78 \nresident nonminority applicants 35 who he believed probably would have been offered admission in a race-blind proce-\ndure (\"Group C\"). As with the minority applicants reflected in Group B, Wellborn also selected an additional 20 resi-\ndent nonminority applicants who he believed had a reasonable chance of admission as alternatives to the Group C can-\ndidates (\"Group D\"). 36 Wellborn testified that none of the plaintiffs merited inclusion in either Group C or D. See Well-\nborn, vol. 1 at 115. \n \n35   Wellborn initially identified 18 minorities who he believed would have been admitted in a race-neutral sys-\ntem. The file of one minority applicant was inadvertently omitted from the original report; Wellborn reviewed \nthat file and concluded that the applicant would have been admitted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 89-90 and D-669 \n(indicating that the applicant graduated in the 98th percentile at Texas A&M University and received an LSAT \nscore in the 96th percentile). Therefore, the original calculation of 78 additional offers is erroneous. \n36   Wellborn segregated the applicants by race into Groups A, B, C, and D for administrative convenience only. \nWhen evaluating the application files, he did not review the minority and nonminority files separately. \n [**49]  The plaintiffs have several objections to the methodology Wellborn used in his supplemental report. 37 \nFirst, the plaintiffs argue the random admissions procedure employed in 1992 effectively prevents the defendants from \ncarrying their burden of proving that the plaintiffs would not have received offers of admission in a race-neutral proce-\ndure. Second, Hopwood and Carvell argue that, in contravention of the Fifth Circuit decision, Wellborn made no at-\ntempt to reconstruct the actual admissions process used in 1992 to determine which nonminority, residents would have \nbeen offered admission under a constitutional system, nor did he devise a methodology revolving around either the piles \nof thirty or the waiting list actually generated in 1992. Third, the plaintiffs criticize Wellborn for making the assumption \nthat all nonminority residents who were given offers of admission in 1992 would nevertheless have been admitted under \na constitutional system. Fourth, Hopwood and Carvell argue that Wellborn's testimony is insufficient to carry the defen-\ndants' burden as a matter of law because Wellborn relied on \"mere statistical likelihoods\" in concluding that the four \nplaintiffs would have been [**50]  denied admission under a race-neutral system. The Court considers each objection \nseriatim. \n \n37   Although the plaintiffs openly questioned Wellborn's integrity and ability to render an unbiased opinion at \ntrial, they did not contend that Wellborn was unqualified to render an expert opinion regarding the plaintiffs' \nqualifications for admission vis-a-vis other denied nonminority applicants. And, other then the nonsensical ob-\njection that Wellborn is not a mathematician or statistician (discussed infra), the plaintiffs do not argue that \nWellborn is incapable of assessing the plaintiffs' chances of admission under a constitutional admissions system. \nAs this Court recognized in Hopwood I, reconstructing the actual 1992 admissions procedure is a conceptually dif-\nficult, if not \"virtually impossible,\" task: \"The difficulty does not stem from the unconstitutional aspects of the proce-\ndure alone but from the random shuffle of files into stacks of thirty, each stack reviewed by different subcommittees of \nthree.\"  [**51]  38 Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.86.  [*890]  Although the stacks were weighted as closely as possi-\nble with the same number of high to low TI scores, see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 41, an applicant's chances for admission may \nin some instances have depended upon the personal tastes of the reviewers who evaluated the applicant's file and \nwhether the applicant was placed in a stack with an unusually strong or weak pool of applicants. To the extent that the \nplaintiffs argue that the admissions procedure used in 1992 was inherently unfair due to the random composition of the \npiles of thirty and the subjectivity of each reviewer, the point is very well taken. It goes without saying, however, that \nthis unfairness does not implicate a constitutional defect with the law school's admissions procedures. To the extent that \nthe plaintiffs argue that the law school can never meet its burden for that reason, the point is not well taken. A particular \napplicant's admission to the law school in 1992 was not the result of a random and unpredictable process--after all, ap-\nplicants were not admitted by a flip of a coin. And it is nonsense to suggest that all nonminorities who were denied ad-\nmission in 1992 [**52]  would have an equal chance of admission under a race-blind procedure. With or without the \nlaw school's ill-advised piles-of-thirty approach, even a superficial comparison of the four plaintiffs, for instance, re-\nveals the varying quality of students who applied to the law school in 1992 and confirms that concrete distinctions can \nbe made among those applicants--if not to a virtual certainty, then at least by a preponderance of the evidence. \n \n \n\n \n38   Johanson recognized this difficulty as well. When asked in his 1993 deposition whether Hopwood's chances \nof admission would have been improved in the absence of the law school's affirmative action program, Johanson \ntestified: \n  \n   I haven't got a clue. . . . I can't say, if she was in another stack, whether she would have gotten \ntwo votes to admit or no votes to admit. . . . What was it in that file that impressed one screener \nand didn't impress two? Was it the makeup of the overall competition? What was it? There is no \nway that--it would be not only sheer speculation, but I think it would be improper to speculate \nbecause it's just based on the misunderstanding of the relativity of every decision. \n \n  \nJohanson, vol. 1 at 256-57. \nThe plaintiffs have attempted to use Johanson's testimony to demonstrate that the law school cannot estab-\nlish by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs would not have been admitted under a constitutional \nsystem. Wellborn testified, however, that the validity of his predictions is not dependent on whether the admis-\nsions procedure uses stacks of thirty or whether one reviewer or group of reviewers evaluates all of the applica-\ntion files. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 251-52. Likewise, Sharlot testified that, although the piles-of-thirty approach \nhad a \"certain degree of artificiality\" (given the limited number of choices each reviewer could make), the voting \npatterns of the faculty members on the admissions committee was not aberrational or unpredictable: \n  \n   I think that as the committee, which maintained its personnel to a very large extent [for a very \nlong time], as the committee worked over many years, there came to be a fairly high degree . . . of \nshared agreement as to which criteria were more pertinent and the weights that should be given to \nthem. And that is why I believe it is possible to undertake a review of hundreds of files and to \nmake a reasonable prediction as to the likelihood, given the make up [sic] of the committee, who \nwas most likely to receive an offer of admission. \n \n  \nSharlot, vol. 2 at 22-23. Using the piles of thirty was, in the Court's opinion, a flawed approach. However, the \napproach was intended to produce the most qualified candidates for admission, and that was the same goal \nWellborn attempted to achieve in his expert reports. \n [**53]  The plaintiffs' argument that Wellborn should have reproduced an admissions procedure by which applica-\ntion files were randomly placed into piles of thirty and then reviewed by randomly formed screening committees is also \nwithout merit. Wellborn is a very talented law professor, but he cannot turn back the hands of time, nor does the Fifth \nCircuit decision require him to do so. Rather, the inquiry posed by the Fifth Circuit is whether any of the four plaintiffs \nwould have been admitted under \"a constitutional admissions system.\" See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 (emphasis \nadded). The Court, therefore, does not read the Fifth Circuit opinion as instructing the defendants to replicate exactly the \n1992 admissions procedure or to use the 1992 piles-of-thirty approach. First, how would one go about reproducing a \nrandom process? By the very definition of the word random, it cannot be done. The only logical, reasonable, and fair \nway to determine who would have received offers of admission under a constitutional system is to compare the applica-\ntion files of all of the admitted minorities and the denied nonminorities, and that is precisely the methodology Wellborn \nused in his supplemental [**54]  report. 39 Furthermore, using the 1992 piles of thirty would perpetuate the unconstitu-\ntional aspects of the 1992 admissions procedure.  [*891]  The admissions procedure employed in 1992 was fraught with \nconstitutional error precisely because the original piles of thirty did not include any minority applicants. Those piles \nwould never exist under a constitutional admissions system, and as a result, it would make no sense to use them now to \ndetermine whether any of the plaintiffs would have gained admission to the law school in 1992. The Court finds it more \nthan a little baffling that the plaintiffs assert Wellborn should have utilized, as the very premise of his methodology, the \nadmissions system found unconstitutional as a result of this lawsuit. \n \n39   In 1992, the application files in the discretionary zone were separated according to whether the applicant \nhad a two-digit or three-digit LSAT score. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 161. Although two-digit and three-digit candi-\ndates were, for the most part, compared separately in 1992, Wellborn did not separate the two groups in prepar-\ning his reports. Wellborn, vol. 1 at 159. The plaintiffs complain that Wellborn's failure to segregate applicants by \ntheir LSAT score is another fundamental flaw in his methodology. In view of the fact that Wellborn did not at-\n \n\n \ntempt to replicate the 1992 admissions system, the Court finds that Wellborn's failure to evaluate two-digit and \nthree-digit candidates separately is inconsequential. \n [**55]  Likewise, using the 1992 waiting list to determine who would have been admitted under a constitutional \nsystem is equally problematic. In support of this method, Hopwood and Carvell argue that the one vote they actually \nreceived in 1992 placing them on the waiting list is more probative than any subsequent attempt to reconstruct a hypo-\nthetical race-blind admissions process. While this method certainly has some intuitive appeal, it is not the best way to \ndetermine which nonminority applicants would have gained admission in 1992 in a race-blind procedure. First, there \nwere two waiting lists in 1992, each of which was segregated by race. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 574 n.68. Sec-\nond, this methodology suffers from the same defect identified with respect to the original piles of thirty: the waiting list \nwas generated by an unconstitutional system in which minority and nonminority applicants were reviewed separately. \nTherefore, the waiting list created in 1992 would not exist under a constitutional admissions system. Third, due to the \nchange in the LSAT scoring system, 1992 was somewhat of an anomaly in that the law school had not extended a suffi-\ncient number of offers through its [**56]  normal procedures. As a result, the admissions committee had to select an \nunusually high number of candidates--12 out of 123 applicants--from the waiting list. 40 See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 52-53, \n144. Wellborn testified that the waiting list had been pretty well \"picked over\" and, consequently, the remaining eighty-\none applicants on the waiting list had, in a sense, a third \"no\" vote denying them admission. 41 See Wellborn, vol. 1 at \n52-54. Fourth, using the waiting list to determine who would have gained admission is, in the Court's opinion, self-\ndefeating for all of the plaintiffs: the methodology would unfairly exclude Elliot and Rogers from consideration because \nthey received no votes in screening, and the one vote Carvell and Hopwood each received is not necessarily probative of \nany increased likelihood that they would have been admitted in a race-blind procedure. Carvell's vote was from a stu-\ndent member of the admissions committee, not a faculty member, see Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 566, and Hopwood's \nvote was essentially a \"sympathy vote\" from Hamilton, then the Assistant Dean of Admissions for the law school. 42 \n \n40   Wellborn testified that 123 wait list letters were sent to applicants and that the \"vast majority\" of the waiting \nlist offers were accepted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 55-56. Therefore, the actual number of individuals on the wait-\ning list was somewhat smaller than 123. \n [**57]  \n41   Wellborn explained the fact that committee members were required to cast a certain number of votes per \npile meant that in some instances the last vote was \"forced.\" In Wellborn's words, it would have been \"crazy\" to \nconstruct a process in advance in which anyone who received a forced vote in the screening process would \nautomatically be admitted. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 54. \n42   At the remand trial, Hamilton testified as follows: \n  \n   And the Hopwood file I remember in particular having read the file and agonizing over her per-\nsonal situation with respect to her child. And then I returned my files to the admissions office, I \nchecked to--I did not vote for Ms. Hopwood at all. I checked to see if other members had voted \nfor her, and they did not. And out of sympathy for her case, again, which I had some concern \nabout, I changed my vote to put her on the waiting list and took a vote from someone else who \nhad already gained admission. \n \n  \nHamilton, vol. 2 at 27. Although Professor Johanson had instructed committee members to conduct blind voting, \nHamilton did not follow this instruction in 1992. She testified she was concerned that her voting had been \"par-\nticularly aberrational\" compared to other members of the admissions committee; she therefore reviewed the vot-\ning patterns of other faculty members \"to try to get a sense of what was valuable.\" Hamilton, vol. 2 at 42-44. \n [**58]  The plaintiffs also argue that Wellborn arbitrarily and impermissibly \"picks and  [*892]  chooses\" among \nactual events in 1992 in that he (1) gave no weight to applicants who were placed on the waiting list by virtue of their \none vote and (2) assumed that all nonminority applicants who were admitted in 1992 would have been admitted in a \nrace-blind procedure. The plaintiffs urge the Court to disregard Wellborn's supplemental report entirely because, they \nargue, he did not reconsider all offers of admission in hypothesizing a constitutional admissions system. Not only is this \nargument unpersuasive, it mischaracterizes Wellborn's methodology. The plaintiffs acknowledge it was more difficult \nfor nonminorities to achieve offers of admission in 1992; indeed, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit for that very reason. \nThe fact that those nonminority applicants received offers of admission under the University's admissions program is \nvery strong evidence to support the inference that they would emerge as probable admittees under a race-neutral system. \n \n\n \nSee Wellborn, vol. 1 at 42. Wellborn did not, therefore, arbitrarily pick and choose among real events in 1992; rather, he \ndrew logical inferences [**59]  based upon the admissions procedure in force in 1992. The fact that an applicant was \npresumptively admitted, received two or three votes in the screening process, or was an applicant chosen from the wait-\ning list in 1992 correlates with a strong likelihood that the applicant would have been admitted in a race-blind admis-\nsions procedure; for the reasons indicated above, however, there is not a sufficiently strong correlation between receiv-\ning a position on the waiting list and an increased probability of admittance. 43 Therefore, the distinction between non-\nminority admittees and waiting list candidates is warranted. Furthermore, it is conceptually difficult to see the harm in \nthe inference--to the extent that these individuals were offered admission over the four plaintiffs, it certainly was not the \nresult of any unlawful or invidious discrimination. \n \n43   Waiting list candidates were moderately overrepresented in Wellborn's C and D Groups, suggesting some \ncorrelation between placement on the waiting list and an increased probability of admission. See Wellborn, vol. \n1 at 211. Of the 98 Group C and D selections, 44 received one vote in discretionary zone screening in 1992. In \nthe Court's opinion, this correlation is not strong enough to support the inference that all individuals on the wait-\ning list would be more likely to receive offers of admission in a race-neutral world. \n [**60]  Finally, the Court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that Wellborn relied on \"mere statistical likelihoods\" in \nconcluding that the four plaintiffs would have been denied admission. In support of this argument, the plaintiffs cite \nSmith v. Rapid Transit, Inc., 317 Mass. 469, 470, 58 N.E.2d 754, 755 (1945), a case in which the Massachusetts Su-\npreme Court held it is insufficient as a matter of law to prove a proposition merely by showing the mathematical \nchances favor the veracity of the proposition. This argument might have been valid had Wellborn conclusorily asserted, \nfor instance, that Carvell would not have been admitted to the law school based solely on the fact that his \"true\" TI score \nof 191 or 192 correlated to a 5% to 15% probability of admission in 1992. But Wellborn did not use mathematical prob-\nabilities to prove Carvell would not have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional system. Instead, Well-\nborn evaluated Carvell's application according to certain enumerated and, to a large extent, quantifiable criteria, com-\npared his application to the applications of 450 other denied nonminorities, and concluded that Carvell was less quali-\nfied than the 119 applicants [**61]  chosen for inclusion in his supplemental report. See D-520. Based on the applica-\ntions in evidence, as well as his knowledge of the law school's admissions procedures, it was Wellborn's considered \nopinion that it was more likely than not that Carvell would not have been admitted to the law school under a race-\nneutral admissions system. Indeed, Wellborn reached the same conclusion with respect to the other three plaintiffs de-\nspite the fact that their relatively high TI scores correlated with a probability of admittance of greater than 50%. This \nobjection is nugatory. \nThe Court therefore concludes that the methodology Wellborn employed in his supplemental report is sound. Well-\nborn did not attempt to handicap the chances of admission of each and every applicant who was denied admission to the \nlaw school in 1992. Rather,  [*893]  Wellborn presented evidence of 119 applicants who were better candidates for the \nstudy of law than the plaintiffs and who were therefore more likely to receive offers of admission under a constitutional \nsystem. In hypothesizing a constitutional admissions system, Wellborn made reasonable projections regarding the low-\nering of the presumptive admission and denial lines [**62]  and the probable number of offers to be extended. His as-\nsumption that all nonminority resident admittees in 1992 would be admitted under a race-neutral system is not only rea-\nsonable but supported by the record. Finally, Wellborn identified reasonable criteria to evaluate the application files, \nand as discussed below, he applied the criteria in a fair, consistent, and nondiscriminatory way. \n \nC.  \nBefore Wellborn's conclusions are explored and explained, the Court offers the following disclaimer. This opinion \nprovides more information than anyone ever needed or wanted to know about the qualifications required for admission \nto the law school. The Court once again undertook a painstaking review of the application files of hundreds of students, \nand, unfortunately, this opinion reflects the tedious and arduous process that it was. One principle the Court emphasized \nin its first opinion bears repeating here: \n  \n   The Court appreciates the difficulty of the task facing the admissions committee each year. Evaluation \nof applications involves both objective and subjective factors, and the Court is aware that some evaluat-\nors could use subjectivity to conceal discriminatory motives. As [**63]  a general rule, however, judges \nare not as well suited to evaluate qualifications of applications as those who are familiar with the process \nand have many years of experience evaluating applications. \n \n \n\n \n  \nSee Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 581 (citing Odom v. Frank, 3 F.3d 839, 847 (5th Cir. 1993)). \nThe plaintiffs openly accused Wellborn of manipulating certain criteria and of disingenuously using the subjectivity \nof the admissions process to rig the desired outcome of this case. The Court emphatically finds that allegation to be \nfalse. The fact that subjective criteria necessarily informed Wellborn's analysis does not render Wellborn's opinions \narbitrary or untenable. Part of Wellborn's everyday responsibilities as a law professor is to make subjective assessments \nof students, whether on a law school exam or as a member of the admissions committee, and the Court will not cava-\nlierly disregard the conclusions Wellborn reached in his supplemental report simply because they involve subjective \njudgments. Furthermore, Wellborn credibly supported the applicants he selected, and the faculty members who origi-\nnally reviewed the plaintiffs' files in 1992 universally support Wellborn's [**64]  judgment that the four plaintiffs were \nweak candidates for admission to the law school in 1992. See Johanson Declaration D-332; Declaration of Laquita \nHamilton D-333; Sharlot Declaration D-334; Declaration of Mark Gergen D-335; Goode Declaration D-336. \nBefore delving into the specific weaknesses of each plaintiff's application, the Court makes the following observa-\ntions and generalizations. First, TI scores are, to a certain degree, inherently unreliable because they do not weigh the \nstudent's GPA by major or quality of school. For example, Hopwood's GPA of 3.80, with her high number of hours \nfrom community colleges and subsequent transfer to a relatively weak undergraduate institution, does not compare fa-\nvorably with a student having a lower GPA from, say, Rice, Trinity, the University of Texas, or Texas A&M. Well-\nborn's evaluation of Carvell's chances for admission also illustrates the artificial nature of the Texas Index. Although \nCarvell's \"true\" TI score was 191 or 192, Wellborn rated Carvell \"roughly comparable\" to Hopwood, \"slightly better\" \nthan Elliot, and \"significantly better\" than Rogers. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 117. Large institutions such as the [**65]  \nUniversity of Texas use TI scores to make general distinctions among the many students who apply. But a TI score is \nonly as good as its two components--the student's GPA and LSAT score. They are not hard-and-fast numbers determin-\ning who is admitted, nor should they be treated as such, because to do so would  [*894]  unfairly reward students who \nattended weak undergraduate institutions or who took less-than-challenging curricula. In light of the fact that TI scores \nare not weighted by quality of school or difficulty of major, it is not surprising that the plaintiffs' relatively high TI \nscores significantly overstate their chances for admission to the law school and that Wellborn's selections ran the gamut \nfrom high to low TIs. \nSecond, the law school admissions process is incredibly competitive. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 935. In fact, the \nCourt was astonished to discover the number of applicants with drastically better credentials than the four plaintiffs who \nwere denied admission in 1992. For instance, of the 78 nonminority Group C applicants Wellborn selected, 31 were in \nthe top quarter of their classes at competitive universities such as the University of Texas and Texas A&M and had \n[**66]  LSAT scores in the 80th percentile and above. See D-543, 550-51, 555, 557, 560-63, 565, 568, 570, 572-73, \n576-77, 580, 582, 584-85, 587-89, 591-93, 599, 609, 611, 613, and 619. Over one third of Wellborn's Group C selec-\ntions had a college class rank in the 80th percentile or higher; unlike Hopwood, however, these applicants attended \ncompetitive schools and, except for one applicant, had few, if any, hours from a community or junior college. See D-\n543, 551, 556, 558-60, 562, 564-68, 572, 574-76, 578-84, 609, and 611. Applicants similar to Carvell who had a class \nrank below the 70th percentile virtually all came from colleges with an LSAT mean of 34 or better such as Duke, Cor-\nnell, Rice, Tufts, and the University of Texas, and their LSAT scores in all cases were better--and in most cases were \nconsiderably better--than Carvell's combined LSAT score in the 76th percentile. See D-542, 544-45, 547-49, 552, 554, \n569, 594-98, 602-03, 614-15, and 618. Moreover, of the 97 Group A and C applicants Wellborn predicted would have \nbeen probable admittees under a constitutional system, only 2 graduated in the bottom half of their classes, as did Elliot. \nOne applicant earned an LSAT score [**67]  in the 99th percentile and graduated in the 31st percentile of the class at \nthe University of California at Berkeley, a 36 LSAT mean college. See D-524. The other applicant attended the Univer-\nsity of Texas, majored in a rigorous liberal arts honors program called Plan II, was in the 48th percentile of the class, \nand earned an LSAT score in the 96th percentile. 44 See D-529. Wellborn did not select a single applicant who, like \nRogers, had been dismissed from a four-year university or who had graduated from a university with an LSAT college \nmean as low as that of the University of Houston-Downtown. \n \n44   According to Wellborn's supplemental report, these individuals had TI scores of 202 and 198, respectively, \nand thus would probably have been presumptively admitted under a constitutional system. See D-521. \nThird, the applicants Wellborn selected for inclusion in Groups A, B, C, and D have superior credentials to the four \nplaintiffs even when one looks exclusively at a combination of objective factors.  [**68]  After making his 119 selec-\ntions, Wellborn discovered that his selections tended to satisfy the following four criteria: each applicant (1) had an \n \n\n \nLSAT score in the 80th percentile or higher; (2) had a rank in class in his or her university of at least the 60th percentile; \n(3) graduated from a college with an LSAT mean of at least thirty; and (4) had no more than one year in a community or \njunior college. None of the plaintiffs satisfies all four criteria, while the vast majority of Wellborn's selections do. \nMoreover, applicants who did not comply with all four criteria counterbalanced that weakness with a specific strength. \nFor instance, five applicants in Group C have LSAT scores in the 78th percentile, and three applicants in Group A and \none applicant in Group D have LSAT scores in the 74th percentile. Across the board, however, these applicants had \nexceptionally strong college records at high quality institutions. 45  [*895]  Likewise, applicants with low class ranks \noffset that weakness with strong LSAT scores coupled with very competitive universities and/or particularly rigorous \nmajors such as engineering. 46 \n \n45   In Group A, one applicant graduated in the 95th percentile of her class from Washington University, a col-\nlege with an LSAT mean score of 36, see D-5-33; another applicant graduated from the University of Texas in \nthe 90th percentile of her class, see D-539. In Group C, two applicants graduated from Trinity University where \nthey were in the 90th and 86th percentiles of their classes, see D-567 and D-583; another applicant graduated in \nthe 94th percentile of her class at George Washington University, a 33 LSAT mean school, see D-581. \n [**69]  \n46   In addition to the Berkeley and Plan II applicants described supra (D-524 and D-529), one applicant from \nGroup C graduated from Rice with a GPA of 3.40 and had an LSAT score in the 83rd percentile. That applicant \nhad also completed one semester at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas with a GPA of \n3.77. See D-547. Another Group C applicant had a GPA of 2.99 from Rice with a degree in architecture and an \nLSAT score in the 86th percentile; the applicant also earned a master's degree from Princeton and had been \nworking as an architect for many years. See D-605. The final Group C applicant was an engineering major from \nSouthern Methodist University with a 3.07 GPA and had an LSAT score in the 90th percentile. See D-594. \nFourth, the inherently subjective nature of the admissions process does not, as the plaintiffs contend, provide a rea-\nson to believe that distinctions cannot be made among different applicants. Of course, reasonable minds can and do dif-\nfer on the quality of particular institutions or courses of study. For instance, whether accounting is a [**70]  more rigor-\nous major than political science, economics, or English is, to the Court's chagrin, an issue of raging debate among the \nparties in this case. In the Court's opinion, all four courses of study provide a good background for the study of law, and \nthe Court, like Wellborn, tended to focus more on the overall quality of the applicant's undergraduate institution and \ncurriculum in evaluating the application files. And, the plaintiff's protestations to the contrary, Wellborn's opinion re-\ngarding the quality of certain universities is not entirely subjective. He supported his assessment of each institution with \nan objective criterion, the LSAT college mean. 47 Cf. P-414 (discretionary zone screening instructions stating that \"the \nLSAT college mean should be used as a general indicator of the strength of the undergraduate institutions' student \nbody\" and indicating that reviewers should \"'watch out' for inflated GPA's due to community or junior college grades\"). \nEven without such quantifiable data supporting his assessments, the Court is confident Wellborn can fairly evaluate the \nquality of colleges and universities around the nation given his twenty-three years as a law professor [**71]  and fifteen \nyears on the admissions committee. In addition, Hopwood, Carvell, and Rogers do not appear to object to Wellborn's \nuse of the LSAT college mean as a legitimate means of distinguishing among universities or, significantly, to the result-\ning inference Wellborn draws that the applicant's GPA is inflated. Instead, they argue that Wellborn exaggerates the \nimportance of this criterion. The Court finds that argument unpersuasive. One of Wellborn's constant themes throughout \nhis testimony was the notion that the applicant be exposed to a \"rigorous testing ground\" to prepare him or her for the \nstudy of law at an elite law school. See, e.g., Wellborn, vol. 1 at 84. The evidence establishes an applicant's undergradu-\nate institution can be of paramount importance in determining admission, particularly when the student attended a very \nweak school. \n \n47   A small number of applicants attended undergraduate institutions that were too small to provide the statisti-\ncal sampling needed for LSDAS to compile the college LSAT mean. In those instances, Wellborn looked at a \n\"ribbon\" showing the distribution (in terms of percentile rank) of LSAT scores by students who took the LSAT \nfrom that institution. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 44, 103-04. \n [**72]  On the other hand, Hopwood and Carvell also criticize Wellborn for failing to give greater weight to or for \nunevenly evaluating subjective and nonacademic factors such as post-graduate work experience, good personal state-\nments, and improvement in grades over time. 48 First, some of these factors, such as improvement in grades and working \nthrough school, are \"very common,\" see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 68, and/or are generally not given much weight, see Goode \nDeclaration, D-336. 49 Second, although these kinds of subjective  [*896]  factors tended to support Wellborn's assess-\n \n\n \nment of a particular applicant, see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 249, they did not appear to impact Wellborn's selections signifi-\ncantly except in one unusual case. 50 See D-538. Indeed, Wellborn testified that, with respect to marginal candidates in \nparticular, members of the admissions committee tend to focus primarily on an applicant's balanced and consistent col-\nlege performance and LSAT: \n  \n   In general, I think we are talking here about the margin. . . . The unimpeachable candidates have al-\nready been admitted. I'm not asserting that these files I've selected are without fault or without weak-\nnesses. It's a matter [**73]  of relative weaknesses . . . . \nIt's a question, I think, of minimizing risk that over my years on the committee what I see members \ndoing at this margin is looking for belts and suspenders . . . . That's why I put the emphasis on some kind \nof balance here with the LSAT and the college score. Those are the two biggest things . . . . Our feeling is \nthat especially in this middle zone where the LSAT and the college record kind of balance one another, \nthey reinforce one another, it's a little more reassuring, and reassurance is what you are looking for. \nYou're not going to get excited about these margin candidates. \n \n  \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 87-88. \n \n48   This criticism, in the Court's opinion, is puzzling coming from the plaintiffs. At the first trial, the plaintiffs \nrepeatedly emphasized the relative strength of their TI scores--a purely objective factor that did not account for \nthe quality of the applicant's undergraduate institution or curriculum--as compared to minority admittees. See, \ne.g., Hopwood, vol. 2 at 195. \n49   Carvell contends that improvement in grades is an \"important\" criteria simply because the defendants listed \nthis factor first in their answers to interrogatories regarding subjective criteria to be considered in admissions. \nThis argument is absurd. Likewise, the Court rejects the plaintiffs' argument that reviewers must grant preferen-\ntial consideration to subjective factors such as age or work experience because the admissions committee lists \nsuch factors as criteria to consider in determining whether a particular applicant should be admitted. For in-\nstance, Johanson (unlike Hopwood's other reviewers) reacted negatively to the fact that Hopwood had worked \nsubstantially during college; he viewed it as evidence she earned her undergraduate degree on \"a slow track.\" \nSee 1994 trial transcript, Johanson, vol. 5 at 15-16. The Court declines Hopwood's invitation to find that Johan-\nson abused his discretion in failing to consider her work experience a \"plus\" factor. \n [**74]  \n50   Although this applicant, like Hopwood, had a significant number of hours from a junior college, he com-\npleted his associate's degree in two and a half years, had a distinguished military career in the Marine Corps, had \na strong personal statement in which he recounted overcoming an abusive childhood, and, importantly, trans-\nferred to a challenging undergraduate institution (the University of Texas) following junior college. He also had \nseveral strong faculty letters of recommendation. See D-538; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 99. \nPart of the plaintiffs' strategy throughout the remand trial has been to find the files of a small handful of 1992 ad-\nmittees who the law school faculty members opined were as qualified, or in a few instances, perhaps less qualified for \nadmission than the plaintiffs. 51 This evidence does not persuade the Court to disregard the conclusions Wellborn \nreached in his expert report or the assessments made by faculty members who originally reviewed the plaintiffs' files in \n1992. The fact that a small number of admittees 52 had credentials similar to or worse than the plaintiffs [**75]  does not \nlead one to the conclusion that the plaintiffs would have been admitted in a race-neutral process. At most, this evidence \nproves that the plaintiffs had some chance of admission, however slim, a proposition the law school has conceded all \nalong. 53 See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 115. But  [*897]  having \"some\" chance of admission does not correlate to having a \nreasonable chance, which is the inquiry required by the burden of proof in this case. Moreover, the plaintiffs' argument \nrests on a fallacious premise. The plaintiffs have identified the lowest common denominator and, after determining that \nthe plaintiffs meet or exceed that standard, have concluded that the plaintiffs would therefore have a reasonable chance \nof admission (or, conversely, that the defendants cannot prove that the plaintiffs do not have a reasonable chance of \nadmission). The comparison to be drawn, however, is not among individual applicants but among the entire applicant \npool. It simply does not follow that anyone on a par with the least qualified admittee would have a reasonable chance of \nadmission, and it certainly does not reflect the way in which the law school selects its entering classes. Frankly, the \nCourt [**76]  draws quite the opposite inference--the fact that so few applicants comparable to the plaintiffs were actu-\n \n\n \nally admitted in 1992 is evidence that the plaintiffs probably would not have been offered admission in a constitutional \nprocess. \n \n51   Hopwood and Carvell also identify three files (D-605, D-619, and D-632) they contend should not be con-\nsidered under a hypothetical admissions system because they were untimely applications. In fact, only two ap-\nplications (D-605 and D-632) were considered untimely; the other application (D-619) lacked a transcript, an er-\nror that was attributed to the undergraduate institution, not the applicant. The evidence establishes the law school \nnevertheless considered all three applications on their merits in 1992, and the Court therefore sees no reason to \nexclude them from consideration in this case. Even if the Court were to exclude these files from consideration, \nthe Court's conclusions regarding the plaintiffs' chances for admission would not be disturbed. \n52   Indeed, at trial the plaintiffs identified only 4 such applicants out of the 936 applicants who were offered \nadmission in 1992--less than 0.5%. See Sharlot, vol. 2 at 3-6; Wellborn, vol. 1 at 221. \n [**77]  \n53   It might be the case, for instance, that one or more of these individuals were admitted because their parents \nwere influential alumni or generous benefactors of the University of Texas, a practice specifically condoned by \nthe Fifth Circuit. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 946 (\"An admissions process may also consider an applicant's \nhome state or relationship to school alumni.\"). \nFinally, each of the plaintiffs has one or more significant weaknesses in his or her application that are not counter-\nbalanced by a specific strength. Hopwood earned 70 of her undergraduate hours at community colleges. See Johanson \nDeclaration D-332 (indicating that community colleges tend to be \"non-competitive institutions with academically \nweak student bodies and faculties\"); Declaration of Elizabeth Chambliss, D-338 (indicating that less than 1% of resi-\ndent nonminorities admitted in 1992 had more than 70 hours of undergraduate education at a community college or jun-\nior college). Hopwood required 6 years to complete her associate's degree, resulting in an average of 10 credit hours per \nyear. See P-145 [**78]  (LSDAS record); 1994 trial transcript, Johanson, vol. 5 at 15 (stating that Hopwood earned her \nGPA on \"a fairly slow track\"). She subsequently obtained a bachelor's degree from a university that is uncompetitive \nwith the universities attended by the vast majority of students who are admitted to the law school. See Chambliss Decla-\nration, D-338 (indicating that less than 2% of resident nonminorities admitted in 1992 graduated from schools with col-\nlege LSAT mean scores of 28 or below). \nWellborn testified that Hopwood's LSAT score was acceptable for a marginal candidate. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 67. \nLikewise, Hopwood's non-academic strengths (her age, the fact that she was the mother of a handicapped child, had \nworked her way through college, and later became a CPA) merit some \"preferential consideration.\" See Sharlot Decla-\nration D-334. However, according to Wellborn and the admissions committee members who reviewed Hopwood's ap-\nplication in 1992, these positive attributes ultimately do not outweigh the negative aspects of her application, the most \nimportant factor of which is the weakness of her undergraduate education. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 67-68; Johanson Dec-\nlaration [**79]  D-332 (\"Her transcript shows not only that she attended weak schools, but that the bulk of her educa-\ntion was in technical 'how-to' courses rather than academic courses requiring analytic skills. . . . Hopwood is simply not \nwell-prepared academically for Law School.\"); Hamilton Declaration D-333 (stating that Hopwood's undergraduate \nrecord \"reflects little analytic preparation for law school\"); Sharlot Declaration (concluding that Hopwood's file \"is very \nweak in comparison with the overwhelming credentials of so many of our applicants\"). 54 \n \n54   In 1992, Johanson reviewed Hopwood's application file twice--first when he pulled her application from the \npresumptive admit zone and a second time as a part of the initial waiting list screening. See Johanson Declara-\ntion D-332. \nAs the Court noted in Hopwood I, there is little else to Hopwood's file. She provided no letters of recommendation, \nno personal statement, and the handwritten application is among the least impressive in appearance of all of the [**80]  \nfiles examined by the Court. 55 See  [*898]  Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 581; Johanson Declaration D-332 (\"It is also \nstriking to see no letters of recommendation, particularly for an older applicant who has been out of school a while.\"). \nWellborn summed up her application as follows: \n  \n   So the overall picture here I think is one that would raise a lot of concern because we don't have a can-\ndidate who has been tested at a highly competitive college environment as many, many of our applicants \nhave. A lot of it is kind of like high school, frankly, community college, and so forth, and we--of course, \nwe all know from our own personal experience of the high school honor student who goes to the major \n \n\n \nstate university and doesn't fair [sic] very well. It's a lot tougher. And, of course, we feel that the Univer-\nsity of Texas Law School is a lot tougher still. So that would be a concern here. \n \n  \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 68. \n \n55   Hopwood contends the law school should be equitably estopped from arguing that the absence of a personal \nstatement and letters of recommendation in her file weakened her application because of written and oral state-\nments allegedly made by representatives and employees of the law school. Hopwood claims that in May 1991 \nand January 1992 she spoke to unnamed individuals in the law school's admissions office at length about the in-\nformation required to complete her application. Hopwood claims these individuals told her that, based on her \nGPA and LSAT score, she would be within the pool of applicants who would be \"automatically admitted.\" \nHopwood claims that these representations were confirmed by the law school's 1992 bulletin, which indicated \nthat \"approximately 55% of the available admissions are automatically granted\" to candidates reflecting \"out-\nstanding\" GPAs and LSAT scores, see P-172. Based on these statements, Hopwood declined to \"embellish\" her \napplication. This contention is so frivolous it barely merits discussion. Even assuming the statements were made \nand that the law school and the State of Texas should be bound by them, the Court finds that any reliance on \nthose statements was unreasonable. Hopwood did not know what the presumptive admission line would be prior \nto submitting her application; in fact, the line was not lowered to include Hopwood's application until March \n1992, well into the admissions process. \n [**81]  Carvell's \"true\" TI score of 191 or 192 placed him with the group of applicants who were presumptively \ndenied admission in 1992. Only approximately 5% of candidates with TI scores of 191 and 15% of candidates with TI \nscores of 192 were admitted to the law school in 1992; therefore, it is not surprising that Carvell was denied admission, \nas he was among an overwhelming majority of applicants with the same TI score who were not admitted. Although \nCarvell's personal statement was \"well-written,\" see Wellborn, vol. 1 at 127, Wellborn testified that it did not compen-\nsate for the overall weakness of his application. Both Carvell's GPA of 3.28 and LSAT score in the 76th percentile were \nsignificantly below the 1992 overall GPA median of 3.52 and overall LSAT median in the 89th percentile. See Hop-\nwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 563 n.32; Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 937 n.7; see also Sharlot Declaration D-334 (\"The most \nstriking feature [of his file] is his undergraduate GPA at a school with an extremely low mean LSAT score. . . . I am \nalso struck by the fact that this relatively unimpressive performance was by a graduate of what is reputedly one of the \nbest public high schools in the [**82]  state [Highland Park High School in Dallas, Texas].\"); Gergen Declaration D-\n335 (characterizing Carvell as \"an easy no vote\" and indicating that his GPA was weak \"even at a school that I don't \nsuspect is very demanding\"); Goode Declaration D-336 (\"Mr. Carvell's transcript reveals a mediocre academic record \nfrom a mediocre school. . . . If Mr. Carvell could not finish in the top two-fifths of his college class, what chance is \nthere that he would perform well in a much more competitive environment?\"). \nCarvell provided two faculty and two professional letters of recommendation, which one of his 1992 faculty re-\nviewers described as \"strikingly weak.\" See Goode Declaration D-336. At the remand trial, Wellborn described one of \nthe faculty letters as \"not very strong\" and \"vague.\") See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 74. The other faculty letter by all accounts \nis downright negative, characterizing Carvell's classroom performance as disappointing, mediocre, and uneven. See P-\n151; Gergen Declaration D-335 (\"I also cannot help but be impressed by a rare honest letter of recommendation inti-\nmating that Mr. Carvell is either lazy or unfocused.\"); Goode Declaration D-336 (\"It [**83]  is a letter that first damns \nwith faint praise and then damns without faint praise. In this day of inflated grades and recommendations, I would defi-\nnitely take notice of such a tepid assessment of Mr. Carvell's performance as an undergraduate.\"). In addition, Carvell \nwas denied admission  [*899]  to Vanderbilt Law School, a school which was generally considered inferior to the Uni-\nversity of Texas in terms of national reputation. Carvell was also denied admission to the University of Texas Graduate \nSchool of Business, which is less competitive than the law school in terms of admissions, as well as Vanderbilt Busi-\nness School. See Johanson Declaration D-332; Carvell, vol. 4 at 112. \nElliot's weakness, according to Wellborn, was his lack of \"belts and suspenders,\" that is, his \"consistently weak un-\ndergraduate record.\" See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 82; Johanson Declaration D-332 (\"It is preposterous to suggest that the . . . \nchallenged affirmative action program was the cause of his [denial] . . . . Elliot is simply a weak candidate.\"). Wellborn \ntestified that this type of \"disparity\" candidate--an applicant with a high LSAT score and low GPA, or vice versa--is \noccasionally admitted,  [**84]  but only when the scores are high enough to place the individual in the presumptive ad-\nmit zone. See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 88. Under those circumstances, Wellborn testified, \"there is a reason to take risks on \n[such] candidates.\" Wellborn, vol. 1 at 88. Elliot did not provide any faculty letters of recommendation, 56 leaving the \n \n\n \ncommittee members with no information about his college record except his \"rather unimpressive 40th percentile class \nrank.\" See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 81-82. Even Elliot himself acknowledged his weak college record in his personal state-\nment: \"I was an average student, studying when I needed to, partying more than I should, and not managing my time \nefficiently. . . . [My GPA] is not of a caliber expected by the University of Texas School of Law.\" P-153. Furthermore, \nElliot was denied admission to Baylor Law School, a school which is less competitive in terms of admission standards \nand, importantly, one that did not operate a significant affirmative action program in 1992. See Johanson Declaration \nD-332. \n \n56   Although Elliot provided two professional letters of recommendation, Johanson described them as \"not \noverwhelmingly impressive.\" See Johanson Declaration D-332. Additionally, Wellborn testified that members \nof the admissions committee generally tend to focus more heavily on letters of recommendation from faculty \nmembers as opposed to employers because faculty members \"are usually commenting on students in an aca-\ndemic environment, which is what we are looking for.\" Wellborn, vol. 1 at 74. \n [**85]  One of the issues the Court decided in the first trial was whether Elliot had standing to sue the law school. \nFollowing Elliot's rejection by the law school in April 1992, Elliot's father sent a letter to Dean Yudof complaining that \nthe law school had rejected his son's application because of the law school's \"mandatory minority and women quotas.\" 57 \nSee P-165 (copy of the letter sent by Elliot's father). It is undisputed that Elliot's application was thereafter placed under \nreconsideration. Hamilton testified that the law school offered Elliot admission in August 1992, shortly before classes \nwere to begin. The law school asserted at the first trial that Elliot lacked the standing to sue because he declined his of-\nfer of admission. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 565-66. On remand, the Fifth Circuit instructed the Court to recon-\nsider its \"contradictory\" findings in Hopwood I that (1) Elliot was not notified of his admission to the law school, and \n(2) Elliot would not have received an offer of admission even under a constitutional system. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at \n957 n.57. \n \n57   For the record, the law school's 1992 admissions procedures did not impose quotas or grant admissions \npreferences on the basis of sex. Mr. Elliot was mistaken. \n [**86]  As the Court indicated in Hopwood I, Hamilton was the only law school official to testify that Elliot was \nextended an offer of admission. Unlike other applicants who were admitted late in the process, there was no documenta-\ntion in Elliot's file to substantiate Hamilton's claims, and Elliot testified at the first trial that he was unaware he had been \noffered either a place on the waiting list or admission to the law school. See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 565-66. Indeed, \nJohanson testified at the first trial that \"it was 'quite unusual' for someone to be reconsidered and placed on the waiting \nlist without [his] awareness of the decision.\" See id. at 566 & n.44; 1994 trial transcript, Johanson, vol. 5 at 19. Fur-\nthermore, the Court found several discrepancies in Hamilton's trial testimony  [*900]  and affidavit, which, in addition \nto the troubling lack of documentation, \"weighed in Elliot's favor\" in terms of determining whether Elliot had standing \nto sue the law school. See id. at 566. The Court therefore found in Hopwood I that no offer of admission had been \ncommunicated to Elliot, that is, that no offer of admission had been made. 58 Moreover, Elliot's application [**87]  was \nonly placed under reconsideration because of the letter sent by Elliot's father. In a race-neutral world, the letter would \nnot have received the special treatment that it did in 1992, and Elliot's application would not have been reconsidered. \nSee Wellborn, vol. 1 at 80-81. \n \n58   Admittedly, the Court used a poor choice of words when it wrote, \"Elliot was not notified of his admission \nto law school.\" See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 566. The Court recognizes that the sentence could lead one to \nthe implicit conclusion that an offer of admission had been contemplated by the law school but simply not com-\nmunicated to Elliot. The Court did not intend for readers to reach that conclusion and regrets the error. \nWellborn testified that Rogers's extremely weak college record prevented his admission to the law school despite \nhis relatively high LSAT score. Rogers earned a bachelor's degree in professional writing, a non-standard major, from \nthe University of Houston-Downtown, a college with one of the lowest LSAT [**88]  means Wellborn testified he has \never seen. 59 See Wellborn, vol. 1 at 83. Rogers's cumulative GPA of 3.13 was significantly below the overall 1992 GPA \nmedian of 3.52. Although Rogers also received a master's degree in professional writing from the University of South-\nern California in 1992, one of the law school admissions committee members who reviewed his file in 1992 described \nRogers's performance there as \"decidedly unimpressive.\" See Gergen Declaration D-335. Prior to graduating from the \nUniversity of Houston-Downtown, Rogers attended the University of Texas, where he was placed on scholastic proba-\ntion once and flunked out twice over a period of three and a half years. 60 Wellborn concluded that Rogers was \"clearly\" \n \n\n \nthe weakest of all of the applicants with a TI score of 197. Wellborn, vol. 1 at 82. And, Rogers's assertions that he was a \n\"turnaround\" candidate to the contrary, Wellborn testified: \n  \n   This was not the picture of someone who just had a shaky start or one bad semester when they were \nhaving trouble, but this was extended over a three and a half year period. Three strikes. And that was his \nexperience at a major institution. . . . He did make high grades [**89]  later on at his degree school, but \nit's not as through he transferred to a school that would provide a rigorous testing ground in our opinion. \n \n  \nWellborn, vol. 1 at 84. In addition, Rogers provided no letters of recommendation and his answers to the questions on \nthe application form were brief and relatively uninformative. See P-171. Given Rogers's disastrous three and a half \nyears as an undergraduate at the University of Texas and his subsequent failure to distinguish himself academically, the \nCourt is convinced beyond any doubt that Rogers would never be admitted to the law school under any circumstances. \n \n59   The University of Houston -Downtown is a separate campus from the University of Houston-Main Campus, \nand the two campuses therefore have different LSAT college means (26 and 30, respectively). \n60   Rogers argues the fact that he was dismissed from the University of Texas as an undergraduate is not a valid \nreason to deny him admission to the law school. Rogers identifies one individual who also was dismissed from \nthe University of Texas as an undergraduate but who was nevertheless admitted in 1992. See P-304. If anything, \nthe individual identified by Rogers is the exception that proves the rule. See Gergen Declaration, D-335 (\"It \nwould take a great deal of redemption to overcome the disastrous performance as an undergraduate at [the Uni-\nversity of Texas].\"). That applicant had a TI score of 204, received an LSAT score in the 99th percentile, and re-\nturned to the University of Texas at Austin where he participated in the history honors program. See P-304. The \napplicant graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.10 and received almost all A's after his return from academic \ndismissal. In addition, the applicant provided 3 exceptional faculty letters of recommendation. One professor de-\nscribes the applicant as one of the 10 best of the 10,000 students he had ever taught. See P-304. Another de-\nscribes him as better than the 2,500 students he had ever taught; the professor observed, \"on reflection, I wish I \nhad the nerve to ask him to grade the course rather than take it.\" See P-304. Frankly, Rogers's application does \nnot compare. \n [**90]   [*901]  The Court regrets having to discuss publicly and in such great detail the specific weaknesses in \neach of the plaintiffs' applications. It goes without saying that their applications do not reflect the sum of their existence \nas students or individuals. And even though the Court finds the plaintiffs were not denied admission to the law school as \na result of the unlawful use of racial preferences, the Court once again acknowledges \"the gravity of the noneconomic \ninjury to persons denied equal treatment.\" See Hopwood I, 861 F. Supp. at 583. On a final note, being denied admission \nto the University of Texas School of Law should not be the defining moment in any of these plaintiffs' lives. At the risk \nof sounding trite, there are much greater tragedies in life. Each year the law school denies admission to many bright, \nqualified, and deserving individuals simply because there are not enough spaces available in each entering class. The \nplaintiffs should not let their denial letters from 1992--or this lawsuit--continue to determine the course of their lives or \nprevent them from becoming successful lawyers if that is a goal they still wish to pursue. \n \nIV.  \nThe Court makes the following [**91]  alternative findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding each of the \nplaintiffs' damages to ensure there is no third trial and for the benefit of the circuit court. It should be emphasized, how-\never, that the Court made the following finding in the first trial: \"Had the plaintiffs been entitled to damages, none of \nthem established monetary damages as required under the law and rules of this circuit\" because the evidence presented \nmerely \"consisted of each plaintiff's testimony and speculation about the value of a law degree.\" Hopwood I, 861 F. \nSupp. at 583. It is beyond the intellectual skills of this Court to comprehend why the plaintiffs have been given a second \ntrial to present evidence regarding damages when they utterly failed to present competent evidence on damages at the \nfirst trial. 61 Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit has instructed the Court to consider new evidence on damages, including \ndamages allegedly accrued since May 1994. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957 (\"The law school's inability to establish \nthe plaintiff's non-admission . . . opens a panoply of potential relief, depending in part upon what course that plaintiff's \ncareer has taken since trial in mid-1994.\")  [**92]  62 \n \n \n\n \n61   Because the Fifth Circuit gave no weight to the Court's more conclusory finding in its first opinion that the \nplaintiffs did not prove their damages by a preponderance of the evidence, the Court finds it necessary in this \nopinion to provide very detailed and extensive findings regarding damages. \n62   The defendants likewise object to any damage award in light of the Court's factual finding at the first trial \nthat the plaintiffs failed to prove any damages resulting from their rejections by the law school. Additionally, the \ndefendants argue they cannot be held liable for monetary damages because the State of Texas enacted its admis-\nsions program in response to a court-ordered investigation of Texas's public higher education system by the \nUnited States Office of Civil Rights (\"OCR\") and the Department of Education. In the late 1970s, the OCR \nfound that Texas was in violation of Title VI for its failure to eliminate the vestiges of its former de jure segrega-\ntion of public higher education. In an effort to comply with directives from the OCR, Texas instituted a plan to \nincrease enrollment of blacks and Hispanics in public higher education. In June 1983, after years of negotiations \nbetween the OCR and the State of Texas, the OCR conditionally found Texas in compliance with Title VI, but \nthe OCR required Texas to continue to implement plans to increase minority enrollment. These plans paved the \nway for the continued receipt of federal funds for public higher education in Texas. See Hopwood I, 861 F. \nSupp. at 555-57 (discussing the negotiations between the OCR and the State of Texas regarding Texas's failure \nto comply with Title VI). Notwithstanding the factual validity of these two arguments, the Court complied with \nthe instructions of the Fifth Circuit. \n [**93]  Each of the plaintiffs, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, has requested on order from this Court directing \nhis or her admission to the law school. 63 See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 177; Rogers, vol. 2 at 86; Elliot, vol. 3 at 268. To the \nextent the Fifth Circuit concludes the plaintiffs were denied admission as a result of the law school's unconstitutional \nadmissions procedures, an injunction ordering the law school to admit Hopwood,  [*902]  Elliot, and Rogers would be \nthe most appropriate and equitable remedy the Court could fashion. The remaining issues, therefore, are (1) whether \nHopwood, Elliot, and Rogers have proved any economic damages for lost earnings in their second trial; (2) whether \nCarvell has established any economic damages; and (3) whether Hopwood and Carvell have established any damages \nfor mental anguish. 64 The plaintiffs must prove their damages by a preponderance of the evidence, and damages which \nare too speculative, remote, or conjectural cannot be awarded. Collectively, the plaintiffs request over five million dol-\nlars in compensatory damages, three million dollars of which is sought for emotional injuries. This figure is exponen-\ntially higher than the requests [**94]  for damages made at the May 1994 trial. See 1994 trial transcript, T. Smith, vol. \n26 at 40 (counsel for plaintiffs explaining to the Court in closing arguments that the plaintiffs' damages \"are not great\"). \n65 \n \n63   As discussed more fully in Part IV(B) infra, Carvell was the only plaintiff who attended law school follow-\ning his rejection by the University of Texas. \n64   Elliot and Rogers did not seek any mental anguish damages. See Elliot, vol. 3 at 269-71; P-322; Rogers, vol. \n2 at 96-99, 101-11. \n65   This statement by the plaintiffs' lawyer is virtually an admission that the damages after the first trial result \nfrom the lawsuit itself, which damages, of course, are not compensable. The scope and measure of both eco-\nnomic and emotional damages should have been the same after the May 1994 trial and post-appeal. \nHopwood, Elliot, and Rogers request damages for loss of future income resulting from the delay in their legal edu-\ncation. The defendants contend these so-called \"front pay\" damages [**95]  are not available in nonemployment cases, \nin part because they are not foreseeable by educational institutions. 66 They argue that the law school, in rejecting thou-\nsands of applicants each year, does not foresee that denied applicants will forego their law school plans entirely but \nmerely that they will have to attend law school elsewhere. While the foreseeability of a plaintiff's injury is irrelevant in \nthe context of intentional torts, 67 the argument raises two related points. The first point relates to the remote and specu-\nlative nature of the plaintiffs' injuries. The Court emphatically rejects the notion that the defendants' actions prevented \nHopwood, Elliot, and Rogers from becoming lawyers. At most, the law school prevented the plaintiffs from obtaining a \nlaw degree from the University of Texas. Many rejected applicants--Carvell, for instance--successfully attend other law \nschools. The second point pertains to a plaintiff's ability to prove front pay damages in a Title VI case. As a practical \nmatter, front pay damages may simply be too speculative or attenuated given the injury in this case--the denial of a seat \nin law school. Hopwood, Elliot, and Rogers have the burden of [**96]  establishing they would have successfully \ngraduated from the University of Texas and attained full-time employment as lawyers. To the extent this case is re-\nmanded for damages, the Fifth Circuit implicitly rejected the argument that front pay damages are always improper un-\nder Title VI or too speculative as a matter of law. But in determining whether a front pay award is appropriate in this \ncase, the Court must grapple with the inherently speculative nature of the plaintiffs' damages--particularly when, as in \n \n\n \nthe case of Hopwood and Carvell, the requests for damages extend forty years into the future. With these two thoughts \nin mind, the Court now turns to each plaintiff's request for damages. \n \n66   The defendants argue that the evidence Hopwood, Carvell, and Rogers presented on damages is legally in-\nsufficient because they did not compute their future income stream using the below market discount rate method \nset forth in Culver v. Slater Boat Co., 722 F.2d 114 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, Reederei v. Byrd, 467 U.S. \n1252, 82 L. Ed. 2d 842, 104 S. Ct. 3537 (1984); the Court did not consider this argument because it was not fac-\ntually persuaded that these plaintiffs suffered any economic damages. \n [**97]  \n67   The Fifth Circuit overruled the Court's determination that the defendants did not intentionally discriminate \nunder Title VI. See Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 957. \n \nA.  \nHopwood contends she suffered economic damages in the amount of $ 1,360,000, which she claims is the projected \ncareer earnings differential between an accountant, her current profession, and an attorney. See P-477. Hopwood addi-\ntionally seeks $ 1,500,000 in emotional distress damages she claims resulted  [*903]  from her denial of admission to \nthe law school. See P-459. \n(1) Damages for Loss of Future Income \nHopwood is not entitled to any monetary damages for the alleged loss of future income as an attorney. The Court \nfails to find from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood would have completed her law degree by January \n1996: she would not have graduated from law school due to a series of personal tragedies occurring from 1992 to 1996, \nthe time period during which she would have been attending law school. Hopwood contemplated limited enrollment at \nthe law school before she applied for admission in 1992. In a letter [**98]  attached to her application to the law school, \nHopwood sought information regarding reduced participation so that she could continue to care for her severely handi-\ncapped daughter Tara while attending law school. See Hopwood, vol. 1 at 132-33. Hopwood testified at trial that Tara \n\"required a substantial amount of energy and time, and had a large number of doctors appointments and hospital visits \n[and] surgeries.\" See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 239. Furthermore, Hopwood's husband was in the military and traveled exten-\nsively, see Hopwood, vol. 2 at 239, during which time Hopwood was Tara's primary caretaker. In addition, Hopwood \nwas living in San Antonio, Texas at the time and would have been commuting to the law school seventy miles each way \nfor three years. \nHopwood became pregnant with her second daughter Erica in August 1992, immediately before the start of the law \nschool Fall semester. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 221. During what would have been the end of Hopwood's first year in law \nschool, Erica was born. Erica passed away on May 18, 1993, the day following her birth. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 221. \nHopwood continued as Tara's primary caretaker and began experiencing marital [**99]  difficulties due to the stress and \ndepression related to the impending death of Tara and to the demands Hopwood placed on her husband to move away \nfrom Texas. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170-71, 222-23. In June 1995, Hopwood and her husband separated, presumably \nleaving Hopwood as Tara's sole caretaker. On November 23, 1995, Tara passed away. Hopwood, vol. 2 at 176. In Feb-\nruary 1996, Hopwood relocated from San Antonio, Texas to Columbia, Maryland, and her husband moved to Korea. \nSee Hopwood, vol. 2 at 222-23. \nHopwood's limited employment during this time reflects the toll these events took on her professional life. Hop-\nwood was unemployed from June 1991 to January 1993. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 229. From January 1993 to May 1995, \nHopwood worked on a part-time basis as a CPA for a sole proprietorship in San Antonio; although she worked full-time \nduring tax season, she was able to do so only because she frequently worked out of her home. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at \n230-31, 240. In anticipation of her move to Maryland, Hopwood was not employed from May 1995 to February 1996. \nSee Hopwood, vol. 2 at 232. From February 1996 to May 1996, Hopwood worked as an accountant for a temporary \n[**100]  agency, and for most of the remainder of the year she was unemployed. In January 1997, Hopwood received \nher first full-time employment as a CPA since mid-1991. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 228, 233-34. Hopwood testified that \nshe could have worked full time as a CPA during these years, but she choose not to do so in part because she knew she \nhad a limited amount of time with her daughter Tara. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 240. \nThe Court is not suggesting that women with families or severely handicapped children are incapable of success-\nfully pursuing a law degree or that individuals who suffer tremendous personal tragedies lack the will or ability to ac-\ncomplish their goals. However, in this case the facts are clear: Hopwood was facing many serious obstacles, as well as \n \n\n \nenormous time constraints, that would have undermined her ability to earn a law degree during the 1992 to 1996 time \nframe. It would have been virtually impossible for anyone--female or male--to complete a law degree traveling 150 \nmiles per school day to a highly competitive environment such as the University of Texas while undergoing similar  \n[*904]  strains in his or her personal life. 68 Supporting the Court's finding that Hopwood [**101]  would not have \ngraduated from law school is her own testimony. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 172 (testifying that \"Tara died unexpectedly . . \n. I didn't feel I was mentally or emotionally ready to handle what I know is a very difficult coarse [sic] load in the law \nprogram;) Hopwood, vol. 2 at 175-76 (testifying that she has had a \"sporadic work history\" since Tara's death). Hop-\nwood's previous academic performance supports the Court's conclusion as well. It took Hopwood eight years (instead of \nfour) to earn her undergraduate degree because difficult financial circumstances forced her to spend much of her time \nworking. In addition, although Hopwood repeatedly refers to earning a law degree as a lifelong dream, she has not dem-\nonstrated her commitment to that goal by seeking admission to any law school following her rejection from the Univer-\nsity of Texas in 1992. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 172. \n \n68   The Court is not finding Hopwood incapable of passing the courses; to the contrary, to the degree Hopwood \nwould have been able to take and complete her courses, the Court believes she would have received a passing \ngrade. \n [**102]  Even assuming Hopwood would have completed her law degree, the evidence she proffered to prove eco-\nnomic damages did not reasonably predict any loss in earnings she may have suffered as a result of her denial of admis-\nsion to the law school. Hopwood's first expert witness regarding her economic damages was economist Wayne E. Ru-\nhter, Ph.D. Ruhter performed two analyses, \"Analysis I\" and \"Analysis III,\" to determine the career earnings differential \nbetween attorneys and accountants. See P-477. In Analysis I, Ruhter compared attorney salaries in the private sector in \nTexas and the mid-Atlantic region with accountant salaries in Philadelphia. 69 See P-477, Exhibit I, Tab 3, Analysis 1-\nTable 3. Ruhter assumes Hopwood would progress from associate to partnership level in both career paths. In Analysis \nIII, he utilized 1990 Census data, which did not reflect any particular career path or geographic location, to determine \nthe difference in career earnings between female attorneys and female accountants. See P-477, Exhibit III, Tab 3, \nAnalysis 3-Table 3. In both Analysis I and III, Ruhter assumed Hopwood would have graduated from law school, \npassed the bar exam, attained full-time [**103]  employment by January 1996, and continued working until she reached \nage 75 in the year 2037. Subtracting the costs of attending law school, Ruhter concluded the present value of Hop-\nwood's economic damages to be $ 424,604 in Analysis I and between $ 400,364 and $ 416,876 in Analysis III. See Ru-\nhter, vol. 2 at 258, 265-66. Finally, Ruhter concluded in Analysis II that Hopwood could not have mitigated her dam-\nages by enrolling in law school in 1997. 70 See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 272. \n \n69   Ruhter relied on the David J. White Survey for attorney salaries in private law firms in Dallas, Houston, \nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Ruhter gave special consideration to attorney salaries in Texas \nbecause many graduates of the law school remain in Texas following graduation. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 254. He \nalso considered attorney salaries from the mid-Atlantic region because that is where Hopwood is currently liv-\ning. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 253-54. For data on accountant salaries, Ruhter relied on the ROMAC Report. \n70   Ruhter did not examine whether Hopwood could have mitigated her damages by enrolling in law school in \n1993, 1994, 1995, or 1996. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 65. \n [**104]  In the Court's opinion, Ruhter's expert report was riddled with so many untenable premises, logical incon-\nsistencies, and unreliable and inappropriate sources that it cannot support an award of economic damages. By Ruhter's \nown admission, his expert report is merely \"an evaluation of two career paths\" that examines the potential career earn-\nings that are \"available\" to Hopwood as an attorney and an accountant. Ruhter, vol. 2 at 253, vol. 3 at 48, 53. Ruhter \nunequivocally stated that he did not specifically attempt to \"forecast\" Hopwood's losses. Ruhter, vol. 3 at 71. Further-\nmore, prior to preparing his expert report, Ruhter did not interview Hopwood or her current employer or obtain enough \ninformation about Hopwood to predict her future earnings capacity to any reasonable degree of certainty. See Ruhter, \nvol. 3 at 45, 48-49. It is from this initial, misguided premise that all other errors in his report flow. Some, but by no  \n[*905]  means all, of the more glaring problems are described below. \nFirst consider Analysis I. The accountant career path does not reasonably predict Hopwood's future earnings. Ru-\nhter uses salary information from Philadelphia to predict future earnings (even [**105]  for 1997) instead of reasonably \npredicting earnings from her current employment in Columbia, Maryland. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 53. Similarly, the attor-\nney career path is implausibly optimistic, resulting in wildly inflated future earnings. Ruhter assumes Hopwood would \n(1) become a partner (2) in eight years (3) in a private law firm (4) in a large city in Texas or the mid-Atlantic region. \nThat particular career path is one of the most lucrative a lawyer can take and is extremely difficult and rare. See D-513, \n \n\n \nReport of Stephen Mims; Ruhter, vol. 3 at 48-49 (recognizing that salaries for private law firm practice are generally \nhigher than for government, corporate, or public interest practice); Mims, vol. 3 at 236 (stating that approximately less \nthan 9% of University of Texas law graduates from the class of 1987 are partners at large law firms by the year 1996). \nFurthermore, because empirical information related to partnership buy-ins was unavailable, those costs are not reflected \nin Analysis I. 71 See Ruhter, vol. 2 at 268-69. The Court also questions the use of the David J. White Survey as an ap-\npropriate source to project the growth rate of attorney salaries.  [**106]  See D-684, Tab 17 (indicating the survey does \nnot ensure that the same law firms respond to the survey each year it is given). \n \n71   Even more troubling to the Court is Ruhter's failure to account for the benefits of not being a lawyer. Pre-\nsumably one of the reasons for the salary differential is that, on average, lawyers tend to work longer, harder \nhours than accountants and require more years of education. It seems inherently unfair to award Hopwood the \nlifetime salary differential between accountant and attorney earnings without even attempting to take into ac-\ncount such quality of life issues. \nThe most compelling reason to discount Analysis I, however, is its logical inconsistency. Hopwood graduated with \nan accounting degree in 1988 and earned her CPA license in 1991. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 140-41. Ruhter does not be-\ngin to measure Hopwood's earnings capacity as an accountant, however, until 1997. Prior to 1997, Ruhter uses Hop-\nwood's actual earnings, which, due to her personal circumstances, were low.  [**107]  See P-483. Had Ruhter properly \nmeasured Hopwood's earnings capacity as a CPA starting in 1992, his own methodology reflects that she would have \nearned more money over her lifetime by continuing to work as an accountant as opposed to enrolling in law school in \n1992. See D-508, Report of James R. Vinson, Ph.D., Table I (indicating that Hopwood's career earnings as a CPA \nwould have exceeded her attorney career earnings by $ 31,412); see also Ruhter, vol. 2 at 271 (acknowledging that there \nis an opportunity cost associated with a delay in education). If, as Ruhter testified, Analysis I was intended to be a hypo-\nthetical comparison of the lifetime earnings available to Hopwood as an accountant and as a lawyer, the analysis should \nhave accounted for Hopwood's ability to earn as an accountant since the time she earned her degree in 1988 or, at the \nvery latest, since she obtained her CPA license in 1991. \nThe chief problem with Analysis III is the unreliability and inappropriateness of the Census data which serves as \nthe source for Ruhter's conclusions. The salary information reflected in the data is self-reported by employees. Self-\nreporting does not, in and of itself, necessarily [**108]  render the data inaccurate, but in this case there are other indicia \nof unreliability. First, some of the data is implausible on its face. For instance, the Census includes salary, information \non individuals with less than a high school education who claim to be lawyers. See P-477, Exhibit III, Tab 11. Second, \nthe Census significantly undervalues Hopwood's future earnings potential as an accountant because the data pertaining \nto accountant salaries includes information for bookkeepers and accountants who, unlike Hopwood, have not obtained a \nCPA license. See Ruhter, vol 3 at 44-45, 94-95. Unrelated to the problem of self-reporting is the fact that salary infor-\nmation is categorized by age and, consequently, years of experience. While the average age of a female law graduate is \ntwenty-six, Hopwood would have been thirty-four had she graduated from the law school in 1995. See Ruhter, vol. 2 at \n266. Ruhter overstates Hopwood's  [*906]  earnings potential as a lawyer because the Census data he uses in Analysis \nIII compares Hopwood to females who, as a result of their additional eight years of experience, would undoubtedly have \nhigher earnings than Hopwood. See P-477, Exhibit III,  [**109]  Tab 11. Ruhter belatedly recognized this problem and \nperformed Alternative Analysis III, in which he replaces the Census data related to lawyer salaries for the years 1995 to \n2000 with data from the David J. White Survey. This approach is perhaps even more flawed because it improperly com-\npares two sources of data for attorney salaries (five years of data from the David J. White Survey and thirty-five years \nof data from the Census) and only one source of data for accountant salaries (forty years of data from the Census). As \nRuhter himself acknowledged, as a general rule it is inappropriate to use different sources of information in a compara-\ntive study because doing so can create a bias in the results. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 56. \nThe remaining $ 900,000 Hopwood claims in economic damages is based on the testimony of Bradford W. Hilde-\nbrandt. Hildebrandt is chairman of Hildebrandt, Inc., a management consultant and placement firm related to the legal \nprofession. See D-501 (Hildebrandt's Report). Hildebrandt is not an economist and did not perform an independent \nstudy of Hopwood's economic losses. See Hildebrandt, vol. 3 at 106. Instead, he reviewed the accuracy of the attorney \n[**110]  compensation figures in the private sector as reflected in Ruhter's Analysis I. Hildebrandt testified that Ruhter's \nfigures, which project an average annual partner salary of $ 219,699, undervalue partnership compensation for Univer-\nsity of Texas graduates by approximately $ 100,000 per year. See Hildebrandt, vol. 3 at 107. The Court rejects Hilde-\nbrandt's testimony for two reasons. First, Hildebrandt's testimony was wholly dependent upon the accuracy of Ruhter's \nAnalysis I, which the Court has already found unpersuasive. Second, his testimony was inapposite to Hopwood's case. It \nis sheer speculation whether Hopwood would have completed law school, much less whether she would have had an \n \n\n \nacademic record sufficient to result in her recruitment by a private law firm, whether she would have remained at that \nlaw firm for eight years, and whether she would have been selected as a partner in that law firm. In short, Hopwood has \nfailed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she has suffered the economic damages alleged as a result of \nbeing denied admission to the law school. \n(2) Mental Anguish Damages \nNeither the Supreme Court nor the Fifth Circuit has specifically held [**111]  that mental anguish damages are re-\ncoverable in a suit brought pursuant to Title VI. Although a majority of the Supreme Court in Guardians Association v. \nCivil Service Commission of City of New York, 463 U.S. 582, 103 S. Ct. 3221, 77 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1983), would allow a \nplaintiff to recover compensatory damages for intentional violations of Title VI, the Supreme Court did not definitively \ndescribe the scope of such remedies under the statute. See Shinault v. American Airlines, Inc., 936 F.2d 796, 803 (5th \nCir. 1991) (quoting Guardians for the proposition that damage remedies under Spending Clause statutes such as Title \nVI may be limited). The lower federal courts have been grappling with the issue since Guardians, and the law in this \narea is therefore somewhat muddled. See, e.g, Eastman v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., 939 F.2d 204, 208 (4th Cir. 1991) \n(concluding that compensatory damages for pain and suffering are not available under Title VI and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. ß 794 (West 1994), which forbids discrimination on the basis of dis-\nability). \nIn Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 71, 112 S.  [**112]  Ct. 1028, 1035, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 \n(1992), the Supreme Court held that \"federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief\" under Title IX, a \nstatute that was patterned after Title VI. 72 Since Franklin, the strong trend among federal courts is to allow plaintiffs to \nrecover for mental injuries under Title VI and similar  [*907]  federal anti-discrimination statutes. See Rodgers v. Mag-\nnet Cove Pub. Sch., 34 F.3d 642, 644 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding that \"the full spectrum\" of legal and equitable remedies \nare available under Title VI and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973); Waldrop v. Southern Co. Serv., Inc., 24 \nF.3d 152, 156-157 (11th Cir. 1994) (citing Franklin for the holding that the full panoply of legal remedies are available \nunder Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act); Pandazides v. Virginia Bd. of Educ., 13 F.3d 823, 830 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(overruling Eastman in light of Franklin). In any event, this issue is a question of law that is better left to the Fifth Cir-\ncuit should the panel deem it proper to reach the issue of damages. The Court merely assumes for purposes of this order \nthat mental anguish damages are recoverable under Title VI.  [**113]   \n \n72   Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. ßß 1681-1688 (West 1994) (\"Title IX\"). Title IX \nprevents discrimination on the basis of sex by any education program or activity receiving federal funds. See 20 \nU.S.C. ß 1681(a). \nTo the extent the Court fails to find by a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood would have completed her \nlaw degree, the defendants are not liable for any mental anguish damages because there is no causal connection between \nthe harm and the violation. See, e.g., Patterson v. P.H.P Healthcare Corp., 90 F.3d 927, 938 (5th Cir. 1996) (asserting \nthe general principle that there must a causal connection between the injury and any award for damages). Even assum-\ning Hopwood would have earned a degree from the law school, several of Hopwood's claims for emotional injury are \nnot compensable because they are not the result of the defendants' conduct. For example, claims for damages related to \nHopwood's allegation that the defendants falsely maligned her qualifications in [**114]  the media pertain to the litiga-\ntion she initiated and the justifiable defense of this case and therefore are not recoverable. 73 See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 187-\n90 (describing her voluntary media appearances and interviews). Other claims for damages, such as her contention that \nthe law school's discrimination was a factor that caused her to begin smoking, are frivolous and do not merit discussion. \n \n73   Carvell was also \"upset\" and \"bothered\" by public statements made by the defendants and other state offi-\ncials during the pendency of this case. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 108. These damages, if they exist, are not com-\npensable. \nHopwood testified she experienced frustration, depression, disappointment, diminished self-confidence, and anger \nas a result of being denied admission to the law school. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170. In her interrogatory responses, \nHopwood also claims feelings of hopelessness, confusion, anxiety, embarrassment, inability to concentrate, indecisive-\nness, inadequacy, and stigmatization.  [**115]  See; P-459; P-464. Finally, she contends her rejection by the law school \nindirectly strained her marriage. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 170-71; P-470 (deposition testimony of friend confirming these \nfeelings). Hopwood testified she did not experience any physical symptoms or pain, nor did she seek any psychiatric or \nmedical care, as a result of being denied admission, although she did occasionally discuss the situation with a therapist \nfrom whom she had sought grief counseling following Erica's death. See Hopwood, vol. 2 at 217-18. \n \n\n \nIn addition to Hopwood's testimony, the Court heard corroborating evidence regarding the nature and extent of her \nemotional injuries from Paul Lees-Haley, Ph.D. Lees-Haley is a forensic psychologist, not a mental health provider, and \nhas never treated Hopwood for any mental injury. Rather, Lees-Haley evaluated Hopwood based upon her self-reported \ncomplaints to determine whether Hopwood suffered any emotional injury as a result of the defendants' actions. See P-\n526 (Expert Report); Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 153. Lees-Haley testified that Hopwood suffered some emotional distress \nfrom three independent sources: (1) the law school's discrimination [**116]  against her, (2) the law school's rejection \nof her application for admission, and (3) public comments made by the law school and her interactions with lawyers in \nthe case. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 152. \nLees-Haley diagnosed Hopwood with chronic \"adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,\" \nwhich he believes occurred partly in response to the \"stressor\" 74 of being denied admission and of  [*908]  being a vic-\ntim of discrimination. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 155-56. He states in his report that adjustment disorder \"typically re-\nsolves within six months unless the symptoms are in response to . . . a stressor that has enduring consequences,\" such as \nHopwood's rejection from the law school. P-526. Lees-Haley also testified that the law school's actions aggravated other \nmental injuries, such as those resulting from the deaths of her children, the break-up of her marriage, and the loss of a \njob. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 152; P-526 (\"[Hopwood] plausibly suggests that had she been accepted to law school, \nsome of the other problems and their effects might have been mitigated to some degree . . . because at least she would \nnot have had the feeling she had lost all of her [**117]  dreams at once.\"). On the other hand, Lees-Haley testified that \nthe law school's actions \"might have caused some mild disability in the sense of making it harder for her to concen-\ntrate,\" but that they have not caused Hopwood any \"permanent\" problems that will cause her \"pain and suffering and \ndisability . . . for the rest of her life.\" Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 154; vol. 3 at 209-11 (indicating that Hopwood is not suffer-\ning from any disability and is fully functional). Moreover, he opined that Hopwood would not have had a diagnosable \nmental condition were it not for other negative \"stressors\" in her life. See Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 220-21. \n \n74   Lees-Haley defines a \"stressor\" as an experience, either positive or negative, \"that usually involves change \nin the patient's life that's great enough that it requires some coping or adjustment.\" Lees-Haley, vol. 3 at 192. \nHopwood has had more than her share of tragedies, both before and after she was denied admission to the law \nschool, all of which have caused her [**118]  severe emotional distress. Without doubt, the evidence establishes the \nleast traumatic \"stressor\" in her life was the law school's denial of her application. However, because of the unusual \ncircumstances occurring in Hopwood's personal life from 1992 through 1996 and her mental condition, the Court would \nfind from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood has suffered mental anguish damages as a result of the law \nschool's rejection of her application. The denial of admission aggravated Hopwood's preexisting emotional injuries be-\nyond the mere hurt feelings, frustration, and anger that are a part of everyday life. See Patterson, 90 F.3d at 940. Ac-\ncordingly, the Court would find from a preponderance of the evidence that Hopwood has sustained mental anguish \ndamages in the amount of $ 6,000 as a result of the law school's rejection of her application for admission. \n \nB.  \nCarvell is the only plaintiff who pursued a law degree in 1992 after his rejection from the law school. Carvell \ngraduated with a joint degree in law and a master's in business administration from Southern Methodist University \n(\"SMU\") in 1996. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 101. Since August 1996, he has been employed [**119]  as an attorney with the \nprivate law firm of Bickel & Brewer in Dallas, Texas, 75 where he was earning a starting salary of $ 50,000 plus benefits \nat the time of trial (Carvell has since earned a pay increase). See Carvell, vol. 4 at 105-06, 114-15. Carvell seeks total \neconomic damages in the amount of $ 705,886, consisting of $ 40,036 in increased tuition for attending SMU and $ \n665,850 in damages resulting from the diminished value of an SMU law degree. 76 See P-478. Additionally, Carvell \nseeks $ 1,500,000 in mental anguish damages resulting from the law school's discrimination against him and the denial \nof his application for admission. See P-460. \n \n75   Employment in Dallas by private law firms (with their attendant high starting salaries) is one of the positive \nbenefits of graduating from SMU Law School, as the school purposefully seeks to place its graduates in the Dal-\nlas law market. \n76   When specifically questioned by his counsel at the May 1994 trial whether he was claiming any loss in earn-\nings as a result of his rejection by the law school, Carvell explicitly stated he was not. See 1994 trial transcript, \nCarvell, vol. 10 at 9-10. \n [**120]  (1) Tuition Differential \n \n\n \nCarvell would have attended the University of Texas over SMU Law School had he been admitted to the law \nschool in  [*909]  1992. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 98; 1994 trial transcript, Carvell, vol. 10 at 9. Accordingly, the Court \nfinds from a preponderance of the evidence the difference in the cost of tuition between the two schools was $ 40,036. \nSee P-478, Exhibit 2, Table 2; Ruhter, vol. 3 at 4. \n(2) Damages for Loss of Future Income \nRuhter calculated the diminished value of Carvell's degree by comparing the difference in earnings hypothetically \navailable to University of Texas and SMU law graduates based upon the average starting associate salaries of all private \nlaw firms that recruited at those two schools in 1995, regardless of whether those firms actually hired graduates of those \ntwo law schools that year. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 3; P-478, Exhibit 3, Table 3. Ruhter did not identify any salary differen-\ntial at the partnership level because he was unaware of any empirical information available to calculate it; therefore, \nRuhter analyzed Carvell's alleged lost earnings only as an associate until the year 2003. See Ruhter, vol. 3 at 80-81;  \n[**121]  P-478, Exhibit 3, Table 3. Ruhter testified that the present value of the earnings differential was $ 11,850. Ru-\nhter, vol. 3 at 4. Hildebrandt reviewed the accuracy of the figures contained in Ruhter's report. He testified that Ruhter \nunderestimated Carvell's losses by not carefully analyzing \"the weight of the law schools\" and by not including any \ndamages for the differential in partnership compensation between graduates of SMU and the law school. Hildebrandt \ntestified these damages were approximately $ 50,000 per year, for a total of $ 654,000. Hildebrandt, vol. 3 at 110-11. \nThe Court fails to find from a preponderance of the evidence that Carvell is entitled to any damages for loss of fu-\nture income; indeed, his requests for economic damages are counterfactual. First, Carvell did not use the Career Serv-\nices Office at SMU to obtain any employment. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 122. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the \naverage starting salaries of law firms that recruit at the University of Texas and SMU provides an inappropriate basis for \nmeasuring damages in Carvell's case. Second, Ruhter calculates Carvell's lost earnings beginning in mid-1995 even \nthough Carvell did [**122]  not graduate from law school until May 1996. See Carvell, vol. 2 at 122. Third, the \"oppor-\ntunity\" differential between SMU and the University of Texas is due in large part to the high starting salaries of national \nfirms and regional boutiques which tend to recruit more heavily at the University of Texas. In general; these firms only \nhire top-tier students with very strong academic records. See Jones, vol. 4 at 82-84. Carvell, however, graduated in the \nthird quarter of his class at SMU; therefore, these higher earnings probably would not have been available to Carvell \nbecause he would not have had an academic record at the University of Texas sufficient to result in recruitment by those \nfirms. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 114. Fourth, in requesting $ 654,000 for the differential in partnership compensation, Car-\nvell apparently overlooked the salient fact that he is not on partnership track at Bickel & Brewer. 77 See Carvell, vol. 4 at \n106. \n \n77   To the extent Carvell implies he might have been considered for partnership track at Bickel & Brewer had \nhe graduated from the University of Texas, that proposition is ridiculous. One of the name partners of that firm \nis a graduate of SMU Law School, so it is highly unlikely that members of the firm regard SMU law alumni un-\nfavorably. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 124; D-653. \n [**123]  Carvell proffered speculative evidence that he has suffered lost earnings as a result of not obtaining his \ndegree from the law school. In fact, the evidence suggests Carvell has suffered no loss in earnings: Carvell's starting \nsalary is higher than the average starting salary for graduates of the University of Texas in 1995. See D-685, Tab 4 (in-\ndicating that the average starting salary for 1995 University of Texas graduates was $ 49,761); D-685, Tab 8 (indicating \nthat the average starting salary for 1995 SMU graduates was $ 51,464). Even assuming an earnings differential exists \nand that it can be quantified to a reasonable degree of certainty--a notion the Court seriously doubts--the statistics re-\ngarding average starting salaries in private, government, corporate, and public interest practice suggest the differential \nactually favors SMU graduates. See D-685, Tab 4 & 8. Moreover, Carvell proffered no evidence that private law firms \ndistinguish among lawyers, in terms of salary and/or benefits, on the  [*910]  basis of where they obtained their law \ndegree. True, graduates of highly regarded universities tend to have enhanced career opportunities over graduates of \nuniversities that are [**124]  not as highly regarded. But, in the Court's opinion, the ability of an individual to succeed \nin his or her profession depends much more upon the value of that individual rather than the value of his or her degree. \n78 \n \n78   In any prestigious area of the law one examines, from top practitioners to Supreme Court Justices, few peo-\nple know which law school the individual attended, and, presumably, not all such individuals are graduates of \nthe University of Texas. \n(3) Mental Anguish Damages \n \n\n \nCarvell testified he experienced disappointment, anxiety, stress, shock, frustration, and anger and that he became \nwithdrawn from others as a result of his denial of admission to the law school. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 98-101; P-472 \n(deposition testimony of friend confirming these feelings). In his interrogatory responses, Carvell also indicated he suf-\nfered feelings of confusion, depression, embarrassment, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation, indecisiveness, di-\nminished confidence, inadequacy, stigmatization, and [**125]  diminished self-esteem. See P-460; P-465. On the other \nhand, he testified he was not \"shattered or crippled\" by the experience and that he is functioning well at his current em-\nployment. See Carvell, vol. 4 at 101. Moreover, Carvell never sought psychiatric or medical treatment for any emotional \ninjuries caused by the defendants' conduct, even though he has suffered from \"very serious and substantial mental health \nproblems in the past.\" Carvell, vol. 4 at 101, 119-20; Carvell Stipulation 1. \nAs with Hopwood, Lees-Haley evaluated Carvell's self-reported complaints to determine the nature and extent of \nhis emotional injuries resulting from the defendants' actions. Lees-Haley stated in his expert report that \"Carvell appears \nto have a chronic, mild depression that pre-existed this injury and continues to the present, which was temporarily \nmildly aggravated by not being admitted to the University of Texas School of Law and by discovering that he was the \nsubject of race discrimination.\" See P-527 (emphasis added). The Court does not find from a preponderance of the evi-\ndence that the denial of admission caused Carvell any compensable emotional injuries, either by themselves [**126]  or \nresulting from the alleged temporary aggravation of his preexisting depression. The denial, at most, resulted in the mere \nhurt feelings, frustration, and anger that are simply a part of everyday life. \n \nC.  \nElliot seeks $ 56,021 in lost earnings he contends resulted from his delayed entry into the workforce as a lawyer \nduring the pendency of this lawsuit. He arrived at this figure by calculating the five-year differential, adjusted for infla-\ntion and discounted to present value, between his current salary as a CPA and the average starting salary of 1995 gradu-\nates of the law school. The Court does not find from a preponderance of the evidence that Elliot has suffered any loss in \nearnings as an attorney that can be reasonably attributed to his rejection by the law school. Elliot declined an offer of \nadmission to attend Texas Tech Law School in 1992. See Elliot, vol. 3 at 273. Therefore, the delay in his legal education \nresulted not from the law school's admissions procedures but from Elliot's deliberate choice not to attend Texas Tech. \nFurthermore, separate from the issue of the remoteness of the injury is the issue of whether Elliot has mitigated his \ndamages. Elliot could [**127]  have attended Texas Tech in 1992 or he could have applied to other law schools within \nthe last five years. The damages Elliot seeks are also speculative and remote. \n \nD.  \nRogers seeks compensatory damages of $ 332,867.94 plus one third of any amount awarded in attorneys' fees. 79 \nSee D-660, Exhibit A. Rogers claims approximately  [*911]  $ 200,000 in lost wages as a lawyer during the pendency of \nthe lawsuit; roughly half the lost earnings he claims are losses he sustained in unpaid loans he made to his business. 80 In \naddition, Rogers seeks $ 200 for the cost of reapplying to the law school, $ 795 to attend a Princeton Review LSAT \ncourse, $ 950 in costs to move back to Austin in the event the Court orders an injunction, a minority scholarship in the \namount of $ 20,000 plus tuition for three years, and $ 909.24 in expenses for voluntarily attending a conference on af-\nfirmative action in California. The Court does not find from a preponderance of the evidence that Rogers has sustained \nany economic damages as a result of his rejection by the law school. The reasons are essentially the same for which the \nCourt denied Elliot's request for damages--the damages alleged are not attributable [**128]  to the defendants' conduct \nand are speculative and remote. Rogers declined an offer to attend the University of Houston School of Law in 1992. \nSee Rogers, vol. 2 at 100. The remaining requests for damages (those that do not relate to Rogers's request for lost earn-\nings) are frivolous and do not merit discussion. \n \n79   At trial, Rogers testified he sustained losses of approximately $ 382,000. See Rogers, vol. 2 at 95-96; P-325. \nBecause Rogers failed to supplement his interrogatory responses regarding the extent of his damages as required \nduring discovery, the Court considered only his original request. \n80   This last contention--that the State of Texas should pay for Rogers's poor business judgment--sounds like a \nbad joke and, perhaps, betrays a lack of analytical skills Rogers will sorely need if he intends to succeed in law \nschool. \n \nV.  \n \n\n \nTitle 42 of the United States Code, Section 1988, provides that a court \"in its discretion, may allow the prevailing \nparty, other than the United States, a reasonable [**129]  attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" The Court denied the plain-\ntiffs' original requests for fees and expenses following the May 1994 trial, concluding that the plaintiffs, although pre-\nvailing parties under statute, only attained de minimis relief. The plaintiffs separately appealed that judgment on Janu-\nary 9, 1995. On July 26, 1996, the Fifth Circuit granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the Court's judgment on attor-\nneys' fees and remanded the case with an instruction to reconsider whether the fees and expenses requested at the trial \nand appellate levels were reasonable and necessary for the prosecution of this case. The plaintiffs' attorneys purportedly \nspent 7,241.41 hours litigating this case, and the fees and expenses sought exceed $ 1.5 million. \nAt the May 1994 trial, the plaintiffs were represented by (1) Steven Smith; (2) Terral Smith; (3) Joseph Wallace, \nPaul Harris, R. Kenneth Wheeler, and Scott Wilson of the private law firm of Wallace, Harris & Sims (\"WHS\"), located \nin West Virginia; and (4) Michael McDonald, Michael Rosman, Vincent Mulloy, Michael Troy, and Joseph Shea of the \nCenter for Individual Rights (\"CIR\"), a not-for-profit, public interest law firm located in [**130]  Washington, D.C. \nSteven Smith is an Austin sole practitioner who initiated the suit. He was the only attorney representing the plaintiffs \nduring the first eight months of the case. Terral Smith, also a sole practitioner in Austin, conducted the majority of the \ntrial presentation. Along with Terral Smith (although to a lesser degree), Wallace participated in the trial presentation, \nwhile the other attorneys of WHS assisted in trial preparation. The CIR's main involvement in the case was to conduct \nmost of the legal research, write all legal briefs, and bankroll the case. Following the 1994 trial, the plaintiffs sought \nfees and expenses of $ 853,847.69 for 4,840.56 hours of work (\"trial hours\"). 81 After the successful appeal of this case, \nthe plaintiffs increased their requests to $ 941,391.24 to reflect current hourly billing rates. 82 \n \n81   The first set of attorneys' fee applications were filed on August 29, 1994. One application was submitted on \nbehalf of Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and WHS. Steven Smith sought compensation for 1,552 hours at $ 125 per \nhour plus $ 164.21 in expenses for a total of $ 194,164.21. Terral Smith sought compensation for 837.80 hours \nat $ 225 per hour for a total of $ 188,505.00. WHS sought compensation for 1,005.82 hours plus $ 151.09 in ex-\npenses for a total of $ 171,104.34. The billing rates for WHS ranged from $ 95 to $ 200 per hour. The second \napplication, filed on behalf of CIR, sought $ 235,461.95 in fees for 1,444.94 hours of work and $ 64,526.19 in \nexpenses, for total compensation of $ 299,988.14. CIR's rates ranged from $ 125 to $ 230 per hour. \n [**131]  \n82   In their supplemental requests for attorneys fees filed on October 1, 1996, Hopwood and Carvell argue that \nthe original request for fees should be adjusted in order to compensate for the delay in payment. The adjusted \nfigures are $ 362,250.19 for CIR (representing current rates of $ 150 to $ 280 per hour) and $ 196,471.84 for \nWHS (representing a current rate for Wallace at $ 250 per hour). \n [*912]  Beginning in November 1994, the plaintiffs (for reasons unknown to the Court) obtained separate represen-\ntation on appeal to the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court. Hopwood and Carvell were represented by (1) Theodore \nOlson, Douglas Cox, Thomas Hungar, Walter J. Scott, and Daniel Nelson of the Washington, D.C. office of Gibson, \nDunn & Crutcher (\"GDC\"); and (2) McDonald, Rosman, Troy, and Hans Bader of CIR. 83 Terral Smith and Steven \nSmith remained counsel of record for Elliot and Rogers. GDC primarily handled the appeal relating to the constitution-\nality of the law school's use of racial preferences, including briefing the issues to both appellate courts and arguing the \ncase to the Fifth Circuit. CIR worked [**132]  on the appeals relating to the proposed interventions by several minority \ngroups and this Court's denial of attorneys' fees. In addition, CIR had primary responsibility for coordinating activity \namong the lawyers representing Hopwood and Carvell. It appears Terral Smith and Steven Smith assisted GDC with the \ntrial record only--their billing records demonstrate they did little independent appellate work and instead relied on GDC \nto argue the merits of the case to the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs seek fees and expenses of $ \n614,138.56 for 2,400.85 hours of work during the appellate phase of this case (\"appellate hours\"). 84 \n \n83   WHS did not represent any of the plaintiffs on appeal, but Joseph Wallace (now with the law firm of Harris \n& Bush) consulted with GDC, CIR, and Terral Smith during the appeal on a limited basis. \n84   The post-appeal applications were filed beginning in October 1996. One application for attorneys' fees was \nfiled on behalf of CIR, GDC, and Wallace. CIR seeks total compensation of $ 243,421.68, consisting of $ \n195,897.50 in fees for 909.8 hours, $ 17,638.56 in expenses, and $ 29,885.62 in interest. GDC seeks compensa-\ntion of $ 287,925.00 in fees for 1,010.5 hours of work and $ 4,189.87 in expenses for a total of $ 292,114.87. \nGDC's hourly rates range from $ 450 to $ 275 per hour. Wallace seeks compensation for 18 hours at $ 250 per \nhour, plus expenses of $ 70.30 and interest of $ 25.50, for a total of $ 4,595.50. Terral Smith submitted a post-\nappeal application seeking compensation for 155.8 hours at $ 225 per hour for a total of $ 35,055 in fees. Steven \n \n\n \nSmith's post-appeal application seeks compensation for 306.75 hours at $ 125 per hour plus $ 607.76 in ex-\npenses for a total of $ 38,951.51. \n \n [**133] A.  \nTo determine the appropriate award, the Court must calculate the \"lodestar\" by multiplying the number the number \nof hours reasonably spent on the litigation by a reasonable hourly billing rate. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, \n434, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983). The fee applicant bears the burden of establishing that the hours \nexpended and the billing rate are reasonable.  Id. at 437, 103 S. Ct. at 1941. The Court should consider the factors set \nforth in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974), to evaluate the reasonable-\nness of the fee requests. See Walker v. United States Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 99 F.3d 761, 771 (5th Cir. 1996) \n(indicating that most of the Johnson factors are reflected in the lodestar amount and cannot be used to compute any up-\nward or downward adjustment of the lodestar); Watkins v. Fordice, 7 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir. 1993). The Johnson fac-\ntors are (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill required to perform \nthe legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance [**134]  of the \ncase; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the \ncircumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attor-\nneys; (10) the \"undesirability\" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and \n(12) awards in similar cases. Watkins, 7 F.3d at 457 n. 4. As discussed below, the defendants challenge the fees sought \nfor certain categories of work performed by counsel, as well as fees sought for duplicative, unnecessary, and excessive \nhours. Moreover, the Court made certain discretionary reductions in accordance with the Johnson factors. \n(1) Public and Media Relations \nThe defendants argue the plaintiffs are not entitled to reimbursement for  [*913]  time spent dealing with the media. \nAs the defendants correctly contend, the Fifth Circuit routinely denies such requests because they are not related to the \nlitigation of the case. See id. at 458; Associated Builders & Contractors of La., Inc. v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., 919 \nF.2d 374, 380 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirming the district court's decision to discount [**135]  award for time spent preparing \npress releases); see also Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 31 F.3d 169, 176 (4th Cir. 1994) (\"The legitimate \ngoals of litigation are almost always attained in the courtroom, not in the media.\"). The plaintiffs urge the Court to apply \nthe standard of recovery announced in Davis v. San Francisco, 976 F.2d 1536, 1545 (9th Cir. 1992), vacated in part on \nother grounds, 984 F.2d 345 (9th Cir. 1993), in which the Ninth Circuit held that fees incurred in public relations ef-\nforts are recoverable as long as such efforts \"contributed, directly and substantially, to the attainment of [the party's] \nlitigation goals.\" Watkins, 7 F.3d at 458 (noting the existence of the Davis rule but refusing either to accept it or to re-\nject it). Even applying the Davis standard to this case, the Court finds the plaintiffs have not shown that their efforts in \nthe media assisted in the litigation. 85 Instead, the public relations efforts in this case clearly relate to the divisive politi-\ncal--as opposed to legal--issue of affirmative action. Cf. Rum Creek, 31 F.3d at 176 (refusing to allow recovery for time \nspent dealing with the media because those [**136]  efforts were aimed at rehabilitating the plaintiff's public image). \nAccordingly, the Court deducts 5.50 trial hours and 68 appellate hours from its award for time spent by counsel in press \nand television interviews, as well as \"reviewing clips\" and other actions related to the media, because they were not rea-\nsonable and necessary for the prosecution of this case. 86 \n \n85   For instance, the plaintiffs argue they are entitled to such fees because they relied on and cited to press cov-\nerage in their motion for attorneys' fees to demonstrate the impact of the results the plaintiffs achieved in the \nFifth Circuit. The significance of the Fifth Circuit opinion did not need to be explained to this Court by the me-\ndia. \n86   The following is the breakdown, by firm and/or attorney, of time spent dealing with the media during the \ntrial phase of the case: Steven Smith (4.50 hours) and Terral Smith (1 hour). The following is the breakdown of \nthe appellate hours: GCD (48.25 hours), CIR (5.90 hours), Terral Smith (7.10 hours) and Steven Smith (6.75 \nhours). \n [**137]  (2) Proposed Interventions \nThe defendants argue the plaintiffs are not entitled to attorneys' fees for work related to the failed interventions of \nthe Thurgood Marshall Legal Society, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Mexi-\ncan-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. The Supreme Court has held that a prevailing party in a civil rights \nlawsuit cannot recover attorney's fees against an intervenor unless the intervention is \"frivolous, unreasonable or with-\nout foundation.\" Independent Fed. of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 761, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 2737, 105 L. Ed. 2d \n \n\n \n639 (1989). Several circuit courts have read Zipes to imply that plaintiffs should bear the risk of incurring intervention-\nrelated costs as a result of filing a lawsuit and have therefore extended Zipes's holding to a prevailing party's claims for \nintervention-related attorneys' fees against a losing defendant. See Rum Creek, 31 F.3d at 176-78 (\"Zipes instructs us \nnot to shift intervention-related expenses to the losing defendant.\"); Bigby v. City of Chicago, 927 F.2d 1426, 1428-29 \n(7th Cir. 1991) (\"Zipes indicates that a . . . defendant's fee liability [**138]  does not presumptively extend to cover fees \nincurred by plaintiffs in litigating third-party interests . . . .\"). In this case, the defendants did not participate in the pro-\nposed third-party interventions. 87 Because  [*914]  the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties as against the defendants on \nthe issue of intervention, they are not entitled to attorneys' fees for time spent litigating that issue, and the Court deducts \n184.90 trial hours and 338.47 appellate hours from its award of fees. 88 See Bigby, 927 F.2d at 1429 (holding that the \nplaintiff could not recover against a defendant that opposed intervention); Reeves v. Harrell, 791 F.2d 1481, 1483-84 \n(11th Cir. 1986) (holding that a plaintiff is not a prevailing party vis-a-vis a defendant who remains neutral on issues \nraised by an intervenor's complaint). \n \n87   The extent of the defendants' involvement in the intervention was as follows: On January 10, 1994, the de-\nfendants filed a one-sentence response to the proposed intervention in this Court, stating that they \"do not object \nto the intervention.\" On February 16, 1994, the defendants supported a motion filed by the intervenors in the \nFifth Circuit to expedite the appeal of the proposed intervention, stating \"Defendants believe that the interven-\ntion would be beneficial to an appropriate resolution of the litigation and believe it to be important to resolve the \nintervention issue expeditiously.\" On May 3, 1994, the defendants submitted a letter to the Fifth Circuit case \nmanager indicating that they did not oppose intervention and that \"the adverse parties in this appeal are the \nplaintiffs and the potential intervenors.\" See Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, Plaintiffs' Second Supplemental Memorandum \nin Further Support of Attorneys' Fees, October 11, 1994. On February 1, 1995, the defendants submitted another \nletter, this time to the Clerk of the Fifth Circuit, indicating that they did not intend to file a brief on the issue of \nintervention but reiterating that intervention \"would be beneficial to the final resolution\" of the case. See Exhibit \nK, Supplemental Appendix, Supplemental Memorandum of Plaintiffs Hopwood and Carvell in support of Attor-\nneys' Fees, October 1, 1996. These actions are insufficient to support the plaintiffs' contention that the defen-\ndants participated in the intervention. \n [**139]  \n88   The breakdown of trial hours: CIR (127.60 hours), Terral Smith (27.80 hours), WHS (18.75 hours), and \nSteven Smith (4.75 hours). The breakdown of appellate hours: CIR (302.57 hours), GDC (23 hours), and Terral \nSmith (12.90 hours). \n(3) Travel Time \nThe Court is of the opinion that time spent for travel should not be billed at the same hourly rate sought for active \nlegal work. Accordingly, the number of hours sought for travel time shall be reduced by fifty percent. See Watkins, 7 \nF.3d at 459 (affirming the district court's decision to completely disallow compensation for travel time); Sun Publ'g Co., \nInc. v. Mecklenburg News, Inc., 594 F. Supp. 1512, 1520 (E.D. Va. 1984) (reducing fees for travel time by eighty per-\ncent) (citing Younger v. Glamorgan Pipe & Foundry Co., 418 F. Supp. 743, 794 (W.D. Va. 1976), vacated and re-\nmanded on other grounds, 561 F.2d 563 (4th Cir. 1977)). The attorneys spent 155.50 trial hours and 36.05 appellate \nhours traveling, resulting in a discount of 77.75 trial hours and 18.03 appellate hours. 89 \n \n89   Travel time during the trial phase of the case is 153.25 hours for WHS, 15.75 hours for Steven Smith, 12 \nhours for Terral Smith, and 10 hours for CIR. There are 23.50 appellate hours for GDC and 12.55 appellate \nhours for CIR relating to travel. The numbers reflected here do not reflect the 50% reduction. \n [**140]  (4) Issues on Remand \nThe plaintiffs seek compensation for time spent preparing for the April 1997 trial. These time entries begin in mid-\nJuly 1996. Because the plaintiffs are not prevailing parties on the issues submitted by the Fifth Circuit on remand, they \nare not entitled to compensation for those failed efforts. The Court has identified 249.10 appellate hours spent in this \nendeavor. 90 \n \n90   Given the time sequence, these hours were listed in the plaintiffs' supplemental applications for attorneys' \nfees. These hours will therefore be subtracted from the \"appellate hours\" calculation. The breakdown for each at-\ntorney and/or firm is CIR (151.10 hours), Steven Smith (52.50 hours), and GDC (45.50 hours). \n(5) Duplicative Work Product and Billing Judgment \n \n\n \nIn addition to disallowing hours for certain kinds of work altogether, the Court must also consider whether the \nplaintiffs have adequately eliminated fees sought for duplicative, unproductive, and unnecessary work product. See \nHensley, 461 U.S. at [**141]  432-34, 103 S. Ct. at 1939; League of United Latin American Citizens v. Roscoe Indep. \nSch. Dist., 119 F.3d 1228, 1232-1233 (5th Cir. 1997) (\"LULAC\"). Moreover, the plaintiffs must exercise proper billing \njudgment when submitting fee applications. 91 See Walker, 99 F.3d at 769. The Court has very carefully  [*915]  perused \nthe attorney time entries for instances of redundant and wasteful hours. Given the sheer number of attorneys on the case \n(there were a total of sixteen attorneys involved--eleven at trial and twelve on appeal), there was significant duplication \nof effort for which the plaintiffs are not entitled to compensation. See Leroy v. City of Houston, 906 F.2d 1068, 1079 \n(5th Cir. 1990) (indicating that hours which result from the case being overstaffed are not hours reasonably expended \nand should be excluded from the lodestar calculation). Indeed, the lawyers in this case exceeded the plaintiffs by three-\nto-one even though the legal issues for each plaintiff were identical. Reductions for duplicative work are particularly \nappropriate in this case because only two attorneys, Terral Smith and Wallace, basically performed the trial presenta-\ntion, while the bulk of the [**142]  compensable appellate work was performed by GDC. See id. (\"There should be no \ncompensation for hours spent in duplicative activity or spent in the passive role of an observer while other attorneys \nperformed.\") In addition, although it is the plaintiffs' prerogative to obtain additional representation on appeal, doing so \nin this case required attorneys for GDC to familiarize themselves with the record and legal issues already known by trial \ncounsel. Finally, the amount of billing in unproductive attorney and client conferences at the trial and appellate levels is \nsomewhat astonishing, especially given the fact that each attorney present at the conference usually billed this time at \nhis full hourly rate. For example, it appears that more than half of the $ 38,500 in fees Harris submitted relate exclu-\nsively to co-counsel conferences. \n \n91   As evidence of billing judgment, the CIR claims it excluded from its fees application time spent on fund-\nraising, publicity, efforts to obtain additional counsel, expenses related to the turnover of attorneys assigned to \nthe case, compensation on behalf of a pro bono attorney who conducted a deposition, and fees related to the \nsubmission of the fee application. Except for the latter two items, these hours are not compensable. Therefore, \nthe Court does not consider the majority of these exclusions to be evidence of billing judgment. See Walker, 99 \nF.3d at 769-70. \n [**143]  The following is a non-exhaustive list of additional examples of redundant and unnecessary work product, \nas well as a lack of billing judgment: (1) thousands of dollars were spent repeatedly reading and reviewing the same \nSupreme Court cases on affirmative action; (2) compensation is sought for non-legal work such as reading a national \nbest seller on affirmative action, attending a panel discussion regarding the impact of the case, and reviewing co-counsel \nagreements; (3) an excessive amount of time was spent reading the defendants' pleadings and reviewing the documents \nin the case; 92 (4) virtually without exception, the attorneys listed hours spent learning the rules and procedures of the \nWestern District of Texas, the Fifth Circuit, and the Supreme Court; (5) several research projects involved basic civil \nrights doctrines which should already have been known by counsel, such as the standards of review in equal protection \ncases; (6) there was excessive research and drafting regarding the issue of Elliot's standing to sue; (7) the attorneys \nspent hours exhaustively reading, reviewing, and summarizing the deposition testimony of Professor Johanson and \nDean Yudof, such as one attorney [**144]  from CIR who spent 45 hours and $ 5,625 summarizing Johanson's deposi-\ntion; (8) there was excessive and inappropriate billing for routine clerical work, organization of files, and data entry \nwhich should have been accomplished by non-attorneys; (9) many time entries were inadequately documented under the \nrules and standards of the Fifth Circuit, particularly by attorneys for GDC, WHS, and Terral Smith, and some of CIR's \ntime entries did not even have a description of the work performed; 93 (11) Steven Smith had entries for time spent in \nrelation to three plaintiffs who withdrew from the lawsuit prior to trial; and (12) CIR seeks compensation for Dr. Mi-\nchael Greve, the founder of CIR and a non-lawyer, for consulting work performed  [*916]  during the trial phase of the \ncase. These charges are inappropriate, and they will not count against the defendants. \n \n92   CIR, for instance, submitted one entry labeled \"Read Defendant-Appellee's brief\" which the attorney claims \ntook 4.50 hours at a cost of $ 810. \n93   For instance, GDC's records are replete with such time entries as \"REVIEW AND REVISE BRIEF,\" \"LE-\nGAL RESEARCH RE 5TH CIRCUIT ISSUES,\" \"REVIEW OF MATERIALS,\" and \"TC W/MR ROSMAN,\" \nall of which are simply too vague and brief to inform the Court precisely what work was done. CIR had similar \nentries, such as \"Review Court Filings,\" as did WHS, which had the following imaginative and informative en-\ntries: \"Research\" and \"Trial Preparation.\" Furthermore, GDC, Terral Smith, CIR, and WHS did not separate the \nactivities for each day and instead lumped all work together under one heading. The Fifth Circuit has specifi-\ncally and repeatedly denounced such billing practices. See, e.g., Walker, 99 F.3d at 773 (calling identical billing \n \n\n \npractices \"woefully inadequate to support any fee application . . . [because] . . . no responsible client would ac-\ncept [such] records as capable of supporting a bill\"). \n [**145]  It was impractical for the Court to wade through literally hundreds of time entries in order to assess a spe-\ncific number of duplicative and excessive hours for each attorney. Moreover, \"the proper remedy when there is no evi-\ndence of billing judgment is to reduce the hours awarded by a percentage intended to substitute for the exercise of bill-\ning judgment.\" Walker, 99 F.3d at 770. Therefore, after careful consideration, the Court concludes that a twenty-five \npercent reduction in the amount of trial hours for Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and WHS is equitable and warranted. The \nfee application CIR submitted for trial work, however, is another story. The \"padding\" of attorney hours was quite ex-\ntensive, not only in the amount of time it took attorneys to complete a particular task but also in the types of tasks the \nattorneys performed. In the Court's opinion, a reduction of thirty-five percent would more accurately reflect the number \nof hours CIR reasonably spent on litigation. \nThe percentage reduction for work at the appellate level is a more complex question because, unlike the work per-\nformed for trial, the appeal was less of a collective endeavor. Compared to the work performed [**146]  by GDC, the \nwork performed by CIR, Steven Smith, Terral Smith, and Wallace was of considerably less value to the plaintiffs. 94 In \nfact, their work on appeal primarily consisted of performing duplicative research, assisting GDC with the trial record, \nfiling notices of appearance, reviewing court decisions, and revising the plaintiff's supplemental applications for attor-\nneys' fees. 95 Therefore, the Court concludes the following reductions in appellate hours are fair and appropriate: a \ntwenty-five percent reduction for GDC and a thirty-five percent reduction for CIR, Steven Smith, and Terral Smith. \n \n94   Wallace submitted only 18 post-trial hours which primarily consisted of reviewing motions and court or-\nders. These hours were of minimal or no value to the plaintiffs and will be reduced to 3.50 hours, the time he \nreasonably spent on the plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees. \n95   Other than the pleadings related to their requests for attorneys' fees, a brief requested by the Fifth Circuit re-\ngarding the Adarand decision, and two briefs related to the defendants' failed petition for writ of certiorari, all of \nCIR's post-trial filings relate to the intervention attempts. See Exhibit J, Supplemental Memorandum in Support \nof Motion for Attorneys' Fees, Supplemental Appendix (Part I), October 1, 1996. \n [**147]  (6) Degree of Success \nWithout question, the plaintiffs attained extraordinary success in the appellate courts. The plaintiffs accomplished \nthe principal goal of the lawsuit--to dismantle all forms of racial preferences in public higher education in Texas. Thus, \nthe Court does not question the success of the suit at the appellate levels through July 1, 1996, the date the Supreme \nCourt denied the defendants' petition for writ of certiorari. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, 103 S. Ct. at 1940 (\"The fee \nshould not be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention raised in the lawsuit.\"). How-\never, the plaintiffs did not succeed in one important aspect of their lawsuit--that they were denied admission because of \nthe law school's affirmative action program. The failure of the plaintiffs to obtain specific injunctive and monetary relief \nis not, in the Court's opinion, a trivial or insignificant matter. See Albright v. Good Shepard Hosp., 901 F.2d 438, 441 \n(5th Cir. 1990) (asserting that fees must be apportioned in light of the results obtained). Accordingly, the final fee award \nfor trial level work shall be reduced for each attorney and/or law firm by [**148]  fifteen percent. \n \nB.  \nSteven Smith, Terral Smith, and Wallace submitted current hourly rates of $ 125, $ 225, and $ 250, respectively. \nThe current hourly rates submitted by CIR are $ 280 for McDonald, the president of CIR; $ 260 for Rosman, CIR's gen-\neral counsel; $ 240 for Mulloy; $ 210 for Shea; $ 180 for Troy; and $ 150 for Bader. The current rates for paralegals \n(CIR used three at trial and six on appeal) is $ 70 per hour. GDC submitted the following hourly rates for its lawyers: $ \n450 for Olson,  [*917]  a former United States Assistant Attorney General, a partner, and head of GDC's appellate and \nconstitutional law practice group; 96 $ 275 for Cox, an attorney \"of counsel\" to firm; $ 275 for Hungar and Scott, two \nsenior associates with the firm; and $ 215 for Nelson, a junior associate with the firm. The current billing rates for the \nfour GDC paralegals who worked on the appeal range from $ 75 to $ 100 per hour. The Court does not have current \nhourly rates for Harris, Wheeler, Wilson, and the one WHS legal assistant who worked on the case. Their historic \nhourly rates are $ 200 for Harris and Wheeler, both partners at WHS; $ 85 per hour for Wilson, an associate; and $ 60 \nper hour [**149]  for the legal assistant. 97 \n \n \n\n \n96   The undersigned has been privileged to try lawsuits against some of the most competent trial lawyers in the \nUnited States from 1965 to 1991 before taking a seat on the federal bench. The undersigned has never seen a \nlawyer worth $ 450 per hour or $ 4,500 per day--only successful promoters. \n97   Terral Smith, Wallace, Wheeler, and Olson have over 20 years experience; McDonald, Rosman, and Cox \nhave over 10 years experience; and Steven Smith, Troy, Bader, Shea, Hungar, Scott, and Nelson have less than \n10 years experience. The Court was provided with no information regarding the years of experience of Harris, \nMulloy, or Wilson. \n(1) Relevant Community \nThe reasonable hourly billing rate is based on the prevailing market rates in the relevant community--in this in-\nstance, Austin, Texas, where the case was tried. See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1547, 79 L. \nEd. 2d 891 (1984). GDC, CIR, WHS, and Wallace argue, however, that they are entitled to the prevailing [**150]  mar-\nket rate for comparable services performed in Washington, D.C. (where GDC and CIR are located) because local coun-\nsel was unavailable to take the case. See National Wildlife Fed'n v. Hanson, 859 F.2d 313, 317-18 (4th Cir. 1988); \nChrapliwy v. Uniroyal, Inc., 670 F.2d 760, 768 (7th Cir. 1982) (both holding that outside counsel may be retained when \nlocal counsel is unavailable and the plaintiffs have acted reasonably in choosing outside counsel). Several attorneys \nsubmitted affidavits with the applications for attorneys' fees indicating that they attempted the locate pro bono assis-\ntance from members of the private bar in Texas but, other than Terral Smith, none could be obtained. See, e.g., Affidavit \nof Michael McDonald, August 29, 1994. The plaintiffs' attorneys also assert the complexity of the case and the superior \nresources of the defendants required the involvement of outside counsel. The Court rejects those arguments and the af-\nfidavits. From the inception of this case, there has been a shortage of clients, not lawyers. Steven Smith spent months \nsoliciting clients through the mail, and only seven individuals responded. See D-650 (sample solicitation letter). Once \n[**151]  Smith was retained, he sought the assistance of CIR because he apparently lacked both the expertise and the \nfunds to try the lawsuit. See id. The Court will not assess against the defendants the higher rates of Washington, D.C. \nbecause local counsel got in over his head. In addition, Terral Smith provided competent and skilled legal representation \nin the trial court, and the Court has no doubt he was capable of the same degree of competence regarding the appeal had \nit been determined he should have remained the plaintiffs' primary lawyer. \n(2) Prevailing Market Rate \nWhen the attorney's customary rate falls within the range of hourly fees in the prevailing market for attorneys of \nsimilar skill and experience, the Court should consider that rate in setting a reasonable hourly rate; if the Court deviates \nfrom the customary rate, the Court must specifically articulate its reasons for doing so. See LULAC, 119 F.3d at 1234; \nWatkins, 7 F.3d at 459. Although the hourly fee awarded must be supported by the record and cannot merely reflect the \nexperiences of the Court, see LULAC, 119 F.3d at 1234, the Court may consider evidence outside the record, such as the \nhourly rate [**152]  given in similar cases in the Western District of Texas, see Walker, 99 F.3d at 770. Terral Smith \nwas the only attorney who timely presented evidence regarding the prevailing market rates for comparable services per-\nformed  [*918]  in Austin, Texas. 98 He indicates that the prevailing market rate for federal court practice in the Western \nDistrict of Texas is between $ 220 to $ 300 per hour (these rates were charged in a case involving the Endangered Spe-\ncies Act). For federal civil rights litigation, Terral Smith indicates that a rate of $ 225 per hour is reasonable for an at-\ntorney of his skills and abilities. See Affidavit in Support of Motion for Attorney's Fees, Plaintiffs' Motion for Attor-\nneys' Fees, August 29, 1994. In the Court's experience, most recent fee awards in civil rights cases in the Western Dis-\ntrict of Texas generally have billing rates ranging from $ 150 to $ 200 per hour. 99 The record in this case does not sup-\nport a billing rate higher than $ 225 per hour. See LULAC, 119 F.3d at 1234. \n \n98   Steven Smith untimely submitted evidence that the prevailing market rates in Austin range from $ 123 to $ \n150 per hour for an attorney of his skill and experience. The remaining attorneys only submitted evidence of the \nprevailing market rate in Washington, D.C. and Virginia. WHS's evidence establishes a prevailing market rate \nfor civil rights litigation at $ 200 per hour. CIR submitted evidence that the prevailing market rates range from $ \n90 to $ 190 per hour for associates and from $ 195 to $ 350 per hour for partners. GDC submitted evidence that \nhourly rates range from $ 90 to $ 230 for associates and $ 195 to $ 525 for partners. The rates submitted by CIR \nand GDC only reflect the general hourly rates charged to clients in Washington, D.C. and do not purport to re-\nflect the market rate for work performed in federal civil rights litigation. \n [**153]  \n99   The Court has never granted an application for attorney's fees with a billing rate higher than $ 200 per hour \nwithout the agreement of the parties so stipulating. \n \n\n \n(3) Assessing the Rates \nThe hourly rate of $ 125 requested by Steven Smith appears reasonable given both his limited trial and appellate \nexperience and his role in the case. He was primarily involved in discovery, including document review, responding to \nthe defendants' discovery requests, and participating in discovery disputes. He also performed legal research related to \ntangential issues in the case, such as Hopwood's residency status. As discussed above, he performed little substantive \nwork on the appeal. Furthermore, this rate is higher than Smith's normal billing rate and is the highest rate Smith has \never received in any federal civil rights litigation he has undertaken. Terral Smith's hourly rate of $ 225 is also reason-\nable. Given his competence and years of experience, the rate is in line with prevailing market rates for comparable \nwork. \nThe rates requested by Wallace, CIR, and GDC, however, are excessive. Wallace's [**154]  rate of $ 250 runs afoul \nof the current prevailing market rates in Austin. Wallace's rate for trial level work is therefore reduced to $ 225, a rate \nthat reflects his role in the trial and his years of experience. As for the time Wallace spent on appeal, the Court con-\ncludes that his rate should be reduced to $ 200 per hour because all of Wallace's compensable post-trial time relates to \nhis application for attorney's fees. As the Fifth Circuit has indicated, an attorney should not command his or her normal \nbilling rate for such work. See Leroy, 906 F.2d at 1079 (\"Certainly, the base rate for time spent on computing and en-\nforcing attorneys' fees should be less than that allowed for professional services rendered primarily on the merits.\"). As \nfor Harris and Wheeler, the Court assesses an hourly rate of $ 200. According to their billing records, their main func-\ntion was to consult with co-counsel about the case; they performed very little independent work and did not actively \nparticipate at trial. The Court concludes an hourly rate $ 100 for Wilson for the legal research and document review he \nperformed is fair and reasonable. 100 \n \n100   Three other WHS associates (all of whom have rates lower than $ 100 per hour) performed a total of one \nhour of work on the case. For the sake of simplicity, the Court will assign this hour of work to Wilson in calcu-\nlating the lodestar. \n [**155]  With respect to CIR, its normal billing rates are excessive given its function at trial and on appeal. Con-\nsidering the evidence of prevailing market rates in the record, as well as the Court's experience in these kinds of cases, a \nrate higher than $ 200 per hour for any attorney who did not actively participate at the trial (in terms of presenting wit-\nness or opening and closing statements) or on appeal (in terms of oral argument) would be unreasonable. Accordingly, \nan hourly rate of $ 200  [*919]  for McDonald and Rosman, the two most experienced CIR lawyers, is appropriate. A \nrate of $ 175 per hour is appropriate for Mulloy, Shea, and Troy, the mid-level lawyers, and a rate of $ 150 per hour is \nreasonable for Bader, the least experienced lawyer at CIR. \nGDC's billing rates are extreme even with respect to the evidence GDC itself offered. For instance, GDC's evidence \nestablishes that no firm in Washington, D.C. charges an hourly rate for associate work over $ 230, and yet GDC re-\nquests that such work be compensated at a rate of $ 275 per hour. See Leroy, 906 F.2d at 1079 (\"The hourly rates are to \nbe adequate to attract competent counsel, . . . not the rates which lions at the bar may command.\")  [**156]  (internal \nquotations omitted). Indeed, such exorbitant rates are particularly inappropriate when \"the experience and special skill \nof the attorney does not result in the expenditure of fewer hours than counsel would normally be expected to spend.\" Id. \nThe Court assesses a rate of $ 225 per hour for Olson and Cox, the two most experienced and distinguished lawyers \nfrom GDC and the two attorneys who controlled the appeal. The Court finds an hourly rate of $ 175 for Hungar and \nScott and an hourly rate of $ 150 for Nelson is appropriate in light of their contribution to the case (primarily legal re-\nsearch and assisting with the trial record and the briefs) and their levels of experience. \nFinally, rather than assign a specific rate for each paralegal and law clerk from WHS, CIR and GDC who worked \non the case, the Court has aggregated the hours for each firm. The Court concludes a reasonable rate for work per-\nformed by paralegals and law clerks from GDC is $ 80 per hour; for WHS and CIR paralegals, a reasonable rate is $ 70 \nper hour. \n(4) Compensation for Delay in Payment \nIn assessing a reasonable rate, the Court considered the attorneys' current hourly rates (as opposed to the historic \n[**157]  rates submitted with the 1994 fee applications) in order to compensate for the delay in payment. See Missouri \nv. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 282-84, 109 S. Ct. 2463, 2468-69, 105 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1989) (\"An appropriate adjustment for \ndelay in payment--whether by the application of current rather than historic hourly rates or otherwise--is within the con-\ntemplation of [ß 1988].\"); In re Washington Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., 19 F.3d 1291, 1305 (9th Cir. 1994) \n(\"Full compensation requires charging current rates for all work done during the litigation, or by using historical rates \n \n\n \nenhanced by an interest factor.\"). Where appropriate (as with Wallace, Shea, Troy, Wilson, and paralegal work), the \nCourt increased the original hourly rate to compensate for the delay in payment. In this case, however, the Court found \nthat many of the requested billing rates were excessive. In those instances, the Court assessed hourly rates which, al-\nthough lower than the rates requested, are intended to reflect current hourly rates in the prevailing market. \n \nC.  \n(1) Trial Hours \nTable I represents the total hours for which the plaintiffs' are entitled to compensation for hours spent at [**158]  \nthe trial level, with the appropriate deductions identified in Part V(A) for time spent on public and media relations, the \nproposed interventions, travel, duplicative work product, and lack of billing judgment. Table II multiplies the hours al-\nlowed by the billing rate previously determined by the Court in Part V(B) and takes into account the fifteen percent de-\nduction for the plaintiffs' lack of success in attaining specific injunctive and monetary relief. \nTABLE I: TRIAL HOURS \n  Hours Sought  Deductions  Subtotal  % Reduction  Total Hours \nS.

Aggregating the individual amounts of Olson, Cox, Hungar, \nScott, Nelson, and the GDC Clerks results in a total lodestar amount for GDC of $ 136,217.00. \n \nD.  \nThe plaintiffs do not request a multiplier of the lodestar, see Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorneys' Fees, August 29, \n1994, and the Court does not believe adjustment of the lodestar is warranted. This case involved extensive discovery \nand has spanned over five years. The legal issues, however, were neither novel [**161]  nor extraordinarily difficult, as \nthere have been many significant challenges to affirmative action since Bakke, both in and out of the context of higher \neducation. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of this case was the comprehensive marshaling and analysis of equal protec-\ntion case law in the context of affirmative action. The Court is confident, however, that the difficulties of the case are \naccurately reflected in the lodestar amount. \nThe Court realizes that, at first blush, the reductions may seem excessive. Frankly, that impression is due to the \nsloppy state of most of the fee applications and the considerable overstaffing of this case, both of which necessitated \nsignificant reductions by the Court. In fact, the fee applications submitted by GDC, WHS, and Terral Smith were so \nvague and uninformative the Court seriously considered not awarding attorneys' fees to those individuals at all. In any \nevent, the Court conducted its own calculations regarding the number of hours it should have taken to prepare, try, and \nappeal this case. Based on an evaluation of the work performed by counsel, the undersigned's thirty years of trial expe-\nrience, and the Johnson factors, the Court [**162]  concludes that the lodestar is a fair estimate of an appropriate fee \naward. A single law firm spending an average of fifty hours per week for an entire year could have easily prepared the \n \n\n \ncase and tried it. Had the same law firm handled the appeal, the case could have been prepared and argued to the Fifth \nCircuit and the Supreme Court in less than six hundred hours (an average of forty hours per week for fifteen weeks). \nAssuming an average rate of $ 200 per hour at trial and $ 225 per hour on appeal, the case should have cost around $ \n650,000. The lodestar exceeds that amount by over $ 50,000. \n \nE.  \nThe defendants object to the expenses sought in this case associated with the plaintiffs' opposition to the proposed \ninterventions  [*922]  and the costs relating to the involvement of outside counsel to try the case. 101 These expenses \ninclude travel expenses, lodging, phone calls, mailing expenses, and Fifth Circuit fees relating to the appeal of the mo-\ntions to intervene. The Court agrees these charges are inappropriate under ß 1988 and makes a resulting deduction of $ \n19,475.09 in CIR's first fee application. As for the post-appeal applications, the Court was able to identify $ 246.25 \n[**163]  spent by GDC in relation to NEXIS searches; presumably, these expenses relate to GDC's efforts with the me-\ndia and therefore are not recoverable. CIR's post-appeal records specifically label $ 955.70 spent on \"public relations\" \nwhich the Court will likewise exclude. However, given the general nature of the research, printing, mailing, and travel-\ning expenses submitted by CIR, it was impossible for the Court to assess a specific dollar amount to be excluded from \nCIR's post-appeal fee application. Therefore, the Court reduces all such expenses by fifty-five percent as a reasonable \napproximation of the costs related to opposing the intervention attempts. The Court also deducts $ 18.72 from Steven \nSmith's application for charges incurred after July 1996, which charges presumably relate to the issues on remand. \n \n101   The defendants also object to over $ 7,000 for the deposition costs and travel expenses related to the plain-\ntiffs' expert witness at trial. Under ß 1988(c), it is within the Court's discretion to include such expenses as pan \nof a reasonable attorney's fee for cases brought pursuant to ß 1981. 42 U.S.C. ß 1988(c). The Court declines to \ndeduct this expense. \n [**164]  Tables V and VI represent the amount of expenses requested by the plaintiffs in the trial and appellate \nlevels of this case, respectively, with the appropriate deductions made in accordance with the paragraph above. The in-\nterest is calculated using the prime rate to compensate the plaintiffs for the delay in payment. See Alberti v. Klevenha-\ngen, 896 F.2d 927, 938 (5th Cir.) (\"The appropriate rate of interest to be used in compensating a delay in payment ad-\njustment is the cost of borrowing money, the prime rate.\"), vacated in part on other grounds, 903 F.2d 352 (5th Cir. \n1990). The interest in Table V is calculated from August 29, 1994, the date the plaintiffs filed their initial applications \nfor attorneys' fees, until the date of this order. The interest in Table VI is calculated from October 1, 1996, the date the \nplaintiffs filed their supplemental applications for attorneys fees, until the date of this order. 102 \n \n102   The Court derived the prime rate from a booklet entitled \"Selected Interest Rates\" published by the Board \nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System. For the sake of simplicity, the Court applied the average prime rate \nper annum (simple) for the relevant time period rather than applying a different prime rate for each quarter. \n [**165]   \nTABLE V: TRIAL EXPENSES AND INTEREST \n  Expenses Sought  Deductions  Subtotal  Interest Rate  Total \nS.

In the end, the determination of who deserves an offer of admission and who does not is left in the less-\nthan-capable hands of people outside the academic arena--judges. Moreover, the specter of large compensatory damage \nawards could threaten to compromise the integrity of the admissions process itself. Public universities deserve the free-\ndom to make [**167]  the necessarily difficult choices regarding admission, and part of that endeavor entails not only \nconsideration of the individual applicant but also the needs of higher education in general and the educational institution \nand class in particular.

Burgdorf, Vinson & Elkins, Austin, TX, for\ndefendants.\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\nSPARKS, District Judge.\nThe plaintiffs, Cheryl J. Hopwood, a white female, and Douglas W. Carvell, Kenneth R. Elliott, and David A.\n[1]\nRogers, three white males, have brought suit against the defendants  alleging violations of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, 42 U.S.C.A. § 1981 (West Supp. 1994), 42 U.S.C.A. § 1983 (West 1981), and Title VI of the Civil\n[2]\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d (West 1981).  All of these provisions prohibit discrimination because of\nrace. For the alleged violations, the plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and\npunitive damages. The plaintiffs contend the defendants discriminated against them by favoring less qualified\nblack and Mexican American applicants for admission to the University of Texas School of Law through the use of\na quota system. This cause was tried before the Court, without a jury, on May 16th through May 20th and May\n23rd through May 25th, 1994.\nThe cause focuses on one of the most divisive issues faced by society, affirmative action, and highlights the\ntension that exists when the individual rights of nonminorities come into conflict with programs designed to aid\nminorities. The plaintiffs have contended that any preferential treatment to a group based on race violates the\nFourteenth Amendment and, therefore, is unconstitutional. However, such a simplistic application of the\nFourteenth Amendment would ignore the long history of pervasive racial discrimination in our society that the\nFourteenth Amendment was adopted to remedy and the complexities of achieving the societal goal of\novercoming the past effects of that discrimination. Further, the Supreme Court, which is continually faced with\ntrying to reconcile the meaning of words written over a century ago with the realities of the latter twentieth\n\ncentury, has declined to succumb to an original intent or strict constructionist argument. Therefore, the Court will\n554 decline the plaintiffs' *554 invitation to ignore the law established by the highest court of this land and to declare\naffirmative action based on racial preferences as unconstitutional per se. The issue before the Court is whether\nthe affirmative action program employed in 1992 by the law school in its admissions procedure met the legal\nstandard required for such programs to pass constitutional muster. The Court, having carefully considered the\nevidence presented at trial, the arguments of counsel, and the briefing provided by the parties, finds that it did\nnot.\nI. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nThe reasoning behind affirmative action is simple 00 because society has a long history of discriminating against\n97\nminorities, it is not realistic to assume that the removal of barriers can suddenly make minority individuals equal\nand able to avail themselves of all opportunities. Therefore, an evaluation of the purpose and necessity of\naffirmative action in Texas' system of higher education requires an understanding of past discrimination against\nblacks and Mexican Americans, the minorities receiving preferences in this cause, and the types of barriers these\nminorities have encountered in the educational system.\nA. Discrimination in Primary and Secondary Education\nThe history of official discrimination in primary and secondary education in Texas is well documented in history\nbooks, case law, and the record of this trial. The Court, therefore, will address it only in summary fashion.\nEven after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the State of Texas adopted a policy of\nofficial resistance to integration of its public schools. This policy of resistance resulted in numerous lawsuits and\ncourt-imposed desegregation plans throughout the past twenty years. Wright, vol. 19 at 38-44; Romo, vol. 17 at\n45-51. Many of the school districts found to be operating dual systems of education were also found to practice\nofficial discrimination against black and Mexican American students. Wright, vol. 19 at 40-43; Romo, vol. 17 at\n45-51; Rodriguez, vol. 17 at 8-9.\nThe problem of segregated schools is not a relic of the past. Despite the fact that the public school population is\napproximately half white and half minority, minority students in Texas attend primarily majority minority schools\nwhile white students attend primarily white schools. Glenn, vol. 23 at 46-49. Further, as of May 1994,\ndesegregation lawsuits remain pending against over forty Texas school districts. D-457; see also D-370, 373,\n419; Wright, vol. 19 at 38-40; Romo, vol. 17 at 45-46.\nThe lack of educational opportunity for minorities has been compounded by the lower socioeconomic status of\nminorities in Texas. Statistics continue to indicate significant disparities between minority and nonminority\nstudents in skills and academic knowledge attained in the public schools. Although the generally lower\nsocioeconomic status of black and Mexican American families is partially accountable for some of the disparities,\nthe gap is exacerbated by historically inferior educational preparation of minorities. Glenn, vol. 23 at 30-36.\nFurther, at each educational level, there is a marked decline in the level of attainment by minorities, as reflected\nin comparison of drop-out rates between minorities and nonminorities and the percentages of the respective\n[3]\ngroups that graduate from high school and college.\nB. Discrimination in Higher Education\nAs with primary and secondary education, Texas' system of higher education has a history of state-sanctioned\ndiscrimination. Discrimination against blacks in the state system of higher education is well documented in history\nbooks, case law, and the State's legislative history. The State of Texas, by constitution and statute, previously\nrequired the maintenance of \"separate schools ... for the white and colored children.\" See Tex. Const. art. VII, § 7\n555 (1925, repealed 1969). *555 This policy resulted in the establishment of segregated schools for blacks that were\n[4]\ninferior to the white schools. Further, opportunities available to blacks to attend college were extremely limited.\n\nIn 1946, when Heman Sweatt, a black man, sought admission to the law school and was refused admission, a\nTexas court, while holding that Article VII, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution precluded his admission, ordered\nthe state to provide a law school for blacks. See Sweatt v. Painter, 210 S.W.2d 442 (Tex.Civ.App. 00 Austin 1948).\n97\nThe State hastily created a makeshift law school that had no permanent staff, no library staff, no facilities, and\nwas not accredited. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 632, 70 S.Ct. 848, 849-50, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950). In 1950, a\nunanimous United States Supreme Court ruled that the State of Texas' provisions regarding the legal education\nof white and minority students violated the Fourteenth Amendment and ordered that Sweatt be admitted to the\npreviously all-white University of Texas School of Law. Sweatt, 339 U.S. at 636, 70 S.Ct. at 851. Sweatt left the\nlaw school in 1951 without graduating after being subjected to racial slurs from students and professors, cross\nburnings, and tire slashings. Wright, vol. 19 at 24-25.\nThe Sweatt case is the most flagrant incident of state-sanctioned discrimination occurring against blacks at the\nUniversity of Texas. However, the record reflects that during the 1950s, and into the 1960s, the University of\nTexas continued to implement discriminatory policies against both black and Mexican American students.\nMexican American students were segregated in on-campus housing and assigned to a dormitory known as the\n\"barracks,\" as well as excluded from membership in most university-sponsored organizations. Romo, vol. 17 at\n43. Additionally, until the mid 1960s, the Board of Regents policy prohibited blacks from living in or visiting white\ndormitories. Wright, vol. 19 at 26-28; D-482.\nBeginning in the mid 1970s, discrimination in Texas' system of higher education came under attack through a\ncourt-ordered investigation by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Office for Civil Rights\n(OCR). The investigation of Texas' system resulted from a lawsuit initiated in 1970 to require HEW to take action\n556 to enforce the provisions of Title VI.[5] The courtordered *556 investigation of ten states, which did not include\nTexas, began in 1973. In 1977, the court extended the order to an additional six states, which included Texas. \nAshworth, vol. 12 at 8; D-296.\nBetween 1978 and 1980, the OCR conducted an investigation of Texas' public higher education system. The\ninvestigation culminated in a finding that Texas had \"failed to eliminate vestiges of its former de jure racially dual\nsystem of public higher education, a system which segregated blacks and whites.\" D-297. Additionally, the OCR\nfound that Hispanics were significantly underrepresented in state institutions and indicated it would continue its\ninvestigation of discrimination against Hispanics. Id.\nDuring the early 1980s, the OCR and Texas officials engaged in considerable negotiations regarding efforts to\nbring Texas into compliance with Title VI. Texas, in an effort to achieve a state-wide desegregation plan\nacceptable to the OCR, attempted to address OCR concerns through submission of the Texas Equal Education\nOpportunity Plan for Higher Education (Texas Plan), which included a commitment to the goal of equal\neducational opportunity and student body desegregation for both black and Hispanic students. D-237. In 1982,\nAssistant Secretary of Education Clarence Thomas informed Governor Clements that the Texas Plan was\ndeficient because the numeric goals of black and Hispanic enrollment in graduate and professional programs\nwere insufficient to meet Texas' commitment to enroll those minority students in proportion to the representation\namong graduates of the state's undergraduate institutions. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 16-17; D-284. Texas revised its\nplan and resubmitted it to the OCR; the OCR found the modified plan to be deficient because it did not set targets\nfor increasing minority enrollment for each institution, instead of on a statewide basis, and it did not project\nachievement dates for the targeted goals. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 19-20; D-219.\nIn 1983, the District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order in the ongoing Title VI-enforcement suit, in\nwhich the court found that \"Texas has still not committed itself to the elements of a desegregation plan which in\ndefendants' judgment complies with Title VI.\" D-446. The court ordered the DOE to begin enforcement\nproceedings against Texas unless Texas submitted a plan in full conformity with Title VI within forty-five days. \nAshworth, vol. 12 at 22-23; D-446. In response to the order, the OCR submitted thirty-seven suggested measures\nfor increasing black and Hispanic student enrollment in professional and graduate programs at traditionally white\ninstitutions. Among the suggestions were that each graduate and professional school should re-evaluate its\nadmissions criteria and that \"admissions officers will consider each candidate's entire record and will admit black\n\nand Hispanic students who demonstrate potential for success but who do not necessarily meet all the traditional\nadmission requirements.\" D-220.\nIn June 1983, the Texas Plan, as amended to account for the deficiencies identified by the OCR, was accepted\n[6]\nby OCR as being in compliance with Title VI.  However, acceptance was contingent on adequate funding and\ncompletion of key activities within a specified time. D-314. Further, the Texas Plan was subject to monitoring for\ncompliance until 1988. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 23, 25-26.\nIn November 1987, OCR contacted the state regarding the expiration of the plan in 1988 and indicated OCR\nwould perform a final evaluation to determine if further action would be necessary to bring Texas into compliance\nwith Title VI. OCR further instructed state officials that, pending the evaluation, Texas should continue to operate\nunder the plan. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 32-34; D-323.\n557 *557 Because Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board officials determined Texas had not met the goals and\nobjectives of the plan, the board voluntarily developed a successor plan (Plan II) to avoid a mandate from the\nfederal government to negotiate another plan. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 34-35; vol. 13 at 45-46. Plan II did not contain\nany specific numeric enrollment goals but retained Texas' commitment to increasing black and Hispanic student\nenrollment. D-326 at 9.\n[7]\nTo date, OCR has not completed its evaluation to determine if Texas is in compliance with Title VI.  However, in\nJanuary 1994, the DOE notified Governor Richards that OCR was continuing to oversee Texas' efforts to\neliminate all vestiges of de jure segregation and that it would be reviewing the Texas system in light of United\nStates v. Fordice, ___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992). Ashworth, vol. 12 at 35-38; D-293.\nAgainst this historical backdrop, the law school's commitment to affirmative action in the admissions process\nevolved.\nII. THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS\nA. Evolution of the Admissions Process and Affirmative Action\nThe law school's admissions procedure was not always a complicated process. In the early 1960s, all applicants\n[8]\nwho had taken the LSAT and had at least a 2.0 or 2.2 grade point average on a 4.0 scale were accepted.  In\nabout 1965, the number of applicants began to significantly exceed the law school's capacity, and, as a result,\nthe law school established additional criteria to aid in the selection process. Smith depo. at 7-8.\n[9]\nUnder the more selective system, a baseline was established each year based on the Texas Index (TI).  The\nlaw school automatically admitted applicants whose TI exceeded the baseline, and the admissions committee\nreviewed applicants whose TI was below the baseline. This procedure was used until the late 1960s when an\ninundation of applications meeting the baseline criterion created a class of more students than could be\nadequately accommodated and precluded review of those who did not qualify for automatic admission. That\nparticular year, the first-year class of law students consisted of almost 700 students. Johanson, vol. 3 at 14.\nAs a result, the law school modified the admissions process and changed the automatic admission baseline to a\npresumptive admission score. Additionally, the admissions committee began to use a presumptive denial\nbaseline, and applicants whose TI fell below that baseline were presumptively denied admission. Also during the\nlate 1960s, the law school began implementing affirmative action by attempting to recruit minority individuals who\n[10]\nhad performed well in the CLEO program.  The only race or ethnicbased scholarships available during this\ntime, however, were limited to \"whites only.\" Smith depo. at 12.\nA perception began to develop that the CLEO program had shifted its focus from students who were just below\nthe level where law schools would seriously consider them for admission to students who were significantly below\n558 that level. Smith depo. at 14-16. Therefore, those responsible for admissions *558 at the law school felt that the\nCLEO program could not successfully prepare the participants in one summer to be competitive students in a\n\nregular law school class. Id. at 16. Additionally, minorities represented only a small percentage of the entire pool\nof applicants to the law school, and law schools around the country competed for the top minority applicants. Id.\nat 18. In 1971, after the law school terminated its participation in the CLEO program, the law school admitted no\nblack students. Wright, vol. 19 at 32.\nIn the early 1970s, because of the university's concern over the few minority students enrolled in the law school,\n[11]\na separate admissions committee, informally called the \"Treece committee,\"  was formed to consider\n[12]\napplications from minority students and disadvantaged nonminority students.  The purpose of the committee\nwas to ensure that the applicants the committee reviewed received \"fuller consideration\" than they would have in\nthe regular admissions process. Smith depo. at 16. The applicants were evaluated separately from the applicants\nbefore the regular admissions committee, and the sole criterion for applicants before the Treece Committee was\n[13]\nwhether the applicant had a reasonable prospect of passing the first year.  The Treece committee had no set\ngoals for the number of admissions to be made through the committee, and the number of applicants it admitted\n[14]\nhad little impact on the regular admissions.  In 1977, the Treece committee considered 500 applicants,\nincluding approximately 100 nonminority applicants. Of these applicants, the Treece committee admitted sixty-\neight minority students and three nonminority students. \"Thus, while the special subcommittee did consider and\ngrant admission to some white applicants, the predominant objective of the special subcommittee was to\nincrease minority enrollment at the Law School.\" P-1 (Smith memo to Rogers, Oct. 18, 1978, at 1).\nThe applications before the regular admissions committee were subjected to a different process. Because of the\nvolume of applications, the admissions committee could not give individual consideration to each application.\nTherefore, the law school implemented a three-category system to narrow the pool of applications requiring\ncommittee consideration. The first category of applicants, those with TIs above a certain number, were granted\n\"administrative admission\"; that is, administrative personnel automatically sent offers of admission to these\napplicants based on the applicants' TIs. A \"presumptive denial\" category was at the other end of the scale, in\nwhich administrative personnel screened the applications based on specified criteria. If the administrative person\ndetermined the file warranted further consideration, the file was sent to the regular admissions committee. The\nadmissions committee reviewed the individual applications in the middle category or \"discretionary zone,\" which\nincluded those referred to the committee from the presumptive denial category.\nThe law school used this admissions procedure until 1978 when, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in \nBakke, the law school reassessed its minority admissions procedure. The law school determined that, although\nits procedure differed from that at issue in Bakke, the use of the separate committees to evaluate applicants was\n559 defective.[15] Therefore, then Dean Smith directed *559 the admissions committee to operate as one unit rather\nthan as two subcommittees and instructed the committee to establish the administrative admission and\npresumptive denial lines at levels that would increase the number of applicants given individual consideration.\nP-1.\nAfter 1978, Johanson set the lines to allow for a reasonable number of minority candidates to be included with\nnonminorities in the discretionary zone. Johanson, vol. 3 at 21. The discretionary zone was then divided into five\n[16]\nor six \"bands.\"  The law school offered admission to a set percentage of applicants from each band. The\npercentage decreased from the first or top band to the last, a reflection of the diminishing credentials of the\nbands. The minority applicants were primarily clustered in the lower bands with few in the upper bands. Wellborn,\nvol. 24 at 45.\nWithin each band, minority and nonminority files were blended into groups of thirty. Each pile was reviewed by\nthree committee members, each of whom was allocated a certain fixed number of votes determined by the yield\ndesired from a particular band. Therefore, each member of the committee ultimately had total discretion to decide\nwhether and what extent to implement affirmative action for each pile of files that person reviewed. Wellborn, vol.\n24 at 9. Professor Wellborn testified he and other faculty members perceived two problems with this system: 1)\npotential unfairness to nonminority candidates who could be affected by affirmative action solely as a result of the\npile in which they were included and 2) the application of personal affirmative action efforts, requiring no\njustification to the committee as a whole, rather than a system based on a set policy. As a result, in 1980, the law\nschool abandoned the banding admissions procedure and formed the minority subcommittee.\n\nThe minority subcommittee was a part of the full committee that reviewed and voted on nonminority files. All\n[17]\nminority files below the presumptive admission line were studied by the minority subcommittee.  The\nsubcommittee would then bring its recommendations to the full committee. At some point during the middle of the\nadmissions process, the subcommittee would present a report to the full committee that summarized the features\nof the minority files being recommended for admission. The actual files were also available at the meeting so the\nfull committee could make its own determinations about the recommended minority applicants in comparison to\nthe nonminority applications pending at the time. At this point in the process, the members of the full committee\nwere involved in reading piles of nonminority files and were cognizant of the qualifications of the nonminorities.\nAlthough this method often resulted in heated discussion and disagreement among committee members over\nwhether to admit a particular candidate, the process also provided open discussion rather than the silent voting,\nwhich could have reflected personal agendas, that occurred with the banding procedure. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 15.\nIn the early 1980s, during these meetings, the committee members spent considerable time debating whether\nindividual minority candidates met minimum admissions standards and, thus, could do passing work in law\nschool. As a result, the full committee often examined specific minority files. The ultimate effect was that the\nentire committee voted on each minority applicant that the subcommittee brought before the full committee. \n560 Goode, vol. 9 at 6. However, as the *560 pool of minority candidates improved, the focus of the meetings shifted\nto choosing among minority candidates that the committee knew, based on their TIs, could succeed in law\nschool. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 33. Therefore, less full committee review of each individual file became necessary.\n[18]\nUltimately, the admissions committee determined that the process was inefficient and not the most effective way\nof processing minority applicants. Johanson, vol. 5 at 27. In April 1991, \"[a]fter considerable debate, the\n[admissions] committee, over some strong opposition, directed the chair [Johanson] to form a subcommittee\n(including Deans Aleman and Hamilton and the two minority students) which was to review the minority files and\n[19]\nrecommend sufficient candidates for admission to achieve a class that was 5% Black and 10% MA.\"\nTherefore, by 1992, the full admissions committee no longer selected individual applicants for admission. \nWellborn, vol. 24 at 53. Instead, the minority subcommittee compiled a list and presented it to the full committee,\nwhich made a judgment of how many offers to give to minority applicants. The minority subcommittee was then\ndelegated the task of deciding which individual minority applicants were to receive offers of admission. Thus, by\n1992, the admissions process, although involving some interaction and exchange of information between the full\ncommittee and minority subcommittee, was markedly similar to the pre-Bakke procedure of two separate\ncommittees. This 1992 procedure is the crux of this lawsuit.\nB. 1992 Admissions Process\nIn 1992, the admissions committee was comprised of nine professors, two assistant deans, and four students. \nJohanson, vol. 6 at 26. The minority subcommittee was comprised of Johanson, Aleman, and Hamilton, all of\n[20]\nwhom were also members of the full committee.  Aleman, however, did not participate in reviewing\nnonminority applications. Johanson, vol. 6 at 25-26.\nIn 1992 when an application arrived, administrative personnel placed it in an individual folder, to which additional\nmaterials, such as letters of recommendation, were added as they arrived at the law school. Each folder was\ncolor-coded based on two criteria: residency and race or ethnicity. The residency classification indicated whether\nthe applicant was a resident or nonresident of Texas. The race or ethnicity classification was based on which of\nseveral boxes the applicant checked on the application: Black/African American, Native American, Asian\nAmerican, Mexican American, Other Hispanic, White, or Other. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 19-20.\nThe application deadline was February 1. However, because the law school wished to get early offers sent to top\napplicants in late January if possible, Johanson drew initial presumptive admission lines as soon as he had an\ninitial computer printout showing the numbers and qualifications of the applicants. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26-27. At\nthis point, about half of the applications were complete; therefore, Johanson drew the initial lines relatively high to\n[21]\navoid too many early offers of admission before the quality of the entire pool of applicants was defined.  The\n\n561 goal of *561 the initial presumptive admission lines Johanson drew was to ensure that the top candidates in each\n[22]\ncategory received offers of admission from the law school as soon as possible.\nOnce Johanson determined which files were in the presumptive admission category, he conducted a preliminary\n[23]\nreview of the files.  By the end of the admissions process, Johanson reviewed 300 to 350 resident files and\n200 to 250 nonresident files in this category. Johanson, vol. 3 at 32-35. In his review of these files, Johanson\nchecked to see if the applicant's TI was inflated by high grades in a noncompetitive major or at a weak school or\nif there was some other questionable feature of the applicant's file. Johanson generally held those files for further\nreview in the discretionary zone. Johanson dropped approximately ten percent of the presumptive admission\napplicants into the discretionary category. Those applicants with a high TI reflecting a high LSAT and high grades\nin a rigorous major at a leading undergraduate institution were admitted by Johanson, who had unilateral\nauthority to admit any applicant in this category without further consultation with the full admissions committee.\nD-362.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, Johanson set another line, and applicants whose TIs fell below that line were\npresumptively denied admission. One or two members of the admissions committee reviewed each application in\nthis category to determine if the TI adequately reflected the applicant's likelihood of success in law school or\ncompetitive standing relative to the entire applicant pool. Johanson, vol. 3 at 31-32; P-41; D-362. Generally, as a\nresult of this review, twenty to forty files were upgraded from the presumptive denial zone to the discretionary\nzone, although Johanson did not recall the specific number of files moved to the discretionary zone in 1992. \nJohanson, vol. 5 at 24-25.\nThe middle category was comprised of those applicants whose TIs fell between the presumptive denial line and\nthe presumptive admission line, those applicants who Johanson had moved down from the presumptive\nadmission category, and those applicants who reviewers had moved up from the presumptive denial category. In\nthe middle discretionary category, reviewers focused less attention on the applicant's numbers, as all were\nrelatively close, and instead carefully evaluated the applicant's qualifications as reflected by the entire file. \nGoode, vol. 9 at 4; D-362.\nThe standards the law school applied to assess applicants in this system differed based on race and national\norigin in two ways. First, Johanson's determination of the presumptive admission and denial TIs varied between\n[24]\nnonminorities and minorities.  By March 1992, Johanson had lowered the presumptive admission score for\n562 resident nonminorities from a threshold setting of 202/90 to 199/87.[25] Similarly, Johanson lowered the *562\npresumptive admission score for Mexican American applicants from 196/84 to 189/78 and the presumptive\nadmission score for black applicants from 192/80 to 189/78. P-49. The presumptive denial score for nonminorities\nwas 192/80, and the presumptive denial score for blacks and Mexican Americans was 179/69. Thus, the\npresumptive denial score for nonminorities was higher than the presumptive admission score for minorities.\nAdditionally, the law school admissions committee had different procedures for the review of nonminority and\nminority files in the discretionary zone. Nonminority files were divided into stacks of thirty, which were reviewed\n[26]\nby three members of the admissions committee.  Each person on the three-person subcommittee voted, on an\nindividual basis with no verbal or written explanation, to offer admission to a set number of applicants from within\n[27]\nthe stack of thirty files.  After the three members completed their independent screening of the files, Johanson\ncompiled a master tally sheet reflecting the number of votes received by each applicant in the group of thirty-five. \nSee, e.g., P-73. Subject to Johanson's review, those applicants that received two or three votes were offered\n[28]\nadmission.  In 1992, the law school made an average of nine offers of admission per stack. P-58. Those who\n[29]\nreceived no votes were automatically denied admission at that time.  The law school sent a letter offering\napplicants who received one vote a place on the waiting list.\nThe minority subcommittee reviewed the minority files. In theory, each member of the subcommittee was to be\npart of the three-person subcommittees that reviewed the nonminority files. The testimony reflected, however,\nthat in 1992 Aleman was not on any of the nonminority screening subcommittees. Compare D-362 with\nJohanson, vol. 6 at 26. According to the testimony, instead of each member of the minority subcommittee\nperforming an individual review of the minority files, as was the procedure for review of nonminority files, the\n\n[30]\nminority subcommittee met as a group and reviewed each minority applicant's file.  The subcommittee did not\nreview a set number of files at each meeting but, instead, made as many decisions as the members felt\ncomfortable with until their \"decision-making powers started to wane.\" Johanson, vol. 5 at 30. Resident\npresumptive denial minority files were screened exclusively by Johanson and Hamilton. Id. at 25.\nThe members of the minority subcommittee attended the meeting of the full committee and provided the full\ncommittee with a summary of the files the subcommittee believed to be good applicants for admission. Wellborn,\n563 vol. 24 at 18. Although the evidence *563 reflected that the subcommittee shared general information about the\nminority pool of applicants with the full committee, the minority subcommittee's admission decisions on individual\n[31]\napplicants were virtually final.\nC. Admission Goals and Guidelines\nThe law school is the State's premier law school and is top-rated nationally. The cost of a legal education at the\nlaw school, a state-supported institution, is inexpensive in comparison to other schools of its caliber and,\ntherefore, a bargain for the quality of education the law school's students receive. As a consequence, over 4000\n[32]\napplicants to law school each year compete for approximately 500 available seats.\nIn selecting the entering class, the law school admissions committee has two specified requirements it must\nachieve. First, state law mandates the percentage of nonresidents that may be included in the entering class. In\n[33]\n1992, the law school was prohibited from having more than fifteen percent nonresidents in the entering class.\nThe other fixed figure to which the admissions committee must adhere has been set by the Board of Regents.\nThis mandate requires the entering class to be composed of at least 500 students.\nIn addition to these established figures, the law school attempts to meet the targets established by the Office of\nCivil Rights through the Texas Plan of ten percent Mexican American students and five percent black students in\nan entering class. Johanson, vol. 4 at 10. These numbers reflect an effort to achieve an entering class with levels\nof minority enrollment generally consistent with the percentages of black and Mexican American college\ngraduates. The OCR figures, however, are aspirations only, subject to the quality of the pool of applicants. \nJohanson, vol. 4 at 9; Goode, vol. 9 at 12-13.\n[34]\nPersonal interviews are not part of the law school's admission process.  Therefore, the law school must make\nits decision based on the information provided in the applicant's file, which, in addition to the application form and\nLSDAS material, may include a personal statement or letters of recommendation. The law school used the TI as\nan administrative tool to order candidates for review in the admissions process. However, the law school did not\nrely solely on the TI as the basis for admissions decisions but instead used it to create presumptions that could\n[35]\nbe overcome upon individual review of the files.  The importance of individual review stems from the fact that\nthe applicants selected for admission come from a relatively narrow band within the full range of scores, and a\ndifference of few points does not necessarily correlate with more successful work in law school. Johanson, vol. 3\nat 11; Stein, vol. 18 at 15. Further, the TI does not adequately reflect the qualifications and characteristics a law\nschool should consider in developing a diverse student body, which provides substantial educational benefit for\nall members of a law school class. Brest, vol. 22 at 14.\n564  III. THE PLAINTIFFS\n*564\nIn 1992, Hopwood, Elliott, Carvell, and Rogers applied for admission to the law school. Hopwood is a white\nfemale; Elliott, Carvell, and Rogers are white males. None of the plaintiffs are Mexican American and all are\n[36]\nresidents of Texas.\n\nA. Cheryl Hopwood\nCheryl Hopwood had a TI of 199, which placed her in the resident presumptive admit range. Hopwood's TI\n[37]\nreflects a 3.8 grade point average and an LSAT score of 39.  Hopwood's application indicates she received an\nassociate's degree in accounting from Montgomery County Community College in May 1984 and a bachelor's\ndegree in accounting from California State University in Sacramento in 1988. The application further indicates\nshe is a certified public accountant in California, she worked twenty to thirty hours a week while obtaining her\nundergraduate degree, and she was active in Big Brothers and Big Sisters in California. P-145. Hopwood\nsubmitted an additional letter to the law school dated January 22, 1992, requesting permission to attend law\nschool on a limited basis the first year, if accepted, because of the needs of her child, who had been born with\n[38] [39]\ncerebral palsy.  Hopwood's application file contains no letters of recommendation.  Additionally, her\nresponses to the questions are brief and do not elaborate on her background and skill. She provided no personal\n[40]\nstatement with the application.\nAfter his initial review of Hopwood's file, Johanson dropped her from the presumptive admission zone to the\ndiscretionary zone because, in his evaluation, she had not attended schools that were academically competitive\nwith those of the majority of the applicants, had a large number of hours at junior colleges, and was able to\n[41]\nmaintain a high GPA although working a substantial number of hours.  Her file was subsequently reviewed by\na three-member subcommittee of the admissions committee, which was comprised of Associate Dean Michael\nSharlot, Dean Hamilton, and a law student. P-217 (Answer to int. 3). Because Hopwood received only one vote\n565 as result of the subcommittee review, the law school sent her a letter, dated April *565 8, 1992, offering her a\n[42]\nplace on the waiting list.\nThe letter, which stated \"[w]e regret that we cannot grant you admission to the 1992 entering class of the Law\nSchool at this time,\" instructed Hopwood to return the attached form to the law school within three weeks if she\nwished to be placed on the waiting list. P-145. The letter further instructed Hopwood not to put her name on the\nlist if she would not be able to accept an offer of admission as late as August. Hopwood testified she\nsubsequently called the law school admissions office and was told offers could be made from the waiting list\nthrough the first week of school. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 11-12. Hopwood did not put her name on the list because\npersonnel in the law school's admissions office could provide no information regarding the likelihood of\nadmittance from the list and Hopwood did not believe she would be in a position to make last minute\narrangements for her special childcare needs if she were admitted either just before or in the first week of\nclasses. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 12.\nThe Court finds that, under Hopwood's circumstances, she was effectively denied admission when she received\nthe April 8 letter. Her failure to accept a position on the waiting list or to seek a deferral of admission until the\nfollowing year, which information the Court notes is not included in the law school's April 8 letter to Hopwood,\n[43]\ndoes not negate this fact.\nB. Kenneth Elliott\nKenneth Elliott applied with a TI of 197, representing a GPA of 2.98 and an LSAT score of 167. Elliott's\napplication indicates he received a B.B.A. in accounting from the University of Texas in 1984, is a certified public\naccountant, and has worked as an auditor or examiner for state agencies since receiving his undergraduate\ndegree. P-153. In addition to his personal statement, Elliott's file contains two letters of recommendation from\nemployment supervisors.\nIn the discretionary zone of nonminority applicants, Elliott's file was reviewed by a subcommittee of three that\nincluded Johanson. D-332 at A-33. Elliott received no votes, and the law school sent him a denial letter dated\nApril 11, 1992. P-153. In July 1992, Elliott's father wrote a letter to Dean Mark Yudof in which he requested that\nElliott's application for admission be reconsidered. P-165. Elliott's father further stated that Elliott did not know he\nwas writing the letter and that Elliott's \"friends and family all feel that he was not accepted to U.T. because of\n\nlimited openings at U.T. due to mandatory minority and women quotas which use a large percentage of the\n[44]\nopenings.\"  The dean referred the letter to Hamilton, who informed Elliott's father that although she was not at\nliberty to discuss Elliott's application, she would pursue the matter with Elliott if Elliott felt he had been treated\nunfairly. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 67. Hamilton testified she telephoned Elliott, told him she had received a letter on his\nbehalf, and invited him to come to her office to visit. Id. at 67-68. Hamilton testified Elliott canceled the first\nappointment and she scheduled a second appointment, which she canceled. Hamilton testified she subsequently\n566 called him back and told him she was placing him on the waiting list.[45] Elliott, however, testified *566 he had no\nfurther conversations with anyone at the law school after the failed meetings and did not know he had been\nplaced on the waiting list. Elliott, vol. 7 at 21.\nHamilton testified that on August 24, she decided to grant Elliott an offer of admission, left a message on his\nanswering machine, and instructed admissions personnel to continue to try to reach him. Hamilton, vol. 2 at\n58-59. Hamilton stated that approximately a week later, after classes had begun, Elliott returned her call but\nindicated it was impossible for him to attend school at that time. Id. at 59-60. However, in Hamilton's affidavit,\nsubmitted to this Court as part of the pretrial motions, Hamilton stated that Elliott never responded to her phone\ncalls. D-447 (Supp.Decl. of Hamilton at 3). Further, Elliott's file contains no letters either notifying him of his\nplacement on the waiting list or his admission to school, despite the existence of such documentation for others\noffered admission from the waiting list late in the process.\nThe Court finds that Elliott had to have realized, at minimum, his application was under reconsideration when an\nassistant dean initially contacted him. However, being offered a position on the waiting list, as the Court has\nalready found, is not equivalent to admission. To determine whether Elliott actually received an offer of\nadmission, the Court must evaluate the conflicting testimony of Elliott and Hamilton. The discrepancies in\nHamilton's affidavit and trial testimony, as well as the law school's lack of documentation of Elliott's status, weigh\n[46]\nin Elliott's favor.  Accordingly, the Court finds that Elliott was not notified of his admission to law school.\nIn 1992, Elliott also applied to Baylor School of Law and Texas Tech School of Law. He was denied admission to\nBaylor. Although accepted at Texas Tech, a state university, Elliott declined the offer of admission by letter dated\nJune 2, 1992. See D-401.\nC. Douglas Carvell\nDouglas Carvell had a TI of 197, which was based on an undergraduate GPA of 3.28 and an average LSAT score\n[47]\nin the 76th percentile.  His application reflects that in 1991 he received his B.A. in political science from\nHendrix College in Conway, Arizona. P-151. The LSDAS report indicates Carvell ranked 98th in his class of 247\nat Hendrix College. P-151; D-336 at A-49. Carvell provided detailed responses to the application questions on\ntypewritten attachments to his application. Carvell's file included three letters of recommendation, one from a\nprofessor at Hendrix College that compliments his intellectual abilities but describes his performance as uneven,\ndisappointing, and mediocre. P-151.\nBecause Carvell's TI placed him in the nonminority discretionary zone, his file was reviewed by a subcommittee\nof three. He received no votes from the two faculty members on the subcommittee, Professors Steven Goode\nand Mark Gergen, but did get one favorable vote from a student member of the committee. See D-335, D-336.\nTherefore, by letter dated April 15, 1992, the law school offered him a position on the waiting list, which he\naccepted. While he was on the waiting list, Carvell's file was reviewed by Associate Dean Michael Sharlot, a\nmember of the admissions committee. Sharlot did not vote to admit Carvell from the waiting list. D-334 at A-43-\nA-44. By letter dated July 16, 1992, the law school denied Carvell admission. P-151.\nIn addition to the law school, Carvell applied for admission to Southern Methodist University School of Law and\n567 Vanderbilt *567 School of Law. He was denied admission to Vanderbilt, but was accepted at SMU, where he has\ncompleted his first year of law school. Carvell, vol. 10 at 6-7. Carvell also applied to the University of Texas\nSchool of Business and was denied admission. Id. at 12. At SMU, Carvell is pursuing a master's of business\nadministration in a joint program with the SMU law school. Id. at 6.\n\nD. David Rogers\nDavid Rogers had a TI of 197 based on his undergraduate GPA of 3.13 and an LSAT score of 166. In the early to\nmid-1980s, Rogers attended the University of Texas as a student in Plan II, an honors program. However, in\n1985, he was dismissed because of his poor scholastic performance. Rogers, vol. 11 at 55. Rogers subsequently\nattended the University of Houston-Downtown and received an undergraduate degree in professional writing in\n1990. P-171; Rogers, vol. 11 at 56. In 1992, Rogers received an advanced degree in professional writing from\nthe University of Southern California. P-171. Rogers noted on his law school application that \"as a white who\nattended an allminority school for several years, and who was raised by a single mother, I have an unusual\nunderstanding of the challenges faced by women and minorities.\" P-171. Rogers's application file contains no\nletters of recommendation. P-171; see also D-335 at A-46-A-47.\nRogers received no votes from any member of the subcommittee that reviewed his file in the nonminority\ndiscretionary zone. By letter dated April 7, 1992, he was denied admission to the law school. P-171.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Ripeness and Standing\nAs a preliminary matter, the defendants contest the ripeness of two of the plaintiffs' claims and the standing of all\n[48]\nplaintiffs to bring this cause of action.  With regard to Hopwood and Elliott, the defendants argue their claims\n[49]\nare not ripe because neither was denied admission.  As stated above, the Court has found both Hopwood and\nElliott were, in effect, denied admission to the law school. Therefore, a ripe controversy exists between these two\nplaintiffs and the defendants.\nThe defendants contend Hopwood lacked standing to challenge the admissions policy because she failed to\naccept a position on the waiting list or to ask for deferred admission. Therefore, according to the defendants, she\nhas failed to exhaust the administrative procedures available to her. The defendants further contend all plaintiffs\nlack standing in that none can show they would have been granted admission absent the challenged admissions\n[50]\npolicies.\nTo have standing to challenge a governmental action, a plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete \"injury in fact,\" a\ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, and a likelihood the injury will be redressed by\na favorable decision. Northeastern Fla. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, ___ U.S. ___, ___ - ___, 113 S.Ct.\n2297, 2301-02, 124 L.Ed.2d 586 (1993). However, the \"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case involving a\nbarrier that makes it more difficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another\ngroup is the denial of the equal treatment and not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. Id. at ___, 113 S.Ct.\nat 2303.\nThe defendants assert this exception to requiring plaintiffs to show a direct causal relationship is limited in its\napplication to challenges to the validity of express set-asides or reservations such as those addressed in City of\n568 Jacksonville and Bakke. The Court does not read the requirements for standing set forth in City of Jacksonville\n*568 to be limited in the manner defendants contend. In defining standing as applied in equal protection cases,\nthe Supreme Court reviewed its precedent on the issue. The overarching proposition of the cases the Supreme\nCourt cited in reaching its holding was not that the causal-connection exception applied only to specific set-\nasides, but that an \"injury in fact\" stemmed from any governmental barrier that either created a discriminatory\n[51]\nobstacle or had the effect of producing unequal access to a governmental benefit.  Accordingly, the Court finds\nall the plaintiffs have standing 00 they have sufficiently alleged that the law school's admission process is the\n97\n[52]\ncause of their injury and that a judicial order could redress the injury.\n\nB. Standard of Review\nAffirmative action plans based on race trigger strict judicial scrutiny. City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488\nU.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 721, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989); see also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 291, 98 S.Ct. at 2748\n(Powell, J.) (\"Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting\njudicial examination.\"). Further, \"the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged\nclassification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination.\" \nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 273, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1846, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986); see also \nCroson, 488 U.S. at 494, 109 S.Ct. at 722 (reaffirming equal protection analysis is not dependent on the race of\nthose burdened or benefited by a classification).\nThe defendants contend, however, strict scrutiny is inappropriate in this cause in light of the Supreme Court's\nholding in Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990). In Metro\nBroadcasting, the Supreme Court held that affirmative action plans adopted pursuant to federal mandates are\nsubject to intermediate scrutiny 00 a determination whether the plans serve important governmental objectives\n97\nand whether they are substantially related to the achievement of the objectives. Id. at 565, 110 S.Ct. at 3009. The\ndefendants contend that the Texas Plans equate to a federal mandate because they stem from the OCR's\n[53]\ninsistence on full compliance with Title VI, an objective that is within the power of Congress.\nThe Court finds the argument unpersuasive. In Metro, the FCC's minority ownership programs had been\nspecifically mandated and approved by Congress. Id. at 563, 110 S.Ct. at 3008. While it is true that Congress has\nthe power to identify and redress the effects of discrimination and has charged the DOE with assuring\ncompliance with Title VI, there is no similar congressional mandate in this cause. Further, the FCC is a licensing\nbody that, pursuant to a congressional mandate, established specific minority ownership policies. The OCR has\nprovided Texas with a number of suggested tools Texas may implement to bring the higher educational system\n569 into compliance with Title VI; it has not, however, required *569 the State to adopt any specific procedures.\nAlthough the defendants characterize the law school's efforts as pursuant to an OCR \"consent decree,\" the\nevidence reflects that, to date, the State of Texas' efforts to comply with Title VI have been made voluntarily in an\neffort to avoid a specific mandate or the loss of federal funding. Ashworth, vol. 13 at 34, 39.\nFurther, under equal protection analysis, the same level of scrutiny applies to race-conscious affirmative action\nplans adopted pursuant to consent agreements as to other voluntarily adopted plans. See, e.g., In re Birmingham\nReverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 833 F.2d 1492, 1501 (11th Cir.1987),aff'd sub nom. Martin v. Wilks,\n490 U.S. 755, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989) (Title VII consent decree). Indeed, the most recent circuit\ncourt opinion analyzing an affirmative action plan in the education context, specifically a scholarship plan adopted\nin response to protracted litigation and OCR guidelines, upheld the lower court's application of strict scrutiny as\nthe proper standard for review of the plan. See Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 55 (4th Cir.1992).\nThe most compelling justification for application of strict scrutiny in this context is to provide assurance that\nindividual rights are afforded the full protection they merit under the Constitution. Only by applying strict scrutiny\ncan a court honestly weigh the validity and necessity of efforts to remedy past wrongs against the rights of\notherwise qualified nonminorities affected by the efforts. Although the use of racial classifications is disfavored,\nthere are instances when such classifications serving proper purposes should be upheld. Only through diligent\njudicial examination can a court determine if a classification is consistent with constitutional guarantees and not\nrelated to \"illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at\n721. Accordingly, the Court concludes the law school admissions process must be subjected to a strict scrutiny\ntest under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect both the integrity of the process\n[54]\nand the important individual rights at issue.\n\nC. Application of Strict Scrutiny\nStrict judicial scrutiny involves a determination of whether the law school process served \"a compelling\ngovernmental interest\" and whether the process is \"narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal.\" See \nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 274, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1847, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986). The purpose\nof ascertaining whether a compelling governmental interest exists is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by\nensuring that the goal is important enough to use the suspect tool of racial preference. Croson, 488 U.S. at 493,\n109 S.Ct. at 721. The narrowly tailored analysis \"ensures that the means chosen `fit' this compelling goal so\nclosely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or\nstereotype.\" Id.\n1. Compelling Governmental Interest. 00 Both sides expended considerable time and effort at trial on the issue of\n97\nwhether a compelling governmental interest existed sufficient to justify the need for the law school's affirmative\naction program. The defendants offered a number of reasons as justification for the law school's affirmative action\n[55]\nprogram. These reasons are set forth in the law school's \"Statement of Policy on Affirmative Action\":\n570 *570 To achieve the School of Law's mission of providing a first class legal education to future\nleaders of the bench and bar of the state by offering real opportunities for admission to members\nof the two largest minority groups in Texas, Mexican Americans and African Americans;\nTo achieve the diversity of background and experience in its student population essential to\nprepare students for the real world functioning of the law in our diverse nation;\nTo assist in redressing the decades of educational discrimination to which African Americans and\nMexican Americans have been subjected in the public school systems of the State of Texas;\nTo achieve compliance with the 1983 consent decree entered with the Office of Civil Rights of the\nDepartment of Education imposing specific requirement for increased efforts to recruit African\nAmerican and Mexican American students;\nTo achieve compliance with the American Bar Association and the American Association of Law\nSchools standards of commitment to pluralist diversity in the law school's student population.\nD-362. Although all are important and laudable goals, the law school's efforts, to be consistent with the Equal\nProtection Clause, must be limited to seeking the educational benefits that flow from having a diverse student\nbody and to addressing the present effects of past discriminatory practices. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313; 98 S.Ct.\nat 2760 (environment fostering robust exchange of ideas makes goal of diversity \"of paramount importance in the\nfulfillment of [a university's] mission\"); United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1064, 94\nL.Ed.2d 203 (1987) (\"The government unquestionably has a compelling interest in remedying past and present\ndiscrimination by a state actor.\"); Podberesky, 956 F.2d at 57 (race-related remedy may be used in attempt to\n[56]\nremedy effects of past discrimination). Accordingly, the Court will evaluate the program in light of these goals.\nThe plaintiffs do not dispute that under the holding of Bakke, obtaining the benefits that flow from a racially and\n[57]\nethnically diverse student body is a compelling interest justifying the use of racial preferences.  Nevertheless,\nthe plaintiffs suggest that under more recent Supreme Court decisions, the only compelling interest recognized\n[58]\nfor race-conscious programs is remedying the past effects of racial discrimination.  However, none of the\nrecent opinions is factually based in the education context and, therefore, none focuses on the unique role of\n571 education in our society.[59] Absent an explicit statement from the Supreme Court overruling Bakke, this *571\nCourt finds, in the context of the law school's admissions process, obtaining the educational benefits that flow\nfrom a racially and ethnically diverse student body remains a sufficiently compelling interest to support the use of\nracial classifications.\nThe defendants presented evidence, which included the testimony of deans from law schools across the country\nand the testimony of former and current law students, that the benefit to the law school educational experience\n\nderived from a diverse student population is substantial. See, e.g., Brest, vol. 22 at 22-23; Stein, vol. 18 at 20-21; \nBollinger, vol. 16 at 23-26; Spector, vol. 15 at 9-10. Additionally, several professors testified regarding the\neducational benefit of having a diverse group of students in the classroom setting. See, e.g., Goode, vol. 9 at\n20-21; Yudof, vol. 21 at 59-60. According to the evidence presented at trial, without affirmative action the law\nschool would not be able to achieve this goal of diversity. Had the law school based its 1992 admissions solely on\nthe applicants' TIs without regard to race or ethnicity, the entering class would have included, at most, nine blacks\n[60]\nand eighteen Mexican Americans.\nAlthough under current law the goal of diversity is sufficient by itself to satisfy the compelling governmental\ninterest element of strict scrutiny, the objective of overcoming past effects of discrimination is an equally\nimportant goal of the law school's affirmative action program. The plaintiffs have asserted that any past\ndiscrimination against blacks occurred so long ago, it has no present effects and that the law school has never\n[61]\ndiscriminated against Mexican Americans.  The plaintiffs further assert the Court should limit its review of past\ndiscrimination to official acts and policy of the University of Texas law school and should not consider\ndiscrimination in Texas' educational system as a whole. As support for this contention the plaintiffs cite Croson, in\nwhich the Supreme Court struck down a city set-aside program that required thirty percent of city contracts to be\nsubcontracted to minority businesses. 488 U.S. at 499, 109 S.Ct. at 724 (\"Like the claim that discrimination in\nprimary and secondary school justifies a rigid racial preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous\nclaim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial\nquota.\").\nRecently, however, the Supreme Court held that a system of higher education is under an affirmative duty to\neliminate every vestige of racial segregation and discrimination in its educational system and to reform those\npolicies and practices that required or contributed to separation of the races. United States v. Fordice, ___ U.S.\n___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 2727, 2743, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992). Thus, it appears the Supreme Court has recognized\nthat the restrictions it has applied in ascertaining the present effects of past discrimination in the employment\ncontext, specifically the prohibition against remedying effects of \"societal discrimination\" and discrimination\nimplemented by another governmental unit, are not appropriate in the education context. See also Podberesky v.\nKirwan, 838 F.Supp. 1075, 1098 & n. 79 (D.Md. 1993). \"Applicants do not arrive at the admissions office of a\nprofessional school in a vacuum,\" and, in fact, have ordinarily been students in an educational system for sixteen\nyears. Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799, 809 (6th Cir.1986). The Court believes, therefore, the residual effects of\npast discrimination in a particular component of a state's educational system must be analyzed in the context of\nthe state's educational system as a whole. The State's institutions of higher education are inextricably linked to\n572 the primary and secondary schools in the system. Accordingly, *572 this Court has not limited its review to the\n[62]\nlaw school or Texas' higher education system in evaluating the present effects of past discrimination.\nHowever, were the Court to limit its review to the University of Texas, the Court would still find a \"strong\nevidentiary basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary.\" Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d at 55.\nAs discussed above, Texas' long history of discrimination against blacks and Mexican Americans in public\neducation is chronicled in court opinions, the findings of the OCR, and the continuing desegregation suits against\n[63]\nthe State.  The State of Texas engaged in overt discrimination against blacks until the practices were forcibly\ndismantled in the relatively recent past. Discrimination in education was at the center of official discrimination\nagainst black Texans. Additionally, the University of Texas has a history of racial discrimination.\nSimilarly, the State has subjected Mexican Americans to discriminatory practices in the education area as\nreflected in the findings of unlawful de jure discrimination in the numerous desegregation lawsuits. Less\ndocumentation exists of overt official discrimination against Mexican Americans than against blacks at the\nUniversity of Texas. However, the legacy of Texas' discriminatory practices continues to hinder the University of\nTexas' efforts to attract qualified Mexican American students.\nIn recent history, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas. The\nevidence reflects that the university has made genuine efforts in the last decade to end discrimination by\nrecruiting and maintaining minority faculty members and students and condemning racial incidents occurring on\ncampus or involving student organizations. Despite these efforts, however, the legacy of the past has left residual\n\neffects that persist into the present. The evidence presented at trial indicates those effects include the law\nschool's lingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with prospective students, as a \"white\" school;\nan underrepresentation of minorities in the student body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile\nenvironment for minorities.\nThe university's efforts to recruit minorities has led to a modest increase in the number of minorities attending the\nlaw school. However, admissions and recruitment personnel face difficulties in attracting qualified minorities to\nenroll in the law school. These difficulties stem from negative perceptions of the racial climate at the law school\n[64]\nas a result of past discrimination.  Because of the law school's legacy of discrimination, it must overcome a\nperception that it is a \"white institution.\" Wright, vol. 19 at 33-34. Recent racial incidents, although not officially\nsanctioned by the school, have reinforced the perception that the university is hostile to minorities and has hurt its\nability to recruit minority students. Wright, vol. 19 at 29-31. An affirmative action program is therefore necessary\nto recruit minority students because of the past discrimination.\nThe effects of the State's past de jure segregation in the educational system are reflected in the low enrollment of\nminorities in professional schools, including the law school. The OCR findings and the OCR's continuing review\n573 of Texas' efforts to desegregate demonstrate the pervasive nature of past discrimination in the higher education \n[65]\n*573 system.  As a result of policies of official discrimination in the Texas higher education system, a\ngeneration of blacks and Mexican Americans who are the parents of those presently of law school age were\ndenied meaningful opportunities for higher education. Glenn, vol. 23 at 51-53; Romo, vol. 17 at 63-64; Wright,\nvol. 19 at 45-47. The denial of these opportunities to the generation of minority parents bears a causal connection\nto the diminished educational attainment of the present generation. Glenn, vol. 23 at 51-52; Romo, vol. 17 at\n53-54.\nFurther, many public schools in Texas continued to have a substantial degree of racial and ethnic segregation\nduring the 1970s and 1980s, the decades in which the majority of 1992 law school applicants attended primary\nand secondary schools. Glenn, vol. 23 at 48-51; D-379. This segregation has handicapped the educational\nachievement of many minorities. The ultimate effect of the inferior educational opportunity, combined with the\nlower socioeconomic status of minorities in Texas, is a disproportionately smaller pool of minority applicants to\nlaw school. D-379 at 6-7; see also supra note 3.\nIn addition, some minority students enrolled in the law school feel isolated even with the current commitment to\naffirmative action and diversity and are often hesitant to participate in class discussion when they are the sole\nminority or one of a few minorities in a class. Longoria, vol. 15 at 32-34; Rodriguez, vol. 17 at 24-25. Some\nminority students continue to perceive a hostile racial environment on the campus, which they assert is reflected\nin insensitive comments by fellow students and faculty. Bell, vol. 14 at 16, 29-34; Escobedo, vol. 14 at 41-42; \nLongoria, vol. 15 at 32-24.\nAccordingly, despite the plaintiff's protestations to the contrary, the record provides strong evidence of some\npresent effects at the law school of past discrimination in both the University of Texas system and the Texas\neducational system as a whole. Therefore, the Court finds the remedial purpose of the law school's affirmative\naction program is a compelling governmental objective.\n2. Narrowly Tailored. 00 The Court must next decide if the admissions process was narrowly tailored to achieve\n97\nthe goals of diversity and overcoming the present effects of past discrimination. This determination requires the\napplication of four factors: the efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration of the relief; the\nrelationship of the numerical goals to the percentage of minorities in the relevant population; and the impact of\nthe relief on the rights of third parties. See United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1066,\n94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987).\nThe defendants have shown it is not possible to achieve a diverse student body without an affirmative action\nprogram that seeks to admit and enroll minority candidates. Brest, vol. 22, at 15. As stated above, in 1992, the\nentering class would have included at most nine blacks and eighteen Mexican Americans, had the review of\nminorities been limited to those applicants in the presumptive admit and discretionary zones for white applicants.\n\nD-441; Yudof, vol. 21 at 44; Johanson, vol. 6 at 38. These numbers reflect the maximum potential and assume no\nadverse affect on the number of applicants stemming from the abandonment of affirmative action.\nFurther, the record indicates the ultimate effect of abandoning affirmative action at the law school would be to\nredirect minorities to the historically separate state law school at Texas Southern University, thereby\n574 resegregating the law school.[66] Alternatives, such as minority scholarships and increased minority *574\nrecruitment, while effective tools in conjunction with the affirmative action program, would not be effective means\nby themselves to meet the compelling governmental interests of true diversity and remedying the effect of past de\njure segregation. In fact, the record in this case demonstrates that, without affirmative action, the perception of\nthe law school as a \"white\" institution would be exacerbated, which would compound the difficulties of attracting\ntop minority students. Wright, vol. 19 at 36-37; Goode, vol. 9 at 19; Rodriguez, vol. 17 at 25.\nThe evidence shows that despite genuine efforts to end discrimination, the legacy of the past continues to hinder\nthe law school's efforts to attract highly qualified minority students. Accordingly, the Court finds affirmative action\nin the law school's admissions program is an effective and necessary means to overcome the legacy of the past\nand to achieve the diversity necessary for a first-class university.\nThe plaintiffs argue the admissions program establishes the functional equivalent of an impermissible quota\nsystem in which the law school attempts to camouflage quotas through the use of the term \"goals.\" The plaintiffs\ncontend because the admissions committee knows the approximate number of students in an incoming class, the\nfive percent black and ten percent Mexican American figures translate into specific numbers.\nThe admissions data from the past ten years shows variations in the admission figures for the two groups\nreceiving admissions preferences at the law school 00 blacks and Mexican Americans. The data reflects that\n97\nbetween 1983 and 1993, the percentage of black admissions varied from a low of 3.2 percent, occurring in 1987,\nto a high of 9.3 percent in 1983. The percentage in 1992 was 8.0 percent. Mexican American admissions varied\nfrom a low of 10 percent, occurring in both 1983 and 1993, and a high of 14.3 percent occurring in 1984. The\n[67]\npercentage in 1992 was 10.7.\nAn illegal quota, as defined by the Supreme Court, exists when a fixed number of seats are set aside or an\nunyielding number is set to achieve a goal. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 288, 98 S.Ct. at 2747 (defining quota as fixed\nnumber of seats set aside); see also Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 599, 110 S.Ct. at 3027 (equating quota with\na \"fixed quantity set aside\"); Croson, 488 U.S. at 499, 109 S.Ct. at 724-25 (describing thirty percent minority set-\naside as rigid and unyielding quota); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 498, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2785, 65 L.Ed.2d\n902 (1980) (equating quota with set-aside). Though it is evident from the admissions figures that the percentages\nof desired minorities in a class derived from the OCR investigation served as guidelines, the law school did not\nrigidly and inflexibly apply the numbers. Instead, the percentages fluctuate randomly, albeit within a relatively\nnarrow range, and show no consistent pattern of increase. In some years, the law school has failed to meet its\ngoals because of the relatively weak strength of the minority applicant pool. Goode, vol. 9 at 13-17. No evidence\nwas presented at trial that the law school granted a set-aside for any particular group or that competition for any\n[68]\nspecific seat in the class was closed to some students because of race or ethnicity.  Accordingly, the Court\nfinds the 1992 admissions process did not use an illegal quota but was, in fact, flexible in achieving its goals\nbased on the strength of the minority applicant pool.\n575 *575 As for duration, the law school has not stated precisely how long it envisions maintaining its affirmative\naction admissions program. However, in the 1990s, as the minority applicant pool improved, the admissions\ncommittee made the decision not to admit greater numbers of minority students but to attempt to close the gap in\ncredentials of minority and nonminority students. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 31-35; Goode, vol. 9 at 7, 17-18. Therefore,\nin 1992, despite a significant increase in the number of minority applicants from the previous years, the law\nschool's minority admissions remained relatively stable. Johanson, vol. 6 at 13-14; P-47; D-438; D-439.\nThe current objective of the law school, as articulated at trial, is to continue to narrow the gap to the point where\naffirmative action will not be required to achieve a representative percentage of minorities in the entering classes.\n[69]\n The evidence reflects that the law school admissions committee regularly reviews and adjusts the remedy to\n[70]\nevaluate its necessity and efficacy.  Certainly, an indefinite program would violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nHowever, the law school's use of the program until the OCR has determined Texas is in compliance with Title VI\nand until the gap in minority and nonminority credentials has narrowed such that the State will remain in\ncompliance with Title VI without the need for affirmative action does not offend the Constitution. See Podberesky,\n764 F.Supp. at 376.\nThe third factor, the relationship of the numerical goals to the relevant population, is easily satisfied under these\nfacts. The law school has not attempted to set goals that reflect the percentage of minorities in the general\npopulation or the percentage of minorities attending college. Instead the law school's goals for minority\nenrollment are generally in line with the percentages of black and Mexican American college graduates in the\nState of Texas. These goals stem from the OCR investigation and the resulting Texas Plans. Goode, vol. 9 at\n12-13; Johanson, vol. 4 at 9-12. They are reasonable and logically related to the size of the relevant pool of\nminority prospects for higher education.\nThe final factor, the impact of the procedure on the rights of innocent third parties, is the most difficult to evaluate.\nBy definition, if one person is given preferential treatment based on race or ethnicity to overcome a heritage of\npast societal wrongs, another person is penalized. However, the person penalized or that person's ancestors may\nnever have discriminated against the preferred race or ethnicity. Although the past history of societal\ndiscrimination in certain institutions may justify the remedy, in the end, individuals pay the price. Therefore, it is\nimperative that the mechanics of any program implementing race-based preferences respect and protect the\nrights of individuals who, ultimately, may have to sacrifice their interests as a remedy for societal wrongs.\nIn 1992, admissions subcommittees of three reviewed all the nonminority files. With the exception of Johanson\nand Hamilton, none of the members of the subcommittees reviewed the individual minority files. Nonminority\napplicants receiving no votes were denied admission without any further consideration or any direct comparison\nto minority applicants. In fact, as early as February 28, 1992, the law school had sent denial letters to 201\nresident applicants, none of whom were black or Mexican American. P-43. By March 24, 1992, 718 denial letters\nhad been sent to resident applicants, all to nonminority applicants. P-52. The law school did not reject any\nminority applicants until later in the admissions process. P-60.\n576 The lack of individual comparison between minority and nonminority files resulted primarily *576 from the\nseparate admissions procedures for minorities and nonminorities in the discretionary zone; this is the aspect of\nthe procedure that is at issue with respect to the four plaintiffs in this cause, who were evaluated in the\ndiscretionary zone. However, the setting of different presumptive denial lines for minorities and nonminorities\ncreates a similar problem: some nonminority applicants who fell below the nonminority presumptive denial line,\nthough having a higher score than minority applicants placed in the discretionary zone, were rejected early in the\n[71]\nprocess with no comparison to the individual minority applicants.  Further, although a presumptive denial\nscore was established for minorities, in 1992, every minority applicant not admitted from the presumptive admit\ncategory was treated as if in the minority discretionary zone. P-103.\nThe defendants defend the system used in 1992 as more effective in controlling the use of race for limited,\nlegitimate purposes than the previous procedure of commingling minority and nonminority files in the stacks of\nthirty, a procedure that allowed individual reviewers complete discretion on the extent, if any, to implement\naffirmative action. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 8-17. The defendants assert the 1992 process was also more efficient in\nthat minority files were reviewed by the persons most experienced in reviewing and evaluating minority files. \nGoode, vol. 9 at 3. The defendants concede that in 1992, with the exception of Johanson and Hamilton, no\nmembers of the general admissions committee reviewed individual minority files. However, they contend that the\nfull committee was sufficiently apprised of the relative strengths of the minority and nonminority applicant pools\nthrough information provided by the minority subcommittee. Because the minority subcommittee shared this\ninformation with the full committee, the defendants argue that the full committee could reach a consensus on the\nweight to give race in the admissions process and evaluate the nonminority stacks of files with the relative\nstrengths of the applicant pools in mind. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 10, 14-16; Goode, vol. 9 at 8-9. The defendants also\ndefend the law school's process as consistent with similar processes used at major law schools across the\n577 country.[72] However, review of admissions *577 procedures for equal protection violations requires a fact-\nspecific inquiry. The fact that other schools may use processes with similar components does not resolve the\nissue of whether the defendants deprived the four plaintiffs in this cause of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn Bakke, Justice Powell stated that although race or ethnicity could be a \"plus\" factor in consideration of a\nparticular applicant, race or ethnicity should \"not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates\nfor the available seats.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317, 98 S.Ct. at 2762. Justice Powell further discussed the\nimportance of assuring applicants that they were treated as individuals in the admissions process:\nThe applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate receiving a \"plus\" on\nthe basis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat\nsimply because he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would mean only that his\ncombined qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh\nthose of the other applicant. His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively,\nand he would have no basis to complain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId. at 318, 98 S.Ct. at 2762. The defendants contend this express language is limited in its application to only\nthose affirmative action programs that, like the one at issue in Bakke, use a quota system to achieve diversity.\nThey assert that Justice Powell's reasoning calling for a one-on-one comparison may have application when the\nprimary objective is to obtain a diverse class based on a number of different qualifications. However, this\nreasoning does not apply, according to the defendants, when a primary objective is to remedy past\ndiscrimination. In such circumstances, the defendants maintain individuals need not be compared one-to-one, as\nlong as the admissions committee had a generalized knowledge of the strengths of the minority and nonminority\n[73]\napplicant pools.  The Court disagrees.\nOvercoming the effects of past discrimination is an important goal for our society. The preservation and protection\nof individual rights are equally important. Society must be careful not to ignore the latter to achieve the former, for\n578 to do so would serve only to perpetuate actions of the type affirmative action attempts to redress. Two wrongs do \n*578 not make a right; nor does blatant discrimination cure the ills of past discrimination. Indeed, affirmative\naction that ignores the importance of individual rights may further widen the gap between the races that the law\nschool so diligently attempts to close and create racial hostility. The only proper means of assuring that all\nimportant societal interests are met, whether in the context of creating diversity or redressing the ill effects of past\nwrongs, is to provide a procedure or method by which the qualifications of each individual are evaluated and\ncompared to those of all other individuals in the pool, whether minority or nonminority.\nThe law school owes a duty to the citizens of Texas to allow access to a legal education to the best qualified\napplicants. This does not imply that those applicants with the highest numbers or most prestigious pedigrees are\nnecessarily the best qualified. A multitude of factors, as discussed by Justice Powell in Bakke, should be\n[74]\nconsidered in developing the best qualified class from a given group of applicants.  \"Indeed, the weight\nattributed to a particular quality may vary from year to year depending upon the `mix' both of the student body\nand the applicants for the incoming class.\" Id. at 317-18, 98 S.Ct. at 2762. To achieve the compelling\ngovernmental goal of remedying past discrimination, race and ethnicity are factors that deserve \"pluses\" in the\nweighing of qualifications. To achieve the compelling governmental goal of diversity, nonobjective qualifications of\n[75]\nnonminorities and minorities alike may deserve a similar \"plus\" factor.  Only by comparing the entire pool of\nindividual applicants can both these goals be achieved and the best qualified class of entering law students be\nadmitted.\nThe law school's 1992 admissions procedure, in theory, was designed to select the best qualified applicants from\nthe thousands of applications it received. In 1992, the law school's affirmative action program involved a\ndetermination of those applicants who were the best qualified from the entire minority pool and an attempt to\nenroll sufficient numbers of those applicants in the entering class to satisfy the compelling governmental\nobjectives at issue. The law school evaluated all nonminority applications through a separate process, with the\ngoal of admitting the best qualified nonminorities. The defendants maintain this bifurcated process does not\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment because affirmative action is lawful and those minorities selected are\nevaluated against nonminority applicants by comparison of the general qualifications of the two pools of\napplicants. The process, however, incorporates no meaningful evaluation between the applicants selected from\neach pool 00 a crucial element for protection of individual rights.\n97\n\nThe Court holds that the aspect of the law school's affirmative action program giving minority applicants a \"plus\"\nis lawful. But the failure to provide comparative evaluation among all individual applicants in determining which\nwere the best qualified to comprise the class, including appropriate consideration of a \"plus\" factor, created a\nprocedure in which admission of the best qualified was not assured in 1992. Under the 1992 procedure, the\npossibility existed that the law school could select a minority, who, even with a \"plus\" factor, was not as qualified\nto be a part of the entering class as a nonminority denied admission. Thus, the admission of the nonminority\ncandidate would be solely on the basis of race or ethnicity and not based on individual comparison and\n579 evaluation. *579 This is the aspect of the procedure that is flawed and must be eliminated.\nThe constitutional infirmity of the 1992 law school admissions procedure, therefore, is not that it gives preferential\ntreatment on the basis of race but that it fails to afford each individual applicant a comparison with the entire pool\n[76]\nof applicants, not just those of the applicant's own race.  Because the law school's 1992 admissions process\nwas not narrowly tailored, the Court finds the procedure violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\nD. Effect of Process on Plaintiffs\nThe next issue the Court must address is whether, but for the manner in which the law school improperly\nconsidered race in its 1992 admissions procedure, the plaintiffs would have been offered admission. The\ndefendants argue that the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove they would have been admitted. The plaintiffs argue\nthat once they prove a constitutional violation, the burden shifts to the defendants to establish there was no but-\nfor causation between the unconstitutional procedure and the denial of admission to each plaintiff.\nGenerally, in cases where a plaintiff establishes a constitutional deprivation, the burden shifts to the defendant to\nestablish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action. See, e.g., Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 263, 98\nS.Ct. 1042, 1052, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978) (plaintiff seeking damages for due-process violation must show injuries\nresulted from denial of due process, not from corresponding justifiable deprivation); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ.\nv. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (once employee established conduct\nconstitutionally protected, burden shifted to employer to show it would have reached same decision). Justice\nPowell's opinion in Bakke suggests the same holds true in Title VI discrimination suits when evidence of\n[77]\nalternative reasons exists.  The Supreme Court has recently taken the analysis one step further in the context\nof Title VII discrimination cases and held that the failure of a defendant to produce credible evidence of legitimate\n580 nondiscriminatory reasons is insufficient to support a finding of discrimination *580 because the \"ultimate burden\nof persuasion\" remains at all times with the plaintiff. See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 113\nS.Ct. 2742, 2749, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). In making this clarification, Justice Scalia stated that a court has no\nauthority to impose liability upon an entity for alleged discriminatory practices unless a factfinder determines,\naccording to proper procedures, that the entity has unlawfully discriminated. Id. at ___, 113 S.Ct. at 2751. Courts\nhave borrowed the burden of proof standards formulated for Title VII in deciding claims brought under statutes\nprohibiting discrimination by educational institutions receiving federal funding. See, e.g., Elston v. Talladega\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1404 (11th Cir.1993) (Title VI disparate impact claim). But see Cohen v.\nBrown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 901-02 (1st Cir.1993) (Title IX plaintiff bears burden of showing disparity and unmet\n[78]\ninterest).\nThe Court finds that the cue in Justice Powell's opinion and the holdings of other constitutional cases suggest\nthat a burden allotment similar to that in Title VII cases is appropriate. Therefore, because the plaintiffs\nestablished a prima facie case 00 they proved the law school's 1992 admissions procedure was constitutionally\n97\nflawed 00 the burden shifted to the defendants to establish legitimate grounds for the decision not to admit these\n97\nplaintiffs, notwithstanding the procedure followed. Unlike the university in Bakke, the defendants in this cause did\nnot concede the plaintiffs would have been admitted had their applications been compared on a individual basis\nto minority files. Instead, they offered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for denying each of the plaintiff's\napplications. D-332 (Hopwood, Elliott); D-334 (Hopwood, Carvell); D-335 (Carvell, Rogers); D-336 (Carvell).\nFurther, a statistical analysis of the 1992 admissions data supports the defendants' assertion of the non-race\nbased weaknesses in the plaintiffs' applications. D-338 at A-60-A-71.\n\nThe plaintiffs placed in evidence a chart created by the law school that depicts the TIs of all 1992 applicants and\nwhether they were offered or denied admission. See P-139. The chart distinguishes minority and nonminority\n[79]\napplicants, as well as residents and nonresidents.  The chart emphasizes the disparity in TIs between resident\nminority and nonminority applicants: the highest nonminority TI was 220, the highest black TI was 199 (the same\nas Hopwood's TI), and the highest Mexican American TI was 208. In the resident nonminority category, of fifty-\none applicants with TIs of 199, six were denied admission. Additionally, the law school denied admission to ten\nnonminorities with TIs higher than Hopwood's TI. With regard to minority applicants with TIs of 199, the chart\nshows one black applicant, who was admitted, and three Mexican American applicants, all who were admitted.\n[80]\n With regard to a TI of 197, the TI shared by the other three plaintiffs, of fifty-seven resident nonminority\napplicants, the law school denied admission to nineteen. Only one black resident fell in this category, who was\nadmitted. No Mexican-American applicants had a TI of 197.\nOn the other end of the scale, out of four black resident applicants with a TI of 185, one was denied admission.\nHowever, the law school offered admission to one nonminority resident with the same TI. Applicants with the\n581 lowest TI offered admission were all minorities.[81] However, the lowest nonminority *581 TI was only a couple of\npoints higher at 185.\nThere are many possible methods of evaluating the numbers on the chart and making comparisons of the\napplicants' relative TIs. The plaintiffs placed the chart in evidence to show their numerical standing above that of\nthe majority of minorities offered admission. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs that the chart shows a significant\ndisparity in TIs between the minority and nonminority pools. But the visual depiction of this disparity further\nreinforces the Court's finding that the evaluation of applicants must include other nonobjective factors to achieve\nthe compelling governmental interest of overcoming the past effects of discrimination.\nWhat the chart does not prove, however, is that race or ethnic origin was the reason behind the denial of\nadmission to the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs had higher TIs than the majority of minority applicants offered\nadmission, the evidence shows that 109 nonminority residents with TIs lower than Hopwood's were offered\n[82] [83]\nadmission.  Sixty-seven nonminority residents with TIs lower than the other three plaintiffs were admitted.\nAdditionally, the Court has reviewed the files of the four plaintiffs as well as the files placed in evidence of other\napplicants reviewed in the discretionary zone, both minority and nonminority. P-146 to P-150, P-155 to P-164\n(white applicants admitted); P-224 to P-237 (black and Mexican American applicants admitted). Based on the\napplications in evidence, it appears the majority of applicants, both minority and nonminority, made considerable\neffort to inform the admissions committee of their special qualifications through extensive answers to the\nquestions on the application form or through personal statements. See P-146 to P-150, P-155 to P-163, P-225 to\nP-237. Most files contained one, if not several, letters of recommendation. See, e.g., P-155, 157, 158, 161, 225,\n231, 233-236. In fact, of all the applications the Court reviewed, Hopwood's provides the least information about\nher background and individual qualifications and is the least impressive in appearance, despite her relatively high\nnumbers. The files further reveal that both minorities and nonminorities were offered admission from the waiting\nlists. See P-146, 148, 156, 158, 162 (nonminority); P-231, 285 (minority).\nIn reviewing these files, the Court appreciates the difficulty of the task facing the admissions committee each\nyear. Evaluation of applications involves both objective and subjective factors, and the Court is aware that some\nevaluators could use subjectivity to conceal discriminatory motives. As a general rule, however, judges are not as\nwell suited to evaluate qualifications of applicants as those who are familiar with the process and have many\nyears of experience evaluating applications. See Odom v. Frank, 3 F.3d 839, 847 (5th Cir.1993). The Court's\nreview revealed a group of applicants with varying backgrounds and accomplishments, but none so clearly better\n[84]\nqualified, in the Court's view, as to require that individual's selection over that of another in the group.  The\nCourt sees no disparities in the applications of the admitted minorities when compared to those of the plaintiffs\n\"so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap [the Court] in the face.\" Id. Without such a disparity, the\nCourt cannot and will not substitute its views for those of admission committee members with years of experience\nand expertise in evaluating the law school applications. See id.\n\nTherefore, the Court finds the defendants have met the burden of producing credible evidence that legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory grounds exist for the law school's denial of admission to each of the four plaintiffs and that, in\nall likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have been offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible\n582 process. The plaintiffs, who maintain the ultimate burden *582 of persuasion, have failed to prove otherwise.[85]\nThe Court simply cannot find from a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs would have been offered\nadmission under a constitutional system.\nThe Court is mindful that the ultimate burden on the plaintiffs is a difficult and, perhaps, almost impossible\n[86]\nobstacle to overcome in a case of this nature.  However, the Court may not ignore the precedent of other\nconstitutional cases because, as a practical matter, the burden may be too difficult for plaintiffs to overcome.\nE. Relief and Damages\nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and exemplary damages. Because\nthe Court has found the admission procedure the law school used in 1992 was not narrowly tailored in that it\nimpermissibly and unnecessarily harmed the rights of the plaintiffs, the Court will enter a judgment providing the\nplaintiffs with their requested declaratory relief. Specifically, the Court will enter judgment that the law school's\nuse of the separate evaluative processes for minority and nonminority applicants in the discretionary zone\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment.\nHowever, \"the right to equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution is not coextensive with any substantive\nrights to the benefits denied the party discriminated against.\" Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739, 104 S.Ct.\n1387, 1395, 79 L.Ed.2d 646 (1984). As discussed above, the Court cannot find from a preponderance of the\nevidence that the plaintiffs would have been admitted under a constitutional system. The Court, therefore, will not\norder injunctive relief. Nor does the Court find prospective injunctive relief necessary in light of the law school's\nvoluntary change to a procedure, which on paper and from the testimony, appears to remedy the defects the\n[87]\nCourt has found in the 1992 procedure.  Further, neither a plaintiff denied admission under the new system\nnor evidence of the practical application of the new procedure is before this Court.\nAlthough the plaintiffs have failed to prove an injury-in-fact, they have proved they were deprived of their right to\n583 equal treatment. The appropriate relief for a denial of equal treatment in a discriminatory government *583\n[88]\nprogram is a remedy mandating equal treatment.  Therefore, the Court finds it appropriate to allow the\nplaintiffs to reapply to the law school for admission in the 1995 entering class, if they so desire, without requiring\nthem to incur further administrative costs, and for them to be fairly evaluated in comparison to all other applicants\n[89]\nfor admission in 1995.\nIn addition, though the plaintiffs did not prove they suffered any other actual injury, the Court will not ignore the\ngravity of the noneconomic injury to persons denied equal treatment. Therefore, although normally assessed in\nthe context of procedural due-process violations, the Court believes this to be an appropriate case for the\nassessment of nominal damages:\nBy making the deprivation of such rights actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual\ninjury, the law recognizes the importance to organized society that those rights be scrupulously\nobserved; but at the same time, it remains true to the principle that substantial damages should be\nawarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case of exemplary or punitive damages, to\ndeter or punish malicious deprivations of rights.\nCarey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. at 266, 98 S.Ct. at 1054. The Court, therefore, will award each plaintiff nominal\ndamages of one dollar.\nWith regard to general monetary damages, the evidence at trial consisted of each plaintiff's testimony and\n[90]\nspeculation about the value of a law degree.  Because the plaintiff's have failed to establish that they would\nhave been admitted under a constitutional system, they are not entitled to these damages. Further, had the\n\nplaintiffs been entitled to damages, none of them established monetary damages as required under the law and\nrules of this circuit. See Haley v. Pan American World Airways, 746 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir.1984) (\"A damage\naward cannot stand when the only evidence to support it is speculative or purely conjectural.\"). Finally, the Court\nwould not award Title VI damages even were such damages appropriate because the Court does not believe the\ndefendants intended to discriminate against the plaintiffs in an unlawful manner. See Carter v. Orleans Parish\nPub. Schs., 725 F.2d 261, 264 (5th Cir.1984) (recovery of damages under Title VI precluded unless action\nintentional or manifested discriminatory animus); Marvin H. v. Austin Indep. Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 1348, 1356-57\n(5th Cir.1983) (same). Indeed, the evidence reflects the contrary. The defendants acted in good faith and made\nsincere efforts to follow federal guidelines and to redress past discrimination. The record contains no evidence\nthat the defendants intended to discriminate against or to harm the plaintiffs. Under these facts, an award of\ndamages, especially the punitive damages the plaintiffs request, would be inappropriate.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIt is regrettable that affirmative action programs are still needed in our society. However, until society sufficiently\novercomes the effects of its lengthy history of pervasive racism, affirmative action is a necessity. Further,\nalthough no one likes employing racial classifications and distinctions, \"it would be impossible to arrange an\naffirmative action program in a racially neutral way and have it successful.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 407, 98 S.Ct. at\n2808 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n584 *584 Commitment to affirmative action programs in educational institutions as just and necessary, however, does\nnot imply that the individual rights of nonminorities should fall by the wayside or be ignored. The concern for\nindividual rights requires that programs implementing racial and ethnic preferences be subjected to the most\nsearching judicial examination of strict scrutiny. Only by applying strict scrutiny can the judicial branch assure\nsociety that the important individual rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment have not been unnecessarily\nand unfairly burdened solely as a function of the color of an individual's skin. The judicial branch must carefully\nand honestly assess the harm to those individual rights in light of the compelling interests served and benefit\nbestowed upon society by the affirmative action program. To do otherwise would do little more than, in the words\nof Justice Kennedy, move us from \"separate but equal\" to \"unequal but benign.\" Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at\n638, 110 S.Ct. at 3047 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).\nFurther, if we wish to progress to a society in which affirmative action is no longer necessary, we must be\ncognizant of pitfalls and dangers created by affirmative action in the form of the stigma some associate with racial\npreferences and the potential institutionalization of a process that was designed to overcome institutionalized\ndiscrimination. The interests of all require that the government not diminish the importance of individual rights,\nwhether belonging to a minority citizen or a nonminority citizen, through programs, that although well-intentioned,\nunwittingly \"permit the seeds of race hate to be planted under sanction of law.\" Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537,\n560, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1147, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\nThe Court realizes that some individuals will continue to complain that any admissions program employing\npreferences based on race, no matter how carefully designed and administered to provide individualized\nconsideration, deprives nonminorities of their rights. However, when the program functions to overcome the\neffects of years of discrimination and to serve important societal goals, affirmative action \"is consistent with equal\nprotection principles as long as it does not impose undue burdens on nonminorities.\" Metro Broadcasting, 497\nU.S. at 597, 110 S.Ct. at 3026. The Court believes the only way of assuring an undue burden is not placed on\ninnocent parties in an admissions procedure is to treat all applicants as individuals and to consider all\nqualifications in selecting the best qualified candidates to comprise an entering class. Using the color of an\napplicant's skin to limit the degree of individual comparison between the races neither serves societal goals nor\n[91]\nsufficiently protects individual rights under our Constitution.\nJudgment will be issued consistent with the Court's findings in this opinion.\n\nFINAL JUDGMENT\nBE IT REMEMBERED on the 19th day of August 1994, the Court entered its memorandum opinion consisting of\nits findings of fact and conclusions of law in the above-captioned matter and, consistent with those findings and\nconclusions, enters the following judgment:\nIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED, by declaratory judgment, that the 1992\nadmissions procedure of the law school at the University of Texas at Austin, as administered, was\n585 in violation of the *585 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution;\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Cheryl J. Hopwood, Douglas W.\nCarvell, Kenneth R. Elliott, and David A. Rogers shall be entitled to reapply for admission to the\nlaw school at the University of Texas at Austin for the 1995-96 school year without further\nadministrative expense or fees and that their applications shall be reviewed by the admissions\ncommittee of the law school at the University of Texas at Austin along with all other applications\nfor that school year;\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Cheryl J. Hopwood, Douglas W.\nCarvell, Kenneth R. Elliott, and David A. Rogers do have and recover judgment of and against the\ndefendants University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas School of Law, jointly and\nseverally, in the total amount of One Dollar ($1.00) each;\nIT IS FINALLY, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that all further affirmative relief\nrequested by any party herein against any other party herein is DENIED.\n[1] Defendants Bernard Rapopart, Ellen C. Temple, Lowell H. Lebermann, Jr., Robert Cruikshank, Thomas O.\nHicks, Zan W. Holmes, Jr., Tom Loeffler, Mario E. Ramirez, and Martha E. Smiley are sued in their official\ncapacities as members of the University of Texas Board of Regents. Defendant University of Texas Board of\nRegents is the governmental entity created by Defendant State of Texas to administer the operation of the\nUniversity of Texas system, which includes Defendant University of Texas at Austin as a component institution.\nDefendant University of Texas School of Law is an American Bar Association accredited law school operated by\nthe University of Texas at Austin. Defendant Robert M. Berdahl is sued in his official capacity as president of the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. Defendant Mark G. Yudof is currently Provost of the University of Texas at Austin. At\nall times pertinent to this lawsuit, Yudof was Dean of the University of Texas School of Law and is sued in that\nofficial capacity. Defendant Stanley M. Johanson, a Professor of Law, is sued in his official capacity as Chair of\nthe University of Texas School of Law Admissions Committee.\n[2] The plaintiffs' Title VI, § 1981, and § 1983 claims serve as vehicles to enforce underlying rights guaranteed by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the law school's admissions program must be evaluated under the equal-\nprotection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n[3] In 1990, the percentage of persons age 25 or older who completed high school was 81.5% non-Hispanic\nwhite, 66.1% black, and 44.6% Hispanic. D-411. College graduate rates for the same year reflect 25.2% non-\nHispanic whites, 12% black, and 7.3% Hispanic. D-412.\n[4] The Texas Legislature created Prairie View State Normal & Industrial College for Colored Teachers at Prairie\nView (now Prairie View A & M University) for the education of \"students to be taken from the colored population of\nthis State.\" Wright, vol. 19, at 17, 19-21. Until 1947, it remained the only state-supported institution of higher\nlearning open to black students in Texas; no type of professional training was available to blacks. Commentary,\nTex. Const. art. VII, § 14 (West 1993). In 1947, to avoid integration of the University of Texas, the Texas\nLegislature created the Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University). Id. at 21-22; D-382.\n[5]See Adams v. Richardson, 356 F.Supp. 92 (D.D.C.), modified and aff'd,480 F.2d 1159 (D.C.Cir.1973),\ndismissed sub nom. Women's Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 906 F.2d 742 (D.C.Cir.1990). \n\nTitle VI proscribes discrimination that violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See \nRegents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 286-87, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2746-2747, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978). The\nprohibitions against discriminatory conduct contained in Title VI govern \"program[s] or activit[ies] receiving\nFederal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000d. Thus, \"Congress was legislating to assure federal funds\nwould not be used in an improper manner.\" United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 206 n. 6, 99 S.Ct. 2721,\n2729 n. 6, 61 L.Ed.2d 480 (1979). The University of Texas, as a recipient of Title VI funds, is required to comply\nwith Title VI.\nThe Department of Education, as the successor agency to HEW, is the governmental agency charged with the\nenforcement of Title VI and the review of programs funded through the DOE. The DOE has promulgated\nregulations to implement the provisions of Title VI, including regulations providing for affirmative action in certain\ncircumstances. The regulations state that \"[i]n administering a program regarding which the recipient has\npreviously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take\naffirmative action to overcome the effects of the prior discrimination.\" 45 C.F.R. § 80.3(b)(6)(i) (1993). The\nregulations state further that even if a recipient has never implemented discriminatory policies, if its services and\nbenefits have not been equally available to some racial or nationality groups, the recipient may \"establish special\nrecruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other\nsteps to provide that group with more adequate service.\" 45 C.F.R. § 80.5(j).\n[6] D-314. The revised plan raised the goal previously set for increased minority enrollment in graduate and\nprofessional schools. The individual goal for UT-Austin had been ten additional black students and two additional\nHispanic students. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 26-27; vol. 13 at 56-58. The revised plan included a commitment to \"seek\nto achieve proportions of black and Hispanic Texas graduates from undergraduate institutions in the State who\nenter graduate study or professional schools in the State at least equal to the proportion of white Texas graduates\nfrom undergraduate institutions in the State who enter such programs.\" D-238a at. 5.\n[7]Ashworth, vol. 12 at 32-24. The government, as usual, proceeds with \"all deliberate speed.\"\n[8]Johanson, vol. 3 at 12. Ernest Smith, who was a member of the admissions committee from 1965 through\n1970 and dean of the law school from 1974 to 1979, testified by deposition that his recall of the required grade\npoint average at that time was 3.0. Smith depo. at 7. Although neither Smith nor Johanson had exact recall of the\nnumber, their testimony is consistent in that the qualifications for admission at the time were minimal.\n[9] The Texas Index is a composite number calculated by the Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS) that\nreflects an applicant's grade point average and LSAT score. The weight attributed to each component of the TI is\ndetermined by a prediction formula derived from the success of first year students in preceding years. Johanson,\nvol. 3 at 7-10.\n[10] The CLEO (Council on Legal Education Opportunity) program provided summer training at participating law\nschools for minority graduates of various universities. At the end of the training period, the CLEO participants\nwere given exams. Based on their performance on those exams, some of the participants were admitted to the\nlaw school. Smith depo. at 9-10.\n[11] The committee was named after the chair of the committee, Professor James Treece.\n[12] In the summer of 1974, just before Ernest Smith became dean of the law school, the then president of the\nuniversity, Steve Spurr, expressed concern about the low minority population in the law school. Spurr indicated\nthat a public university had an obligation to train a reasonably representative cross-section of the population in\nthe law and that the TI, as the focus of the admissions procedure, did not adequately account for an applicant's\nability to overcome past economic, cultural, and discriminatory practices. Smith depo. at 17.\n[13]Johanson, vol. 3 at 15. Professor Johanson did not recall if any of the members of the Treece committee\nwere also members of the regular admissions committee.\n[14] During this time, the law school entering class was comprised of 500 students, and no more than 10% of the\nstudents could be nonresidents. Johanson, vol. 3 at 17.\n\n[15] The law school's procedure differed from the Bakke procedure in that no fixed number of seats were set\naside for minorities and some nonminorities were evaluated by the Treece committee. P-1 (Smith memo at 3).\n[16] Professor Johanson testified the system used five bands, while Professor Wellborn testified there were six\nbands.\n[17] Evidently, sometime between 1978 and 1991, the automatic or administrative admission line was changed to\na presumptive admission line. The testimony is unclear as to when this occurred and, apparently, even after the\nchange was made, those involved with the admissions procedure continued to make reference to automatic\nadmission. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26, 66; see also id. at 29 (\"I think we used the term `automatic admit' for a long\nperiod of time, when it became part of the colloquium but did not describe the process.\"). Dean Sutton, who\nsucceeded Dean Smith and was dean from 1979 to 1984, established the rule that approximately 55% of the\nresident class should fall within the presumptive admission category. Johanson, vol. 3 at 24-25. Approximately\n75% of nonresident applicants are admitted from the presumptive admission category for nonresidents. Id.\n[18] Because the law school was receiving better qualified minority applicants, the focus of the process changed\nfrom whether to accept a particular minority applicant to a more selective process between the individual minority\napplicants. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 33. Had the admissions committee continued to apply its previous standards, the\nnumber of minorities in the entering class would have continued to grow. However, the committee elected instead\nto \"take advantage of this opportunity to have more excellent minority students than we had before, who would\nbe more competitive with the non-minority students, but perhaps in more limited numbers that would still\nconstitute reasonable representation.\" Id. at 35.\n[19] P-25. The percentage goals are based on the percentages of minority college graduates. See supra note 6.\n[20] Professor Johanson, who is white, has been on the admissions committee since 1964 and chair of the\ncommittee since 1973. Dean Aleman is an assistant dean and is Mexican American. Dean Hamilton was an\nassistant dean from 1990 through 1993 and is black.\n[21] At some point in the process, the presumptive admission line for nonminority resident admissions was\nadjusted downward to ensure that approximately 55% of the resident admissions would be presumptively\nadmitted. The 55/45 split did not apply to nonresident applicants, approximately 75% of whom were admitted\npresumptively on the basis of their TI. See supra note 17.\n[22]Johanson, vol. 3 at 26. In 1992, the law school received approximately 2100 resident applications and 2300\nnonresident applications. Johanson, vol. 3 at 35. The pool of nonresident applicants was very strong, many with\ncredentials well above those of the presumptively admitted residents. Id. at 36. Accordingly, the presumptive\nadmission and denial scores were set at a higher level for nonresident applicants. However, as with resident\napplicants, lower scores were set for Mexican American and black nonresident applicants than for nonminority\nnonresident applicants. \nJohanson testified the enrollment yield for nonresidents is approximately 26%, meaning that the law school has\nto offer approximately four nonresidents admission to enroll one. Id. at 37. The enrollment yield for residents is 66\nto 68%, that is, for every 100 offers of admission, 66 to 68 resident applicants accept.\n[23] Johanson reviewed minority and nonminority files together as a group during the preliminary review process. \nJohanson, vol. 6 at 55.\n[24] Johanson's setting of these scores was a process that evolved over the course of the admissions process\nbased on the pool of applicants, the number of offers, and the number of acceptances. Initially, the numbers were\nset high and lowered as the yield from offers and composition of the entering class began to develop. Johanson,\nvol. 5, at 10-11; P-38 00 P-44.\n97\n[25] P-38. In 1992, the law school was faced with two different types of TIs, one based on a two digit LSAT score\nand one based on a three digit LSAT score. This was a result of the change in the scaling of the LSAT from a 10-\nto-48 scale to a 120-to-180 scale. Johanson therefore had to set presumptive lines coordinated to two separate\nTI formulas to accommodate the two types of TIs received for applicants. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26-27.\n\n[26] In 1992, the admissions committee reviewed 18 stacks in the nonminority discretionary zone 00 17 stacks of\n97\n30 files and one stack of 16 files. P-58, P-59. This process began in early March and was virtually complete by\nmid to late April. Johanson (by depo.), vol. 25 at 7.\n[27] In 1992, Johanson allotted each person on the subcommittees nine votes per stack. D-332 at A-29.\nCommittee members were required to screen five stacks. P-55. Therefore, although each member of the\nadmissions committee reviewed more than one stack of files, no individual reviewed all the files in the\ndiscretionary zone.\n[28] Johanson testified that he had \"rarely, if ever\" vetoed a committee recommendation based on two or three\nvotes, except in instances where an administrative problem might make an individual ineligible for law school.\n[29] Johanson, in rebuttal testimony provided by deposition, testified, \"[T]hose candidates who receive zero votes\nto admit, they're done. I don't even look at their files. Three people have said in comparison to our applicant pool\nthey are not worthy of being admitted. They will 00 the next day they will get their denial....\" Johanson (by depo.),\n97\nvol. 25 at 10 (emphasis added). This testimony contradicts the statement in the law school's \"Statement of Policy\non Affirmative Action,\" which states that all final decisions on each applicant file are made by Johanson. See\nD-362 at 4.\n[30] Both Johanson and Hamilton attended all the meetings; Aleman's attendance was not regular. Frequently,\nstudent members of the subcommittee attended the meetings, although they were not voting members of the\nsubcommittee. Johanson, vol. 5 at 28-29.\n[31] Johanson testified that, although a \"particularly naughty problem\" might be brought before the entire\ncommittee, almost all final decisions were made by the subcommittee. Johanson, vol. 5 at 29; see also\nJohanson, vol. 6 at 47.\n[32] The law school received 4,494 applications for the fall 1992 incoming class. It offered admission to 936\napplicants to fill a class of slightly over 500 students. D-447 (Aff. of Rita Bohr at A-4). The overall median GPA for\nentering students was 3.52, and the overall median LSAT was 162 (89th percentile). D-433. The median figures\nfor nonminorities were a GPA of 3.56 and an LSAT of 164 (93rd percentile); for blacks, a GPA of 3.30 and an\nLSAT of 158 (78th percentile); and for Mexican Americans, a GPA of 3.24 and an LSAT of 157 (75%). Id.\n[33]Johanson, vol. 4 at 9, 31. The percentage of nonresidents that may comprise an entering class has recently\nbeen increased to 20%. Johanson, vol. 4 at 46.\n[34] Nevertheless, Hamilton, as assistant dean of admissions responsible for recruiting the law school class,\nactively recruited minority students through \"one-on-one\" discussions and scholarship enticements. Hamilton, vol.\n2 at 4-5, 9, 12-13.\n[35] The practice of using the GPA/LSAT index as a sorting mechanism is used by many nationally prominent law\nschools. Brest, vol. 22 at 13-14; Stein, Vol. 18 at 15; Bollinger, vol. 16 at 11-14; Wegner depo. at 9-10. However,\nnone rely on the index as the sole basis for admission decisions. Id.; see also D-448.\n[36] The defendants contend that Hopwood should have been evaluated as a nonresident and, accordingly,\nwould not have been in the presumptive admit range for nonresidents. However, Johanson testified that\nHopwood did not misrepresent her status to the law school. She stated in her application she was married to a\nperson in the military who was stationed in Texas at the time of her application. The law school treated her\napplication as that of a resident throughout the process. Johanson, vol. 5 at 14. Further, Hopwood's residency\nclassification was consistent with the law school's policies in effect at the time. Id.; Johanson, vol. 4 at 44-45; \nHopwood, vol. 8 at 12-13.\n[37] Hopwood's LSAT score placed her in the 83rd percentile, well below the median LSAT for nonminorities in\nthe 1992 entering class. P-145; D-433. Her two-digit TI was an 87, which correlates to 199 in the three-digit\nscoring system.\n\n[38] Hopwood testified that although her child was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she has been found to\nhave an extremely rare muscle disease and is severely handicapped. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 8-9. This information is\nnot included in her admission file.\n[39] Hopwood testified that although she had been prepared to submit letters of recommendation, a person in the\nadmissions office informed her that, because of the large number of applications, the school did not have time to\nlook at recommendations. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 6.\n[40] Hopwood testified that while in high school, she applied for college at Temple, Princeton, and Penn State and\nwas offered admission at each school. However, because she had to pay for her own education and had to work\nher way through school, she could not afford to go to these schools. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 4. However, this\ninformation is not included in Hopwood's application despite the following statement on the application: \"Please\nmake any other comments about your college transcripts or your preparation for college (such as disadvantaged\neducational or economic background) that you believe will help the Admissions Committee in evaluating your\napplication.\"\n[41]Johanson, vol. 5 at 14-17. Johanson believed that Hopwood's ability to work a significant number of hours\nwhile maintaining a high GPA was indicative of earning her GPA while on \"a fairly slow track\" at a non-competitive\ninstitution. Id. at 15-16. In contrast, Associate Dean Sharlot found that Hopwood's achievement of a high GPA\nwhile working was a \"definite plus.\" D-334. This \"plus,\" however, was insufficient to overcome Hopwood's below-\nmedian performance on the LSAT and attendance at a series of \"very weak schools.\" Id.\n[42] Hopwood received one vote from Hamilton, who was also a member of the minority subcommittee. P-217\n(Answer to int. 4); D-333 at A-37.\n[43] The Court notes that during 1992, individuals were offered admission from the waiting list. Of the 332\napplicants offered a position on the waiting list in 1992, 75 were admitted. D-447 (Aff. of Rita Bohr at A-5).\nHamilton testified that as late as the first week of classes, seven persons were admitted from the waiting list.\nHamilton, vol. 2 at 65-67. However, the Court also notes from the affidavits of Johanson and Hamilton that\nHopwood had little likelihood of acceptance from a waiting list. In fact, Hamilton specifically stated, \"It is my belief\nthat Ms. Hopwood [would] not have been admitted off the waiting list at a later time.\" D-333 at A-39.\n[44] P-165. The only copy of the letter in the record is an unsigned draft provided by the plaintiffs. Hamilton\ntestified that the letter actually received by the law school had been administratively misplaced since the summer\nof 1992. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 68-69.\n[45]Id. Johanson testified it was \"quite unusual\" for someone to be reconsidered and placed on the waiting list\nwithout Johanson's awareness of the decision. Johanson, vol. 5 at 19-21. He testified he knew nothing about\nElliott being placed on the waiting list. Id.\n[46] The Court is not implying that Hamilton testified in an untruthful manner. However, because of the number of\napplicant files Hamilton was required to address and the time pressures under which she was working as the\nbeginning of the school year approached, the Court believes it very possible her recall of the chronology of\nspecific events may be inaccurate.\n[47] Carvell's application reflects that he took the LSAT twice, receiving a score of 34 (61st percentile) the first\ntime and a score of 164 (91st percentile) the second time. The LSAT factored in his TI is an average of these two\nscores.\n[48] This matter was addressed at length in pretrial motions and hearings, and the transcripts and evidence\nrelated to those motions are evidence in this cause.\n[49] As discussed above, the defendants claim Hopwood voluntarily removed herself from the admissions\nprocess and Elliott was offered admission.\n[50] With regard to Elliott, the defendants contend he lacks standing to challenge the initial decision to deny him\nadmission.\n\n[51]See id. ___ U.S. at ___ - ___, 113 S.Ct. at 2302-03 (discussing Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 102\nS.Ct. 2836, 73 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982); Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733 (1978); and Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S.\n346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970)).\n[52] Further, the law school's 1992 procedure for review of applicants in the discretionary zone effectively\nprevents any nonminority candidate from establishing that he or she would have been admitted but for the\npreference given to minority applicants. See infra note 86.\n[53] The defendants also contend a suit against the State of Texas or the University of Texas is an impermissible\ncollateral attack on OCR programs and regulations and, in support of this proposition, cite Milwaukee County\nPavers Ass'n v. Fiedler, 922 F.2d 419 (7th Cir.),cert. denied,500 U.S. 954, 111 S.Ct. 2261, 114 L.Ed.2d 714\n(1991). However, in this cause the plaintiffs are not attempting to challenge a federal statute creating minority\nbusiness set-asides by challenging the State's role in the program. Instead, the plaintiffs in this cause are\nchallenging the specific procedure the law school voluntarily designed and implemented to achieve affirmative\naction goals suggested by OCR. The constitutionality of the law school's procedure is not dependent on whether\nthe OCR can require affirmative remedies for a Title VI violation. See Podberesky v. Kirwan, 764 F.Supp. 364,\n374 (D.Md.1991),rev'd and remanded,956 F.2d 52 (4th Cir.1992),on remand,838 F.Supp. 1075 (D.Md.1993).\n[54] As an additional point, even if the Court were to find intermediate scrutiny to be the proper standard of\nreview, the Court would still be required to assess whether the process imposed undue burdens on nonminorities.\nSee Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 596-97, 110 S.Ct. at 3026 (\"[A] congressionally mandated benign race-\nconscious program that is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental interest is\nconsistent with equal protection principles so long as it does not impose undue burdens on nonminorities.\"). As\ndiscussed infra pp. 575-579, the burden imposed upon nonminorities by the law school's admissions procedure is\na very troubling aspect of the process and, ultimately, in this Court's view, renders the process constitutionally\nimpermissible.\n[55] This written articulation of the purposes and policy of the law school's affirmative action program and\ndescription of the 1992 process was prepared in February 1994. Johanson, vol. 6 at 45-46; Yudof, vol. 20 at\n30-31.\n[56] Notwithstanding the personal views of this judge, it appears the goal of increasing the number of minority\nmembers in the legal profession and judiciary of Texas is not a legally sufficient reason to justify racial\npreferences under fourteenth amendment analysis. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 496-98, 109 S.Ct. at 723-24.\nFurther, the desires and goals of a private entity such as the ABA or AALS, though important considerations for\nan accredited law school, do not provide sufficient justification for racial classifications. Similarly, Texas' \"consent\ndecree\" with the OCR, though having evidentiary value in terms of past discrimination in Texas' higher education\nsystem, is not, in and of itself, a valid justification.\n[57] The plaintiffs do contend the law school's affirmative action program is not narrowly tailored to meet the\nobjective of diversity, an issue the Court will address below.\n[58] In support of this proposition, the defendants cite Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at 722 (\"Unless [racial\nclassifications] are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and\nlead to politics of racial hostility.\"), and dissenting opinions from Metro Broadcasting and Johnson v.\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara, California. See Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 613-15, 110 S.Ct. at 3035\n(O'Connor, J., dissenting); Johnson, 480 U.S. 616, 673-75, 107 S.Ct. 1442, 1473-1474, 94 L.Ed.2d 615 (Scalia,\nJ., dissenting).\n[59] The Supreme Court recognized the vital role education plays in our society in Brown v. Board of Education:\n[Education] is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument for awakening the child to\ncultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his\nenvironment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is\ndenied the opportunity of an education.\n\nBrown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954).\n[60] D-441. The Court believes such meager representation would be woefully inadequate in a state university\nsupported, in part, by revenues from all state residents. Further, the Court concurs with the defendants that\ndiversity requires more than token representation of minorities; strict reliance on the TIs for admission would not\nfurther the goal of diversity.\n[61] The plaintiffs' expert, James Armor, a senior fellow at the Institute of Public Policy, George Mason University,\nin Fairfax, Virginia, testified there are no present direct effects of past discrimination in Texas' educational system.\nArmor, vol. 10 at 45-48. Armor testified the only cities in Texas he has visited are Dallas and Houston. Armor, vol.\n11 at 41. The Court does not find Armor to be a credible witness.\n[62]See also Ayers v. Allain, 893 F.2d 732, 751 (5th Cir.1990): \nBrown states that the stigmatizing effects of segregation are not created by legally compelled attendance but\nrather from the vestiges of legally compelled separation. Thus the lesson of Brown is that the malignancy of\napartheid does not vanish in state-sponsored forums simply because attendance is voluntary and admittance\nrace-neutral.\n[63]See, e.g., League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 866 (5th Cir.1993),cert. denied,\n___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 878, 127 L.Ed.2d 74 (1994) (\"Texas' long history of discrimination against its black and\nHispanic citizens in all areas of public life is not the subject of dispute....\").\n[64]Hamilton, vol. 2 at 49-50, 52-53; Wright, vol. 19 at 33-36. Sweatt v. Painter is often studied in undergraduate\ncourses and contributes to undergraduate minorities' perception of the University of Texas as an institution that\ndoes not welcome minorities. Wright, vol. 19 at 33-36; Romo, vol. 17 at 64.\n[65] The plaintiffs contend the OCR's findings are invalid because the OCR did not apply the standards recently\nset forth by the Supreme Court in Fordice. However, neither the validity of the OCR investigation, nor the\nretroactive application of Fordice is the issue before this Court.\n[66]Ashworth, vol. 12 at 44-45; D-432; D-453; D-454. In 1971, the year following the Board of Regents\ndisapproval of the law school's participation in the CLEO program, the law school entering class had no blacks.\nAs late as 1974 only ten of the law school's 1600 students were black. Wright, vol. 19 at 31-33. Texas Southern\nUniversity, the law school Texas created to avoid integration of the law school, enrolls almost 50% of all entering\nminority law students in Texas. This percentage would increase dramatically in the absence of the law school's\naffirmative action program. Wright, vol. 19 at 21-22; Ashworth, vol. 12 at 44-45; D-432; D-452; D-453.\n[67] The admissions data from 1983 to 1993 reflects the following minority admissions, both in percentages and\nactual numbers of students: \nYear        Black       Mexican American\n1983       9.3 (47)         10.0 (51)\n1984       6.2 (32)         14.3 (74)\n1985       4.6 (25)         11.2 (61)\n1986       4.4 (24)         13.1 (71)\n1987       3.2 (17)         10.2 (55)\n1988       7.0 (44)         10.7 (60)\n1989       6.0 (35)         11.4 (58)\n1990       7.1 (39)         11.6 (64)\n1991       6.9 (35)         10.6 (54)\n1992       8.0 (41)         10.7 (55)\n1993       5.9 (31)         10.0 (53)\nD-71.\n\n[68] The law school maintains racially segregated \"wait lists,\" which the plaintiffs contend the law school uses to\nadjust the racial composition of the incoming class to meet its goals. However, the evidence at trial showed that\nthere is no \"last seat,\" as in Bakke, for which an applicant's race is the deciding factor. See, e.g., Johanson, vol. 4\nat 43.\n[69]See Goode, vol. 9 at 32 (\"My position on the committee for many years has been, we ought to work and\nstrive to decreasing the gap, little by little if we have to, but one day to the point where, in fact, we won't have\nsuch a gap, where we can truly have a race-blind system of admission. We're not there.\"); see also Wellborn, vol.\n24 at 35; P-1.\n[70] The evidence shows that the qualifications of minority applicants today are roughly equivalent to the\nqualifications of nonminority applicants 20 years ago. D-433. These figures demonstrate the progress that has\noccurred in the qualifications of minorities applying for law school. Glenn, vol. 23 at 52.\n[71] The use of different presumptive admission lines to identify the top candidates in the different groups does\nnot present the same problem for several reasons. First, the evidence shows that Johanson reviewed all\ncandidates in the top category, both minority and nonminority. Additionally, those applicants that were not offered\nadmission from this category were not denied admission but moved to the discretionary zone. Further, Johanson\ntestified to the necessity of making offers of admissions to the top candidates in the minority pools as soon as\npossible because of the small pool of qualified applicants and the nationwide competition for them. A tool that\nconsiders the disparity in past educational opportunity based on historical discrimination to assist in attracting the\ntop minorities does not create an undue burden on the rights of nonminorities when appropriately used.\nConversely, the use of differing presumptive denial lines effectively removed some nonminority applicants from\nconsideration early in the process without being provided a general, much less individual, comparison with a fully\ndeveloped pool of minority applicants. One or two separate reviewers from the general admissions committee\nunilaterally made determinations with regard to these applicants. However, none of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit\nwas affected directly by this aspect of the 1992 procedure. Further, the new admissions procedure adopted by\nthe law school will no longer use presumptive denial lines to preclude comparison of applicants. See infra note\n87. The Court, therefore, need not address the issue. If the issue were before the Court, the Court would find this\naspect of the procedure suffers from the same infirmity that use of the minority subcommittee created in the\ndiscretionary zone 00 lack of individual comparison between minority and nonminority applicants.\n97\n[72] The defendants imply that because the law school's affirmative action is fundamentally similar to that used at\nthe major law schools around the country, it is constitutional. The evidence, however, reflects that while there are\nsimilarities, the other programs differ significantly from that at issue in this cause. Judith Wegner, Dean of the\nUniversity of North Carolina School of Law, testified by deposition that the University of North Carolina School of\nLaw does not set separate presumptive admission and denial scores based on race, does not have waiting lists\nsegregated by race, and does not have separate committee review based on race. Wegner depo. at 48-49.\nRobert Stein, Dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, testified that the University of Minnesota uses\nmechanisms in the admissions procedure similar in function to those used by the law school. However, all\napplicants offered admission at the University of Minnesota, with the exception of those offered \"automatic\"\nadmission based on high indices, are ultimately reviewed by the full admissions committee. Stein, vol. 18 at 12.\nThe minority subcommittee does not have authority to admit applicants, only to recommend specific applicants to\nthe full committee. Stein, vol. 18 at 48. Paul Brest, Dean of the Stanford Law School, testified his school uses a\nsystem comparable to that used by the law school, with a single admissions chair who has ultimate discretion on\nall admissions. Brest, vol. 22 at 19. Instead of a using a minority subcommittee, Stanford has one person that\nreviews minority files and makes recommendations to the admissions chair. Id. at 8-19. Until recently, that person\nreviewed only minority files. However, as the result of a recent settlement with OCR, the person began reviewing\nsome nonminority files so that she would have a better sense of the entire pool of applicants and be able to make\nmore appropriate comparisons between the applicants. Id. at 39.\n[73] Additionally, the defendants assert that nothing in the case law following Bakke suggests that individual\ncomparison of files is required in an admissions process redressing past discrimination, and in fact, indications\nexist to the contrary. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 519, 109 S.Ct. at 735 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (narrow tailoring\nstandards should not be so strict as to chill state's ability to voluntarily eliminate results of past discriminatory\n\nactions); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 471, 106 S.Ct. 3019, 3047-48, 92 L.Ed.2d 344 (1986)\n(narrow tailoring does not require specific beneficiaries of affirmative action be victims of past discrimination). The\ndefendants assert that requiring a one-to-one comparison of over 4000 applicants a year would be incredibly\nburdensome. However, the Court finds no reason, when evaluating affirmative action in the educational context,\nthat the protection afforded individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment should change based on the\ngovernmental goal that is to be achieved. Further, the defendants, citing Bakke, have asserted diversity as a\nconstitutionally valid goal of the law school's affirmative action program. Bakke gives no indication that the\nburden to a school in implementing a constitutionally valid program should be considered as a reason to diminish\nthe need for individual comparison. Additionally, more recent case law has made it clear that administrative\nconvenience cannot support a finding that an affirmative action program is narrowly tailored to remedy the effects\nof past discrimination. Croson, 488 U.S. at 508, 109 S.Ct. at 729-730.\n[74] In addition to race, Justice Powell suggested \"[s]uch qualities could include exceptional personal talents,\nunique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a history of\novercoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other qualifications deemed important.\" 438\nU.S. at 318, 98 S.Ct. at 2762.\n[75] A nonminority applicant from a disadvantaged background, although offered admission to prestigious\ncolleges, who elects to attend less-prestigious schools for economic reasons but nonetheless performs well,\nseems to be penalized under the current system for not having financial means or opportunities commensurate\nwith other nonminorities dealt a different lot in life. Therefore, the affirmative action program, as applied in 1992,\nseems to have had the somewhat ironic effect of affecting the rights of less advantaged and, indeed, even\ndisadvantaged, nonminorities rather than the group of nonminorities as a whole.\n[76] The record shows that two of the plaintiffs' applications were reviewed by members of the minority\nsubcommittee who had familiarity with both pools of applicants, minority and nonminority. Initially, Johanson\nreviewed Hopwood's file early in the process before the entire pool of applications had developed. After he\nmoved her to the discretionary zone, a subcommittee of three that included Hamilton reviewed her file. Elliott's\nfile was reviewed by a subcommittee of three that included Johanson. Arguably, because Johanson and Hamilton\nhad familiarity with individual minority applicant files, the procedure as applied to these two plaintiffs was not\nimpermissible. However, because the other reviewers on the subcommittees had no familiarity with individual\nminority files, the Court finds the constitutional violation applies to all four plaintiffs. Additionally, the fact that\nthese plaintiffs were reviewed by persons familiar with the entire pool was an inadvertent effect of Johanson's\nand Hamilton's dual roles and the random shuffle of the files into reviewing stacks; it did not result from the\ndesign of the procedure.\n[77] The trial court in Bakke placed the burden of proof on Bakke. Therefore, although the court found the Davis\nprogram violated Bakke's fourteenth amendment rights, it denied him injunctive relief because he had failed to\nprove he would have been admitted in the absence of the impermissible program. On appeal, the Supreme Court\nof California, analogizing Bakke's situation to that of a plaintiff under Title VII, ruled that because Bakke\nestablished the university had discriminated against him, the burden of proof shifted to the university to prove that\nit would not have admitted him in the absence of the special admissions program. Bakke v. Regents of Univ. of\nCal., 18 Cal.3d 34, 132 Cal.Rptr. 680, 553 P.2d 1152, 1172 (1976). Because the university conceded its inability\nto carry the burden, the California court ordered Bakke's admission. Id. On review, the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States noted the burden shift but stated that because the university had not challenged that aspect of the\ndecision, the issue of the proper placement of the burden of proof was not before it for consideration. Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 280 n. 13, 98 S.Ct. at 2743 n. 13. At the end of his opinion, Justice Powell, affirming the injunction, noted\nthat remanding the case would serve no useful purpose in light of the university's concession that it could not\nmeet the burden imposed upon it by the burden shift. Id. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 2764. In distinguishing Bakke from \nMt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, Justice Powell noted that there was no question that race had been\nthe reason for Bakke's rejection and no record existed in Bakke that legitimate alternative grounds for the\nuniversity's decision existed. Id. at 320 n. 54; 98 S.Ct. at 2764 n. 54.\n[78] The court in Cohen held that the burden shift applicable to Title VII cases should not apply to Title IX cases, a\nstatute similar to Title VI. Among the reasons the court offered were the different scope and purpose of the two\n\nstatutes and the largely aspirational goal of Title IX in comparison to the peremptory goal of Title VII. 991 F.3d at\n902.\n[79] The Court has focused on the statistics for residents in this discussion. The Court notes the chart reflects\nacross-the-board higher numbers for nonresidents and correspondingly more difficult thresholds for admittance. \nOn the chart, \"D\" indicates denied, \"A\" indicates admitted, and \"C\" indicates cancelled. For purposes of\nevaluation of the numbers, applicants in the \"C\" category are counted as admissions because they were admitted\nbut cancelled the acceptance. See Johanson, vol. 6 at 16.\n[80] Two of the Mexican American applicants cancelled.\n[81] Of five black applicants with a TI of 183, the law school admitted three; of eleven Mexican American\napplicants, the law school admitted two (one cancelled).\n[82] Twenty-nine of these applicants canceled.\n[83] Thirteen of these applicants canceled.\n[84] The Court notes that several of the applicants, some of which, in the Court's opinion, were weaker\ncandidates, initially were denied admission but offered a position on the waiting list. They were offered admission\nrelatively late in the process from the waiting list.\n[85] In this cause, the plaintiffs' initial position was that any consideration of race in an admissions procedure is\nimproper. Upon the Court's indication that such a position was untenable under the law, the plaintiffs redirected\ntheir efforts to proving the law school improperly used race in the admissions process. However, the plaintiffs'\ncausation evidence consisted of a demonstration that many more minority students were admitted in 1992 than\nwould have been under a strictly race-blind process and that, had the plaintiffs been minorities, there was a high\nprobability they would have been offered admission. Johanson, vol. 5 at 37; vol. 6 at 18-19. This evidence,\nalthough proof of affirmative action, does not establish that the plaintiffs, who are not minorities, would have\nreceived sufficient votes to be offered admission if individual minority files had been reviewed by the general\nadmissions committee.\n[86] In closing argument, the plaintiffs' counsel stated the plaintiffs could not prove they were denied admission\nbecause of their race because it was an impossible burden to meet. T. Smith, vol. 26 at 11, 40. Justice Souter, in\nexpressing concern for Title VII plaintiffs with similar burdens, criticized the holding in St. Mary's as establishing a\nscheme, which, as a practical matter, could never be met by a plaintiff without direct evidence of discrimination. \nSt. Mary's, ___ U.S. at ___, 113 S.Ct. at 2761 (Souter, J., dissenting). \nThe Court agrees that the plaintiffs have an impossible burden absent direct evidence. However, the difficulty\ndoes not stem from the unconstitutional aspects of the procedure alone but from the random shuffle of files into\nstacks of thirty, with each stack reviewed by different subcommittees of three. Under such a system, it is virtually\nimpossible to establish the outcome of a comparison of the plaintiffs' applications against the other applicants,\nwhether minority or nonminority.\n[87] The law school followed the admissions procedure used in 1992 in 1993 and 1994. However, for selecting\nthe 1995 entering class, the law school has established a new procedure that eliminates the minority\nsubcommittee. D-363. All admissions decisions will be made by a small \"administrative admissions group,\" which\nwill be comprised of Johanson, Hamilton's successor, Dean Tonya Brown, and a faculty member who, as of the\ntrial date, had not been selected. The new procedure will not use presumptive admission and denial scores. \nJohanson, vol. 6 at 34. The law school changed its procedure because \"when one gets sued in federal court it\ncatches one's attention.\" Id. at 57.\n[88]See Heckler, 465 U.S. at 740, 104 S.Ct. at 1395. This remedy may be accommodated by an end to\npreferential treatment of others. Id. at n. 8. In the context of affirmative action, the Court interprets this to mean an\nend to unlawful preferential treatment of others.\n\n[89] Because plaintiff Carvell has taken advantage of the opportunity to obtain a legal education at SMU, this\naspect of the remedy may have little value to him. Carvell, in all probability, will be a practicing member of the bar\nlong before the other plaintiffs, if offered admission to the law school under a constitutional admissions\nprocedure, obtain law degrees.\n[90] Elliott testified he thought the median income for recent law school graduates was $57,000 per year. Elliott,\nvol. 7 at 30. Rogers had a somewhat less inflated concept, testifying the average first-year salary for a graduate\nfrom the law school was $52,000. Rogers also testified that the defendants had \"taken the top off my career\" and\nrequested some amount he could not quantify to compensate him for the loss. Rogers, vol. 11 at 67.\n[91] hand that rounded Peter's dome,/ And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,/ Wrought in a sad sincerity./ He\nbuilded better than he knew!\"\nThose who devised the Fourteenth Amendment wrought in grave sincerity. They may have builded better than\nthey knew.\nThey vitalized and energized a principle, as old and as everlasting as human rights. To some of them, the sunset\nof life may have given mystical lore.\nThey builded, not for a day, but for all time; not for a few, or for a race; but for man. They planted in the\nConstitution a monumental truth ... the golden rule.\nRoscoe Conkling, Oral Argument in County of San Mateo v.

STEWART, Circuit Judges:\n\nThis higher education, reverse racial discrimination case is before us on appeal for the third time. The first appeal\n(\"Hopwood I\") was interlocutory and affirmed the district court's denial of intervention sought by several minority\n261 rights advocacy organizations.[1] The second appeal (\"Hopwood II\") *261 followed the district court's judgment on\n[2]\nthe merits (\"Hopwood A\")  of the individual claims of Plaintiffs-Appellants-Cross-Appellees, Cheryl J. Hopwood\nand Douglas Carvell, and Plaintiffs-Appellees-Cross-Appellants, Kenneth Elliott and David Rogers (collectively,\nthe \"Plaintiffs\"), against Defendants-Appellees-Cross-Appellants-Cross-Appellees, The University of Texas at\nAustin (the \"University\"), the University of Texas School of Law (the \"Law School\"), and the State of Texas, the\nBoard of Regents of the University and its President, and the Dean and the Assistant Dean of the Law School\n[3]\n(collectively, \"Texas\"), grounded in the denial of the Plaintiffs' admission to the Law School.  Now, in \"Hopwood\nIII, 236 F.3d 256 (5th Cir.2000),\" each of the parties either appeals or cross-appeals one or more of the district\n[4]\ncourt rulings made at the conclusion of an extensive bench trial  conducted pursuant to our remand from \nHopwood II. As a broad generalization, three areas dealt with by the district court in Hopwood B are implicated in\nthis appeal: That court's (1) ultimate finding of fact that none of the Plaintiffs had a realistic chance of being\noffered admission to the Law School in 1992, even under a constitutionally valid, race-blind admissions program;\n(2) rulings on attorneys' fees; and (3) grant of an injunction prohibiting any consideration of race whatsoever in\nthe Law School's admissions process. In addition, Texas would have us disregard the law of the case doctrine\nand reverse the prior panel's decision in Hopwood II. We set forth below our reasons for affirming (1) the district\ncourt's factual findings that the Plaintiffs would not have been offered admission in 1992 under a race-blind\nsystem, and (2) that court's awards of attorneys' fees. We also express our reasons for declining to reconsider\nthe substance of Hopwood II, and for reversing the court's injunction against any consideration of race in the Law\nSchool's admission process and remanding that issue for further consistent proceedings.\nI.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURE\nIn Hopwood A, the case underlying the Hopwood II appeal, the district court held that the Plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that they would have been offered admission to the Law School\n[5]\nunder a constitutional admissions system.  On appeal, a panel of this court held that, under the burden-shifting\n[6]\nscheme of Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,  the Law School must bear the burden\nof proving by a preponderance of the evidence that, even under a race-blind admissions system, the Plaintiffs\n[7] [8]\nwould not have been offered admission.  The Hopwood II panel  stated that, \"[i]n the event that the law school\nis unable to show (by a preponderance of the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted\n262 to the law school under a constitutional admissions system, the court is to *262 award to that plaintiff any\n[9]\nequitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\"\nIn the spring of 1997, following remand from Hopwood II, the district court conducted a four-day bench trial. The\nLaw School called one expert witness on the question of causation, i.e., what caused the Plaintiffs to be denied\nadmission in 1992 and whether they would have been offered admission under a race-blind system. That witness\nwas Professor Olin Guy Wellborn, a faculty member of the Law School. He presented both a primary report and a\nsupplemental report analyzing whether the Plaintiffs would have been admitted under a constitutional, race-blind\nadmissions system, concluding that none of the four plaintiffs would have been. After considering Professor\nWellborn's reports and testimony, as well as the testimony of several members of the Law School's admissions\ncommittee and the Plaintiffs themselves, the district court found that the Law School had proved by a\npreponderance of the evidence that none of the Plaintiffs would have been admitted to the law school under a\n[10]\nconstitutional admissions system.\nThe district court nevertheless proceeded to make alternative factual findings and legal conclusions on the issue\nof damages. These would only be used in the event that the Plaintiffs should be successful in an appeal 00 this\n97\n\n[11]\nappeal 00 of the trial court's causation findings.  Finally, the district court entered a permanent injunction\n97\nprohibiting any consideration of race, for any purpose, in the Law School's admissions process.\nFollowing the initial trial of this action in Hopwood A, the Plaintiffs had requested an award of attorneys' fees\n[12]\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.  The district court denied the request, finding that the Plaintiffs, \"although\n[13]\nprevailing parties under the statute, only attained de minimis relief.\"  When the adverse rulings in Hopwood A\nwere appealed to us, we reversed and remanded the attorneys' fees issue with instructions for the district court to\n[14]\naward reasonable attorneys' fees.  Before the commencement of the Hopwood B bench trial on remand, the\ndistrict court entertained supplemental applications for attorneys' fees and made its final decision on the issue in\n[15]\nthe memorandum opinion resolving the matters raised at that trial.\nThe Plaintiffs sought $853,847.69 for their counsel in payment for 4,840.56 hours of work related to the May,\n1994 trial of Hopwood A. They also asked for $614,138.56 for their counsel in payment for 2400.85 hours of work\nrelated to the appellate phase of this litigation. The district court denied the portions of the fee request for time\nspent on (1) public and media relations, (2) opposing the attempted interventions by the Thurgood Marshall Legal\nSociety, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Mexican-American Legal\nDefense and Educational Fund, and (3) any legal work done after our remand in Hopwood II because the\n263 Plaintiffs were not prevailing *263 parties as to any issues resolved after that remand. The court reduced the\nnumber of hours spent for travel by one-half to reflect its judgment that travel should be billed at a lower rate than\nactive legal work, and reduced all hours submitted by the Plaintiffs' counsel by twenty-five percent to account for\n[16]\nduplicative work product and lack of billing judgment.  The court then reviewed current billing rates for each of\n[17]\nthe Plaintiffs' counsel  and reduced all submitted rates for the stated purpose of bringing those rates more into\nline with the prevailing legal market rate in the Austin, Texas trial venue. After multiplying the adjusted number of\nhours by the adjusted hourly rates, the district court arrived at tentative fee awards for each of the Plaintiffs'\ncounsel. It then reduced the tentative awards for the trial attorneys by fifteen percent to reflect the lack of success\nin obtaining any injunctive or monetary relief for the Plaintiffs individually. The court concluded its task with\n[18]\nnumerous tables displaying the relevant calculations.  This appeal followed.\nII.\nANALYSIS\nA. Admission to the Law School\n1. Standard of Review\nThe district court's determination that the Plaintiffs would not have been admitted to the Law School under a\n[19]\nconstitutional admissions system is a question of fact, which we review for clear error.  We review de novo\nwhether the district court faithfully and accurately applied our instructions on the burden of proof on remand from \n[20]\nHopwood II.  We review for clear error the district court's weighing of the evidence in light of the burden of\n[21]\nproof.\n2. Burden of Proof\nThe Hopwood II panel noted that, even though as a general rule plaintiffs seeking money damages must bear the\n[22]\nburden of proving that they have been injured, there can be a shift of burden on proof of discrimination.  That\npanel concluded that the Mt. Healthy methodology is appropriate in this case, and that under that methodology's\nburden-shifting minuet, the Law School should have a chance to prevail by showing, through a preponderance of\nthe evidence, that it would have reached the same admission decisions even in the absence of unconstitutional\n\n[23]\nconduct.  The Hopwood II panel stated that \"[i]n the event that the law school is unable to show (by a\npreponderance of the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted under a constitutional\nadmissions system, the court is to award that plaintiff any equitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\"\n[24]\nThe Plaintiffs argue that on remand the district court failed to follow the Hopwood II panel's instructions on burden\nof proof, pointing to, among other things, the district court's criticism of the panel's instruction to use the Mt.\n264 Healthy burden-shifting *264 methodology. The Plaintiffs insist that if the district court had followed the panel's\ninstructions faithfully by requiring the Law School to carry the burden of proof, Texas could not have prevailed\nbecause the burden was \"impossible\" to carry. We disagree.\nFirst, even though the district court did express its disagreement with our instruction to apply the Mt. Healthy\n[25]\nanalysis,  there is no indication from the record that, despite having voiced its criticism, the district court failed\nto follow the panel's instructions. The court proclaimed that \"[t]he Court is cognizant, however, of the panel's\n[26]\ninstructions on remand, and it will faithfully and responsibly execute them.\"  Our review of the record\ndemonstrates that in fact the court did faithfully and responsibly apply the Mt. Healthy burden as instructed. The\nLaw School put forth plenteous evidence in the form of Professor Wellborn's expert reports, as well as affidavits\nand testimony from admissions committee members, in support of the proposition that the Plaintiffs would not\nhave been admitted to the Law School in 1992 under a race-blind admissions procedure. In sum, the district court\nexpressly disagreed with our remand instructions regarding application of Mt. Healthy but it clearly followed them.\nNext, the Plaintiffs argue that if the district court had faithfully applied the Mt. Healthy burden-shifting analysis, it\nwould have had to find that the burden was \"impossible\" for the Law School to carry. The Plaintiffs note that in his\noriginal 1994 judgment, Hopwood A, the same district judge stated that \"it is virtually impossible to establish the\noutcome of a comparison of the plaintiffs' applications against the other applicants, whether minority or\n[27]\nnonminority.\"  The Plaintiffs also refer us to statements by several of the Law School's administrators and\nadmissions committee members voicing the opinion that to determine whether a candidate would have been\nadmitted under a race-blind system would require starting the admissions process over and reexamining every\nfile.\nWe do not share the Plaintiffs' interpretation of the Hopwood II instructions. That opinion merely requires that the\n[28]\nLaw School carry its burden using \"a constitutional admissions system.\"  Nowhere does it state that the Law\nSchool must replicate the 1992 admissions process in its entirety or that review of every file is required if the Law\nSchool were to meet its proof burden. Furthermore, we find no jurisprudential support for the proposition that a\ndefendant must employ any particular evaluation system or method to carry its burden of proof in a discrimination\ncase. Statements by Law School officials recognized that recreating the 1992 process would have been\nextremely difficult. Moreover, because doing that was not mandated by Hopwood II or by precedent, the district\ncourt on remand did not err in allowing the Law School to try to meet its burden of proof through the\ndemonstrated application of a hypothetical system free of racial preferences. In other words, the district court\n265 committed no error by allowing the Law School to attempt *265 to meet its Mt. Healthy burden without replicating\nthe 1992 admissions process.\n3. Admission Under a Race-Blind System\na. 1992 Admissions Procedure\nTo evaluate the quality of Professor Wellborn's testimony, we must start with an understanding of the admission\nprocedure that was employed by the Law School in 1992, when the Plaintiffs applied. In that year, the Law\nSchool received 4,494 applications for approximately 500 available seats. Initially, each application was assigned\nto one of the three administrative categories, based solely on the applicant's Texas Index (\"TI\") score. The TI\nscore is determined independently by the Law School Data Assembly Service (\"LSDAS\") using the applicant's\nundergraduate grade point average (\"GPA\") and Law School Admissions Test (\"LSAT\") score. The three\ncategories were (1) presumptive admit, (2) discretionary zone, and (3) presumptive deny.\n\n[29]\nThe TI scores needed for placement in the various categories were lower for minority  applicants than for\nnonminority applicants. Professor Stanley Johanson chaired the admissions committee in 1992 and had sole\nresponsibility for setting the cutoff scores for the three categories. In 1992, these cutoff scores were adjusted\nseveral times to increase the number of presumptive admits. By March 1992, Professor Johanson had set the\npresumptive admit threshold for nonminority applicants at a TI score of 199 and the presumptive denial ceiling for\n[30]\nthose applicants at 192.  All applicants with scores between 192 and 199 went into the discretionary category.\nFor minority applicants, however, the presumptive admit threshold was 192 and the presumptive denial ceiling\n[31]\nwas 179.  Once an application had been placed in one of the three administrative categories, it was subject to\ndifferent procedures for determining whether admission would be offered.\ni. Presumptive Admits\nThe file of a presumptive admit application would be reviewed by Professor Johanson to ensure that the TI score\nwas not artificially inflated by a high GPA from a noncompetitive college or university or by a noncompetitive\n[32]\nmajor.  Any presumptive admit applicants whom he found to have \"questionable files\" were lowered to the\n[33]\ndiscretionary zone for further review.  The rest of the applicants in the presumptive admit category were\noffered admission by Professor Johanson without consultation with other members of the admissions committee.\n[34]\nii. Discretionary Zone\nThe nonminority applications in the discretionary zone were separated into groups of thirty, and each group was\n[35]\nthen reviewed by three members of the admissions committee.  Each group's three committee members\nwould independently review every file in that group of thirty. Each committee member could vote to offer\nadmission to approximately nine of the thirty applicants whose files that he or she reviewed. Applicants in the\ndiscretionary zone who received either two or three favorable votes were offered admission; those who received\n266 one favorable vote were placed on the waiting list; and those *266 who received no favorable votes were turned\ndown.\niii. Minority Applicants\nThree members of the admissions committee served on a special minority subcommittee that reviewed the files\n[36]\nof all minority applicants in the discretionary zone.  This subcommittee would identify minority applicants\nwhom they deemed to be strong candidates for admission and would prepare summaries of each for review by\nthe full admissions committee.\niv. The Plaintiffs\nPlaintiff Hopwood had a TI score of 199. She had been graduated from California State University-Sacramento\nwith a GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT score in the 83rd percentile and had received an associate's degree in accounting\nfrom Montgomery County Community College. Hopwood's TI score of 199 placed her in the presumptive admit\ncategory; however, after reviewing her file, Professor Johanson downgraded her application to the discretionary\nzone, concluding that her GPA was inflated by the noncompetitive nature of her community college and\n[37]\nundergraduate university.  On review by three members of the admissions committee, Hopwood received one\n[38]\nvote. This one vote, cast by Assistant Dean Laquita Hamilton, put Hopwood on the waiting list,  from which\nshe was ultimately denied admission.\nPlaintiff Carvell had a TI score of 197, which placed him in the discretionary zone. Carvell had been graduated\nfrom Hendrix College in Arkansas with a degree in political science and a GPA of 3.28. He took the LSAT twice,\n\nscoring in the 61st percentile the first time, and in the 91st percentile the second time. His 197 TI score reflects\n[39]\nonly the second, higher LSAT score ; when averaged, his LSAT score would have placed him in the 76th\npercentile. Carvell received one vote for admission from a student member of the admissions committee,\npresumably placing him on the waiting list, from which he never received an offer of admission.\nPlaintiff Elliott also had a TI score of 197, placing him in the discretionary zone. He had been graduated from the\nUniversity with a bachelor's degree in accounting. He had a GPA of 2.98 and scored in the 95th percentile on his\nLSAT, but received no votes for admission. This resulted in his automatic denial of admission.\nPlaintiff Rogers also had a TI score of 197 which placed him in the discretionary category. He had been\ngraduated from the University of Houston-Downtown (UH-D) with a degree in professional writing. Before\nattending UH-D, he had attended the University, where he was placed on academic probation once and\ndismissed twice for failing grades. Rogers's GPA at UH-D was 3.13 and his LSAT was in the 94th percentile, but\nhe received no votes for admission.\nThe median GPA for all students entering the Law School from the 1992 admissions process was 3.52 and the\nmedian LSAT score was in the 89th percentile. The Law School offered admission to 637 Texas residents, of\n[40]\nwhich 541 were nonminority applicants and 96 were minority applicants.\nb. Expert Report and Testimony\nThe Law School proffered Professor Wellborn as an expert witness on the question whether the Plaintiffs would\nhave been admitted to the Law School under a race-blind admissions procedure. Professor Wellborn is a tenured\n267 faculty member of the Law School and has served on the *267 admissions committee since 1979, having chaired\nit in 1992. As the foundation for his trial testimony, Professor Wellborn presented a long and comprehensive\nexpert report which was followed by a supplemental expert report.\ni. Primary Report\nIn his primary report, Professor Wellborn analyzed the way that the 1992 admissions procedure operated with\nrespect to nonminority candidates. He then demonstrated how that procedure, if extended to all candidates,\nwould yield the same total number of admission offers under a race-blind system. Professor Wellborn also\nexplained the relationship between the TI scores and offers of admission to resident nonminority applicants,\nconcluding that 89 percent of such applicants with Hopwood's TI score of 199 were admitted. He also showed\nthat, of all candidates with a TI score of 197 (as achieved by Carvell, Elliott, and Rogers), only 59 percent were\nadmitted. Professor Wellborn then determined that if this exact procedure were used for all 1992 applicants,\nregardless of race or ethnicity, too few offers would have been forthcoming. Consequently, he lowered the\npresumptive admit threshold from 199 to 198 and determined that 90 percent of the applicants with TI scores\nbetween 196 and 199 would be admitted, and that 70 percent of the applicants with a TI score of 197 would be\nadmitted.\nProfessor Wellborn found that 61 of the 68 applicants with Hopwood's TI score of 199 were admitted, including\nfour minority applicants. He postulated that, under a race-blind system, there would have been one more offer of\nadmission. He then compared the four admitted minority applicants, Hopwood, and the other denied nonminority\napplicants, as potential candidates for this one additional spot. Professor Wellborn demonstrated that (1) all four\nminority applicants were \"clearly stronger\" candidates for admission than Hopwood, (2) three of the denied\nnonminority applicants were clearly stronger than Hopwood, and (3) two more denied nonminority applicants\nwere comparable to her. Professor Wellborn concluded that, just as it was in the actual 1992 process, Hopwood's\nfile would have been placed in the discretionary voting zone, and in the end she would not have received an offer\nof admission.\nProfessor Wellborn found that 45 of 72 applicants at Plaintiffs Carvell, Elliott, and Rogers's TI score level of 197,\nincluding one minority applicant, had been offered admission. He projected that under a race-blind system, six\nadditional offers would have been made at the 197 TI level. Professor Wellborn then compared the files of the\n\none admitted minority candidate, the three Plaintiffs who had 197 TI scores, and the remaining nonminority\napplicants with that score who had been denied admission. As a result of this exercise, Professor Wellborn\nconcluded that the minority applicant would not have been admitted, and that there would have been a total of\nseven additional offers at the 197 TI level. He observed that seven of these nonminority applicants stood out as\nthe strongest, all of whom were stronger than Hopwood and the other three Plaintiffs. Additionally, Professor\nWellborn identified four more applicants at the 197 TI level who were stronger than Carvell, Rogers, and Elliott,\nadding that Elliott and Rogers were among the weakest applicants at the 197 level. He offered his opinion that,\nalthough Carvell was a stronger applicant than Elliott and Rogers, Carvell still would have been in the bottom half\nof all applicants with TI scores of 197. Professor Wellborn also explained that because Carvell took the LSAT\ntwice, his scores should have been averaged by the LSDAS, which would have placed him in a lower TI index\ngroup from the start.\nii. Supplemental Report\nProfessor Wellborn was asked to identify (1) all 1992 resident minority (African-American and Mexican-American)\n268 admittees who would likely have been denied *268 admission in a race-blind process and (2) all resident\nnonminority applicants who were denied admission but would have been offered admission in a race-blind\nprocess, ahead of the minority applicants identified in the answer to question (1). He did this in his supplemental\nreport.\nProfessor Wellborn testified that, in completing this analysis, he examined the LSDAS reports of all admitted\nminority applicants and all denied nonminority applicants with a TI score above 190, and that he then examined\n[41]\nthe files  of those who appeared to be viable candidates based on the LSDAS report. In examining the reports\nand files, Professor Wellborn applied identical standards to the minority and nonminority candidates and\nconsidered the criteria that the Law School had previously identified as standards used for admission. He\nexplained that the most important factors for admission are the LSAT score and undergraduate academic record,\nwhich are weighted about equally. He stated further that the personal statement, letters of recommendation, and\nother materials in the file can be important in some instances. In addition, Professor Wellborn acknowledged that\neven though the LSDAS treats all GPAs alike for purposes of calculating the TI index score, file reviewers\ncustomarily take cognizance of the applicant's class rank and major, the mean LSAT score for the applicant's\n[42]\ncollege, and the applicant's college transcript.  He added that comparing the colleges' mean LSAT scores is\nthe best way of evaluating the various colleges and universities in terms of the caliber of their respective student\n[43]\nbodies.\nWhen Professor Wellborn completed his examination of these files, he identified 18 minority applicants who, in\nhis opinion, would likely have been admitted without regard to race, and two more minority applicants who,\nalthough weaker than the 18, might have been admitted. He labeled the first 18 minority applicants Group A and\nthe two additional minority applicants as Group B.\nProfessor Wellborn next noted that the Law School made 96 offers of admission to resident minority applicants in\n1992. After subtracting the 18 from Group A (those whom Professor Wellborn determined probably would be\nadmitted under a race-blind system), 78 offered places remained available for denied nonminority applicants. In\n1992, 398 nonminority Texas residents with TI indexes above 190 (including the four Plaintiffs) were denied\nadmission. Therefore, concluded Professor Wellborn, fewer than twenty percent of these 398 candidates would\nhave received one of the 78 additional offers of admission under a race-blind system. He also examined the\nLSDAS reports for each of the 398 resident nonminority applicants with a TI score above 190 who had been\ndenied admission, then examined the files of those applicants among the 398 who, based on his review of the\nLSDAS report, appeared to be viable candidates. From among those, Professor Wellborn narrowed the\nremaining nonminority applicants to the 78 whom he found to be the best candidates. He identified these 78\napplicants as Group C, then selected the next-best 20 applicants and identified them as Group D. None of the\nPlaintiffs qualified for inclusion in Group C or Group D. He testified that his comparison of the files of all\napplicants in the four identified groups further confirmed the weakness of the Plaintiffs' applications.\n\nAfter completing the selection of the 118 applicants comprising his four groups, Professor Wellborn identified four\n269 common *269 characteristics: (1) an LSAT in the 80th percentile or higher; (2) a college class rank in the 60th\npercentile or higher; (3) graduation from a college with an LSAT mean of 30 or higher; and (4) no more than one\nyear in a community or junior college. He went on to explain his reasons for selecting any applicants who did not\nmeet one of these criteria.\nFinally, Professor Wellborn identified the specific weaknesses in each of the Plaintiffs' files that, in his opinion,\nwould have adversely affected their chances of being offered admission. He noted that Plaintiff Elliott was in the\nbottom half of his class at the University and had no letters of recommendation from faculty. Professor Wellborn\nalso pointed out that only one presumptive admit in Group A had a class rank as low as Elliott's.\nProfessor Wellborn observed that Plaintiff Rogers's college record was a \"worse liability\" than Elliott's. He\nexplained that over the course of three separate stints at the University, Elliott had been placed on scholastic\nprobation once and dismissed for academic failure twice. Professor Wellborn remarked that, although Elliott\nsubsequently did achieve a high GPA at UHD, this school had a \"strikingly low\" LSAT college mean of 26, adding\nthat an LSAT college mean of 26 was among the lowest he had seen during his many years of service on the\nLaw School admissions committee. He also noted that Rogers's file contained no letters of recommendation.\nProfessor Wellborn reported that Hopwood's degree school, Cal State at Sacramento, had an LSAT college\nmean of 28, and that 60 of her credits were from a community college. He acknowledged that Hopwood's LSAT\nscore in the 83rd percentile would be adequate if combined with a reliable college record, but that alone her\nLSAT was not high enough to overcome the doubts raised by her undergraduate background. Professor Wellborn\nalso mentioned that Hopwood's file contained no letters of recommendation.\nIn analyzing Plaintiff Carvell's application, Professor Wellborn observed that when this candidate's two LSAT\nscores are averaged, he has a score in the 76th percentile. Professor Wellborn acknowledged that some of the\napplicants in his four groupings had low LSAT scores, but explained that in each instance the weak LSAT was\ncounterbalanced by a \"very strong\" college performance. Professor Wellborn contrasted Carvell's college record,\nnoting that Carvell was in the 59th percentile at a college with an LSAT mean score of 32. He also characterized\nCarvell's two faculty letters of recommendation as ranging between \"unimpressive to downright negative.\"\nc. Plaintiffs' View of Texas's Evidence\nThe Plaintiffs proffered no expert witness of their own, electing instead to attack the work of Professor Wellborn.\nThey ultimately argue that Professor Wellborn's analysis was not \"remotely adequate\" to carry the Defendants'\nburden. As we have noted, the district court's eventual determination whether the Law School carried its burden\nof establishing that the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of being offered admission under a race-\n[44]\nblind admissions system is a question of fact that we review for clear error.\nPlaintiffs Carvell and Hopwood argue that Professor Wellborn's supplemental report is unreliable because he\nbegan its analysis by using these Plaintiffs' applications as a \"floor,\" then seeking to identify applications that\nwere stronger. Hopwood and Carvell also contend that Professor Wellborn cherry-picked aspects of the 1992\nsystem, embracing those that favored his position while ignoring or rejecting aspects that were unfavorable. They\n270 point to his assumption that all of the nonminority applicants who were admitted in 1992 would *270 have been\nadmitted under a race-blind system and his rejection of the possibility that Hopwood and Carvell, who received\none vote each, would have been selected ahead of candidates who received no votes.\nTo repeat, the Hopwood II panel's remand instructions did not require the Law School to replicate precisely the\nadmissions system that it had employed in 1992; rather, the Law School was simply required to use any\nreasonable race-blind system. Professor Wellborn clearly stated in his supplemental report that in his evaluation\nhe used the same criteria for minority and nonminority applicants alike. The assumption in his supplemental\nreport that only 96 seats would have been open for admission because all nonminority applicants admitted in\n1992 would have been admitted under a race-blind system is logical. Not even the Plaintiffs dispute that it was\nmore difficult for nonminority applicants to gain admission in 1992 than it would have been under a race-blind\n\nsystem; indeed, that is at the core of their argument of reverse discrimination. It is therefore logical to conclude\nthat those nonminority applicants who were admitted in 1992 would have been admitted under a race-blind\nsystem.\nHopwood and Carvell nevertheless contend that Professor Wellborn's assumption that the nonminority\ncandidates who were admitted in 1992 would have been admitted under a race-blind system is inconsistent with\nhis refusal to consider the fact that Hopwood and Carvell received one vote each in 1992, placing them on a\n[45]\nwaiting list.  The flaw in their argument lies in their failure to recognize that in 1992 there were two waiting\nlists, one for nonminority applicants and one for minority applicants, a situation that, by definition, could not exist\nin a race-blind system. Coupled with Professor Wellborn's testimony regarding the aberrant nature of the one\nvote that each of them received 00 Hopwood's cast for diversity on the basis of age, marital status, and childcare\n97\nresponsibilities, and Carvell's cast by a student member of the Committee 00 makes problematical the giving of\n97\nany significance to their positions on the 1992 waiting list in the context of a race-blind system that would have a\nsingle, race-blind waiting list and no certainty that, under such a system, a single vote would get an applicant on\nthe waiting list at all.\nProfessor Wellborn elected to employ a fair alternative. He reconsidered all applicants, both the admitted minority\ncandidates and all of the nonminority candidates, who had TI scores in the same range as the Plaintiffs (above\n190). Thus, even though Hopwood and Carvell got no special consideration from Professor Wellborn for their\nrespective votes, neither did the admitted minority applicants 00 even those who received one or two votes. Under\n97\nProfessor Wellborn's reconstruction, Hopwood and Carvell received treatment equal to all denied minority\ncandidates in their TI range. Professor Wellborn examined the LSDAS report of each one of these applicants and\ncarefully re-examined the entire file of each of those whom he considered to be a viable candidate. All this was\ndone using race-blind criteria.\nThe Law School supplied additional evidence that cast light on the one vote received by both Hopwood and\n271 Carvell. Assistant Dean Laquita Hamilton, who had cast Hopwood's one vote, testified, and *271 provided an\naffidavit stating, that she had voted for Hopwood in the belief that Hopwood would bring diversity to the incoming\nclass because she was an older student, had worked while in school, and was raising a handicapped child. Dean\nHamilton's vote for Hopwood clearly was not cast in the belief that Hopwood was academically more qualified\nthan other applicants based on the system's criteria of LSAT score, college academic record, personal statement,\nand letters of recommendation.\nCarvell's one vote was cast by a student member of the admissions committee. Professor Johanson testified that\nsometimes the votes of student members of the committee are aberrant departures from the admissions\ndecisions norm, noting that Carvell received no votes from non-student members of the admissions committee.\nFinally, the Plaintiffs would make much of Professor Wellborn's acknowledgment that he made a number of small\nerrors in his analysis. These include such things as misstating that each committee member could vote for nine of\nthe 30 applicants in the group of discretionary zone candidates when in fact each could vote for 10. The Plaintiffs\nalso stress that Professor Wellborn failed to consider the difference between applicants with two-digit scores\nunder an older LSDAS system and those with a three-digit TI index in the newer LSDAS system. We have\nconsidered each of the flaws singled out by the Plaintiffs and are satisfied that, neither alone nor in combination,\nare they sufficient to affect the validity of the studies or to impugn Professor Wellborn's ultimate conclusions.\nd. Plenary Evaluation of Defendants' Evidence\nThe nature and history of this case have influenced us to review the record de novo, including the Plaintiffs'\nLSDAS reports and files, all of the LSDAS reports included in Professor Wellborn's report, and the additional\napplication files contained therein. As a result we are further convinced that the district court did not clearly err in\nfinding that the Plaintiffs would not have been offered admission to the Law School under a race-blind admissions\nsystem.\nThe application file of each Plaintiff includes at least one significant weakness. Even though Hopwood's LSAT\nscore was in the 83rd percentile, she had received her undergraduate degree from a relatively weak institution,\n\nhad garnered at least 60 hours at a community college, and had earned her bachelor's degree from a school with\na college LSAT mean of 28. Less than 2 percent of nonminority applicants admitted in 1992 had been graduated\n[46]\nfrom schools with college LSAT means of 28 or below.  Furthermore, Hopwood's file contained no letters of\nrecommendation or personal statements. Testifying members of the admissions committee in addition to\nProfessor Wellborn agreed unanimously that Hopwood's undergraduate record and degree institution made her\n\"not well prepared academically\" and \"very weak in comparison with the overwhelming credentials of so many\" of\nthe other applicants.\nPlaintiff Carvell took the LSAT twice, and even when averaged, his LSAT score was only in the 76th percentile,\nwell below the median of 89th percentile of those admitted in 1992. Carvell's 3.28 GPA was also well below the\n3.53 median for applicants admitted in 1992, and his file contained one distinctly negative letter: One of his\ncollege professors had written that he was \"disappointed\" in Carvell's grades and that Carvell had a \"mediocre\"\nand \"uneven\" academic performance. Other members of the admissions committee uniformly agreed that\nCarvell's undergraduate academic performance was \"unimpressive.\"\n272 *272 Plaintiff Rogers also had a relatively weak undergraduate record. Initially he had attended the University,\nwhere he was not only placed on academic probation but was twice dismissed for failing grades in a period of\nthree and one-half years. Even though Rogers did eventually graduate with a GPA of 3.13, his degree institution,\nUH-D, had a very low mean LSAT score of 26, and no letters of recommendation were provided.\nPlaintiff Elliott's LSAT score in the 95th percentile was quite good, but his GPA at the University was only 2.98. In\nhis own personal statement, Elliott acknowledged that in undergraduate school he was \"an average student,\nstudying when I needed to, partying more than I should, and not managing my time efficiently.\" Elliott candidly\nadmitted that his undergraduate academic performance \"is not of the caliber expected by the University of Texas\n[47]\nSchool of Law.\"\nThe Plaintiffs' arguments criticizing the Law School's evidence were presented fully and forcefully to the district\n[48]\ncourt by able counsel and were considered in depth by that court.  Its analysis of the Plaintiffs' criticisms of\nProfessor Wellborn's analysis was painstakingly thorough. The district court independently evaluated Professor\n[49]\nWellborn's methodology by reviewing hundreds of application files itself.  Our equally painstaking review of the\nentire record convinces us that the district court was both indefatigable and disciplined in carefully considering all\nthe evidence and was equally diligent in its consideration and application of the law and arguments presented by\nall the attorneys. We conclude that the district court's ultimate finding that the Plaintiffs would have had no\nreasonable chance of being admitted to the Law School under a race-blind admission system was not merely\n[50]\nfree of reversible error but was eminently correct.\nB. Hopwood II Revisited\n1. Law of the Case\nWe could not reconsider the merits of Hopwood II and reverse or revise it, as Texas urges, without first clearing a\nvery substantial hurdle: The law of the case doctrine. Under the strictures of that maxim, \"we will not reexamine\nissues of law addressed by a prior panel opinion in a subsequent appeal of the same case unless: (i) the\nevidence on a subsequent trial was substantially different, (ii) controlling authority has since made a contrary\ndecision on the law applicable to such issues, or (iii) the decision was clearly erroneous and would work a\n[51]\nmanifest injustice.\"  Texas acknowledges that the first two exceptions to this doctrine, which bars a\nsubsequent panel from reversing or disregarding the holding of a prior panel, do not apply to the instant case.\nTexas contends, however, that the third exceptional justification for departing from law of the case does apply\nhere; that the Hopwood II panel decision is \"clearly erroneous\" and will \"work a manifest injustice\" if it is not\noverturned.\nIn the context of the law of the case doctrine, \"clearly erroneous\" is a very exacting standard. \"Mere doubts or\ndisagreement about the wisdom of a prior decision of this or a lower court will not suffice for this exception. To be\n\n273 clearly *273 erroneous, a decision must strike us as more than just maybe or probably wrong; it must be dead\n[52]\nwrong.\"  Texas asserts that Hopwood II is in fact \"dead wrong,\" arguing that its rulings directly conflict with\nseveral Supreme Court precedents.\nThe Hopwood II panel held that:\nthe University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to\nadmit [1] in order to achieve a diverse student body, [2] to combat the perceived effects of a\nhostile environment at the law school, [3] to alleviate the law school's poor reputation in the\nminority community, or [4] to eliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors other\n[53]\nthan the law school.\nTexas attacks Hopwood II's rejection of two of the enumerated justifications as being clearly erroneous. Texas\nfirst contends that the University has a compelling interest in remedying the present effects of past discrimination,\nboth by the University itself and by the Texas public education system as a whole. Texas then argues that the\nUniversity has a compelling interest in obtaining a diverse student body. We shall analyze these two contentions\nin turn.\na. Remedying the Effects of Past Discrimination\nThe Supreme Court has conclusively established that the government can, consistent with the Constitution, use\n[54]\nracial preferences under particular circumstances to remedy the present effects of past discrimination.  But it\nhas also placed several limitations on the use of racial preferences for remedial purposes. In Wygant, the Court\n[55]\nruled that the government cannot use racial preferences to remedy general, societal discrimination.  In \nCroson, the Court ruled that a municipality cannot use racial preferences in the awarding of construction\n[56]\ncontracts to remedy discrimination in the construction industry as a whole.\nDespite having addressed the subject of remedial racial preferences in several opinions, though, the Supreme\nCourt has yet to establish specific rules for determining precisely how \"localized\" past discrimination must be\nbefore a particular governmental entity (in this case, the Law School or even the University) can, consistent with\nthe Constitution, use racial preferences to remedy the effects of prior discrimination. The Hopwood II panel\nnevertheless stepped into this \"rules vacuum\" and developed fairly specific guidelines for determining when\nremedial racial preferences are justified. The panel ruled that (1) the University cannot use racial preferences to\n[57]\nremedy discrimination in other components of Texas's public education system,  and (2) the record evidence\n[58]\ndid not support the University's use of racial preferences to remedy the effects of its own past discrimination.\nIn arguing that the rulings of Hopwood II are clearly erroneous within the meaning of the law of the case doctrine,\nTexas contends, as it did then, that the University should be allowed to take race into account as a means of\n274 remedying the effects *274 of past discrimination in other components of Texas's public education system. Texas\nadvances two arguments in support of this contention. First, it insists that Hopwood II conflicts with the Supreme\nCourt's rejection in Croson of the \"stark\" notion that a governmental entity \"must limit any race-based remedial\n[59]\nefforts to eradicating the effects of its own prior discrimination.\"  Texas takes this statement out of context,\nhowever: The Croson court went on to explain that \"if [a governmental entity] could show that it had essentially\nbecome a `passive participant' in a [private] system of racial exclusion practiced by [local] elements ... we think it\n[60]\nclear that the [governmental entity] could take affirmative steps to dismantle such a system.\"  This holding is\nwholly inapplicable here because Texas has never claimed that the University was ever a passive participant in a \n[61]\nprivate system of racial exclusion.  Thus, Hopwood II does not conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in \nCroson.\nSecond, Texas argues that neither Wygant nor Croson commands the broad approach taken by the Hopwood II\npanel. This is certainly true: Hopwood II went beyond established Supreme Court precedent in several important\nrespects. Within the law of the case framework, however, it is not clear error for a court of appeals to tackle legal\nquestions that the Supreme Court has declined to answer: Lower courts are bound only by Supreme Court \n\nholdings and not by the Court's election, either express or implied, to leave open particular legal questions. This\nor other subsequent panels of our court may well disagree with the aggressive legal reasoning employed by the \n[62]\nHopwood II panel,  but it cannot be said that, as a matter of law, the panel's decision is \"dead wrong.\" As \nHopwood II's ruling with respect to the appropriate scope of remedial racial preferences is not clearly erroneous\nwithin the intendment of the law of the case doctrine, we cannot today reconsider that decision with an eye\ntoward disregarding or reversing it.\nb. Diversity as a Compelling Governmental Interest\nTexas also contends that \"[i]n holding that diversity may never be a compelling interest justifying the\nconsideration of race or ethnicity in admissions, the Hopwood II panel attempted to create a new rule of\nconstitutional law despite the Supreme Court's continued hesitation to do so.\" Although we agree with Texas's\ncharacterization of the Hopwood II panel opinion, we have just demonstrated that a federal appeals court's\ncreation of a new rule of constitutional law when a lacuna exists in the Supreme Court's rulings on the point does\nnot constitute clear error.\nThe diversity rationale was first advanced by Justice Powell in his swing opinion in Bakke, in which he wrote only\n[63]\nfor himself.  Although four Justices joined Justice Powell in holding that \"the State has a substantial interest\nthat legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive\n[64]\nconsideration of race and ethnic origin,\"  the same four disagreed with him as to the rationale that is\nnecessary to justify constitutionally the government's use of racial preferences. Justice Brennan wrote separately\non behalf of the four concurring Justices to express the view that the Constitution permits the government to use\n275 racial preferences only \"to *275 remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.\"[65] None of\nthe four other justices would go the extra step proposed by Justice Powell and approve student body diversity as\na justification for a race-based admission criterion.\nAlthough Bakke clearly stands for the proposition that the government can use racial preferences under some\ncircumstances, no controlling rationale emerged from that opinion to delineate precisely what those justifying\ncircumstances are. Thus, in deciding whether the system of racial preferences employed by the Law School was\nconstitutional, the Hopwood II panel was free to determine which among the competing rationales offered by the\n[66]\njustices in Bakke is constitutionally valid.  Once the Hopwood II panel determined to decide the case on the\nquestion of compelling state interest and not, as urged in the special concurrence, on the question of narrow\n[67]\ntailoring,  the panel was constrained in its judgment only by other Supreme Court decisions and by the text of\nthe Constitution itself.\nThe Hopwood II panel ruled that the Constitution does permit the government to use racial preferences for the\n[68]\npurpose of remedying the present effects of past discrimination,  but that the government cannot\nconstitutionally use racial preferences for the purpose of fostering student body diversity. Although Justice Powell\nwould surely have disagreed with that holding, we cannot say that Hopwood II conflicts with any portion of Bakke\n[69]\nthat is binding on this court.  Some may think it was imprudent for the Hopwood II panel to venture into\nuncharted waters by declaring the diversity rationale invalid, but the panel's holding clearly does not conflict\ndirectly with controlling Supreme Court precedent. Inasmuch as the Hopwood II panel's ruling on diversity did not\nrise to the level of clear error, the law of the case doctrine bars our revisiting or disregarding that decision today.\n276  2. Hopwood B's Injunction\n*276\na. Standard of Review\n[70]\nWe review the district court's grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion.\n\nb. Injunction Against Consideration of Race\nOn remand from Hopwood II, the district court entered an injunction forbidding the Law School and its\nadministrators \"from taking into consideration racial preferences in the selection of those individuals to be\n[71]\nadmitted as students.\"  Texas asks us to reverse that injunction, arguing that it conflicts with the Supreme\n[72]\nCourt's holding in Bakke.  In Hopwood A, the district court refused to enter an injunction against the University\nthat would forbid the Law School's use of racial preferences in its admissions process. On appeal of that ruling,\nthe Hopwood II panel stated:\nIt is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are\nconfident that the conscientious administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the\ndirectives contained in this opinion. If an injunction should be needed in the future, the district\ncourt, in its discretion, can consider its parameters without our assistance. Accordingly, we leave\n[73]\nintact that court's refusal to enter an injunction.\nDespite (1) the district court's original refusal to enjoin the Law School and (2) the Hopwood II panel's admonition\nthat it did not believe that an injunction was necessary, on remand the district court in Hopwood B entered an\ninjunction barring the Law School \"from taking into consideration racial preferences in the selection of those\nindividuals to be admitted as students.\" Given the Hopwood II panel's instructions on remand, the district court\nwas certainly within its discretion to investigate the necessity of entering an injunction and to enter an appropriate\ninjunction if it concluded that one was needed 00 and apparently it did so. The particular injunction entered by the\n97\ndistrict court, however, must be reversed for two reasons.\nFirst, in its otherwise extensive and able management of this case on remand, one thing that the district court did\n[74]\nnot do was conduct a hearing to determine whether an injunction \"was needed in the future.\"  Neither did it\npurport to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), which requires federal trial courts to support their\njudgments with written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Nowhere to be found in the district court's lengthy\nand otherwise thorough opinion are any express findings of fact or conclusions of law addressing or supporting\nthe need for an injunction; and we cannot glean any, even implicitly, from other parts of that opinion. We are left\nno choice, therefore, but to reverse the court's injunction for failure to comply with Rule 52(a). We deliberately\nelect to reverse rather than vacate the district court's injunction, however, so that we may remand and thereby\ngive the court an opportunity to explicate its findings and conclusions if it should still perceive a need to issue an\ninjunction.\nIn reversing and remanding, however, we would be remiss if we did not emphasize a second reason for so doing:\nOn its face, the district court's injunction impermissibly conflicts with the square holding in Bakke. The Hopwood\nB injunction forbids the University from using racial preferences for any reason, despite Bakke's holding that\n277 racial preferences are constitutionally *277 permissible in some circumstances.[75] Consistent with that position, \nHopwood II does not bar the University from using race for any and all remedial purposes; rather Hopwood II\nbars the University from using race to remedy the effects of previous discrimination in other components of\n[76]\nTexas's public education system only.  By enjoining any and all use of racial preferences, the district court\nwent beyond the holding of Hopwood II and, in the process, entered a judgment that conflicts with Bakke. If, on\nremand, the district court should determine, after conducting an evidentiary hearing or hearings, that an injunction\nis necessary, and supports that determination with findings of fact and conclusions of law, any injunction that it\nenters must not exceed the scope of the ruling in Hopwood II or the holding in Bakke.\nC. Attorneys' Fees\nBoth sides have expressed displeasure with the district court's rulings on attorneys' fees. Presumably their\ndispleasure will continue, for we affirm the court's attorneys' fees rulings in all respects.\n\nCongress has provided an incentive for attorneys to take on difficult civil rights cases by allowing district courts in\n[77]\ntheir discretion to shift, from the plaintiffs to the defendants, the cost of prosecuting such an action.  Title 42,\nSection 1988(b) of the United States Code provides:\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of ... [section 1983] ... the court, in its discretion,\nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of\n[78]\nthe costs[.]\n1. Standard of Review\nThe district courts' discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under § 1988 is appropriately broad. We have\nrepeatedly noted in the past, \"`[w]hen a district court awards [attorneys' fee pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988], we\nreview the award only for an abuse of discretion....\" A request for attorney's fees should not result in a second\nmajor litigation. \"... We cannot overemphasize the concept that a district court has broad discretion in determining\n[79]\nthe amount of a fee award.'\"  Appellate courts have only a limited opportunity to appreciate the complexity of\ntrying any given case and the level of professional skill needed to prosecute it. In contrast, the district court here\nhas, among other things, observed firsthand the presentation of testimony and argument at trial, sifted through\ncountless depositions and interrogatories, and assessed the value of numerous dispositive filings.\n2. Texas's Contentions\nTexas raises two objections to the district court's award of attorneys' fees: (1) The Plaintiffs are not prevailing\nparties within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b); and (2) Even if the Plaintiffs are deemed to be prevailing\nparties, they would not be entitled to any fees because they were unable to achieve any direct relief. The\n278 prevailing parties issue was resolved by the district court before the *278 appeal in Hopwood II.[80] On\ncompletion of that appeal, we remanded with instructions for the district court to determine the reasonableness of\n[81]\nthe fees, not for the parties to relitigate the prevailing party issue.  In any event, the Plaintiffs are quite clearly\nprevailing parties as \"[t]he plaintiffs accomplished the principal goal of the lawsuit 00 to dismantle all forms of\n97\n[82]\nracial preferences in public higher education in Texas.\"  The insistence of Texas that the Plaintiffs achieved\n[83]\nonly limited monetary relief is unavailing. Even nominal damages can support an award of attorneys' fees.\nAttorneys' fees are particularly appropriate here, given the Law School's change of its admissions process as a\n[84]\ndirect result of the instant litigation.\nTexas contends, in the alternative, that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to any fee award because they achieved no\nspecific injunctive or monetary relief. A prevailing plaintiff \"should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless\n[85]\nspecial circumstances would render such an award unjust.\"  As we discuss below, the district court properly\naccounted for the Plaintiffs' lack of success in obtaining monetary and other direct relief by reducing their\nattorneys' submitted hourly totals. We cannot credit Texas's argument that the Plaintiffs have not achieved a\ncompensable goal. As noted, the Plaintiffs have achieved \"the principal goal of their lawsuit\" 00 a benefit that\n97\ninures to all future applicants to the Law School, at least those who advocate a race-blind system. It is important\nto add in this respect that Section 1988 \"is a tool that ensures the vindication of important rights, even when large\n[86]\nsums of money are not at stake, by making attorney's fees available under a private attorney general theory.\"\n3. The Plaintiffs' Contentions\nThe Plaintiffs assert numerous objections to the district court's awards of attorneys' fees. They first object to the\ncourt's refusal to consider fee requests for work done after the Supreme Court's refusal to grant their petition for a\nwrit of certiorari. The Plaintiffs filed their final supplemental fee applications before the trial on remand in \nHopwood B. Even if we were to conclude that the district court abused its discretion by entertaining the post-\nremand supplemental application before the trial rather than after it, such error would be harmless because the\n\nPlaintiffs are not prevailing parties on any issues resolved in the post-remand trial. They were not able to prove\nentitlement to any monetary relief. It is true that the court granted injunctive relief barring any use of racial\npreferences by the Law School, but to the extent the Plaintiffs prevailed on that issue, their victory was assured\n279 by professional services rendered *279 prior to remand.[87]\nThe Plaintiffs also object to the district court's 25 percent summary reduction based on the inadequacy of the time\nentries, duplicative work product, and lack of billing judgment of their counsels' submitted hourly totals. The\n[88]\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in adjusting the number of hours downward.  In its opinion, the court\n[89]\nlists and describes eleven different instances of lack of billing judgment by the Plaintiffs' counsel.  The\nPlaintiffs counter on appeal with an affidavit by one of the lead attorneys, insisting that he indeed did exercise\nbilling judgment. Without more, however, the Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the district court abused its\ndiscretion.\nThe Plaintiffs further object to the district court's reduction of the submitted hourly totals to account for their lack\nof success. The Plaintiffs argue that they achieved the \"principal goal of their lawsuit\" by striking down racial\npreferences in higher education admissions in Texas. As Texas points out, however, the Plaintiffs did not receive\nany specific injunctive or monetary relief for their own asserted injuries, and they did not gain admission to the\n[90]\nLaw School. A fifteen per cent reduction for this lack of success is not an abuse of discretion.\nThe Plaintiffs next contend that in its analysis of the fee issue the district court ignored some of the factors listed\n[91] [92]\nin Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.  to guide the district courts in their attorney's fee inquiries.\nSpecifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the district court either overlooked or failed to consider adequately the\nfollowing Johnson factors: (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (2) the skill required to perform the legal\nservice properly; (3) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (4) the amount involved and the\n[93]\nresults obtained; and (5) the \"undesirability\" of the case.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in\naccording these factors little or no weight. The issues presented by this case may well provide grist for the\n[94]\npolitical and legal mills, but they are \"neither novel nor extraordinarily difficult[.]\"  The underlying arguments\nabout the place of affirmative action in the equal protection paradigm have been percolating since the Supreme\n[95]\nCourt's decision in Bakke if not longer ; only the evidence and analysis supporting each side have grown more\nsophisticated over the past two decades. Stated differently, this is not an issue that demanded a large amount of\nlegal excavation in this instance. Additionally, as earlier noted, the Plaintiffs were indeed successful, but no\n280 amount of professional chest-pounding or *280 puffery can obscure the fact that none of the Plaintiffs has been\noffered admission to the Law School or awarded monetary damages for the Law School's refusal or failure to\noffer them admission.\nThe district court's denial of fees for work of Plaintiffs' counsel in successfully opposing the attempted intervention\nby the Thurgood Marshall Legal Society, the Black Pre-Law Association, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and\nthe Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, is another bone of contention advanced by the\n[96]\nPlaintiffs. In particular, they object to the extension of Independent Fed'n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes  to the\nfacts of this case. The plaintiff in Zipes sought an award of attorney's fees from the intervenor. The Supreme\nCourt held that recovery of fees from the intervenor cannot be had unless the intervention is \"frivolous,\n[97]\nunreasonable, or without foundation.\"  Our fellow circuits have extended this holding, in varying degrees, to\nthe award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs from the pockets of losing defendants when the fees are based on\n[98]\ninterventions by third-parties.  We need not decide today whether a prevailing plaintiff is absolutely barred\nfrom shifting to the defendant the costs associated with defending against an intervention, for here the Plaintiffs\n[99]\ndid not \"prevail\" on this issue vis-à-vis Texas.  Texas remained neutral on the intervention issue. In addition,\nthe potential intervenors made clear both to the trial court and to us in Hopwood I that the purpose of their\n[100]\nintervention was to raise arguments and defenses that Texas itself had no interest in raising.  Both we and\nthe trial court denied intervention, holding that Texas would adequately protect the interests of those affected by\n[101]\naffirmative action.  It would be inequitable now for us to force Texas to pay for costs associated with a failed\n[102]\nintervention which, in our determination, would have brought nothing more to the table than did Texas.  The\nPlaintiffs elected to oppose intervention, and they were successful 00 but not against Texas: They succeeded\n97\n\nagainst the putative intervenors in a case instituted by Plaintiffs, not by Texas. Neither logic nor equity supports\ntaxing Texas under these circumstances. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys' fees\nto the Plaintiffs for their legal expenses incurred in opposing intervention.\nThe Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees objections also include the district court's denial of fees for monitoring the\ncomments of Texas in the media and for responding to those comments. The Plaintiffs argue that they are entitled\nto a fee award for this work because, for example, they were able to use one of the public comments by the\nAttorney General of Texas in their successful opposition to the granting of a writ of certiorari by the Supreme\n281 Court. We are chary about granting requests for media fees.[103] The controversy underlying *281 this case is a\npolitically and socially divisive one. The district court's disallowance of fees for combat on the affirmative action\nissue in the non-legal media is not an abuse of discretion.\nThe Plaintiffs object additionally to the district court's reduction of their counsels' hourly rates. For instance,\nTheodore Olson, a noted appellate litigator in our nation's capital and one of the lawyers for Plaintiffs Hopwood\nand Carvell, had his hourly rate reduced from $450.00 to $225.00. Although Mr. Olson advises that his rate was\nadjudged reasonable by the D.C. Circuit in an unrelated case, the attorneys' fees calculus is a fact-intensive one\nand its character varies from case to case. In this case, the district court found that in the relevant legal market,\nwhich is not the District of Columbia but Austin, Texas, high quality appellate representation could be obtained for\na lower rate than that normally charged by Mr. Olson. Hourly rates are to be computed according to the prevailing\n[104]\nmarket rates in the relevant legal market, not the rates that \"lions at the bar may command.\"\nIn essence, the Plaintiffs' argument is that the out-of-town rates should have been used because the out-of-\ntowners had special competence and there was a lack of available counsel of that quality locally. The district\n[105]\ncourt observed, however, that local counsel had \"provided competent and skilled representation\"  before the\nPlaintiffs obtained additional non-local counsel, and ventured the belief that local counsel would have been\n\"capable of the same degree of competence regarding the appeal had it been determined he should have\n[106]\nremained the plaintiffs' primary lawyer.\"  Contrary to the Plaintiffs' counsel's appreciation of this case, we do\nnot perceive it to have been extraordinarily difficult. Again, the place of affirmative action in higher education has\nbeen the subject of legal discourse for many years. The district court's decision to reduce the hourly rates does\n[107]\nnot constitute an abuse of discretion.\nIn sum, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its rulings on attorneys' fees. We therefore affirm\nthose rulings.\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court was correct, and thus free of clear error, in holding on remand that Texas had borne its burden\nof proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the Plaintiffs would have had no reasonable chance of being\noffered admission to the Law School in 1992 under a constitutionally valid, race-blind admissions system. In\n282 affirming that ruling we avoid the *282 need to address the district court's alternative findings of fact and\nconclusions of law regarding compensable damages incurred by the Plaintiffs.\nThe district court failed to comply with the strictures of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), however, when it\nfailed to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law to justify its injunction prohibiting absolutely the use of\nrace as a factor in the admissions process. The district court also exceeded the limits of the remand under which\nit was operating and at the same time conflicted with the aspect of Bakke that authorizes consideration of race in\nhigher education admissions to eradicate vestiges of previous discrimination. We therefore reverse the court's\ngrant of that injunction and remand for further proceedings on the injunction issue consistent with this opinion.\nAs the district court acted within its discretion in all rulings on attorneys' fees, we affirm those rulings in all\nrespects.\n\nAFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and REMANDED in part.\n[*] District Judge of the Western District of Louisiana, sitting by designation.\n[1]Hopwood v.

Id. at 883. The\ndistrict court noted that mathematically this could not be true: Even if all 96 offers of admission made to minorities\nhad been made to nonminorities, approximately 1400 nonminority applicants would still have been denied\nadmission.

See Hopwood B, 999\nF.Supp. at 888 n. 34.\n[44]Odom, 3 F.3d at 843.\n[45] Hopwood and Carvell also argue that failure to consider that each of them received one vote for admission is\nin direct contradiction to a statement made by Professor Johanson in another discrimination lawsuit, Malooly v.\nTexas, Civ. No. A96CA229SS (W.D.Tex.1994). The record contains an affidavit by Professor Johanson from that\ncase in which he avers that Mr. Malooly received no votes for admission and that candidates with one, two, or\nthree votes would have been considered superior to Malooly. We do not agree that this statement necessarily\n\nmakes the method employed by Professor Wellborn inherently unfair or illogical. Furthermore, the statement\nwould have more weight if it were Professor Johanson rather than Professor Wellborn who developed and\npresented the expert testimony in the instant case.\n[46] The 1992 LSAT means at other colleges demonstrate the relative weakness of this LSAT mean.

See Smith v. University of Washington, 233 F.3d 1188 at 1199-1200 (9th\nCir.2000). Despite the facts that (1) no Justice other than Justice Powell even discussed diversity in Bakke and\n(2) no other Justice joined that part of Justice Powell's opinion that advanced the diversity rationale, the Ninth\nCircuit nevertheless hypothesized that Justice Brennan (joined by Justices White, Marshall, and Blackmun) \"\nwould have embraced [the diversity rationale] if need be.\" See id. (emphasis added). It follows, at least according\nto the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, that Justice Powell's diversity rationale is \"the narrowest footing upon which\n\na race-conscious decision making process could stand\" and accordingly is the \"holding\" of Bakke under Marks v.\nUnited States 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (\"When a fragmented Court decides a\ncase ... the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the\njudgments on the narrowest grounds.\"). See id. at 1199-1200. With respect, however, we do not read Marks as\nan invitation from the Supreme Court to read its fragmented opinions like tea leaves, attempting to divine what\nthe Justices \"would have\" held. Rather, in the absence of subsequent Supreme Court precedent squarely and\nunequivocally holding that diversity can never be a compelling state interest, we read Bakke as not foreclosing\n(but certainly not requiring) the acceptance by lower courts of diversity as a compelling state interest.\n[67]Hopwood II, 78 F.3d at 966 (Wiener, J., specially concurring).\n[68]Id. at 948-49 (citing Croson, 488 U.S. at 500, 109 S.Ct. 706).\n[69] We recognize that in a recent challenge to the University of Michigan's use of race in admissions decisions,\nthe district court held that Supreme Court precedent does not bar courts from considering diversity as a\ncompelling state interest. See Gratz v. Bollinger, 122 F.Supp.2d 811 at 821-22 (E.D.Mich. 2000). Although\ndecided contrary to Hopwood II with respect to the constitutional validity of the diversity rationale, Gratz is\nnevertheless consistent with our position that the Hopwood II panel was neither constrained to accept, nor\nrequired to reject, diversity as a compelling state interest under binding Supreme Court precedent.\n[70]Regions Bank of Louisiana v.

This contention is unavailing. The district court specifically indicated that it had reviewed the\nhourly rates for all the attorneys and adjusted them accordingly. In many cases, when the attorneys submitted\ncurrent hourly rates in addition to historical rates, the court used the current rates to compensate for delay in\npayment. In Smith's case, the submitted rate of $125.00 was \"higher than Smith's normal billing rate and is the\nhighest rate Smith has ever received in any federal civil rights litigation he has undertaken.\" See Hopwood B, 999\nF.Supp. at 918. In light of the district court's finding that Smith had limited trial and appellate experience and a\nlimited role in the case, and that the court found many of the requested rates to be excessive, we conclude that\nthe lower court did not abuse its discretion in not increasing Smith's award for delay in payment. We find that the\nhigher rate that he received from the court 00 higher than any other case he has tried 00 takes into account delay\n97 97\nin payment. It is important to keep in mind that \"attorneys' fee litigation should not require specific reasoning by\nthe trial court to justify every facet of its decision[.]\" Blanchard v.

SMITH, Circuit Judge: \nWith the best of intentions, in order to increase the enrollment of certain favored classes of \nminority students, the University of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\") discriminates in \nfavor of those applicants by giving substantial racial preferences in its admissions program. \nThe beneficiaries of this system are blacks and Mexican Americans, to the detriment of \nwhites and nonpreferred minorities. The question we decide today in No. 94-50664 is \nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment permits the school to discriminate in this way. \nWe hold that it does not. The law school has presented no compelling justification, under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment or Supreme Court precedent, that allows it to continue to \nelevate some races over others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting perceived \nracial imbalance in the student body. \"Racial preferences appear to `even the score' ... only \nif one embraces the proposition that our society is appropriately viewed as divided into \nraces, making it right that an injustice rendered in the past to a black man should be \ncompensated for by discriminating against 935*935 a white.\" City of Richmond v. J.A. \nCroson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 528, 109 S.Ct. 706, 740, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in the judgment). \nAs a result of its diligent efforts in this case, the district court concluded that the law school \nmay continue to impose racial preferences. See Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F.Supp. 551 \n(W.D.Tex.1994). In No. 94-50664, we reverse and remand, concluding that the law school \nmay not use race as a factor in law school admissions. Further, we instruct the court to \nreconsider the issue of damages in accordance with the legal standards we now explain. In \nNo. 94-50569, regarding the denial of intervention by two black student groups, we dismiss \nthe appeal for want of jurisdiction. \n\nI. \nA. \nThe University of Texas School of Law is one of the nation's leading law schools, \nconsistently ranking in the top twenty. See, e.g., America's Best Graduate Schools, U.S. \nNEWS & WORLD REPORT Mar. 20, 1995, at 84 (national survey ranking of seventeenth). \nAccordingly, admission to the law school is fiercely competitive, with over 4,000 applicants a \nyear competing to be among the approximately 900 offered admission to achieve an \nentering class of about 500 students. Many of these applicants have some of the highest \ngrades and test scores in the country. \nNumbers are therefore paramount for admission. In the early 1990's, the law school largely \nbased its initial admissions decisions upon an applicant's so-called Texas Index (\"TI\") \nnumber, a composite of undergraduate grade point average (\"GPA\") and Law School \nAptitude Test (\"LSAT\") score.[1] The law school used this number as a matter of \nadministrative convenience in order to rank candidates and to predict, roughly, one's \nprobability of success in law school. Moreover, the law school relied heavily upon such \nnumbers to estimate the number of offers of admission it needed to make in order to fill its \nfirst-year class. \nOf course, the law school did not rely upon numbers alone. The admissions office \nnecessarily exercised judgment in interpreting the individual scores of applicants, taking into \nconsideration factors such as the strength of a student's undergraduate education, the \ndifficulty of his major, and significant trends in his own grades and the undergraduate \ngrades at his respective college (such as grade inflation). Admissions personnel also \nconsidered what qualities each applicant might bring to his law school class. Thus, the law \nschool could consider an applicant's background, life experiences, and outlook. Not \nsurprisingly, these hard-to-quantify factors were especially significant for marginal \ncandidates.[2] \nBecause of the large number of applicants and potential admissions factors, the TI's \nadministrative usefulness was its ability to sort candidates. For the class entering in 1992 — \nthe admissions group at issue in this case — the law school placed the typical applicant in \none of three categories according to his TI scores: \"presumptive admit,\" \"presumptive \ndeny,\" or a middle \"discretionary zone.\" An applicant's TI category determined how \nextensive a review his application would receive. \nMost, but not all, applicants in the presumptive admit category received offers of 936*936 \nadmission with little review. Professor Stanley Johanson, the Chairman of the Admissions \nCommittee, or Dean Laquita Hamilton, the Assistant Dean for Admissions, reviewed these \nfiles and downgraded only five to ten percent to the discretionary zone because of \nweaknesses in their applications, generally a noncompetitive major or a weak \nundergraduate education. \nApplicants in the presumptive denial category also received little consideration. Similarly, \nthese files would be reviewed by one or two professors, who could upgrade them if they \n\nbelieved that the TI score did not adequately reflect potential to compete at the law school. \nOtherwise, the applicant was rejected. \nApplications in the middle range were subjected to the most extensive scrutiny. For all \napplicants other than blacks and Mexican Americans, the files were bundled into stacks of \nthirty, which were given to admissions subcommittees consisting of three members of the \nfull admissions committee. Each subcommittee member, in reviewing the thirty files, could \ncast a number of votes — typically from nine to eleven[3]— among the thirty files. Subject to \nthe chairman's veto, if a candidate received two or three votes, he received an offer; if he \ngarnered one vote, he was put on the waiting list; those with no votes were denied \nadmission. \nBlacks and Mexican Americans were treated differently from other candidates, however. \nFirst, compared to whites and non-preferred minorities,[4] the TI ranges that were used to \nplace them into the three admissions categories were lowered to allow the law school to \nconsider and admit more of them. In March 1992, for example, the presumptive TI \nadmission score for resident whites and non-preferred minorities was 199.[5] Mexican \nAmericans and blacks needed a TI of only 189 to be presumptively admitted.[6] The \ndifference in the presumptive-deny ranges is even more striking. The presumptive denial \nscore for \"nonminorities\" was 192; the same score for blacks and Mexican Americans was \n179. \nWhile these cold numbers may speak little to those unfamiliar with the pool of applicants, \nthe results demonstrate that the difference in the two ranges was dramatic. According to the \nlaw school, 1992 resident white applicants had a mean GPA of 3.53 and an LSAT of 164. \nMexican Americans scored 3.27 and 158; blacks scored 3.25 and 157. The category of \n\"other minority\" achieved a 937*937 3.56 and 160.[7] \nThese disparate standards greatly affected a candidate's chance of admission. For \nexample, by March 1992, because the presumptive denial score for whites was a TI of 192 \nor lower, and the presumptive admit TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a minority \ncandidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would be admitted, even though his \nscore was considerably below[8] the level at which a white candidate almost certainly would \nbe rejected. Out of the pool of resident applicants who fell within this range (189-192 \ninclusive), 100% of blacks and 90% of Mexican Americans, but only 6% of whites, were \noffered admission.[9] \nThe stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet an \"aspiration\" of admitting a \nclass consisting of 10% Mexican Americans and 5% blacks, proportions roughly \ncomparable to the percentages of those races graduating from Texas colleges. The law \nschool found meeting these \"goals\" difficult, however, because of uncertain acceptance \nrates and the variable quality of the applicant pool.[10] In 1992, for example, the entering \nclass contained 41 blacks and 55 Mexican Americans, respectively 8% and 10.7% of the \nclass. \nIn addition to maintaining separate presumptive TI levels for minorities and whites, the law \nschool ran a segregated application evaluation process. Upon receiving an application form, \nthe school color-coded it according to race. If a candidate failed to designate his race, he \n\nwas presumed to be in a nonpreferential category. Thus, race was always an overt part of \nthe review of any applicant's file. \nThe law school reviewed minority candidates within the applicable discretionary range \ndifferently from whites. Instead of being evaluated and compared by one of the various \ndiscretionary zone subcommittees, black and Mexican American applicants' files were \nreviewed by a minority subcommittee of three, which would meet and discuss every minority \ncandidate. Thus, each of these candidates' files could get extensive review and discussion. \nAnd while the minority subcommittee reported summaries of files to the admissions \ncommittee as a whole, the minority subcommittee's decisions were \"virtually final.\" \n938*938 Finally, the law school maintained segregated waiting lists, dividing applicants by \nrace and residence. Thus, even many of those minority applicants who were not admitted \ncould be set aside in \"minority-only\" waiting lists. Such separate lists apparently helped the \nlaw school maintain a pool of potentially acceptable, but marginal, minority candidates.[11] \nB. \nCheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David Rogers (the \"plaintiffs\") \napplied for admission to the 1992 entering law school class. All four were white residents of \nTexas and were rejected. \nThe plaintiffs were considered as discretionary zone candidates.[12] Hopwood, with a GPA of \n3.8 and an LSAT of 39 (equivalent to a three-digit LSAT of 160), had a TI of 199, a score \nbarely within the presumptive-admit category for resident whites, which was 199 and up. \nShe was dropped into the discretionary zone for resident whites (193 to 198), however, \nbecause Johanson decided her educational background overstated the strength of her \nGPA. Carvell, Elliott, and Rogers had TI's of 197, at the top end of that discretionary zone. \nTheir applications were reviewed by admissions subcommittees, and each received one or \nno vote. \nII. \nThe plaintiffs sued primarily under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment; they also claimed derivative statutory violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and \n1983 and of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (\"title VI\").[13] The \nplaintiffs' central claim is that they were subjected to unconstitutional racial discrimination by \nthe law school's evaluation of their admissions applications. They sought injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief and compensatory and punitive damages. \nAfter a bench trial, the district court held that the school had violated the plaintiffs' equal \nprotection rights. 861 F.Supp. at 579. The plaintiffs' victory was pyrrhic at best, however, as \nthe court refused to enjoin the law school from using race in admissions decisions or to \ngrant damages beyond a one-dollar nominal award to each plaintiff. The district court, \nhowever, did grant declaratory relief and ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed to apply again \nwithout paying the requisite fee. Id. at 583. \n\nThe district court began by recognizing the proper constitutional standard under which to \nevaluate the admissions program: strict scrutiny. Id. at 568. As it was undisputed that the \nschool had treated applicants disparately based upon the color of their skin, the court asked \nwhether the law school process (1) served a compelling government interest and (2) was \nnarrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal. Under the first prong of the test, the court \nheld that two of the law school's five proffered reasons met constitutional muster: (1) \n\"obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student \nbody\" and (2) \"the objective of overcoming past effects of discrimination.\" Id. at 571. \nSignificantly, on the second justification, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the \nanalysis of past discrimination should be limited to that of the law school; instead, the court \nheld that the State of Texas's \"institutions of higher education are inextricably linked to the \nprimary and secondary 939*939 schools in the system.\" Id.[14] Accordingly, the court found \nthat Texas's long history of racially discriminatory practices in its primary and secondary \nschools in its not-too-distant past had the following present effects at UT law: \"the law \nschool's lingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with prospective \nstudents, as a `white' school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the student body; and \nsome perception that the law school is a hostile environment for minorities.\" Id. at 572. The \ncourt also noted that \"were the Court to limit its review to the University of Texas, the Court \nwould still find a `strong evidentiary basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary.'\" \nId. (citation omitted). \nThe court next evaluated whether the Texas program was narrowly tailored to further these \ngoals. Id. at 573. Applying a four-factor test devised by the Supreme Court, the court held \nonly part of the 1992 admissions scheme unconstitutional. Those parts that gave minorities \na \"plus,\" that is, the component of the admissions program that treated candidates' TI \nscores differently based upon race, was upheld. Id. at 578. \nThe court held, however, that differential treatment was not allowed where candidates of \ndifferent races were not compared at some point in the admission process. Thus, the court \nstruck down the school's use of separate admissions committees for applications in the \ndiscretionary zone, id. at 578-79, and in dictum speculated that presumptive denial lines \nwould not pass muster, as many white candidates would get no review, while similarly \nsituated minorities would, id. at 576 n. 71. \nThough it declared that the law school's 1992 admissions program violated the plaintiffs' \nequal protection rights, the court granted little relief. First, the court did not order that the \nplaintiffs be admitted to the law school. Instead, it used what it saw as analogous title VII \ncaselaw on burden-shifting to hold that while the state had committed a constitutional \nviolation, the plaintiffs had the ultimate burden of proving damages. Id. at 579-80. The court \nthen found that the defendants had proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for \ndenying the plaintiffs admission and that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of showing \nthat they would have been admitted but for the unlawful system. Id. at 582. \nMoreover, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to prospective injunctive relief, \nbecause \"of the law school's voluntary change to a procedure, which on paper and from the \ntestimony, appears to remedy the defects the Court has found in the 1992 procedure.\" Id.[15] \nTo pass muster under the court's reasoning, the law school simply had to have one \n\ncommittee that at one time during the process reviewed all applications and did not \nestablish separate TI numbers to define the presumptive denial categories. In other words, \nif the law school applied the same academic standards, but had commingled the minority \nreview in the discretionary zone with the review of whites, its program would not have been \nstruck down. The same admissions result would occur, but the process would be \"fair.\" Id. \nFinally, the court determined that the only appropriate relief was a declaratory judgment and \nan order allowing the plaintiffs to reapply to the school without charge. Id. at 582-83. No \ncompensatory or punitive damages, the court reasoned, could be awarded where the \nplaintiffs had proven no harm. Moreover, the court reasoned that as the law school had \npromised to change its admissions program by abandoning the two-committee system, no \nprospective injunctive relief was justified. \nIII. \nThe central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause \"is to prevent the States from \npurposefully discriminating between individuals on the basis of race.\" Shaw v. 940*940 \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, ___, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2824, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993) (citing Washington \nv. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976)). It seeks \nultimately to render the issue of race irrelevant in governmental decisionmaking. See \nPalmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 1881-82, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984) (\"A \ncore purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally \nimposed discrimination.\") (footnote omitted). \nAccordingly, discrimination based upon race is highly suspect. \"Distinctions between \ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people \nwhose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,\" and \"racial discriminations are \nin most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited....\" Hirabayashi v. United States, \n320 U.S. 81, 100, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 1385, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943). Hence, \"[p]referring members \nof any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own \nsake. This the Constitution forbids.\" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 307, \n98 S.Ct. 2733, 2757, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.); see also Loving v. \nVirginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967); Brown v. Board of \nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 493-94, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691-92, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). These equal \nprotection maxims apply to all races. Adarand Constructors v. Peña, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 \nS.Ct. 2097, 2111, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995). \nIn order to preserve these principles, the Supreme Court recently has required that any \ngovernmental action that expressly distinguishes between persons on the basis of race be \nheld to the most exacting scrutiny. See, e.g., id. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2113; Loving, 388 U.S. \nat 11, 87 S.Ct. at 1823. Furthermore, there is now absolutely no doubt that courts are to \nemploy strict scrutiny[16] when evaluating all racial classifications, including those \ncharacterized by their proponents as \"benign\" or \"remedial.\"[17] \nStrict scrutiny is necessary because the mere labeling of a classification by the government \nas \"benign\" or \"remedial\" is meaningless. As Justice O'Connor indicated in Croson: \n\nAbsent searching judicial inquiry into the justifications for such race-based measures, there \nis simply no way of determining what classifications are \"benign\" or \"remedial\" and what \nclassifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial \npolitics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by \nassuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a \nhighly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen \"fit\" this compelling goal \nso closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was \nillegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype. \nId. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at 721 (plurality opinion). \nUnder the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions: (1) Does the racial classification \nserve a compelling government interest, and (2) is it narrowly tailored to the achievement of \nthat goal? Adarand, ___ U.S. at ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2111, 2117. As the Adarand Court \nemphasized, strict scrutiny ensures that \"courts will consistently 941*941 give racial \nclassifications ... detailed examination both as to ends and as to means.\" Id.[18] \nFinally, when evaluating the proffered governmental interest for the specific racial \nclassification, to decide whether the program in question narrowly achieves that interest, we \nmust recognize that \"the rights created by ... the Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, \nguaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights.\" Shelley v. \nKraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 22, 68 S.Ct. 836, 846, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948).[19] Thus, the Court \nconsistently has rejected arguments conferring benefits on a person based solely upon his \nmembership in a specific class of persons.[20] \nWith these general principles of equal protection in mind, we turn to the specific issue of \nwhether the law school's consideration of race as a factor in admissions violates the Equal \nProtection Clause. The district court found both a compelling remedial and a non-remedial \njustification for the practice. \nFirst, the court approved of the non-remedial goal of having a diverse student body, \nreasoning that \"obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically \ndiverse student body remains a sufficiently compelling interest to support the use of racial \nclassifications.\" 861 F.Supp. at 571. Second, the court determined that the use of racial \nclassifications could be justified as a remedy for the \"present effects at the law school of \npast discrimination in both the University of Texas system and the Texas educational \nsystem as a whole.\" Id. at 573. \nA. \n1. \nJustice Powell's separate opinion in Bakke provided the original impetus for recognizing \ndiversity as a compelling state interest in higher education. In that case, Allan Bakke, a \nwhite male, was denied admission to the Medical School of the University of California at \nDavis, a state-run institution. Claiming that the State had discriminated against him \nimpermissibly because it operated two separate admissions programs for the medical \n\nschool, he brought suit under the state constitution, title VI, and the Equal Protection \nClause. \nUnder the medical school's admissions system, the white applicants, who comprised the \nmajority of the prospective students, applied through the general admissions program. A \nspecial admissions program was reserved for members of \"minority groups\" or groups \ndesignated as \"economically and/or educationally disadvantaged.\" The university set aside \nsixteen of the one hundred positions in the entering class for candidates from the special \nprogram. \nThe California Supreme Court struck down the program on equal protection grounds, \nenjoined any consideration of race in the admissions process, and ordered that Bakke be \nadmitted. The United States Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in an \nopinion announced by Justice Powell. 438 U.S. at 271-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2738-39 (opinion of \nPowell, J.). The Court reached no consensus on a justification for its result, however. Six \nJustices filed opinions, none of which garnered more than four votes (including 942*942 the \nwriter's). The two major opinions — one four-Justice opinion by Justices Brennan, White, \nMarshall, and Blackmun and one by Justice Stevens in which Chief Justice Burger and \nJustices Stewart and Rehnquist joined — reflected completely contrary views of the law. \nWhile Justice Powell found the program unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause \nand affirmed Bakke's admission, Justice Stevens declined to reach the constitutional issue \nand upheld Bakke's admission under title VI. Justice Powell also concluded that the \nCalifornia Supreme Court's proscription of the consideration of race in admissions could not \nbe sustained. This became the judgment of the Court, as the four-Justice opinion by Justice \nBrennan opined that racial classifications designed to serve remedial purposes should \nreceive only intermediate scrutiny. These Justices would have upheld the admissions \nprogram under this intermediate scrutiny, as it served the substantial and benign purpose of \nremedying past societal discrimination. \nHence, Justice Powell's opinion has appeared to represent the \"swing vote,\" and though, in \nsignificant part, see id. at 272 n. *, 98 S.Ct. at 2738, it was joined by no other Justice, it has \nplayed a prominent role in subsequent debates concerning the impact of Bakke.[21] In the \npresent case, the significance of Justice Powell's opinion is its discussion of compelling \nstate interests under the Equal Protection Clause. See id. at 305-15, 98 S.Ct. at 2756-61. \nSpecifically, after Justice Powell recognized that the proper level of review for racial \nclassifications is strict scrutiny, id. at 305-06, 98 S.Ct. at 2756-57, he rejected and accepted \nrespective justifications for the school's program as \"substantial enough to support the use \nof a suspect classification,\" id. at 306, 98 S.Ct. at 2757. \nNotably, because the first step in reviewing an affirmative action program is a determination \nof the state's interests at stake,[22] it often is the determinative step. Justice Powell outlined \nthe four state interests proffered by the Bakke defendants: \nThe special admissions program purports to serve the purposes of: (i) \"reducing the historic \ndeficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical \nprofession,\"; (ii) countering the effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the number \n\nof physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the \neducational benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student body. \nId. at 305-06, 98 S.Ct. at 2756-57 (emphasis added, citation and footnote omitted). \nJustice Powell reasoned that the second and third justifications — remedying societal \ndiscrimination and providing role models — were never appropriate.[23] He determined that \nany remedial justification was limited to eliminating \"identified discrimination\" with \"disabling \neffects.\" Id. at 307, 98 S.Ct. at 2757 (citing the school desegregation cases). He specifically \nemphasized that a particularized finding of a constitutional or statutory violation must be \npresent before a remedy is justified. He determined not only that such findings were not \npresent in Bakke, but that the medical school was not even in a position to make such \nfindings. Id. at 309, 98 S.Ct. at 2757-58. \nJustice Powell further reasoned that diversity is a sufficient justification for limited 943*943 \nracial classification. Id. at 311-16, 98 S.Ct. at 2759-62. \"[The attainment of a diverse student \nbody] clearly is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.\" Id. \nat 311, 98 S.Ct. at 2759. He argued that diversity of minorities' viewpoints furthered \n\"academic freedom,\" an interest under the Constitution. While acknowledging that \n\"academic freedom\" does not appear as a constitutional right, he argued that it had \"long ... \nbeen viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.\" Id. at 312, 98 S.Ct. at 2759.[24] \nJustice Powell presented this \"special concern\" as in tension with the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \"Thus, in arguing that its universities must be accorded the right to select \nthose students who will contribute the most to the `robust exchange of ideas,' petitioner \ninvokes a countervailing constitutional interest, that of the First Amendment.\" Id. at 313, 98 \nS.Ct. at 2760.[25] The Justice then concluded that \n[a]n otherwise qualified medical student with a particular background — whether it be \nethnic, geographic, culturally advantaged or disadvantaged — may bring to a professional \nschool of medicine experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its student \nbody and better equip its graduates to render with understanding their vital service to \nhumanity. \nId. at 314, 98 S.Ct. at 2760 (footnote omitted). Justice Powell therefore approved of a \nconsideration of ethnicity as \"one element in a range of factors a university properly may \nconsider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.\" Id. \nThe next step for Justice Powell was to decide whether the medical school's program was \nnecessary to further the goal of diversity. He said it was not. As the program made race the \nonly determining factor for a certain number of the open spots that had been set aside, it did \nnot further full diversity but only a conception of that term limited to race. \nJustice Powell speculated that a program in which \"race or ethnic background may be \ndeemed a `plus' in a particular applicant's file, yet does not insulate the individual from \ncomparison with all the other candidates for the available seats,\" might pass muster. Id. at \n317, 98 S.Ct. at 2762. The Justice did not define what he meant by a \"plus,\" but he did write \nthat a \"plus\" program would be one in which an \n\napplicant who loses out to another candidate receiving a `plus' on the basis of ethnic \nbackground will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply \nbecause he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would only mean that his \ncombined qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors, did not \noutweigh those of another applicant. His qualifications would have been weighted fairly and \ncompetitively, and he would have no basis to complaint of unequal treatment under the \nFourteenth Amendment. \nId. at 318, 98 S.Ct. at 2762. \nUnder this conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, a program that considered a host of \nfactors that include race would be constitutional, even if an applicant's race \"tipped the \nscales\" among qualified applicants. What a school could not do is to refuse to compare \napplicants of different races or establish a strict quota on the basis of race. In sum, Justice \nPowell found the school's program to be an unconstitutional 944*944 \"quota\" system, but he \nintimated that the Constitution would allow schools to continue to use race in a wide-ranging \nmanner. \n2. \nHere, the plaintiffs argue that diversity is not a compelling governmental interest under \nsuperseding Supreme Court precedent. Instead, they believe that the Court finally has \nrecognized that only the remedial use of race is compelling. In the alternative, the plaintiffs \nassert that the district court misapplied Justice Powell's Bakke standard, as the law school \nprogram here uses race as a strong determinant rather than a mere \"plus\" factor and, in any \ncase, the preference is not narrowly applied. The law school maintains, on the other hand, \nthat Justice Powell's formulation in Bakke is law and must be followed — at least in the \ncontext of higher education. \nWe agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for \nthe purpose of achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the \nFourteenth Amendment. Justice Powell's argument in Bakke garnered only his own vote \nand has never represented the view of a majority of the Court in Bakke or any other case. \nMoreover, subsequent Supreme Court decisions regarding education state that non-\nremedial state interests will never justify racial classifications. Finally, the classification of \npersons on the basis of race for the purpose of diversity frustrates, rather than facilitates, \nthe goals of equal protection. \nJustice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on this issue. While he announced \nthe judgment, no other Justice joined in that part of the opinion discussing the diversity \nrationale. In Bakke, the word \"diversity\" is mentioned nowhere except in Justice Powell's \nsingle-Justice opinion. In fact, the four-Justice opinion, which would have upheld the special \nadmissions program under intermediate scrutiny, implicitly rejected Justice Powell's \nposition. See 438 U.S. at 326 n. 1, 98 S.Ct. at 2766 n. 1 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and \nBlackmun JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting) (\"We also agree with Mr. \nJustice POWELL that a plan like the \"Harvard\" plan ... is constitutional under our approach, \nat least so long as the use of race to achieve an integrated student body is necessitated by \nthe lingering effects of past discrimination.\") (emphasis added). Justice Stevens declined to \n\ndiscuss the constitutional issue. See id. at 412, 98 S.Ct. at 2810 (Stevens, J., concurring in \nthe judgment in part and dissenting in part). \nThus, only one Justice concluded that race could be used solely for the reason of obtaining \na heterogenous student body. As the Adarand Court states, the Bakke Court did not \nexpress a majority view and is questionable as binding precedent. ___ U.S. at ___, 115 \nS.Ct. at 2109 (\"The Court's failure in Bakke ... left unresolved the proper analysis for \nremedial race-based government action.\"). \nSince Bakke, the Court has accepted the diversity rationale only once in its cases dealing \nwith race. Significantly, however, in that case, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal \nCommunications Comm'n, 497 U.S. 547, 564-65, 110 S.Ct. 2997, 3008-09, 111 L.Ed.2d \n445 (1990), the five-Justice majority relied upon an intermediate scrutiny standard of review \nto uphold the federal program seeking diversity in the ownership of broadcasting facilities. In \nAdarand, ___ U.S. at ___-___, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13, the Court squarely rejected \nintermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for racial classifications, and Metro \nBroadcasting is now specifically overruled to the extent that it was in conflict with this \nholding. Id. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2113. No case since Bakke has accepted diversity as a \ncompelling state interest under a strict scrutiny analysis. \nIndeed, recent Supreme Court precedent shows that the diversity interest will not satisfy \nstrict scrutiny. Foremost, the Court appears to have decided that there is essentially only \none compelling state interest to justify racial classifications: remedying past wrongs. In \nCroson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at 722 (plurality opinion), the Court flatly stated that \n\"[u]nless [racial classifications] are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact \npromote notions of 945*945 racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility.\" \n(emphasis added).[26] \nJustice O'Connor, in her Adarand-vindicated dissent in Metro Broadcasting, joined by \nJustices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Kennedy, explained this position: \nModern equal protection has recognized only one [compelling state] interest: remedying the \neffects of racial discrimination. The interest in increasing the diversity of broadcast \nviewpoints is clearly not a compelling interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial, \nand too unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial classifications. \n497 U.S. at 612, 110 S.Ct. at 3034 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). Indeed, the majority in Metro \nBroadcasting had not claimed otherwise and decided only that such an interest was \n\"important.\" Justice Thomas, who joined the Court after Metro Broadcasting was decided, \nroundly condemned \"benign\" discrimination in his recent Adarand opinion, in which he \nsuggests that the diversity rationale is inadequate to meet strict scrutiny. See Adarand, ___ \nU.S. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in \njudgment).[27] \nIn short, there has been no indication from the Supreme Court, other than Justice Powell's \nlonely opinion in Bakke, that the state's interest in diversity constitutes a compelling \njustification for governmental race-based discrimination. Subsequent Supreme Court \ncaselaw strongly suggests, in fact, that it is not. \n\nWithin the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions \nfor diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal \nprotection. Diversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a \ngroup, rather than as individuals. It may further remedial purposes but, just as likely, may \npromote improper racial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility. \nThe use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply achieves a student body that \nlooks different. Such a criterion is no more rational on its own terms than would be choices \nbased upon the physical size or blood type of applicants. Thus, the Supreme Court has long \nheld that governmental actors cannot justify their decisions solely because of race. See, \ne.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 496, 109 S.Ct. at 723 (plurality opinion); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307, \n98 S.Ct. at 2757 (opinion of Powell, J.). \nAccordingly, we see the caselaw as sufficiently established that the use of ethnic diversity \nsimply to achieve racial heterogeneity, 946*946 even as part of the consideration of a \nnumber of factors, is unconstitutional. Were we to decide otherwise, we would contravene \nprecedent that we are not authorized to challenge. \nWhile the use of race per se is proscribed, state-supported schools may reasonably \nconsider a host of factors — some of which may have some correlation with race — in \nmaking admissions decisions. The federal courts have no warrant to intrude on those \nexecutive and legislative judgments unless the distinctions intrude on specific provisions of \nfederal law or the Constitution. \nA university may properly favor one applicant over another because of his ability to play the \ncello, make a downfield tackle, or understand chaos theory. An admissions process may \nalso consider an applicant's home state or relationship to school alumni. Law schools \nspecifically may look at things such as unusual or substantial extracurricular activities in \ncollege, which may be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades. Schools may even \nconsider factors such as whether an applicant's parents attended college or the applicant's \neconomic and social background.[28] \nFor this reason, race often is said to be justified in the diversity context, not on its own \nterms, but as a proxy for other characteristics that institutions of higher education value but \nthat do not raise similar constitutional concerns.[29] Unfortunately, this approach simply \nreplicates the very harm that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed to eliminate. \nThe assumption is that a certain individual possesses characteristics by virtue of being a \nmember of a certain racial group. This assumption, however, does not withstand scrutiny. \n\"[T]he use of a racial characteristic to establish a presumption that the individual also \npossesses other, and socially relevant, characteristics, exemplifies, encourages, and \nlegitimizes the mode of thought and behavior that underlies most prejudice and bigotry in \nmodern America.\" Richard A. Posner, The DeFunis Case and the Constitutionality of \nPreferential Treatment of Racial Minorities, 1974 SUP.CT.REV. 12 (1974). \nTo believe that a person's race controls his point of view is to stereotype him. The Supreme \nCourt, however, \"has remarked a number of times, in slightly different contexts, that it is \nincorrect and legally inappropriate to impute to women and minorities `a different attitude \n\nabout such issues as the federal budget, school prayer, voting, and foreign relations.'\" \nMichael S. Paulsen, Reverse Discrimination and Law School Faculty Hiring: The \nUndiscovered Opinion, 71 TEX.L.REV. 993, 1000 (1993) (quoting Roberts v. United States \nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627-28, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984)). \"Social \nscientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior reflect their background, but the \nConstitution provides that the government may not allocate benefits or burdens among \nindividuals based on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they act or \nthink.\" Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 3029 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).[30] \nInstead, individuals, with their own conceptions of life, further diversity of viewpoint. Plaintiff \nHopwood is a fair example of an applicant with a unique background. She is the now-thirty-\ntwo-year-old wife of a member of the Armed Forces stationed in San Antonio and, more \nsignificantly, is raising a severely handicapped child. Her circumstance would bring a \ndifferent perspective to the law school. The school might consider this an 947*947 \nadvantage to her in the application process, or it could decide that her family situation would \nbe too much of a burden on her academic performance. \nWe do not opine on which way the law school should weigh Hopwood's qualifications; we \nonly observe that \"diversity\" can take many forms. To foster such diversity, state universities \nand law schools and other governmental entities must scrutinize applicants individually, \nrather than resorting to the dangerous proxy of race.[31] \nThe Court also has recognized that government's use of racial classifications serves to \nstigmatize. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 \nL.Ed. 873 (1954) (observing that classification on the basis of race \"generates a feeling of \ninferiority\"). While one might argue that the stigmatization resulting from so-called \"benign\" \nracial classifications is not as harmful as that arising from invidious ones,[32] the current \nCourt has now retreated from the idea that so-called benign and invidious classifications \nmay be distinguished.[33] As the plurality in Croson warned, \"[c]lassifications based on race \ncarry the danger of stigmatic harm. Unless they are reserved for remedial settings, they \nmay in fact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to the politics of racial hostility.\" 488 \nU.S. at 493, 109 S.Ct. at 722.[34] \nFinally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the ultimate goal of the Fourteenth \n948*948 Amendment: the end of racially-motivated state action. Justice Powell's conception \nof race as a \"plus\" factor would allow race always to be a potential factor in admissions \ndecisionmaking. While Justice Blackmun recognized the tension inherent in using race-\nconscious remedies to achieve a raceneutral society, he nevertheless accepted it as \nnecessary. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 405, 98 S.Ct. at 2806. Several Justices who, unlike Justices \nPowell and Blackmun, are still on the Court, have now renounced toleration of this tension, \nhowever. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 495, 109 S.Ct. at 722 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) \n(\"The dissent's watered down version of equal protection review effectively assures that \nrace will always be relevant in American life, and that the `ultimate goal' of `eliminat[ing] \nentirely from government decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human being's race ... \nwill never be achieved.\") (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 320, 106 S.Ct. at 1871 (Stevens, J., \ndissenting)).[35] \n\nIn sum, the use of race to achieve a diverse student body, whether as a proxy for \npermissible characteristics, simply cannot be a state interest compelling enough to meet the \nsteep standard of strict scrutiny.[36] These latter factors may, in fact, turn out to be \nsubstantially correlated with race, but the key is that race itself not be taken into account. \nThus, that portion of the district court's opinion upholding the diversity rationale is reversibly \nflawed.[37] \nB. \nWe now turn to the district court's determination that \"the remedial purpose of the law \nschool's affirmative action program is a compelling government objective.\" 861 F.Supp. at \n573. The plaintiffs argue that the court erred by finding that the law school could employ \nracial criteria to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in Texas's primary and \nsecondary schools. The plaintiffs contend that the proper unit for analysis is the law school, \nand the state has shown no recognizable present effects of the law school's past \ndiscrimination. The law school, in response, notes Texas's well-documented history of \ndiscrimination in education and argues that its effects continue today at the law school, both \nin the level of educational attainment of the average minority applicant and in the school's \nreputation. \nIn contrast to its approach to the diversity rationale, a majority of the Supreme Court has \nheld that a state actor may racially classify where it has a \"strong basis in the evidence for \nits conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Croson, 488 U.S. 949*949 at 500, 109 \nS.Ct. at 730 (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277, 106 S.Ct. at 1849 (plurality opinion)). \nGenerally, \"[i]n order to justify an affirmative action program, the State must show there are \n`present effects of past discrimination.'\" Hopwood v. Texas (\"Hopwood I\"),[38] 21 F.3d 603, \n605 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (quoting Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 57 (4th \nCir.1992), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 2001, 131 L.Ed.2d 1002 (1995)); see also \nWygant, 476 U.S. at 280, 106 S.Ct. at 1850 (opining that \"in order to remedy the effects of \nprior discrimination, it may be necessary to take race into account\") (opinion of Powell, \nJ.).[39] \nBecause a state does not have a compelling state interest in remedying the present effects \nof past societal discrimination, however, we must examine the district court's legal \ndetermination that the relevant governmental entity is the system of education within the \nstate as a whole. Moreover, we also must review the court's identification of what types of \npresent effects of past discrimination, if proven, would be sufficient under strict scrutiny \nreview. Finally, where the state actor puts forth a remedial justification for its racial \nclassifications, the district court must make a \"factual determination\" as to whether remedial \naction is necessary. Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277-78, 106 S.Ct. at 1848-49. We review such \nfactual rulings for clear error. \n1. \nThe Supreme Court has \"insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the \ngovernmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to \nremedy such discrimination.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274, 106 S.Ct. at 1847 (plurality opinion \n\nof Powell, J.) (citing Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, \n53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977)).[40] In Wygant, the Court analyzed a collective bargaining agreement \nbetween a school board and a teacher's union that allowed the board to give minorities \npreferential treatment in the event of layoffs. A plurality rejected the theory that such a \nprogram was justified because it 950*950 provided minority role models. Id. at 274-77, 106 \nS.Ct. at 1847-49 (plurality opinion). Such a claim was based upon remedying \"societal \ndiscrimination,\" a rationale the Court consistently has rejected as a basis for affirmative \naction. Accordingly, the state's use of remedial racial classifications is limited to the harm \ncaused by a specific state actor.[41] \nMoreover, the plurality in Wygant held that before a state actor properly could implement \nsuch a plan, it \"must ensure that ... it has convincing evidence that remedial action is \nwarranted.\" Id. at 277, 106 S.Ct. at 1848. Accord id. at 289, 106 S.Ct. at 1854-55 \n(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The plurality felt that \"[i]n the \nabsence of particularized findings, a court could uphold remedies that are ageless in their \nreach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future.\" Id. at 276, 106 S.Ct. at \n1848. \nThe Croson Court further discussed how to identify the relevant past discriminator. Writing \nfor the Court, Justice O'Connor struck down a minority business set-aside program \nimplemented by the City of Richmond and justified on remedial grounds. While the district \ncourt opined that sufficient evidence had been found by the city to believe that such a \nprogram was necessary to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in the \nconstruction industry, the Court held: \nLike the \"role model\" theory employed in Wygant, a generalized assertion that there had \nbeen past discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance for a legislative body to \ndetermine the precise scope of the injury it seeks to remedy. It `has no logical stopping \npoint.' Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 [106 S.Ct. at 1848] (plurality opinion). `Relief' for such an ill-\ndefined wrong could extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded to [minority \nbusinesses] in Richmond mirrored the percentage of minorities in the population as a whole. \n488 U.S. at 498, 109 S.Ct. at 724.[42] The Court refused to accept indicia of past \ndiscrimination in anything but \"the Richmond construction industry.\" Id. at 505, 109 S.Ct. at \n728. \nIn addition, in a passage of particular significance to the instant case, the Court analogized \nthe employment contractor situation to that of higher education and noted that \"[l]ike claims \nthat discrimination in primary and secondary schooling justifies a rigid racial preference in \nmedical school admissions, an amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination in \na particular industry cannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota.\" Id. at 499, 109 \nS.Ct. at 724. Such claims were based upon \"sheer speculation\" about how many minorities \nwould be in the contracting business absent past discrimination. Id. \nApplying the teachings of Croson and Wygant, we conclude that the district court erred in \nexpanding the remedial justification to reach all public education within the State of Texas. \nThe Supreme Court repeatedly has warned that the use of racial remedies must be carefully \nlimited, and a remedy reaching all education within a state addresses a putative injury that \n\nis vague and amorphous. It has \"no logical stopping point.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275, 106 \nS.Ct. at 1847 (plurality opinion). \nThe district court's holding employs no viable limiting principle. If a state can \"remedy\" the \npresent effects of past discrimination in its primary and secondary schools, it also would be \nallowed to award broad-based preferences in hiring, government contracts, licensing, and \nany other state activity that in some way is affected by the educational attainment of the \napplicants. This very argument was made in Croson and rejected: \nThe \"evidence\" relied upon by the dissent, history of school desegregation in Richmond and \nnumerous congressional reports, does little to define the scope of any injury 951*951 to \nminority contractors in Richmond or the necessary remedy. The factors relied upon by the \ndissent could justify a preference of any size or duration. \n488 U.S. at 505, 109 S.Ct. at 728. The defendants' argument here is equally expansive.[43] \nStrict scrutiny is meant to ensure that the purpose of a racial preference is remedial. Yet \nwhen one state actor begins to justify racial preferences based upon the actions of other \nstate agencies, the remedial actor's competence to determine the existence and scope of \nthe harm — and the appropriate reach of the remedy — is called into question. The school \ndesegregation cases, for example, concentrate on school districts — singular government \nunits — and the use of interdistrict remedies is strictly limited. See Missouri v. Jenkins, ___ \nU.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 2048, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 (1995); Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. \n717, 745, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3127, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974) (\"[W]ithout an interdistrict violation \nand interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional wrong calling for an interdistrict remedy.\"). \nThus, one justification for limiting the remedial powers of a state actor is that the specific \nagency involved is best able to measure the harm of its past discrimination. \nHere, however, the law school has no comparative advantage in measuring the present \neffects of discrimination in primary and secondary schools in Texas. Such a task becomes \neven more improbable where, as here, benefits are conferred on students who attended \nout-of-state or private schools for such education. Such boundless \"remedies\" raise a \nconstitutional concern beyond mere competence. In this situation, an inference is raised \nthat the program was the result of racial social engineering rather a desire to implement a \nremedy. \nNo one disputes that in the past, Texas state actors have discriminated against some \nminorities in public schools. In this sense, some lingering effects of such discrimination is \nnot \"societal,\" if that term is meant to exclude all state action. But the very program at issue \nhere shows how remedying such past wrongs may be expanded beyond any reasonable \nlimits. \nEven if, arguendo, the state is the proper government unit to scrutinize, the law school's \nadmissions program would not withstand our review. For the admissions scheme to pass \nconstitutional muster, the State of Texas, through its legislature, would have to find that past \nsegregation has present effects; it would have to determine the magnitude of those present \neffects; and it would need to limit carefully the \"plus\" given to applicants to remedy that \nharm. A broad program that sweeps in all minorities with a remedy that is in no way related \n\nto past harms cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Obviously, none of those predicates \nhas been satisfied here. \nWe further reject the proposition that the University of Texas System, rather than the law \nschool, is the appropriate governmental unit for measuring a constitutional remedy. The law \nschool operates as a functionally separate unit within the system. As with all law schools, it \nmaintains its own separate admissions program. The law school hires faculty members that \nmeet the unique requirements of a law school and has its own deans for administrative \npurposes. Thus, for much the same reason that we rejected the educational system as the \nproper measure — generally ensuring that the legally-imposed racially discriminatory \nprogram is remedial—we conclude that the University of Texas System is itself too \nexpansive an entity to scrutinize for past discrimination.[44] \n952*952 In sum, for purposes of determining whether the law school's admissions system \nproperly can act as a remedy for the present effects of past discrimination, we must identify \nthe law school as the relevant alleged past discriminator. The fact that the law school \nultimately may be subject to the directives of others, such as the board of regents, the \nuniversity president, or the legislature, does not change the fact that the relevant putative \ndiscriminator in this case is still the law school. In order for any of these entities to direct a \nracial preference program at the law school, it must be because of past wrongs at that \nschool. \n2. \nNext, the relevant governmental discriminator must prove that there are present effects of \npast discrimination of the type that justify the racial classifications at issue: \nTo have a present effect of past discrimination sufficient to justify the program, the party \nseeking to implement the program must, at a minimum, prove that the effect it proffers is \ncaused by the past discrimination and that the effect is of sufficient magnitude to justify the \nprogram. \nPodberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 \nS.Ct. 2001, 131 L.Ed.2d 1002 (1995). Moreover, as part of showing that the alleged present \neffects of past discrimination in fact justify the racial preference program at issue, the law \nschool must show that it adopted the program specifically to remedy the identified present \neffects of the past discrimination. \nHere, according to the district court: \"The evidence presented at trial indicates those effects \ninclude the law school's lingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with \nprospective students, as a \"white\" school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the \nstudent body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile environment for \nminorities.\" 861 F.Supp. at 572. Plaintiffs now argue that these three alleged effects are at \nmost examples of societal discrimination, which the Supreme Court has found not to be a \nvalid remedial basis. \"The effects must themselves be examined to see whether they were \ncaused by the past discrimination and whether they are of a type that justifies the program.\" \nPodberesky, 38 F.3d at 154. \n\nAs a legal matter, the district court erred in concluding that the first and third effects it \nidentified — bad reputation and hostile environment — were sufficient to sustain the use of \nrace in the admissions process. The Fourth Circuit examined similar arguments in \nPodberesky, a recent case that struck down the use of race-based scholarships. The \nuniversity in that case sought, in part, to justify a separate scholarship program based solely \nupon race because of the university's \"poor reputation within the African-American \ncommunity\" and because \"the atmosphere on campus [was] perceived as being hostile to \nAfrican-American students.\" Id. at 152. \nThe Podberesky court rejected the notion that either of these rationales could support the \nsingle-race scholarship program. The court reasoned that any poor reputation by the school \n\"is tied solely to knowledge of the University's discrimination before it admitted African-\nAmerican students.\" Id. at 154. The court found that \"mere knowledge of historical fact is \nnot the kind of present effect that can justify a race-exclusive remedy. If it were otherwise, \nas long as there are people 953*953 who have access to history books, there will be \nprograms such as this.\" Id. \nWe concur in the Fourth Circuit's observation that knowledge of historical fact simply cannot \njustify current racial classifications. Even if, as the defendants argue, the law school may \nhave a bad reputation in the minority community, \"[t]he case against race-based \npreferences does not rest on the sterile assumption that American society is untouched or \nunaffected by the tragic oppression of its past.\" Maryland Troopers Ass'n v. Evans, 993 \nF.2d 1072, 1079 (4th Cir.1993). \"Rather, it is the very enormity of that tragedy that lends \nresolve to the desire to never repeat it, and find a legal order in which distinctions based on \nrace shall have no place.\" Id. Moreover, we note that the law school's argument is even \nweaker than that of the university in Podberesky, as there is no dispute that the law school \nhas never had an admissions policy that excluded Mexican Americans on the basis of race. \nThe Podberesky court rejected the hostile-environment claims by observing that the \n\"effects\" — that is, racial tensions — were the result of present societal discrimination. 38 \nF.3d at 155. There was simply no showing of action by the university that contributed to any \nracial tension. Similarly, one cannot conclude that the law school's past discrimination has \ncreated any current hostile environment for minorities. While the school once did practice de \njure discrimination in denying admission to blacks, the Court in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. \n629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114 (1950), struck down the law school's program. Any other \ndiscrimination by the law school ended in the 1960's. Hopwood, 861 F.Supp. at 555. \nBy the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first program designed to recruit \nminorities, id. at 557, and it now engages in an extensive minority recruiting program that \nincludes a significant amount of scholarship money. The vast majority of the faculty, staff, \nand students at the law school had absolutely nothing to do with any discrimination that the \nlaw school practiced in the past. \nIn such a case, one cannot conclude that a hostile environment is the present effect of past \ndiscrimination. Any racial tension at the law school is most certainly the result of present \nsocietal discrimination and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than alleviated by, the overt \nand prevalent consideration of race in admissions. \n\nEven if the law school's alleged current lingering reputation in the minority community — \nand the perception that the school is a hostile environment for minorities — were \nconsidered to be the present effects of past discrimination, rather than the result of societal \ndiscrimination, they could not constitute compelling state interests justifying the use of racial \nclassifications in admissions. A bad reputation within the minority community is alleviated \nnot by the consideration of race in admissions, but by school action designed directly to \nenhance its reputation in that community. \nMinority students who are aided by the law school's racial preferences have already made \nthe decision to apply, despite the reputation. And, while prior knowledge that they will get a \n\"plus\" might make potential minorities more likely to apply, such an inducement does \nnothing, per se, to change any hostile environment. As we have noted, racial preferences, if \nanything, can compound the problem of a hostile environment.[45] \nThe law school wisely concentrates only on the second effect the district court identified: \nunderrepresentation of minorities because of past discrimination. The law school argues \nthat we should consider the prior discrimination by the State of Texas and its educational \nsystem rather than of the law school. The school contends that this prior discrimination by \nthe state had a direct effect on the educational attainment of the pool of minority applicants \nand that the discriminatory admissions program was implemented partially to discharge the \nschool's duty of eliminating the vestiges of past segregation. \nAs we have noted, the district court accepted the law school's argument that past 954*954 \ndiscrimination on the part of the Texas school system (including primary and secondary \nschools), reaching back perhaps as far as the education of the parents of today's students, \njustifies the current use of racial classifications.[46] No one disputes that Texas has a history \nof racial discrimination in education. We have already discussed, however, that the Croson \nCourt unequivocally restricted the proper scope of the remedial interest to the state actor \nthat had previously discriminated. 488 U.S. at 499, 109 S.Ct. at 724-25. The district court \nsquarely found that \"[i]n recent history, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned \ndiscrimination at the University of Texas.\" 861 F.Supp. at 572. As a result, past \ndiscrimination in education, other than at the law school, cannot justify the present \nconsideration of race in law school admissions. \nThe law school now attempts to circumvent this result by claiming that its racial preference \nprogram is really a \"State of Texas\" plan rather than a law school program. Under the law \nschool's reading of the facts, its program was the direct result of the state's negotiations \nwith what was then the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare's Office \nfor Civil Rights (\"OCR\"). To bring the Texas public higher education system into compliance \nwith title VI, the state adopted the so-called \"Texas Plan.\" \nIn light of our preceding discussion on the relevant governmental unit, this argument is \ninapposite. Even if the law school were specifically ordered to adopt a racial preference \nprogram, its implementation at the law school would have to meet the requirements of strict \nscrutiny.[47] \nMoreover, these alleged actions in the 1980's are largely irrelevant for purposes of this \nappeal. There is no indication that the Texas Plan imposed a direct obligation upon the law \n\nschool. To the contrary, the law school's admissions program was self-initiated. Moreover, \nthe current admissions program was formulated primarily in the 1990's, and the district court \ndid not hold otherwise. See 861 F.Supp. at 557 (\"Against this historical backdrop [including \nTexas's dealing with the OCR], the law school's commitment to affirmative action in the \nadmissions process evolved.\"). Thus it is no more correct to say that the State of Texas \nimplemented the program at issue than it is to assert that the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nnot the City of Richmond, was responsible for the minority set-aside program in Croson. \nThe district court also sought to find a remedial justification for the use of race and, at the \nsame time, attempted to distinguish Croson using United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, \n112 S.Ct. 2727, 120 L.Ed.2d 575 (1992). The court held that the law school had a \ncompelling interest to \"desegregate\" the school through affirmative action. \n955*955 The reliance upon Fordice is misplaced, however. The district court held that \nFordice's mandate to schools \"to eliminate every vestige of racial segregation and \ndiscrimination\" made Croson inapplicable, 861 F.Supp. at 571, and reasoned that this \nmandate includes the effects of such prior practices or policies. \nFordice does not overrule Croson. The central holding of Fordice is that a state or one of its \nsubdivisions must act to repudiate the continuing \"policies or practices\" of discrimination. \n505 U.S. at 731-32, 112 S.Ct. at 2737-38.[48] In other words, a state has an affirmative duty \nto remove policies, tied to the past, by which it continues to discriminate. The Fordice Court \ndid not address, in any way, a state actor's duty to counter the present effects of past \ndiscrimination that it did not cause.[49] \nIn sum, the law school has failed to show a compelling state interest in remedying the \npresent effects of past discrimination sufficient to maintain the use of race in its admissions \nsystem. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to examine the district court's determination \nthat the law school's admissions program was not narrowly tailored to meet the compelling \ninterests that the district court erroneously perceived.[50] \nIV. \nWhile the district court declared the admissions program unconstitutional, it granted the \nplaintiffs only limited relief. They had requested injunctive relief ordering that they be \nadmitted to law school, compensatory and punitive damages, and prospective injunctive \nrelief preventing the school from using race as a factor in admissions. \nA. \nWe must decide who bears the burden of proof on the damages issue. The district court \nrefused to order the plaintiffs' admission (or award any compensatory damages), 956*956 \nas it found that they had not met their burden of persuasion in attempting to show that they \nwould have been admitted absent the unconstitutional system. 861 F.Supp. at 579-82.[51] \nThe law school now argues that the plaintiffs had the burden of persuasion on the issue of \ndamages and that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.[52] The plaintiffs \nmaintain, as they did in the district court, that once they had shown a constitutional violation, \n\nthe burden of persuasion shifted to the school to show that the denial of admission was not \ncaused by that violation. \nThe well-established rule is that in order to collect money damages, plaintiffs must prove \nthat they have been injured. Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254-57, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1047-\n49, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). Several Supreme Court cases, however, allow for a transfer of \nburden upon proof of discrimination. See Mt. Healthy City Sch., Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, \n429 U.S. 274, 284, 97 S.Ct. 568, 574-75, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); Village of Arlington \nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563-64, \n50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977).[53] \nIn Mt. Healthy, a discharged school teacher sued for reinstatement, claiming his termination \nwas a result of comments he had made on a radio show, a violation of his First and \nFourteenth Amendment rights. The Court devised a test of \"causation\" that placed the \nburden of proving no harm on the defendant: \nInitially, ... the burden was properly placed upon the respondent to show that his conduct \nwas constitutionally protected, and that this conduct was a \"substantial factor\" — or to put it \nin other words, that it was a \"motivating factor\" in the Board's decision not to rehire him. \nRespondent having carried that burden, however, the District Court should have gone on to \ndetermine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would \nhave reached the same decision as to the respondent's reemployment even in the absence \nof the protected conduct. \n429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576. In Arlington Heights, the Court applied a similar rule where \nthe decision of a zoning board was challenged as racially discriminatory. See 429 U.S. at \n270 n. 21, 97 S.Ct. at 566 n. 21. In sum, these cases allow a defendant, who intended to \ndiscriminate or otherwise act unconstitutionally, to show that its action would have occurred \nregardless of that intent. \nCourts are split on whether the Mt. Healthy rubric applies in racial preference cases.[54] We \nconclude that the Mt. Healthy methodology is appropriate in the instant case. The Mt. \nHealthy plaintiff, like the present plaintiffs, brought a constitutional challenge, and his \ninjuries were analogous to the injuries alleged here. As we have said, the title VII burden-\nshifting scheme is designed to determine whether a violation of law has occurred. \n957*957 In this case, there is no question that a constitutional violation has occurred (as the \ndistrict court found) and that the plaintiffs were harmed thereby. See Adarand, ___ U.S. at \n___, 115 S.Ct. at 2105 (\"The injury in cases of this kind is that a `discriminatory \nclassification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.'\") (citation omitted). \nThe Mt. Healthy burden-shifting exercise simply gives the defendant law school a second \nchance of prevailing by showing that the violation was largely harmless. \nAs the district court held, to the contrary, that plaintiffs had the burden, it should revisit this \nissue in light of what we have said in both the liability and remedial portions of this \nopinion.[55] In the event that the law school is unable to show (by a preponderance of the \nevidence) that a respective plaintiff would not have been admitted to the law school under a \n\nconstitutional admissions system, the court is to award to that plaintiff any equitable and/or \nmonetary relief it deems appropriate. \nObviously, if the school proves that a plaintiff would not have gained admittance to the law \nschool under a race-blind system, that plaintiff would not be entitled to an injunction \nadmitting him to the school. On the other hand, the law school's inability to establish a \nplaintiff's non-admission — if that occurs on remand — opens a panoply of potential relief, \ndepending in part upon what course that plaintiff's career has taken since trial in mid-1994. \nIt then would be up to the district court, in its able discretion, to decide whether money \ndamages[56] can substitute for an order of immediate admission — relief that would ring \nhollow for a plaintiff for whom an education at the law school now is of little or no benefit.[57] \nAdditionally, the district court erred in holding that plaintiffs did not prove that defendants \nhad committed intentional discrimination under title VI. \"Intentional discrimination,\" as used \nin this context, means that a plaintiff must prove \"that the governmental actor, in adopting or \nemploying the challenged practices or undertaking the challenged action, intended to treat \nsimilarly situated persons differently on the basis of race.\" Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d \n989, 1000 (5th Cir. Unit A June 1981); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 \nU.S. 60, 112 S.Ct. 1028, 117 L.Ed.2d 208 (1992); Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, \n463 U.S. 582, 103 S.Ct. 3221, 77 L.Ed.2d 866 (1983). While we agree with the district \ncourt's conclusion that the various defendants acted in good faith, there is no question that \nthey intended to treat the plaintiffs differently on account of their race. \nB. \nThe plaintiffs argue that, because they proved a constitutional violation, and further \nviolations were likely to result, the district court erred in denying them prospective injunctive \nrelief. We review denials of 958*958 this sort of relief for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., \nPeaches Entertainment Corp. v. Entertainment Repertoire Associates, 62 F.3d 690, 693 \n(5th Cir.1995). The law school avers that the district court was well within its equitable \ndiscretion in denying relief, especially as the school had abandoned the practices that the \ndistrict court had found were unconstitutional — to-wit, the use of separate admissions \ncommittees for whites and minorities. \nWe review denials of prospective injunctive relief as we would any other denial of \npermanent injunctive relief under FED. R.CIV.P. 65, keeping in mind, however, the \nquestions of mootness, ripeness, and standing. See generally 11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT, \nARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § \n2942 (2d ed. 1995). That treatise notes that \n[p]erhaps the most significant single component in the judicial decision whether to exercise \nequity jurisdiction and grant permanent injunctive relief is the court's discretion. Of course, \nin some situations the facts and relevant law may indicate that an injunction clearly should \nbe granted or denied. However, in most cases the determination whether to issue an \ninjunction involves a balancing of interests of the parties who might be affected by the \ncourt's decision — the hardship on the plaintiff if relief is denied as compared to the \ndefendant if relief is granted and the extent to which the latter hardship can be mitigated by \n\nrequiring a security bond. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court's decision depends on the \ncircumstances of each case. \nId. at 41-42. Accordingly, the usual practice upon reversal of a denial of injunctive relief is to \nremand for a reweighing of the equities. Id. § 2962, at 448; See, e.g., James v. Stockham \nValves & Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 354-55 (5th Cir.1977). In other situations, the appellate \ncourt may order the district court to enter an injunction. See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, \nLtd. v. City of Mobile, 457 F.2d 340 (5th Cir.1972). \nAccording to the district court, the school had abandoned the admissions procedure — \nconsisting of the separate minority subcommittee — that was used in 1992, 1993, and \n1994. The court reasoned that, as a new procedure was developed for 1995, a prospective \ninjunction against the school was inappropriate. We conclude, however, that, while the \ndistrict court may have been correct in deciding that the new procedure eliminates the \nconstitutional flaws that the district court identified in the 1992 system, there is no indication \nthat the new system will cure the additional constitutional defects we now have explained. \nThe new system utilizes a small \"administrative admissions group\" and does not use \npresumptive admission and denial scores. See Hopwood, 861 F.Supp. at 582 n. 87. Most \nsignificantly, there is no indication that in employing the new plan, the law school will cease \nto consider race per se in making its admissions decisions. To the contrary, as the district \ncourt recognized, the law school continues to assert that overt racial preferences are \nnecessary to the attainment of its goals. See Hopwood, 861 F.Supp. at 573-75. \nThe district court has already granted some equitable relief: It directed that the plaintiffs be \npermitted to re-apply to the law school without incurring further administrative costs. In \naccordance with this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to apply under a system of \nadmissions that will not discriminate against anyone on the basis of race. Moreover, the \nplaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law school will continue to take race into \naccount in admissions unless it receives further judicial instruction to the effect that it may \nnot do so for the purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the school's \nreputation in the community; (3) combating the school's perceived hostile environment \ntoward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects of past discrimination by actors other \nthan the law school. \nIt is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as \nwe are confident that the conscientious administration at the school, as well as its attorneys, \nwill heed the directives contained in this opinion. If an injunction should be needed in the \nfuture, the district 959*959 court, in its discretion, can consider its parameters without our \nassistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to enter an injunction. \nC. \nThe plaintiffs contend that the district court's application of the wrong standard causes it to \ndeny punitive damages. The plaintiffs aver that the court applied an animus standard, when \nit should have asked whether the school acted with \"reckless indifference\" to their \nconstitutional rights. They ask for a remand on this issue. \n\nIt is not apparent, from the record, what standard the district court applied in considering the \npunitive damages issue. The court did determine, however, that the law school had always \nacted in good faith. This is a difficult area of the law, in which the law school erred with the \nbest of intentions. As a result, the plaintiffs have not met the federal standard for punitive \ndamages as stated in Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 1640, 75 L.Ed.2d \n632 (1983). Thus, we agree with the district court that punitive damages are not warranted. \nWe note, however, that if the law school continues to operate a disguised or overt racial \nclassification system in the future, its actors could be subject to actual and punitive \ndamages. \nV. \nConsolidated with the appeal of the merits issues of this appeal is No. 94-50569, \nchallenging the district court's denial of a motion to intervene. The proposed intervenors — \nthe Thurgood Marshall Legal Society and the Black Pre-Law Association (the \n\"associations\") — ask this court, for the second time, for the right to intervene. On their first \nattempt, the associations moved to intervene prior to trial either as of right or by permission. \nThe district court denied intervention, and we affirmed. See Hopwood v. Texas, 21 F.3d 603 \n(5th Cir.1994) (per curiam) (\"Hopwood I\"). \nNow, following the trial, the associations believe they can show that the law school has \nfailed to assert one of their proposed defenses, a circumstance they contend establishes \ntheir right to intervene. We apply the law of the case doctrine and dismiss No. 94-50569 for \nwant of jurisdiction. \nA. \nThe proposed intervenors are black student organizations at the University of Texas at \nAustin and its law school that, just prior to the trial of the merits appeal, sought to intervene, \narguing that the law school would not effectively protect their interests in continuing racial \npreferences at the law school. The district court denied the proposed intervention on the \nground that the law school and the two associations had the same objective: preservation of \nthe status quo. \nOn expedited appeal, this court affirmed on the ground that the associations had failed to \nshow that the law school had an interest different from theirs. We also commented that the \ntwo groups had failed to show \"a separate defense of the affirmative action plan that the \nState has failed to assert.\" Id. at 606. The panel implicitly considered and rejected, as one \npotential divergence of interests, the possibility that the law school would not raise a \ndefense based upon the legality of the use of TI scores under title VI, as the associations \nargued that possibility as one basis for intervention. \nAfter their first motion to intervene was denied, the associations remained involved in the \ncase. Throughout the course of the trial, they acted as amici curiae. And, at the close of trial \nbut before judgment, the district court intimated that it would allow them to submit \ninformation for the record. Accordingly, the associations sought to introduce testimonial and \ndocumentary evidence supporting their arguments that (1) the TI by itself was an unlawful \n\nbasis for admissions decisions under title VI and (2) that affirmative action at the university \nwas constitutionally required. The plaintiffs opposed the introduction of evidence on these \n\"new defenses,\" and the district court agreed. The associations were allowed to submit \namicus briefs and highlight evidence that was already in the record but were not allowed to \nraise new issues or supplement the record. \n960*960 Shortly thereafter, the associations again sought to intervene under FED.R.CIV.P. \n24(a)(2) (intervention as of right), claiming that the law school had failed to raise their two \n\"new defenses\" and, accordingly, that events now showed that that representation \ninadequately protected their interests. They sought to reopen the record to introduce \nevidence supporting these arguments. \nThe district court summarily refused this request. That order is the focus of this separate \nappeal, in which the associations present only the title VI defense and ask to be allowed to \npresent such evidence only if we do not affirm the judgment. \nB. \nThere is no caselaw in this circuit that directly addresses how to review successive motions \nto intervene.[58] The parties direct us to Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 473 F.2d 118, \n125-26 (D.C.Cir.1972); United States Envt'l Protection Agency v. City of Green Forest, 921 \nF.2d 1394, 1401 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 956, 112 S.Ct. 414, 116 L.Ed.2d 435 \n(1991); and Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471, 1477 (11th Cir.1993). \nThese courts, which were examining whether the appeal from a successive motion was \ntimely as per the appellate requirements, devised the general rule that a second motion \nwould be treated as independent of the first if it was reached under materially changed \ncircumstances. \nHere, the associations assume that their second intervention motion is separate and distinct \nfrom their earlier failed attempt, because the law school's failure to raise their proposed \ndefense constitutes a changed circumstance.[59] Thus, they ask that we engage in de novo \nreview of their motion. \nThe plaintiffs, however, note that this motion was entitled a \"renewed motion for \nintervention.\" The plaintiffs argue that the district court was reconsidering its previous denial \norder under its FED.R.CIV.P. 60(b) powers, and we should review merely for abuse of \ndiscretion. \nC. \nWhile the \"changed circumstances\" test may have merit — an issue we do not decide today \n— we do not find it applicable to this case. Instead, the \"law of the case\" doctrine militates \nagainst reconsideration of this motion. Normally, when a prior panel discusses an issue on \nthe merits, a later panel cannot reach a contrary conclusion under the preclusive principle of \nlaw of the case. See Williams v. City of New Orleans, 763 F.2d 667, 669 (5th Cir.1985). \nThere is no question that the Hopwood I panel addressed the intervention as a matter of \n\nright de novo, 961*961 on the merits, including the potential that the law school would not \nraise every defense proposed by the associations. \nThe question of whether we can rely upon the law of the case doctrine, however, is clouded \nbecause of the \"anomalous\" rule that exists in this circuit concerning the procedural posture \nof these intervention cases. Under that rule, we have only provisional jurisdiction to review a \ndistrict court's denial of a motion to intervene. \nIf we agree with the district court, our jurisdiction \"evaporates.\" Hence, the denial of leave to \nintervene when the party had a right to intervene is immediately appealable. On appeal, \nhowever, our rule \"requires a merit review of any claim of intervention in order for [us] to \ndetermine whether or not the district court's order is appealable.\" Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d \n912, 916 (5th Cir. 1975). If the claim is without merit, then the order \"is not appealable, the \nappellate court has no jurisdiction, and the appeal should be dismissed.\" Id. Thus, despite \nthe merits review, this is a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.[60] \nOur anomalous rule complicates the analysis of the preclusive effects of the prior panel \ndecision, because dismissals for lack of jurisdiction normally do not have preclusive effect. \nSee, e.g., FED.R.CIV.P. 41(b). Accordingly, while appellate courts review denials of \nintervention motions on the merits, it is uncertain to what extent such a review has \npreclusive effect. Nonetheless, we recognize the possibility of issue preclusion on the \nquestion of jurisdiction itself. \nWhile a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not operate as an adjudication on the merits, \n\"[t]his provision means only that the dismissal permits a second action on the same claim \nthat corrects the deficiency found in the first action. The judgment remains effective to \npreclude relitigation of the precise issue of jurisdiction or venue that led to the initial \ndismissal.\" 7C CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER \nsupra, § 4436, at 338.[61] Thus, a party is precluded from successively appealing the same \nintervention motion. \nHere, the record shows that the associations raised this same title VI argument before the \nHopwood I panel in both their brief and at oral argument. That panel, reviewing de novo the \nmerits of the associations' claims, denied intervention. Accordingly, the last panel implicitly \naddressed this issue, and we must respect its decision to deny intervention. The law of the \ncase doctrine prevents merits review, and we dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of \njurisdiction.[62] \n962*962 VI. \nIn summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law may not use race as a \nfactor in deciding which applicants to admit in order to achieve a diverse student body, to \ncombat the perceived effects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate the law \nschool's poor reputation in the minority community, or to eliminate any present effects of \npast discrimination by actors other than the law school. Because the law school has \nproffered these justifications for its use of race in admissions, the plaintiffs have satisfied \ntheir burden of showing that they were scrutinized under an unconstitutional admissions \nsystem. The plaintiffs are entitled to reapply under an admissions system that invokes none \n\nof these serious constitutional infirmities. We also direct the district court to reconsider the \nquestion of damages, and we conclude that the proposed intervenors properly were denied \nintervention. \nIn No. 94-50569, the appeal is DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction. In No. 94-50664, the \njudgment is REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this \nopinion. \nWIENER, Circuit Judge, specially concurring. \n\"We judge best when we judge least, particularly in controversial matters of high public \ninterest.\"[1] In this and every other appeal, we should decide only the case before us, and \nshould do so on the narrowest possible basis. Mindful of this credo, I concur in part and, \nwith respect, specially concur in part. \nThe sole substantive issue in this appeal is whether the admissions process employed by \nthe law school for 1992 meets muster under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. The law school offers alternative justifications for its race-based admissions \nprocess, each of which, it insists, is a compelling interest: (1) remedying the present effects \nof past discrimination (present effects) and (2) providing the educational benefits that can \nbe obtained only when the student body is diverse (diversity).[2] \nAs to present effects, I concur in the panel opinion's analysis: Irrespective of whether the \nlaw school or the University of Texas system as a whole is deemed the relevant \ngovernmental unit to be tested,[3] neither has established the existence of present effects of \npast discrimination sufficient to justify the use of a racial classification.[4] As to diversity, \nhowever, I respectfully disagree with the panel opinion's conclusion that diversity can never \nbe a compelling governmental interest in a public graduate school. Rather than attempt to \ndecide that issue, I would take a considerably narrower path — and, I believe, a more \nappropriate one — to reach an equally narrow result: I would assume arguendo that \ndiversity can be a compelling interest but conclude that the admissions process here under \nscrutiny was not narrowly tailored to achieve diversity. \nI \nTHE LAW \nA. EQUAL PROTECTION \nThe Equal Protection Clause provides that \"[n]o State shall ... deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"[5] Accordingly, \"all racial classifications, \nimposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed 963*963 \nby a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\"[6] Racial classifications will survive strict scrutiny \n\"only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental \ninterests.\"[7] Thus, strict scrutiny comprises two inquiries of equal valence: the \"compelling \ninterest\" inquiry and the \"narrow tailoring\" inquiry.[8] Moreover, these inquiries are \n\nconjunctive: To avoid constitutional nullity, a racial classification must satisfy both inquiries. \nFailure to satisfy either is fatal. \nB. RACIAL CLASSIFICATION \nNone dispute that the law school's admission process for 1992 employed a racial \nclassification. Depending on an applicant's race, his request for admission was considered \nunder one of three different (and, as explained in the panel opinion, often dispositive[9]) TI \nadmission ranges: one for blacks only, a second for Mexican Americans only, and a third for \nall other races and nationalities, including non-Mexican Hispanic Americans. In short, each \napplicant for admission to the law school was classified by race, and his application was \ntreated differently according into which of those three racial classifications it fell. Thus, the \nlaw school's 1992 admissions process, like all racial classifications by the government, is \nsubject to strict scrutiny.[10] \nC. STRICT SCRUTINY \nThe law school contends that it employs a racially stratified admissions process to obtain, \ninter alia, the educational benefits of a diverse student body. Translated into the \nconstitutional idiom, the law school insists that achieving student body diversity in a public \ngraduate school is a compelling governmental interest. The law school invokes the opinion \nof Justice Powell in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke[11] to support that \npostulate. The panel opinion rejects that support, concluding that from its inception Bakke \nhad little precedential value and now, post-Adarand, has none. My fellow panelists thus \ndeclare categorically that \"any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for the \npurposes of achieving a diverse student body is not a compelling interest under the \nFourteenth Amendment.\"[12] \nThis conclusion may well be a defensible extension of recent Supreme Court precedent, an \nextension which in time may prove to be the Court's position. It admittedly has a simplifying \nappeal as an easily applied, bright-line rule proscribing any use of race as a determinant. \nBe that as it may, this position remains an extension of the law — one that, in my opinion, is \nboth overly broad and unnecessary to the disposition of this case. I am therefore unable to \nconcur in the majority's analysis. \nMy decision not to embrace the ratio decidendi of the majority opinion results from three \npremises: First, if Bakke is to be declared dead, the Supreme Court, not a three-judge panel \nof a circuit court, should make that pronouncement. Second, Justice O'Connor expressly \nstates that Adarand is not the death knell of affirmative action — to 964*964 which I would \nadd, especially not in the framework of achieving diversity in public graduate schools.[13] \nThird, we have no need to decide the thornier issue of compelling interest, as the narrowly \ntailored inquiry of strict scrutiny presents a more surgical and — it seems to me — more \nprincipled way to decide the case before us.[14] I am nevertheless reluctant to proceed with \na narrowly tailored inquiry without pausing to respond briefly to the panel opinion's \ntreatment of diversity in the context of the compelling interest inquiry \n\nD. IS DIVERSITY A COMPELLING INTEREST? \nAlong its path to a per se ban on any consideration of race in attempting to achieve student \nbody diversity, the panel opinion holds (or strongly implies) that remedying vestigial effects \nof past discrimination is the only compelling interest that can ever justify racial \nclassification.[15] The main reason that I cannot go along with the panel opinion to that \nextent is that I do not read the applicable Supreme Court precedent as having held squarely \nand unequivocally either that remedying effects of past discrimination is the only compelling \nstate interest that can ever justify racial classification, or conversely that achieving diversity \nin the student body of a public graduate or professional school can never be a compelling \ngovernmental interest. Indeed, the panel opinion itself hedges a bit on whether the Supreme \nCourt's square holdings have gone that far,[16] particularly in the realm of higher \neducation.[17] \nBetween the difficulty inherent in applying Bakke[18] and the minimal guidance in 965*965 \nAdarand,[19] the definition and application of the compelling interest inquiry seems to be \nsuspended somewhere in the interstices of constitutional interpretation. Until further \nclarification issues from the Supreme Court defining \"compelling interest\" (or telling us how \nto know one when we see one), I perceive no \"compelling\" reason to rush in where the \nSupreme Court fears — or at least declines — to tread. Instead, I would pretermit any \nattempt at a compelling interest inquiry and accept Justice O'Connor's invitation to apply the \nCourt's more discernible and less intrusive \"narrow tailoring\" precedent.[20] Thus, for the \npurpose of this appeal I assume, without deciding, that diversity is a compelling interest,[21] \nand proceed to the narrowly tailored inquiry. \nE. TEST FOR NARROW TAILORING \nWhen strictly scrutinizing a racial classification for narrow tailoring, the first question is \n\"What is the purpose of this racial classification?\"[22] The present effects rationale having \nproven feckless in this case, today's answer to that first question is a given: The law \nschool's purpose is diversity. Accordingly, I perceive the next question to be, \"Was the law \nschool's 1992 admissions process, with one TI range for blacks, another for Mexican \nAmericans, and a third for other races, narrowly tailored to achieve diversity?\" I conclude \nthat it was not. Focusing as it does on blacks and Mexican Americans only, the law school's \n1992 admissions process misconceived the concept of diversity, as did California's in the \nview of Justice Powell: Diversity which furthers a compelling state interest \"encompasses a \nfar broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a \nsingle though important element.\"[23] \n966*966 When the selective race-based preferences of the law school's 1992 admissions \nprocess are evaluated under Justice Powell's broad, multi-faceted concept of diversity, that \nprocess fails to satisfy the requirements of the Constitution.[24] The law school purported to \naccomplish diversity by ensuring an increase in the numbers of only blacks and Mexican \nAmericans in each incoming class to produce percentages — virtually indistinguishable \nfrom quotas — of approximately five and ten percent, respectively. Yet blacks and Mexican \nAmericans are but two among any number of racial or ethnic groups that could and \npresumably should contribute to genuine diversity. By singling out only those two ethnic \n\ngroups, the initial stage of the law school's 1992 admissions process ignored altogether \nnon-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, to name but a \nfew. \nIn this light, the limited racial effects of the law school's preferential admissions process, \ntargeting exclusively blacks and Mexican Americans, more closely resembles a set aside or \nquota system for those two disadvantaged minorities than it does an academic admissions \nprogram narrowly tailored to achieve true diversity. I concede that the law school's 1992 \nadmissions process would increase the percentages of black faces and brown faces in that \nyear's entering class. But facial diversity is not true diversity, and a system thus conceived \nand implemented simply is not narrowly tailored to achieve diversity. \nAccordingly, I would find that the law school's race-based 1992 admissions process was not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve diversity and hold it constitutionally invalid on that basis. By so \ndoing I would avoid the largely uncharted waters of a compelling interest analysis. Although \nI join my colleagues of the panel in their holding that the law school's 1992 admissions \nprocess fails to pass strict scrutiny,[25] on the question of diversity I follow the solitary path of \nnarrow tailoring rather than the primrose path of compelling interest to reach our common \nholding. \nII \nREMEDY \nBefore concluding, I am compelled to add a few words about the panel opinion's \n\"commentary\" regarding the remedy to be imposed by the district court on remand. Without \nemploying the express language of injunction or affixing that label to its holding, the panel \nopinion's discussion of the remedy on remand is \"strongly suggestive\" and has all of the \nsubstantive earmarks of an injunction: \n[The] plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the law school will continue to take race into \naccount in admissions unless it receives further judicial instruction to the effect that it may \nnot do so for the purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the school's \nreputation in the community; (3) combating the school's perceived hostile environment \ntoward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects of past discrimination by actors other \nthan the law school. \nIt is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time that the law school be enjoined, as \nwe are confident that the conscientious 967*967 administration at the school, as well as its \nattorneys, will heed the directives contained in this opinion. If an injunction should be \nneeded in the future, the district court, in its discretion, can consider its parameters without \nour assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to enter an injunction.[26] \nEssentially, the substance of the quoted portion of the panel opinion constitutes a de facto \ninjunction — telling the district court precisely what to tell the law school that it can and can't \ndo — albeit without the use of the word injunction. To me, if \"it\" has feathers, swims, \nwaddles, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck; and I find such an \"un-injunction\" \n\ninappropriate. If instead we were simply to reverse and remand on the violation issue, we \nwould stop short of finding de novo that the law school had violated these four plaintiffs' \nequal protection rights. It seems unavoidable to me that until the district court determines \nthat there has been a violation, a remedy cannot be fashioned and should not be the \nsubject of appellate speculation.[27] \nThe district court denied the plaintiffs injunctive relief, but only after assigning the burden of \nproof to the wrong party.[28] \nNo member of this panel questions that, in the initial stanza of the burden-shifting minuet of \nMt. Healthy Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,[29] the plaintiffs met their burden. Once the \nplaintiffs did that, the burden should have shifted to the law school. Instead, the district court \nleft it with the plaintiffs and concluded that they had failed to carry the ultimate burden. The \ndistrict court's failure to shift the burden to the law school, and the conclusion of that court \nwhich followed, were errors. Accordingly, like my colleagues of the panel, I would remand \nthe case to the district court with instructions to relieve the plaintiffs of the misplaced burden \nwhile affording the law school the opportunity to prove that the prima facie violation \nestablished by the plaintiffs was essentially harmless. But it seems clear to me that this is \nwhere our analysis should end. As a result, I depart from the \"commentary\" in the panel \nopinion regarding the precise elements of the remedy to be fashioned by the district court if \nit should conclude on remand that the law school shall have failed to bear its burden. \nIII \nCONCLUSION \nI end where I began: We should only decide the issues necessarily before this court, and \nthen only on the narrowest bases upon which our decision can rest. This is not a class \naction; nothing is before us here save the claims of four individual plaintiffs. These four \nindividual plaintiffs properly challenge only the admissions process employed by the law \nschool in 1992 — not the admissions process that was in place and employed in 1995, not \nthe admissions process that is being employed in 1996, and not the admissions process to \nbe applied in any future years. In sum, I would remand, and in the process I would take care \nnot to eviscerate the discretion of the district court with excessive \"commentary\" or implicit \ndirections on the precise nature of the remedy that must ensue. Rather, my remand would \nsimply instruct the district court to apply the correct burden-shifting process articulated in \nMt. Healthy, then see how the law school deals with it. That way, if the Mt. Healthy \napplication should demonstrate the need for a remedy, the district court would be free to \nfashion the appropriate relief — including injunctive if necessary — for those among the \nindividual plaintiffs whose individual cases warrant it. For this court to do anything beyond \nthat impresses me as overreaching. 968*968 Thus I concur in the judgment of the panel \nopinion but, as to its conclusion on the issue of strict scrutiny and its gloss on the order of \nremand, I disagree for the reasons I have stated and therefore concur specially. \n[1] The formulae were written by the Law School Data Assembly Service according to a prediction derived from the \nsuccess of first-year students in preceding years. As the LSAT was determined to be a better predictor of success in \nlaw school, the formulae for the class entering in 1992 accorded an approximate 60% weight to LSAT scores and \n40% to GPA.  \n\nThe formula for students with a three-digit LSAT, see infra note 5, was calculated as: LSAT + (10) (GPA) = TI. For \nstudents with a two-digit LSAT, the formula was: (1.25) LSAT + (10) GPA = TI. \n[2] Notably, but of less significance to this appeal, residency also had a strong, if not often determinant, effect. Under \nTexas law in 1992, the law school was limited to a class of 15% non-residents, and the Board of Regents required an \nentering class of at least 500 students. The law school therefore had to monitor offers to nonresidents carefully, in \norder not to exceed this quota, while at the same time maintaining an entering class of a manageable size. \n[3] The number of votes would change over the course of the admissions season in order to achieve the appropriate \nnumber of offers. \n[4] As blacks and Mexican Americans were the only two minority categories granted preferential treatment in \nadmissions, it is inaccurate to say that the law school conducted separate admissions programs for \"minorities\" and \n\"non-minorities.\" While the law school application form segregated racial and ethnic classification into seven \ncategories — \"Black/African American,\" \"Native American,\" \"Asian American,\" \"Mexican American,\" \"Other Hispanic\" \n(meaning nonMexican descent), \"White,\" and \"Other (describe)\" — only American blacks and Mexican Americans \nreceived the benefit of the separate admissions track.  \nThus, for example, the law school decided that a black citizen of Nigeria would not get preferential treatment, but a \nresident alien from Mexico, who resided in Texas, would. Likewise, Asians, American Indians, Americans from El \nSalvador and Cuba, and many others did not receive a preference. \nIt is important to keep the composition of these categories in mind. For the sake of simplicity and readability, \nhowever, we sometimes will refer to two broad categories: \"whites\" (meaning Texas residents who were whites and \nnon-preferred minorities) and \"minorities\" (meaning Mexican Americans and black Americans). \n[5] Because of a recent change in the grading scale of the LSAT, the law school in 1992 had applicants who had \ntaken an earlier LSAT scored on a 10-to-48 scale and others who had taken a later one scored on a 120-to-180 \nscale. Equivalence calculations were used to compare scores received on the two scales. For example, TI numbers \nof 199 (three-digit LSAT) and 87 (two-digit LSAT) were equivalent. For the sake of simplicity, we use three-digit \nnumbers throughout this opinion. \n[6] In March 1992, the resident Mexican American and black presumptive admit lines were in parity, but they had not \nstarted that way. The initial presumptive admit TI's were 196 for Mexican Americans and 192 for blacks. Thus, \ninitially, blacks received preferential treatment over Mexican Americans by having a lower hurdle to cross to get into \nthe discretionary zone. In March, Professor Johanson lowered the Mexican American TI in order to admit more of this \ngroup. \n[7] The median scores of the 1992 class are as follows:  \nEthnicity               Resident       Nonresident \n \n                        GPA/LSAT       GPA/LSAT \n \nAll students            3.52/162       3.61/164 \nWhite                   3.56/164       3.72/166 \nBlack                   3.30/158       3.30/156 \nMexican American        3.24/157       3.38/174* \nOther minority          3.58/160       3.77/157 \n \n* Only two matriculated applicants. \n \nIn 1992, the LSAT's national distribution was \napproximately as follows: \n \n   LSAT      Percentile      2-Digit LSAT \n   166          94%               43 \n\n   164          91%               41 \n   162          88%               40 \n   160          83%               39 \n   158          78%               38 \n   156          71%               36 \nOn the basis of these percentiles, one-half of the law school's white resident matriculants were in the top 9% of all \ntest-takers, one-half of the resident Mexican Americans were in approximately the top 25% of test-takers, and one-\nhalf of the resident blacks were in the top 22% of testtakers. \n[8] To illustrate this difference, we consider the four plaintiffs in this case — Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, \nKenneth Elliott, and David Rogers. For a student similarly situated to Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8, to avoid \npresumptive denial as a white, i.e., to obtain a TI of 193 or above, her LSAT had to be at least a 155, a score in \napproximately the top 32% of test-takers. If she were black (thus, needing a 180 TI), she would have had to score a \n142 on the LSAT, ranking her only in the top 80%. Likewise, a student similar to Carvell, who had a 3.28 GPA, would \nhave needed a \"white\" LSAT of 160 (top 17%) and a \"black\" 147 (top 63%). A student like Rodgers with a 3.13 would \nhave needed either a 162 (top 12%) as a white or 149 as a black (top 56%). Finally, a student like Elliott with a 2.98 \nGPA would have needed a 163 (top 10%) or 150 (top 53%), respectively. \n[9] According to the plaintiffs, 600-700 higherscoring white residents were passed over before the first blacks were \ndenied admission. There is no specific finding on this assertion, and though the law school does not appear to refute \nit, we do not rely upon it in making our decision. \n[10] Thus, the law school constantly had to adjust its TI range over the course of the admissions season to reach a \ndesired mix. See supra note 6. \n[11] The district court did not find, nor is the record clear on, how these different classes of waiting list candidates \nwere compared in the event the law school made last-minute admissions decisions. The record does show that the \nschool carefully monitored the race of applicants in filling the last openings in late spring and early summer. \n[12] The district court discussed in detail the plaintiffs' qualifications and their rejections. See 861 F.Supp. at 564-67. \n[13] The defendants are the State of Texas; the University of Texas Board of Regents; the members of the board, \nnamed but sued in their official capacities; the University of Texas at Austin; the President of the university, sued in \nhis official capacity; the University of Texas School of Law; the dean of the law school, sued in his official capacity; \nand the Chairman of the Admissions Committee, sued in his official capacity. \n[14] Because of this conclusion, the district court examined at length the history of race relations in Texas and \ndiscrimination in its schools. 861 F.Supp. at 554-57. \n[15] Shortly before trial, apparently in response to the filing of this lawsuit, the law school modified its 1992 \nadmissions practices to fit the district court's view of the proper constitutional system. See id. at 582 n. 87. \n[16] In their initial brief on appeal, the defendants argued that intermediate scrutiny is appropriate here. In a \nsupplemental brief filed to address the subsequent opinion in Adarand, they now acknowledge that strict scrutiny is \nthe appropriate test. \n[17] Adarand, ___ U.S. at ___-___, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13 (overruling Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. F.C.C., 497 U.S. \n547, 110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990), insofar as it applied intermediate scrutiny to congressionally mandated \n\"benign\" racial classifications); City of Richmond v. J.A.

Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, \n534, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2803, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980)], (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before permitting unequal \ntreatment based on race.\" ___ U.S. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2113. \n[19] See also Adarand, id. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2111 (\"[A]ny person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that \nany government actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal \ntreatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.\"). \n[20] See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at 498-500, 109 S.Ct. at 724-25 (holding that past societal discrimination against a \ngroup confers no basis for local governments to provide a specifically tailored remedy to current members of that \ngroup); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275-76, 106 S.Ct. at 1847-48 (rejecting argument that governmental discrimination in \nteacher layoffs is allowed to foster role models within a group). \n[21] See, e.g., Vincent Blasi, Bakke as Precedent: Does Mr. Justice Powell Have a Theory?, 67 CAL. L.REV. 21, 24 \n(1979) (arguing that Bakke's precedential force is governed by the common conclusions of Justices Powell and \nStevens, though it is erroneous to conclude that Powell's opinion has \"controlling significance on all questions\"); \nRobert G. Dixon, Jr., Bakke: A Constitutional Analysis, 67 CAL.L.REV. 69 (1979) (Justice Powell's \"tiebreaking \nopinion ... has acquired wide pragmatic appeal.\"). \n[22] As affirmative action programs are by definition purposeful classifications by race, they do not present the \nproblem of governmental action that is facially neutral but has a disparate impact and is motivated by race. See \nVillage of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); \nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976). \n[23] The Supreme Court subsequently has agreed with that position. See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274-76, 106 S.Ct. at \n1847-48 (plurality opinion). The district court a quo erred in suggesting that societal discrimination is constitutionally \ncognizable. See 861 F.Supp. at 570 n. 56, 571 n. 60. \n[24] See also Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1218, 1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957) \n(Frankfurter, J., concurring in result) (recognizing four separate components of \"academic freedom\"). \n[25] Saying that a university has a First Amendment interest in this context is somewhat troubling. Both the medical \nschool in Bakke and, in our case, the law school are state institutions. The First Amendment generally protects \ncitizens from the actions of government, not government from its citizens.  \nSignificantly, Sweezy involved a person who was called before the Attorney General of New Hampshire to answer for \nalleged subversive activities. He declined on First Amendment grounds to answer questions about a lecture he had \ndelivered at the University of New Hampshire. While Justice Frankfurter spoke of a university's interest in openness \nand free inquiry, it was plainly through the First Amendment rights of individual scholars. 354 U.S. at 262, 266-67, 77 \nS.Ct. at 1217-18, 1219-20 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result). \n[26] See also Milwaukee County Pavers Ass'n v. Fiedler, 922 F.2d 419, 422 (7th Cir.) (\"The whole point of Croson is \nthat disadvantage, diversity, or other grounds favoring minorities will not justify governmental racial discrimination ...; \nonly a purpose of remedying discrimination against minorities will do so.\") (emphasis added), cert. denied, 500 U.S. \n954, 111 S.Ct. 2261, 114 L.Ed.2d 714 (1991).  \nNotably, Justice Scalia rejected the use of racial classifications \"in order (in a broad sense) `to ameliorate the effects \nof past discrimination.'\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 520, 109 S.Ct. at 736 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (quoting \nCroson, 488 U.S. at 476-77, 109 S.Ct. at 713). He, however, suggested one other possible compelling state interest: \na social emergency. He opined that \"where state or local action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level \nof imminent danger to life and limb\" will justify racial classifications. Croson, 488 U.S. at 521, 109 S.Ct. at 736 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in judgment). While such an interest is probably consistent with the widely criticized holdings of \nHirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 \nU.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944), plainly such an interest is not presented in this case. \n[27] The law school places much reliance upon Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wygant for the proposition that \nJustice Powell's Bakke formulation is still viable. In her 1986 Wygant opinion, in the context of discussing Justice \nPowell's opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that \"although its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in the \n\npromotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently `compelling,' at least in the context of higher education, to \nsupport the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.\" 476 U.S. at 286, 106 S.Ct. at 1853 (O'Connor, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  \nThe law school's argument is not persuasive. Justice O'Connor's statement is purely descriptive and did not purport \nto express her approval or disapproval of diversity as a compelling interest. Her subsequent statements outlined \nabove in Croson and Metro Broadcasting suggest strongly that reliance upon this statement in Wygant is unjustified. \n[28] The law school's admissions program makes no distinction among black and Mexican American applicants in an \neffort to determine which of them, for example, may have been culturally or educationally disadvantaged. \n[29] For example, Justice Powell apparently felt that persons with different ethnic backgrounds would bring diverse \n\"experiences, outlooks, and ideas\" to the medical school. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314, 98 S.Ct. at 2760 (opinion of \nPowell, J.). \n[30] Thus, to put it simply, under the Equal Protection Clause  \nthe distribution of benefits and costs by government on racial or ethnic grounds is impermissible. Even though it is \nfrequently efficient to sort people by race or ethnic origin, because racial or ethnic identity may be a good proxy for \nfunctional classifications, efficiency is rejected as a basis for governmental action in this context. \nPosner, supra, at 22. \n[31] We recognize that the use of some factors such as economic or educational background of one's parents may be \nsomewhat correlated with race. This correlation, however, will not render the use of the factor unconstitutional if it is \nnot adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of race. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 107 S.Ct. \n1756, 95 L.Ed.2d 262 (1987). As Justice O'Connor indicated in Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 111 S.Ct. \n1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991), which was a challenge under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 \nL.Ed.2d 69 (1986), based upon the prosecution's strike of potential jurors who spoke Spanish:  \nNo matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race the explanation for a peremptory strike may be, the strike \ndoes not implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race. That is the distinction between \ndisproportionate effect, which is not sufficient to constitute an equal protection violation, and intentional \ndiscrimination, which is. \n500 U.S. at 375, 111 S.Ct. at 1874 (O'Connor, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \n[32] According to one of the four-Justice opinions in Bakke, racial classifications stigmatize when \"they are drawn on \nthe presumption that one race is inferior to another or because they put the weight of government behind racial \nhatred and separation.\" 438 U.S. at 357-58, 98 S.Ct. at 2782 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., \nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). In Bakke, however, these Justices rejected strict scrutiny \nbecause the program at issue could not be said to stigmatize as did other racial classifications. These Justices \nnevertheless recognized that rational-basis scrutiny would not be enough. Id. at 361, 98 S.Ct. at 2784 (Brennan, \nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part). \n[33] As Judge Posner has indicated,  \nthe proper constitutional principle is not, no \"invidious\" racial or ethnic discrimination, but no use of racial or ethnic \ncriteria to determine the distribution of government benefits and burdens.... To ask whether racial exclusion may not \nhave overriding benefits for both races in particular circumstances is to place the anti-discrimination principle at the \nmercy of the vagaries of empirical conjecture and thereby free the judge to enact his personal values into \nconstitutional doctrine. \nPosner, supra, at 25-26. \n[34] See also Adarand, ___ U.S. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in \njudgment) (\"But there can be no doubt that racial paternalism and its unintended consequences may be as poisonous \n\nand pernicious as any other form of discrimination.\"). One prominent constitutional commentator specifically has \nnoted that where programs involve lower and separate standards of selection, \"a new badge of implied inferiority, \nassigned as an incident of governmental noblesse oblige,\" results.  \nExplicit in state, local, or federal plans using separate and lower standards by race is a statement by government that \ncertain persons identified by race are in fact being placed in positions they may be presumed not likely to hold but for \ntheir race (because they are presumed to be unable to meet standards the government itself requires to be met). The \nmessage from government is written very large when these plans proliferate: a \ndouble (and softer) standard for admission, a double (and softer) standard for hiring, a double (and softer) standard \nfor promotion, a double (and softer) standard for competitive bidding, and so on. Without question, this is a \nsystematic racial tagging by government — a communication to others that the race of the individual they deal with \nbespeaks a race-related probability, created solely by the government itself, of lesser qualification than others holding \nequivalent positions. William Van Alstyne, Rites of Passage: Race, the Supreme Court, and the Constitution, 46 \nU.CHI. L.REV. 775, 787 n. 38 (1979). \n[35] As professor Van Alstyne has argued:  \nRather, one gets beyond racism by getting beyond it now: by a complete, resolute, and credible commitment never to \ntolerate in one's own life — or in the life or practices of one's government — the differential treatment of other human \nbeings by race. Indeed, that is the great lesson for government itself to teach: in all we do in life, whatever we do in \nlife, to treat any person less well than another or to favor any more than another for being black or white or brown or \nred, is wrong. Let that be our fundamental law and we shall have a Constitution universally worth expounding. \nVan Alstyne, supra note 34, at 809-10. \n[36] Because we have determined that any consideration of race by the law school is constitutionally impermissible if \njustified by diversity, it is not necessary to determine whether, as plaintiffs argue, the admissions system under which \nthe plaintiffs applied operated as a de facto \"quota\" system similar to the one struck down in Bakke. We do note that \neven if a \"plus\" system were permissible, it likely would be impossible to maintain such a system without \ndegeneration into nothing more than a \"quota\" program. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 378, 98 S.Ct. at 2793 (\"For purposes \nof constitutional adjudication, there is no difference between [setting aside a certain number of places for minorities \nand using minority status as a positive factor].\") (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the \njudgment in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, in this case, the law school appeared to be especially adept at \nmeeting its yearly \"goals.\" See Hopwood, 861 F.Supp. at 574 n. 67. \n[37] Plaintiffs additionally have argued that the law school's program was not narrowly tailored in the diversity context \nbecause (1) it failed to award preferences to non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, American Indians, \nor other minorities, and (2) it failed to accord as much weight to non-racial diversity factors, such as religion and \nsocioeconomic background, as it did to race. \n[38] Hopwood I is the first appeal of the intervention issue that we address infra. \n[39] Unfortunately, the precise scope of allowable state action is of somewhat undefined contours. Indeed, it is not \nevident whether permitted remedial action extends to the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" This language, \nderived from Justice Brennan's opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 362-66, 98 S.Ct. at 2784-87, appears intended to \npresent little resistance to wide-ranging affirmative action plans.  \nWhile Justice Brennan began by stating that schools have a duty affirmatively to erase the vestiges of their past \ndiscriminatory practices, he compared this duty to the power of Congress to enforce § 1 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment through § 5. He reasoned that under that wideranging power, the beneficiaries of such a program need \nnot present proof that they were discriminated against; a showing that they were in the general class was sufficient. \nId. at 363-64, 98 S.Ct. at 2785-86. Nor would a school need judicial findings of past discrimination. Id. at 364, 98 \nS.Ct. at 2785-86. Finally, he argued that such beneficiaries would not even have to show that that school had a \nhistory of past discrimination, but need only suggest that they were the victims of general societal discrimination that \nprevented them from being otherwise qualified to enter the school. Id. at 365-66, 98 S.Ct. at 2786-87. Hence, under \nthis standard, almost any school could adopt an affirmative action plan. \n\nThere is no question, however, that subsequent Supreme Court opinions, notably Wygant and Croson, have rejected \nbroad state programs that purport to be remedial and that, presumably, would have satisfied Justice Brennan's \nstandard for meeting the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" And some members of the Court would limit any \nremedial purpose to the actual victims of discrimination. See Adarand, ___ U.S. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2118 (Scalia, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[G]overnment can never have a `compelling interest' in discriminating \non the basis of race in order to `make up' for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction.\"). Nevertheless, we \nwill not eschew use of the phrase \"present effects of past discrimination,\" as we used this language in Hopwood I, 21 \nF.3d at 605, and another circuit did so in Podberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, ___ \nU.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 2001, 131 L.Ed.2d 1002 (1995). We will, however, limit its application in accordance with Wygant \nand Croson. \n[40] See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286, 106 S.Ct. at 1853 (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in \njudgment) (\"The Court is in agreement that whatever the formulation employed, remedying past or present racial \ndiscrimination by a state actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant remedial use of a carefully constructed \naffirmative action program.\"). \n[41] See also id. at 288, 106 S.Ct. at 1854 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"I agree with \nthe plurality that a government agency's interest in remedying `societal' discrimination, that is discrimination not \ntraceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster under strict \nscrutiny.\"). \n[42] Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Stevens, and Kennedy in this \nportion of the opinion. \n[43] The fact that the plaintiffs named the State of Texas as one defendant does not mean that it is proper to \nscrutinize the state as the relevant past discriminator. This argument confuses a theory of liability with a justification \nfor a limited racial remedy. The State of Texas simply may be responsible for the wrongs of the law school, which is a \ngovernmental entity the state has created. The Supreme Court, however, has limited the remedial interest to the \nharm wrought by a specific governmental unit. \n[44] And again, any such remedy here would be grossly speculative. As the defendants concede and the district court \nfound, there is no recent history of overt sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas. Hopwood, 861 F.Supp. \nat 572. Nor does the record even suggest such discrimination at any of the other component schools of the University \nof Texas System. Thus, any harm caused to the students of those institutions would be the result of the present \neffects of past discrimination.  \nWe do note that the law school is not autonomous. In Texas, the management of higher education has been divided \nby the legislature into different \"systems.\" See 12 TEX.JUR.3D, Colleges and Universities § 2 (1993). The University \nof Texas at Austin, with which the law school is associated, is part of the University of Texas System. \nTEX.EDUC.CODE ANN. §§ 67.01 to 67.62 (West 1991). Accordingly, the legislature, which has ultimate control over \nthe school, has delegated its \"management and control\" to the regents of the University of Texas System. Id. § 67.02. \nThus, the law school is governed by both the legislature and the university's board of regents. \nYet, while the state's higher authorities may have the power to require the law school to remedy its past wrongs, they \nmay do so consistently with the Constitution only if the remedial actions are directed at the law school. This \nrequirement is what the Supreme Court dictated by limiting the remedial purpose to the \"governmental unit involved.\" \nWygant, 476 U.S. at 274, 106 S.Ct. at 1847 (plurality opinion). \n[45] The testimony of several minority students underscores this point. They stated generally that they felt that other \nstudents did not respect them because the other students assumed that minorities attained admission because of the \nracial preference program. \n[46] The argument is that because the state discriminated in its primary and secondary school systems, the students' \neducational attainment was adversely affected, and this harm extended to their higher education, thus justifying \ngiving current applicants a \"plus\" based on race. This reasoning is especially important in justifying benefits for \nMexican Americans, as there is no evidence that the law school implemented de jure (or even de facto) discrimination \nagainst this group in its admissions process. Because this logic ignores the relevant actions in this case, i.e., \ndiscrimination by the law school, it is not necessary for us to examine the potential causational flaws in the argument.  \n\nMoreover, if we did find that the past wrongs of Texas school districts were the sort of discrimination that the law \nschool could address, the school still would have to prove the present effects of that past wrong. Without some strong \nevidence in the record showing that today's law school applicants still bear the mark of those past systems, such \neffects seem grossly speculative. The district court simply assumed that \"[t]his segregation has handicapped the \neducational achievement of many minorities....\" 861 F.Supp. at 573. And we would still have to ask whether the \nprogram was narrowly tailored to this goal. \n[47] To the extent that the OCR has required actions that conflict with the Constitution, the directives cannot stand. \nThe Supreme Court has addressed required state compliance with federal law in the voting rights context. Miller v. \nJohnson, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2491, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995) (\"As we suggested in Shaw [v. Reno, \n509 U.S. 630, ___-___, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 2830-31, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993)], compliance with federal antidiscrimination \nlaws cannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a \nconstitutional reading and application of those laws.\") (emphasis added). \n[48] In more detail, the Fordice Court said the following:  \nIf the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects \n— whether by influencing student enrollment or by fostering segregation in other facets of the university system — \nand such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not \nsatisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system. \n505 U.S. at 731, 112 S.Ct. at 2737. \n[49] In Croson, Justice O'Connor did argue that a state may act to prevent its powers from being used to support \nprivate discrimination. 488 U.S. at 491-92, 109 S.Ct. at 720-21 (plurality opinion) (\"[A] state or local subdivision, (if \ndelegated the authority from the State) has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its \nown legislative jurisdiction.\") (emphasis added). Hence, a specific state actor can act to prevent the state from being \nused as a \"passive participant\" in private discrimination. This power does not create wide-ranging authority to remedy \nsocietal discrimination, however. \n[50] The plaintiffs argue that indeed there is no narrow tailoring, for at least the following reasons: (1) In 1992, more \nthan two-thirds of all admission offers to blacks, and a majority of all blacks who matriculated, involved out-of-state \nresidents, thus undercutting the law school's stated purpose of remedying past discrimination in Texas. (2) The \nsystem of preferences has no termination date, thus indicating that there is no connection between the plan and a \nbona fide remedial purpose. (3) Preference is given even to blacks and Mexican Americans who graduated from \nprivate secondary schools and thus did not suffer from state-ordered racial discrimination.  \nThe law school apparently chose admission goals of 5% blacks and 10% Mexican Americans because those are the \nrespective percentages of college graduates in Texas who are black and Mexican American. Nothing in the record, \nhowever, establishes any probative correlation between the degree of past discrimination and the percentage of \nstudents from a minority group who graduate from college. \nThere is no history either of de jure discrimination against Mexican Americans in education at any level in Texas or of \nde facto discrimination against Mexican Americans by the law school. Therefore, it is puzzling that the law school \nwould set an admissions goal for Mexican Americans that is twice that of blacks, as to whom the history of de jure \ndiscrimination in Texas Education in general, and by the law school in particular, is irrefutable. \nIf fashioning a remedy for past discrimination is the goal, one would intuit that the minority group that has experienced \nthe most discrimination would have the lowest college graduation rate and therefore would be entitled to the most \nbenefit from the designed remedy. The goals established by the law school are precisely the reverse of that intuitive \nexpectation and are more reflective of a goal of diversity (which we hold is not compelling) than of a goal of \nremedying past discrimination. \n[51] This finding also affected the court's analysis in denying prospective relief and compensatory damages. \n[52] The district court applied a burden-shifting scheme similar to the methodology used in the title VII context. 861 \nF.Supp. at 579-80 (citing St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). The \n\nlaw school concedes that the burden-shifting exercise was unnecessary, but it maintains nonetheless that the \n\"ultimate burden of proof,\" including proof of damages, rests upon the plaintiffs. See id. \n[53] Some of Justice Powell's dicta in Bakke also squarely supports the plaintiffs' claim that once discrimination is \nproved, the defendant bears the burden of proving no damage. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 2763-64 (opinion \nof Powell, J.). \n[54] Compare Henson v. University of Ark., 519 F.2d 576, 577-78 (8th Cir.1975) (per curiam) (placing burden of \npersuasion on white applicant to show affirmative action program prevented her admission) and Martin v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F.Supp. 1318, 1345 (W.D.N.C.1979) (holding that plaintiff in nonclass action bears \nburden of proving damages) with Donnelly v. Boston College, 558 F.2d 634, 635 (1st Cir.1977) (dictum) (citing Bakke \nand Mt. Healthy, but finding no causation, as evidence showed that plaintiff would not have been admitted regardless \nof affirmative action) and Heit v. Bugbee, 494 F.Supp. 66, 66-67 (E.D.Mich.1980) (adopting Bakke and Mt. Healthy \nreasoning in toto for firefighter's reverse discrimination claims) and United States v. McDonald, 553 F.Supp. 1003, \n1006 (S.D.Tex.1983) (dictum) (same for discriminatory criminal prosecution). \n[55] The district court concluded that the plaintiffs proved only that they had been denied equal treatment but had \nfailed to \"prove an injury-in-fact.\" 861 F.Supp. at 582. To the extent that the court felt that plaintiffs failed to show \ninjury-in-fact because they failed to prove that they would have been admitted under a constitutional admissions \nsystem, this conclusion should be revisited on remand, where the district court must apply the proper burden and \nredetermine whether plaintiffs would have been admitted. \n[56] We do not opine on any Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case. See, e.g., United Carolina Bank v. Board of \nRegents, 665 F.2d 553, 561 (5th Cir. Unit A 1982) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred a civil rights suit \nbrought by a professor against university officials in their official capacities). This issue is simply not before us. \n[57] For example, if the school is unable to show that plaintiff Carvell would not have gained admission even under a \nconstitutional admissions system, he may be entitled to be compensated for the difference, to which he testified, \nbetween tuition at the law school and tuition at Southern Methodist University School of Law, which he attended \ninstead. The district court should also consider the following paradox: The law school argued strenuously that plaintiff \nElliott did not have standing to sue, as he had been offered admission to the school — albeit at the last moment — \nand had failed to accept that offer. The district court found that this offer of admission had not been communicated to \nElliott. 861 F.Supp. at 566. In considering damages, however, the court held that \"in all likelihood, the plaintiffs would \nnot have been offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible process.\" Id. at 581. The district court \nshould reexamine these contradictory results. \n[58] There is circuit law regarding successive motions, but the pertinent opinions do not examine the standard of \nreview explicitly. See, e.g., Kneeland v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.) (implicit \napplication of de novo review without discussion of standard), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 817, 108 S.Ct. 72, 98 L.Ed.2d 35 \n(1987); United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315 (5th Cir.1982) (application of abuse of discretion review for \ntimeliness determination on second motion where proposed intervenor failed to argue for first motion after remand); \nCalvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Environs Dev. Corp., 601 F.2d 851, 857 (5th Cir.1979) (implicit application of de novo review \nwhere district court treated second motion as both a reconsideration of prior motion and a new motion). \n[59] The associations ground this argument in language taken from the prior appeal. One necessary element for \nintervention is a showing that the present parties will inadequately represent the proposed intervenors' interests. \nWhile the associations lost on this ground on the last appeal, they now claim that the opinion supports the argument \nthat the law school's defense is inadequate. In the last appeal, we cited Jansen v. City of Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336 \n(6th Cir.1990), as support for the following statement: \"Nor have the proposed intervenors shown that they have a \nseparate defense of the affirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\" Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 606. \nBecause the law school, now after trial, still has not asserted the associations' title VI defense, the associations \nmaintain that they now can meet their burden.  \nIn Jansen, however, the court found that the proposed intervenors had an interest different from that of the defendant \ncity. 904 F.2d at 343. This was the basis for that court's holding that the city's representation was inadequate. See id. \n(\"Proffering this alleged violation of the consent decree as an affirmative defense is directly counter to the City's \ninterest.\") (emphasis added). Here, we have already found that the law school's and the associations' interests are \nthe same. Jansen therefore does not support intervention. \n\n[60] At least one set of commentators has eschewed this traditional rule. Their position is that \"[a]ny denial of \nintervention should be regarded as an appealable final order.\" 7C CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR MILLER & \nMARY KAY KANE, supra, § 1923, at 508. Under this proposed rule, the federal court would \"affirm denial of \nintervention when previously, having determined on the merits that the trial court was right, it would dismiss the \nappeal.\" Id. at 509. We have acknowledged that this would be the better rule. See Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, \n1279 n. 26 (5th Cir.1975) (citing Charles A. Wright, Arthur Miller & Mary Kay Kane, supra). In fact, the Hopwood I \npanel affirmed rather than dismissing for want of jurisdiction. Under the suggested rule, because we would have a \nfinal order on the merits from a previous panel on this issue, this case would probably be at an end. Nonetheless, as \nthe anomalous rule constitutes our circuit caselaw, we are bound to follow it. \n[61] A dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, leaves open the possibility that the deficiency can be cured. If that \noccurs, no issue preclusion exists. See 7C CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & EDWARD H. COOPER, \nsupra, § 4436, at 338. It is at this point in the analysis that \"changed circumstances\" may become relevant. Arguably, \nthe \"changed circumstances\" analysis, in effect, \"cures\" the earlier jurisdictional deficiency. Thus, if the circumstances \nof the case change to such an extent that jurisdiction would lie, the subsequent motion to intervene should not be \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In effect, the posture of the case has changed, as it would any time a given \njurisdictional problem is cured. \n[62] In Hopwood I, we decided that (1) the interests of the associations were adequately represented by the law \nschool and the state, and (2) as a practical matter, disposition in the principal suit would not impair or impede either of \nthose groups' interests. 21 F.3d at 605. The law of the case doctrine militates against revisiting that decision here.  \nFor purposes of any future litigation, however, we note a necessary effect of our previous holding when coupled with \nthe law school's failure to raise a title VI argument: Neither the district court's decision nor ours in this appeal is \nbinding on the associations as res judicata, law of the case, collateral estoppel, or any other theoretical bar. \nIn short, as the title VI issue has not been litigated, the associations are not precluded from instituting a separate and \nindependent title VI challenge to the law school's use of the TI. We neither express nor imply an opinion on the \nviability of such a challenge. \n[1] League of United Latin American Citizens, Council No. 4434 v.

(\"[A]lthough its precise \ncontours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently \n`compelling' at least in the context of higher education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that \ninterest.\"). \n[18] I readily concede that problems are encountered when efforts are made to apply the Supreme Court's Bakke \ndecision. Panel Opn. at 941-42, 944, & 944 (respectively pointing out that (1) Bakke comprises multiple opinions and \ndivergent analyses, (2) no Justice, other than Justice Powell, discusses diversity, and (3) Bakke is questioned in \nAdarand). The panel opinion fails to describe this last problem with precise accuracy. That opinion's expurgated \nversion of the quotation at 26, lines 736-42 makes it appear as though the Adarand majority questioned Bakke. In full, \nthe sentence reads \"[the Court's] failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved \nthe proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.\" Thus, although the Court acknowledges that \nBakke et al. left things unresolved, I do not read this quotation, (as the panel opinion suggests) as an order to throw \nout Bakke — bath water, baby, and all.  \nNevertheless, the fractured nature of Bakke's holding has left more questions than answers in its wake. As observed \nin the instant panel opinion, there has been \"no [other] indication from the Supreme Court, . . . [whether] the state's \ninterest in diversity [in higher education] constitutes a compelling justification for governmental race-based \nclassifications.\" Panel Opn. at 945. I agree that Bakke is the only indication that diversity is a compelling interest. But, \nunlike the panel opinion, which jettisons Justice Powell's Bakke opinion because of its singularity, I find that \nsingularity to be precisely the factor that makes Justice Powell's opinion the most pertinent Supreme Court statement \non this issue. Therefore, when and if the Supreme Court addresses this case or its analog, the Court will have no \nchoice but to go with, over, around, or through Justice Powell's Bakke opinion. By assuming, as I do, that diversity is \na compelling interest, however, these problems are avoided altogether. \n[19] Recently, in Adarand the Supreme Court stated that it had \"altered the [equal protection] playing field in some \nimportant respects.\" ___ U.S. at ___, 115 S.Ct. at 2118. In her opinion for the majority, however, Justice O'Connor \nrepeatedly emphasizes that Adarand did not drive a stake through the heart of affirmative action. To the contrary, she \nemphatically states, \"we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\" Id. at ___, \n115 S.Ct. at 2117 (quoting Fullilove, 448 U.S. 448, 519, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2795, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring in judgment)). Moreover, \"[w]hen race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such \naction is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the `narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous \ncases.\" Id.  \nIt seems to me that as a practical matter, Adarand resolves very little. In fact, the much heralded change is quite \nlimited: Race-based classifications, imposed by the federal government, are now subject to strict scrutiny. Curiously \n\n(or perhaps not so curiously given the enigmatic difficulty of the task), the Supreme Court declined to define \ncompelling interest or to tell us how to apply that term. Indeed, the Court did not even decide the case before it, \nopting instead to remand the case for further adjudication. \n[20] Id. (\"[W]hen race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within the \nconstitutional constraints if it satisfies the `narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.\"). \n[21] Although I assume without deciding that diversity is a compelling interest, if I had no choice but to address \ncompelling interest I would do so in the context in which the issue is presented, i.e., the constitutionally permissible \nmeans of constructing an entering a class at a public graduate or professional school. This unique context, first \nidentified by Justice Powell, differs from the employment context, differs from the minority business set aside context, \nand differs from the redistricting context; it comprises only the public higher education context and implicates the \nuneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12, 98 S.Ct. at 2759-60. \nConsequently, we play with fire when we assume an easy crossover of Fourteenth Amendment maxims pronounced \nin cases decided in such other contexts.  \nThe panel opinion concludes that this contextual distinction is unimportant, holding that, whatever the context, \nremedying the past effects of discrimination is the only compelling interest that can justify a racial classification. Panel \nOpn. at 944-46. That opinion acknowledges, however, that Supreme Court precedent does not go this far: namely, \nthe higher education context is different. Indeed the panel opinion quotes Justice O'Connor's words expressly stating \nthat higher education is different. Panel Opn. at 945 n. 27 (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, \n286, 106 S.Ct. 1842, 1853, 90 L.Ed.2d 260 (1986) (\"[A]lthough its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in \nthe promotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently `compelling' at least in the context of higher \neducation to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that interest.\")). \n[22] United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S.Ct. 1053, 1066-67, 94 L.Ed.2d 203 (1987). \n[23] Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316, 98 S.Ct. at 2761-62. In the portion of his opinion that addresses narrow tailoring, Justice \nPowell concluded that California's admission process misconceived the concept of \"diversity.\" Id. California's \npreferential program, focused as it was solely on aiding minority applicants, was not necessary to attain diversity. Id. \n[24] In the instant litigation, the law school created its own Catch-22 by advancing two putative compelling interests \nthat ultimately proved to produce so much internal tension as to damage if not fatally wound each other. Under the \nbanner of prior discrimination, Texas had no choice but to single out blacks and Mexican-Americans, for those two \nracial groups were the only ones of which there is any evidence whatsoever of de facto or de jure racial discrimination \nby the State of Texas in the history of its educational system. But, by favoring just those two groups and doing so with \na virtual quota system for affirmative action in admissions, the law school estops itself from proving that its plan to \nachieve diversity is ingenuous, much less narrowly tailored. \n[25] I also concur in my colleagues' conclusion that intervention by the two black student organizations is not \nmandated, and do so for the same reasons. \n[26] Panel Opn. at 958-59. \n[27] Hay v.

Hopwood, a white female, and Douglas W. Carvell, Kenneth R. Elliott, and David A. \nRogers, three white males, have brought suit against the defendants 1 alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, \n42 U.S.C.A. ß 1981 (West Supp. 1994), 42 U.S.C.A. ß 1983 (West 1981), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.S.C.A. ß 2000d (West 1981). 2 All of these provisions prohibit discrimination because of race. For the alleged vio-\nlations, the plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The plain-\ntiffs contend the defendants discriminated against them by favoring less qualified black and Mexican American appli-\ncants for admission to the University of Texas School of Law through the use of a quota system. This cause was tried \nbefore the Court, without a jury, on May 16th through May 20th and May 23rd through May 25th, 1994. \n \n1    Defendants Bernard Rapopart, Ellen C. Temple, Lowell H. Lebermann, Jr., Robert Cruikshank, Thomas 0. \nHicks, Zan W. Holmes, Jr., Tom Loeffler, Mario E. Ramirez, and Martha E. Smiley are sued in their official ca-\npacities as members of the University of Texas Board of Regents. Defendant University of Texas Board of Re-\ngents is the governmental entity created by Defendant State of Texas to administer the operation of the Univer-\nsity of Texas system, which includes Defendant University of Texas at Austin as a component institution. De-\nfendant University of Texas School of Law is an American Bar Association accredited law school operated by \nthe University of Texas at Austin. Defendant Robert M. Berdahl is sued in his official capacity as president of \nthe University of Texas at Austin. Defendant Mark G. Yudof is currently Provost of the University of Texas at \nAustin. At all times pertinent to this lawsuit, Yudof was Dean of the University of Texas School of Law and is \nsued in that official capacity. Defendant Stanley M. Johanson, a Professor of Law, is sued in his official capacity \nas Chair of the University of Texas School of Law Admissions Committee. \n [**4]  \n2    The plaintiffs' Title VI, ß 1981, and ß 1983 claims serve as vehicles to enforce underlying rights guaranteed \nby the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, the law school's admissions program must be evaluated under the \nequal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe cause focuses on one of the most divisive issues faced by society, affirmative action, and highlights the tension \nthat exists when the individual rights of nonminorities come into conflict with programs designed to aid minorities. The \nplaintiffs have contended that any preferential treatment to a group based on race violates the Fourteenth Amendment \nand, therefore, is unconstitutional. However, such a simplistic application of the Fourteenth Amendment would ignore \nthe long history of pervasive racial discrimination in our society that the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to remedy \nand the complexities of achieving the societal goal of overcoming the past effects of that discrimination. Further, the \nSupreme Court, which is continually faced with trying to reconcile the meaning of words written over a century ago \nwith the realities [**5]  of the latter twentieth century, has declined to succumb to an original intent or strict construc-\ntionist argument. Therefore, the Court will decline the plaintiffs'  [*554]  invitation to ignore the law established by the \nhighest court of this land and to declare affirmative action based on racial preferences as unconstitutional per se. The \nissue before the Court is whether the affirmative action program employed in 1992 by the law school in its admissions \nprocedure met the legal standard required for such programs to pass constitutional muster. The Court, having carefully \nconsidered the evidence presented at trial, the arguments of counsel, and the briefing provided by the parties, finds that \nit did not. \n \nI. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND  \n\n \nThe reasoning behind affirmative action is simple-because society has a long history of discriminating against mi-\nnorities, it is not realistic to assume that the removal of barriers can suddenly make minority individuals equal and able \nto avail themselves of all opportunities. Therefore, an evaluation of the purpose and necessity of affirmative action in \nTexas' system of higher education requires an understanding of past discrimination against blacks and Mexican [**6]  \nAmericans, the minorities receiving preferences in this cause, and the types of barriers these minorities have encoun-\ntered in the educational system. \n \nA. Discrimination in Primary and Secondary Education  \nThe history of official discrimination in primary and secondary education in Texas is well documented in history \nbooks, case law, and the record of this trial. The Court, therefore, will address it only in summary fashion. \nEven after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the State of Texas adopted a policy of of-\nficial resistance to integration of its public schools. This policy of resistance resulted in numerous lawsuits and court-\nimposed desegregation plans throughout the past twenty years. Wright, vol. 19 at 38-44; Romo, vol. 17 at 45-51. Many \nof the school districts found to be operating dual systems of education were also found to practice official discrimina-\ntion against black and Mexican American students. Wright, vol. 19 at 40-43; Romo, vol. 17 at 45-51; Rodriguez, vol. 17 \nat 8-9. \nThe problem of segregated schools is not a relic of the past. Despite the fact that the public school population is ap-\nproximately half white and  [**7]  half minority, minority students in Texas attend primarily majority minority schools \nwhile white students attend primarily white schools. Glenn, vol. 23 at 46-49. Further, as of May 1994, desegregation \nlawsuits remain pending against over forty Texas school districts. D-457; see also D-370, 373, 419; Wright, vol. 19 at \n38-40; Romo, vol. 17 at 45-46. \nThe lack of educational opportunity for minorities has been compounded by the lower socioeconomic status of mi-\nnorities in Texas. Statistics continue to indicate significant disparities between minority and nonminority students in \nskills and academic knowledge attained in the public schools. Although the generally lower socioeconomic status of \nblack and Mexican American families is partially accountable for some of the disparities, the gap is exacerbated by his-\ntorically inferior educational preparation of minorities. Glenn, vol. 23 at 30-36. Further, at each educational level, there \nis a marked decline in the level of attainment by minorities, as reflected in comparison of drop-out rates between mi-\nnorities and nonminorities and the percentages of the respective groups that graduate from high school and college. 3 \n \n3    In 1990, the percentage of persons age 25 or older who completed high school was 81.5% non-Hispanic \nwhite, 66.1% black, and 44.6% Hispanic. D-411. College graduate rates for the same year reflect 25.2% non-\nHispanic whites, 12% black, and 7.3% Hispanic. D-412. \n \n [**8] B. Discrimination in Higher Education  \nAs with primary and secondary education, Texas' system of higher education has a history of state-sanctioned dis-\ncrimination. Discrimination against blacks in the state system of higher education is well documented in history books, \ncase law, and the State's legislative history. The State of Texas, by constitution and statute, previously required the \nmaintenance of \"separate schools . . . for the white and colored children.\" See Tex. Const. art. VII, ß 7 (1925, repealed \n1969).  [*555]  This policy resulted in the establishment of segregated schools for blacks that were inferior to the white \nschools. Further, opportunities available to blacks to attend college were extremely limited. 4 \n \n4    The Texas Legislature created Prairie View State Normal & Industrial College for Colored Teachers at Prai-\nrie View (now Prairie View A&M University) for the education of \"students to be taken from the colored popu-\nlation of this State.\" Wright, vol. 19, at 17, 19-21. Until 1947, it remained the only state-supported institution of \nhigher learning open to black students in Texas; no type of professional training was available to blacks. Com-\nmentary, Tex. Const. art. VII, ß 14 (West 1993). In 1947, to avoid integration of the University of Texas, the \nTexas Legislature created the Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University). Id. at 21-22; \nD-382. \n [**9]  In 1946, when Heman Sweatt, a black man, sought admission to the law school and was refused admission, \na Texas court, while holding that Article VII, Section 7 of the Texas Constitution precluded his admission, ordered the \nstate to provide a law school for blacks. See Sweatt v. Painter, 210 S.W.2d 442 (Tex. Civ. App.Austin 1948). The State \nhastily created a makeshift law school that had no permanent staff, no library staff, no facilities, and was not accredited.  \n\n \nSweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 632, 70 S. Ct. 848, 849-50, 94 L. Ed. 1114 (1950). In 1950, a unanimous United States \nSupreme Court ruled that the State of Texas' provisions regarding the legal education of white and minority students \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment and ordered that Sweatt be admitted to the previously all-white University of Texas \nSchool of Law. Sweatt, 339 U.S. at 636, 70 S. Ct. at 851. Sweatt left the law school in 1951 without graduating after \nbeing subjected to racial slurs from students and professors, cross burnings, and tire slashings. Wright, [**10]  vol. 19 at \n24-25. \nThe Sweatt case is the most flagrant incident of state-sanctioned discrimination occurring against blacks at the Uni-\nversity of Texas. However, the record reflects that during the l950s, and into the 1960s, the University of Texas contin-\nued to implement discriminatory policies against both black and Mexican American students. Mexican American stu-\ndents were segregated in on-campus housing and assigned to a dormitory known as the \"barracks,\" as well as excluded \nfrom membership in most university-sponsored organizations. Romo, vol. 17 at 43. Additionally, until the mid l960s, \nthe Board of Regents policy prohibited blacks from living in or visiting white dormitories. Wright, vol. 19 at 26-28; D-\n482. \nBeginning in the mid 1970s, discrimination in Texas' system of higher education came under attack through a \ncourt-ordered investigation by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). \nThe investigation of Texas' system resulted from a lawsuit initiated in 1970 to require HEW to take action to enforce the \nprovisions of Title VI. 5 The court-ordered  [*556]  investigation of ten states, which did not include Texas, began in \n1973. In [**11]  1977, the court extended the order to an additional six states, which included Texas. Ashworth, vol. 12 \nat 8; D-296. \n \n5    See Adams v. Richardson, 356 F. Supp. 92 (D.D.C.), modified and aff'd, 156 U.S. App. D.C. 267, 480 F.2d \n1159 (D.C. Cir. 1973), dismissed sub nom. Women's Equity Action League v. Cavazos, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 48, \n906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \nTitle VI proscribes discrimination that violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSee Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 286-87, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 2746-2747, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 \n(1978). The prohibitions against discriminatory conduct contained in Title VI govern \"programs or activities re-\nceiving Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C.A. ß 2000d. Thus \"Congress was legislating to assure federal \nfunds would not be used in an improper manner.\" United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 206 n.6, 99 S. Ct. \n2721, 2729 n.6, 61 L. Ed. 2d 480 (1979). The University of Texas, as a recipient of Title VI funds, is required to \ncomply with Title VI. \nThe Department of Education, as the successor agency to HEW, is the governmental agency charged with \nthe enforcement of Title VI and the review of programs funded through the DOE. The DOE has promulgated \nregulations to implement the provisions of Title VI, including regulations providing for affirmative action in cer-\ntain circumstances. The regulations state that \"in administering a program regarding which the recipient has pre-\nviously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take af-\nfirmative action to overcome the effects of the prior discrimination.\" 45 C.F.R. ß 80.3(b) (6) (i) (1993). The \nregulations state further that even if a recipient has never implemented discriminatory policies, if its services and \nbenefits have not been equally available to some racial or nationality groups, the recipient may \"establish special \nrecruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available to such group, and take other \nsteps to provide that group with more adequate service.\" 45 C.F.R. ß 80.5(j). \n [**12]  Between 1978 and 1980, the OCR conducted an investigation of Texas' public higher education system. \nThe investigation culminated in a finding that Texas had \"failed to eliminate vestiges of its former de jure racially dual \nsystem of public higher education, a system which segregated blacks and whites.\" D-297. Additionally, the OCR found \nthat Hispanics were significantly underrepresented in state institutions and indicated it would continue its investigation \nof discrimination against Hispanics. Id. \nDuring the early 1980s, the OCR and Texas officials engaged in considerable negotiations regarding efforts to \nbring Texas into compliance with Title VI. Texas, in an effort to achieve a statewide desegregation plan acceptable to \nthe OCR, attempted to address OCR concerns through submission of the Texas Equal Education Opportunity Plan for \nHigher Education (Texas Plan), which included a commitment to the goal of equal educational opportunity and student \nbody desegregation for both black and Hispanic students. D-237. In 1982, Assistant Secretary of Education Clarence \nThomas informed Governor Clements that the Texas Plan was deficient because the numeric goals of black and His-\npanic [**13]  enrollment in graduate and professional programs were insufficient to meet Texas' commitment to enroll \n\n \nthose minority students in proportion to the representation among graduates of the state's undergraduate institutions. \nAshworth, vol. 12 at 16-17; D-284. Texas revised its plan and resubmitted it to the OCR; the OCR found the modified \nplan to be deficient because it did not set targets for increasing minority enrollment for each institution, instead of on a \nstatewide basis, and it did not project achievement dates for the targeted goals. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 19-20; D-219. \nIn 1983, the District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order in the ongoing Title VI-enforcement suit, \nin which the court found that \"Texas has still not committed itself to the elements of a desegregation plan which in de-\nfendants' judgment complies with Title VI.\" D-446. The court ordered the DOE to begin enforcement proceedings \nagainst Texas unless Texas submitted a plan in full conformity with Title VI within forty-five days. Ashworth, vol. 12 at \n22-23; D-446. In response to the order, the OCR submitted thirty-seven suggested measures for increasing black and \nHispanic student enrollment [**14]  in professional and graduate programs at traditionally white institutions. Among \nthe suggestions were that each graduate and professional school should re-evaluate its admissions criteria and that \"ad-\nmissions officers will consider each candidate's entire record and will admit black and Hispanic students who demon-\nstrate potential for success but who do not necessarily meet all the traditional admission requirements.\" D-220. \nIn June 1983, the Texas Plan, as amended to account for the deficiencies identified by the OCR, was accepted by \nOCR as being in compliance with Title VI. 6 However, acceptance was contingent on adequate funding and completion \nof key activities within a specified time. D-314. Further, the Texas Plan was subject to monitoring for compliance until \n1988. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 23, 25-26. \n \n6    D-314. The revised plan raised the goal previously set for increased minority enrollment in graduate and pro-\nfessional schools. The individual goal for UT-Austin had been ten additional black students and two additional \nHispanic students. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 26-27; vol. 13 at 56-58. The revised plan included a commitment to \n\"seek to achieve proportions of black and Hispanic Texas graduates from undergraduate institutions in the State \nwho enter graduate study or professional schools in the State at least equal to the proportion of white Texas \ngraduates from undergraduate institutions in the State who enter such programs.\" D-238a at 5. \n [**15]  In November 1987, OCR contacted the state regarding the expiration of the plan in 1988 and indicated \nOCR would perform a final evaluation to determine if further action would be necessary to bring Texas into compliance \nwith Title VI. OCR further instructed state officials that, pending the evaluation, Texas should continue to operate under \nthe plan. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 32-34; D-323. \n [*557]  Because Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board officials determined Texas had not met the goals and \nobjectives of the plan, the board voluntarily developed a successor plan (Plan II) to avoid a mandate from the federal \ngovernment to negotiate another plan. Ashworth, vol. 12 at 34-35; vol. 13 at 45-46. Plan II did not contain any specific \nnumeric enrollment goals but retained Texas' commitment to increasing black and Hispanic student enrollment. D326 at \n9. \nTo date, OCR has not completed its evaluation to determine if Texas is in compliance with Title VI. 7 However, in \nJanuary 1994, the DOE notified Governor Richards that OCR was continuing to oversee Texas' efforts to eliminate all \nvestiges of de jure segregation and that it would be reviewing the Texas system in light of United States v. Fordice, 120 \nL. Ed. 2d 575,    U.S.   , 112 S. Ct. 2727 (1992). [**16]  Ashworth, vol. 12 at 35-38; D-293. \n \n7    Ashworth, vol. 12 at 32-24. The government, as usual, proceeds with \"all deliberate speed.\" \nAgainst this historical backdrop, the law school's commitment to affirmative action in the admissions process \nevolved. \n \nII. THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS  \n \nA. Evolution of the Admissions Process and Affirmative Action  \nThe law school's admissions procedure was not always a complicated process. In the early 1960s, all applicants \nwho had taken the LSAT and had at least a 2.0 or 2.2 grade point average on a 4.0 scale were accepted. 8 In about 1965, \nthe number of applicants began to significantly exceed the law school's capacity, and, as a result, the law school estab-\nlished additional criteria to aid in the selection process. Smith depo. at 7-8. \n \n8    Johanson, vol. 3 at 12. Ernest Smith, who was a member of the admissions committee from 1965 through \n1970 and dean of the law school from 1974 to 1979, testified by deposition that his recall of the required grade \n\n \npoint average at that time was 3.0. Smith depo. at 7. Although neither Smith nor Johanson had exact recall of the \nnumber, their testimony is consistent in that the qualifications for admission at the time were minimal. \n [**17]  Under the more selective system, a baseline was established each year based on the Texas Index (TI). 9 The \nlaw school automatically admitted applicants whose TI exceeded the baseline, and the admissions committee reviewed \napplicants whose TI was below the baseline. This procedure was used until the late 1960s when an inundation of appli-\ncations meeting the baseline criterion created a class of more students than could be adequately accommodated and pre-\ncluded review of those who did not qualify for automatic admission. That particular year, the first-year class of law stu-\ndents consisted of almost 700 students. Johanson, vol. 3 at 14. \n \n9    The Texas Index is a composite number calculated by the Law School Data Assembly Service (LSDAS) that \nreflects an applicant's grade point average and LSAT score. The weight attributed to each component of the TI is \ndetermined by a prediction formula derived from the success of first year students in preceding years. Johanson, \nvol. 3 at 7-10. \nAs a result, the law school modified [**18]  the admissions process and changed the automatic admission baseline \nto a presumptive admission score. Additionally, the admissions committee began to use a presumptive denial baseline, \nand applicants whose TI fell below that baseline were presumptively denied admission. Also during the late 1960s, the \nlaw school began implementing affirmative action by attempting to recruit minority individuals who had performed well \nin the CLEO program. 10 The only race or ethnic-based scholarships available during this time, however, were limited to \n\"whites only.\" Smith depo. at 12. \n \n10    The CLEO (Council on Legal Education Opportunity) program provided summer training at participating \nlaw schools for minority graduates of various universities. At the end of the training period, the CLEO partici-\npants were given exams. Based on their performance on those exams, some of the participants were admitted to \nthe law school. Smith depo. at 9-10. \nA perception began to develop that the CLEO program had shifted its focus from students [**19]  who were just \nbelow the level where law schools would seriously consider them for admission to students who were significantly be-\nlow that level. Smith depo. at 14-16. Therefore, those responsible for admissions  [*558]  at the law school felt that the \nCLEO program could not successfully prepare the participants in one summer to be competitive students in a regular \nlaw school class. Id. at 16. Additionally, minorities represented only a small percentage of the entire pool of applicants \nto the law school, and law schools around the country competed for the top minority applicants. Id. at 18. In 1971, after \nthe law school terminated its participation in the CLEO program, the law school admitted no black students. Wright, \nvol. 19 at 32. \nIn the early 1970s, because of the university's concern over the few minority students enrolled in the law school, a \nseparate admissions committee, informally called the \"Treece committee,\" 11 was formed to consider applications from \nminority students and disadvantaged nonminority students. 12 The purpose of the committee was to ensure that the appli-\ncants the committee reviewed received \"fuller consideration\" than they would have in the regular [**20]  admissions \nprocess. Smith depo. at 16. The applicants were evaluated separately from the applicants before the regular admissions \ncommittee, and the sole criterion for applicants before the Treece Committee was whether the applicant had a reason-\nable prospect of passing the first year. 13 The Treece committee had no set goals for the number of admissions to be \nmade through the committee, and the number of applicants it admitted had little impact on the regular admissions. 14 In \n1977, the Treece committee considered 500 applicants, including approximately 100 nonminority applicants. Of these \napplicants, the Treece committee admitted sixty-eight minority students and three nonminority students. \"Thus, while \nthe special subcommittee did consider and grant admission to some white applicants, the predominant objective of the \nspecial subcommittee was to increase minority enrollment at the Law School.\" P-1 (Smith memo to Rogers, Oct. 18, \n1978, at 1). \n \n11    The committee was named after the chair of the committee, Professor James Treece. \n12    In the summer of 1974, just before Ernest Smith became dean of the law school, the then president of the \nuniversity, Steve Spurr, expressed concern about the low minority population in the law school. Spurr indicated \nthat a public university had an obligation to train a reasonably representative cross-section of the population in \nthe law and that the TI, as the focus of the admissions procedure, did not adequately account for an applicant's \nability to overcome past economic, cultural, and discriminatory practices. Smith depo. at 17. \n [**21]  \n\n \n13    Johanson, vol. 3 at 15. Professor Johanson did not recall if any of the members of the Treece committee \nwere also members of the regular admissions committee. \n14    During this time, the law school entering class was comprised of 500 students, and no more than 10% of \nthe students could be nonresidents. Johanson, vol. 3 at 17. \nThe applications before the regular admissions committee were subjected to a different process. Because of the \nvolume of applications, the admissions committee could not give individual consideration to each application. There-\nfore, the law school implemented a three-category system to narrow the pool of applications requiring committee con-\nsideration. The first category of applicants, those with TIs above a certain number, were granted \"administrative admis-\nsion\"; that is, administrative personnel automatically sent offers of admission to these applicants based on the appli-\ncants' TIs. A \"presumptive denial\" category was at the other end of the scale, in which administrative personnel \nscreened the applications based on specified criteria. If the administrative [**22]  person determined the file warranted \nfurther consideration, the file was sent to the regular admissions committee. The admissions committee reviewed the \nindividual applications in the middle category or \"discretionary zone,\" which included those referred to the committee \nfrom the presumptive denial category. \nThe law school used this admissions procedure until 1978 when, as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in \nBakke, the law school reassessed its minority admissions procedure. The law school determined that, although its proce-\ndure differed from that at issue in Bakke, the use of the separate committees to evaluate applicants was defective. 15 \nTherefore, then Dean Smith directed  [*559]  the admissions committee to operate as one unit rather than as two sub-\ncommittees and instructed the committee to establish the administrative admission and presumptive denial lines at levels \nthat would increase the number of applicants given individual consideration. P-1. \n \n15    The law school's procedure differed from the Bakke procedure in that no fixed number of seats were set \naside for minorities and some nonminorities were evaluated by the Treece committee. P-1 (Smith memo at 3). \n [**23]  After 1978, Johanson set the lines to allow for a reasonable number of minority candidates to be included \nwith nonminorities in the discretionary zone. Johanson, vol. 3 at 21. The discretionary zone was then divided into five \nor six \"bands.\" 16 The law school offered admission to a set percentage of applicants from each band. The percentage \ndecreased from the first or top band to the last, a reflection of the diminishing credentials of the bands. The minority \napplicants were primarily clustered in the lower bands with few in the upper bands. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 45. \n \n16    Professor Johanson testified the system used five bands, while Professor Wellborn testified there were six \nbands. \nWithin each band, minority and nonminority files were blended into groups of thirty. Each pile was reviewed by \nthree committee members, each of whom was allocated a certain fixed number of votes determined by the yield desired \nfrom a particular band. Therefore, each member of the committee ultimately had total discretion to decide [**24]  \nwhether and what extent to implement affirmative action for each pile of files that person reviewed. Wellborn, vol. 24 at \n9. Professor Wellborn testified he and other faculty members perceived two problems with this system: 1) potential un-\nfairness to nonminority candidates who could be affected by affirmative action solely as a result of the pile in which \nthey were included and 2) the application of personal affirmative action efforts, requiring no justification to the commit-\ntee as a whole, rather than a system based on a set policy. As a result, in 1980, the law school abandoned the banding \nadmissions procedure and formed the minority subcommittee. \nThe minority subcommittee was a part of the full committee that reviewed and voted on nonminority files. All mi-\nnority files below the presumptive admission line were studied by the minority subcommittee. 17 The subcommittee \nwould then bring its recommendations to the full committee. At some point during the middle of the admissions proc-\ness, the subcommittee would present a report to the full committee that summarized the features of the minority files \nbeing recommended for admission. The actual files were also available at the meeting [**25]  so the full committee \ncould make its own determinations about the recommended minority applicants in comparison to the nonminority appli-\ncations pending at the time. At this point in the process, the members of the full committee were involved in reading \npiles of nonminority files and were cognizant of the qualifications of the nonminorities. Although this method often \nresulted in heated discussion and disagreement among committee members over whether to admit a particular candi-\ndate, the process also provided open discussion rather than the silent voting, which could have reflected personal agen-\ndas, that occurred with the banding procedure. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 15. \n \n\n \n17    Evidently, sometime between 1978 and 1991, the automatic or administrative admission line was changed \nto a presumptive admission line. The testimony is unclear as to when this occurred and, apparently, even after \nthe change was made, those involved with the admissions procedure continued to make reference to automatic \nadmission. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26, 66; see also id. at 29 (\"I think we used the term 'automatic admit' for a long \nperiod of time, when it became part of the colloquium but did not describe the process.\"). Dean Sutton, who suc-\nceeded Dean Smith and was dean from 1979 to 1984, established the rule that approximately 55% of the resident \nclass should fall within the presumptive admission category. Johanson, vol. 3 at 24-25. Approximately 75% of \nnonresident applicants are admitted from the presumptive admission category for nonresidents. Id. \n [**26]  In the early 1980s, during these meetings, the committee members spent considerable time debating \nwhether individual minority candidates met minimum admissions standards and, thus, could do passing work in law \nschool. As a result, the full committee often examined specific minority files. The ultimate effect was that the entire \ncommittee voted on each minority applicant that the subcommittee brought before the full committee. Goode, vol. 9 at \n6. However, as the  [*560]  pool of minority candidates improved, the focus of the meetings shifted to choosing among \nminority candidates that the committee knew, based on their TIs, could succeed in law school. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 33. \nTherefore, less full committee review of each individual file became necessary. 18 \n \n18    Because the law school was receiving better qualified minority applicants, the focus of the process changed \nfrom whether to accept a particular minority applicant to a more selective process between the individual minor-\nity applicants. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 33. Had the admissions committee continued to apply its previous standards, \nthe number of minorities in the entering class would have continued to grow. However, the committee elected \ninstead to \"take advantage of this opportunity to have more excellent minority students than we had before, who \nwould be more competitive with the non-minority students, but perhaps in more limited numbers that would still \nconstitute reasonable representation.\" Id. at 35. \n [**27]  Ultimately, the admissions committee determined that the process was inefficient and not the most effec-\ntive way of processing minority applicants. Johanson, vol. 5 at 27. In April 1991, \"[after considerable debate, the [ad-\nmissions] committee, over some strong opposition, directed the chair [Johanson] to form a subcommittee (including \nDeans Aleman and Hamilton and the two minority students) which was to review the minority files and recommend \nsufficient candidates for admission to achieve a class that was 5% Black and 10% MA.\" 19 Therefore, by 1992, the full \nadmissions committee no longer selected individual applicants for admission. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 53. Instead, the mi-\nnority subcommittee compiled a list and presented it to the full committee, which made a judgment of how many offers \nto give to minority applicants. The minority subcommittee was then delegated the task of deciding which individual \nminority applicants were to receive offers of admission. Thus, by 1992, the admissions process, although involving \nsome interaction and exchange of information between the full committee and minority subcommittee, was markedly \nsimilar to the pre-Bakke procedure of two separate [**28]  committees. This 1992 procedure is the crux of this lawsuit. \n \n19    P-25. The percentage goals are based on the percentages of minority college graduates. See supra note 6. \n \nB. 1992 Admissions Process  \nIn 1992, the admissions committee was comprised of nine professors, two assistant deans, and four students. Jo-\nhanson, vol. 6 at 26. The minority subcommittee was comprised of Johanson, Aleman, and Hamilton, all of whom were \nalso members of the full committee. 20 Aleman, however, did not participate in reviewing nonminority applications. Jo-\nhanson, vol. 6 at 25-26. \n \n20    Professor Johanson, who is white, has been on the admissions committee since 1964 and chair of the com-\nmittee since 1973. Dean Aleman is an assistant dean and is Mexican American. Dean Hamilton was an assistant \ndean from 1990 through 1993 and is black. \nIn 1992 when an application [**29]  arrived, administrative personnel placed it in an individual folder, to which \nadditional materials, such as letters of recommendation, were added as they arrived at the law school. Each folder was \ncolor-coded based on two criteria: residency and race or ethnicity. The residency classification indicated whether the \napplicant was a resident or nonresident of Texas. The race or ethnicity classification was based on which of several \nboxes the applicant checked on the application: Black/African American, Native American, Asian American, Mexican \nAmerican, Other Hispanic, White, or Other. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 19-20. \n\n \nThe application deadline was February 1. However, because the law school wished to get early offers sent to top \napplicants in late January if possible, Johanson drew initial presumptive admission lines as soon as he had an initial \ncomputer printout showing the numbers and qualifications of the applicants. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26-27. At this point, \nabout half of the applications were complete; therefore, Johanson drew the initial lines relatively high to avoid too many \nearly offers of admission before the quality of the entire pool of applicants was defined. 21 The goal [**30]  of  [*561]  \nthe initial presumptive admission lines Johanson drew was to ensure that the top candidates in each category received \noffers of admission from the law school as soon as possible. 22 \n \n21    At some point in the process, the presumptive admission line for nonminority resident admissions was ad-\njusted downward to ensure that approximately 55% of the resident admissions would be presumptively admitted. \nThe 55/45 split did not apply to nonresident applicants, approximately 75% of whom were admitted presump-\ntively on the basis of their TI. See supra note 17. \n22    Johanson, vol. 3 at 26. In 1992, the law school received approximately 2100 resident applications and 2300 \nnonresident applications. Johanson, vol. 3 at 35. The pool of nonresident applicants was very strong, many with \ncredentials well above those of the presumptively admitted residents. Id. at 36. Accordingly, the presumptive \nadmission and denial scores were set at a higher level for nonresident applicants. However, as with resident ap-\nplicants, lower scores were set for Mexican American and black nonresident applicants than for nonminority \nnonresident applicants. \nJohanson testified the enrollment yield for nonresidents is approximately 26%, meaning that the law school \nhas to offer approximately four nonresidents admission to enroll one. Id. at 37 The enrollment yield for residents \nis 66 to 68%, that is, for every 100 offers of admission, 66 to 68 resident applicants accept.  \n [**31]  Once Johanson determined which files were in the presumptive admission category, he conducted a pre-\nliminary review of the files. 23 By the end of the admissions process, Johanson reviewed 300 to 350 resident files and \n200 to 250 nonresident files in this category. Johanson, vol. 3 at 32-35. In his review of these files, Johanson checked to \nsee if the applicant's TI was inflated by high grades in a noncompetitive major or at a weak school or if there was some \nother questionable feature of the applicant's file. Johanson generally held those files for further review in the discretion-\nary zone. Johanson dropped approximately ten percent of the presumptive admission applicants into the discretionary \ncategory. Those applicants with a high TI reflecting a high LSAT and high grades in a rigorous major at a leading un-\ndergraduate institution were admitted by Johanson, who had unilateral authority to admit any applicant in this category \nwithout further consultation with the full admissions committee. D-362. \n \n23    Johanson reviewed minority and nonminority files together as a group during the preliminary review proc-\ness. Johanson, vol. 6 at 55. \n [**32]  At the other end of the spectrum, Johanson set another line, and applicants whose TIs fell below that line \nwere presumptively denied admission. One or two members of the admissions committee reviewed each application in \nthis category to determine if the TI adequately reflected the applicant's likelihood of success in law school or competi-\ntive standing relative to the entire applicant pool. Johanson, vol. 3 at 31-32; P-41; D-362. Generally, as a result of this \nreview, twenty to forty files were upgraded from the presumptive denial zone to the discretionary zone, although Johan-\nson did not recall the specific number of files moved to the discretionary zone in 1992. Johanson, vol. 5 at 24-25. \nThe middle category was comprised of those applicants whose TIs fell between the presumptive denial line and the \npresumptive admission line, those applicants who Johanson had moved down from the presumptive admission category, \nand those applicants who reviewers had moved up from the presumptive denial category. In the middle discretionary \ncategory, reviewers focused less attention on the applicant's numbers, as all were relatively close, and instead carefully \nevaluated the applicant's qualifications [**33]  as reflected by the entire file. Goode, vol. 9 at 4; D-362. \nThe standards the law school applied to assess applicants in this system differed based on race and national origin \nin two ways. First, Johanson's determination of the presumptive admission and denial TIs varied between nonminorities \nand minorities. 24 By March 1992, Johanson had lowered the presumptive admission score for resident nonminorities \nfrom a threshold setting of 202/90 to 199/87. 25 Similarly, Johanson lowered the  [*562]  presumptive admission score \nfor Mexican American applicants from 196/84 to 189/78 and the presumptive admission score for black applicants from \n192/80 to 189/78. P-49. The presumptive denial score for nonminorities was 192/80, and the presumptive denial score \nfor blacks and Mexican Americans was 179/69. Thus, the presumptive denial score for nonminorities was higher than \nthe presumptive admission score for minorities. \n \n\n \n24    Johanson's setting of these scores was a process that evolved over the course of the admissions process \nbased on the pool of applicants, the number of offers, and the number of acceptances. Initially, the numbers were \nset high and lowered as the yield from offers and composition of the entering class began to develop. Johanson, \nvol. 5, at 10-11; P-38 - P-44. \n [**34]  \n25    P-38. In 1992, the law school was faced with two different types of TIs, one based on a two digit LSAT \nscore and one based on a three digit LSAT score. This was a result of the change in the scaling of the LSAT \nfrom a 10-to-48 scale to a 120-to-180 scale. Johanson therefore had to set presumptive lines coordinated to two \nseparate TI formulas to accommodate the two types of TIs received for applicants. Johanson, vol. 3 at 26-27. \nAdditionally, the law school admissions committee had different procedures for the review of nonminority and mi-\nnority files in the discretionary zone. Nonminority files were divided into stacks of thirty, which were reviewed by three \nmembers of the admissions committee. 26 Each person on the three-person subcommittee voted, on an individual basis \nwith no verbal or written explanation, to offer admission to a set number of applicants from within the stack of thirty \nfiles. 27 After the three members completed their independent screening of the files, Johanson compiled a master tally \nsheet reflecting the number of votes received by each applicant in the group of  [**35]  thirty-five. See, e.g., P-73. Sub-\nject to Johanson's review, those applicants that received two or three votes were offered admission. 28 In 1992, the law \nschool made an average of nine offers of admission per stack. P-58. Those who received no votes were automatically \ndenied admission at that time. 29 The law school sent a letter offering applicants who received one vote a place on the \nwaiting list. \n \n26    In 1992, the admissions committee reviewed 18 stacks in the nonminority discretionary zone-17 stacks of \n30 files and one stack of 16 files. P-58, P-59. This process began in early March and was virtually complete by \nmid to late April. Johanson (by depo.), vol. 25 at 7. \n27    In 1992, Johanson allotted each person on the subcommittees nine votes per stack. D-332 at A-29. Commit-\ntee members were required to screen five stacks. P-55. Therefore, although each member of the admissions \ncommittee reviewed more than one stack of files, no individual reviewed all the files in the discretionary zone. \n28    Johanson testified that he had \"rarely, if ever\" vetoed a committee recommendation based on two or three \nvotes, except in instances where an administrative problem might make an individual ineligible for law school. \n [**36]  \n29    Johanson, in rebuttal testimony provided by deposition, testified, \"Those candidates who receive zero votes \nto admit, they're done. I don't even look at their files. Three people have said in comparison to our applicant pool \nthey are not worthy of being admitted. They will-the next day they will get their denial . . . .\" Johanson (by \ndepo.), vol. 25 at 10 (emphasis added). This testimony contradicts the statement in the law school's \"Statement \nof Policy on Affirmative Action,\" which states that all final decisions on each applicant file are made by Johan-\nson. See D-362 at 4. \nThe minority subcommittee reviewed the minority files. In theory, each member of the subcommittee was to be part \nof the three-person subcommittees that reviewed the nonminority files. The testimony reflected, however, that in 1992 \nAleman was not on any of the nonminority screening subcommittees. Compare D-362 with Johanson, vol. 6 at 26. Ac-\ncording to the testimony, instead of each member of the minority subcommittee performing an individual review of the \nminority files, as was the procedure for review [**37]  of nonminority files, the minority subcommittee met as a group \nand reviewed each minority applicant's file. 30 The subcommittee did not review a set number of files at each meeting \nbut, instead, made as many decisions as the members felt comfortable with until their \"decision-making powers started \nto wane.\" Johanson, vol. 5 at 30. Resident presumptive denial minority files were screened exclusively by Johanson and \nHamilton. Id. at 25. \n \n30    Both Johanson and Hamilton attended all the meetings; Aleman's attendance was not regular. Frequently, \nstudent members of the subcommittee attended the meetings, although they were not voting members of the sub-\ncommittee. Johanson, vol. 5 at 28-29. \nThe members of the minority subcommittee attended the meeting of the full committee and provided the full com-\nmittee with a summary of the files the subcommittee believed to be good applicants for admission. Wellborn, vol. 24 at \n18. Although the evidence  [*563]  reflected that the subcommittee shared general information about the [**38]  minor-\nity pool of applicants with the full committee, the minority subcommittee's admission decisions on individual applicants \nwere virtually final. 31 \n \n\n \n31    Johanson testified that, although a \"particularly naughty problem\" might be brought before the entire com-\nmittee, almost all final decisions were made by the subcommittee. Johanson, vol. 5 at 29; see also Johanson, \nvol. 6 at 47. \n \nC. Admission Goals and Guidelines  \nThe law school is the State's premier law school and is top-rated nationally. The cost of a legal education at the law \nschool, a state-supported institution, is inexpensive in comparison to other schools of its caliber and, therefore, a bargain \nfor the quality of education the law school's students receive. As a consequence, over 4000 applicants to law school \neach year compete for approximately 500 available seats. 32 \n \n32    The law school received 4,494 applications for the fall 1992 incoming class. It offered admission to 936 \napplicants to fill a class of slightly over 500 students. D-447 (Aff. of Rita Bohr at A-4). The overall median GPA \nfor entering students was 3.52, and the overall median LSAT was 162 (89th percentile). D-433. The median fig-\nures for nonminorities were a GPA of 3.56 and an LSAT of 164 (93rd percentile); for blacks, a GPA of 3.30 and \nan LSAT of 158 (78th percentile); and for Mexican Americans, a GPA of 3.24 and an LSAT of 157 (75%). Id. \n [**39]  In selecting the entering class, the law school admissions committee has two specified requirements it must \nachieve. First, state law mandates the percentage of nonresidents that may be included in the entering class. In 1992, the \nlaw school was prohibited from having more than fifteen percent nonresidents in the entering class. 33 The other fixed \nfigure to which the admissions committee must adhere has been set by the Board of Regents. This mandate requires the \nentering class to be composed of at least 500 students. \n \n33    Johanson, vol. 4 at 9, 31. The percentage of nonresidents that may comprise an entering class has recently \nbeen increased to 20%. Johanson, vol. 4 at 46. \nIn addition to these established figures, the law school attempts to meet the targets established by the Office of \nCivil Rights through the Texas Plan of ten percent Mexican American students and five percent black students in an \nentering class. Johanson, vol. 4 at 10. These numbers reflect an effort to achieve an entering class with [**40]  levels of \nminority enrollment generally consistent with the percentages of black and Mexican American college graduates. The \nOCR figures, however, are aspirations only, subject to the quality of the pool of applicants. Johanson, vol. 4 at 9; \nGoode, vol. 9 at 12-13. \nPersonal interviews are not part of the law school's admission process. 34 Therefore, the law school must make its \ndecision based on the information provided in the applicant's file, which, in addition to the application form and LSDAS \nmaterial, may include a personal statement or letters of recommendation. The law school used the TI as an administra-\ntive tool to order candidates for review in the admissions process. However, the law school did not rely solely on the TI \nas the basis for admissions decisions but instead used it to create presumptions that could be overcome upon individual \nreview of the files. 35 The importance of individual review stems from the fact that the applicants selected for admission \ncome from a relatively narrow band within the full range of scores, and a difference of few points does not necessarily \ncorrelate with more successful work in law school. Johanson, vol. 3 at 11; Stein, [**41]  vol. 18 at 15. Further, the TI \ndoes not adequately reflect the qualifications and characteristics a law school should consider in developing a diverse \nstudent body, which provides substantial educational benefit for all members of a law school class. Brest, vol. 22 at 14. \n \n34    Nevertheless, Hamilton, as assistant dean of admissions responsible for recruiting the law school class, ac-\ntively recruited minority students through \"one-on-one\" discussions and scholarship enticements. Hamilton, vol. \n2 at 4-5, 9, 12-13. \n35    The practice of using the GPA/LSAT index as a sorting mechanism is used by many nationally prominent \nlaw schools. Brest, vol. 22 at 13-14; Stein, Vol. 18 at 15; Bollinger, vol. 16 at 11-14 ; Wegner depo. at 9-10. \nHowever, none rely on the index as the sole basis for admission decisions. Id.; see also D-448. \n \n [*564] III. THE PLAINTIFFS  \nIn 1992, Hopwood, Elliott, Carvell, and Rogers applied for admission to the law school. Hopwood is a white fe-\nmale; Elliott, Carvell, and Rogers [**42]  are white males. None of the plaintiffs are Mexican American and all are resi-\ndents of Texas. 36 \n \n\n \n36    The defendants contend that Hopwood should have been evaluated as a nonresident and, accordingly, \nwould not have been in the presumptive admit range for nonresidents. However, Johanson testified that Hop-\nwood did not misrepresent her status to the law school. She stated in her application she was married to a person \nin the military who was stationed in Texas at the time of her application. The law school treated her application \nas that of a resident throughout the process. Johanson, vol. 5 at 14. Further, Hopwood's residency classification \nwas consistent with the law school's policies in effect at the time. Id.; Johanson, vol. 4 at 44-45; Hopwood, vol. \n8 at 12-13. \n \nA. Cheryl Hopwood  \nCheryl Hopwood had a TI of 199, which placed her in the resident presumptive admit range. Hopwood's TI reflects \na 3.8 grade point average and an LSAT score of 39. 37 Hopwood's application indicates she received an associate's \n[**43]  degree in accounting from Montgomery County Community College in May 1984 and a bachelor's degree in \naccounting from California State University in Sacramento in 1988. The application further indicates she is a certified \npublic accountant in California, she worked twenty to thirty hours a week while obtaining her undergraduate degree, \nand she was active in Big Brothers and Big Sisters in California. P-145. Hopwood submitted an additional letter to the \nlaw school dated January 22, 1992, requesting permission to attend law school on a limited basis the first year, if ac-\ncepted, because of the needs of her child, who had been born with cerebral palsy. 38 Hopwood's application file contains \nno letters of recommendation. 39 Additionally, her responses to the questions are brief and do not elaborate on her back-\nground and skill. She provided no personal statement with the application. 40 \n \n37    Hopwood's LSAT score placed her in the 83rd percentile, well below the median LSAT for nonminorities \nin the 1992 entering class. P-145; D-433. Her two-digit TI was an 87, which correlates to 199 in the three-digit \nscoring system. \n [**44]  \n38    Hopwood testified that although her child was initially diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she has been found to \nhave an extremely rare muscle disease and is severely handicapped. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 8-9. This information is \nnot included in her admission file. \n39    Hopwood testified that although she had been prepared to submit letters of recommendation, a person in the \nadmissions office informed her that, because of the large number of applications, the school did not have time to \nlook at recommendations. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 6. \n40    Hopwood testified that while in high school, she applied for college at Temple, Princeton, and Penn State \nand was offered admission at each school. However, because she had to pay for her own education and had to \nwork her way through school, she could not afford to go to these schools. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 4. However, this \ninformation is not included in Hopwood's application despite the following statement on the application: \"Please \nmake any other comments about your college transcripts or your preparation for college (such as disadvantaged \neducational or economic background) that you believe will help the Admissions Committee in evaluating your \napplication.\" \n [**45]  After his initial review of Hopwood's file, Johanson dropped her from the presumptive admission zone to \nthe discretionary zone because, in his evaluation, she had not attended schools that were academically competitive with \nthose of the majority of the applicants, had a large number of hours at junior colleges, and was able to maintain a high \nGPA although working a substantial number of hours. 41 Her file was subsequently reviewed by a three-member sub-\ncommittee of the admissions committee, which was comprised of Associate Dean Michael Sharlot, Dean Hamilton, and \na law student. P-217 (Answer to int. 3). Because Hopwood received only one vote as result of the subcommittee review, \nthe law school sent her a letter, dated April  [*565]  8, 1992, offering her a place on the waiting list. 42 \n \n41    Johanson, vol. 5 at 14-17. Johanson believed that Hopwood's ability to work a significant number of hours \nwhile maintaining a high GPA was indicative of earning her GPA while on \"a fairly slow track\" at a non-\ncompetitive institution. Id. at 15-16. In contrast, Associate Dean Sharlot found that Hopwood's achievement of a \nhigh GPA while working was a \"definite plus.\" D-334. This \"plus,\" however, was insufficient to overcome \nHopwood's below-median performance on the LSAT and attendance at a series of \"very weak schools.\" Id. \n [**46]  \n42    Hopwood received one vote from Hamilton, who was also a member of the minority subcommittee. P-217 \n(Answer to int. 4); D333 at A-37. \n\n \nThe letter, which stated \"we regret that we cannot grant you admission to the 1992 entering class of the Law School \nat this time,\" instructed Hopwood to return the attached form to the law school within three weeks if she wished to be \nplaced on the waiting list. P-145. The letter further instructed Hopwood not to put her name on the list if she would not \nbe able to accept an offer of admission as late as August. Hopwood testified she subsequently called the law school ad-\nmissions office and was told offers could be made from the waiting list through the first week of school. Hopwood, vol. \n8 at 11-12. Hopwood did not put her name on the list because personnel in the law school's admissions office could pro-\nvide no information regarding the likelihood of admittance from the list and Hopwood did not believe she would be in a \nposition to make last minute arrangements for her special childcare needs if she were admitted either just before or in \nthe first week of [**47]  classes. Hopwood, vol. 8 at 12. \nThe Court finds that, under Hopwood's circumstances, she was effectively denied admission when she received the \nApril 8 letter. Her failure to accept a position on the waiting list or to seek a deferral of admission until the following \nyear, which information the Court notes is not included in the law school's April 8 letter to Hopwood, does not negate \nthis fact. 43 \n \n43    The Court notes that during 1992, individuals were offered admission from the waiting list. Of the 332 ap-\nplicants offered a position on the waiting list in 1992, 75 were admitted. D-447 (Aff. of Rita Bohr at A-5). Ham-\nilton testified that as late as the first week of classes, seven persons were admitted from the waiting list. Hamil-\nton, vol. 2 at 65-67. However, the Court also notes from the affidavits of Johanson and Hamilton that Hopwood \nhad little likelihood of acceptance from a waiting list. In fact, Hamilton specifically stated, \"It is my belief that \nMs. Hopwood [would] not have been admitted off the waiting list at a later time.\" D-333 at A-39. \n \n [**48] B. Kenneth Elliott  \nKenneth Elliott applied with a TI of 197, representing a GPA of 2.98 and an LSAT score of 167. Elliott's applica-\ntion indicates he received a B.B.A. in accounting from the University of Texas in 1984, is a certified public accountant, \nand has worked as an auditor or examiner for state agencies since receiving his undergraduate degree. P-153. In addition \nto his personal statement, Elliott's file contains two letters of recommendation from employment supervisors. \nIn the discretionary zone of nonminority applicants, Elliott's file was reviewed by a subcommittee of three that in-\ncluded Johanson. D-332 at A-33. Elliott received no votes, and the law school sent him a denial letter dated April 11, \n1992. P-153. In July 1992, Elliott's father wrote a letter to Dean Mark Yudof in which he requested that Elliott's applica-\ntion for admission be reconsidered. P-165. Elliott's father further stated that Elliott did not know he was writing the let-\nter and that Elliott's \"friends and family all feel that he was not accepted to U.T. because of limited openings at U.T. due \nto mandatory minority and women quotas which use a large percentage of the openings.\" 44 The dean referred [**49]  \nthe letter to Hamilton, who informed Elliott's father that although she was not at liberty to discuss Elliott's application, \nshe would pursue the matter with Elliott if Elliott felt he had been treated unfairly. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 67. Hamilton \ntestified she telephoned Elliott, told him she had received a letter on his behalf, and invited him to come to her office to \nvisit. Id. at 67-68. Hamilton testified Elliott canceled the first appointment and she scheduled a second appointment, \nwhich she canceled. Hamilton testified she subsequently called him back and told him she was placing him on the wait-\ning list. 45 Elliott, however, testified  [*566]  he had no further conversations with anyone at the law school after the \nfailed meetings and did not know he had been placed on the waiting list. Elliott, vol. 7 at 21. \n \n44    P-165. The only copy of the letter in the record is an unsigned draft provided by the plaintiffs. Hamilton \ntestified that the letter actually received by the law school had been administratively misplaced since the sum-\nmer of 1992. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 68-69. \n45    Id. Johanson testified it was \"quite unusual\" for someone to be reconsidered and placed on the waiting list \nwithout Johanson's awareness of the decision. Johanson, vol. 5 at 19-21. He testified he knew nothing about \nElliott being placed on the waiting list. Id. \n [**50]  Hamilton testified that on August 24, she decided to grant Elliott an offer of admission, left a message on \nhis answering machine, and instructed admissions personnel to continue to try to reach him. Hamilton, vol. 2 at 58-59. \nHamilton stated that approximately a week later, after classes had begun, Elliott returned her call but indicated it was \nimpossible for him to attend school at that time. Id. at 59-60. However, in Hamilton's affidavit, submitted to this Court \nas part of the pretrial motions, Hamilton stated that Elliott never responded to her phone calls. D-447 (Supp. Decl. of \nHamilton at 3). Further, Elliott's file contains no letters either notifying him of his placement on the waiting list or his \n\n \nadmission to school, despite the existence of such documentation for others offered admission from the waiting list late \nin the process. \nThe Court finds that Elliott had to have realized, at minimum, his application was under reconsideration when an \nassistant dean initially contacted him. However, being offered a position on the waiting list, as the Court has already \nfound, is not equivalent to admission. To determine whether Elliott actually received an offer of admission,  [**51]  the \nCourt must evaluate the conflicting testimony of Elliott and Hamilton. The discrepancies in Hamilton's affidavit and \ntrial testimony, as well as the law school's lack of documentation of Elliott's status, weigh in Elliott's favor. 46 Accord-\ningly, the Court finds that Elliott was not notified of his admission to law school. \n \n46    The Court is not implying that Hamilton testified in an untruthful manner. However, because of the number \nof applicant files Hamilton was required to address and the time pressures under which she was working as the \nbeginning of the school year approached, the Court believes it very possible her recall of the chronology of spe-\ncific events may be inaccurate. \nIn 1992, Elliott also applied to Baylor School of Law and Texas Tech School of Law. He was denied admission to \nBaylor. Although accepted at Texas Tech, a state university, Elliott declined the offer of admission by letter dated June \n2, 1992. See D-40l. \n \nC. Douglas Carvell  \nDouglas Carvell had a TI of 197, which was based on an undergraduate [**52]  GPA of 3.28 and an average LSAT \nscore in the 76th percentile. 47 His application reflects that in 1991 he received his B.A. in political science from Hendrix \nCollege in Conway, Arizona. P-151. The LSDAS report indicates Carvell ranked 98th in his class of 247 at Hendrix \ncollege. P-151; D-336 at A-49. Carvell provided detailed responses to the application questions on typewritten attach-\nments to his application. Carvell's file included three letters of recommendation, one from a professor at Hendrix Col-\nlege that compliments his intellectual abilities but describes his performance as uneven, disappointing, and mediocre. P-\n151. \n \n47    Carvell's application reflects that he took the LSAT twice, receiving a score of 34 (61st percentile) the first \ntime and a score of 164 (91st percentile) the second time. The LSAT factored in his TI is an average of these two \nscores. \nBecause Carvell's TI placed him in the nonminority discretionary zone, his file was reviewed by a subcommittee of \nthree. He received no votes from the two faculty [**53]  members on the subcommittee, Professors Steven Goode and \nMark Gergen, but did get one favorable vote from a student member of the committee. See D-335, D-336. Therefore, by \nletter dated April 15, 1992, the law school offered him a position on the waiting list, which he accepted. While he was \non the waiting list, Carvell's file was reviewed by Associate Dean Michael Sharlot, a member of the admissions com-\nmittee. Sharlot did not vote to admit Carvell from the waiting list. D-334 at A-43 - A-44. By letter dated July 16, 1992, \nthe law school denied Carvell admission. P-151. \nIn addition to the law school, Carvell applied for admission to Southern Methodist University School of Law and \nVanderbilt  [*567]  School of Law. He was denied admission to Vanderbilt, but was accepted at SMU, where he has \ncompleted his first year of law school. Carvell, vol. 10 at 6-7. Carvell also applied to the University of Texas School of \nBusiness and was denied admission. Id. at 12. At SMU, Carvell is pursuing a master's of business administration in a \njoint program with the SMU law school. Id. at 6. \n \nD. David Rogers  \nDavid Rogers had a TI of 197 based on his undergraduate GPA of 3.13 and an LSAT score [**54]  of 166. In the \nearly to mid-1980s, Rogers attended the University of Texas as a student in Plan II, an honors program. However, in \n1985, he was dismissed because of his poor scholastic performance. Rogers, vol. 11 at 55. Rogers subsequently attended \nthe University of Houston-Downtown and received an undergraduate degree in professional writing in 1990. P-171; \nRogers, vol. 11 at 56. In 1992, Rogers received an advanced degree in professional writing from the University of \nSouthern California. P-171. Rogers noted on his law school application that \"as a white who attended an all-minority \nschool for several years, and who was raised by a single mother, I have an unusual understanding of the challenges \nfaced by women and minorities.\" P-171. Rogers's application file contains no letters of recommendation. P-171; see \nalso D-335 at A-46 - A-47. \n\n \nRogers received no votes from any member of the subcommittee that reviewed his file in the nonminority discre-\ntionary zone. By letter dated April 7, 1992, he was denied admission to the law school. P-171. \n \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n \nA. Ripeness and Standing  \nAs a preliminary matter, the defendants contest the ripeness of two of the plaintiffs'  [**55]  claims and the standing \nof all plaintiffs to bring this cause of action. 48 With regard to Hopwood and Elliott, the defendants argue their claims are \nnot ripe because neither was denied admission. 49 As stated above, the Court has found both Hopwood and Elliott were, \nin effect, denied admission to the law school. Therefore, a ripe controversy exists between these two plaintiffs and the \ndefendants. \n \n48    This matter was addressed at length in pretrial motions and hearings, and the transcripts and evidence re-\nlated to those motions are evidence in this cause. \n49    As discussed above, the defendants claim Hopwood voluntarily removed herself from the admissions proc-\ness and Elliott was offered admission. \nThe defendants contend Hopwood lacked standing to challenge the admissions policy because she failed to accept a \nposition on the waiting list or to ask for deferred admission. Therefore, according to the defendants, she has failed to \nexhaust the administrative procedures available to her. The defendants further contend [**56]  all plaintiffs lack stand-\ning in that none can show they would have been granted admission absent the challenged admissions policies. 50 \n \n50    With regard to Elliott, the defendants contend he lacks standing to challenge the initial decision to deny him \nadmission. \nTo have standing to challenge a governmental action, a plaintiff must demonstrate a concrete \"injury in fact,\" a \ncausal relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, and a likelihood the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision. Northeastern Fla. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 124 L. Ed. 2d 586,    U.S.   , 113 S. Ct. 2297, \n2301-02 (1993). However, the \"injury in fact\" in an equal protection case involving a barrier that makes it more difficult \nfor members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of another group is the denial of the equal treatment \nand not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit. Id. at    , 113 S. Ct. at 2303. \nThe defendants assert [**57]  this exception to requiring plaintiffs to show a direct causal relationship is limited in \nits application to challenges to the validity of express set-asides or reservations such as those addressed in City of Jack-\nsonville and Bakke. The Court does not read the requirements for standing set forth in City of Jacksonville  [*568]  to be \nlimited in the manner defendants contend. In defining standing as applied in equal protection cases, the Supreme Court \nreviewed its precedent on the issue. The overarching proposition of the cases the Supreme Court cited in reaching its \nholding was not that the causal-connection exception applied only to specific set-asides, but that an \"injury in fact\" \nstemmed from any governmental barrier that either created a discriminatory obstacle or had the effect of producing une-\nqual access to a governmental benefit. 51 Accordingly, the Court finds all the plaintiffs have standing-they have suffi-\nciently alleged that the law school's admission process is the cause of their injury and that a judicial order could redress \nthe injury. 52 \n \n51    See id. at 2302-03 (discussing Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957, 102 S. Ct. 2836, 73 L. Ed. 2d 508 \n(1982); Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978); and Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S. \nCt. 532, 24 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1970)). \n [**58]  \n52    Further, the law school's 1992 procedure for review of applicants in the discretionary zone effectively pre-\nvents any nonminority candidate from establishing that he or she would have been admitted but for the prefer-\nence given to minority applicants. See infra note 86. \n \nB. Standard of Review  \nAffirmative action plans based on race trigger strict judicial scrutiny.  City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 \nU.S. 469, 493, 109 S. Ct. 706, 721, 102 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1989); see also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 291, 98 S. Ct. at 2748 (Pow-\nell, J.) (\"Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial ex-\namination.\"). Further, \"the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates \n\n \nagainst a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination.\" Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., \n476 U.S. 267, 273, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 1846, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1986); [**59]  see also Croson, 488 U.S. at 494, 109 S. Ct. \nat 722 (reaffirming equal protection analysis is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a classifica-\ntion). \nThe defendants contend, however, strict scrutiny is inappropriate in this cause in light of the Supreme Court's hold-\ning in Metro Broadcasting v. FCC, 497 U.S. 54, 110 S. Ct. 2997, 111 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1990). In Metro Broadcasting, the \nSupreme Court held that affirmative action plans adopted pursuant to federal mandates are subject to intermediate scru-\ntiny-a determination whether the plans serve important governmental objectives and whether they are substantially re-\nlated to the achievement of the objectives. Id. at    , 110 S. Ct. at 3009. The defendants contend that the Texas Plans \nequate to a federal mandate because they stem from the OCR's insistence on full compliance with Title VI, an objective \nthat is within the power of Congress. 53 \n \n53    The defendants also contend a suit against the State of Texas or the University of Texas is an impermissible \ncollateral attack on OCR programs and regulations and, in support of this proposition, cite Milwaukee County \nPavers Ass'n v. Fiedler, 922 F.2d 419 (7th Cir.), cert denied, 500 U.S. 954, 111 S. Ct. 2261, 114 L. Ed. 2d 714 \n(1991). However, in this cause the plaintiffs are not attempting to challenge a federal statute creating minority \nbusiness set-asides by challenging the State's role in the program. Instead, the plaintiffs in this cause are chal-\nlenging the specific procedure the law school voluntarily designed and implemented to achieve affirmative ac-\ntion goals suggested by OCR. The constitutionality of the law school's procedure is not dependent on whether \nthe OCR can require affirmative remedies for a Title VI violation. See Podberesky v. Kirwan, 764 F. Supp. 364, \n374 (D. Md. 1991), rev'd and remanded, 956 F.2d 52 (4th Cir. 1992), on remand, 838 F. Supp. 1075 (D. Md. \n1993). \n [**60]  The Court finds the argument unpersuasive. In Metro, the FCC'S minority ownership programs had been \nspecifically mandated and approved by Congress. Id. at    , 110 S. Ct. at 3008. While it is true that Congress has the \npower to identify and redress the effects of discrimination and has charged the DOE with assuring compliance with Ti-\ntle VI, there is no similar congressional mandate in this cause. Further, the FCC is a licensing body that, pursuant to a \ncongressional mandate, established specific minority ownership policies. The OCR has provided Texas with a number \nof suggested tools Texas may implement to bring the higher educational system into compliance with Title VI; it has \nnot, however, required  [*569]  the State to adopt any specific procedures. Although the defendants characterize the law \nschool's efforts as pursuant to an OCR \"consent decree,\" the evidence reflects that, to date, the State of Texas' efforts to \ncomply with Title VI have been made voluntarily in an effort to avoid a specific mandate or the loss of federal funding. \nAshworth, vol. 13 at 34, 39. \nFurther, under equal protection analysis, the same level of scrutiny applies to race-conscious affirmative action \n[**61]  plans adopted pursuant to consent agreements as to other voluntarily adopted plans. See, e.g., In re Birmingham \nReverse Discrimination Employment Litig., 833 F.2d 1492, 1501 (11th Cir. 1987), aff'd sub nom. Martin v. Wilks, 490 \nU.S. 755, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1989) (Title VII consent decree). Indeed, the most recent circuit court \nopinion analyzing an affirmative action plan in the education context, specifically a scholarship plan adopted in re-\nsponse to protracted litigation and OCR guidelines, upheld the lower court's application of strict scrutiny as the proper \nstandard for review of the plan. See Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 55 (4th Cir. 1992). \nThe most compelling justification for application of strict scrutiny in this context is to provide assurance that indi-\nvidual rights are afforded the full protection they merit under the Constitution. Only by applying strict scrutiny can a \ncourt honestly weigh the validity and necessity of efforts to remedy past wrongs against the rights of otherwise qualified \nnonminorities affected by the efforts.  [**62]  Although the use of racial classifications is disfavored, there are instances \nwhen such classifications serving proper purposes should be upheld. Only through diligent judicial examination can a \ncourt determine if a classification is consistent with constitutional guarantees and not related to \"illegitimate notions of \nracial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S. Ct. at 721. Accordingly, the Court concludes \nthe law school admissions process must be subjected to a strict scrutiny test under the Equal protect ion Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to protect both the integrity of the process and the important individual rights at issue. 54 \n \n54    As an additional point, even if the Court were to find intermediate scrutiny to be the proper standard of re-\nview, the Court would still be required to assess whether the process imposed undue burdens on nonminorities. \nSee Metro Broadcasting,    U.S. at   , 110 S. Ct. at 3026 (\"A congressionally mandated benign race-conscious \nprogram that is substantially related to the achievement of an important governmental interest is consistent with \n\n \nequal protection principles so long as it does not impose undue burdens on nonminorities.\"). As discussed infra \npp. 58-67, the burden imposed upon nonminorities by the law school's admissions procedure is a very troubling \naspect of the process and, ultimately, in this Court's view, renders the process constitutionally impermissible. \n \n [**63] B. Application of Strict Scrutiny  \nStrict judicial scrutiny involves a determination of whether the law school process served \"a compelling govern-\nmental interest\" and whether the process is \"narrowly tailored to the achievement of that goal.\" See Wygant v. Jackson \nBd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 274, 106 S. Ct. 1842, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 1847 (1986) The purpose of ascertaining whether a \ncompelling governmental interest exists is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by ensuring that the goal is important \nenough to use the suspect tool of racial preference. Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S. Ct. at 721. The narrowly tailored \nanalysis \"ensures that the means chosen 'fit' this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the \nmotive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.\" Id. \n1. Compelling Governmental Interest. -Both sides expended considerable time and effort at trial on the issue of \nwhether a compelling governmental interest existed sufficient to justify the need for the law school's affirmative [**64]  \naction program. The defendants offered a number of reasons as justification for the law school's affirmative action pro-\ngram. These reasons are set forth in the law school's \"Statement of Policy on Affirmative Action\": 55 \n  \n    [*570]  To achieve the School of Law's mission of providing a first class legal education to future \nleaders of the bench and bar of the state by offering real opportunities for admission to members of the \ntwo largest minority groups in Texas, Mexican Americans and African Americans; \nTo achieve the diversity of background and experience in its student population essential to prepare \nstudents for the real world functioning of the law in our diverse nation; \nTo assist in redressing the decades of educational discrimination to which African Americans and \nMexican Americans have been subjected in the public school systems of the State of Texas; \nTo achieve compliance with the 1983 consent decree entered with the Office of Civil Rights of the \nDepartment of Education imposing specific requirement for increased efforts to recruit African American \nand Mexican American students; \nTo achieve compliance with the American Bar Association and the American Association of Law \nSchools [**65]  standards of commitment to pluralist diversity in the law school's student population. \n \n  \nD-362. Although all are important and laudable goals, the law school's efforts, to be consistent with the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause, must be limited to seeking the educational benefits that flow from having a diverse student body and to \naddressing the present effects of past discriminatory practices. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 313; 98 S. Ct. at 2760 (environ-\nment fostering robust exchange of ideas makes goal of diversity \"of paramount importance in the fulfillment of [a uni-\nversity's] mission\"); United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 167, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1064, 94 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1987) (\"The \ngovernment unquestionably has a compelling interest in remedying past and present discrimination by a state actor.\"); \nPodberesky, 956 F.2d at 57 (race-related remedy may be used in attempt to remedy effects of past discrimination). Ac-\ncordingly, the Court will evaluate the program in light of these goals.  [**66]  56 \n \n55    This written articulation of the purposes and policy of the law school's affirmative action program and de-\nscription of the 1992 process was prepared in February 1994. Johanson, vol. 6 at 45-46; Yudof, vol. 20 at 30-31. \n56    Notwithstanding the personal views of this judge, it appears the goal of increasing the number of minority \nmembers in the legal profession and judiciary of Texas is not a legally sufficient reason to justify racial prefer-\nences under fourteenth amendment analysis. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 496-98, 109 S. Ct. at 723-24. Further, the \ndesires and goals of a private entity such as the ABA or AALS, though important considerations for an accred-\nited law school, do not provide sufficient justification for racial classifications. Similarly, Texas' \"consent de-\ncree\" with the OCR, though having evidentiary value in terms of past discrimination in Texas' higher education \nsystem, is not, in and of itself, a valid justification. \nThe [**67]  plaintiffs do not dispute that under the holding of Bakke, obtaining the benefits that flow from a ra-\ncially and ethnically diverse student body is a compelling interest justifying the use of racial preferences. 57 Neverthe-\nless, the plaintiffs suggest that under more recent Supreme Court decisions, the only compelling interest recognized for \n\n \nrace-conscious programs is remedying the past effects of racial discrimination. 58 However, none of the recent opinions \nis factually based in the education context and, therefore, none focuses on the unique role of education in our society. 59 \nAbsent an explicit statement from the Supreme Court overruling Bakke, this  [*571]  Court finds, in the context of the \nlaw school's admissions process, obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse stu-\ndent body remains a sufficiently compelling interest to support the use of racial classifications. \n \n57    The plaintiffs do contend the law school's affirmative action program is not narrowly tailored to meet the \nobjective of diversity, an issue the Court will address below. \n58    In support of this proposition, the defendants cite Croson, 488 U.S. at 493, 109 S. Ct. at 722 (\"Unless [ra-\ncial classifications] are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in fact promote notions of racial inferior-\nity and lead to politics of racial hostility.\"), and dissenting opinions from Metro Broadcasting and Johnson v. \nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara, California. See Metro Broadcasting,    U.S. at   , 110 S. Ct. at 3035 \n(O'Connor, J., dissenting); Johnson, 480 U.S. 616, 673-75, 107 S. Ct. 1442, 1473-1474, 94 L. Ed. 2d 615 (Scalia, \nJ., dissenting). \n [**68]  \n59    The Supreme Court recognized the vital role education plays in our society in Brown v. Board of Educa-\ntion: \n  \n   [Education] is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument for \nawakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in \nhelping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may \nreasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. \n \n  \n Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S. Ct. 686, 691, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). \nThe defendants presented evidence, which included the testimony of deans from law schools across the country and \nthe testimony of former and current law students, that the benefit to the law school educational experience derived from \na diverse student population is substantial. See, e.g., Brest, vol. 22 at 22-23; Stein, vol. 18 at 20-21; Bollinger, vol. 16 at \n23-26; Spector, vol. 15 at 9-10. Additionally, several professors testified regarding [**69]  the educational benefit of \nhaving a diverse group of students in the classroom setting. See, e.g., Goode, vol. 9 at 20-21; Yudof, vol. 21 at 59-60. \nAccording to the evidence presented at trial, without affirmative action the law school would not be able to achieve this \ngoal of diversity. Had the law school based its 1992 admissions solely on the applicants' TIs without regard to race or \nethnicity, the entering class would have included, at most, nine blacks and eighteen Mexican Americans. 60 \n \n60    D-441. The Court believes such meager representation would be woefully inadequate in a state university \nsupported, in part, by revenues from all state residents. Further, the Court concurs with the defendants that di-\nversity requires more than token representation of minorities; strict reliance on the TIs for admission would not \nfurther the goal of diversity. \n [**70]  Although under current law the goal of diversity is sufficient by itself to satisfy the compelling governmen-\ntal interest element of strict scrutiny, the objective of overcoming past effects of discrimination is an equally important \ngoal of the law school's affirmative action program. The plaintiffs have asserted that any past discrimination against \nblacks occurred so long ago, it has no present effects and that the law school has never discriminated against Mexican \nAmericans. 61 The plaintiffs further assert the Court should limit its review of past discrimination to official acts and \npolicy of the University of Texas law school and should not consider discrimination in Texas' educational system as a \nwhole. As support for this contention the plaintiffs cite Croson, in which the Supreme Court stuck down a city set-aside \nprogram that required thirty percent of city contracts to be subcontracted to minority businesses. 488 U.S. at 499, 109 S. \nCt. at 724 (\"Like the claim that discrimination in primary and secondary school justifies a rigid racial preference in \nmedical school admissions, an amorphous claim that there has been [**71]  past discrimination in a particular industry \ncannot justify the use of an unyielding racial quota.\"). \n \n61    The plaintiff's expert, James Armor, a senior fellow at the Institute of Public Policy, George Mason Univer-\nsity, in Fairfax, Virginia, testified there are no present direct effects of past discrimination in Texas' educational \nsystem. Armor, vol. 10 at 45-48. Armor testified the only cities in Texas he has visited are Dallas and Houston. \nArmor, vol. 11 at 41. The Court does not find Armor to be a credible witness. \n\n \nRecently, however, the Supreme Court held that a system of higher education is under an affirmative duty to elimi-\nnate every vestige of racial segregation and discrimination in its educational system and to reform those policies and \npractices that required or contributed to separation of the races. United States v. Fordice, \n    U.S.   , 112 S. Ct. 2727, 2743 (1992). Thus, it appears the Supreme Court has recognized that the restrictions it \nhas applied in ascertaining the present effects of past discrimination in the employment context, specifically the prohibi-\ntion against remedying effects of \"societal discrimination\" and discrimination implemented by another governmental \nunit, are not appropriate in the education context. See also Podberesky v. Kirwan, 838 F. Supp. 1075, 1098 & n.79 (D. \nMd. 1993). \"Applicants do not arrive at the admissions office of a professional school in a vacuum,\" and, in fact, have \nordinarily been students in an educational system for sixteen years. Geier v. Alexander, 801 F.2d 799, 809 (6th Cir. \n1986). [**72]  The Court believes, therefore, the residual effects of past discrimination in a particular component of a \nstate's educational system must be analyzed in the context of the state's educational system as a whole. The State's insti-\ntutions of higher education are inextricably linked to the primary and secondary schools in the system. Accordingly,  \n[*572]  this Court has not limited its review to the law school or Texas' higher education system in evaluating the pre-\nsent effects of past discrimination. 62 However, were the Court to limit its review to the University of Texas, the Court \nwould still find a \"strong evidentiary basis for concluding that remedial action is necessary.\" Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 \nF.2d at 55. \n \n62    See also Ayers v. Allain, 893 F.2d 732, 751 (5th Cir. 1990): \n  \n   Brown states that the stigmatizing effects of segregation are not created by legally compelled at-\ntendance but rather from the vestiges of legally compelled separation. Thus the lesson of Brown \nis that the malignancy of apartheid does not vanish in state-sponsored forums simply because at-\ntendance is voluntary and admittance race-neutral. \n \n  \n [**73]  As discussed above, Texas' long history of discrimination against blacks and Mexican Americans in public \neducation is chronicled in court opinions, the findings of the OCR, and the continuing desegregation suits against the \nState. 63 The State of Texas engaged in overt discrimination against blacks until the practices were forcibly dismantled in \nthe relatively recent past. Discrimination in education was at the center of official discrimination against black Texans. \nAdditionally, the University of Texas has a history of racial discrimination. \n \n63    See, e.g., League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 866 (5th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,    \nU.S.   , 114 S. Ct. 878 (1994) (\"Texas' long history of discrimination against its black and Hispanic citizens in all \nareas of public life is not the subject of dispute . . .\"). \nSimilarly, the State has subjected Mexican Americans to discriminatory practices in the education area as reflected \n[**74]  in the findings of unlawful de jure discrimination in the numerous desegregation lawsuits. Less documentation \nexists of overt official discrimination against Mexican Americans than against blacks at the University of Texas. How-\never, the legacy of Texas' discriminatory practices continues to hinder the University of Texas' efforts to attract quali-\nfied Mexican American students. \nIn recent history, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas. The \nevidence reflects that the university has made genuine efforts in the last decade to end discrimination by recruiting and \nmaintaining minority faculty members and students and condemning racial incidents occurring on campus or involving \nstudent organizations. Despite these efforts, however, the legacy of the past has left residual effects that persist into the \npresent. The evidence presented at trial indicates those effects include the law school's lingering reputation in the minor-\nity community, particularly with prospective students, as a \"white\" school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the \nstudent body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile environment for minorities.  \n [**75]  The university's efforts to recruit minorities has led to a modest increase in the number of minorities at-\ntending the law school. However, admissions and recruitment personnel face difficulties in attracting qualified minori-\nties to enroll in the law school. These difficulties stem from negative perceptions of the racial climate at the law school \nas a result of past discrimination. 64 Because of the law school's legacy of discrimination, it must overcome a perception \nthat it is a \"white institution.\" Wright, vol. 19 at 33-34. Recent racial incidents, although not officially sanctioned by the \nschool, have reinforced the perception that the university is hostile to minorities and has hurt its ability to recruit minor-\n\n \nity students. Wright, vol. 19 at 29-31. An affirmative action program is therefore necessary to recruit minority students \nbecause of the past discrimination. \n \n64    Hamilton, vol. 2 at 49-50, 52-53; Wright, vol. 19 at 33-36. Sweatt v. Painter is often studied in undergradu-\nate courses and contributes to undergraduate minorities' perception of the University of Texas as an institution \nthat does not welcome minorities. Wright, vol. 19 at 33-36; Romo, vol. 17 at 64. \n [**76]  The effects of the State's past de jure segregation in the educational system are reflected in the low enroll-\nment of minorities in professional schools, including the law school. The OCR findings and the OCR's continuing re-\nview of Texas' efforts to desegregate demonstrate the pervasive nature of past discrimination in the higher education  \n[*573]  system. 65 As a result of policies of official discrimination in the Texas higher education system, a generation of \nblacks and Mexican Americans who are the parents of those presently of law school age were denied meaningful oppor-\ntunities for higher education. Glenn, vol. 23 at 51-53; Romo, vol. 17 at 63-64; Wright, vol. 19 at 45-47. The denial of \nthese opportunities to the generation of minority parents bears a causal connection to the diminished educational attain-\nment of the present generation. Glenn, vol. 23 at 51-52; Romo, vol. 17 at 53-54. \n \n65    The plaintiffs contend the OCR's findings are invalid because the OCR did not apply the standards recently \nset forth by the Supreme Court in Fordice. However, neither the validity of the OCR investigation, nor the retro-\nactive application of Fordice is the issue before this Court. \n [**77]  Further, many public schools in Texas continued to have a substantial degree of racial and ethnic segrega-\ntion during the 1970s and 1980s, the decades in which the majority of 1992 law school applicants attended primary and \nsecondary schools. Glenn, vol. 23 at 48-51; D-379. This segregation has handicapped the educational achievement of \nmany minorities. The ultimate effect of the inferior educational opportunity, combined with the lower socioeconomic \nstatus of minorities in Texas, is a disproportionately smaller pool of minority applicants to law school. D-379 at 6-7; see \nalso supra note 3. \nIn addition, some minority students enrolled in the law school feel isolated even with the current commitment to af-\nfirmative action and diversity and are often hesitant to participate in class discussion when they are the sole minority or \none of a few minorities in a class. Longoria, vol. 15 at 32-34; Rodriguez, vol. 17 at 24-25. Some minority students con-\ntinue to perceive a hostile racial environment on the campus, which they assert is reflected in insensitive comments by \nfellow students and faculty. Bell, vol. 14 at 16, 29-34; Escobedo, vol. 14 at 41-42; Longoria,  [**78]  vol. 15 at 32-24. \nAccordingly, despite the plaintiff's protestations to the contrary, the record provides strong evidence of some pre-\nsent effects at the law school of past discrimination in both the University of Texas system and the Texas educational \nsystem as a whole. Therefore, the Court finds the remedial purpose of the law school's affirmative action program is a \ncompelling governmental objective. \n2. Narrowly Tailored.-The Court must next decide if the admissions process was narrowly tailored to achieve the \ngoals of diversity and overcoming the present effects of past discrimination. This determination requires the application \nof four factors: the efficacy of alternative remedies; the flexibility and duration of the relief; the relationship of the nu-\nmerical goals to the percentage of minorities in the relevant population; and the impact of the relief on the rights of third \nparties. See United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171, 107 S. Ct. 1053, 1066, 94 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1987). \nThe defendants have shown it is not possible to achieve a diverse student body without an affirmative action pro-\ngram that seeks to admit  [**79]  and enroll minority candidates. Brest, vol. 22, at 15. As stated above, in 1992, the en-\ntering class would have included at most nine blacks and eighteen Mexican Americans, had the review of minorities \nbeen limited to those applicants in the presumptive admit and discretionary zones for white applicants. D-441; Yudof, \nvol. 21 at 44; Johanson, vol. 6 at 38. These numbers reflect the maximum potential and assume no adverse affect on the \nnumber of applicants stemming from the abandonment of affirmative action. \nFurther, the record indicates the ultimate effect of abandoning affirmative action at the law school would be to redi-\nrect minorities to the historically separate state law school at Texas Southern University, thereby resegregating the law \nschool. 66 Alternatives, such as minority scholarships and increased minority  [*574]  recruitment, while effective tools \nin conjunction with the affirmative action program, would not be effective means by themselves to meet the compelling \ngovernmental interests of true diversity and remedying the effect of past de jure segregation. In fact, the record in this \ncase demonstrates that, without affirmative action, the perception of the law  [**80]  school as a \"white\" institution \nwould be exacerbated, which would compound the difficulties of attracting top minority students. Wright, vol. 19 at 36-\n37; Goode, vol. 9 at 19; Rodriguez, vol. 17 at 25. \n\n \n \n66    Ashworth, vol. 12 at 44-45; D-432; D-453; 0-454. In 1971, the year following the Board of Regents disap-\nproval of the law school's participation in the CLEO program, the law school entering class had no blacks. As \nlate as 1974 only ten of the law school's 1600 students were black. Wright, vol. 19 at 31-33. Texas Southern \nUniversity, the law school Texas created to avoid integration of the law school, enrolls almost 50% of all enter-\ning minority law students in Texas. This percentage would increase dramatically in the absence of the law \nschool's affirmative action program. Wright, vol. 19 at 21-22; Ashworth, vol. 12 at 44-45; D432; D-452; D-453. \nThe evidence shows that despite genuine efforts to end discrimination, the legacy of the past continues to hinder the \nlaw school's efforts [**81]  to attract highly qualified minority students. Accordingly, the Court finds affirmative action \nin the law school's admissions program is an effective and necessary means to overcome the legacy of the past and to \nachieve the diversity necessary for a first-class university. \nThe plaintiffs argue the admissions program establishes the functional equivalent of an impermissible quota system \nin which the law school attempts to camouflage quotas through the use of the term \"goals.\" The plaintiffs contend be-\ncause the admissions committee knows the approximate number of students in an incoming class, the five percent black \nand ten percent Mexican American figures translate into specific numbers. \nThe admissions data from the past ten years shows variations in the admission figures for the two groups receiving \nadmissions preferences at the law school-blacks and Mexican Americans. The data reflects that between 1983 and 1993, \nthe percentage of black admissions varied from a low of 3.2 percent, occurring in 1987, to a high of 9.3 percent in 1983. \nThe percentage in 1992 was 8.0 percent. Mexican American admissions varied from a low of 10 percent, occurring in \nboth 1983 and 1993, and a high of 14.3 [**82]  percent occurring in 1984. The percentage in 1992 was 10.7. 67 \n \n67    The admissions data from 1983 to 1993 reflects the following minority admissions, both in percentages and \nactual numbers of students: \nYear  Black  Mexican American \n         \n1983  9.3  (47)  10.0  (51) \n1984  6.2  (32)  14.3  (74) \n1985  4.6  (25)  11.2  (61) \n1986  4.4  (24)  13.1  (71) \n1987  3.2  (17)  10.2  (55) \n1988  7.0  (44)  10.7  (60) \n1989  6.0  (35)  11.4  (58) \n1990  7.1  (39)  11.6  (64) \n1991  6.9  (35)  10.6  (54) \n1992  8.0  (41)  10.7  (55) \n1993  5.9  (31)  10.0  (53) \nAn illegal quota, as defined by the Supreme Court, exists when a fixed number of seats are set aside or an unyield-\ning number is set to achieve a goal. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 288, 98 S. Ct. at 2747 (defining quota as fixed number of \nseats set aside); see also Metro Broadcasting,    U.S. at   , 110 S. Ct. at 3027 (equating quota with a \"fixed quantity set \naside\"); Croson, 488 U.S. at 499, 109 S. Ct. at 724-25 [**83]  (describing thirty percent minority set-aside as rigid and \nunyielding quota); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 498, 100 S. Ct. 2758, 2785, 65 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1980) (equating \nquota with setaside). Though it is evident from the admissions figures that the percentages of desired minorities in a \nclass derived from the OCR investigation served as guidelines, the law school did not rigidly and inflexibly apply the \nnumbers. Instead, the percentages fluctuate randomly, albeit within a relatively narrow range, and show no consistent \npattern of increase. In some years, the law school has failed to meet its goals because of the relatively weak strength of \nthe minority applicant pool. Goode, vol. 9 at 13-17. No evidence was presented at trial that the law school granted a set-\naside for any particular group or that competition for any specific seat in the class was closed to some students because \nof race or ethnicity. 68 Accordingly, the Court finds the 1992 admissions process did not use an illegal quota but was, in \nfact, flexible in achieving its goals based on the strength of the minority applicant pool. \n \n68    The law school maintains racially segregated \"wait lists,\" which the plaintiffs contend the law school uses \nto adjust the racial composition of the incoming class to meet its goals. However, the evidence at trial showed \n\n \nthat there is no \"last seat,\" as in Bakke, for which an applicant's race is the deciding factor. See, e.g., Johanson, \nvol. 4 at 43. \n [**84]   [*575]  As for duration, the law school has not stated precisely how long it envisions maintaining its af-\nfirmative action admissions program. However, in the 1990s, as the minority applicant pool improved, the admissions \ncommittee made the decision not to admit greater numbers of minority students but to attempt to close the gap in cre-\ndentials of minority and nonminority students. Wellborn, vol. 24 at 31-35; Goode, vol. 9 at 7, 17-18. Therefore, in 1992, \ndespite a significant increase in the number of minority applicants from the previous years, the law school's minority \nadmissions remained relatively stable. Johanson, vol. 6 at 13-14; P-47; D-438; D-439. \nThe current objective of the law school, as articulated at trial, is to continue to narrow the gap to the point where af-\nfirmative action will not be required to achieve a representative percentage of minorities in the entering classes. 69 The \nevidence reflects that the law school admissions committee regularly reviews and adjusts the remedy to evaluate its ne-\ncessity and efficacy. 70 Certainly, an indefinite program would violate the Equal Protection Clause. However, the law \nschool's use of the program until the OCR has determined [**85]  Texas is in compliance with Title VI and until the gap \nin minority and nonminority credentials has narrowed such that the State will remain in compliance with Title VI with-\nout the need for affirmative action does not offend the Constitution. See Podberesky, 764 F. Supp. at 376. \n \n69    See Goode, vol. 9 at 32 (\"My position on the committee for many years has been, we ought to work and \nstrive to decreasing the gap, little by little if we have to, but one day to the point where, in fact, we won't have \nsuch a gap, where we can truly have a race-blind system of admission. We're not there.\"); see also Wellborn, \nvol. 24 at 35; P-1. \n70    The evidence shows that the qualifications of minority applicants today are roughly equivalent to the quali-\nfications of nonminority applicants 20 years ago. D-433. These figures demonstrate the progress that has oc-\ncurred in the qualifications of minorities applying for law school. Glenn, vol. 23 at 52. \nThe third factor, the relationship of the  [**86]  numerical goals to the relevant population, is easily satisfied under \nthese facts. The law school has not attempted to set goals that reflect the percentage of minorities in the general popula-\ntion or the percentage of minorities attending college. Instead the law school's goals for minority enrollment are gener-\nally in line with the percentages of black and Mexican American college graduates in the State of Texas. These goals \nstem from the OCR investigation and the resulting Texas Plans. Goode, vol. 9 at 12-13; Johanson, vol. 4 at 9-12. They \nare reasonable and logically related to the size of the relevant pool of minority prospects for higher education. \nThe final factor, the impact of the procedure on the rights of innocent third parties, is the most difficult to evaluate. \nBy definition, if one person is given preferential treatment based on race or ethnicity to overcome a heritage of past so-\ncietal wrongs, another person is penalized. However, the person penalized or that person's ancestors may never have \ndiscriminated against the preferred race or ethnicity. Although the past history of societal discrimination in certain insti-\ntutions may justify the remedy, in the end, individuals [**87]  pay the price. Therefore, it is imperative that the mechan-\nics of any program implementing race-based preferences respect and protect the rights of individuals who, ultimately, \nmay have to sacrifice their interests as a remedy for societal wrongs. \nIn 1992, admissions subcommittees of three reviewed all the nonminority files. With the exception of Johanson and \nHamilton, none of the members of the subcommittees reviewed the individual minority files. Nonminority applicants \nreceiving no votes were denied admission without any further consideration or any direct comparison to minority appli-\ncants. In fact, as early as February 28, 1992, the law school had sent denial letters to 201 resident applicants, none of \nwhom were black or Mexican American. P-43. By March 24, 1992, 718 denial letters had been sent to resident appli-\ncants, all to nonminority applicants. P-52. The law school did not reject any minority applicants until later in the admis-\nsions process. P-60. \nThe lack of individual comparison between minority and nonminority files resulted primarily  [*576]  from the \nseparate admissions procedures for minorities and nonminorities in the discretionary zone; this is the aspect of the pro-\ncedure that [**88]  is at issue with respect to the four plaintiffs in this cause, who were evaluated in the discretionary \nzone. However, the setting of different presumptive denial lines for minorities and nonminorities creates a similar prob-\nlem: some nonminority applicants who fell below the nonminority presumptive denial line, though having a higher \nscore than minority applicants placed in the discretionary zone, were rejected early in the process with no comparison to \nthe individual minority applicants. 71 Further, although a presumptive denial score was established for minorities, in \n1992, every minority applicant not admitted from the presumptive admit category was treated as if in the minority dis-\ncretionary zone. P-103. \n\n \n \n71    The use of different presumptive admission lines to identify the top candidates in the different groups does \nnot present the same problem for several reasons. First, the evidence shows that Johanson reviewed all candi-\ndates in the top category, both minority and nonminority. Additionally, those applicants that were not offered \nadmission from this category were not denied admission but moved to the discretionary zone. Further, Johanson \ntestified to the necessity of making offers of admissions to the top candidates in the minority pools as soon as \npossible because of the small pool of qualified applicants and the nationwide competition for them. A tool that \nconsiders the disparity in past educational opportunity based on historical discrimination to assist in attracting \nthe top minorities does not create an undue burden on the rights of nonminorities when appropriately used. Con-\nversely, the use of differing presumptive denial lines effectively removed some nonminority applicants from \nconsideration early in the process without being provided a general, much less individual, comparison with a \nfully developed pool of minority applicants. One or two separate reviewers from the general admissions commit-\ntee unilaterally made determinations with regard to these applicants. However, none of the plaintiffs in this law-\nsuit was affected directly by this aspect of the 1992 procedure. Further, the new admissions Procedure adopted \nby the law school will no longer use presumptive denial lines to preclude comparison of applicants. See infra \nnote 87. The Court, therefore, need not address the issue. If the issue were before the Court, the Court would \nfind this aspect of the procedure suffers from the same infirmity that use of the minority subcommittee created in \nthe discretionary zone-lack of individual comparison between minority and nonminority applicants. \n [**89]  The defendants defend the system used in 1992 as more effective in controlling the use of race for limited, \nlegitimate purposes than the previous procedure of commingling minority and nomninority files in the stacks of thirty, a \nprocedure that allowed individual reviewers complete discretion on the extent, if any, to implement affirmative action. \nWellborn, vol. 24 at 8-17. The defendants assert the 1992 process was also more efficient in that minority files were \nreviewed by the persons most experienced in reviewing and evaluating minority files. Goode, vol. 9 at 3. The defen-\ndants concede that in 1992, with the exception of Johanson and Hamilton, no members of the general admissions com-\nmittee reviewed individual minority files. However, they contend that the full committee was sufficiently apprised of \nthe relative strengths of the minority and nonminority applicant pools through information provided by the minority \nsubcommittee. Because the minority subcommittee shared this information with the full committee, the defendants ar-\ngue that the full committee could reach a consensus on the weight to give race in the admissions process and evaluate \nthe nonminority stacks of files [**90]  with the relative strengths of the applicant pools in mind. Welltorn, vol. 24 at 10, \n14-16; Goode, vol. 9 at 8-9. The defendants also defend the law school's process as consistent with similar processes \nused at major law schools across the country. 72 However, review of admissions  [*577]  procedures for equal protection \nviolations requires a fact-specific inquiry. The fact that other schools may use processes with similar components does \nnot resolve the issue of whether the defendants deprived the four plaintiffs in this cause of equal protection under the \nlaw. \n \n72    The defendants imply that because the law school's affirmative action is fundamentally similar to that used \nat the major law schools around the country, it is constitutional. The evidence, however, reflects that while there \nare similarities, the other programs differ significantly from that at issue in this cause. Judith Wegner, Dean of \nthe University of North Carolina School of Law, testified by deposition that the University of North Carolina \nSchool of Law does not set separate presumptive admission and denial scores based on race, does not have wait-\ning lists segregated by race, and does not have separate committee review based on race. Wegner depo. at 48-49. \nRobert Stein, Dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, testified that the University of Minnesota uses \nmechanisms in the admissions procedure similar in function to those used by the law school. However, all appli-\ncants offered admission at the University of Minnesota, with the exception of those offered \"automatic\" admis-\nsion based on high indices, are ultimately reviewed by the full admissions committee. Stein, vol. 18 at 12. The \nminority subcommittee does not have authority to admit applicants, only to recommend specific applicants to the \nfull committee. Stein, vol. 18 at 48. Paul Brest, Dean of the Stanford Law School, testified his school uses a sys-\ntem comparable to that used by the law school, with a single admissions chair who has ultimate discretion on all \nadmissions. Brest, vol. 22 at 19. Instead of a using a minority subcommittee, Stanford has one person that re-\nviews minority files and makes recommendations to the admissions chair. Id. at 8-19. Until recently, that person \nreviewed only minority files. However, following Boalt Hall's settlement with the OCR, Stanford changed its \nprocedure, and the person now reviews some nonminority files to develop a better sense of the entire pool of ap-\nplicants and to be able to make more appropriate comparisons between the applicants. Id. at 39. \n\n \n [**91]  In Bakke, Justice Powell stated that although race or ethnicity could be a \"plus\" factor in consideration of a \nparticular applicant, race or ethnicity should \"not insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for \nthe available seats.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317, 98 S. Ct. at 2762. Justice Powell further discussed the importance of assur-\ning applicants that they were treated as individuals in the admissions process: \n  \n   The applicant who loses out on the last available seat to another candidate receiving a \"plus\" on the ba-\nsis of ethnic background will not have been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat simply be-\ncause he was not the right color or had the wrong surname. It would mean only that his combined quali-\nfications, which may have included similar nonobjective factors, did not outweigh those of the other ap-\nplicant. His qualifications would have been weighed fairly and competitively, and he would have no ba-\nsis to complain of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n  \n Id. at 318, 98 S. Ct. at 2762. The defendants contend [**92]  this express language is limited in its application to only \nthose affirmative action programs that, like the one at issue in Bakke, use a quota system to achieve diversity. They as-\nsert that Justice Powell's reasoning calling for a one-on-one comparison may have application when the primary objec-\ntive is to obtain a diverse class based on a number of different qualifications. However, this reasoning does not apply, \naccording to the defendants, when a primary objective is to remedy past discrimination. In such circumstances, the de-\nfendants maintain individuals need not be compared one-to-one, as long as the admissions committee had a generalized \nknowledge of the strengths of the minority and nonminority applicant pools. 73 The Court disagrees. \n \n73    Additionally, the defendants assert that nothing in the case law following Bakke suggests that individual \ncomparison of files is required in an admissions process redressing past discrimination, and in fact, indications \nexist to the contrary. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 519, 109 S. Ct. at 735 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (narrow tailoring \nstandards should not be so strict as to chill state's ability to voluntarily eliminate results of past discriminatory \nactions); Sheet Metal Workers' v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 471, 106 S. Ct. 3019, 3047-48, 92 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1986) \n(narrow tailoring does not require specific beneficiaries of affirmative action be victims of past discrimination). \nThe defendants assert that requiring a one-to-one comparison of over 4000 applicants a year would be incredibly \nburdensome. However, the Court finds no reason, when evaluating affirmative action in the educational context, \nthat the protection afforded individuals under the Fourteenth Amendment should change based on the govern-\nmental goal that is to be achieved. Further, the defendants, citing Bakke, have asserted diversity as a constitu-\ntionally valid goal of the law school's affirmative action program. Bakke gives no indication that the burden to a \nschool in implementing a constitutionally valid program should be considered as a reason to diminish the need \nfor individual comparison. Additionally, more recent case law has made it clear that administrative convenience \ncannot support a finding that an affirmative action program is narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of past \ndiscrimination. Croson, 488 U.S. at 508, 109 S. Ct. at 729-730. \n [**93]  Overcoming the effects of past discrimination is an important goal for our society. The preservation and \nprotection of individual rights are equally important. Society must be careful not to ignore the latter to achieve the for-\nmer, for to do so would serve only to perpetuate actions of the type affirmative action attempts to redress. Two wrongs \ndo  [*578]  not make a right; nor does blatant discrimination cure the ills of past discrimination. Indeed, affirmative ac-\ntion that ignores the importance of individual rights may further widen the gap between the races that the law school so \ndiligently attempts to close and create racial hostility. The only proper means of assuring that all important societal in-\nterests are met, whether in the context of creating diversity or redressing the ill effects of past wrongs, is to provide a \nprocedure or method by which the qualifications of each individual are evaluated and compared to those of all other \nindividuals in the pool, whether minority or nonminority. \nThe law school owes a duty to the citizens of Texas to allow access to a legal education to the best qualified appli-\ncants. This does not imply that those applicants with the highest numbers or most [**94]  prestigious pedigrees are nec-\nessarily the best qualified. A multitude of factors, as discussed by Justice Powell in Bakke, should be considered in de-\nveloping the best qualified class from a given group of applicants. 74 \"Indeed, the weight attributed to a particular quality \nmay vary from year to year depending upon the 'mix' both of the student body and the applicants for the incoming \nclass.\" 438 U.S. at 317-18, 98 S. Ct. at 2762. To achieve the compelling governmental goal of remedying past discrimi-\nnation, race and ethnicity are factors that deserve \"pluses\" in the weighing of qualifications. To achieve the compelling \ngovernmental goal of diversity, nonobjective qualifications of nonminorities and minorities alike may deserve a similar \n\n \n\"plus\" factor. 75 Only by comparing the entire pool of individual applicants can both these goals be achieved and the best \nqualified class of entering law students be admitted. \n \n74    In addition to race, Justice Powell suggested \"such qualities could include exceptional personal talents, \nunique work or service experience, leadership potential, maturity, demonstrated compassion, a history of over-\ncoming disadvantage, ability to communicate with the poor, or other qualifications deemed important.\" 438 U.S. \nat 318, 98 S. Ct. at 2762. \n [**95]  \n75    A nonminority applicant from a disadvantaged background, although offered admission to prestigious col-\nleges, who elects to attend less-prestigious schools for economic reasons but nonetheless performs well, seems \nto be penalized under the current system for not having financial means or opportunities commensurate with \nother nonminorities dealt a different lot in life. Therefore, the affirmative action program, as applied in 1992, \nseems to have had the somewhat ironic effect of affecting the rights of less advantaged and, indeed, even disad-\nvantaged, nonminorities rather than the group of nonminorities as a whole. \nThe law school's 1992 admissions procedure, in theory, was designed to select the best qualified applicants from \nthe thousands of applications it received. In 1992, the law school's affirmative action program involved a determination \nof those applicants who were the best qualified from the entire minority pool and an attempt to enroll sufficient numbers \nof those applicants in the entering class to satisfy the compelling governmental objectives at issue. The law school \nevaluated all [**96]  nonminority applications through a separate process, with the goal of admitting the best qualified \nnonminorities. The defendants maintain this bifurcated process does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because \naffirmative action is lawful and those minorities selected are evaluated against nonminority applicants by comparison of \nthe general qualifications of the two pools of applicants. The process, however, incorporates no meaningful evaluation \nbetween the applicants selected from each pool-a crucial element for protection of individual rights. \nThe Court holds that the aspect of the law school's affirmative action program giving minority applicants a \"plus\" is \nlawful. But the failure to provide comparative evaluation among all individual applicants in determining which were the \nbest qualified to comprise the class, including appropriate consideration of a \"plus\" factor, created a procedure in which \nadmission of the best qualified was not assured in 1992. Under the 1992 procedure, the possibility existed that the law \nschool could select a minority, who, even with a \"plus\" factor, was not as qualified to be a part of the entering class as a \nnonminority denied admission. Thus,  [**97]  the admission of the nonminority candidate would be solely on the basis \nof race or ethnicity and not based on individual comparison and evaluation.  [*579]  This is the aspect of the procedure \nthat is flawed and must be eliminated. \nThe constitutional infirmity of the 1992 law school admissions procedure, therefore, is not that it gives preferential \ntreatment on the basis of race but that it fails to afford each individual applicant a comparison with the entire pool of \napplicants, not just those of the applicant's own race. 76 Because the law school's 1992 admissions process was not nar-\nrowly tailored, the Court finds the procedure violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \n76    The record shows that two of the plaintiffs' applications were reviewed by members of the minority sub-\ncommittee who had familiarity with both pools of applicants, minority and nonminority. Initially, Johanson re-\nviewed Hopwood's file early in the process before the entire pool of applications had developed. After he moved \nher to the discretionary zone, a subcommittee of three that included Hamilton reviewed her file. Elliott's file was \nreviewed by a subcommittee of three that included Johanson. Arguably, because Johanson and Hamilton had \nfamiliarity with individual minority applicant files, the procedure as applied to these two plaintiffs was not im-\npermissible. However, because the other reviewers on the subcommittees had no familiarity with individual mi-\nnority files, the Court finds the constitutional violation applies to all four plaintiffs. Additionally, the fact that \nthese plaintiffs were reviewed by persons familiar with the entire pool was an inadvertent effect of Johanson's \nand Hamilton's dual roles and the random shuffle of the files into reviewing stacks; it did not result from the de-\nsign of the procedure. \n \n [**98] C. Effect of Process on Plaintiffs  \nThe next issue the Court must address is whether, but for the manner in which the law school improperly consid-\nered race in its 1992 admissions procedure, the plaintiffs would have been offered admission. The defendants argue that \nthe burden is on the plaintiffs to prove they would have been admitted. The plaintiffs argue that once they prove a con-\n\n \nstitutional violation, the burden shifts to the defendants to establish there was no but-for causation between the unconsti-\ntutional procedure and the denial of admission to each plaintiff. \nGenerally, in cases where a plaintiff establishes a constitutional deprivation, the burden shifts to the defendant to \nestablish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action. See, e.g., Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 263, 98 S. Ct. \n1042, 1052, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1978) (plaintiff seeking damages for due-process violation must show injuries resulted \nfrom denial of due process, not from corresponding justifiable deprivation); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 \nU.S. 274, 287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 576, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977) [**99]  (once employee established conduct constitutionally \nprotected, burden shifted to employer to show it would have reached same decision). Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke \nsuggests the same holds true in Title VI discrimination suits when evidence of alternative reasons exists. 77 The Supreme \nCourt has recently taken the analysis one step further in the context of Title VII discrimination cases and held that the \nfailure of a defendant to produce credible evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons is insufficient to support a \nfinding of discrimination  [*580]  because the \"ultimate burden of persuasion\" remains at all times with the plaintiff. See \nSt. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 125 L. Ed. 2d 407,    U.S.   ,    , 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2749 (1993). In making this clarifica-\ntion, Justice Scalia stated that a court has no authority to impose liability upon an entity for alleged discriminatory prac-\ntices unless a factfinder determines, according to proper procedures, that the entity has unlawfully discriminated. Id. at    \n, 113 S. Ct. 2751. Courts have borrowed the burden of proof standards formulated for Title VII [**100]  in deciding \nclaims brought under statutes prohibiting discrimination by educational institutions receiving federal funding. See, e.g., \nElston v. Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1404 (11th Cir. 1993) (Title VI disparate impact claim). But \nsee Cohen v. Brown Univ., 991 F.2d 888, 901-02 (1st Cir. 1993) (Title IX plaintiff bears burden of showing disparity \nand unmet interest). 78 \n \n77    The trial court in Eakke placed the burden of proof on Bakke. Therefore, although the court found the \nDavis program violated Bakke's fourteenth amendment rights, it denied him injunctive relief because he had \nfailed to prove he would have been admitted in the absence of the impermissible program. On appeal, the Su-\npreme Court of California, analogizing Bakke's situation to that of a plaintiff under Title VII, ruled that because \nBakke established the university had discriminated against him, the burden of proof shifted to the university to \nprove that it would not have admitted him in the absence of the special admissions program. Bakke v. Regents of \nUniv. of Cal., 18 Cal. 3d 34, 553 P.2d 1152, 1172, 132 Cal. Rptr. 680 (Cal. 1976). Because the university con-\nceded its inability to carry the burden, the California court ordered Bakke's admission. Id. On review, the Su-\npreme Court of the United States noted the burden shift but stated that because the university had not challenged \nthat aspect of the decision, the issue of the proper placement of the burden of proof was not before it for consid-\neration. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 280 n.13, 98 S. Ct. at 2743 n.13. At the end of his opinion, Justice Powell, affirming \nthe injunction, noted that remanding the case would serve no useful purpose in light of the university's conces-\nsion that it could not meet the burden imposed upon it by the burden shift.  Id. at 320, 98 S. Ct. at 2764. In dis-\ntinguishing Bakke from Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, Justice Powell noted that there was no \nquestion that race had been the reason for Bakke's rejection and no record existed in Bakke that legitimate alter-\nnative grounds for the university's decision existed. Id. at 320 n.54; 98 S. Ct. at 2764 n.54. \n [**101]  \n78    The court in Cohen held that the burden shift applicable to Title VII cases should not apply to Title IX \ncases, a statute similar to Title VI. Among the reasons the court offered were the different scope and purpose of \nthe two statutes and the largely aspirational goal of Title IX in comparison to the peremptory goal of Title VII. \n991 F.2d at 902. \nThe Court finds that the cue in Justice Powell's Opinion and the holdings of other constitutional cases suggest that a \nburden allotment similar to that in Title VII cases is appropriate. Therefore, because the plaintiffs established a prima \nfacie case-they proved the law school's 1992 admissions procedure was constitutionally flawed-the burden shifted to the \ndefendants to establish legitimate grounds for the decision not to admit these plaintiffs, notwithstanding the procedure \nfollowed. Unlike the university in Bakke, the defendants in this cause did not concede the plaintiffs would have been \nadmitted had their applications been compared on a individual basis to minority files. Instead, they offered legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory [**102]  reasons for denying each of the plaintiff's applications. D-332 (Hopwood, Elliott); D-334 \n(Hopwood, Carvell); D-335 (Carvell, Rogers); D-336 (Carvell). Further, a statistical analysis of the 1992 admissions \ndata supports the defendants' assertion of the non-race based weaknesses in the plaintiffs' applications. D-338 at A-60 - \nA-71. \nThe plaintiffs placed in evidence a chart created by the law school that depicts the TIs of all 1992 applicants and \nwhether they were offered or denied admission. See P-139. The chart distinguishes minority and nonminority appli-\n\n \ncants, as well as residents and nonresidents. 79 The chart emphasizes the disparity in TIs between resident minority and \nnonminority applicants: the highest nonminority TI was 220, the highest black TI was 199 (the same as Hopwood's TI), \nand the highest Mexican American TI was 208. In the resident nonminority category, of fifty-one applicants with TIs of \n199, six were denied admission. Additionally, the law school denied admission to ten nonminorities with TIs higher \nthan Hopwood's TI. With regard to minority applicants with TIs of 199, the chart shows one black applicant, who was \nadmitted, and three Mexican American applicants,  [**103]  all who were admitted. 80 With regard to a TI of 197, the TI \nshared by the other three plaintiffs, of fifty-seven resident nonminority applicants, the law school denied admission to \nnineteen. Only one black resident fell in this category, who was admitted. No Mexican-American applicants had a TI of \n197. \n \n79    The Court has focused on the statistics for residents in this discussion. The Court notes the chart reflects \nacross-the-board higher numbers for nonresidents and correspondingly more difficult thresholds for admittance. \nOn the chart, \"D\" indicates denied, \"A\" indicates admitted, and \"C\" indicates cancelled. For purposes of \nevaluation of the numbers, applicants in the \"C\" category are counted as admissions because they were admitted \nbut cancelled the acceptance. See Johanson, vol. 6 at 16. \n80    Two of the Mexican American applicants cancelled. \nOn the other end of the scale, out of four black resident applicants with a TI of 185, one was denied admission. \nHowever, the law school offered admission to one [**104]  nonminority resident with the same TI. Applicants with the \nlowest TI offered admission were all minorities. 81 However, the lowest nonminority  [*581]  TI was only a couple of \npoints higher at 185. \n \n81    Of five black applicants with a TI of 183, the law school admitted three; of eleven Mexican American ap-\nplicants, the law school admitted two (one canceled). \nThere are many possible methods of evaluating the numbers on the chart and making comparisons of the applicants' \nrelative TIs. The plaintiffs placed the chart in evidence to show their numerical standing above that of the majority of \nminorities offered admission. The Court agrees with the plaintiffs that the chart shows a significant disparity in TIs be-\ntween the minority and nonminority pools. But the visual depiction of this disparity further reinforces the Court's find-\ning that the evaluation of applicants must include other nonobjective factors to achieve the compelling governmental \ninterest of overcoming the past effects of discrimination. \nWhat the chart does not prove,  [**105]  however, is that race or ethnic origin was the reason behind the denial of \nadmission to the plaintiffs. Although the plaintiffs had higher TIs than the majority of minority applicants offered ad-\nmission, the evidence shows that 109 nonminority residents with TIs lower than Hopwood's were offered admission. 82 \nSixty-seven nonminority residents with TIs lower than the other three plaintiffs were admitted. 83 \n \n82    Twenty-nine of these applicants canceled. \n83    Thirteen of these applicants canceled. \nAdditionally, the Court has reviewed the files of the four plaintiffs as well as the files placed in evidence of other \napplicants reviewed in the discretionary zone, both minority and nonminority. P-146 to P-150, P-155 to P-164 (white \napplicants admitted); P-224 to P-237 (black and Mexican American applicants admitted). Based on the applications in \nevidence, it appears the majority of applicants, both minority and nonminority, made considerable effort to inform the \nadmissions committee of their special qualifications  [**106]  through extensive answers to the questions on the appli-\ncation form or through personal statements. See P-146 to P-150, P-155 to P-163, P-225 to P-237. Most files contained \none, if not several, letters of recommendation. See, e.g., P-155, 157, 158, 161, 225, 231, 233-236. In fact, of all the ap-\nplications the Court reviewed, Hopwood's provides the least information about her background and individual qualifica-\ntions and is the least impressive in appearance, despite her relatively high numbers. The files further reveal that both \nminorities and nonminorities were offered admission from the waiting lists. See P-146, 148, 156, 158, 162 (nonminor-\nity); P-231, 285 (minority). \nIn reviewing these files, the Court appreciates the difficulty of the task facing the admissions committee each year. \nEvaluation of applications involves both objective and subjective factors, and the Court is aware that some evaluators \ncould use subjectivity to conceal discriminatory motives. As a general rule, however, judges are not as well suited to \nevaluate qualifications of applicants as those who are familiar with the process and have many years of experience \nevaluating applications. See Odom v. Frank, 3 F.3d 839, 847 (5th Cir. 1993). [**107]  The Court's review revealed a \n\n \ngroup of applicants with varying backgrounds and accomplishments, but none so clearly better qualified, in the Court's \nview, as to require that individual's selection over that of another in the group. 84 The Court sees no disparities in the \napplications of the admitted minorities when compared to those of the plaintiffs \"so apparent as virtually to jump off the \npage and slap [the Court] in the face.\" Id. Without such a disparity, the Court cannot and will not substitute its views for \nthose of admission committee members with years of experience and expertise in evaluating the law school applica-\ntions. See id. \n \n84    The Court notes that several of the applicants, some of which, in the Court's opinion, were weaker candi-\ndates, initially were denied admission but offered a position on the waiting list. They were offered admission \nrelatively late in the process from the waiting list. \nTherefore, the Court finds the defendants have met the burden of producing credible evidence that legitimate,  \n[**108]  nondiscriminatory grounds exist for the law school's denial of admission to each of the four plaintiffs and that, \nin all likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have been offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible process. \nThe plaintiffs, who maintain the ultimate burden  [*582]  of persuasion, have failed to prove otherwise. 85 The Court \nsimply cannot find from a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiffs would have been offered admission under a \nconstitutional system. \n \n85    In this cause, the plaintiffs' initial position was that any consideration of race in an admissions procedure is \nimproper. Upon the Court's indication that such a position was untenable under the law, the plaintiffs redirected \ntheir efforts to proving the law school improperly used race in the admissions process. However, the plaintiffs' \ncausation evidence consisted of a demonstration that many more minority students were admitted in 1992 than \nwould have been under a strictly race-blind process and that, had the plaintiffs been minorities, there was a high \nprobability they would have been offered admission. Johanson, vol. 5 at 37; vol. 6 at 18-19. This evidence, al-\nthough proof of affirmative action, does not establish that the plaintiffs, who are not minorities, would have re-\nceived sufficient votes to be offered admission if individual minority files had been reviewed by the general ad-\nmissions committee. \n [**109]  The Court is mindful that the ultimate burden on the plaintiffs is a difficult and, perhaps, almost impossi-\nble obstacle to overcome in a case of this nature. 86 However, the Court may not ignore the precedent of other constitu-\ntional cases because, as a practical matter, the burden may be too difficult for plaintiffs to overcome. \n \n86    In closing argument, the plaintiffs' counsel stated the plaintiffs could not prove they were denied admission \nbecause of their race because it was an impossible burden to meet. T. Smith, vol. 26 at 11, 40. Justice Souter, in \nexpressing concern for Title VII plaintiffs with similar burdens, criticized the holding in St. Mary's as establish-\ning a scheme, which, as a practical matter, could never be met by a plaintiff without direct evidence of discrimi-\nnation. St. Mary's, 113 S. Ct. at 2761 (Souter, J., dissenting). \nThe Court agrees that the plaintiffs have an impossible burden absent direct evidence. However, the diffi-\nculty does not stem from the unconstitutional aspects of the procedure alone but from the random shuffle of files \ninto stacks of thirty, with each stack reviewed by different subcommittees of three. Under such a system, it is \nvirtually impossible to establish the outcome of a comparison of the plaintiffs' applications against the other ap-\nplicants, whether minority or nonminority. \n \n [**110] E. Relief and Damages  \nThe plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and exemplary damages. Because the \nCourt has found the admission procedure the law school used in 1992 was not narrowly tailored in that it impermissibly \nand unnecessarily harmed the rights of the plaintiffs, the Court will enter a judgment providing the plaintiffs with their \nrequested declaratory relief. Specifically, the Court will enter judgment that the law school's use of the separate evalua-\ntive processes for minority and nonminority applicants in the discretionary zone violated the Fourteenth Amendment. \nHowever, \"the right to equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution is not coextensive with any substantive rights \nto the benefits denied the party discriminated against.\" Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739, 104 S. Ct. 1387, 1395, \n79 L. Ed. 2d 646 (1984). As discussed above, the Court cannot find from a preponderance of the evidence that the plain-\ntiffs would have been admitted under a constitutional system. The Court, therefore, will not order injunctive relief. Nor \ndoes the Court find prospective injunctive [**111]  relief necessary in light of the law school's voluntary change to a \nprocedure, which on paper and from the testimony, appears to remedy the defects the Court has found in the 1992 pro-\n\n \ncedure. 87 Further, neither a plaintiff denied admission under the new system nor evidence of the practical application of \nthe new procedure is before this Court. \n \n87    The law school followed the admissions procedure used in 1992 in 1993 and 1994. However, for selecting \nthe 1995 entering class, the law school has established a new procedure that eliminates the minority subcommit-\ntee. D-363. All admissions decisions will be made by a small \"administrative admissions group,\" which will be \ncomprised of Johanson, Hamilton's successor, Dean Tonya Brown, and a faculty member who, as of the trial \ndate, had not been selected. The new procedure will not use presumptive admission and denial scores. Johanson, \nvol. 6 at 34. The law school changed its procedure because \"when one gets sued in federal court it catches one's \nattention.\" Id. at 57. \n [**112]  Although the plaintiffs have failed to prove an injury-infact, they have proved they were deprived of their \nright to equal treatment. The appropriate relief for a denial of equal treatment in a discriminatory government  [*583]  \nprogram is a remedy mandating equal treatment. 88 Therefore, the Court finds it appropriate to allow the plaintiffs to \nreapply to the law school for admission in the 1995 entering class, if they so desire, without requiring them to incur fur-\nther administrative costs, and for them to be fairly evaluated in comparison to all other applicants for admission in 1995. \n89 \n \n88    See Heckler, 465 U.S. at 740, 104 S. Ct. at 1395. This remedy may be accommodated by an end to prefer-\nential treatment of others. Id. at n.8. In the context of affirmative action, the Court interprets this to mean an end \nto unlawful preferential treatment of others. \n89    Because plaintiff Carvell has taken advantage of the opportunity to obtain a legal education at SMU, this \naspect of the remedy may have little value to him. Carvell, in all probability, will be a practicing member of the \nbar long before the other plaintiffs, if offered admission to the law school under a constitutional admissions pro-\ncedure, obtain law degrees. \n [**113]  In addition, though the plaintiffs did not prove they suffered any other actual injury, the Court will not ig-\nnore the gravity of the noneconomic injury to persons denied equal treatment. Therefore, although normally assessed in \nthe context of procedural due-process violations, the Court believes this to be an appropriate case for the assessment of \nnominal damages: \n  \n   By making the deprivation of such rights actionable for nominal damages without proof of actual in-\njury, the law recognizes the importance to organized society that those rights be scrupulously observed; \nbut at the same time, it remains true to the principle that substantial damages should be awarded only to \ncompensate actual injury or, in the case of exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish malicious \ndeprivations of rights. \n \n  \n Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. at 266, 98 S. Ct. at 1054. The Court, therefore, will award each plaintiff nominal damages of \none dollar. \nWith regard to general monetary damages, the evidence at trial consisted of each plaintiff's testimony and specula-\ntion about the value of a law degree. 90 Because the plaintiffs have failed to [**114]  establish that they would have been \nadmitted under a constitutional system, they are not entitled to these damages. Further, had the plaintiffs been entitled to \ndamages, none of them established monetary damages as required under the law and rules of this circuit. See Haley v. \nPan American World Airways, 746 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1984) (\"A damage award cannot stand when the only evi-\ndence to support it is speculative or purely conjectural.\"). Finally, the Court would not award Title VI damages even \nwere such damages appropriate because the Court does not believe the defendants intended to discriminate against the \nplaintiffs in an unlawful manner. See Carter v. Orleans Parish Pub. Schs., 725 F.2d 261, 264 (5th Cir. 1984) (recovery \nof damages under Title VI precluded unless action intentional or manifested discriminatory animus); Marvin H. v. Aus-\ntin Indep. Sch. Dist., 714 F.2d 1348, 1356-57 (5th Cir. 1983) (same). Indeed, the evidence reflects the contrary. The \ndefendants acted in good faith and made sincere efforts to follow federal guidelines and to redress past discrimination. \nThe record [**115]  contains no evidence that the defendants intended to discriminate against or to harm the plaintiffs. \nUnder these facts, an award of damages, especially the punitive damages the plaintiffs request, would be inappropriate. \n \n90    Elliott testified he thought the median income for recent law school graduates was $ 57,000 per year. \nElliott, vol. 7 at 30. Rogers had a somewhat less inflated concept, testifying the average first-year salary for a \n\n \ngraduate from the law school was $ 52,000. Rogers also testified that the defendants had \"taken the top off my \ncareer and requested some amount he could not quantify to compensate him for the loss. Rogers, vol. 11 at 67. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nIt is regrettable that affirmative action programs are still needed in our society. However, until society sufficiently \novercomes the effects of its lengthy history of pervasive racism, affirmative action is a necessity. Further, although no \none likes employing racial classifications and distinctions, \"it would be impossible to arrange an [**116]  affirmative \naction program in a racially neutral way and have it successful.\" Bakke, 438 U.S. at 407, 98 S. Ct. at 2808 (Blackmun, \nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \n [*584]  Commitment to affirmative action programs in educational institutions as just and necessary, however, \ndoes not imply that the individual rights of nonminorities should fall by the wayside or be ignored. The concern for in-\ndividual rights requires that programs implementing racial and ethnic preferences be subjected to the most searching \njudicial examination of strict scrutiny. Only by applying strict scrutiny can the judicial branch assure society that the \nimportant individual rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment have not been unnecessarily and unfairly burdened \nsolely as a function of the color of an individual's skin. The judicial branch must carefully and honestly assess the harm \nto those individual rights in light of the compelling interests served and benefit bestowed upon society by the affirma-\ntive action program. To do otherwise would do little more than, in the words of Justice Kennedy, move us from \"sepa-\nrate but equal\" to \"unequal but benign.\" Metro Broadcasting, [**117]     U.S. at   , 110 S. Ct. at 3047 (Kennedy, J., dis-\nsenting). \nFurther, if we wish to progress to a society in which affirmative action is no longer necessary, we must be cogni-\nzant of pitfalls and dangers created by affirmative action in the form of the stigma some associate with racial prefer-\nences and the potential institutionalization of a process that was designed to overcome institutionalized discrimination. \nThe interests of all require that the government not diminish the importance of individual rights, whether belonging to a \nminority citizen or a nonminority citizen, through programs, that although well-intentioned, unwittingly \"permit the \nseeds of race hate to be planted under sanction of law.\" Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 560, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 1147, 41 \nL. Ed. 256 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting). \nThe Court realizes that some individuals will continue to complain that any admissions program employing prefer-\nences based on race, no matter how carefully designed and administered to provide individualized consideration, de-\nprives nonminorities of their rights. However, when the program functions to overcome the [**118]  effects of years of \ndiscrimination and to serve important societal goals, affirmative action \"is consistent with equal protection principles as \nlong as it does not impose undue burdens on nonminorities.\" Metro Broadcasting,    U.S. at   , 110 S. Ct. at 3026. The \nCourt believes the only way of assuring an undue burden is not placed on innocent parties in an admissions procedure is \nto treat all applicants as individuals and to consider all qualifications in selecting the best qualified candidates to com-\nprise an entering class. Using the color of an applicant's skin to limit the degree of individual comparison between the \nraces neither serves societal goals nor sufficiently protects individual rights under our Constitution. 91 \n \n91    \"The hand that rounded Peter's dome,/ And groined the aisles of Christian Rome,/ Wrought in a sad sincer-\nity./ He builded better than he knew !\" \nThose who devised the Fourteenth Amendment wrought in grave sincerity. They may have builded better \nthan they knew. \nThey vitalized and energized a principle, as old and as everlasting as human rights. To some of them, the \nsunset of life may have given mystical lore. \nThey builded, not for a day, but for all time; not for a few, or for a race; but for man. They planted in the \nConstitution a monumental truth . . . the golden rule. \nRoscoe Conkling, Oral Argument in County of San Mateo v. Southern Pacific R.R., 116 U.S. 138, 6 S. Ct. \n317, 29 L. Ed. 589 (1885), in Oral Argument on Behalf of Defendant by Roscoe Conkling 34 (1883). \n [**119]  Judgment will be issued consistent with the Court's findings in this opinion. \nSIGNED the 19th day of August 1994. \nSAM SPARKS \n\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n \nFINAL JUDGMENT  \nBE IT REMEMBERED on the 19th day of August 1994, the Court entered its memorandum opinion consisting of \nits findings of fact and conclusions of law in the above-captioned matter and, consistent with those findings and conclu-\nsions, enters the following judgment: \n  \n   IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED, by declaratory judgment, that the 1992 admissions \nprocedure of the law school at the University of Texas at Austin, as administered, was in violation of the  \n[*585]  14th Amendment of the United States Constitution; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that Cheryl J.

The court having been polled at the request of one of the members of the court, and a ma-\njority of the judges in regular active service not having voted in favor (see FED. R. APP. P. 35 and 5TH CIR. R. 35), the \nsuggestion for rehearing en banc is DENIED. \nIn No. 94-50664, the court having been polled, at the request of one of the members of the court, on the reconsid-\neration of this cause en banc, and a majority of the judges in regular active service not having voted in favor, rehearing \nen banc is DENIED.  \n [**2]  A dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc is forthcoming and is to be published. \nENTERED FOR THE COURT: \n/s/ Jerry E. Smith \nUnited States Circuit Judge  \n \nDISSENT BY: POLITZ; Stewart \n \nDISSENT \nPOLITZ, Chief Judge, and KING, WIENER, BENAVIDES, STEWART, PARKER, and DENNIS, Circuit Judges, \ndissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc  \n  \n   Soon after the founding of the Republic, the Supreme Court indicated that the power of judicial review \nshould be exercised reluctantly, only because it is essential to the decision of the case before a federal \ncourt and because the Constitution and the laws of the United States, as the \"Supreme law of the Land,\" \nrequire it. 1 \n \n  \n \n \n1   Baker v. Wade, 769 F.2d 289, 298 (5th Cir. 1985) (Goldberg, J., dissenting) (citing Marbury v. Madison, 5 \nU.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat) 304, 4 L. Ed. 97 (1816)). \nThis case was brought by four individual plaintiffs (not a class of plaintiffs)  [**3]  who were denied admission to \nthe University of Texas Law School (LawSchool) in 1992, claiming that the Law School's admission process in 1992 \nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment by giving race-based preferences exclusively to  [*722]  blacks and Mexican \nAmericans. 2 In resolving the case presented by these four plaintiffs, the panel opinion directed the Law School not to \nuse race as a factor in the admissions process at all. 3 In so doing, the opinion goes out of its way to break ground that \nthe Supreme Court itself has been careful to avoid and purports to overrule a Supreme Court decision, namely, Regents \nof the University of California v. Bakke. 4 The radical implications of this opinion, with its sweeping dicta, will literally \nchange the face of public educational institutions throughout Texas, the other states of this circuit, and this nation. A \n \n\n \ncase of such monumental import demands the attention of more than a divided panel. It should have the attention of \nevery active judge on this court. We respectfully but emphatically dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc. \n \n2   The Law School no longer employs the system that was in place for 1992. \n [**4]  \n3   Judge Smith wrote the opinion for the panel, and Judge DeMoss joined that opinion in full. Judge Wiener, \nwho wrote separately, did not join the panel opinion in this conclusion. \n4   438 U.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978). \nFor reasons that have not been communicated to this court, and upon which we can only speculate, neither the \nplaintiffs nor the defendants have sought rehearing en banc. It would appear that in this case, some of our colleagues \nmay have embraced the rationale that, when sophisticated litigants represented by capable lawyers elect not to seek re-\nhearing en banc, it is not our place to take any action. Our customary practice, however, does not support this position. \nIndeed, not infrequently we propose rehearing en banc on our own motion, before the parties have requested that we do \nso. We reject out of hand the notion that we are merely obsequious ciphers, subject to the tactical decisions and strategic \nmaneuvers of the litigants before us. When the occasional case of such far-reaching importance to this court, to public \nhigher education, and to this nation [**5]  comes down the pike, we have a duty to address it and to do the best possible \njob that our whole court is capable of, regardless of the tactical decisions of the litigants. To decline to rehear a case of \nthis magnitude because the parties have not suggested that we do so bespeaks an abdication of duty--the ducking of a \ntough question by judges who we know first-hand are made of sterner stuff. \nThe label \"judicial activism\" is usually found in the lexicon of those voicing concern about judges whom they per-\nceive to be \"liberal,\" fashioning remedies beyond the scope of what is deemed to be appropriate under the law. Such \njudicial legislating is generally excoriated as a \"bad thing.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas 5 is a text book example of judi-\ncial activism. Here, two members of the three-judge panel determined to bar any consideration of race in the Law \nSchool's admission process. This \"injunction\" is wholly unnecessary to the disposition of the matter appealed and thus is \nclearly dictum; yet dictum that is a frontal assault on contrary Supreme Court precedent and thus not the kind of dictum \nwe can ignore. By tenuously stringing together pieces and shards of recent Supreme Court [**6]  opinions that have \ndealt with race in such diverse settings as minority set asides for government contractors, broadcast licenses, redistrict-\ning, and the like, the panel creates a gossamer chain which it proffers as a justification for overruling Bakke. We are \npersuaded that this alone makes the instant case not just en banc-worthy but en banc mandatory. \n \n5   84 F.3d 720 (1996 WL 120235) (5th Cir. 1996). \nThe Supreme Court has left no doubt that as a constitutionally inferior court, we are compelled to follow faithfully \na directly controlling Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it. 6 We \nmay not reject, dismiss, disregard, or deny Supreme Court precedent, even if, in a particular case, it seems pellucidly \nclear to litigants, lawyers, and lower court judges alike that, given the opportunity, the Supreme Court would overrule \nits precedent. \n \n6   See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d \n526 (1989). \n [**7]  Members of this court have frequently \"preached\" against such judicial activism. In  [*723]  Williams v. \nWhitley, 7 Judge Higginbotham explained the limits placed on appellate courts regarding Supreme Court precedent: \n  \n   Absent clear indications from the Supreme Court itself, lower courts should not lightly assume that a \nprior decision has been overruled sub silentio merely because its reasoning and result appear inconsistent \nwith later cases. As [the district court] pointed out . . . the Court issued a reminder to this effect only a \nfew years ago in Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 109 S. Ct. \n1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989): \"If a precedent of [the Supreme] Court has direct application in a case, \nyet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should fol-\nlow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its \nown decisions.\" Id. at 484-85, 109 S. Ct. at 1921-22; see also id. at 486, 109 S. Ct. at 1923 (Brennan, J., \ndissenting) (describing anticipatory overruling as \"an indefensible brand of judicial activism\") . . . In \nthese circumstances,  [**8]  our role as an inferior court counsels restraint, even if the result otherwise \nappears inescapable. \n \n\n \n \n  \nIn like manner, our colleagues have routinely counseled that judicial restraint is the order of the day, especially in the \nconstitutional context. For example, in Walton v. Alexander, 8 Judge Garwood insisted that courts have a duty not to \naddress constitutional issues not necessary to the disposition of an individual case. \n   It is settled that courts have a \"strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in \norder to determine the rights of the parties to the case under consideration.\" County Court of Ulster \nCounty v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 154, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 2223, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979). This \"responsibility to \navoid unnecessary constitutional adjudication\" is \"a fundamental rule of judicial restraint.\" Three Affili-\nated Tribes v. Wold Engineering, 467 U.S. 138, 157, 104 S. Ct. 2267, 2279, 81 L. Ed. 2d 113 (1984). All \nthis, of course, applies not only to the Supreme Court but to lower courts as well. See Bowen v. United \nStates, 422 U.S. 916, 920, 95 S. Ct. 2569, 2573, 45 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1975). \n \n  \nVariations of this theme can [**9]  be found in the opinions of many of the judges of this court. 9 \n \n7   994 F.2d 226, 235 (5th Cir. 1993). \n8   20 F.3d 1350, 1356 (5th Cir. 1994). We cannot but note that a majority of our active judges voted Walton en \nbanc to correct the majority's erroneous interpretation of Supreme Court precedent regarding an issue that was \nnot necessary for the resolution of the case. \n9   See also United States v. Mendiola, 42 F.3d 259, 260 n.1 (5th Cir. 1994) (Barksdale, J.) (\"It goes without \nsaying that we have a strong duty to avoid constitutional issues that need not be resolved in order to determine \nthe rights of the parties to the case under consideration.\"); Manning v. Upjohn Co., 862 F.2d 545, 547 (5th Cir. \n1989) (Smith, J.) (\"Principles of judicial restraint dictate that if resolution of an issue effectively dispose of a \ncase, we should resolve the case on that basis without reaching any other issues that might be presented.\"); \nApache Bend Apartments, Ltd. v. United States, 987 F.2d 1174, 1175 (5th Cir. 1993) (Jolly, J.) (\"The judicial \npower to adjudicate constitutional questions is reserved for those instances in which it is necessary for the vindi-\ncation of individual rights.\") (emphasis added); Doe v. Taylor Indep. Sch. Dist., 15 F.3d 443 (5th Cir. 1994) \n(Jones, J., dissenting, joined by Garwood, Smith, Barksdale, and DeMoss, JJ.) (\"'The doctrine of judicial self-\nrestraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in [the constitu-\ntional] field.'\") (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 1068, 117 L. Ed. \n2d 261 (1992)). \n [**10]  Thus, it seems that this court has trouble practicing what it preaches, at least in this instance. For here, Jus-\ntice Powell's opinion in Bakke made the Supreme Court's disposition precedential. 10 We unequivocally reject the propo-\nsition that it does not mandate our disposition. The syllogisms tacked together  [*724]  and proffered by the majority \nopinion as proof that Justice Powell's diversity conclusion is no longer good law do not, under any standards of which \nwe are aware, qualify as an overruling of Bakke. 11 To the contrary, direct reference to Justice Powell's diversity analysis \ndocuments, supports, and reinforces its continuing validity. 12 Consequently, even if the members of the panel majority \nwere convinced that the Supreme Court is certain to overrule Bakke, in the absence of an express overruling, they had \nno option but to grin, follow Bakke, bear it, and patiently await the Supreme Court's reconsideration. Rather than fol-\nlowing this universally recognized canon, adhering to our established rules, and applying Supreme Court precedent, the \npanel charted a path into terra incognita. Judicial self-restraint was the first casualty; it proved to be too burdensome.  \n[**11]  The teachings proscribing the consideration of constitutional issues unnecessary to the decision soon followed. \nWith these two limitations adroitly set aside, the panel majority apparently considered itself positioned to overrule \nBakke. \n \n10   In a part V.C. of his opinion, Justice Powell writes, \n  \n   In enjoining [the University of California at Davis] from ever considering the race of any appli-\ncant, however, the courts below failed to recognize that the State has a substantial interest that le-\ngitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive \nconsideration of race and ethnic origin. \n \n  \n \n\n \n Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318. Justices Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun joined Justice Powell in this holding.  \nId. at 271 n.*. \n11   Lest there be any doubt, we are firmly convinced that, until the Supreme Court expressly overrules Bakke, \nstudent body diversity is a compelling governmental interest for the purposes of strict scrutiny. \n12   See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. Of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986) (O'Con-\nnor, J., concurring) (recognizing racial diversity as sufficiently compelling in the context of higher education). \n [**12]  Giving the panel majority the benefit of the doubt, as we are wont to do and should do, and assuming ar-\nguendo that Bakke's diversity issue had to be addressed in this particular case, would it not have been the more judi-\ncious course to have brought our full en banc powers to bear on this difficult, vitally important question? It can hardly \nbe gainsaid that reasonable jurists can and likely will differ on an issue of such magnitude, depth, and importance. In-\ndeed, this very truism compels giving to the entire court the opportunity to devote to this crucial case its focused consid-\neration. Conceivably, after an en banc rehearing the panel result, its reasoning, and even its dicta, might be embraced by \na majority of the en banc court. But that is not the point; even if that unprecedented and, we suggest, impertinent step--a \nfederal circuit court, sitting en banc, purporting to overrule a Supreme Court precedent--were to be taken, it would not \nbe taken until sixteen of the seventeen active judges of this court 13 had an opportunity to consider and participate in the \ndeliberations on this matter fully. \n \n13   Judge Emilio M. Garza, our seventeenth active judge, recused himself from the outset. \n [**13]  There are many things which a \"yea\" vote on an en banc poll is not: It is not necessarily a vote against the \nanalysis; it is not necessarily a vote against the result; it is not necessarily a vote against a panel opinion or in favor of a \nspecial concurrence or a dissent. It is rather an affirmative statement that, for one or more reasons, a case or an issue is \nworthy of the time, attention, and efforts of the entire court. Hopwood is such a case. Unfortunately, a bare majority of \nour colleagues have joined hands to deny this storied court the opportunity to consider this case en banc. \nThe majority of the panel overruled Bakke, wrote far too broadly, and spoke a plethora of unfortunate dicta. That \nwas not their prerogative, yet this court declined to reconsider Hopwood en banc. From that decision we must, perforce, \ndissent. \nStewart, Circuit Judge, dissenting from failure to grant rehearing en banc. \nI wholeheartedly concur in the dissent to the denial of en banc rehearing. I write separately to underscore the lack \nof historical perspective and sensitivity in both the panel majority's opinion and the vote not to consider this case en \nbanc. \nThat it is the University [**14]  of Texas School of Law's admissions policy at issue is a fact whose significance \nhas not been lost on any of us. In 1946, this very school denied admission to Heman Marion Sweatt because he was \nblack, prompting him to sue the University. Sweatt's real difficulties began fifty years before when the United States \nSupreme Court scripted one of this nation's  [*725]  most evil conceits in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 41 L. Ed. \n256, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896), declaring \"separate but equal\" treatment of black Americans constitutional. Plessy was no \nmore than a license for continued racial discrimination. However, in 1950 the Supreme Court held that excluding Sweatt \non account of his race violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. \n629, 94 L. Ed. 1114, 70 S. Ct. 848 (1950). 1 \n \n1   When a court ordered the State to provide a law school for blacks, Texas created a \"makeshift law school that \nhad no permanent staff, no library staff, no facilities, and was not accredited.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F. \nSupp. 551, 555 (1994). This \"law school\" consisted of 3 rooms in a basement and had two professors. Paul But-\nler, Affirmative Action Admissions, Dallas Morning News, April 7, 1996, at 1J. \n [**15]  History, in its characteristic irony, takes this court to that hallowed ground of civil rights jurisprudence to \nassess the University's effort to encourage minority enrollment and counter its legacy of segregation. It is an unfortu-\nnate, further irony that the panel majority opinion should so overreach in its decision. In Sweatt's case, the Supreme \nCourt explicitly adhered to the \"principle of deciding constitutional questions only in the context of the particular case \nbefore the Court,\" drawing its decision \"as narrowly as possible.\" 339 U.S. at 631 (citing Rescue Army v. Municipal \nCourt 1947, 331 U.S. 549, 91 L. Ed. 1666, 67 S. Ct. 1409 (1947)). If there ever were a time to end legalized segregation, \nthat was the time. The Court was in a position to paint with a broad brush and eliminate the very regime which denied \ncivil rights to Sweatt and other blacks. Chief Justice Vinson's opinion for the Court, however, resisted calls to wax on \n\"broader issues . . . urged for our consideration.\" Id. \n \n\n \nThe panel majority in our case displayed no such discipline, instead taking the unauthorized liberty of deciding the \nappropriateness of diversity as an admissions criterion, not just the [**16]  merits of the instant admissions policy. Con-\nstitutional interpretation is a sensitive project. Limiting ourselves to the facts before the court keeps the process meas-\nured--it is a traditional check which respects the need to calibrate rights and interests carefully. Given the sensitivity of \nconstitutional interpretation, the panel majority's decision disrespects the importance of the facts. Refusing to correct \nthis travesty en banc is a grave error. \nAs to the request to intervene, what class of persons is more qualified to adduce the evidence of the present effects \nof past discrimination than current and prospective black law students? Reading Sweatt as a benchmark decision mark-\ning the end of de jure segregation is akin to shelving Trotsky's The History of the Russian Revolution upon reading only \nthe preface. Just as those initial pages fail to give a true rendition of the entire work, so too does Sweatt give only a su-\nperficial understanding of the racism it hardly addressed. A year after the Supreme Court ordered that Sweatt be admit-\nted, he left the law school \"without graduating after being subjected to racial slurs from students and professors, cross \nburnings, and [**17]  tire slashings.\" Hopwood v. State of Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551, 555 (1994). Furthermore, \"the re-\ncord reflects that during the 1950s, and into the 1960s, the University of Texas continued to implement discriminatory \npolicies against both black and Mexican American students.\" Id. It was not until 1983 that Texas even agreed, after \nyears of threats of federal action, to an acceptable plan to desegregate its higher education system. In 1987 and again in \n1994, the Department of Education instructed Texas to maintain its plan. To this day, Texas's higher education system \nstill has not been declared in compliance with Title VI and the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 556-57. \n\"The life of the law,\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed, \"is not logic, but experience.\" To divorce the time \nin which it was legally possible for Sweatt to attend the Law School from the reality he experienced there is to ignore \nthe very insidiousness of racial discrimination. It was the vestiges of that discrimination which, far from being de-\nstroyed, thrived and drove Sweatt out of the Law School. We act no less callously now in pretermitting the considera-\ntion of that legacy of discrimination by denying [**18]  rehearing. \n [*726]  For all these reasons and those expressed in the collective dissent, I vehemently disagree with our court's \ndecision not to rehear this case en banc.   \n \n ",

We affirm. \n \nI.  \nSince 1983, Texas has implemented an affirmative action policy in its higher education system, a component of \nwhich is a race conscious admissions policy for the University of Texas School of Law (Law School). On September \n29, 1992, two unsuccessful white applicants to the Law School filed a lawsuit challenging the admissions policy as ra-\ncially discriminatory. 1 Named as defendants were the State of Texas, the Board of Regents of the Texas State Univer-\nsity System, the Law School, and a number of individuals in their official capacities. Although the parties commenced \nlimited discovery, the parties' focus was a dispute over standing and ripeness. This dispute was finally resolved on Oc-\ntober 28, 1993, when the district court denied defendants' motion for summary judgment on standing and ripeness \ngrounds. On November 18, 1993, the district [**2]  court set the following deadlines: March 11, 1994 for a final pretrial \nconference; April 1, 1994, for completion of discovery; April 15, 1994 for filing of a joint pretrial order. \n \n\n \n1   The lawsuit was brought under 42 U.S.C. ß 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ß \n2000d. \nOn January 5, 1994, the TMLS and BPLA moved for intervention of right and permissive intervention. The pro-\nposed intervenors argued that they had an interest in the existing admissions policy and in the elimination of the vestiges \nof past discrimination in the Law School's admissions policy. The state defendants did not oppose intervention, but the \nplaintiffs did. Without conducting a hearing, the district court denied intervention of right, ruling that the state defen-\ndants adequately represented TMLS and BPLA's interests. The district court also denied permissive intervention, rea-\nsoning that it would \"needlessly increase cost and delay disposition of the [**3]  litigation.\" TMLS and BPLA promptly \nappealed.  [*605]  II. \nIn order to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), 2 the proposed intervenor must demonstrate 1) that it \nhas an interest in the subject matter of the action, 2) that disposition of the action may practically impair or impede the \nmovant's ability to protect that interest, and 3) that the interest is not adequately represented by the existing parties.  \nDiaz v. Southern Drilling Corp., 427 F.2d 1118, 1124 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 878, 27 L. Ed. 2d 115, 91 S. Ct. \n118 (1970). The application must also be timely under the circumstances.  Stallworth v. Monsanto Co., 558 F.2d 257, \n263 (5th Cir. 1977). \n \n2   Rule 24(a) states that \n  \n   Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action . . . when the appli-\ncant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and \nthe applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or \nimpede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately \nrepresented by existing parties. \n \n  \n [**4]  A. Adequacy of Representation \nThe district court held that BPLA and TMLS failed to demonstrate that the state did not adequately represent their \ninterests. The district court reached this conclusion principally because the petitioners' ultimate objective was the same \nas the State's: to defend the affirmative action program.  \nThe BPLA and TMLS contend that the State cannot adequately represent their interest because 1) the long history \nof discrimination against African-Americans by the State weighs against the State's willingness to vigorously represent \nthe interests of the African-American students; 2) the State's interests are broader in that they must balance the interests \nof the African-American students against other students as well as balancing educational goals, fiscal responsibility, \nadministrative concerns and public opinion; while the petitioners' only interest is in preserving an admissions policy that \nremedies the past effects of discrimination and fosters an atmosphere that is receptive to African-American students, \nand 3) the petitioners are in a better position to present evidence of recent discrimination. \nThe proposed intervenors have the burden of demonstrating  [**5]  inadequate representation. The Supreme Court \nheld in 1972 that the burden is \"minimal\" and that the requirement \"is satisfied if the applicant shows that representation \nof his interest 'may be' inadequate ...\" Trbovich v. United Mine Workers, 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10, 30 L. Ed. 2d 686, 92 \nS. Ct. 630 (1972). But where the party whose representation is said to be inadequate is a governmental agency, a much \nstronger showing of inadequacy is required. See 7C Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Pro-\ncedure ß 1909 (1986). In a suit involving a matter of sovereign interest, the State is presumed to represent the interests \nof all of its citizens.  New Orleans Public Service v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 690 F.2d 1203, 1213 n.7 (5th Cir. \n1982), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1019, 83 L. Ed. 2d 360, 105 S. Ct. 434 (1984); Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. \nHigginson, 203 U.S. App. D.C. 156, 631 F.2d 738, 740 (D.C.Cir. 1979). Because Texas is already a party, \"the appli-\ncant for [**6]  intervention must demonstrate that its interest is in fact different from that of the state and that the inter-\nest will not be represented by the state.\" EDF at 740. See also, Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota, \n989 F.2d 994 (8th Cir. 1993). \nThe BPLA and TMLS argue that they have met their burden of showing that their interests are different from the \nState's. They contend that the State must balance competing goals while they are sharply focused on preserving the ad-\nmissions policy. Moreover, they argue that because of its competing goals, the State is not in as good a position to bring \nin evidence of present effects of past discrimination and current discrimination. \n\n \nIn order to justify an affirmative action program, the State must show that there are \"present effects of past dis-\ncrimination.\" Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 90 L. Ed. 2d 260, 106 S. Ct. 1842 (1986); Podberesky v. \nKirwan, 956 F.2d 52, 57 (4th Cir. 1992). Although the BPLA and TMLS may have ready access to more evidence than \nthe State, we see no reason they cannot [**7]  provide this evidence to the State. The  [*606]  BPLA and the TMLS \nhave been authorized to act as amicus and we see no indication that the State would not welcome their assistance. BPLA \nand TMLS have not met their burden of demonstrating that they have a separate interest that the State will not ade-\nquately represent. The proposed intervenors have not demonstrated that the State will not strongly defend its affirmative \naction program. Nor have the proposed intervenors shown that they have a separate defense of the affirmative action \nplan that the State has failed to assert. See, Jansen v. Cincinnati, 904 F.2d 336 (6th Cir. 1990). \nB. Permissive Intervention \nIn its January 1994 order, the district court also denied the prospective intervenors' motion to intervene pursuant to \nRule 24(b), Fed. R. Civ. P. 3 Specifically, Judge Sparks held that the proposed intervenors' interests were adequately \nbeing represented by the defendants in the case and that adding them to the lawsuit would needlessly increase costs and \ndelay disposition of the litigation. \n \n3   Rule 24(b) states that \n  \n   Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action . . . when an appli-\ncant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common . . .. In ex-\nercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or \nprejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. \n \n  \n [**8]    \nIntervention under Rule 24(b) is left to the sound discretion of the district court, and this court has jurisdiction only \nif the district court has abused its discretion. E.G., Woolen v. Surtran Taxicabs, Inc., 684 F.2d 324, 330 (5th Cir. 1982) \n(\"the denial of amotion for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) is not appealable unless there is an abuse of discre-\ntion\"). As we have noted, we have never reversed a lower court's decision on Rule 24(b) intervention. E.g., Kneeland v. \nNat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285, 1289-90 (5th Cir. 1987); Doe v. Duncanville Independent School Dis-\ntrict, 994 F.2d 160, 168 n.10 (5th Cir. 1993). The district court plainly did not abuse its discretion in denying petition-\ners' Rule 24(b) application to intervene. \nAFFIRMED.   \n ",

S 192 \n \n \nJuly 1, 1996, Decided  \n \nPRIOR HISTORY:    ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF AP-\nPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT.   \n \nOPINION \n [*1]  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.   \n \nCONCUR \nOpinion of JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins, respecting the denial of the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari. \nWhether it is constitutional for a public college or graduate school to use race or national origin as a factor in its \nadmissions process is an issue of great national importance. The petition before us, however, does not challenge the \nlower courts' judgments that the particular admissions procedure used by the University of Texas Law School in 1992 \nwas unconstitutional. Acknowledging that the 1992 admissions program \"has long since been discontinued and will not \nbe reinstated,\" Pet. for Cert. 28, the petitioners [*2]  do not defend that program in this Court, see Reply to Brief in Op-\nposition 1, 3; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 13 (\"We agree that the 1992 [admissions] policy \nwas constitutionally flawed . . . .\"). Instead, petitioners challenge the rationale relied on by the Court of Appeals. \"This \nCourt,\" however, \"reviews judgments, not opinions.\" Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n467 U.S. 837, 842, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we must await a final \njudgment on a program genuinely in controversy before addressing the important question raised in this petition. See \nReply to Brief in Opposition 2 (\"All concede this record is inadequate to assess definitively\" the constitutionality of the \nlaw school's current consideration of race in its admissions process.).   \n ",
