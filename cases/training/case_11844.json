The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and the Life Legal Defense Foundation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages, claiming that the defendant's ordinance regulating conduct in front of women's healthcare facilities is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the plaintiff.</p><p>Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the ordinance making it unlawful, within 100 feet of the entrance of a \"reproductive health care facility,\" to \"willfully and knowingly approach within eight feet of any person seeking to enter such a facilityโฆ without the consent of such personโฆ for the purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering with such personโฆ\" was not being enforced in an even-handed manner. Under the ordinance, the term \"counseling\" is defined as \"engaging in conversation with, displaying signs to, and/or distributing literature.\" However, the plaintiff alleged that the City had a policy of not enforcing its ordinance against those individuals engaging in pro-choice speech outside of the women's healthcare facilities, while the City enforced the ordinance prohibiting counseling against those whose speech contained anti-abortion content.  </p><p>On August 4, 2009, District Court Judge Charles Breyer granted summary judgment in favor of the City. In response to the plaintiff's facial challenge to the ordinance, the district court held that its language was nearly identical to the statute upheld by the Supreme Court in <i>Hill v. Colorado</i>. The district court wrote that \"as in Hill, the Ordinance applies 'equally to all demonstrators, regardless of viewpoint, and the statutory language makes no reference to the content of the speech.' And, as in Hill, 'the State's interest[] in protecting access . . . [is] unrelated to the content of the demonstrators' speech.'\"  In response to the plaintiff's as applied challenge, the district court found that the defendant was not failing to enforce the ordinance by allowing escorts who facilitate access to the reproductive health facilities to approach patients seeking care while disallowing the plaintiff to approach the patients any closer than 8 feet.  The district court wrote that, \"escorts who approach women for the purpose of facilitating their access into a clinic are not approaching 'for the purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering.'\" Hoye v. City of Oakland, 642 F.Supp.2d 1029 (N.D. Cal. 2009). Plaintiff appealed.</p><p>On July 28, 2011, Judge Marsha Berzon of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote for the court affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's decision. The circuit court agreed that the ordinance was constitutional on its face, but that the defendant was applying the ordinance in an unconstitutional manner. The circuit court found that the City's police department was enforcing the statute against \"efforts to persuade women approaching reproductive health clinics not to receive abortions or other reproductive health services, and not to communications seeking to encourage entry into the clinic for the purpose of undergoing treatment.\" That is, the police department did not require the \"escorts\" to receive consent to speak to women seeking to enter the clinics, while it did require anti-abortion protestors to receive such consent. The circuit court remanded the case with instructions to grant plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in part and grant him relief consistent with the opinion. 653 F.3d 835 (9th Cir. 2011).</p><p>Following this ruling, the City issued new police training materials that were meant to educate officers as to the neutral application of the ordinance. On December 16, 2011 District Court Judge Breyer ruled that these training materials were adequate to grant the plaintiff relief consistent with the Ninth Circuit's opinion. The district court noted that if the police officers enforced the ordinance in a way that was inconsistent with the training materials, the plaintiff may revive his case. On May 31, 2012, plaintiff filed a motion for entry of judgment with proposed language for a three part order. Judge Breyer entered judgment on August 3, 2012, holding that: the City's policy of exempting speech facilitating access violated the First Amendment, that the City must enforce the ordinance in an evenhanded manner, and that the ordinance was constitutional on its face.</p><p>On October 1, 2012, Judge Breyer awarded plaintiff legal fees to the amount of $361,269.43. 2012 WL 4644307 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 1, 2012).</p>",

Plaintiff Walter B. Hoye, II, is a natural person.  Motivated by his moral, religious, \n24  and political beliefs, plaintiff has regularly engaged in pro-life, anti-abortion speech activities within \n25  the City.  These speech activities include hand-to-hand leafleting, education about abortion, and \n26  holding signs which say things like โGod loves you & your baby / Let us help youโ.

Defendant CITY OF OAKLAND (\"City\") is a municipal corporation organized under \n 4  the laws and Constitution of the State of California, and is a corporate entity capable of suing and \n 5  being sued.  Defendant City maintains and operates the City of Oakland Police Department which, \n 6  in the first instance, is responsible for the enforcement of the ordinance in question and the arrest of \n 7  person alleged to have violated it. \n 8  3.  JURISDICTION:   This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Title 28 \n 9  U.S.C. ยงยง1331 and 1343(3) in that the controversy arises under the United States Constitution and \n10  under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 and 28 U.S.C. ยงยง2201 and 2202.  This Court has authority to award \n11  attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1988.  Plaintiff further invokes the supplemental jurisdiction \n12  of this Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง1367(a) to hear and adjudicate state law claims.  Each and all of the \n13  acts (or threats of acts) alleged herein were done by defendants, or their officers, agents, and \n14  employees, under color and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs and usages of \n15  the City of Berkeley. \n16  4.  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT:  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. \n17  ยง1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims in this action occurred in \n18  this district. \n19  5.  On or about December 18, 2007,  the City adopted Municipal Code Chapter 8.50, \n20  entitled โAccess to Reproductive Health Care Facilitiesโ (herein the โ original ordinanceโ). On \n21  December 18, 2007, Plaintiff filed this action challenging the constitutionality of the original \n22  ordinance. Following a hearing on Plaintiffโs Application for Temporary Restraining Order, the City, \n23  through its attorneys, agreed not to enforce the original ordinance and to amend that ordinance. On \n24  February 5, 2008, the City amended Chapter 8.50. A copy of the amended ordinance (hereinafter \n25  the โOrdinanceโ) is attached to this Amended Complaint as Exhibit A. \n26  6.  Violation of the Ordinance is a criminal misdemeanor under ยง4(a). \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 2 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document74   Filed04/07/09   Page3 of 10\n 1  7.  The law enforcement arm of the City is the Oakland Police Department (โOPDโ).  It is \n 2  the OPD which actually interprets, enforces, and arrests persons who have allegedly violated the \n 3  Ordinance. \n 4  8.  The OPD has a set of regulations which supposedly govern its enforcement of the \n 5  Ordinance.  The regulations are contained in a โTraining Bulletinโ, the current version of which is \n 6  dated May 1, 2008, and attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \n 7  9.  In practice, OPD enforces and interprets the Ordinance in various and conflicting ways, \n 8  with the effect a person can never be particularly sure whether their conduct will or will not be \n 9  charged as a violation of the Ordinance.   Some of the interpretations violate the constitutional \n10  norms set forth in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000), for example: \n11  A.  On March 25, 2008, at approximately 8:30 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, an OPD \n12  officer explained to plaintiff and others present that the Ordinance created a โmoving bubble zoneโ  \n13  so that any time plaintiff was standing within 100 feet of the clinic, he had to move more than 8 feet \n14  away from any person who approached him or was going into the clinic.  The police were clear that \n15  failure to abide by this interpretation would make plaintiff subject to arrest for violation of the \n16  ordinance.  Plaintiffโs counsel communicated to the City attorney this interpretation, and the City \n17  attorney has never communicated back to plaintiffโs counsel that such is not the official policy of the \n18  OPD.  While on May 29, 2008, an attorney for the City stated in a legal brief that โ[t]he Ordinance \n19  expressly applies only when speakers . . . approach individuals near the clinic โ not when they \n20  merely remain stationaryโ, the City has offered no assurance that the OPD has changed its policy to \n21  conform to the Cityโs legal briefing.   \n22  B.  On May 13, 2008, shortly after 10:00 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, an OPD officer \n23  told plaintiff that he was not allowed to approach or be within 8 feet of escorts, clinic personnel, or \n24  clients.  The officer intended for plaintiff to understand that merely being within 8 feet of escorts, \n25  clinic personnel, or clients within the 100โ zone would result in his arrest.  Plaintiffโs counsel has \n26  informed the City attorney of this OPD interpretation, and the City attorney has never denied that \n27  such is the official policy of the OPD.  While on May 29, 2008, an attorney for the City stated in a \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 3 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document74   Filed04/07/09   Page4 of 10\n 1  legal brief that โ[t]he Ordinance expressly applies only when speakers . . . approach individuals near \n 2  the clinic โ not when they merely remain stationaryโ, the City has offered no assurance that the \n 3  OPD has changed its policy to conform to the Cityโs legal briefing.   \n 4  C.  On June 3, 2008, between 9:10 a.m. and 9:31 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, a \n 5  witness observed two different clinic escorts, whom plaintiff alleges on information and belief are \n 6  volunteers, approaching within 8 feet of persons entering the clinic and speaking to them without \n 7  obtaining their consent.  The witness called OPD at 9:34 a.m. to report this apparent violation of the \n 8  Ordinance.  The dispatching officer asked for descriptions of the alleged offenders and also asked if \n 9  one was a certain male โbecause if he is there, there is an ordinance against him and he should not \n10  be there.โ  At around 10:05 a.m. Officer V. Johnson responded.  After learning of the situation, the \n11  Officer responded that the escorts were โprofessional peopleโ so it was permissible for them to \n12  approach patients.  The next day the witness again spoke with Officer Johnson who said he was not \n13  filing an official report about the incident.  Officer Johnson stated that his supervisor, who is \n14  Sergeant David Elzey, explained that volunteer clinic escorts were โprotected individualsโ who \n15  could not be charged with violating the Ordinance by approaching clients to converse.  On June 5, \n16  2008, plaintiffโs counsel communicated Sgt. Elzeyโs interpretation to the City attorney via email.  \n17  The City attorney responded back to the email but did not in any way deny or discount the policy \n18  set forth by Sgt. Elzey. \n19  10.  Plaintiff has already been arrested once for allegedly violating the Ordinance and is at \n20  risk to be arrested again.  Plaintiff contends that he is the individual whom the OPD dispatcher \n21  specifically noted as to whom the ordinance was against, and that the police will arrest him \n22  according to the interpretations they have given as set forth above.  The OPD itself, has never \n23  disavowed any of the three interpretations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and the City \n24  attorney has not disavowed the last interpretation.  Plaintiff reasonably fears that he will be arrested \n25  by OPD for conduct which is not prohibited by the Ordinance and/or otherwise protected by the \n26  U.S. Constitution. \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 4 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document74   Filed04/07/09   Page5 of 10\n 1  11.  The OPD has an unwritten policy exempting from the reach of the Ordinance any \n 2  person who approaches and speaks to clients for the purposes of encouraging them to use clinic \n 3  services. That same unwritten policy holds that plaintiff is to be arrested if he approaches and speaks \n 4  to clients for the purposes of encouraging them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.  \n 5  This is a form of content and viewpoint discrimination. \n 6  12.  The Ordinance, both as written and as enforced by defendant, is content- and viewpoint- \n 7  based, abuses governmental power, denies free speech in a traditional public forum, does not further \n 8  any important or substantial government interest, and imposes restrictions that are greater than \n 9  necessary to further any government interest asserted.  \n10  13.  Specifically but not exclusively, the ordinance is content-based because the main \n11  purpose in enacting it was to suppress speech of a certain content and because it differentiates \n12  speech based on the content of the speech. This includes, without limitation, the fact that the \n13  ordinance elevates commercial speech over non-commercial speech by restricting โprotest, \n14  education, and counselingโ but not other forms of speech such as panhandling and vending. \n15  14.  Specifically but not exclusively, the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve any \n16  significant governmental interest and imposes restrictions that are greater than necessary to further \n17  such interests because, on its face and as applied, it restricts uninvited approaches as well as \n18  unwanted and unwelcome approaches.  \n19  15.  Any interest advanced by defendant to support the Ordinance is related to the \n20  suppression of constitutional and statutory rights and is also minor compared to the infringement of \n21  rights worked by the Ordinance.  \n22  16.  Unless and until defendants are restrained by order of this Court, defendants, acting \n23  through their officers, servants, agents and employees, will enforce the Ordinance. \n24  17. Unless and until this Court declares the Ordinance unconstitutional, defendant, acting \n25  through its officers, servants, agents and employees, will enforce the Ordinance. \n26  18. All of the acts of the defendant, its officers, agents, servants, and employees, as alleged \n27  herein, were done or are threatened to be done under color and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 5 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document74   Filed04/07/09   Page6 of 10\n 1  regulations, customs, official policies, official procedures, and usages of the City of Oakland and the \n 2  State of California.  \n 3  19. Plaintiff is suffering irreparable injury from the enforcement and threat of enforcement of \n 4  the Ordinance, and will continue to suffer irreparable injury until the threat of enforcement is lifted. \n 5   \n 6  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n 7  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: FREE SPEECH AND DUE PROCESS) \n 8  20.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully restated here. \n 9  21. The Ordinance is an unconstitutional abridgment on its face, and as applied or threatened \n10  to be applied, of the plaintiffโs affirmative rights to freedom of speech under the United States \n11  Constitution, First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n12  22. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is an \n13  unconstitutionally overbroad restriction on expressive activity. \n14  23. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is an \n15  unconstitutionally vague restriction on expressive activity. \n16  24. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is a content-based \n17  and viewpoint-based restriction on speech. \n18  25.  The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, does not serve a \n19  significant governmental interest.  \n20  26. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, does not leave \n21  open ample alternative channels of communication.  \n22  27. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is neither narrowly \n23  tailored nor the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental purpose sought \n24  to be served by the legislation. \n25  28. The Ordinance fails to adequately advise, notify, or inform persons threatened with \n26  possible prosecution for violation of their requirements. Therefore, the Ordinance is \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 6 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document74   Filed04/07/09   Page7 of 10\n 1  unconstitutionally vague, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, in violation of the \n 2  due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n 3  29. The Ordinance is an irrational and unreasonable statute, imposing unjustifiable \n 4  restrictions on the exercise of protected constitutional rights. Because the Ordinance is irrational \n 5  and unreasonable, its application violates the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment \n 6  to the Untied States Constitution \n 7  30.  The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, violates the Equal \n 8  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and similar \n 9  guarantees in the California State Constitution by denying plaintiff free speech rights allowed to \n10  others in similar situations and other protections of state and federal law. \n11  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n12  (42 U.S.C. SECTION 1983: EQUAL PROTECTION) \n13  31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 โ 30 as if fully set forth herein. \n14  32. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, violates the Equal \n15  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically but not exclusively, the Ordinance \n16  creates three classes:  Persons entering abortion clinics, persons wishing to communicate with those \n17  entering abortion clinics for the purposes of encouraging them to use clinic services, and persons \n18  wishing to communicate with those entering abortion clinics for the purposes of encouraging them \n19  to choose options other than utilizing clinic services. \n20  33.  These classifications have a direct bearing on the fundamental interest in free speech. \n21  The City has no compelling interest justifying the creation of these classes and cannot show that \n22  these classifications are necessary to serve any legitimate governmental interest.   \n23  34.  The Ordinance singles out persons approaching abortion clinics as a class to be \n24  specifically isolated from speech, and correspondingly burdens the speech of that class of persons \n25  wishing to encourage them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.  These \n26  classifications have a direct bearing on the fundamental interest in free speech.

R. CIV. P. 62(c).  Plaintiff seeks to enjoin enforcement of Oakland\nFF\n19 Municipal Code ยง 8.50.010 (โthe Ordinanceโ) pending appeal.  Under Hilton v. Braunskill,\n20 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987), the Court is to consider four factors in ruling on such an\n21 application: โ(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to\n22 succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3)\n23 whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the\n24 proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.โ  \n25 The Court agrees that โ[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal\n26 periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.โ  See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.\n27 347, 373 (1976).  However, granting an injunction may risk injury to patients who seek\n28 access to Oaklandโs reproductive healthcare facilitiesโ access which the Ordinance aims to\nprotect.  In addition, the public interest lies in balancing the right to free speech and\n\n1 expression with the right to access reproductive healthcare; granting an injunction would\n2 skew that balance.  Most importantly, the Court finds, as articulated in its twenty-five page\n3 Order granting summary judgment for Defendant, that Plaintiff has failed to make a strong\n4 showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits.  Plaintiffโs Application has not convinced\n5 the Court otherwise.  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs Application is DENIED.  The hearing currently\n6 scheduled for October 9, 2009 is hereby VACATED. \n7 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n8\nDated: September 30, 2009                                                             \n9 CHARLES  R.

HOYE, II, No. CV 07-06411 CRB\nrr\nttoo\nrrff\nououaliali 12 Plaintiff, ORDER RE TRAINING MATERIALS\nCCCC\nct ct of of  13     v.\nririct ct \nststriri 14\nDiDistst CITY OF OAKLAND,\nii\n  DD\nss\nteten n  15 Defendant.\ntataerer                                                                       /\nSShh\nd d rtrt 16\noo\nteteNN\nninie e  17 In July 2011, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part this Courtโs order\nUUhh\ntt\n  \noror 18 granting summary judgment for Defendant, the City of Oakland, concluding that, although\nFF\n19 Defendantโs bubble ordinance was constitutional on its face, the Cityโs enforcement policy\n20 was a constitutionally invalid, content-based regulation of speech.  See Hoye v. Oakland, 653\n21 F.3d 835, 859 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Ninth Circuitโs opinion turned on its finding that โ[t]he\n22 Cityโs policy of distinguishing between speech that facilitates access to clinics and speech\n23 that discourages access is not content-neutral.โ  Id. at 851.  The case was remanded to this\n24 Court โwith instructions to grant Hoyeโs motion for summary judgment in part and to grant\n25 him relief consistent with this opinion.โ  Id. at 859.\n26 Defendant has submitted revised training materials, which consist of a training\n27 bulletin and the script of a training video.  See generally dkt. 197.  Plaintiff argues that the\n28 revised training materials are unconstitutional.  See generally dkt. 201.  The Court has\n\n1 carefully considered the Ninth Circuitโs opinion, the revised training materials, and the\n2 papers and arguments of the parties, and makes the following holding.\n3 The revised training materials are adequate โto grant [Plaintiff] relief consistent withโ\n4 the Ninth Circuitโs opinion.  Consistent with the Ninth Circuitโs opinion, the materials now\n5 specify, for example: โAccording to the appellate court, [the eight foot bubble] applies\n6 equally to protestors and escort volunteers.  This is a change from the previous enforcement\n7 policy.  That means that escort volunteers helping patients enter a clinic must have consent to\n8 approach within eight feet of a patient.โ  See dkt. 197-4 at 2.\n9 Defendant is thus directed to enforce the ordinance in a manner consistent with the\n10 protocols in the revised training materials.1  See dkt. 197.  If Defendant enforces the\na\nni 11 ordinance in a manner materially inconsistent with the revised training materials, Plaintiff is\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 invited to bring such conduct to the Courtโs attention.  The Court will not give an advisory\noa\nCC\nct of  13 opinion about policies or practices that might never exist.  \nrict \nstri 14 For the sake of clarity, the Court reiterates its holding from the bench that it accepts\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 Defendantโs representation at the motion hearing that the Defendantโs policy will be to\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 exempt only the provision of medical care by medical professionals outside of the clinics.2\no\nteN\nnie  17 Defendant represented, and the Court agrees, that there is no blanket exemption for doctors,\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 nurses, and clinic employees.3\nF\n19 The Court further rejects Plaintiffโs invitation to revisit the definition of the word\n20 โapproach,โ addressed in a single sentence of Plaintiffโs Motion.  See dkt. 201 at i.  If the\n21\n1\n The Court rejects the additional language Defendant proposes in its Opposition, see dkt. 203\n22 at 4-5, pertaining to the new policy at the FPS clini.c  Such language is problematic because (1) the FPS\nclinic script does not elicit the same consent as is required by the Ordinance; (2) the FPS policy does\n23 not address individuals accom panying patients; a nd (3) the FPS policy does not address patients\nattempting to drop in on the clinic who have not yet been informed that appointments are to be made\n24 in advance.   The revised training materials the Court accepts are therefore onl ythose materials provided\nin dkt. 197.\n25\n2\n See also dkt. 203 at 6 (arguing for exemption โto approach patients without consent within\n26 eight feet if necessary to provide medical care (for example, if a patient approaching the clinic had a\nheart attack or fainted and needed immediate attention).โ \n27\n3\n Thus, a medical professional who willfully and knowingly approaches within eight feet of a\n28 patient seeking to enter a clinic, without the  consent of the patient, for the purpose of counseling,\nharassing, or interfering with the patient, will be doing so in violation of the ordinance.\n2\n\n1 Ninth Circuit did not agree with this Courtโs discussion of โapproachโ as including a\n2 demonstrator who stands still but lifts his arm toward a patient, see dkt. 152 at 20-22, it could\n3 have said so.  What it held instead was, โHoyeโs allegations of vagueness need not detain us.\n4 Hoye contends that the Ordinanceโs use of the terms โapproachโ and โconsentโ are\n5 impermissibly vague.

See Mot. (dkt. 223).  The\nUUhh\ntt\n  \noror 18 Court finds that Plaintiff is the prevailing party, but that his success in the case was limited. \nFF\n19 Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffโs fee motion, but reduces his fee award, as\n20 explained below.\n21 I. BACKGROUND\n22 The City of Oaklandโs โbubble ordinanceโ creates an eight-foot buffer around people\n23 seeking access to reproductive health care clinics (โclinicsโ).  See Hoye v. Oakland, 653 F.3d\n24 835, 841 (9th Cir. 2011).  The Ordinance provides that within 100 feet of a clinic, it is\n25 unlawful to โwillfully and knowingly approach within eight (8) feet of any person seeking to\n26 enter such a facility, or any occupied motor vehicle seeking entry, without the consent of\n27 such person or vehicle occupant, for the purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering with\n28 such person or vehicle occupant.โ  See id. \n\n1 Plaintiff, a pro-life โsidewalk counselorโ in Oakland, id. at 839, brought suit, claiming\n2 that the Ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as-applied, see generally id. \n3 Following extensive litigation, the Court in August 2009 granted Defendantโs motion for\n4 summary judgment, upholding the constitutionality of the Ordinance.  See generally Order re\n5 MSJ (dkt. 152).  This Court held that the Ordinance was constitutional facially and as-\n6 applied; one key to the latter holding was the Courtโs conclusion it did not violate the\n7 Ordinance when volunteer escorts approached women for the purpose of facilitating access\n8 to the clinic.  Id. at 11.   \n9 The Ninth Circuit in July 2011 affirmed in part and reversed in part, concluding that,\n10 although the Ordinance was constitutional on its face, Oaklandโs enforcement policy was a\na\nni 11 constitutionally invalid, content-based regulation of speech.  See Hoye, 653 F.3d at 859.  The\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Ninth Circuit noted that a โtheme central to [Plaintiffโs] challenge is his contention that\noa\nCC\nct of  13 Oakland does not enforce the Ordinance evenhandedly.โ  Id. at 840.  Agreeing with that\nrict \nstri 14 contention, the court found that โ[t]he Cityโs policy of distinguishing between speech that\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 facilitates access to clinics and speech that discourages access is not content-neutral.โ  Id. at\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 851.  The Ninth Circuit therefore had to โcraft a remedy designed to forecloseโ Oakland from\no\nteN\nnie  17 enforcing the Ordinance as it was erroneously understood, โwhile preserving the facially\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 valid Ordinance.โ  Id. at 856.  The court remanded the case with instructions that this Court\nF\n19 grant Plaintiffโs motion for summary judgment in part and grant relief consistent with its\n20 opinion.  Id. at 859.\n21 This Court held a status conference in August, 2011.  See Minutes (dkt. 191).  The\n22 City represented that it was revising its written enforcement policy to comply with the Ninth\n23 Circuitโs opinion; Plaintiff asserted that his vagueness challenge to the Cityโs policy of\n24 equating an outstretched arm to an approach was also up for reconsideration.  The Court\n25 allowed additional briefing on that subject.  See Supplemental Briefs (dkts. 195, 196). \n26 Plaintiff requested a permanent injunction, one of several in the case, based on the Cityโs\n27 proposed enforcement exemptions.  See MPI (dkts. 199, 201).  The Court then entered an\n28 order directing Defendant to enforce the Ordinance in a manner consistent with the protocols\n2\n\n1 in the revised training materials, and declined to revisit the definition of the word\n2 โapproach.โ1  See Order re Training Materials (dkt. 208).  \n3 The parties agreed that there were no factual or legal disputes for the Court to resolve,\n4 and submitted their own proposed judgments.  See Mot. for Entry of Judgment (dkt. 212);\n5 Response (dkt. 220).  The Court entered Plaintiffโs proposed judgment on August 3, 2012. \n6 See Judgment (dkt. 234).  Plaintiff then moved for attorneysโ fees.  See Mot.\n7 II. LEGAL STANDARD\n8 Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988, prevailing parties in civil rights cases are entitled to\n9 reasonable attorneysโ fees under certain circumstances.  42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b) (2012).  As an\n10 initial matter, a court must determine whether the party seeking fees has โprevailed.โ \na\nni 11 See Friend v. Kolodzieczak, 72 F.3d 1386, 1389 (9th Cir. 1995).  Once a court determines\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 that a civil rights plaintiff has prevailed, the court may award reasonable attorneysโ fees.  Id. \noa\nCC\nct of  13 To determine the amount of the award, a court usually begins by calculating the โlodestarโ\nrict \nstri 14 amount โ the number of hours reasonably spent in achieving the results obtained multiplied\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 by a reasonable hourly rate.  Id.  โA court may also consider other factors, including the\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 degree of success obtained, and make adjustments to the lodestar accordingly.โ  Id. (citing\no\nteN\nnie  17 Kerr v. Screen Extras Guild, Inc., 526 F.2d 67, 70 (9th Cir.1975)).  \nUh\nt\n \nor 18 III. DISCUSSION\nF\n19 Plaintiff seeks a total of $585,060.88 in fees and costs (reflecting his original\n20 $552,043.38 request, adjusted to correct for a couple of errors identified by Defendant, plus\n21\n1\n The Court explained: \n22\nIf the Ninth Circuit did not  agree with this Courtโs discussion of โapproachโ as including a\n23 demonstrator who stands still but lifts his arm toward a patient, see dkt. 152 at 20-22, it could\nhave said so.  What it held instead was, โHoyeโs allegations of vagueness need not detain us.\n24 Hoye contends that the Ordinanceโs use of thtee rms โapproachโ and โconsentโ are impermissibly\nvague. But the Ordinance uses these terms in precisely the same manner as the Colorado statute.\n25 . . . The Ordinance cannot therefore be vague i nthese respects for the same reasons that Hill held\nthe Colorado statute not to be va gue.โ  See  Hoye, 653 F.3d at 849 n.11 (internal citation\n26 omitted).  The Ninth Circuitโs partial reversal, based on โ[t]he Cityโs policy of distinguishing\nbetween speech that facilitates access to clinics and speech that discourages access,โ id a.t 851,\n27 is not . . . an opportunity to revisit every othe r argument Plaintiff has as to the Ordinanceโs\nunconstitutionality.\n28\nId. at 2-3.\n3\n\n1 $34,662.50 for work done in support of this Motion).  See Reply (dkt. 229) at 15.  Defendant\n2 opposes the Motion.  The issues for the Court to determine are (A) whether Plaintiff is the\n3 prevailing party, and (B) if so, what a reasonable fee award would be. \n4 A. Prevailing Party\n5 1. Legal Principles\n6 A plaintiff is a โprevailing partyโ if resolution of the case โchanges the legal\n7 relationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant.โ  See Texas State Teachers Assโn v.\n8 Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989).  A material โalteration of the legal\n9 relationship between the partiesโ may be effectuated by a judgment on the merits or a\n10 court-ordered consent decree.  Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W. Va. Depโt of\na\nni 11 Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 605 (2001).  Plaintiffs may be considered prevailing\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 parties โif they succeed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.โ  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).\nrict \nstri 14 โA litigant need not prevail on every issue, or even on the โcentral issueโ in the case, to be\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 considered the prevailing party.  It is enough that he succeed โon any significant claim\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 affording some of the relief sought, either pendente lite or at the conclusion of the\no\nteN\nnie  17 litigation.โโ  Stivers v. Pierce, 71 F.3d 732, 751 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing Tex. State Teachers\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Assโn, 489 U.S. at 790-91).\nF\n19   2. Application to this Case\n20 Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not the prevailing party, asserting that โThe\n21 Ordinance Plaintiff sought to enjoin remains in effect.  Indeed, it is more secure than before,\n22 having been declared constitutional on its face.โ  Mot. at 5.  It further asserts that nothing has\n23 changed between the parties because Plaintiff still cannot come within eight feet of a patient\n24 seeking to enter a clinic without her consent, or thrust his arm within eight feet of such a\n25 person.  Id. at 6.  \n26 Those arguments fail, because they speak to the extent to which Plaintiff prevailed;\n27 that he prevailed cannot reasonably be disputed.  Plaintiff argued early on that โThe OPD has\n28 an unwritten policy exempting from the reach of the Ordinance any person who approaches\n4\n\n1 and speaks to clients for the purposes of encouraging them to use clinic services.  That same\n2 unwritten policy holds that plaintiff is to be arrested if he approaches and speaks to clients\n3 for the purposes of encouraging them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.โ \n4 First Amended Complaint (โFACโ) (dkt. 38) ยถ 11.  The Ninth Circuit recognized that a\n5 โtheme central to [Plaintiffโs] challenge is his contention that Oakland does not enforce the\n6 Ordinance evenhandedly.โ  Hoye, 653 F.3d at 840.  The Ninth Circuit agreed with Plaintiff\n7 that โOaklandโs enforcement policy is a constitutionally invalid, content-based regulation of\n8 speech.โ  Id. at 859.  At the Ninth Circuitโs direction, this Court on remand entered an order\n9 directing Defendant to enforce the Ordinance in a manner consistent with the protocols in the\n10 revised training materials.  See Order re Training Materials.  Those revised training materials\na\nni 11 specify that: โAccording to the appellate court, [the eight foot bubble] applies equally to\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 protestors and escort volunteers.  This is a change from the previous enforcement policy.โ \noa\nCC\nct of  13 See Training Materials (dkt. 197-4) at 2.  The Court entered judgment, reiterating that\nrict \nstri 14 Oaklandโs enforcement policy of exempting speech that facilitated access was\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 unconstitutional, and directing Oakland to enforce the Ordinance in an evenhanded matter. \nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 See Judgment.  \no\nteN\nnie  17 There can be no question, then, that Plaintiff achieved success on a โsignificant issue\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 in litigation which achieves some of the benefit [he] sought in bringing suit.โ  See Hensley,\nF\n19 461 U.S. at 433.  Plaintiffโs legal relationship with Oakland has also arguably changed\n20 because he now has a judgment stating that Oakland cannot enforce the Ordinance against\n21 him any differently than it can someone with an opposing viewpoint.  That is something he\n22 did not have before.  He is, therefore, the prevailing party.  The Court now turns to the\n23 question of a reasonable award.\n24       B. Reasonable Award\n25 1. Legal Principles\n26 The Supreme Court in Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433, instructed that โ[t]he most useful\n27 starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours\n28 reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.โ  Counsel for\n5\n\n1 prevailing parties are to make a concerted effort to exclude excessive, redundant, or\n2 otherwise unnecessary hours.  Id. at 434.  However, โthe product of reasonable hours times a\n3 reasonable rate does not end the inquiry,โ in light of other considerations that might lead a\n4 court to adjust a fee award up or down, such as the โresults obtained.โ  Id.  The Court\n5 explained that โ[t]his factor is particularly crucial where a plaintiff is deemed โprevailingโ\n6 even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief.โ  Id.  When that happens,\n7 courts are to ask (1) whether Plaintiff failed to prevail โon claims that were unrelated to the\n8 claims on which he succeededโ; and (2) whether Plaintiff โachieve[d] a level of success that\n9 makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.  Id. \n10 Where a plaintiff has achieved only partial success, โthe most critical factor is the degree of\na\nni 11 success obtained.โ  Id. at 436.  โA reduced fee award is appropriate if the relief, however\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 significant, is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.โ  Id. at 440. \noa\nCC\nct of  13 District courts must set forth a โconcise but clear explanation of [their] reasons for the\nrict \nstri 14 fee award.โ  Id. at 437.  This does not mean, however, that a district court must โset forth an\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 hour-by-hour analysis of the fee request.โ  Gates v. Deukmejian, 987 F.2d 1392, 1399 (9th\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 Cir. 1992).  Rather, โwhen faced with a massive fee application the district court has the\no\nteN\nnie  17 authority to make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed or\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 in the final lodestar figure โas a practical means of trimming the fat from a fee application.โโ \nF\n19 Id. (citing N.Y. State Assโn for Retarded Children v. Carey, 711 F.2d 1136, 1146 (2d Cir.\n20 1983)); but see Moreno v. City of Sacramento, 534 F.3d 1106, 1116 (9th Cir. 2008) (โif all\n21 the district court offers is a conclusory statement that a fee request is too high, then we canโt\n22 tell if the court is applying its superior knowledge to trim an excessive request or if it is\n23 randomly lopping off chunks of the winning lawyerโs reasonably billed fees.โ).  \n24 2. Application to this Case\n25 As an initial matter, the Court has reviewed Plaintiffโs fee request and the billing\n26 records he submitted.  Nothing about the hours Plaintiffโs counsel worked on the litigation as\n27 a whole appear to the Court to be redundant or excessive.  This was a heavily litigated civil\n28 rights case that began five years ago; it understandably consumed many hours of counselโs\n6\n\n1 time.  Further, Plaintiff requests that his counsel be compensated at the rate of $550 per hour. \n2 See Mot. at 10-13.  Given the skill and experience of his counsel, and other like awards from\n3 this district, that rate is appropriate.  Notably, Defendant does not object to the $550 per hour\n4 rate.  See Oppโn (dkt. 224) at 2.  Accordingly, the Court accepts Plaintiffโs lodestar. \n5 However, this is not the end of the inquiry.  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 (โthe product of\n6 reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry,โ in light of other\n7 considerations that might lead a court to adjust a fee award up or down, such as the โresults\n8 obtained.โ). \n9 Plaintiff argues that he achieved โexcellent results,โ because his case โhad one main\n10 objective: to obtain declaratory injunctive relief protecting plaintiffโs right to engage in free\na\nni 11 speech activities on public sidewalks outside abortion clinics on equal terms with clinic\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 escorts and others espousing different viewpoints.โ  Mot. at 2.  He cites to Hensley for the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 proposition that โ[w]here a plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should\nrict \nstri 14 recover a fully compensatory fee.โ  Id. (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435).  Although Plaintiff\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 concedes that he did not prevail on his facial attack on the Ordinance, he argues that โhis\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 attorneys still are entitled to recover for the time expended on that claim because they\no\nteN\nnie  17 involve related legal theories or arose from a common core of facts.โ  Id. (citing City of\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 564 (1986) and Webb v. Sloan, 330 F.3d 1158, 1169 (9th\nF\n19 Cir. 2003)).  The Court disagrees.  \n20 a. Claims Not Related\n21 Plaintiff prevailed on his as-applied challenge to the Ordinance, and failed to prevail\n22 on his facial challenge to the Ordinance.  In such circumstances, the Court is to ask whether\n23 Plaintiff failed to prevail โon claims that were unrelated to the claims on which he\n24 succeeded.โ  See Hansley, 461 U.S. at 434.  The Court concludes that the as-applied\n25 challenge and the facial challenge โ although both generally about the Ordinance โ were\n26 unrelated.  That is to say, the two challenges did not โinvolve a common core of facts or . . .\n27 related legal theories.โ  See Thomas v. City of Tacoma, 410 F.3d 644, 649 (9th Cir. 2005);\n28\n7\n\n1 see also Webb v. Sloan, 330 F.3d 1158, 1168 (9th Cir. 2003) (unrelated claims are those that\n2 are โentirely distinct and separate from the claims on which the plaintiff prevailed.โ).  \n3 The two sets of facts are different.  The facts involved in the as-applied challenge\n4 were the Plaintiffโs โcounselingโ activities outside of the clinics, the actions of the escorts,\n5 and the responses of the Oakland Police Department.  The only facts involved in the facial\n6 challenge were the words of the Ordinance.  The legal theories were also entirely distinct.\n7 Plaintiff did not need to bring a facial challenge in order to bring an as-applied challenge,2\n8 and โthe efforts expended on the unsuccessful claims did not contribute to [the plaintiff]\n9 prevailing on the successful claim,โ see Schwarz v. Secโy of Health & Human Servs., 73\n10 F.3d 895, 904 (9th Cir. 1995) (relying on Herrington v. Cnty. of Sonoma, 883 F.2d 739 (9th\na\nni 11 Cir. 1989)).  Plaintiffโs failed efforts to show that various phrases in the Ordinance rendered\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 it content-based, or vague, contributed not at all to his successful efforts to show that the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 Cityโs expressed policy of enforcing the Ordinance against a โsidewalk counselorโ who\nrict \nstri 14 asked โMay I talk to you about alternatives to the clinic?โ but not against an escort who\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 asked, โMay I help you into the clinic?โ was content-based.  See Hoye, 653 F.3d at 850-51.\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 Because Plaintiffโs work on the unsuccessful facial claims โcannot be deemed to have\no\nteN\nnie  17 been โexpended in pursuit of the ultimate result achievedโโ on his as-applied claims, the\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Court is to treat the facial claims โas if they had been raised in separate lawsuits,โ and award\nF\n19 no fees for them.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435 (citing Davis v. Cty. of Los Angeles. 8\n20 E.D.P. ยถ 9444, at 5049 (C.D. Cal. 1974).  But the Court finds itself unable to excise from\n21 Plaintiffโs fee request the hours worked on the unsuccessful claims.  โIf it is impossible to\n22\n23 2 Plaintiffโs contention that Oakland โinvitedโ af acial challenge by arguing that its enforcement\npolicy was no different from the Ordinance as it was written is not well taken.  See Mot. at 5. Many\n24 defendants will respond to an as-applied challenge by arguing that they are enforcing an ordinance in\na manner consistent with its term s.  That does not m ean that every case involving an as-applied\n25 challenge must also involve a facial challenge.  Plaintiffs should onyl bring facial challenges when they\ncan in good faith argue that the language of an  ordinance is unconstitutional.  Here, because  the\n26 Ordinance was modeled on the law upheld in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000), a facial challenge\nwas by no m eans a foregone conclusion.  See  Hoye, 653 F.3d at 843 (โBecause the Ordinance is\n27 modeled on the Colorado statute upheld in Hill, that opinion controls much of our analysis in this case\nand leads us to the conclusion that the Ordinance is a facially valid restriction on the time, place, and\n28 manner of speech.โ); id. at 842 (describing Hill statute as โmarkedly similar to the Ordinanceโ here);\nid. at 844 (โThe relevant portions of the Ordinance largely replicate the Colorado statuteโ).\n8\n\n1 isolate the truly unrelated claims from those related claims, the district court should instead\n2 reflect that limited success in [the] second step.โ  Thomas, 410 F.3d at 649-50 (internal\n3 quotations omitted).  The Court will therefore โfocus on the significance of the overall relief\n4 obtained by the plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended on the litigation.โ \n5 Hensley, 461 at 435.3  \n6 b. Limited Success\n7 Plaintiff achieved significant relief when the Ninth Circuit agreed with him that\n8 โOaklandโs enforcement policy is a constitutionally invalid, content-based regulation of\n9 speechโ and remanded the case with the instructions that it did.  See Hoye, 653 F.3d at 859. \n10 Defendantโs arguments to the contrary sound like sour grapes.  See, e.g., Oppโn at 7 (โAll the\na\nni 11 City had to do was add a few words to those [training] materialsโ).  Still, โa reduced fee\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 award is appropriate if the relief, however significant, is limited in comparison to the scope\noa\nCC\nct of  13 of the litigation as a whole.โ  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440. \nrict \nstri 14 The litigation as a whole did not, as Plaintiff now argues, have โone main objective: to\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 obtain declaratory injunctive relief protecting plaintiffโs right to engage in free speech\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 activities on public sidewalks outside abortion clinics on equal terms with clinic escorts and\no\nteN\nnie  17 others espousing different viewpoints.โ  See Mot. at 2.  It was about evenhanded\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 enforcement, but it was also very much about Plaintiffโs desire to have the Ordinance in its\nF\n19 entirety declared unconstitutional and, indeed, unenforceable.  See, e.g., Pโs MSJ (dkt. 92-1)\n20 at 25 (โSimply put, this case is not Hill and the Ordinance is facially unconstitutional because\n21 the asserted government interest does not justify these restrictions.โ); id. at 35 (โThe Court\n22 should grant Plaintiffโs Motion for Summary Judgment, declare the ordinance\n23 unconstitutional, and permanently enjoin defendant from enforcing it.โ).  Even-handed\n24\n3 The Court notes that Hensley explained that a district court โmay attempt to identify specific\n25 hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success.โ\nId. at 436-37.  The City has attem pted to identify specific hours that it argues should be eliminated,\n26 largely hours attributed to Pl aintiffโs failed attem pts at injunctive relief, and work perform ed in\nconnection with his criminal case.  See Oppโn at 13-14.  But Plaintiff has persuaded the Court that the\n27 latter contributed to Plaintiffโs civil case, and that the form er consisted both of facial and as-applied\nchallenges.  Accordingly, the Court will not eliminate those hours, and instead will reduce Plaintiffโs\n28 award to account for his limited success.   \n9\n\n1 enforcement of an 8-foot bubble was not what Plaintiff sought; indeed, he had asserted that\n2 his style of โsidewalk counselingโ required that he be able to approach closely the people\n3 entering the clinic.  Plaintiff argued to this Court: โIn Plaintiffโs experience, it is virtually\n4 impossible to start up a conversation with someone from eight feet away.โ  Id. at 22.  Even\n5 Plaintiffโs FAC asked for (a) a โjudgment against the defendantโ; (b) โa declaratory judgment\n6 declaring the acts of the defendant to be a violation of plaintiffโs constitutional rights . . .โ;\n7 (c) โa declaratory judgment declaring that [the Ordinance] is unconstitutional on its faceโ; (d)\n8 โa declaratory judgment declaring that [the Ordinance] is unconstitutional as enforced and as\n9 appliedโ; (e) injunctive relief enjoining Defendant โfrom enforcing [the Ordinance]โ; (f) fees\n10 and costs; and (g) โsuch other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.โ \na\nni 11 See FAC at 9.4  In light of Plaintiffโs requests that the Court declare the Ordinance\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 unconstitutional on its face and enjoin it from being enforced altogether, it is disingenuous to\noa\nCC\nct of  13 characterize the scope of the litigation as only involving equal enforcement. \nrict \nstri 14 While a plaintiff need not โreceive all relief requestedโ to receive โa fee award based\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 on all hours reasonably expended if the relief obtained justified that expenditure of attorney\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 time,โ Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435 n.11, here, the relief Plaintiff obtained was significantly\no\nteN\nnie  17 narrower than he sought, and does not entitle Plaintiff to the full lodestar.  Put another way,\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 the ultimate remedy here, a judgment finding that the Defendantโs enforcement policy\nF\n19 violated the First Amendment and directing Defendant to enforce the Ordinance in an\n20 evenhanded manner, is not worth $585,060.88.  That lodestar necessarily includes in it the\n21 time Plaintiff spent arguing that the Ordinance was unconstitutional, not only because of how\n22 Defendant interpreted it, but because it did not comport with Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703\n23 (2000) โ an issue the Ninth Circuit dispensed with fairly easily.5  \n24\n25\n26 4 The Second Am ended Com plaint also prayed that the Court declare the Ordina nce\nunconstitutional on its face and enjoin it from being enforced.  See SAC (dkt. 74) at 9.\n27\n5\n See Hoye, 653 F.3d at 843 (โBecause the Ordinance is modeled on the Colorado statute upheld\n28 in Hill, that opinion controls much of our analysis in this case and leads us to the conclusion that the\nOrdinance is a facially valid restriction on the time, place, and manner of speech.โ).\n10\n\n1 In sum, Plaintiff ended up prevailing on half of his case (his as-applied challenge),\n2 and attaining half of the relief that he sought (evenhanded enforcement of the Ordinance). \n3 To reflect this limited success, the Court will award Plaintiff: (1) half of his fees for his time\n4 billed through the oral argument in the Ninth Circuit, a time period in which Plaintiff pursued\n5 both his facial and as-applied challenges; and (2) all of his fees for his time billed after the\n6 oral argument in the Ninth Circuit, a time period in which the parties and the Court worked\n7 to implement the Ninth Circuitโs remedy as to Plaintiffโs successful as-applied challenge.\n8 At the Courtโs request, Plaintiff submitted, following the motion hearing, a declaration\n9 breaking down his fees so that the Court could understand how much time he billed through\n10 the date of the oral argument, and how much time he billed after that date.  See Millen Decl.\na\nni 11 (dkt. 237).  Plaintiff represents to the Court that he billed $447,582.90 through the date of\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 oral argument, id. at 2, which means that he billed $137,477.98 after that date.  Accordingly,\noa\nCC\nct of  13 the Court will award Plaintiff $223,791.45 for his work through the date of the oral\nrict \nstri 14 argument, and $137,477.98 for the work he billed after that date, for a total of $361,269.43. \nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\nten  15 The total award reflects a reduction that is โmore than a haircut,โ see Moreno, 534 F.3d at\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16 1116, in light of the Courtโs view that Plaintiffโs success was significant, but limited in\no\nteN\nnie  17 relation to the scope of his case as a whole.  \nUh\nt\n \nor 18 IV. CONCLUSION\nF\n19 For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the Motion, and awards Plaintiff fees \n20 of $361,269.43.\n21 IT IS SO ORDERED.\n22\nDated: October 1, 2012                                                             \n23 CHARLES  R.

Abolitionists, suffragists, \nsocialists, pacifists, union members, war protestors, religious \nbelievers,  civil  rights  campaigners,  anti-tax  activists,  and \ncountless  others  have  appealed  to  the  principle,  enshrined \nwithin the  First Amendment,  that in  a democracy such as \nours, public debate must be robust and free and that, for it to \nbe so, the Constitution's protection of the freedom of speech \nmust extend to the sidewalk encounter of the proselytizer and \nhis prospective convert. These instances of public persuasion \nconstitute the lifeblood of a self-governing people's liberty, \n\n9654  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nand so even when the beliefs propagated seem to some the \n\"rankest error\" that \"naturally would offend\" any listener, our \nfounding charter deems such encounters \"in the long view, \nessential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part \nof the citizens ofa democracy.\" Cantwell v.  Connecticut, 310 \nU.S. 296, 309-310 (1940). This case calls on us to apply that \nprinciple. \n**** \nWalter Hoye, a minister, is a so-called \"sidewalk counsel \nor.\" He regularly stands outside a reproductive health clinic \nin the City of Oakland, seeking to engage women in what he \ncalls a \"friendly conversation\" to dissuade them from having \nan abortion. \nConcerned about disruptive anti-abortion protests outside \nclinics, the Oakland City Council enacted a so-called bubble \nordinance (the \"Ordinance\"), its name derived from the 100-\nfoot metaphorical \"bubble\" the Ordinance creates around the \nentrances to reproductive health clinics. Within such zones, \nthe Ordinance makes it an offense knowingly and willfully to \napproach within eight feet of an individual seeking entry to \nthe clinic if one's purpose in approaching that person is to \nengage in conversation, protest, counseling, or various other \nforms of speech. The Ordinance is largely modeled after the \nColorado statute held constitutional in Hill v.  Colorado, 530 \nU.S. 703 (2000).' \nHoye was convicted of two separate violations of the Ordi \nnance. (His convictions were reversed on procedural grounds \nduring the pendency of this appeal.) He now challenges the \nOrdinance in this  ยง 1983  action,  contending that the Ordi \nnance infringes upon the freedom of speech gnaranteed by the \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution. Hoye also \nBoth the Ordinance  and the  Colorado  statute  are reproduced in an \nappendix to this opinion. \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9655 \nargues that the Ordinance violates the federal constitution's \nDue Process Clause, as well as the state and federal guaran \ntees of equal protection of the laws. A theme central to his \nchallenges is his contention that Oakland does not enforce the \nOrdinance evenhandedly, as it has a policy of not enforcing \nthe Ordinance against volunteers who engage in pro-abortion \nspeech outside reproductive health clinics. The District Court \ngranted Oakland's motion for sllmmary judgment on all of \nHoye's claims, and Hoye appealed. We now affirm in part, \nreverse in part, and remand for the determination of appropri \nate relief. \nI. \nA. \nSeveral reproductive healthcare clinics are located within \nthe City of Oakland (the \"City\"). For decades, anti-abortion \nactivists  have  gathered  outside  them,  trying  to  dissuade \npatients from seeking abortions and employees from perform \ning them. Their insistent importuning has caused patients and \nemployees to  feel  harassed,  even intimidated.  Also,  in the \npast,  protestors  have  blocked  entrances  to  clinics,  forcing \npatients and staff to climb through windows and fire escapes. \nProtestors have also sometimes mobbed patients' vehicles as \nthey pull up to the clinic, preventing patients from stepping \nout. \nSince approximately early 2006, Walter Hoye has  stood \noutside the Family Planning  Specialists  clinic  in  Oakland, \nseeking to discourage women entering the clinic from having \nan abortion. Hoye's stated goal is \"to have a personal, one-on \none conversation with each woman concerning her individual \nsituation and what is causing her to consider abortion.\" He \nalso often holds a sign proclaiming, \"Jesus loves you and your \nbaby. Let us help.\" He says that he has \"never called a woman \n\n9656  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \na baby killer or murderer or told her she would rot in hell, or \nexpressed any judgment like that. ,,' \nHoye reports that \"[ fJor most of the time I have been going, \nthere has been only two or three other pro-life people there.\" \nHe also  states that he has never seen a \"pro-life counselor \nblock patients from getting to the [c ]linic\"; instead, he says, \n\"We consciously try to space ourselves out on the sidewalk \n... [and] make sure there is room to pass.\" Video recordings \nof Hoye's activities, although incomplete, corroborate Hoye's \naccount of his sidewalk counseling. \nFor  a  number  of years,  \"escorts\"  have  helped  patients \napproaching reproductive health clinics to navigate their way \ninto the building when anti-abortion protestors are present. \nHoye calls the escorts \"pro-abortion activists.\" Barbara Hoke, \nan escort, provides a slightly different account: According to \nher, escorts are volunteers who, although not \"legally affiliat \ned\" with the clinics, wait outside them, often wearing hright \norange vests bearing the name of the clinic in front of which \nthey are volunteering. \"The escort's job,\" in Hoke's words, \n\"is to create a clear pathway to the clinic so that patients seek \ning to enter the clinic may do so without being intimidated, \nharassed, or feeling physically threatened.\" \nHoye charges that \"[t]hese activist escorts tell women not \nto listen to [him], that he is only there to harass [them], that \n[they]  will  only  be  safe  with  the  escorts,  and  [that  they \nshould] not ... take his literature or information because it is \ninaccurate.\" Hoye also says that escorts, \"with their bodies, \nform  barriers\"  to  prevent  him  from  approaching  patients, \nmake noise (such as \"lalalala\") to drown out Hoye, and have \n\"assign[e d] some of their number to stand in front of [Hoye] \nwith blank pieces of cardboard, thus blocking women from \nseeing [Hoye's] sign.\" The City, by and large, does not con-\n'There is no indication in the record to the contrary, nor any suggestion \nthat Hoye has engaged in any physical obstruction or violence. \n\nHoYE V. CITY OF OAKLAND  9657 \ntest Hoye's account of the escorts' activities. Also, at Hoye's \ncriminal trial, Hoke to a degree confIrmed that account, testi \nfying that she thought it important for escorts ''to block a mes \nsage that is inappropriate, that is meant to harm, is meant to \nintimidate, and meant to prevent a woman from just the quiet \nprivacy of a moment in her life that is no one else's business.\"3 \nOn December 18, 2007, the Oakland City Council passed \nOrdinance No. 12849. Hoye fIled the complaint in this case \nthe next day, asking for a temporary restraining order. At a \ntelephonic hearing  on the  request for  a  TRO,  the District \nCourt expressed reservations about the Ordinance's constitu \ntionality and strongly suggested that the City amend it. The \nCity, acquiescing, adopted an amended ordinance, Ordinance \nNo. 12860, on February 5, 2008. \nSection 3(b) of the Ordinance, as amended, makes it unlaw \nful, within 100 feet of the entrance of a \"reproductive health \ncare facility,\" to \nwillfully and knowingly approach within eight (8) \nfeet of any person seeking to enter such a facility, or \nany occupied motor vehicle seeking entry, without \nthe consent of such person or vehicle occupant, for \nthe purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering \nwith such person or vehicle occupant. \nThe Ordinance then goes on to defIne the three activities it \nregulates-\"counseling,\"  \"harassing,\"  and  \"interfering\" \nquite broadly. \n3The District Court ruled that Barbara Hoke's testimony in Hoye's \ncrinrinal trial \"is hearsay and does not meet the requirements of the fonner \ntestimony exception in Fed. R. Civ. P. 804(b)(1).\" But the City did not \nobject to the evidence. \"Defects in evidence submitted in opposition to a \nmotion for summary judgment are waived absent a motion to strike or \nother objection.\" FDIC v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., 953 F.2d 478, 485-86 \n(9th Cir. 1991) (quotation omitted). \n\n9658  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nWe dwell on the definition of \"counseling,\" as it is instruc \ntive for two reasons. First, the Ordinance defines \"counseling\" \nrelatively expansively: \"Counseling\" means \"engaging in con \nversation with, displaying signs to, and/or distributing litera \nture.\" Ord. ยง 2(e). So, under the Ordinance, within 100 feet of \na clinic, a speaker wishing to engage in conversation with, \ndisplay signs to, or distribute literature to a person entering \nthe  clinic  must  first  obtain  that  person's  consent  before \napproaching within eight feet of that person. \nSecond, the definition of \"counseling\" was one of the sec \ntions of the Ordinance amended at the suggestion of the Dis \ntrict  Court.  Originally,  the  Ordinance  had  defined \n\"counseling\" so as to restrict only \"engaging in conversation \n... displaying signs ... and/or distributing literature ... in \nan effort to harass, intimidate, or persuade the individual not \nto  access  such  reproductive  health  services.\"  (Emphasis \nadded).  Thus,  this  provision,  as  originally  enacted,  was \nexplicitly one-sided: A speaker who attempted to persuade a \nwoman entering a reproductive health clinic to access repro \nductive health services was not \"engaging in conversation\" \nwithin the meaning of the Ordinance. Section (3)(b), the Ordi \nnance's operative provision, reiterated the Ordinance's one \nsided prohibition. It made it a misdemeanor to approach per \nsons without consent for the purpose of counseling, harassing \nor interfering with them \"in connection with seeking repro \nductive health services, or for the purpose of interfering with \nthat person's or vehicle occupant's obtaining or providing \nreproductive health services.\" Ord. ยง 3(b) (emphasis added). \nAt District Judge Breyer's suggestion, the City amended the \nOrdinance to strike all of the language italicized above. As a \nresult, the Ordinance on its face no longer distinguishes in the \nkey  operative  provisions  between  pro-abortion  and  anti \nabortion advocacy. \nOn May 13, 2008, the Oakland Police Department arrested \nHoye and cited him for violating the Ordinance. An Alameda \nCounty jury convicted him, in January, 2009, of two counts \n\nHoYE V. CITY OF OAKLAND  9659 \n(for separate  incidents)  of \"harassment of persons  seeking \nhealth care\" in violation of ยง 3(b) of the Ordinance. Hoye \nappealed his  convictions  to  the  Appellate  Division of the \nsame court, which reversed the convictions on two grounds, \nneither pertinent here. See People v. Hoye, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d \n876,  (Cal.  App.  Super.  Ct.  2010).  Shortly after the parties \nargued this case before us, the district attorney dismissed the \nprosecution against Hoye. \nIn the meantime, in this  federal  action,  the parties  filed \ncross-motions for summary judgment. On August 4, 2009, the \nDistrict Court granted the City's motion in full. \nB. \nOakland's ordinance is not the only legislative attempt to \nfacilitate access to reproductive healthcare facilities by impos \ning special restrictions on speech and conduct in the space \nimmediately outside clinic entrances. See Freedom of Access \nto Clinic Entrances Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 248; California Freedom \nof Access to  Clinic and Church Entrances Act,  Cal.  Penal \nCode ยงยง 423 et seq.;  Cal. Penal Code ยง 602.11. Nor is this \ncase  the  first  to  raise  difficult  questions  concerning  the \naccommodation of women's right to an abortion with anti \nabortion activists' right to free speech. In the last two decades, \nthe  Supreme  Court  has  three  times  addressed  the  First \nAmendment rights of anti-abortion protestors outside repro \nductive healthcare facilities. See Madsen v.  Women's Health \nCtr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994); Schenck v. Pro-Choice Net \nwork of West em New York, 519 U.S. 357 (1997); Hill v. Colo \nrado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000).\" \n\"Since Hill, at least two circuits have decided cases involving so-called \nbubble ordinances and their application to circumstances involving side \nwalk counselors and escorts. See McGuire v. Reilly (McGuire 1),260 F.3d \n36 (1st Cir. 2001) (reversing a grant of a preliminary injunction against a \nstatote's enforcement); McGuire v. Reilly (McGuire Il), 386 F.3d 45 (1st \nCir. 2004) (affirming the district court's decision to uphold the statote on \nthe merits); Brown v.  City of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d 263 (3d Cir. 2009) \n(upholding parts of an ordinance similar to Oakland's, but striking down \nother parts); see also McCullen v. Coakley, 571 F.3d 167 (1st Cir. 2009) \n(upholding amended Massachusetts statute in face of a facial challenge). \n\n9660  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nIn Hill, the third case in this trilogy, the Supreme Court \nupheld, in the face of a First Amendment challenge, a Colo \nrado  statute markedly  similar to the  Ordinance.  See  Colo. \nRev. Stat ยง 18-9-122. The statute, like the Ordinance, created \na buffer zone of 100 feet outside healthcare facilities. Within \nthat  zone,  the  statute  prohibited  knowingly  approaching \nwithin eight feet of another person, without that person's con \nsent, for the purpose of ''passing a leaflet or handbill to, dis \nplaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or \ncounseling\" that person. Id. \nBecause the Ordinance is modeled on the Colorado statute \nupheld in Hill, that opinion controls much of our analysis in \nthis case and leads us to the conclusion that the Ordinance is \na facially valid restriction on the time, place, and manner of \nspeech. But Hill did not concern in any way the activities of \nescorts-that  is,  individuals  engaged  in  counteracting  the \neffect of anti-abortion protestors' speech by facilitating poten \ntial patients' access to clinics. Accordingly, there was no con \ntention in Hill that Colorado enforced its statute only against \nanti-abortion speakers. In contrast, Oakland appears to have \nread into its Ordinance an exception for speech that facilitates \naccess to reproductive health services and so has enforced the \nOrdinance against anti-abortion speakers but not pro-abortion \nspeakers. We conclude that, in doing so, Oakland unconstitu \ntionally suppresses speech based on the content of its mes \nsage. \nFurther, because Hill did not concern activities similar to \nthose of the escorts in this case, the Supreme Court did not \nconsider whether it would be constitutional to apply an ordi \nnance like Oakland's to speakers whose attempts to convey \ntheir message are systematically countered by those opposed \nto that message.  In this  opinion, we take up that question \nbriefly and,  guided by the principle that government must \nconsider the  actual  conditions  speakers  encounter when it \nrestricts their speech, explain that it may be unconstitutional \nto apply the Ordinance to speakers if, under the circumstances \n\nHoYE V. CITY OF OAKLAND  9661 \nsurrounding a particular reproductive health clinic at a partic \nular time, the application of the Ordinance would effectively \nforeclose speakers' ability to co=unicate their message. But \nbecause we would be required to speculate as to prospective \nfacts,  we leave the  determination as to  whether the  Ordi \nnance's  application  to  Hoye  actually  has  that  effect  for \nanother day and a developed record. \nFor these reasons, we affirm the District Court's holding \nthat the Ordinance is facially valid, but reverse the remainder \nof its ruling and remand with instructions to devise appropri \nate relief. \nII. \nBefore turning to the validity of Oakland's bubble ordi \nnance,  we  must  address  an  antecedent  question,  namely, \nwhether we should decide this case at all in light of the ''na \ntional policy forbidding federal courts to stay or enjoin pend \ning  state  court  proceedings  except  under  special \ncircumstances.\" Younger v.  Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 41  (1971); \nsee Columbia Basin Apartment Ass 'n  v.  City of Pasco, 268 \nF.3d 791, 799-800 (9th Cir. 2001). \"The Younger doctrine ... \ncounsels  federal-court  abstention when there  is  a  pending \nstate proceeding.\" Moore v.  Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 423 (1979). \nState criminal proceedings against Hoye were co=enced \nand completed-during the pendency of this federal action.' \nBut the circumstances in which federal courts should decline \nto exercise their jurisdiction \"are carefully defined and remain \nthe exception, not the rule.\" Gilbertson v. Albright, 381 F.3d \n965, 969 n.2 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (quotation omitted). \nWe conclude that this case does not fit into the \"carefully \ndefined\" Younger exception to mandatory federal jurisdiction. \n'Neither party has raised the Younger doctrine, but it \"may be raised sua \nsponte at any time in the appellate process.\" Columbia Basin, 268 F.3d at \n799. That the state court proceedings have now ended is not alone a suffi \ncient reason that Younger does not apply. See Beltran v. California, 871 \nF .2d 777, 782 (9th Cir. 1988). \n\n9662  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nHoye filed this federal case in December, 2007, well before \nthe district attorney filed a criminal complaint in state court \non June 6, 2008. Cf Agriesti v. MGM Grand Hotels, Inc.  53 \nF.3d 1000, 1001 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that when a citation \nhad issued but no charging document had been filed with state \ncourt, ''there [were] no ongoing state judicial proceedings\" for \npurposes of Younger abstention). Still, \"where state criminal \nproceedings are begun against the federal plaintiffs after the \nfederal complaint is filed but before any proceedings of sub \nstance on the merits have taken place in the federal court, the \nprinciples of Younger v. Harris . .. apply in full force.\" Hicks \nv. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 350 (1975). The commencement of \nstate proceedings  only ceases to require  federal  abstention \nafter the federal court proceedings have moved beyond an \n\"embryonic stage.\" Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, \n929 (1975). \nHere, the federal proceedings had begun nearly six months \nbefore the commencement of criminal proceedings in state \ncourt.  By that time,  the District Court had denied Hoye's \nmotion for a temporary restraining order, it had held four sta \ntus conferences and hearings in this case, and the City Coun \ncil had amended the Ordinance in response to  the District \nCourt's expression of its deep reservations about the Ordi \nnance's constitutionality. Thus, by the time state proceedings \nbegan, the federal proceedings had been long pending, and the \nDistrict Court's intervention in the case had resulted in a sig \nnificant change in the relative positions of the parties. We \ntherefore  conclude  that the  federal  proceedings  had prog \nressed beyond an embryonic stage, so that \"considerations of \neconomy,  equity,  and  federalism  counsel  against  Younger \nabstention.\" Hawaii Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 238 \n(1984);  see id.  (concluding that \"a federal  court action in \nwhich a preliminary injunction is granted has proceeded well \nbeyond the  'embryonic  stage' \");  Adultworld Bookstore  v. \nCity ofF resno, 758 F.2d 1348, 1350-51 (9th Cir. 1985) (hold \ning that Younger abstention was not required when state crim \ninal proceedings began after the district court had conducted \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9663 \nan \"extended evidentiary hearing on the question of a prelimi \nnary injunction\" but had not issued the injunction). \nWe therefore tum to consideration of the challenge to Oak \nland's \"bubble ordinance.\" \nIII. \n[I]  In Hill, the Supreme Court held that Colo. Rev.  Stat \nยง 18-9-122(3)  was  facially  constitutional  under  the  time, \nplace, and manner analysis set forth in Ward v. Rock Against \nRacism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989), and Clarkv. Cmty.for Creative \nNon-Violence, 468 U.S.  288 (1984). Hill,  530 U.S.  at 719-\n730. In those two  cases, the Supreme Court explained that \ngovernment may impose restrictions on speech in a public \nforum so long as the restrictions \"[( 1)] are justified without \nreference to the content of the regulated speech, [(2)] ... are \nnarrowly tailored to serve a significant goverrnnental interest, \nand [(3)] ... leave open ample alternative channels for com \nmunication of the information.\" Ward, 491 U.S. at 791 (quot \ning Clark, 468 U.S. at 293). \nThe relevant portions of the Ordinance largely replicate the \nColorado statute the Supreme Court considered in Hill, so our \nanalysis of the Ordinance's facial constitutionality is mostly \ncontrolled by that case.' But the Ordinance does depart from \nthe Colorado statute in some details. We discuss the two most \nimportant such departures but conclude that they are not of \ndecisive significance to the Ordinance's facial constitutional \nity. \nโขH  ill's reasoning, if not always its result, has been criticized by scholars \nof various stripes. See Colloquium, Professor Michael W.  McConnell's \nResponse, 28 Pepp. L. Rev. 747 (2001) (quoting criticisms of Hill by \nProfs. Michael McConnell, Laurence H. Tribe, Erwin Chemerinsky, and \nAkhil Arnar). \n\n9664  HoYE V. CITY OF OAKLAND \nA. \nThe first significant difference between the Ordinance and \nthe Colorado statute is that the Ordinance creates a buffer \nzone only outside of \"reproductive health care facilit[ies],\" \nOrd.  ยง 3(b), although the Colorado statute created a buffer \nzone outside of all health care facilities, including hospitals. \nColo. Rev. Stat ยง 18-9-122(3). In fact, the Ordinance does not \napply to hospitals that provide reproductive health services or \nto reproductive health facilities operated or owned by hospitals.' \nThe Ordinance's preamble suggests that the reasons hospitals, \nand clinics owned or operated by hospitals, are excluded are \nthat \"offices and facilities that have patient stays of shorter \nduration may be more vulnerable ... on account of the layout \nand design of their facilities and parking areas as well as their \nstaff deployment\"  and that  \"the  facilities  with  the  fewest \nresources for providing adequate security . . . are those not \naffiliated with hospitals.\" \nHoye contends that the narrower range of the Ordinance \nshows that it, unlike the statute in Hill, is not content-neutral. \nBut we fail to see how, under Hill, the Ordinance's applica \ntion to a narrower class of healthcare facilities could make it \ncontent-discriminatory. It is true that the Ordinance is more \nclosely targeted to the kinds of facilities where anti-abortion \nactivists are likely to gather. But Hill rejected as \"flawed\" the \n''theory that a statute restricting speech becomes unconstitu \ntionally content-based because of its application to the spe \ncific  locations  where  that  discourse  occurs.\"  ld.  at  724 \n(quotation omitted).  Instead,  the  Supreme  Court explained \nthat the Colorado statute was content-nentral because it \"was \nnot adopted because of disagreement with the message\" of the \n'The Ordinance defines \"a reproductive health facility\" as \"any facility \nthat provides reproductive health services [defined elsewhere to include \ncounseling and informational services1   that is not licensed as a hospital, \nand is not owned, and/or operated by a licensed hospital.\" Ord. ยง 2(b) \n(emphasis added). \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9665 \nspeech it regulates, id. at 719 (quotation omitted), and because \n''the statutory language makes no reference to the content of \nthe [regulated] speech.\" ld.; see id. at 725 (explaining that the \nstatute is content-neutral because it \"is not limited to those \nwho oppose abortion\" and \"it applies to all . . . demonstrators \nwhether or not the demonstration concerns abortion\"); Ward, \n491 U.S. at 791 (\"A regulation that serves purposes unrelated \nto the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has \nan  incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not \nothers.\" (emphasis addedยป; Menotti v.  City of Seattle, 409 \nF.3d 1113, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (\"That Order No.3 predomi \nnantly affected protestors with anti-WTO views did not render \nit content based.\").\" \nFor similar reasons, we cannot fmd a defect of constitu \ntional  proportions  in  the  fact  that the  Ordinance  regulates \napproaching a narrower class of individuals than the Colorado \nstatute.  The  Colorado  statute  imposed  restrictions  on \napproaching anyone within the buffer zone, see Colo. Rev. \nStat.  ยง 18-9-122(3)  (''No person  shall knowingly  approach \nanother person . . . .\" ), while the Ordinance only regulates \nknowingly  approaching  individuals  \"seeking  to  enter\"  the \nreproductive healthcare facility. Ord. ยง 3(b). The only reason \nthat this departure from the Colorado statute might be relevant \nis that it might exacerbate the already disproportionate effect \nthe Colorado statute may well have had on anti-abortion mes \nsages as compared to pro-abortion messages, or to messages \non subjects having nothing to do with abortion. But, again, \nHill instructs that, in regulating speech immediately outside \nreproductive health facilities, disproportionate effect is not of \nOWe need not--and do not-interpret these statements to mean that a \ndisproportionate  effect on  ooe  message  never matters  in determining \nwhether a facially neutral regulation is content-based. It may be that in \nsome circumstances a facially neutral regulation of speech will so dispro \nportionately affect ooe message as to require a court carefully to consider \nthe statute's tenns to be sure that they do not incorporate a subtle content \nbased standard. \n\n9666  HoYE V. CITY OF OAKLAND \ndecisive  significance to  the  content-neutrality  inquiry.  530 \nU.S. at 724-25. \n[2]  In sum, given Hill, neither the fact that the Ordinance \napplies only to speech outside reproductive health care facili \nties, not hospitals generally, nor the fact that it protects only \nthose \"seeking to enter\"  the facilities renders it content-based.\" \nInstead, we look to whether the Ordinance's substantive terms \nare content-based, and to whether the statute was enacted \"be \ncause of disagreement with the message\" of the speech it reg \nulates, Hill, 530 U.S. at 719 (quotation omitted), to determine \nwhether it is content-neutral. \nB. \nHoye does not contend that the statute was enacted because \nof substantive disagreement with the message of the speech it \nregulates, nor does the record contain any evidence that it \nwas.  We  must therefore  examine whether the  Ordinance's \nsubstantive terms make facial distinctions between categories \nof speech based on content. \n[3]  We begin again with a comparison with Hill, to see \nwhether there are any differences that would render the Ordi \nnance, but not the Colorado statute, content-based. The Ordi \nnance  does  regulate  slightly different categories  of speech \nthan  the  Colorado  statute  in  Hill.  The  Colorado  statute \nrestricted  approaching  another  person \"for the  purpose  of \npassing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engag \ning in oral protest, education, or counseling with\" that person. \nColo.  Rev.  Stat.  ยง 18-9-122(3).  The  Ordinance  restricts \napproaching others \"for the purpose of counseling, harassing, \n\"That the Ordinance's restriction on speech is limited to fewer locations \nthan the Colorado statute does not make it more vulnerable to constitu \ntional  challenge at the  narrow-tailoring  or ample  alternative  channels \nstages of the time, place, and, manner inquiry. If anything, the opposite \nwould appear to be true, as more locations remain available to the speaker. \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9667 \nor  interfering  with\"  them,  ยง Ord.  3(b),  and  then  defines \n\"counseling,\" \"harassing,\" and \"interfering\" so as to incorpo \nrate the same expressive activities restricted by the Colorado \nstatute. See Ord. ยง ยง 2(c ) , (d) &  (e). But the Ordinance then \ndescribes in a new way the regulated category of speech: The \nOrdinance's definition of \"counseling\" includes \"engaging in \nconversation,\" Ord. ยง 2(e ), a category of speech not expressly \nrestricted by the Colorado statute. Hoye makes no argument \nthat this additional language in the Ordinance marks a deci \nsive difference from the Colorado statute for purposes of the \ntime, place, and manner inquiry. We do not see how it could. \n[4]  For one thing, the Colorado statute explicitly restricted \n\"counseling\" and \"education,\" which are largely co-extensive \nwith \"engaging in conversation,\"  especially in the circum \nstances to which the Ordinance applies.  More importantly, \nHill instructed that, when analyzing the face of a statute to \ndetermine  its  content-neutrality,  the  relevant  question  is \nwhether the statute draws distinctions among subjects of dis \ncussion, not among means or types of communication. 530 \nU.S. at 723. Oakland's addition of an express restriction on \n\"engaging in conversation\" in no way changes the fact that it, \nlike the Colorado statute, \"applies equally to used car sales \nmen,  animal  rights  activists,  fundraisers,  environmentalists \nand missionaries.\" ld. Hill therefore requires that we deem the \naddition of the \"engaging in conversation\" language immate \nrial to the Ordinance's facial content-neutrality. \nThe  \"engaging in conversation\"  language  also  does  not \nmeaningfully affect the narrow-tailoring and ample alternative \nchannels of communication tests as those tests were applied \nby Hill. Hill concluded that the Colorado statute passed both \nthese  inqniries  insofar  as  the  spoken  word  is  concerned \nbecause courts \"must accord a measure of deference to the \njudgment of the ... [l]egislature\" as to whether ''the 8-foot \ninterval is the best possible accommodation of the competing \ninterests at stake,\" id.  at 727, and because the statute might \n\"assist[]  speakers'  efforts  to  communicate  their messages \n\n9668  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \n[by] encourag[ing] the most aggressive and vociferous prote \nstors to moderate their confrontational and harassing conduct, \nand thereby make  it easier for  thoughtful and  law-abiding \nsidewalk counselors ... to make themselves heard.\" Id.  That \nanalysis  remains  unaltered  by  Oakland's  addition  of the \nphrase \"engaging in conversation\" to the Ordinance. \nC. \nAside from pointing to differences between the text of the \nColorado statute and that of the Ordinance, Hoye makes two \nadditional  attempts  to  explain why Hill is  not fatal  to  his \nfacial challenge to the Ordinance. Neither is persuasive. \nHoye's first such argument is more an attempt to reargue \nHill than to distinguish it. He contends that the Ordinance is \nnot content-neutral because it distinguishes between demon \nstrators' speech and \"panhandling, solicitation and vending.\" \nNone of the latter types of speech is expressly restricted by \nthe Ordinance, even though they are expressive activities that \nraise similar concerns about ''nuisance, the persistent impor \ntuning, the following, the dogging, and the implied threat of \nphysical touching\" as demonstrators' speech. Id. at 724. \nThe obvious flaw in this argument is that the Colorado stat \nute upheld in Hill did not in terms prohibit panhandling, solic \nitation,  or vending either.  The  Supreme  Court nonetheless \nheld that the Colorado statute \"does not distinguish among \nspeech instances that are similarly likely to raise the legiti \nmate concerns to which it responds.\" Id.  Hoye suggests, in \neffect,  that  Hill  made  a  conditioned  finding  of content \nneutrality  (i.e.,  the  statute  was  content-neutral  as  between \n\"protest,  education  and  counseling\"  and  \"casual  conversa \ntion,\" see id. at 721-22), but possibly not as between protest \nand panhandling.  Nothing  in Hill suggests  such  a  limited \nholding. \nHoye's second argument approaches one that we ultimately \nfind persuasive as an aspect of the selective enforcement con-\n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9669 \nsidered later, but it is not properly part of a facial challenge. \nAs Hoye points out, in Forsyth County v. Nationalist Move \nment, the Supreme Court stated that \"[i]n evaluating respon \ndent's  facial  challenge,  we  must  consider  the  county's \nauthoritative constructions of the ordinance, including its own \nimplementation and interpretation of it.\" 505 U.S.  123, 131 \n(1992). Hoye argues that this principle requires us to consider \nOakland's enforcement practices in addressing his facial chal \nlenge. We disagree. \nThe Supreme Court followed its statement in Forsyth with \nthree citations. All three are to portions of cases in which the \nSupreme Court used the past practice of a statute's implemen \ntation to narrow the statute to save it in the face of a vague \nness  challenge.  See  Ward,  491  U.S.  at  795-796;  City  of \nLakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ'g Co., 486 U.S. 750, 770 n.11 \n(1988);  Gooding v.  Wilson,  405  U.S.  518,  524-28  (1972). \nHoye points to no instance in which a court has used evidence \nof a statute's implementation to make it more facially vulner \nable. Cf McGuire II, 386 F.3d at 58 (\"Logically, there is no \nway  (save  perhaps  when  overbreadth  is  an  issue)  that  an \nauthority's non-binding  and non-authoritative  interpretation \nof a facially valid statute can make it more facially constitu \ntionally  vulnerable  than  it  would  be  otherwise.\").'o  Thus, \nalthough it is  true that where \"a well-understood and uni \nformly applied practice has developed that has virtually the \nforce of a judicial construction,\" City ofL  akewood, 486 U.S. \nat 770 n.ll, courts may consider that executive practice for \n'ยฐIt \nis conceivable that an enforcement policy, even an unwritten one, \ncould be inseparable from the statute or ordinance, so that the constitution \nality of the statute or ordinance may depend on the constitutionality of the \nunwritten policy. See. e.g., Virginia v. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 121 (2003) \n(considering the constitutionality of a written policy and an unwritten \nexception together because the Virginia Supreme Court had decided the \ntwo were not severable). Whether state laws are severable is, of course, a \nmatter of state law. See id. We have no reason to think that California \ncourts would find Oakland's unwritten implementation policy inseparable \nfrom the Ordinance as written. \n\n9670  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \npurposes of a facial challenge, they may do so only to save \na statute, not to condemn an otherwise valid one for being \ncontent-based. \nIllustrative of this  distinction is Santa Monica Food Not \nBombs v.  Santa Monica, 450 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2006). In \nthat case, we considered a written implementation instruction \nas  an authoritative interpretation of a city ordinance, id.  at \n1035, and determined that the instruction provided an \"ade \nquate limiting construction\" on certain provisions of the ordi \nnance. Id.  at 1042. At the same time, we concluded that the \ninstruction \"fatally underminer d]\" a different provision of the \nordinance, but specifically held that the ordinance \"as imple \nmented by the Instruction . .. cannot be enforced,\" while not \ning that the ordinance itself \"passes constitutional muster,\" \nand so could be enforced if implemented in a different man \nner. Id. at 1043. \nThis practice---relying on enforcement policies to save a \nstatute from a facial challenge but not to invalidate a statute \nthat is valid as written but not as enforced-is consistent with \n''the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted \nto  avoid constitutional  difficulties.\" Frisby  v.  Schultz,  487 \nU.S. 474, 483 (1988). Moreover, it would make little sense to \ninvalidate a statute that is constitutional as written when only \nits implementation is defective. Doing so would only require \nlegislative bodies to undertake the pointless exercise of re \nenacting laws that were perfectly valid as enacted on the first \ngo around. \nHoye's evidence of Oakland's implementation of the Ordi \nnance therefore cannot alter our conclusion that the Ordinance \nwithstands  Hoye's  facial  challenge.  Nonetheless,  Hoye's \nappeal to the City's enforcement practices is otherwise rele \nvant. We understand Hoye to argue that the City enforces the \nOrdinance in a content-discriminatory manner, or-much the \nsame point-that the rule that the City actually enforces, dis \ntinct  from  the  Ordinance,  is  content  discriminatory  and \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9671 \nunconstitutional. It is to these essentially similar possibilities \nthat we now turn.\" \nIV. \nWe  agree  with Hoye  that there  are  grave  constitutional \nproblems with the manner in which the City has understood \nand enforced its Ordinance. In considering the City's enforce \nment and application of the Ordinance, we follow an analysis \nthat  is  precise  and  technical,  perhaps  regrettably  so.  But \n\"Hoye's allegations of vagueness need not detain us. Hoye contends \nthat the Ordinance's use of the terms \"approach\" and \"consent\" are imper \nmissibly vague. But the Ordinance uses these terms in precisely the same \nmanner as the Colorado statute. See Hill, 530 U.S. at 732-33. The Ordi \nnance cannot therefore be vague in these respects for the same reasons tbat \nHill held the Colorado statute not to be vague. See id. \nTo distinguish Hill,  Hoye argues tbat the Ordinance only makes it \nunlawful to \"willfully and knowingly approach within eight (8) feet of any \nperson seeking to enter' a reproductive healthcare facility, Ord. ยง 3(h), not \nto approach a person exiting a healthcare facility.  Hoye appears to be \nright: while the statote elsewhere refers to individuals exiting clinics, see \nOrd. ยงยง 2(d), (e) & (t), it does not in fact make it an offense to approach \na person exiting the clinic. This omission is likely the result of a failure \nof legislative draftsmanship. But that the City thinks the Ordinance, as \ncurrently written, covers individuals leaving the clinics does not render the \nstatote vague; the text is perfectly clear. An individual prosecuted by the \nCity for counseling someone exiting the clinic would have a good defeuse, \nbut that defeuse would lie in the Ordinance's text, not in the vagueness \ndoctrine. \nHoye also observes tbat the statute restricts approaching \"any occupied \nmotor vehicle seeking entry\" to a reproductive healthcare facility; he won \nders \"how long is [a vehicle] considered to be 'seeking entry' versus being \nsimply parked at the curb?\" Despite Hoye's protests to the contrary, this \nquibble amounts to pettifoggery. The only plausible reading of the Ordi \nnance is tbat a vehicle is seeking entry so long as one of its occupants is \nseeking entry to the clinic. Unoccupied parked cars do not count. The \nOrdinance provides any person \"of ordinary intelligence a reasonable \nopportonity to understand what conduct irs] prohibited.\" Hill, 530 U.S. at \n732; see id. at 733 (dismissing plaintiffs' vagueness challenge as involving \nno more than \"hypertechnical theories as to what the statute covers''). \n\n9672  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nbeneath the doctrinal intricacies lie two simple principles: that \ngovemment may not favor speakers on one side of a public \ndebate, and that government must not substantially foreclose, \nas a practical matter, speakers' ability to communicate their \nmessage. \nA. \nHoye's challenge to Oakland's enforcement of the Ordi \nnance relies primarily on three pieces of evidence concerning \nthe City's enforcement policy: an Oakland Police Department \ntraining video, a Police Department training bulletin, and the \ndeposition of an Oakland Police Department captain pursuant \nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). The Oakland Police Department \ntraining materials outline the Ordinance in vague terms that \ndo not deviate in any substantial way from the Ordinance \nitself, which we have held is facially constitutional. Captain \nToribio's deposition, quoted at length below, is more trou \nbling as it suggests a fum policy of enforcing the Ordinance \nessentially as it was written before being amended-that is, as \napplying  only  to  efforts  to  persuade  women  approaching \nreproductive health clinics not to receive abortions or other \nreproductive health services, and not to communications seek \ning to encourage entry into the clinic for the purpose of under \ngoing treatment. That account is fully corroborated by-and \nwe find  dispositive----Oakland' s  admissions throughout this \nlitigation that it understands and enforces the Ordinance in a \ncontent-discriminatory manner. \nIn response to Hoye's notice of deposition pursuant to Fed. \nR.  Civ.  P.  30(b)(6),  Oakland produced Police  Department \nCaptain Toribio as the person most knowledgeable of Oak \nland's  \"policies,  procedure,  and  interpretations  relating  to \nenforcement\" of the Ordinance. Captain Toribio testified that \n\"the City's enforcement policy is not to enforce the Bubble \nOrdinance against escorts acting as escorts.\" By this, Toribio \napparently meant that the City does not enforce the Ordinance \nin such a  manner as to  require  escorts to  receive  consent \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9673 \nbefore approaching patients to engage in speech with them. \nToribio's further testimony confirms this interpretation: \nQ. Now, if [an1   officer . . . informs you that [an1   \nescort had approached a woman within eight feet, \nwithout her consent,  and said \"Don't listen to  the \ndemonstrators,\"  would that be considered to  be  a \nviolation of the ordinance or not? \nTHE WITNESS: Our policy is clear in what it says. \nA comment like that is not harassment or intimi \ndating.  It is  language used to  help  facilitate  their \nentrance into the facility or maybe even their exit. \nQ. If an escort were to say, \"Don't take those leaflets \nthey're going to try to hand to you,\" would that be \nconsidered a violation? \nTHE WITNESS: No. \nQ. If an escort were to say \"Those leaflets have inac \ncurate information in them, \" would that be consid \nered a violation?\" \nA.No. \nQ. If an escort were to say, \"It's your right to have \nan abortion,\" would that be considered a violation? \nA. Our policy is clear. That would not be a violation \nof the policy. \nQ. And, again, I'm sorry. I may have taken a short \ncut here in each one of these hypotheticals. \nI'm meaning  an  escort approaches  within eight \nfeet of a patient seeking to enter the facility without \nthe  patient's  consent.  And,  again,  that  does  not \nchange your answer, that these escorts saying these \n\n9674  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nthings is not a violation of the ordinance? \nA. Correct. \n12 \nAt oral  argument,  the City  confirmed that it would not \nenforce the Ordinance against an escort who approached a \npatient, without consent, and said, \"May I help you into the \nclinic?\" but that it would enforce it against a sidewalk coun \nselor who said, \"May I talk to you about alternatives to the \nclinic?\" The City explained its position as being that speech \nthat \"facilitates access\" to the clinic does not trigger the Ordi \nnance's consent requirement, while speech that does not facil \nitate access does trigger it.\" \n12The District Court ruled that many of the above questions were prop \nerly objected to as calling for speculation, and that Toribio's answers did \nnot establish ''that escorts make such statements, or that police tum a blind \neye to them.\" But Toribio's answers were not speculative; instead, they \nsimply stated, with some certainty, what the City's enforcement policy is. \nMoreover, all of the questions were asked in an attempt to ascertain the \nCity's enforcement policy. In a sense, questions about a general policy are, \nby their very nature, always hypothetical: a policy provides what officers \nshould do under certain hypothetical circumstsnces. We would be setting \nan impossibly high bar for plaintiffs if we were to require them to estab \nlish a municipality's policy and then to exclude as inadmissible a responsi \nble police official's testimony as to what the municipality's policy is. \n\"At times, the City has seemingly formulated its position as being that \nspeech that is incidental to facilitating access is not covered by the Ordi \nnance. In distinguishing between incidental and purposive speech, we take \nOakland to be arguing that there is a basis in the Ordinance to distinguish \nbetween escorts' speech and Hoye's speech because the Ordinance ouly \nrestricts approaching \"for the purpose\" of engaging in various forms of \ncommunicative activity. The contention is that escorts acting as escorts do \nnot approach patients for the purpose of engaging in the relevant forms of \ncommunicative activity; they approach for the purpose of guiding women \ninto the clinic. \nBut Oakland's reliance on the Ordinance's \"for the purpose of' lan \nguage must be evenhanded if it is to be persuasive (or, for that matter, con \nstitutional). If the escorts' speech does not violate the Ordinance because \nit is incidental to some non-communicative goal, then Hoye's speech \ncould similarly be characterized as  incidental to his  goal of keeping \nwomen from entering the clinic and aborting their fetuses. Yet the City \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9675 \nOn  the  face  of the  Ordinance,  there  is  no  distinction \nbetween speech facilitating  access  and speech that inhibits \naccess. Of course, that distinction used to  exist.  The Ordi \nnance, as originally enacted, singled out speech made \"in an \neffort to harass, intimidate, or persuade the individual not to \naccess  such  reproductive  health  services,\"  Ord.  ยง 2(f ) \n(emphasis added) and \"for the purpose of interfering with [a] \nperson's ... obtaining or providing reproductive health ser \nvices.\" Ord. ยง 3(b). After the hearing on the application for a \ntemporary  restraining  order,  the  City,  at  District  Judge \nBreyer's suggestion, amended the Ordinance to remove the \nquoted language from the Ordinance's text. But, as Captain \nToribio's deposition and the City's representations at argu \nment make clear, the City continues to enforce the Ordinance \nas if the distinction remained. Embracing that distinction as \nthe fulcrum of an enforcement policy, even for a facially valid \nenactment, is inconsistent with the First Amendment. We first \nexplain why that is so, and then we consider the practical \nimplications of the City's decision to read an unconstitutional \ndistinction into a facially valid ordinance. \nB. \nThe  City's policy of distinguishing between speech that \nfacilitates access to clinics and speech that discourages access \nis not content-neutral. It is the epitome of a  content-based \nspeech restriction. \"A regulation is content-based if ... the \nregulation, by its very terms, singles out particular content for \ndifferential treatment.\" Berger v.  City of Seattle,  569 F.3d \n1029,  1051  (9th  CiT.  2009)  (en banc)  (quotation omitted). \n\"[T]he fundamental principle behind content analysis is that \nclearly does not understand the Ordinance to exempt Hoye's speech. In \nany case, even if the distinction between purposive and incidental speech \ncould coherently be made, we have said that privileging the latter over the \nformer ''turns the First Amendment on its head.\" Foti v.  City of Menlo \nPark, 146 F.3d 629, 639 (9th Cir. 1998). \n\n9676  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \ngovernment may not grant the use of a forum to people whose \nviews it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to \nexpress less favored or more controversial views.\" Menotti, \n409 F.3d at 1128 (quotation omitted); see also Rosenberger \nv.  Rector &  Visitors of the Univ.  of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, \n829 (\"Viewpoint discrimination is ... an egregious form of \ncontent discrimination''). In Hill, the Supreme Court reiterated \nthese principles, holding that Colo. Rev. Stat. ยง 18-9-122 was \ncontent-neutral because it applies \"to all protest, to all coun \nseling, and to all demonstrators whether or not the demonstra \ntion concerns abortion, and whether they oppose or support \nthe woman who has made an abortion decision.\" 530 U.S. at \n725 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). \"That is the level \nof neutrality that the Constitution demands.\" ld. \n[5]  The City's enforcement policy does not meet this level \nof neutrality.  To  distinguish  between  speech  facilitating \naccess and speech that discourages access is necessarily to \ndistinguish  on the  basis  of substantive  content.  Asking  a \nwoman \"May I help you into the clinic?\" facilitates access; \n\"May I talk to you about alternatives to abortion?\" discour \nages it. Telling a woman, \"It's your right to have an abor \ntion!\" facilitates access; telling her, \"If you have an abortion, \nyou will regret it!\" discourages it.  Here, the City has con \nceded, both at oral argument and through Captain Toribio's \ndeposition, that its policy is to permit speech on one side of \na controversial public debate, but not on the other. The City's \nimplementation and enforcement of the Ordinance is therefore \nindubitably content-based. \nPossibly the City reads Hill as authorizing the government \nto regulate speech so as to protect patients from any speech \nthat offends their dignity or privacy, even if the offense stems \nnot from the manner of speech but from the words that are \nspoken. Protecting privacy and dignity will often require dis \ntinctions between content: \"You're a babykiller!\" offends a \nwoman's dignity and privacy; \"It's your right to have an abor \ntion!\" often will not. \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9677 \nIn some cases, government regulation of speech with the \naim of protecting the dignity and privacy of individuals has \nbeen permitted. See, e.g., Frisby, 487 U.S. at 484-87 (describ \ning ''the State's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquil \nity,  and privacy of the  home\" and permitting the  State to \n\"prohibit offensive speech [that is] intrusive\" on that privacy \n(quotation omitted)); cf Berger, 569 F.3d at 1054 (observing \nthat the State may, in some cases, restrict speech to protect \n\"the psychological [and] physical well-being of the [hospital] \npatient held  'captive'  by medical circumstance\").  But such \ncases do  not sanction content-based restrictions.  They only \naccept  the  dignity  and  privacy  rationale  as  a  sufficiently \nstrong governmental interest to justify a content-neutral time, \nplace, and manner restriction. \nAs the Supreme Court has recently explained, whether the \nState  may  regulate  speech because  of its  offensive  nature \n\"turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private \nconcern.\" Snyder v.  Phelps,  131  S.Ct.  1207,  1215 (2011).14 \nRegulations of speech in public fora on matters of public con \ncern  directed  at  others  within  the  public  forum  must  be \ncontent-neutral or survive strict scrutiny. \"It is firmly settled \nthat under our Constitution the public expression of ideas may \nnot be prohibited merely because the  ideas are themselves \noffensive to some of their hearers.\" Street v.  New York, 394 \nU.S.  576,  592  (1969)  (emphasis  added);  see Schenck,  519 \nU.S. at 383 (explaining that \"[a]s a general matter, we have \nindicated that in public debate our own citizens must tolerate \n14For example, the First Amendment does not necessarily require a \nshowing of actual malice by all plaintiffs seeking to recover for the torts \nof outrage or intentional infliction of emotional distress, but it does require \nthat showing of plaintiffs who are \"public figures and public officials.\" \nHustler Magazine v. Fallwell, 485 U.s. 46, 55 (1988). \"Deciding whether \nspeech is of public or private concern requires [a court] to examine the \ncontent,  form,  and context of that  speech,  as  revealed by the whole \nrecord.\" Snyder, 131 S.Ct. at 1216 (quotation omitted). But there can be \nno doubt that speech in a public forum on a controversial public matter \ndirected at others within the public forum is speech of public concern. \n\n9678  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \ninsulting,  and  even  outrageous,  speech\"  (emphasis  added) \n(quotation omittedยป; Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 322 (1988) \n(holding a regulation imposing a dignity standard on public \nspeech inconsistent with the First Amendment); Cantwell v. \nConnecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309 (1940) (protecting religious \nand political speech on a sidewalk even though it \"naturally \nwould offend ... all ... who respect the honestly held reli \ngious faith of their fellows\"); see generally Robert C.  Post, \nThe Constitutional Concept of Public Discourse: Outrageous \nOpinion, Democratic Deliberation, and Hustler Magazine v. \nFalwell,  103  Harv.  L. Rev.  601  (1990)  (arguing that First \nAmendment  doctrine  prohibits  the  enforcement  of rules \nimposing norms of civility and dignity on public discourse). \nIf Hill  had  upheld  the  Colorado  statute  as  permissible \nbecause the sidewalk counselors' speech directed at patients \nseeking reproductive health services was not speech of public \nconcern or because those patients were not truly engaged in \npublic debate, an effort by the City to \"facilitate access\" by \nregulating offensive speech might come closer to passing con \nstitutional muster. But while a few passages in Hill might sug \ngest  otherwise,  see  530  U.S.  at  716  (noting  that  \"[t]he \nrecognizable privacy interest in avoiding unwanted communi \ncation varies widely in different settings\"), the Supreme Court \nultimately upheld the Colorado statute because it determined \nthe statute to be content-neutral, not because it held that the \nState could legitimately protect listeners from speech that was \noffensive only because of the words spoken. Nothing in Hill \nundermines the bedrock principle that regulations of public \nspeech designed to protect listeners in public fora from sub \nstantively offensive  speech are fundamentally  incompatible \nwith  content-neutrality.  Oakland's  enforcement  policy  is \ntherefore a content-based regulation of speech. \n[6]  \"Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.\" \nR.A. V.  v.  City  of St.  Paul,  505  U.S.  377,  382  (1992).  A \ncontent-based regulation of public speech is only permissible \nif \"it serves  a compelling government interest in the least \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9679 \nrestrictive manner possible.\" Berger, 569 F.3d at 1052. The \nCity has made no argument that its policy of enforcing the \nOrdinance can survive such strict scrutiny. Indeed, no persua \nsive such argument can be made. While ensuring access to \nwomen's health care may well be a sufficiently compelling \nstate  interest  for  purposes  of strict  scrutiny,  the  City's \nenforcement policy is not the least restrictive means of pursu \ning that interest. \"The existence of adequate content-neutral \nalternatives  . . . undercuts  significantly any  defense\"  of a \nv., \ncontent-based regulation of speech. R.A.  505 U.S. at 395 \n(quotation omitted). Enforcing the Ordinance as written, that \nis, as also applying to speech that encourages patients to enter \nthe clinic, is a content-neutral altemative that is less inimical \nto the values at the heart of the First Amendment than the \nCity's current policy of exempting such speech. The City has \nnot made any attempt to show that exempting speech facilitat \ning access from the Ordinance's strictures furthers the City's \nstated goal  of providing access  to  reproductive health ser \nvices, let alone to the degree that would allow us to conclude \nthat the enforcement policy is the least restrictive means of \nensuring access to reproductive health services. We therefore \ncannot  conclude  that  the  Ordinance,  as  understood  and \nenforced by the City, is one of those \"rare ... regulation[s] \nrestricting speech because of its content\" that is nonetheless \npermissible. United States v.  Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc., 529 \nU.S. 803, 818 (2000). \nC. \nThe apparent divergence in our two conclusions-that Oak \nland's bubble ordinance is facially constitutional but that the \nCity interprets and enforces the Ordinance in an impermiss \nibly content-based manner-is not unprecedented. In Menotti, \nfor  example,  we  concluded that Seattle's Civil Emergency \nOrder  No.  3  was  a  constitutional  time-place-and-manner \nrestriction on its face, 409 F .3d at 1142, but remanded for a \ntrial on whether \"it was the policy of the City to apply Order \nNo.3 in a manner that excluded only anti-WTO protestors.\" \n\n9680  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nId. at 1148. Courts must be willing to entertain the possibility \nthat  content-neutral  enactments  are  enforced in  a  content \ndiscriminatory manner.  If they were not, the First Amend \nment's guarantees would risk becoming an empty formality, \nas government could enact regulations on speech written in a \ncontent-neutral manner so as to withstand judicial scrutiny, \nbut then proceed to  ignore  the  regulations'  content-neutral \nterms by adopting a content-discriminatory enforcement pol \nicy. \nWhile courts must undoubtedly make doctrinal space for \nchallenges  to  the  content-discriminatory  enforcement  of \ncontent-neutral rules, it is not clear into which precise cate \ngory of constitutional claims such challenges fit.  See,  e.g., \nThomas  v.  Chicago  Park Dist.,  534 U.S.  316,  325  (2002) \n(observing,  without  elaboration,  that  a  pattern  of denying \nwaivers to disfavored speakers under an otherwise valid stat \nute \"would of course be unconstitutional\"). The First Circuit \nhas considered a challenge to a Massachusetts statute, similar \nto the Ordinance in many respects, that regulated speech in \nthe space outside of clinics in which escorts and anti-abortion \nprotestors were present. See McGuire 1,260 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. \n2001) (reversing grant of preliminary injunction); McGuire II, \n386 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2004) (affIrming denial of permanent \ninjunction).  The  McGuire  cases  upheld  the  Massachusetts \nstatute  as  facially  valid,  McGuire  I,  260  F.3d  at  43-50; \nMcGuire II, 386 F.3d at 56-69, and also rejected a challenge \nto the Commonwealth's enforcement of the statute, McGuire \nII, 386 F.3d at 59-65, classifying the selective enforcement \nchallenge as an \"as-applied\" attack. Although we ultimately \ndepart from its reasoning in some respects, we find the First \nCircuit's discussion of that \"as-applied\" challenge instructive. \nThe First Circuit explained that, in its view, \"there are dif \nferent types of as-applied attacks.\" McGuire II, 386 F.3d at \n61; see also Brown, 586 F.3d at 289 (also considering \"two \ntypes of as-applied challenges\" to a bubble ordinance). While \nthe \"paradigmatic\" type of as-applied challenge is one that \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9681 \n\"tests\" a statute's \"constitutionality in one particular fact situ \nation while refusing to adjudicate the constitutionality of the \nlaw in other fact situations,\" the First Circuit concluded that \nthe sidewalk counselors must be making an as-applied chal \nlenge \"of a different sort.\" McGuire II,  386 F.3d at 61. It \nexplained that this second kind of as-applied challenge ''must \nbe based on the idea that the law itself is neutral and constitu \ntional in all fact situations, but that it has been enforced selec \ntively in a viewpoint discriminatory way.\" Id.  at 62. \"Such a \nchallenge,\" it explained, \"is dependent on the factual evidence \nprovided as to how the statutory scheme has in fact operated \nvis-a-vis the plaintiffs.\" Id.  The First Circuit then concluded \nthat \"some showing of intent on the part of government offi \ncials probably is necessary to make out\" the second kind of \nas-applied First Amendment claim, id. at 63, before ultimately \ndetermining that there was no such evidence in the record. Id. \nat 65. \nOur Circuit has taken a slightly different path. The First \nCircuit's \"second\" kind of as-applied challenge is essentially \na selective enforcement claim that adopts the framework of \nYick  Wo  v.  Hopkins,  118  U.S.  356  (1886),  but substitutes \n\"speech  content\"  for  one  of the  more  familiar  protected \nclasses, such as ''race'' or \"national origin.\" We have made \nclear that such a claim is available, but have usually not cate \ngorized  it  as  an  \"as-applied\" First Amendment  challenge. \nInstead, we have generally classified such challenges as selec \ntive enforcement equal protection claims. See Foti, 146 F.3d \nat 635 (distinguishing between a selective enforcement claim \nand an as-applied challenge and noting that the latter \"does \nnot implicate the enforcement of the law against third par \nties\";  also  observing  that  \"[i]nadequate  evidence  of .  .  . \nalleged discriminatory enforcement of the ordinance does not \ndefeat [an] as-applied challenge\"); Vlasak v.  Superior Court \nex reI.  County of Los Angeles, 329 F.3d 683, 690 (9th Cir. \n2003) (explaining that the petitioner's \"as-applied challenge \nappears to conflate her argument that the ordinance is uncon \nstitutional  as  specifically  applied to  her and her claim  of \n\n9682  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nselective prosecution\"); Rosenbaum v.  City and Cnty. of San \nFrancisco, 484 F.3d 1142, 1152-57 (9th Cir. 2007) (consider \ning a viewpoint discrimination claim as a selective enforce \nment  claim  under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause);  but  cf \nMenotti, 409 F.3d at 1146-47 (referring to a selective enforce \nment challenge as an \"as-applied\" challenge). \nAny difference between these two approaches is, at least in \nthis  case,  semantic rather than substantive. Under both the \nFirst Circuit's \"as-applied\" approach and our standard \"selec \ntive  enforcement\"  approach,  a  plaintiff must  show  that  a \nmunicipality's content-discriminatory enforcement of an ordi \nnance is the result of an intentional policy or practice. See \nMcGuire II,  386  F.3d at 63-64;  Brown,  586  F.3d at 292; \nRosenbaum, 484 F.3d at 1155; Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1147. \nBecause both the First Circuit's \"as-applied\" approach and \nour  Circuit's  selective-enforcement  approach  require  that \nsome official policy have caused the content-discriminatory \nenforcement, both approaches converge with a third analytical \nframework: namely, a facial challenge to the city's enforce \nment policy (as distinct from a facial challenge to the legisla \ntive  enactment  as  written).  Under  both  the  First  Circuit \napproach and the selective enforcement approach, plaintiffs \nare generally required to show the existence of an unconstitu \ntional policy by extrapolating from a series of enforcement \nactions. They must argue, in effect, that these actions demon \nstrate that the municipality is enforcing against them a rule \nthat is distinct from the constitutionally valid enactment. In \nother words, they \"attack[]  [a n]  unwritten policy as mani \nfested in the [municipality's] application of its written [ordi \nnance].\" Tipton v. Univ. ofH  awaii, 15 F.3d 922,927 (9th Cir. \n1994). Logically speaking, \"[s]uch an attack bears much in \ncommon with a facial challenge on written policy.\" ld.  The \nprimary-indeed, perhaps only-difference is an evidentiary \none. Plaintiffs have no difficulty establishing what a policy is \nwhen the policy is written. An unwritten policy, by contrast, \nis usually harder to establish. Often, the only way to establish \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9683 \nwhether such a policy exists is to extrapolate from enforce \nment data, in many cases a formidable task. \nBut that is not so in this case. Here, unlike in McGuire II \nor any of the other cited authorities, the plaintiffs do not need \nto extrapolate from concrete enforcement actions to determine \nwhether the government has a policy of enforcing the neutral \nwritten rule in a content-discriminatory manner. Instead, the \nCity's own pronouncements defmitively articulate a content \ndiscriminatory enforcement policy. As a result, the three ana \nlytical approaches-the First Circuit's \"second kind\" of as \napplied challenge, our Circuit's \"selective enforcement\" chal \nlenge, and a facial attack on an unwritten rule----converge in \nall respects. Oakland has acknowledged having a policy of \nenforcing the Ordinance based on the content of speech. That \npolicy is unconstitutional, no matter the analytical approach \ntaken.'s \nD. \n[7]  Although the circumstances of this case do not require \nus to choose the applicable doctrinal category, they do present \na remedial puzzle. Oakland insists that it has no enforcement \npolicy distinct from the Ordinance. Although we have no rea \nson to doubt that Oakland's content-based interpretation of \nthe Ordinance is made in good-faith, we reject that interpreta \ntion as a plausible reading of the Ordinance; indeed, if we did \nnot, we would have to declare the Ordinance facially invalid \nunder Hill.'ยท In our view, Oakland is instead enforcing a dif-\n'SAs noted, Hoye has advanced state and federal equal protection chal \nlenges to the Ordinance and its enforcement, in addition to his First \nAmendment claims. \n\"The meaning of the Ordinance is ultimately a state-law question so it \nwould be \"our duty, of course, to accept [an authoritative] state judicial \nconstruction of the ordinance.\" Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham, 382 \nU.S. 87,91 (1965). There is no pertinent such construction, however. And \nwe very much doubt that the California courts would interpret the Ordi \nnance as containing an exception for speech that \"facilitates access\" to the \nclinic, as no such exception is apparent in the Ordinance's text, and the \naddition of one would, far from preserving the Ordinance's constitutional \nity, foreclose it. \n\n9684  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nferent,  unwritten,  rule----one  with  an  unmistakable  resem \nblance  to  the  old  version  of the  Ordinance,  the  one  that \nrestricted engaging in  conversation \"in an effort to  harass, \nintimidate, or persuade that individual not to access . . . repro \nductive  health services.\" Because  that rule-i.e., the  Ordi \nnance  as  erroneously  understood  by  Oakland-is \nimpermissibly content-discriminatory, we must craft a remedy \ndesigned to foreclose its continued enforcement, while pre \nserving the facially valid Ordinance. \nIt would seem anomalous for a court to enjoin the enforce \nment  of a  facially  constitutional  Ordinance.  On  the  other \nhand, it would be meaningless to enjoin Oakland's erroneous \ninterpretation  of the  Ordinance:  Oakland has  insisted that \nthere is no distinction between the actual Ordinance and what \nit enforces. In other words, there is no question that, under \nHill, the City can restrict the speech of anti-abortion prote \nstors like Hoye, but it is only constitutional for it to restrict \nanti-abortion protestors' speech under a rule that also restricts \npro-abortion  speech.  The  Ordinance,  as  written,  is  such a \nvalid rule; the Ordinance as interpreted and enforced by Oak \nland  is  not.  The  question  is  how  to  ensure  that  the  rule \nenforced by Oakland is a content-neutral one, i.e. the rule that \nwe  believe  the  Ordinance  actually  pronounces,  and  not  a \ncontent-discriminatory rule, i.e., the rule that Oakland errone \nouslyenforces. \n[8]  The District Court, with its greater familiarity with the \nfacts and parties, is better positioned than we to address this \nremedial question. On remand, the District Court should enter \ndeclaratory judgment in  favor  of Hoye,  declaring  that  (1) \nOakland's policy of exempting speech \"facilitating access\" to \nclinics from the coverage of the Ordinance violates the First \nAmendment and that (2) the Ordinance, as written, does not \nexempt such speech and so is facially constitutional. If the \nDistrict Court concludes that declaratory relief alone will be \ninadequate to change the City's enforcement policy (and that \nHoye satisfies the  standard criteria for injunctive relief),  it \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9685 \nshould then consider enjoining the City from continuing to \nenforce the Ordinance.\" \nv. \n[9]  We have discussed what McGuire II called a \"second \nkind\" of as-applied challenge, addressing it as identical to a \nfacial challenge to the City's enforcement policy. Hoye also \nbrings a paradigmatic as-applied challenge, arguing that it is \nunconstitutional to apply the Ordinance to him because, given \nall the circumstances, his ability to communicate is unduly \nconstricted. The First Circuit considered such a challenge but \nrejected it. McGuire II, 386 F.3d at 61. Again, we fmd the \nFirst Circuit's discussion helpful, but conclude in the end that \nwe cannot resolve this challenge given our other holdings. \nAs a general matter, a facial challenge is a challenge to an \nentire legislative enactment or provision. See Foti, 146 F.3d \nat 635 (explaining that a statute is facially unconstitutional if \n\"it is unconstitutional in every conceivable application, or it \nseeks to prohibit such a broad range of protected conduct that \nit is unconstitutionally overbroad\") (internal quotation marks \nomitted). If it does not charge statutory overbreadth, \"a facial \nchallenge must fail where the statute has a plainly legitimate \nsweep.\" Wash. State Grange v.  Wash. State Republican Party, \n552 U.S. 442, 449 (2008) (quotation omitted). A paradigmatic \nas-applied attack, by contrast, challenges only one of the rules \nin a statute, a subset of the statute's applications, or the appli \ncation of the statute to a specific factual circumstance, under \nthe assumption that a court can \"separate valid from invalid \nsubrules or applications.\" Richard H. Fallon, Jr., As-Applied \n\"Of course, even if the District Court enjoins Oakland's enforcement \nof the Ordinance altogether, the City could later apply for the injunction \nto be lifted or modified if it made a sufficient showing that it had adopted \nand would apply an evenhanded enforcement policy.

(quotation omitted). \nApplying these principles, the First Circuit in McGuire II \nfirst observed that the ''plaintiffs d[id] not and cannot argue \nthat they are different types of actors, or that they are involved \nin a different type of fact situation, from the ones on the basis \nof which the law was already upheld facially.\" McGuire II, \n386 F.3d at 61. It reasoned then that the as-applied challenge \nbrought by sidewalk counselors necessarily failed,  because \n\"the fact situation that [they] are involved in here is the core \nfact situation intended to be covered by this buffer zone stat \nute, and it is the same type of fact situation that was envi \nsioned by this court when the facial challenge was denied.\" \nId.  While we agree with the First Circuit's analytical frame \nwork, Hoye here argues that he is \"involved in a different type \nof fact situation[] from the one[] on the basis of which the \nlaw was ... upheld facially.\" Id. \nOur facial analysis of the statute was controlled by Hill, a \ncase in which there was no suggestion that the anti-abortion \nactivists'  ability  to  communicate  in  accord with the  chal \nlenged statute was being impeded by the efforts of opposing \nspeakers. In concluding that the Colorado statute, as a facial \nmatter, was narrowly tailored and left open ample alternative \nchannels of communication, the Supreme Court reasoned, for \nexample, that \"[s ] igns, pictures, and voice itself can cross an \n8-foot gap with ease.\" Hill, 530 U.S. at 729. That observation \nled the Supreme Court to the conclusion that the Colorado \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9687 \nstatute would \"not have any adverse impact on the readers' \nability to read signs displayed by demonstrators.\" [d.  at 726. \nAs noted at the outset, a valid time-place-and-manner regu \nlation must \"leave open ample alternative channels for com \nmunication.\"  Ward,  491  U.S.  at  791  (quotation  omitted). \n\"[A]n alternative is not ample if the speaker is not permitted \nto reach the intended audience.\" Berger, 569 F.3d at 1049 \n(quotation omitted). In the factual circumstances assumed in \nHill and controlling our analysis as to the facial challenge, the \nOrdinance does leave \"ample alternative channels for commu \nnication. \" \nHoye contends, however, that escorts regularly inhibit his \nspeech by covering up his sign and drowning out his spoken \nwords. The escorts have, of course, their own constitutionally \nprotected  free-speech  interests  at  stake,  including  one  in \nexpressing their own firm conviction that the emotional well \nbeing of women requires insulating them from those seeking \nto challenge, sometimes starkly and unpleasantly, their deci \nsion to consider an abortion procedure. Still, the escorts' free \nspeech interests do not diminish their on-the-ground impact \non Hoye's prospects for communicating his message. \nThe First Circuit,  and the District Court here,  dismissed \nconcerns about the impact of escorts' activities on antiabor \ntion protestors' ability to communicate their messages on the \nbasis that the escorts' interactions with sidewalk counselors \nwere  mere  ''private  jousting  in  the  speech  marketplace,\" \nMcGuire II, 386 F.3d at 60, involving no state action. That \ncharacterization is accurate to the degree the escorts are com \nmunicating  opposing  messages,  as  the  First  Amendment \noffers no protection against countervailing speech. See Buck \nley v.  Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 48-49 (1976). \nAs to  the relevance of efforts by the  escorts to prevent \nHoye's message from being communicated, the factual predi \ncate of an as-applied challenge does not need to be created by \n\n9688  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nthe State. In Hill, for instance, the Supreme Court expressly \ninvited as-applied challenges where \"[s  ]pecial problems arise \n[because] clinics have particularly wide entrances or are situ \nated within multipurpose office buildings.\" 530 U.S. at 730. \nThe State does not design clinics with wide entrances or place \nthem in multipurpose office buildings; instead, the only rele \nvant state action would be the application of the statute to \nsuch factual settings. Cf Galvin v. Hay, 374 F.3d 739,754-55 \n(9th Cir. 2004) (sustaining an as-applied challenge in light of \na  \"sight line  partially  obstructed by trees\" relevant at the \nnarrow-tailoring stage). \nSo whether the Ordinance is unconstitutionally restricting \nHoye's speech is ultimately a causation question based on the \nparticular facts: Does the Ordinance as applied to the actual \ncircumstances-including  the  attempts  by  others  to  stifle \nHoye's  speech,  as  opposed  to  simply  countering  it  with \nopposing messages-foreclose ample altemative channels of \ncommunication? In other words, Hoye will bear the burden of \nshowing that it is the Ordinance's requirement that he obtain \nconsent to approach, not the activities of escorts alone, that \ndeprives him of ample alternative means of communication. \n[10]  In the end, we cannot determine on the present record \nwhether Hoye can meet that burden. Any resolution of Hoye's \nparadigmatic as-applied challenge could ouly be relevant to \nfuture  applications  of the  Ordinance.  We  have  previously \ndeclined to entertain as-applied challenges that would require \nus to speculate as to prospective facts. See,  e.g., Hotel Emp. \n& Rest. Emp. Int'l Union v. Nev.  Gaming Comm 'n, 984 F.2d \n1507,  1517 (9th  Cir.  1993); Polykoff v.  Collins,  816 F.2d \n1326, 1338 (9th Cir. 1987); cf WolfSon v. Brammer, 616 F.3d \n1045, 1060 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining that ripeness doctrine \nincludes a ''prudential component\" that requires evaluation of \n''the fitness  of the issues  for judicial decision\").  We  have \nalready held Oakland's application of the Ordinance to Hoye, \nunder its current enforcement policy, unconstitutional because \ntainted  by  the  content-discriminatory  policy.  Even  if the \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9689 \napplication of the Ordinance has in the past deprived Hoye of \nample channels of communication, that defect may be cured \nif Oakland begins to enforce the Ordinance in an evenhanded \nmanner.  Consequently,  Hoye's  second  kind  of as-applied \nchallenge is dependent on fluid and future facts. \nVI. \nTo recapitulate, we reach three separate conclusions. \nFirst, the Ordinance is facially constitutional. That is to say, \nwe do  not find any relevant differences between the  Ordi \nnance's purpose and text and those of the Colorado statute \nthat the Supreme Court held to be constitutional in Hill. \nSecond, as to Hoye's challenge to the enforcement of the \nOrdinance, we hold that Oakland's enforcement policy is a \nconstitutionally invalid, content-based regulation of speech. \nBy adopting that policy, Oakland has taken sides in a public \ndebate in a manner that, as Hill itself explained, the Constitu \ntion does not permit. But because this problem is not a prob \nlem with the  Ordinance itself,  we remand this  case to  the \nDistrict Court to craft a remedy that ensures that Oakland will \nadopt and henceforth apply a policy that enforces the Ordi \nnance  as  written,  that is,  in an  evenhanded,  constitutional \nmanner. \nThird,  as  to  Hoye's  challenge  to  whether Oakland may \napply the Ordinance to situations in which doing so would \nprevent him from communicating his message, we conclude \nthat the success of the challenge depends on Oakland's future \nenforcement policy and the particular circumstances in which \nthat policy may be applied. We therefore do not reach that \nchallenge but also do not preclude Hoye from bringing such \na challenge in the future. \nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  AFFIRM  in  part  and \nREVERSE  in  part  the  ruling  of the  District  Court.  We \n\n9690  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nREMAND the case to the District Court with instructions to \ngrant Hoye's motion for  summary judgment in part and to \ngrant him relief consistent with this opinion. \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9691 \nAPPENDIX \nmended Oakland City Council Ordinance No.  1286018 \nWHEREAS,  safe  and unimpeded access  to  reproductive \nhealth care services is critically and uniquely important to the \npublic health, safety, and welfare so that persons desiring or \nneeding access to  such services should not be intimidated, \nhampered,  impeded,  harassed,  or restrained from  obtaining \nthose services; and \nWHEREAS,  persons  attempting  to  access  reproductive \nhealth care facilities to obtain reproductive health care ser \nvices have been subject to harassing or intimidating activity \nfrom extremely close proximity, tending to hamper or impede \ntheir access to those facilities and services; and \nWHEREAS such activity in close proximity subverts the \nright to privacy of those reproductive health care services, a \nright that is protected by the United States Constitution and \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, U.S.C.S. Sec \ntion 248, and is explicitly guaranteed in California's Constitu \ntion,  Article  I,  Section  I,  including the  right to  seek and \nobtain all health care services permitted under the laws of this \nStates; and \nWHEREAS, such activity interferes with a person's right to \nseek reproductive health care services and counseling which \nsuch persons are entitled to seek and obtain; and \nWHEREAS, offices and facilities that have patient stays of \nshorter duration may be more vulnerable to such subversion \nof rights on account of the layout and design of their facilities \nand parking areas as well as their staff deployment; and \n1ยทStrikeout text shows amendments from originally enacted version. \n\n9692  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nWHEREAS, the facilities with the fewest resources for pro \nviding  adequate  security  and safety to  individuals  seeking \naccess to reproductive health services are those not affiliated \nwith hospitals; and \nWHEREAS,  the  adverse  physiological  and  emotional \neffects  created by such harassing  or intimidating  activities \nmay pose health risks, interfere with medical treatment, diag \nnosis or recovery, or cause persons to delay or forego medical \ntreatment; and \nWHEREAS, this Ordinance does not preclude all protest \ning, picketing, demonstrating, leafleting, or educational activi \nties near a facility providing reproductive health care services, \nand in particular, is not intended to preclude any lawful pick \neting,  leafleting,  and/or  free  speech,  but  is  a  necessary \ncontent-neutral time, place, and manner restriction intended to \nreconcile and protect the rights of persons rendering or seek \ning reproductive health care with the First Amendment rights \nof demonstrators; and \nWHEREAS,  existing federal  and state laws do  not ade \nquately protect the rights of those seeking or providing health \ncare services, now, therefore \nTHE COUNCIL OF  THE CITY OF  OAKLAND DOES \nORDAIN AS FOLLOWS: \nChapter 8.50 is added to the Oakland Municipal Code to read \nas follows: \nSection 1.  Title and purpose. \nThis chapter shall be known as the \"access to reproductive \nhealth care facilities ordinance.\" The City Council finds that \nevery person in the City of Oakland has a basic and funda \nmental right to privacy protected by the United States Consti \ntution and explicitly guaranteed in California's Constitution, \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9693 \nArticle 1, Section 1, including the right to seek and obtain all \nhealth care services, permitted under the laws of this State. \nCentral to this right is the need to secure access to all repro \nductive health care services. Access to these services is a mat \nter of critical importance not only to the individual, but also \nto the health and welfare of all residents of the City of Oak \nland and the region. Intentional efforts to harass an individual \nor prevent that individual from exercising his or her right to \nseek and obtain reproductive health care services are therefore \ncontrary to the interests of the people of Oakland. \nThis Ordinance is not intended to create any limited, desig \nnated, or general public fora. Rather it is intended to protect \nthose who seek access to constitutionally protected reproduc \ntive health services from conduct which violates their rights. \nSection 2. Definitions. \na.  \"Reproductive health services\" refers to all medical, sur \ngical, counseling, referral, and informational services related \nto the hwBaB: repfa8llSwi8 system, iBeluBing serviees Q1lfdng \nJlfeglillftey or the termination of a pregnancy, whether such \nservices are provided in a clinic, physician's office, or other \nfacility other than a licensed hospital, but not if provided at \na clinic or other facility owned and/or operated by a licensed \nhospital. \nb.  \"Reproductive  health  care  facility\"  refers  to  a  facility \nlicensed pursuant to  Chapter  1 (co=encing with Section \n1200) of Division 2 of the Health and Safety code or any \nother facility that primarily provides reproductive health ser \nvices that is not licensed as a hospital, and is not owned, and/ \nor operated by a licensed hospital. \n6. \"Pflmariljr\" means 51 q{. sf Blare sf the seplliees fJfBv4EleEl. \ndo  c.  \"Harassing\"  means  the non-consensual  and knowing \napproach within  eight  feet  of another person  or occupied \n\n9694  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nmotor vehicle for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill, \nto display a sign to, or engage in oral protest, education, or \ncounseling with such other person in a public way or on a \nsidewalk area within one hundred (100) feet of the entrance \nof a reproductive health care facility. \ne, d. \"Interfering\"  means  to  restrict  a  person's  freedom  of \nmovement or access to or egress from a reproductive heath \ncare facility providing reproductive health services. \nt; e. \"Counseling\" means engaging in conversation with, dis \nplaying signs to, and/or distributing literature to individuals \nseeking access to, passage from, or services within the repro \nductive health care facility, in 1m eITeR te IiaFaBs, intimidate, \nef perSllade that indiVIdual Het te assess SIleH repfeduetive \nhealtli serv-iees. \ng, f. \"Eight feet\" shall be measured from any extension of the \nbody of the individual seeking access to, passage from, or ser \nvices within the reproductive health care facility, and/or the \nexterior of any occupied motor vehicle, to any extension of \nthe body of, or any sign or object held by another person. \nJr..  g.  \"Providing reproductive health services\" shall include \ndoctors, nurses, any employee of a reproductive health care \nfacility and volunteers who, with the consent of the reproduc \ntive health care facility, assist in conducting patients of such \nfacility safely into the facility. \nSection  3.  Prohibited  harassment  of individuals  seeking \naccess to health care facilities. \na.  It shall be unlawful to use force, threat of force, or physi \ncal obstruction to intentionally injure, harass, intimidate, or \ninterfere with or attempt to injure, harass, intimidate, or inter \nfere with any person because that person will be, is, or has \nbeen, providing or obtaining reproductive health services. \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9695 \nb.  Within 100 feet of the entrance of a reproductive health \ncare facility, it shall be unlawful to willfully and knowingly \napproach within eight feet of any person seeking to enter such \na facility, or any occupied motor vehicle seeking entry, with \nout the consent of such person or vehicle occupant, for the \npurpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering with such per \nm \nson or vehicle occupant  eSlmeetisa 'nith seekiag Fef!fsEitie \nti'fe health serviees, Sf fef the Jllllllsse sf mterferiag with that \nPefS8B'S Sf veBiele aSSliflant's ahtaining Sf prS'l-i8ing Fepf9 \n8lie&ve Itealtli seR'4ees. \nc. Within 100 feet of the entrance of a reproductive health \ncare facility, it shall be unlawful to willfully and knowingly \napproach within eight feet of any person seeking to enter such \na facility, or any occupied motor vehicle seeking entry, for the \npurpose  of injuring or intimidating  such person or vehicle \noccupant in connection with seeking reproductive health ser \nvices. \nSection 4. Enforcement. \na.  Any person who shall be convicted of a violation of sub \nsection 3 above shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and \nshall be punishable by imprisonment in the County jail for not \nmore than one year, or by a fme not to exceed two thousand \ndollars ($2,000), or by both such fine and imprisonment. \nb.  Civil Remedies \ni.  Any person  providing,  seeking  to  provide,  or \nseeking  reproductive  health  services  who  is \naggrieved by conduct prohibited by this chapter may \ncommence a civil action in the Courts of the State of \nCalifornia. \nii.  In any action commenced under subparagraph a. \nof this  section,  the  court  may  award  appropriate \nrelief, including temporary, preliminary, or perma-\n\n9696  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \nnent injunctive relief and compensatory and exem \nplary damages and reasonable fees for attorneys and \nexpert witnesses.  With respect to  damages, at any \ntime  before  final judgment,  plaintiff may elect to \nrecover, in lieu of compensatory damages, an award \nof statutory damages in the amount of $5,000.00 per \nviolation. \nSection 5. Accomodation of Competing Rights. \nIn adopting this legislation, the Oakland City Council rec \nognizes both the fundamental constitutional right to assemble \npeacefully and to demonstrate on matters of public concem, \nas well as the right to seek and obtain health care. This legis \nlation promotes the full exercise of these rights and strikes an \nappropriate accommodation between them. \nNothing in this Ordinance shall be construed to prohibit \nany expressive conduct (including peaceful picketing or other \npeaceful demonstration) protected from legal prohibition by \nthe First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the \nCalifornia Constitution or any federal or California statute. \nSection 6. Severability. \nIf any part, provision, or clause of this Ordinance or the \napplication thereof to any person or circumstance is held to be \ninvalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, all other provi \nsions and clauses hereof, including the application of such \nprovisions  and  clauses  to  other persons  or  circumstances, \nshall not be affected thereby and shall continue in full force \nand effect. To this end, the provisions of this chapter are sev \nerable. \nColorado Revised Statutes ยง 18-9-22 \n(I) The general assembly recognizes that access to health care \nfacilities for the purpose of obtaining medical counseling and \n\nHoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND  9697 \ntreatment is imperative for the citizens of this state; that the \nexercise of a person's right to protest or counsel against cer \ntain medical procedures must be balanced against another per \nson's right to obtain medical counseling and treatment in an \nunobstructed manner; and that preventing the willful obstruc \ntion of a person's access to medical counseling and treatment \nat a health care facility is a matter of statewide concern. The \ngeneral assembly therefore declares that it is appropriate to \nenact  legislation  that  prohibits  a  person  from  knowingly \nobstructing another person's entry to or exit from a health \ncare facility. \n(2)  A person commits a class 3 misdemeanor if such person \nknowingly  obstructs,  detains,  hinders,  impedes,  or  blocks \nanother person's entry to or exit from a health care facility. \n(3)  No  person  shall  knowingly  approach  another  person \nwithin eight feet of such person, unless such other person con \nsents, for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, dis \nplaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or \ncounseling with such other person in the public way or side \nwalk  area  within  a  radius  of one  hundred  feet  from  any \nentrance door to a health care facility. Any person who vio \nlates this subsection (3) commits a class 3 misdemeanor. \n(4)  For the purposes of this section,  'health care facility' \nmeans  any  entity  that  is  licensed,  certified,  or  otherwise \nauthorized or permitted by law to administer medical treat \nment in this state. \n(5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a \nstatutory or home rule city or county or city and county from \nadopting a law for the control of access to health care facili \nties that is no less restrictive than the provisions of this sec \ntion. \n(6) In addition to, and not in lieu of, the penalties set forth in \nthis section, a person who violates the provisions of this sec-\n\n9698  HoYE v. CITY OF OAKLAND \ntion shall be subject to civil liability, as provided in section \n13-21-106.7, C.R.S. ",

INTRODUCTION \n2  Plaintiff asserts free speech and equal protection challenges to a City of Oakland \n3  ordinance safeguarding the right of Oakland citizens to safely and privately access health care \n4  services.  Plaintiffs claims fail, however, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in \n5  Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000).  Under Hill, it is clear that the Oakland ordinance, which \n6  was modeled on the Colorado statute upheld in Hill, is facially constitutional.  Furthermore, it is \n7  undisputed that plaintiff s arrest complied with the terms of the ordinance.  Plaintiffs complaint \n8  shOUld therefore be dismissed in its entirety. \n9  II.  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n10  On December 18, 2007, the Oakland City Council passed Ordinance No. 81022, \"Access \n11  to Reproductive Health Care Facilities,\" a \"Bubble Ordinance\" that protects patients seeking \n12  reproductive health services and reproductive health clinic personnel from harassment, \n13  intimidation, or interference with their ability to access reproductive health care facilities. \n14  Docket No. 31, Laden Decl., ~ 2; Compl., Ex. A., at 1.  On December 19, 2007, plaintiff filed a \n15  complaint alleging that the Ordinance was facially unconstitutional.  Docket No. 31, Laden \n16  Decl., ~ 3.  After a telephone conference with the Court, the City agreed to amend the Ordinance \n17  to obviate plaintiff's concerns.  ld.  On February 5, 2008, the City passed the amended ordinance \n18  (Ordinance No. 12860) (the \"Ordinance\"). ld., ~ 6. \n19  The Ordinance provides that \"[w  ] ithin 100 feet of the entrance of a reproductive health \n20  care facility, it shall be unlawful to willfully and knowingly approach within eight (8) feet of any \n21  person seeking to enter such a facUity ... without the consent of such person ... for the purpose \n22  of counseling, harassing, or interfering with such person ....\"   Compi., Ex.A, at 4.  The \n23  Ordinance also prohibits the use offorce or physical obstruction to interfere with persons \n24  \"providing ... reproductive health services.\" ld.  Persons \"providing reproductive health \n25  services\" include \"volunteers who, with the consent of the reproductive health care facility, assist \n26  in conducting patients of such facility safely into the facility.\" Jd., Ex. A., at 3. \n27  On April 29, 2008, plaintiff stood in front of a reproductive health facility, the Family \n28  Planning Specialists Medical Group, with a \"picket sign and a bundle of pamphlets.\"  Docket \nDEFllNOANTS MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO \nOHS West:26046026S.2 \nDISMISS PLAlNiIFF'S COMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page3 of 11\n1  No. 32, Supp. Laden Decl., Ex. A, Crime Report, at 4.  Five separate witnesses attested under \n2  oath to the fact that the plaintiff approached within eight feet of at least eight different patients \n3  and their families or significant others, to hand out fliers and \"harass\" them.l  Docket No. 32, \n4  Supp. Laden Decl., Exs. CoG.  Plaintiff approached patients attempting to enter the facility as \n5  well as patients in motor vehicles parked in the loading zone in front of the facility.  Id.  At one \n6  point, the director of the medical group used a measuring tape to show plaintiff that he was \n7  violating the ordinance.  Docket No. 32, Supp. Laden Decl., Ex. A at 4.  The director measured \n8  the distance between plaintiff and the clinic's patients to show plaintiff that he was within eight \n9  feet of them.  Id.  Despite being repeatedly warned by employees of the facility, plaintiff \n10  knowingly and willingly continued to violate the ordinance.  Id. at 4-5.  In many cases, plaintiff \nII  was within just two or three feet ofthe patients.  Id.  Many witnesses also confirmed that plaintiff \n12  came to the clinic on the same day of almost every week and that he often approached within \n13  eight feet of patients while \"harassing\" them.  Id \n14  On May 13, 2008, plaintiff was arrested by the Oakland police for his April 29, 2008, \n15  violations of the Ordinance.  On May 22, 2008, plaintiff filed an application for temporary \n16  restraining order and order to show cause regarding preliminary injunction.  Docket No. 20.  In a \n17  telephonic hearing on May 30, 2008, this Court denied plaintiffs application.  Docket No. 34. \n18  Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint on June 6, 2008.  Docket No. 38. \n19  III.  ARGUMENT \n20  A Rule 12(b)( 6) dismissal is proper where there is either a \"lack of a cognizable legal \n21  theory\" or \"the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\"  Balistreri v. \n22  Pacifica Police Dept., 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990); Graehling v.

Moreover, \"[a]lthough the federal procedural standards \n2  for notice pleading ... are liberal, they are not so liberal as to allow purely conclusory statements \n3  to suffice to state a claim that can survive a motion to dismiss ....\"  Miller v. Cant '/ Airlines. \n4  Inc., 260 F. Supp. 2d 931, 935 (N.D. Cal. 2003). \n5  A.  The Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Violation Of The First \nAmendment's Free Speech Clause. \n6 \n7  Plaintiff s First Cause of Action purports to state a claim for violation of the Free Speech \n8  Clause of the First Amendment.  Compi. ft 21ยท27.  This cause of action should be dismissed \n9  because plaintiff s allegations are insufficient to support either a facial or an as-applied challenge \n10  to the Ordinance. \n11  1.  The Ordinance, on Its Face, Does Not Violate the Free Speech \nProtections of the United States Constitution. \n12 \n13  The Supreme Court recently upheld a Colorado statute nearly identical to the Oakland \n14  ordinance in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000).  Like the Oakland ordinance, the Colorado \n15  statute regulated speech within 100 feet of any health care facility, and made it unlawful for \n16  anyone within the 100-foot regulated area to \"'knowingly approach' within eight feet of another \n17  person, without that person's consent, 'for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, \n18  displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with such other person. \n19  ... '\" Id. at 707.  The Supreme Court held that the Colorado statute was content-neutral because \n20  it regulated ''the places where some speech may occur\" rather than speech itself, id. at 719, its \n21  restrictions applied \"equally to all demonstrators, regardless of viewpoint,\" id., and the state's \n22  interests in protecting access to health care facilities and patients' privacy were unrelated to the \n23  content of the demonstrators' speech, id. at 719-20.  These rationales apply equally to the \n24  Oakland ordinance, which regulates speech of any viewpoint within 100 feet of a reproductive \n25  health facility in the interest of safeguarding access to health care.  Compl., Ex. A.  The \n26  Ordinance, therefore, is not a content- or viewpoint-based restriction on speech in violation of \n27  the First Amendment.  See Compl. ~ 24. \n28  The Supremc Court has also made clear that an ordinance like Oakland's is narrowly \nOHS West:260460265.2  -3- DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S \nCOMPLAtNt \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page5 of 11\ntailored and leaves open enough alternative channels of communication to survive constitutional \n2  review.  In Hill, the Court reasoned that the Colorado statute placed no limitations on the \n3  \"number, size, text, or images\" on demonstrators' signs and that it did not limit the number of \n4  speakers permitted in the area or their noise level.  Hill, 530 U.S. at 725-26.  The statute's eight-\n5  foot \"buffer zone\" was small enough to allow speakers to communicate at a \"normal \n6  conversational distance.\"  Most significantly, its prohibition on speech only where speakers \n7  \"knowingly approach\" within eight feet of individuals allowed speakers to remain in place even \n8  if individuals passed within eight feet of them and \"protect[ ed] speakers who thought they were \n9  keeping pace with the targeted individual at the proscribed distance from inadvertently violating \n10  the statute.\" ld at 726-27.  As in Hill, the Oakland ordinance creates a mere eight-foot \n11  separation between speakers and individuals trying to enter health facilities, and makes speech \n12  unlawful only where the speaker \"willfully and knowingly approach[es].\"  Compl., Ex. A, at 4. \n13  Thus, like the statute challenged in Hill, Oakland's ordinance is narrowly tailored.  The Hill \n14  court also firmly established that access to reproductive care is an important govemment interest. \n15  !d. at 715.  All of plaintiffs arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  ld. \n16  Plaintiff's allegation that the Ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad also fails. \n17  Compl. ~ 22.  While it is not clear from the complaint exactly what aspects of the Ordinance \n18  plaintiff believes to be overbroad, the Supreme Court's opinion in Hill shows that the Ordinance \n19  is not unconstitutionally overbroad.  As the Supreme Court stated, the fact that a regulation \n20  protects more people than just patients at facilities where confrontational speech has occurred is \n21  \"of no constitutional significance.  What is important is that all persons entering or leaving health \n22  care facilities share the interests served by the statute.\" Hill, 530 U.S. at 731.  The Court \n23  acknowledged that the Colorado statute regulated protected speech.  The only issue was whether \n24  the statute was a valid \"time, place or manner\" restriction, and therefore the statute's \n25  comprehensiveness was \"a virtue, not a vice, because it is evidence against there being a \n26  discriminatory governmental motive.\" ld.  The Court also rejected the contention that the \n27  statute's regulation of a broad range of forms of expression made it overbroad.  As the Court \n28  stated, the statute \"does not ban any messages ... [i]t merely regulates the places where \nOilS West:26046026S.2  -4- DEFENDANT'S MonON TO DISMISS PLAINTIfF'S \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page6 of 11\ncommunications may occur.\" Id.  Like the Colorado statute, the Ordinance protects all persons \n2  entering and leaving reproductive health facilities.  It does so only by regulating the place where \n3  communications may occur.  The Ordinance is therefore not an overbroad regulation of speech. \n4  Plaintiff's complaint also alleges that the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because \n5  it \"fails to adequately advise, notify, or inform persons threatened with possible prosecution for \n6  violation of [its] requirements.\"  Compl. 'll28.  This contention too should be rejected for the \n7  reasons expressed by the Supreme Court in Hill, in concluding that the Colorado statute was not \n8  unconstitutionally vague: \"it is clear what the ordinance as a whole prohibits.\" Hill, 530 U.S. at \n9  733.  The Oakland ordinance clearly prohibits the following specific actions: \n10  โข  within 100 feet of the entrance of a reproductive health care facility; \n11  โข  willingly and knowingly approaching within 8 feet of any person; \nโข \n12  for the purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering with such person --\n13  terms that are explicitly defined in Section 2 of the Ordinance.  Millen \n14  Decl., Ex. A, at 3-4. \n15  Finally, plaintiff has virtually conceded the facial constitutionality of the Ordinance and \n16  the Court has noted the same.  At the May 30, 2008, hearing in which the Court denied plaintiff's \n17  application for a Temporary Restraining Order, the Court noted the facial constitutionality of the \n18  Ordinance: \"[i]n other words, you are not saying the Oakland ordinance is unconstitutional.  I \n19  mean, we have had that discussion.\"  Plaintiff responded: \"Yeah, true,\" and the Court replied by \n20  concluding: \"So [the Ordinance] is Constitutional.\"  Docket No. 34, Transcript p. 11:5-10. \n21  2.  The Ordinance\"A  s Applied\" to Plaintiff is Constitutional. \n22  Plaintiff's First Cause of Action also purports to make an as-applied challenge to the \n23  Ordinance.  While the parameters of plaintiff's as-applied challenge are unclear, it is clear that he \n24  has alleged no facts that would support a successful as-applied claim. \n25  a.  Plaintiffs Arrest Did Not Violate The Constitution. \n26  Plaintiff alleges that he \"has already been arrested once for allegedly violating the \n27  Ordinance and is at risk to be arrested again.\"  Compl. 'lll O.  He asserts that he fears that he will \n28  be arrested again for conduct protected by the Constitution.  Id.  These allegations are not \nOHS West:260460265.2  -5- DEFfiNDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page7 of 11\nsufficient to state a valid as-applied claim, however, because plaintiff has not alleged - nor could \n2  he - that anything about his actual arrest violated the Constitution. \n3  Five separate witnesses have attested under oath to the fact that on April 29, 2008, the \n4  plaintiff approached within eight feet of at least eight different patients and their families or \n2 \n5  significant others, to hand out fliers and \"harass\" them. Docket No. 32, Supp. Laden Decl., Exs. \n6  C-G.  Plaintiff does not dispute that he was arrested for violating the Ordinance - that he \n7  \"approached\" women entering the clinic; that he came less than eight feet from them in order to \n8  convey his message; and that he approached the clinic director.  Id.  Because he was arrested for \n9  clear violations of a constitutionally valid ordinance, plaintiff cannot make a valid as-applied \n10  challenge to the Ordinance based on his arrest. \n11 \nb.  The Alleged Comments By Police Officers Do Not Make \nPlaintiffs Arrest Unconstitutional. \n12 \n13  Plaintiffs complaint could also be read to base his as-applied challenge on the comments \n14  supposedly made to him by police officers interpreting the Ordinance.  Compl. ~ 9.  These \n15  comments are irrelevant.  Comments by police officers about scenarios not actually presented on \n16  the day of the arrest are irrelevant as a matter oflaw. See Monell v. Department a/Social \n17  Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978) (holding that a municipality can only be held liable for a \n18  constitutional injury where the acts in question are pursuant to the official policy or custom of \n19  the municipal government, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose acts may be said \n20  to fairly represent official policy).  Regardless of any comments that police officers allegedly \n21  made to plaintiff, he was arrested fbr violating the ordinance as written, and the Ordinance as \n22  written is constitutional.  Furthermore, plaintiff does not allege that any person was arrested for \n23  violating the Ordinance as allegedly \"interpreted\" by stray police comments. \n24 \n25 \n26  2  Plaintiff was \"clearly within 8 feet of [the patients].\"  Docket No. 32, Supp. Laden Decl., Ex. \nC.  Plaintiff would \"come within 4' of [the patients].\"  Id, Ex. D.  Plaintiff was \"clearly within 8 \n27  feet of [an escort].\"  Id, Ex. E.  Plaintiff \"carne within 2-3' each time to display his anti-abortion \nsign.\"  Id., Ex. F.  Witness \"observed [plaintiff] come within 2' of the patients.\"  Id, Ex. G. \n28 \nOHS Wesi:260460265.2  -6- DEfENDANTS MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page8 of 11\nc.  The Police Officers' Alleged Treatment of Clinic Escorts Did \nNot Violate Plaintiff's First Amendment Rights. \n2 \n3  Plaintiff also appears to claim that his First Amendment rights were violated by police \n4  officers' alleged statements about volunteer clinic escorts and by the same officers' failure to \n5  arrest clinic escorts after \"a witness observed two different clinic escorts ... approaching within \n6  8 feet of persons entering the clinic and speaking to them without obtaining their consent.\" \n7  Compl. ~ 9C.  The police's treatment of clinic escorts, however, has no impact on plaintiff's \n8  claim that his constitutional rights were violated. \n9  First. plaintiff does not have standing to assert a claim based on the police's treatment of \n10  the clinic escorts.  In order to have standing to bring a claim in federal court, \"a plaintiff must \n11  allege apersonal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely \n12  to be redressed by the requested relief.\" Allen v.  Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984) (citing Valley \n13  Forge Christian College v. Americans United/or Separation a/Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. \n14  464.472 (1982ยป. The non-arrest of the escorts was neither an injury-in-faet nor conduct personal \n15  to the plaintiff, and therefore he has no standing to bring a claim regarding defendant's failure to \n16  arrestthe escorts. \n17  Second, even were the Court to assume that plaintiff had standing to assert a claim based \n18  on the non-arrest of clinic escorts, the failure to arrest the escorts did not violate plaintiff s rights. \n19  Like the Colorado statute upheld in Hill, the Oakland ordinance prohibits certain speech within \n20  eight feet of \"any person\" - including escorts.  The Ordinance specifically protects \"volunteers \n21  who, with the consent of the reproductive health care facility, assist in conducting patients of \n22  such facility safely into the facility.\"  Id, Ex. A., at 3.  The Supreme Court upheld such language \n23  in Hill by explicitly recognizing that \"it was a cornmon practice to provide escorts for persons \n24  entering and leaving the clinics both to ensure their access and to provide protection ....\"   Hill, \n25  530 U.S. at 709-710. \n26  Oakland's protection of clinic volunteers who assist in conducting patients safely into \n27  reproductive health care facilities is a valid \"exercise of [Oakland's] police powers to protect the \n28  health and safety of[its] citizens.\" See Hill, 730 U.S. at 715.  Plaintiffs conclusory allegation \nOHS West:260460265.2  -7 - DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page9 of 11\nthat a witness saw \"volunteers ... approaching within 8 feet of persons entering the clinic and \n2  speaking to them without obtaining their consent\" (Compl. ~ 9C) does not undermine Oakland's \n3  exercise of its police powers here.  Plaintiff makes no allegations about what the volunteers said \n4  to the individuals whom they assisted to enter the clinic.  He does not allege that they did \n5  anything other than assist patients - at the direction and with the consent of the facility -to enter \n6  the facility.  Such activities have no impact on plaintiffs First Amendment rights. \n7  B.  The Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Violation Of The Fourteenth \nAmendment's Equal Protection Clause. \n8 \n9  Plaintiff s Second Cause of Action purports to state a claim for violation of the Equal \n10  Protection Clause of theยท Fourteenth Amendment.  Compl. ~~ 31-34.  This claim fails for two \n11  reasons.  First, as described above, the Ordinance is content- and viewpoint-neutral.  Contrary to \n12  plaintiff s assertion, the Ordinance does not distinguish between \"persons wishing to \n13  communicate with those entering abortion clinics for the purposes of encouraging them to use \n14  clinic services\" and \"persons wishing to communicate with those entering abortion clinics for the \n15  purposes of encouraging them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.\"  Compl. ~ \n16  32. \n17  Even if the Ordinance did burden only anti-abortion activists, that would not create a \n18  cause of action for an equal protection violation.  Anti-abortion activists are not a protected class \n19  of persons.  See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (holding that gender is a protected \n20  class); Korematsu v.  United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944) (holding that race is a protected class); \n21  Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971) (holding that alienage is a protected class); Yick Wo \n22  v. Hopkins, 188 U.S. 356 (1886) (holding that religion is a protected class).  The Ordinance, \n23  therefore, passes muster under the Equal Protection Clause as long as it is rationally related to a \n24  legitimate government interest.  See U.S. v. Carolene Products, 304 U.S. 144 (1938) (creating \n25  the tiers of scrutiny and applying rational basis review to economic regulation); New York City \n26  Transit Authority v.  Beazer, 440 U.S. 568 (1979) (holding that government classifications of \n27  non-protected classes are analyzed under rational basis review, in which the classification only \n28  needs to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest). \nOHS W.st:260460265.2  -8- DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF's \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page10 of 11\nThe City Council found that access to reproductive health care services \"is a matter of \n2  critical importance not only to the individual, but also to the health and welfare of all residents of \n3  the City of Oakland.\"  Comp!., Ex. A, at 2.  The Supreme Court has held that a statute almost \n4  identical to the Ordinance unquestionably protects legitimate state interests.  See Hill, 730 U.S. at \n5  715-16.  Plaintiffh!!.s therefore not stated a claim for violation of the Equal Protection Clause. \n6  C.  The Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Violation Of The California \nConstitution's Free Speech Provision. \n7 \n8  Plaintiff's Third Cause of Action purports to state a claim for violation of the free speech \n9  provisions of the California Constitution.  Plaintiff has made absolutely no allegations, however, \n10  explaining how the Ordinance itself or his treatment under the Ordinance violated the California \nII  Constitution, and therefore this claim should be disrnissed.  See Miller, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 935 \n12  (\"the federal procedural standards for notice pleading ... are liberal [but] they are not so liberal \n13  as to allow purely conclusory statements to suffice to state a claim that can survive a motion to \n14   dยทISIยทTIl SS.. โข. \")โข  \n15  D.  The Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Violation Of The California \nConstitution's Equal Protection Provision. \n16 \nPlaintiff's Fourth Cause of Action purports to state a claim for violation of the equal \n17 \nprotection provisions of the California Constitution.3  As with his claim for violation of the free \n18 \nspeech provisions of the California Constitution, plaintiffs Fourth Cause of Action makes \n19 \nabsolutely no allegations explaining how the Ordinance violates his equal protection rights under \n20 \nthe California Constitution.  This claim should therefore be dismissed. \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nThe Fourth Cause of Action also references Article IV, Section 16 of the California \n3 \nConstitution, which states that \"alllaws of a general nature have uniform operation\" and \"[a ] \n26 \nlocal or special statute is invalid in any case if a general statute can be made applicable.\" \nPlaintiff cannot rely on this section, because it does not apply to municipal ordinances.  In Re \n27 \nApplication a/Lyons, 27 Cal. App. 2d 182,187 (Cal. App. 1938). \n28 \nOHS West:260460265.2  -9- DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF'S \nCOMPLAINT \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document44    Filed06/23/08   Page11 of 11\nE. \nThe Complaint Fails To State A Claim For Violation Of The California Civil \nCode. \n2 \n3  Plaintiff's Fifth Cause of Action purports to state a claim for injunctive relief for \n4  violation of plaintiff s rights under the United States and California Constitutions.  As stated \n5  above, plaintiff has not stated a claim for violation of any of his federal or state constitutional \n6  rights.  His Fifth Cause of Action therefore should also be dismissed. \n7  IV.  CONCLUSION \n8  Oakland's Ordinance passes constitutional muster under the Supreme Court's decision in \n9  Hill.  None of plaintiff's allegations about the supposed legal commentary of Oakland police \n10  officers or about the failure to arrest escorts working with clinic staff to assist patients entering \n11  the facility alter this outcome.  Just like the statute at issue in Hill, Oakland's Ordinance strikes \n12  the appropriate balance between plaintiff's rights and the rights of patients seeking access to \n13  reproductive health care.  As the Supreme Court concluded in Hill, \"Private citizens have always \n14  retained the power to decide for themselves what they wished to read, and within limits, what \n15  oral messages they wish to hear.  This statute simply empowers private citizens entering a health \n16  care facility to prevent a speaker, who is within eight feet and advancing, from communicating a \n17  message they do not want to hear.\" \n18  For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court should ilismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with \n19  prejudice. \n20  Dated: June 23, 2008  ANGELA 1.

Hoye claims that the ordinance is facially unconstitutional,\n21 unconstitutional as applied, unconstitutionally vague, and a violation of the Equal Protection\n22 Clause.  Now pending before the Court are the partiesโ cross-motions for summary judgment. \n23 For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Defendantโs motion for summary\n24 judgment and DENIES Plaintiffโs motion for summary judgment.\n25 I.  BACKGROUND\n26 In the city of Oakland, California are multiple clinics which provide reproductive\n27 healthcare services to women.  Because one of those services is abortion, the clinics have\n28 long been the sites of protest over the morality and legality of that medical procedure. \nThough each protest, like each protestor, is different, there is a long history of protests\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page2 of 25\n1 creating significant barriers to patient access at the Oakland clinics.  The executive director\n2 of one clinic described the protests as follows:\n3 The anti-abortion protestors are so aggressive and invasive, that the [clinic] was\nforced to stop operating on Saturdays due to excessive protesting.  The [clinic] has\n4 had situations where roughly three hundred protestors showed up to protest the\nclinicโs abortion practices.  Patients have had to climb through the back windows and\n5 fire escapes of the [clinic] to obtain health services, because anti-abortion protestors\nblockaded the front door of the clinic. Comy Decl. at 2.\n6\nThe executive director of another clinic explained, โBefore the Bubble Ordinance was\n7\nenacted, I witnessed protestors blocking the way of patients as they tried to enter the clinic. . .\n8\n. I have witnessed protestors swarming patientโs vehicles . . . thereby preventing the patients\n9\nfrom exiting the car and entering the clinic.โ  Barbic Decl. at 2.  A security guard at one\n10\nclinic for the past three years stated:\na\nni 11\ntor Before the Ordinance was passed, I observed protestors approaching and talking to\nrf\nuli 12 patients . . .

In a December 2007 hearing on Plaintiffโs\no\nteN\nnie  17 application for a temporary restraining order, this Court expressed its concern that the\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Ordinance contained impermissible viewpoint-based language, prohibiting only counseling\nF\n19 designed to โpersuade [an] individual not to access . . . reproductive health services.โ  At this\n20 Courtโs strong suggestion, the City agreed to amend the Ordinance by removing that\n21 language.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 12.  In February 2008, the City passed the amended Ordinance\n22 at issue in this case.  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 6.\n23 That amended Ordinance lists the relevant prohibited conduct under the heading of\n24 โProhibited Harassment of Individuals Seeking Access to Health Care Facilities.โ  Id. at 5. \n25 Section 3(a) prohibits โforce, threat of force, or physical obstructionโ to โinjure, harass,\n26 intimidate, or interfere with . . . any person because that person . . . is . . . providing or\n27 obtaining reproductive healthcare services.โ  Section 3(b) states: โWithin 100 feet of the\n28 entrance of a reproductive health care facility, it shall be unlawful to willfully and knowingly\n3\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page4 of 25\n1 approach within eight (8) feet of any person seeking to enter such a facility, or any occupied\n2 motor vehicle seeking entry, without the consent of such person or vehicle occupant, for the\n3 purpose of counseling, harassing, or interfering with such person or vehicle occupant.โ  Id.1 \n4 The Ordinance defines โeight feetโ as being measured from โany extension of the body of the\n5 individual seeking accessโ to โany extension of the body of, or any sign or object held by[,]\n6 another person.โ  Id. at 4.

The parties now\na\nni 11 each seek summary judgment of Plaintiffโs claims that the Ordinance is facially\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 unconstitutional, unconstitutional as applied, unconstitutionally vague, and a violation of the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 Equal Protection Clause.

Id.\n21 A principal purpose of the summary judgment procedure is to isolate and dispose of\n22 factually unsupported claims.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323-24 (1986).

Cityโs Mot. at 8.  At one point, a clinic director used a\nmeasuring tape to show Plaintiff that he was within eight feet of clinic patients.  Id.  On January 15,\n28 2009, Plaintiff was convicted for violating the Ordinance.  Id.

Once the moving party has met its initial burden, the burden shifts to the\n3 nonmoving party to establish the existence of an element essential to that partyโs case, and on\n4 which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S.\n5 317, 323-24 (1986).  To discharge this burden, the nonmoving party cannot rely on its\n6 pleadings, but instead must have evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  See\n7 id. at 324.\n8 Special rules of construction apply to evaluating summary judgment motions: (1) all\n9 reasonable doubts as to the existence of genuine issues of material fact should be resolved\n10 against the moving party; and (2) all inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts must\na\nni 11 be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.

Facial Challenge\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 A government may impose reasonable restrictions on time, place, or manner of\no\nteN\nnie  17 protected speech, so long as the restrictions โare justified without reference to the content of\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 the regulated speech . . . are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,\nF\n19 and . . . leave open ample alternative channels for communication.โ  Ward v. Rock Against\n20 Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989).  Plaintiff argues that the Ordinance is content- and\n21 viewpoint-based on its face because it was passed with discriminatory intent, is directed only\n22 at reproductive healthcare clinics, and restricts โprotest, education and counselingโ while\n23 leaving other speech unrestricted.  Plaintiffโs Opp. at 12.3  However, the Supreme Court\n24\n25 3Plaintiff also argues that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the need for the\nOrdinance.  Plaintiffโs Opp. at 15-16.  This is not so.  While Plaintiff disputes some of the individual\n26 historical facts the City presented in support of the passage of the Ordinance, there is no genuine issue\nof material fact as to whether there was, on the whole, sufficient evidence of historical access problems.\n27 The evidence the City relied on was reasonably believed to be relevant to the problem it addressed.  See\nGammoh v. City of La Habra, 395 F.3d 1114, 1126 (9th Cir. 2005); see also McCullen v. Coakley, 2009\n28 WL 1942069 at *6 (1st Cir. 2009) (test for content-neutrality requires only that evidence support\nlegislatureโs  conclusion  that  regulation  serves  โa  legitimate  governmental  interest  unrelated  to\n5\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page6 of 25\n1 upheld the facial content-neutrality of an eight-foot bubble law nearly identical to the\n2 Ordinance at issue here.  See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000).  Accordingly, Plaintiffโs\n3 facial challenge fails.\n4 The City has introduced sufficient evidence that the problem it sought to address with\n5 the Ordinance was not objectionable speech, but conduct that restricted patientsโ access to\n6 reproductive healthcare clinics.  See, e.g., Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 2 (Ordinance preamble states\n7 that โpersons attempting to access reproductive health care facilities . . . have been subject to\n8 harassing or intimidating activity from extremely close proximity, tending to hamper or\n9 impede their access to those facilities and servicesโ).  The Court recalls that the original\n10 version of the Ordinance contained viewpoint-based language, but even assuming the illicit\na\nni 11 legislative motive Plaintiff urges, courts โwill not strike down an otherwise constitutional\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.โ  United States v. OโBrien, 391\noa\nCC\nct of  13 U.S. 367, 383 (1968).  The Court in Hill explained that โthe contention that a statute is\nrict \nstri 14 โviewpoint basedโ simply because its enactment was motivated by the conduct of the\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 partisans on one side of a debate is without support.โ  530 U.S. at 724.  See also Menotti v.\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 City of Seattle, 409 F.3d 1113, 1129 (9th Cir. 2005) (โThat Order No. 3 predominantly\no\nteN\nnie  17 affected protestors with anti-WTO views did not render it content based.โ).  \nUh\nt\n \nor 18 As in Hill, the Ordinance applies โequally to all demonstrators, regardless of\nF\n19 viewpoint, and the statutory language makes no reference to the content of the speech.โ  530\n20 U.S. at 719.  And, as in Hill, โthe Stateโs interest[] in protecting access . . . [is] unrelated to\n21 the content of the demonstratorsโ speech.โ  Id. at 719-20.  Indeed, the Court in Hill found that\n22 Coloradoโs statute was โnot a regulation of speechโ but โa regulation of the places where\n23 some speech may occur.โ  Id. at 719 (internal quotations omitted).  Any speaker was\n24 permitted to โattempt to educate unwilling listeners on any subject, but without consent may\n25 not approach within eight feet to do so.โ  Id. at 723.  The same is true here.\n26 Plaintiff tries to distinguish Hill because the statute there applied to โany entity that is\n27 licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by law to administer medical\n28\nexpressive content;โ courts must give โsignificantโ respect to legislatureโs judgment).     \n6\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page7 of 25\n1 treatment in this state,โ while the Ordinance here is limited to reproductive healthcare clinics. \n2 Plaintiffโs Mot. at 15.  Hill did comment favorably on the โcomprehensivenessโ of\n3 Coloradoโs statute.  530 U.S. at 731.  More relevant, however, is the Courtโs holding that:\n4 [F]lawed is [the] theory that a statute restricting speech becomes unconstitutionally\ncontent based because of its application to the specific locations where that discourse\n5 occurs.  A statute prohibiting solicitation in airports that was motivated by the\naggressive approaches of Hare Krishnas does not become content based solely\n6 because its application is confined to airportsโ the specific locations where that\ndiscourse occurs.  530 U.S. at 724 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n7\nThe Ordinance is not unconstitutional simply because it is limited to conduct within 100 feet\n8\nof the entrance of a reproductive healthcare clinic; the entrances of reproductive healthcare\n9\nclinics are where discourse about reproductive healthcare often occurs.  See also McGuire v.\n10\nReilly, 260 F.3d 36, 44 (1st Cir. 2001) (hereinafter โMcGuire Iโ) (โWe conclude, without\na\nni 11\ntor much question, that the Actโs stated goals justify its specific application to [reproductive\nrf\nuli 12\noa\nCC healthcare clinics]โ).  \nct of  13\nrict  Plaintiffโs argument that the statute is unconstitutional on its face because it restricts\nstri 14\nit\nDs\ni โprotest, education and counseling,โ while leaving other types of speech unrestricted,\n D\ns\ne  15\ntn\ntaer Plaintiffโs Mot. at 15, is also unavailing.  Courts have long upheld regulations targeting\nSh\nd rt 16\nteNo specific categories of speech as long as they meet the standards for permissible time, place\nnie  17\nUh and manner regulations.  See, e.g., Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of W. N.Y., 519 U.S.\nt\n \nor 18\nF\n357, 380 (1997) (upholding injunction prohibiting โdemonstrationsโ around clinic entrances).\n19\nIn Hill, as here, the plaintiff complained that โan individual near a health care facility\n20\nwho knowingly approaches a pedestrian to say โgood morningโ or to randomly recite lines\n21\nfrom a novel would not be subject to the statuteโs restrictions,โ and so โ[b]ecause the content\n22\nof the oral statements made by the approaching speaker must sometimes be examined,โ the\n23\nstatute must be content-based.  Hill, 530 U.S. at 720; see also Plaintiffโs Mot. at 16.  The\n24\nCourt dispensed with this argument, explaining, \n25\nIt is common in the law to examine the content of a communication to determine the\n26 speakerโs purpose.  Whether a particular statement constitutes a threat, blackmail, an\nagreement to fix prices . . . often depends on the precise content of the statement.  We\n27 have never held, or suggested, that it is improper to look at the content of an oral or\nwritten statement in order to determine whether a rule of law applies to a course of\n28 conduct.  Id. at 721.  \n7\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page8 of 25\n1 The Court explained that while it might sometimes be necessary to examine the content of\n2 statements made from within eight feet, โthat review need be no more extensive than a\n3 determination whether a general prohibition of โpicketingโ or โdemonstratingโ applies to\n4 innocuous speech.โ  Id.  While Oaklandโs Ordinance will sometimes require a police officer\n5 to examine the content of speech, that inquiry is permissible under Hill.  530 U.S. at 720-21.\n6 The Ordinance is content- and viewpoint-neutral on its face.\n7 Notably, Plaintiff asked this Court at the motion hearing and again in its post-hearing\n8 supplemental brief to consider the testimony of Captain Toribio of the Oakland Police\n9 Department, in addition to the Ordinance itself, as part of Plaintiffโs facial challenge.  In\n10 making this argument, Plaintiff relied principally on Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nationalist\na\nni 11 Movement, 505 U.S. 123, 131 (1992), in which the Supreme Court stated that โ[i]n\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 evaluating respondentโs facial challenge,โ the Court would โconsider the countyโs\noa\nCC\nct of  13 authoritative construction of the ordinance, including its own implementation and\nrict \nstri 14 interpretation of it.โ  But Forsyth does not support Plaintiffโs argument.  The plaintiff in\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 Forsyth had argued that an ordinance โ[did] not prescribe adequate standardsโ for an\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 administrator setting a permit fee, and so the Court looked to the countyโs implementation of\no\nteN\nnie  17 the ordinance to try to find โnarrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards.โ  505 U.S. at\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 130-33.  \nF\n19 The cases relied on by Forsyth demonstrate that courts look beyond the face of a law\n20 to its implementation in search of narrowing constructions.  See Ward, 491 U.S. at 795-96\n21 (โ[i]n evaluating a facial challenge to a state law, a federal court must . . . consider any\n22 limiting construction that a state court or enforcement agency has proferredโ); City of\n23 Lakewood v.

Wilson, 405 U.S. 518, 524-28 (1972) (finding that nothing had been\n28 done to narrow the construction of an overly broad statute).

City of Santa Monica, 450 F.3d\n5 1022, 1035 (9th Cir. 2006) (discussing โlimiting constructionโ of ordinance).\n6 Courts search for narrowing constructions because, as the Court explained in Frisby v.\n7 Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 483 (1988), another case Plaintiff relies on, it is a โwell-established\n8 principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties.โ   Plaintiff has\n9 not directed this Court to any authority in which courts have looked beyond a facially\n10 constitutional law to its implementation in order to find it facially unconstitutional.

As-Applied Challenge\n21 i. Actions of Clinic Escorts\n22 Plaintiff argues that the Ordinance is content- and viewpoint-based as\n23 applied, because it is enforced in such a way that it prohibits pro-life activists from\n24 approaching women to ask if they would like to hear about alternatives to abortion, but\n25 allows individuals Plaintiff describes as pro-choice activists to โinvite women into the clinic,\n26 tell them to disregard Plaintiffโs message, and advocate a pro-abortion position.โ  Plaintiffโs\n27\n28 4This is how Plaintiff addressed the matter in his briefing prior to the motion hearing.

His chief complaint is with the presence and actions of clinic escorts, the\n2 volunteers who help patients into the clinics.  The Ordinance recognizes โvolunteers who,\n3 with the consent of the reproductive health care facility, assist in conducting patients of such\n4 facility safely into the facility,โ along with doctors, nurses and clinic employees, as\n5 individuals who โ[provide] reproductive health services.โ  Laden Decl.

The escorts work on an โas-needed basis,โ only offering assistance when pro-life\n10 protestors are present.

He\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 complains that escorts walk alongside the women, between him and the patients, and either\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 talk to the patients, or โsimply make noise to drown out Plaintiffโs voice.โ  Id.  He also states\no\nteN\nnie  17 that on some occasions he has seen escorts snatch his literature out of the womenโs hands. \nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Hoye Supp. Decl. at 3. See also Hitchcock Supp. Decl. at 3; Downer Decl. at 3; Kendall\nF\n19 Decl. at 3.  \n20 As an initial matter, simply facilitating a patientโs access to reproductive healthcare\n21 services is not pro-choice advocacy.  If it were, the Supreme Court in Hill could not have\n22 found that Coloradoโs bubble statute, which was, among other things, intended to facilitate\n23 access, was either content- or viewpoint-neutral.  See 530 U.S. at 725.  If it were, the First\n24 Circuit in McGuire I could not have found that Massachusettsโs bubble statute, which\n25\n26 5Barbara Hoke, the escort coordinator, presents a different picture, stating that the escorts  โask\nfor consent to assist the patient into the clinic.โ  Hoke Decl. at 2.  She states that the escorts immediately\n27 back away if the patients decline their offers of help, that escorts speak softly to avoid intimidating\npatients, and that if a patient is present, the escorts โdo not engage the protestors in conversation.โ  Id.\n28 Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Order, the Court will construe all facts in the light most favorable\nto Plaintiff.\n10\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page11 of 25\n1 explicitly exempted clinic agents and employees, was either content- or viewpoint-neutral. \n2 260 F.3d at 46 (โsince a primary purpose of the law is to facilitate safe access, the employee\n3 exemption serves the basic objectives of the Actโ).6  See also McCullen, 2009 WL 1942069\n4 at *7 (finding, as to the Massachusetts law that replaced the law at issue in the McGuire\n5 cases, that โexception for persons associated with [reproductive healthcare clinics] remains\n6 reasonably related to the legislatureโs legitimate public safety objectivesโ).  Escorts who\n7 simply facilitate access are thus distinct from the hypothetical pro-choice demonstrator\n8 imagined by Justice Kennedy in Hill who โchants in praise of the Supreme Court and its\n9 abortion decisions.โ  530 U.S. at 725.   \n10 Nor does simply facilitating access violate the Ordinance, which forbids the knowing\na\nni 11 and unconsented approach within eight feet of a patient โfor the purpose of counseling,\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 harassing, or interfering.โ  Laden Decl.

Escorts who approach women for the\noa\nCC\nct of  13 purpose of facilitating their access into a clinic are not approaching โfor the purpose of\nrict \nstri 14 counseling, harassing, or interfering.โ  This is so even under the Ordinanceโs broad definition\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 of counseling, which includes โengaging in conversation with.โ  Id. at 4.  Engaging in\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 conversation with patients is secondary to facilitating access, and allowing escorts to talk to\no\nteN\nnie  17 patients for the limited purpose of facilitating patient access is consistent with the\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Ordinanceโs purpose. \nF\n19 To the extent that escorts deviate from their role of simply facilitating access and\n20 engage instead in pro-choice advocacy, they do so in violation of the Ordinance.  In such a\n21 scenario, the escorts would be approaching patients โfor the purpose of counseling,\n22 harassing, or interfering.โ  See Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 5.  Plaintiff cannot prevail on his as-\n23 applied challenge without first providing proof that this has happened.  Thus the court in\n24 McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 47, a facial challenge, invited plaintiffs to return with an as-applied\n25 challenge to the Massachusetts bubble statute โif, as the plaintiffs predict, experience shows\n26 that clinic staffers in fact are utilizing the exemption as a means either of proselytizing or of\n27\n28 6The Ordinance here has no escort exemption, but does recognize escorts as people who provide\nreproductive health services and are thus protected under Section 3(a).  \n11\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page12 of 25\n1 engaging in preferential pro-choice advocacy.โ  In their as-applied challenge three years\n2 later, McGuire II, 386 F.3d at 50-52, plaintiffs complained of escortsโ actions that are\n3 remarkably similar to Plaintiffโs complaints here: escorts sometimes told patients they did not\n4 need to listen to the pro-life protestors, took the pro-life protestorsโ literature out of patients\n5 hands, chattered loudly to drown the pro-life protestors out, and โrepeated โ[p]ro-abortion\n6 rhetoric,โ such as โWe have help. Weโll help you get inside.โ  The court found that such\n7 actions by the escorts โare not violations of the Act.โ  Id. at 64-65. \n8 Plaintiff has provided no evidence that escorts have ever, as he claims, โadvocate[d] a\n9 pro-abortion position.โ  See Plaintiffโs Mot. at 12-13.  Of course, the Cityโs declarants say\n10 that โescorts do not engage in abortion-related speech when volunteering as escorts,โ and that\na\nni 11 escorts โdo not counsel patients.โ  See, e.g., Hoke Decl. at 2; see also Barbic Decl. at 4\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 (โPatients do not consult with escorts about any medical decisions.โ).  Neither side contends\noa\nCC\nct of  13 that escorts wear clothing conveying political messages, distribute fliers, or hold signs\nrict \nstri 14 displaying a message.  Plaintiffโs support for this assertion consists simply of the Cityโs\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 alleged lack of an enforcement policy for escorts (discussed below), Barbara Hokeโs\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 deposition testimony about Plaintiffโs leaflets, given in Plaintiffโs criminal trial, and the\no\nteN\nnie  17 escortโs flexible, self-written guidelines, an exhibit to Hokeโs deposition.  Plaintiffโs Opp. at\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 17.  The Court declines to take judicial notice of the deposition testimony given by clinic\nF\n19 escorts in Plaintiffโs criminal trial.  Such testimony is hearsay and does not meet the\n20 requirements of the former testimony exception in Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1). \n21 There is no evidence that any of the escorts are unavailable, and the City did not have a\n22 similar motive to develop the escortsโ testimony in Plaintiffโs criminal trial as it would in the\n23 present case.7  Even if the guidelines were admissible evidence, they are not proof that\n24 escorts engaged in advocacy.\n25 Nevertheless, Plaintiffโs proof does go beyond that in McGuire II.  Specifically,\n26 Plaintiff states that at times when he has held a sign stating, โJesus loves you and your baby. \n27\n28 7The Court does take judicial notice of Plaintiffโs testimony in his criminal case, as it is a party\nadmission.  Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).\n12\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page13 of 25\n1 Let us help,โ escorts have held blank signs in front of it.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 6.  The Court\n2 viewed with great displeasure video clips taken over the course of two days in which escorts\n3 can be seen intermittently walking alongside Plaintiff and blocking Plaintiffโs sign with their\n4 own, all-white signs.  See Millen Decl. Ex.D.  Other pro-life demonstrators have also had\n5 their signs blocked.  Hitchcock Supp. Decl. at 2; Kendall Decl. at 2.  While the Court\n6 believes that the escorts are motivated by a desire to minimize patientsโ distress, the Court\n7 considers it a violation of the Ordinance for escorts to hold signs in front of demonstratorsโ\n8 signs in a knowing attempt to block demonstratorsโ messages.  This is so even if the signs the\n9 escorts hold are blank, and even if the escort holding the blank sign is herself more than eight\n10 feet away from a patient, so long as she is working in concert with an escort who is actively\na\nni 11 escorting a patient.8  The Court notes that this practice appears to have been sporadic, see\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Lubin Decl. Ex. 3 (video footage taken from the same days as Plaintiffโs video footage,\noa\nCC\nct of  13 showing Plaintiff holding sign without being blocked); Hitchcock Supp. Decl. at 2 (โ[o]ther\nrict \nstri 14 times, they would . . . [block] our signsโ); and Cole Decl. Exs. 2 and 3 (photographs from\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 March 2009 showing unencumbered display of pro-life signs/messages outside Oakland\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 clinics), and that the City represented at the motion hearing that it has ceased.9  \no\nteN\nnie  17 ii. State Action\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Despite the evidence that escorts did not always act โas escortsโ and\nF\n19 simply facilitate patient access, Plaintiffโs as-applied challenge has a fatal flaw.  Just as in\n20 McGuire II, 386 F.3d at 60, what Plaintiff objects to is purely private action, and โ[t]he First\n21 Amendment is concerned with government interference, not private jousting in the speech\n22 marketplace.โ  As the First Circuit explained, โthere is no state action if what the plaintiff is\n23 really aiming at are the acts of private persons that are actually illegal under the statutory\n24\n25\n26 8Of course, escorts also may not physically block demonstrators; the Ordinance, not the escorts,\nshould protect patients from unconsented approaches within eight feet for improper purposes. \n27\n9In support of this contention, the City cited to the testimony of escort Lucy Kasdin in Plaintiffโs\n28 criminal trial.  As already discussed, the Court declines to take judicial notice of such testimony, as it\nis hearsay.\n13\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page14 of 25\n1 scheme, because then the acts do not reflect the policy of the state.โ  Id.  Plaintiffโs fight is\n2 with the escorts; he has failed to show unlawful action by the City.\n3 Plaintiff must show that although the law is facially neutral, the City is applying it in a\n4 viewpoint discriminatory manner.  See id. (โ[t]he only challenge they have left in this case is\n5 to the way the law has been enforcedโ).  He must show a pattern of unlawful favoritism.  See\n6 Thomas v. Chi. Park Dist., 534 U.S. 316, 325 (2002) (โGranting waivers to favored speakers\n7 (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be\n8 unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of\n9 unlawful favoritism appears.โ).  Though the clinics have presumably been open for several\n10 hundred days since the amended Ordinance was passed in February 2008, Plaintiff points to\na\nni 11 just two incidents that he claims demonstrate selective enforcement of the Ordinance.  \nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 First, he argues that Deputy City Attorney Vicki Laden was present at one clinic on\noa\nCC\nct of  13 April 29, 2008, after which she notified police that Plaintiff had violated the Ordinance that\nrict \nstri 14 day, but did not mention โthat escorts were approaching patients and speaking to them.โ \nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 Plaintiffโs Mot. at 10.  Plaintiff does not reveal the contents of the escortsโ statements to the\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 patients that day, and there is no indication that the speech constituted pro-choice advocacy,\no\nteN\nnie  17 let alone that Laden was aware of such advocacy.  In fact, in the Cityโs responses to\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Plaintiffโs second set of requests for admission, the City explicitly denied that Vicki Laden\nF\n19 had witnessed escorts approaching within eight feet of patients without consent for the\n20 purpose of engaging them in conversation.  Millen Decl. Ex. H at 4.  The Cityโs actions\n21 therefore appear to be consistent with the Ordinance. \n22 Second, Plaintiff relates an incident on June 3, 2008 in which demonstrator Virginia\n23 Hitchcock witnessed โescorts approaching women heading toward the clinic, without the\n24 womenโs consent, and speaking to them.โ  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 10.  This is the only example\n25 Plaintiff provides of pro-life demonstrators calling the police to report the alleged misdeeds\n26 of escorts.  Hitchcock and a friend (Mary Arnold) notified the police, who responded and\n27 explained that the escorts were not subject to the Ordinance because they are โprofessionals.โ \n28 Id. at 10-11.  In fact, Hitchcock testified in her deposition simply that โthere was a lot of\n14\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page15 of 25\n1 activity with the escorts and the staffโ and that she had not seen anything she thought was\n2 illegal.  Reding Decl. Ex .2 at 13.  She also testified that upon arriving, the police โtalked to\n3 the escorts and the staff,โ Id. at 14-15, presumably investigating her report.  Plaintiff\n4 submitted no evidence that the escortsโ speech that day was pro-choice advocacy, or that the\n5 police were aware of any such advocacy.  The officerโs statement that the escorts are\n6 โprofessionals,โ as well as Hitchcockโs deposition testimony that the police said โit doesnโt\n7 apply to them,โ either reflects the policeโs misstatement of the law (the Ordinance does apply\n8 to escorts who are not acting as escorts), or the policeโs conclusion that the escorts had been\n9 acting as escorts.  The latter is at least as reasonable an interpretation, as even Hitchcock had\n10 not seen anything she thought was illegal.   \na\nni 11 Notably, the only evidence in the record that the police were aware that escorts\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 sometimes held blank signs in front of demonstratorsโ signs is also from the July 3, 2008\noa\nCC\nct of  13 incident.  In an email Mary Arnold wrote about the incident, she mentioned that she had told\nrict \nstri 14 the responding officer that since the ordinance was passed, she had โwitnessed one escort . . .\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 hold up a large sign in order to prevent women from reading [Plaintiffโs] sign.โ  Reding Decl.\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 Ex. 1 at 38.  Arnoldโs email describes the officer as being โpleasant and courteousโ and\no\nteN\nnie  17 saying, โItโs best if a judge decides but I do want the report to be made.โ  Id.  The record\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 does not reflect whether Arnold ever followed up on this.   Aside from the incidents of\nF\n19 April 29, 2008 and June 3, 2008, Plaintiff is forced to argue not about how the Ordinance has\n20 been enforced, but about how it might be enforced in the future.  Plaintiff points to the\n21 30(b)(6) testimony of Captain Toribio of the Oakland Police Department, who testified about\n22 the Cityโs interpretation of the Ordinance.  Toribio testified that it would not be a violation of\n23 the Ordinance for an escort to tell a woman, โItโs your right to have an abortion.โ  Millen\n24 Decl. Ex. F at 57.  Toribio agreed that โthe Cityโs Enforcement Policy is not to enforce the\n25 Bubble Ordinance against escorts acting as escorts.โ  Millen Decl. Ex. F at 48.  He also said:\n26 โif the escort is performing within or doing something within the scope of their duties to\n27 facilitate entrance and exit, there are no concerns.โ  Reding Decl. Ex. 4 at 14-15. \n28\n15\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page16 of 25\n1 It is consistent with both the Ordinance and Hill not to enforce the Ordinance against\n2 escorts who are โacting as escortsโโ that is, escorts who are simply facilitating patient access. \n3 However, the Court finds that, provided the other requirements of Section 3(b) were met,\n4 Capt. Toribio was wrong when he testified that it would not violate the Ordinance for an\n5 escort to tell a patient, โItโs your right to have an abortion.โ  See Millen Decl. Ex. F at 57. \n6 While such a statement arguably facilitates access, it goes beyond that narrow function and\n7 may constitute โcounselingโ under the Ordinance.  See Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 5.10  Toribioโs\n8 testimony was given in response to a question which Defendantโs counsel objected to as\n9 speculative and an incomplete hypothetical.  Certainly it was that (an escort could\n10 permissibly tell a woman it was her right to have an abortion if the two were standing in line\na\nni 11 at a supermarket across town from a clinic), but more importantly, it is not evidence that\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 escorts make such statements, or that the police turn a blind eye to them.  An answer to a\noa\nCC\nct of  13 hypothetical is not evidence that discrimination has occurred. See, e.g., Boyd v. City of\nrict \nstri 14 Oakland, 458 F. Supp. 2d 1015, 1043 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (police captainโs conjectural\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 responses to hypothetical questions did not constitute admissible evidence of discrimination). \ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 As in McGuire II, โthere is no evidence that the police turned a blind eye toward pro-abortion\no\nteN\nnie  17 speech while not turning a blind eye to possible transgressions by plaintiff[].โ  386 F.3d at\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 65.\nF\n19 Plaintiff has provided no evidence that the police have targeted pro-life demonstrators. \n20 Compare Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1148 (finding genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n21 police were unfairly targeting only anti-WTO protestors).  He claims that no clinic escort\n22 having been arrested or prosecuted for violating the Ordinance is evidence of disparate\n23 enforcement.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 11.  Of course it is not, barring any evidence that escorts\n24 violated the Ordinance and that police were aware of it.  Moreover, the only arrest Plaintiff\n25 cites to of a pro-life demonstrator under the Ordinance is his own, following repeated\n26\n10Escorts may of course say such things as: โwould you like help getting into the clinic,โ โthe\n27 clinic is this way,โ โyou can follow me to the clinic,โ and โthe clinic opens in 10 minutes.โ  The\ndistinction between these statements and โitโs your right to have an abortionโ is that the latter purports\n28 to advise the woman about her rights and arguably addresses not only her access to the clinic but what\nshe could or should do once inside it.\n16\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page17 of 25\n1 violations.  Cityโs Mot. at 22.  In fact, Plaintiff testified that the police have โbeen great,\n2 actually . . . . they[] hear our side of it, their side of it.โ  See Reding Decl. Ex. 3 at 14-15. \n3 Plaintiff has not demonstrated a pattern of selective enforcement.  See Brown v. City of\n4 Pittsburgh, 543 F. Supp. 2d 448, 486 (W.D. Penn. 2008) (holding that plaintiff failed to show\n5 a pattern of unlawful behavior based on two incidents of police enforcement of city bubble\n6 ordinance). \n7 Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the City is enforcing the Ordinance in a\n8 discriminatory manner; the Ordinance is content- and viewpoint-neutral as applied to\n9 Plaintiff.\n10 2. Whether the Ordinance is Narrowly Tailored to Serve the Asserted\nGovernmental Interest\na\nni 11\ntor The Ordinance must also be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government\nrf\nuli 12\noa\nCC interest.  Ward, 491 U.S. at 791.  Plaintiff argues that protecting womenโs access to\nct of  13\nrict  reproductive healthcare clinics is not a significant interest, and that the City has not justified\nstri 14\nit\nDs\ni the Ordinance.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 23-24.  Plaintiff characterizes Madsen v. Womenโs Health\n D\ns\ne  15\ntn\ntaer Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753 (1994) as having found that โthe interest in protecting access to an\nSh\nd rt 16\nteNo abortion clinic did not justify a restriction on unconsented approaches.โ  Id. at 24.  But the\nnie  17\nUh Court in Madsen cited approvingly a Florida Supreme Court holding that โthe State has a\nt\n \nor 18\nF\nstrong interest in protecting a womanโs freedom to seek lawful medical or counseling\n19\nservices in connection with her pregnancy,โ and found that interest and other relevant\n20\ninterests โquite sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them.โ  512\n21\nU.S. at 767-68.  That the Court went on to find that a prohibition of any unconsented\n22\napproach within 300 feet of a clinic was not narrowly tailored,  Id. at 760, 773-74, is not\n23\ndispositive here, where the Ordinance only prohibits approaches within eight feet of patients\n24\nwho are within 100 feet of a clinic entrance.  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 5.\n25\nMoreover, the Court in Hill acknowledged that the stateโs interest in protecting the\n26\nhealth and safety of its citizens โmay justify a special focus on unimpeded access to health\n27\ncare facilities and the avoidance of potential trauma to patients associated with\n28\nconfrontational protests.โ  530 U.S. at 715.  The Court went on to hold: \n17\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page18 of 25\n1 Persons who are attempting to enter health care facilitiesโ for any purposeโ are often\nin particularly vulnerable physical and emotional conditions.  The State of Colorado\n2 has responded to its substantial and legitimate interest in protecting these persons\nfrom unwanted encounters, confrontations, and even assaults by enacting an\n3 exceedingly modest restriction on the speakersโ ability to approach.  Id. at 729.\n4 The City enacted the Ordinance in response to more than ten yearsโ of complaints\n5 about protest activities at Oakland clinics, following four separate meetings at which it heard\n6 testimony from both pro-choice and pro-life representatives, and having concluded that\n7 โexisting federal and state laws do not adequately protect the rights of those seeking or\n8 providing reproductive health care services.โ11  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 3.  See Nadel Decl. at 2;\n9 Cityโs Mot. at 7; Laden Decl. Exs. 7-10.  The Cityโs interests in protecting womenโs access\n10 to reproductive healthcare clinics is thus both justified and โsubstantial and legitimateโ under\na\nni 11 Hill. \nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Plaintiff also asserts that the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to restrict only\noa\nCC\nct of  13 unwanted approaches.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 25-29.  He urges a reading of Hill in which the\nrict \nstri 14 Court โdid not understand the statute to prohibit the speaker from approaching in the absence\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 of the person taking some action to prevent that approach.โ  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 26.  This\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 reading is incorrect.  The bubble statute in Hill also expressly prohibiting approach without\no\nteN\nnie  17 consent.  530 U.S. at 708 n.1.\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 Plaintiff urges that the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to prohibit unconsented\nF\n19 approaches, but all approaches, due to โthe layout of the sidewalk and street surrounding the\n20 clinicโ and the limited window he has to reach patients who are dropped off in front of the\n21 clinic.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 27-28.  He claims a โnecessity of approaching significantly closer\n22 than eight feet in order to communicate with women seeking to enter the clinic.โ  Id. at 28. \n23 This argument also fails, as Hill approved an eight-foot bubble ordinance without limitation\n24 to particular physical settings.  530 U.S. at 703.  Just as in Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1133-34,\n25\n26 11See also Laden Decl. Ex. 4 at 5-6 (10/23/07 letter to Oakland Public Safety Committee,\nexplaining among other things that Californiaโs FACE law does not prohibit harassing or counseling\n27 as defined in the Ordinance and does not establish a zone of protection around an individual); and Hill,\n530 U.S. at 729 (โthe statuteโs prophylactic aspect is justified by the great difficulty of protecting, say,\n28 a pregnant woman from physical harassment with legal rules that focus exclusively on the individual\nimpact of each instance of behavior.โ).\n18\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page19 of 25\n1 where the Ninth Circuit found that an order โcovered only enough territory for the WTO\n2 delegates and the President to move safely from their hotels to the [WTO] convention and\n3 lasted only during the conference,โ the Ordinance is narrowly tailored to only limit\n4 approaches within eight-feet of people entering the clinic, thus allowing safe access.  See\n5 also McCullen, 2009 WL 1942069 at *7-11 (finding that law establishing a 35-foot buffer\n6 zone around reproductive healthcare clinics was narrowly tailored).  The Court also notes\n7 that while Plaintiff appears to take a relatively mild-mannered approach to demonstrating, the\n8 Ordinance must take into account that not all demonstrators or potential demonstrators are\n9 Plaintiff.  The Ordinance is narrowly tailored.\n10 3. Whether the Ordinance Leaves Open Ample Alternative Channels of\nCommunication\na\nni 11\ntor A content-neutral time, place and manner restriction that is narrowly tailored to serve\nrf\nuli 12\noa\nCC a significant government interest must also leave open ample alternative means of\nct of  13\nrict  communication.  Ward, 491 U.S. at 798.  Plaintiff argues that while the Court in Hill, a facial\nstri 14\nit\nDs\ni challenge, found that โ[s]igns, pictures, and voice itself can cross an 8-foot gap with ease,โ\n D\ns\ne  15\ntn\ntaer 530 U.S. at 729, they cannot so easily reach patients in Oakland.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 17-18. \nSh\nd rt 16\nteNo Plaintiff complains of the escorts blocking his sign, standing between him and patients, and\nnie  17\nUh making noise to drown out his voice.  Id. at 18.  He complains about the Cityโs enforcement\nt\n \nor 18\nF\npolicy, which he claims bars him from standing still and lifting his arm to hand a patient a\n19\nleaflet.  Id. at 19.  And he complains that the Cityโs enforcement policy permits an escort to\n20\nessentially veto a patientโs consent to Plaintiffโs approach.  Id. at 20.  Plaintiff also argues\n21\nthat the eight-foot bubble makes it โvirtually impossible to start up a conversation with\n22\nsomeone from eight feet away,โ and that there โis no substitute or โample alternativeโ to\n23\napproaching . . . a person . . . to strike up a conversation.โ  Id. at 22.  Plaintiff testified that\n24\nbeing required to stay eight feet away from the patients โjust wouldnโt seem naturalโ and\n25\nโwould seem impolite.โ  Reding Decl. Ex. 3, at 6.  Plaintiff also complains that โthe brief\n26\nperiod of time to speak to women entering the clinic is insufficient to ask for consent to\n27\napproachโ since many women are dropped off just outside the clinic.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 3-4.\n28\n19\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page20 of 25\n1 Addressing these concerns in reverse order, while Plaintiff might prefer to express\n2 himself by striking up a polite conversation with patients from a close distance, โthe First\n3 Amendment does not guarantee the right to communicate oneโs views . . . in any manner that\n4 may be desired.โ  Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1138 (internal citations omitted).  Plaintiff has no\n5 right to communicate at a polite (i.e., close) distance.  See Colacurcio v. City of Kent, 163\n6 F.3d 545, 548 (9th Cir. 1998) (rejecting argument that because โtable-dancingโ is a โunique\n7 form of expression,โ ten-foot distance requirement amounts to a complete ban on a unique\n8 form of expression); McCullen, 2009 WL 1942069 at *9 (โthe Constitution neither\n9 recognizes nor gives special protection to any particular conversational distanceโ). \n10 Nothing in the Ordinance prevents Plaintiff from approaching within eight feet of an\na\nni 11 escort for the purpose of communicating with a patient.  Section 3(b) provides that โit shall\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 be unlawful to willfully and knowingly approach within eight (8) feet of any person seeking\noa\nCC\nct of  13 to enter such a facility. . . without the consent of such person . . . for the purpose of\nrict \nstri 14 counseling, harassing, or interfering with such person.โ  See Laden Decl.

However, under Section 3(a), one may not use force, threat of force, or\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 physical obstructionโ at any distanceโ to harass any person providing reproductive health\no\nteN\nnie  17 services, including escorts. Id.  This is consistent with the Training Bulletin, which identifies\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 escorts on its list of protected individuals.  Laden Decl. Ex. 6 at 2.  It is also consistent with\nF\n19 Hill.  530 U.S. at 708 n.1 (ordinance prohibited unconsented approach of โanother person,โ\n20 not limited to patients).  Nothing prevents a demonstrator from approaching within eight feet\n21 of an escort if the approach is not to harass โthat personโ but to communicate with a patient\n22 eight feet away.    \n23 Next, nothing in the Ordinance prevents a demonstrator from leafleting, provided the\n24 demonstrator is eight feet away from an unconsenting patient.  The Ordinance defines โeight\n25 feetโ as measured from any extension of the body.  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 4.  The Cityโs\n26 Training Bulletin is consistent with this.  Laden Decl. Ex. 6 at 3.  Capt. Toribioโs testimony,\n27 Millen Decl. Ex. F at 84, that a demonstrator who stands still but lifts his arm toward a\n28 patient is โapproachingโ that patient, is consistent with the Ordinance; provided the\n20\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page21 of 25\n1 demonstratorโs outstretched arm is eight feet from the patient, that is not a violation.  As in\n2 Hill, nothing in the Ordinance prevents a leafletter โfrom simply standing near the path of\n3 oncoming pedestrians and proffering his or her material, which the pedestrians can easily\n4 accept.โ  See 530 U.S. at 727.    \n5 Most importantly, while Plaintiff does not have all of his preferred channels of\n6 communication open to him, he still has ample alternative channels.  He can speak to patients\n7 from eight feet away without their consent, from within eight feet with their consent, or from\n8 within eight feet regardless of consent beyond 100 feet of clinic entrances.12  The Court in\n9 Hill held that eight feet โallows the speaker to communicate at a โnormal conversational\n10 distance,โโ and, though Hill was a facial challenge, the Court imagined that there might be\na\nni 11 background noise and other speakers competing for patientsโ attention.  530 U.S. at 726-27.\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Indeed, Plaintiff admits that he โhas had some success in engaging in conversationโ โ\noa\nCC\nct of  13 his preferred means of expressionโ โwith patients since the Ordinance passed,โ though he\nrict \nstri 14 hastens to add that โhis successes were โmany moreโ before the Ordinance.โ  Plaintiffโs Opp.\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 at 9.  As already discussed, while there is evidence that escorts sometimes held signs in front\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 of Plaintiffโs sign, this practice appears to have happened only sporadically.  As in Hill, the\no\nteN\nnie  17 Ordinance places no limitations on signsโ โnumber, size, text or images,โ or on โthe number\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 of speakers or the noise levelโ of oral protest.  530 U.S. at 726.  \nF\n19 The evidence shows that pro-life demonstrators continue to get their message across. \n20 See, e.g., Hoke Decl. at 3-4 (โThe protestors are impossible to miss. . . . I have observed the\n21 protestors holding large signs . . . . I have seen a pickup truck with pro-life stickers parked\n22 across the street. . . . The protestors are very loud.  They sing songs, pray, and pass out\n23 fliers.โ); Barbic Decl. at 6 (โI have seen . . . protestors carry large signs that can be read from\n24 across the street.  They pass out pamphlets.  The protestors sing and pray.  Their voices\n25 easily carry across the street and can be heard inside and outside the clinic.โ); and Quan\n26\n12The Court notes that Plaintiff argued at the motion hearing that the Ordinance creates a โsuper-\n27 escort privilegeโ by taking the eight-foot bubble from Hill and applying it within 100 feet from the\nclinicโs entrance.  But the statute in Hill also dealt with an eight-foot bubble that operated within 100\n28 feet of a facilityโs entrance.  530 U.S. at 708 n.1.  The Court characterized that statute as โan\nexceedingly modest restriction on the speakersโ ability to approach.โ Id. at 729.\n21\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page22 of 25\n1 Decl. Exs. 1 and 2 (photographs of pro-life protestors gathered outside Oakland clinic in\n2 March 2009).  This is sufficient.  See Menotti, 409 F.3d at 1138 (โGiven the protestorsโ\n3 ability to communicate directly across the street from most WTO venues, and given the\n4 violence that Order No. 3 was aimed at preventing, we think the better analysis favors the\n5 conclusion that Order No. 3 provided ample alternatives for communication.โ); McCullen,\n6 2009 WL 1942069 at *9 (finding ample alternative channels of communication where law\n7 provided for 35-foot buffer zone around reproductive healthcare facilities, because\n8 demonstrators โcan speak, gesticulate, wear screen-printed T-shirts, display signs, use\n9 loudspeakers, and engage in the whole gamut of lawful expressive activitiesโ from 35-feet\n10 away).13\na\nni 11 4. Whether the Ordinance is Unconstitutionally Vague As Applied\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 Plaintiff next argues that the Ordinance is unconstitutionally vague as applied. \noa\nCC\nct of  13 Plaintiffโs Mot. at 29.  A statute is vague if it either โfails to provide people of ordinary\nrict \nstri 14 intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibitsโ or โauthorizes\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.โ  Hill, 530 U.S. at 732.\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 Some of Plaintiffโs concerns are plainly without merit.  There is nothing\no\nteN\nnie  17 unconstitutionally vague about โvehicle[s] seeking entryโ to the clinic.  See Laden Decl. Ex.\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 2 at 5.  As vehicles cannot drive into clinic waiting rooms, the term is properly interpreted as\nF\n19 vehicles pulling up to the clinicโs parking lot or curb.  Similarly, while โapproachโ is not\n20 defined in the Ordinance, its definition in the Training Bulletin (โto come near or nearer toโ)\n21 is the common definition.  See id., Laden Decl. Ex 6 at 4.  That a demonstrator who stands\n22 still but lifts his arm toward a patient is considered to be โapproachingโ that patient is both\n23 logical and consistent with the Ordinanceโs measurement of eight feet โfrom any extension of\n24\n25 13The Court rejects the argument in Plaintiffโs supplemental brief that Edwards v. City of Coeur\nDโAlene, 262 F.3d 856, 866-67 (9th Cir. 2001) shows that the Ninth Circuit takes a more jealous view\n26 of the โample alternativesโ prong than does the First Circuit.  Plaintiffโs Supp. Brief at 3-4.  The Ninth\nCircuit in Edwards struck down a ban on the use of wooden sticks to hold up signs carried during\n27 parades and assemblies, but did so because at โmass gatherings,โ โit is often difficult to see more than\na few feet in any direction, or to hear anyone who isnโt standing nearby.โ  262 F.3d at 867.  Plaintiff has\n28 not demonstrated that an eight-foot bubble outside clinic entrances presents the same obstacles to\ncommunication as a crowded parade. \n22\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page23 of 25\n1 the body.โ  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 4.  See also Hill, 530 U.S. at 733.  Also โconsent,โ though\n2 undefined in the Ordinance, is certainly clear; โ[t]he likelihood that anyone would not\n3 understand [such a] common word[] seems quite remote.โ  See id. at 732.  \n4 Plaintiff accurately notes that while Section 3(b) of the Ordinance refers to persons\n5 โseeking to enterโ a clinic, the Training Bulletin states (and Capt. Toribio testified) that the\n6 Ordinance is interpreted to include persons both entering and exiting.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 30. \n7 The omission does not render the Ordinance unconstitutionally vague.  The Ordinance\n8 defines โinterfering,โ prohibited by Section 3(b), to include โaccessโ and โegress,โ and\n9 defines โcounseling,โ prohibited by Section 3(b), to include persons โseeking access toโ or\n10 โpassage fromโ clinics.  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 4 and 5.  It also defines โeight feet,โ the\na\nni 11 distance identified in Section 3(b), as relating to a person โseeking access toโ or โpassage\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 fromโ a clinic.  Id.  Thus a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that, as in Hill,\noa\nCC\nct of  13 530 U.S. at 708 n.1, the ordinance โas a wholeโ prohibits interference with persons both\nrict \nstri 14 entering and exiting clinics.  See Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 110 (1972).\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 Plaintiff complains again that it is unclear under the Ordinance whether he can\ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 approach within eight feet of an escort walking with a patient when his intent is only to\no\nteN\nnie  17 communicate with the patient, and whether he can approach within eight feet of an escort\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 standing alone in front of the clinic.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 31-32.  As already discussed, the\nF\n19 Ordinance does not prevent a demonstrator from approaching within eight feet of an escortโ\n20 standing or walkingโ  if the approach is not to harass โthat personโ but to communicate with\n21 someone else eight feet away. \n22 A closer question is what kind of communication is permissible under the Ordinance\n23 between a demonstrator and an unconsenting escort (or patient) within eight feet.  Plaintiffโs\n24 Mot. at 31.  Plaintiff disputes the Cityโs assertion that a demonstrator could approach an\n25 escort to talk about the Super Bowl โbecause the protestor would not be harassing the\n26 escort,โ noting that โthe City overlooks its own extremely broad definition of โharassing.โโ \n27 Plaintiffโs Reply Brief at 14.  Indeed the Cityโs definition of harassing includes โcounseling,โ\n28\n23\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page24 of 25\n1 and its definition of โcounselingโ includes โengaging in conversation with.โ  Laden Decl. Ex.\n2 2 at 4. \n3 This raises a legitimate concern about overbreadth, but it is not fatal.  First, the court\n4 in Hill, 530 U.S. at 732, found in reference to Coloradoโs statute that โprotest, education, or\n5 counselingโ were common words, and that it seemed โquite remoteโ that anyone would not\n6 understand them.  Sections 3(a) and 3(b) fall under the heading of โProhibited Harassment,โ\n7 and the Ordinanceโs preamble states that โpersons desiring or needing access to [reproductive\n8 health care services] should not be intimidated, hampered, impeded, harassed, or restrained\n9 from obtaining those services.โ  Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 2, 5.  It is clear that, as a whole, the\n10 Ordinance prohibits interference with access, not casual conversation about the Super Bowl. \na\nni 11 See Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110; and Hill, 530 U.S. at 740 (Souter, J. concurring) (โSomeone\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 planning to spread a message by accosting strangers is likely to understand the statuteโs\noa\nCC\nct of  13 application to โeducation.โโ).  Second, as in Hill, 530 U.S. at 732, Oaklandโs Ordinance\nrict \nstri 14 contains a scienter requirement that should ameliorate any concern that persons of ordinary\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 intelligence would be trapped by arguably vague language.  See Laden Decl. Ex. 2 at 5. \ntn\nar\nte\nd Srth 16 Third, as in Thomas, 534 U.S. at 324-325, where Plaintiffs complained that the criteria in the\no\nteN\nnie  17 ordinance was โinsufficiently precise,โ any abuse in enforcement is better addressed โif and\nUh\nt\n \nor 18 when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears.โ  See also Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110\nF\n19 (โcondemned to the use of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our\n20 languageโ) and Ward, 491 U.S. at 794 (โperfect clarity and precise guidance have never been\n21 required even of regulations that restrict expressive activityโ).\n22 Accordingly, the Ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague.\n23 5. Whether the Ordinance Violates the Equal Protection Clause\n24 Plaintiffโs final argument, that the Ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clause,\n25 rests on his contention that โthe Ordinance allows speech or speakers favoring abortion\n26 greater latitude than the speech or speakers favoring alternatives to abortion.โ  Plaintiffโs\n27 Opp. at 25.  Arguing that the Ordinance impinges on a fundamental right (speech),  Plaintiff\n28 urges the Court to apply strict scrutiny.  Plaintiffโs Mot. at 33-34.  This argument also fails.\n24\n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document152    Filed08/04/09   Page25 of 25\n1 The Court has already found that the Ordinance is content- and viewpoint-neutral. \n2 Strict scrutiny is โinappropriate where a law regulating speech is content-neutral, even where\n3 the speech at issue was non-commercial.โ  Maldonado v. Morales, 556 F.3d 1037, 1048 (9th\n4 Cir. 2009).  โAt mostโ the Ordinance needs to survive an intermediate level of scrutiny.  See\n5 id.  The Ordinance is substantially related to an important government objective: the Court in\n6 Hill, 530 U.S. at 729, found that protecting access to healthcare is both substantial and\n7 legitimate.  The Ordinance thus โeasily passes the necessary scrutiny to overcome\n8 [Plaintiffโs] equal protection challenge.โ  See Maldonado, 556 F.3d at 1048.  The First\n9 Circuit reached the same conclusion in McGuire I, 260 F.3d at 50, holding that โthe Act\n10 passes muster under the Equal Protection Clause for the same reasons that it passes muster\na\nni 11 under the First Amendment.โ\nr\nto\nrf\nuli 12 IV. CONCLUSION\noa\nCC\nct of  13 For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendantโs motion for summary\nrict \nstri 14 judgment and DENIES Plaintiffโs motion for summary judgment.\nit\nDs\ni\n D\ns\ne  15 IT IS SO ORDERED.\ntn\nar\nte\nSh\nd rt 16\nteNo                                                             \nnie  17 Dated: August 4, 2009   CHARLES  R.

California Constitution, Art. I, ยง2 \n19  4.  California Constitution, Art. I, ยง7 \n5.  California Civil Code ยง52.1 \n20   \n \n21 \n \n22  Plaintiff alleges as follows: \n23    1.   Plaintiff Walter B. Hoye, II, is a natural person.  Motivated by his moral, religious, \n24  and political beliefs, plaintiff has regularly engaged in pro-life, anti-abortion speech activities within \n25  the City.  These speech activities include hand-to-hand leafleting, education about abortion, and \n26  holding signs which say things like โGod loves you & your baby / Let us help youโ.   All of these \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 1 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page2 of 10\n 1  activities occur on public sidewalks or other public fora, where he can convey his message to the \n 2  public. \n 3  2.  Defendant CITY OF OAKLAND (\"City\") is a municipal corporation organized under \n 4  the laws and Constitution of the State of California, and is a corporate entity capable of suing and \n 5  being sued.  Defendant City maintains and operates the City of Oakland Police Department which, \n 6  in the first instance, is responsible for the enforcement of the ordinance in question and the arrest of \n 7  person alleged to have violated it. \n 8  3.  JURISDICTION:   This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Title 28 \n 9  U.S.C. ยงยง1331 and 1343(3) in that the controversy arises under the United States Constitution and \n10  under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 and 28 U.S.C. ยงยง2201 and 2202.  This Court has authority to award \n11  attorneys fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง1988.  Plaintiff further invokes the supplemental jurisdiction \n12  of this Court under 28 U.S.C. ยง1367(a) to hear and adjudicate state law claims.  Each and all of the \n13  acts (or threats of acts) alleged herein were done by defendants, or their officers, agents, and \n14  employees, under color and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs and usages of \n15  the City of Berkeley. \n16  4.  INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT:  Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. \n17  ยง1391(b) because a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claims in this action occurred in \n18  this district. \n19  5.  On or about December 18, 2007,  the City adopted Municipal Code Chapter 8.50, \n20  entitled โAccess to Reproductive Health Care Facilitiesโ (herein the โ original ordinanceโ). On \n21  December 18, 2007, Plaintiff filed this action challenging the constitutionality of the original \n22  ordinance. Following a hearing on Plaintiffโs Application for Temporary Restraining Order, the City, \n23  through its attorneys, agreed not to enforce the original ordinance and to amend that ordinance. On \n24  February 5, 2008, the City amended Chapter 8.50. A copy of the amended ordinance (hereinafter \n25  the โOrdinanceโ) is attached to this Amended Complaint as Exhibit A. \n26  6.  Violation of the Ordinance is a criminal misdemeanor under ยง4(a). \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 2 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page3 of 10\n 1  7.  The law enforcement arm of the City is the Oakland Police Department (โOPDโ).  It is \n 2  the OPD which actually interprets, enforces, and arrests persons who have allegedly violated the \n 3  Ordinance. \n 4  8.  The OPD has a set of regulations which supposedly govern its enforcement of the \n 5  Ordinance.  The regulations are contained in a โTraining Bulletinโ, the current version of which is \n 6  dated May 1, 2008, and attached hereto as Exhibit B.  \n 7  9.  In practice, OPD enforces and interprets the Ordinance in various and conflicting ways, \n 8  with the effect a person can never be particularly sure whether their conduct will or will not be \n 9  charged as a violation of the Ordinance.   Some of the interpretations violate the constitutional \n10  norms set forth in Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703 (2000), for example: \n11  A.  On March 25, 2008, at approximately 8:30 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, an OPD \n12  officer explained to plaintiff and others present that the Ordinance created a โmoving bubble zoneโ  \n13  so that any time plaintiff was standing within 100 feet of the clinic, he had to move more than 8 feet \n14  away from any person who approached him or was going into the clinic.  The police were clear that \n15  failure to abide by this interpretation would make plaintiff subject to arrest for violation of the \n16  ordinance.  Plaintiffโs counsel communicated to the City attorney this interpretation, and the City \n17  attorney has never communicated back to plaintiffโs counsel that such is not the official policy of the \n18  OPD.  While on May 29, 2008, an attorney for the City stated in a legal brief that โ[t]he Ordinance \n19  expressly applies only when speakers . . . approach individuals near the clinic โ no twhen they \n20  merely remain stationaryโ, the City has offered no assurance that the OPD has changed its policy to \n21  conform to the Cityโs legal briefing.   \n22  B.  On May 13, 2008, shortly after 10:00 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, an OPD officer \n23  told plaintiff that he was not allowed to approach or be within 8 feet of escorts, clinic personnel, or \n24  clients.  The officer intended for plaintiff to understand that merely being within 8 feet of escorts, \n25  clinic personnel, or clients within the 100โ zone would result in his arrest.  Plaintiffโs counsel has \n26  informed the City attorney of this OPD interpretation, and the City attorney has never denied that \n27  such is the official policy of the OPD.  While on May 29, 2008, an attorney for the City stated in a \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 3 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page4 of 10\n 1  legal brief that โ[t]he Ordinance expressly applies only when speakers . . . approach individuals near \n 2  the clinic โ not when they merely remain stationaryโ, the City has offered no assurance that the \n 3  OPD has changed its policy to conform to the Cityโs legal briefing.   \n 4  C.  On June 3, 2008, between 9:10 a.m. and 9:31 a.m. in front of an abortion clinic, a \n 5  witness observed two different clinic escorts, whom plaintiff alleges on information and belief are \n 6  volunteers, approaching within 8 feet of persons entering the clinic and speaking to them without \n 7  obtaining their consent.  The witness called OPD at 9:34 a.m. to report this apparent violation of the \n 8  Ordinance.  The dispatching officer asked for descriptions of the alleged offenders and also asked if \n 9  one was a certain male โbecause if he is there, there is an ordinance against him and he should not \n10  be there.โ  At around 10:05 a.m. Officer V. Johnson responded.  After learning of the situation, the \n11  Officer responded that the escorts were โprofessional peopleโ so it was permissible for them to \n12  approach patients.  The next day the witness again spoke with Officer Johnson who said he was not \n13  filing an official report about the incident.  Officer Johnson stated that his supervisor, who is \n14  Sergeant David Elzey, explained that volunteer clinic escorts were โprotected individualsโ who \n15  could not be charged with violating the Ordinance by approaching clients to converse.  On June 5, \n16  2008, plaintiffโs counsel communicated Sgt. Elzeyโs interpretation to the City attorney via email.  \n17  The City attorney responded back to the email but did not in any way deny or discount the policy \n18  set forth by Sgt. Elzey. \n19  10.  Plaintiff has already been arrested once for allegedly violating the Ordinance and is at \n20  risk to be arrested again.  Plaintiff contends that he is the individual whom the OPD dispatcher \n21  specifically noted as to whom the ordinance was against, and that the police will arrest him \n22  according to the interpretations they have given as set forth above.  The OPD itself, has never \n23  disavowed any of the three interpretations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and the City \n24  attorney has not disavowed the last interpretation.  Plaintiff reasonably fears that he will be arrested \n25  by OPD for conduct which is not prohibited by the Ordinance and/or otherwise protected by the \n26  U.S. Constitution. \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 4 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page5 of 10\n 1  11.  The OPD has an unwritten policy exempting from the reach of the Ordinance any \n 2  person who approaches and speaks to clients for the purposes of encouraging them to use clinic \n 3  services. That same unwritten policy holds that plaintiff is to be arrested if he approaches and speaks \n 4  to clients for the purposes of encouraging them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.  \n 5  This is a form of content and viewpoint discrimination. \n 6  12.  The Ordinance, both as written and as enforced by defendant, is content- and viewpoint- \n 7  based, abuses governmental power, denies free speech in a traditional public forum, does not further \n 8  any important or substantial government interest, and imposes restrictions that are greater than \n 9  necessary to further any government interest asserted.  \n10  13.  Specifically but not exclusively, the ordinance is content-based because the main \n11  purpose in enacting it was to suppress speech of a certain content and because it differentiates \n12  speech based on the content of the speech. This includes, without limitation, the fact that the \n13  ordinance elevates commercial speech over non-commercial speech by restricting โprotest, \n14  education, and counselingโ but not other forms of speech such as panhandling and vending. \n15  14.  Specifically but not exclusively, the Ordinance is not narrowly tailored to serve any \n16  significant governmental interest and imposes restrictions that are greater than necessary to further \n17  such interests because, on its face and as applied, it restricts uninvited approaches as well as \n18  unwanted and unwelcome approaches.  \n19  15.  Any interest advanced by defendant to support the Ordinance is related to the \n20  suppression of constitutional and statutory rights and is also minor compared to the infringement of \n21  rights worked by the Ordinance.  \n22  16.  Unless and until defendants are restrained by order of this Court, defendants, acting \n23  through their officers, servants, agents and employees, will enforce the Ordinance. \n24  17. Unless and until this Court declares the Ordinance unconstitutional, defendant, acting \n25  through its officers, servants, agents and employees, will enforce the Ordinance. \n26  18. All of the acts of the defendant, its officers, agents, servants, and employees, as alleged \n27  herein, were done or are threatened to be done under color and pretense of the statutes, ordinances, \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 5 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page6 of 10\n 1  regulations, customs, official policies, official procedures, and usages of the City of Oakland and the \n 2  State of California.  \n 3  19. Plaintiff is suffering irreparable injury from the enforcement and threat of enforcement of \n 4  the Ordinance, and will continue to suffer irreparable injury until the threat of enforcement is lifted. \n 5   \n 6  FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n 7  (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983: FREE SPEECH AND DUE PROCESS) \n 8  20.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully restated here. \n 9  21. The Ordinance is an unconstitutional abridgment on its face, and as applied or threatened \n10  to be applied, of the plaintiffโs affirmative rights to freedom of speech under the United States \n11  Constitution, First and Fourteenth Amendments.  \n12  22. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is an \n13  unconstitutionally overbroad restriction on expressive activity. \n14  23. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is an \n15  unconstitutionally vague restriction on expressive activity. \n16  24. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is a content-based \n17  and viewpoint-based restriction on speech. \n18  25.  The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, does not serve a \n19  significant governmental interest.  \n20  26. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, does not leave \n21  open ample alternative channels of communication.  \n22  27. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, is neither narrowly \n23  tailored nor the least restrictive means to accomplish any permissible governmental purpose sought \n24  to be served by the legislation. \n25  28. The Ordinance fails to adequately advise, notify, or inform persons threatened with \n26  possible prosecution for violation of their requirements. Therefore, the Ordinance is \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 6 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page7 of 10\n 1  unconstitutionally vague, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, in violation of the \n 2  due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  \n 3  29. The Ordinance is an irrational and unreasonable statute, imposing unjustifiable \n 4  restrictions on the exercise of protected constitutional rights. Because the Ordinance is irrational \n 5  and unreasonable, its application violates the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment \n 6  to the Untied States Constitution \n 7  30.  The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, violates the Equal \n 8  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and similar \n 9  guarantees in the California State Constitution by denying plaintiff free speech rights allowed to \n10  others in similar situations and other protections of state and federal law. \n11  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \n12  (42 U.S.C. SECTION 1983: EQUAL PROTECTION) \n13  31. Plaintiff incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 โ 30 as if fully set forth herein. \n14  32. The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, violates the Equal \n15  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically but not exclusively, the Ordinance \n16  creates three classes:  Persons entering abortion clinics, persons wishing to communicate with those \n17  entering abortion clinics for the purposes of encouraging them to use clinic services, and persons \n18  wishing to communicate with those entering abortion clinics for the purposes of encouraging them \n19  to choose options other than utilizing clinic services. \n20  33.  These classifications have a direct bearing on the fundamental interest in free speech. \n21  The City has no compelling interest justifying the creation of these classes and cannot show that \n22  these classifications are necessary to serve any legitimate governmental interest.   \n23  34.  The Ordinance singles out persons approaching abortion clinics as a class to be \n24  specifically isolated from speech, and correspondingly burdens the speech of that class of persons \n25  wishing to encourage them to choose options other than utilizing clinic services.  These \n26  classifications have a direct bearing on the fundamental interest in free speech. The City has no \n27 \n28 \n     Michael Millen, Esq. \n119 Calle Marguerita #100  FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  C07-06411 CRB  Page 7 \n    Los Gatos, CA  95032 \n        (408) 871-0777 \n       \n\nCase3:07-cv-06411-CRB   Document38    Filed06/06/08   Page8 of 10\n 1  compelling interest justifying the creation of these classes and cannot show that these classifications \n 2  are necessary to serve any legitimate governmental interest.  \n 3    \n 4  THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \n 5  (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE I, SECTION 2) \n 6  35.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1- 34 as if fully set forth herein. \n 7  36.  The Ordinance, on its face and as applied or threatened to be applied, violates Article I, \n 8  Section 2 of the California Constitution. \n 9  \n10  FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n11  (VIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION, CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION \n12  ARTICLE I, SECTION 7 AND ARTICLE IV, SECTION 16) \n13  37.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1- 36 as if fully set forth herein. \n14  38.  The Ordinance, on its face as applied or threatened to be applied, violates Article I, \n15  section 7 and Article IV, section 16 of the California Constitution. \n16  \n17  FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n18  (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE ยง52.1) \n19  39.  Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1- 38 as if fully set forth herein. \n20  40.
