    "summary": "On June 16, 2011, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1691-1691f, against the Midwest Bankcentre.  The DOJ alleged that the defendant engaged in lending discrimination on the basis of race in the St. Louis metropolitan area.  The case had been referred to the Department of Justice by the Federal Reserve Bank, in St. Louis, which had found statistical signs of discrimination.  More specifically, the DOJ alleged that the defendant's choice of locations for branch offices was designed to serve the banking and credit needs of residents of majority-white census tracts, but not those of residents of majority-black census tracts.  Similarly, the DOJ alleged that the defendant made loans for residential real estate in predominantly white residential census tracts but avoided serving the similar credit needs of majority-black census tracts.  In total, the complaint asserted, the result was illegal redlining:  \"defendant's policies and practices are intended to deny and discourage, or have the effect of denying or discouraging, an equal opportunity to the residents of the majority-black neighborhoods of the St. Louis MSA, on account of the racial composition of those neighborhoods, to obtain residential real estate-related loans.\"In 2000, 76% of the Missouri portion of the St. Louis metro area was non-Hispanic white, and 19% was African-American; the African-American population was mostly concentrated in the northern part of the City of St. Louis and the neighboring northeastern portion of St. Louis County.  But the  defendant's had drawn an assessment area (as required by the Community Reinvestment Act) that excluded both majority-black areas: the northern part of St. Louis city and the northeast corner of St. Louis County. In fact, the Midwest's CRA assessment area excluded 47 of the 60 majority-black census tracts in the City of St. Louis, and drew a virtual horseshoe around the majority-black census tracts. Settlement negotiations preceded filing in this case, and on June 28, 2011, Magistrate Judge Frederick R. Buckles approved a detailed consent decree that had been submitted simultaneously with the complaint.  The consent decree included both injunctive and monetary relief, described as \"designed to expand opportunities to meet the credit needs of residents located in majority-black census tracts in the Missouri portion of the St. Louis MSA [Metropolitan Statistical Area].  Midwest will ensure that its lending products and services are made available and marketed in majority-black census tracts on no less favorable a basis than in majority-white tracts. Midwest commits itself to take all reasonable, practicable actions, consistent with safety and soundness, to increase the level of its residential lending in majority-black census tracts. with the ultimate objective that Midwest offers mortgage lending services on an equal basis as it offers such services in majority-white census tracts.\"Among the injunctive measures in the decree were:    a general prohibition on discrimination a redrawn CRA assessment area, including all of the city of St. Louis, as well as St. Louis, Jefferson, and St. Charles Counties at least one new full-service branch office in a majority-black census tract, with an on-site residential mortgage officer continued full-time employment of a Director of Community Development, with primary responsibilities to include overseeing the  continued development of the Bank's lending in majority-black census tracts continued full-time employment of a Director of Compliance, with  responsibilities to include overseeing compliance with the decree itself a credit needs assessment of the Missouri majority-black census tracts, to be shared with the United States fair lending training, African-American outreach and advertising  $900,000 for a special credit program directed at the majority black census tracts, to reduce closing costs $300,000 for consumer financial education and other related relief $25,000 for the Metropolitan St. Louis Equal Housing Opportunity Council, whose complaint got the case underway. The decree also included a variety of record retention and reporting provisions, and a sunset period of five years. On April 11, 2013, the parties jointly moved to amend the decree, specifically with respect to the $900,000 for special credit programs. The parties stated that the defendant would be \"unable to offer the specified forms of financial assistance at a volume that would exhaust the requisite subsidy for the special financing program during the five-year term of the Agreed Order.\" Therefore, they amended the agreement to provide the defendant \"with additional instruments for providing financial assistance intended to facilitate its ability to expend the subsidy through the special financing program.\" The court approved the amendment on April 15.The sunset period has passed, and the case is now closed.",

Under the consent decree, signed in June 2011 and scheduled to last five years, Midwest included both majority white and majority black census tracts in its Community Reinvestment Act assessment area, agreed to open at least one full service branch in the underserved black neighborhoods of St. Louis, undertook a credit needs assessment of the majority black census tracts, and pledged about $1.2 million for a special debt program (to reduce closing costs), consumer financial education, and other related initiatives.

INTRODUCTION \nThis Order is submitted jointly by the parties for the approval of and entry by the Court \nsimultaneously with the filing of the United States' Complaint in this action. This Order resolves \n! \nI  the claims of the United States that Midwest BankCenlre iMidwesf' or \"Bank\") has engaged in \na pattern or practice of conduct in violation of the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA.J  . 42 U.S.C. \n! \n§§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\"ECOA\"), IS U.S.C. §§ 1691-1691f, by \ndiscriminating on the basis of race and color in the provision of residential. real estate-related \n!: \ncredit in the Missouri portion of the St Louis MSA. \nThere has been no factual rmding or adjudication with respect to any matter aIlegad by \nthe United States.  Accordingly. the execution of this Order is not, and is not to be considered as, \nan admission or fillding of any violation of the FHA or the ECOA by Midwest.  Rather, the \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086-FRB  Doc. #:  9  Filed: 06/28/11  Page: 2 of 25 PageID #: 57 \nparties have entered into this Order to resolve voluntarily the claims asserted by the United \nStates in order to avoid the risks and burdens of litigation. The parties agree that full \nimplementation of the terms of this Order will provide a fair and reasonable resolution of the \nallegations of the United States in arnanner consistent with Midwest's legitimate business \ninterests. \nUnder the provisions of this Order, Midwest has committed itself to a program designed \nto expand opportunities to meet the credit needs of residents located in majority-black census \ntnIcts in the Missouri portion of the St Louis MSA.'  Midwest will ensure that its lending \n·products and services are made available and marketed in majority-black census tracts on no less \nfavorable a basis than in majority-white tracts.  Midwest commits itsclfto take all reasonable, \npracticable actions, consistent with safety and soundness, to ~ the level of its residential. \nlending in majority-bJa4 census tracts. with the ultimate objective that Midwest offers mortgage \nlending services on an equal basis as it offers such services in majority-white census tracts. The \nremedial. plan to achieve this objective, detailed in subsequent sections oftrus Order, includes the \nopening of one new branch in a majority-black census tract. targeted marketing programs, \nexpanded community outreach, conswner education and credit repair efforts, and investment in \nthose areas through subsidized loan offerings in order to aid in the revitalization and stabilization \nof the housing market. \nI  FOI purposes of this Order, a census tract will be considered to be ''majority-black'' if its racial \ncomposition is more than 50% African-American based on data from the 2000 or 2010 United \nStates Ceosus.  . \n2 \n\n, , \nCase: 4:11-cv-01086-FRB  Doc. #:  9  Filed: 06/28/11  Page: 3 of 25 PageID #: 58 \nIL  BACKGROUND \nMidwest is • wholly-owned subsidiary of Midwest B8IlkCeotre, Inc., • financial holding \ncompany headquartered in Sl Louis COlIDty, Missouri.  Its principal office is in St, Louis \nCounty, Missouri.  Midwest operates primarily as a commercial bank.  The Bank also offers the \ntraditional services of a financial depository and lending institution, including the receipt of \nmonelliry deposits and the financing of residential housing.  As of December 31, 2010, Midwest \nhad assets tota1ingjust onder $1.1 bllllon. Midwest is subject to the regulatory authority of the \nFederal Reserve System. \n00 August i4, 2009, the Department of Justice informed the B8Ilk that it had initiated an \ninVestigatiOl; into potenlial·leoding discrimination by Midwest, including whether Midwest had \ndiscriminat;e4 on the basis of race in providing lending services to predominantly African-\nAmerican communities in the S~ Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area (,'MSA\"). \nIn 2009, the Federal Reserve System initiated a consumer compliance examination of \nMidwest. The examination included an evaluation ofleoding data from 2006 to 2008 related to \nMidwest's applications and originations in the City of St. Louis and 5t. Louis, St. Charles, and \njefferson Counties?  Based on the information gathered in its examination, the Federal Reserve \nconcluded that there was reason to believe that Midwest engaged in a pattern or practice of \nconduct in violation of the FHA and ECOA  00 October 14,2010, the Board ofGovemors of \n,  The Missouri portion of the Sl Louis MSA consists of Crawford, Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, \nSL Charles, St. Louis and Wam:n counties, as well as the City ofSI. Louis. The Board', \ninvestigation focused Qn Midwest's lending activities in the COlIDties closest to the City of St. \nLouis, including Jefferson, St. Charles and S~ Louis Counties, as well .. the City .of SL Louis \nitself. \n3· \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086-FRB  Doc. #:  9  Filed: 06/28/11  Page: 4 of 25 PageID #: 59\nthe Federel Reserve System (\"Board'1 lCfemd this metter to the Attorney Geoerai pursuant to \nECOA. \nAfter conducting its own extensive investigation and reviewing the information provided \nby the Board, the United States contcods that Midwest has acted to meet the =<lit needs for \nresidential real estate-related loans in majority-white census tracts of the Missouri portion of the \nSt Louis MSA and bas avoided serving the similar credit needs of majority-black census tracts. \nThe Complaint alleges that Midwest's policies and practices are intended to deny and \ndiscourage, or have the effect of denying or discouraging, an equal opportunity to the residents \nafthe majority-black tracts in the Missouri portion of the St Louis MSA to obtain residential \nreal estato--related loans. \nMidwest emphatically denies the alleged violations of law and strongly maintajns that it \nhas been and. remains CQmmitted to engaging in lending practices in a manner that ensures \n. compliance with the FHA and ECOA and is consistent with safe and sound banking operations. \nNevertheless; «? avoid the costs and burdens of litigation, both parties voluntarily <;onsent to the \nentry of this Order. \nThe United States recognizes that, since being iDformed of the United States' \ninvestigation of this matter and dwing the course of the Board's examination. Midwest has \nvolUntarily undertaken several initiatives to help meet the credit needs of residents located. in \nmajority-black census tracts in the Missouri portion of the St. Louis MSA.  For example. \nMidwest has revised its Community ReinvestmentAct (\"CRA'1 assessment area to include all of \nSt. Charles. St. Louis and Jefferson counties and the entire City of St. Louis. \nI \nIn 201 0, Midwest expanded its marketing and advertising efforts by placing \nI \nI  advertisements in newspapers serving largely minority populations.  Midwest has recently \nI \n4 \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086-FRB  Doc. #:  9  Filed: 06/28/11  Page: 5 of 25 PageID #: 60 \nconducted a financial education training class for residents of the College Hill neighborhood and \ncollaborated with a newspaper serving largely minority populations in organizing three ti.n.ancial . \neducation workshops conducted at a local African-American owned business serving the \nAfrican-American community.  Midwest has also engaged an independent third party to assist \nthe Bank. in the development of internal programs around the subject of \"unconscious bias.\" \nBeginning in 20 IO  . Bank managers have also been active participants in efforts to address \nthe large number ofunba.nked and underbanked persons in. St Louis, which efforts were \notganized by the Federal Deposit Insunmce Corporation and are currently led by community \nbusin~ and organizations. In one program designed to meet the needs of the community, \nMidwest has developed. a small dollar (up to $5,000) home improvement loan product with less \nstringent underwriting criteria at a low fixed rate to assist homeowners in low- and moderate-\nincome neighborhoods repair and maintain their homes. \nIn terms of financial support to local commtmity organizations, Midwest solicited and \n=eived $200,000 througb • federal home loan bank grant program focused on affordable \nhousing, to partner with a 8t. Louis area community group to provide home repairs for \nhomeowners in. the predominantly African-American community of Pine Lawn, Missouri?  The \nBank has also approved and opened. $250,000 line of credit to support a micro-lending \nprogram., which enabled that program to fund loans to minority-owned businesses and/or \nbusi.aesses located in majority-black census tracts that it could not have otherwise funded. \n)  Pine Lawn is located in the Missouri portion of the St. Louis MSA. \n,  5 \n, \ni \n, \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086-FRB  Doc. #:  9  Filed: 06/28/11  Page: 6 of 25 PageID #: 61 \nIll.

This Court has jurisdiction oftrus action pursuant to 28 U .S.C. § 1345,42 U.S.C. \n§ 3614, and 15 U.s.C. § 1691e(h).  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. \n3.  Defendant Midwest BankCentre (\"Midwest\" or \"Bank\") is a wholly-owned \nsubsidiary of Midwest BankCentre, Inc., a fmancial holding company headquartered in 8t. Louis \nCounty, Missouri. Th~ Bank's principal office is in 8t. Louis County, Missouri.  Midwest offers \nthe traditional services of a financial depository and lending institution, including the receipt of \n---------\n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 2 of 11 PageID #: 2\nmonetary deposits and the financing of residential housing and commercial loans primarily in the \nSt. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area As of December 31, 2009, Midwest had assets totaling \njust over $1.1 billion.  Midwest is subject to the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. \n4.  Midwest has seven full·service branches and four partial·service branches in the \nSt. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area.  Midwest's full·service branches offer deposit products \nand services and loan products, including home·mortgage lending.  The four partial·service \nbranches, which offer only deposit services, are located within retirement communities and are \nopen only to residents of those retirement communities.  From March 2008, through September \nan \n2010, Midwest operated  additional full·service branch in Rockford, illinois, approximately \n350 miles from the City of St. Louis. \n5.  Midwest's mortgage lending activities in the St. Louis metropolitan are almost \nexclusively confined to the Missouri portion of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area \n(MSA).  The Missouri portion of the St. Louis MSA is comprised of Crawford, Franklin, \nJefferson, Lincoln, S1. Charles, S1. Louis and Warren counties as well as the City of St. Louis. \n6.  Midwest is subject to the federal1aws governing fair lending, including the Fair \nHousing Act and the Equa1 Credit Opportunity Act and their respective implementing \nregulations, the fair housing regulations of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n24 C.F.R. § 100.1, et seq., and Regulation B of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, 12 C.F.R. § 202.1, et seq.  The Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act \nprohibit financial institutions from, inter alia, discriminating on the basis of race and color in \ntheir home·mortgage lending practices. \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 3 of 11 PageID #: 3\n7.  On August 14, 2009, the Department of Justice infonned the defendant that it had \ninitiated an investigation into potential lending discrimination by the Bank, including whether \nMidwest had discriminated.on the basis of race in providing lending services to predominantly \nAfrican-American communities in the S1. Louis metropolitan area.  The Department of Justice's \ninvestigation stenuned from allegations of lending discrimination that the Metropolitan 8t. Louis \nEqual Housing Opportunity Council had brought to the attention of the Department earlier in \n2009. \n8.  Beginning· in 2009, the Federal Reserve System initiated a consumer compliance \nexamination of Midwest.  During the course of its examination, the Federal Reserve System \nanalyzed lending data from 2006-2008 related to Midwest's applications and originations in the \nCity ofSt. Louis and St. Louis, St. Charles and Jefferson Counties.  Based on the information \ngathered during its examination, the Federal Reserve concluded that there was reason to believe \nthat Midwest engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation. of the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act.  Specifically, the Federal Reserve System determined \nthat there was reason to believe that Midwest engaged in redlining in violation of Section 701(a) \nof the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a). \n9.  Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(g), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem referred the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate enforcement action on \nOctober 14, 2010, following its determination as described in paragraph 8. \n10.  According to the 2000 Census, the Missouri portion of the St. Louis MSA had a \ntotal population of approximately 2.03 million persons, of whom 76% were non-Hispanic white \n(approximately 1.53 million) and 19% were African-American (approximately 378,000). The \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 4 of 11 PageID #: 4\nMSA's African-American population is mostly concentrated in the northern part of the City of \nS1. Louis and the neighboring northeastern portion of St. Louis County. \n11.  In operating and expanding the scope of its business over time, defendant has \nacted to meet the credit needs for residential real estate-related loans in predominantly white \nresidential census tracts (with a population greater than 50% white) in the Missouri portion of the \nSt. Louis MSA, and has avoided serving the similar credit needs of majority-black census tracts. \n12.  Defendant has engaged in a race-based pattern of locating branch offices.  It has \nlocated branch offices in a manner designed to serve the banking and credit needs of the \nresidents of majority-white census tracts, but not those of residents of majority-black census \ntracts. \n13.  Since 1990, Midwest bas opened or relocated six full-service branches in \nmajority-white census tracts in the St. Louis MSA, and none in majority-black census tracts. \nSince 1995, Midwest opened its four partial-service branches in retirement communities with \nmajority-white populations.  At present, al1 seven of Midwest's full-service branches in the St. \nLouis area are located in majority-white census tracts.  See Map attached as Exhibit A. \n14.  In addition to its branches in the St. Louis MSA, in 2007, Midwest opened a loan \nproduction office in Rockford, Illinois that became a full-service branch in 2008.  The population \nof the Rockford MSA is 85% white.  Midwest closed its branch in Rockford, TIlinois in late-\n2010. \n15.  The unlawful consideration of race in the business practices of defendant is also \nevident from the assessment areas that defendant has established and maintained pursuant to the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\").  Pursuant to statutory direction, the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System has promulgated regulations to implement the CRA, lic.F.R. \n1_  _ \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 5 of 11 PageID #: 5\n§ 228 (\"Reg. BB\").  Under Reg. BB, as amended in 1997, a bank's assessment area ordinarily \nwill consist of one or more metropolitan areas or contiguous political subdivisions, 12 C.F.R. \n§ 228.4I(c), unless that area would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by \nsignificant geographic barriers, 12 C.F.R. § 228.41(d).  Reg. BB further provides that if a bank's \nassessment area does not include entire political jurisdictions, its assessment area may not reflect \nillegal discrimination.  12 C.F.R. § 228.4I(e). \n16.  Further, Midwest had delineated a CRA assessment area within the 8t. Louis \nMSA that included most of St. Louis County, portions ofSt. Charles and 8t. Jefferson counties, \nand the southern part of the City ofSt. Louis.  The assessment area excluded the northern part of \nthe City of 81. Louis as well as the northeast comer ofSt Louis County.  Midwest's assessment \narea formed a virtual horseshoe around the majority-black census tracts in the City of St Louis. \nSee Map attached as Exhibit A.  Specifically, Midwest's CRA assessment area excluded 47 of \nthe 60 majority-black census tracts within the City ofSt Louis.  In 2010, following discussions \nwith the Federal Reserve System, Midwest modified its CRA assessment area to include the \nentire City of St. Louis and all of St. Louis, St. Charles, and Jefferson Counties. \n17.  Since at least 2004, Midwest knew or should have known that it was under-\nserving majority-minority communities.  For three consecutive years beginning in 2004, \nMidwest employed a consulting firm to analyze its IDvIDA data for compliance with CRA and \nfair housing requirements.  Each of the resulting annual reports stated that Midwest was making \na lower portion of its HMDA-reportable loans in majority-minority census tracts than was its \npeer group, which consisted of seven lenders apparently selected by Midwest andlor its \nconsultant, Phillips and Associates.  In 2004, Midwest was informed that while its peer group \nhad made 6.5% of its H?vIDA-reportable loans in minority census tracts, Midwest had made only \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 6 of 11 PageID #: 6\n1.7% of its IDvIDA-reportable loans in those census tracts.  In 2005, Midwest was informed that \nits peer group had made 7.8% of its HMDA-reportable loans in minority census tracts, while \nMidwest had made only 1.4% of such loans in those census tracts.  In 2006, Midwest was \ninformed that while its peer group had made 8.9% of its HMDA-reportable loans in minority \ncensus tracts, Midwest had made only 4.9% of its HMDA-reportable loans in those census tracts. \n18.  Until at least late-2009, after being put on notice of the Department of Justice's \ninvestigation, Midwest took no affirmative steps to market its mortgage lending services to black \nborrowers or in majority-black census tracts. \n19.  The policies and practices of defendant, described herein, have served majority-\nwhite communities to a significantly greater extent than majority-black communities, as further \ndemonstrated by defendant's actual residential lending activity over time. \n20.  Statistical analyses of the defendant's residential real estate-related loan \napplications and originations for each year from 2004 to 2008. and for the five years combined, \nshow that the defendant served the credit needs of the residents of majority-white census tracts in \nthe Missouri portion of the S1. Louis MSA to a significantly greater extent than it served the \nresidential real estate-related credit needs of the residents of majority-black census tracts. \nDuring that time, there were statistically significant disparities with respect the defendant's \nresidential real estate lending activity when compared with similar lenders.  Those disparities \nremained significant throughout the analyzed five-year period. \n21.  From 2004-2008, the defendant generated 2,250 single-family (defined by \nHMDA as dwellings with 1-4 units) residential loan appi.ications in the St. Louis MSA that were \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 7 of 11 PageID #: 7\nrequired to be reported to its re~lator pursuant to HMDA, I 28 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2810.  Only 61, \nor 2.7%, of these applications were received from majority-black tracts.  During that same time \nperiod, comparable lenders in the St. Louis MSA received 10.7% of their residential real estate-\nrelated loan applications from majority-black census tracts - almost four times the rate of \nMidwest applications.  These results show a statistically significant failure by Midwest to \nprovide loan services and draw applications from majority-black tracts on an equal basis with \nmajority-white census tracts. \n22.  Of the 1,861 single-family residential loans Midwest originated in the St. Louis \nMSA from 2004-2008, only 42 or 2.3% were secured by residential property located in majority-\nblack census tracts.  See Map of Origination!), attached as Exhibit C.  In contrast, Midwest's \npeer group lenders in the St. Louis MSA originated 113,084 single-family residential loans from \n2004-2008, and 8.6% of those loans were secured by residential property located in majority-\nblack tracts.  These percentage figures are more than three times that of Midwest Bank, and \nshow a statistically significant failure by the defendant to provide loan services and draw \napplications from majority-black tracts. \n23.  The totality of defendant's policies and practices described herein constitutes the \nredlining of majority-black areas of the St. Louis MSA for defendant's home lending business. \nDefendant's policies and practices are intended to deny and discourage, or have the effect of \ndenying or discouraging, an equal opportunity to the residents of the majority-black \nneighborhoods of the St. Louis MSA, on account of the racial composition of those \nThis includes all loan applications that Midwest reported on its HMDA reports, as well as loan \nI \napplications that Midwest originated and forwarded to DAS or subprime lenders to be \nunderwritten.  See Map of Applications, attached as Exhibit B, which illustrates the locations of \nthe residential properties to be secured by these loan applications. \n----.....:.-\n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 8 of 11 PageID #: 8\nneighborhoods, to obtain residential real estate-related loans.  These policies and practices are \nnot justified by business necessity or legitimate business considerations. \n24.  Defendant's actions as alleged herein constitute: \na.  Discrimination on the basis of race or color in making available, or in the terms or \nconditions ofresidential real estate-related transactions, in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 \nu.s.C. § 3605(a); \nb.  The making unavailable or denial of dwellings to persons because of race or color \nin violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); \nc.  Discrimination on the basis of race or color in the terms, conditions, or privileges \nof the provision of services or facilities in connection with the sale or rental of dwellings, in \nviolation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b); and \nd.  Discrimination against applicants with respect to credit transactions, on the basis \nof race or color, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(I). \n25.  Defendant's policies and practices as alleged herein constitute: \na.  A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights secured by the \nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 el seq., and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \n§ 1691 e(h); and \nb.  A denial of rights granted by the Fair Housing Act to a group of persons that \nraises an issue of general public importance. \n26.  Persons who have been victims of defendant's discriminatory policies and \npractices are aggrieved persons as defmed in 42 U.S.C. § 3602(i) and as described in the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(e)(i), and have suffered damages as a result of \n\nCase: 4:11-cv-01086   Doc. #:  1    Filed: 06/16/11   Page: 9 of 11 PageID #: 9\ndefendant's conduct in violation of both the Fair Housing and the Equal Credit Opportunity Acts, \nas described herein. \n27.
