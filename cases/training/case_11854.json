    "summary": "<p>The plaintiff in this case was arrested erroneously on a warrant for failure to pay for a traffic violation; in fact, he had already paid. He was then booked into jail, and strip searched. He brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches. He maintained that persons arrested for a minor offense could not be required to remove their clothing and expose their genitals to close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process. Rather, he contended—as had been held by most of the federal courts of appeals—officials could conduct this kind of search only if they had reason to suspect a particular jail prisoner of concealing a weapon, drugs, or other contraband. </p><p>The district court certified a class of individuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense under New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington County or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked even though an officer had not articulated any reasonable suspicion they were concealing contraband. After discovery, in February 2009, the court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the unlawful search claim. It concluded that any policy of strip searching nonindictable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment. 595 F. Supp. 2d 492 (D.N.J. 2009) (Rodriguez, J.). The district court certified the issue to the 3d Circuit for immediate review. 657 F. Supp. 2d 504 (D.N.J. 2009). </p><p>A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, in an opinion by Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman. The Third Circuit held that the procedures described by the district court struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the security needs of the two jails. 621 F.3d 296 (2010). </p><p>The federal courts of appeals had split on the question whether the Fourth Amendment allowed what are usually referred to as \"blanket\" strip search policies, in which no individualized suspicion need exist to justify a strip search of an arrestee. In a 5–4 opinion, with the majority by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court took the position that—at least if a prisoner was about to be housed in a jail's general population—no such individualized suspicion is required, no matter how minor the arrest offense. Accordingly, on April 2, 2012, the Supreme Court affirmed the Third Circuit opinion.</p><p>Judge Rodriguez had stayed further activity in the case pending first the appeal and then Supreme Court review, and on May 24, 2012 the case was restored to the active docket. On June 21, 2012 the defendants moved for summary judgment. After 8 months of meetings and extension requests, the court \"on its own accord\" noted that the parties had ongoing settlement discussions with the Magistrate Judge Joel Schneider.</p><p>On February 21, 2013, the court terminated the pending motion for summary judgment in light of the settlement discussion with Magistrate Judge Joel Schneider. On March 28, 2013, the court dismissed the case as settled but a dispute between the plaintiff and plaintiff’s counsel regarding the disposition of the $60,000 that the defendant agreed to pay stalled the case.</p><p>On July 22, 2013, the plaintiff filed a brief opposing a discovery motion post-termination, alleging that the retainer agreement was unenforceable and that there was a fee dispute. On the next day, the court ordered the parties to have a conference call to resolve the current fee dispute without the court's intervention. On October 21, 2013, the court denied the motion for settlement that was filed earlier by the defendants because of ongoing dispute amongst plaintiff and his counsel about how to distribute the settlement proceeds. The court determined that the issue would be addressed and decided in connection with a pending New Jersey fee arbitration.</p><p>As of March 2017, there have been no further updates to this case. There is no reason to believe the case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In this case against two jails in New Jersey, in Essex and Burlington Counties, plaintiffs challenged the practice of strip searching all arrestees booked into the jail, no matter how minor their alleged offense, arguing that such a \"blanket\" strip search policy violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches.   This was an issue that had split the federal Courts of Appeals.  In this case, the Supreme Court (Kennedy, J.) rejected this Fourth Amendment argument, and upheld the searches in question.",

BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS  \nOF COUNTY OF BURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR \nTHE THIRD CIRCUIT  \nNo. 10–945.  Argued October 12, 2011—Decided April 2, 2012  \nPetitioner was arrested during a traffic  stop by a New Jersey state \ntrooper who checked a statewide computer database and found a \nbench warrant issued for petitioner’s arrest  after he failed to  appear \nat a hearing to enforce a fine.  He was initially detained in the Bur-\nlington County Detention Center and later in the Essex County Cor-\nrectional Facility, but was released once it was determined that the \nfine had been paid.  At the first jail, petitioner, like every incoming \ndetainee, had to shower with a delousing agent and was checked for \nscars, marks, gang tattoos, and contraband as he disrobed.  Petition-\ner claims  that  he also had to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out \nhis arms, turn around, and lift his genitals.  At the second jail, peti-\ntioner, like other arriving detainees, had to remove his clothing while \nan officer looked for body markings, wounds, and contraband; had an \nofficer look at his ears, nose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arm-\npits, and other body openings; had a mandatory shower; and had his \nclothes examined.  Petitioner claims that he was also required to lift \nhis genitals, turn around, and cough while squatting.  He filed a 42 \nU. S. C. §1983 action in the Federal District Court against the gov-\nernment entities that ran the jails and other defendants, alleging \nFourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and arguing that per-\nsons arrested for minor offenses cannot be subjected to invasive \nsearches unless prison officials have reason to suspect concealment of \nweapons, drugs, or other contraband.  The court granted him sum-\nmary judgment, ruling that “strip-searching” nonindictable offenders \nwithout reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment.  The \nThird Circuit  reversed.  \nHeld: The judgment is affirmed. \n \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nSyllabus   \n621 F. 3d 296, affirmed. \nJUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to \nPart IV, concluding that the search procedures at the county jails \nstruck a reasonable balance between  inmate privacy and the needs of \nthe institutions, and thus  the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \ndo not require adoption of the framework and rules petitioner pro- \nposes.  Pp. 5−18, 19.  \n  (a) Maintaining safety and order at detention centers  requires the \nexpertise of correctional officials, who must have substantial discre-\ntion to devise reasonable solutions to problems.  A regulation imping-\ning on an inmate’s constitutional rights must be upheld “if it is rea-\nsonably related to legitimate penological interests.”  Turner v. Safley, \n482 U. S. 78, 89.  This Court, in  Bell v.  Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 558,  \nupheld a rule requiring pretrial detainees in federal correctional fa-\ncilities “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of \na strip search conducted after every contact visit with a  person from \noutside the institution[s],” deferring to the judgment of correctional \nofficials that the inspections served not only to discover but also to \ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohibited items.  \nIn Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 586−587, the Court upheld a \ngeneral ban on contact visits in a county jail, noting the smuggling \nthreat posed by such visits and the difficulty of carving out exceptions \nfor certain detainees.  The Court, in Hudson  v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517,  \n522−523, also recognized that deterring the possession of contraband \ndepends in part on the ability to conduct searches without predictable \nexceptions when it upheld the constitutionality of random searches of \ninmate lockers and cells even without suspicion that an inmate is \nconcealing a prohibited item.  These cases  establish that  correctional \nofficials must  be permitted to devise reasonable search policies to de-\ntect and deter the possession of contraband in their facilities, and \nthat “in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate  \nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considera-\ntions courts should ordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such \nmatters,” Block, supra,  at 584–585.  \n  Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the detainees to \nbe processed at jails.  See Atwater v.  Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318, 354.   \nPp. 5−9. \n  (b) The question here is whether undoubted security imperatives \ninvolved in jail supervision override the assertion that some detain-\nees must be exempt from the invasive search procedures at issue ab-\nsent reasonable suspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  \nCorrectional officials have a significant interest in conducting  a thor-\nough search as a standard part of the intake process.  The admission  \nof new inmates creates risks for staff, the existing detainee popula-\n \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nSyllabus  \ntion, and the new detainees themselves.  Officials therefore must \nscreen for contagious infections and for wounds or injuries requiring \nimmediate medical attention.  It may be difficult to identify and treat \nmedical problems until detainees remove their clothes for a visual in-\nspection.  Jails and prisons also face potential gang violence, giving \nthem reasonable justification for a visual inspection of detainees for \nsigns of gang affiliation as  part of the intake process.  Additionally, \ncorrectional  officials  have  to  detect  weapons,  drugs,  alcohol,  and \nother prohibited items new detainees may possess.  Drugs can make \ninmates aggressive  toward officers  or each other, and drug trading \ncan lead to violent confrontations.  Contraband has value in a jail’s  \nculture and underground economy, and competition for scarce goods \ncan lead to violence, extortion, and disorder.  Pp. 9−13. \n(c) Petitioner’s proposal―that new detainees not arrested for seri-\nous crimes or for offenses involving weapons or drugs be exempt from \ninvasive searches unless they give officers a particular reason to sus-\npect them of hiding contraband―is unworkable.  The seriousness of  \nan offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband, and it would be \ndifficult to determine whether individual detainees fall within the \nproposed exemption.  Even persons arrested for a minor offense may \nbe coerced by others into concealing contraband.  Exempting people \narrested for minor offenses from a  standard search protocol thus may \nput  them  at  greater   risk  and  result  in  more   contraband  being  \nbrought into the detention facility. \n  It also  may be difficult to classify inmates  by their current and pri-\nor offenses before the intake search.  Jail officials know little at the  \noutset about an arrestee, who may be carrying a false ID or lie about \nhis identity.  The officers conducting an initial search often do not \nhave access to criminal history records.  And those records can be in-\naccurate or incomplete.  Even with accurate information, officers \nwould encounter serious implementation difficulties.  They would be \nrequired to determine quickly whether any underlying offenses were \nserious enough to authorize the more invasive  search protocol.  Other \npossible classifications based on characteristics of individual detain-\nees also might prove to be unworkable or even give rise to charges of \ndiscriminatory application.  To avoid liability, officers might be in-\nclined not to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus creat-\ning unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  While the re-\nstrictions petitioner suggests would limit the intrusion on the privacy \nof some detainees, it would be at the risk of increased danger to eve-\nryone in the facility, including the less serious offenders.  The Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments do not require adoption of the proposed \nframework. Pp. 13−18, 19.  \n \n\n4  FLORENCE v.

FLORENCE, PETITIONER  v. BOARD OF   \nCHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF   \nBURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF   \nAPPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT   \n[April 2, 2012] \n JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court, \nexcept as to Part IV.*  \n  Correctional officials have a legitimate interest, indeed \na responsibility, to ensure that  jails are not made less \nsecure by reason of what new detainees may carry in on \ntheir bodies.  Facility personnel, other inmates, and the \nnew detainee himself or herself may be in danger if these \nthreats are introduced into the jail population.  This case  \npresents the question of what rules, or limitations, the \nConstitution imposes on searches of arrested persons who \nare to be held in jail while their cases are being processed.  \nThe term “jail” is used here in a broad sense to include\nprisons  and  other  detention  facilities.  The  specific \nmeasures  being  challenged  will  be  described  in  more \ndetail;  but,  in  broad  terms,  the  controversy  concerns \nwhether every detainee who will  be admitted to the gen-\neral population may be required to undergo a close visual \ninspection while undressed.\n  The case turns in part on the extent to which this Court  \n—————— \n*  JUSTICE THOMAS joins all but Part IV of this opinion. \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nhas sufficient expertise and information in the record to \nmandate, under the Constitution, the specific restrictions\nand limitations sought by those who challenge the visual \nsearch procedures at issue.  In addressing this type of \nconstitutional claim courts must  defer to the judgment  of \ncorrectional officials unless the record contains substantial \nevidence showing their policies are an unnecessary or un-\njustified  response  to  problems  of  jail  security.  That  \nnecessary showing has not been made in this case. \nI \n  In 1998, seven years before the incidents at issue, peti-\ntioner  Albert  Florence  was  arrested  after  fleeing  from \npolice  officers  in  Essex  County,  New  Jersey.    He  was  \ncharged with obstruction of justice and use of a deadly  \nweapon.  Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to two lesser \noffenses and was sentenced to pay a fine in monthly in-\nstallments.  In 2003, after he fell behind on his payments \nand failed to appear at an enforcement hearing, a bench \nwarrant was issued for his arrest.  He paid the outstand-\ning balance less than a week later; but, for some unex-\nplained  reason,  the  warrant  remained  in  a  statewide \ncomputer database.\n  Two  years  later,  in  Burlington  County,  New  Jersey, \npetitioner and his wife were stopped in their automobile \nby a state trooper.  Based on the outstanding warrant in \nthe computer system, the officer arrested petitioner and \ntook him to the Burlington County Detention Center.  He  \nwas held there for six days and then was transferred to \nthe Essex County Correctional Facility.  It is not the ar-\nrest or confinement but the search process at each jail that \ngives rise to the claims before the Court. \n  Burlington  County  jail  procedures  required  every  ar-\nrestee to shower with a delousing agent.  Officers would \ncheck arrestees for scars, marks, gang tattoos, and contra-\nband as they disrobed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a–56a.   \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nPetitioner  claims  he  was  also  instructed  to  open  his\nmouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around, and \nlift his genitals.  (It is not clear whether this last step was\npart of the normal practice.  See ibid.)   Petitioner shared a \ncell with at least one other person and interacted with \nother inmates following his admission to the jail.  Tr. of \nOral Arg. 17. \n  The  Essex  County  Correctional  Facility,  where  peti- \ntioner was taken after six days, is the largest county jail \nin New Jersey.  App. 70a.  It admits more than 25,000 in- \nmates each year and houses about 1,000 gang members at \nany given time.  When petitioner was transferred there, \nall arriving detainees passed through a metal detector and \nwaited in a group holding cell for a more thorough search.  \nWhen they left the holding cell, they were instructed to \nremove  their  clothing  while  an  officer  looked  for  body \nmarkings, wounds, and contraband.  Apparently without \ntouching  the  detainees,  an  officer  looked  at  their  ears, \nnose, mouth, hair, scalp, fingers, hands, arms, armpits, \nand other body openings.  Id., at  57a–59a; App. to Pet.  \nfor Cert. 137a–144a.  This policy applied regardless of the \ncircumstances of the arrest, the suspected offense, or the \ndetainee’s behavior, demeanor, or criminal history.  Peti-\ntioner alleges he was required to lift his genitals, turn \naround, and cough in a squatting position as part of the  \nprocess.  After  a  mandatory  shower,  during  which  his \nclothes  were  inspected,  petitioner  was  admitted  to  the \nfacility.  App. 3a–4a, 52a, 258a.  He was released the next \nday, when the charges against him were dismissed.\n  Petitioner sued the governmental entities that operated\nthe jails, one of the wardens, and certain other defendants.\nThe  suit  was  commenced  in  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey.  Seeking relief under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 for violations of his Fourth and Four-\nteenth Amendment rights, petitioner maintained that per- \nsons arrested for a minor offense could not be required  \n\n4  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nto remove their clothing and expose the most private areas \nof their bodies to close visual inspection as a routine part \nof the intake process.  Rather, he contended, officials could \nconduct  this  kind  of  search  only  if  they  had  reason  to \nsuspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon, drugs, \nor other contraband.  The District Court certified a class of \nindividuals who were charged with a nonindictable offense \nunder New Jersey law, processed at either the Burlington \nCounty or Essex County jail, and directed to strip naked \neven though an officer had not articulated any reasonable\nsuspicion they were concealing contraband.\n  After  discovery,  the  court  granted  petitioner’s  motion \nfor summary judgment  on the unlawful search claim.  It \nconcluded that any policy of “strip searching” nonindict- \nable offenders without reasonable suspicion violated the \nFourth Amendment.  A divided panel of the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding \nthat the procedures described by the District Court struck \na  reasonable  balance  between  inmate  privacy  and  the \nsecurity needs of the two jails.  621 F. 3d 296 (2010).  The \ncase  proceeds  on  the  understanding  that  the  officers\nsearched detainees prior to their admission to the general \npopulation,  as  the  Court  of  Appeals  seems  to  have  as-\nsumed.  See id., at 298, 311.  Petitioner has not argued \nthis factual premise is incorrect. \n  The opinions in earlier proceedings, the briefs on file, \nand some cases of this Court refer to a “strip search.”  The \nterm is imprecise.  It may refer simply to the instruction \nto remove clothing while an officer observes from a dis-\ntance of, say, five feet or more; it may mean a visual in-\nspection  from  a  closer,  more  uncomfortable  distance;  it\nmay include directing detainees to shake their heads or to \nrun their hands through their hair to dislodge what might \nbe hidden there; or it may involve instructions to raise \narms, to display foot insteps, to expose the back of the \nears, to move or spread the buttocks or genital areas, or to  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  5 \n \nOpinion of the Court \ncough in a squatting position.  In the instant case, the \nterm  does  not  include  any  touching  of  unclothed  areas \nby the inspecting officer.  There are no allegations that \nthe detainees here were touched in any way as part of the \nsearches. \n  The Federal Courts of Appeals have come to differing \nconclusions as to whether the Fourth Amendment requires \ncorrectional officials to exempt some detainees who will be \nadmitted to a jail’s general population from the searches \nhere at issue.  This Court granted certiorari to address the \nquestion.  563 U. S. ___ (2011). \nII  \n  The difficulties of operating a detention center must not \nbe underestimated by the courts.   Turner v.  Safley, 482 \nU. S.  78,  84–85  (1987).  Jails  (in  the  stricter  sense  of\nthe term, excluding prison facilities) admit more than 13 \nmillion inmates a year.  See, e.g.,  Dept. of Justice, Bureau\nof Justice Statistics, T. Minton, Jail Inmates at Midyear \n2010—Statistical Tables 2 (2011).  The largest facilities \nprocess hundreds of people every day; smaller jails may be \ncrowded on weekend nights, after a large police operation, \nor because of detainees arriving from other jurisdictions.  \nMaintaining  safety  and  order  at  these  institutions  re-\nquires  the  expertise  of  correctional  officials,  who  must \nhave substantial discretion to devise reasonable solutions \nto the problems they face.  The Court has confirmed the \nimportance of deference to correctional officials and ex-\nplained that a regulation impinging on an inmate’s consti-\ntutional rights must be upheld “if it is reasonably related \nto legitimate penological interests.”  Turner, supra, at 89;  \nsee Overton v. Bazzetta, 539 U. S. 126, 131–132 (2003).   \nBut  see  Johnson  v.  California,  543  U. S.  499,  510–511 \n(2005) (applying strict scrutiny to racial classifications). \n  The Court’s opinion in  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520  \n(1979), is the starting point for understanding how this  \n\n6  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nframework  applies  to  Fourth  Amendment  challenges.  \nThat case addressed a rule requiring pretrial detainees \nin any correctional facility run by the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons “to expose their body cavities for visual inspection \nas a part of a strip search conducted after every contact \nvisit with a person from outside the institution.”  Id., at  \n558.  Inmates  at  the  federal  Metropolitan  Correctional \nCenter in New York City argued there was no security \njustification for these searches.  Officers searched guests \nbefore they entered the visiting room, and the inmates \nwere under constant surveillance during the visit.  Id., at  \n577–578 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  There had been but \none instance in which an inmate attempted to sneak con-\ntraband back into the facility.  See id., at 559 (majority\nopinion).  The Court nonetheless upheld the search policy.  \nIt deferred to the judgment of correctional officials that \nthe  inspections  served  not  only  to  discover  but  also  to \ndeter the smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other prohib-\nited items inside.  Id., at 558.  The Court explained that\nthere is no mechanical way to determine whether intru-\nsions on an inmate’s privacy are reasonable.  Id., at 559.  \nThe need for a particular search must be balanced against \nthe resulting invasion of personal rights.  Ibid.  \n  Policies designed to keep contraband out of jails and\nprisons have been upheld in cases decided since Bell.  In  \nBlock v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), for example, the \nCourt concluded that the Los Angeles County Jail could \nban all contact visits because of the threat they posed: \n“They  open  the  institution  to  the  introduction  of \ndrugs, weapons, and other contraband.  Visitors can  \neasily conceal guns, knives, drugs, or other contra-\nband in countless ways and pass them to an inmate \nunnoticed by even the most vigilant observers.  And \nthese items can readily be slipped from the clothing of \nan  innocent  child,  or  transferred  by  other  visitors \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  7 \n \nOpinion of the Court \npermitted close contact with inmates.”  Id., at 586. \nThere were “many justifications” for imposing a general \nban rather than trying to carve out exceptions for certain \ndetainees.  Id., at 587.  Among other problems, it would be \n“a difficult if not impossible task” to identify “inmates who \nhave propensities for violence, escape, or drug smuggling.”  \nIbid.  This was made “even more difficult by the brevity of \ndetention and the constantly changing nature of the in-\nmate population.”  Ibid. \n  The Court has also recognized that deterring the posses-\nsion of contraband depends in part on the ability to con-\nduct searches without predictable exceptions.  In Hudson  \nv. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984), it addressed the question \nof whether prison officials could perform random searches \nof inmate lockers and cells even without reason to suspect \na  particular  individual  of  concealing  a  prohibited  item.  \nId., at 522–523.  The Court upheld the constitutionality of \nthe practice, recognizing that “‘[f]or one to advocate that \n \nprison searches must be conducted only pursuant to an\nenunciated general policy or when suspicion is directed at \na  particular  inmate  is  to  ignore  the  realities  of  prison \noperation.’”    Id.,  at  529  (quoting  Marrero  v.  Common-\n \nwealth, 222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S. E. 2d 809, 811 (1981)).  \nInmates  would  adapt  to  any  pattern  or  loopholes  they \ndiscovered in the search protocol and then undermine the \nsecurity of the institution.  468 U. S., at 529. \n  These cases establish that correctional officials must be \npermitted to devise reasonable search policies to detect \nand deter the possession of contraband in their facilities.  \nSee Bell, 441 U. S., at 546 (“[M]aintaining institutional \nsecurity and preserving internal order and discipline are \nessential goals that may require limitation or retraction of\nretained constitutional rights of both convicted prisoners \nand pretrial detainees”).  The task of determining whether \na policy is reasonably related to legitimate security inter-\n\n8  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nests  is  “peculiarly  within  the  province  and  professional \nexpertise of corrections officials.”  Id., at 548.  This Court \nhas  repeated  the  admonition  that,  “‘in  the  absence  of \n \nsubstantial  evidence  in  the  record  to  indicate  that  the \nofficials have exaggerated their response to these consid-\nerations  courts  should  ordinarily  defer  to  their  expert \njudgment in such matters.’”  Block, supra, at 584–585;  \n \nBell, supra, at 548. \n  In many jails officials seek to improve security by re-\nquiring some kind of strip search of everyone who is to be \ndetained.  These procedures have been used in different \nplaces  throughout  the  country,  from  Cranston,  Rhode\nIsland, to Sapulpa, Oklahoma, to Idaho Falls, Idaho.  See \nRoberts  v.  Rhode  Island,  239  F. 3d  107,  108–109  (CA1  \n2001);  Chapman  v.  Nichols,  989  F. 2d  393,  394  (CA10  \n1993); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F. 2d 614, 615 (CA9 1984) \n(per curiam); see also,  e.g., Bull v. City and Cty. of San  \nFrancisco, 595 F. 3d 964 (CA9 2010) (en banc) (San Fran-\ncisco, California); Powell v. Barrett, 541 F. 3d 1298 (CA11  \n2008) (en banc) (Fulton Cty., Ga.); Masters v.  Crouch, 872 \nF. 2d 1248, 1251 (CA6 1989) (Jefferson Cty., Ky.); Weber v.  \nDell, 804 F. 2d 796, 797–798 (CA2 1986) (Monroe Cty., \nN. Y.); Stewart v. Lubbock Cty., 767 F. 2d 153, 154 (CA5  \n1985) (Lubbock Cty., Tex.). \n  Persons arrested for minor offenses may be among the \ndetainees processed at these facilities.  This is, in part, a \nconsequence of the exercise of state authority that was the \nsubject of  Atwater  v.  Lago Vista, 532 U. S. 318 (2001).   \nAtwater addressed the perhaps more fundamental ques-\ntion of who may be deprived of liberty and taken to jail in \nthe first place.  The case involved a woman who was ar-\nrested after a police officer noticed neither she nor her \nchildren were wearing their seatbelts.  The arrestee ar-\ngued  the  Fourth  Amendment  prohibited  her  custodial \narrest without a warrant when an offense could not result \nin jail time and there was no compelling need for immedi-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  9 \n \nOpinion of the Court \nate detention.  Id., at 346.  The Court held that a Fourth  \nAmendment restriction on this power would put officers in \nan “almost impossible spot.”  Id., at 350.  Their ability to\narrest a suspect would depend in some cases on the pre-\ncise weight of drugs in his pocket, whether he was a repeat \noffender, and the scope of what counted as a compelling \nneed to detain someone.  Id., at 348–349.  The Court re-\njected the proposition that the Fourth Amendment barred \ncustodial arrests in a set of these cases as a matter of \nconstitutional law.  It  ruled, based on established princi-\nples, that officers may make an arrest based upon proba-\nble cause to believe the person has committed a criminal \noffense in their presence.  See id., at 354.  The  Court \nstated that “a responsible Fourth Amendment balance is \nnot well served by standards requiring sensitive, case-by-\ncase determinations of government need, lest every discre-\ntionary judgment in the field  be converted into an occasion \nfor constitutional review.”  Id., at 347. \n  Atwater did not address whether the Constitution im-\nposes  special  restrictions  on  the  searches  of  offenders \nsuspected  of  committing  minor  offenses  once  they  are \ntaken to jail.  Some Federal Courts of Appeals have held \nthat corrections officials may not conduct a strip search of \nthese detainees, even  if no touching is involved, absent \nreasonable suspicion of concealed contraband.  621 F. 3d,  \nat 303–304, and n. 4.  The Courts of Appeals to address \nthis issue in the last decade, however, have come to the \nopposite conclusion.  See 621 F. 3d 296 (case below); Bame  \nv.  Dillard,  637  F. 3d  380  (CADC  2011);  Powell,  supra;  \nBull, supra.  The current case is set against this precedent \nand governed by the principles announced in Turner and  \nBell. \nIII  \n  The question here is whether undoubted security im-\nperatives involved in jail supervision override the asser-\n\n10  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \ntion that some detainees must be exempt from the more \ninvasive  search  procedures  at  issue  absent  reasonable \nsuspicion of a concealed weapon or other contraband.  The \nCourt has held that deference must be given to the offi-\ncials  in  charge  of  the  jail  unless  there  is  “substantial \nevidence” demonstrating their response to the situation is \nexaggerated.  Block, 468 U. S., at 584–585 (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted).  Petitioner has not met this standard,  \nand the record provides full justifications for the proce-\ndures used. \nA \n  Correctional officials have a significant interest in con-\nducting a thorough search as a standard part of the intake  \nprocess.  The admission of inmates  creates numerous risks \nfor facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and \nfor a new detainee himself or herself.  The danger of intro-\nducing lice or contagious infections, for example, is well \ndocumented.  See,  e.g.,  Deger  &  Quick,  The  Enduring \nMenace of MRSA: Incidence, Treatment, and Prevention \nin a County Jail, 15 J. Correctional Health Care 174, 174–\n175, 177–178 (2009); Bick, Infection Control in Jails and \nPrisons, 45 Healthcare Epidemiology 1047, 1049 (2007).  \nThe  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  recommends  that  staff  \nscreen new detainees for these conditions.  See Clinical  \nPractice Guidelines, Management of Methicillin-Resistant \nStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Infections 2 (2011); Clini-\ncal Practice Guidelines, Lice and Scabies Protocol 1 (2011).  \nPersons just arrested may have wounds or other injuries \nrequiring immediate medical attention.  It may be difficult \nto identify and treat these problems until detainees re-\nmove their clothes for a visual inspection.  See Prison and \nJail Administration: Practice and Theory 142 (P. Carlson \n& G. Garrett eds., 2d ed. 2008) (hereinafter Carlson & \nGarrett). \n  Jails and prisons also  face grave threats posed by the  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U.

And \nWhat Can Be Done About It 10–11 (2009).  “Gang rivalries \nspawn a climate of tension, violence, and coercion.”  Carl-\nson & Garrett 462.  The groups recruit new members by \nforce,  engage  in  assaults  against  staff,  and  give  other \ninmates a reason to arm themselves.  Ibid.  Fights among \nfeuding gangs can be deadly, and the officers who must \nmaintain order are put in harm’s way.  PBA Brief 17.  \nThese considerations provide a reasonable basis to justify \na visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of \ngang affiliation as part of the intake process.  The identi- \nfication and isolation of gang  members before they are \nadmitted protects everyone in the facility.  Cf. Fraise v.  \nTerhune, 283 F. 3d 506, 509–510 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) \n(describing a statewide policy authorizing the identifica-\ntion and isolation of gang members in prison). \n  Detecting contraband concealed by new detainees, fur-\nthermore,  is  a  most  serious  responsibility.    Weapons, \ndrugs, and alcohol all disrupt the safe operation of a jail.  \nCf. Hudson, 468 U. S., at 528 (recognizing “the constant \nfight against the proliferation of knives and guns, illicit \ndrugs, and other contraband”).  Correctional officers have  \nhad to confront arrestees concealing knives, scissors, razor \nblades, glass shards, and other prohibited items on their \nperson, including in their body cavities.  See Bull, 595 \nF. 3d, at 967, 969; Brief for New Jersey County Jail War-\ndens  Association  as   Amicus  Curiae  17–18  (hereinafter \nNew Jersey Wardens Brief).  They have also found crack, \nheroin, and marijuana.  Brief for City and County of San \nFrancisco  et  al.  as  Amici  Curiae  9–11  (hereinafter  San  \nFrancisco Brief).  The use of drugs can embolden inmates  \n\n12  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \nin  aggression  toward   officers  or  each  other;  and,  even \napart from their use, the trade in these substances can \nlead to violent confrontations.  See PBA Brief 11. \n  There are many other kinds of contraband.  The text-\nbook definition of the term covers any unauthorized item.  \nSee  Prisons:  Today  and  Tomorrow  237  (J.  Pollock  ed. \n1997) (“Contraband is any item that is possessed in viola-\ntion of prison rules.  Contraband obviously includes drugs \nor weapons, but it can also be money, cigarettes, or even \nsome types of clothing”).  Everyday items can undermine\nsecurity if introduced into a detention facility: \n“Lighters and matches are fire and arson risks or po-\ntential weapons.  Cell phones are used to orchestrate \nviolence and criminality both within and without jail-\nhouse walls.  Pills and medications enhance suicide \nrisks.  Chewing gum can block locking devices; hair-\npins can open handcuffs; wigs can conceal drugs and \nweapons.”  New Jersey Wardens Brief 8–9. \nSomething  as  simple  as  an  overlooked  pen  can  pose  a \nsignificant  danger.  Inmates  commit  more  than  10,000  \nassaults on correctional staff every year and many more \namong themselves.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, J. Stephan & J. Karberg, Census of State and \nFederal Correctional Facilities, 2000, p. v (2003). \n  Contraband creates additional problems because scarce \nitems, including currency, have value in a jail’s culture \nand underground economy.  Correctional officials inform  \nus “[t]he competition . . . for such goods begets violence, \nextortion, and disorder.”  New Jersey Wardens Brief 2.  \nGangs exacerbate the problem.  They “orchestrate thefts, \ncommit assaults, and approach inmates in packs to take \nthe contraband from the weak.”  Id., at 9–10.  This puts \nthe  entire facility,  including  detainees  being  held  for  a \nbrief term for a minor offense, at risk.  Gangs do coerce \ninmates who have access to the outside world, such as  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  13  \n \nOpinion of the Court \npeople serving their time on the weekends, to sneak things \ninto the jail.  Id., at 10; see,  e.g., Pugmire, Vegas Suspect \nHas Term to Serve, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 23, 2005, \np.  B1 (“Weekend-only  jail sentences are a common punish-\nment for people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes . . .”).  \nThese inmates, who might be thought to pose the least \nrisk, have been caught smuggling prohibited items into \njail.  See New Jersey Wardens Brief 10.  Concealing con-\ntraband often takes little time and effort.  It might be done \nas an officer approaches a suspect’s car or during a brief \ncommotion  in  a  group  holding  cell.    Something  small \nmight be tucked or taped under an armpit, behind an ear, \nbetween the buttocks, in the instep of a foot, or inside the \nmouth or some other body cavity. \n  It  is  not  surprising  that  correctional  officials  have \nsought to perform thorough searches at intake for disease,\ngang affiliation, and contraband.  Jails are often crowded, \nunsanitary, and dangerous places.  There is a substantial \ninterest in preventing any new inmate, either of his own \nwill or as a result of coercion, from putting all who live or \nwork at these institutions at even greater risk when he is \nadmitted to the general population. \nB \n  Petitioner acknowledges that  correctional officials must \nbe allowed to conduct an effective search during the intake \nprocess and that this will require at least some detainees \nto  lift  their  genitals  or  cough  in  a  squatting  position.  \nThese procedures, similar to the ones upheld in Bell, are  \ndesigned to uncover contraband that can go undetected by \na  patdown,  metal  detector,  and  other  less  invasive \nsearches.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23  \n(hereinafter  United  States  Brief);  New  Jersey  Wardens \nBrief 19, n. 6.  Petitioner maintains there is little benefit \nto conducting these more invasive steps on a new detainee \nwho has not been arrested for a serious crime or for any  \n\n14  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \noffense involving a weapon or drugs.  In his view these de-\ntainees should be exempt from this process unless they \ngive officers a particular reason to suspect them of hiding \ncontraband.    It  is  reasonable,  however,  for  correctional  \nofficials to conclude this standard would be unworkable.   \nThe record provides evidence that the seriousness of an \noffense  is  a  poor  predictor  of  who  has  contraband  and \nthat it would be difficult in practice to determine whether \nindividual detainees fall within the proposed exemption. \n1 \n  People detained for minor offenses can turn out to be \nthe most devious and dangerous criminals. Cf.  Clements v. \nLogan,  454  U. S.  1304,  1305  (1981)  (Rehnquist,  J.,  in \nchambers) (deputy at a detention center shot by misde-\nmeanant who had not been strip searched).

Reasonable \ncorrectional  officials  could  conclude  these  uncertainties \nmean  they  must  conduct  the  same  thorough  search  of \neveryone who will be admitted to their facilities. \n  Experience  shows  that  people  arrested  for  minor  of- \nfenses have tried to smuggle prohibited items into jail, \nsometimes by using their rectal cavities or genitals for the \nconcealment.  They may have some of the same incentives\nas  a  serious  criminal  to  hide  contraband.  A  detainee \nmight  risk  carrying  cash,  cigarettes,  or  a  penknife  to \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  15  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nsurvive in jail.  Others may make a quick decision to hide \nunlawful substances to avoid getting in more trouble at \nthe time of their arrest.  This record has concrete exam-\nples.  Officers at the Atlantic County Correctional Facility, \nfor example, discovered that a man arrested for driving\nunder the influence had “2 dime bags of weed, 1 pack of \nrolling  papers,  20  matches,  and  5  sleeping  pills”  taped \nunder  his  scrotum.    Brief  for  Atlantic  County  et al.  as  \nAmici Curiae 36 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A \nperson  booked  on  a  misdemeanor  charge  of  disorderly \nconduct in Washington State managed to hide a lighter, \ntobacco, tattoo needles, and other prohibited items in his \nrectal  cavity.  See  United  States  Brief  25,  n. 15.    San \nFrancisco officials have discovered contraband hidden in \nbody  cavities  of  people  arrested  for  trespassing,  public \nnuisance, and shoplifting.  San Francisco Brief 3.  There \nhave been similar incidents at jails throughout the coun-\ntry.  See United States Brief 25, n. 15. \n  Even if people arrested for a minor offense do not them-\nselves wish to introduce contraband into a jail, they may \nbe coerced into doing so by others.  See New Jersey War-\ndens Brief 16; cf. Block, 468 U. S., at 587 (“It is not unrea-\nsonable  to  assume,  for  instance,  that  low  security  risk \ndetainees would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or \nweapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact \nvisits”).  This could happen any time detainees are held in \nthe same area, including in a van on the way to the station \nor in the holding cell of the jail.  If, for example, a person\narrested and detained for unpaid traffic citations is not \nsubject  to  the  same search  as  others,  this will  be  well \nknown to other detainees with jail experience.  A hardened \ncriminal or gang member can, in just a few minutes, ap-\nproach the person and coerce him into hiding the fruits of \na crime, a weapon, or some other contraband.  As an ex-\npert in this case explained, “the interaction and mingling \nbetween misdemeanants and felons will only increase the  \n\n16  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOpinion of the Court  \namount of contraband in the facility if the jail can only \nconduct admission searches on felons.”  App. 381a.   Ex-\nempting people arrested for minor offenses from a stand-\nard search  protocol thus may put them at greater risk and \nresult in more contraband being brought into the deten-\ntion facility.  This is a substantial reason not to mandate \nthe exception petitioner seeks as a matter of constitutional \nlaw. \n2 \n  It also may be difficult, as a practical matter, to classify \ninmates  by  their  current  and  prior  offenses  before  the \nintake search.  Jails can be even more dangerous than \nprisons  because  officials  there  know  so  little  about  the \npeople they admit at the outset.  See New Jersey Wardens \nBrief 11–14.  An arrestee may be carrying a false ID or lie \nabout his identity.  The officers who conduct an initial \nsearch often do not have access to criminal history records.  \nSee, e.g., App. 235a; New Jersey Wardens Brief 13.  And \nthose records can be inaccurate or incomplete.  See De-\npartment of Justice v. Reporters  Comm. for Freedom of  \nPress, 489 U. S. 749, 752 (1989).  Petitioner’s rap sheet is \nan example.  It did not reflect his previous arrest for pos-\nsession of a deadly weapon.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–19.  In \nthe absence of reliable information it would be illogical to \nrequire officers to assume the arrestees in front of them do \nnot pose a risk of smuggling something into the facility.\n  The laborious administration of prisons would become \nless effective, and likely less fair and evenhanded, were \nthe practical problems inevitable from the rules suggested \nby petitioner to be imposed as a constitutional mandate.  \nEven if they had accurate information about a detainee’s \ncurrent and prior arrests, officers, under petitioner’s pro-\nposed  regime,  would  encounter  serious  implementation \ndifficulties.  They would be required, in a few minutes, to \ndetermine whether any of the underlying offenses were  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  17  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nserious  enough  to  authorize  the  more  invasive  search \nprotocol.  Other possible classifications based on charac-\nteristics  of  individual  detainees  also  might  prove  to  be \nunworkable or even give rise to charges of discriminatory \napplication.  Most officers would not be well equipped to \nmake any of these legal determinations during the pres-\nsures of the intake process.  Bull, 595 F. 3d, at 985–987  \n(Kozinski, C. J., concurring); see also Welsh v. Wisconsin, \n466  U. S.  740,  761–762  (1984)  (White,  J.,  dissenting) \n(“[T]he  Court’s  approach  will  necessitate  a  case-by-case \nevaluation of the seriousness of particular crimes, a dif- \nficult  task  for  which  officers  and  courts  are  poorly \nequipped”).  To avoid liability, officers might be inclined \nnot to conduct a thorough search in any close case, thus \ncreating unnecessary risk for the entire jail population.  \nCf. Atwater, 532 U. S., at 351, and n. 22. \n  The Court addressed an analogous problem in Atwater. \nThe petitioner in that case argued the Fourth Amendment \nprohibited a warrantless arrest when being convicted of \nthe suspected crime “could not ultimately carry any jail \ntime” and there was “no compelling need for immediate\ndetention.”  Id., at 346.  That rule “promise[d] very little in \nthe way of administrability.”  Id., at 350.  Officers could \nnot be expected to draw the proposed lines on a moment’s \nnotice, and the risk of violating the Constitution would \nhave discouraged them from arresting criminals in any \nquestionable circumstances.  Id.,  at 350–351 (“An officer\nnot quite sure the drugs weighed enough to warrant jail \ntime or not quite certain about a suspect’s risk of flight \nwould not arrest, even though it could perfectly well turn \nout that, in fact, the offense called for incarceration and \nthe defendant was long gone on the day of trial”).  The \nFourth Amendment did not compel this result in Atwater. \nThe Court held that officers who have probable cause to \nbelieve even a minor criminal offense has been committed \nin their presence may arrest the offender.  See id., at 354.   \n\n18  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nOOpipninioinon o fo fK tEhNeN CEoDuYr,  tJ .  \nIndividual jurisdictions can of course choose “to impose \nmore  restrictive  safeguards  through  statutes  limiting \nwarrantless arrests for minor offenders.”  Id., at 352. \n  One of the central principles in Atwater applies with\nequal force here.  Officers who interact with those sus-\npected of violating the law have an “essential interest in \nreadily administrable rules.”  Id., at 347; accord, New York  \nv. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458 (1981).  The officials in charge \nof the jails in this case urge the Court to reject any compli-\ncated constitutional scheme requiring them to conduct less \nthorough  inspections  of  some  detainees  based  on  their \nbehavior, suspected offense, criminal history, and other \nfactors.  They offer significant reasons why the Constitu-\ntion  must  not  prevent  them  from  conducting  the  same \nsearch on any suspected offender who will be admitted to\nthe general population in their facilities.  The restrictions  \nsuggested by petitioner would limit the intrusion on the \nprivacy  of  some  detainees  but  at  the  risk   of  increased \ndanger to everyone in the facility, including the less seri-\nous offenders themselves.  \nIV \n  This case does not require the Court to rule on the types \nof searches that would be reasonable in instances where, \nfor example, a detainee will be held without assignment to \nthe general jail population and without substantial contact\nwith other detainees.  This describes the circumstances in  \nAtwater.  See 532 U. S., at 324 (“Officers took Atwater’s \n‘mug shot’ and placed her, alone, in a jail cell for about one \nhour, after which she was taken before a magistrate and \nreleased on $310 bond”).  The accommodations provided in \nthese situations may diminish the need to conduct some\naspects of the searches at issue.  Cf. United States Brief 30 \n(discussing the segregation, and less invasive searches, of \nindividuals  held  by  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  for\nmisdemeanors  or  civil  contempt).    The  circumstances  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  19  \n \nOpinion of the Court \nbefore the Court, however, do not present the opportunity \nto consider a narrow exception of the sort JUSTICE  ALITO  \ndescribes, post, at 2–3 (concurring opinion), which might \nrestrict whether an arrestee whose detention has not yet \nbeen reviewed by a magistrate or other judicial officer, \nand who can be held in available facilities removed from \nthe general population, may be subjected to the types of \nsearches at issue here. \n  Petitioner’s  amici   raise  concerns  about  instances  of \nofficers  engaging  in  intentional  humiliation  and  other \nabusive practices.  See Brief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al.  \nas  Amici  Curiae;  see  also  Hudson,  468  U. S.,  at  528  \n(“[I]ntentional  harassment  of  even  the  most  hardened\ncriminals cannot be tolerated by a civilized society”); Bell, \n441 U. S., at 560.  There also may be legitimate concerns \nabout the invasiveness of searches that involve the touch-\ning of detainees.  These issues are not implicated on the \nfacts of this case, however, and it is unnecessary to con- \nsider them here. \nV \n  Even assuming all the facts in favor of petitioner, the \nsearch  procedures  at  the  Burlington  County  Detention\nCenter and the Essex County Correctional Facility struck \na  reasonable  balance  between  inmate  privacy  and  the \nneeds  of  the  institutions.

As with JUSTICE ALITO, \nhowever, it is important for me that the Court does not \nforeclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it an-\nnounces.

Those  circumstances  \ninclude  the  facts  that  Florence  was  detained  not  for  a  \nminor traffic offense but instead pursuant to a warrant for \nhis arrest, and that there was apparently no alternative, if \nFlorence were to be detained, to holding him in the gen-\neral jail population. \n  Factual nuances have not played a significant role as \nthis case has been presented to the Court.

The  Court  holds  that  jail  adminis- \ntrators may require all arrestees who are committed to \nthe general population of a jail to undergo visual strip\nsearches  not  involving  physical  contact  by  corrections \nofficers.  To perform the searches, officers may direct the \narrestees to disrobe, shower, and submit to a visual in-\nspection.  As part of the inspection, the arrestees may be \nrequired to manipulate their bodies.\n  Undergoing such an inspection is undoubtedly humiliat-\ning and deeply offensive to many, but there are reason- \nable grounds for strip searching arrestees before they are \nadmitted to the general population of a jail.  As the Court  \nexplains, there is a serious danger that some detainees \nwill attempt to smuggle weapons, drugs, or other contra-\nband into the jail.  Some detainees may have lice, which \ncan easily spread to others in the facility, and some de-\ntainees may have diseases or injuries for which the jail \nis required to provide medical treatment.  In addition, if a \ndetainee with gang-related tattoos is inadvertently housed \nwith detainees from a rival gang, violence may ensue. \n  Petitioner  and  the  dissent  would  permit  corrections \nofficers to conduct the visual strip search at issue here  \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nALITO,  J., concurring   \nonly if the officers have a reasonable basis  for thinking \nthat a particular arrestee may present a danger to other \ndetainees or members of the jail staff.  But as the Court \nexplains, corrections officers are often in a very poor posi-\ntion to make such a determination, and the threat to the \nhealth and safety of detainees and staff, should the offic-\ners miscalculate, is simply too great. \n  It is important to note, however, that the Court does not \nhold that it is always reasonable to conduct a full strip \nsearch of an arrestee whose detention has not been re-\nviewed by a judicial officer and who could be held in avail-\nable facilities apart from the general population.  Most of  \nthose arrested for minor offenses  are not dangerous, and \nmost are released from custody prior to or at the time of \ntheir  initial  appearance  before  a  magistrate.  In  some  \ncases, the charges are dropped.  In others, arrestees are \nreleased either on their own recognizance or on minimal \nbail.  In the end, few are sentenced to incarceration.  For  \nthese persons, admission to the general jail population, \nwith the concomitant humiliation of a strip search, may \nnot be reasonable, particularly if an alternative procedure \nis feasible.  For example, the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) and possibly even some local jails appear to segre-\ngate temporary detainees who are minor offenders from \nthe general population.  See, e.g., Brief for United States \nas Amicus Curiae 30; Bull v.

BOARD OF  \nCHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF  \nBURLINGTON ET  AL.  \nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF  \nAPPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT   \n[April 2, 2012]  \n JUSTICE   BREYER,  with  whom  JUSTICE  GINSBURG, \nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,  and JUSTICE  KAGAN join, dissenting. \n  The  petition  for  certiorari  asks  us  to  decide \n“[w]hether the Fourth Amendment permits a . . . suspi-\ncionless  strip  search  of  every  individual  arrested  for \nany minor offense . . .  .”  Pet. for Cert. i.  This question \nis phrased more broadly than what is at issue.  The \ncase  is  limited  to  strip  searches  of  those  arrestees \nentering a jail’s general population, see 621 F. 3d 296, \n298 (CA3 2010).  And the kind of strip search in ques-\ntion  involves  more  than  undressing  and  taking  a  \nshower  (even  if  guards  monitor  the  shower  area  for \nthreatened  disorder).  Rather,  the  searches  here  in-\nvolve close observation of the private areas of a per-\nson’s body and for that reason constitute a far more \nserious invasion of that person’s privacy. \n  The visually invasive kind of strip search at issue \nhere is not unique.  A similar practice is well described  \nin  Dodge  v.  County  of   Orange,  282  F.  Supp.  2d  41 \n(SDNY  2003).    In  that  New  York  case,  the  “strip \nsearch”  (as  described  in  a  relevant  prison  manual) \ninvolved: \n“‘a visual inspection of the inmate’s naked body.  This \n \nshould  include  the  inmate  opening  his  mouth  and \n\n2  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nmoving his tongue up and down and from side to side, \nremoving any dentures, running his hands through \nhis hair, allowing his ears to be visually examined, \nlifting his arms to expose his arm pits, lifting his feet \nto examine the sole, spreading and/or lifting his testi-\ncles to expose the area behind them and bending over\nand/or spreading the cheeks of his buttocks to expose \nhis anus.  For females, the procedures are similar ex-\ncept females must in addition, squat to expose the \nvagina.’”  Id., at 46. \n \nBecause the Dodge court obtained considerable empirical \ninformation about the need for such a search in respect \nto minor offenders, and because the searches alleged in \nthis case do not differ significantly, I shall use the succinct  \nDodge  description  as  a  template  for  the  kind  of  strip \nsearch to which the Question Presented refers.  See, e.g., \nApp.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  3a–4a  (alleging  that  officers  in-\nspected his genitals from an arm’s length away, required \nhim to lift his genitals, and examined his anal cavity). \n  In my view, such a search of an individual arrested for a \nminor offense that does not involve drugs or violence—say \na traffic offense, a regulatory offense, an essentially civil \nmatter, or any other such misdemeanor—is an “unreason-\nable searc[h]” forbidden by the Fourth Amendment, unless \nprison  authorities  have  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe\nthat the individual possesses drugs or other contraband.  \nAnd I dissent from the Court’s contrary determination. \nI \n  Those  confined  in  prison  retain  basic  constitutional \nrights.  Bell  v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979); Turner  \nv. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987) (“Prison walls do not \nform a barrier separating prison inmates from the protec-\ntions of the Constitution”).  The constitutional right at \nissue here is the Fourth Amendment right to be free of \n“unreasonable searches and seizures.”  And, as the Court \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  3 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nnotes, the applicable standard is the Fourth Amendment \nbalancing inquiry announced regarding prison inmates  in \nBell v.  Wolfish, supra.  The Court said: \n“The  test  of  reasonableness  under  the  Fourth  \nAmendment is not capable of precise definition or me-\nchanical application.  In each case it requires a bal-\nancing of the need for the particular search against \nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.  \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular in-\ntrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justi-\nfication for initiating it, and the place in which it is \nconducted.”   Id., at 559.  \nI have described in general terms, see supra, at 1–2, the \nplace,  scope  and  manner  of  “the  particular  intrusion.”  \nBell, 441 U. S., at 559.  I now explain why I believe that \nthe “invasion of personal rights” here is very serious and \nlacks need or justification, ibid.—at least as to the cate-\ngory of minor offenders at issue.  \nII  \n  A strip search that involves a stranger peering without \nconsent at a naked individual, and in particular at the \nmost private portions of that person’s body, is a serious in-\nvasion of privacy.  We have recently said, in respect to a \nschoolchild (and a less intrusive search), that the “mean-\ning of such a search, and the degradation its subject may \nreasonably feel, place a search that intrusive in a category \nof its own demanding its own specific suspicions.”  Safford \nUnified  School  Dist.  #1  v.  Redding,  557  U. S.  ___,  ___  \n(2009) (slip op., at 11).  The Courts of Appeals have more \ndirectly described the privacy interests at stake, writing, \nfor example, that practices similar to those at issue here \nare “demeaning, dehumanizing, undignified, humiliating, \nterrifying,  unpleasant,  embarrassing,  [and]  repulsive, \nsignifying degradation and submission.”  Mary Beth G. v. \n\n4  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nChicago, 723 F. 2d 1263, 1272 (CA7 1984) (internal quota-\ntion marks omitted); see also, e.g., Blackburn v. Snow, 771 \nF. 2d 556, 564 (CA1 1985) (“‘[A]ll courts’” have recognized \n   \nthe “‘severe if not gross interference with a person’s pri-\n  \nvacy’” that accompany visual body cavity searches (quoting  \n \nArruda v. Fair, 710 F. 2d 886, 887 (CA1 1983))).  These  \nkinds of searches also gave this Court the “most pause” in \nBell, supra, at 558  (guards strip searched prisoners after \nthey received outside visits).  Even when carried out in a \nrespectful manner, and even absent any physical touching,  \nsee ante at 4–5, 19, such searches are inherently harmful, \nhumiliating,  and  degrading.  And  the  harm  to  privacy\ninterests would seem particularly acute where the person \nsearched may well have no expectation of being subject\nto such a search, say, because she had simply received a \ntraffic ticket for failing to buckle a seatbelt, because he \nhad not previously paid a civil fine, or because she had \nbeen arrested for a minor trespass.\nIn Atwater v. Lago Vista,  532 U. S. 318, 323–324 (2001), \nfor example, police arrested a mother driving with her two \nchildren because their seat belts were not buckled.  This  \nCourt held that the Constitution did not forbid an arrest  \nfor a minor seatbelt offense.  Id., at 323.  But, in doing so, \nit pointed out that the woman was held for only an hour \n(before being taken to a magistrate and released on bond) \nand that the search—she had to remove her shoes, jew-\nelry, and the contents of her pockets, id., at 355—was not \n“‘unusually harmful to [her] privacy or . . . physical inter-\n \nests.’”  Id., at 354 (quoting Whren v. United States, 517 \n \nU. S. 806, 818 (1996)).  Would this Court have upheld the \narrest had the magistrate not been immediately available, \nhad the police housed her overnight in the jail, and had \nthey subjected her to a search of the kind at issue here?  \nCf. County of Riverside v.  McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56  \n(1991) (presentment must be within 48 hours after arrest).\n  The petitioner, Albert W. Florence, states that his pre-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  5 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nsent arrest grew out of an (erroneous) report that he had \nfailed to pay a minor civil fine previously assessed because \nhe had hindered a prosecution (by fleeing police officers \nin his automobile).  App. 25a–26a.  He alleges that he was \nheld for six days in jail before being taken to a magistrate \nand that he was subjected to two strip searches of the kind \nin question.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. \n  Amicus briefs present other instances in which individ-\nuals arrested for minor offenses have been subjected to \nthe humiliations of a visual strip search.  They include a\nnun, a Sister of Divine Providence for 50 years, who was ar-\nrested for trespassing during an antiwar demonstration.  \nBrief for Sister Bernie Galvin et al. as Amici Curiae 6.   \nThey  include  women  who  were  strip-searched  during \nperiods of lactation or menstruation.  Id., at 11–12 (de-\nscribing humiliating experience of  female student who was \nstrip searched while menstruating); Archuleta v. Wagner, \n523 F. 3d 1278, 1282 (CA10 2008) (same for woman lac-\ntating).  They include victims of sexual violence.  Brief \nfor Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals \nProject et al. as Amici Curiae.  They include individuals \ndetained for such infractions as driving with a noisy muf-\nfler, driving with an inoperable headlight, failing to use a \nturn signal, or riding a bicycle without an audible bell.  \nBrief for Petitioner 11, 25; see also Mary Beth G., supra, at  \n1267, n. 2 (considering strip search of a person arrested for \nhaving outstanding parking tickets and a person arrested \nfor making an improper left turn);  Jones v. Edwards, 770 \nF. 2d 739, 741 (CA8 1985) (same for violation of dog leash \nlaw).  They  include  persons  who  perhaps  should  never\nhave been placed in the general jail population in the first \nplace.  See ante, at 2  (ALITO,  J. concurring) (“admission to \ngeneral jail population, with the concomitant humiliation\nof a strip search, may not be reasonable” for those “whose \ndetention has not been reviewed by a judicial officer and \nwho could not be held in available facilities apart from the \n\n6  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \ngeneral population”).\n  I need not go on.  I doubt that we seriously disagree \nabout the nature of the strip search or about the serious \naffront to human dignity and to individual privacy that it  \npresents.  The basic question before us is  whether such \na search is nonetheless justified when an individual ar-\nrested for a minor offense is involuntarily placed in the \ngeneral jail or prison population. \nIII  \n  The  majority,  like  the  respondents,  argues  that  strip \nsearches are needed (1) to detect injuries or diseases, such \nas lice, that might spread in confinement, (2) to identify \ngang tattoos, which might reflect a need for special hous-\ning to avoid violence, and (3) to detect contraband, includ-\ning drugs, guns, knives, and even pens or chewing gum, \nwhich might prove harmful or dangerous in prison.  In \nevaluating this argument, I, like the majority, recognize: \nthat managing a jail or prison is an “inordinately difficult \nundertaking,” Turner,  482 U. S., at 85;  that prison regula-\ntions that interfere with important constitutional interests \nare generally valid as long as they are “reasonably related \nto legitimate penological interests,” id., at 89; that finding \ninjuries and preventing the spread of disease, minimizing \nthe threat of gang violence, and detecting contraband are \n“legitimate penological interests,” ibid.; and that we nor-\nmally defer to the expertise of jail and prison administra-\ntors in such matters, id., at 85. \n  Nonetheless, the “particular” invasion of interests, Bell, \n441 U. S., at 559, must be “‘reasonably related’” to the jus-\n   \ntifying “penological interest” and the need must not be \n“‘exaggerated.’”  Turner, supra, at 87.  It is at this point \n   \nthat I must part company with the majority.  I have found \nno convincing reason indicating that, in the absence of \nreasonable suspicion, involuntary strip searches of those \narrested for minor offenses are necessary in order to fur-\n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  7 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nther the penal interests mentioned.  And there are strong \nreasons to believe they are not justified. \n  The lack of justification is fairly obvious with respect to \nthe first two penological interests advanced.  The searches \nalready  employed  at  Essex  and  Burlington  include:  (a) \npat-frisking all inmates; (b) making inmates go through\nmetal  detectors  (including  the  Body  Orifice  Screening \nSystem (BOSS) chair used at Essex County Correctional \nFacility that identifies metal hidden within the body); (c) \nmaking  inmates  shower  and  use  particular  delousing \nagents  or  bathing  supplies;  and  (d)  searching  inmates’ \nclothing.  In addition, petitioner concedes that detainees\ncould be lawfully subject to being viewed in their under-\ngarments by jail officers or during showering (for security \npurposes).  Brief for  Petitioner 9; Tr. of  Oral Arg. 7–8 \n(“Showering in the presence of officers is not something \nthat  requires  reasonable  suspicion”).    No  one  here  has  \noffered any reason, example, or empirical evidence sug-\ngesting  the  inadequacy  of  such  practices  for  detecting \ninjuries, diseases, or tattoos.  In particular, there is no \nconnection  between  the  genital  lift  and  the  “squat  and\ncough” that Florence was allegedly subjected to and health  \nor gang concerns.  See Brief for Academics on Gang Be-\nhavior as Amici Curiae; Brief for Medical Society of New \nJersey et al. as Amici Curiae. \n  The lack of justification for such a strip search is less \nobvious but no less real in respect to the third interest, \nnamely  that  of  detecting  contraband.  The  information \ndemonstrating the lack of justification is of three kinds. \nFirst, there are empirically based conclusions reached in \nspecific cases.  The New York Federal District Court, to  \nwhich I have referred, conducted a study of 23,000 persons \nadmitted to the Orange County correctional facility be-\ntween 1999 and 2003.  Dodge, 282 F. Supp. 2d, at 69.  \nThese 23,000 persons underwent a  strip search of the kind \ndescribed, supra, at 1.  Of these 23,000 persons, the court \n\n8  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF  \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON   \nBREYER,  J., dissenting  \nwrote, “the County encountered three incidents of drugs \nrecovered from an inmate’s anal cavity and two incidents \nof drugs falling from an inmate’s underwear during the \ncourse of a strip search.”  282 F.  Supp. 2d, at 69.  The \ncourt added that in four of these five instances there may \nhave been “reasonable suspicion” to search, leaving only \none instance in 23,000 in which the strip search policy \n“arguably” detected additional contraband.  Id., at 70.   The  \nstudy is imperfect, for search standards changed during \nthe time it was conducted.  Id., at 50–51.  But the large\nnumber of inmates, the small number of “incidents,” and \nthe District Court’s own conclusions make the study pro-\nbative though not conclusive.\n  Similarly, in Shain v.  Ellison, 273 F. 3d 56, 60 (CA2  \n2001),  the court received data produced by the county \njail showing that authorities conducted body-cavity strip \nsearches, similar to those at issue here, of 75,000 new \ninmates over a period of five years.  Brief for Plaintiff-\nAppellee-Cross-Appellant in No. 00–7061 etc. (CA2), p. 16 \n(citing  to  its  App.  343a–493a).    In  16  instances  the \nsearches led to the discovery of contraband.  The record  \nfurther showed that 13 of these 16 pieces of contraband \nwould have been detected in a patdown or a search of shoes \nand outer-clothing.  In the three instances in  which contra-\nband was found on the detainee’s body or in a body cavity, \nthere was a drug or felony history that would have justi-\nfied a strip search on individualized reasonable suspicion.   \nIbid.; Brief for National Police Accountability Project as  \nAmicus Curiae 10. \n  Second,  there  is  the  plethora  of  recommendations  of \nprofessional bodies, such as correctional associations, that \nhave studied and thoughtfully considered the matter.  The  \nAmerican Correctional Association (ACA)—an association \nthat informs our view of “what is obtainable and what is  \nacceptable in corrections philosophy,” Brown v. Plata, 563 \nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 43)—has promulgated a \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  9 \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nstandard that forbids suspicionless strip searches.  And \nit has done so after consultation with the American Jail \nAssociation,  National  Sheriff’s  Association,  National  In- \nstitute of Corrections of the Department of Justice, and \nFederal  Bureau  of  Prisons.

Katsampes, Sheriff’s Guide to Effective Jail \nOperations 50 (2007).\n  Moreover, many correctional facilities apply a reason-\nable  suspicion  standard  before  strip  searching  inmates \nentering the general jail population, including the U. S. \nMarshals Service, the Immigration and Customs Service, \nand the Bureau of Indian Affairs.   See U.  S.

The Federal Bureau \n\n10  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nof Prisons (BOP) itself forbids suspicionless strip searches \nfor minor offenders, though it houses separately (and does \nnot admit to the general jail population) a person who does \nnot consent to such a search.  See Dept. of Justice, BOP \nProgram  Statement  5140.38,  p. 5.  (2004),  http://www. \nbop.gov/policy/progstat/5140_038.pdf. \n  Third, there is general experience in areas where the \nlaw  has  forbidden  here-relevant  suspicionless  searches.  \nLaws  in  at  least  10  States  prohibit  suspicionless  strip \nsearches.  See, e.g., Mo. Stat. Ann. §544.193.2 (2002) (“No \nperson  arrested  or  detained  for  a  traffic  offense  or  an \noffense which does not constitute a felony may be subject \nto a strip search or a body cavity search . . . unless there is \nprobable cause to believe that such person is concealing a \nweapon . . . or contraband”); Kan. Stat. Ann. §22–2521(a) \n(2007) (similar); Iowa Code §804.30 (2009) (similar); 725 \nIll. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, §5/103–1(c) (2011) (similar but \nrequiring  “reasonable  belief ”);  501  Ky.  Admin.  Regs. \n3:120, §3(1)(b) (2011) (similar); Tenn. Code Ann. §40–7–\n119 (2006) (similar); Colo. Rev. Stat.

Code §10.79.130(1) (2010) (similar). \n  At the same time at least seven Courts of Appeals have \nconsidered  the  question  and  have  required  reasonable\nsuspicion that an arrestee is concealing weapons or con-\ntraband before a strip search of one arrested for a minor \noffense can take place.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Rhode Island, \n239 F. 3d 107, 112–113 (CA1 2001); Weber v.  Dell, 804 \nF. 2d  796,  802  (CA2  1986);  Logan  v.  Shealy,  660  F. 2d \n1007, 1013 (CA4 1981);  Stewart v.

City and County of San Francisco, \n595 F. 3d 964, 975 (CA9 2010) (en banc); Powell v. Barrett, \n541 F. 3d 1298, 1307 (CA11 2008) (en banc).  Respondents \nhave  not  presented  convincing  grounds  to  believe  that\nadministration of these legal standards has increased the \nsmuggling of contraband into prison. \n  Indeed, neither the majority’s opinion nor the briefs set \nforth any clear example of an instance in which contra-\nband was smuggled into the general jail population during \nintake that could not have been discovered if the jail was \nemploying a reasonable suspicion standard.  The majority\ndoes  cite  general  examples  from  Atlantic  County  and \nWashington State where contraband has been recovered \nin correctional facilities from inmates arrested for driving \nunder the influence and disorderly conduct.  Ante, at 15.   \nSimilarly, the majority refers to information, provided by \nSan  Francisco  jail  authorities,  stating  that  they  have \nfound  handcuff  keys,  syringes,  crack  pipes,  drugs,  and \nknives  during  body-cavity  searches,  including  during \nsearches of minor offenders, including a man arrested for \nillegally lodging (drugs), and a woman arrested for prosti-\ntution  and  public  nuisance  (“bindles  of  crack  cocaine”).  \nBrief for City and County of San  Francisco et  al. as Amici \nCuriae 7–13; Bull, supra, at  969; ante, at 15.  And associ-\nated statistics indicate that the policy of conducting visual \ncavity searches of all those admitted to the general popu-\nlation in San Francisco may account for the discovery of \ncontraband in approximately 15 instances per year.  Bull, \nsupra, at 969. \n  But neither San Francisco nor the respondents tell us  \nwhether reasonable suspicion was  present or absent in any \nof  the  15  instances.    Nor  is  there  any  showing  by  the \nmajority  that  the  few  unclear  examples  of  contraband \nrecovered in Atlantic County, Washington State, or any-\nwhere else could not have been discovered through a policy \n\n12  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nthat required reasonable suspicion for strip searches.  And \nwithout some such indication, I am left without an exam-\nple of any instance in which contraband was found on an \nindividual through an inspection of their private parts or \nbody cavities which could not have been found under a \npolicy requiring reasonable suspicion.  Hence, at a mini-\nmum these examples, including San Francisco’s statistics, \ndo not provide a significant counterweight to those pre-\nsented in Dodge and Shain.  \n  Nor do I find the majority’s lack of examples surprising.  \nAfter  all,  those  arrested  for  minor  offenses  are  often  \nstopped  and  arrested  unexpectedly.  And  they  conse-\nquently will have had little opportunity to hide things in \ntheir body cavities.  Thus, the widespread advocacy by \nprison experts and the widespread application in many \nStates and federal circuits of “reasonable suspicion” re-\nquirements indicates an ability to apply such standards in \npractice without unduly interfering with the legitimate penal \ninterest in preventing the smuggling of contraband. \n  The majority is left with the word of prison officials in\nsupport of its contrary proposition.  And though that word \nis important, it cannot be sufficient.  Cf. Dept. of Justice, \nNational Institute of Corrections, W. Collins,  Jails and the \nConstitution: An Overview 28–29 (2d ed. 2007) (Though \nprison  officials  often  “passionately  believed”  similar  re-\nquirements  would  lead  to  contraband-related  security \nproblems,  once  those  requirements  were  imposed  those \n“problems did not develop”).\n  The majority also relies upon Bell, 441 U. S.  520, itself.  \nAnte, at 5–6.  In that case, the Court considered a prison \npolicy requiring a strip search of all detainees after “con-\ntact visits” with unimprisoned visitors.  441 U. S., at 558.  \nThe Court found that policy justified.  Id., at 560.  Con-\ntrary to the  majority’s suggestion, that case does not pro-\nvide precedent for the proposition that the word of prison \nofficials (accompanied by a “single instance” of empirical  \n\n  Cite as:  566 U. S. ____ (2012)  13  \n \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nexample)  is  sufficient  to  support  a  strip  search  policy.   \nAnte, at 6.  The majority correctly points out that there \nwas but “one instance” in which the policy had led to the \ndiscovery of an effort to smuggle contraband.  Bell, 441 \nU. S.,  at 558.  But the Court understood that the prison \nhad been open only four months.  Id., at 526.  And the \nCourt  was  also  presented  with  other  examples  where \ninmates attempted to smuggle contraband during contact \nvisits.  Id., at 559. \n  It is true that in Bell the Court found the prison jus-\ntified in conducting postcontact searches even as to pre-\ntrial detainees who had been brought before a magistrate, \ndenied bail, and “committed to the detention facility only \nbecause  no  other  less  drastic  means  [could]  reasonably \nassure [their] presence at trial.”  441 U. S., at 546, n. 28.  \nThe Court recognized that those ordered detained by a\nmagistrate were often those “charged with serious crimes, \nor who have prior records.”  Ibid.  For that reason, those  \ndetainees posed at least the same security risk as con-\nvicted inmates, if not “a greater risk to jail security and \norder,”  and  a  “greater  risk  of  escape.”    Ibid.  And,  of  \ncourse, in Bell, both the inmates at issue and their visitors \nhad the time to plan to smuggle contraband in that case, \nunlike those persons at issue here (imprisoned soon after \nan unexpected arrest). \n  The  Bell  Court  had  no  occasion  to  focus  upon  those \narrested for minor crimes, prior to a judicial officer’s de-\ntermination that they should be committed to prison.  I \nshare JUSTICE ALITO’s intuition that the calculus may be \ndifferent in such cases, given that “[m]ost of those arrested \nfor minor offenses are not dangerous, and most are re-\nleased from custody prior to or at the time of their initial \nappearance before a magistrate.”   Ante, at 2 (concurring \nopinion).  As he notes, this case does not address, and \n“reserves judgment on,” whether it is always reasonable\n“to strip search an arrestee before the arrestee’s detention  \n\n14  FLORENCE v. BOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF \n  COUNTY OF BURLINGTON  \nBREYER,  J., dissenting \nhas been reviewed by a judicial officer.”  Ante, at 3.  In my \nview,  it  is  highly  questionable  that  officials  would  be \njustified, for instance, in admitting to the dangerous world \nof the general jail population and subjecting to a strip \nsearch someone with no criminal background arrested for \njaywalking or another similarly minor crime, supra, at 5.   \nIndeed, that consideration likely underlies why the Fed-\neral Government and many States segregate such individ-\nuals even when admitted to jail, and several jurisdictions \nprovide that such individuals be released without deten-\ntion in the ordinary case.  See,  e.g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. \n§853.6 (West Supp. 2012). \n  In an appropriate case, therefore, it remains open for \nthe Court to consider whether it would be reasonable to  \nadmit an arrestee for a minor offense to the general jail \npopulation, and to subject her to the “humiliation of a strip \nsearch,” prior to any review by a judicial officer.  Ante, at 2 \n(ALITO,  J.,  concurring).  \n*    *    * \n  For the reasons set forth, I cannot find justification for \nthe strip search policy at issue here—a policy that would \nsubject those arrested for minor offenses to serious inva-\nsions of their personal privacy.  I consequently dissent. ",

Plaintiff Albert W. Florence brings this action against Defendants to redress the deprivation of\nrights secured him by the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United\nStates Constitution, 42 U.S.C. §§1983,1985 & 1986.  \n2. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§1331, 1332, and 1343(a)(3),\nand 42 U.S.C. §1983.  The matter in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000, exclusive of\ninterest and costs.\n3.   Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391 as the cause of action occurred in\nthis District.\nParties\n4. At all times mentioned herein, Plaintiff was a resident of  Middlesex County, New Jersey.\n5. At all times mentioned herein,  each Defendant was and is, upon information and belief, a\ncitizen of New Jersey.  \n6. At all times hereinafter mentioned, the Defendant Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington was a body corporate and politic of the State New Jersey operating and existing\nunder the laws of the State of New Jersey, and located in the County of Burlington  in said State\nand operating and overseeing Defendant Burlington County Jail.\n7. At all times hereinafter mentioned, Defendant Warden Juel Cole was in charge of operating the\nBurlington County Jail and managing and supervising the personnel thereat, including John\nDoes 1-5 who were officers and or employees of Defendant Burlington County Jail. These\nDefendants are being sued in the individual and official capacities.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 2 of 12 PageID: 130\n8. At all times hereinafter mentioned,  Defendant Essex County Sheriff‘s Department was in\ncharge of  transporting Plaintiff to Essex County for a hearing.\n9. At all times hereinafter mentioned, Defendant  Burlington County Jail operated under State law\nand incarcerated Plaintiff and subjected Plaintiff to strip searches by it’s employees John Does\n1-5.  These Defendants are being sued in the individual and official capacities.\n10.At all times hereinafter mentioned, Defendant  Essex County Correctional Facility operated\nunder State law and incarcerated Plaintiff and subjected Plaintiff to strip searches by it’s\nemployees John Does 6-8.\n11.Defendants John Does 4-5 were officers and employees of Defendant Burlington County Jail\nwho ignored Plaintiff’s protests of innocence and discriminated against Plaintiff based on his\nrace while he was incarcerated at Defendant Burlington County Jail.  These Defendants are\nbeing sued in the individual and official capacities.\n12. At the time of the alleged incident and at all times pertinent hereto, Defendants acted under\ncolor of law, of a statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage in the State of New Jersey\nand sometimes beyond that scope.\nFacts\n13.On or about March 3, 2005, at about 7:30 p.m. Plaintiff  Albert, a Black male, was a passenger\nin his vehicle, a BMW X5 Sports Utility vehicle,  being driven by his wife, Plaintiff April, a Black\nfemale, who was 7 months pregnant, with their 4 year old son seated in the back.\n14.Plaintiff’s vehicle was stopped about  2 miles on the 295 Southbound  from Exit 46, by a State\nTrooper who directed Plaintiff  to exit the vehicle and arrested him based upon an  Essex\nCounty  warrant.  \n15.At all times during this stop and arrest, Plaintiff Albert repeatedly told the State Trooper that the\nwarrant was satisfied and he should not be the subject of an arrest and offered proof of a\ncertified letter dated October, 2004 with a raised seal from the State of New Jersey that all\njudgments against Plaintiff were satisfied and no warrant existed against him. \n16.After the State Trooper radioed headquarters, he handcuffed and arrested Plaintiff Albert while\nhis 4 year old son and pregnant wife  watched him cuffed and taken away.  \n17.Plaintiff was transported to and processed at Burlington County Jail by a full strip and cavity\nsearch.  Plaintiff was imprisoned at Burlington County Jail for 6 days and nights.\n18. At all times while imprisoned at the Burlington County Jail,  Plaintiff Albert  repeatedly told jail\npersonnel that the warrant was satisfied and he should not be the subject of an arrest and\noffered proof of a certified letter dated October, 2004 with a raised seal from the State of New\nJersey that all judgments against Plaintiff were satisfied and no warrant existed against him.\n19. At all times during the detention, Defendant Juel Cole was the Warden of the Burlington County\nJail. \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 3 of 12 PageID: 131\n20. At all times during the detention, Defendant Warden Cole was charged with the care and\ncustody of all inmates including Plaintiff. \n21.At all times during the detention, Warden Cole was the supervisor of the personnel at the\nBurlington County Jail and had knowledge of Plaintiff's protests that he was unlawfully arrested\nand detained.\n22.During all the time Plaintiff was imprisoned at Burlington County Jail, there was a magistrate\ncompetent, willing, able, and ready  to have Plaintiff taken before him or her.  During that entire\ntime, the magistrate was accessible and available, and Plaintiff was physically and mentally in a\ncondition to be brought before the magistrate.\n23.During the entire time of Plaintiff’s imprisonment at Defendant Burlington County Jail, he was\nrefused access to the phone, refused access to the shower, refused a kit that would have\ncontained a tooth brush, towel and soap and refused permission to talk to a social worker.\nWhen Plaintiff requested any of those services, the Defendant officers john Does 4-5 denied\nhim, stating that he  was a “holdover.\n24. At all times relevant herein, the white inmates at Burlington County Jail were given towels,\ntoothbrushes, toothpaste, showers, phone calls, soap, and toilet paper but Plaintiff ,who was\nBlack, was denied these basic needs.\n25.Plaintiff  hired an attorney and paid $1,000.00.  \n26. After the 6th night at Defendant Burlington County Jail, the Defendant Essex County Sheriff’s\nDepartment transported Plaintiff to Essex County Correctional Facility where Plaintiff was\nprocessed again by a full strip and cavity search, fingerprinted and photographed then placed in\na cell with the general population.\n27.Plaintiff was imprisoned at Defendant Essex County Jail for 24 hours.\n28. Plaintiff was imprisoned at both Defendants Burlington County Jail and Essex County Jail for a\ntotal of 7 days from March 3, 2005 to March 10, 2005.\n29. On the 7th day, Hon. Michael Casale, Judge of the Superior Court  dismissed the charges\nagainst Plaintiff based on the fact that the warrant against Plaintiff did not exist and  there was\nno cause for the arrest.\nCount One: §1983 Unlawful Arrest\n30.Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 30.\n31. Defendant Burlington County Jail is run and operated by the State of New Jersey.\n32. Defendants  Burlington County Jail arrested  Plaintiff Albert without probable cause. \n33. Charges were never officially filed against Plaintiff.\n34.  By reason of said unlawful arrest while  Defendants acted under color of state or territorial law,\nPlaintiff  was deprived of his federal rights to liberty and freedom.\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 4 of 12 PageID: 132\nCount Two: §1983 False Imprisonment\n35. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 35.\n36.  Defendants Burlington County Jail, Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholdres, Warden\nJuel Cole, and John Does 1-8, Essex County Correctional Facility and Essex County Sherriff’s\nDepartment  falsely imprisoned Plaintiff  based on  detaining him first at Burlington County and\nkeeping him there for 6 days and making him wait until Defendant Essex County Sherriff’s\nDepartment picked him up the seventh day and detained him in Essex County Correctional\nFacility when no arrest warrant existed and despite Plaintiff’s protests and proof no warrant\nexisted.\n37. By reason of said false imprisonment while  Defendants acted under color of state or territorial\nlaw, Plaintiff was deprived of his federal rights to liberty and freedom.\nCount Three: §1983 4th Amendment-Unlawful Strip Body Search\nAnd CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS\n38. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 38.\n39.   The Plaintiff  brings this action under  Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(1-3) the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure on behalf of  himself and a class consisting of each person who, in the two years\npreceding the filing of this action up until the date this case is terminated, was or will be, (i) upon\nbeing arrested, processed and committed into the Burlington County Jail or the Essex County\nCorrectional Facility (ii) on a charge other than a charge of drugs, weapons or felony violence;\nand (iii) was and is subjected to a blanket strip search without any individualized finding of\nreasonable suspicion or probable cause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other\ncontraband.\n40.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) is appropriate because\nBurlington County Jail and Essex County Correctional Facility have a policy, and engage in a\npattern and practice of conduct that has uniformly affected all members of the class. \n41.  Injunctive relief against Defendants to enjoin the practice will benefit the Plaintiff  and each and\nevery class member unlawfully strip searched at the Essex County Correctional Facility and\nBurlington County Jail.\n42.  The class is entitled to injunctive relief of terminating the above described policy and practice of\nsubjecting arrestees to blanket strip searches without any individualized finding of reasonable\nsuspicion, or probable cause that he or she was concealing drugs, weapons or other\ncontraband.\n43.  Certification of a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) is also appropriate in that\ncommon questions of law and fact predominate over any individual questions. A class action is\nfar superior for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy as detailed below.\n44.  Regarding Plaintiff and members of the class, there are no individual questions on the issue of\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 5 of 12 PageID: 133\nliability. Every arrestee committed into the Burlington County Jail and Essex County\nCorrectional Facility is subjected to blanket strip searches. Defendants Burlington County Jail\nand Essex County Correctional Facility possess records of these searches via (a) Burlington\nCounty Jail’s  Strip Search Authorization forms evidencing no reasonable suspicion of drugs,\ncontraband or weapons nor an indictable offense committed and other records, booking records\nand computer input and  (b) Essex County Correctional Facilty’s records, booking records and\ncomputer input; therefore, by their own records and procedures, Defendants can not deny that\nany of the searches were not conducted based on an individual determination of reasonable\nsuspicion. Should records exist demonstrating an individualized suspicion, such people would,\nby definition, not be members of the class.\n45.  Among the questions of law and fact common to the class are:\n  a) whether Defendants Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington and/or Joel\nCole  and Defendants Essex County Correctional Facility instituted a policy or acquiesced in a\ncustom and practice of subjecting arrestees committed to the Burlington County Jail  and Essex\nCounty Correctional Facility pending presentment to blanket strip searches without an\nindividualized determination that the arrestees were in possession of drugs, weapons or other\ncontraband;\n  b) whether such policy or practice, if found to exist, violates the Fourth or Fourteenth\nAmendment, and whether such a written and/or de facto policy existed during the Class period.\n46.Defendants Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders, Burlington County Jail  and Cole,\nthrough its agents, had notice of the strip searches before the class period through\ncommunications with county agents, inmates and other methods that they maintain a blanket\npolicy of  directing.\n47. Defendants Burlington County, Warden Joel Cole, Burlington County Jail and Essex County\nCorrectional Facility have within their records the names and addresses of all current and past\nclass members. This information is maintained in the Burlington County Jail and Essex County\nCorrectional computer systems ( Mainframe), logbooks, Booking Records and other paper\nrecords maintained by those Defendants.\n48. The class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. The exact number of\nclass members is unknown to Plaintiff at this time. However, every week at least 50 persons are\nstrip and body cavity searched under a blanket strip search policy upon being committed into\nthe Burlington County Jail and Essex County Correctional Facility pending presentment.  All are\nsubject to the illegal searches. Thus, this class well exceeds 10,000 members.\n49. Joinder of all these individuals is impracticable because of the large number of Class members\nand the fact that Class members are probably dispersed over a large geographical area, with\nsome members, including Plaintiff, residing outside of Burlington and Essex Counties and this\nJudicial District.  Furthermore, many Class members most probably are low income persons,\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 6 of 12 PageID: 134\nmay not speak English, may not know of their rights and would have difficulty in pursuing their\nrights individually. Thus, the expense and burden of individual litigation would make it difficult or\nimpossible for individual Class members to redress the wrongs they suffered. The cost to the\nfederal court system of adjudicating thousands of individual cases would be enormous.\nIndividualized litigation would  magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court\nsystem. By contrast, to proceed via this action as a class action in this District presents far\nfewer management difficulties, conserves the resources of the parties and the court system, and\nprotects the rights of each member of the Class.\n50.  The Plaintiff's  claims are typical of the claims of the class members because the Plaintiff, and\nall other members of the class, were injured by exactly the same means- blanket strip searches.\n51.  The Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the class. Plaintiff\nhas retained competent and experienced counsel in both federal civil rights and class action\nlitigation, with criminal defense knowledge and experience applicable  to this case.\n52. Susan Chana Lask, Esq. is an experienced civil rights litigator and criminal defense counsel\nwho handled nationwide class actions, including  multi-million dollar complex Federal\nHazardous Waste Litigation involving numerous government agencies starting with her work in\n1986 with the preeminent national firm of Rivkin, Radler, Dunne and Bayh (working with New\nYork’s then senators and partners Senators Dunne & Bayh) in the chemical warfare Agent\nOrange case against Morton Thikol, the chemical creosote pollution case against James\nGraham Brown Foundation in Kentucky, Alabama and Florida, the existence of PCB pollutants\nin the Hudson River, working in Los Angeles with class action counsel against Taco Bell for\nlaborers’ wages and her successful work with attorney general’s nationwide and other\ngovernment agencies in bringing a successful settlement of  the class action RICO suit against\nMiss Cleo. Also, she settled a class action for New York City drivers wherein the City of New\nYork changed traffic violation procedures and law upon Ms. Lask demonstrating  class members\nwere  being ticketed under a law that did not exist. In 1995 she handled an international white\ncollar criminal case involving complicated air traffic laws leading the news media to follow Ms.\nLask’s work worldwide.  She was counsel to a Lloyd’s of London agent in New York\ninvestigating and llitigating worldwide multi-million dollar freight losses. Ms. Lask’s law offices\njoined with Michael Calabro, Esq. in this civil rights case because of his background as a former\nNew Jersey Detective and a New Jersey, Essex County prosecutor because his experience is\npertinent to this litigation when split second information regarding New Jersey police and jail\nprocedure are needed, as well as Mr. Calabro’s credentials include his being  a certified New\nJersey Trial Counsel and criminal defense attorney.  Finally, Ms. Lask was recently admitted to\nthe United States Supreme Court, an honor extended to counselors with impeccable records.\nTogether, Ms. Lask and Mr. Calabro have an excellent reputation without so much of a sanction\nin their records of some 20 years each of law practice, and their commitment to excellence and\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 7 of 12 PageID: 135\nethics in the Bar commits them  to obtain the best and most fair settlement for every class\nmember, and insure the Class receives justice and their appropriate damages.  In sum, the\ncollaboration of both law offices and their staff  and resources will adequately protect the class\ninterests during litigation and upon settlement and thereafter..\n53. The Plaintiff has no interests contrary to, or in conflict with, those of the class.\n54.  The Plaintiff knows of no difficulty that will be encountered in the management of this litigation\nthat would preclude its maintenance as a class action. The class action is superior to any other\navailable means to resolve the issues raised on behalf of the Class. The class action will be\nmanageable because so many different records systems exist from which to ascertain the\nmembers of the putative class. Damages can be determined on a classwide basis using a\ndamages matrix set by a jury, or by trying the damages of a statistically valid sample of the\nclass to a jury and extrapolating those damages to the class as a whole.\n55.  Class treatment will be superior because liability can be determined on a classwide basis.\nDamages can also be determined on a classwide basis through use of statistical sampling.\nFACTS REGARDING THE CLASS ACTION\n56. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 56.\n57. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, such as the\nDefendants in this action and the employees they supervise, from performing blanket strip\nsearches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes or\nviolations and/or detainees as holdovers on warrants from other jurisdictions unless there exists\na  reasonable  suspicion  to  believe  that  the  arrestee/detainee  is  concealing  a  weapon  or\ncontraband.  \n58. Nonetheless, Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of\nstrip searching all individuals who enter the custody of their Correctional Facilities regardless of\nthe nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe\nthat the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.\n59. Defendants have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of conducting\nvisual  body  cavity  searches  (visual  inspection  of  the  vaginal  and  rectal  cavities)  upon  all\npersons  entering  the  custody  of  the  Correctional  Facilities,  regardless  of  the  individual\ncharacteristics or the nature of their charged crime. For purposes of this Complaint, strip and\nvisual cavity searches are collectively referred to as \"strip searches.\"\n60.  Defendants know or should know, that they may not institute, enforce or permit enforcement of\na blanket policy or practice of conducting strip searches without particularized, reasonable\nsuspicion.\n61.   Defendants'  written  and/or  de  facto  policy,  practice  and  custom  mandating  blanket  strip\nsearches of all arrestees has been promulgated, effectuated and/or enforced in bad faith and\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 8 of 12 PageID: 136\ncontrary to clearly established law.\n62. Reasonable  suspicion  to  conduct  a  strip  search  may  only  emanate  from  the  particular\ncircumstances in advance to the search, being the nature of the crime charged, the particular\ncharacteristics of the arrestees, and/or the circumstances of the arrest.\n63. Defendants have promulgated, implemented, enforced, and/or failed to rectify a written and/or\nde facto policy, practice or custom of strip searching all individuals placed into their Correction\nFacilities without any requirement of reasonable suspicion, or any suspicion of any sort. This\nwritten and/or de facto policy made the strip searching of pretrial detainees routine; neither the\nnature of the offense charged, the characteristics of the arrestee, nor the circumstances of a\nparticular arrest were relevant to the enforcement of the policy, practice and custom of routine\nstrip searches.\n64. Pursuant to this written and/or de facto policy, each Class member, including Plaintiff, were  \nvictims of a blanket strip search upon their entry into Defendants’ Correctional Facilities. \n65.  As a direct and proximate result of the unlawful strip search conducted pursuant to this written\nand/or de facto policy, the victims of the unlawful strip searches are each Class member,\nincluding Plaintiff, whom  have suffered or will suffer psychological pain, humiliation, physical\npain and mental anguish.\n66.Defendants John Does’ 1-3 of Burlington County Jail and Essex County Correctional Facility\nperformed the illegal strip searches.\n67.  None of the officers involved in the searches of Plaintiff or any Class member bore any\nsuspicion, reasonable or otherwise, that Plaintiff or any Class member was concealing a\nweapon or contraband at the time of the searches, and indeed, no reasonable basis existed for\nsuch a suspicion, given the nature of the alleged offense\n68.  The strip/body cavity searches of Plaintiff  and the Class members were unconstitutional.\n69.  Defendants are liable for exemplary damages as the strip body searches were completely\nunreasonable and senseless under the law.\nCount Four: §1985(3) Discrimination\n70. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 69.\n71. Defendants John Does 4-5 of Defendant  Burlington County Jail conspired to violate Plaintiff\nAlbert’s statutory civil rights by acting in concert to deny his requests for 6 days access to the\nphone, access to the shower,  a kit that would have contained a tooth brush, towel and soap\nand permission to talk to a social worker.\n72.  Defendants denials were motivated by a racial discriminatory animus designed to deprive,   \ndirectly or indirectly, any Black person to the equal protection of the laws.\n73.   Plaintiff suffered injury of humiliation and other personal indignities to be the only Black\nprisoner among the white prisoners without any hygiene and the only Black prisoner refused\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 9 of 12 PageID: 137\nbasic needs of even a shower or a toothbrush for 6 days while the White prisoners were\nafforded those basic needs. \nCount Five: §1986 Discrimination\n74.Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 73.\n75. Defendants John Doe 4-5, Burlington County Jail and Juel Cole knowing that a violation of\nsection 1985(3) is about to be committed and possessing the power to prevent its occurrence,\nfailed to take action to frustrate its execution for the whole 6 days that the violation continued at\nthe Burlington County Jail.\nCount Six: Fourth Amendment Unreasonable Detention\n76. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 75.\n77. Defendant Burlington County Jail did not promptly bring Plaintiff to a Magistrate but instead\nunreasonably incarcerated him for 7 days.\n78.  Rule R.3:41(c) of the New Jersey Rules Governing Criminal Practice  mandates that the\narresting officer  in charge of the police station where the arrestee is taken shall promptly\ncomplete his post arrest documentation and \"release that person in lieu of continued detention.\"\n to the nearest magistrate for a probable cause hearing.\n79. Despite even State law requiring a prompt hearing, Plaintiff’s constitutional rights of being\ndetained for an unreasonable time were violated as a result of being imprisoned some 7 days\nwhile Defendants ignored Plaintiff’s protests that a warrant for his arrest did not exist.\nCount Five: §1983 Municipality Custom Violations\n80. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 79.\n81. Defendants Burlington County Jail, Burlington County Board of Chosen Freeholders, Essex\nCounty Correctional Facility and Essex County Sheriff‘s Department and Warden Juel Cole\nmaintained a municipal policy or custom of  detaining persons without promptly verifying if a\nproper  warrant for arrest existed nor promptly doing anything to insure a person’s liberty is not\nimpeded by being falsely arrested.\n82. Those  practices of the Defendants, who are government entities, are so permanent and well\nsettled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law. \n83. Defendants  are liable under  respondeat superior liability under § 1983 as their custom or\nusage  supports conduct violative of Plaintiff’s' federal constitutional rights,\n84. Defendants had  contemporaneous knowledge of the offending incident or knowledge of a prior\npattern of similar incidents and circumstances.\n85. Defendants failed to train, discipline or control its personnel and that is a  basis for §1983\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 10 of 12 PageID: 138\nrespondeat superior liability.\n86. Defendants actions or inactions communicates a message of approval to the offending\nsubordinate Defendants John Does 1-8.  \n87.By reason of Defendants practices related herein, Plaintiff was injured in body and mind, was\nprevented from following his customary pursuit in his usual occupation, has suffered greatly in\nhis credit and reputation, and has expended large sums of money in his defense.\n88. Defendants  failure  to  provide  adequate  training  and  supervision  to  its  police  officers  and\nemployees constitutes a willful and wanton indifference and deliberate disregard for human life\nand the rights of private citizens, including Plaintiff.  Plaintiff is thus entitled to exemplary\ndamages.\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n89. Plaintiff incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 through 97.\n90.   Plaintiff and the Class members request that this Court issue a declaratory judgment, and that\nit declare the strip search policies of the Defendants to be unconstitutional.\nDamages\n91.  As a direct and proximate result of the actions on the part of the Defendants, Plaintiff Albert  \nlost one week from work and lost a salary of about $4,900.00 in commissions, lost his freedom\nfor 7 days, missed his mother’s birthday on March 9, 2005 during the imprisonment, feared his\nwife would lose their baby because she had a premature birth before, during his imprisonment\nPlaintiff cried everyday, was terrified, could not eat or drink, did not sleep, was dizzy, nauseous,\nwas in unsanitary conditions in the cell with the toilet being near his head where he slept, the\nfood was cold and disgusting, suffered headaches, stomachaches, felt he was losing his mind\nwhile everyone ignored the fact that there was no warrant against him, was literally humiliated\nby the strip and cavity searches and more,  feared losing his job, his home and his baby,\nPlaintiff presently has anxiety and fears every time he sees a police officer that he will get\narrested again, sleeplessness, replays the whole event over and over in his mind.\n92. Defendants failure to provide adequate training and supervision to its police officers and\nemployees constitutes a willful and wanton indifference and deliberate disregard for human life\nand the rights of private citizens, including Plaintiff and all Class members.  Plaintiff and the\nClass members are thus entitled to exemplary damages.\nDEMAND FOR TRIAL BY JURY\n93. The Plaintiffs hereby demand a trial by jury.\n WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Albert Florence, on behalf of himself and the Class of others similarly\n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-JHR-JS   Document 24   Filed 06/30/06   Page 11 of 12 PageID: 139\nsituated, request that this Honorable Court grant  the following relief:\n   A.

Florence,  \n      Plaintiff,                                               BRIEF  \n-against-                 SUPPORTING OPPOSITION \n\t\r  \nBoard of Chosen Freeholders of the County of  \nBurlington; et. al. \nDefendants. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nI.  Introduction \n \nSusan Chana Lask, Esq., with her significant experience in civil rights  cases, agreed to \nrepresent Albert Florence pursuant to the Retainer Agreement. Based upon Florence’s \npromises in a 2005 Retainer Agreement and an amendment thereto dated September 22, 2012, \nMs. Lask devoted substantial time, money, and expertise investigating  and litigating this \ncomplex  and highly contested  case against two county defendants.  Ms. Lask performed this \nwork zealously for over 8 years, including Circuit and United States Supreme Court appeals \nwithout receiving any payment, and with the risk that she would collect nothing unless there was \na recovery in the case.  As a result of her work on  Florence's  behalf,  she obtained a \n$105,000.00 settlement which was to pay her legal fees as agreed by Florence and some $20,000 to \nFlorence for his 7 days in jail.  Research showed the highest similar verdicts and settlements at no more \nthan $1,000 per day and from that attorney fees were taken; meaning, Florence agreeing to some $17-\n20,000 was more than double of what was customary, and more than the zero recovery he could have \nreceived. \nOnly  now  after  the  case  has  been settled  and dismissed with Florence’s consent, \nFlorence complains to a Federal Court by a procedurally improper post termination motion for  \n“Production of Documents” complaining that the Retainer Agreement is unenforceable and that \nthere is a fee dispute, using fictions created by William Ribak, Esq. whose real interest is his present \nHaas case in conflict to Florence, which he fears may fail because of the Florence settlement.  \nThe 2005 Retainer1 excluded legal services for a trial or appeal, specifically stating “1. \n…This retainer shall not cover a trail (sic) or appeal of any issues herein and is limited to all work \nup and until a trial., to which if a trial is required then we shall enter into a new retainer to cover \ntrial expenses.” It also specifically stated a new agreement would be made with respect to legal \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n1\t\r  The\t\r  Retainer\t\r  is\t\r  attached\t\r  as\t\r  an\t\r  exhibit\t\r  to\t\r  Florence’s\t\r  Certification.\t\r  \n1\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 5 of 15 PageID: 3243\nservices beyond the scope of the retainer and that fees may be increased pursuant to NJ R. 1:21-7(f) \nThe  Retainer  Agreement is  an  enforceable contract,  and  Ms. Lask’s  compensation  as \nexpressly set  forth in the 2005 Retainer Agreement as amended by the 2012 agreement  is \nreasonable,  appropriate, and satisfies the standard of Rule 1.5.  \nII. Law and Argument \nA. The Discovery Motion is Procedurally Improper  \n \n  The proper filing would have been an \"Application for Emergent Relief to Reopen Pursuant \nto L. Civ. R. 41.1(b) and for the Court's Determination of Reasonableness of Attorney's Fee \nPursuant to L. Civ. R. 103.1(a)\" (the \"Application\").   Florence declined to make the procedurally \nproper application.  His present motion is improper and all orders related thereto are void ab initio. \n \nB.  The Magistrate and this Court Do not Have Jurisdiction to Hear  \na Post Termination Discovery “Motion for Production of Documents”.   \n \n        i.  Magistrate Schneider has No Authority over the Present Motion \n \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), a United States Magistrate Judge may “hear and \ndetermine any [non-dispositive] pretrial matter pending before the court[.]” 28 U.S.C. \n§636(b)(1)(A).   On March 28, 2013, this case and all causes of action asserted in this matter have \nbeen settled, resolved and terminated by order of this Court.  Accordingly, the case is not in a “pre-\ntrial” stage nor is the present “Motion for Production of Documents” a pre-trial non-dispositive \nmotion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A).  Magistrate Schneider does not have authority over \nFlorence’s present “Motion for Production of Documents”.   All orders related thereto after the \ntermination order, including permitting William Ribak to appear on this docket for a post \ntermination dispute, are void ab initio. This post termination dispute should be removed from the \ndocket in its entirety. \n      ii. Ancillary Jurisdiction of The Court Does Not Exist.  \n           The “Motion” Is Not Related to a Settlement \n \n  This Court does not have ancillary jurisdiction to hear a discovery “Motion for Production \nof Documents”.   It is axiomatic that \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\" Kokkonen \nv. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 128 L. Ed. 2d 391 (1994).  Federal \ncourts obtain their jurisdictional power from explicit grants by Congress, and from Art. III of the \nU.S. Constitution. See U.S. Const. art. III; Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 701-02, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1982). The Florence case was a \ncivil rights case brought under Federal statute that this Court’s March 28, 2013 order terminated \n2\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 6 of 15 PageID: 3244\nbased upon a full and final settlement.  The claims over which this Court had original jurisdiction \n(i.e. the federal 1983 claims) were resolved and dismissed. The existing precedent is \"the rule \nwithin this Circuit is that once all claims with an independent basis of federal jurisdiction have been \ndismissed, the case no longer belongs in federal court.\" Markowitz v. Northeast Land Co., 906 F.2d \n100, 106 (3d Cir. 1990);Lovell Mfg. Corp. v. Export-Import Bank of the United States, 843 F.2d \n725, 734 (3d Cir. 1988).  There are no federal issues outstanding that gives this court jurisdiction to \nhear Florence’s discovery motion. There is no Federal statute providing for jurisdiction over fee \ndisputes.   \n   Florence’s “motion” demands that this Federal Court resurrect a settled and closed civil \nrights case because he thinks he may have a private dispute regarding a fee agreement, but he is not \nsure so he requests documents via his discovery motion? Florence’s filing is suspect.  Is there a fee \ndispute or did attorney Ribak once again interfere with the Florence case to use Florence like \nTammy Haas complained he did to her to satisfy Ribak’s personal agenda to change the Florence \nsettlement to protect his monetary interests for legal fees from the Haas case by removing the \nFlorence settlement as precedent (7/19/13 Lask, Calabro and Brady Certs.)?   \nNotwithstanding Florence’s and Ribak’s suspect motives, the Third Circuit holds that \nancillary jurisdiction over attorney-client fee disputes is permitted only if the dispute \"bear[s] \ndirectly upon the ability of the court to dispose of cases before it in a fair matter.\" Novinger v. \nLesonal-Werke, 809 F.2d 212, 217 (3d Cir. 1987).   In Novinger, the fee dispute issues occurred \nbefore the case was conclusively resolved and the clients wanted to substitute new counsel before \nsettlement.  To close and settle that case and as part of the court’s ability to manage and resolve \ncases before it, the court intervened to temporarily lift a former attorney’s lien on the file \ndocuments to settle the case.  Here the circumstances are completely different than Novinger.  \nThere is not an active calendar before this court that it needs to manage.  It was after the case was \nsettled and closed that Florence disrupts the Federal court for what might be his private fee dispute.   \nConsistent with Novinger that there is no jurisdiction over fee disputes is Knoepfler v. The \nGuardian Life Insurance Co. of America, et al., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75918 (DNJ 2010).  In \nKnoepfler the court refused to hear a contingency fee dispute between the attorney and client after \nthe case settled.  Knoepfler held Federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over fee disputes and \nthat post settlement issues are for the State court. In sum, post settlement fee disputes would \ndirectly contravene the Third Circuit's rationale in Novinger to permit ancillary jurisdiction when \nthe incidental dispute arose (or was at least noticed) while the underlying action was pending.   \n  Consistent with the rationales of Novinger and Knoepfler is the April 22, 2013 case of \nUnited States of America et al v. The Cooper Health System, et. al, 2013 U.S. Dist. Lexis 56809 \n3\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 7 of 15 PageID: 3245\n(DNJ, 4/22/13).  The Cooper court resolved a contingency fee dispute in a qui tam involving a \nsettlement of over twelve million dollars.  Specifically, that Settlement Agreement stated that the \ndefendant \"Cooper agrees to pay Relator's Counsel, and Relator's Counsel agree to accept as full \npayment $430,000 for expenses, and attorney's fees and costs in accordance with subsection \n3730(d)(1).\" Id.  Those attorney fees were based upon fee application submissions by plaintiff’s \ncounsel. Later the plaintiff complained that his counsel did not deserve the fees he agreed to in a \nretainer.  Not only did the court deny that plaintiff’s attempt to void his contingency retainer \nagreement but it was very specific that the only reason it heard the fee issue was because fees were \nintrinsically intertwined with the Settlement Agreement, to wit: \n \n “To the extent that Dr. DePace's Application specifically asserts that the Settlement Agreement  \n  supersedes the Contingency Fee Agreement, this Court has jurisdiction to reopen the case. The  \n  Court's Order of January 24, 2013, which dismissed the case, stated explicitly that this Court   \n\"shall retain jurisdiction over any disputes that may arise regarding compliance with the Settlement \nAgreement.\" (Order, January 24, 2013). Whether the terms of the Settlement Agreement obviate Dr. \nDePace's obligation to comply with the Contingency Fee Agreement is clearly a dispute \n\"regarding compliance with the Settlement Agreement.\"(emphasis added) Id, at 9. \n \nMoreover, the Cooper fee issue was requested correctly by a motion as an \"Application for \nEmergent Relief to Reopen Pursuant to L. Civ. R. 41.1(b) and for the Court's Determination of \nReasonableness of Attorney's Fee Pursuant to L. Civ. R. 103.1(a)\" (the \"Application\").  Here not \nonly did Florence decline to file the appropriate motion for relief and instead opted for some sort of \ndiscovery motion that does not give this court jurisdiction, but he also has no Settlement Agreement \nto bootstrap his discovery motion to.  The settlement was a simple general release for a sum certain \nto each defendant that did not specify the court retains jurisdiction nor did it have anything to do \nwith Florence’s legal fees to Ms. Lask.  That issue was between Florence and his counsel. \n  Even if Florence raised a settlement issue, which he does not, still this court does not have \njurisdiction post settlement. The Brass Smith, LLC v. RPI Industries, Inc., 827 F. Supp. 2d 377 \n(DNJ 2011) court refused ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement that had no \nlimitations with respect to how long the court should maintain such jurisdiction and only if it is \nexplicitly stated in a dismissal order with a limit of time. The concern was at some point the court’s \njurisdiction must end, not be limitless at the whim of the parties.  Brass found “As the above \ndiscussion of the law demonstrates, no rule or statute confers such endless jurisdiction upon a \nfederal court in a private dispute lacking substantial public interest.” at 13.  Footnote 2 of Brass \nmakes clear that Federal Courts typically retain jurisdiction over settlement agreements only when a \nsubstantial Federal Interest was involved, such as a charge of racial discrimination before the EEOC \n(Holland), compliance with the federal Clean Air Act (Delaware Valley), alleged violations of \n4\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 8 of 15 PageID: 3246\nFourteenth Amendment equal protection (Jordan), and a Sherman Anti-Trust Act violation (Swift).  \nIn the case at bar, the order of dismissal did not explicitly retain jurisdiction over the settlement, no \nless a fee dispute. \n  As well, there is no settlement dispute because Ms. Lask was expressly authorized by \nFlorence to settle Burlington and Essex, which she did wholly under the supervision of this Court \nthat assisted with the terms of the releases.  Florence tries to deny the Burlington settlement by \nmaterially misrepresenting that money was kept from him or not deposited in an IOLTA account \nbut his misrepresentations fail by the e-mails in his exhibits as well as Ms. Lask’s exhibits proving \nfor about five months before that settlement he directed Ms. Lask to settle and he executed not one \nbut two releases five months later; one which directed the entire settlement to be paid to Ms. Lask \n(7/19/13 Lask cert, Exh. D).  That was consistent with his agreement, solidified in his September \n22, 2012 e-mail (7/19/13 Lask Cert, Exh. C) to pay her something for her 8 years of legal services \nto the US Supreme Court, and her continued  post appellate work-all of which were excluded by the \noriginal 2005 retainer.  He provides no law denying that settlement because the law in fact supports \nthe settlement considering his e-mails and releases indisputably confirm settlement.  (\"An attorney \nmay settle a lawsuit on behalf of a client if the attorney has either actual authority (express or \nimplied) or apparent authority.\") (citing Newark Branch, NAACP v. Township of West Orange, N.J., \n786 F.Supp. 408, 423 (D.N.J. 1992). \n \n     C.  Florence’s Accusation of Settling Under “Threats” is a Material Misrepresentation \n \n  Florence’s certification to this court that Ms. Lask threatened him so he settled, or \nsomething to that effect, is unclear what he is trying to undo; however, there were no threats. He \nconveniently fails to specify how he as a 6’2” sophisticated businessman managing high-end car \ncontracts and making over $200,000 a year while living in a luxury home and driving luxury \nautomobiles who was imprisoned twice was threatened by the 5’4” female Susan Chana Lask who \nwas his counsel for over 8 years in this Court, the Circuit Court and the US Supreme Court.  He \nomits the fact that he was vocal enough to scream at Ms. Lask that she should tell Magistrate \nSchneider off if this did not settle (7/19/13 Lask Cert.).   In Cintron v. State of NJ, Civil No. 10-195, \nMagistrate Schneider’s undated decision to document 19 in that case docket denied a similar claim \nof duress and found that: \n \n “For a court to find duress, however, the plaintiff must suffer “a degree of constraint or  \n   danger, either actually inflicted or threatened and impending, sufficient in severity or in     \n   apprehension to overcome the mind or will of a person of ordinary firmness.” Rubenstein,  \n   20 N.J. at 365; Smith, 343 N.J. at 499. Where a party claims to have suffered duress in the  \n5\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 9 of 15 PageID: 3247\n   form of moral compulsion or psychological pressure, the pressure must be “so oppressive  \n   under given circumstances as to constrain one to do what his free will would  refuse.”  \n  20 N.J. at 367; 343 N.J. at 499.” \n \nMoreso, Florence never expressed reservations about the settlements.  His e-mails show he was \ninformed about the amounts and he agreed to them. He also does not dispute that he agreed to the \nsettlements which were simple releases for a sum certain from each defendant. Instead, he claims he \nwas “threatened” but does not explain what gun was held to his head that put him in such danger \nthat he had no free will but to agree to settling.   \nMagistrate Schneider held in Cintron that “Plaintiff presents no evidence of any wrongful \nact or threat. This appears to be a case of “buyers remorse.”  However, the fact that plaintiff now \nhas second thoughts or regrets about the settlement does not invalidate the agreement she signed. \nPlaintiff’s second thoughts are entitled to no weight as against the strong public policy in favor of \nsettlements. Jennings, 381 N.J. Super. at 232.”  The same holds true in the case at bar. Particularly \nthe fact that the 6’2” man Florence in no way was threatened by 5’4” female Ms. Lask who was his \ncounsel for over 8 years right to the US Supreme Court and she explained the settlement terms to \nhim for months before the case settled and closed with his consent (7/19/13 Lask Cert.). \n \nD.  The September 22, 2012 Fee Agreement Between Ms. Lask and Florence is Valid \n \n  Pursuant to RPC 1.2(c) the 2005 retainer with the consent of Florence limited the attorney \nservices to pre-trial work, and specifically excluded a trial or appeal.  The Third Circuit holds that \nthe relationship between an attorney and client is contractual. Kant v. Seton Hall University, 422 \nFed.Appx. 186 (3rd Cir, 2011).  District Courts use New Jersey state contract law to resolve contract \nissues.  Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Hayes–Green, No. 07–cv–2492 (WJM), 2008 WL 2119976, at *1 \n(D.N.J. May 20, 2008), Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938) \n(federal diversity cases use state contract laws unless a federal interest is involved).  The 2005 \nretainer and September 22, 2012 e-mail agreement2 to amend it were contractually and ethically \nvalid. \n  This Circuit holds that if “the assumptions underlying the original retainer agreement had \nbeen materially altered” by unforeseeable developments then the retainer fee can change \naccordingly. Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 F.3d 190 (3rd Cir., 2000). The 2005 retainer \ndid not assume multiple summary judgment motions before and after the multiple appeals in this \ncase that Ms. Lask continued to represent Florence in.

Florence and Ms. Lask negotiated the 2005 retainer wherein the 2012 \namendment unequivocally incorporates it by reference.  As well, the September 22, 2012 agreement \nmay stand on its own.  Either way, it was fair and reasonable agreement to compensate her \nsomewhat for her 8 years of continued representation and services up to the United states supreme \nCourt and back for Florence which were not assumed by the 2005 retainer, and he was not about to \npay her for her services.   \nA writing must be given a reasonable construction, in accordance with justice and common \nsense. GNOC, Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, 328 N.J.Super. 467, 477, 746 A.2d 466 \n(App.Div.2000) (quotations omitted), aff'd as modified on other grounds, 167 N.J. 62, 768 A.2d \n1051 (2001). Common sense dictates the 2012 agreement was fair after 8 years of appeals and post-\nappellate work provided for Florence’s benefit without any fees paid by him. \nThe 2012 renegotiated retainer agreement was consistent with RPC 1.5(c), to wit: \n“A contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which \n       the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue \n       to the lawyer in the event of settlement... and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery,  \n      and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated.”   \n \nIt was also consistent with RPC 1.5 as a reasonable fee as after 8 years to the United States Supreme \nCourt and past that decision when the case was virtually over, Ms. Lask continued representation \npost appeal and to settlement based on Florence’s promise to pay her $45,000 of the Burlington \nsettlement and 60% of whatever Essex settled for.  Ms. Lask obtained $60,000 from Essex which \nwithout considering disbursements for the past years estimated at $4,000, the basic calculation is \n60,000 x 60%= $36,000 from $60,000= $24,000 gross to Florence. Therefrom would be an \nestimated $4-6,000.00 in disbursements due, leaving Florence with what he and Ms. Lask agreed \nwould be anywhere from $17-20,000 he would pocket. Thus, the motion before this court is all \nabout disbursements of some $4,000 that Florence prevented Ms. Lask from finally accounting \nbecause he refused to sign the Essex voucher to obtain the check.  \n     E.  Florence Complains of His Own Unclean Hands that Prevented Essex from \n  Disbursing the Settlement He Agreed to and Prevented Ms. Lask to Do a  \n  Final Accounting \n \nPursuant to RPC 1.5(c)  “Upon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall \nprovide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a \nrecovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.”  RPC 1.5(c) \ndoes not mandate an accounting before the settlement is received and distributed to the client.  In \n7\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 11 of 15 PageID: 3249\nfact, it states the accounting is done simultaneous to remitting the client’s portion clearly so a final \naccounting can be done to account for all disbursements to the very end.  The closing statement is \ncustomarily sent once settlement is received and disbursed to the client. The March, 2013 e-mails \nshow Florence authorized a $60,000 settlement (7/19/13 Lask Cert.), then he never appeared to sign \nEssex’ voucher despite numerous requests so settlement could be disbursed per RPC 1.5 .  Once \ndisbursed with a closing statement then he could make his fee dispute if it exists, but he will not \neven let that occur.   \n \n  F.  Florence Used Ms. Lask to Continue Representing Him Without Being Paid and  \n    Settle Based on His Promises to Pay Her, Then Once She Obtained an  \n    Extraordinary Settlement for Him He Retained Adversary Counsel Ribak to File  \n                False Claims Against Ms. Lask So He Can Renege on His Promises \n \n    The only person that benefitted in this case was Florence. HE received the benefit of legal \nservices for 8 years, including representation in the United states supreme Court, and a more than \nsuccessful settlement post appellate work. First, 8 years of legal services in this highly contentious \ncase to the United States Supreme Court does not justify a $81,000 in legal fees ($45,000 \nBurlington fee and 60% from Essex).  The Circuit and US Supreme Court case alone is hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in hours.  This District Court case of 8 years alone is millions of dollars in \nhours. That is justified by the fact that Florence’s present counsel takes millions of dollars in legal \nfees he settles in a matter of a few years of work without appeals.  Next, Ms. Lask’s research of \nNew Jersey and statewide verdicts and settlements proved these cases average at best $1,000 per \nday of incarceration, and from that attorney fees are taken.   \n    Some of the cases revealed in the settlement research are Frankie Crane 2010 DNJ  Settled \nat $300,000 less  75,000 attorney fees divided among SIX plaintiffs falsely arrested and falsely \ncharged with an illegal search of their property; Kerry Edwards  2008 DNJ  Settled at $327,000 \nFOR 30 days in Jail sued for false arrest; Esmat Zaklama  2007 DNJ  claimed false arrest on a false \nwarrant –0- award—Judge dismissed on SJ; James Quinn  2012 CA Dist Ct in jail 2.5 days and \nsuffered atrial heart problems because they refused his medications. The plaintiff attorney \ndemanded $300,000 attorney fees and received $425,000 total award which attorney fees were to be \ndeducted and the difference there that there was no probable cause to arrest where here there was, \nalso there was serious personal injury suffered where here Florence testified he had no personal \ninjury, not even so much as seeing his general practitioner.   As well, Florence could have received \nzero if the jury heard his underlying circumstances which a recent Camden jury gave zero. Thus, \nFlorence’s 7 days in jail at best was worth $7,000-he was receiving more than twice that without \ndeducting attorney fees as he agreed they would be paid from Ms. Lask’s settlement efforts.  \n8\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 12 of 15 PageID: 3250\n \n    G.  Florence’s Counsel Ribak is Clearly in Conflict With Florence’s Best Interests as  \n          His Filings are Not Only Patently False but He is Arguing Against Florence by  \n          Compelling Quantum Meruitt which Would Defeat Any Remittance to Florence  \n          That Ms. Lask More Than Fairly Provided for Him \n \n    If Florence wants to deny his 2012 fee agreement where he receives a substantial settlement \nbetter than any other without losing legal fees therefrom as they were negotiated by Ms. Lask above \nFlorence’s settlement, and after Ms. Lask worked pursuant to Florence’s promises that she would \nget fees from the settlement she negotiated, then lets proceed to paying Ms. Lask in quantum \nmeruitt per the lodestar method.  That way she can calculate her 8 years of service or even her past \nyears worth of legal services and multiply that by her hourly rate. That would encompass the entire \nBurlington and Essex settlements to be paid to her. \n  Thus, if this court placates Florence’s positions then it would have to permit Ms. Lask to file \na motion for counsel fees and costs so the trial court can consider to determine the 'lodestar'--that is, \nthe  number  of  hours  reasonably  expended  multiplied  by  a  reasonable  hourly  rate--and  then \ndetermine whether any adjustments to the product are required. R.M. v. Supreme Court of N.J., 190 \nN.J. 1, 4, 918 A.2d 7 (2007).  This Court would have to permit her to file pursuant to Rule 4:42-9(b) \nher affidavit of services addressing the factors enumerated by R.P.C. 1.5(a). Twp. of W. Orange v. \n769 Assocs., LLC, 198 N.J. 529, 542, 969 A.2d 1080 (2009).  Ms. Lask would submit that she was \ncounsel throughout the 8 years of litigation, familiar with the case and personally reviewed all \ninvoices showing the amount of hours worked and rate billed.  R.P.C. 1.5(a), in turn, prescribes that \n\"[a] lawyer's fee shall be reasonable.\" Among the factors to be considered in determining the \nreasonableness of a fee are the following: \n  \n   (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, \nand the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; \n(2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the particular \nemployment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; \n(3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; \n(4) the amount involved and the results obtained; \n(5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; \n [**20] (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; \n(7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the \nservices; \n(8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent. [R.P.C. 1.5(a)(1)-(8).] \n \n9\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 13 of 15 PageID: 3251\nThe list is not exhaustive and all factors will not be relevant in every case. Twp. of W. Orange, \nsupra, 198 N.J. at 542, 969 A.2d 1080.  \nThe point here is that the extraordinary amount of work to present 8 years of hours and other \nsubmissions for services rendered in this court, the Circuit Court and the United States Supreme \nCourt would take 8 months to organize.  To avoid such an extraordinary task which would add \ninsult to injury in this over exhausted case is exactly why it was settled as it was by Ms. Lask \nreviewing with Florence statewide and nationwide settlements and then coming to an educated \nagreement with Florence regarding the value of the case and how to obtain some semblance of legal \nfees for Ms. Lask’s services.  \n \nG.  Florence Fictionalized an IOLTA Issue to Interfere With This Court’s Impartiality  \n       So It Would Reopen the Case on a Baseless and Procedurally Improper Motion \n \n  Only funds belonging to a client must be deposited into a trust account, which would be \nan IOLTA in New Jersey.  Restatement  (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyer§ 44, cmt. d \n(2000) (\"A lawyer must deposit funds of a client or a third person in an account, usually a \ntrust or client account, separate from the lawyer's own funds”). Florence falsely claims the \nBurlington settlement should have been deposited in an IOLTA by now mashing up the facts to \nmislead this court. The e-mails attached to his filing and Ms. Lask’s certification prove he \nagreed that was her money, and the balance of the settlement from Essex was to be a \ncontingency split, not the Burlington settlement.  He actually appeared before her bank branch \nmanager to sign the check and deliver it to Ms. Lask so she could be paid per his agreement \nwith her.  He confirms he knew there was no need for an IOLTA as the email chain he provides \nstates exactly to Burlington’s counsel Brooks DiDonato that Ms. Lask was not using an IOLTA \nbecause the funds were her legal fees per her agreement with Florence.     \n \n  H. This Court Should Sua Sponte Sanction Ribak and Florence \n \n  This court may not have jurisdiction over Florence’s discovery motion but it does retain the\t\r  \n“inherent power to protect (its) integrity and prevent abuse of the judicial process.” Perna v. \nElectronic Data Systems Corp., 916 F. Supp. 385 (D.N.J. 1995).\t\r  Ribak and Florence should be \nsanctioned for their material misrepresentations of fact and law and held accountable for all legal \nfees and expenses incurred to oppose their baseless motion.  The pursuit of claims using fraudulent \ndocuments mocks and threatens our system of justice, undermines confidence in our courts, and \nunnecessarily expends public funds. Monies are spent for not just attorneys' fees but jurors, judges, \njudicial staff, and public facilities.  Despite the case law and procedure, Florence with counsel \n10\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 14 of 15 PageID: 3252\nRibak urges this court to waste judicial resources and numerous counsel to waste their valuable time \nwith a procedurally improper and unsupported motion for what may be a fee issue or to overturn a \nsettlement; nonetheless, completely devoid of logic, facts or law to support him.   \n  Ribak drafted and filed Florence’s certification and what he entitled a “Memorandum of \nLaw” that both are conclusory and wholly unsupported of any law.  Of the many material \nmisrepresentations, Ribak falsely attributes facts to Michael Calabro, Esq. that never occurred to \nraise this court’s suspicion against Ms. Lask (7/19/13 Calabro Cert.).  That alone is a fraud and \ndeserves sanctions by this court.  A fraud on the court occurs \"where it can be demonstrated, clearly \nand convincingly, that a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated \nto interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly \ninfluencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party's claim or \ndefense.\" Ibid. (quoting Aoude v. Mobil Oil Corp., 892 F.2d 1115, 1118 (1st Cir.1989); Perna v. \nElec. Data Sys. Corp., 916 F. Supp. 388, 397 (D.N.J.1995)).    \n  Ribak continues the fraud with one material misrepresentation after another as if the RPCs \nwere violated which they were not, or Florence was “threatened” without specifying the threat and \nomitting the law that does contravenes everything Ribak and Florence claim.   He goes as far as to \nfalsify facts and have Florence certify to false facts and falsely accuses Ms. Lask of not depositing \nmoney in an IOLTA account which he falsely made that accusation to get this court’s attention to \nhear his baseless “motion”; and it worked. It in fact interfered with this court’s ability to impartially \nhandle this case as it was deliberately misinformed of one fiction after another with RPCs and \naccusations of theft thrown into the mix causing Magistrate Schneider to re-open the case, allow \nRibak on the docket and this Court to re-manage this case under the guise of a baseless motion \nwhile Defendant Essex was also caused to file a motion. All of which was unnecessary, other than \neveryone heard that money was missing and Mr. Calabro was deceived by Ms. Lask, which is false.   \nRibak, an attorney, also deliberately omits the fact that by law an IOLTA is not required.   \n  As if everything else was not deliberate enough, the fact that the “motion” is filed by Ribak \nwho is associated with Poplar is truly deceptive.  Poplar has made a new unsuccessful career of \nfalsely accusing plaintiffs’ counsel of ethics violations and other things in an attempt to overturn \nvalid settlements despite clear law (Cooper, Id.- including at 23-24-this court noted there that \nPoplar argued similar fee issues without any substantiation or supporting law, and in contravention \nto existing clear law).  This duplicate misconduct of filing baseless motions must be stopped here as \nit is bad enough once, but twice without informing this court of clear law is sanctionable.  More \ndisturbing is Florence as a sophisticated businessman who knows the truth, yet he allowed Ribak to \nfile false submissions and he certified to it under penalty of perjury. \n11\t\r  \n\t\r  \n\nCase 1:05-cv-03619-RBK-JS   Document 266   Filed 07/22/13   Page 15 of 15 PageID: 3253\n \nIII.

FLORENCE, Plaintiff, \nv. \nBOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF the COUNTY OF BURLINGTON, \net al., Defendants. \nCivil Action No. 05-3619. \nUnited States District Court, D. New Jersey. \nFebruary 4, 2009. \n495*495 Susan Chana Lask, Esq., New York, NY, for Plaintiffs. \nJ. Brooks DiDonato, Esq., Parker McCay, Marlton, NJ, for Defendant Burlington. \nAlan R. Ruddy, Esq., Office of the Essex County Counsel, Newark, NJ, for Defendant \nEssex. \nOPINION \nRODRIGUEZ, Senior District Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment filed by \nAlbert W. Florence (\"Florence\" or \"Plaintiff\") and Defendants. Plaintiff represents a class \ncertified by this Court as: \nAll arrestees charged with non-indictable offenses who were processed, housed or \nheld-over at Defendant Burlington County Jail and/or Essex County Correctional Facility \nfrom March 3, 2003 to the present date who were directed by Defendants' officers to \nstrip naked before those officers, no matter if the officers term that procedure a \"visual \nobservation\" or otherwise, without the officers first articulating a reasonable belief that \nthose arrestees were concealing contraband, drugs or weapons. \nDefendants named in the complaint are Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of \nBurlington, Burlington County Jail (\"Burlington Jail\"), Warden Juel Cole, Individually and \nOfficially as Warden of Burlington County Jail, Essex County Correctional Facility \n(\"Essex Jail\"), Essex County Sheriff's Department and several John Does. \nPlaintiffs seek: \n1. Summary judgment on the issue of law regarding whether Defendants violated \nPlaintiffs' constitutional rights by their policy of strip searching non-indictable 496*496 \narrestees without reasonable suspicion; \n\n2. Preliminary injunctive relief on behalf of the class against Defendants Burlington and \nEssex Counties' strip search policies. \nDefendants seek: \n1. Summary Judgment on the issue of law regarding whether the strip searches were \nconstitutional; \n2. Eleventh Amendment immunity for the Board of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington \nCounty, Warden Juel Cole in his official capacity, and Burlington County Jail; \n3. Qualified Immunity for Warden Juel Cole in his individual capacity; \n4. Dismissal of Count Five § 1983 Municipality Custom Violations regarding Essex \nCounty.[1] \nFor the reasons expressed below, Plaintiffs' motions are granted in part and denied in \npart. Defendants' cross-motions for summary judgment are denied, and the claims for \nEleventh Amendment immunity and qualified immunity are also denied. Defendant's \nclaim to dismiss the § 1983 Municipality Custom Violations Count is denied. \nI. JURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 over Plaintiffs' 42 U.S.C. § \n1983 claim for violation of their federal constitutional rights. \nII. FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nA. Facts Relating to Plaintiff's Arrest, Detention, and \nAlleged Strip Searches \nThe parties are familiar with the facts of this case. For purposes of summary judgment, \nhowever, the facts shall be provided herein, in large measure undisturbed from this \nCourt's previous opinion certifying the class. See Florence v. Bd. of Chosen \nFreeholders, 2008 WL 800970, *1-*5 (D.N.J. March 20, 2008). \nOn March 3, 2005, Florence was a passenger in his sport utility vehicle, which was \nbeing driven by his wife on Interstate Highway 295 in Burlington County. (See Pl.'s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts at ¶ 1.) The vehicle was stopped by a New \nJersey State Trooper, who directed Florence to exit the vehicle. (Id. at ¶ 2.) Florence \nwas arrested based on an Essex County bench warrant that was issued on April 25, \n2003. (Id.) Florence contends that the warrant charged him with a form of civil contempt \nthat is a non-indictable offense. (Id. at ¶ 3.) In fact, the warrant related to a fine which \nFlorence had already paid. (Id.) Despite Florence's protests about the warrant's validity, \nhe was taken by the State Trooper to the Burlington Jail. (Id. at ¶ 3.) \nAt the jail, Florence was subjected to what he alleges was a full strip and body cavity \nsearch.[2] (Id. at ¶ 3.) According to his deposition testimony, an officer directed him to \n\nremove all his clothing and, while nude, open his mouth, lift his tongue, 497*497 hold \nhis arms out, turn fully around, and lift his genitals. (Id.) Florence complied with these \nrequests while the officer sat approximately one arm's length in front of him. (Id. at ¶ 4.) \nThe officer then instructed Florence to shower. (Id.) In the end, Florence was held at the \nBurlington Jail for six days. (Id.) \nAfter the sixth day, the Essex County Sheriff's Department collected Florence and \ntransported him to the Essex Jail. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Upon his arrival, Florence was processed \nand again subjected to what he alleges was a full strip and body cavity search. (Id.) \nAccording to Florence's deposition testimony, Essex Jail officers told him and four other \narrestees to enter separate shower stalls, strip all their clothing and shower. (Id. at ¶ 6.) \nFlorence and the other arrestees complied by completely removing their clothes while \ntwo officers watched. (Id.) Florence then showered, and was directed to open his mouth \nand lift his genitals. (Id.) Next, he was ordered to turn around so that he faced away \nfrom the officers, after which time he was told to squat and cough, and then turn back \naround to face front. (Id. at ¶ 7) Following this episode, Florence was placed with the \ngeneral jail population until the next day when the charges against him were dismissed. \n(Id.) \nB. Evidence in the Record \nThe following subsections detail the intake procedures at Burlington and Essex, \nrespectively. Although the parties are familiar with this evidence, see Florence, supra, at \n*1-*5, the Court reincorporates the pertinent details as they relate directly to the instant \ncross-motions for summary judgment. \n1. Burlington Jail's Procedures \nBurlington Jail's intake procedures are based on the document—\"Policies and \nProcedures: Search of Inmates—No. Section 1186\" (hereinafter \"Section 1186\"). (See \nPl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at ¶ 8.) Section 1186 defines a strip \nsearch as \"a physical search of an inmate... while unclothed consisting of routine and \nsystematic visual observation of the inmate's physical body to look for distinguished \nidentifying marks, scars or deformities, signs of illness, injury or disease and/or the \nconcealment of contraband on the inmate's body.\" (Id. at ¶ 9.) The document also \nprovides that \"[a] person who has been detained or arrested for commission of an \noffense other than a crime[3] ... shall not be subject to a strip-search unless there is a \nreasonable suspicion that a weapon, controlled dangerous substance or contraband will \nbe found.\" (Id. at ¶ 10.) \nSeveral Burlington Jail officers and Warden Cole testified in depositions about these \nprocedures. Lieutenant Douglas Chilton has worked for the Burlington Jail since 1997. \n(Id. at ¶ 12.) He executed a document related to Plaintiff's alleged strip search entitled \n\"Strip Search Authorization Form.\" (Id.) This form indicates that Plaintiff was not strip \nsearched, per se. (Id.) Lieutenant Chilton testified during his deposition that arrestees \n\nwho are brought in for non-indictable offenses are subjected to a \"visual observation,\" \nwhile those admitted for indictable offenses are strip searched. (Id. at ¶ 13.) He further \ntestified that Plaintiff's Strip Search Authorization Form was marked \"not strip searched\" \nbecause he was admitted for a \"failure to appear,\" which is a non-indictable offense, \nand which mandates only a visual observation during intake. (Id.) \n498*498 Officer Haywood Reeder has worked at the Burlington Jail since 1990. (Id. at ¶ \n14.) He confirmed that arrestees admitted for non-indictable offenses, such as civil \ncontempt, should not be strip searched. (Id.) Relatedly, he defined a strip search as \nsearching various parts of a nude inmate's body for contraband, scars, marks, or \ntattoos. (Id. at ¶ 15.) He also testified that all inmates are subjected to a visual \nobservation irrespective of whether they are indictable or non-indictable. (Id. at ¶ 16.) \nAccording to Officer Reeder, a visual observation includes: (1) checking a nude \narrestee for scars, marks, and tattoos while he strips for a mandatory shower; (2) \ninstructing the nude arrestee on the application of a delousing agent; and (3) instructing \nthe nude arrestee to change into jail clothing following his shower. (Id. at ¶ 17.) \nOfficer Charles Palmer has worked for the Burlington Jail since 2000. (Id. at ¶ 18.) He \nalso testified that arrestees admitted for non-indictable offenses are subjected to a \nvisual observation. (Id.) Officer Palmer further testified that a visual observation involves \ntaking an inmate into the shower area, having him remove all his clothing, directing him \nto turn around— while nude—so the officer can look for bruises and distinguishing \nmarks, and then having the inmate take a shower. (Id. at ¶ 19.) According to Officer \nPalmer, the difference between a visual observation and a strip search is that, with the \nlatter, officers direct arrestees to spread their buttocks and/or lift their genitals. (Id. at ¶ \n20.) However, he acknowledged that he has found genital piercings and tattoos during \nvisual observations, (id.), which suggests there is a cursory examination of genitalia \nduring a visual observation. \nOfficer Sean Gallagher has worked for the Burlington Jail since 1996. (Id. at ¶ 21.) \nSimilar to the other officers, he testified that non-indictable arrestees, such as those \narrested for civil contempt, are subjected to a visual observation. (Id.) He further \ntestified that a visual observation entails taking the arrestee to a shower room, having \nhim remove his clothing and turn around while the officer looks at the arrestee's nude \nbody to check for scars, marks, tattoos, and body vermin, before finally instructing the \narrestee to shower with a delousing agent. (Id. at ¶ 22.) During these visual \nobservations, Officer Gallagher directs inmates with hanging genitalia to lift their \ngenitals in order to look for contraband, scars, marks, and tattoos. (Id. at ¶ 23.) When \nasked how this differed from a strip search, Officer Gallagher explained that strip \nsearches are \"a little more thorough,\" and involve having the inmate bend over and \nspread his buttocks so the officer can \"get a view of their anus to see if there is anything \nthat would be suspicious looking....\" (Id. at ¶ 24.) In any event, Officer Gallagher \nacknowledged that all arrestees, whether indictable or non-indictable, are required to \ntake off their clothing while the officer visually observes them and has them turn around. \n(Id. at ¶ 25.) According to Officer Gallagher, this procedure is required by the Burlington \n\nJail's custom and practice, which every corrections officer follows. (Id. at ¶ 26.) \nLieutenant Jerry Coleman has worked at the Burlington Jail since 1990. (Id. at ¶ 27.) He \ntestified that arrestees who are not indictable are subjected to a visual observation as \npart of the intake process. (Id.) According to Lieutenant Coleman, a visual observation \ninvolves an officer taking the arrestee to a shower room whereupon the arrestee \nremoves his clothing and turns around so as to allow the officer to check the arrestee's \nfront and back for deformities, bruises, marks, tattoos, and puncture wounds. (Id. at ¶ \n28.) Lieutenant Coleman also drew a distinction between 499*499 a visual observation \nand a strip search, claiming that the latter requires arrestees to bend down, squat, and \nlift their genitals. (Id. at ¶ 29.) \nLastly, Warden Juel Cole has worked at the Burlington Jail since 1976 and has been its \nwarden since 1997. (Id. at ¶ 30.) Like the officers, Warden Cole confirmed that an \narrestee admitted for a non-indictable offense is subjected to a visual observation, \nwhich involves an officer \"mak[ing] a quick check\" on a nude inmate while he changes \nclothing or during his shower for bruises, tattoos, or \"any item like that of any \nimportance.\" (Id. at ¶ 31) Sometimes, though apparently not always, the officer \nconducting the visual observation will direct the nude arrestee to turn around to facilitate \na full check of the arrestee's entire body. (Id. at ¶ 32.) Warden Cole acknowledged that \nif he directed an inmate to remove his clothing, he would be telling the inmate to \"strip\". \n(Id. at ¶ 33.) However, according to Warden Cole, a visual observation of an arrestee's \nnude body does not constitute a \"search\" under the Burlington Jail's definition of that \nterm. (Cole Dep. 31:11-16, Nov. 30, 2006.) \n2. Essex County Correctional Facility's Procedures \nEssex Jail intake procedures during the relevant class period are based on two \ndocuments: (1) a document entitled \"Department of Public Safety: General Order No. \n89-17\" (hereinafter \"Order No. 89-17\"); and (2) one called \"Department of Corrections: \nAdministrative Directive No. 04-06\" (hereinafter \"Directive No. 04-06\").[4] (See Pl.'s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts at ¶ 34.) Order No. 89-17 went into effect in \nSeptember 2002 and provides that, upon arrival at the Essex Jail, all arrestees shall be \nstrip searched and then required to shower. (Id. at ¶ 35.) It further states that a strip \nsearch is to consist of having an arrestee undress completely. (Id. at ¶ 36.) Officers are \nsupposed to \"observe carefully while the inmate undresses.\" (Id.) Moreover, officers are \nto examine the interior of the arrestee's mouth; his or her ears, nose, hair and scalp; his \nor her fingers, hands, arms, and armpits; and all body openings and the inner thighs. \n(Id. at ¶ 37.) \nOrder No. 89-17 was superceded in April 2005 by Directive No. 04-06. The latter \ndocument provides that officers are required to \"[c]onduct a thorough search of \nindividual inmates[.]\" (Id. at ¶ 38.) It further directs officers to have all arrestees shower \nduring intake. (Id. at ¶ 39.) Officers are required to \"[o]bserve and document\" any \nevidence of body markings, vermin or disease, sores, wounds, and other injuries. (Id. at \n¶ 40.) In contrast with Order No. 89-17, Directive No. 04-06 facially prohibits strip \n\nsearching non-indictable arrestees in the absence of reasonable suspicion that the \nsearch will produce weapons, drugs, or contraband. (Id. at ¶ 41.) \nEssex Jail officers and Warden Glover testified about intake procedures at that facility. \nSergeant Thomas Logue has worked for the Essex Jail since 2005, and was on intake \nduty on March 9, 2005, the night Plaintiff was booked. (Id. at ¶ 42.) He testified that, for \nintake processing purposes, all arrestees are treated the same, without any distinction \nbased on whether the arrestee is accused of an indictable or a non-indictable offense. \n(Id. 500*500 at ¶ 43.) According to Sergeant Logue, officers call up to three arrestees at \na time to enter the shower area during processing. (Id.) Once there, corrections officers \ndirect the arrestees to remove their clothing and place them into gray bins. (Id. at ¶ 44.) \nThe arrestees then simultaneously undress while the officers view their nude bodies. \n(Id.) Toward the end of his testimony, Sergeant Logue reiterated that the same intake \nprocedures are conducted for all arrestees irrespective of the nature of the charged \noffence. (Id. at ¶ 45.) \nOfficer Richard Monroig has worked at the Essex Jail since 1995. (Id. at ¶ 46.) Like \nSergeant Logue, Officer Monroig testified that arrestees are never segregated based on \nthe nature of their offense—i.e., indictable versus non-indictable—during the intake \nprocess. (Id.) Officer Monroig candidly explained that processing officers are not even \ntrained as to which charges are indictable and which are not indictable. (Id. at ¶ 47.) \nAccording to Officer Monroig, as part of the intake process, arrestees are lead, three at \na time, to a shower area where officers direct them to remove their clothing and shower. \n(Id. at ¶ 48.) The arrestees then take their clothes off and stand nude while an officer \nwatches. (Id.) \nLieutenant Michael Salzano has worked for the Essex Jail since 1987. (Id. at 49.) He \nworks in the shower room daily and is very familiar with the Essex Jail's intake \nprocedures. (Id.) These procedures include a mandatory shower. (Id. at ¶ 49.) \nConsistent with the previous testimony, Lieutenant Salzano testified that officers bring \nup to three arrestees into the shower room at a time, and direct them to remove their \nclothing and take a shower. (Id. at ¶ 50.) Lieutenant Salzano testified that this \nprocedure is the same regardless of whether the arrestee is admitted for an indictable \nor non-indictable offense. (Id. at ¶ 51.) \nLastly, Warden Larry Glover has been the warden at the Essex Jail since 2004. (Id. at \n52.) He testified that arrestees are searched to ensure they carry no contraband. (Id.) \nThis process includes having as many as three arrestees enter the shower area and \nremove their clothing, which officers proceed to search. (Id. at ¶ 53.) The arrestees \nshower shortly thereafter and then are directed to put on jail-issued clothing. (Id. at ¶ \n54.) \nC. Summary Judgment Cross-Motions \nPlaintiffs move for summary judgment, claiming that the procedures described above \namount to unconstitutional strip searches even if, in the case of Burlington Jail, the \n\nprocedures are termed a \"visual observation\" or if, in the case of the Essex Jail, the \nwritten policy now facially complies with New Jersey's strip searching rules. See \nFlorence, supra, at *5. Plaintiffs specifically allege that \nthe undisputed facts establish that Defendants' policy of strip-searching all arrestees \nwithout individualized suspicion is a violation of clearly established constitutional law. \n(Pl. Br. at 16.) Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants \"admit that every unnamed class \nmember ... has been ordered\" to completely disrobe and stand nude upon admission to \nthe jail facilities, \"without Defendants first articulating a reasonable basis to do so.\" (Id.) \nCiting persuasive albeit non-binding case law, Plaintiffs contend that, at minimum, \nindividualized reasonable suspicion for weapons, drugs, or other contraband must first \nexist before a jail official may strip search anyone charged with a non-indictable offense. \n(Id. at 15.) Because no reasonable suspicion existed before the instant searches took \nplace, Plaintiffs maintain that the searches violated their Fourth 501*501 Amendment \nrights. (Id.) Plaintiffs consequently assert an action arising under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, \nclaiming violation of their federal constitutional rights. Plaintiffs seek preliminary \ninjunctive relief against Burlington and Essex County Jails.[5] \nDefendants Burlington and Essex answer in their cross-motions that the visual \nobservations/strip search policies are constitutional, and they point to a recent trend in \nthe Circuit Courts of Appeal to substantiate this claim.[6] In doing so, Defendants ask \nthis Court to revisit the holding of Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F.Supp. 396 \n(D.N.J.1987), contending that it cannot withstand the \"weight\" of modern authority. (See\nDef. Burlington Reply Br. at 16.) Next, Defendants contend that the Board of Chosen \nFreeholders of Burlington County, Warden Cole in his official capacity, and Burlington \nCounty Jail are entitled to immunity as arms of the State of New Jersey pursuant to the \nEleventh Amendment. Defendant Warden Cole in his individual capacity contends that \nhe is entitled to qualified immunity, thereby barring money damages against him. \nFinally, Defendant Essex seeks dismissal of the § 1983 arrest claim by Plaintiff, \ncontending it is invalid. These claims are discussed in turn. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment shall be granted \"if there is no genuine issue of material fact and if, \nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" See Pearson v. Component Tech. Corp., 247 \nF.3d 471, 482 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 \nS.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)); accord Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). This Court will enter \nsummary judgment only when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \nand admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a \n\nmatter of law.\" See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \nAn issue is \"genuine\" if it is supported by such evidence that a reasonable jury could \nreturn a verdict in the nonmoving party's favor. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A fact is \"material\" if, under the \ngoverning substantive law, a dispute about the fact might affect the outcome of the suit. \nId. In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view \nthe facts and all reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio \nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). \nInitially, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine \nissue of material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 \nL.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Once 502*502 the moving party has met this burden, the \nnonmoving party must identify, by affidavits or otherwise, specific facts showing that \nthere is a genuine issue for trial. Id.; see also Maidenbaum v. Bally's Park Place, Inc., \n870 F.Supp. 1254, 1258 (D.N.J. 1994). Thus, to withstand a properly supported motion \nfor summary judgment, the nonmoving party must identify specific facts and affirmative \nevidence that contradict those offered by the moving party. Andersen, 477 U.S. at 256-\n57, 106 S.Ct. 2505. \"A nonmoving party may not `rest upon mere allegations, general \ndenials or... vague statements ...'\" See Trap Rock Indus., Inc. v. Local 825, Int'l Union of \nOperating Eng'rs, 982 F.2d 884, 890 (3d Cir.1992) (quoting Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., \n934 F.2d 497, 500 (3d Cir.1991)) \nIn deciding the merits of a party's motion for summary judgment, the Court's role is not \nto evaluate the evidence and decide the truth of the matter, but to determine whether \nthere is a genuine issue for trial. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, \n249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Credibility determinations are the province \nof the finder of fact. See Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 974 F.2d 1358, \n1363 (3d Cir.1992). If there is no genuine issue of material fact upon review of cross-\nmotions for summary judgment, then judgment may be entered in favor of the deserving \nparty in light of the law and undisputed facts. See Iberia Foods Corp. v. Romeo, Jr., 150 \nF.3d 298, 302 (3d Cir.1998) (citing Ciarlante v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 143 \nF.3d 139, 145-46 (3d Cir.1998)). \nB. Analysis \nIn the instant case, the first issue is whether the intake procedures of Burlington and \nEssex County are so intrusive that they rise to the level of \"strip search\". Assuming they \ndo, and there is no genuine issue of material fact to dispute, then the question of the \nconstitutionality of the searches, performed without reasonable suspicion, must be \naddressed. On this latter issue, a circuit split has recently developed. \n1. The Nature of the Burlington and Essex Intake \n\nProcedures \nDealing first with Burlington County, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether the \"visual observations\" constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. \nEach officer who testified admitted that everyone who enters the Burlington County Jail \nis subject to a visual observation, regardless of whether that person is an indictable or \nnon-indictable offender. This blanket policy entails a complete disrobing, followed by an \nexamination of the nude inmate for bruises, marks, wounds or other distinguishing \nfeatures by the supervising officer, which is then followed by a supervised shower with a \ndelousing agent. \nAccording to Burlington officers, the only distinction between a \"strip search\" and a \n\"visual observation\" is the thoroughness of the search. (See Pl.'s Statement of \nUndisputed Material Facts at ¶ 24.) Thus, whereas a strip search involves squatting, \nbending one's buttocks, and in the case of male inmates—lifting one's genitalia, (see id.\nat ¶ 20), a visual observation involves the slightly less intrusive procedure described \nabove. There is one discrepancy in the record, however. According to Officer Gallagher, \nmale inmates during visual observations are directed to lift their genitals. (Id. at ¶ 23.) \nTo him, a strip search is more thorough because of its attendant anal cavity inspection. \n(Id. at ¶ 24.) The other Burlington officers who distinguish a strip search from a visual \nobservation testified that a genital lift is done only in the case of a strip search. (See, \ne.g., Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at ¶¶ 17-20, 29.) \n503*503 Whatever the case may be, a discrepancy of this sort does not necessarily \nprovide a genuine issue of material fact. At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiff \nremarked— \"It's just common sense. Take off all your clothes. You're stripped \nsearched. A visual observation is a matter of semantics.\" (Oral Arg. Tr., 13:6-9, Nov. 10, \n2008.) Even if Warden Cole maintains that the visual observation of an incoming inmate \ndoes not constitute a search under the jail's definition of the word, (Cole Dep. at 31:11-\n16), that definition is of no consequence here. A visual observation is a search as \ndefined by the Fourth Amendment. See Johnson v. Phelan, 69 F.3d 144, 145 (7th \nCir.1995) (noting that \"observation is a form of search.\"). Whether it is called a `strip \nsearch' or a `visual observation'—the distinction going only to the intrusiveness of the \nsearch—it is still a search for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis. See, e.g., \nStanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 964 n. 2 (7th Cir.2003). The only question then, is \nwhether the searches of non-indictable offenders are unreasonable when conducted \npursuant to a blanket policy without reasonable suspicion. See infra Part III.B.2. \nAs for Essex, there is no attempt to distinguish between a `visual observation' and a \n`strip search'. When Plaintiff was arrested on March 3, 2005, Order No. 89-17 was in \neffect.[7] (Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact at ¶¶ 35-38.) That order required \nall incoming arrestees to be strip searched. (Id. at ¶ 35.) Like Burlington, inmates were \ninstructed to take a supervised shower. (Id. at ¶¶ 35-37.) Also like Burlington, inmates \nwere not segregated on the basis of indictable versus non-indictable offense. (Id. at ¶ \n43.) The only difference between the two counties' procedures was the extent of the \nsearch. Essex officers carefully observed the entire naked body of the inmate, including \n\nbody openings and inner thighs. (Id. at ¶ 37.) If the less-intrusive Burlington procedure \nconstitutes a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, it follows that the more-\nintrusive Essex procedure also constitutes a search. \nDefendant Essex County curiously contends that because its witnesses denied \"that \nthere was a custom or policy of strip-searching ... the alleged class in the case at bar\", \nsummary judgment should not be granted. (Def. Essex Br. at 26-27.) Essex further \ncontends that, as a result, \"Plaintiff has failed to establish a Monell violation.\"[8] (Def. \nEssex Br. at 25.) Not advancing these claims pursuant to any Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure, Essex seemingly argues that because Plaintiffs cannot establish a custom \nor policy on behalf of Essex County, (id.), summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs \nshould not be granted. Essex apparently seeks to raise a question of fact as to whether \nthe strip searches even occurred. Plaintiffs quickly respond by citing the formal strip \nsearch policy in place from 2002 until 2005, entitled \"Directive 89-17\", see supra. (Pl. \nOpp'n Br. at 7.) That policy mandated that 504*504 every person shall be strip searched \nupon intake. (Id.) In light of that policy, there is no genuine issue of material fact to \nprevent summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. Once again, the only question is \nwhether the search procedure of non-indictable offenders is unreasonable when it is \nperformed pursuant to a blanket policy without reasonable suspicion. \n2. Constitutionality of the Intake Procedures \nThe Supreme Court applied a Fourth Amendment[9] analytical framework to the body \nsearches of pre-trial detainees in the landmark case of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, \n559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). In that case, a federal short-term custodial \nfacility required pre-trial detainees to strip after each contact visit from an outside visitor. \nId. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The strip search enabled the officers to conduct a visual \ncavity inspection. Id. Detection and deterrence of drugs, weapons, or other contraband \nwas the stated goal of the correctional facility in conducting the strip searches. Id. The \nquestion before the Supreme Court was \"whether visual body-cavity inspections as \ncontemplated by the ... rules can ever be conducted on less than probable cause.\" Id. at \n560, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (alteration to original) (emphasis added). \nThe Court began its analysis by assuming that \"convicted prisoners and pretrial \ndetainees[ ] retain some Fourth Amendment rights upon commitment to a corrections \nfacility ...\" Id. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The Court then outlined a four-prong test to balance \n\"the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the \nsearch entails.\" Id. Specifically, the Supreme Court opined: \nCourts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is \nconducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted. \nId. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Applying the balancing test to the facts of that case,[10] the \nSupreme Court held that the searches did not offend the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 558, \n99 S.Ct. 1861 (\"The Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, and \nunder the circumstances, we do not believe that these searches are unreasonable.\") \n\n(internal citations omitted). The Court further held that the correctional facility could \nconduct such searches on less than probable cause. Id. at 560, 99 S.Ct. 1861. This \nholding resulted from a careful balancing of the \"significant and legitimate interests of \nthe institution against the privacy interests of the inmates...\" Id. \nIn the thirty years since Bell, the issue left ostensibly open for the lower courts is \nwhether reasonable suspicion is a minimal-threshold requirement for strip searches of \nincoming inmates or pretrial detainees. That issue was not addressed by the Supreme \nCourt in Bell, which dealt only with contact visits from outside visitors. Since that time, \nhowever, nine Circuit Courts of 505*505 Appeal and several District Courts have \naddressed the issue. These decisions provide useful guidance for the Court. \ni. Bell Progeny \nA district court in New Jersey first required reasonable suspicion to strip search inmates \nin Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F.Supp. 396, 401 (D.N.J.1987) (holding that a plaintiff's \nFourth Amendment rights were violated when she was strip searched without \nreasonable suspicion, as part of a blanket policy applied by a jail). In that case, the \nplaintiff accompanied police officers to the station house to lodge a formal complaint \nagainst her neighbor. Id. at 398. For whatever reason, the police ran a computer check \non the plaintiff, which indicated several outstanding warrants for parking ticket \nviolations, in addition to an assault and battery charge which had been issued some \nfour years prior to the date of the computer check. Id. The plaintiff was arrested, and \nthereafter strip searched upon her arrival at the county jail.[11] Id. The officers conceded \nthat reasonable suspicion for contraband was not present; instead they justified the \nsearch pursuant to N.J. ADMIN. CODE 10A:31-3.12(2) (1979).[12] Id. at 399. \nAddressing the constitutionality of the search, the Honorable Mitchell H. Cohen \nunderscored the then-unanimous Circuit Courts of Appeal, and held that \"there must be \na `reasonable suspicion' that an arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband in order \nfor a strip search to be constitutionally justified.\" Id. at 399. Judge Cohen specifically \ncited the reasoning of the Second Circuit, recognizing that: \nreasonable suspicion that a particular arrestee is concealing weapons or contraband \ncan arise, not only from the specific circumstances relating to the arrestee or the arrest, \nbut also from the nature of the charged offense. \nId. at 400 (citing Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796, 800 (2d Cir.1986)). Thus, the Court \nreasoned that a policy that mandates strip searches for all individuals charged with \nfelonies or drug-related/weapons-related misdemeanor offenses may be upheld \nbecause such policy contains an implicit recognition of reasonable suspicion, albeit a \ngeneral one. See Davis, 657 F.Supp. at 400-401. The policy at issue in Davis, however, \ndid not so limit the search to drug-related or weapons-related offenses. Rather, it \nmandated strip searches for \"[a]ll newly admitted inmates ...\"[13] 506*506 Davis, supra, \nat 398 n. 2 (citing N.J. ADMIN. CODE 10A:31-3.12(2) (1979)). Because the policy did \nnot incorporate the reasonable suspicion requirement, it was ruled unconstitutional. Id. \n\nat 401. \nSeveral other Courts in this District have since held the same. See, e.g., DiLoreto v. \nBorough of Oaklyn, 744 F.Supp. 610, 622 (D.N.J.1990) (holding that a visual strip \nsearch and subsequent viewing of plaintiff urinating was not reasonable \"on the basis of \nmere suspicion that a car in which the detainee was a passenger was stolen.\"); Ernst v. \nBorough of Fort Lee, 739 F.Supp. 220, 225 (D.N.J.1990) (\"The mere fact that an \narrestee will be incarcerated... does not render a strip search reasonable. Stated \nsomewhat differently, arrest itself, standing alone, is simply not enough.\"); O'Brien v. \nBorough of Woodbury Heights, 679 F.Supp. 429, 434 (D.N.J. 1988) (holding that \nstrip/body cavity searches of plaintiffs arrested for petty disorderly offenses were \nunconstitutional and \"senseless\"); cf. Wilkes v. Borough of Clayton, 696 F.Supp. 144, \n149 (D.N.J.1988) (holding borough's blanket policy of visual observation of arrestees \nusing bathroom facilities \"no less destructive of arrestees' rights than the visual strip \nsearches\" previously held unconstitutional). \nWith respect to the Circuit Courts of Appeal, eight circuits presently agree that \nreasonable suspicion must be present before a strip search is conducted in this context. \nSee Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 539 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008); Roberts v. \nRhode Island, 239 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2001); Weber v. Dell, 804 F.2d 796 (2d Cir.1986), \ncert. denied, 483 U.S. 1020, 107 S.Ct. 3263, 97 L.Ed.2d 762 (1987); Masters v. Crouch,\n872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 977, 110 S.Ct. 503, 107 \nL.Ed.2d 506 (1989); Jones v. Edwards, 770 F.2d 739 (8th Cir. 1985); Stewart v. County \nof Lubbock, 767 F.2d 153 (5th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1066, 106 S.Ct. 1378, \n89 L.Ed.2d 604 (1986); Hill v. Bogans, 735 F.2d 391 (10th Cir.1984); Mary Beth G. v. \nCity of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263 (7th Cir. 1983); Logan v. Shealy, 660 F.2d 1007 (4th \nCir.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 942, 102 S.Ct. 1435, 71 L.Ed.2d 653 (1982). This \nconsensus is buttressed by valid concerns for privacy, dignity, and the preservation of \nself-worth. See, e.g., Roberts, 239 F.3d at 110 (considering strip searches an \"extreme \nintrusion\" on personal privacy and \"an offense to the dignity of the individual\") (citation \nomitted); Chapman v. Nichols, 989 F.2d 393, 396 (10th Cir.1993) (\"It is axiomatic that a \nstrip search represents a serious intrusion upon personal rights.\"); Mary Beth G., 723 \nF.2d at 1272 (7th Cir.1983) (considering strip searches \"demeaning, dehumanizing, \nundignified, embarrassing and repulsive\"); see also, O'Brien, 679 F.Supp. at 434 \n(D.N.J.1988) (describing strip/body cavity searches of plaintiffs for disorderly offenses \nas \"humiliat[ing] and degrad[ing]\"). In short, a clear consensus demonstrates that these \nsearches are undignified and unconstitutional. \nDefendants disagree and contend that \"[t]he weight of current authority nationwide as to \nthe legality of blanket strip searches in prisons has turned overwhelmingly in favor of \nupholding such searches.\" (Def.'s Burlington Reply Br. at 2.) In light of this \n\"overwhelming\" authority, Defendants contend that \"Davis misinterpreted the Supreme \nCourt's ruling in Bell v. Wolfish, and this court should not adhere to its result.\" (Id.) \n(internal citation omitted). Defendants are correct that a circuit split has developed, but it \nis an overstatement 507*507 to say that \"current authority\" has \"turned \n\noverwhelmingly\". \nii. Competing Authority \nThere are three cases that indicate a new trend. First, the Seventh Circuit recently \nupheld a clothing-exchange procedure that requires inmates to disrobe in front of same-\nsex officers and put on jail-issued uniforms. See Stanley v. Henson, 337 F.3d 961, 966-\n67 (7th Cir.2003).[14] Second, the Ninth Circuit's recent holding in Bull v. City and \nCounty of S.F., see supra, can be attributed to Circuit Judge Ikuta, who concurred only \nbecause he felt \"compelled by Ninth Circuit case law.\" See Bull, 539 F.3d at 1202. In his \nconcurrence, he opined that the Ninth Circuit misconstrued Bell v. Wolfish. Id. at 1202-\n05. Third, and most significantly, the Eleventh Circuit recently overruled its precedent \nthat previously required reasonable suspicion for strip searches. See generally, Powell \nv. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc). There, the en banc Court held that \nso long as the strip search is no more intrusive than the one conducted in Bell, then \nreasonable suspicion is not required for the search of an incoming inmate, regardless of \nwhether the underlying arrest is for a misdemeanor or a felony. Id. at 1314. These new \ncases do not present controlling authority, but neither do the cases cited from different \ncourts sitting in this District. As a result, this Court shall examine the cases to determine \nwhether there are new reasons to depart from Davis. \nBeginning with Stanley, the plaintiff in that case was arrested for misdemeanor charges \nof resisting arrest and battery on a police officer. Stanley, 337 F.3d at 962. At the police \nstation, she was told to remove all her clothes except her underpants, and to put on a \njail-issued uniform. Id. This process occurred in an open, albeit small room, with an \nofficer watching. Id. During the two-minute procedure, the officer did not conduct a \nvisual inspection of the plaintiff's orifices, nor did she touch the plaintiff in any way. Id. \nAfter her charges were dropped, the plaintiff in Stanley filed a § 1983 claim alleging the \nclothing-exchange procedure violated her Fourth Amendment rights. Id. at 962-63. \nSpecifically, she contended that the procedure amounted to an \"intrusive strip search\" \nperformed \"without regard\" to her particular charge. Id. The Seventh Circuit began its \nanalysis by concluding that, at minimum, a search had occurred: \nThe presence of a jail officer who continuously observed Ms. Stanley as she exchanged \nher clothing ... suggests that this was more than an administrative procedure for \nchanging into a jail uniform; it implies that the officer's purpose was to watch over Ms. \nStanley to ensure that nothing illicit was brought into or out of the jail. \nId. at 964. The Seventh Circuit rightfully held that \"observation\" is a form of search for \npurposes of the Fourth Amendment. Id. The Circuit then performed the Bell balancing \ntest, ultimately concluding that the procedure did not offend the Fourth Amendment. \nStanley, 337 F.3d at 967. The scope of the intrusion was relatively narrow in light of the \n\"objective of preventing the smuggling of weapons or other contraband into ... the jail \npopulation.\" Id. at 966. \n\nStanley demonstrates that a search procedure justified on the basis of jail security may \nbe upheld if it is minimally intrusive and by consequence, respectful, of privacy and \nhuman, dignity. Such a procedure is not only consistent with the Fourth 508*508 \nAmendment, it is also consistent with the policy concerns of jail officials. While the \npurpose of the search was similar to the instant case, the means to serve that purpose \nwere decidedly less intrusive. For example, there the underpants remain on at all times, \nand no one is forced to undergo a supervised shower. \nNext, Defendants point to the recent Ninth Circuit decision in Bull to lend support to their \nposition that strip searches done without reasonable suspicion are constitutional.[15] \n(See Oral Arg. Tr. at 30-31, Nov. 10, 2008.) Even though that case held in concert with \nthe majority of circuits opposing such searches, Defendants point to the concurring \nopinion of Circuit Judge Ikuta. He opined, \"I concur in the majority's opinion with \nreluctance and grave concern. While compelled by Ninth Circuit case law, the \ndisposition is in tension with Supreme Court precedent.\" Bull, 539 F.3d at 1202 (Ikuta, \nJ., concurring). \nIn his view, Ninth Circuit jurisprudence places undue reliance on evidence of a \nsmuggling problem when deciding the reasonableness of a strip-search procedure. This \nreliance, he writes, is contrary to the dictates of Bell. Id. at 1203. In Bell, the \nadministrators had \"proved only one instance in the [detention facility's] short history \nwhere contraband was found during a body cavity search.\" Id. (quoting Bell, supra, at \n558, 99 S.Ct. 1861). The Supreme Court nevertheless upheld the blanket strip search \nprocedure, and stated that \"the lack of evidence was of little import.\" Id. (citing Bell, \nsupra, at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861) (emphasis added). In short, Judge Ikuta's concern was \nthat the Ninth Circuit adopted the very standard that the Supreme Court rejected in Bell.\nWhile Judge Ikuta's concurrence provides guidance with respect to the Bell balancing \ntest, it does not change the fact that the Ninth Circuit struck down a strip search \nprocedure, similar to the one here, as unconstitutional. That holding lends further \nsupport to Plaintiff's claim, and does little to advance the cause of Defendants. \nDefendants next cite Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir.2008) (en banc).[16] Due \nto the heavy reliance on this case, a thorough examination is required. (See Oral Arg. \nTr. at 21:9-12, Nov. 10, 2008.) (\"I could not state better than the Eleventh Circuit ... I \nbelieve that the Eleventh Circuit interpretation of Bell is exactly correct.\"). \nPowell represents the first clear break with the holding of the majority of Circuits, \neffectively creating a Circuit split. The issue before the en banc Circuit was: \nwhether a policy or practice of strip searching all arrestees as part of a process of \nbooking them into a general population of a detention facility, even without reasonable \nsuspicion to believe that they may be concealing contraband, is constitutionally \npermissible. \nId. at 1300. Answering in the affirmative, the Eleventh Circuit not only overruled its own \n\nprecedent, it also rejected the persuasive precedent of several circuits that distinguish \nmisdemeanor-booking procedure 509*509 from that of felony. See id. at 1309 \n(acknowledging that some circuits require reasonable suspicion to strip search persons \ncharged with misdemeanor offenses, unlike felony, offenses, where no level of \nsuspicion is required). Citing a string of cases holding to that effect from the Sixth, Fifth, \nNinth, and Seventh Circuits,[17] the Eleventh Circuit states bluntly—\"[t]hose decisions \nare wrong.\" Id. at 1310. \nBefore fully examining the Circuit's view of the misdemeanor/felony distinction, it is \nimportant to first examine the reasoning behind the Eleventh Circuit's principle holding. \nThe Eleventh Circuit states: \nThe security needs that the Court in Bell found to justify strip searching an inmate re-\nentering the jail population after a contact visit are no greater than those that justify \nsearching an arrestee when he is booked into the general population for the first time. \nPowell, 541 F.3d at 1302. Thus, the Circuit based its holding in part on an analogy \nbetween an incoming inmate and an admitted inmate, after a contact visit; the former is \ndifferent, it reasoned, only because his `contact' with the outside lasted his entire pre-\narrest life. Id. at 1313. By implication, if a contact visit for an admitted inmate provides \nan opportunity to smuggle contraband, then surely \"one big and prolonged contact visit \nwith the outside world\", see id., for an incoming inmate provides an even a greater \nopportunity to smuggle contraband. Although logically sound, this argument discounts \nthe fact that, by and large, most arrests are a surprise to the arrestee. Such a surprise \ndoes not give the arrestee an opportunity to plan a smuggling enterprise, unlike an \nadmitted inmate who has knowledge of a forthcoming contact visit. \nThe Circuit also bases its holding on the contention that the officers in Bell did not have \nreasonable suspicion prior to conducting the blanket policy searches. See Powell, \nsupra, at 1307 (\"When the [Supreme] [C]ourt stated that `these searches' do not violate \nthe Fourth Amendment, it obviously meant the searches that were before it, and those \nsearches were conducted under a blanket policy without reasonable suspicion.\"). Yet, \njust because the searches in Bell were conducted pursuant to a blanket policy does not \nmean that reasonable suspicion was lacking. The searches in Bell were conducted after \ncontact visits with outside visitors, during which time exposure to contraband is \nheightened. Cf. Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2001) (noting that \"contraband \nis often passed\" during contact visits). These visits, by their very nature, may then \nprovide the requisite reasonable suspicion for jail officers to justify the blanket search \npolicy. Such searches are consistent with the reasonable blanket-risk-assessment \napproach discussed in Davis and adopted by the several circuits that distinguish \nbetween misdemeanor and felony offenses. See Davis, 657 F.Supp. at 400-01. The \nmere fact that strip searches were conducted after contact visits pursuant to a blanket \npolicy does not, by necessity, eradicate any reasonable suspicion used to justify them. \nIndividualized reasonable suspicion may be lacking, but given the safety concerns of \nhousing an admitted inmate in a detention setting, such a policy may nonetheless \n\n510*510 be constitutional if supported by the Bell balancing test. \nOne final aspect of the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning is worth noting. The Circuit \ndisagrees with its sister circuits' interpretation of the phrase, \"less than probable cause.\" \nSee id. at 1307. It states: \nThe Bell decision, correctly read, is inconsistent with the conclusion that the Fourth \nAmendment requires reasonable suspicion before an inmate entering or re-entering a \ndetention facility may be subjected to a strip search that includes a body cavity \ninspection. \nId. To support this conclusion, the Circuit states that the Supreme Court did not \nexpressly require reasonable suspicion in Bell; it only held that strip searches could be \nconducted on \"less than probable cause.\" Id. at 1309 (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 560, 99 \nS.Ct. 1861). The Circuit then reasons that \"the absence of reasonable suspicion is also \nless than probable cause.\" Id. To be sure, this proposition is technically correct. In \nsupport, the Circuit cites Justice Powell's opinion in Bell calling for \"at least some level \nof cause, such as reasonable suspicion ...\" Id. (citing Bell, 441 U.S. at 563, 99 S.Ct. \n1861) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The Circuit subsequently \nconcludes: \"Obviously, Justice Powell would not have dissented from a holding that the \nCourt had not made.\" \nTo begin, the conclusion that `less than probable cause' implicitly means `no \nreasonable suspicion' is too great of a logical leap without any more direction than a \nfour-line concurrence and dissent by Justice Powell. While it may be true that Justice \nPowell \"would not have dissented from a holding that the Court had not made,\" other \nreasons for the dissent are equally plausible. For example, Justice Powell may have \ndissented out of protest, assuming that the Justices failed to obtain enough votes to \nmake a positive ruling on the issue. Rather than forfeit an entire holding, the majority \nCourt may have deemed it prudent to leave the interpretation of the phrase \"less than \nprobable cause\" to the lower courts.[18] Still even more plausible, the Court may have \nrefrained from making a positive ruling on the issue simply because the particular \nquestion of reasonable suspicion was not before the Court. See, e.g., Harmon v. \nBrucker, 355 U.S. 579, 581, 78 S.Ct. 433, 2 L.Ed.2d 503 (1958) (recognizing the \"duty \nto avoid deciding constitutional questions presented unless essential to a proper \ndisposition of a case ...\"). Speculation of this sort is justified only to show that there is \nmore than one way to explain Justice Powell's four-line dissent. In any event, this \ninterpretive approach rests on tenuous ground. Even the majority in Powell \nacknowledges that \"it can be risky to place too much reliance on dissenting opinions ...\" \nPowell, 541 F.3d at 1308; see also Powell, 541 F.3d at 1314 (Edmondson, J., \nconcurring) (\"I think it is jurisprudentially unsound to look at a Justice's dissenting \nopinion to determine what the Supreme Court has decided in a case.\"). \nThe only remaining issue is the misdemeanor/felony distinction. The Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly states that the misdemeanor/felony 511*511 distinction finds no basis in the \nBell decision, as the Supreme Court in that case dealt with a blanket-policy covering all \n\ninmates at the detention facility. Id. Some of those inmates were held for \"contempt of \ncourt\", still others included \"witnesses in protective custody who had not been accused \nof doing anything wrong\". The point being that these are not persons one might \nordinarily suspect of smuggling contraband. Id. (citing Bell, supra, at 524 & n. 3, 99 \nS.Ct. 1861). But even if that policy made no distinction between misdemeanor and \nfelony offenders, the persons strip searched pursuant to the policy were admitted \ninmates exposed to outside individuals via planned contact visits. That situation is quite \ndifferent from the instant matter. Here, individuals are strip searched as they first enter \nthe facility, without consideration of the crimes or offenses for which they are charged. \nFor reasons already stated, see pp. 509-10 of this Opinion, the situations are \ninapposite. \nAside from the asserted lack of foundation in case law, the Eleventh Circuit further \nstates that the distinction has \"no constitutional significance when it comes to detention \nfacility strip searches.\" Id. As a textual matter, the Fourth Amendment affords no more \nprotections to persons charged with misdemeanors than it does to those charged with \nfelonies. Nevertheless, Fourth Amendment history and jurisprudence requires a careful \nbalancing between the instant concerns of personal privacy and administration of \nsecurity. See Bell, supra, at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861. After performing this balancing test, \never mindful that the Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable\" searches, four \ncircuits have concluded that a distinction between misdemeanor or non-indictable \noffenses and felony or indictable offenses is appropriate. See, e.g., Hartline v. Gallo, \n546 F.3d 95, 102 (2d Cir.2008) (\"[F]or more than twenty years this Court has held that a \nmisdemeanor arrestee may not be strip searched in the absence of individualized \nreasonable suspicion that she is secreting contraband.\") Indeed, this Court noted in its \nOpinion certifying the instant class that a similar distinction is recognized in this district. \nFlorence, supra, at *16 (\"Davis requires strip searches to be based on reasonable \nsuspicion... which can be supplied by specific facts known about the arrestee or the \narrest, or the nature of the charged arrest.\") (citing Davis, supra, at 399-400) (emphasis \nadded); see also O'Brien, 679 F.Supp. at 434 (holding that strip/body cavity searches of \nplaintiffs arrested for petty disorderly offenses were unconstitutional and \"senseless\"). \nThe courts that have required individualized reasonable suspicion prior to a strip search \nof misdemeanor or non-indictable arrestees have done so not because the Fourth \nAmendment textually grants such arrestees special protection; rather, courts have done \nso after analyzing valid concerns of personal privacy and security, adhering all the while \nto the Bell balancing test outlined by the Supreme Court. The Eleventh Circuit \ndisregards this fact by ruling the misdemeanor/felony distinction meaningless. \nUltimately, Powell is persuasive due to its novel reasoning and sheer en banc force. \nNevertheless, this Court ultimately finds its contrarian holding less than compelling. The \npost-contact visit searches upheld in Bell are dissimilar to the post-intake searches \nstruck down by the circuits in the thirty years since that decision. Thus, Powell does not \npresent a convincing argument to depart from Davis. \niii. Burlington and Essex Counties \n\nThe search procedures at Burlington and Essex County jails do not pass constitutional \nmuster under the Bell balancing test. Furthermore, the Bell progeny 512*512 supports \nthe holding that strip searches of non-indictable offenders performed without reasonable \nsuspicion violates the Fourth Amendment (made applicable to the states through the \nFourteenth Amendment). Although the scope of the particular intrusion at Burlington \nmay be less intrusive than the one in place at Essex, both procedures involve a \ncomplete disrobing, examination of the nude inmate's body, followed by a supervised \nshower. With respect to place, these procedures occur in a shower room where privacy \nis minimal. \nAs for the manner in which the strip searches are conducted, both procedures take \nplace in the presence of other inmates, which further contributes to the humiliating and \ndegrading nature of the experience. The searches are performed pursuant to a blanket \npolicy without distinction between indictable and non-indictable offenders. Thus, a \nhypothetical priest or minister arrested for allegedly skimming the Sunday collection \nwould be subjected to the same degrading procedure as a gang-member arrested on \nan allegation of drug charges. Arguments extolling the virtue of administrative efficiency \nin a jail setting cannot overcome this unreasonable result. \nThe final prong of the Bell balancing test concerns the facility's justification for the \npolicy. Burlington County and Essex County both appeal to general security concerns. \n(See Def. Burlington Br. at 7 & Def. Essex Br. at 27.) While Essex attaches an expert \nreport by George M. Camp of the Criminal Justice Institute calling for \"admissions \nsearches\" for all incoming inmates, (See Def. Essex Ex. D.) (opining that \"jails are more \ndangerous than prisons\"), Burlington attaches reports on gang violence throughout New \nJersey. (See Def. Ex. C.) \nBurlington makes the case that the search policy is not only necessary to prevent \nsmuggling of contraband, but also to identify gang members through body markings, \ntattoos, and piercings. (See Def. Burlington Br. at 8.) They state, \"[t]he simple fact is \nthat if a correctional facility fails to identify members of rival gangs, and house rival \nmembers in the same cell, inmates and/or staff members will be injured or die.\" (Id.) \nThis statement references a 2004 New Jersey State Police Survey indicating statewide \ngang membership at 16,701 with 516 gangs. (See Def. Burlington Br. at 8 n. 6.) \nBurlington also references an exhibit showcasing new statistics from a 2007 survey of \nthe New Jersey State Police. According to that survey, just nine out of twenty-five \ntownships and boroughs in Burlington County reported zero gang presence. (Def. Ex. \nC.) These statistics lend some weight to Burlington's argument, but they are not enough \nto carry the day. Surely a visual observation—which for purposes here is tantamount to \na strip search and therefore highly intrusive and degrading— is not the only method \navailable to jail officials to screen for potential gang members upon intake. Moreover, \nnothing in this Court's holding prohibits jail officials from ever searching non-indictable \noffenders, assuming they have reasonable suspicion to do so. \nBurlington also appeals to health concerns in its justification of the search policy. (See \nDef. Burlington, Br. at 9.) They state, \"M.R.S.A.[19] is most commonly detected 513*513 \n\nby the presence of abscesses, cellulitis, boils, carbuncles, and impetigo, all of which \ncould be missed absent a visual inspection of the inmate's entire body.\" Id. Essex does \nnot make a similar health-related argument. \nPointedly, this Court fails to see how a private screening with a licensed medical \nprofessional cannot sufficiently alleviate Burlington's concerns with respect to the \nspread of M.R.S.A. or other staph infections. The fact that Defendants provide no \naffidavits certifying the presence of such health threats in their facility, other than citing \nnationwide statistics provided by the \"Kaiser [sic] Foundation\" in 2007, is telling.[20] (Def. \nBurlington Br. at 9 n. 7.) While the threat of M.R.S.A. is undoubtedly serious, the \nspecter of staph infection alone does not, ipso facto, trump Fourth Amendment \nprotections in this case. \nFinally, it is worth noting that neither county submits supporting affidavits that detail \nevidence of a smuggling problem specific to their respective facilities. Although the \nSupreme Court opined that evidence of a smuggling problem is \"of little import\" to the \nanalysis, see Bell, 441 U.S. at 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, it did not exclude the evidence from \nanalysis altogether. In sum, the search policies at issue fail the Bell balancing test. \nMoreover, the overwhelming weight of authority still supports the conclusion that \nblanket strip searches of non-indictable offenders, performed without reasonable \nsuspicion for drugs, weapons, or other contraband, is unconstitutional. As a result, \nPlaintiff's motion for summary judgment on this issue is granted. Defendant's cross-\nmotion for summary judgment is denied. The question that arises from this holding is \nthe remedy. \n3. Preliminary Injunction \nPlaintiffs seek preliminary injunctive relief on behalf of the certified class against \nDefendants Burlington and Essex Counties. (Pl. Br. at 22.) A preliminary injunction is \nappropriate when the party seeking such relief shows: (1) a reasonable probability of \nsuccess on the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) that the non-moving party will not suffer \ngreater harm if the injunction is granted; and (4) public interest favors the granting of the \ninjunction. See Child Evangelism Fellowship of New Jersey v. Stafford Twp. Sch. Dist., \n386 F.3d 514, 524 (3d Cir.2004). Only if all four factors favor injunctive relief will \nDefendant be enjoined from the alleged conduct. See New Jersey Hosp. Ass'n. v. \nWaldman, 73 F.3d 509, 512 (3d Cir.1995). \nHere, Plaintiffs contend that there is a \"strong probability\" of success on the merits in \nthis case. Given the holding of this District, coupled with the 514*514 holdings from \neight Circuit Courts of Appeal, see supra, this contention is valid. Irreparable harm, \nhowever, is another matter. A party moving for injunctive relief has the burden of \ndemonstrating irreparable harm. Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.1989). The oft-\ncited standard for irreparable harm is a \"clear showing of immediate irreparable injury\". \nSee Continental Group, Inc. v. Amoco Chemicals Corp., 614 F.2d 351 (3d Cir.1980). \nIrreparable harm is met when \"a plaintiff demonstrates a significant risk that he or she \nwill experience harm that cannot be adequately compensated.\" Adams v. Freedom \n\nForge Corp., 204 F.3d 475, 484-485 (3d Cir.2000) (emphasis added). \nIn DiLoreto v. Borough of Oaklyn, 744 F.Supp. 610 (D.N.J.1990), this District denied \ninjunctive relief for a plaintiff in a strip search context, where that plaintiff \"failed to show \nany likelihood that she is likely to be subjected to strip searches in the future ...\" Id. at \n624 (citing City of L.A. v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983)). \nHere, too, Plaintiffs have failed to show any risk that they are likely to be subjected to \nstrip searches in the future. Even if a \"§ 1983 plaintiff's allegation that he has suffered \nfrom unconstitutional practices may be sufficient to establish standing to sue for \ndamages, `[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or \ncontroversy regarding injunctive relief.'\" Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395, 400 (3d \nCir.1987) (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 \n(1974)). Because this likelihood has not been shown, Plaintiffs' motion for injunctive \nrelief must be denied for lack of standing. Because Plaintiffs fail in this regard, the \nremaining factors of the test need not be addressed. \n4. Eleventh Amendment Immunity \nThe Eleventh Amendment provides: \"The Judicial power of the United States shall not \nbe construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against \none of the United States by citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any \nForeign State.\" U.S. CONST, amend XI. This Amendment bars suits by private parties \nagainst a state, see Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d \n662 (1974) (recognizing that a state or Congress may waive such immunity via statute), \neven when a state is charged with a § 1983 violation. Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, \n345, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979). \nAs for state entities other than the state itself, it is well settled that \"counties, \nmunicipalities and political subdivisions are not protected by the Eleventh Amendment.\" \nFebres v. Camden Bd. of Educ., 445 F.3d 227, 229 (3d Cir.2006) (citing Mt. Healthy \nCity Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 280, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 \n(1977)). Some entities may be entitled to immunity, however, if deemed an arm of the \nstate. Febres, 445 F.3d at 229. The test to determine whether an entity is an arm of the \nstate and therefore entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity is three-fold: (1) whether \npayment of a judgment resulting from the suit would come from the state treasury, (2) \nthe status of the entity under state law, and (3) the entity's degree of autonomy. See \nChisolm v. McManimon, 275 F.3d 315, 323 (3d Cir.2001) (citing Fitchik v. New Jersey \nTransit Rail Operations, Inc., 873 F.2d 655, 659 (3d Cir.1989) (en banc)). The Third \nCircuit has repeatedly held that the most important factor is whether the payment of a \njudgment would come from the state treasury. Chisolm, supra, at 323 (citing Carter v. \nCity of Phila., 181 F.3d 515*515 339, 348 (3d Cir.1999)). Significantly, because \nEleventh Amendment immunity is an affirmative defense, the burden of proving \napplicability is on the party asserting it. See Carter v. City of Philadelphia, 181 F.3d 339, \n347 (3d Cir.1999). \nDefendants Board of Chosen Freeholders of Burlington County, Warden Cole in his \n\nofficial capacity, and Burlington Jail contend they are entitled to Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity. (Def. Br. at 11-12.) Defendants rely on New Jersey case law that purports to \nrecognize counties as arms of the state. See, e.g., State v. Rush, 46 N.J. 399, 414, 217 \nA.2d 441 (1966) (noting that counties meet the costs of prosecutions and are \nconsidered subdivisions of the state); and Bergen County v. Port of N.Y. Auth., 32 N.J. \n303, 312, 160 A.2d 811 (1960) (\"[H]istorically the county was solely a subdivision of the \nState constituted to administer state power and authority.\"). These decisions supply \nsome evidence of the status of counties under New Jersey law, but they do not address \nthe precise issue as to whether the Board of Chosen Freeholders, Warden Cole in his \nofficial capacity, and Burlington Jail are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. In \nfact, Defendants advance no argument as to the third prong of the Fitchik test other \nthan the citations to these cases. \nThe first and most important factor in the Fitchik analysis is whether payment from a \njudgment will be satisfied by the state treasury. If a judgment against any of the three \nBurlington Defendants is to be paid from the state treasury, then the state essentially \nbecomes a party in interest to the litigation. See Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. \nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 101, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). This fact—if true—\ncuts in favor of granting immunity to Defendants. Yet, once again Defendants submit no \nevidence to show that liabilities from a potential judgment will be paid by the state \ntreasury. The record is silent. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, underscore that Burlington \nCounty maintains ten million dollars in general liability insurance pursuant to Policy No. \nMDB 0266755. (Lask Certif. Ex. D, filed 9/22/2008). The fact that a state entity is self-\ninsured cuts against the finding of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See Fitchik, 873 \nF.2d at 661 (3d Cir.1989). Defendants parry this argument in their reply brief, choosing \ninstead to rely on a recent unpublished decision in this District that does not address the \nself-insured issue. See Haddad v. Flynn, 2008 WL 4224921 (D.N.J. Sept. 9, 2008). \nGiven this response, the first and most important factor in the analysis does not favor \nthe granting of immunity. \nThe Fitchik autonomy prong remains. Defendants cite to N.J. ADMIN. CODE 10A:31-\n8.5 to demonstrate a lack of autonomy. (Def.'s Burlington Br. at 13.) Defendants state \nthat this regulation, promulgated by the State Department of Corrections (\"DOC\"), \ngoverns the conduct inside the Burlington Jail. (Id.) The inference is that each \nBurlington Defendant is duty-bound to adhere to the regulation. To be sure, DOC has \nauthority \"over all county and city jails or places of detention.\" (Id.) But that does not \ncomplete the inquiry. Another portion of Title 10 provides that \"each [jail] facility shall \ndevelop and implement a comprehensive written plan governing searches of facilities \nand inmates.\" N.J. ADMIN. CODE 10A:31-8.2(b). This suggests a degree of autonomy \nwhereby a jail facility, like Burlington, could implement its own plan for intake \nprocedures. As Warden Cole in his official capacity represents the Jail, he too shares \nthis degree of autonomy. In fact, it appears both entities have fulfilled this task with \nnoble intentions. According to Section 1186, see supra, of the Policies 516*516 and \nProcedures of the Burlington Jail, \"[i]n the absence of reasonable suspicion or other \npermitting circumstances, inmates committed on non-indictable charges shall not be \nstrip searched.\" (Pl. Ex. L.) Regardless of the fact that all inmates were subjected to \n\nwhat they called a \"visual observation\", this policy guide demonstrates the autonomy \nthat Defendants Burlington Jail and Warden Cole enjoyed. \nWith respect to the Board of Chosen Freeholders, this governing body enjoys \nconsiderable autonomy consistent with the strong tradition of home rule in New Jersey. \nSee N.J. STAT. ANN. 40:20-1.2 (\"The grant of powers shall be construed as liberally as \npossible in regard to the county's right to reorganize its structure and to alter or abolish \nits agencies.\"). For example, the Board of Chosen Freeholders is \"empowered to make \npolicy and management decisions\", see N.J. STAT. ANN. 40:20-1.4, including the \npower to adopt its own \"administrative code\". See N.J. STAT. ANN. 40:20-1.3(a). \nThese findings aside, Defendants' arguments and factual averments are too scant to \nsupport a finding of Eleventh Amendment immunity. Defendants have not carried their \nburden. As a result, this Court cannot support an application of Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity to the Board of Chosen Freeholders, Warden Cole in his official capacity, or \nBurlington Jail. Based on the present record before it, such a finding, if warranted, is \npremature.[21] Defendants' claim is therefore denied without prejudice. \n5. Qualified Immunity \nThe doctrine of qualified immunity provides that \"government officials performing \ndiscretionary functions ... are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their \nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a \nreasonable person should have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 \nS.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Thus, the threshold question must be: \"[t]aken in the \nlight most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the \nofficer's conduct violated a constitutional right?\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 \nS.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). If a constitutional violation exists, then the next \nquestion must be whether that right was clearly established at the time of the violation. \nId. The general touchstone is whether the conduct of the official was reasonable at the \ntime it occurred. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 198, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 \nL.Ed.2d 583 (2004). Finally, because qualified immunity is an affirmative defense, the \nburden of proving its applicability rests with the defendant. See Beers-Capital v. \nWhetzel, 256 F.3d 120, 142, n. 15 (3d Cir.2001). \nHere, Warden Cole in his individual capacity is not entitled to qualified immunity. As \ndiscussed above, see Part III.B.2.iii of this Opinion, a constitutional violation is clearly \npresent. The \"visual observations\" of all incoming inmates charged with non-indictable \noffenses, performed without reasonable suspicion, violates the Fourth Amendment. \nEven incoming inmates have the right to be free from unreasonable searches. \nThe next question, then, is whether the right violated by Warden Cole in his individual \ncapacity was clearly established at the time the searches took place—i.e. from March 3, \n2003 to March 20, 2008. This Court stated in its Opinion 517*517 certifying class—\n\"Davis is an Opinion of this Court and is therefore the law within this district.\" Florence, \nsupra, at *16. In accordance with that statement, Davis has been the law within this \n\ndistrict for nearly twenty-two years. See generally Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F.Supp. \n396 (1987). Additional decisions by other courts in this district have supported and \nrelied on that holding. See, e.g., DiLoreto v. Borough of Oaklyn, 744 F.Supp. 610 \n(D.N.J.1990); Ernst v. Borough of Fort Lee, 739 F.Supp. 220 (D.N.J.1990); O'Brien v. \nBorough of Woodbury Heights, 679 F.Supp. 429 (1988); Roderique v. Kovac, 1987 WL \n17058 (D.N.J. September 14, 1987). The fact that the Third Circuit has not ruled on the \npresent issue does not somehow lessen the binding effect of these judgments. \nTherefore, some level of suspicion has been required to strip search non-indictable or \nminor offenders since 1987. Given that Warden Cole has worked at the Burlington \nCounty Jail since 1976, serving as its Warden since 1997, it strains credulity that he \nwas not aware of the fact that the policy in place at Burlington Jail was unconstitutional. \nThus, \"if the law was clearly established, the immunity defense ordinarily should fail, \nsince a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his \nconduct.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 \n(1982). \nDefendant nonetheless contends that the search policy was objectively reasonable \nbecause it was implemented pursuant to a state regulation. Specifically, Defendants \nmaintain that the searches were conducted pursuant to N.J. ADMIN. CODE. 10A:31-\n8.5. That statute reads in relevant part: \n(b) Strip Searches may be conducted in any of the following circumstances: \n1. Prior to admitting a person lawfully confined to an adult county correctional facility, \nprison or jail by court order or pursuant to an arrest authorized by law; \n2. Before an inmate enters the facility after being permitted to leave for any reason; \n3. Whenever there is reasonable suspicion that an inmate is carrying contraband; \n4. Before placement of an inmate into: \ni. Prehearing Detention; \nii. Disciplinary Detention; \niii. Protective Custody. \n5. Before placement of an inmate under a psychological observation or suicide watch; \n6. Whenever the person admitted for a minor offense(s) is known to have a history of \nviolent or assaultive conduct or a previous conviction(s) for a crime(s); and \n7. After a contact visit. \nId. According to Defendant, the searches performed at the Burlington Jail were \nconducted pursuant to Section 1 of that Code. (Def. Burlington Br. at 14.) This section \nfacially permits the strip searches of newly admitted persons, thereby lending support to \nDefendant's argument. Reading further though, Section (b)(3) permits strip searches \nwhen \"reasonable suspicion\" of contraband is present. Additionally, Section (b)(6) \npermits strip searches of persons admitted on the basis of \"minor offenses\" who have a \ncriminal history. Recognizing that the broadly-phrased Section (b)(1) counter-intuitively \nswallows these sections of the statute, Sections (b)(3) and (b)(6) still call for individual \n\ndiscretion rather than the blanket policy implemented here. There mere fact that there is \nambiguity or inconsistency in this regulation does not change the fact that the law on \nthis issue was clearly established on this issue as of 1987. \n518*518 Furthermore, there is great similarity between Section (b)(1) of the present \nCode, and the portion of the Code held unconstitutional in Davis. See Davis, supra, at \n398 n. 2 (\"All newly admitted inmates shall be thoroughly searched. Each newly \nadmitted inmate shall be strip searched for weapons and contraband.\") (quoting N.J. \nADMIN. CODE 10A:31-3.12(2) (1979)). Such similarity between these broadly phrased \nsections ought to have put Warden Cole on notice that the policy implemented at \nBurlington Jail was unconstitutional. \nDefendant cites the recent case of, Smart v. Taylor, 2008 WL 755904 (D.N.J. March 19, \n2008), to support his contention for qualified immunity. In that case, the Court found a \nconstitutional violation when the plaintiff was strip searched immediately before a court \nhearing, and then immediately after the same hearing. Id. at *5. Despite the violation, \nthe Warden and the C.C.C.F. Officer who conducted the search were entitled to \nqualified immunity because the search was conducted pursuant N.J. ADMIN. CODE \n10A:31-8.5. Id. at *6. The Court stated, \"This regulation on its face does not appear to \nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\" Id. Even though this is the same general regulation \nupon which Defendant in this case relies, the defendants in that case relied on a \ndifferent section. Moreover, the facts are inapposite to the present case. As a result, \nDefendant finds no refuge in Smart v. Taylor. Defendant Warden Cole is not entitled to \nqualified immunity. The claim is denied. \n6. Arrest Claim \nFinally, Defendant Essex generally claims that \"the arrest claim was invalid.\" (Def.'s \nEssex Br. at 35.) Essex states that \"the plaintiff has provided no evidence that there \nwas a custom or policy of making improper arrests by the Essex County Sheriff's Office \nor the County of Essex. Without such factual contentions any claim against the County \nof Essex must be dismissed.\" (Id.) Defendants do not cite a particular Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure to advance this claim, although they style it as a motion to dismiss. \nThus, it is evident that Defendant seeks dismissal on Count 5 of Plaintiff's First \nAmendment Complaint. There, Plaintiffs allege \"§ 1983 Municipality Custom Violations.\" \n(Am. Compl., ¶¶ 80-88.) Plaintiffs' Opposition Brief contains no response to this claim \nby Essex. \nWhen analyzing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(6), the Court must accept as true Plaintiffs' factual allegations in the complaint. \nSee Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir.2008). Any inferences \nfrom the factual allegations are considered in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. Id. \nIt is not required that the plaintiff plead evidence. See Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 \nF.2d 434, 446 (3d Cir.1977). The plaintiff is required, however, to plead \"enough facts to \nstate a claim that is plausible on its face.\" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n\n___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \nHere, the relevant allegations from Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint state: \n81. Defendants Burlington County Jail, Burlington County Board of Chosen \nFreeholders, Essex County Correctional Facility and Essex County Sherriff's \nDepartment and Warden Juel Cole maintained a municipal policy or custom of detaining \npersons without promptly verifying if a proper warrant for arrest existed nor promptly \ndoing anything to insure a person's liberty is not impeded by being falsely arrested. \n519*519 82. Those practices of the Defendants, who are government entities, are so \npermanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law. \n84. Defendants had contemporaneous knowledge of the offending incident or \nknowledge of a prior pattern of similar incidents and circumstances. \n85. Defendants failed to train, discipline or control its personnel ... \n86. Defendants actions or inactions communicates a message of approval to the \noffending subordinate Defendants John Does 1-8. \n88. Defendants failure to provide adequate training and supervision to its police officers \nand employees constitutes a willful and wanton indifference and deliberate disregard for \nhuman life and the rights of private citizens, including Plaintiff. \n(Am. Compl. ¶¶ 81-88.) \nAlthough Defendant is correct that Plaintiff has \"provided no evidence\" that it was the \npolicy or custom of Essex to engage in the alleged wrongful conduct, evidence is not \nrequired at this time. See Bogosian, 561 F.2d at 434. Indeed, \"complaints alleging \nmunicipal liability under § 1983\" are not subject to heightened pleading standards. See \nLeatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, et al., 507 \nU.S. 163, 168, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993) (contrasting pleading \nrequirements for allegations of municipal liability under § 1983 with that of \"fraud or \nmistake\"). The factual allegations cited above sufficiently comply with the pleading \nrequirements of the Federal Rules. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a). Therefore, Defendants' \nmotion to dismiss is denied. Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to advance their \nclaim. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is granted, and \nDefendants' cross-motion for summary judgment is denied. Plaintiffs' request for \npreliminary injunctive relief is denied. Defendants Board of Chosen Freeholders of \nBurlington County, Warden Cole in his official capacity, and Burlington County Jail did \nnot sustain their burden on a claim for Eleventh Amendment immunity. Therefore, this \nclaim is denied without prejudice. Warden Cole's claim for qualified immunity in his \nindividual capacity is denied. Finally, Defendant's motion to dismiss the arrest claim is \ndenied. Plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to withstand Defendant's challenge. It is \n\nso ordered. \n[1] For whatever reason, there are two Count Fives in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The `Count \nFive' referred to in this Opinion should actually be Count Seven, if properly labeled in the First Amended \nComplaint. (Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 80-88.) For purposes of consistency, however, it remains as labeled— \n`Count Five.' \n[2] While not binding on this Court, it is helpful to note that New Jersey law defines a strip search as \"the \nremoval or rearrangement of clothing for the purpose of visual inspection of the person's undergarments, \nbuttocks, anus, genitals or breasts.\" N.J. STAT. ANN. § 2A:161A-3. \n[3] New Jersey law provides no right to indictment by a grand jury for offenses other than crimes. See \nN.J. STAT. ANN. § 2C:1-4(b). Such offenses are aptly dubbed \"non-indictable.\" \n[4] Order No. 89-17 and Directive No. 04-06 were attached as \"Exhibit D\" to an August 2, 2007 \ncertification made by Michael Calabro, co-counsel for Plaintiff. These submissions were initially provided \nby Defendant Essex as part of their discovery response. (Pl. Br. at 12.) The Court cites Order No. 89-17 \nas Exhibit D(1) and Directive No. 04-06 as Exhibit D(2). \n[5] In their brief, Plaintiffs also passingly ask this Court for counsel fees. (See Pl. Br. at 2 (\"Plaintiff \nrequests counsel fees.\")) This Court notes that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b), a \"prevailing party\" in a \n§ 1983 action is entitled to \"reasonable\" counsel fees. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 \nS.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Yet, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(h), a request \nfor counsel or attorney's fees must be made by motion and \"must be filed no later than 14 days after the \nentry of judgment.\" See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2)(A)(B). As such, Plaintiffs' request shall not be addressed at \nthis time. \n[6] While eight circuits have addressed the issue at bar, the Third Circuit has yet to provide this Court with \ncontrolling authority. \n[7] As stated above, Order No. 89-17 was superceded by Directive No. 04-06 in April 2005, which facially \nprohibits the strip searching of non-indictable arrestees in the absence of reasonable suspicion of \nweapons, drugs, or contraband. (Calabro Cert., 8/2/2007, Ex. D(1), p. 3, § VII.c.8.) For discussion of the \nrelevance of Directive No. 04-06, see infra Part III.3. \n[8] Monell v. New York City Dept. Of Soc. Services holds that \"local governing bodies ... can be sued \ndirectly under § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where... the action that is alleged to be \nunconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially \nadopted and promulgated by that body's officers.\" See 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 \n(1978). \n[9] The Fourth Amendment provides:  \nThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probably cause, \nsupported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or \nthings to be seized. \nU.S. CONST amend. IV. \n[10] Inmates at the prison facilities were required to expose their body cavities for visual inspection as \npart of a strip search performed after each contact visit with a person from outside the facility. Bell, 441 \nU.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. 1861. The jail administrators justified the practice on the bases of discovery and \n\ndeterrence of \"weapons, drugs, and other contraband.\" Id. \n[11] Specifically, the plaintiff in Davis was told to remove all of her clothes and squat, so the female jail \nmatron could conduct a visual inspection of her orifices. Davis, supra, at 398. \n[12] That Administrative Code provision provided in relevant part:  \nAll newly admitted inmates shall be thoroughly searched. Each newly admitted inmate shall be strip \nsearched for weapons and contraband. This search also shall include a check for body vermin, cuts, \nbruises, needle scars, and other injuries. \nN.J. ADMIN. CODE 10A:31-3.12(2) (1979). \n[13] Judge Cohen opined:  \nAs this court sees it, a blanket policy covering only persons charged with felonies or with misdemeanors \ninvolving weapons or contraband arguably is justifiable because it is based on a reasonable \ngeneralization: that persons charged with these offenses are likely to be concealing weapons or \ncontraband. Although such a blanket policy, by its very nature, may encompass some individual arrestees\nwith respect to whom reasonable suspicion to search will not exist, such searches will nonetheless be \nupheld because the policy is deemed to be constitutionally justified. However, when an arrestee charged \nwith a felony or a misdemeanor involving weapons or contraband is strip searched pursuant to a policy \nencompassing all arrestees, regardless of the nature of their offenses, and where it is conceded that no \nsuspicion regarding the particular arrestee existed, the requisite justification for the search is lacking; \nneither the general policy nor its particular application is supportable. \nId. \n[14] Defendants do not cite Stanley in their briefs, but it is relevant to the instant matter. \n[15] The strip search in that case \"involved inspection of the naked body, including the arrestee's breasts, \nbuttocks, and genitalia.\" Bull, supra, at 1195. \n[16] The booking procedures at issue in Powell are somewhat similar to the ones in the present case. For \nexample, in that case, the inmates also took a group shower while being observed by jail officials. Powell,\n541 F.3d at 1301. The major difference is the number; whereas here, Essex County compelled showers \nof up to three inmates at a time, in Powell, up to forty inmates showered together in a large room. Id. \n[17] See, e.g., Masters v. Crouch, 872 F.2d 1248, 1255 (6th Cir.1989); Stewart v. Lubbock County, Tex., \n767 F.2d 153, 156-57 (5th Cir. 1985); Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984); overruled on \nother grounds by Hodgers-Durgin v. de la Vina, 199 F.3d 1037, 1041 n. 1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc); Mary \nBeth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1272 (7th Cir. 1983). This District makes a similar distinction \nbetween indictable and non-indictable offenses. See, e.g., Ernst, 739 F.Supp. at 225. \n[18] Notably, for thirty years the Supreme Court has not found a need to readdress this issue, even in the \nface of eight circuits requiring reasonable suspicion to strip search incoming prisoners or detainees. See \nsupra, p. 506 of this Opinion. While \"the denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion \nupon the merits of the case,\" see Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 85, 115 S.Ct. 2038, 132 L.Ed.2d 63 \n(1995) (emphasis added), the denial of many a writ over an extended period of time speaks, at minimum, \nto a lack of urgency to address these holdings. \n[19] M.R.S.A., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus, also known as staph infection, \"is a strain of staph \nthat is resistant to the broad spectrum antibiotics currently used to treat it.\" (Def.'s Burlington Br., p. 9.) \n\nAccording to statistics from the Kaiser Foundation in 2007, out of 1.2 million hospital patients diagnosed \nwith the infection, the rate of fatality was between four and ten percent. (Id. at n. 7) \n[20] Defendants also rely on a case called Gerber v. City of Burlington, et. al., Civ. No. 95-3043. \nDefendants contend that the district court there upheld a search procedure similar to the one here. (Def. \nBr. p. 4.) For whatever reason, however, an opinion in that case does not exist. Plaintiffs' counsel certifies \nthat the case resulted in \"a summary order disposing of a defendant that resulted not on the merits but \nbecause opposition was never filed.\" (Pl. Opp'n Br. p. 2.) Plaintiff subsequently contends that Defendants' \nreliance on the case is \"patently false\" and done in \"bad faith\". Plaintiff asks for an Order of Contempt, \nalong with reasonable expenses and attorney's fees \"incurred as a result of their false filing\", pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(g). While Defendants' apparent reliance on a non-existent case is \ntroublesome, this request must be denied. Defendants' submitted affidavits, (see Aff. of Def. Counsel, \nfiled September 25, 2008), coupled with the statements on the record during oral argument, (see Oral \nArg. Tr. at 40:15-25, 41:1-17, Nov. 10, 2008), sufficiently show that Defendants' reliance was not done in \nbad faith. \n[21] Defendants may wish to supplement the record and raise this issue at a later date. See Blake v. \nKline, 612 F.2d 718, 726 (3d Cir. 1979). \n \n  \nAbout Google Scholar - All About Google - My Citations \n©2012 Google \n \n ",

Although the question is\none of first im pression for this Court, the Suprem e Court’s\n5\n\ndecision in Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), and the many\ncases that followed it inform our analysis.\nInBell, the Supreme Court rejected a Fourth Amendment\nchallenge to a policy of visual body cavity searches for all\ndetainees—regardless  of the reason for their\nincarceration—after contact visits with outsiders.   Id. at 560.\nThe Court applied a balancing test and concluded that the visual\nbody cavity searches were reasonable because the prison’s\nsecurity  interest justified the intrusion into the detainees’\nprivacy.\nSince Bell was decided, ten circuit courts of appeals\napplied its balancing test and uniform ly concluded that an\narrestee charged with minor offenses may not be strip searched\nconsistent with the Fourth Am endment unless the prison has\nreasonable suspicion that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or\nother contraband.  Things changed in 2008, however, when the\nen banc Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed its\nprior precedent and held that a jail’s blanket policy of strip\nsearching all arrestees upon entering the facility was reasonable\neven in the absence of individualized suspicion.   Powell v.\nBarrett, 541 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  A year\nlater, the en banc Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also\nreversed its prior precedent and upheld a blanket policy of strip\nsearching all arrestees before they enter San Francisco’s general\njail population. Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 595\nF.3d 964, 975 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc).\nConfronted with a clear dichotomy between the en banc\ndecisions of the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits on the one hand\n6\n\nand the numerous cases that preceded them  on the other, we\nmust determine which line of cases is more faithful to the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Bell.\nI.\nA.\nWe  begin with the facts surrounding the arrest and\ndetention of lead Plaintiff Albert Florence.  On March 3, 2005,\na New Jersey state trooper stopped the car in which Florence\nwas a passenger and arrested him based on an April 25, 2003\nbench  warrant from   Essex County.  The warrant charged\nFlorence with a non-indictable variety of civil contempt. Though\nFlorence protested the validity of the warrant by insisting he had\nalready paid the fine on which it was based, he was arrested and\ntaken to the Burlington County Jail (BCJ).\nAccording to Florence, he was subjected to a strip and\nvisual  body-cavity search by corrections officers at BCJ.\nDuring  the jail’s intake process, Florence was directed to\nremove all of his clothing, then open his m outh and lift his\ntongue, hold out his arms and turn around, and lift his genitals.\nThe officer conducting the searchs at approximately arms-length\nin front of him, and directed Florence to shower once the search\nwas complete.  Florence was held at BCJ for six days.\nDuring Florence’s sixth day at BCJ, the Essex County\nSheriff’s Department took custody of him and transported him\nto the Essex County Correctional Facility (ECCF).  Florence\nalleges  that he was subjected to another strip and visual\n7\n\nbody-cavity search upon his arrival at ECCF.  As described by\nFlorence, he and four other detainees were instructed to enter\nseparate  shower stalls, strip naked and shower under the\nwatchful eyes of two corrections officers.  After showering,\nFlorence was directed to open his m outh and lift his genitals.\nNext, he was ordered to turn around so he faced away from the\nofficers and to squat and cough.  After donning ECCF-issued\nclothing and visiting a nurse, Florence joined the general jail\npopulation until the following day, when the charges against\nhim were dismissed.\nAfter his release, Florence sued BCJ, ECCF, and various\nindividuals and municipal entities (collectively, the Jails) under\n42  U.S.C. § 1983.  While Florence asserted num erous\nconstitutional claims, the only claim germane to this appeal is\nhis Fourth Amendment challenge to the strip search procedures\nat BCJ and ECCF.\nB.\nOn March 20, 2008, the District Court granted Florence’s\nmotion for class certification, defining the plaintiff class as:\nAll arrestees charged with non-indictable offenses\nwho  were processed, housed or held over at\nDefendant  Burlington County Jail and/or\nDefendant  Essex County Correctional Facility\nfrom March 3, 2003 to the present date who were\ndirected by Defendants’ officers to strip naked\nbefore those officers, no m atter if the officers\nterm  that procedure a “visual observation” or\n8\n\notherwise, without the officers first articulating a\nreasonable  belief that those arrestees were\nconcealing contraband, drugs or weapons[.]\nFlorence  v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, 2008 WL 800970, at *17 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008).1\nFollowing discovery, the parties filed cross motions for\nsummary judgment.  In reviewing the m otions, the District\nCourt first considered whether the intake procedures at each\nfacility rose to the level of a “strip search.” Florence v. Bd. of\nChosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, 595 F. Supp.\n2d 492, 502 (D.N.J. 2009).  To resolve this question, the District\nCourt reviewed the Jails’ written search policies2 as well as the\n1 Florence sought class certification only on his strip\nsearch claims; he did not seek certification on his claim that he\nwas subjected to a visual body cavity search. F lorence v. Bd. of\nChosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington , 2008 WL\n800970, at *8 n.5 (D.N.J. Mar. 20, 2008).\n2 BCJ’s written policy defined a strip search as “[a]\nphysical search of an inm ate by the sam e sex officer while\nunclothed  consisting of routine and system atic  visual\nobservation  of the inm ate’s  physical body to look for\ndistinguished identifying marks, scars or deformities, signs of\nillness, injury or disease and/or the concealment of contraband\non  the inm ate’s  body.”   Burlington  County Detention\nCenter/Corrections  & Work Release Center Policies and\nProcedures: Search of Inmates - No. Section 1186, Supp. App.\nat 42. \n9\n\ndeposition testimony of  correctional officers and the wardens\nat each facility.  Ultimately, the District Court concluded that,\nwhile  there were facts in dispute—such as whether non-\nindictable male arrestees at BCJ were required to lift their\ngenitals during the se arch—these disputes were im material\nbecause even the undisputed procedures of instructing arrestees\nto remove all of their clothing and subject their naked bodies to\nvisual inspection “rose to the level of a strip search” under the\nFourth Amendment.  Id. at 502-03 (“Whatever the case may be,\na discrepancy of this sort does not necessarily provide a genuine\nissue of material fact. . . . ‘It’s just common sense.  Take off all\nyour clothes.  You’re strip[]  searched.’” (quoting Plaintiffs’\ncounsel)).\nThe policy in effect at ECCF from  September 2002\nthrough April 2005 provided that all arrestees were to be strip\nsearched and required to shower. Department of Public Safety\nGeneral Order No. 89-17 , Supp. App. 34.  A “strip search”\nunder the written policy is to consist of an officer “observ[ing]\ncarefully  while the inm ate  undresses” and exam ining  the\narrestee’s ears, nose, hair and scalp, the interior of the m outh,\nfingers, hands, arms and armpits, and all body openings and the\ninner thighs.  Id.  The superceding ECCF policy,D  epartment of\nCorrections Administrative Directive No. 04-06, requires that\nofficers “conduct a thorough search of individual inm ates,”\ndirect arrestees to shower during intake, and “observe and\ndocument, in writing, any evidence of: a) notable body amrkings\nsuch as ‘tattoos;’ b) [b]ody vermin or disease; [and] c) [o]pen\nsores, visible wounds, scars, [or]  injuries” on the  arrestees’\nbodies.  Supp. App. at 40.\n10\n\nThe  District Court found that BCJ’s “blanket” strip\nsearch policy “entails a com plete disrobing, followed by an\nexamination of the nude inmate for bruises, marks, wounds or\nother distinguishing features by the supervising officer, which\nis then followed by a supervised shower with a delousing\nagent.” Id. at 502.  The Court found that ECCF utilized similar\nstrip-search and supervised-shower procedures; however, the\nECCF procedures were slightly more intrusive because “Essex\nofficers carefully observed the entire naked body of the inmate,\nincluding body openings and inner thighs.” I d. at 503.3  Having\nthus defined the Jails’ respective search policies, the District\nCourt concluded that the procedures failed the  Bell balancing\ntest and observed that “blanket strip searches of non-indictable\noffenders, performed without reasonable suspicion for drugs,\nweapons, or other contraband, [ are] unconstitutional.”  Id. at\n513.  Based on this holding, the District Court granted the\nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on the unlawful search\nclaim,  but denied the Plaintiffs’ request for a prelim inary\ninjunction.  Id.  at 519.  The Court denied Defendants’ cross-\nmotion  which sought qualified and Eleventh Am endment\nimmunity.  Id.\nFollowing the decision, the Jails moved the District Court\nto certify its summary judgment as an appealable order pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).  The District Court agreed that the order\n“involve[d] a controlling question of law as to which there is\nsubstantial  ground for difference of opinion,”   id.,  and we\n3 The Jails do not challenge the District Court’s factual\nfindings regarding the scope of the strip search policies.  Rather,\nthey assert that such searches are permissible under Bell.\n11\n\ngranted permission to appeal.  The District Court certified the\nfollowing question for our review: “whether a blanket policy of\nstrip searching all non-indictable arrestees adm itted to a jail\nfacility without first articulating reasonable suspicion violates\nthe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution as\napplied to the States through the Fourteenth Am endment.”\nFlorence  v. Bd of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, 657 F. Supp. 2d 504, 511 (D.N.J. 2009) (order\ncertifying issue for appeal).  “In reviewing an interlocutory\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), this court exercises plenary\nreview over the question certified.”   Morris v. Rumsfeld, 420\nF.3d 287, 290 (3d Cir. 2005).\nII.\nThe  Fourth Am endment  protects “[t] he  right of the\npeople to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures.”  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  To enforce this\nguarantee,  government  officials are lim ited  to only those\nsearches which are reasonable.  Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S.\n648,  653-54 (1979).  Reasonableness under the Fourth\nAmendment is a flexible standard, Bodine v. Warwick, 72 F.3d\n393, 398 (3d Cir. 1995), “not capable of precise definition or\nmechanical application,” Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  “In each case it\nrequires a balancing of the need for the particular search against\nthe invasion of personal rights that the search entails.” Id.\nDetention in a correctional facility “carries with it the\ncircumscription or loss of many significant rights.”  Hudson v.\nPalmer, 468 U.S. 517, 524 (1984).  “The curtailment of certain\nrights is necessary, as a practical m atter, to accommodate a\n12\n\nmyriad of institutional needs and objectives of prison facilities,\nchief among which is internal security.”  Id. (internal quotation\nmarks  and citations om itted).   Because privacy is greatly\ncurtailed by the nature of the prison environment, a detainee’s\nFourth Amendment rights are likewise diminished.  See id. at\n526 (holding that “the Fourth Amendment proscription against\nunreasonable searches does not apply within the confines of the\nprison cell”); Bell, 441 U.S. at 537 (“Loss of freedom of choice\nand privacy are inherent incidents of confinem ent in such a\nfacility.”).\nWhile  the Suprem e  Court has “repeatedly held that\nprisons are not beyond the reach of the Constitution[,”] Hudson,\n468 U.S. at 523, it has also emphasized that the judiciary has a\n“very limited role” in the administration of detention facilities,\nBlock  v. Rutherford ,  468 U.S. 576, 584 (1984).  Indeed,\ndetention facilities have been described as “unique place[s]\nfraught with serious security dangers,”B  ell, 441 U.S. at 559, the\nmanagement of which “courts are ill equipped to deal with,”i d.\nat 548 n.30.  Therefore, authorities are entitled to considerable\nlatitude in designing and im plementing prison management\npolicies.  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407-08 (1989).\nAs  the Suprem e  Court cautioned in  Bell:   “[p] rison\nadministrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference\nin the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in\ntheir  judgment  are nee ded  to preserve internal order and\ndiscipline and to maintain institutional security.”  441 U.S. at\n547.   In addition to prison adm inistrators’  “professional\nexpertise,”  separation of powers and federalism concerns\nsupport “wide-ranging deference” to the decisions of prison\nauthorities.  Id. at 548 (“[J]udicial deference is accorded not\n13\n\nmerely because the administrator ordinarily will, as a matter of\nfact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his domain than\nthe reviewing judge, but also because the operation of our\ncorrectional  facilities is peculiarly the province of the\nLegislative and Executive branches of our Government, not the\nJudicial.”); Turner  v. Safley ,  482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987)\n(“[S]eparation of powers concerns counsel a policy of judicial\nrestraint. Where a state penal system is involved, federal courts\nhave . . . additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate\nprison authorities.”).\nA.\nHaving explained the general standards that govern our\ninquiry, we turn to the Supreme Court’s pathmarking decision\nin Bell  v. Wolfish .   Although there are factual differences\nbetween Bell and the instant case, they are sufficiently similar\nto warrant a detailed review of Bell.\nIn Bell,  pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners\nconfined at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC)—a\nfederally  operated short-term   custodial facility—filed suit\nchallenging  numerous  prison practices and conditions of\nconfinement.   441 U.S. a t 523-24.  Although the prim ary\npurpose of MCC was to house pretrial detainees awaiting trial\non federal criminal charges, the facility also housed: witnesses\nin protective custody, contemnors,  inmates awaiting sentencing\nor transportation to federal prison,  inm ates serving relatively\nshort sentences, and inm ates lodged under writs of habeas\ncorpus issued to ensure their presence at trial.  Id. at 524.  The\npopulation at MCC was quite transient, with 50% of its inmates\n14\n\nspending fewer than 30 days at the facility and 73% of the\npopulation spending fewer than 60 days at MCC. I d. at 524 n.3.\nAmong the conditions of confinement challenged by the\ninmates at MCC was the policy of strip and visual body-cavity\nsearches after  contact visits with outsiders.  Under that policy,\nall persons housed at MCC—regardless of the reason for their\ndetention—were “required to expose their body cavities for\nvisual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every\ncontact visit with a person from outside the institution.”  Id. at\n558.   For m ales,  this required “lift[ ing]  [the]  genitals and\nbend[ing] over to spread [the] buttocks for visual inspection.”\nId. at 558 n.39.  “The vaginal and anal cavities of fem ale\ninmates also [were] visually inspected.”  Id.  Inmates were not\ntouched by officers during the searches. Id.\nThe district court in  Bell upheld the strip searches but\nheld the visual body cavity searches unreasonable under the\nFourth Amendment.  Id. at 558.  The Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit affirmed, finding that the “gross violation of\npersonal privacy inherent in such a search cannot be outweighed\nby the government’s security interest in maintaining a practice\nof  so little actual utility.”    Id.  (internal quotation m arks\nomitted).\nThe Supreme Court reversed, holding that the visual\nbody-cavity  searches were reasonable under the Fourth\nAmendment.  Id.  As a preliminary matter, the Court assumed\nwithout deciding that both convicted prisoners and pretrial\ndetainees  retain som e  Fourth Am endment  rights upon\ncommitment to a correctional facility. I d.  It then explained that,\n15\n\nin each case, the test of Fourth Am endment reasonableness\nrequires “a balancing of the need for the particular search\nagainst the invasion of personal rights that the search entails,”\nand  instructed courts to consider four factors in assessing\nreasonableness:  “the scope of the particular intrusion, the\nmanner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating\nit, and the place in which it is conducted.”  Id. at 559.\nIn applying the balancing test to the search policy, the\nSupreme Court cited MCC’s dual objectives of detecting and\ndeterring  smuggling  of we apons  and other contraband,\nrecognizing that “[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and\nother contraband is all too common an occurrence.”  Id.  The\nCourt upheld the policy despite the absence of any evidence of\nsmuggling problems at MCC as the record contained only one\ninstance where an  inmate was caught with contraband in a body\ncavity. Id.  Nevertheless, the Court found the lack of evidence\nsupported the prison’s interest in the policy because it was\n“more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique\nas a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of inmates\nto secrete and import such items when the opportunity arises.”\nId.\nSignificantly,Bellincluded just one sentence discussing\nthe scope of the privacy intrusion, in which the Court stated that\nit “d[id] not underestimate the degree to which these searches\nmay invade the personal privacy of inmates.”  Id. at 560.  And\nthough  it acknowledged that correctional officers m ay\nsometimes conduct the searches in an impermissibly abusive\nfashion, the Supreme Court did not address that issue; rather, it\nlimited its review to the policy as a whole, “deal[ing] . . . with\n16\n\nthe  question whether visual body-cavity inspections as\ncontemplated by the MCC rules can ever be conducted on less\nthan probable cause grounds.”   Id.  The Court answered that\nquestion in the affirmative.  Moreover, the Court re jected the\ndistrict court’s consideration of alternative, less-intrusive means\nof detecting contraband.  Even assuming the availability of such\nalternatives, the Court deferred to MCC’s choice of security\nprocedure because it had not been shown to be “irrational or\nunreasonable.” Id. at 559 n.40.\nB.\nIn the years following Bell, ten circuit courts of appeals\napplied the Supreme Court’s balancing test to strip searches of\nindividuals arrested for minor offenses and found the searches\nunconstitutional where not supported by reasonable suspicion\nthat  the arrestee was hiding a weapon or contraband. 4    In\n4 See Wilson v. Jones, 251 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.\n2001)  (blanket policy of strip searches upon intake to jail\nunreasonable when applied to DUI arrestee absent reasonable\nsuspicion);Roberts v.

City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263,\n1273 (7th Cir. 1983) (strip search of fema le arrestees charged\nwith minor offenses were unreasonable “without a reasonable\nsuspicion by the authorities that either of the twin dangers of\nconcealing weapons or contraband existed”); Logan v. Shealy,\n660 F.2d 1007, 1013 (4th Cir. 1981) (“An indiscriminate strip\n18\n\ngeneral, these courts concluded that the extrem e invasion of\nprivacy caused by a strip and/or visual body-cavity search\noutweighed  the prison’s m inimal  interest in searching an\nindividual charged with a minor crime shortly after arrest.  See,\ne.g., Giles v. Ackerman, 746 F.2d 614, 617 (9th Cir. 1984);\nMary Beth G. v. City of Chicago, 723 F.2d 1263, 1273 (7th Cir.\n1983).  The critical factor in balancing the competing interests\nwas  the belief that individuals arrested for m inor  offenses\npresented a relatively slight security risk because they usually\nare arrested unexpectedly whereas the contact visits inB ell may\nhave been arranged specifically for the purpose of sm uggling\nweapons or drugs.  See, e.g., Shain v. Ellison, 273 F.3d 56, 64\n(2d Cir. 2001) (“It is far less obvious that misdemeanor arrestees\nfrequently or even occasionally hide contraband in their bodily\norifices.  Unlike persons already in jail who receive contact\nvisits, arrestees do not ordinarily have notice that they are about\nto be arrested and thus an opportunity to hide som ething.”);\nRoberts v. Rhode Island , 239 F.3d 107, 111 (1st Cir. 2001)\n(“[T]he deterrent rationale for the  Bell search is simply less\nrelevant given the essentially unplanned nature of an arrest and\nsubsequent incarceration.”).\nRecently, the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits, sitting en\nbanc,  reversed their prior precedents and held that  Bell\nauthorizes a policy of blanket strip searches for all arrestees\nentering the general population of a jail.  See Powell v. Barrett,\nsearch policy routinely applied to detainees . . . cannot be\nconstitutionally justified simply on the basis of administrative\nease in attending to security considerations.”),c ert. denied, 455\nU.S. 942 (1982).\n19\n\n541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (overruling Wilson v.\nJones, 251 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir. 2001));B  ull v. City and County\nof San Francisco, 595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc)\n(overruling Giles v. Ackerman 746 F.2d 614 (9th Cir. 1984)).\nInPowell, the Eleventh Circuit reviewed a policy of strip\nsearching all arrestees at the time of intake implemented by the\nFulton County Jail in Georgia.  The policy required that all\npersons entering the jail’s general population be strip searched\nregardless of the crime charged and without any individualized\nsuspicion.  Powell, 541 F.3d at 1301. The booking process\nrequired groups of 30 to 40 arrestees to enter a large shower\nroom, simultaneously remove all of their clothing, place it in\nboxes and then shower.   Id.  “After the group shower each\narrestee  either singly, or standing in a line with others, is\nvisually inspected front and back by deputies.  Then each man\ntakes his clothes to a counter and exchanges his own clothes for\na jail jumpsuit.”  Id. (internal quotation marks, brackets, and\ncitations omitted).   The Eleventh Circuit discussed in great\ndetail the facts and circumstances surrounding the searches at\nissue in Bell, which demonstrated the high level of intrusiveness\nthat  the Suprem e  Court countenanced as reasonable.  The\nEleventh Circuit also noted the paltry record of body-cavity\nsmuggling at MCC as evidence of the significant deference\nprovided to prison administrators by the Court in Bell.  In light\nof these points, the Eleventh Circuit determined that most courts\n(and its own prior precedent) m isinterpreted Bell to require\nreasonable suspicion for strip searches of minor offenders.  Id.\nat 1307.  It opined that the decisions requiring reasonable\nsuspicion failed to give appropriate deference to the judgments\nof prison administrators and ignored the fact that in upholding\n20\n\nvisual body-cavity searches, the Supreme Court in Bell neither\nrequired  individualized  suspicion  of sm uggling  nor\ndifferentiated the degree of suspicion required based on the type\nof offender. Id. at 1307-11.\nThe Powell court also disagreed with the majority view\nthat security interests at the tim e of intake are less important\nthan  those arising after an inm ate’s  contact visit with an\noutsider, describing “an inmate’s initial entry into a detention\nfacility” as “coming after one big and prolonged contact visit\nwith the outside world.”  Id. at 1313.  The court asserted that the\n“need for strip searches at all detention facilities, including\ncounty jails, is not exaggerated.”   Id. at 1310.  Citing other\ncases, the court noted the problem of gang violence in prisons\nand observed that gang m embers might “coerce, cajole, or\nintimidate lesser violators into smuggling contraband into the\nfacility.”  Id. at 1311 (cita tion omitted).  In light of these\nsecurity concerns, the Eleventh Circuit held that “a policy or\npractice of strip searching all arrestees as part of the process of\nbooking them into the general population of a detention facility,\neven without reasonable suspicion to believe that they may be\nconcealing contraband, is constitutionally permissible” at least\nwhere the search is no more intrusive than the search inB  ell. Id.\nat 1300.\nLike the Eleventh Circuit in Powell, the Ninth Circuit in\nBull v.  City and County of San Francisco   reversed prior\nprecedent  and upheld the San Francisco Sheriff’s policy\nauthorizing strip searches of all arrestees before they are placed\nin the general population of a county jail. B ull, 595 F.3d at 966.\nIn rejecting its prior requirem ent of reasonable suspicion for\n21\n\narrestee strip searches, the Bullcourt relied on much of the same\nreasoning as the Eleventh Circuit in Powell, including its view\nthat decisions interpreting Bell v. Wolfish to require reasonable\nsuspicion to strip search m inor offenders were analytically\nflawed. Id. at 977-78.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that “the\nscope, manner, and justification for San Francisco’s strip search\npolicy was not meaningfully different from the scope, manner,\nand justification for the strip search policy in Bell.”  Id. at 975.\nBased on the record presented, the justification for searching\narrestees  at the tim e  of intake was even higher than the\njustification for the post-contact visit searches in Bell because\nSan Francisco had amassed a record demonstrating “a pervasive\nand serious problem with contraband inside San Francisco’s\njails” as well as instances of contraband smuggled within body\ncavities. Id.\nC.\nMindful  of the newly-m inted  circuit split we have\ndescribed, we proceed to apply  Bell’s balancing test to the\nquestion certified for interlocutory appeal in this case. 5  The\n5 In Bull, the Ninth Circuit held the constitutionality of a\nprison strip search was governed by Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S.\n78 (1987), in addition to Bell v. Wolfish. Bull, 595 F.3d at 973-\n74.  Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has applied the\nrational-relationship test of  Turner to a Fourth Am endment\nchallenge to prison policies.  While it is arguable that som e\nFourth  Amendment  rights are “inconsistent with proper\nincarceration” and therefore covered by Turner,seeJohnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 510 (2005) (internal quotation marks\n22\n\nJails rely heavily on Powell in support of their argum ent that\nstrip searches satisfy the reasonableness standard ofB  ell.  They\nargue  that the searches serve the valid prison interests of\n“eliminating weapons and drugs from  the jail environm ent,\nserving to mitigate gang violence and preventing disease,” and\nthat  these concerns apply to indictable and non-indictable\narrestees  alike.  On behalf of the Plaintiff class, Florence\ncounters that the District Court properly applied Bell, and that\nwe should adopt the reasonable suspicion requirement applied\nby the majority of our sister circuits.  Florence also challenges\nthe legitimacy of the gang, health, and contraband concerns as\njustifications for the strip search of non-indictable arrestees as\nunsupported  by the record and argues that there are less\nintrusive alternatives to satisfy the Jails’ security interests.\nLike the Supreme Court in Bell, we assume detainees\nmaintain some Fourth Amendment rights against searches of\nomitted), absent an express statement from the Supreme Court\nthat Turner supplanted Bell, we find its framework for the\nanalysis of detainee constitutional claims inapplicable here. S  ee\nHohn v. United States , 524 U.S. 236, 252-53 (1998) (“ Our\ndecisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider\nthem, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts\nabout their continuing vitality.”).  Moreover, the Jails do not\nseek application of  Turner to Plaintiffs’ Fourth Am endment\nclaims.  See Appellants’ Reply Br. at 17 (“Som e courts have\nruled that the Turner case, with its easier standard, has overruled\nBell.  Appellants have not argued that Turner, and the rational\nbasis test, should be the standard before the Court.”).\n23\n\ntheir person upon entry to a detention facility. 6 See Bell, 441\nU.S. at 558; but see Doe v. Delie, 257 F.3d 309, 316 (3d Cir.\n2001) (noting that under  Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517\n(1984), “prisoners do not have a Fourth Am endment right to\nprivacy in their cells”).  To determine whether the strip search\nprocedures at BCJ and ECCF violate the Fourth Am endment,\nwe first consider the scope of the searches at issue.\nWe  have previously recognized that a strip search\nconstitutes a “significant intrusion on an individual’s privacy.”\nUnited States v. Whitted , 541 F.3d 480, 486 (3d Cir. 2008).\nHere, the strip search policies require the arrestees to undress\ncompletely and submit to a  visual observation of their naked\nbodies before taking a supervised shower.  We do not minimize\nthe extreme intrusion on privacy associated with a strip search\nby law enforcement officers; however, the searches at issue here\nare  less intrusive than the visual body-cavity searche s\nconsidered by the Supreme Court in Bell.  In fact, they are closer\nto the strip searches upheld by the lower court in Bell.\nThe searches were also conducted in a sim ilar manner\nand  place as those in  Bell—by  correctional officers at a\ndetention facility.  The policies governing strip searches at BCJ\nrequire that they be conducted “in private . . . under sanitary\nconditions . . . [and] in a professional and dignified m anner.”\nMoreover, the searches are relatively brief, such that between\nthe search and supervised shower, an arrestee is not required to\n6 Other courts of appeals have gone further, holding that\n“the Fourth Amendment does apply to the invasion of bodily\nprivacy in prisons.” See Bull, 595 F.3d at 974-75.\n24\n\nremain naked for more than several minutes.  Because the scope,\nmanner, and place of the searches are similar to or less intrusive\nthan those in  Bell, the only factor on which Plaintiffs could\ndistinguish this case is the Jails’ justification for the searches.\nDetention facilities are “unique place[s]  fraught with\nserious security dangers.”   Bell, 441 U.S. at 559.  We have\nrecognized  that New Jersey jails, like most correctional\nfacilities, face serious problem s caused by the presence of\ngangs. See Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506, 521-22 (3d Cir.\n2002) (upholding New Jersey prison policy of identifying gang\nmembers and transferring core m embers to Security Threat\nGroup Management Unit).  The Jails cite three specific security\ninterests  to justify strip sea rches:  (1) the detection and\ndeterrence of smuggling weapons, drugs or other contraband\ninto the facility, (2) the identification of gang m embers by\nobserving  their tattoos, and (3) the prevention of disease,\nspecifically  Methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus\n(MRSA).   Of these three, the potential for sm uggling  of\nweapons, drugs, and other contraband poses the greatest security\nthreat.\nIt  is self-evident that preventing the introduction of\nweapons and drugs into the prison environment is a legitimate\ninterest of concern for prison administrators.  See Bell, 441 U.S.\nat  540 (“[ T]he  Government  must  be able to take steps to\nmaintain security and order at the institution and make certain\nno weapons or illicit drugs reach detainees.”); see alsoOverton\nv. Bazzetta, 539 U.S. 126, 134 (2003) (“Drug sm uggling and\ndrug use in prison are intractable problems.”) (citing Bell,Block,\nand Hudson); Block, 468 U.S. at 586 (upholding total ban on\n25\n\ncontact  visits as reasonably related to prison interest in\npreventing security concerns including “open[ing] the institution\nto the introduction of drugs, weapons, and other contraband”).\nPrevention of the entry of illegal weapons and drugs is vital to\nthe protection of inmates and prison personnel alike.  See Bell,\n441  U.S. at 547 (“Prison officials m ust  be free to take\nappropriate  action to ensure the safety of inm ates  and\ncorrections personnel . . . .”);  Bull, 595 F.3d at 967 (citing\ninstance in which inmate used razor-blades secreted in rectal\ncavity to attempt suicide); see also E.E.O.C. v. The GEO Group,\nInc., - - - F.3d - - - -, 2010 WL 2991380, at *8 (3d Cir. Aug. 2,\n2010) (“A prison is not a summer camp and prison officials have\nthe  unenviable task of preserving order in difficult\ncircumstances”).\nLike the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nwe conclude that the security interest in preventing smuggling\nat the time of intake is as strong as the interest in preventing\nsmuggling after the contact visits at issue in  Bell.  We reject\nPlaintiffs’  argument  that blanket searches are unreasonable\nbecause jails have little interest in strip searching arrestees\ncharged with non-indictable offenses.  This argument cannot be\nsquared with the facts and law of  Bell.  First, the  Bell court\nexplicitly rejected any distinction in security risk based on the\nreason for detention.  Bell, 441 U.S. at 546 n.28 (“There is no\nbasis for concluding that pretrial detainees pose any lesser\nsecurity risk than convicted inmates.”).  Instead, the security risk\nwas defined by the fact of detention in a correctional facility. 7\n7 For similar reasons, we reject Plaintiffs’ argument that\nthe searches are unreasonable because non-indictable arrestees\n26\n\nSee also, Fuentes v. Wagner, 206 F.3d 335, 347 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(“[I]t is impractical to draw a line between convicted prisoners\nand  pretrial detainees for the purpose of m aintaining  jail\nsecurity.” (citation omitted)).\nSecond,Bell did not require individualized suspicion for\neach inmate searched; it assessed the facial constitutionality of\nthe policy as a whole, as applied to all inmates at MCC.8 Bell,\nhave  greater Fourth Am endment  rights than the pretrial\ndetainees in Bell.  We are not presented with an argument that\nit was improper for the Jails to detain members of the Plaintiff\nclass in the first place; thus we address only the constitutionality\nof the policy as applied to people properly assigned to the Jails\nand entering the general population.  The Bell analysis applies\nequally  to all individuals so assigned—whether they be\nconvicted  inmates,  indicted pretria l  detainees, contem nors,\nmaterial witnesses, or arrestees awaiting preliminary hearings\nbefore a magistrate.\n8 The absence of an individualized suspicion requirement\nin Bell is consistent with the Fourth Am endment doctrine of\nspecial needs searches.  “[T]here are instances when a search\nfurthers a ‘special governmental need’ beyond that of norm al\nlaw enforcement such that the search, although not supported by\nthe typical quantum of individualized suspicion, can nonetheless\nstill  be found c onstitutionally  ‘reasonable.’”   Neumeyer  v.\nBeard, 421 F.3d 210, 214 (3d Cir. 2005) (prison policy of\nrandomly searching visitors’ vehicles was reasonable because\nprivacy intrusion was outweighed by prison’s “special need to\nmaintain the security and safety of the prison”).\n27\n\n441 U.S. at 560 (bypassing concerns regarding a buses during\nparticular searches to uphold policy as a whole, stating: “we deal\nhere with the question whether visual body-cavity inspections as\ncontemplated by the MCC rules can ever be conducted on less\nthan probable cause.  Balancing the significant and legitim ate\nsecurity interests of the institution against the privacy interests\nof the inmates, we conclude that they can.”).  MCC housed\npretrial detainees, convicted inmates, and even non-offenders\nheld as material witnesses, all of whom  were included in the\nplaintiff class. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 524.\nWe also disagree with Plaintiffs’ contention that the risk\nthat non-indictable offenders will sm uggle contraband is low\nbecause  arrest for this category of offenses is often\nunanticipated.   Even assum ing  that m ost  such arrests are\nunanticipated, this is not always  the case.  It is plausible that\nincarcerated persons will induce or recruit others to subject\nthemselves to arrest on non-indictable offenses to sm uggle\nweapons or other contraband into the facility.  This would be\nespecially true if we were to hold that those incarcerated on non-\nindictable offenses are, as a class, not subject to search.  For that\nreason, we agree with the concern expressed by the Eleventh\nCircuit in Powell that gang members would be likely to exploit\nan exception from security procedures for minor offenders. 541\nF.3d at 1311.\nA similar risk was recognized by the Supreme Court in\nBlock v. Rutherford, where the Court upheld a prison policy\ndenying contact visits to pretrial detainees regardless of the\ncrime charged.  468 U.S. 576, 589 (1984).  InB  lock, the district\ncourt  permitted  the denial of contact visits for high risk\n28\n\ndetainees, but required the jail to provide visits for pretrial\ndetainees “concerning whom there is no indication of drug or\nescape propensities.”   Id. at 580 n.2.   The Suprem e Court\nrejected the lower court’s characterization of a blanket ban on\ncontact visits as disproportionate to the risks posed by low level\ndetainees.  In doing so, the Court reasoned that inmates would\nlikely  take advantage of any gap in security: “[i] t  is not\nunreasonable to assume, for instance, that low security risk\ndetainees  would be enlisted to help obtain contraband or\nweapons by their fellow inmates who are denied contact visits.”\nId. at 587.\nIt  is also important to note that the opportunity for\nsmuggling  during the contact visits in  Bell  was low.  As\ndescribed by the district court in that case, “inm ates and their\nvisitors are in full view during the visits and fully clad.  The\nsecreting of objects in rectal or genital areas becom es in this\nsituation an imposing challenge to nerves and agility.”  Wolfish\nv. Levi, 439 F. Supp. 114, 147 (S.D.N.Y. 1977).  Despite these\nobstacles to an inmate obtaining contraband from a visitor and\nhiding it in a body cavity, the Suprem e Court still found that\nMCC’s interest in detecting and deterring this low risk of\nsmuggling outweighed the privacy intrusion.  If it is reasonable\nto assume that a prisoner will try to arrange for a  visitor to\ndeliver contraband during a contact visit, it is equally reasonable\nto assume that a detainee will arrange for an accomplice on the\noutside to subject himself to arrest for a non-indictable offense\nto smuggle contraband into the facility.  Thus, the Jails’ interest\nin preventing smuggling at the time of intake is just as high as\nMCC’s interest after the contact visits in Bell.\n29\n\nThe Plaintiff class argues that the Jails cannot rely on an\ninterest  in preventing sm uggling  because they have not\npresented any evidence of a past sm uggling problem or any\ninstance  of a non-indictable arre stee  attempting  to secrete\ncontraband.  It is true that the Jails’ justifications for strip\nsearches would be stronger if supported by evidence regarding\ndiscovery  of contraband on indictable and non-indictable\noffenders during intake, and the incidence with which gang\nmembers are arrested for non-indictable offenses.   See, e.g.,\nBull, 595 F.3d at 975.  Nonetheless, our interpretation of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Bell leads us to conclude that the\nJails are not required to produce such a record.\nIn Bell, the single instance of attempted smuggling did\nnot undermine MCC’s justification for the search.  Quite to the\ncontrary, the Court considered the absence of a record to be\nevidence of the policy’s successful deterrent effect.   Bell, 441\nU.S. at 559.  Likewise here, strip searches at the time of intake\nalso have significant deterrent value.  If non-indictable offenders\nwere not subject to automatic search it would create a security\ngap which offenders could exploit with relative ease.\nThe Bell court did not require a record of smuggling to\njustify MCC’s interest in preventing it (in fact, there was no\ntime for a long history of smuggling to have developed as the\nBell plaintiffs filed their case only four m onths after MCC\nopened). Id.  at 526.  The Suprem e  Court declared that\n“[s]muggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband\nis all too common an occurrence” at detention facilities.  Id. at\n559.  In addition to the sole instance of smuggling in the record,\nBell relied upon cases concerning other detention facilities for\n30\n\nthe proposition that inmates attempt to secrete items in their\nbody cavities.  See id. (citing Ferraro v. United States, 590 F.2d\n335 (6th Cir. 1978), and United States v. Park, 521 F.2d 1381,\n1382 (9th Cir. 1975)).\nFinally, we also find significant that the Supreme Court\nrepeatedly has emphasized that courts must defer to the policy\njudgments of prison administrators.  See, e.g., Bell, 441 U.S. at\n531 (repeating “admonition” from Procunier v. Martinez, 416\nU.S. 396, 405 (1974), that “courts are ill equipped to deal with\nthe increasingly urgent problems of prison administration,” and\ntherefore “it would ‘not be wise for [a court of appeals]  to\nsecond-guess the expert administrators on matters on which they\nare better informed.’” (internal brackets om itted)); Cutter v.\nWilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 725 n.13 (2005) (“It bears repetition,\nhowever, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and\nthat deference is due to institutional officials’ expertise in this\narea.”).  Moreover, we have stated that “deference is especially\nappropriate  when a regulation im plicates  prison security.”\nFraise, 283 F.3d at 516;  see also Overton, 539 U.S. at 133\n(internal security is “perhaps the most legitimate of penological\ngoals”).   This em phasis  on deference further supports the\nproposition that the absence of evidence of sm uggling at a\nparticular  correctional institution does not dem onstrate  the\nunreasonableness of a policy implemented to prevent smuggling.\nA  detention facility need not suffer a pattern of security\nbreaches before it takes steps to prevent them where those steps\nare neither “irrational [n]or unreasonable.”  See Bell, 441 U.S.\nat 559 n.40; E.E.O.C., - - - F.3d at - - - - , 2010 WL 2991380, at\n*8.\n31\n\nPlaintiffs  assert that the Jails’ interest in preventing\nsmuggling could be achieved through means less intrusive than\nstrip searches.  Specifically, Plaintiffs point to the Body Orifice\nScanning System (BOSS Chair), “[a]  non-intrusive scanning\nsystem designed to detect small weapons or contraband metal\nobjects concealed in oral, anal, or vaginal cavities,”  a security\nmethod already used by ECCF.  In  Bell, the Supreme Court\nrejected the district court’s reliance on the less-intrusive means\nof metal detection in evaluating searches at MCC.   Id.  The\nCourt found metal detection to be less effective than the visual\nsearch procedure and deferred to the prison adm inistrator’s\ndecision to use the visual search method.  Florence’s argument\nregarding the BOSS Chair fails for the sam e reasons.  Aside\nfrom the fact that there is no evidence regarding the efficacy of\nthe BOSS Chair in detecting metallic objects, it would not detect\ndrugs and other non-m etallic contraband.  Accordingly, the\ndecision not to rely exclusively on the BOSS Chair is not\nunreasonable.\nAs asserted by the Jails, a blanket policy will help to\navoid potential equal protection concerns in the strip search\nprocess as it rem oves officer discretion in selecting which\narrestees to search.  The potential for abuse in a “reasonable\nsuspicion”  scheme  is high, particularly where reasonable\nsuspicion may be based on such subjective characteristics as the\narrestee’s appearance and conduct at the tim e of arrest.   See,\ne.g.,  Hartline v. Gallo ,  546 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2008)\n(reasonable suspicion to strip search a m isdemeanor arrestee\nmay  be “based on the crim e  charged, the particular\ncharacteristics of the arrestee, and/or the circumstances of the\narrest”  (internal quotations and citation om itted)); see also\n32\n\nVernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton , 515 U.S. 646, 663 (1995)\n(expressing preference for policy of drug-testing all student\nathletes as opposed to testing based on suspicion of drug use\nbecause suspicion-based testing “brings the risk that teachers\nwill  impose  testing arbitrarily upon troublesom e  but not\ndrug-likely students”).  Subjecting all arrestees to the sam e\npolicy promotes equal treatment.  See Bull, 595 F.3d at 983\n(Kozinski, J., concurring) (observing that blanket searches of all\nindividuals  participating in the sam e  activity “trade the\nprotection  afforded by individualized suspicion for the\nprotection derived from the fact that the government treats all\nsimilarly situated people in precisely the same way”).\nIn sum, balancing the Jails’ security interests at the time\nof intake before arrestees enter the general population against\nthe privacy interests of the inmates, we hold that the strip search\nprocedures described by the District Court at BCJ and ECCF are\nreasonable.  Accordingly, we will reverse the District Court’s\ngrant of summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment\nstrip search claim and remand for further proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.9\n9 Having found that the Jails’ valid interest in preventing\nsmuggling justifies the strip searches, we need not determ ine\nwhether the interests in identifying gang members and detecting\nMRSA infection are sufficient to justify the searches.\n33\n\nFlorence v.  Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of\nBurlington, et al.\nNos.  09-3603 & 09-3661\nPOLLAK, District Judge, dissenting.\nI.\nI respectfully disagree with the court’s opinion.  I think\nJudge Rodriguez’s decision should be affirm ed, and I would\nexpressly  predicate the order of affirm ance  on his\ncomprehensive, finely crafted, and characteristically thoughtful\nopinion.\nII.\nIn upholding as constitutional strip searches of persons\ndetained on non-indictable offenses and with respect to whom\nthere is no individualized ground for suspicion that they may be\nbringing contraband into a detention facility, the court finds the\nen banc opinions of the Eleventh Circuit,P  owell v. Barrett,541\nF.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2008), and of the Ninth CircuitB, ull v. City\nand County of San Francisco,  595 F.3d 964 (9th Cir. 2010),\npersuasive.   For m y  part, I find greater wisdom in Judge\nBarkett’s dissent in Powelland Judge Thomas’s dissent in Bull.\nJudge Thomas’s Bulldissent frames the issues this way:\nThe majority sweeps away twenty-five years of\njurisprudence, giving jailors the unfettered right to\nconduct mandatory, routine, suspicionless body\ncavity  searches on any citizen who m ay  be\n\narrested for minor offenses, such as violating a\nleash law or a traffic code, and who pose no\ncredible risk for smuggling contraband into the\njail.  Under its reconfigured regime, the majority\ndiscards Bell’s requirement of balance the need\nfor a search against individual privacy and instead\nblesses  a uniform policy of perform ing  body\ncavity  searches on everyone arrested and\ndesignated  for the general jail population,\nregardless of the triviality of the charge or the\nlikelihood that the arrestee is hiding contraband.\nThe  rationale for this abrupt prece dential\ndeparture is founded on quicksand.  Indeed, the\ngovernment’s entire argument is based on the\nlogical  fallacy  cum  hoc ergo propter hoc –\nhappenstance implies causation.  The government\nargues that contraband has been found in the San\nFrancisco jails.  Thus, the governm ent reasons,\nindividuals who are arrested must be smuggling\ncontraband  into the jail.  Therefore the\ngovernment concludes it must body cavity search\neveryone who is arrested, even those who pose no\nrisk of concealing contraband, much less of trying\nto smuggle contraband into the jail.\nThis reasoning finds no support from the record in\nthis case.  Although there is evidence of som e\narrestees attempting to conceal contraband during\ntheir  arrest, there is not a single docum ent\nexample of anyone doing so with the intent of\n2\n\nsmuggling  contraband into the jail.  More\nimportantly, for our purposes, there is not a single\nexample of anyone from the class defined by the\ndistrict  court who was found to possess\ncontraband upon being strip search.  Not one.\nBull, 595 F.3d at 990.\nIn his District Court opinion, Judge Rodriguez makes a\npoint which gives special cogency to Judge Thom as’s “Not\none”:\n. . .[I]t is worth noting that neither county submits\nsupporting affidavits that detail evidence of a\nsmuggling problem specific to their respective\nfacilities.\nFlorence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, 595 F. Supp. 2d 492,\n513 (D.N.J. 2009).1\n1 The court says that “[i]t is plausible that incarcerated\npersons will induce or rec ruit others to subject them selves to\narrest on non-indictable offenses to smuggle weapons or other\ncontraband into the facility.”  One might doubt that individuals\nwould  deliberately com mit  minor  offenses such as civil\ncontempt—the offense for which Florence was arrested—and\nthen secrete contraband on their person, all in the hope that they\nwill, at some future moment, be arrested and taken to jail to\nmake their illicit deliveries.  Nonetheless, the point m ade by\nJudge Rodriguez establishes that what might in some imagined\ncircumstances be “plausible” is without support in the record\n3\n\nJudge Barkett’s Powell dissent sums up the issues with\nspecial force:\nLike the majority, I recognize and appreciate the\ndeference due to jail administrators as they fulfill\ntheir charge of ensuring security in jails, not only\nfor the jail officials but also for the inmates.  See\nBell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547-48 (1979).  At\nthe same time, “convicted prisoners do not forfeit\nall constitutional protections by reason of their\nconviction and confinement in prison.” I d. at 545.\nThis principle applies with at least as much force\nto individuals detained prior to their trial on petty\nmisdemeanor charges such as failing to pay child\nsupport, driving without a license, or trespassing.\nSee id.  These protections, such as the right to be\nfree  from degrading, hum iliating,  and\ndehumanizing treatment and the right to bodily\nintegrity,  include protection against forced\nnakedness during strip searches in front of others.\nPowell, 541 F.3d at 1315.\nbefore Judge Rodriguez–the record binding on Judge Rodriguez\nand on this court.\n4",

FLORENCE, Plaintiff, \nv. \nBOARD OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF \nBURLINGTON, et al., Order Defendants. \nCivil Action No. 05-3619. \nUnited States District Court, D. New Jersey. \nJune 30, 2009. \nMemorandum Opinion & Order \nJOSEPH H. RODRIGUEZ, Senior District Judge. \nThis matter comes before the Court on Motions by Defendants Board of Chosen \nFreeholders of the County of Burlington, Warden Jule Cole in his Official and Individual \nCapacity, and Burlington County Jail (\"Burlington Defendants\") [Dkt. Entry No. 165] and \nDefendants Essex County Correctional Facility and Essex County Sheriff's \nDepartment(\"Essex Defendants\") [Dkt. Entry No. 166] to amend the Court's Order of \nFebruary 4, 2009 by certifying the judgment on the cross-motions for summary \njudgment as final, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). Plaintiff Albert W. Florence, as \nrepresentative of the class certified by this Court, opposes the motions to amend. For \nthe foregoing reasons, the motions of Burlington and Essex Defendants are granted. \nI. \nBecause the parties are intimately familiar with this case, an exhaustive recitation of the \nfacts and procedural history is unnecessary. Only those facts that are necessary to the \nanalysis of this matter are included herein. \nThis case originated in 2005 when Albert W. Florence filed a complaint against \nBurlington and Essex Defendants for alleged violations of his federal constitutional \nrights. (See Compl. filed July 19, 2005.) After a determination was made on Plaintiff's \nmotion to amend, and discovery proceeded, this Court granted Plaintiff's motion for \ncertification of his proposed class. See Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the \nCounty of Burlington (\"Florence I\"), No. 05-3619, 2008 WL 800970 at *1 (D.N.J. Mar. \n20, 2008). That class was certified as follows: \nAll arrestees charged with non-indictable offenses who were processed, housed or held \nover at Defendant Burlington County Jail and/or Defendant Essex County Correctional \nFacility from March 3, 2003 to the present date who were directed by Defendants' \nofficers to strip naked before those officers, no matter if the officers term the procedure \na `visual observation' or otherwise, without the officers first articulating a reasonable \n\nbelief that those arrestees were concealing contraband, drugs or weapons. \nFlorence I, supra, at *17. \nShortly thereafter, Plaintiff, as representative of the newly-certified class, filed for \nsummary judgment on the issue of law regarding whether Defendants violated the \nFourth Amendment by their blanket policy of strip searching non-indictable arrestees \nwithout reasonable suspicion upon entry into a county correctional facility. [Dkt. Entry \nNo. 116.] Plaintiffs additionally sought injunctive relief against Burlington and Essex \nDefendants. Burlington and Essex Defendants filed their opposition papers and cross-\nmoved for summary judgment.[1] [Dkt. Entry Nos. 130 & 131.] On February 4, 2009, \nPlaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was granted and Defendants' cross-motions \nwere denied. See Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington \n(\"Florence II\"), 595 F. Supp. 2d 492, 513 (D.N.J. 2009). \nDefendants now file motions to amend/correct the Order of February 4, 2009. [Dkt. \nEntry Nos. 165, 166, 167]. Essentially, Burlington and Essex Defendants ask this Court \nto amend its Order to include a provision certifying the decision for appeal to the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). (Burlington Def. Br. 3; Essex \nDef. Br. 2.) Plaintiffs oppose the instant motion. [Dkt. Entry Nos. 173, 180]. This Court \nhas received three submissions styled as amicus curiae letter briefs in support of \nDefendants' motion to amend/correct, undoubtedly due to the ubiquity of similar cases \nin the District of New Jersey.[2] For the reasons expressed below, the motions of \nBurlington and Essex Defendants are granted. \nII. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) permits the Court to amend or correct an order \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) so as to include certification for immediate appeal to the \nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.[3] See, e.g., In re Oxford \nHealth Plans, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 51, 52 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); In re City of Philadelphia Litig., \n1994 WL 250075, at *1 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 31, 1994). Section 1292(b) of the United States \nCode, Title 28, provides in relevant part: \nWhen a district judge, in making in a civil action an order not otherwise appealable \nunder this section, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question \nof law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an \nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the \nlitigation, he shall so state in writing in such order. \n28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). This statute requires that three elements be present prior to \ngranting certification for interlocutory appeal: (1) the Order at issue involves a \ncontrolling issue of law, which, if erroneously decided, would result in reversible error \nupon final appeal; (2) substantial ground for difference of opinion exists regarding the \nresolution of the issue; and (3) an immediate appeal will materially advance the ultimate \ntermination of the litigation. See Levine v. United Healthcare Corp., 285 F. Supp. 2d \n\n552, 556-57 (D.N.J. 2003) (citing Katz v. Carte Blanche Corp., 496 F.2d 747, 754-55 \n(3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 885 (1974)). If satisfied, these factors exhibit the \n\"exceptional circumstances\" upon which a district court may base its decision to grant \ninterlocutory review. See Levine, 285 F. Supp. 2d at 556. Notably, \"a party's mere \ndisagreement with the district court's ruling does not constitute a `substantial ground for \ndifference of opinion. . .'\" Cardona v. General Motors Corp., 939 F. Supp. 351 (D.N.J. \n1996). It is within a district court's discretion to deny interlocutory review even if each \nfactor is satisfied. See Harter v. GAF Corp., 150 F.R.D. 502, 517 (D.N.J. 1993) (citing \nBachowski v. Usery, 545 F.2d 363, 368 (D.N.J. 1976)). Each of these three elements is \nexamined in turn. \nA. Controlling Question of Law \nThere is only one issue of law that Burlington and Essex Defendants seek to certify for \ninterlocutory appeal: \nWhether a blanket policy of strip searching all inmates upon admission to a county \ncorrectional facility is violative of the inmates' constitutional rights? \n(Burlington Def. Br. 4; Essex Def. Br. 3.) Burlington and Essex Defendants contend this \nquestion necessarily involves a controlling issue of law, which, if erroneously decided, \nwould result in reversible error upon final appeal. (Burlington Def. Reply Br. 2; Essex \nReply Br. 1.) Plaintiff cannot reasonably dispute Defendants' contention in this regard. \nAlthough the Court disagrees with the framing of the issue as presented by Burlington \nand Essex Defendants, it is clear that the issue nevertheless involves a controlling \nquestion of law.[4] If, for example, the Third Circuit rules contrary to this Court's decision \nin Florence II, see generally 595 F. Supp. 2d 492 (D.N.J. 2009), and finds that a blanket \npolicy of strip searching non-indictable arrestees admitted to a county correctional \nfacility without first articulating reasonable suspicion does not offend the Fourth \nAmendment, then this Court would have necessarily committed reversible error. As the \nThird Circuit in Katz reasoned, \"controlling means serious to the conduct of the \nlitigation, either practically or legally.\" Katz, 496 F.2d at 755 (citations omitted). Here, \nthe Fourth Amendment question is clearly serious to the conduct of the litigation in a \npractical and legal sense. Therefore, the first element required for certification is \nsatisfied pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \nB. Substantial Grounds for Difference of Opinion \nThe next element that must be satisfied asks whether substantial grounds for difference \nof opinion exist regarding the resolution of the issue. Burlington and Essex Defendants \ndeftly observe this Court's discussion of the split of authority on the Fourth Amendment \nissue in its Opinion and Order dated February 4, 2009. (Burlington Def. Br. 4; Essex \nDef. Br. 3.) Under a subsection entitled \"Competing Authority\", see Florence II, 595 F. \nSupp. 2d at 508-11, the Court discussed Powell v. Barrett, 541 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. \n2008) (en banc)—an Eleventh Circuit case that splits with the majority of Circuits on this \n\nissue. See Powell, 541 F.3d at 1314 (subjecting arrestees to visual strip searches \nduring the booking process without reasonable suspicion does not offend the Fourth \nAmendment). The Court also discussed Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, 539 \nF.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2008), rehearing en banc granted, 558 F.3d 887 (2009), and Stanley \nv. Henson, 337 F.3d 961 (7th Cir. 2003). With respect to Henson, this Court \ndistinguished that case because it involved a clothing-exchange procedure far less \nintrusive than the strip searches of the instant case. See Florence II, 595 F. Supp. 2d at \n508 (\"While the purpose of the search was similar to the instant case, the means to \nserve that purpose were decidedly less intrusive.\"). With respect to Bull, this Court \nnoted that it \"held in concert with the majority of circuits\" opining on this issue. See \nFlorence II, supra, at 508. Nevertheless, because of the vigorous concurrence of Circuit \nJudge Ikuta, see Bull, 539 F.3d at 1202-05, this Court examined that case as if it \nsuggested a new approach to the analysis of strip search cases dealing with newly \nadmitted non-indictable/misdemeanor offenders. Florence II, supra, at 507. As noted \nabove, the Ninth Circuit recently granted an en banc rehearing of its Bull decision. See \nBull, supra, 558 F.3d 887 (9th Cir. 2009). \nIn light of Powell, supra, and the Ninth Circuit's significant decision to rehear Bull, supra, \nBurlington and Essex Defendants contend substantial grounds for difference of opinion \nexist regarding the resolution of the Fourth Amendment strip search issue. (Burlington \nDef. Reply Br. 2; Essex Def. Reply Br. 3 n.1.) In response, Plaintiffs observe that \nDefendants cite no split of authority within this District.[5] (Pl. Opp'n Br. 3.) This \nobservation is accurate. Indeed, the Court relied in part on existing persuasive authority \nfrom the District of New Jersey when it ruled the instant searches of non-indictable \narrestees violated the Fourth Amendment. See Florence II, supra, at 505-06 (citing \nDiLoreto v. Borough of Oaklyn, 744 F. Supp. 610, 622 (D.N.J. 1990); Ernst v. Borough \nof Fort Lee, 739 F. Supp. 220, 225 (D.N.J. 1990); O'Brien v. Borough of Woodbury \nHeights, 679 F. Supp. 429, 434 (D.N.J. 1988); Wilkes v. Borough Clayton, 696 F. Supp. \n144, 149 (D.N.J. 1988); Davis v. City of Camden, 657 F. Supp. 396, 401 (D.N.J. 1987)). \nNevertheless, it is not improper—as Plaintiffs suggest—to look to jurisdictions outside \nthe one in which the Court sits when examining whether substantial grounds for \ndisagreement on a given issue exist.[6] See Levine, 285 F. Supp. 2d at 566 (finding \nsubstantial ground for disagreement after examining decisions outside the district (citing \nArana v. Ochsner Health Plan, Inc., 302 F.3d 462 (5th Cir. 2002), rehearing en banc \ngranted, 319 F.3d 205 (2003); McKandes v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assoc., 243 F. \nSupp. 2d 380 (D.Md. 2003); Popoola v. MD-Individual Practice Assoc., 244 F. Supp. 2d \n577 (D.Md. 2003))); see also n.5 of this Memorandum Opinion. \nDue to Powell and the recent decision by the Ninth Circuit to grant an en banc rehearing \nof Bull, substantial grounds for difference of opinion exist on whether non-indictable \narrestees admitted into a jail facility can be strip searched without first articulating \nreasonable suspicion that they have drugs, weapons, or other contraband. Therefore, \nthe second element required for certification is satisfied under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \nC. Materially Advance the Termination of the Litigation\n\nCertification of this Fourth Amendment issue will materially advance the termination of \nthe litigation. For example, if the Third Circuit affirms the central holding of Florence II, \nthen this Court can proceed directly to the issue of damages. If, however, the Third \nCircuit reverses this Court, Plaintiffs' main contention will fail as a matter of law. In either \ncircumstance, certifying the Fourth Amendment question will materially advance the \ntermination of the litigation. Moreover, the Court acknowledges that a ruling by the Third \nCircuit on this issue may also materially advance the termination of cases similar to the \ninstant one throughout the District, as evidenced by several amicus curiae letter briefs. \nAlthough the outcome of those cases has no bearing on this Court's decision to grant \ncertification, they are worthy of mentioning given the peculiar ubiquity of similar litigation \nthroughout the District. \nIII. \nIn light of the foregoing, this Court grants the motions of Burlington and Essex \nDefendants to amend the Court's Order of February 4, 2009 by certifying the judgment \non the cross-motions for summary judgment as final, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). \nCertification of the Fourth Amendment issue will materially advance the termination of \nthe litigation. There is a substantial ground for difference of opinion on whether a \nblanket policy of strip searching all non-indictable arrestees admitted to a jail facility \nwithout first articulating reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment of the \nUnited States Constitution as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. \nBecause that issue necessarily involves a controlling question of law, and because this \nCourt deems it proper, that question is hereby certified under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) for \ninterlocutory appeal to the United States Circuit Court for the Third Circuit. Defendants' \nmotions [Dkt. Entry Nos. 165, 166, 167] are granted. An appropriate Order shall follow. \nORDER \nAND NOW, This matter having come before the Court on motions by Defendants Board \nof Chosen Freeholders of the County of Burlington, Warden Jule Cole in his Official and \nIndividual Capacity, and Burlington County Jail [Dkt. Entry Nos. 165 & 167], and Essex \nCounty Correctional Facility and Essex County Sheriff's Department [Dkt. Entry No. \n166], to amend/correct the Order of February 4, 2009 by certifying the judgment of law \non cross-motions for summary judgment for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1292(b); and \nThe Court having fully considered the matter; and \nThe Court having found its Order of February 4, 2009 involves a controlling question of \nlaw as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an \nimmediate appeal from that Order may materially advance the ultimate termination of \nthe litigation; \nIt is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED, this 30th day of June, 2009, that Burlington \n\nand Essex Defendants' motions [Dkt. Entry Nos. 165, 166, 167] are GRANTED. The \nOrder of February 4, 2009 is amended, and the following issue is certified for \ninterlocutory appeal: \nwhether a blanket policy of strip searching all non-indictable arrestees admitted to a jail \nfacility without first articulating reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment of \nthe United States Constitution as applied to the States through the Fourteenth \nAmendment; \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that proceedings in Florence v. Board of Chosen \nFreeholders of the County of Burlington, 05-3619 (JHR) be, and hereby are, STAYED \npending resolution of this issue before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. \nIt is SO ORDERED. \n[1] Burlington Defendants moved for summary judgment on three grounds. First, Burlington sought \nsummary judgment on the Fourth Amendment issue regarding strip searches of non-indictable arrestees. \nBecause the Court found in favor of Plaintiffs' position on that issue, Burlington Defendants' motion was \ndenied. Florence II, 595 F. Supp. 2d at 513. Second, Burlington moved for summary judgment in favor of \nBurlington County Freeholders and Warden Jule Cole in his official capacity on Eleventh Amendment \nimmunity grounds. That motion was denied without prejudice, as the Court deemed it premature given the \nrecord before it. Id. at 516. Finally, Burlington moved for summary judgment in favor of Warden Jule Cole \nin his individual capacity on qualified immunity grounds. That motion was denied with prejudice. Id. at \n518.  \nAs for Essex Defendants, they too sought summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment issue. Essex \nalso sought dismissal of Plaintiff's § 1983 Municipality Custom Violations claim. Both prayers for relief \nwere denied. Id. at 513, 519. \n[2] Specifically, this Court received amicus curiae letters from Atlantic, Gloucester, and Ocean Counties \nasking this Court to grant Defendants' motions to amend/correct the Order of February 4, 2009. \n[3] The Court observes that a motion to certify for interlocutory appeal may be brought directly under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1292(b). \n[4] The Court frames the issue in accordance with its limited holding of Florence II, namely:  \nwhether a blanket policy of strip searching all non-indictable arrestees admitted to a county correctional \nfacility without first articulating reasonable suspicion violates the Fourth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment? \n[5] In this regard, Plaintiffs suggest contrary authority must exist within the Court's District or Circuit in \norder to find that substantial grounds for difference of opinion exist. Plaintiffs cite Cardona, supra, 939 F. \nSupp. at 351-53, to substantiate this contention. That case, however, is inapposite. Cardona involved a \nmotion to certify for interlocutory appeal the decision to disqualify attorneys from further representation of \nthe plaintiffs. Id. at 352. In denying the motion, the district court regarded extra-jurisdictional precedent as \nirrelevant to the court's limited inquiry. Id. at 354. The appellants pointed to a case in the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania where the Court, faced with the same issue of disqualification, reached the opposite \nresult of the District of New Jersey. Id. Distinguishing the cases, Judge Orlofsky for the District of New \nJersey attributed any difference of opinion to \"each court's respective obligation to interpret and apply its \n\nown, state-based Rules of Professional Conduct.\" Id. at 355. By contrast, the instant case involves a \nfederal question arising under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Looking to extra-\njurisdictional authority is far from inappropriate in such a circumstance. \n[6] The fact that this Court analyzed Powell and ultimately rejected its \"contrarian holding\" as \"less than \ncompelling\", see Florence II, supra, at 511, does not in any way subtract from the weight of that Eleventh \nCircuit opinion. Just because this Court disagreed with Powell's reasoning does not mean that Powell \nceases to exist. Powell does exist; it is fitting, therefore, to afford it some weight in the instant analysis. \nPlaintiff's contention that a \"sheer contradiction\" results from Defendants' reliance on Powell in advancing \nthis motion, after this Court disagreed with it in Florence II, is without merit.
