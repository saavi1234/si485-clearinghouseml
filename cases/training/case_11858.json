    "summary": "<p>On April 30, 2007, a high school math teacher employed by the Poway Unified School District filed this suit against the school district in the Southern District of California. The plaintiff claimed that the school district had violated his First Amendment rights by requiring him to take down banners in his classroom containing quotations from prominent American political documents referencing a Judeo-Christian god. The plaintiff claimed injury under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Article I &sect; 2 of the California Constitution, the No Preference Clause of the California Constitution, and the Establishment Clause of the California Constitution. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as nominal damages. The plaintiff was represented by a non-profit law center devoted to Christian interests and the defendants were represented by private counsel.</p>\r\n<p>The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(6), and 12(f). On September 4, 2008, the Southern District of California (Judge Roger T. Benitez) issued an order denying defendants' motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, 2009, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 25, 2010, Judge Benitez issued an opinion granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denying defendants' motion for summary judgment. 2010 WL 768856.&nbsp;The Court found that the plaintiff's classroom walls constituted a limited public forum for faculty speech and that the plaintiff's speech was squelched because of his Judeo-Christian viewpoint. Furthermore, the Court found that by removing the plaintiff's classroom banners because they conveyed a Judeo-Christian viewpoint, while at the same time permitting displays by other teachers of Buddhist and Hindu religious symbols (such as Tibetan prayer flags and a poster of Mahatma Gandhi's \"seven social sins\"), the defendants had violated the Establishment Clause in using the weight of government to prefer one religion and express hostility over another religion.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2010, the school district appealed Judge Benitez's grant of summary judgment to the Ninth Circuit. On September 13, 2011, the Ninth Circuit, in an opinion written by Justice Richard C. Tallman, reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment and remanded with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of Poway Unified School District. 658 F.3d 954. The Court held that when the plaintiff performs his duties as a high school math teacher, he speaks not as an individual, but as a public employee, and the school district is free to control the message he imparts to his students.</p>\r\n<p>The Ninth Circuit also rejected the plaintiff's claim that the school district had violated his rights under the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses by demanding that he take down his banners while allowing other teachers to display religious symbols in their classrooms. The Court concluded that though these other symbols contained religious content, they did not have the purpose of endorsing a particular religion or stigmatizing those who did not follow this religion. As such, the school district's action in allowing the display of other religious symbols did not have the effect of favoring a certain religion in contravention of the Establishment Clause. On the plaintiff's Equal Protection claim, the Court held that because the plaintiff had no individual right to speak for the government, he could not have suffered an equal protection violation in being forced to take down his banners from government property. The docket has not been updated since January 12, 2012, and the case is presumed closed.&nbsp;</p>",

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff Bradley Johnson is  a math teacher at a local high  school  operated by Defendant Poway Unified  School \nDistrict (\"School\").  He prominently  displayed two very large banners  on the wall  of his  classroom.  One banner had \ncolored stripes like  an American flag,  and contained phrases  in large block letters phrases reading:  \"IN  GOD  WE \nTRUST\";  \"ONE NATION UNDER GOD\";  \"GOD  BLESS  AMERICA\";  and  \"GOD  SHED  HIS  GRACE  ON  THEE.\" \nThe  other banner had a white  field,  and read:  [*4]  \"All  Men Are  Created Equal  They Are  Endowed By Their \nCREATOR\"  (the word  \"CREATOR\"  was  in ALL  CAPS  in a font twice the  size  of the  other words). \nThe  School had Johnson remove the banners  on grounds that the banners violated a  school policy that limits the use\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *4 \nof religious messages 1n the  classroom.  The  School  also  contends that the banners,  as  displayed,  violate the \nEstablishment Clause  of the  First Amendment,  and California Education Code,  and therefore  1s within its rights to have \nthem removed.  On the  other hand,  Johnson claims that the  School's removal  of the banners  constitutes  a violation of his \nfree  speech and religious rights under both the  United  States  and California Constitutions.  The parties  are now \nsubmitting  cross-motions  for  summary judgment. \nHere,  under Ninth Circuit law,  Johnson's First Amendment right to  display his banners is trumped by the  School's \nright to  avoid excessive  entanglement with religion prohibited by the Establishment Clause.  Recent case law  explains \nthat a teacher may violate the Establishment Clause with a single  sentence  directed at students.  So  school  districts need \nto be  concerned about their teachers'  speech.  Here,  because  Johnson's  speech 1s  [*5]  that of an employee,  and not a \nprivate  citizen,  and because the religious nature  of his banners  advance religion over non-religion and one particular \nreligious  sect over others  in violation of the Establishment Clause,  the  School  did not violate  Johnson's  constitutional  or \nstatutory rights by having the banners removed.  Furthermore, the  School gave Johnson the  option of posting the phrases \nin the  actual  context,  like  a poster containing the text of the  Declaration of Independence,  a poster with the text from the \nPledge  of Allegiance,  and  so  forth.  Accordingly, the  School's removal  of the banners  does not violate Johnson's nghts, \nand thus the Defendants’  motion  should be  granted. \nHl.  FACTUAL AND  PROCEDURAL  BACKGROUND \nA.  Mr.  Johnson  and  His  Banners \nBradley Johnson 1s  a high  school mathematics teacher,  currently teaching at Westview High School, which is \noperated by the Poway Unified  School District.  First Amended Complaint (FAC),  Doc.  #17,  P  6;  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson \nDepo.,  pp.  13:23-14:1.  He  1s  a Christian,  and has taught with the  District for 30 years.  Doc.  #17,  P6;  Exh.  \"F.\"  Johnson \nDepo.,  p.  11:8-20.  Johnson is  currently the  adviser for the  Christian club  at Westview,  [*6]  and has held that role  since \n2005.  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson Depo.  p.  27:3-11.  He was previously  an advisor at  schools where he taught previously.  Exh. \n\"F,\"  Johnson Depo.,  p.  19:7-13. \nJohnson prominently displayed two banners in his  classroom during Fall,  2006.  Both banners were  7  feet long by 2 \nfeet wide,  and were  \"displayed in a non-obstructive manner.\"  Doc.  #17,  P 28;  See  also Exhs.  \"A'\"  and  \"B.\" \nThe  first banner had red,  white,  and blue  stripes,  and was  emblazoned with the  following messages  in large block \nletters:  \"INGOD  WE  TRUST\";  \"ONE NATION UNDER GOD\";  \"GOD  BLESS  AMERICA\";  and  \"GOD  SHED  HIS \nGRACE  ON  THEE.\"  Doc,  #17,  P26;  Exhs.  \"A\"  and  \"B.\"  The phrase  \"In God We  Trust\"  is the  official motto  of the \nUnited  States.  Doc.  #  17,  PP 29-30.  The phrase  \"One Nation Under God\"  may be  found in the Pledge  of Allegiance. \nDoc.  #17,  P  34.  The phrase  \"God Bless America\"  is  a reference to the  song  of the  same title written by  Irving Berlin in \nthe  early 20th Century.  Doc.  #17,  P 37.  The phrase  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee\"  is  a reference  from the  song, \n\"America the  Beautiful.\"  Doc.  #17,  P  38.  Mr.  Johnson has had this banner or one like  it hanging in his  classroom  since \n1982.  Exh.  \"F\"  Johnson Depo.,  [*7]  pp.  78:20-79:24. \nThe  second banner reads  in large  font:  \"All Men Are  Created Equal,  They Are Endowed By  Their CREATOR.\" \nExhs.  \"A\"  and  \"B\".  This phrase  1s  a misquote  from the preamble to the Declaration of Independence,  which states,  in \npart:  \"We hold these truths to be  self-evident,  that all  men  are  created  equal,  that they  are  endowed  by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable  Rights,  that among these  are  Life,  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” \nhttp://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html,  emphasis  added.  The word  \"Creator\"  is  in \nALLCAPS  typeface  about twice the  size  of the  other words  on the banner,  which are  in Initial  Caps;  the word \n\"CREATOR\"  also  occupies its  own line  of text.  Exhs.  \"A\"  and  \"B.\" \nJohnson designed the layout of this particular banner so that the word  \"CREATOR\"  would be  larger so that he \ncould highlight that there was  a  supreme being who provided men with the rights  described in the preamble to the \nDeclaration of Independence.  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson Depo.,  pp.  88:2-89:2.  Johnson had his  \"Declaration\"  banner made in\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *7 \n1989,  and has  displayed it thereafter in his  classroom.  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson Depo., p.  86:14-17.  Doc  #17,  P27. \nJohnson  [*8]  explained that the purpose  of the two banners  is  for  \"celebrat[ing]  our national heritage,” \n\"highlight[ing]  the religious heritage  and nature  of our nation that we have  as  a foundation\"  and  \"espousing God as \nopposed to no  God  .  .  .  but not any particular God.\"  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson Depo., pp.  95:15-24;  103:3-22.  Both banners \nwere  located on walls  in Johnson's  classroom where they  can be  easily  seen and read from where  students  sit in \nJohnson's  classroom.  Salvati Decl.  P  3;  Exhibit  \"B.\" \nB.  The Applicable  School District Policies/Procedures. \nDefendant William Chiment  serves  as the  School's  Associate  Superintendent for Personnel  Support  Services,  and \nhas been in that position for ten years.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo,  p.  20:5:16.  According to  Chiment,  the  District's \ninformal practice  is to permit teachers to  decorate their classrooms with personal items  such as posters,  flags,  or \nbanners,  within some  limits.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo,  pp.  57:15-58:3;  65:2-6.  For example,  teachers’  personal items \ncannot violate the  School's  anti-harassment policy.  Exh  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo,  pp.  58:4-21;  59:13-20.  Some  of the  other \nlimits the  School may  also take  into  consideration are the  size  of [*9]  the item,  the  age  appropriateness  of the particular \nitem for the  students in the  classroom,  and the potential relationship to the  curriculum.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo.  pp. \n77:8-78:3.  For example,  teachers  could exhibit family photographs,  but photographs  of a family  drinking  alcohol \nheavily would not be permitted.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo.,  p.235:17-25. \nThe  School  also has  a formal written policy regarding the teaching  of controversial issues,  which governs what \nteachers  can post on their classroom walls.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo.,  p.  85:13-20.  That formal policy,  BP 3.11, \nprovides,  in part, that teachers must  \"exercise  caution and discretion when deciding whether or not a particular issue  is \nsuitable  for study  or discussion in any particular class.  Exh.  \"C.\"  The policy also  \"requires teachers to  ensure that all \nsides  of a controversial  issue  are impartially presented with adequate  and appropriate  factual  information\"  and \n\"[w]ithout promoting  any partisan point of view.”  Exh.  \"C.\" \nThis  Policy has  an attached Administrative  Procedure,  entitled AP 3.11.2,  that contains  a  section concerning the \n\"Responsibilities  of Teachers.\"  Exh.  \"D,\"  pp.  13-15.  Those responsibilities  include  \"choos[ing]  [*10]  suitable  and \nuseful  instructional materials,\"  \"direct[ing]  class  discussion to  cover all points  of view,”  distinguish[ing]  between \nteaching  and advocating,  and refrain[ing] from using classroom teacher influence to promote partisan  or sectarian \nviewpoints\"  Exh.  \"D,\"  p.  14.  AP  3.11.2  also has  a section on the nghts  of students,  and expressly gives  students the \n\"right to  form and express individual  opinions  on controversial issues without jeopardizing relations with teachers  or \nothers.\"  Exh.  \"D,\"  p.  15.  AP 3.11.2  also has  a section entitled  \"The  Selection of Issues.\"  Within that section, the policy \nstates that in general,  \"the  decision as to whether a controversial issue  should become  a matter of school  study  should be \nbased upon\"  ten listed criteria,  including  \"1.  It must contribute  significantly to the  objectives  of the  curriculum;  ...  6. \nThe issue must involve  alternate points  of view which can be understood and defined by  students;  7.  The  issue must be \none  about which information 1s present and available  so  alternatives  can be  discussed and evaluated on a factual  and \nreasonable basis;.  ..  and  10.  The  issue must provide  opportunity  for critical thinking  for the  [*11]  development of \ntolerance  and the understanding  of conflicting points  of view,  at the  same time that it contributes to the prescribed \ncourse  of study and the general  educational program of the  school.\"  Exh.  \"D,\"  p.  15. \nEven non-curricular items  are part of the  learning  environment and potentially  advocating,  and therefore  such items \nsubject to this written policy.

The Banners  Come  To  the Attention of School Administrators. \nDawn Kastner serves  as the  Principal  at Westview High School,  and has been in that position  since  July  1,  2006. \nExh.  \"G,\"  Kastner  [*12]  Depo, p.  12:6-15.  Early in her tenure  as principal  (sometime in Fall  2006),  Mr.  Subbiah,  a \nWestview teacher,  raised a concern with Kastner about why Johnson was permitted to have those  signs in his room; \nKastner also heard about the banners  from a student and another teacher.  So  Kastner went into  Johnson's  classroom and \nsaw the banners  for the  first time.  Exh.  \"G\"  Kastner Depo, p.  37:15-38:14;  54:22-55:3,  Kastner was  concerned that the \nbanners were very large,  and inappropriately promoted a viewpoint advocating God,  as the phrases were pulled out of \ntheir original  context.  Exh  \"G,\"  Kastner Depo.,  pp.  42:17-43:6. \nKastner met with Johnson to  discuss his banners.  Kastner told Johnson that taking the phrases  concerning God and \nputting them together in large print out of context was moving  away  from a patriotic  comment to promotion of his \nreligious beliefs that might make  some  students uncomfortable.  Exh.  \"G,\"  Kastner Depo, pp.  75:3-17.  During the \ndiscussion,  Kastner suggested to  Johnson that an Islamic  student walking into the  classroom may  feel bad,  and feel like \nhe  or she would not fit in;  Johnson replied  something to the  effect of \"sometimes that's necessary.\"  Exh.  \"G,\"  Kastner \nDepo.  [*13]  ,  pp.  43:7-44:15.  Johnson further explained he  felt strongly that he needed the  signs to  stay up, that he had \na right to have the banners up,  and that he'd had them up  for a long time.  Exh.  \"G,\"  Kastner Depo.,  pp.  76:1-6.  Kastner \nsuggested that Johnson put the phrases  on the banners in context,  such as posting the  entire Declaration of \nIndependence.  Exh.  \"G,\",  Kastner Depo.,  pp.  43:7-44:15.  She  also  suggested reducing the  scale  of the banners to \n\"something  small  around the  desk  area.\"  Exh.  \"G,\"  Kastner Depo.,  p.  78:15-18 \nKastner contacted Melavel Robertson (Assistant  Superintendent for Learning  Support Services)  for guidance  on \nthese  \"really big\"  signs.

Exh.  \"G,\"  Kastner Depo, pp.  40:3-10;  McDowell \nDecl.,  P 2;  Exh.  \"A.\"  Robertson was  concemed with the  size  of the banners;  she  felt that students  of different faiths may \nfeel uncomfortable with a banner that large,  and this was  discussed amongst the  School's  cabinet-level  administrators. \nExh.  \"H,\"  Robertson Depo.,  pp  30:13-20;  35:9-36-4.  Robertson referred Kastner to  speak with Mr.  [*14]  Chiment,  as \nChiment is the person within the  School to  deal with personnel  concerns that might raise  legal  issues.  Exh.  \"H,\" \nRobertson Depo.,  pp.  29:3-30:12. \nD.  Johnson Is Asked  To Remove The  Banners  From His  Classroom Walls. \nMr.  Chiment spoke with Kastner and reviewed photographs  of the banners in Mr.  Johnson's  classroom.  Exh.  \"E,”  p. \n32:7-20.  Ultimately,  the  decision to have  Mr.  Johnson remove his banners was made by Mr.  Chiment.  Exh.  \"D.\"  This \ndecision Was  agreed to by the  Superintendent's  cabinet,  which consists  of Defendant Donald Philips  (Superintendents), \nand the  Deputy  Superintendent,  John Collins,  Chiment,  and the  assistant  superintendents.  Exh  \"I,\"  Collins,  depo.,  pp. \n21:21-22:23. \nMr.  Chiment asked Mr.  Johnson by telephone to remove his banners  on or about January  19,  2007.  Exh.  D;  Exh \n\"E,\"  Chiment depo,  p.  32:3-6.  Mr.  Chiment sent a letter to Johnson dated January 23,  2007,  to  confirm the  decision to \nhave  Johnson remove his banners,  and to provide the legal basis  for the  decision in writing.  Exh.  \"D\";  Exh  \"E,\"  Chiment \ndepo,  p.  31:1-10.  Referring to the two banners, the letter states that  \"[T]he prominent display of these brief and narrow \nselections  of text  [*15]  from documents  and  songs without the benefit of any context and of a motto,  all which include \nthe word 'God'  or 'Creator'  has the  effect of using your influence  as  a teacher to promote  a sectarian viewpoint.\"  Exh. \n\"D.\"  The letter expressly notes the prohibitions  in California Education Code  section 51511  and AR 3.11.2  as grounds \nfor the  School's position.  Exh.  \"D.\" \nChiment further explained that the reason Johnson was  asked to remove his banners  is because they violate  District \npolicy  and procedure,  consistent with the  California and U.S.  Constitutions  and California Education Code. \nSpecifically,  the banners  advocated a particular religious viewpoint over non-religion (atheism and agnosticsism),  and \nthey  also  advocated  \"God\"  over other religions that do not use the word  \"God\"  for a supreme being  (such as Yahweh or\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.

Although religion is not a category of \nitems prohibited from classroom walls,  the District may prohibit religious viewpoints where the teacher appears to be \nteaching  or advocating  a religious viewpoint separate  from a curricular context.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo,  pp. \n129:13-21.  Chiment further believed  [*16]  that these banners  could be  a distraction to  a  student that was upset with the \nparticular theology  of the banners.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo.,  p  276:17-21. \nMr.  Johnson was provided with  some  suggested alternative posters to post on his walls  in lieu of his banners.  Exh. \n\"G,\"  Kastner Depo.,  pp.  99:25-100:9.\"  Mr.  Chiment had asked his  staff to  go to  a teacher supply  store  and buy items \nthat would place the  statements  of Mr.  Johnson's banners in context.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo, pp.  140:21-141:9.  These \nsuggested materials  consisted of various posters  depicting the  entire text of the  Declaration of Independence,  displays  of \ncoinage  containing the words  \"In God We  Trust\"  and the text of the  Pledge  of Allegiance.

Procedural Posture. \nBased upon the  facts  alleged within it,  the  First Amended Complaint names  six separate  claims  against the District \nand the  individual  defendants,  comprised of the  five  School Board Members  (Mangum,  Vanderveen,  Patapow, \nGutschow,  and Ranftle),  District Superintendent Don Phillips,  District Assistant  [*17]  Superintendent William \nChiment,  and Westview High Principal  Dawn Kastner.  Doc #17, pp.  3-4,  13-17. \nThe  six claims  are  for:  (1) Violation of Freedom of Speech under the First Amendment to the  U.S.  Constitution;  (2) \nViolation of the  Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment to the  U.S.  Constitution;  (3) Violation of the  Equal \nProtection Clause  of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S.  Constitution;  (4)  Violation of the Freedom of Speech under \nthe  California Constitution;  (5)  Violation of the No  Preference  Clause  of the  California Constitution;  and (6)  Violation \nof the  Establishment Clause  of the  California Constitution.  Doc.  #17,  pp.  13-17.  The  first three  claims  are brought under \n42  U.S.C.  section  1983.  In addition to the  enumerated claims,  Johnson also  alleges that the  Defendants’  actions violate \nEducation Code  section  51511.  Doc.  #17,  P  54. \nDefendants moved to  dismiss the FAC under Rule  12(b)(6),  and the  court denied the motion.  Doc  #25.  In that \nmotion,  however,  the  Court was  confined to  an analysis  of the  four corners  of the  complaint,  and could not review \nextrinsic  evidence  in making its  determination.  See Parrino  v.  FHP,  Inc.,  146 I'.3d 699,  705-06  (9th  Cir.  1998).  [*18] \nThat restriction does not apply to the parties’  cross-motions  for summary judgment.  nl  Fed.R.Civ.P.  56(c). \nnl  The  Court must consider each cross-motion separately  \"on its  own merits\"  to  determine whether any \ngenuine issue  of material  fact exists.  air Housing Council of Riverside  County,  Inc.  v.  Riverside  Two,  249 F.3d \n1132,  1136  (9th  Cir.2001).  When evaluating cross-motions  for summary judgment,  the  court must analyze \nwhether the record demonstrates the  existence  of genuine issues  of material  fact,  both in cases where both \nparties  assert that no material  factual  issues  exist,  as well  as where the parties  dispute the  facts.  See /d.  at 1136 \n(citing  Chevron  USA,  Inc.  v.  Cayetano,  224 F.3d 1030,  1037 &  n.  5  (Qth  Cir.2000)). \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Plaintiff's  First And  Fourth  Claims  for Violation  of Freedom of Speech Does  Not State A  Claim Because \nJohnson's  Banners Violate  the  Establishment Clause,  The  California Education  Code,  and  School Policy.  [*19] \nThe Defendants  do not disagree that public  school teachers have  First Amendment rights.  See  7inker v.  Des Moines \nIndependent Community School District,  393  U.S.  503,  506(1969).  But those nghts may be  limited by  a public \nemployer.  The  question,  then,  1s what test this  court should apply to  determine whether teacher classroom  speech \ngenerally,  and Johnson's  speech specifically,  warrants First Amendment protection.\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *19 \n1.  The Ninth  Circuit uses  a Pickering-style balancing  test to  decide whether a  public  employer may  restrict \nemployee  speech,  not a  \"forum analysis.\" \nIn ruling  on the  School's motion to  dismiss,  this  Court ruled that the balancing test of Pickering v.  Bd.  of Educ.,  391 \nU.S.  563  (1968)  would not be useful in this  case because the Ninth Circuit uses  a  \"forum analysis\"  for school  speech \ncases.  Doc.  #25, p.  6.  n2  However, none  of the  cases  cited by this  Court in reaching that conclusion involved a public \nemployer's limitation on an employee's  speech.  So those  cases  are  distinguishable,  and the  Defendants respectfully \ndisagree that forum analysis  is  applicable here. \nn2  Citing  Truth v.  Kent School District,  524 F.3d 957,  972  (9th  Cir.2008)  (applying  forum analysis); Flint \nv.  Dennison,  458 F.3d 816,  830  (9th  Cir.2007)  (applying forum analysis); Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified School \nDist.  No.  48,  329 F.3d 1044,  1048-50  (9th  Cir.2003)  (applying  forum analysis);  and Downs,  228 F.3d at \n1009-11  (declining to  apply forum analysis where  speech at issue belongs to the  school  district). \n[*20] \nAccordingly, the Defendants reiterate their prior argument that the balancing test of Pickering 1s proper here \nbecause the  case  involves the  Defendants’  limitation of Johnson's workplace  speech as  an employee. \nThe  Supreme  Court has reaffirmed the use  of the Pickering balancing test  \"[t]o reconcile the  employee's right to \nengage in speech and the government employer's nght to protect its  own legitimate  interests  in performing its mission.\" \nCity of San Diego v.  Roe,  543  U.S.  77,  82  (2004). \nMoreover,  the Ninth Circuit recently  applied a  \"slight vaniation\"  of the Pickering balancing test to religious  speech \nmade by  a public  employee  1n the workplace.  See Berry v,  Department of Social Services,  447 F.3d 642,  649-650  (9th \nCir.  2006)  [\"we  adhere to  our practice  of applying a balancing test when confronted with constitutional  challenges to \nrestrictions  On public  employee  speech in the workplace.\"] \nIn reaching its  conclusion that the balancing test applicable, the Berry court noted that public  employers  \"must run \nthe  gauntlet of either being  sued for not respecting  an employee's nights under the Free  Exercise  and Free  Speech \nclauses  [*21]  of the First Amendment or being  sued for violating the  Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment by \nappearing to  endorse  its  employee's religious  expression.  The Pickering balancing test recognizes these  important,  but \nsometimes  competing,  concerns  and allows  a public  employer to navigate  a  safe  course.\"  Berry,  447 I’. 3d at 650.  The \nBerry court also  applied the Pickering balancing test to the  question of whether the public  employee may be restricted \nfrom displaying of religious  items  in the workplace,  despite the  employee's  contention that such restriction amounted to \n\"viewpoint discrimination,\"  as Johnson does here.  See Berry,  447 F.3d at 651.  n3 \nn3  Defendants note that with respect to the Berry court's  analysis  of whether the  school  conference  could be \nused by public  employees  for a prayer meeting,  the  court used a forum  analysis.  Berry,  447 F.3d at p.  651. \nJohnson,  however,  does not contend that the  District is restricting use  of school  facilities,  so the  forum analysis \ndoes not apply here. \n[*22] \nThe Ninth Circuit's use  of the Pickering balancing test in teacher  speech cases  1s  in accord with the  Sixth and \nSeventh Circuits,  which have  also used the Pickering analysis  in assessing the limitations  of teacher speech rights.  See \nCockrel v.  Shelby County School Dist.,  270 F.3d 1036,  (6th Cir.  2001); Mayer v.  Monroe  County Community School \nCorp.,  474 F.3d 477  (7th  Cir.  2007). \n2.  Public  schools  may limit their employees  religious  speech  to  avoid  entanglement with  the  Establishment\nPage  8 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *22 \nClause. \nThe  \"slight variation”  of the Pickering test used by the Berry court balanced the teacher's right to  speak  against the \npublic  employer's mission to be  free  of Establishment Clause  entanglement.  Berry,  447 F.3d at 650. \nThis  is  consistent with Supreme  Court jurisprudence, which  \"suggested in  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271 \n[citations](1981),  that the interest of the  State in avoiding  an Establishment Clause violation 'may be  [a]  compelling’  one \njustifying  an abridgment of free  speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\" Lamb's Chapel v.  Center \nMoriches  Union Free School Dist.,  508  U.S.  384,  394  (1993).  [*23]  The  Supreme  Court,  however,  has noted that \nwhether a  State's  interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination’  is  an \nopen one.\"  Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified Sch.  Dist,  329 F.3d 1044,  1053  n.  7  (9th  Cir.2003)  (quoting  Good News Club, \n533  U.S.  at 113). \nThe issue,  however,  is no  longer open in the Ninth Circuit.  The Ninth Circuit has  \"recognized that Establishment \nClause  concerns  can justify  speech restrictions  '1n order to  avoid the  appearance  of government  sponsorship  of \nreligion.\" Hills,  329 F.3d at  1053  (quoting Lassonde  v.  Pleasanton  Unified School Dist.,  320 F.3d 979,  983-85  (9th  Cir. \n2003);  citing Cole v.  Oroville  Union High School Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092,  1103-05  (9th  Cir.  2000),  and Prince v.  Jacoby, \n303 F.3d 1074,  1082  (9th  Cir.2002)). \nThe Ninth Circuit has  applied this  doctrine to public  schools'  restriction of teacher religious  speech.  In a case \nconcerning  a high  school teacher's  challenge to  a restriction barring him from discussing religion with  students, the \nNinth Circuit held that the  school  district's  interest in avoiding  [*24]  an Establishment Clause violation trumped the \nteacher's right to talk to  students  about religion.  Peloza v.  Capistrano  Unified Sch.  Dist,  37 F.3d 517,  522  (9th \nCir.1994).  The Peloza  approach was  cited with approval in Berry,  447 F.3d at 650.  Accordingly,  the Ninth Circuit's \nPickering balancing test 1s the most appropriate  for this  case. \nIn the  alternative,  the  Defendants  suggest it would also be  appropriate to  apply the  gloss  on the Pickering balancing \ntest first discussed in Garcetti v.  Ceballos,  547  U.S.  410,  421-22  (2006).  Whether the  Garcetti refinement to the \nbalancing test 1s  applicable to  employee  speech in schools  is  an open question in the Ninth Circuit.  The  Fourth Circuit \nhas  declined to  apply  Garcetti,  but the  Seventh Circuit has  applied it.  Contrast Mayer,  474 F.3d 477  (7th  Cir.2007) \n(finding that  \"Garcetti  applie[d]  directly,\"  based on  Seventh Circuit precedent that held that public  school  students, who \nare  a captive  audience,  should not be  subjected to teachers’  idiosyncratic perspectives;  rather,  elected  school boards \nshould make policies  about teaching contentious issues)  [*25]  with Lee v.  York County Sch.  Div.,  484 F.3d 687,  695 n. \n11  (Ath Cir.),  cert.  denied,  /28 S.Ct.  387 (2007)  (continuing to  apply traditional Pickering-Connick approach,  because \nthe  Supreme  Court did not  \"explicitly  ...  decide whether  [the  Garcetti] analysis would apply in the  same manner to  a \ncase involving  speech related to teaching\"). \n3.  The Defendants'  concern,  that Johnson's  banners impermissibly entangle  the  School in an  Establishment \nClause violation,  is  legitimate. \nApplying the  facts to the Ninth Circuit's balancing test,  the  scales tip  in favor of the  School Defendants.  The  School \nasked Johnson to remove his banners  from his  classroom walls because the prominent display of the brief and narrow \nselections  of text from national  documents  and  songs without the benefit of any  context,  and which all  include the word \n'God'  or 'Creator,’  promotes  a religious viewpoint.  Specifically,  the banners  advocate  a particular religious viewpoint \nover non-religion (atheism and agnosticsism),  and they also  advocate  \"God\"  over other religions that do not use the \nword  \"God\"  for a supreme being  (such as  Yahweh or Allah,  for example).  Exh  \"E,\"  Chiment  [*26]  Depo, pp.  128:8  - \n129:12;  133:14-134:2.  The  School  further believes that these banners  could be  a distraction to  a student that was upset \nwith the particular theology  of the banners.  Exh.  \"E\"  Chiment Depo.,  p 276:17-21.  The  School's  officials  are not \nconstitutional  scholars,  but these notions  adequately  encapsulate the  legal  conclusion that to  display the banners to \nstudents  during  school time  on  school grounds would violate the Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment.\nPage  9 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *26 \nAs more  fully explained below in the  Defendants  discussion of Johnson's  Establishment Clause  claim,  infra,  the \ntest is that there is no violation under these  circumstances:  (1) the  government's  action must have  a  secular purpose;  (2) \nits principal  and primary  effect must be  one that neither advances nor inhibits religion;  and (3)  it must not foster \nexcessive  government entanglement with religion.  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602,  612-13  (1971). \nHere,  Johnson's banners violate  all three prongs  of the Lemon test.  First,  the banners  do not have  a secular purpose. \nJohnson teaches math.  The banners  are not part of the  curriculum.  And by Johnson's  own admission,  the phrases  on the \nbanners were  [*27]  chosen not just to promote the nation's heritage,  but also to  espouse religion over non-religion.  Exh. \n\"F,\"  p.103:3-22.  This  is  evidenced by the use  of the word CREATOR on the  \"Declaration\"  banner.  The word \n\"CREATOR\"  occupies  its  own line,  is  about twice  as big as the  other words  on the banner,  and is the  only word in ALL \nCAPS,  as  if shouting to be noticed.  Johnson  said that the reason the word CREATOR is bigger is because he wanted to \nemphasize  a  supreme being's role in giving man his nights.  This  emphasis  does not have  a  secular purpose. \nSecond, the principal  and primary effect of the banners  advance religion.  Each of the  five phrases,  standing alone, \nmight not run afoul  of the First Amendment due to the historical implications  of the phrases  (a conclusion that School \nadministrators  acknowledge).  See,  e.g., Aronow  v.  United States,  432 I'.2d 242  (9th  Cir.1970)  [national motto  \"In God \nWe  Trust\"  on currency does not violate Establishment Clause].  But when all  of the phrases  are joined together,  they \naccumulatively de-emphasize the historical  aspects  of the  speech,  and instead emphasize the religious  aspects  of the \nspeech.  The  secondary religious meaning behind  [*28]  each individual phrase becomes the primary meaning when \nstrung together.  In  short,  when viewed in their totality,  the banners'  message  1s  less  about Nation,  and more  about God. \nThus,  the primary effect is to  advance the  Christian religion. \nFinally,  Johnson's banners  foster excessive  government entanglement with religion.  The Ninth Circuit has  said it \nbest with respect to Mr.  Johnson:  He  \"is not just any  ordinary  citizen.  He 1s  a teacher.  He  1s  one  of those  especially \nrespected persons  chosen to teach in the high  school's  classroom.  He is  clothed with the mantle  of one who  imparts \nknowledge  and wisdom.  His  expressions  of opinion are  all the more believable because he  is  a teacher.  The  likelihood \nof high  school  students  equating his views with those  of the  school is  substantial.\"  Peloza,  supra,  37 F.3d at 522.\"A \nteacher appears to  speak for the  state when he  or she teaches;  therefore,  the  department may permissibly restrict  such \nreligious  advocacy.\"  Tucker v.  California State Dept.  of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204,  1213  (9th  Cir.  1996),  citing Peloza,  37 \nF.3d at 522. \nHere,  Johnson's banners  are both 7  feet by 2  feet with large typeface.  [*29]  Johnson's banners  can be  easily read \nby  students in the  classroom.  See Exh.  \"B.\"  Any  student who  does not agree with the notion that God is  a  supreme being \nor creator could be  intimidated by Johnson's banners. \nThe  School's  concerns  of excessive  entanglement with respect to  Johnson are particularly justified given that a \nsingle  sentence uttered by a teacher directed at students  during the  school  day may constitute  an Establishment Clause \nviolation.  See  C.F.  v.  Capistrano  Unified School Dist.,  615 F.Supp.2d 1137,  1156 (C.D.  Cal.,  2009).  In CLF,  the \nDistrict Court found that a public high  school teacher violated the  Establishment Clause by telling his  students  of his \nunequivocal belief that creationism is  \"superstitious nonsense.\" /d.  at pp.  1146,  1149,  1156. \nIf a one  sentence  disparagement of religion by  a teacher violates the Establishment Clause,  then the reverse must \nalso be true:  a one-sentence  statement favoring a particular religious  ideology  also violates the  Establishment Clause. \nAnd here,  there  is not just one phrase  in Mr.  Johnson's  classroom,  there  are  five.  And worse,  Johnson's  speech is not \n\"fleeting\"  like the  speech in  [*30]  C.F.  Rather,  Johnson's  speech was  quite permanent,  as  evidenced by the  fact that the \nbanners were  displayed for years.  To permit Johnson to redisplay his banners in their entirety to  a captive  audience  of \nstudents  on a daily basis would violate the  Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment.  Thus, the balancing test of \nPickering tips 1 favor of restricting Johnson from displaying his banners in his  classroom. \nAlternatively,  should this  court decide that the  Garcetti gloss  on the Pickering balancing test applies, the  scales tip \neven further in the  School's  favor.  According to  Garcetti,  the  focus  should not be  on the  content of the  speech,  but on\nPage  10 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *30 \nthe  role the  speaker occupied when the  speech was made. /d.  at  1960.  Accordingly,  Garcetti held that the First \nAmendment does not protect employees’  \"expressions made pursuant to their official  duties.\" /d.  Thus,  Johnson's  First \nAmendment protections  are  substantially  outweighed because  is  only permitted to  display items  in the  classroom \nbecause he  is  a teacher.  So by  extension, the messages  on the banners were  displayed as part of his  official  duties,  as \nthey impart information to  students  during the  school  [*31]  day. \n4.  Johnson's  banners  also violate the  School's  policies. \nAn additional reason  supporting the  School's removal  of the banners is that the  display  of the banners violates \nSchool Policy  and Procedure.  Under AP  3.11.2, teachers  are  expected to refrain from using  classroom teacher influence \nto promote partisan or sectarian viewpoints.\"  Exh.  \"C,\"  p.  3  of 4.  Students  also have  \"the nght to  form and express \nindividual  opinions  on controversial issues without jeopardizing relations with teachers  or others\"  under the policies. \nThe District is  certainly within its rights to remove the banners to  ensure that the  students’  nghts to have  an opinion on \nreligion does not jeopardize their class  standing  should the  students wish to make their opinions known. \n5.  Even using a Hazelwood forum analysis,  the Defendants  still  should  prevail. \nDefendants  do not think that Johnson's  classroom 1s  anon-public  forum.  But as  a fallback position,  even if this \nCourt were to  find that Johnson's  classroom was  a non-public  forum under the Hazelwood n4  analysis,  the  School \nwould  still be within its rights to remove the banners. \nn4 Hazelwood Sch.  Dist.  v.  Kuhlmeier,  484  U.S.  260  (1988) \n[*32] \nThe Ninth Circuit has recognized that in a  \"forum analysis\"  case,  \"Establishment Clause  concerns  can justify \nspeech restrictions  ‘in order to  avoid the  appearance  of government sponsorship  of religion.” Hills,  supra,  329 F.3d at \n1053,  quoting Lassonde,  supra,  320 I’.3d 979 at 983-85,  and citing  Cole,  supra,  228 F.3d 1092,  1103-05.  Here,  for the \nreasons  explained above,  the  Defendants’  concern with violating the  Establishment Clause  is  a legitimate  defense to \nJohnson's  free  speech claims. \nMoreover,  under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Hazelwood,  schools may limit speech that bears the \nimprimatur of the  school when the  speech may place the  school  on one  side  of a controversial  issue:  \"A  school's \ndecision not to promote  or sponsor speech that 1s unsuitable  for immature  audiences,  or which might place it on one  side \nof a controversial  issue,  1s  a judgment call which Haze/wood reposes  in the  discretion of school  officials  and which 1s \nafforded  substantial  deference.  We therefore  conclude that controlling the  content of school-sponsored publications  so \nas to maintain the  appearance  of neutrality  on a controversial issue  [*33]  is within the reserved mission of the  [] \nDistrict.\" Planned Parenthood v.  Clark County School District,  941 F.2d 817,  829  (9th  Cir.1991)  (en banc),  internal \nfootnote  omitted.  The  District meets this test. \nFirst,  there  can be  little  debate that the banners in Johnson's  classroom might be  seen to bear the  imprimatur of the \nschool.  Students have been in plain view  of the banners  as  a captive  audience  for 25  years.  The  fact that the banners \nwere hung inside the  classroom leaves no  doubt that others might view them as having the  stamp  of school  approval, \neven if the  speech is Johnson's  speech.  Certainly when a 7  foot by 2  foot banner is hanging in direct sight of a captive \naudience  of students,  an idea is being imparted,  and this  communication falls within the purview  of Poway Board Policy \n3.11.  And if speech falls within the purview  of a particular policy,  then the public may assume that the  District made  a \ndecision with respect to the  speech under that policy. \nSecond, there is  a legitimate pedagogical reason for the banners'  removal:  the District is  ensuring that as  an entity,  it \nmaintains  its neutrality  on a controversial issue  and does not run afoul  of the  Establishment  [*34]  Clause.  Plaintiff has \nmade no  argument as to why the  District's  concern regarding the Establishment Clause is not legitimate.  Rather Plaintiff\nPage  11 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *34 \nstates  only that  \"[a]s the  alleged facts bear out,  Defendants  did not have  a legitimate pedagogical  concern for prohibiting \nPlaintiff's  speech.\"  Yet the reason is perfectly legitimate.  It continues to be  a controversial  issue  across the  country \nwhether  speech combining the notion of God plus  our nation's heritage 1s  appropriate in the  classroom  setting.  See,  e  .g. \nElk Grove  Unified School Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1  (2004).  The  District has the  discretion not to take  sides  on the \nissue. \n6.  The law is  the same under the California  constitution;  the  School may  regulate teacher speech where the \nteacher is  advocating  a controversial viewpoint. \nTurning to  California law  concerning  free  speech,  \"Article  1,  section 2  of the  California Constitution provides \nindependent protection for free  speech which in certain contexts  exceeds the protection provided by the  First \nAmendment to the United  States  Constitution.\"  California  Teachers Assn.  v.  Governing Board,  45  Cal.App.4th  1383, \n139]  (1996).  But in the  context  [*35]  of the  classroom  activities  of teachers,  the  state  constitutional protection 1s \nidentical to the  federal protection:  \"We  find the  federal  authorities which discuss First Amendment principles in the \nfairly unique  context of school regulation of curricular activities  accurately weigh the  competing interests  of school \nadministrators,  teachers  and  students.  /d. \nSo,  like his First Amendment claim,  Johnson's Fourth Claim for violation of free  speech under the  California \nconstitution also  fails.  This  conclusion is  consistent with the  California  Teachers Assn.  case,  which concluded that \n\"when public  school teachers  and administrators  are teaching  students,  they  act with the  imprimatur of the  school \ndistrict which employs them and ultimately with the  imprimatur of the  state which compels  students to  attend their \nclasses.\" /d.  at 1390.  Accordingly,  the  court held that with respect to teacher speech inside the  classroom,  \"school \nauthorities retain the power to  dissociate themselves  from political  controversy by prohibiting their employees  from \nengaging 1n political  advocacy in instructional  settings.\" /d.  at /39/.  Summary judgment should therefore be  [*36] \nentered on this  claim also. \nB.  Plaintiff's  Second  and  Sixth  Claims  for Violation  of The  Establishment Clause  Fail Because The District's \nPolicies  Do  Not Establish Any Religion  and Are Neutral. \nJohnson contends that Defendants have violated the  Establishment Clause  of both the United States  and California \nconstitutions by attempting to  coerce him to  change his religious belief.  There  are three tests used in the  context of a \nschool by the U.S.  Supreme  Court to  determine whether the Establishment Clause has been violated.  Santa Fe \nIndependent School District v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  147 L.Ed.2d 295,  120 S.Ct.  2266 (2000). \nThe Lemon test,  discussed earlier,  states that there is no violation under these  circumstances:  (1) the  government's \naction must have  a  secular purpose;  (2) its principal  and primary  effect must be  one that neither advances nor inhibits \nreligion;  and (3) it must not foster excessive  government entanglement with religion.  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602, \n612-13  (1971).  This test is  also used by the  California appellate  courts in analyzing Establishment Clause  claims under \nstate  law.  See  Catholic Charities  of Sacramento,  Inc.  v.  Superior Ct.,  32  Cal.4th 527,  546  (Cal.  2004)  [*37]  (cert. \ndenied  /25 S.Ct.  53). \nThe  \"endorsement\"  test collapses the  first two prongs  of the Lemon test,  and  \"captures the  essential  command of \nthe  Establishment Clause, namely,  that government must not make  a person's religious beliefs relevant to his  or her \nstanding in the political  community by conveying  a message that religion or a particular religious belief is  favored or \npreferred.\"  County of Allegheny v.  ACLU,  492  U.S.  573,  627  (1989)  (quoting  Wallace  v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  69 \n(O'Connor,  J.  concurring in judgment)). \nFinally,  the  coercion test states that  \"at a minimum,  the  Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce \nanyone to  support or participate  in religion or its  exercise,  or otherwise to  act in a way which establishes  a state religion \nor religious  faith,  or tends to  do  so.\"  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  377,  587  (1992).\nPage  12 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *37 \nHere,  the District's  decision to have  Johnson remove his banners  from display in his  classroom had a secular \npurpose.  The  Board Policies  and Regulations require that teachers refrain from espousing  a  single viewpoint when \nteaching  controversial issues,  and that teachers be  inclusive  [*38]  of various points  of view.  See  Exhs.  \"C\"  and  \"D.\" \nPursuant to the policies  and regulation,  District restricted the  display of the banners because the messages  on the \nbanners were partisan and sectarian in nature.  The purpose  of the removal was  so that one viewpoint would not be \npromoted over another,  the  opposite  of what Johnson is  claiming with respect to his  Establishment Clause  claim. \nFurthermore, there was no  entanglement with religion here because the  Defendants’  actions  do not deprive  Johnson of \nproviding his  opinion concerning religion outside  of the  school gates,  or forbidding him keeping the phrases  on the \nbanners  in a desk  drawer so that he  can view them daily  (or even a very  small version not in plain view  of the  students), \nand because the  goal  of the Defendants was to not advance  any one particular religion. \nCalifornia also uses the Lemon test to  determine whether a government act violates the  Establishment Clause  of \nArticle  I,  section 4.  See DiLoreto  v.  Board of Education,  74  Cal.App.4th 267,  275-276 (1999).  So  Defendants’  actions \ndo not violate the Establishment Clause  of Article  I,  §  4  of California Constitution either. \nIn  short,  the  actions  [*39]  of the  school  officials  in this  case were  consistent with the requirements under the \nLemon test and therefore  Johnson's  claims  for violations  of the  Establishment Clauses  of both the  Federal  and State \nConstitutions  fail.  Defendants  are  entitled to judgment on these  claims. \nC.  Johnson's  Third  Claim for Violation  of the Equal Protection  Clause Fails  Because There Are No  Facts \nIndicating Johnson Was  Treated  Differently From  Similarly-Situated  Employees. \nTo  establish a claim under the  Equal Protection Clause,  Johnson must  show that Defendants’  actions in following \nDistrict policy resulted in the him receiving  disparate treatment compared to  other similarly-situated employees.  See \nCity of Cleburne v.  Cleburne Living Center,  473  U.S.  432,  439  (1985).  Equal protection claims require  strict scrutiny if \nthe  legislation discriminates  against a suspect class  or impinges upon a fundamental night.  Nordlinger v.  Hahn,  505  U.S. \nI,  10  (1992).  The Equal  Protection Clause may give rise to  a cause  of action even if the plaintiff does not allege \nmembership  in a class  or group.  See  Village  of Willowbrook v.  Olech,  528  U.S.  562,  564  (2000).  [*40]  However,  this \ntype  of equal protection challenge  is  evaluated under a rational-basis test to  determine whether the legislation at issue  is \nrational  or wholly  arbitrary.  Conti v.  City of Fremont,  919 F.2d 1385,  1389  (9th  Cir. 1990).  In equal protection claims \nbrought by  a  \"class  of one,\"  the plaintiff must allege that he has been intentionally treated differently  from others \nsimilarly  situated and that there is no rational basis  for the  difference  in treatment.  See Sioux City Bridge  Co.  v.  Dakota \nCounty,  260  U.S.  441,  445  (1923); Allegheny Pittsburgh  Coal Co.  v.  Commission  of Webster Cty.,  488  U.S.  336  (1989). \nHere,  as previously explained,  Defendants  actions  did not impinge  on any  fundamental right of Johnson.  He  1s  free \nto hold his  own religious beliefs.  But his First Amendment rights to  display his banners  are  outweighed by the  District's \ninterest in preventing  an Establishment Clause violation,  and the banners,  as they were  displayed,  violate the \nEstablishment Clause. \nThe  School is not trying to  eradicate the notion of God or religion from its  classroom,  as Johnson has intimated in \nhis  complaint.  Rather,  the  opposite is true.  [*41]  Johnson was provided materials by the  School which contained  some \nof the  same phrases  on his banner,  but in their historical national  context.  To that end,  that he  could have pictures  of \ncoinage  or money  containing the phrase  \"In God We  Trust.\"  Exh.  K.\"  The  School  offered him the  option of displaying  a \nposter containing the text of the  Declaration of Independence, which includes the words  \"creator\"  and  \"God.\"  Exh.  \"K.\" \nThe  School had no problem with Johnson displaying the  \"Pledge  of Allegiance\"  in its  entirety,  including the  line  \"one \nnation under God.\"  \"Exh.  K.\"  He  could also  display all  of the  lyrics to the  song  \"God Bless America.\"  These  items,  if \nposted in their context,  would alleviate  any Establishment Clause  entanglement.  Johnson,  however,  refused to  display \nthese  items in lieu of his banner.  Exh.  \"F,\"  Johnson Depo.,  pp.  128:25-130:4. \nJohnson may  contend in opposition to this motion that he  is being treated differently than another Poway teacher, \nLoni  Brickley,  who has what apparently are known as  \"Tibetan prayer flags\"  displayed in her classroom.  Exh.  \"J,\"\nPage  13 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *41 \nBrickley Depo.,  pp.  86:18-87:18.  Exh.  \"L,\";  Exh.  \"I,\"  Collins  Depo.,  p.  95:14-18.  The  flags,  like Johnson's banners,  are \n[*42]  non-curricular personal items in nature,  but contrary to  Johnson's  contentions,  Brickley  and Johnson have not \nbeen treated differently. \nUnlike Johnson's banners,  Brickley's  flags  do not violate the Establishment clause because they have  a secular \npurpose,  do not advance religion over non-religion,  and do not excessively  entangle the  District with the  support of a \nparticular religion.  Brickley's prayer flags  are  in a language,  Sanskrit, that no person at the  school  (student or otherwise) \nhas been able to read.  Exh.  \"J,\"  Brickley Depo.,  pp.  88:17-89:6.  The prayer flags  are  decorative  in nature,  and an \ninteresting artifact in that they are  sold at the bottom of Mount Everest and placed on top  of the mountain when \nclimbers reach the top,  as Brickley informs her  students who  ask.  Exh.  \"J,\"  Brickley Depo., pp.  87:20-  90:6;  Exh.  \"E,\" \nBrickley herself maintains that religion does not belong in the  classroom (Exh.  \"J,\"  p.  118:6-8),  so  she 1s hardly \ndisplaying the banners  for the purpose  of promoting  a religion.  The banners have the  secular purpose  of motivating her \nstudents to  achieve  lofty goals,  like mountain climbers trying to reach Everest's  summit.  Exh.  \"J,\"  Brickley Depo., p. \n89:7-22.  There  [*43]  is  a  small  figure  on  some  flags that appears to be Buddhist in nature, but it is not prominent (Exh. \n\"L\").  And like the words  God and Creator in a full  display  of text from the  Declaration of Independence  (Exh.  \"K\"),  the \nreligious  significance  is  far lesser than the whole  of what it represents. \nIf the  alternative materials the  School provided to  Johnson (which he  chose not to  display)  do not violate the \nEstablishment Clause  or School policy,  then neither do the prayer flags in Brickley's  classroom.  Johnson 1s being treated \nthe  same with respect to  display of speech touching  on religion as  any  other teacher. \nFinally,  the  District's policies have  a legitimate  state  interest in ensuring that all points  of view,  and not one  single \nviewpoint,  1s heard by the  students in the  classroom.  The  District felt that Johnson's banners  did not comply with the \nDistrict's policy  of inclusion of all viewpoints,  and had him remove the banners.  The District's  decision was therefore \nnarrowly tailored to  achieve  an important government interest. \nFor the  above reasons,  Johnson's Equal Protection claim fails  as  a matter of law. \nD.  Johnson's  Fifth  Claim  For Violation  of the  California's  \"No Preference\"  [*44]  Clause Fails  Because  The \nDefendants Did  Not Show A Preference For Religion;  Rather They Wanted  To  Keep  Their Classrooms \nReligion-Neutral. \nCalifornia's No  Preference  Clause reads:  \"Free  exercise  and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or \npreference  are  guaranteed.\"  Cal.  Const.  art.  I,  §  4.  \"California courts have  interpreted the No  Preference  Clause to \nrequire that the government neither prefer one religion over another nor appear to  act preferentially.\"  Brown  v. \nWoodland  Joint  Unified School Dist,  27 F.3d 1373,  1384  (9th  Cir.  1994),  citing Sands v.  Morongo  Unif.  Sch.  Dist.,  53 \nCal. 3d 863,  872-878  (1991),  cert.  denied,  505  U.S.  1218  (1992). \nHere,  there  are no  facts to  suggest that the Defendants removed Johnson's banners with an eye to  advancing  one \nreligion over another.  On the  contrary,  the  Defendants were  concerned that Johnson himself was  one trying to  advance \nhis religion over non-religion and over other religions by hanging his banners.  The intent of the  school was to maintain \nneutrality  concerning religion.  Hence,  this  claim  should be  dismissed as well. \nE.  The Damages  Claim Against The  Individual Defendants  [*45]  Should  Be Dismissed  Due To  Their  Qualified \nImmunity. \nJohnson's  FAC prays  for nominal  damages  against the  individual  defendants in their individual  capacities.  Doc. \n#17,  p.  17.  The  damages  claim  should be  dismissed because the  individual  defendants  enjoy  qualified immunity. \nQualified immunity  shields public  employees who perform  discretionary functions  from liability  for civil  damages \nwhere  \"their conduct does not violate  clearly established statutory  or constitutional rights  of which a reasonable person\nPage  14 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75415,  *45 \nwould have known.\" Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  818  (1982).  Qualified immunity  shields them from civil \ndamages liability  as long  as their actions  could reasonably have been thought to be  consistent with the rights they  are \nalleged to have violated. Anderson  v.  Creighton,  483  U.S.  635,  638  (1987). \n\"When governmental  officials  assert the  defense  of qualified immunity to  an action under 42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  a court \nevaluating the  defense must first determine whether the plaintiff has  alleged the  deprivation of a constitutional right and, \nif so,  then determine  'whether the right was  clearly established at the time  of the  [*46]  alleged violation.\"  Cole  v. \nOroville  Union High School Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092,  1101  (9th  Cir.  2000). \nHere,  the Defendants’  actions  fell well within the policies  and law provided by the  School District,  and  so the  Court \nshould find that there was no unlawfulness with respect to the  state  laws  and the  School's policies under pre-existing \nlaw. Anderson,  supra,  483  U.S.  at 640.  The  current  state  of the law gave Defendants no reason to believe that their \ndecision to remove materials  from Johnson's  classroom was unconstitutional,  especially in light of the Berry and Peloza \ncases  cited  infra.  Therefore,  the individual  defendants  are  entitled to  qualified immunity  against Johnson's  damages \nclaims  in this  case. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nSchools  are places  of learning,  and Johnson 1s  a teacher at a  school.  It is his job to  impart wisdom to  students.  And \nhe has  certain First Amendment nights.  But school  districts  also must navigate the  difficult course between the  Scylla of \nnot respecting its  employee's  First Amendment rights  and the  Charybdis  of violating the Establishment Clause  of the \nFirst Amendment by  appearing to  endorse religion.  See Berry,  supra,  447 F.3d at 645.  [*47]  Here, the Defendants \nsuccessfully navigated those waters.  Johnson's banners unduly promote the  Christian religion because the religious \naspects  of the banners  overwhelm the national heritage implications.  Johnson was  offered alternative materials that \nwould place the phrases  on the banners in context, highlighting the national heritage  aspects,  and diminishing  any \nEstablishment Clause  concerns,  while not scrubbing religion from the  classroom,  as would be  against School policy. \nThis was the  correct course  of conduct.  Accordingly,  the motion  should be granted. \nDATED:  August  14,  2009 \nSTUTZ ARTIANO  SHINOFF  & HOLTZ \nA Professional  Corporation \nBy:  /s/ Paul V.  Carelli,  [V \nDaniel R.

INTRODUCTION \nThis  is not a  \"forum\"  analysis  case,  as Plaintiff Johnson would have this  Court rule.  Plaintiff is not a private  citizen \nin the  context of this  case;  rather,  he is  an employee  of a public  entity.  That public  entity,  the  School,  may limit teacher \nspeech when that speech runs  afoul  of the  Establishment Clause.\n  \nPage 2 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *1 \nMr.  Johnson  specifically  selected five phrases relating to  God from  songs  and other patriotic/historical material. \nJohnson did not choose  any phrases  from this historical material that did not reference  God or a Creator.  The  school \ngave him the  option of putting those  five phrases in historical/  [*2]  practical  context,  such as posting the  entire text of \nthe  Declaration of Independence,  and Mr.  Johnson refused.  This refusal  shows that Mr.  Johnson is not interested in the \nhistorical aspect of the phrases,  only the  re/igious  aspect of the phrases. \nHad Mr.  Johnson posted a  single phrase  from the  \"striped\"  banner,  instead of all  four,  there would not be  an issue; \nthe  School would have permitted the phrase to  stand.  But when all  four phrases  are viewed together,  along with the \n\"Creator\"  banner where the word  \"Creator\"  is highlighted,  then the patriotic nature  of the  individual phrases  1s \nde-emphasized,  and the religious nature  of the phrases  emphasized,  changing the nature  of the words  from patriotic to \ndevotional.  If one phrase is permissible,  then how many phrases  concerning  God does  it take to  cross the line  from \ndrawing  a historical reference  into  an entanglement with religion violative  of the Establishment Clause?  Three?  Ten? \nThe Defendants  suggest that the  line  1s  crossed when  school  administrators reasonably believe that there has been an \nentanglement that promotes  one religion over another or over no religion.  And here,  the  School  administrators \nreasonably believed that  [*3]  the  five phases in the  classroom crossed the line. \nOn balance,  the  Defendants had every nght to maintain their mission to be  free  from religious promotion in the \nschool  classroom.  Mr.  Johnson's  free  speech rights  are  outweighed by the  School's rights to be  free  from an \nEstablishment Clause violation. \nIl.  FACTS \nThe Defendants’  recitation of facts  can be  found in part II  of its points  and authorities  in  support of their motion for \nsummary judgment.  Doc.  #55-2.  The District objects  on relevance grounds to the multitude  of photographs  of other \nclassroom items  submitted by Johnson.  Those items  are not germane  as to whether Mr.  Johnson's banners violate the \nEstablishment Clause. \nBut the  core  facts  are not in dispute:  Mr.  Johnson displayed two banners in his  classroom on a continuous basis that \ncould be read by his  students.  One was the  \"striped\"  banner and one was the  \"CREATOR\"  banner.  Mr.  Johnson was \nasked to remove the banners by the  School,  and he  complied.  The  legal issue  is whether the  School was permitted to  do \nso  on grounds that the banners unconstitutionally promoted one religion over another and religion over non-religion. \nII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Schools  Have  [*4]  The Authority To  Control Conduct In  Their  Learning  Environments, And  Therefore \nJohnson's  Free  Speech  Claims  Fail. \nPlaintiff begins his points  and authorities by quoting  Tinker v.  Des Moines Indep.  Community School Dist.,  393 \nU.S.  503  (1969)  for the proposition that teachers  do not  shed their constitutional rights  at the  schoolhouse gates.  Doc. \n#43-2, p.  1.  But Plaintiff ignores the more  compelling  quote  from  Tinker that applies to this  case:  \"[T]he  Court has \nrepeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the  comprehensive  authority  of the  States  and of school  officials, \nconsistent with fundamental  constitutional  safeguards,  to prescribe  and control  conduct in the  schools.\"  7inker,  393  U.S. \n503,  506-07. \nTo that end,  \"the interest of the  State  in avoiding  an Establishment Clause violation 'may be  [a]  compelling’  one \njustifying  an abridgement of free  speech otherwise protected by the  First Amendment....\"  Lamb's Chapel v.  Center \nMoriches  Union Free School Dist.,  508  U.S.  384  (1993)  (quoting  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271  (1981)).  This \nprinciple  applies  in this  case.  The  Defendants’  interest in avoiding  [*5]  an Establishment Clause violation trumps \nJohnson's right to  free  speech. \n1.  The  Forum Analysis  Test Is  Not Proper Here.\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *5 \nThe Defendants  do not disagree that Johnson's banners  constitute  \"speech.\"  The Defendants  also  do not disagree \nthat public  school teachers have  First Amendment nghts.  See  7inker v.  Des Moines Independent Community School \nDistrict,  393  U.S.  503,  506  (1969).  But those rights  are not unlimited. \nThe  question, then,  is what test this  court  should apply to  determine whether teacher classroom  speech generally, \nand Johnson's  speech  specifically,  warrants  First Amendment protection.  Johnson asserts that a traditional  forum \nanalysis  is  applicable,  contending that this  case  involves the use  of public property for expressive purposes.  Doc.  43-2, \npp.  8-9. \nBut Johnson misses the bigger picture by  setting the parameters too broadly.  This  case is not about any member of \nthe public  speaking to  students,  or students  speaking to  students.  Rather, this  case  is  about a public  employee's rights to \nspeech vis-a-vis his public  employer's right to protect its  own legitimate interests in performing its mission of educating \nkids.  And that type  of balancing 1s  exactly  [*6]  what 1s  called for here,  consistent with Pickering v.  Bd.  of Educ.,  391 \nU.S.  563  (1968).  The Pickering balancing test requires  a court evaluating restraints  on a public  employee's  speech to \nbalance  \"the  interests  of the  [employee],  as  a citizen,  in commenting upon matters  of public  concern and the  interest of \nthe  State,  as  an employer,  in promoting the  efficiency  of the public  services it performs through its  employees.\"  City of \nSan Diego  v.  Roe,  543  U.S.  77,  82  (2004)  (quoting Pickering,  391  U.S.  at 568). \n2.  The Ninth  Circuit uses  a Pickering-style balancing  test to  decide whether a  public employer may  restrict \nemployee  speech,  not a  \"forum analysis.\" \nIn ruling  on the  School's motion to  dismiss,  this  Court ruled that the balancing test of Pickering v.  Bd.  of Educ.,  391 \nU.S.  563  (1968)  would not be useful in this  case because the Ninth Circuit uses  a  \"forum analysis\"  for school  speech \ncases.  Doc.  #25, p.  6.  nl  However, none  of the  cases  cited by this  Court in reaching that conclusion involved a public \nemployer's limitation on an employee's  speech.  So those  cases  are  distinguishable,  and the  Defendants  [*7]  respectfully \ndisagree that forum analysis  is  applicable here. \nnl  Citing  Truth v.  Kent School District,  524 F.3d 957,  972  (9th  Cir.2008)  (applying  forum analysis); Flint \nv.  Dennison,  458 F.3d 816,  830  (9th  Cir.2007)  (applying forum analysis); Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified School \nDist.  No.  48,  329 F.3d 1044,  1048-50  (9th  Cir.2003)  (applying  forum analysis);  and Downs v.  Los Angeles \nUnified School Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003,  1009-11  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (declining to  apply forum analysis where  speech at \nissue belongs to the  school  district). \nAccordingly, the Defendants reiterate their prior argument that the balancing test of Pickering 1s proper here \nbecause the  case  involves the  Defendants’  limitation of Johnson's workplace  speech as  an employee. \n3.  The Peloza  Case:  Teachers  May Not Evangelize  In  the Public-School Classroom. \nUnder Ninth Circuit jurisprudence, there is no  question that a  school  district may prevent a teacher from  speaking \nabout  [*8]  religion on a school  campus  in an effort to  avoid an Establishment Clause violation.  Peloza v.  Capistrano \nUnified Sch.  Dist.,  37 F.3d 517,  522-523  (9th  Cir. 1994).  In Peloza,  a teacher claimed,  in part, that his  free  speech rights \nwere violated by the  school  district where he taught,  where the  school  district told the teacher that he was to refrain \nfrom evangelizing  Christianity  or initiating  conversations  about his religious beliefs.  /d.  at 522.  The Ninth Circuit \ninitially  determined that the teacher's  \"ability to talk with  students  about religion during the  school  day is  a restriction on \nhis right of free  speech.\" /d.  However,  the Pe/oza  court found the  school  district's restriction on the teacher's  speech to \nbe permissible because the  school  district's right to be  free  from an Establishment Clause violation trumped the teacher's \nspeech rights. /d. \nIn reaching this  conclusion,  the Pe/oza  court stated that whether in the  classroom or not during contract hours, the \nteacher  \"is not just any  ordinary  citizen.  He  1s  a teacher.  He  is  one  of those  especially respected persons  chosen to teach\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *8 \nin the high  school's  classroom.  He  1s  clothed  [*9]  with the mantle  of one who  imparts knowledge  and wisdom.  His \nexpressions  of opinion are  all the more believable because he is  a teacher.  The  likelihood of high  school  students \nequating his views with those  of the  school 1s  substantial.  To permit him to  discuss his religious beliefs with students \nduring  school time  on  school grounds would violate the Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment.\" /d.  To that end, \nthe Pe/oza  court cited with approval the  case  of Roberts v. Madigan,  921  F.2d 1047,  1056-58  (10th  Cir.1990)  (teacher \ncould be prohibited from reading Bible  during  silent reading period,  and from  stocking two books  on Christianity  on \nshelves, because these things  could leave  students with the  impression that Christianity was  officially  sanctioned),  cert. \ndenied,  505  U.S.  1218,  112 S.Ct.  3025,  120 L.E-d.2d 896  (1992). \n4.  The Berry  Case:  The Pickering balancing  test applies  to workplace  speech  and  displays  of public \nemployees. \nThe Pe/oza court's  approach to public  employee religious  speech was  cited with approval  in the  later Ninth Circuit \ncase  of Berry v.  Department of Social Services,  447 F.3d 642,  650  (9th  Cir.  2006).  [*10]  The Berry case 1s  also \nimportant because  it utilized the  dichotomy of the Pickering test on one hand,  and the  \"forum analysis\"  test on the  other \nhand,  for two very different purposes.  Specifically,  the Ninth Circuit applied a slight variation of the Pickering test for \nemployee workplace  speech,  whereas  it applied a forum analysis test to  determine the restriction on use  of a public \nentity's physical  space to hold prayer meetings. \nIn Berry,  a county  social  services  department employee  sued his  employer,  alleging that the  department's rules \nrestricting him from discussing religion with clients,  displaying religious  items  in his  cubicle,  and using a conference \nroom for prayer meetings,  violated his  free  speech and free  exercise nghts under the  First Amendment,  and violated \nTitle  VII.  Berry,  447 I’. 3d at 645.  The  District Court granted summary judgment for the  county department,  and the \nemployee  appealed.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment.  /d. \na.  The free speech  issues  in  Berry were  decided under a Pickering balancing test. \nWith respect to the  free  speech claims,  the  employee's primary  duties were to  assist unemployed and \nunderemployed  [*11]  clients  in their transition out of welfare programs.  These  duties  frequently required the  employee \nto  conduct client interviews.  The  department told the  employee that he  could not talk about religion with clients  and the \nagencies the  employees  contacted,  but that he was permitted to talk  about religion with his  colleagues.  Berry,  447 F.3d \nat 646.  The  employee  also  displayed a Spanish-language  Bible  on his  desk,  and hung a  sign that read  \"Happy Birthday \nJesus\"  on the wall  of his  cubicle.  /d.  at 647.  The  department told him to remove the Bible  from view  of clients,  and to \nremove the word  \"Jesus\"  from the  sign on his  cubicle. /d. \nThe Berry court applied the Pickering balancing test to uphold the  agency's rule  forbidding employees to  discuss \nreligion with clients:  \"While it allowed employees to  discuss religion among themselves,  it avoided the  shoals  of the \nEstablishment Clause by forbidding them from  discussing religion with its  clients.\" Berry,  447 I’. 3d at 657;  see  Waters \nv.  Churchill,  511  U.S.  661,  668  (1994)  [for a government employee's  speech to be protected,  \"the  speech must be  on a \nmatter of public  [*12]  concern,  and the  employee's  interest in expressing herself on this matter must not be  outweighed \nby any injury the  speech could cause to  'the interest of the  State,  as  an employer,  in promoting the  efficiency  of the \npublic  services  it performs through its  employees\")  (citations  omitted)]. \nThe Berry court also  applied the Pickering test to uphold the  agency's rule restricting  employees  from prominently \ndisplaying religious  1tems:  \"Similarly,  the Department allowed employees to  display religious  items,  except where their \nviewing by the Department's  clients might imply  endorsement thus  evading the reef of the  Establishment Clause.\" /d. \n\"[T]he Pickering balancing  approach applies regardless  of the reason an employee believes his  or her speech 1s \nconstitutionally protected,\"  whether as  commentary on matters  of public  concern or whether the  employee  asserts First \nAmendment protections  for religious  speech.  Berry,  447 F.3d at 649-50. \nThe Berry court's  application of the balancing test cited as precedent the  cases  of Pe/oza  (discussed above)  and\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *12 \nTucker v.  State  of Cal.  Dept.  of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204  (9th  Cir.  1996).  In  Tucker,  [*13]  the public  employer provided its \nemployee  (Tucker) with orders prohibiting him  from discussing religion in the workplace  and displaying religious \nitems.  Tucker contended on appeal that the  orders must pass  strict scrutiny  \"because the government has  created a \nlimited purpose public  forum 1n its  offices by allowing its  employees both to  discuss  'public  questions when they \nassemble  informally  at their desks,  drinking  fountains,  lunch rooms,  copy machines,  etc.’  and to  display written \nmaterials  in and around their offices  and cubicles.\" /d.  at 1209. \nThe Ninth Circuit rejected that argument:  \"In Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Defense Fund,  473  U.S.  788,  802,  105 \nS.Ct.  3439,  3449,  87 L.kd.2d 567 (1985),  the  Court stated,  '[t]he government does not create  a public  forum by inaction \nor by permitting limited discourse,  but only by  intentionally opening  a nontraditional  forum for public  discourse.’ \n(emphasis  added).  Assuming that Tucker and his  co-workers talked about whatever they wanted to  at work  (before the \npassage  of the  challenged order),  and that they posted all  sorts  of materials  on the walls,  that still would not  show that \nthe  government had intentionally  [*14]  opened up the workplace  for public  discourse.\"  Tucker,  97 F.3d at 1209.  The \nTucker court instead reviewed a public  employer's  limitations  on an employee's religious  speech pursuant to the \n\"applicable  doctrine,  which is  found in the  case law governing employee  speech in the workplace.\" /d.  at 1209-10, \nciting Pickering. \nConsistent with Berry,  this  Court should utilize the variation on the Pickering balancing test,  which the Ninth \nCircuit uses  for speech by  an employee in the workplace  (regardless  of whether the  speech consists  of words  spoken \naloud or a display of items  constituting  speech in the workplace).  Johnson's banners were  even more prominently \ndisplayed than the plaintiff in Berry,  because Johnson's banners were not inside the wall  of an office  cubicle,  but were  in \nplain view in his  classroom,  where they  could be  seen by  all  of his  students.  Moreover,  Johnson's banners were very \nlarge,  and easily could be read from locations  in the  classroom where  students would normally  sit.  Such  speech must be \nbalanced against Poway's right to protect its  own interests in avoiding  an Establishment clause violation. \nb.  The forum  analysis  [*15]_  in Berry applied only  to  the  use  of a conference  room for prayer meetings. \nThe Berry case  also  shows when a forum analysis would be  applicable  -  and shows that its use would not be  suited \nto this  case.  In Berry,  the  employee  organized a monthly employee prayer meeting that was to take place  an unused \nconference room in the  department's  facility.  The prayer meetings were voluntary and were held over lunch.  Berry,  447 \nF.3d at 646.  The  department told Mr.  Berry that he  could not use the  conference room for these meetings,  because use \nby a particular group  of a  \"non-public\"  conference room  at the  facility would open up the room's use to  all  groups.  /d.  at \n647. \nFor this particular complaint,  the Berry court relied on a traditional  forum analysis,  rather than the Pickering \nbalancing test,  to resolve the  constitutional issues  associated with the use  of work  site premises  for prayer meetings \napplying,  inter alia,  Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Defense  & Educational Fund,  473  U.S.  788  (1985).  As the Berry court \nexplained,  the  department's rules  \"did not prohibit its  employees  from holding prayer meetings  in the  common  [*16] \nbreak room or outside,\"  but closed one particular conference room  \"to  employee  social  or religious meetings  such as \nmight convert the  conference room into  a public  forum.” Berry,  447 F.3d at 657,  653  (finding  from an analysis  of the \nuses  of the  conference room it  \"remains  a non-public  forum,\"  because  \"the  only permitted use  of the room that was not \ngenerally  associated with the Department's  administrative  duties was  for birthday parties  and baby  showers\").  Berry \nconcluded,  applying forum analysis  standards,  those restrictions  on the  civil rights  of its  employees to  exercise their \nreligion using  a government facility with circumscribed permitted uses  \"were reasonable,  and the Department's reasons \nfor imposing them outweigh any resulting curtailment of Mr.  Berry's rights under the  First Amendment of the  United \nStates  Constitution  ....\" /d. \nHere,  Johnson is not interested in holding prayer meetings in unused non-public portions  of Westview High  School \nor the  District Office.  Nor does he  seek to  display his banners  inside unused rooms  for any portion of time.  Simply  said, \nJohnson's  classroom 1s not a facility open to the public to hold meetings  or speak  during  [*17]  the  school  day.  Rather,  it \nis  only Johnson who wishes to  display the banners in his  classroom to  students  and whoever else happens to be inside\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *17 \nthe  classroom.  That is  strictly  employee  speech,  and therefore the Pickering balancing test 1s more  suited to the  analysis \nthan the  forum analysis  applicable to use  of public  facilities. \n5.  Mr.  Johnson's  Banners Are Not  \"Private\"  Speech \nJohnson also  contends that his  speech is  \"private\"  speech on public grounds,  citing Arizona Life  Coal.,  Inc.,  v. \nStanton,  515 F.3d 956,  968  (9th  Cir 2008).  Doc.  43-2,  p.  8.  This  characterization 1s in error. \nThe issue in Arizona Life was whether the  State  of Arizona violated an advocacy group's First Amendment right to \nfree  speech by  arbitrarily  denying the group's  application for a special  Arizona organization license plate that would \nportray its message  \"Choose  Life.\" Arizona Life,  515 F.3d at 960.  The  case  specifically  dealt with the  government \nregulation of private  speech in a forum created by the government. \nThe  case  does not apply to  Johnson's  circumstances,  because  Johnson is not speaking  as  a private  citizen,  he  is \nspeaking as  an employee  of the  [*18]  Poway Unified School  District.  It is undisputed that Johnson is  a math teacher. \nHis job  is to  educate high school  students.  Had Johnson not been a teacher,  then he would have no nght to  decorate  a \nclassroom.  Under the  School's policies  and practices,  teachers,  not others,  have the right to  display items in their \nrespective  classrooms,  within certain limits.  Defs.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Doc.  #55-4,  pp.  15-17  (Chiment Depo, pp.  57:15-58:3; \n65:2-6.)  The  fact that Johnson's banners were not used for a curricular purpose  does not change the  fact that they \ncontain speech that can easily be viewed and understood by public  school  students  and others,  all  of whom could \nattribute the  slogans  on the banners to ratification by the  School District.  Furthermore,  if Johnson was not a teacher, \nthen he would not be permitted to  display  anything in a Poway Unified classroom.  In fact,  under the  California \nEducation Code,  if Johnson was not an employee  or parent/guardian of a  student,  he would need permission just to visit \na classroom during the  school  day.  Cal.  Educ.  Code,  §  32211,  subd.  (a).  So this  case  is not about a private  citizen \nspeaking in the  classroom,  it is  a about a school  employee  speaking  [*19]  to  students  and others  on public  school \ngrounds.  Accordingly,  the  forum test used in Arizona Life  does not apply. \n6.  \"Substantial Disruption\"  is  Not The Test, As  Johnson  Suggests. \nJohnson also  contends that the  Defendants  cannot prohibit the banners because the banners  did not  \"materially  and \nsubstantially  disrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school.\"  quoting  7inker,  supra,  393  U.S.  at 513  and Grayned vy.  City \nof Rockford,  408  U.S.  104  (1972).  Doc.  #43-2,  p.  8,  fn.  6. \nThere  are  several problems with Johnson's  assertion,  not the least of which is that Johnson does not fully articulate \nthe  complete test from  7inker.  Under  Tinker,  the  actual test is that a  student may  exercise his right to  freedom of \nexpression unless the  \"conduct by the  student,  in class  or out of 1t,  which for any reason - whether it stems  from time, \nplace,  or type  of behavior -  materially  disrupts  classwork  or involves substantial disorder or invasion  of the rights of \nothers  ....\"  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at p.  513,  emphasis  added.  Johnson's points  and authorities left out the  last part about \ninvading the rights  of others. \nDefendants  [*20]  think that the test in  7inker applies to  students, not teacher employees.  As  Defendants have \nargued,  the Pickering test 1s the test the Ninth Circuit applies in public  employee  cases  like this  one.  The Ninth Circuit's \nuse  of Pickering does not conflict with  7inker because the  Supreme  Court has  explained that based upon its reading of \nits prior precedent,  the  \"substantial  disruption”  test set forth in  7inker is not absolute. Morse v.  l'rederick,  551  U.S.  393, \n405  (2007). \nBut even if the  7inker test did apply to teachers,  Johnson's  speech would invade the  School's right to maintain its \nmission without giving the  appearance  of endorsing its  employee's religious  expression in violation of the Establishment \nClause.  And thus,  even under  Tinker,  the  Defendants would have the nght to remove the banners  at issue. \n7.  Johnson's  \"Striped\"  and  \"Creator\"  banners  cross  the line from heralding  the national heritage to \npromotion  of Judeo-Christianity,  and  therefore  entangle the  School in  religious  advocation in violation  of the\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *20 \nEstablishment Clause. \nJohnson appears to have taken the position that any  speech taken from a national  or historic  origin,  [*21]  even if \ndiscussing God or religion,  gets First Amendment protection, regardless  of how the message is  displayed.  This is  an \noverly broad view  of the  law,  from the  Defendants’  perspective. \na.  The  visual impact of the  banners' configuration and text size  must be  taken  into  consideration. \nJohnson's position disregards the visual impact that speech displayed on banners  or posters  can have.  For example, \nthe words  \"In God We  Trust\"  are the national motto,  and that phrase  does not violate the Establishment Clause when \ndisplayed on coins  or currency.  But what if that phrase was  displayed in a classroom with the word  \"God\"  was \nemphasized and highlighted -wouldn't that be  different?  Take  for example,  a 2'  by 7'  banner that read: \nIn GOD we trust \nThe visual impact is  immediate:  the phrase in this  example has been modified  so that the  emphasis  is  on the word \n\"God.\"  An objective viewer could easily  conclude that the  speaker is  accentuating religious  aspect of the phrase. \nSimilarly,  Johnson's banners  emphasize the religious  aspects  of historical  speech in two ways:  (1)  on the  striped \nbanner,  the word God 1s repeated in each  slogan;  and (2) in the  Creator banner the  [*22]  word  \"Creator\"  1s in ALL \nCAPS  and twice the  size  of the  other words  in the  slogan.  This  combination places religion over history/patriotism. \nIt is not a matter of whether the  speech is  curricular or non-curricular in nature.  According to the  Supreme  Court, \n\"the process  of educating  our youth for citizenship  in public  schools is not confined to books,  the  curriculum,  and the \ncivics  class;  schools must teach by  example the  shared values  of a civilized social  order.  Consciously or otherwise, \nteachers  -  and indeed the  older students  -  demonstrate the  appropriate  form of civil  discourse  and political  expression by \ntheir conduct and deportment in and out of class.  Inescapably,  like parents,  they  are role models.\"  Bethel School Dist. \nNo.  403  v.  Fraser,  478  U.S.  675,  683  (1986).  Furthermore,  curriculum in  schools includes  speech and displays which \nthe  students,  a captive  audience,  will be  subjected to  during the  school  day.  See Lee v.  York County Sch.  Div.,  484 F.3d \n687,  698  (4th  Cir.  2007)  [explaining that religious material  on classroom bulletin boards were  curricular,  as  opposed to \nthe teacher's  own speech,  because the material was  \"constantly present  [*23]  for review by  students in a compulsory \nclassroom  setting.  As  a general proposition,  students  and parents  are  likely to regard a teacher's in-class  speech as \napproved and  supported by the  school,  as  compared to  a teacher's  out-of-class  statements.\"]. \nJohnson's motion paints the Defendants  as biased against any religion and any religious words  or thoughts. \nJohnson's  characterization simply isn't true.  For example,  William Chiment,  the  District's  Associate  Superintendent for \nPersonnel  Services,  testified at his  deposition that a  single poster with the words  \"God Bless  America\"  as  depicted in \nExhibit  \"M\"  (Chiment Depo.  Exhibit 97) would be permitted to be  displayed by  a teacher in a classroom:  \"I  see  it as \npatriotic,  and the  overall impact of it is not the repetition of the theme  of God.  The predominant theme 1s America.  And \nit's  one  single banner.\"  Exh.  \"M,\"  pp.  244:16-245:6.  This  is  a reasonable position for a  school  administrator to take:  the \nadministrator is looking  at the totality  of the  item and making  a determination based not just upon the words  of the \nposter,  but on the  impact and context of the words. \nb.  The slogans on  the  banners,  viewed together,  violate  the Establishment  [*24]  Clause. \nNext,  formally  applying the  facts to the Ninth Circuit's balancing test,  the  scales tip  in favor of the  School \nDefendants because, with respect to the Establishment Clause,  Johnson's banners violate  all three prongs  of the Lemon \ntest.  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602,  612-13  (1971).  First,  the banners  do not have  a secular purpose.  Johnson teaches \nmath.  The banners  are not part of the  curriculum.  And by Johnson's  own admission, the phrases  on the banners were \nchosen not just to promote the nation's heritage,  but also to  espouse religion over non-religion.  Defs.’  Exh.  \"F,\" \np.103:3-22.  This  1s  evidenced by the use  of the word CREATOR on the  \"Declaration\"  banner.  The word  \"CREATOR\"\nPage  8 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *24 \noccupies its  own line,  1s  about twice  as big  as the  other words  on the banner,  and is the  only word in ALL  CAPS,  as if \nshouting to be noticed.  Johnson  said that the reason the word CREATOR 1s bigger is because he wanted to  emphasize  a \nsupreme being's role in giving man his rights.  This  emphasis  does not have  a secular purpose. \nSecond, the principal  and primary effect of the banners  advance religion.  Each of the  five phrases,  standing alone, \nmight not run afoul  of the First Amendment  [*25]  due to the historical implications  of the phrases  (a conclusion that \nSchool  administrators  acknowledge).  But when all  of the phrases  are joined together,  they accumulatively  de-emphasize \nthe historical  aspects  of the  speech,  and instead emphasize the religious  aspects  of the  speech.  The  secondary religious \nmeaning behind each individual phrase becomes the primary meaning when strung together.  In  short,  when viewed in \ntheir totality,  the banners'  message 1s less  about Nation,  and more  about God.  Thus,  the primary effect is to  advance the \nChristian religion.  And the  District provided with alternative material  display that still  contained religious historical  and \npatriotic references,  but in their original  context.  As Principal  Kastner explained with respect to the provision of this \nalternative material  as  opposed to the individual phrases  on Johnson's banners:  \"The issue was never these phrases in \nisolation,  and these phrases were  all not only permitted but encouraged.  I  -  he has posters that include  all  of those \nphrases that can be put on those walls.  It's taking them out of context that was the issue.\"  Kastner Depo.,  Exh.  \"N,\"  p. \n142:25-143:11.  This  is  a reasonable position taken by  [*26]  a principal who  1s  sensitive to both  sides  of the  issue.  And \nwhere  speech  such as  Johnson's is taken out of context to  create  a new meaning  and presentation,  this  Court  should \ndefer to  school  authorities to make their determination of whether speech is permissible:  \"[T]he  determination of what \nmanner of speech in the  classroom or in  school  assembly is  inappropriate properly rests with the  school board,  rather \nthan with the  federal  courts.\" Hazelwood School District v.  Kuhlmeier,  484  U.S.  260,  267  (1988)  (quoting Bethel School \nDistrict No.  403  v.  Fraser,  478  U.S.  675,  683  (internal  citation omitted). \nFinally,  Johnson's banners  foster excessive  government entanglement with religion.  The Ninth Circuit has  said it \nbest with respect to Mr.  Johnson:  He  \"is not just any  ordinary  citizen.  He 1s  a teacher.  He  1s  one  of those  especially \nrespected persons  chosen to teach in the high  school's  classroom.  He 1s  clothed with the mantle  of one who  imparts \nknowledge  and wisdom.  His  expressions  of opinion are  all the more believable because he  is  a teacher.  The  likelihood \nof high  school  students  equating his views with those  of the  school is  substantial.\"  Pe/oza,  supra,  37 F.3d at 522.  [*27] \n\"A teacher appears to  speak  for the  state when he  or  she teaches;  therefore,  the  department may permissibly restrict such \nreligious  advocacy.\"  Tucker v.  California State Dept.  of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204,  1213  (9th  Cir.  1996),  citing Peloza,  37 \nF.3d at 522. \nHere,  Johnson's banners  are both 7  feet by 2  feet with large typeface.  Johnson's banners  can be  easily read by \nstudents  in the  classroom.  Any  student who  does not agree with the notion that God is  a  supreme being  or creator could \nbe intimidated by Johnson's banners. \nIn the  alternative,  the  Defendants  suggest it would also be  appropriate to  apply the  gloss  on the Pickering balancing \ntest first discussed in Garcetti v.  Ceballos,  547  U.S.  410,  421-22  (2006).  If this gloss is  applied,  the  scales tip  even \nfurther in the  School's  favor.  According to  Garcetti,  the  focus  should not be  on the  content of the  speech,  but on the role \nthe  speaker occupied when the  speech was made.  /d.  at  1960.  Accordingly,  Garcetti held that the First Amendment does \nnot protect employees'  \"expressions made pursuant to their official  duties.\" /d.  Thus,  Johnson's  First Amendment \nprotections  are  [*28]  substantially outweighed because is  only permitted to  display items in the  classroom because he 1s \na teacher.  So by  extension, the messages  on the banners were  displayed as part of his  official  duties,  as they impart \ninformation to  students  during the  school  day. \n8.  Even using a Hazelwood forum analysis,  the Defendants  still  should  prevail. \nAs  a fallback position,  in the  event that this  Court were to  find that the Berry/Pickering balancing test does not \napply,  and that Johnson's  classroom was  a limited public  forum under the Hazelwood analysis,  the  School would  still be \nwithin its rights to remove the banners.  Under that legal  analysis,  the  Defendants may  still prevail  if they  show that the \nbanners  constitute  an Establishment Clause violation.  This  is because  avoiding  endorsement of religion is  a \nconstitutional mandate  and therefore  a compelling interest.  Good News Club v.  Milford Cent.  Sch.,  533  U.S.  98,  112-13\nPage  9 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *28 \n(2001)  (citing  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271  (1981)). \nTo that end,  the Ninth Circuit has held that schools may refuse to  allow religious  speech in a  limited public  forum \nwhere  it is necessary to  avoid an Establishment  [*29]  Clause violation.  Cole  v.  Oroville  Union High Sch.  Dist.,  228 \nF.3d 1092  (9th  Cir.2000).  In Cole,  two  students  sued their  school  district,  claiming that the  district violated their \nfreedom of speech by refusing to  allow  one to give  a sectarian,  proselytizing valedictory  speech and the  other to give  a \nsectarian invocation at their graduation.  Cole,  228 F.3d at 1095.  The  court,  in deciding whether the individual  school \nofficials  enjoyed qualified immunity,  found that the  students'  damage  claims  failed because the  officials’  actions were \nreasonably taken to  avoid violating the Establishment Clause  of the First Amendment. /d.  In  supporting its  decision in \nfavor of the  school  officials,  the  Co/e  court explained:  \"We  conclude the  District officials  did not violate the  students’ \nfreedom of speech.  Even assuming the  Oroville  graduation ceremony was  a public  or limited public  forum, the District's \nrefusal to  allow the  students to  deliver a  sectarian speech or prayer as part of the  graduation was necessary to  avoid \nviolating the Establishment Clause under the principles  applied in Santa Fe Independent School District v.  Doe,  530 \nUS.  290,  120 S.Ct.  2266,  147 L.Ed.2d 295  (2000),  [*30]  and Lee v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  577,  112 S.Ct.  2649,  120 \nL.E-d.2d 467  (1992).  [Citiations.]\"  Cole,  228 F.3d at  1101. \nIn cases  decided after Cole,  the Ninth Circuit has  continued to  endorse the  concept that the  government can \ndistinguish and exclude proselytizing religious  speech to preserve the purpose  for a limited forum.  See,  e.g., Prince  v. \nJacoby,  303 F.3d 1074,  1086-87  (9th  Cir.2002)  (finding that while  student religious  group must be given equal  access \nto  school's public  address  system to  announce  its  activities,  the  group may be barred from  doing  so to  \"pray  and \nproselytize\");  and Lassonde v.  Pleasanton  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  320 F.3d 979,  980  (9th  Cir.2003)  (prohibiting \nproselytizing in high  school  graduation  speech) \nMoreover,  under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Hazelwood,  schools may limit speech that bears the \nimprimatur of the  school when the  speech may place the  school  on one  side  of a controversial  issue:  \"A  school's \ndecision not to promote  or sponsor speech that is unsuitable  for immature  audiences,  or which might place it on one  side \nof a controversial  issue,  1s  a judgment call which  [*31]  Hazelwood reposes  in the  discretion of school  officials  and \nwhich is  afforded  substantial  deference.  We therefore  conclude that controlling the  content of school-sponsored \npublications  so  as to maintain the  appearance  of neutrality  on a controversial  issue  is within the reserved mission of the \n[]  District.\"  Planned Parenthood v.  Clark County School District,  941 F.2d 817,  829  (9th  Cir.1991)  (en banc),  internal \nfootnote  omitted.  Should this  Court apply Hazelwood to teacher speech (rather than  student speech), then the  District \nmeets this test. \nFirst,  there  can be  little  debate that the banners in Johnson's  classroom might be  seen to bear the  imprimatur of the \nschool.  Students have been in plain view  of the banners  as  a captive  audience  for 25  years.  The  fact that the banners \nwere hung inside the  classroom leaves no  doubt that others might view them as having the  stamp  of school  approval, \neven if the  speech is Johnson's  speech.  Certainly when a 7  foot by 2  foot banner is hanging in direct sight of a captive \naudience  of students,  an idea is being imparted,  and this  communication falls within the purview  of Poway Board Policy \n3.11.  And if speech falls within  [*32]  the purview  of a particular policy,  then the public may assume that the  District \nmade  a decision with respect to the  speech under that policy. \nSecond, there is  a legitimate pedagogical reason for the banners'  removal:  the District is  ensuring that as  an entity,  it \nmaintains  its neutrality  on a controversial issue  and does not run afoul  of the  Establishment Clause. \nFinally,  Johnson suggests that 1t is unfair to him that other issues be permitted by the  school  district to be  on \ndisplay,  such as gay rights  issues,  for example.  Johnson does not go  into  detail in his  arguments  as to what aspect of \ntolerance  of civil rights  invades his  constitutional rights  as  a teacher.  But to  clarify,  the  School has  an  \"affirmative \nobligation\"  under the  California Education code  \"to  combat racism,  sexism,  and other forms  of bias\"  including  sexual \norientation.  Cal.  Educ.  Code,  §  201,  subd.  (b)  and  §  220.  \"An arm of local government -  such as  a school board - may \ndecide not only to talk  about gay and lesbian awareness  and tolerance in general,  but also to  advocate  such tolerance  if it \nso  decides,  and restrict the  contrary  speech of one  of its representatives.\" Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified School Dist,\nPage  10 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *32 \n228 F.3d 1003,  1014  (9th  Cir.  2000).  [*33]  So  it is unknown to Defendants how tolerance material posted in a \nclassroom 1s violative  of Johnson's First Amendment rights. \n9.  The law is  the same under the California  constitution;  the  School may  regulate teacher speech where the \nteacher is  advocating  a controversial viewpoint. \nTurning to  California law  concerning  free  speech,  \"Article  1,  section 2  of the  California Constitution provides \nindependent protection for free  speech which in certain contexts  exceeds the protection provided by the  First \nAmendment to the United  States  Constitution.\"  California  Teachers Assn.  v.  Governing Board,  45  Cal.App.4th  1383, \n1391  (1996).  But in the  context of the  classroom activities  of teachers,  the  state  constitutional protection is  identical to \nthe  federal protection:  \"We  find the  federal  authorities which discuss  First Amendment principles in the  fairly unique \ncontext of school regulation of curricular activities  accurately weigh the  competing interests  of school  administrators, \nteachers  and  students.  /d. \nSo,  like his First Amendment claim,  Johnson's Fourth Claim for violation of free  speech under the  California \nconstitution also  fails.  This  conclusion is  consistent  [*34]  with the  California  Teachers Assn.  case,  which concluded \nthat  \"when public  school teachers  and administrators  are teaching  students,  they  act with the  imprimatur of the  school \ndistrict which employs them and ultimately with the  imprimatur of the  state which compels  students to  attend their \nclasses.\" /d.  at 1390.  Accordingly,  the  court held that with respect to teacher speech inside the  classroom,  \"school \nauthorities retain the power to  dissociate themselves  from political  controversy by prohibiting their employees  from \nengaging in political  advocacy in instructional  settings.\" /d.  at 139/.  Plaintiff's motion should be  denied as to this  state \nclaim also. \nB.  Plaintiff's  Second  and  Sixth  Claims  for Violation  of The  Establishment Clause  Fail Because The District's \nPolicies  Do  Not Establish Any Religion  and Are Neutral. \nIronically,  while promoting religion himself,  Johnson claims that it actually the  Defendants that have violated the \nEstablishment Clause  of both the United States  and California constitutions.  Johnson's  assertions  are  far afield. \nThere  are three tests used in the  context of a school by the  U.S.  Supreme  Court to  determine  [*35]  whether the \nEstablishment Clause has been violated.  Santa Fe Independent School District v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  147 L.E-d.2d 295, \n120 S.Ct.  2266  (2000). \nThe Lemon test,  discussed earlier,  states that there is no violation under these  circumstances:  (1) the  government's \naction must have  a  secular purpose;  (2) its principal  and primary  effect must be  one that neither advances nor inhibits \nreligion;  and (3) it must not foster excessive  government entanglement with religion.  Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602, \n612-13  (1971).  This test is  also used by the  California appellate  courts in analyzing Establishment Clause  claims under \nstate  law.  See  Catholic Charities  of Sacramento,  Inc.  v.  Superior Ct.,  32  Cal.4th 527,  546  (Cal.  2004)  (cert.  denied  125 \nS.Ct.  53). \nThe  \"endorsement\"  test collapses the  first two prongs  of the Lemon test,  and  \"captures the  essential  command of the \nEstablishment Clause,  namely,  that government must not make  a person's religious beliefs relevant to his  or her \nstanding in the political  community by conveying  a message that religion or a particular religious belief is  favored or \npreferred.\"  County of Allegheny v.  ACLU,  492  U.S.  573,  627  (1989)  [*36]  (quoting  Wallace v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  69 \n(O'Connor,  J.  concurring in judgment)). \nFinally,  the  coercion test states that  \"at a minimum,  the  Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce \nanyone to  support or participate  in religion or its  exercise,  or otherwise to  act in a way which establishes  a state religion \nor religious  faith,  or tends to  do  so.\"  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  377,  587  (1992). \nHere,  the District's  decision to have  Johnson remove his banners  from display in his  classroom had a secular \npurpose.  The  District's Board Policies  and Regulations require that teachers refrain from espousing  a  single viewpoint\nPage  11 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *36 \nwhen teaching controversial issues,  and that teachers be inclusive  of various points  of view.  See Defendants’  Exhs.  \"C\" \nand  \"D\"  in  support of their Motion for Summary Judgment.  Pursuant to the policies  and regulation,  District restricted \nthe  display  of Johnson's banners because the messages  on the banners were partisan and sectarian in nature.  The \npurpose  of the removal was  so that one viewpoint would not be promoted over another, the  opposite  of what Johnson is \nclaiming with respect to his Establishment Clause  claim.  Furthermore,  [*37]  there was no  entanglement with religion \nhere because the  Defendants’  actions  do not deprive  Johnson of providing his  opinion concerning religion outside  of the \nschool gates,  or forbidding him keeping the phrases  on the banners  in a desk  drawer so that he  can view them daily  (or \neven a very  small version not in plain view  of the  students),  and because the goal  of the  Defendants was to not advance \nany  one particular religion. \nThe Defendants’  actions  also  do not violate the  endorsement test.  The  Defendants'  actions in having Johnson \nremove his banners was  for the purpose  of preventing  favoritism or preference  for one particular religion or religious \nbelief.  Similarly,  with respect to the  coercion test,  the Defendants have  attempted to remove the  spectre  of coercing \nstudents to  adhere to  a particular sectarian practice.  Contrary to  Johnson's  contentions, the Defendants have tried to \nuphold the  Establishment Clause,  not violate  it. \nCalifornia state  law  also uses the Lemon test to  determine whether a government act violates the  Establishment \nClause  of Article  I,  section 4.  See DiLoreto v.  Board of Education,  74 Cal.App.4th  267,  275-276  (1999).  So Defendants’ \nactions  [*38]  do not violate the  Establishment Clause  of Article  I,  §  4  of California Constitution either. \nIn  short,  the  actions  of the  school  officials  in this  case were  consistent with the requirements under the Lemon test \nand therefore Johnson's  claims  for violations  of the  Establishment Clauses  of both the  Federal  and State  Constitutions \nfail.  Johnson's motion  should be  denied. \nC.  Johnson's  Third  Claim for Violation  of the Equal Protection  Clause Fails  Because There Are No  Facts \nIndicating Johnson Was  Treated  Differently From  Similarly-Situated  Employees. \nTo  establish a claim under the  Equal Protection Clause,  Johnson must  show that Defendants’  actions in following \nDistrict policy resulted in the him receiving  disparate treatment compared to  other similarly-situated employees.  See \nCity of Cleburne v.  Cleburne Living Center,  473  U.S.  432,  439  (1985).  Equal protection claims require  strict scrutiny if \nthe  legislation discriminates  against a suspect class  or impinges upon a fundamental night.  Nordlinger v.  Hahn,  505  U.S. \nI,  10  (1992).  The Equal  Protection Clause may give rise to  a cause  of action even if the plaintiff does not allege \nmembership  [*39]  ina class  or group.  See  Village  of Willowbrook v.  Olech,  528  U.S.  562,  564  (2000).  However,  this \ntype  of equal protection challenge  is  evaluated under a rational-basis test to  determine whether the legislation at issue  is \nrational  or wholly  arbitrary.  Conti v.  City of Fremont,  919 F.2d 1385,  1389  (9th  Cir. 1990).  In equal protection claims \nbrought by  a  \"class  of one,\"  the plaintiff must allege that he has been intentionally treated differently  from others \nsimilarly  situated and that there is no rational basis  for the  difference  in treatment.  See Sioux City Bridge  Co.  v.  Dakota \nCounty,  260  U.S.  441,  445  (1923); Allegheny Pittsburgh  Coal Co.  v.  Commission  of Webster Cty.,  488  U.S.  336  (1989). \nJohnson argues based upon his position that the  classroom 1s  a forum that the District has  opened for expression. \nPlaintiff's  P&As,  Doc.  #43-2,  p.  15.  But,  again,  the test for public  employees  in the workplace  is whether their speech \nconstitutes  a violation of the Establishment Clause  such that the public  employer may remove  such speech to  avoid a \nviolation.  The  School had the nght to remove Johnson's banners,  and give him alternative  [*40]  material  containing the \nslogans  on the banners, but in their historical/national  context.  So to the  extent that other teachers within the  School \nhave posters  or other items  on their walls,  such facts  are  irrelevant to the  analysis. \nDefendants  actions  did not impinge  on any fundamental right of Johnson.  He  is  free to hold his  own religious \nbeliefs.  But his  First Amendment rights to  display his banners  are  outweighed by the District's  interest in preventing  an \nEstablishment Clause violation,  and the banners,  as they were  displayed,  violate the  Establishment Clause. \nThe  School is not trying to  eradicate the notion of God or religion from its  classroom,  as Johnson has intimated in\nPage  12 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *40 \nhis  complaint.  Rather,  the  opposite is true.  Johnson was provided materials by the  School which contained  some  of the \nsame phrases  on his banner,  but in their historical national  context.  To that end,  that he  could have pictures  of coinage \nor money containing the phrase  \"In God We  Trust.\"  Defs.’  Exh.  K (Doc.  55-5,  Exh.  pp.  78-80).  The  School  offered \nJohnson the  option of displaying a poster containing the text of the  Declaration of Independence,  which includes the \nwords  \"creator\"  and  \"God.\" /d.  The  School  [*41]  had no problem with Johnson displaying the  \"Pledge  of Allegiance\" \nin its  entirety,  including the  line  \"one nation under God.\" /d.  He  could also  display  all  of the  lyrics to the  song  \"God \nBless America.”  These  items,  if posted in their context,  would alleviate  any Establishment Clause  entanglement. \nJohnson,  however,  refused to  display these  items in lieu of his banner.  Defs.'  Exh.  \"F,\"  Doc.  55-4,  pp.  47-48  (Johnson \nDepo.,  pp.  128:25-130:4). \nJohnson's  argues that Defendants violated the  equal protection clause  \"when they  ordered his banners removed \nbased on the  content and viewpoint of his  speech,  while permitting  other teachers to  continue their  speech in the  same \nforum unfettered.\"  Doc.  43-2,  p.  15.  But Johnson ignores that all teachers  are  operating under the  District policies  and \npractices.  The  School's Administrative Procedure,  AP 3.11.2,  that contains  a  section concerning the  \"Responsibilities  of \nTeachers.\"  Defendants’  Exh.  \"D,\"  Doc.  #55-4,  pp.  13-15.  Those responsibilities  include refrain[ing]  from using \nclassroom teacher influence to promote partisan or sectarian viewpoints.  So  if the  School believes that there  are teachers \npromoting  sectarian religious viewpoints,  it  [*42]  may restrict that speech. \nJohnson's  separate  statement of facts point to  a teacher named Lori  Brickley,  who has what apparently  are known as \n\"Tibetan prayer flags\"  displayed in her classroom.  The  flags,  like  Johnson's banners,  are personal  items  in nature,  but \nBrickley and Johnson have not been treated differently.  Unlike Johnson's banners,  Brickley's  flags  do not violate the \nEstablishment clause because they have  a  secular purpose,  do not advance religion over non-religion,  and do not \nexcessively  entangle the  District with the  support of a particular religion.  Brickley's prayer flags  are  in a language, \nSanskrit,  that no person at the  school  (student or otherwise) has been able to read.  Plaintiff's  Exh.  5,  Doc.  #54-4, pp. \n224-225  (Brickley Depo.,  pp.  88:17-89:6).  The prayer flags  are  decorative  in nature,  and an interesting  artifact in that \nthey  are  sold at the bottom of Mount Everest and placed on top  of the mountain when climbers reach the top,  as \nBrickley informs her  students who  ask.  /d.  Brickley Depo., pp.  87:20-  90:6;  Defs.  Exh.  \"E,\"  Brickley herself maintains \nthat religion does not belong 1n the  classroom (Plaintiff's  Exh.  5,  Doc.  #54-4,  p.  228  (depo  at  118:6-8)),  so  she  [*43]  is \nhardly  displaying the banners  for the purpose  of promoting a religion.  The banners have the  secular purpose  of \nmotivating her students to  achieve lofty goals,  like mountain climbers trying to reach Everest's  summit.  Plaintiff's Exh. \n5,  Doc.  #54-4,  p.  225  (Brickley Depo.,  p.  89:7-22).  There  is  a small  figure  on  some  flags that appears to be  Buddhist in \nnature,  but it is not prominent (Defs.  Exh.  \"L\").  And like the words  God and Creator in a full  display  of text from the \nDeclaration of Independence  (Defs.  Exh.  \"K\"),  the religious  significance 1s  far lesser than the whole  of what it \nrepresents. \nIf the  alternative materials the  School provided to  Johns  on (which he  chose not to  display)  do not violate the \nEstablishment Clause  or School policy,  then neither do the prayer flags in Brickley's  classroom.  Johnson 1s being treated \nthe  same with respect to  display of speech touching  on religion as  any  other teacher. \nJohnson also  suggests  in his  separate  statement of facts that there 1s  a  \"controversial\"  poster of John Lennon in a \nclassroom containing lyrics to the  song  \"Imagine.\"  See poster at Defs.  Exh.  \"O.\"  Johnson's  contention that the  song is \n\"controversial\"  lacks  foundation and  should  [*44]  be ignored.  Mr.  Collins,  the  School's  Deputy  Superintendent, \ntestified that he is  Christian and was not aware  of any  controversy  surrounding that  song not did he  find it offensive;  he \nviewed the  song to be  about  \"tolerance.\"  Plaintiff's  Exh.  \"2,\"  p.  126  (Collins  Depo.  p.  90:19-91:13).  Furthermore, \nJohnson did not  submit any  evidence to  show whether the poster was teacher speech (as  opposed to  a  student project)  or \nthe  context that the poster was presented.  Without  such evidence,  Johnson cannot  say that he was treated different from \nother teachers based on this poster. \nFinally,  the  District's policies have  a legitimate  state  interest in ensuring that all points  of view,  and not one  single \nviewpoint,  1s heard by the  students in the  classroom.  The  District felt that Johnson's banners  did not comply with the \nDistrict's policy  of inclusion of all viewpoints,  and had him remove the banners.  The District's  decision was therefore\nPage  13 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *44 \nnarrowly tailored to  achieve  an important government interest.  For the  above reasons,  Johnson's  Equal Protection claim \nfails  as  a matter of law. \nD.  Johnson's  Fifth  Claim  For Violation  of the  California's  \"No Preference\"  Clause Fails  Because  The Defendants \n[*45]  Did Not  Show A Preference  For Religion;  Rather  They Wanted  To  Keep  Their  Classrooms \nReligion-Neutral. \nCalifornia's No  Preference  Clause reads:  \"Free  exercise  and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or \npreference  are  guaranteed.\"  Cal.  Const.  art.  I,  §  4.  \"California courts have  interpreted the No  Preference  Clause to \nrequire that the government neither prefer one religion over another nor appear to  act preferentially.\"  Brown  v. \nWoodland  Joint  Unified School Dist.,  27 F.3d 1373,  1384  (9th  Cir.  1994),  citing Sands v.  Morongo  Unif.  Sch.  Dist.,  53 \nCal. 3d 863,  872-878  (1991),  cert.  denied,  505  U.S.  1218  (1992). \nHere,  there  are no  facts to  suggest that the Defendants removed Johnson's banners with an eye to  advancing  one \nreligion over another.  On the  contrary,  the  Defendants were  concerned that Johnson himself was  one trying to  advance \nhis religion over non-religion and over other religions by hanging his banners.  The intent of the  school was to maintain \nneutrality  concerning religion.  Accordingly,  Johnson's motion  should be  denied as to this  claim also. \nE.  The Damages  Claim Against The  Individual Defendants  Should  [*46]  Be Denied  Due To  Their  Qualified \nImmunity. \nJohnson also  seeks nominal  damages  against the  Individual Defendants by way  of his motion.  Doc.  #43-2,  p.  22. \nBut Johnson is not entitled to  damages  claim because the  Individual Defendants  enjoy  qualified immunity. \n\"When governmental  officials  assert the  defense  of qualified immunity to  an action under 42  U.S.C.  §  1983,  a court \nevaluating the  defense must first determine whether the plaintiff has  alleged the  deprivation of a constitutional right and, \nif so,  then determine whether the right was  clearly established at the time  of the  alleged violation.\"  Cole  v.  Oroville \nUnion High School Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092,  1101  (9th  Cir.  2000).  Here,  there was no  constitutional violation.  But even if \nthere was,  the  current state  of the  law gave  Defendants no reason to believe that their decision to remove materials  from \nJohnson's  classroom was unconstitutional,  especially in light of the Berry and Pe/loza cases  cited infra.  Therefore,  the \nindividual  defendants  are  entitled to  qualified immunity against Johnson's  damages  claims  1n this  case. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nThe  School District provides  services  [*47]  to  students who hold many  different beliefs  and come  from many \ndifferent backgrounds.  Respect for all  of those  different beliefs is  at the  core  of the  School District's purpose.  While the \nSchool District tries to  ensure that students will be  exposed to  different ideas  and beliefs,  and hopes they may grow  and \nprosper by that exposure, the  School must not pick  any particular belief to  endorse  or to recommend.  When a  teacher - \nemployed by the District - picks  one particular belief to  endorse  and support,  a part of the purpose  of the  School District \nis thwarted. \nBy law,  the  School  District must not endorse  any particular religious belief,  or oppose  any particular belief.  A \npublic  school must be neutral.  Obviously,  a  School District may  only  speak through its  employees,  and Mr.  Johnson is \none  of those valued and respected employees who  speaks  for the  District.  If he is permitted to  endorse  one particular \nbelief -  by  signs placed prominently in his  classroom - the  duty of the  School  District 1s breached. \nIf Mr.  Johnson is permitted to keep his banners up  in his  classroom,  then a Muslim teacher,  or an atheist teacher,  or \na teacher of any  other belief, has the  same right to  display banners  [*48]  promoting his belief.  If that were to  occur, \nthen the improper entanglement of the  school in religious issues would be unmistakable  and impact on the  District's \npurpose to respect the beliefs  of all  of its  students would be impaired. \nBut the  evidence is undisputed.  The visual  impact of these banners  does not communicate patriotism,  nor a\nPage  14 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75417,  *48 \nhistorical message.  The visual impact of the banners  communicates the teacher's  Judeo-Christian belief.  It is  also \nundisputed that the  School Administrators reasonably believed that the banners  entangled the  school in the  endorsement \nof religious ideas. \nUpon those undisputed facts,  the  Court should apply the Ninth Circuit rule  -  applicable to  school teacher's  speech in \nthe  classroom,  as  expressed in Pe/oza  -  and determine that the  School District's restriction on the teacher's  speech was \npermissible because the  School  District's nght to be  free  from an Establishment Clause violation trumped the teacher's \nspeech rights.  Under that analysis the  School District had a duty to  ask Mr.  Johnson to take  down the banners to protect \nits neutrality on this  controversial  issue  and to protect its  students right to be  free  from government endorsement of Mr. \n[*49]  Johnson's religious belief. \nThe  Court is respectfully requested to  deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,  and to  grant the Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment. \nDATED:  September 28,  2009 \nRespectfully  submitted, \nSTUTZ ARTIANO  SHINOFF  & HOLTZ \nA  Professional Corporation \nBy:  /s/ Paul V.

POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17327\nNation’s history to the captive students in his mathematics\nclassroom. The answer is clear: it does not.\nWhen  Bradley Johnson, a high school calculus  teacher,\ngoes to work and performs the duties  he is paid to perform,\nhe speaks not as an individual, but as a public employee, and\nthe school district is free to “take  legitimate and appropriate\nsteps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distort-\ned.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515\nU.S. 819, 833 (1995). Just as the  Constitution would not pro-\ntect Johnson were he to decide that he no longer wished  to\nteach math at all, preferring to discuss  Shakespeare rather\nthan Newton, it does not permit him to speak as freely at work\nin his role as a teacher about his  views on God, our Nation’s\nhistory, or God’s role in our Nation’s history as he might on\na sidewalk, in a park, at his dinner table, or  in countless other\nlocations.\nBecause we further conclude that the school district did not\nviolate  Johnson’s rights under either the  Establishment  or\nEqual Protection clauses of the United States Constitution, as\napplied by the Fourteenth Amendment, 1 we reverse  the dis-\ntrict  court’s award of summary judgment to Johnson and\nremand with instructions to enter summary judgment  in favor\n1The First Amendment provides: \nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the\nfreedom of speech, or of the press; or the right  of the people\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a\nredress of grievances. \nSection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant detail: \nNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law; nor deny  to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. \n“The term ‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment to  the Constitution\nmakes the First Amendment applicable to the States.”  McIntyre v. Ohio\nElections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 336 n.1 (1995). \n\n17328 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nof the Poway Unified School District and  its officials on all\nfederal and state claims.2\nI\nBradley Johnson has spent more  than 30 years teaching\nmath to the students of the Poway Unified School District of\nSan Diego County, California. In August 2003, he  moved to\nthe newly opened Westview High  School to teach calculus\nand algebra. He teaches there still and is the faculty sponsor\nof the school’s student Christian club.\nIn late 2006, a fellow teacher at Westview set this action in\nmotion when he questioned Dawn Kastner, the  newly hired\nprincipal of Westview, about two large banners prominently\ndisplayed  in Johnson’s classroom. Kastner,  who  had  also\nheard about Johnson’s banners from a student and  another\nteacher, went to Johnson’s classroom to see the banners for\nherself. What she found surprised her. In Johnson’s class-\nroom, two large banners, each about seven-feet wide and two-\nfeet tall, hung on the wall. See Appendix. One had red, white,\nand blue stripes and stated in large block type: “IN GOD WE\nTRUST”; “ONE NATION UNDER GOD”;  “GOD BLESS\nAMERICA”; and, “GOD SHED HIS  GRACE ON THEE.”3\nThe  other  stated:  “All men are created equal, they are\nendowed  by  their  CREATOR.”  On that banner, the word\n“creator” occupied its own line, and each letter of “creator”\nwas capitalized and nearly double the size of  the other text.\nKastner recalled being overwhelmed by the size of the ban-\nners.  She  remembered walking into Johnson’s class “and\n2We resolve these state law claims against Johnson and reverse  the dis-\ntrict court in a separate memorandum disposition filed  concurrently with\nthis opinion. \n3Each of these phrases appears in official and historical texts. For exam-\nple, “In God We Trust” is the official motto of the United States, and “One\nNation Under God” is a line from the Pledge of Allegiance. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17329\ngoing,  ‘Wow, these are really big.’ ”  She was more con-\ncerned, though, about the message. “It was a math class,” she\nlater explained. “There were a lot of phrases that individually\nor in context were not problematic at all.  But because they\nwere taken out of context and very large, they became a  pro-\nmotion  of  a  particular viewpoint”—a religious viewpoint\n“that might make students who didn’t share that viewpoint\nuncomfortable.” The “common thread in all of those were the\nwords ‘God, Creator.’ Those were all sort of pulled out of  the\ncontext of their original [meaning] — and the signs were, like,\n10 feet, 7 feet, something like that. There were two very large\nsigns.” \nUnsure as to what she should do, Kastner called Melavel\nRobertson,  one of Poway’s assistant superintendents. She\ndescribed the banners to Robertson and told her that “some\npeople [had] mention[ed] that they don’t know why these\nsigns  are  allowed  in  the classroom, and I just saw what\nthey’re talking about.” At Robertson’s  request, she had pic-\ntures taken of Johnson’s banners and sent to Robertson, who\nforwarded them to Bill Chiment, the assistant superintendent\ntasked with “legal issues.” \nWhile waiting for further direction from the superinten-\ndent’s office, Kastner met with Johnson to talk about his ban-\nners. She told him that she felt the signs might inappropriately\nemphasize the words “God” and “Creator” and suggested that\nhis displays might be more appropriate if the passages were\neach displayed in the context of the historical artifact or docu-\nment from which they were pulled. “We talked about the pos-\nsibility of putting the entire thing up in context so if a phrase\nwas from the Declaration [of Independence], put the entire\nDeclaration up.” Also, “we talked about taking a smaller ver-\nsion of that and having smaller — smaller expressions of his\npersonal beliefs around his desk area.” \nKastner asked Johnson to consider how a student  of a dif-\nferent faith might feel if they walked into  his classroom and\n\n17330 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nsaw his banners. “[T]hey may feel like, ‘Wow, I’m not wel-\ncome,’ or ‘I’m not gonna fit in this classroom.’ And they may\nfeel bad. And I can’t imagine that that would ever be your\nintent.” Johnson was not convinced. According to Kastner, he\ntold her, “Dawn, sometimes that’s necessary,” and  refused to\neither remove his banners or display the more contextual ver-\nsions the school offered to provide.4 He explained that he had\ndisplayed the banners in some form or another since 1982,\nthat they simply contained patriotic phrases, and that he  con-\nsidered it his “right to have them up.” \nAfter the meeting with Johnson, Kastner spoke with Chi-\nment and informed him of their  discussion. Eventually, the\nfull school board approved the decision to  order Johnson to\nremove the banners. On January 19, 2007, Chiment  phoned\nJohnson and told him that he would need to remove his ban-\nners. Four days later, Chiment followed up his phone call with\na letter directing Johnson to review Poway Unified School\nDistrict Administrative Procedure 3.11.2, “The Teaching  of\nControversial Issues,” as well as California Education Code\n§51511.5 He told Johnson to pay particular  care to Poway’s\nrequirement that teachers “[f]ollow the requirements on  pro-\nhibited instruction as contained in the California Education\nCode” and “[d]istinguish between teaching and  advocating,\nand refrain from using classroom teacher influence to promote\npartisan or sectarian viewpoints.”\n4For example, the school offered to provide, and did provide, Johnson\nwith a large poster of a quarter that displayed  the phrase “In God We\nTrust” in context. \n5That section provides: \nNothing in this code shall be construed to prevent, or exclude\nfrom the public schools, references to religion or references to or\nthe use of religious literature, dance, music, theatre, and visual\narts or other things having a religious significance when such ref-\nerences or uses do not constitute instruction in religious princi-\nples or aid to any religious sect, church, creed, or sectarian\npurpose and when such references or  uses are incidental to or\nillustrative of matters properly included in the course of study. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17331\nChiment  explained that the “prominent display of  these\nbrief and narrow selections of text from documents and songs\nwithout the benefit of any context and of a motto, all of which\ninclude the word ‘God’ or ‘Creator’ has the  effect of using\nyour influence as a teacher to promote a sectarian viewpoint.”\nHe added that these uses also constituted “aid to a particular\nreligious sect, creed, or sectarian purpose” because  they were\n“not incidental or illustrative of  matters properly included in\nyour course of study as a teacher of mathematics.” \nJohnson complied with the district’s order and removed his\nbanners. Shortly thereafter, he filed suit in federal court, alleg-\ning that Poway had violated his rights under the First and\nFourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, and\narticle I, sections 2 and 4, of the California Constitution. He\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief. \nAfter the lawsuit was filed, Johnson conducted site inspec-\ntions at all four high schools in the school district.  He identi-\nfied and photographed a lengthy list of items he believed\ndisplayed  sectarian viewpoints, including Tibetan prayer\nflags; a John Lennon poster with “Imagine” lyrics; a Mahatma\nGandhi poster; a poster of Gandhi’s “7 Social Sins”; a Dalai\nLama poster; a poster that says, “The hottest places in hell are\nreserved for those who in times of great moral crisis, maintain\ntheir neutrality”; and a poster of Malcolm X. 6 Both parties\nalso deposed school officials, including Kastner and Chiment,\nand  some teachers, including Johnson. In his  deposition,\nJohnson  initially maintained that his  banners  were  purely\npatriotic with no religious purpose. When pressed, however,\nhe stated:\nMy purpose was to celebrate our national heritage of\n— and the national motto saying the Pledge of Alle-\ngiance. I know that there’s — you know, is it God\n6We identify only those materials that could possibly be construed  as\nreligious. The remaining displays are ultimately immaterial to our inquiry.\n\n17332 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nor is it — or is there no God. If that’s the choice,\nthen this is espousing God as opposed to no God, I’ll\nsay that, but not any particular God.\nHe later added, in regard to his selections, “I’m not intending\nto highlight or promote any of that kind of religious back-\nground because I don’t know what it was. I’m trying to high-\nlight the religious heritage and nature of our nation, that we\nhave that as a foundation.” \nOn August 14, 2009, cross-motions for summary judgment\nwere filed. On February 25, 2010, the district  court granted\nJohnson summary judgment on each of his claims. It con-\ncluded that Poway had created a  limited public forum for\nteacher speech in its classrooms and had impermissibly lim-\nited Johnson’s speech based upon his viewpoint. It granted\nJohnson declaratory relief and ordered Poway not  to interfere\nwith Johnson’s future display. It also found  that the school\nofficials were not entitled to qualified  immunity and ordered\neach to pay nominal damages. Johnson later moved for attor-\nney’s fees in the amount of $240,563.15. That motion has\nbeen stayed pending the outcome of Poway’s timely appeal.\nII\nWe  have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291,  and  we\nreview de novo the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment to “determine, viewing the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all justifiable\ninferences in its favor, whether there are any genuine  issues\nof material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law.”  Orr v. Bank of  Am., NT & SA,\n285 F.3d 764, 772 (9th Cir. 2002). Because the parties filed\ncross-motions  for summary judgment, we  consider  each\nparty’s evidence to evaluate whether summary judgment was\nappropriate. Fair Hous. Council of Riverside Cnty., Inc.  v.\nRiverside Two, 249 F.3d 1132, 1136 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17333\nIII\nWe consider the district court’s determination  that Poway\nviolated Johnson’s rights under the Free Speech and Estab-\nlishment clauses of the First Amendment, as well as his equal\nprotection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nA\nWe address first whether the district court erred  in holding\nthat Poway violated Johnson’s federal free speech rights when\nit ordered that he no longer display his  banners in his class-\nroom.\nIn undertaking this inquiry, we consider whether the court\nerred in applying a pure forum-based  analysis rather than the\nPickering-based inquiry crafted by the Supreme Court to mea-\nsure the constitutionality of the government’s  curtailment of\ngovernment-employee speech. Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of\nTwp. High Sch. Dist. 205, Will Cnty., Ill., 391 U.S. 563, 568\n(1968) (“[T]he State has interests as an employer in regulating\nthe  speech of its employees that differ significantly from\nthose it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech\nof the citizenry in general.”). Because we  hold that Picker-\ning’s employee-speech analysis controls, we  further consider\nwhether Poway’s actions ran afoul of the sequential five-step\nPickering-based test we adopted in  Eng v. Cooley, 552 F.3d\n1062, 1070-72 (9th Cir. 2009). As we can  conceive of no\nbasis for concluding that Johnson’s speech was protected, we\nreverse the district court’s award of summary judgment on\nthis issue and remand with instructions to enter judgment in\nfavor of Poway.\n1\n[1] To some degree, we can understand the district court’s\nmistake. An analysis of the government’s regulation of speech\nordinarily  hinges  on  the  context, or forum, in which the\n\n17334 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nspeech  takes place.  See,  e.g.,  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry\nLocal Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 44-46 (1983).  Under\nthat traditional rubric, the government’s power is at  its least\nwhen speech takes place in a public forum, is  greater when it\nis regulating speech in a limited public forum, and is at its\ngreatest when regulating speech in a non-public forum.  Id.\n[2] However, the Supreme Court has held that where the\ngovernment acts as both sovereign and employer, this general\nforum-based analysis does not apply.  Pickering, 391 U.S. at\n568;  accord  Garcetti  v. Ceballos ,  547 U.S. 410, 417-19\n(2006); City of San Diego, Cal. v. Roe, 543 U.S. 77, 80 (2004)\n(“[A] governmental employer may impose certain restraints\non  the speech of its employees,  restraints  that  would  be\nunconstitutional if applied to the general public.”).  Instead,\nthe Court applies a distinct  Pickering-based analysis that “re-\nconcile[s] the employee’s right to engage in speech and the\ngovernment  employer’s right to protect its own  legitimate\ninterests in performing its mission.”  Roe, 543 U.S. at 82.\nAs initially described in  Pickering, this analysis  required\nonly  that  courts  balance “ ‘the  interests of the [public\nemployee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public\nconcern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in pro-\nmoting  the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees.’ ” Eng, 552 F.3d at 1070 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Pickering, 391 U.S. at  568). Since Picker-\ning, however, the test  has evolved. See, e.g., Ceballos, 547\nU.S. at 423-24, 426 (speech must not  be made pursuant to\nduties as employee);  Roe, 543 U.S. at 82-83 (“speech must\ntouch on a matter of ‘public concern’ ” (citing Connick v.\nMyers, 461 U.S. 138, 143 (1983)); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist.\nBd. of Educ. v. Doyle , 429 U.S. 274,  285-86 (1977) (causa-\ntion). We have distilled this evolution into  a “sequential five-\nstep” inquiry:\n(1) whether the plaintiff spoke on a matter  of public\nconcern; (2) whether the plaintiff spoke as a private\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17335\ncitizen or public employee; (3) whether the plain-\ntiff’s protected speech was a  substantial or motivat-\ning  factor in the adverse employment  action;  (4)\nwhether the state had an adequate justification for\ntreating the employee differently from other mem-\nbers of the general public; and (5) whether the state\nwould  have  taken the adverse employment action\neven absent the protected speech. \nEng, 552 F.3d at 1070. Notably, “because these are sequential\nsteps,” a plaintiff’s failure to satisfy a single one “necessarily\nconcludes our inquiry.” Huppert v. City of Pittsburg, 574 F.3d\n696, 703 (9th Cir. 2009).\nDespite Pickering and its progeny, the  district court con-\ncluded  that “the  Pickering  balancing  test for government\nemployee speech is the wrong test to apply” to measure the\nlegality of Poway’s actions.  Johnson v. Poway Unified  Sch.\nDist., No. 3:07-cv-783-BEN-WVG, 2010 WL 768856, at *8\n(S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2010). It rested this conclusion on a single\nfact—that Johnson’s speech occurred in school, noting “ ‘[i]t\ncan hardly be argued  that either students or teachers shed\ntheir constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression\nat the schoolhouse gate.’ ” Id. at *7 (alteration in original)\n(quoting Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist. , 393\nU.S. 503, 506 (1969) (emphasis added)). On  appeal, Johnson\nurges us to follow suit. We decline his invitation.\n[3] Contrary to Johnson’s belief and the district court’s\ndetermination, no justifiable cause exists for refusing to apply\nour Pickering-based analysis to Johnson’s claim.  See Tucker\nv. Cal. Dep’t of Educ ., 97 F.3d 1204, 1210  (9th Cir. 1996)\n(applying Pickering) (“Casting these red herrings aside,  we\nlook instead to applicable doctrine, which is found in the case\nlaw governing employee speech in the workplace.”);  see also\nBerry v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 447 F.3d 642, 649-50 (9th Cir.\n2006) (rejecting an employee’s contention that a “stricter test”\nthan  our  Pickering-based  analysis  should  apply when the\n\n17336 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nunderlying speech is religious);  Downs v. L.A. Unified Sch.\nDist., 228 F.3d 1003, 1016 (9th Cir. 2000).7 First, our “school\nspeech” precedent in no way suggests that  Pickering does not\ncontrol in cases of in-school teacher speech. Not  one of those\ncases relied upon by the district  court applied a Pickering-\nbased  analysis because not one involved a  government\nemployee—a fact that renders  Pickering’s absence not only\nunsurprising,  but necessary.  Compare  Johnson,  2010 WL\n768856, at *8 (citing cases),  with Hazelwood Sch. Dist.  v.\nKuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 266 (1988) (student journalists);\nTruth v. Kent Sch. Dist., 542 F.3d 634, 648-49 (9th Cir. 2008)\n(student  Bible club),  overruled  on other grounds by L.A.\nCnty., Cal. v. Humphries, 131 S. Ct. 447 (2010); Flint v. Den-\nnison, 488 F.3d 816, 830 (9th Cir. 2007) (student);  and Hills\nv.  Scottsdale Unified Sch. Dist.  No.  48,  329 F.3d 1044,\n1048-50  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (per curiam) (religious non-profit\ncorporation).\nPickering and Tinker are not mutually exclusive concepts.\nTinker, 393 U.S. at 506 (“First Amendment rights,  applied in\nlight of the special characteristics of the school  environment,\nare available to teachers and students.” (emphasis added)).\nThe very basis for undertaking a  Pickering-based analysis of\nteacher speech, whether in-class or out, is the Court’s recogni-\ntion that teachers do not “relinquish the First Amendment\nrights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on\nmatters of public interest in connection with the operation of\nthe public schools in which they work.”  Pickering, 391 U.S.\nat  568.  That  much  should be evident from the test itself,\n7Johnson argues that Downs is immaterial to a Pickering-based inquiry.\nWe disagree. Downs recognized that the threshold inquiry in employee-\nspeech cases is whether the citizen or the government was speaking.\nDowns, 228 F.3d at 1011-12 (“Rather than focusing on what members of\nthe public might perceive Downs’s speech to be, in this  case we find it\nmore helpful to focus on who actually was responsible for the speech\n. . . .”). Six years later, the Court did the  same in Ceballos. 547 U.S. at\n421. Because we now undertake that very inquiry under step two of  Eng,\nsee 552 F.3d at 1070, Downs is not only relevant, it largely controls. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17337\nwhich requires that we “balance between  the interests of the\nteacher, as a citizen, . . .  and the interest of the State.” Id.\n(emphasis added); accord Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 418 (noting\nthat absent a First Amendment right there can be no First\nAmendment claim).\nThus, to do as Johnson suggests would require us to ignore\nthat Pickering itself concerned a school district’s attempt to\ncurtail the out-of-school speech of a high school teacher. 391\nU.S. at 564, 568. It would require us to forget the very ratio-\nnale undergirding the Court’s creation of the  Pickering doc-\ntrine: that “[w]hen a citizen enters government service, the\ncitizen by necessity must accept certain limitations on his or\nher freedom,” or else “there would be little chance for the\nefficient provision of public services.”  Ceballos, 547 U.S. at\n418 (citing Connick, 461 U.S. at 143 (“[G]overnment offices\ncould not function if every  employment decision became a\nconstitutional matter.”)). It would require that we somehow\nconclude that a teacher’s in-school speech warrants greater\nprotection than his or her out-of-school speech—a proposition\ndirectly at odds with the common  understanding of Pickering\nand its progeny. Id. at 423-24 (explaining  that “public state-\nments” made “outside the course of performing . . . official\nduties” engender the greatest “First Amendment  protection\nbecause that is the kind of activity engaged in by citizens who\ndo not work for  the government”); see Downs, 228 F.3d at\n1016. \nMoreover, addressing similar claims in similar contexts, we\nhave refused to unnecessarily narrow Pickering’s application.\nBerry, 447 F.3d at 649 (declining  to apply a forum-based\nanalysis  to evaluate the government’s curtailment of an\nemployee’s religious speech “because [the forum analysis]\ndoes not take into consideration the employer’s interests  that\nled the Supreme Court to  adopt the Pickering balancing test\nin the first place.”); id. at 650 (“Here, Mr. Berry contends that\nhis speech is protected under the  First Amendment as reli-\ngious speech, rather than as comments upon matters of public\n\n17338 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nconcern. Nonetheless, we conclude that the Pickering balanc-\ning approach applies regardless of the reason an employee\nbelieves  his  or  her speech is constitutionally protected.”);\nTucker, 97 F.3d at 1210.\nSo too have our sister circuits. When addressing  claims\nconcerning in-school teacher speech, each has applied Picker-\ning to measure the constitutionality of the government’s con-\nduct.  E.g.,  Evans-Marshall  v. Bd. of Educ.  of  Tipp  City\nExempted Vill. Sch. Dist., 624 F.3d 332, 340 (6th Cir. 2010);\nBorden v. Sch. Dist. of East Brunswick, 523 F.3d 153, 171 (3d\nCir.  2008) (holding under  Pickering-based  analysis that\nschool could prohibit faculty participation  in student-initiated\nprayer); Lee v. York Cnty. Sch. Div. , 484 F.3d 687, 700 (4th\nCir. 2007) (holding under  a Pickering-based analysis that a\nschool board did not infringe the rights of  a teacher when it\nordered him to remove religious material from a  classroom\nbulletin  board);  Brammer-Hoelter  v. Twin  Peaks  Charter\nAcad., 492 F.3d 1192, 1204 (10th Cir. 2007); Williams v. Dal-\nlas  Indep. Sch. Dist. ,  480  F.3d  689,  694 (5th Cir. 2007);\nMayer  v. Monroe Cnty. Cmty. Sch.

We see no reason to depart from their company.\n[4] In sum, we think it plain that the  appropriate guide for\nmeasuring  the legality of the government’s curtailment  of\nemployee speech in the workplace, including that of teachers,\nwould be that Supreme Court “case law governing employee\nspeech in the workplace.” See Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1210 (citing\nPickering); see also Downs, 228 F.3d at 1012, 1015. The dis-\ntrict  court  erred by declining to apply the controlling\nPickering-based analysis.\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17339\n2\nHaving  identified the  Pickering-based  approach as the\nappropriate standard by which to measure Poway’s conduct,\nwe apply our five-step Pickering-based analysis to determine\nwhether Poway violated Johnson’s federal free speech  rights\nwhen it ordered that he remove his banners from his classroom8.\nApplying that standard, we conclude that there  is no legiti-\nmate question as to whether the  school violated Johnson’s\nrights—it  did not.  Downs,  228 F.3d at 1016;  see  Evans-\nMarshall,  624 F.3d at  340;  Mayer,  474 F.3d at 479-80;\nEdwards v. Cal. Univ. of Pa. , 156 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir.\n1998) (“[A]lthough a teacher’s out-of-class conduct, includ-\ning her advocacy of particular teaching methods, is protected,\nher in-class conduct is not.” (citation and  internal quotation\nmarks omitted)); see also Borden, 523 F.3d at 171;  Lee, 484\nF.3d at 700. Though we do not lightly conclude that Johnson\nsurpasses Eng-step one, “(1) whether the plaintiff spoke on  a\nmatter of public concern,” 552 F.3d at 1070, we recognize\nthat our hesitation is driven not by the  nature of the speech\nitself but by the “in-school” setting and opportunity for  that\nspeech. These concerns underlie our inquiry under  Eng-step\ntwo, “(2) whether the plaintiff spoke as a private citizen or\npublic employee,” id. at 1071 (relying on  Ceballos, 547 U.S.\nat 423-24), and lead us to conclude that Johnson spoke as an\nemployee, not as a citizen. Accordingly, we climb no further.\nHuppert, 574 F.3d at 703 (“[F]ailure to meet one [step] neces-\nsarily concludes our inquiry.”).\n8Ordinarily, we would remand the matter to allow the district court to\nfirst pass on the issue. However, because the record fails to establish any\ngenuine issues of material fact that would preclude us from  resolving the\nlegal questions presented under our  Eng analysis, and because the parties\nbriefed and argued the issue, we are adequately informed and think it\nexpedient to resolve the matter. See Thomas v. Or. Fruit Prods.  Co., 228\nF.3d 991, 995 (9th Cir. 2000). \n\n17340 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\na\n[5] Under  Eng,  Johnson  must  first demonstrate that his\nbanners “touched upon a matter  of public concern.” Connick,\n461 U.S. at 149;  Eng, 552 F.3d at 1070. \nThis inquiry “is one of law, not fact.”  Connick, 461 U.S. at\n148 n.7. And our aim, at least in theory, is simple: to deter-\nmine whether the content of the employee’s speech is suffi-\nciently important to the public that its curtailment “warrant[s]\njudicial review.” Berry, 447 F.3d at  649; accord Roe, 543\nU.S. at 82-83.\nTo put theory into practice, we undertake a “generalized\nanalysis of the nature of the speech.”  Desrochers v. City of\nSan Bernardino, 572 F.3d 703, 709 (9th Cir. 2009); see Weeks\nv. Bayer, 246 F.3d 1231, 1234 (9th  Cir. 2001) (declining to\nadopt “rigid multi-part tests that would shoehorn communica-\ntion into ill-fitting categories”). Under that  analysis, we con-\nsider generally “the content, form, and  context of a given\nstatement, as revealed by the whole record,” id. (quoting Con-\nnick, 461 U.S. at 147-48), to ascertain whether speech “fairly\ncan be said to relate to ‘any matter of political, social, or other\nconcern to the community,’ ” Huppert, 574 F.3d at 703 (quot-\ning Connick, 461 U.S. at 147-48).\nOf the three concerns, content is king.  Desrochers, 572\nF.3d at 710. It is “the greatest single factor in the  Connick\ninquiry,” id., and our primary concern.  See, e.g., Rankin v.\nMcPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 386-87 (1987);  Givhan v. W. Line\nConsol. Sch. Dist., 439 U.S. 410, 414-16 (1979). 9 Form and\n9In Rankin, for example, the Court concluded that the private form  of\nan employee’s speech—that the employee had spoken to a co-worker dur-\ning work hours in an informal and private manner—could not  negate the\ninherently public character of her political speech. 483 U.S. at 386-87;\naccord Roe, 543 U.S. at 84 (“[C]ertain private remarks, such  as negative\ncomments about the President of the United States, touch on matters of\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17341\ncontext only truly inform our legal inquiry in those  “close”\ncases where “the subject matter of a statement is only margin-\nally related to issues of public concern.” Desrochers, 572 F.3d\nat 710 (quoting Johnson v. Multnomah  Cnty., Or., 48 F.3d\n420, 425 (9th Cir. 1995)). In those cases, “the fact that  [a\nstatement] was made because of a grudge or other private\ninterest or to co-workers rather than to the press may lead the\ncourt to conclude that the  statement does not substantially\ninvolve a matter of public concern.”  Id. (quoting Multnomah\nCnty., 48 F.3d at 425). \n[6] In the present case, our crowning of content is  disposi-\ntive. Desrochers, 572 F.3d at 710;  see Rankin, 483 U.S. at\n386-87. Though Johnson maintains that his banners express\npurely patriotic sentiments—that they concern “well-known\nhistorical,  patriotic phrases and slogans central to  our\nNation’s history”—it seems as plain to us as it was to school\nofficials that Johnson’s banners concern  religion. As Johnson\nconceded  at his deposition, “[T]his  is  discussing  God  as\nopposed to no God . . . . I’m trying to highlight the  religious\nheritage and nature of our nation, that we have that as a foun-\ndation.” Moreover, his after-the-fact statements  merely rein-\nforce  the obvious. One would need  to  be  remarkably\nunperceptive to see the statements “IN GOD  WE TRUST,”\n“ONE  NATION UNDER GOD,” “GOD BLESS  AMERI-\nCA,” “GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE,” and “All men\nare created equal, they are endowed by their  CREATOR,” as\npublic concern and should thus be subject to Pickering balancing” regard-\nless of the manner in which they were conveyed. (discussing  Rankin)).\nSimilarly, in Givhan, the Court rejected the assertion that Mrs.  Givhan, a\npublic high school teacher, had forfeited her First Amendment interest in\nher speech protesting “racial discrimination—a matter inherently of public\nconcern,” Connick, 461 U.S. at 148 n.8—simply because she “arrange[d]\nto communicate privately with h[er] employer rather than to spread  h[er]\nviews before the public.” 439 U.S. at 414-16. \n\n17342 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\norganized and displayed by Johnson and not understand them\nto convey a religious message. 10 See Appendix.\n[7] Because speech concerning religion  is unquestionably\nof inherent public concern,  Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1212-13;  see\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 144 (“[I]t [i]s already ‘too late in the day\nto doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be\ninfringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a ben-\nefit or privilege.’ ” (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398,\n404 (1963))), our inquiry under  Eng step one is concluded,\nand we climb to the second step of  Eng.11\n10To be clear, we do not hold that these phrases necessarily equate to\nspeech concerning religion in and of themselves. See, e.g., Newdow v. Rio\nLinda Union Sch. Dist., 597 F.3d 1007, 1019-20 (9th Cir. 2010) (holding\nthat the phrase, “under God,” did not render the Pledge of Allegiance\nunconstitutional because “[w]e must examine the Pledge as a whole”  to\ntake account of context). Organized differently, such as in the context of\ntheir historical significance, these terms may well lack  any overt religious\nimport, id.—a reality Poway itself recognized when it offered to provide\nJohnson substitute posters. However, the bare fact that Johnson pulled\neach phrase from a non-religious historical text does not categorically pre-\nclude us from concluding that he used these otherwise innocuous phrases\nto convey a  religious message. Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum ,\n555 U.S. 460, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 1136 (2009). And it is his organization and\nhis selected emphasis on the words “God” and “Creator” that drive  our\nconclusion that the banners concerned religion.  See Connick, 461 U.S. at\n148 n.7. \n11We decline Poway’s invitation to apply the curricular speech doctrine\nin this case. See generally Lee, 484 F.3d at 697 (explaining that the thresh-\nold inquiry for “curricular speech” is whether the speech  “constitute[s]\nschool-sponsored expression bearing the imprimatur of the school”).  As\nwe will explain shortly in greater detail, this “is not a case involving the\nrisk that a private individual’s private speech might  simply ‘bear the\nimprimatur’  of the school or be perceived by  outside  individuals  as\n‘school-sponsored.’” Downs, 228 F.3d at 1011. “Instead, we face an\nexample of the government opening up its own mouth” to  speak through\nthe mouthpiece of one of its employees—a categorically different situation\nbecause, as Downs explains, we “review [a school’s] actions through a\nviewpoint neutrality microscope” in imprimatur cases, id. at 1012, but not\n“‘when the State is the speaker,’ ” id. at 1013 (quoting Rosenberger, 515\nU.S. at 833). \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17343\nb\n[8] The second Eng step requires Johnson to show that he\n“spoke as a private citizen,” not as a “public employee.” Eng,\n552 F.3d at 1070-71.12 \nTwo inquiries are necessary to resolve this mixed question\nof law and fact. Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist. No. 84,\n546 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir. 2008). First, a factual determi-\nnation must be made as to the “scope and content of a  plain-\ntiff’s  job responsibilities.”  Eng,  552 F.3d at 1071. In\nundertaking this inquiry, courts are not to rely mechanically\non formal or written job descriptions, which “often bear little\nresemblance to the duties an employee actually is  expected to\nperform.” Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 424-25. “The proper inquiry\nis a practical one.”  Id. at 424. \nSecond, the “ultimate constitutional significance” of  those\nfacts must be determined as a matter of law.  Eng, 552 F.3d\nat 1071 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  If\nJohnson spoke as any ordinary citizen might, then our inquiry\ncontinues. Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 419. But if Johnson’s speech\n“owes its existence” to his position as a teacher, then Johnson\nspoke as a public employee, not as a citizen, and our inquiry\nis at an end.  Id. at 421-22 (The First Amendment  “does not\ninvest [government employees] with a right to perform their\njobs however they see fit.”); Evans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 340\n(concluding  that when teacher speaks as a  government\nemployee “the school board that hires that speech . .  . can\nsurely ‘regulate the content of what is or  is not expressed’”\n(quoting  Rosenberger,  515 U.S. at 833 (The government\n12We reject the  contention that Eng step two, which is derived from\nCeballos, does not apply to inquiries regarding  teacher speech. As the\nSixth Circuit recognized in  Evans-Marshall, Ceballos’s “academic free-\ndom” carve-out, 547 U.S. at 425, applied to teachers at “public  colleges\nand universities,” id. at 438 (Souter, J., dissenting), not primary and sec-\nondary school teachers. 624 F.3d at 342-44; see Edwards v. Aguillard, 482\nU.S. 578, 584 n.5 (1987). \n\n17344 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nretains the power to “regulate the content of what is  or is not\nexpressed when it is the speaker or when it enlists private\nentities to convey its own message.”))); see Downs, 228 F.3d\nat 1013 (“Simply because the government opens its  mouth to\nspeak does not give every outside individual or group a First\nAmendment right to play ventriloquist.”).\nOur factual issue is not in dispute. Johnson does not hold\na unique or exotic government position. As  found by the dis-\ntrict court, he is a math teacher who performs the ordinary\nduties of a math teacher.  Johnson, 2010 WL 768856, at *2.\nIn addition, Johnson did not make his  speech while perform-\ning a function not squarely within the scope of his position. 13\nHe was not running errands for the school in  a car adorned\nwith sectarian bumper stickers or praying with people shelter-\ning in the school after an earthquake. “Rather,  Johnson hung\nhis banners pursuant to a long-standing Poway Unified School\nDistrict policy, practice, and custom,” id., of permitting teach-\ners to decorate their classrooms subject to specific  limitations\nand the satisfaction of the principal or a District administrator.\n[9] More importantly, we recognize that “[e]xpression  is a\nteacher’s  stock in trade, the commodity she sells  to  her\nemployer in exchange for a salary.”  Mayer, 474 F.3d at 479;\nEvans-Marshall, 624 F.3d at 340. Thus, as a practical matter,\nwe think it beyond possibility for fairminded dispute that the\n“scope and content of [Johnson’s] job responsibilities” did not\ninclude speaking to his class in his classroom during class\nhours. Cf. Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 424. \n13We acknowledge that the district court determined that the banners\nwere not part of Johnson’s curriculum. This finding is irrelevant, however,\nto the question of whether Johnson spoke as a citizen  or as an employee.\nDowns, 228 F.3d at 1015 (“Whether or not the bulletin boards by them-\nselves may be characterized as part of the school district’s  ‘curriculum’ is\nunimportant, because curriculum is only one  outlet of a school district’s\nexpression of its policy.”);  Peloza v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist. , 37\nF.3d 517, 522-23 (9th Cir. 1994). \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17345\n[10] We consider next our legal inquiry: whether John-\nson’s speech owes its existence to his position, or whether he\nspoke  just as any non-employee citizen  could  have.  The\nanswer is clear; he spoke as an employee.  Downs, 228 F.3d\nat 1015; see also Peloza, 37 F.3d at 522-23. Certainly, John-\nson did not act as a citizen when he went to school  and taught\nclass, took attendance, supervised students,  or regulated their\ncomings-and-goings;  he  acted  as a teacher—a government\nemployee. Cf. Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 422 (“Ceballos did not\nact as a citizen when he went about conducting his daily pro-\nfessional activities, such as supervising attorneys, investigat-\ning charges, and preparing filings. . . . When he  went to work\nand performed the tasks he was paid to perform,  Ceballos\nacted as a government employee.”). Similarly, Johnson  did\nnot  act  as an ordinary citizen when “espousing God as\nopposed to no God” in his classroom.  Peloza, 37 F.3d at\n522-23; Mayer, 474 F.3d at 479-80 (“The  Constitution does\nnot entitle teachers to present personal views to  captive audi-\nences against the instructions of  elected officials.”); see Lee,\n484 F.3d at 695. \nAs we recognized in Peloza,14 teachers do not cease acting\nas teachers each time the bell rings or the conversation moves\nbeyond the narrow topic of curricular  instruction. Peloza, 37\nF.3d at 522; see Downs, 228 F.3d at 1015. Rather, because of\nthe position of trust and authority they hold and the impres-\nsionable young minds with which they interact, teachers  nec-\nessarily act as teachers for purposes of a  Pickering inquiry\nwhen at school or a school function, in the general presence\n14We are not persuaded by the district court’s attempt to distinguish\nPeloza. Though it is true that  Peloza only barred religious speech during\n“instructional  time,”  Johnson,  2010 WL 768856, at *16, the court\naccepted the school district’s expansive definition  of “instructional time,”\ni.e., “any time students are required to be on campus as  well as the time\nstudents  immediately arrive for the purposes of attending  school  for\ninstruction, lunch time, and the time immediately prior to students’  depar-\nture after the instructional day.”  Peloza, 37 F.3d at 522. The setting for\nJohnson’s speech fell well within that expansive definition. \n\n17346 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nof students, in a capacity one might reasonably view as officia15l.\nPeloza, 37 F.3d at 522; Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1210, 1212-13 (“A\nteacher appears to speak for the state when he or  she teaches;\ntherefore, the department may permissibly restrict such reli-\ngious advocacy.”)16; see Aguillard, 482 U.S. at 584 (“The\nState exerts great authority and  coercive power through man-\ndatory attendance requirements, and because of the students’\nemulation of teachers as role models and the children’s sus-\nceptibility to peer pressure.”);  Downs, 228 F.3d at 1015;  see\nalso Berry, 447 F.3d at 651-52 (discussing displays in public\nareas of government offices).\n[11] An ordinary citizen could not  have walked into John-\nson’s classroom and decorated the walls as he or she saw fit,\nanymore than an ordinary citizen could demand that students\nremain in their seats and listen to whatever  idiosyncratic per-\nspective or sectarian viewpoints he or she wished to share.\nSee Peloza, 37 F.3d at 522-23;  Mayer, 474 F.3d at 479-80;\nLee, 484 F.3d at 695. Unlike Pickering,  who wrote a letter to\nhis local newspaper as any citizen might, 391 U.S. at 564, or\nGivhan,  who met with her school’s principal, a  fellow\nemployee  who  willingly “opened his office door to” her\nspeech, 439 U.S. at 415, Johnson took advantage of his posi-\ntion to press his particular views upon the impressionable and\n“captive”  minds  before him.  See  Aguillard,  482 U.S. at\n583-84; Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1203.\n15We emphasize that teachers may still speak as government employees\nif fewer than all three conditions are met. \n16In Tucker, we concluded that the California Department of Education\nhad impermissibly curtailed the First Amendment rights of one of its com-\nputer analysts, an employee with “no educational function whatsoever” or\nany interaction with the public, when it precluded him from discussing his\nreligious beliefs at work. 97 F.3d at 1208, 1212-13. We concluded, how-\never, that the result of our  Pickering-based analysis would have been\nwholly different had the department’s decision “applied to teachers acting\nin their role as teachers, or to department employees addressing the public\nin their official capacities.” Id. at 1213; see Berry, 447 F.3d at 650, 652.\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17347\nFinally, as Downs demonstrates, we need not reach a differ-\nent  conclusion simply because Poway  allows  its  teachers\nsome freedom in decorating their classrooms. 228 F.3d at\n1011-12. In Downs, high school teachers and other staff mem-\nbers created a bulletin board in a school  hallway on which\nstaff could post, pursuant to a school board policy, materials\nrelated to “Gay and Lesbian Awareness Month.”  Id. at 1006.\nLike Poway’s policy for classroom decoration, “[m]aterials\ndid not need approval before posting on the  Gay and Lesbian\nAwareness bulletin boards, but were subject to the  oversight\nof the school principal, who had ultimate authority within  the\nschool over the content of the boards.” Id. Also like Poway’s\npolicy, the school policy at issue in  Downs permitted only\nfaculty and staff to post materials, but allowed “[m]aterials\n. . . cover[ing] a wide range of topics” to be posted.  Id. \nDissatisfied  with the materials being posted by his co-\nworkers, Downs decided to counteract their message by hang-\ning a competing bulletin board on which he posted his own\nanti-homosexual  materials.  Id.  at 1006-07. After  his  co-\nworkers  complained,  the  school  district ordered that he\nremove his board and  materials. Id. at 1007. Like Johnson,\nDowns sued. Id. at 1008. \n[12] On appeal, we quickly cast aside Downs’s contention,\nechoed by Johnson today, that the school had  created a lim-\nited public forum either by allowing teachers to post materials\nof their choosing or by not “strictly policing” those materials\nposted and had thus relinquished its right to restrict the view-\npoints expressed.17 Id. at 1011-12; Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1209.18\n17This contention is also repudiated by the fact that  Johnson and his co-\nworkers are all employees of the school and therefore  not members of the\n“public.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 47 (rejecting the argument that a limited-\npublic forum had been created because the school had not “opened its mail\nsystem for indiscriminate use by the general public” but rather had permit-\nted only entities “affiliated with the schools” to use the system). \n18In Tucker, the Court flatly rejected the contention that a public forum\ncould be created through mere inaction: \n\n17348 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nWe concluded that it would be better “to focus on who actu-\nally was responsible for the speech on  Leichman High’s . . .\nbulletin  boards”: the government.  Downs,  228 F.3d at\n1011-12.\nOnly school faculty and staff had access to post\nmaterials on these boards. While these faculty and\nstaff  members may have received  materials  from\noutside organizations, the faculty and staff members\nalone posted material on the bulletin boards,  and at\nall times their postings were  subject to the oversight\nof the school principals. Although much, if not all,\nof  what  Downs  posted  appeared on the bulletin\nboard  directly  across  the  hall from his assigned\nclassroom, the proximity of the  board to his class-\nroom detracts in no way from the conclusion that the\nbulletin board, like all others  in Leichman High’s\nhalls, were the property and  responsibility of Leich-\nman High and LAUSD. That Leichman High’s prin-\ncipals  do  not spend the majority of their days\nroaming the school’s halls strictly  policing—or, in\nDowns’s point of view, censoring—the school’s bul-\nletin  boards does not weaken our conclusion that\nthere is no genuine issue of  material fact concerning\nwhether [the principals] had the authority to enforce\nand give voice to school  district and school board\nIn Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 802\n. . . (1985), the Court stated, “[t]he government  does not create\na public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but\nonly by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public\ndiscourse.” (emphasis added). Assuming that Tucker and  his co-\nworkers talked about whatever they wanted to at work (before the\npassage of the challenged order), and that they posted all sorts of\nmaterials on the walls, that still would not show that the govern-\nment had intentionally opened up the workplace for public dis-\ncourse. \n97 F.3d at 1209. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17349\npolicy. Inaction does not necessarily demonstrate a\nlack of ability or authority to act.\n* * *\nWe do not face an  example of the government\nopening up a forum for either unlimited or limited\npublic discussion. Instead, we face an example of the\ngovernment opening up its own mouth . . . .\nId. at 1011-12. Accordingly, the board could “ ‘take legiti-\nmate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message [wa]s\nneither garbled nor distorted’ by its individual messengers,”\nincluding ordering Downs to  curtail his speech. Id. at 1011,\n1013 (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833 (“[W]hen the\ngovernment appropriates public funds to promote a particular\npolicy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes.”)). We\nsee no reason why the logic of Downs should not apply in the\npresent case.19 Johnson spoke as an employee, not as a citizen.\n[13] In sum, nothing in our holding today prevents John-\nson from himself propounding his  own opinion on “the reli-\ngious heritage and nature of our nation” or how “God places\nprominently in our Nation’s history.” “Subject to any applica-\nble forum analysis, he may [generally] do so on the sidewalks,\n19We again disagree with the district court’s treatment of our controlling\ncase law. Not all the materials posted on the bulletin boards in  Downs\n“were supplied by the school district,” and Downs did not post his materi-\nals on boards provided and erected by the  school. 228 F.3d at 1006, 1011\n(“Downs created his own bulletin board”).  Contra Johnson, 2010 WL\n768856, at *17. \nMoreover, even if true, these forced distinctions are immaterial. So long\nas it is still the school’s walls being adorned and the school’s charges\nbeing indoctrinated, the school acts well within its power. Berry, 447 F.3d\nat 651 (“[T]he government ‘has a greater interest in controlling what mate-\nrials are posted on its property than it does in controlling the speech of the\npeople who work for it.’ ” (quoting Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1214)); Peloza, 37\nF.3d at 522; Lee, 484 F.3d at 695. \n\n17350 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nin the parks, through the chat-rooms, at his dinner table, and\nin countless other locations.” Id. at 1016 (citing Rust v. Sulli-\nvan, 500 U.S. 191, 198 (1991)). “He may not do so, however,\nwhen he is speaking as the government, unless the govern-\nment allows him to be its voice.” Id.; see Pleasant Grove, 129\nS. Ct. at 1131 (“The Free Speech Clause  restricts government\nregulation of private speech; it does not regulate government\nspeech.”). Because the speech at issue owes  its existence to\nJohnson’s position as a teacher, Poway acted well within con-\nstitutional limits in ordering Johnson not to speak in a manner\nit did not desire.  Ceballos, 547 U.S.  at 421-22; Downs, 228\nF.3d at 1013 (citing Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at  833); Peloza,\n37 F.3d at 522-23.\nB\nIf the displays at issue in this case did not concern religion,\nour identification of the speech  as the government’s would\nend our inquiry.  Ceballos, 547 U.S. at 421-22. As we have\ndiscussed, the Free Speech Clause “has no application”  to\ngovernment speech, Pleasant Grove, 129 S. Ct. at  1131, and,\nas we will discuss, individuals like Johnson have no personal\ninterest in government speech on which to base an equal pro-\ntection claim, Downs, 228 F.3d at 1017;  see Ceballos, 547\nU.S. at 421-22. In regard to those claims, the bare fact that the\nspeech belongs to the government is dispositive.\nThe  same  cannot be said for the Establishment Clause,\nhowever. That Clause does apply to government speech. E.g.,\nPleasant Grove, 129 S. Ct. at 1131-32 (noting that the “in-\nvolvement of public officials in advocacy may be limited by\nlaw,  regulation, or practice,” including the  Establishment\nClause).  And thus the government could run afoul of  the\nClause either through its speech, id., or, as argued by Johnson,\nthrough its act to curtail its speech—in  this case, the display\nof the banners,20 see Vasquez v. L.A. Cnty. , 487 F.3d 1246,\n20To be clear, Johnson and amici err in asserting that Poway could  only\ncurtail Johnson’s display if the banners violated the Establishment Clause.\nIn fact, the opposite is true. Poway may freely curtail  its own speech\nunless that curtailment runs afoul of the Establishment Clause. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17351\n1247-48,  1254-58 (9th Cir. 2007) (evaluating whether  the\nremoval of a cross from the Los Angeles  County seal “con-\nveyed a state-sponsored message of hostility toward Chris-\ntians” in contravention of the Establishment Clause). In short,\nas Johnson complains, that Poway’s “policy, practice, and/or\ncustom, of prohibiting [the] banners,” while permitting  other\ndisplays,21 “conveys an impermissible, government-sponsored\nmessage of disapproval of and hostility toward the Christian\nreligion . . . and our Nation’s Judeo-Christian heritage.” 22\nThe district court found that the government had done just\nthat;  it ruled that Poway  had  violated  the  Establishment\nClause  by endorsing “Buddhist, Hindu, and anti-religious\nspeech  .  . . while silencing the Judeo-Christian speech of\nJohnson.” Johnson, 2010 WL 768856, at *19. We review that\nconclusion de novo, Vasquez, 487 F.3d at  1254, and believe\nthe claim involves two distinct but  related contentions. First,\nthat Poway evidenced a hostility toward Judeo-Christianity in\ncurtailing the display of the banners, and second, that it dis-\nplayed a hostility toward Judeo-Christianity and  an endorse-\nment  of  other  religious  beliefs  via its presentation of the\n“other displays.”\n[14] We start with the basics. The Establishment  Clause\ndoes not wholly preclude the government from referencing\nreligion. Grove v. Mead Sch. Dist. No. 354 , 753 F.2d 1528,\n1534 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Not all mention of religion is prohib-\nited in public schools.”); see also Stone v. Graham, 449 U.S.\n39, 42 (1980) (per curiam) (“[T]he Bible may constitutionally\n21To recap, we refer to the Tibetan prayer flags; a John Lennon poster\nwith “Imagine” lyrics; a Mahatma Gandhi poster; a poster of Gandhi’s “7\nSocial Sins”; a Dalai Lama poster; a poster that  says, “The hottest places\nin hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral  crisis, maintain\ntheir neutrality”; and a poster of Malcolm X. \n22We think it worthwhile to note the inherent inconsistency of Johnson’s\nclaims. If Johnson’s speech does not contain some religious import, then\nwe would be hard-pressed to see how the cessation  of that speech evi-\ndences a “hostility toward the Christian religion.” \n\n17352 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nbe used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics,\ncomparative religion, or the like.”). Not only would  such a\ndrastic and draconian requirement raise substantial difficulties\nas to what might be left to talk about, but, as the  district court\ntook great pains to point out, it would  require that we ignore\nmuch of our own history and that of the world in general.23 Cf.\nGrove, 753 F.2d at 1534 (noting  Stone).\n[15] Rather,  what the Clause requires is  “governmental\nneutrality”—“neutrality  between religion and religion, and\nbetween religion and nonreligion.”  McCreary Cnty., Ky. v.\nACLU of Ky., 545 U.S. 844, 860 (2005) (quoting Epperson v.\nArkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968)) (other  citations omitted).\nIt requires that the government “not be overtly  hostile to reli-\ngion  but also that it may not place its prestige, coercive\nauthority,  or  resources behind a single religious faith or\nbehind religious belief in general, compelling nonadherents to\nsupport  the practices or proselytizing of  favored  religious\norganizations and conveying the message that those who  do\nnot contribute gladly are less than full members  of the com-\nmunity.” Tex. Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock , 489 U.S. 1, 9 (1989)\n(plurality opinion); see Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602,\n612 (1971). In essence, the Clause serves not as a closed door,\nbut as a judicious chaperone; it permits a certain degree of\nimpartial and friendly dialogue, but is swift to step in once\nthat dialogue turns stigmatic or coercive. Tex. Monthly, 489\nU.S. at 9; Trunk v. City of San Diego, 629 F.3d 1099, 1109\n(9th Cir. 2011); see McCreary Cnty., 545 U.S. at 876 (“‘The\nconstitutional obligation of “neutrality” . . . is not so narrow\na  channel that the slightest deviation from an absolutely\nstraight course leads to  condemnation.’” (quoting Sherbert,\n374 U.S. at 422 (Harlan, J., dissenting), with approval)). \n23For instance, one could not discuss Egyptian pyramids, Greek philoso-\nphers, the Crusades, or the Mayflower if even incidental or colloquial ref-\nerences  to objects or individuals  of  religious  significance  were\nconstitutionally taboo. \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17353\n[16] To determine whether the government has strayed too\nfar from the straight course, we continue to apply the three-\nfactor test set forth in  Lemon. “Under Lemon, a government\nact is consistent with the Establishment Clause if it: (1) has\na secular purpose; (2) has a principal or primary effect that\nneither advances nor disapproves of religion; and (3) does not\nfoster excessive governmental entanglement with religion.”\nVasquez,  487 F.3d at  1255  (citing  Lemon,  403 U.S. at\n612-13); accord McCreary  Cnty., 545 U.S. at 859, 875. We\nhave noted, however, that “[i]n recent  years, the Supreme\nCourt essentially has collapsed these last two prongs to ask\n‘whether the challenged governmental practice has the effect\nof endorsing religion.’ ” Trunk, 629 F.3d at 1106 (quoting\nAccess Fund v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 499 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th\nCir. 2007) (reviewing cases)). We also note that these factors\nare not to be applied in a vacuum. Pleasant Grove, 129 S. Ct.\nat 1136. Context is critical when evaluating the government’s\nconduct.  Cnty.  of Allegheny v. ACLU Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter, 492 U.S. 573, 598 (1989) (“Under the Court’s hold-\ning in Lynch, the effect of a crèche display turns on its setting.\nHere, unlike in  Lynch, nothing in the context of the display\ndetracts from the crèche’s religious message.”); accord Trunk,\n629 F.3d at 1102; Grove, 753 F.2d at 1534.\n[17] Applying Lemon to the undisputed facts before us, we\nfind no violation. First, Poway did not contravene the Clause\nwhen it ordered that Johnson’s banners be  removed. “The\nCourt has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance\nwith the Establishment Clause in  elementary and secondary\nschools.” Aguillard, 482 U.S. at 583-84 (“Families entrust\npublic schools with the education of their children, but condi-\ntion their trust on the understanding that the classroom will\nnot purposely be used to advance religious views that  may\nconflict with the private beliefs of the student and his  or her\nfamily.”).  For  that reason, “[w]e have made it clear that\n‘[g]overnmental actions taken to avoid potential Establish-\nment Clause violations have a valid secular purpose  under\nLemon.’” Nurre v. Whitehead, 580 F.3d 1087, 1096 (9th Cir.\n\n17354 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n2009) (quoting Vasquez, 487 F.3d at 1255), cert. denied 130\nS. Ct. 1937 (2010); Peloza, 37 F.3d at 522. \n[18] Moreover,  action  taken  to “avoid conflict with the\nEstablishment Clause” and maintain the very neutrality the\nClause requires neither has a primary effect of  advancing or\ninhibiting religion nor excessively entangles government with\nreligion. Nurre, 580 F.3d at 1097-98;  Vasquez, 487 F.3d at\n1257-58; see Sch. Dist. of Abington Twp., Pa. v. Schempp ,\n374 U.S. 203, 225-26 (1963) (rejecting the contention that the\nabsence  of religion equates to  “affirmatively  opposing  or\nshowing  hostility to religion”). Notably,  as  in  Nurre  and\nVasquez, we do not, and need not, “adjudge the constitutional-\nity of the” display in question in order to resolve the govern-\nment’s ability to curtail that bit of its own speech.  Vasquez,\n487 F.3d at 1257;  accord Nurre, 580 F.3d at 1097-98.  It is\nenough to note that our precedent and that of our sister cir-\ncuits demonstrate that the government’s ongoing display of\nthe banners would raise at least the possibility of an Establish-\nment Clause claim.24 Cf. Tucker, 97 F.3d at 1213;  Lee, 484\nF.3d at 695; see Berry, 447 F.3d at 650-51. Poway was enti-\ntled to summary judgment on this  aspect of Johnson’s claim.\n24We would not be the first to recognize the difficult  position govern-\nment offices often find themselves in when trying to “run the  gauntlet”\nbetween not being sued under the Establishment Clause for speaking  in a\nmanner some might perceive as unconstitutionally “pro-religious” and not\nbeing sued under the very same Clause for ceasing that speech—an action\nthat, as this case demonstrates, may be equally offensive to others.  See,\ne.g., Nurre, 580 F.3d at 1097; cf. Berry, 447 F.3d at 650. As our precedent\ndemonstrates, government action—especially the curtailment of its own\nspeech—taken on account of an honest interest in ensuring neutrality gen-\nerally passes constitutional muster. Nurre, 580 F.3d at 1097-98; Vasquez,\n487 F.3d at 1255-57. However, we also  recognize that this is not always\nthe case. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 270-71  (1981) (applying\nLemon to conclude that a university’s refusal to allow  religious groups\naccess to its facilities was not justified  by its fear of an Establishment\nClause issue because no tenable Clause issue would exist). \n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17355\nIn evaluating the constitutionality of the other displays, we\nthink the court neglected its own admonishment that govern-\nment speech “‘[s]imply having religious content or promot-\ning a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not\nrun afoul of the Establishment Clause.’ ” Johnson, 2010 WL\n768856, at *6 (alteration in original) (quoting  Van Orden v.\nPerry, 545 U.S. 677, 690 (2005) (plurality opinion)). Admit-\ntedly, Gandhi, the Dalai Lama, and Malcolm X each have\nsome  religious connotation. However, as the district  court\nnoted, simple connotation does not run afoul of  Lemon. Van\nOrden, 545 U.S. at 691-92. The same is true of the other post-\ners. See Pleasant Grove, 129 S. Ct. at 1135 (describing John\nLennon’s song “Imagine” in its discussion of speech that may\nhave different meanings to different people); Grove, 753 F.2d\nat 1534 (discussing The Learning Tree). Each would be viola-\ntive only if used to endorse or inhibit religion, and nothing in\nthe record suggests such use here.\nThe Tibetan prayer flags are no different. Though some\namici suggest that the flags are so recognizably  religious that\ntheir use “as an instrument of religion cannot be gainsaid,”\nSchempp, 374 U.S. at 224 (discussing the Bible);  see Stone,\n449 U.S. at 41 (Bible and Ten Commandments),  the record\ncontains only evidence to the contrary. Lori Brickley, the sci-\nence teacher who provided the flags, testified that she had no\nidea as to whether the flags had any  particular or significant\nreligious import, only that she had been  told they represented\n“the basic elements” Tibetan people believe “necessary for\ntheir life.” She also noted that though one of the flags contains\na small picture of Buddha not one of her students had  ever\nidentified the flags as religious.\nFurthermore, Brickley testified that the flags were neither\nhung nor used for any religious  purpose. She explained that\nshe uses the flags as part of her discussion of fossils found  on\nand near Mount Everest because the flags are authentic—\nbought in Nepal near Mount  Everest—and are typically pur-\nchased by climbers to put “at the  top of Mount Everest when\n\n17356 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthey reach the peak.” She described how she typically  shows\na video of scientists taking cores samples on Everest and uses\nthe flags to further stimulate the interest of her students. She\nsaid  that  the flags “represent climbing a mountain” and\naccomplishing “an amazing goal.” \nLimited to these facts, we would not think that an objective\nobserver could conclude that the flags were displayed for  a\nreligious purpose. McCreary Cnty., 545 U.S. at 862 (“The\neyes that look to purpose belong to an ‘objective observer,’\none who takes account of the traditional  external signs that\nshow up in the . . . official act.” (citations and internal quota-\ntion marks omitted)); id. at 859 (noting the rarity of finding\na religious purpose). Rather, the undisputed evidence supports\na  common-sense conclusion that the flags  are  intended  to\nstimulate scientific interest, not religious pressure  (or even\npermissible religious discussion). Id. at 863;  cf. Stone, 449\nU.S. at 42.\n[19] Of course, because the speech is the government’s,\nBrickley’s purpose is not dispositive.  Pleasant Grove, 129 S.\nCt. at 1136 (“Contrary to respondent’s  apparent belief, it fre-\nquently is not possible to identify a single ‘message’ that is\nconveyed by an object or structure, and consequently, the\nthoughts or sentiments expressed by  a government entity that\naccepts and displays such an object may be quite different\nfrom those of either its creator or its donor.”). Poway’s policy\nprohibiting sectarian and religious displays only  further sup-\nports a conclusion of secular purpose.  McCreary Cnty., 545\nU.S. at 863 (“[T]he government’s action was held unconstitu-\ntional only because openly available data supported a com-\nmonsense conclusion that a religious objective permeated the\ngovernment’s action.”).\nIn regard to “endorsement”—Lemon factors two and three\n—the  evidence again suggests the absence of a  violation.\nThough the flags may very well represent the Buddhist  faith,\ntheir use by Poway has nothing to do with their religious con-\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17357\nnotation. Instead, the evidence in  this case demonstrates that\nthe district uses the flags to stimulate  interest in science and\nscientific discovery without any mention of religion. Thus,\nwhile the flags might themselves contain “religious content,”\nVan Orden, 545 U.S. at 690, the primary effect of the school’s\nuse was entirely secular and fostered no entanglement  with\nreligion. Cf. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13. Unlike in Allegheny,\nthe “context of the display” here sufficiently  “detracts” from\nany religious message the flags might otherwise convey.  See\n492 U.S. at 598. Any residual  religious effect was therefore\nanodyne,  not stigmatic.  Trunk,  629 F.3d at 1109 (“By\n‘endorsement,’ we are not concerned with  all forms of gov-\nernment approval of religion—many of which are anodyne—\nbut rather those acts that send the stigmatic message to nonad-\nherents ‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the politi-\ncal community, and an accompanying message to adherents\nthat they are insiders, favored members . . . .’ ” (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S.\n290, 309-10 (2000)) (citation and  internal quotation marks\nomitted)).\n[20] Because neither Poway’s removal of Johnson’s  ban-\nners nor its display of other materials violated  the Clause, the\ndistrict  court  should  have granted summary judgment to\nPoway, not Johnson. We reverse the court’s judgment as to\nJohnson’s  Establishment  Clause  claim and remand with\ninstructions  that it enter summary judgment in  favor  of\nPoway.\nC\nFinally, we reach Poway’s claim that the district court erred\nin granting Johnson summary judgment on his claim that the\ndistrict court denied him equal protection of the law when it\nordered that he remove his banners but continued to permit\nthe  display  of other posters and materials that Johnson\nbelieves exhibit sectarian viewpoints. We again  agree with\nPoway that the court erred.\n\n17358 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nOur resolution of Johnson’s freedom of speech and  Estab-\nlishment Clause claims leaves little room for  discussion. All\nthe speech of which Johnson complains belongs to the  gov-\nernment,  and the government has the  right  to  “speak  for\nitself.” Pleasant Grove, 129 S. Ct. at 1131 (citation and inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). When it does, “it is entitled to\nsay what it wishes,”  Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at  833, “and to\nselect the views that it wants to express.” Pleasant Grove, 129\nS. Ct. at 1131 (citing Nat’l Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524\nU.S. 569, 598 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“It is the very\nbusiness of government to favor and disfavor points of view\n. . . .”)).\n[21] Because Johnson had no individual right to speak for\nthe government, he could not have suffered  an equal protec-\ntion violation. Downs, 228 F.3d at 1017  (“Because we deter-\nmine that Downs has no First Amendment right to speak for\nthe government, his equal protection claim  based upon the\ndeprivation of this asserted right also fails  to withstand sum-\nmary  judgment.”);  see  Ceballos,  547 U.S. at  421-22\n(“Restricting  speech that owes its  existence  to  a  public\nemployee’s professional responsibilities does not infringe any\nliberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.\nIt simply reflects the exercise of employer control  over what\nthe employer itself has commissioned or created.”). \n[22] We  reverse and remand to  the  district  court  with\ninstructions to enter judgment in favor of Poway on this issue.\nIV\nIn conclusion, we agree with the district court that no genu-\nine issue of material fact remains in the present case. How-\never,  the  district  court made a critical error when it\ndetermined that Poway had created a limited public forum for\nteacher speech and evaluated Poway’s actions under a tradi-\ntional  forum-based analysis rather  than  the  controlling\nPickering-based inquiry. Applying the correct legal principles\n\nJOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 17359\nto the undisputed facts before us, we  conclude that Poway\nwas entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each of  the\nclaims raised by Johnson.\nWe thus reverse and remand with instructions that the dis-\ntrict court vacate its grant of injunctive and declaratory relief,\nas well as its award of damages, and enter summary judgment\nin favor of Poway and its officials on all claims. Johnson shall\nbear all costs. Fed. R. App. P. 39(a)(3).\nREVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.\n\n17360 JOHNSON v. POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT\nAPPENDIX\n\nJOHNSON v.

It has been  \"the unmistakable holding\"  of the  United  States  Supreme  Court for more than 50  [*6]  years that \nneither  \"students  [nor]  teachers  shed their constitutional rights to  freedom of speech or expression at the  schoolhouse \ngate.\"  Tinker v.  Des Moines Indep.  Cmty.  Sch.  Dist.,  393  U.S.  503,  506  (1969).  Defendants'  viewpoint-based restriction \non Plaintiff's  speech violates this well-established principle  of law. \n17.  Plaintiff is  a respected public  school teacher who has been teaching in the  School District for 30 years.  Plaintiff \nwas  and continues to be  a math teacher in the  School  District.  He presently teaches math at Westview High  School. \nDuring his  30 years  of teaching,  Plaintiff has taught math at 3  different high  schools in the  School District. \n18.  For approximately 25  years,  Plaintiff had continuously  displayed, without objection,  on his  classroom walls \nvarious banners that reflect the religious heritage  and history of our Nation.  Plaintiff had the banners made to  order by  a \nprivate  company  and purchased them with his personal  funds. \n19.  The  classroom in which the banners were  displayed 1s  assigned to  Plaintiff;  it 1s his  classroom for  \"homeroom\" \nand academic  classes.  It is  also the  classroom he uses  for non-curricular and extra-curricular activities.  [*7] \n20.  As  amatter of School  District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  Plaintiff has  discretion and control  over the \nmessages  displayed on his  classroom walls;  no  other teacher is permitted to  display materials  on these walls without \nPlaintiff's permission.  This has been the policy,  practice,  and custom in the  School District for at least the past 30 years. \n21.  Pursuant to  School District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  teachers  are permitted to  display in their classrooms \nvarious messages  and other items that reflect the individual teacher's personality,  opinions,  and values,  as well  as \nmessages relating to matters  of political,  social,  or other similar concerns  so long  as these  displayed items  do not \nmaterially  disrupt school work or cause  substantial  disorder or interference  in the  classroom.  As  a result of this  School \nDistrict policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  the  classroom walls  serve  as  an expressive vehicle  for teachers to  convey \nnon-curriculum related messages. \n22.  Pursuant to this  long-standing policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  teachers have  displayed and continue to  display \nin their classrooms  such non-educational  and non-curricular materials  as posters  of rock bands,  such  [*8]  as Nirvana \nand  The  Clash,  posters  of professional  athletes,  travel posters,  family photographs,  various non-student artwork, \nincluding posters  of such artwork,  and even a collection of stuffed animals.  Teachers have been permitted to  display \nposters with Buddhist and Islamic messages  and Tibetan prayer flags.  And teachers have  displayed nature pictures  and \nother matters promoting the  environment.  The  displayed items  contain messages that express the personal views, \ninterests,  or opinions  of the teachers  and/or relate to matters  of political,  social,  or other similar concerns.  The teachers \ncontrol the messages  conveyed by their displays.  The teachers’  displays  do not constitute  government speech nor the \nspeech of the  School District. \n23.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom of permitting teachers to  display messages,  including non-curricula\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings 212047;  2007 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings LEXIS  25029,  *8 \nmessages,  on their classroom walls  creates  a forum for the teachers to  engage  in expressive  activity.  Plaintiff's banners \nwere  displayed pursuant to this policy,  practice,  and/or custom.  Plaintiff's banners were not displayed pursuant to  any  of \nhis  official  duties  as  a teacher.  Plaintiff did not use the banners  during  any  classroom  [*9]  session or period of \ninstruction.  Plaintiff's banners were not expressing  a message  on behalf of the  School  District. \n24.  Plaintiff's banners  contain the  following historical phrases:  \"In God We  Trust,\"  the  official motto  of the  United \nStates;  \"One Nation Under God,\"  the  1954  amendment to the  Pledge  of Allegiance;  \"God Bless  America,\"  a patriotic \nsong  considered to be the unofficial national  anthem of the  United  States;  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee,\"  a line  from \n\"America the  Beautiful,\"  a popular patriotic  song;  and  \"All Men Are  Created Equal,  They Are  Endowed By Their \nCreator,\"  an excerpt from the preamble to the  Declaration of Independence. \n25.  Plaintiff displayed two  such banners  in his  classroom,  along with other items,  including photographs  of nature \nscenes  and national parks  and pictures  of his  family. \n26.  Plaintiff's  first banner,  which 1s red,  white,  and blue,  depicting the  colors  of our national  flag,  includes the \nphrases  \"In God We  Trust,\"  \"One Nation Under God,\"  \"God Bless America,\"  and  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee.\"  Each \nphrase  appears  on a separate line  and could be  displayed individually.  Plaintiff continuously displayed a paper version \nof this banner for approximately  [*10]  8 years,  and he  continuously  displayed the present version,  which is made  of \nmore  durable material,  for approximately  17 years.  The present version is  an exact replica of the paper version. \nTherefore,  the message  of this banner was  displayed continuously  for approximately 25  years. \n27.  Plaintiff's  second banner includes the phrase  \"All Men Are  Created Equal,  They Are Endowed By  Their \nCreator.\"  This banner was  continuously  displayed for approximately  17 years. \n28.  Each banner measures  approximately  7  feet long by 2  feet wide  and was  continuously  displayed in a \nnon-obstructive manner.  Plaintiff's banners  do not contain any pictures  or symbols. \n29.  \"In God We  Trust\"  is the  official motto  of the  United  States.  A law passed by  Congress  and  signed by the \nPresident on July  30,  1956  approved a joint resolution of Congress that declared  \"In God we trust\"  the national motto  of \nthe  United  States. \n30.  Our national motto was taken from the poem  \"The  Star-Spangled Banner,\"  written by Francis  Scott Key in \n1814,  a verse  of which reads: \n\"Then conquer we must,  when our cause it is just,  And this be  our motto-'In God is  our Trust. tt \nKey's poem was  later adapted as  our national  anthem.  [*11] \n31.  The  government's use  of the phrase  \"In God We  Trust\"  has  a long history in this  country.  In  1865,  Congress \nfirst authorized the National  Mint to  include the phrase  on certain coins,  and in  1908,  Congress made its  inclusion \nmandatory.  In  1955, the phrase was placed on all  of our currency,  and one year later it became  our national motto.  \"In \nGod We  Trust\"  appears  above the  Speaker's  Chair in the  United  States  House  of Representatives  and above the main \ndoor of the  United  States  Senate  chamber. \n32.  On July 27,  2006,  President George  W.  Bush issued a proclamation officially recognizing the  50th anniversary \nof our national motto,  stating,  in part,  \"On the  50th anniversary  of our national motto,  'In God We  Trust,’  we reflect on \nthese words that guide millions  of Americans,  recognize the blessings  of the  Creator,  and offer our thanks  for His  great \ngift of liberty...  .  As we  commemorate the  50th anniversary  of our national motto  and remember with thanksgiving \nGod's mercies throughout our history,  we recognize  a divine plan that stands  above  all human plans  and continue to \nseek His will.” \n33.  In  1863,  at Gettysburg,  President Abraham Lincoln  stated,  \"[T]hat we here highly resolve  [*12]  that these  dead\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings 212047;  2007 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings  LEXIS  25029,  *12 \nshall not have  died in vain-that this nation, under God,  shall have  a new birth of freedom-and that government of the \npeople,  by the people,  for the people  shall not perish from the  earth.\" \n34.  In  1942,  Congress  enacted the Pledge  of Allegiance,  which was  amended in  1954 to  officially include the \nphrase  \"under God.\"  Then President Dwight David Eisenhower said this  about adding  \"under God\"  to the Pledge:  \"In \nthis way we  are reaffirming the transcendence  of religious  faith in America's heritage  and future;  in this way we  shall \nconstantly  strengthen those  spiritual weapons which forever will be  our country's most powerful resources  in peace  and \nwar.”  Students  in the  School District recite the  Pledge  of Allegiance  on a daily basis. \n35.  In 2002,  Congress passed legislation that made  extensive  findings  about the historic role  of religion in the \npolitical  development of our Nation and reaffirmed the reference to  \"one Nation under God\"  in the text of the Pledge,  as \nwell  as reaffirming that  \"God\"  remains in our National motto. \n36.  The preamble to the Declaration of Independence  states  as  follows:  \"We hold these truths to be  self-evident, \nthat all men are  created equal,  that  [*13]  they  are  endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights,  that among \nthese  are  Life,  Liberty  and the pursuit of Happiness.\"  The  Declaration of Independence is  our Nation's  founding \ndocument. \n37.  \"God Bless  America\"  is  an American patriotic  song written by Irving Berlin in  1918  and later revised by him in \n1938.  It is  often considered the unofficial national  anthem of the United States  and frequently played at public  events. \n38.  \"God  Shed His  Grace  on Thee\"  is  a well-known verse  from  \"America the Beautiful,\"  an American patriotic \nsong that rivals  \"The  Star-Spangled Banner,\"  the national  anthem,  in popularity.  \"America the  Beautiful\"  1s  often played \nat public  events. \n39.  During his  30 years  of teaching in the  School District,  Plaintiff has had 7  different school principals,  numerous \nschool board members,  superintendents,  assistant superintendents,  over 4,000  students  and several thousand parents in \nhis  classroom where the banners were  displayed.  Prior to this year,  Plaintiff had not recetved one  complaint about the \nbanners.  Students,  parents,  faculty,  board members,  and teachers  in the  School  District knew that Plaintiff posted the \nbanners  and that the message  conveyed by  [*14]  the banners reflected Plaintiff's  speech and not the  speech of the \nSchool District. \nAQ.  Plaintiff's banners  caused no  disruption or interference  in his  classroom  or anywhere  else  in the  school. \n41.  Plaintiff's  display of his banners has not interfered with the basic  education mission of the  School  District. \n42.  Plaintiff's  long-standing practice  of displaying his banners  came to  an abrupt end when on or about January 23, \n2007,  Defendants  ordered him to remove the banners based  solely  on the viewpoint of Plaintiff's message.  Specifically, \nDefendant Kastner told Plaintiff that his banners were  impermissible because they  conveyed a  \"Judeo-Christian\" \nviewpoint. \n43.  Defendants  did not claim that Plaintiff's banners  caused a material  disruption or  substantial  disorder in the \nschool  or that they interfered with the  curriculum.  Defendants had no  evidence that Plaintiff's banners  caused any \ndisruption or disorder.  Defendants  singled out Plaintiff for discriminatory treatment because  of the viewpoint of his \nmessage. \n44.  In  1952, the United States  Supreme  Court acknowledged the  following historical reality:  \"We  are  a religious \npeople whose  institutions presuppose  a Supreme Being.\"  Zorach  v.  Clauson,  343  U.S.  306,  313  (1952).  [*15]  From at \nleast  1789,  there has been an unbroken history of official  acknowledgment by  all three branches  of government of \nreligion's role  in American life.  Examples  of this historical  acknowledgment include Executive  Orders recognizing \nreligiously grounded National Holidays,  such as  Christmas  and Thanksgiving,  Congress  directing the President to \nproclaim a National Day  of Prayer each year,  and the printing on our currency  of the national motto,  \"In God We\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings 212047;  2007 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings  LEXIS  25029,  *15 \nTrust.\" \n45.  As the  United  States  Supreme  Court acknowledged in Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465  U.S.  668,  677-78  (1984): \nOne  cannot look  at even this brief resume  [of historical  examples  of public religious  expression]  without \nfinding that our history is pervaded by expressions  of religious beliefs...  .  Equally pervasive  is the \nevidence  of accommodation of all  faiths  and all  forms  of religious  expression,  and hostility toward none. \nThrough this  accommodation,  as  Justice  Douglas  observed,  governmental  action has  \"follow[ed]  the best \nof our traditions\"  and  \"respect[ed]  the religious nature  of our people.\"  (quoting Zorach,  343  U.S.  at 314). \n46.  Recognition of the role  of God 1n our Nation's  [*16]  history  and heritage  1s  consistently reflected in United \nState  Supreme  Court decisions.  The  Court has  acknowledged,  for example,  that religion has been closely identified with \nour history  and government,  and that the history  of man is inseparable  from the history  of religion.  Examples  of \npatriotic  invocations  of God and official  acknowledgments  of religion's role  in our Nation's history  abound.  As  Justice \nO'Connor observed,  \"It is unsurprising that a Nation founded by religious refugees  and dedicated to religious  freedom \nshould find references to  divinity in its  symbols,  songs,  mottoes,  and oaths.\"  H/A Grove  Unified Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow, \n342  U.S.  1,  35-36  (2004)  (O'Connor,  J.,  concurring in the judgment). \n47.  Efforts to  suppress this recognition and historical  acknowledgment,  as  demonstrated by Defendants'  action here, \nare the  antithesis  of the value  of religious tolerance that underlies the  United  States  and California Constitutions. \nCleansing  our Nation's  classrooms  of our religious heritage  and history  and imposing viewpoint restrictions  on  speech \nto  silence  such expressions  advance no legitimate  educational purpose nor are they reasonably related to  any legitimate \n[*17]  pedagogical  concerns. \n48.  Plaintiff's banners  showed aspects  of the history  and heritage  of our Nation.  Accordingly,  Plaintiff's banners \ntouched on a matter of public  concern and interest. \n49.  The  classroom is peculiarly the  \"marketplace  of ideas.\"  As  a result,  the First Amendment does not tolerate \ngovernmental policies,  practices,  and or customs that cast a pall  of orthodoxy  over the  classroom,  such as Defendants' \npolicy,  practice,  and/or custom at issue here,  which prohibits  Plaintiff from displaying his banners based on the \nviewpoint conveyed by the message. \n50.  It is  a fact that religious people  founded this Nation.  As  a result,  references to  God are  common in our  songs, \nmottoes,  and  slogans.  To ban  such references  from public  schools  serves no valid educational purpose. \n51.  Plaintiff wants to  display his banners.  However,  Defendants have prohibited him from doing  so by applying \nSchool District policy  so  as to  silence Plaintiff's  speech based on its viewpoint. \n52.  Defendants  claimed that Plaintiff's banners were impermissible because they convey  a  \"Judeo-Christian\" \nviewpoint.  Additionally,  Defendants  acknowledged that Plaintiffs banners were not displayed as part of his  official \n[*18]  duties  as  a teacher nor were they part of the  curriculum. \n53.  Defendants  admit that it is  entirely proper for Plaintiff to  display materials,  including posters  and banners, \n\"about the  foundation of our nation\"  in this  forum.  Thus,  the  subject matter of Plaintiff's banners was permitted,  and this \nsubject matter was  consistent with the purpose  served by the  forum.  Defendants,  however,  intended by the removal  of \nPlaintiff's banners to  suppress  ideas with which they disagreed,  thereby imposing a viewpoint-based restriction on \nspeech otherwise permitted in the  forum. \n54.  In fact,  Defendants’ prohibition of Plaintiff's banners  is  contrary to the prescriptions  of California Education \nCode  §  51511, which  specifically permits  \"references to religion\"  or  \"other things having  a religious  significance\"  in the \npublic  schools.\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings 212047;  2007 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings  LEXIS  25029,  *18 \n55.  As  evidenced by Defendants'  words  and actions,  Defendants  are prohibiting Plaintiff from  displaying his \nbanners  in his  classroom by  applying  School  District policy  so  as to impose  a viewpoint restriction on Plaintiff's  speech. \n56.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom of banning messages with a  \"Judeo-Christian\"  viewpoint as  applied \nto  Plaintiff's banners  serves  [*19]  no valid educational purpose,  1s not reasonably related to  any legitimate pedagogical \nconcern,  and conveys  a government-sponsored message  of disapproval  of and hostility toward religion,  in particular, the \nChristian religion and our Nation's Judeo-Christian heritage.  Moreover,  Defendants’  order to remove the banners was \nnot curriculum related;  Plaintiff was teaching and continues to teach his  assigned mathematics  curriculum. \n57.  Both the  United  States  and California Constitutions prohibit government action that disfavors  or 1s hostile \ntoward religion,  such as  Defendants’  actions  as  set forth in this  First Amended Complaint. \n58.  Had Plaintiff not complied with Defendants’  order to remove his banners,  Plaintiff would have  suffered adverse \nemployment consequences,  including  a possible reprimand,  suspension,  or loss  of employment. \nFIRST  CLAIM  FOR RELIEF \nViolation  of Freedom of Speech under  the First Amendment to  the United  States  Constitution \n59.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n60.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged in under color of state \nlaw,  Defendants have  imposed a viewpoint-based  [*20]  restriction on Plaintiff's  speech in violation of the Free  Speech \nClause  of the  First Amendment as  applied to the  states  and their political  subdivisions under the  Fourteenth Amendment \nto the  United  States  Constitution and 42  U.S.C.  $  1983. \n61.  As  a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the  Free  Speech Clause  of the  First Amendment, \nPlaintiff has  suffered irreparable harm,  including the  loss  of his  constitutional rights,  entitling him to  declaratory  and \ninjunctive relief and nominal  damages. \nSECOND  CLAIM  FOR RELIEF \nViolation  of the Establishment Clause  of the  First Amendment to  the United  States  Constitution \n62.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n63.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged in under color of state \nlaw,  Defendants have violated the Establishment Clause  of the  First Amendment to the United States  Constitution as \napplied to the  states  and their political  subdivisions under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States  Constitution \nand 42  U.S.C.  §  1983. \n64.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom of prohibiting  [*21]  Plaintiff's banners  lacks  a valid  secular \npurpose,  has the primary  effect of inhibiting religion,  and creates  an excessive  entanglement with religion in violation of \nthe  United  States  Constitution. \n65.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom conveys  an impermissible,  government-sponsored message  of \ndisapproval  of and hostility toward the  Christian religion and our Nation's religious heritage.  As  a result,  Defendants’ \npolicy,  practice,  and/or custom  sends  a clear message to Plaintiff that he  is  an outsider,  not a full member of the political \nand  school  community  and an accompanying message that those who  disfavor the  Christian religion and our Nation's \nJudeo-Christian heritage  are insiders,  favored members  of the political  and  school  community in violation of the United \nStates  Constitution. \n66.  As  a direct and proximate result of Defendants' violation of the  Establishment Clause  of the  First Amendment,\nPage  8 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Pleadings 212047;  2007 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.

Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n68.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged in under color of state \nlaw,  Defendants have unconstitutionally  deprived Plaintiff of the  equal protection of the law guaranteed under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the  United  States  Constitution and 42  U.S.C.  §  /983,  in that Defendants,  through their acts, \npolicies,  practices,  and/or customs, prevented Plaintiff from expressing  a message 1n a forum created by Defendants  for \nsuch messages, thereby  denying the use  of this  forum to those whose views  Defendants  find unacceptable. \n69.  As  a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violation of the  Equal Protection Clause  of the  Fourteenth \nAmendment,  Plaintiff has  suffered irreparable harm,  including the loss  of his  constitutional rights,  entitling him to \ndeclaratory  and injunctive relief and nominal  damages. \nFOURTH  CLAIM  FOR RELIEF \nViolation  of Freedom of Speech under  the California Constitution \n70.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n71.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  [*23]  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged in under color of \nstate  law,  Defendants have imposed a viewpoint-based restriction on Plaintiff's  speech in violation of Article  I,  §  2  of \nthe  California Constitution. \n72.  As  a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ violation of the  Liberty of Speech Clause  of the  California \nConstitution,  Plaintiff has  suffered irreparable harm,  including the loss  of his  constitutional right to  freedom of \nexpression,  entitling him to  declaratory  and injunctive relief and nominal  damages. \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation  of the No  Preference  Clause of the California  Constitution \n73.  Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n74.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged 1n under color of state \nlaw,  Defendants have violated Article  I,  Section 4  of the  California Constitution (\"No  Preference  Clause\"). \n75.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom of prohibiting Plaintiff's banners  lacks  a valid secular purpose, has \nthe primary  effect of inhibiting religion,  and creates  an excessive  entanglement with religion in violation of the \nCalifornia Constitution. \n76.  [*24]  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom conveys  an impermissible,  government-sponsored message \nof disapproval  of and hostility toward the  Christian religion and our Nation's religious heritage.  As  a result,  Defendants’ \npolicy,  practice,  and/or custom  sends  a clear message to Plaintiff that he  is  an outsider,  not a full member of the political \nand  school  community  and an accompanying message that those who  disfavor the  Christian religion and our Nation's \nJudeo-Christian heritage  are insiders,  favored members  of the political  and  school  community in violation of the \nCalifornia Constitution.\nPage  9 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.

Plaintiff hereby incorporates by reference  all  above-stated paragraphs. \n79.  By reason of the  aforementioned policy,  practice,  custom,  acts,  and omissions,  engaged 1n under color of state \nlaw,  Defendants  [*25]  have violated Article  I,  Section 4  of the  California Constitution (\"Establishment Clause\"). \n80.  Defendants’  policy,  practice,  and/or custom of prohibiting Plaintiff's banners  lacks  a valid secular purpose, has \nthe primary  effect of inhibiting religion,  and creates  an excessive  entanglement with religion in violation of the \nCalifornia Constitution. \n81.

The district court \nappropriately answered as follows: “On undisputed evidence, this Court holds that \nit may not.”  (R-66: Op. at 1; ER (Vol. 1) at 1).  This court should affirm. \nIn West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943),  the \nU.S.  Supreme Court stated, “If there is   any fixed star in our constitutional \nconstellation,  it is that  no  official,  high or petty,   can prescribe what shall be  \northodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.”  Id. at 642 \n(emphasis  added).  In dir ect  contravention, Defendants seek to prescribe what \n“shall  be  orthodox” in matt ers  of op inion  by permitting teach ers  to express \npersonal,  non-curricular messa ges  that prom ote  certain  favored  ideologies, \nreligions, and partisan viewpoints on controversial political and social issues, while \ncensoring certain disfavored viewpoints, such as Plain tiff’s allegedly “Christian” \n                                                           \n1\n All record citations in this brief are to  the four volume excerpts of record (“ER”) \nfiled by Appellants.  Appella nts’ ER contains the entire r ecord of the relevan t \nproceedings below. \n  1\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 11 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nviewpoint.  As a result of Defendants’ speech  restriction, that “fixed star” in our \nconstitutional  constellation has been  obscured  and an   official orthodoxy \nprescribed. \nIndeed, it is undisputed that Defendants created the forum for the personal, \nnon-curricular speech at issue here .  If Defendants wanted to close t he forum, \n2\nthey could.    The fact that they refuse to do so and instead seek to retain the power \nto permit the expression of viewpoints they  favor and censor those they do not  is \ndisturbing—and it is unconstitutional.  \nIn  the final analysi s,  Defendants  are  inviting  this court to rewrite First \nAmendment law to allow government officials to discriminate based on a speaker’s \nviewpoint.  This court should decline the invitation and affirm the decision below. \n \n                                                           \n2\n This fact alone underm ines the hyperbolic claims advanced by  Amici Curiae \nNational  School Boards Association and  California  School Boards Association \n(“NSBA & CSBA”) in their  brief filed in support of Defendants.  The distric t \ncourt’s decision, which followed well-established First Amendment jurisprudence, \ndoes not “border on allowi ng teachers to determ ine the curriculum.”  (NSBA  & \nCSBA Br. at 10).  And this is not a case where the government “open[ed] a forum \nby accident.”  (NSBA & CSBA Br. at 11).   As noted above, if Defendants wanted \nto close the forum t omorrow, they could.   The fact that Defendants refuse—and \nNSBA & CSBA support that decision—shows that this case is not about education \nor the students.  Rather, it is about sch ool administrators (i.e., the government) \nwanting to retain the  authority to prescribe what shall be ort hodox in matters of \nopinion.  As the U.S. Supreme Court stat ed long ago, “state-operated schools may \nnot be enclaves of totalitarianism.”   Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., \n393 U.S. 503, 511 (1969). \n  2\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 12 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES \nI.  Whether Defendants violated Plaintiff’s right to  freedom of speech \nprotected by the United States and California Constitutions by censoring Plaintiff’s \npersonal, non-curricular speech in a forum  they created for such speech based on \nPlaintiff’s viewpoint. \nII.  Whether Defendants violated the  Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment  to the United States Cons titution  and  the Establishm ent  and N o \nPreference  Clauses  of the California C onstitution  by offici ally  preferring t he \nexpression of certain religious and anti-religious views while censoring Plaintiff’s \nspeech because it expressed a “Judeo-Christian” view. \nIII.  Whether  Defendants violated th e  Equal Protection Clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by granting the  use of a \nforum  to teachers whose personal,  non-curricular  views Defendants find \nacceptable, but denying use of this forum to Plaintiff based on the viewpoint of his \npersonal, non-curricular speech. \nIV.  Whether  Defendants  were  entitled to qualified imm unity  in their \nindividual  capacities for violating Plain tiff’s  clearly established constitutiona l \nrights. \n \n \n  3\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 13 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nSTATEMENT OF THE FACTS \nPlaintiff is a public school m ath teacher at Westview High School in the \n3\nPoway Unified School Distri ct (hereinafter “School Distri ct”).    He has taught \nmath in the School District for more than 30 years.  During these 30 plus years, he \nhas taught at 3 diffe rent high schools in the di strict, including Mt. Carmel High \nSchool (1977 to 1989), Rancho Bernardo Hi gh School (1990 to 2002), and now \nWestview High School (2003 to present).  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶ 3; ER (Vol. 2) \nat 179-80).  Plaintiff has a strong reputation as a teacher; he continues to be one of \nthe highest rated math teachers at Westview High School.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at \n¶¶ 4, 36; ER (Vol. 2) at 180,  192; R-54:  Chiment Dep. at 24-25; ER (Vol. 3) at \n333; Kastner Dep. at 33; ER (Vol. 3) at 384).   \nThe  School District  believes  that publi c  schools play an im portant  role \neducating and guiding our yo uth through the mar ketplace of ideas and instilling \nnational values.  One method the School District uses to accomplish this task is to \npermit students to be exposed to the ric h diversity of backgrounds and opinions \n                                                           \n3\n  At all relevant times, Defendants  Jeff  Mangum, Linda Vanderveen, Andrew \nPatapow,  Todd Gutschow, and Penny Ranftle   were mem bers  of the Board of  \nEducation  for the School District; De fendant  Dr. Donald A. Phillips was the \nSuperintendent;  Defendant William   Chiment  was the Assistant/Associate \nSuperintendent; and Defendant Dawn Kastner was the Principal of Westview High \nSchool.  All of the defendants approved the decision to remove Plaintiff’s banners.  \n(R-26: Answer at 2; ER (Vol. 2) at 110;  R-54: Chiment Dep. at 130, 137-38; ER \n(Vol. 3) at 351-53; Kastner Dep. at 101-02, 172; ER (Vol. 3) at 391, 394). \n  4\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 14 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n4\nheld by its high school faculty.   (R-54: Chiment Dep. at 271-72; ER (Vol. 3) at  \n366). \nAccordingly, for the past 30 plus years, the School  District has adopted a \npolicy, practice, and/or custom of permitting teachers to display in their classrooms \nvarious  non-curricular  messages  and other ite ms  that reflect the indi vidual \nteacher’s personality, opinions, and values regarding a wi de range of interests and \nsubject matter.  Consequently, for the past 30 plus years, the classroom walls have \nserved and continue to serve as a foru m for teachers to  convey personal, non-\n5\ncurricular messages on subjects that interest them .   Indeed, Defendant Chim ent \ntestified  on behalf of the School Dist rict  as foll ows:  “You could make the \nargument that if the District were to say no one can put up anything up (sic) unless \nit’s absolutely curriculum related and these [Plaintiff’s banners] were up, then they \nwould violate it.  But our District has chos en - - and that would be perm issible, I \n                                                           \n4\n For example, in addition to creating  a forum for the personal, non-curricular \nspeech of its teachers, the School District permits its teachers to participate in the \n“day of silence”—a pro-gay rights activ ity—on School District property, during \nthe school day, with the students so l ong as the teacher’s participation does not \ndisrupt the teaching of his or her classes.

Ex. 6; ER (Vol. 3) at 372). \nPlaintiff’s long-standing practice of displaying his banners came to an abrupt \n27\nend in January, 2007, when Defendants  ordered Plaintiff to take them down.   \nDefendants directed Plaintiff to remove his banners because they believed that the \nbanners were promoting a “Christian” or “Judeo/Christian” viewpoint.  On behal f \nof the School District, Defendant Chiment sent a letter to Plaintiff expla ining the \norder  to rem ove  the banners.  In the  letter,  Defendant Ch iment  stated that  \n                                                           \n26\n During his first two years as a probatio nary teacher, Plaintiff was evaluated 3 \ntimes each year.  As a tenur ed teacher, Plaintiff is ev aluated twice a year, ever y \nother year by the School Dist rict.  Typically, the evaluation is performed by an \nassistant principal.  As part of the eval uation, the administrator observes Plaintiff \nteaching  in his classroom an d  evaluates  whether or not his teaching and his \nclassroom comport with School District standards and policies.  None of Plaintiff’s \nofficial evaluations over a 30-plus-year period ever indicated that his banners were \nimpermissible,  nor did any of Plaintiff’s evaluators ever inform   him that his \nbanners were impermissible or that the y disrupted or detracted from Plaintiff’s \nteaching or the students’ learning in any way.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶ 34; ER  \n(Vol. 2) at 191). \n27\n Prior to the School District’s order to  remove the banners i n 2007, the School \nDistrict received no complaints about the banners from students, teachers, parents, \nor School Board members.  The only com plaint to the School District came from \nDefendant Kastner in the fall of 2006, and this complaint resulted in the removal of \nthe banners.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 5, 33, 34, 37; ER (Vol. 2) at 180, 191-92; \nR-54: Chiment Dep. at 34-36; ER (Vol. 3) at 336). \n  14\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 24 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nPlaintiff’s banners conveyed an im permissible “sectarian viewpoint” and, more \nspecifically,  “a particular sect arian  viewpoint.”   The “particular sect arian \nviewpoint” noted in the letter was referri ng to the viewpoint of “t hose religious \ngroups who refer to a supreme being as  God,” such as Christians.  Defendant \nDawn  Kastner, Plaintiff’s pri ncipal  at  Westview High School, beli eved  that \nPlaintiff’s  banners were im permissible  because  they expre ssed  a “Christian” \nviewpoint.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 37- 39; ER (Vol. 2) at 192; R-54: Colli ns \nDep. at 43-44; ER (Vol. 3) at 301; Chiment Dep. at 29-31, 130, 133, 278; ER (Vol. \n3) at 334-35, 351, 368; Kast ner Dep. at 44-45, 101-02,  137, 172; ER (Vol. 3) at \n385-86, 391-92, 394; Dep.

Meanwhile, Defendants had \nno objection to a science teacher displaying a  35- to 40-foot string  of Tibetan \n28\nprayer flags, which are sacred items that promote the Buddhist religion.   In fact, \nthe science teacher who displ ays the prayer flags was not surprised that the flags \ncontained sacred text and prayers of Buddhists, noting quite accurately that “there \nwas a Buddhist picture on there.”  (R-54: Brickley Dep. at 90; ER (Vol. 3) at 406).  \nMoreover,  Defendants admit   that these per missible  prayer flags “ are  non-\n                                                           \n28 (See R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 11, 15, n.3;  ER (Vol. 2) at 181-84; Dep.

(Defs.’ P. & \nA. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ.

Defendants’ removal of Plaintiff’s banners was not curriculum related; \nPlaintiff  was teaching and continues  to  teach his assigned mathematics \n30\ncurriculum.   Defendants singled out Plaintiff for disfavored treatment because of \nthe viewpoint expressed by his message.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at ¶¶ 16, 35-39; ER \n(Vol. 2) at 188, 192; R-54: Collins Dep.  at 36-37, 43-44, 95; ER (Vol. 3) at 299,  \n301, 308: Chiment Dep. at 49-51, 93-95, 130, 133, 276, 278; ER (Vol. 3) at 339-\n                                                           \n29\n Moreover, Defendants had no  evidence that Plaintiff was using his ba nners to \nproselytize.   Defendant Chiment testifie d  on behalf of t he  School  District as \nfollows: \nQ:  Have you had any inform ation  of  any negati ve  connotations  or \ncomments about [Plaintiff’s] teaching ability? \nA: None. \nQ: How about anything from a personal perspective? \nA: None. \nQ: Anyone ever make any complaints that you’re aware of that  he \nwould proselytize students impermissibly? \nA: No. \n(R-54: Chiment Dep. at 25; ER (Vol. 3) at 333) (emphasis added). \n30\n Mr. Collins, testifying on behalf of the  School District, admitted that Plaintiff’s \nbanners  “were not part of the curriculu m,”  and  that “[t]he   banners have not  \nprevented  [Plaintiff]  from  providing  math  instruction and fulfilling his \nresponsibilities.”  (R-54: Collins Dep.  at 94, 125-26; ER (Vol. 3) at 308, 310;  see \nalso Chiment Dep. at 93; ER (Vol. 3) at 347) (concurring that the banners were not \npart of the math curriculum taught by Plaintiff). \n  16\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 26 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n40, 347-48, 351, 367-68; Kastner Dep. at 44-45, 85-86, 101-02, 137; ER (Vol. 3) at \n385-86, 390-92; Dep. Ex. 6; ER (Vol. 3) at 372).  The decision to order Plaintiff to \nremove his banners was approved by all Defendants, including the Superintendent \nand the School Board.  (See n.3, supra). \nHad Plaintiff not complied with Defendants’ order to rem ove his banners, \nPlaintiff  would have been subject to  some  form  of disciplinary action for \ninsubordination.  (R-44: Johnson Decl. at  ¶ 41; ER (Vol. 2) at 193; R-54: Collins \nDep. at 59; ER (Vol. 3) at 303). \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \n  The  undisputed facts of thi s  case compel the court t o  conduct a First \nAmendment forum analysis, similar to the analysis conducted by the district court.  \nAnd based on well-establishe d and controlling law,  Defendants’ viewpoint-based \nrestriction of Plaintiff’s speech violates his right to freedom of speech protected by \nthe United States and California Constitutions.  Indeed, should this court decide to  \nengage  in a balancing test, t hat  balance  also weighs in favor of protecting \nPlaintiff’s speech. \nBy granting the use of a forum to te achers whose personal, non-curri cular \nviews Defendants find acceptable, but denying use of this forum to Plaintiff based \non the viewpoint of his personal, non-curri cular speech, Defendants violated not  \n  17\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 27 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nonly  the First Amendm ent,  but the Equal  Protection  Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment as well. \nFinally,  by favoring certain religio us  and anti-religious speech and \ndisfavoring Plaintiff’s alleged “Judeo-Ch ristian” speech, Defendants violated the \nEstablishment Clause of the United States Constitution and the Establishment and \nNo Preference Clauses of the California Constitution. \nBecause Defendants violated clearly es tablished constitutional rights, they \ndo  not enjoy qualified immunity in thei r  individual  capacities.  Consequently, \nPlaintiff is entitled to nominal damages as well as declaratory and injunctive relief \nfor the violation of his constitutional rights. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Introduction. \n  Defendants’ entire argument is predicated upon a factual record that does not \n31\nexist.   Defendants acknowledged below that “there are no material issues of fact.”  \n(R-60: Defs.’ Reply to Pl.’s Opp’n to Mot. for Summ. J. at 1; ER (Vol. 4) at 693).   \nYet,  they proceed to advance argument s  before  this court that find no factual \nsupport.   Indeed, the undisputed facts,   which are based alm ost  entirely upon \nDefendants’ testimony, demonstrate the following: \n                                                           \n31\n The same can be said for the argumen ts advanced in the briefs filed by  Amici \nCuriae NSBA & CSBA and  Amicus Curiae Americans United for Separation of \nChurch and State. \n  18\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 28 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n  The School District intentionally created a forum for the personal,  \n32\nnon-curricular speech of its teachers;  \n  Plaintiff displayed his banners in this forum for over 25 years without \ncomplaint; \n  Plaintiff’s  banners are not part of the curriculum ;  the banners \n33\nconstitute  personal, non-curricular speech.    In fact, Defendants made the \nfollowing admission in their brief filed  in support of their m otion for summary \njudgment:  “The  [Tibetan  prayer]  flags, like Johnson’s banners ,  are  non-\n                                                           \n32\n  Defendants com plain  that “[t] he  District  Court’s ruling fails to analyze the \npurpose for which [all of the items in the record identified by Plaintiff as a result of \nthe court-ordered inspection] were displayed, e.g., whether a particular display was \na  student project or a teach er  decoration, and whether the classroom was for \nscience, history, or other subject.  The absence of that analysis was error.”  (Defs.’ \nBr. at 52).  However, the alleged failing, if  there is one, is not on the part of the \ndistrict court; rather, this alleged failing is on the part of Defendants, who provided \nno evidence to dispute Plaintiff’s claim that these items were displayed pursuant to \nthe  School District’s policy of perm itting  teachers  to display personal, non-\ncurricular items.  Indeed, a simple review of the record demonstrates that the items \nare personal and non-curricular in nature.  It is too late in the day for Defendants to \ncomplain about the record below. \n33\n  No doubt realizing that they cannot win this appeal based on the record, \nDefendants  make  the unsupported cl aim  that  “Johnson’s banners are both \ncurricular in nature and speech made pursuant to his du ties as a teacher.”  (Defs.’ \nBr. at 34).  However, the testimony provided on behalf of the School District flatly \ncontradicts Defendants’ claim.  (R-54: Chiment Dep. at 128-29; ER (Vol. 3) at 350 \n(describing Plaintiff’s banners as “non curricular and personal” speech ); Collins \nDep. at 94; ER (Vol. 3) at 308 (stati ng that the banners “were not part of t he \ncurriculum”)).   \n  19\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 29 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\ncurricular personal items in nature . . . .”  (Defs.’ P. & A. in Supp. of Mot. for \nSumm. J. at 19; ER (Vol. 3) at 438). \n  Plaintiff’s banners do not express  a message on behalf of the School  \nDistrict.  Consequently, Plaintiff’s spee ch is private speech and not governm ent \nspeech, similar to the other personal, non-curricular speech that the School District \npermits; \n  Permissible subject matter in the forum created by the School District \ninclude  messages related to the founda tions  of our Nation, patriotic messages , \ninspirational messages, historical messages, slogans that are praiseworthy of our \nNation,  and religious messages, am ong  others,  including me ssages  related to  \ncontroversial subject matter such as gay rights, global warming, and war/anti-war; \n  The  message conveyed by Plain tiff’s  banners falls within a \npermissible subject matter for the forum created by the School District; \n  Defendants’  restriction  on Pla intiff’s  speech was viewpoint-based; \nthat  is, Defendant s  restricted Plaintif f’s  speech because, according to them, \nPlaintiff’s patriotic banners conveyed a “Judeo-Christian” viewpoint; \n  Plaintiff’s  “Judeo-Christian” viewpoint was prohi bited,  while \nDefendants permitted speech expressing Buddhist and other religious messages, as \nwell as anti-religious messages. \n  20\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 30 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nIn  their brief, Defendants cite to a  School  District policy that allegedly \nprohibits teachers from “using classroom te acher influence to promote partisan or \nsectarian viewpoints.”  (Defs.’ Br. at 15).  Yet, Defendants have no objection when \nteachers blatantly use their “classroom teacher influence to promote” gay rights (in \nfact,  Defendants perm it  teachers  to activel y  engage in a protest wit h  students, \nduring the school day, and  on school property to promote such rights), global \nwarming, anti-religious sentiments, Buddhism, among other “partisan or sectarian” \nviewpoints.  This court, like the district  court, should be troubled by Defendants’ \nposition.  As the district court  appropriately noted, “Ironically, while t eachers in \nthe Poway Unified School Di strict encourage students to celebrate diversity and \nvalue  thinking for one’s se lf,  Defendants apparently fear their students are \nincapable of dealing with diverse viewpoints that include God’s place in American \nhistory and culture.”  (R-66: Op. at 5, n.1; ER (Vol. 1) at 5). \nBased on these undisputed facts and in light of the controlling case law, this \ncourt should affirm the decision below. \nII.  Defendants Violated Plaintiff’s Firs t Amendment Right to Freed om of \nSpeech. \n \nA.  Plaintiff’s Speech Is Protected by the First Amendment. \n \nThe undisputed facts establish that Defendants created a forum  for teachers \nto  engage in personal, non-curricular sp eech.   Defendants seek to avoid this  \ninconvenient  fact (and the controlling law)   so as to keep this forum   open for \n  21\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 31 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nfavored opinions and viewpoints, while retaining the power to censor viewpoint s \nthey dislike.  From  a legal (and educati onal) perspective, Defendants’ arguments \nare misguided. \nPlaintiff, a public school teacher, does not “shed [his] constitutional rights to \nfreedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”   Tinker v. Des Moines \nIndep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969) (“First Amendment rights . . . \nare available to teachers and students.”);  Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393, 403 \n(2007) (“In Tinker, this Court made clear that ‘First Amendment rights, applied in \nlight  of t he  special characteristics of  the  school environm ent,  are available to \nteachers and students.’”); Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators , 460 U.S. \n37,  44 (1983) (“The First Amend ment’s  guarantee  of free speech applies to \nteacher’s mailboxes as surely as it does elsewhere within the school . . . .”).  \nAnd  there can be no dispute that Plai ntiff’s  banners constitute protected \nspeech.  See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 715 (2000) (“[S]ign displays . . . are \nprotected by the First Amendment.”);  United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 176-\n77  (1983) (dem onstrating  with signs a nd  banners constitutes protected speech \nunder the First Amendment); Brown v. California Dep’t of Transp., 321 F.3d 1217 \n(9th Cir. 2003) (enj oining policy restricting the display of signs or banners on \nhighway overpass fences, a nonpublic forum, under the First Amendment).  \n  22\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 32 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nMoreover, Plaintiff’s banners, which were displayed without objection for \n25  years, did not di srupt  the classroom nor   materially  interfere  with the basic \neducational mission of the School Distric t.  See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513 (holding \nthat the “special characteristics of the sc hool environment” permit restrictions on \nspeech only so long as the speech “materially and substantially disrupt[s] the work \nand discipline of the school”); Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104 (1972) \n(same). \nFinally,  there can   be no dispute that  Plaintiff’s  constitutional rights are  \nimplicated by Defendants’ speech restriction.  See Perry Educ. Ass’n, 460 U.S. at \n44 (“There is no question that constitutiona l interests are im plicated by denying \n[appellee] use of the interschool m ail system.”); Keyishian v. Board of Regents , \n385 U.S. 589, 605-06 (1967) (“ [T]he theory that public  employment . . . may be \nsubjected to any conditi ons, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uni formly \nrejected.”).   \nIn sum, Plaintiff’s banners constitute  protected speech.  And Plaintiff has a \nFirst Amendment right to display his banners in the forum created by Defendants.  \n  B.  Defendants Created a Forum for Plaintiff’s Speech. \nThere  is no escapi ng  the fact that th is  is a forum analysis case—not a \nPickering balancing case—because Plaintiff is seeking to use government property \n(his  classroom  walls) for non-curricular ,  personal expression pursuant to a \n  23\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 33 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nlongstanding School District policy, practice, and/or custom of permitting teachers \nto use this forum  for such speech—a pr actice that the School District does not \n34\ndeny.    \nHowever, Defendants invite this court to eschew a forum analysis in favor of \na “balancing” test in which they have their fingers on the scale.  This court should \nreject Defendants’ invitation, which essentially strips Pl aintiff of his fundamental \nrights and undermines the values protected by the First Amendment. \nThe  U.S. Suprem e  Court “ha s  adopted a  forum  analysis  as a means   of \ndetermining when the Government’s interest in limiting the use of its property to \nits intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for \nother purposes.”  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. \n788, 800 (1985) (emphasis added);  see Flint v. Dennison , 488 F.3d 816, 828-30, \n                                                           \n34\n There are recognizable limits that the courts have upheld in a school setting.  For \nexample, the School District could prohibit speech that promotes illegal drug use, \nsee Morse, 551 U.S. at 408-09, or that “materially and substantially disrupt[s] the \nwork  and discipline of the school,”  Tinker,  393 U.S. at 513, such as speech \nprohibited  by an anti-harassment policy or   speech that i s  sexually suggestive, \nBethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser , 478 U.S. 675, 678 (1986).   Under Suprem e \nCourt precedent, the School District co uld also restrict speech that  “incite[s] to \nimminent lawless action,”  Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449 (1969), or \nspeech that constitutes “fighting words,”  Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. \n568, 572 (1941).  None of these limitations apply to Plaintiff’s patriotic expression.  \nMoreover, as noted previously, the School District could simply close the forum to \nall non-curricular speech.  Co nsequently, the suggestion that the distri ct court’s \ndecision requires the School District to surrender its classrooms and its curriculum \nto  the  teachers is hyperbolic nonsense.   See  generally  Br. of  Amici  NASB & \nCASB. \n  24\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 34 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nn.9 (9th Cir. 2007) (conducting a forum anal ysis in a case seeking review of a \npublic school speech restriction); Hills v. Scottsdale Unified Sch. Dist. No. 48, 329 \nF.3d 1044, 1048 (9th Cir. 2003) (“To anal yze his [First Amendment free speech] \nclaim,  we m ust  first consider what  type  of forum   the [School]   District has \ncreated.”).   \nConsequently, contrary to Defendants’ arguments, to determine the extent of \nPlaintiff’s free speech rights on School District property in light of the facts of this \ncase, the court must engage in a Fi rst Amendment forum analysis.  Arizona Life \nCoal.,  Inc. v. Stant on,  515 F.3d 956, 968 (9th Cir. 2008) (“The first step in \nassessing  a First Amendm ent  claim relating to private speech on governm ent \nproperty is to identify the nature of th e forum.”) (internal quotations omitted); see \nalso  Perry  Educ. Ass’n ,  460 U.S. at 44 (appl ying  a  forum  analysis in a cas e \ninvolving  a public school speech restri ction  and noting that “[t] he  First \nAmendment’s  guarantee of free speech a pplies  . . . within the school and on \nsidewalks outside”) (internal citation and punctuation omitted). \nDefendants cite to Berry v. Department of Soc. Serv., 447 F.3d 642 (9th Cir. \n2006), to argue that the  Pickering balancing test should apply to the facts of this \ncase.  (See Defs. Br. at 38-39).  Howev er, in Berry this Circuit applied a  forum \nanalysis to determine the constitutionality of  the government’s restriction on the \nuse of its facilities for the plaintiff’s speech (as opposed to the  Pickering balancing \n  25\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 35 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\ntest  the court   applied  to evaluate the  restriction  of plai ntiff’s  speech when \ncounseling clients of the department).   \nThus, it would be error to accept Defendants’ invitation to ignore controlling \nlaw, which compels a forum analysis under the facts of this case .  See Flint, 488 \nF.3d at 828-30, n.9 (noti ng that it is error to not  conduct a forum  analysis and \nfurther noting that the U.S. Supreme Court  has reinforced “the conclusion that we \nmust analyze [the public school speech restri ction at issue] within the confines of \ntraditional forum analysis”).   \nIn  Hazelwood  Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier ,  484 U.S. 260, 267 (1988), for \nexample,  the Court applied its forum   analysis  in the context of a public high \nschool.  The Court specifically noted that  school facilities—such as the classroom \nwalls  in this case—could be deemed  “public  forums”  for First Amendment \npurposes if school authorities “by policy or by practice” opened those facilities for \nuse “by some segment of the public, such  as student organizations”—or, as here, \nteachers.  Id.; see Perry Educ. Ass’n, 460 U.S. at 37 (applying a forum analysis to \ndetermine the constitutionality of a speech restri ction applied to the interschool \nmail system and teacher mailboxes in a public school district).   \n“Forum analysis has traditi onally divided government property int o three \ncategories: public fora,  designated public fora, and nonpublic fora.”   Flint, 488 \nF.3d  at 830 (citation om itted).   “Once the  forum  is identified, we determ ine \n  26\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 36 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nwhether restrictions on speech are justified by the requisite standard.”  Id.  “On one \nend of the fora spectrum  lies the traditio nal public forum, ‘places which by long \ntradition . . . have been devoted to assembly  and debate.’  Next on the spectrum  is \nthe  so-called designated public forum,  which  exists ‘[w]hen the governm ent \nintentionally dedicates its property to expressive conduct.’”  Id. (citations omitted).  \nAs  the U.S. Supreme Court stated, “ [A]  public forum   may be created by \ngovernment designation of a place or channel of co mmunication for use by the \npublic at large for assembly and speech,  for use by certain speakers , or for the  \ndiscussion of certain subjects.”  Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802 (emphasis added).  In a \ntraditional or designated public forum , restrictions on speech are subject to strict  \nscrutiny.  Flint, 488 F.3d at 830. \nIn Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981), for example, the Court held that \na state university, which made its facilities  generally available for the activities of \nregistered student groups (similar to this case, the  university’s facilities were not \nopen to the general public), may not close  its facilities to a student group based on \nthe content of the group’s speech.   Id. at 264-65, 267, n.5.  The Court stated, \n“Through its policy of accommodating their meetings, the University has created a \nforum generally open for use by st udent groups.  Having done so, the Universit y \nhas  assumed an obl igation  to  justify it s  discriminations  and exclusions under \napplicable constitutional norms . . . even if it was not required to create the forum \n  27\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 37 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nin the first place .”  Id. at 267-68 (em phasis added).  The Court consi dered the \nforum to be a designated public forum, applied strict scrutiny, and struck down the \nregulation.  Id. at 270 & 277.   \nIn this case, the Sch ool District created a forum generally open “for use by \ncertain  speakers,” thereby creating a fo rum  for the “non-curricular, personal” \nspeech of its teachers.  And because Def endants singled out Plaintiff’s expression \nfor  exclusion from   this forum   based  not  only  on its content   (which is \nimpermissible),  but its viewpoint (which is   fatal), this court should a ffirm  the \ndecision below. \n“At the opposite end of the fora sp ectrum is the nonpubl ic forum.  The \nnonpublic forum is ‘[a]ny public property that is not by tradition or designation a \nforum for public communication.’”  Flint, 488 F.3d at 830 (citations omitted).  In a \nnonpublic forum, government restrictions are subjected to less-exacting judicial  \nscrutiny.  There a government may restrict free speech if it acts reasonably and \ndoes not suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker’s \nview.  Id. (citations omitted). \nThis Circuit recognizes a “lim ited public forum” as a subcat egory of the \ndesignated public forum.  See id. at 830-31.  A “limited public forum” is “a type of \nnonpublic forum that the government has intentionally opened to certain groups or \nto certain topics.”  Id. at 831.  “Once a government has opened a limited forum, it \n  28\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 38 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n35\nmust  respect the lawful bou ndaries  it has itself set .”    Id .  at 831 (quoting \nRosenberger  v. Rect or  &  Visitors  of Univ. of Va. ,  515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995)) \n(internal quotations and punctuation omitted) (emphasis added).  Accordingly, in a \nlimited  public forum   “the [governm ent]  may not exclude speech   where its \ndistinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, nor may it \ndiscriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint.”   Flint, 488 F.3d at 829 \n(citations and quotations omitted). \nHere, the undisputed evidence shows that pursuant to a long-standing policy, \npractice,  and/or custom,  the School Distri ct  created, at a minim um,  a “limited \npublic forum” that is open for use by te achers, including Plaintiff, to express a \nvariety of messages, including personal, non-curricular messages.  Pursuant to this \npolicy, practice, and/or custom, teachers displayed and continue to display on their \nclassroom  walls messages that reflec t  the individual te acher’s  personality, \nopinions,  and values with regard to a wi de  range  of subject matter, including  \ncontroversial social and political concern s.  See generally New York Magazine v. \nMetropolitan Transp. Auth., 136 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 1998) (concluding that the \nadvertising space on the outside of buses  was a public forum  where the transit \n                                                           \n35\n Certainly, as noted previously, if Defen dants wanted to take the draconian step  \nof  removing  all personal expressive ite ms  from  the classroom wall s,  thereby \nclosing the forum to all personal, non-curricular speech, it could do so.  But once it \nhas created this forum, it cannot pick  and choose which messages are acceptable \nand which are not based on viewpoint.   \n  29\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 39 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nauthority permitted “political and other non-commercial  advertising generally”); \nUnited Food & Commercial Workers Union,  Local 1099 v. Southwest Ohio Reg’l \nTransit Auth., 163 F.3d 341, 355 (6t h Cir. 1998) (concluding that the advertising \nspace on a public bus system wa s a public forum and stating that “[a]cceptance of \npolitical  and public-issue advertisem ents,  which  by their very nature   generate \nconflict, signals a willingness on the part of the government to open the property to \ncontroversial  speech”);  Planned  Parenthood Ass’n/Chicago Area v. Chicago \nTransit Auth., 767 F.2d 1225 (7th Cir. 1985) (same).  Permissible subject matter in \nthis forum include patriotic messages, historical messages, inspirational messages, \nreligious messages, and messages regarding the foundations of our Nation, among \nothers (such as gay right s, global warming, and anti-war messages).  Pursuant  to \nthis policy, practice, and/or custom , teachers have discretion and control  over the \nmessages they wish to convey in this forum. \nThus, a forum analysis is the proper  approach to take based on the fa cts of \nthis case.  And based on this analysis, th e School District created, at a minimum, a \nlimited public forum for the personal, non-curricular speech of its teach ers.  Thus, \nDefendants’  viewpoint-based restrictio n  of Plaintiff’s speech cannot survive \nconstitutional scrutiny. \n \n \n  30\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 40 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nC.  Defendants’ Speech Restriction Violates the First Amendment. \n  1.  Defendants’ Speech Restriction Is Viewpoint-Based. \nViewpoint  discrimination  is prohi bited  in all   forums  because it is an \negregious form of content discrimination.  See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \nthe Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995)).  Pursuant  to controlling case law, if \ncertain speech “fall[s] w ithin an acceptable subject matter otherwise included i n \nthe forum, the State may not legitimatel y exclude it from the forum based on the \nviewpoint of the speaker.”  Cogswell v. City of Seattle, 347 F.3d 809, 815 (9th Cir. \n2003).  Viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government “denies access to a \nspeaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible \nsubject.”  Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806. \nBecause Defendants singled out Plain tiff’s speech based on his viewpoint, \nDefendants’  speech restriction cannot   survive constitutional  scrutiny.    See  also \nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 819; Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free Sch. \nDist., 508 U.S. 384 (1993);  Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch. , 533 U.S. 98, \n107-08 (2001); Faith Center Church Evangelis tic Ministries v. Glover , 480 F.3d \n891 (9th Cir. 2007);  Truth v. Kent Sch. Dist. , 524 F.3d 957,  973 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(observing that in a public high school  limited public forum “where restriction to \nthe forum is based solely on . . . religious viewpoint, the restriction is invalid”).  \n  31\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 41 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n  Indeed,  “[r]estrictions  on free  expression  in a   nonpublic  forum  are \nconstitutional only if the distinctions dr awn are (1) ‘reasonable in light of the \npurpose served by the forum ’ and (2) ‘viewpoint neutral.’”   Brown v. California \nDep’t of Transp., 321 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting  Cornelius, 473 \nU.S. at 806); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46 (stati ng that speech restrictions in a  nonpublic \nforum must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral)). \nAs  noted previously, Defendants’ sp eech  restriction fails the viewpoint \n36\nneutrality prong, and is thus unconstitutional for that reason alone.   Nonetheless, \nit also fails the “reasonableness” prong.  \n   2.  Defendants’ Speech Restriction Is Unreasonable. \nThe “reasonableness” prong “focuses on whether the limitation is consistent \nwith preserving the property for the purpose to which it is dedicated.”  Brown, 321 \nF.3d at 1222 (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Here, Plaintiff’s speech did \nnot disrupt school work, it di d not cause m aterial disorder or interference in the \nclassroom, and it did not interfere with his  math instruction or his responsibilities \nas a teacher.  Defendants’ order to rem ove the banners was not curriculum related.  \nPlaintiff’s banners were not displayed as part of his official duties as a teacher, nor \n                                                           \n36\n This Circuit has also “incorporated ‘viewpoint neutrality’ analysis into nonpublic \nforum, school-sponsored speech cases . . . .”   Downs v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. \nDist., 228 F.3d 1003, 1010 (9th Cir. 2000) (citing  Planned Parenthood v. Clark \nCounty Sch. Dist., 941 F.2d 817, 828 n. 19, 829-30 (9th Cir. 1991)).   \n  32\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 42 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nwere they part of his math cu rriculum, which he continues to teach today.  The \nbanners have never prevented Plaint iff from teaching his math curriculum, nor \nhave they limited him in any way in the teach ing of his classes.  In fact, Plaintiff \nwas and continues to be one of the highest  rated math teachers at Westview High  \nSchool.   \nDefendants cannot readily allow personal  posters of rock bands and sports \nteams, personal posters promoting a particular viewpoint on controversial political \nissues such as gay rights or gl obal warming, large (35’ to 40’) displays of sacred \nTibetan prayer flags, and a host of other displays and personal viewpoints, but then \nprohibit Plaintiff’s patriotic banners, whic h were displayed without objection for \n25 years, without running afoul of the First Amendment. \nIn sum, whether the classroom walls  are a “designated public forum,”  a \n“limited  public forum ,”  or a “nonpublic  forum”  it makes little difference.   \nDefendants’  viewpoint-based restriction  on  Plaintiff’s speech violates the First \nAmendment.   \nIII.  Pickering/Berry/Garcetti/Eng  Do No t  Justify De fendants’  Speech \nRestriction. \n \nDefendants improperly eschew any forum analysis in favor of applyi ng the \n“balancing test” set forth in  Pickering v. Board of  Educ., 391 U.S. 563 (1968),  \nBerry v. Department of Soc. Serv. , 447 F.3d 642 (9th Cir. 2006), and  Garcetti v. \n  33\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 43 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n37\nCeballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006).   Defendants also argue that the “five-part  Eng \ntest” set forth in Eng v. Cooley, 552 F.3d 1062, 1070 (9th Cir. 2009), which is little \nmore  than  the application of the  Pickering  balancing test in the context of a  \n38\nretaliation case, should apply.   Not only is this analysis error, as noted previously, \nbut these cases are inapplicable here because none  of them address a situation in \nwhich  the governm ent  opens a forum   for  certain  expressive activity, but then \nprohibits a speaker from expressing an appropriate message in the forum based on \nhis viewpoint, as in this case.   \nIndeed, this Circuit did not rely on the  Pickering balancing test to reach its \nconclusion in Downs v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. , 228 F.3d 1003, 1010 (9t h \nCir. 2000), a case invol ving teacher speech.  While distinguishable on its facts, \nDowns demonstrates the constitutional violation at issue here.  In Downs, the court \nupheld a school district’s restriction on a  teacher’s ability to change the viewpoint \nexpressed by the district on its “Gay and Lesbian Awareness” bulletin boards.  The \n                                                           \n37\n The Pickering test essentially seeks to balance  “the interests of the [employee], \nas a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interests of the \nState, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs \nthrough its employees.”  Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 140 (1983) (quoting \nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568). \n38\n If this court is inclined to apply the Pickering balancing test and consider various \nfactors in its analysis, the court should  follow the approach taken by the district \ncourt in its alternative analysis  of Plaintiff’s free speech cl aim under Pickering.  \nSee infra note 40; (R-66: Op. at 22; ER (Vol. 1)  at 22).  Consideration of the facts \nof this case under Pickering yields the same result: Defendants violated Plaintiff’s \nFirst Amendment right to freedom of speech. \n  34\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 44 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\ncourt concluded that the bulletin boards  in question were a  nonpublic forum and \nthat the speech in question was governme nt speech made pursuant to a specific \nschool district policy related to the “G ay and Lesbian Awareness Month.”  The \ncourt stated, “We do not face an exam ple of the government opening up a forum \nfor either unlimited or limited public discussion,” and explicitly found that “[t]he \nbulletin boards served as an expressive  vehicle for the school board’s policy of \n‘Educating  for Diversity.’”   Id.  at 1012.  Accordingl y,  the court he ld  that  the \nspeech was government speech; therefore, viewpoint neutrality did not apply.  Id.  \nHere, there is no dispute that the speech  at issue is Plaintiff’s personal, non-\ncurricular  speech, so viewpoint neutrality does   apply.  Indeed, at a mini mum, \nDowns compels this court to conduct a forum analysis.  And based on the fact that \nDefendants’ restriction was viewpoint based,  Downs compels the court to affirm \nthe decision below. \nSimilarly, as noted previously, Defendants’ reliance on Berry v. Department \nof Soc. Serv., 447 F.3d 642 (9th Cir. 2006), is misplaced.  Defendants improperly \ncriticize the district court for relying on forum analysis cases that they claim do not \ninvolve a public employer’s limitation on an employee’s speech.  However, Berry, \nwhich is an “emplo yee speech” case, di d use a forum anal ysis when deciding \nwhether  or not the em ployer’s  restriction  on the   use of its facilities for the \n  35\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 45 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n39\nemployee’s speech violated the First Amendment.   Id. at 652-54.  Because this \ncase  involves the restriction on Plaintif f’s  use of governm ent  facilities for his \npersonal, non-curricular speech, Berry confirms that a forum analysis is proper.   \nMoreover, in its latest  application of the  Pickering test, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt in Garcetti expressly stated that its analysis did not apply in a school setting.  \nGarcetti, 547 U.S. at 425. \n                                                           \n39\n The court applied t he Pickering balancing test “to the Department’s restriction \non Mr. Berry’s speech with cli ents.”  Berry, 447 F.3d at 652-54.  And with scant \nanalysis, the court upheld the restriction  on the plaintiff’s “Happy Birthday Jesus” \nsign and the display of his Bible in the  cubicle that he uses to counsel clients, \nclaiming “that the Departm ent’s restrictions on the display of religious item s are \nreasonable under the Pickering balancing test.”   Id. at 651.  Consequently, t he \ncourt  treated the displays as an extens ion  of the plaintiff’s speech with the \nDepartment’s clients.   \nUnlike the present case, in Berry there was no evidence or argument that the \ngovernment created a forum for the cubicle displays.  And the court considered the \nrestriction  to be one based on  subject  matter,  not viewpoint.  In this case, \nPlaintiff’s  speech was pe rsonal,  non-curricular speech .   His banners were \ndisplayed pursuant to a long-standing policy,  practice, and/or custom of allowing \nteachers to express personal, non-curricular messages on their classroom walls—a \nforum opened by Defendants f or this purpose.  The banners were not displayed \npursuant to any of his official duties as a  teacher.  He did not use them during any \nclassroom session or period of  instruction.  They were not disc ussed or studied in \nany of his classes.  They  caused no material disruption or disorder in the school.  \nThey did not interfere with the teaching of his classes.  They were not expressing a \nmessage  on behalf of the School Distri ct.   And Defendants’ restriction was \nviewpoint based.  Neither Pickering nor Berry apply to these facts.  Moreover, as  \nthe district court properly noted, “The po tential for an Establishment Clause issue \nwas greater there, than here, as the employee in  Berry, unlike Johnson, said he \nwould share his faith and pray with agency customers.”  (R-66: Op. at 23; ER (Vol. \n1) at 23). \n  36\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 46 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nIn Lee v. York County Sch. Divs. , 484 F.3d 687 (4th Cir. 2007), a case that \nDefendants claim is “most on point,” (Defs.’ Br. at 28), the Fourth Circuit refused \nto apply Garcetti and instead applied Pickering in light of circuit precedent.  Most \nimportant for purposes of this case is the f act that the Fourth Circuit noted that if \nthe teacher’s speech at issue was not curriculum related—that is, if the speech was \npersonal and non-curricular as in this case—then school officials could not restrict \nthe speech unless it “materially and substantially interfere[d] with the requirements \nof appropriate discipline in the  operation of the school.”   Lee, 484 F.3d at 694,  \nn.10 (quoting Tinker, 393 U.S. at 509).  Moreover, in  Lee, unlike in this case, th e \nrecord  did not   overwhelmingly  support  the  conclusion  that  the school di strict \ncreated a forum for the teach er’s speech and that the sc hool district’s restriction \nwas viewpoint based.  In sum, Lee is of little help to Defendants. \nNevertheless, even if this court  were to apply a  Pickering balancing test to \nthe facts of this case, Defendants’ speech  restriction would still violate the First \n40\nAmendment.   The only justification offered by Defe ndants for the restriction is \n                                                           \n40\n  In additi on  to conducting a   forum  analysis,  the district also conducted an \nanalysis under Pickering, properly concluding that  the balance tipped in favor of \nprotecting Plaintiff’s speech.  (R-66: Op. at 22; ER (Vol. 1) at 22).  In finding that \nthe balance weighed in favor of Plaintiff, the district court noted that (1) there is no \nevidence that Plaintiff’s working relations hip with the School Board or principal \ndeteriorated;  rather, the record shows th at  Plaintiff’s superiors were favorably \nimpressed  with the professi onal  manner  in  which Plaintiff responded to their \nconcerns; (2) the evidence cl early demonstrates that the banners had no effect on  \n  37\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 47 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nthat they believe the Establishment Clause requires it.  This claim does not survive \neven modest scrutiny.  As the  district court properly observed: “That God places \nprominently  in our Nation’s history does   not create an Establishment Cl ause \nviolation  requiring curettage and disi nfectant  for Johnson’s  public  high  school \nclassroom  walls.  It is a matter of hist orical  fact that o ur  institutions and \ngovernment actors have in past and present times given place to a supreme God.”   \n(R-66: Op. at 8; ER (Vol. 1) at 8). \nIndeed,  Defendants assert that the  Constitution  requires them   to ban \nPlaintiff’s personal patriotic speech, which Plaintiff expressed without com plaint \n41\nfor 25 years,  because of its viewpoint, while a science teacher’s Buddhist speech \n42\nis acceptable.   This assertion is untenable and shoul d be rejected.   See, e.g., \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nPlaintiff’s performance of his daily duties in the classroom; in fact, Plaintiff is held \nin high regard for his performance as a math teacher ; and (3) there is no evidence \nto suggest that Plaintiff’s banners negatively affected the regular operations of the \nschools  where Plaintiff taught; t o  the  contrary,  the undisput ed  evidence \ndemonstrates that the banners caused no i ssues for over two decades.  In sum, the \nbalance weighs heavily in favor of protecting Plaintiff’s speech.  (R-66: Op. at 22-\n23; ER (Vol. 1) at 22-23) (citi ng factors set forth i n Nicholson v.

California Dep’t \nof Educ., 97 F.3d 1204, 1212-13 (9th Cir. 1996 ) (rejecting Establishment Clause \n“defense”  for employee speech restricti on).   As discussed m ore  fully below,  \nDefendants’  speech  restriction, which di sfavors  “Judeo-Christian”  speech, but \nfavors Buddhist and anti-religion speech, violates the Establishment Clause. \nAt  the end of the day, Defendants ar e  not interested in balancing any \ninterests or closely analyzing t he significant First Amendment interests at stake.   \nThey simply—and incorrectly—label Plaintiff’s speech as “religious” and then \nerroneously conclude that the First Amendment (Free Speech Clause) not onl y \nallows their viewpoint restriction, but it (Establishment Clau se) requires it.   But \nsee Board of Educ. v. Mergens , 496 U.S. 226, 250 (1990) (O’Connor, J.) (noti ng \nthe “crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the \nEstablishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, which the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nused  to discuss “the acco mplishment  of  an amazing goal,” like reaching Mt. \nEverest’s summit.  (Defs.’ Br. at 54).  But  why is it that Plaintiff’s banners are not \nsimilarly  decorative?  And why is it th at  Plaintiff’s banners are incapable of \ninspiring people to be patriotic and to love their country?  Moreover, it is insulting \nthe way Defendants seek to mini mize the religious nature of the Tibetan prayer \nflags and the role religion played in  the lives and acco mplishments of Mahatma \nGhandi, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther Ki ng, while at the sam e time dismissing \nthe historic nature of Plaintiff’s banners.  (Defs. Br. at 53-55).  While Defendants \nmay not like the fact that our Nation was  founded by religious people, they can’t \nchange that fact by fiat. \n  39\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 49 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nFree Speech and Free Exer cise Clauses protect”).  But si mply claiming that the \nEstablishment Clause requires this speech restriction does not make it so.  Indeed, \nit is time for the courts to put an end to  this reflexive (and thinly veiled hostility \ntoward Christianity) response by government officials to anything that is remotely \nrelated to (the Christian)  religion.  Defendants’ reliance on this shopworn excuse \nto ban the display of Plaintiff’s well-known , historic patriotic phrases is patently \nincorrect.  See A.C.L.U. v. Mercer County,  432 F.3d 624, 638-39  (6th Cir. 2005) \n(“[T]he ACLU makes repeated reference to ‘the separati on of church and state.’   \nThis extra-constitutional construct has  grown tiresome.

As this Circuit stated in  Hills v. Scottsdale Unified Sch. Dist. \nNo. 48, 329 F.3d 1044, 1055 (9th Cir. 2003), “We agree with the Seventh Circuit  \nthat the desirable approach is not for sc hools to throw up their hands because of \nthe possible misconceptions about endorsement of religion, but that instead it is \n‘far  better to teach students a bout  the  First  Amendment,  about the difference \nbetween private and publ ic action, about w hy we tolerate divergent vi ews.

Wauconda Cmty. United Sch. Dist. No. 118, 9 F.3d \n1295, 1299 (7th Cir. 1993)) (internal punctuation omitted). \nIV.  Defendants’ Restriction Violates the Establishment Clause.   \nDefendants’  anemic  evaluation of Plai ntiff’s  Establishment  Clause clai m \ndemonstrates  a mis apprehension  of the  material  facts and relevant law; a \nmisapprehension  that evidently guided th eir  illicit decision to ban Plaintiff’s \nspeech in the first instance. \nIn  1952, the U.S. Supr eme  Court acknowledged the following hist orical \nreality:  “We are a religious people w hose  institutions presuppose   a Supreme \nBeing.”  Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313 (1952).  From  at least 1789, there \nhas been an unbroken history of official  acknowledgment by all three branches of \ngovernment  of reli gion’s  role  in American life.  Exam ples  of this historical \nacknowledgment  include Executive Orders   recognizing relig iously  grounded \nNational Holidays, such as Christm as and Thanksgiving, Congress directing the \nPresident to proclaim a National Day of Prayer each year, and the printing on our \ncurrency of the national motto, “In God We Trust.”  As the Court acknowledged in \nLynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 677-78 (1984): \nOne cannot look at even this brief  resume [of historical exam ples of \npublic religious expression] without finding that our history is pervaded \nby  expressions of religious beliefs.  .  . .  Equally pervasi ve  is the \nevidence  of acco mmodation  of all fait hs  and all forms of religious \nexpression, and hostility toward no ne.  Through this acco mmodation, \nas Justice Douglas observed, govern mental action has “foll ow[ed] the \n  41\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 51 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nbest  of our traditi ons”  and “respect [ed]  the religious   nature of our \npeople.”  (quoting Zorach, 343 U.S. at 314). \n \nRecognition  of t he  role of God in ou r  Nation’s hi story  and herit age  is \nconsistently  reflected in U.S. Supr eme  Court decisions.  The Court has \nacknowledged,  for exam ple,  that religion  has  been closely identified with our \nhistory and government, and that the history of man is inseparable from the history \nof  religion.   Exam ples  of patrioti c  invocations of God and offici al \nacknowledgments of religion’s role in ou r Nation’s history abound.  As Justice \nO’Connor observed, “It is unsurprising that a Nation founded by religious refugees \nand  dedicated to religious freedom   should  find  references to divi nity  in  its \nsymbols, songs, mottoes, and oaths.”  Elk Grove Unified Sch. Dist. v. Newdow, 542 \nU.S. 1, 35-36 (2004) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  \nEfforts to suppress this recognition a nd historical acknowledgment are the \nantithesis of the value of religious tolera nce that underlies the United States and  \nCalifornia  Constitutions.  And the classr oom  is peculiarly the “mar ketplace  of \nideas.”  As a result, the First  Amendment does not tolerate governmental policies, \npractices, and/or customs that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom, such as \nDefendants’ restriction, which prohibits Plaintiff from displaying his banners based \non the “particular sectarian viewpoint” conveyed by his patriotic speech.   \n \n \n  42\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 52 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nA.  Defendants’ Restriction Disfavors Religion. \nThroughout its decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently described \nthe Establishment Clause as forbidding not only state action motivated by a desir e \nto promote or “advance” religion,  see, e.g., County of A llegheny v. A.C.L.U., 492 \nU.S. 573, 592 (1989) , but also actions that tend to “disapprove” of, “i nhibit,” or \nevince “hostility” toward religion.   See Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U.S. 578, 585 \n(1987); Lynch, 465 U.S. at 673;  Committee for Pub. Educ. & Religious Li berty v. \nNyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 788 (1973).   \nAs the Court noted in Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968), “The \nFirst Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, \nand  between religio n  and nonreligion.”  Indeed, even  subtle  departures  from \nneutrality are prohibited.  See, e.g., Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City \nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993).  \nIn School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203 (1963), the \nCourt stated, “We agree of course that  the State may not establish a religion of \nsecularism in the sense of affirmativel y opposing or showing hostility to religion, \nthus preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.”  Id. at \n225 (internal quotations and citation om itted).  As Justice Breyer stated in his \nconcurrence  in  Van  Orden v. Perry ,  545 U.S. 677, 699 (2005), “[T]he \nEstablishment Clause does not com pel the government to purge from  the public \n  43\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 53 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nsphere all that in any way pa rtakes of the religious.  Such absolutism  is not only \ninconsistent with our national traditions, but would also tend to prom ote the kind \nof social conflict the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.”  See also Church of the \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc., 508 U.S. at 532 (“In our Esta blishment Clause cases we \nhave often stated the principle that the First Amendment forbids an official purpose \nto disapprove of a particular religion or of religion in general.”).   \nThus, a restriction t hat disfavors “religion in general”—or worse, one that \ndisfavors “a particular sectarian viewpoint,” such as the restriction at issue here—\nviolates the neutrality mandated by the Establishment Clause.   \nB.  Defendants’ Restriction Disfavors a Particular Religion. \nIn  addition to m andating  neutrality  toward  religion in ge neral,  the First \nAmendment  also forbids hostility aimed  at  a specific faith (Christianity), \nparticularly while favoring another (Buddhi sm).  “The cleares t command of the \nEstablishment  Clause is tha t  one reli gious  denomination  cannot be officially \npreferred over another.”  Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 244 (1982); s ee also \nCounty of Allegheny, 492 U.S. at 608-09 (requiri ng “‘strict scrutiny’ of practices \nsuggesting  ‘a denom inational  preference’”)  (emphasis  added);  Church  of the  \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc, 508 U.S. at 532 (“[The Establishment Clause] forbids an \nofficial purpose to disapprove  of a particular religion.”); Epperson, 393 U.S. at \n  44\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 54 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n103-04 (stating that the government “ may not be hostile to any religion”);  Lynch, \n465 U.S. at 673 (“[The Constitution] forbids hostility toward any” religion.).  \nRemarkably, even though Plaintiff’s sp eech expresses messages that have \nhistorical  significance  and contain no  religious  text,  Defendants censored the \nspeech  because they claimed   that th e  banners conveyed an im permissible \n“Christian” viewpoint (while permitting Buddhist prayer flags, no less).  Leaving \n43\naside the inaccuracy of that claim,  Defendants violated the Establishment Clause \nby singling out Plaintiff’s speech for disfavored treatment because they believed it \nconveyed “a particular sectarian viewpoint.”  \nC.  Defendants’ Restriction Violates Lemon and Its Modifications. \n \nDefendants’  speech restriction, which  disfavored  “a particular sectarian \nviewpoint,” violates the Establishment Clause as to its purpose and effect.  And it \ncreates an impermissible entanglement.   See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 \n(1971). \n1.  The Purpose and Effect of Defendants’ Restriction. \n“The purpose prong of the  Lemon test asks whether government’s actual \npurpose is to endorse or di sapprove of religion.  The effect prong asks whether,  \n                                                           \n43\n Plaintiff’s banners contain historical, patriotic phrases and slogans central to our \nNation’s history and herita ge; the banners do not cont ain passages from Sacred \nScripture or other religious texts.  See, e.g., Lynch, 465 U.S. at 677-78;  Elk Grove \nUnified Sch. Dist., 542 U.S. at 35-36 (O ’Connor, J., concurring); ( see also R-66: \nOp. at 8; ER (Vol. 1) at 8).   \n  45\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 55 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nirrespective  of gove rnment’s  actual purpose,   the practice under review in fact \nconveys a message of endorsement or disapproval.  An affirmative answer to either \nquestion should render the cha llenged practice invalid.”   See Lynch, 465 U.S. at \n690 (O’Connor J., concurring). \na.  Impermissible Purpose. \n“While the Court is normally deferential to a State’s articulation of a secular \npurpose, it is required that the statement  of such purpose be sincere and not a \nsham.”  Edwards, 482 U.S. at 586-87.  The secula r purpose requirement “reminds \ngovernment that when it acts it should  do so without endorsing [or disapprovi ng \nof] a particular religious belief or practice . . . .”   Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, \n75-76 (1985).  “The eyes that look to purpose belong to an objective observer, one \nwho  takes account of the tra ditional  external  signs that show up in the text, \nlegislative history, and im plementation of the statute or co mparable official act.”  \nMcCreary  County v. A.C.L.U. ,  545 U.S. 844, 862 (2005)   (internal quotations \nomitted). \nIn this case, Defendants’ stated purpos e for their official  act of rem oving \nPlaintiff’s  banners was to prohibit sp eech  that, in their view, conveyed a \n“particular sectarian viewpoint,” that being a “Christian” viewpoint.  This purpose \nis not compelled by the Establishment Clause; rather, it is prohibited by it. \n     \n  46\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 56 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nb.  Impermissible Effect. \nThe “effect” of Defendants’ restricti on, regardless of Defendants’ all eged \n“purpose” for enforcing it, conveys a messa ge of disapproval of religion (and the \nChristian  religion in particular) in vi olation  of the   Establishment Clause.   See \nLynch, 465 U.S. at 690 (O’Connor J., concurring) (“The effect prong asks whether, \nirrespective  of gove rnment’s  actual purpose,   the practice under review in fact \nconveys a message of endorsement or disapproval.”).  As the U.S. Supreme Court \nexplained,  when evaluating the e ffect  of governm ent  action under the \nEstablishment  Clause, courts must ascer tain  whether the challenged action is \n“sufficiently  likely to be perceived ”  as a disapproval of religion.   County  of \nAllegheny, 492 U.S. at 597 (citations  omitted) (emphasis added); Santa Fe Indep. \nSch. Dist. v. Do e, 530 U.S. 290, 307, n. 21 (2000) (“[T]he Establishment Clause \nforbids  a State to h ide  behind the app lication  of formally neutral criteria and \nremain studiously oblivious to the effects of  its actions.”).  The clear ef fect of the \nspeech  restriction is to show disappr oval  of religion in violation of the \nEstablishment Clause.  \n2.  Defendants’ Restriction Fosters an Excessive Entanglement. \nThe  third prong of the  Lemon  test asks whether the restriction at issue \nexcessively entangles government with religion.   Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13.  In \nWidmar  v. Vincent,  the  Court explained: “[T] he  University  would risk greater \n  47\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 57 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\n‘entanglement’ by attempting to enforce its exclusion of ‘re ligious worship’ and \n‘religious speech.’  Initially, the University  would need to determine which words \nand activities fall wi thin ‘religious worship and religious teaching.’  This alone \ncould prove an impossible task in an age where many and various beliefs meet the \nconstitutional definition of religion.”   Widmar,  454 U.S. at 272, n.11 (internal \nquotations and citations om itted).  Accordingly, Defendants’ attempt to exclude \nspeech expressing a “Christian” or “Judeo/Christian” viewpoint (while permitting \n“Buddhist”  speech)  creates  “excessive en tanglement”  in violation of the \nEstablishment Clause. \nV.  Defendants Violated the California Constitution. \n  A.  State Free Speech Claim. \n  Article 1, section 2 of the California Constitution generally provides broader \nprotection for the exercise of free speech rights than the First Amendment.  Robins \nv. Pruneyard Shopping Ctr. , 23 Cal. 3d 899 (1979).  Ho wever, federal law is \ntypically followed for free speech claims arising in a school setting.  See California \nTeachers Ass’n v. Governing Bd. of San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., 45 Cal. App. 4th \n1383,  1391 (1996) (“[W]e  find  the federal authori ties  which discuss First  \nAmendment  principles  in the fairly unique context of school regulation of \ncurricular  activities accurat ely  weigh th e  competing interests of school  \nadministrators, teachers and students.”).  Thus, for the reasons stated with regard to \n  48\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 58 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nPlaintiff’s  First Amend ment  claim,  Defendants  have sim ilarly  violated the \nCalifornia Constitution. \nB.  California  Establishment Clause and No Preference Clause \nViolations. \n \n    1.  California Establishment Clause. \n  California courts generally adopt the federal Establishment Clause analysis \nwhen considering cases under the California Constitution’s similar provision.  See \nPaulson v. Abdelnour, 145 Cal. App. 4th 400, 420 (2006) (“The construction given \nby California courts to the establishment clause of article I, section 4, is guided by \ndecisions  of the United States Supreme  Court.”).  Accordingly,  the previous \nanalysis under the federal Establishment Clause demonstrates why Defendants also \nviolated the California Constitution. \n   2.  California No Preference Clause. \n  This Circuit has interpreted the Calif ornia No Preference Cl ause “to stand \nfor the proposition that not only m ay a government body not prefer one religi on \nover another, it may not  appear to be acting preferentially.”   Ellis v. City of La \nMesa, 990 F.2d 1518, 1524 (9th Cir. 1993) (cita tion and quotations omitted).  In \nthis case, it is evident that Defendants’ restriction, which singled out “Christian” or \n“Judeo/Christian”  speech for disfavor ed  treatment  while permitting speech \nconveying  other religious  views,  including anti-religious views, violates \nCalifornia’s No Preference Clause. \n  49\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 59 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nVI.  Defendants’  Viewpoint Restriction Violates the Equal Protection \nClause. \n \nThe relevant principle of law was articu lated in Police Dept. of the City of \nChicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972).   In Mosley, the Court struck down a city  \nordinance that prohibited all picketing within 150 feet of a school, except peaceful  \npicketing of any school involved in a labor dispute.  The Court stated, “[U]nder the \nEqual Protection Clause, not to m ention the First Amendment itself, government \nmay not grant the use of a forum to pe ople whose views it finds accep table, but \ndeny use to those wishing to express less favored or more controversial views.”  Id. \nat 96; see also Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461-62 (1980).  Here, Defendants \nopened a forum for teacher  expression.  Having maintained this forum  for many \ndecades, Defendants violated Plaintiff’s  rights when they  prohibited his speech \nbased on the viewpoint of his message, while permitting other teachers to continue \ntheir speech in the same forum unfettered.   \nVII.  The Individual Defendants Do Not Enjoy Qualified Immunity. \nAs an initial matter, qualified immunity does not protect a defendant against \nclaims for declaratory and injunctive relief.   County of Sacramento v. Lewis , 523 \nU.S. 833, 841, n.5 (1998) (not ing that qualified immunity is unavailable “in a suit  \nto enjoin future conduct [or]  in an action against a m unicipality”); Presbyterian \nChurch (U.S.A.) v. United States , 870 F.2d 518, 527 (9th Ci r. 1989) (“Qualified \nimmunity . . . does not bar actions for declaratory or injunctive relief.”).   \n  50\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 60 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nNonetheless, “[w]hen government officials abuse their offices, ‘action[s] for \ndamages  may offer the only realistic av enue  for vindication of constitutional \nguarantees.’”  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 638 (1987) (citation omitted). \nIn  Harlow  v. Fitzgerald ,  457 U.S. 800 (1982), the Court held that \ngovernment officials are protected from personal liability for civil damages only so \nlong  as t heir  conduct does not viol ate  “‘clearly  established’ statutory or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Id. at 818.  \n“This is not to say that an official ac tion is protected by qualified immunity unless \nthe very action in question has been previous ly held unlawful, but it is to say that \nin light of pre-existing law the unl awfulness must be apparent.”   Anderson, 483 \nU.S. at 640 (citation omitted); Osolinski v. Kane, 92 F.3d 934, 936 (9th Cir. 1996) \n(“Absent binding precedent, we look to a ll available decisional law, including the  \nlaw of other circuits and district courts, to determine whether the right was clearly \nestablished.  We also evaluate the likelihood that this circuit or the Supreme Court  \nwould have reached the same result.”);  see also Mendoza v. Block, 27 F.3d 1357, \n1361 (9th Cir. 1994) (“[W]hen ‘the defendants’ conduct is so patently violative of \nthe  constitutional  right  that reasonable  officials  would know without gui dance \nfrom  the courts’ t hat  the action was  unconstitutional,  closely analogous pre-\nexisting case law is not requi red to show  that the law is clearly established.”) \n(citation omitted). \n  51\n\nCase: 10-55445   08/30/2010   Page: 61 of 65    ID: 7457007   DktEntry: 14-1\nIn  their brief, Defendants m ake  the  truly  remarkable  claim  that “[m]ost \npeople familiar with the cases would reas onably conclude that Johnson’s banners \nwere improper advocacy of a religion, a nd impermissible in the classroom during \nclass.”  (Defs.’ Br. at 60).  Yet, the ir refutable evidence shows that for 25 years  \nPlaintiff displayed his banners without  a single complaint.  And during these 25 \nyears,  7 different school   principals,  numerous  school board mem bers, \nsuperintendents,  assistant superinte ndents,  over 4,000 st udents  and several \nthousand parents have been in his classrooms where the banners were displayed.   \nIndeed, Defendants’ arguments are duplicitous.  On one hand they claim that \nPlaintiff’s banners were so large and the display of the words “God” and “Creator” \nwere so prominent that “no student with normal vision seated at any desk in that \nclassroom would fail to read the text of Johnson’s banners from their seat.”  (Defs. \nBr. at 53).  And on the other hand, Defe ndants claim that the banners were so \ndiscrete that their existence was not brought to the attention of Plaintiff’s principal, \nDefendant Kastner, until the fall of 200 6—25 years after they had been posted—\nwhen  Defendant Kastner a llegedly  “wondered what they   were talking about.”   \n(Defs.’ Br. at 9; see also Defs.

Indeed, these prayer flags, as \nwell as the numerous other documented ite ms expressing “partisan or sectarian \nviewpoints,” were still on display as late  as April 2009, whe n Plaintiff conducted \nhis court-ordered inspection of the district’s high school classrooms.   \nIn  sum,  Plaintiff’s right to engage   in his spe ech  free from   viewpoint \ndiscrimination  was clearly established.   Similarly,  it was clearly established in \nJanuary 2007, that t he government may not prefer one  religion over another (or \nanti-religion  over religion) without r unning  afoul of t he  United States and \nCalifornia Constitutions.  Consequently,  the individual defendants do not enjoy \nqualified immunity, and Plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages as a matter of law.  \nSee Carey v.

The  Main  Cases  Cited  By  Johnson  Are  Not  On  Point. \nThe  cases  that  Johnson  cites  to  argue  that  his  speech  was  protected  (Tinker, \nMorse,  Perry,  Hill,  Grace,  Brown,  Grayned,  Keyishian)'  are  not  cases  involving \nteacher-speech,  and  most  of them  are  not  even  public  employee  cases.  Appellee’s \nBrief,  pp.  22-23.  And  Johnson  does  not  even  cite  to  the  primary  Ninth  Circuit  case \naddressing the  issue  at bar — a public-school-teacher speaking  in class  about religion \n—  which  is  Peloza  vy.  Capistrano  Unified  School  District,  37  F.3d  517  (1994).’ \nMoreover,  all  of the  cases  that  Johnson  cites  for  authority  that  the  classroom \nis  a  public  forum  do  not  involve  a  public-school  teachers  speaking.  See  Appellee’s \nBrief,  pp.  23-30,  citing  Pickering,  Cornelius,  Flint,  Morse,  Bethel,  Brandenburg, \n  \n'  Tinker  vy.

Instead, \nJohnson  spends  his  efforts  dancing  around  this  critical  case,  which  is  not  only \ndiscussed  at  length  by  Appellants,  but  also  cited  by  amicus  counsel  in  Johnson’s \nsupport,  the  ACLU,  for  the  proposition  a  school  may  regulate  a  teacher’s  speech  to \nprevent  violations  of the  Establishment  Clause.  (See  amicus  curiae  brief of ACLU, \np.  15.) \n_|-\nCase:  10-55445  09/27/2010  Page:  11  of  39  ID:  7488730  DktEntry:  23-1 \nHills,  Arizona  Life,  Berry,  Perry,  Hazelwood,  Widmar,  Rosenberger,  New  York \nMagazine,  Planned Parenthood,  United Food.’  This  approach  ignores  the  holding \nin Peloza, which held that the  concern  over an  establishment clause violation justifies \na  school’s  limitation  on  a  teacher’s  speech.  If Peloza  is  followed,  a  classroom  is  not \na  public  forum.  No  appellate  case  has  yet  held  that  public  school  classroom  is  a \nlimited  public  forum. \nSimilarly,  the  majority  of the  cases  he  relies  upon  to  make  the  argument  that \nthe  restriction  is  viewpoint-based  (see  Appellee’s  Brief,  pp.  31-33,  citing, \nRosenberger,  Cogswell,  Lamb’s  Chapel,  Good  News,  Faith  Center,  Truth,  Brown, \nCornelius, Perry)’  do not  involve public-school teachers  speaking in  school.

Appellee’s  Brief,  p.  32,  fn.  36. \nFinally,  yet  again,  almost  none  of the  government-speech  cases  Johnson  relies \nupon  involved  a  public-school  teacher’s  classroom  speech.

Div.,  484  F.3d  687  (4th  Cir. \n2007)  (see  Appellee’s  Brief,  p.  37).  With  respect  to  Lee,  he  claims  the  case  did  not \ninvolve  speech that was  “personal  and non-curricular.”  In  fact,  the  speech  in Lee was \nno  less  “personal  and  non-curricular”  than  Johnson’s.  The  speech  in  Lee  was \nunrelated  to  the  teacher’s  subject,  and  the  teacher  did  not  refer  to  it  in  his  teaching. \n  \n384  (1993);  Good News  Club  v.  Milford Cent.

No. \n118,  9  F.3d  1295  (7th  Cir.  1993). \n-3-\nThe  court  concluded  that  the  speech  was  nonetheless  subject  to  restriction.  This \nunderstanding  of what  a  school  district  can  regulate  -  1.e.,  teacher’s  speech  designed \nto  impart  messages  to  students  -  was  endorsed  by  the  Ninth  Circuit  in Downs,  where \nthe  speech  was  likewise  unrelated  to  the  teacher’s  subject. \nIf  Johnson’s  banners  must  be  permitted,  so  must  banners  that  say  things \ncontrary  to  the  policies  of the  school  district  and  the  community.  The  School  would \nnot  be  permitted  to  remove  a  banner  proclaiming  the  validity  of Osama  Bin  Laden’s \njihad  against  the  West.  Ifa  standard  forum  analysis  applies  here,  as  Johnson  urges, \nthen  offensive  displays  would  necessarily  be  permitted  because  the  law  is  well \nestablished:  mere  “offense”  is  not  a  valid  basis  to  exclude  something  from  a  limited \npublic  forum.  “If there  is  a  bedrock  principle  underlying  the  First  Amendment,  it  is \nthat  the  Government  may  not  prohibit  the  expression  of  an  idea  simply  because \nsociety  finds  the  idea  itself offensive  or  disagreeable.”  Texas  v.  Johnson,  491  U.S. \n397,  414  (1989). \nB.  The Forum Test Applies to  “Protected”  Speech, But Under Eng, Johnson’s \nSpeech  is  Not  “Protected,”  So  the  Forum  Analysis  Is  Not  Appropriate. \nJohnson’s  legal  analysis  of his  First  Amendment  claim  begins  and  ends  with \na  forum  analysis.  To  try  to  gain  traction  with  his  analysis,  Johnson  repeatedly  cites \nto  this  Circuit’s  decision  in  Flint  v.  Dennison,  488  F.3d  816,  828-30  (9th  Cir.  2007) \n_4-\nCase:  10-55445  09/27/2010  Page:  14  0f39  ID:  7488730  DktEntry:  23-1 \nas  the  paradigm  of how  this  case  should be  decided.  But  Johnson  completely  misses \nthe  pre-requisite  determination  necessary to  reach  a  forum  analysis:  the  speech  must \nbe  speech  “protected”  by  the  First  Amendment. \nThe  Flint  court,  for  example,  first  made  the  determination  that  a  public \ncollege’s  restrictions  on  the  campaign  expenditures  of students  running  for  a  student \ngovernment  office  constituted  protected  speech.  Flint,  488  F.3d  at  829.  It  was  only \nafter that  determination  had been made  that the F/int court turned to  discussion  of the \nvarious  fora  and  whether  they  applied. \nSpecifically,  Flint began  its  forum  analysis  by  stating  “[a]lthough  the  student \ncampaign  expenditures  constitute  speech protected by the  First  Amendment,  “[e]ven \n  \nprotected  speech  is  not  equally  permissible  in  all  places  and  at  all  times.’”  Jd.  at \n829-830,  emphasis  added,  quoting  Cornelius,  supra,  473  U.S.  at  799. \nJohnson’s  argument merely assumes that his  speech is  “protected speech,” with \nno  analysis  other  than  in  a  vacuum.  Johnson  ignores  an  entire  body  of law  designed \nto  answer  the  question  of whether  a  public  employee’s  speech  is  “protected”  in  the \nemployment  context.  That  body  of law  begins  with  Pickering  and  was  distilled  by \nthe  Ninth  Circuit  in  Eng  to  a  series  of factors,  the  first  two  of which  are  designed  to \nmake  the  determination  of whether  the  public  employee’s  speech  is  “protected”  for \nFirst Amendment purposes.  Eng v.  Cooley,  552  F.3d  1062,  1070  (9th  Cir.  2009).  The \n5-\nfirst  two  factors  are  (1)  whether  the  plaintiff  spoke  on  a  matter  of public  concern; \n(2)  whether  the  plaintiff  spoke  as  a  private  citizen  or  public  employee.  /d.  If  the \nspeech  is  determined  to  be  protected  after  evaluating  those  two  prongs,  then  in \nretaliation  cases,  the  court  goes  on  to  determine  in  the  third  factor  “whether  the \nplaintiff's  protected  speech  was  a  substantial  or  motivating  factor  in  the  adverse \nemployment  action.”  J/d.,  emphasis  added.  Without  using  the  first  two  factors  to \ndetermine  whether  the  speech  is  “protected,”  the  third  prong  would  lack  its  bite. \nJohnson’s  attempt  to  find  support  for  a  forum  analysis  in  Hazelwood,  supra, \n484  U.S.  260,  does  not  help  him  for  several  reasons:  (1)  Hazelwood  dealt  with \nstudent  speech  protected  by  the  First  Amendment;  (2)  it  further  dealt  with  “school \nsponsored”  speech  and  (3)  the  Hazelwood  court  permitted  schools  to  restrict  the \nspeech  where  the  speech  interferes  with  the  mission  of the  school. \nIn Hazelwood,  a  principal  removed —  before  publication — articles  in  a  high \nschool  student  newspaper  addressing  students’  experiences  with  pregnancy  and  the \nimpact  of divorce  on  students  at  the  school.  Addressing  the  constitutionality  of this \naction,  as  it  had  done  previously,  the  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  the  competing \ninterests  of educational  authority  and  student  speech  rights,  but  emphasized  that  “[a] \nschool  need  not  tolerate  student  speech  that  is  inconsistent  with  its  basic  educational \nmission.”  /d.  at  266  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks  omitted). \n_6-\nUnder  the  Ninth  Circuit’s  interpretation  of  Hazelwood,  schools  may  limit \nspeech  that bears  the  imprimatur  of the  school  when  the  speech  may place  the  school \non  one  side  of a  controversial  issue:  “A  school’s  decision  not  to  promote  or  sponsor \nspeech  that  is  unsuitable  for  immature  audiences,  or which  might place  it  on  one  side \nof a controversial  issue,  is  a judgment  call which Hazelwood reposes  in the  discretion \nof  school  officials  and  which  is  afforded  substantial  deference.  We  therefore \nconclude  that  controlling  the  content  of  school-sponsored  publications  so  as  to \nmaintain  the  appearance  of neutrality  on  a  controversial  issue  is  within  the  reserved \nmission  of the  []  District.”  Planned Parenthood v.  Clark County School District,  941 \nF.2d  817,  829  (9th  Cir.  1991)  (en banc),  internal  footnote  omitted.  The  School  meets \nthis  test. \nFirst,  there  can  be  little  debate  that  the  banners  in  Johnson’s  classroom  might \nbe  seen  to  bear the  imprimatur  of the  school.  Students  have  been  in plain  view  of the \nbanners  as  a  captive  audience  for  25  years.  The  fact  that  the  banners  were  hung \ninside  the  classroom leaves  no  doubt that  others  might view them as  having  the  stamp \nof school  approval,  even  if the  speech is  Johnson’s  speech.  Johnson  argues,  however, \nthat he  did not use  the banners  in his  classroom teachings.  The  School  does  not know \nwhat  that  means.  Certainly  when  a 7  foot  by  2  foot  banner  is  hanging  in  direct  sight \nof a  captive  audience  of students,  an  idea  is  being  imparted,  and  this  communication \n_7-\nfalls  within  the  purview  of Poway  Board  Policy  3.11.  And  if speech  falls  within  the \npurview  of  a  particular  policy,  then  the  public  may  assume  that  the  School  made  a \ndecision  with  respect  to  the  speech  under  that  policy. \nSecond,  there  is  a  legitimate  pedagogical  reason  for the  banners’  removal:  the \nSchool  is  ensuring  that  as  an  entity,  it maintains  its  neutrality  on  a  controversial  issue \nand  does  not  run  afoul  of the  Establishment  Clause. \nNevertheless,  Johnson  argues  that  any  viewpoint-based  restriction  is \nunconstitutional.  See  Appellee’s  Brief,  p.  31-33.  But  Johnson’s  arguments \nconcerning  “viewpoint  neutrality”  turn  the  notion  of  neutrality  on  its  ear.  Under \nPlaintiff's  arguments,  schools  would  have  no  right  whatsoever  to  limit  a  viewpoint \non  a  particular  subject  matter,  even  if the  viewpoint  subjected  students  to  ideas  of \nhatred  and racism.  If Plaintiff were  correct,  then  a  teacher  could hang  a banner  in  his \nor  her  classroom  reading  “Hitler  had  the  right  idea,”  or  “Blacks,  go  back  to  Africa” \nand the  school  could do nothing  to  stop  that viewpoint except to  completely eliminate \nthe  hanging  of  all  banners  by  all  teachers.  But  that  is  what  Plaintiff's  reading  of \nHazelwood  suggests.  Defendants  submit  that  Plaintiff's  narrow  interpretation  is  not \nin  keeping  with  the  Hazelwood  court’s  declaration  that  a  school  may  “disassociate \nitself...  from speech that is,  for example, ungrammatical, poorly written,  inadequately \nresearched,  biased  or  prejudiced,  vulgar  or  profane,  or  unsuitable  for  immature \n_8-\naudiences.”  Hazelwood,  484  U.S.  at  271.  And  the  Supreme  Court  recently  set  a \nprecedent  permitting  school  authorities  to  limit  a  particular  viewpoint.  Morse  v. \nFrederick,  551  U.S.  393  (2007)  [holding  that  a  school  may  limit  student  speech \nadvocating  illegal  drug  use].  So  even  “viewpoint  neutrality”  is  not  so  absolute  as \nJohnson  would  have  this  Court  believe. \nStill,  Johnson  suggests  that  it  is  unfair  to  him that  other  issues  be  permitted by \nthe  school  district  to  be  on  display,  such  as  gay  rights  issues,  for  example.  Johnson \ndoes  not  go  into  detail  in  his  arguments  as  to  what  aspect  of tolerance  of civil  rights \ninvades  his  constitutional  rights  as  a  teacher.  But  to  clarify,  the  School  has  an \n“affirmative  obligation”  under  the  California  Education  Code  “to  combat  racism, \nsexism,  and  other  forms  of  bias”  including  sexual  orientation.  Cal.  Educ.  Code, \n§  201,  subd.  (b)  and  §  220.  “An  arm  of local  government  such  as  a  school  board may \ndecide  not  only  to  talk  about  gay  and  lesbian  awareness  and tolerance  in  general,  but \nalso  to  advocate  such tolerance  if it  so  decides,  and restrict the  contrary  speech  of one \nof  its  representatives.”  Downs,  supra,  228  F.3d  1003  at  1014.  So  Johnson’s \nargument  begs  the  question  as  to  how  tolerance  material  concerning  sexual \norientation  posted  in  a  classroom  is  violative  of his  First  Amendment  rights.\nC.  Even  if  The  Forum  Test  Were  to  Apply,  The  School  May  Use  the \nEstablishment  Clause  as  a  Defense. \nEven  if this  Court  were  to  find  that  Johnson  is  correct  that  the  Eng  factors  and \nbalancing  test  does  not  apply,  and  that  Johnson’s  classroom  was  a  limited  public \nforum  under  the  Hazelwood  analysis,  the  School  would  still  be  within  its  rights  to \nremove  the  banners.  The  School  may  use  the  Establishment  Clause  as  a  defense  in \na  forum  analysis.  Under  that  legal  analysis,  the  School  Defendants  may  prevail  if \nthey  show  that  the  banners  constitute  an  Establishment  Clause  violation.  This  is \nbecause  avoiding  endorsement  of religion  is  a  constitutional  mandate  and  therefore \na  compelling  interest.  Good News  Club  v.  Milford  Cent.  Sch.,  533  U.S.  98,  112-13 \n(2001)  (citing  Widmar  v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271  (1981)). \nIn  the  public-schools  context,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  held  that  schools  may \nrefuse  to  allow  religious  speech  in  a  limited  public  forum  where  it  is  necessary  to \navoid an Establishment Clause violation.  Cole v.  Oroville  Union High  Sch.  Dist.,  228 \nF.3d  1092  (9th  Cir.  2000).  In  Cole,  two  students  sued  their  school  district,  claiming \nthat  the  district  violated  their  freedom  of  speech  by  refusing  to  allow  one  to  give  a \nsectarian, proselytizing valedictory speech and the  other to give  a sectarian invocation \nat  their  graduation.  Cole,  228  F.3d  at  1095.  The  court,  in  deciding  whether  the \nindividual  school  officials  enjoyed  qualified  immunity,  found  that  the  students’ \n-10-\noe w  oy nA ono ten,  oO  an  dll  let \ndamage  claims  failed  because  the  officials’  actions  were  reasonably  taken  to  avoid \nviolating  the  Establishment  Clause  of the  First  Amendment.  /d.  In  supporting  its \ndecision  in  favor  of the  school  officials,  the  Cole  court  explained:  “We  conclude  the \nDistrict  officials  did not  violate  the  students’  freedom  of speech.  Even  assuming  the \nOroville  graduation  ceremony  was  a  public  or  limited  public  forum,  the  District’s \nrefusal  to  allow  the  students  to  deliver  a  sectarian  speech  or  prayer  as  part  of  the \ngraduation  was  necessary  to  avoid  violating  the  Establishment  Clause  under  the \nprinciples  applied  in Santa Fe Independent  School  District v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  120 \nS.Ct.  2266,  147  L.Ed.2d  295  (2000),  and  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  577,  112  S.Ct. \n2649,  120  L.Ed.2d  467  (1992).  [Citations.]”  Cole,  228  F.3d  at  1101. \nIn  cases  decided  after  Cole,  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  continued  to  endorse  the \nconcept  that  the  government  can  distinguish  and  exclude  proselytizing  religious \nspeech  to  preserve  the  purpose  for  a  limited  forum.  See,  e.g.,  Prince  v.  Jacoby,  303 \nF.3d  1074,  1086-87  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (finding  that  while  student  religious  group  must \nbe  given  equal  access  to  school’s  public  address  system to  announce  its  activities,  the \ngroup  may  be  barred  from  doing  so  to  “pray  and  proselytize’’);  and  Lassonde  vy. \nPleasanton  Unified  Sch.  Dist.,  320  F.3d  979,  980  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (prohibiting \nproselytizing  in  high  school  graduation  speech). \n-1]-\nIn  short,  should  this  Court  find  that  Johnson’s  speech  is  protected  under  the \nFirst  Amendment,  then  the  Court  should  still  find  that  the  School’s  right  to  protect \nitself from  an  Establishment  Clause  violation  outweigh’s  Johnson’s  right  to  display \nthe  banners. \nD.  The  School  Has  Not  Taken  Inconsistent  Positions  On  What  Constitutes \n“Curricular”  Speech;  The  Legal  Sense  of the  Term  “Curricular”  is  Far \nBroader  Than  the  Term’s  Vernacular  Use  by  School  Administrators. \nJohnson points  out that the  School  appears  to have taken  inconsistent positions \nwith  respect  to  what  matters  are  “curricular”  in  nature.  Appellee’s  Brief,  p.  16.  To \nthat  end,  Johnson points  to  the  deposition testimony  of School  administrators  Collins \nand  Chiment,  who  both  stated  in  their  depositions  that  the  banners  were  not  part  of \nthe  curriculum.  Appellee’s  Brief,  p.  16,  fn.  30. \nBut  a  review  of that  testimony  indicates  that when  the  School’s  administrators \nwere  talking  about  Johnson’s  banners  not  pertaining  to  the  curriculum,  they  meant \nthat  the  banners  have  nothing  to  do  with  “mathematics,”  the  course  of  study  taught \nby  Johnson.  Surely,  no  one  would  question  that  the  phrases  on  the  banners  are  not \nmathematical. \nBut  there  is  a larger meaning  to  the  word  “curriculum”,  that  is  used  in  the  legal \nsense.  That  is,  any  information  imparted  to  the  student  from  the  teacher  is \n_12-\n“curricular”  in  nature.  Lee,  supra,  484  F.3d  687,  694.  Johnson  says  that  he  is  trying \nto  teach  students  about  the  role  of  religion  in  our  nation’s  history.  (3  ER  497, \ndeposition  pg.  103.)  So,  although  not  part  of his formal  math  curriculum,  it  is  still \npart  of the broader curriculum taught to  students  during  the  school  day.  Accordingly, \nJohnson’s banners  are  speech which  is  not  of public  concern under Lee,  and therefore \nare  not  afforded  First  Amendment  protections. \nE.  Johnson  Failed  to  Demonstrate  an  Establishment  Clause  Violation. \nBoth  Johnson  and the  ACLU  contend that  the  string  of flags  in  Lori  Brickley’s \nclassroom  are  religious.  What  both  Johnson  and  the  ACLU  ignore,  however,  is  that \nthe  flags  do  not  advocate  for  a  particular  religion. \nSpecifically,  the  appellate  record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  that  the  flags \nreferred  to  as  “Tibetan  prayer  flags”  had  any  religious  message.  Looking  at  the \npictures  of  the  flags  is  not  sufficient  to  identify  any  religious  reference.  2  ER \n203,204.  One  flag  depicts  what  appears  to  be  the  seated  Buddha.  2  ER  205.  The \nflags  are  “[a]bout  a  foot  by  a  foot.”  (3  ER  405:87:17-18.)  So  the  depicted  Buddha \nis  about one  inch high,  surrounded by  Sanskrit text  and other indecipherable pictures. \nThis  is  not  comparable  in  context  to  the  seven  foot  long  banners. \nThe  teacher  who  put  up  the  flags  said  she  guessed  that  the  figure  was  the \nBuddha  but  she  was  not  sure.  3  ER  405:88:11-12.  There  is  no  testimony  the  flags \n_13-\nwere  religious.  The  teacher  testified  that  she  asked  her  students,  who  included \nspeakers  of many  languages,  what  the  flags  say,  but  none  of her  students  could  tell \nher.  3  ER  405:88:22  -  406:89:2.  She  used  the  flags  in  her  science  curriculum  to \ndiscuss  climbing  Mount  Everest,  placing  the  flags  on  the  mountain,  and  the  fossils \nthat  were  found  there,  as  part  of a  discussion  of “the  accomplishment  of an  amazing \ngoal.”  3  ER  406:89:20-22  [“In  the  context  I  just  told  you.”];  405:87:20  - \n406:89:13[the  context].  The  amicus  brief by  the  ACLU  denigrates  her  purpose,  but \nher purpose  is  the  only  evidence  in  the  Record,  and  on  that basis,  is  the  only  evidence \nin  this  motion  for  summary judgment  on  the  use  of those  flags. \nSimilarly,  there  is  no  evidence  of a  religious  purpose  in  the  posing  of the  text \nof  the  Lennon  song  “Imagine.”  The  record  only  contains  a  photo  of the  poster  of \nJohn  Lennon,  with the  text  of the  song  in  small type  in the  lower  corner.  2  ER183:21. \nThere  is  no  evidence  of  the  use  of  the  poster  or  the  classroom  in  which  it  was \ndisplayed.  2  ER  183.  It  could have  been part  of a unit  on the  Vietnam War,  or related \nto  a  music  class.  It  could  have  been  part  of  a  student  display.  There  is  simply  no \nevidence  who  put  up  the  poster  or  why.  The  Court  has  made  it  clear  that  —  in  the \nanalysis  of  words  violative  of  the  establishment  clause  —  the  “context”  of  the \nlanguage  is  “determinative.”  Newdow  v.  Rio  Linda  Union  School  Dist.,  597  F.3d \n1007,  1019  (9th  Cir.  2010).  In  this  case  Johnson  did  not  submit  evidence  of  the \n_14-\ncontext  of  the  John  Lennon  poster,  or  the  words  of  the  song  “Imagine”  which \nappeared  to  be  important  in  the  District  Court’s  decision.  Absent  the  evidence  of \ncontext,  the  determination  that  the  song  was  religious  was  error. \nF.  Johnson’s  Banners Are Not “Ceremonial Deism” Which Would  Constitute \nan  Exception  Under  the  Establishment  Clause. \nThroughout  this  case,  Johnson  has  maintained  that  his  banners  do  not  violate \nthe  Establishment  Clause,  and  therefore  the  School  should  not  have  an \nundifferentiated  fear  of a  violation.  Johnson’s  main  argument  in  this  regard  is  that \nthe  banners  have  phrases  with  historical  and  patriotic  significance.  For  example,  in \nthis  Court,  as  in the  District  Court,  Johnson  has  supported his  view with  a  quote  from \nJustice  O’Connor’s  concurrence  in Elk Grove  Unified School Dist.  v.  Newdow,  where \nJustice  O’Connor  recognizes  that  “[i]t  is  unsurprising  that  a  Nation  founded  by \nreligious  refugees  and  dedicated  to  religious  freedom  should  find  references  to \ndivinity  in  its  symbols,  songs,  mottoes,  and  oaths.”  Elk  Grove  Unified  School Dist. \nv.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  35-36  (2004)  (O’CONNOR  J.,  concurring  in  the judgment) \nHowever,  Johnson’s  use  of  this  quote  as  a  sword  to  attack  the  School’s  position \nignores  the  context  of that  quote  within  the  whole  of Justice  O’Connor’s  concurring \nopinion.  It  also  ignores  the  fact that the  Poway administration  does  not  disagree with \nher.  A  closer  examination  of  Justice  O’Connor’s  concurrence  and  the  School’s \n-15-\npractices  is  warranted  to  dispel  Johnson’s  arguments  concerning  this  out-of-context \nquote. \nIn  Elk  Grove,  Justice  O’Connor  confronted,  head  on,  the  issue  of whether  the \nphrase  “one  Nation  under  God”  in  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance  violates  the \nEstablishment  Clause  when  recited  at  school.  Using  the  “endorsement”  test, \nO’Connor  wrote  that  government  endorsement  of  religion  “sends  a  message  to \nnonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members  of the political  community,  and \nan accompanying message to  adherents  that they are  insiders,  favored members  of the \npolitical  community.”  /d.  at  34,  quoting Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465  U.S.  668,  688  (1984) \n(O’CONNOR,  J.,  concurring).  O’Connor  opined  that  the  government  does  not \nendorse  a  particular  religion  when  a  reference  to  the  divine  is  historical  and  adds  an \nair  of  solemnity  to  a  secular  occasion.  Such  use  then  does  not  offend  the \nConstitution.  This  is  what  she  called  “ceremonial  deism.”  Elk  Grove,  524  U.S.  at \n35-36  (O°CONNOR,  J.,  concurring). \nJustice  O’Connor  concluded  that  the  recitation  of  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance \nconstituted  such  “ceremonial  deism”  because,  in  part,  the  words  “under  God”  were \nnot  prominent  (they  are  but  2  of 31  words  in  the  Pledge)  and  the  Pledge  is  a  secular \nritual  (one  can  remove  the  words  “under  God”  and  the  Pledge  retains  its  power). \nId.  at  43.  Justice  O’Connor  also  noted  that  “the  brevity  of a  reference  to  religion  or \n-16-\nto  God  in  a  ceremonial  exercise  can  be  important  for  several  reasons.  First,  it  tends \nto  confirm  that  the  reference  is  being  used  to  acknowledge  religion  or  to  solemnize \nan  event  rather  than  to  endorse  religion  in  any  way.  Second,  it  makes  it  easier  for \nthose  participants  who  wish  to  ‘opt  out’  of  language  they  find  offensive  to  do  so \nwithout  having  to  reject  the  ceremony  entirely.  And third,  it  tends  to  limit  the  ability \nof government  to  express  a  preference  for  one  religious  sect  over  another.”  Jd.  at  42. \nIt  is  this  minimal religious  content that,  in  Justice  O’Connor’s  mind,  gives  the  pledge \nits  ceremonial  character.  /d. \nIn  Justice  O’Connor’s  opinion,  it  was  a  “close  question”  as  to  whether  the \nPledge  violates  the  Establishment  clause  (E/A  Grove,  524  U.S.  at  37),  even  though \nthat  clause  is  short  and  fleeting  in  the  larger  context  of  the  Pledge.  She  felt  a \nreasonable  observer would not believe  the  government was  endorsing  religion by the \nphrase  “under  God”  in  the  pledge.  /d.  at  43.  Justice  O’Connor  noted,  however,  that \n‘one  of the  greatest  dangers  to  the  freedom  of the  individual  to  worship  in  his  own \nway  [lies]  in  the  Government’s  placing  its  official  stamp  of  approval  upon  one \nparticular  kind  of  prayer  or  one  particular  form  of  religious  services.’”  Jd.  at  39, \nquoting  Engel  v.  Vitale,  370  U.S.  421,  429  (1962).  Accordingly,  “only  in  the  most \nextraordinary  circumstances  could  actual  worship  or  prayer  be  defended  as \nceremonial  deism.”  Elk  Grove,  542  U.S.  at  40  (O°CONNOR,  J.,  concurring). \n-17-\nO’Connor also warned that  [a]ny  statement that has  as  its purpose placing the  speaker \nor  listener  in  a  penitent  state  of  mind,  or  that  is  intended  to  create  a  spiritual \ncommunion  or  invoke  divine  aid,  strays  from  the  legitimate  secular  purposes  of \nsolemnizing  an  event  and  recognizing  a  shared  religious  history.  Santa  Fe \nIndependent  School  Dist.  v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  309  (2000)  (T]he  use  of  an \ninvocation  to  foster  ...  solemnity  is  impermissible  when,  in  actuality,  it  constitutes \n[state-sponsored]  prayer”).  /d.,  parallel  citations  omitted. \nHere,  Johnson’s  banners  are  not  a  form  of  “ceremonial  deism”  permitted  by \nJustice  O’Connor.  Had Johnson posted the  entire  text  of the  Pledge  of Allegiance  on \nhis  wall,  as  the  School  suggested he  do,  then under  O’Connor’s  analysis,  there would \nnot be  a  Constitutional  violation.  But  Johnson  instead  cherry-picked the  phrase  “‘one \nNation  under  God”  and  displayed  it  in  large  letters  on  a banner.  Instead  of the  words \n“under  God”  making  up  2  of 31  words  in  the  Pledge,  they  now  constitute  50%  of the \nwords  in  the  phrase  on  his  banner.  Similarly,  Johnson  took  a  key phrase  referencing \nGod  or  Creator  and put  them up  on  his  banners,  eschewing  the  remainder  of the  texts \nfrom  which  the  phrases  came.  The  word  God  is  used  repeatedly  on  the  banners,  and \nthis  repetition  is  exactly  what  Justice  O’Connor  warned  against.  By  doing  so,  the \n“ceremonial  deism”  was  lost,  and  what  remains  is  the  advocacy  of religion  by  using \nphrases  which  might  not  offend  the  Constitution  if  kept  in  context.  If  Justice \n-18-\nO’Connor  thought  that  the  Pledge  itself was  a  close  call  as  to  whether  it  violated  the \nEstablishment  Clause,  then  when  the  “God”  phrases  are  removed  and  highlighted \nfrom  their  texts,  as  Johnson  has  done  here,  it  is  a  close  call  no  longer.  Johnson’s \nbanners  run  afoul  of the  Establishment Clause,  and it  is  not an  “undifferentiated fear.” \nMoreover,  the  School’s  actions  do  not  run  contrary  to  what  Justice  O’  Connor \nhas  said.  The  School  gave  Johnson  the  option  to  place  his  phrases  in  their  context  in \nposters  of the  actual historical  documents  and song lyrics.  Johnson was  not interested \nin  displaying  his  hand-picked  phrases  in  their  ceremonial  context,  however. \nBut,  says  Johnson,  the  School  permitted  another  teacher  to  display  a  series  of \nflags  with  Sanskrit  writing  and  a  very  small  picture  of  a  Buddha-like  figure,  and \ntherefore  Equal  Protection  has  been  violated.  The  ACLU  agrees  with  Johnson  (one \nof their  few  agreements).  The  reality  is,  however,  that the  tiny  depiction  of the  figure \nin  the  larger  context  of the  flags  is  nominal,  in  the  same  way  that  2  out  of 31  words \nin the  text  of the Pledge  of Allegiance  which refer to  the  devine  is  nominal,  according \nto  Justice  O’Connor.  Moreover,  the  flags  do  not advocate  for a particular religion and \nare  decorative  in nature,  whereas  Johnson’s  banners  advocate  for the  Judeo-Christian \nreligion.  Or  at  the  very  least,  the  banners  advocate  the  a  divine  origin  of the  earth, \ngiven that  the  “Creator”  banner was  surrounded by pictures  of nature.  There  are a  lot \nof people  who  don’t  believe  that  a  divine  power  created  the  earth,  so  what  Johnson \n-19-\nis  doing  is  advocating.  In  that  context,  the  School  did  not  violate  the  Equal \nProtection  clause  nor  the  Establishment  Clause. \nG.  Although  the  Banners  Were  Displayed  For  A  Long  Time,  The  Court \nShould  Be  Wary  of  Assigning  Constitutional  Protections  Based  Upon \nTime. \nJohnson  also  maintains  that  the  fact  that  the  banners  were  displayed  for  a  long \ntime  on  his  walls  mitigates  against  the  School’s  right  to  remove  them. \nBut  “no  one  acquires  a vested  or protected right  in violation  of the  Constitution \nby  long  use,  even  when  that  span  of time  covers  our  entire  national  existence  and \nindeed  predates  it.  Yet  an  unbroken  practice  ...  is  not  something  to  be  lightly  cast \naside.”  Walz  v.  Tax  Comm’n of City  of New  York,  397  U.S.  664,  678  (1970). \nHere,  there  are  different  students  who  enter  Johnson’s  classroom  every  year. \nSuch  is  the  high-school  cycle  of  admission  and  graduation.  And  unlike  the \nmonument  cases,  where  a  religious  themed  message  is  portrayed  in  a  public  square \nor  outside  a  public  building,  Johnson’s  classroom  is  not  open  to  the  general  public. \nUnless  a  student  cares  enough  to  complain,  or  an  administrator  notices  that  the \nbanners  might violate the  Establishment  Clause  (as was  the  case  here),  there  is  no  one \nelse  to  challenge  Johnson’s  actions. \n-20-\nJohnson’s  argument  that  he  is  an  experienced  and  excellent  teacher  actually \ncuts  against  him  in  this  regard.  As  a  teacher  with  a  good  reputation,  he  is  not  going \nto  be  as  closely  scrutinized  for  his  teaching  practices  as  would  a  new  or  younger \nteacher.  Accordingly,  administrators,  over time,  will  tend to  spend  less  and  less  time \nin  his  classroom.  And  when  the  administrators  are  there,  they  are  probably  not \nlooking  around  the  room  at  his  classroom  displays,  but  are  focusing  on  the  lesson \nplan,  whether  students  are  engaged  in  learning,  and  whether  math  skills  are  being \nimparted  from  teacher  to  student.  And  after  25  years,  even  that  evaluation \nundoubtedly  becomes pro forma. \nH.  The  Individual  Defendants  Are  Entitled  to  Qualified  Immunity. \nJohnson  begins  his  arguments  by  noting  that  the  defense  of  “qualified \nimmunity”  does  not  apply  to  injunctive  or  declaratory  relief.  Johnson,  however, \nsought  and  obtained  nominal  damages  against  the  individual  Defendants.  So  the \nqualified  immunity  discussion  is  at  issue. \nContrary  to  the  District  Court’s  holding,  the  law  is  not  clearly  established  in \nfavor  of teacher  speech  in  the  classroom,  and  in  fact,  the  majority  of the  cases  would \npoint to  a limitation  on the teachers  rights,  and  forbid  school  districts  from displaying \nsuch  a banner.  Even  if Johnson’s banners  are  entitled to  constitutional protection,  the \nindividual  Defendants  should  be  protected  by  qualified  immunity  because  the  law \n_2]-\ngoverning  teacher-speech  on  the  subject  of religion  in  the  classroom  is  not  so  well \ndeveloped  that  a  reasonable  person  would  know  which  rule  applies. \nThe  clear  holding  in  Pe/oza  would  make  any  school  administrator  who  was \nfamiliar  with  the  case  absolutely  certain  that  he  or  she  had  an  obligation  to  stop  a \nteacher  from  advocating  about  religion  during  the  school  day.  Peloza — taken  alone \n—  should have  been  sufficient basis  for the  District  Court to  rule  in  favor  of qualified \nimmunity. \nSchool  administrators  should  not  need  a  law  degree  in  order  to  carry  out  their \nduties.  But  without  a  law  degree  it  would  be  difficult  to  evaluate  the  current  cases \nor  to  balance  between  the  right  of  the  teacher  to  state  his  views  in  the  classroom \nagainst  the  right  of the  students  to  be  free  of government  assertions  about  religion. \nFor example,  the  phrase  “One Nation Under  God”  has  been the  subject  of substantial \ndisagreement  among  the  members  of this  Court.  And  reasonable  people  watch  the \ndisagreements  on  the  evening  news.  Just  a  couple  of years  before  the  events  in  this \ncase,  the  Ninth  Circuit  ruled  that  the  words,  “One  nation  under  God”  in  the  Pledge \nof Allegiance were  illegal  in  the  classroom.  Newdow  vy.  U.S.  Congress,  328  F.3d 466 \n(9th  Cir.  2005).  That  event  was  widely  reported  in  the  news.  A  reasonable  person \ncould  be  excused  for  believing  that  the  reference  to  “God”  was  the  problem  that  the \nNinth  Circuit  identified.  The  reversal  of  the  decision  was  not  as  well  reported, \n-2)-\nbecause  it  was  less  sensational.  After that  event,  another  case  was  filed by Newdow, \nand  subsequently  the  Ninth  Circuit  has  ruled  that  the  phrase  “one  nation  under  God” \nis  not  a  problem,  in  the  context  of the  entire  Pledge  of Allegiance.  (Newdow  v.  Rio \nLinda  Union  School Dist.,  597  F.3d  1007  (9th  Cir.  2010)).  Those  two  cases  make  it \nstarkly  clear that the  law  governing  teacher-speech  about  God  in  the  classroom  is  not \nwell  settled  for  the  “reasonable  person,”  and  is  currently  a  shifting  issue  subject  to \nfurther  change.  If itis  difficult  for  lawyers  and  Judges  to  determine  the  rules  in  each \ncase,  it  is  impossible  for  a  school  administrator. \nIt  appears  that  it  is  the  context  of the  phrase  in  the  Pledge  was  a  necessary part \nof the  analysis.  “When  it  comes  to  testing  whether  words  and  actions  are  violative \nof the  Establishment Clause,  context  is  determinative.”  Newdow, supra,  at  1019.  The \ndecision  seems  to  indicate  that the  phrase  taken  out  of context would have  been ruled \nto  be  improper.  J/d.  at  1019,  ftnt  9.  A  reasonable  person  could  be  excused  for \nbelieving  that  placing  the  phrase  “one  nation  under  God”  enlarged,  on  the  wall  of a \nclassroom,  would  take  the  phrase  out  of context  of the  Pledge,  and  make  it  less  than \nappropriate  in  the  classroom.  When  placed  on  the  wall  —  along  with  other  phrases \ncontaining  references  to  God  —  the  context  shifts,  and  the  context  becomes  a \nmessage  proclaiming  the  national  endorsement  of the  Judeo-Christian religion.  That \n-73-\nAQF  MAay  os  on  eye \nPWEaSl eR P FF PReNet   IS  TMBSR RANNe Aen   NTeS EO   SLWNESP    SOeA S \nshift  in  context  argues  strongly  that  the  law  is  not  clearly  established  and  the \nadministrators  could  not  have  known  the  correct  rule  to  apply. \nAs  Justice  Souter  recently  indicated  in  a  concurrence,  “there  is  no  doubt  that \nthis  case  and  its  government  speech  claim  has  been  litigated  by  the  parties  with  one \neye  on the  Establishment  Clause  [citation].  The  interaction between the  “government \nspeech  doctrine”  and  Establishment  Clause  principles  has  not,  however,  begun  to  be \nworked  out.”  Pleasant  Grove  City,  Utah  v.  Summum,  129  S.Ct.  1125,  1138,  172 \nL.Ed.  2d  853  (2009). \nThere has been much dispute  over religion in the  schools,  and the  issues  are not \nyet fully resolved,  but the  general rule  is  that public  schools  may not endorse  religion. \nPrayer  in  public  schools,  even  a  nondenominational  prayer,  is  an  impermissible \ngovernment  endorsement  of religion.  Engel  v.  Vitale,  supra,  82  S.  Ct.  1261  (1962). \nReading  from  the  Bible  over  the  intercom  is  unconstitutional.  Abington  School \nDistrict  v.  Schempp,  374  U.S.  203  (1963).  Posting  the  Ten  Commandments  on  the \nwall  in  school  is  not  permitted.  Stone  v.  Graham,  449  U.S.  39  (1980).  A  state  may \nnot  require  even  a  moment  of silence  in  school  if the  motivation  for  the  statute  was \nthe  encouragement  of  prayer.  Wallace  v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  105  S.  Ct.  2479 \n(1985).  It  is  unconstitutional  for  a  school  to  bring  clergy  to  perform  a \nnondenominational  prayer  at  graduation.  Lee  v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  577,  587,  112 \n_24-\nS.Ct.  2649  (1992).  The  Court  indicated  concern  that  children  would  feel  coerced by \nhaving  a  prayer  recited  at  graduation  that  violated  their  beliefs.  /d.  at  587. \nIn  the  case  at  bar,  the  evidence  is  that  the  school  Principal  was  concerned  that \na  student  might  feel  uncomfortable.  ER  424:18-20;  506  p.  44:4-13.  Her  concern \nexactly paralleled  the  majority  viewpoint  in  Lee  v.  Weisman,  supra.  Yet  the  District \nCourt  denied  immunity  and  awarded  damages  against  her  personally. \nSimilarly,  the  established  rule  is  that  the  state  may  not  force  students  to  recite \nthe  Pledge  of  Allegiance.  Barnette,  supra,  319  U.S.  624.  Yet  the  District  Court \npermitted  Johnson  to  force  the  students  in  his  class  to  read  one  of the  critical  phrases \nfrom  that  Pledge  every  day.  There  is  certainly  a  distinction  between  being  force  to \nrecite  a  pledge,  and  being  force  to  read  it,  but  that  is  not  a  significant  distinction. \nIt  is  clear teaching  religion  in the  schools  is  not permitted.  McCollum  v.  Board \nof Education  Dist.  71,  333  U.S.  203  (1948).  The  State  may  not  ban  the  teaching  of \nevolution,  nor  alter  the  course  of  study  to  promote  a  religious  point  of  view. \nEpperson  v.  Arkansas,  393  U.S.  97  (1968).  The  State  also  may  not  require  the \nteaching  of  creation  science  along  with  evolution.  Edwards  vy.  Aquillard,  482  U.S. \n578  (1987). \nIt  is  our  tradition  and  law,  that  parents  decide  what  religion  their  children  are \ntaught.  It  is  only the  parents—  not  the  schools  or  the  school  teacher — who  hold  the \n-25-\nSWAaaNQtal F a lSe  FMP PARSa ES yPA S  =TR2: FS   8A NeMSe EnN a rn  wTSRwEEe YEs    SAwAShTP   oyw OaSAet Sey   \nright  to  select  their  own  children’s  religion.  Wisconsin  v.  Yoder,  406  U.S.  205, \n(1972).  Teachers  have  some  of the  same  rights  as  parents,  but  the  remaining  rights \nare  reserved  to  the  parents.  Veronia  School District v.  Acton,  515  U.S.  646,  655-656 \n(1995).  In this  case,  the District Court has placed Johnson  in a  superior position,  with \nthe  same  right  to  endorse  a  religious  belief as  the  students’  own  parents. \nThe  District  Court’s  ruling  treated  teacher-speech  different  from  government \nspeech.  If the  District  Court  is  correct,  then  teachers  can  pray  in  class,  and  the  state \ncannot  stop  them.  That  does  not  seem  consistent with  the  case  law,  but  it  is  certainly \nnot  “clearly  settled.””  Any  school  administrator  should  be  forgiven  for believing  that \nthe  school  district  had  a  duty  to  stop  the  teacher  from  doing  what  the  school  clearly \ncould  not  do:  endorse  religion. \nAlthough  the  law  on  that  issue  is  not  yet  clear,  the  cases  are  impliedly  in  favor \nof  limiting  teacher-speech  in  the  same  way  that  state-speech  is  limited  regarding \nreligions.  If  a  school  administrator  read  the  most  pertinent  school  cases,  he  or  she \nwould  be  justified  in  believing  that  the  school  had  the  right  to  limit  the  teachers \nspeech  in  the  classroom.  The  most  relevant  cases  are  Mayer  v.  Monroe  County \nCommunity  School  Corp.,  474  F.3d  477  (7th  Cir.  2007),  California  Teachers  Ass’n \nv.  State  Bd.  of Educ.,  271  F.3d  1141  (9th  Cir.  2001),  Downs,  supra,  228  F.3d  1003, \nPeloza,  supra,  37  F.3d  517,  and Roberts  v.  Madigan,  921  F.2d  1047  (10th  Cir.  1990). \n-26-\nConsider a  school  administrator confronted by Johnson’s banners,  and familiar \nwith  the  following  rulings: \nNicholson  v.  Board of Educ.  Torrance  Unified School  Dist.,  682  F.2d  858,  682 \n(9th  Cir.  1982)  -  A  teacher  could  be fired  for  a  dispute  with  the  Principal  over  an \narticle  in  the  school  newspaper; \nPeloza,  supra  -  A  teacher  could  not  teach  creationism  or  call  evolution  a \nreligion; \nTucker,  supra  -  A  computer  specialist  could put up  documents  about religion; \nDowns,  supra  -  A  teacher  could  not  post  material  on  hallway  bulletin  board; \nBerry,  supra  -  A  social  worker  could  not  display  religious  items  in  the \nworkplace; \nRoberts,  supra  -  A  teacher  could  not  display  the  Bible  and  posters  in  the \nclassroom; \nBishop  v.  Aronov,  926  F.2d  1066  (11th  Cir.  1991)  -  a  college  professor  could \nnot  talk  about  his  religious  beliefs  in  class; \nBerger  v.  Rensselaer  Cent.  School  Corp.,  982  F.2d  1160  (7th  Cir.  1993)  -  a \nschool  could  prohibit  distribution  of Bibles  to  fifth  grade  students; \nMayer,  supra  -a Teacher could not present personal views  on war during class. \n_27-\nThe  relationship  between  religion  and  the  state  is  difficult  for  Judges  to \ndetermine.  If  appellate  court  judges  cannot  agree,  then  the  law  is  not  settled,  and \nschool  administrators  cannot  be  held  to  know  what  the  law  is.  Should  this  Court \naffirm the  District  Court with respect to  Johnson’s  claims  against the  School District, \nthen  it  still  should  reverse  with  respect  to  qualified  immunity  and  have  summary \njudgment  entered  in  favor  of the  individual  Defendants. \nIl.  CONCLUSION \nJohnson  chastises  the  School  for  not  creating  a  true  “marketplace”  of  ideas, \nwhich  would  in  turn  permit  teachers  to  discuss  the  merits  of  various  religions. \nAppellee’s  Brief,  p.  42.  Such  a  marketplace  would  be  a  dangerous  game,  where  the \nmajority  of  a  particular  religion  could  prosteletyze  to  the  minority,  and  in  such \nsituation  could  foster an  environment not  of learning  and collegiality,  but  of religious \nadvocacy  and  castigation  of the  minority. \nThe  unstated  notion  that  leaps  from  the  page  in  Johnson’s  brief  is  that \nevangelism in  schools  is  appropriate,  so  long  as  it  is  draped in the  American  flag.  But \nschools  should  not  be  turned  into  referendums  on  the  proper  religion  for  students. \nInstead,  as  the  School’s  policy  and  practices  indicate,  the  advocacy  of  a  particular \nreligion  is  prohibited. \n-28-\nCase:  10-55445  09/27/2010  Page:  38  of  39  ID:  7488730  DktEntry:  23-1 \nThe  Court  is  respectfully  requested  to  reverse  the  judgment  on  each  of  the \nmotions  for  summary judgment,  and  instruct the  trial  court to  deny Johnson’s  motion \nand  grant  the  Defendants’  motion. \nRespectfully  Submitted, \nDATED:  September  27,  2010  STUTZ  ARTIANO  SHINOFF  &  HOLTZ \nA  Professional  Corporation \nBy:  /s/  Paul  V.

Muise \nRobert J.  Muise,  Esq.  * \nAdmitted pro  hac vice \nCharles  S.  LiMandri,  Esq. \nCounsel for Plaintiff Bradley Johnson \nPLAINTIFF'S  MEMORANDUM  OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES  IN  SUPPORT  OF  MOTION  FOR \nSUMMARY JUDGMENT \nINTRODUCTION \nWhen deciding this motion,  the  court need not work  off of a blank  slate.  In its  decision denying the  School \nDistrict's motion to  dismiss  (Doc.  No.  25), this  court  set forth the relevant and controlling  case  law that will ultimately \ndecide this  case.  In light of this  controlling law  and the undisputed material  facts uncovered during the  course  of \ndiscovery,  Plaintiff [*3]  Bradley Johnson contends that he  1s  entitled to  a judgment in his  favor on all  claims  as  a matter \nof law. \nAs this  court noted previously,  it is without question that public  school teachers have  constitutional nights, \nincluding the right to  freedom of speech,  and that California  school  officials,  who  are  acting  on behalf of the \ngovernment,  are restrained in their actions by the United States  and California Constitutions.  (Doc.  No.  25).  Indeed,  it \nhas been  \"the unmistakable holding\"  of the  United  States  Supreme  Court for decades that neither  \"students  [nor] \nteachers  shed their constitutional nghts to  freedom of speech or expression at the  schoolhouse gate.\"  Tinker v.  Des \nMoines Indep.  City.  Sch.  Dist.,  393  U.S.  503,  506  (1969).  Consequently, teachers,  such as Plaintiff,  do have rights,  and \nwhen government officials violate those nghts,  they  should be held accountable,  as  in this  case. \nSTANDARD  OF REVIEW \n\"Summary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as  a disfavored procedural  shortcut,  but rather as  an \nintegral part of the  Federal Rules  as  a whole,  which are  designed to  secure the just,  speedy  and inexpensive \ndetermination of every  action.\"  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317,  327  (1986)  [*4]  (internal  quotations  omitted). \nFederal Rule  of Civil  Procedure  56  provides that a motion for summary judgment must be  granted when  \"the \npleadings,  depositions,  answers to  interrogatories,  and admissions  on file, together with the  affidavits,  if any,  show that \nthere  is no genuine issue  as to  any material  facts  and that the moving party 1s  entitled to  a judgment as  a matter of law.\" \nFed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c). \nThe Rule  56  \"standard provides that the mere  existence  of some  alleged factual  dispute between the parties will not \ndefeat an otherwise properly  supported motion for  summary judgment;  the requirement is that there be no genuine  issue \nof material fact.\" Anderson  v.  Liberty Lobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  247-48  (1986).\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *4 \nIn the present case,  there  is no  genuine  issue  of material  fact and Plaintiff is  entitled to judgment in his  favor as to \nall  claims  as  a matter of law. \nSTATEMENT  OF  FACTS \nPlaintiff is  currently a public  school math teacher at Westview High  School in the  Poway Unified  School District \n(hereinafter  \"School District\").  He has taught math in the  School District for more than 30 years.  During these  30  plus \nyears,  he has taught at 3  different  [*5]  high  schools in the  district,  including Mt.  Carmel High  School  (1977 to  1989), \nRancho  Bernardo High School  (1990  to  2002),  and now Westview High  School  (2003  to present).  (SOMF  at PP  1-4). \nnl  Plaintiff has  a  strong reputation as  a teacher;  he  continues to be  one  of the highest rated math teachers  at Westview \nHigh  School.  (SOMF  at P  19). \nnl  \"SOMF\"  refers to  Plaintiff's  Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion for Summary \nJudgment, which was  filed along with this brief. \nThe  School District believes that public  schools play  an important role  educating and guiding our youth through the \nmarketplace  of ideas  and instilling national values.  One method used by the  School District to  accomplish this task 1s to \npermit students to be  exposed to the rich diversity  of backgrounds  and opinions held by high  school  faculty.  n2  (SOMF \nat PP  63,  64). \nn2  The  School  District permits  its teachers to participate in the  \"day  of silence\"-a pro-gay rights  activity-on \nSchool District property with the  students  so long  as the teacher's participation does not disrupt the teaching  of \nhis  or her classes.  (SOMF  at P  65). \n[*6] \nAccordingly,  for the past 30  plus years,  the  School District has  adopted a policy,  practice,  and/or custom of \npermitting teachers to  display in their classrooms various non-curricular messages  and other items that reflect the \nindividual teacher's personality,  opinions,  and values regarding  a wide range  of interests  and  subject matter. \nConsequently,  for the past 30  plus years,  the  classroom walls have  served and continue to  serve  as  a forum for teachers \nto  convey non-curricular messages  on subjects that interest them.  (SOMF  at PP  35-50). \nPursuant to this  long-standing  School District policy, practice,  and/or custom,  teachers have  displayed and continue \nto  display in their classrooms  such non-curricular materials  as posters  of rock bands  and musicians;  a poster of the \ncontroversial  song /magine written by John Lennon;  posters  of various professional  athletes  and professional  sports \nteams;  family photographs;  non-student artwork;  posters  and other items,  such as bumper stickers,  decals,  and buttons, \npromoting and advocating  a viewpoint on social  and political  issues  such as gay rights,  global warming,  animal \nresearch,  the  environment,  anti-war/peace,  the military,  and others.  (SOMF  [*7]  at PP  36-39,  42-50). \nPursuant to this policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  the  School District has  allowed teachers to  display Tibetan prayer \nflags,  which are  considered  sacred items by those who practice the religion of Buddhism.  n3  Teachers have  also \ndisplayed and continue to  display nature pictures;  inspirational messages  on posters  and banners;  patriotic messages  on \nposters,  banners,  and flags;  movie posters;  posters  of famous religious  leaders,  such as  Gandhi  (Hindu),  the  Dali Lama \n(Buddhist),  and the  controversial Malcolm X (the Nation of Islam/Islam);  and items  of particular political parties  and/or \ncandidates,  including  a campaign poster of candidate  Obama,  a Newsweek magazine  cover of the  candidates  Obama and \nBiden;  and a poster of the  \"Libertarian Party.\"  (SOMF  at PP  36-39,  42-50,  53-54).\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *7 \nn3  Buddhists believe that these  flags  impart a spiritual blessing upon those in the presence  of the  flags.  (SOMF \nat P  53). \nPermissible  subject matter for this  forum for teacher  speech includes,  inter alia,  [*8]  the  foundations  of our Nation, \npatriotic messages,  inspirational messages,  historical messages,  and slogans that are praiseworthy  of our Nation.  (SOMF \nat P  37). \nPursuant to this  School  District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  for approximately 25  years,  Plaintiff continuously \ndisplayed,  without any objections  from the  School  District or its  administrators,  on his  classroom walls various patriotic \nbanners that reflect the history  and heritage  of our Nation.  Plaintiff had the banners made to  order by  a private  company \nand purchased them with his  own personal  funds.  The banners  do not belong to the  School District;  they are Plaintiff's \npersonal items.  (SOMF  at PP 20-23). \nPlaintiff's banners  contain well-known historical, patriotic phrases  and  slogans  central to  our Nation's history  and \nheritage,  and they reflect the  foundations  of our Nation.  The banners  do not contain quotes  or passages  from  Sacred \nScripture  or any  other religious text.  (SOMF  at PP  68-88). \nThe  classrooms in which Plaintiff's banners were  displayed were  assigned to him.  His  current classroom in \nWestview High  School is his  classroom for homeroom and academic  classes.  He has  also uses his  classroom for \nnon-curricular  [*9]  and extra-curricular activities.  (SOMF  at P 25). \nIt was  and continues to be  a matter of School District policy, practice,  and/or custom that teachers  are  given \ndiscretion and control  over the various non-curricular messages  displayed on their classroom walls.  For example,  no \nteacher is permitted to  display materials  or messages  on Plaintiff's  classroom walls without his permission,  and the \nSchool District does not direct the teachers’  non-curricular displays;  it is up to the individual teacher.  (SOMF  at PP \n32-34). \nPlaintiff's banners  contain the  following historical,  patriotic phrases:  \"In God We  Trust,\"  the  official motto  of the \nUnited  States;  \"One Nation Under God,\"  the  1954  amendment to the  Pledge  of Allegiance;  \"God Bless  America,\"  a \npatriotic  song;  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee,\"  a line  from  \"America the  Beautiful,”  a patriotic  song;  and  \"All Men Are \nCreated Equal,  They Are Endowed By  Their Creator,”  an excerpt from the preamble to the  Declaration of \nIndependence.  (SOMF  at PP  68-88).  Consequently,  the  subject matter of Plaintiff's  speech was permissible  1n this \nforum.  (SOMF  at PP  37,  103,  104). \nPlaintiff's banners were not displayed pursuant to  any of his  official  duties  as  a  [*10]  teacher.  He  did not use his \nbanners  during  any  classroom  session or period of instruction.  His banners  caused no material  disruption or disorder in \nhis  classroom or anywhere  else in the  school.  His banners  did not interfere with the teaching  of his  classes.  And his \nbanners were not expressing  a message  on behalf of the  School  District.  (SOMF  at PP 26-27,  60-63,  90,  98). \nPlaintiff's  long-standing practice  of displaying his banners  came to  an abrupt end when on or about January 23, \n2007,  Defendants  ordered him to remove the banners.  n4  Defendants  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners because \nthe  School District believed that the banners were promoting a  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  viewpoint.  On behalf of \nthe  School District,  Defendant William Chiment,  Assistant Superintendent at the time,  n5  sent a letter to Plaintiff \nexplaining the  order to remove the banners.  In the letter,  Defendant Chiment  stated that Plaintiff's banners  conveyed an \nimpermissible  \"sectarian viewpoint\"  and, more  specifically,  \"a particular sectarian viewpoint.\"  The  \"particular sectarian \nviewpoint\"  noted in the  letter was referring to the viewpoint of \"those religious  groups who refer to  a  supreme being as \n[*11]  God,\"  such as  Christians.  Defendant Dawn Kastner,  Plaintiff's principal  at Westview High  School,  believed that \nPlaintiff's banners were impermissible because they  expressed a  \"Christian\"  viewpoint.  (SOMF  at PP  91-96,  100).\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *11 \nn4  Prior to the  School District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners  in 2007,  the  School  District \nreceived no  complaints  about the banners  from  students, teachers,  parents,  or School  Board members.  The  only \ncomplaint to the  School District came  from Defendant Kastner in the  fall  of 2006,  and this  complaint resulted in \nthe  decision to remove the banners.  (SOMF  at P 29). \nn5  Defendant Chiment's present title  is  \"Associate  Superintendent.\"  (See  SOMF  at P  13). \nAt the time  Defendants  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners, they had no  evidence that Plaintiff's banners \ncaused any material  disruption or disorder in the  School District.  Defendants'  removal  of Plaintiff's banners was not \ncurriculum related;  Plaintiff was teaching and continues to teach his  assigned mathematics  [*12]  curriculum. \nDefendants  singled out Plaintiff for disfavored treatment because  of the viewpoint expressed by his message.  (SOMF  at \nPP  98-100,  102,  105). \nThe  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners was  approved by Defendants  Chiment and Kastner,  the \nSuperintendent,  Defendant Donald Phillips,  and the  School  Board.  (SOMF  at PP  5-18,  97). \nPlaintiff wants to  display his banners 1n his  classroom;  however,  Defendants have prohibited him from doing  so. \nHad Plaintiff not complied with Defendants’  order to remove his banners,  Plaintiff would have been  subject to  some \nform of disciplinary action for insubordination.  (SOMF  at PP  101,  106). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants Violated  Plaintiff's  First Amendment Right to  Freedom of Speech. \nA.  Public  School Teachers Possess  Constitutional Rights. \n\"It can hardly be  argued that either students  or teachers  shed their constitutional nghts to  freedom  of speech or \nexpression at the  school house  gate.\"  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at 506 (\"First Amendment rights  .  .  .  are  available to teachers  and \nstudents.\"); Morse v.  Frederick,  127 S.Ct.  2618,  2625  (2007)  (\"In  Tinker,  this  Court made  clear that 'First  [*13] \nAmendment nghts  applied in light of the  special  characteristics  of the  school  environment’  are  available to teachers  and \nstudents.\");  Perry Educ.  Ass'n  v.  Perry Local Educators,  460  U.S.  37,  44  (1983)  (\"The  First Amendment's  guarantee  of \nfree  speech applies to teacher's mailboxes  as  surely  as  it does  elsewhere within the  school  and on sidewalks  outside.\") \n(internal  citation and punctuation omitted);  see also James v.  Board of Educ.,  461  F.2d 566  (2d Cir.  1972) \n(acknowledging teacher's  First Amendment nght to wear a black  armband in protest of Vietnam War).  Consequently, \nPlaintiff is  afforded the protections  of the United  States  and California Constitutions  as  a public  school teacher.  And it is \nwithout question that Plaintiff's  constitutional rights  are implicated by the  School District's viewpoint-based restriction \non his  speech.  See Perry,  460  U.S.  at 44  (\"There is no  question that constitutional interests  are implicated by  denying \n[appellee]  use  of the  interschool mail  system.\"); Keyishian  v.  Board of Regents,  385  U.S.  589,  605-06 (1967)  (\"[T]he \ntheory that public  employment .  .  .  may be  subjected to  any  conditions,  [*14]  regardless  of how unreasonable, has been \nuniformly rejected.\"). \nThe  challenged restriction,  which singled out Plaintiff's  speech based on its viewpoint-specifically,  because  it \nexpressed  \"a particular sectarian viewpoint\"  (1.e.,  Christian)-is  a choice  attributable to the  State,  and from a \nconstitutional perspective it is  as 1f a state  statute  decreed that Plaintiff's  speech had to be banned.  See Lee  v.  Weisman, \n305  U.S.  577,  587  (1992)  (holding that a  school  official's  decision to permit a member of the  clergy to give  an \ninvocation and benediction at the  school's  graduation ceremony was  \"a choice  attributable to the  State,  and from a \nconstitutional perspective it is  as 1f a state  statute  decreed that the prayers must occur\"). \nB.  Plaintiff's  Banners Are  Speech.\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *14 \nIt cannot be  denied that Plaintiff's banners  constitute  speech.  See Hill v.  Colorado,  530  U.S.  703,  715  (2000) \n(\"[S]ign displays  ..  .  are protected by the  First Amendment\");  United States v.

Moreover,  Plaintiff's  speech did not disrupt the  classroom nor \nmaterially interfere with the basic  educational mission of the  School  District.  n6  And his banners were  displayed in a \nforum for teacher  speech created by the  School District. \nn6  The  \"special  characteristics  of the  school  environment\"  permit restrictions  on speech only  so  long  as the \nspeech  \"materially  and  substantially disrupt[s]  the work  and discipline  of the  school.\"  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at 513; \nsee also  Grayned v.  City of Rockford,  408  U.S.  104  (1972)  (same).  As the undisputed evidence  shows,  Plaintiff's \nbanners  did not substantially  disrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school.  Indeed,  his banners had been \ndisplayed without objection for 25  years. \nC.  Defendants  Created  a  Forum  for Plaintiff's  Speech. \nTo  determine the  extent of Plaintiff's  free  speech rights  on  School District property,  [*16]  the  court must engage  in \na First Amendment forum  analysis. Arizona Life  Coal.,  Inc.  v.  Stanton,  515 F.3d 956,  968  (9th  Cir.  2008)  (\"The  first \nstep in assessing  a First Amendment claim relating to private  speech on government property is to  identify the nature  of \nthe  forum.\")  (internal  quotations  omitted). \n\"The  [U.S.  Supreme]  Court has  adopted a forum analysis  as  a means  of determining when the  Government's \ninterest in limiting the use  of its property to  its intended purpose  outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the \nproperty  for expressive purposes.\"  Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Defense  & Educ.  Fund,  473  U.S.  788,  800  (1985);  see \nFlint v.  Dennison,  488 F.3d 816,  828-30,  n.9  (9th  Cir.  2007)  (noting that it 1s  error to not conduct a forum analysis  and \nfurther noting the  U.S.  Supreme  Court has reinforced  \"the  conclusion that we must analyze  [the public  school  speech \nrestriction at issue]  within the  confines  of traditional  forum analysis\");  n7 Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified Sch.  Dist.  No.  48, \n329 F.3d 1044,  1048  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (\"To  analyze his  [First Amendment free  speech]  claim,  we must first consider what \n[*17]  type  of forum the  [school]  District has  created.\"). \nn7  In Hazelwood Sch.  Dist.  v.  Kuhlmeier,  484  U.S.  260,  267 (1988),  the  Supreme  Court applied its  forum \nanalysis  in the  context of a public high  school.  The  Court  specifically noted that school  facilities-such as the \nclassroom walls  in this  case-could be  deemed  \"public  forums\"  for First Amendment purposes 1f school \nauthorities  \"by policy  or by practice\"  opened those  facilities  for use  \"by  some  segment of the public,  such as \nstudent organizations\"-or,  as here,  teachers.  /d. \n\"Forum analysis has traditionally  divided government property into three  categories:  public  fora,  designated public \nfora,  and nonpublic  fora.\" FVint,  488 F.3d at 830  (citation omitted).  \"Once the  forum 1s identified,  we  determine whether \nrestrictions  on speech are justified by the requisite  standard.\" /d.  \"On one  end of the  fora spectrum lies the traditional \npublic  forum,  'places which by long tradition  .  ..  have been devoted to  assembly and  [*18]  debate.’  Next on the \nspectrum is the  so-called designated public  forum, which exists  '[w]hen the  government intentionally  dedicates its \nproperty to  expressive  conduct.\" /d.  (citations  omitted).  As the  Supreme  Court stated,  \"[A]  public  forum may be  created \nby government designation of a place  or channel  of communication for use by the public  at large  for assembly  and \nspeech,  for use by  certain  speakers,  or for the  discussion of certain subjects.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 802  (emphasis \nadded).\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *18 \nIn a public  or designated public  forum, restrictions  on  speech are  subject to  strict  scrutiny.  /Jint,  488 I. 3d at 830. \nIn  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  264-65  (1981),  for example,  the  Court was presented with  \"the  question \nwhether a state university,  which makes  its  facilities generally  available  for the  activities  of registered  student groups, \nmay  close  its  facilities to  a registered  student group  desiring to use the  facilities  for religious worship  and religious \ndiscussion.\"  In deciding the  question,  the  Court stated,  \"Through its policy  of accommodating their meetings,  the \nUniversity has  created a forum generally open for use  [*19]  by  student groups.  Having done  so, the University has \nassumed an obligation to justify its  discrimination and exclusions under applicable  constitutional norms.  .  .  [e]ven if it \nwas not required to  create the  forum in the  first place.\"  n8 /d.  at 267-68.  Consequently,  the  Court considered the  forum \nto be  a designated public  forum,  and because the university  singled out religious  expression for exclusion from this \nforum (a content-based restriction),  the  Court applied strict scrutiny  and struck  down the  challenged regulation.  /d.  at \n270 &  277 (\"It must show that its regulation 1s necessary to  serve  a compelling  state interest and that it 1s narrowly \ndrawn to  achieve that end.\"). \nn8  The  facilities  in question were not generally  open to the public.  See,  Widmar,  454  U.S.  at 267,  n.5  (\"We have \nnot held,  for example,  that a campus must make  all  of its  facilities  equally  available to  students  and nonstudents \nalike,  or that a university must grant free  access to  all  of its grounds  or buildings.\"). \n[*20] \nArguably,  in this  case the  School District created a forum generally  open  \"for use by  certain  speakers\"  (1.e., \nteachers),  thereby  creating  a designated public  forum for this  speech.  And because  Defendants  singled out Plaintiff's \nexpression for exclusion from this  forum based not only  on its  content (which 1s  fatal),  but its viewpoint (which is \ndoubly fatal),  this  court should apply  strict  scrutiny  and  strike  down the  challenged restriction. \nNonetheless,  \"[a]t the  opposite  end of the  fora spectrum 1s the non-public  forum.  The non-public  forum is  '[a]ny \npublic property that 1s not by tradition or designation a forum for public  communication.\"  Flint,  488 F.3d at 830 \n(citations  omitted).  In a nonpublic  forum government restrictions  are  subjected to  less-exacting judicial  scrutiny.  There \na government may restrict free  speech if it acts reasonably  and does not suppress  expression merely because public \nofficials  oppose  one  speaker's view.  /d.  (citations  omitted). \nThe Ninth Circuit also recognizes  a  \"limited public  forum\"  as  a subcategory of the  designated public  forum.  See  id. \nat 830-31.  A  \"limited public  forum\"  is  \"a type  of nonpublic  forum that  [*21]  the  government has intentionally  opened \nto  certain groups  or to  certain topics.\" /d.  at 831.  \"Once  a government has  opened a limited forum,  it must respect the \nlawful boundaries it has itself set.\"  n9 /d.  at 83/  (quoting Rosenberger v.  Rector &  Visitors of Univ.  of Va.,  515  U.S. \n819,  829  (1995))  (internal  quotations  and punctuation omitted).  Accordingly,  in a limited public  forum  \"the  government \nmay not exclude  speech where  its  distinction is not reasonable  in light of the purpose  served by the  forum,  nor may the \ngovernment discriminate  against speech on the basis  of its viewpoint.\"  (int,  488 F.3d at 831  (citations,  punctuation, \nand quotations  omitted). \nn9  Certainly,  if Defendants wanted to take the  draconian  step  of removing all personal  expressive items  from the \nclassroom walls,  thereby closing the  forum to  all  speech,  it could do  so.  But once it has  created this  forum,  it \ncannot pick and choose based on the viewpoint of the  speaker which messages  are  acceptable  and which are not. \nAs the  Supreme  Court stated long  ago  in  West  Virginia State Bd.  of Educ.  v.  Barnette,  319  U.S.  624,  642  (1943), \n\"If there is  any fixed star in our constitutional  constellation,  it 1s that no  official,  high or petty,  can prescribe \nwhat  shall be  orthodox in politics,  nationalism,  religion,  or other matters  of opinion.\"\nPage  8 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *22 \n[*22] \nIn the present case,  the undisputed evidence  shows that pursuant to  a long-standing policy, practice,  and/or custom, \nthe  School District created,  at a minimum,  a  \"limited public  forum\"  that is  generally open for use by teachers,  including \nPlaintiff,  to  express  a variety  of messages,  including personal,  non-curricular messages.  Pursuant to this policy,  practice, \nand/or custom,  teachers  displayed and continue to  display  on their classroom walls messages  and other items that reflect \nthe  individual teacher's personality,  opinions,  and values with regard to  a wide range  of subject matter,  including  social \nand political  concerns.  Permissible  subject matter includes,  inter alia,  patriotic messages,  historical messages, \ninspirational messages,  and messages regarding the  foundations  of our Nation.  Pursuant to this policy,  practice,  and/or \ncustom,  teachers have  discretion and control  over the messages they wish to  convey in this  forum. \nD.  Defendants'  Viewpoint Restriction Violates  the  First Amendment. \nPursuant to  controlling  case  law,  if certain speech  \"fall[s]  within an acceptable  subject matter otherwise included in \nthe  forum, the  State may not legitimately  exclude it from the  [*23]  forum based on the viewpoint of the  speaker.\" \nCogswell v.  City of Seattle,  347 F.3d 809,  815  (9th  Cir.  2003).  And viewpoint discrimination occurs when the \ngovernment  \"denies  access to  a speaker  solely to  suppress the point of view he  espouses  on an otherwise  includible \nsubject.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 806;  see also Sammartano  vy.  irst Judicial Dist.  Court,  303 F.3d 959,  971  (9th  Cir. \n2002)  (acknowledging that  \"where the  government is plainly motivated by the nature  of the message rather than the \nlimitations  of the  forum or a  specific risk within that forum,  it 1s regulating a viewpoint\"). \nAccordingly, because Defendants  singled out Plaintiff's  speech in this  forum based on its viewpoint,  Defendants’ \nspeech restriction cannot survive  constitutional  scrutiny.  As this  court observed in its prior decision, \nIn this  sense,  Johnson's  case 1s  similar to Rosenberger,  Lamb's Chapel v.  Center Moriches  Union Free \nSchool Dist.,  308  U.S.  384  (1993)  and Good News  Club  v.  Milford Central School,  533  U.S.  98,  107-08 \n(2001).  Each case  involved viewpoint discrimination in a limited public  forum.  In Rosenberger,  [*24] \nthe  Supreme  Court found that by excluding funding to  a  student religious group  solely because the \nreligious  group promoted a  particular religious perspective,  the university was  discriminating in a limited \npublic  forum on the basis  of that group's viewpoint.  Rosenberger,  515  U.S.  at 829-37.  In Lamb's  Chapel, \na group  desired to  speak  at a school  facility on the issue  of child rearing  from a  religious perspective.  The \nschool  district denied access to  speakers  from using the  school rooms  for religious purposes.  The \nSupreme  Court unanimously held that the  school  district discriminated on the basis  of viewpoint,  and \nthat the  school  district  should have permitted speech from a religious perspective  on  subject matter \npermitted by the  forum.  Lamb's Chapel,  508  U.S.  at 393.  Similarly,  in Good News  Club,  the  Supreme \nCourt found viewpoint discrimination where  a public  school  excluded a Christian club  from meeting on \nthe  school's  grounds while permitting nonreligious groups to meet.  Good News  Club,  533  U.S.  at  107-09. \nThe  Christian club  simply  sought to  address  a subject otherwise permitted in the limited public  forum.  /d. \nat  109.  [*25]  In laith  Center  [Church Evangelistic Ministries v.  Glover,  480 F.3d 891  (9th  Cir.  2007)], \nthe Ninth Circuit reviewed these  cases  and drew a  line between  speech from a religious perspective \n(which was  constitutionally protected in each of the  limited public  forums)  and pure religious worship \n(which exceeded the boundaries  of the  forums).  Haith  Center,  480 F.3d at 913. \nWhether described as  speech from a religious perspective  or  speech about American history  and culture, \nthrough display  of his  classroom banners,  Johnson was  simply  exercising his  free  speech nghts  on \nsubjects that were  otherwise permitted in the limited public  forum created by Defendants  and in a \nmanner that did not cause  substantial  disorder in the  classroom.  Thus,  Johnson has made  out a clear \nclaim for relief for an ongoing violation of his First Amendment free  speech rights.  See,  e.g.,  [Truth  v.] \nKent School District,  524 F.3d [957,] 973  [9th Cir.  2008]  (observing that in a public high  school  limited \npublic  forum  \"where restriction to the  forum 1s based solely  on. .  .  religious viewpoint,  the restriction 1s \nmvalid\").  (Doc No.  25  at  13-14).  [*26]\nPage  9 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *26 \nIndeed,  speech restrictions  in a nonpublic  forum must be reasonable  and viewpoint neutral.  \"Restrictions  on free \nexpression in a nonpublic  forum are  constitutional  only if the  distinctions  drawn are  (1)  ‘reasonable  in light of the \npurpose  served by the  forum,’  and (2)  'viewpoint neutral.\"  Brown  v.  California Dep't of Transportation,  321 F.3d 1217, \n1222  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (quoting  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 806);  Perry,  460  U.S.  at 46 (stating that speech restrictions in a \nnonpublic  forum must be reasonable  and viewpoint neutral)). \nThe  \"reasonableness\"  prong  \"focuses  on whether the limitation is  consistent with preserving the property for the \npurpose to which it is  dedicated.\"  Brown,  32]  I’.3d at 1222  (internal  quotations  and citation omitted).  Here,  Plaintiff's \nspeech did not disrupt school work,  nor did it cause material  disorder or interference  in the  classroom.  And Defendants’ \norder to remove the banners was not curriculum related;  Plaintiff's banners were not displayed as part of his  official \nduties  as  a teacher nor were they part of his math curriculum,  which he  continues to teach today.  The banners have \nnever  [*27]  prevented Plaintiff from teaching his math curriculum, nor have they limited him in any way in the \nteaching  of his math curriculum.  In fact,  Plaintiff was  and continues to be  one  of the highest rated math teachers  at \nWestview High  School. \nIn  sum,  there is no justification for allowing posters  of rock bands,  posters promoting a particular viewpoint on gay \nrights  or global warming,  displays  of Tibetan prayer flags,  and the host of other displays  and viewpoints permitted,  but \nprohibiting Plaintiff's banners.  As  a result,  Defendants’  speech restriction fails the  first prong because it is unreasonable. \nDefendants’  speech restriction also  fails the  second prong because it was not  \"viewpoint neutral,\"  as noted \npreviously.  n10 \nnl0  The Ninth Circuit has  also  \"incorporated 'viewpoint neutrality’  analysis into nonpublic  forum, \nschool-sponsored speech cases  ...  .\" Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003,  1010  (9th  Cir. \n2000)  (citing Planned Parenthood v.  Clark County Sch.  Dist.,  941  F.2d 817,  828 n.  19,  829-30  (9th  Cir.  1991)). \n[*28] \nIn the  final  analysis, whether the  classroom walls  are  a  \"designated public  forum,”  a  \"limited public  forum,\"  or a \n\"nonpublic  forum\"  it makes  little  difference.  Defendants'  viewpoint-based restriction on Plaintiff's  speech violates the \nFirst Amendment. \nII.  Defendants'  Viewpoint Restriction Violates  the  Equal Protection Clause. \nThe principle  of law  at issue here was  articulated in Police Dept.  of the  City of Chicago v.  Mosley,  408  U.S.  92 \n(1972).  In Mosley,  the  Court struck  down a city ordinance that prohibited all picketing within  150  feet of a  school, \nexcept peaceful picketing  of any  school  involved in a labor dispute.  The  Court held as  follows:  \"[U]nder the  Equal \nProtection Clause,  not to mention the  First Amendment itself,  government may not grant the use  of a forum to people \nwhose views it finds  acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to  express  less  favored or more  controversial views.\" \nAnd in Carey v.  Brown,  447  U.S.  455,  461-62  (1980),  the  Court stated that  \"[W]hen government regulation \ndiscriminates  among  speech-related activities in a public  forum, the Equal  Protection Clause mandates that the \nlegislation be  finely  [*29]  tailored to  serve  substantial  state interests,  and the justification offered for any distinctions  it \ndraws must be  carefully  scrutinized.\" \nHere,  Defendants  opened up  a forum  for teacher expression.  Having maintained this  forum for many  decades, \nDefendants violated Plaintiff's rights when they prohibited his  speech by  ordering his banners removed based on the \ncontent and viewpoint of his message, while permitting other teachers to  continue their speech in the  same  forum \nunfettered.  Thus,  Defendants violated the  equal protection guarantee  of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nPage  10 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *29 \nIll.  Defendants'  Restriction Violates  the  Establishment Clause. \nAs the  Supreme  Court admonished in Santa Fe Indep.  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  307,  n.21  (2000),  \"[T]he \nConstitution  .  .  .  requires that  [courts]  keep in mind the myriad,  subtle ways in which Establishment Clause values  can \nbe  eroded and.  .  .  guard against other different, yet equally important,  constitutional injuries.\"  One  such way in which \nthese  \"values\"  are  eroded is by the government restricting  speech  simply because it allegedly  conveys  a  \"Christian\" \nviewpoint,  as in this  case. \nIn  1952,  the  United  States  Supreme  [*30]  Court acknowledged the  following historical reality:  \"We  are  a religious \npeople whose  institutions presuppose  a Supreme Being.\"  Zorach  v.  Clauson,  343  U.S.  306,  313  (1952).  From at least \n1789,  there has been an unbroken history  of official  acknowledgment by  all three branches  of government of religion's \nrole in American life.  Examples  of this historical  acknowledgment include  Executive  Orders recognizing religiously \ngrounded National Holidays,  such as  Christmas  and Thanksgiving,  Congress  directing the  President to proclaim a \nNational Day  of Prayer each year,  and the printing on our currency  of the national motto,  \"In God We  Trust.\"  As the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court acknowledged in Lynch  v.  Donnelly,  465  U.S.  668,  677-78  (1984): \nOne  cannot look  at even this brief resume  [of historical  examples  of public religious  expression]  without \nfinding that our history is pervaded by expressions  of religious beliefs...  .  Equally pervasive  is the \nevidence  of accommodation of all  faiths  and all  forms  of religious  expression,  and hostility toward none. \nThrough this  accommodation,  as  Justice  Douglas  observed,  governmental  action has  \"follow[ed]  the best \n[*31]  of our traditions\"  and  \"respect[ed]  the religious nature  of our people.\"  (quoting Zorach,  343  U.S. \nat 314). \nRecognition of the role  of God in our Nation's history and heritage is  consistently reflected in  Supreme  Court \ndecisions.  The  Court has  acknowledged,  for example, that religion has been closely identified with our history  and \ngovernment,  and that the history of man is inseparable  from the history  of religion.  Examples  of patriotic  invocations  of \nGod and official  acknowledgments  of religion's role  in our Nation's history  abound.  As  Justice  O'Connor observed,  \"It \n1s unsurprising that a Nation founded by religious refugees  and dedicated to religious  freedom  should find references to \ndivinity in its  symbols,  songs,  mottoes,  and oaths.\" £/k Grove  Unified Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  35-36  (2004) \n(O'Connor,  J.,  concurring in the judgment). \nEfforts to  suppress this recognition and historical  acknowledgment,  as  demonstrated by Defendants’  action here,  are \nthe  antithesis  of the value  of religious tolerance that underlies the United States  and California Constitutions. \nThe  classroom 1s peculiarly the  \"marketplace  of ideas.\"  As  a result, the  [*32]  First Amendment does not tolerate \ngovernmental policies,  practices,  and/or customs that cast a pall  of orthodoxy  over the  classroom,  such as  Defendants’ \nrestriction,  which prohibits Plaintiff from displaying his banners based on the  \"particular  sectarian viewpoint\"  conveyed \nby his message. \nA.  Defendants'  Restriction Disfavors  Religion. \nThroughout its  decisions,  the  Supreme  Court has  consistently  described the Establishment Clause  as  forbidding not \nonly  state  action motivated by  a desire to promote  or  \"advance\"  religion,  see,  e.g.,  County of Allegheny v.  A.C.L.U.,  492 \nU.S.  573,  592  (1989),  but also  actions that tend to  \"disapprove\"  of,  \"inhibit,\"  or evince  \"hostility\"  toward religion.  See \nEdwards v.  Aguillard,  482  U.S.  578,  385  (1987)  (\"disapprove\"); Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 673  (\"hostility\");  Committee for \nPub.  Educ.  & Religious Liberty v.  Nyquist,  413  U.S.  756,  788  (1973)  (“inhibi[t]\"). \nAs the  Supreme  Court noted in Epperson v.  Arkansas,  393  U.S.  97,  104  (1968),  \"The  First Amendment mandates \ngovernmental neutrality between religion and religion,  and between religion and nonreligion.\"  Indeed,  [*33]  even \nsubtle  departures from neutrality  are prohibited.  See,  e.g.,  Church  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc.  v.  City of Hialeah,\nPage  11 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *33 \n508  U.S.  520,  534  (1993). \nIn School Dist.  of Abington  Township v.  Schempp,  374  U.S.  203  (1963),  the  Court stated,  \"We  agree  of course that \nthe  State may not establish a religion of secularism in the  sense  of affirmatively  opposing or showing hostility to \nreligion,  thus preferring those who believe in no religion over those who  do believe.\" /d.  at 225  (internal  quotations  and \ncitation omitted).  As Justice Breyer stated in his  concurrence  in  Van  Orden v.  Perry,  545  U.S.  677,  699  (2005),  \"[T]he \nEstablishment Clause  does not compel the  government to purge  from the public  sphere  all that in any way partakes  of \nthe religious.  Such absolutism is not only inconsistent with our national traditions,  but would also tend to promote the \nkind of social  conflict the  Establishment Clause  seeks to  avoid.\"  (internal  citations  omitted). \nIn Church  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc.  v.  City of Hialeah,  508  U.S.  520,  532  (1993),  the  Court stated the \nrelevant principle  of law  applicable here:  \"In  [*34]  our Establishment Clause  cases we have  often  stated the principle \nthat the  First Amendment forbids  an official purpose to  disapprove  of a particular religion or of religion in general.\" \nThus,  a restriction that disfavors  \"religion in general\"-or worse,  one that disfavors  \"a particular sectarian \nviewpoint,\"  such as the restriction at issue here-violates the neutrality mandated by the  Establishment Clause. \nB.  Defendants'  Restriction Disfavors  a Particular Religion. \nIn addition to mandating neutrality toward religion in general,  the First Amendment also  forbids hostility aimed at a \nparticular faith.  \"The  clearest command of the  Establishment Clause  is that one religious  denomination cannot be \nofficially preferred over another.\"  Larson  v.  Valente,  456  U.S.  228,  244  (1982);  see also  County of Allegheny,  492  U.S. \nat 608-09 (\"[W]e have  expressly required 'strict scrutiny’  of practices  suggesting  'a denominational preference.\"\"); \nChurch  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc,  508  U.S.  at 532  (stating that the  Establishment Clause  \"forbids  an official \npurpose to  disapprove  of a particular religion\"); Epperson,  393  U.S.  at 103-04  [*35]  (stating that the  government  \"may \nnot be hostile to  any religion\");  Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 673  (stating that the  Constitution  \"forbids hostility toward any\" \nreligion). \nRemarkably,  even though Plaintiff's  speech expressed messages that had historical  significance  and did not contain \nreligious text,  Defendants  censored the  speech because they  claimed that the banners  conveyed an impermissible \n\"Christian\"  viewpoint.  Leaving  aside the  inaccuracy  of that claim,  nl1  Defendants violated the Establishment Clause by \nsingling  out Plaintiff's  speech because they believed it conveyed  \"a particular sectarian viewpoint.\" \nnl1  Indeed,  Plaintiff's banners  contain historical,  patriotic phrases  and  slogans  central to  our Nation's history and \nheritage;  the banners  do not contain passages  from  Sacred Scripture  or other religious texts.  See,  e.g.,  Lynch,  465 \nU.S.  at 677-78;  Elk Grove  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  342  U.S.  at 35-36 (O'Connor,  J.,  concurring). \nC.  Defendants'  Speech Restriction  [*36]  Violates Lemon  and  Its  Modifications. \nDefendants’  speech restriction,  which disfavored  \"a particular sectarian viewpoint\"  (1.e.,  a Christian viewpoint), \nviolates the Establishment Clause  as to  1ts purpose  and effect.  And it creates  an impermissible  entanglement.  See Lemon \nv.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602  (1971)  (describing test for evaluating Establishment Clause  claims). \n1.  The Purpose and  Effect of Defendants’  Restriction. \n\"The purpose prong of the Lemon test asks whether government's  actual purpose  is to  endorse  or disapprove  of \nreligion.  The  effect prong  asks whether,  irrespective  of the  government's  actual purpose,  the practice under review in \nfact conveys  a message  of endorsement or disapproval.  An affirmative  answer to  either question  should render the \nchallenged practice invalid.\"  See Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 690  (O'Connor J.,  concurring).\nPage  12 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *36 \na.  Purpose  of Defendants'  Restriction. \n\"While the  Court is normally  deferential to  a  State's  articulation of a secular purpose,  it is required that the \nstatement of such purpose be  sincere  and not a  sham.\" Edwards,  482  U.S.  at 586-87.  The  secular purpose requirement \n\"reminds  [*37]  government that when it acts it should do  so without endorsing  [or disapproving of]  a particular \nreligious belief or practice  ...  .\"  Wallace v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  75-76 (1985).  And  \"[t]he  eyes that look to purpose \nbelong to  an ‘objective  observer,’  one who takes  account of the traditional  external  signs that  show up in the text, \nlegislative history,  and implementation of the  statute  or comparable  official  act.\" McCreary County v.  A.C.L.U.,  545 \nU.S.  844,  862  (2005)  (internal  quotations  and citation omitted). \nIn this  case,  Defendants’  stated purpose  for their official  act of removing Plaintiff's banners was to prohibit  speech \nthat,  in their view,  conveyed a  \"particular sectarian viewpoint,\"  that being  a  \"Christian\"  viewpoint.  This purpose violates \nthe  Establishment Clause. \nb.  Effect of Defendants'  Restriction. \nThe  \"effect\"  of Defendants’  restriction,  irrespective  of Defendants’  alleged  \"purpose\"  for enforcing it,  conveys  a \nmessage  of disapproval  of religion (and the  Christian religion in particular) in violation of the  Establishment Clause.  See \nLynch,  465  U.S.  at 690  (O'Connor J.,  concurring)  (\"The  effect prong asks  [*38]  whether,  irrespective  of the \ngovernment's  actual purpose,  the practice under review in fact conveys  a message  of endorsement or disapproval.\").  As \nthe  Supreme  Court explained, when evaluating the  effect of government action under the Establishment Clause,  courts \nmust ascertain whether the  challenged action is  \"sufficiently likely to  be perceived\" as  a disapproval  of religion.  County \nof Allegheny,  492  U.S.  at 597 (citations  omitted)  (emphasis  added);  see also Santa Fe Indep.  Sch.  Dist.,  5330  U.S.  at 307, \nn.21  (\"[T]he  Establishment Clause  forbids  a State to hide behind the  application of formally neutral  criteria and remain \nstudiously oblivious to the  effects  of its  actions.\")  (internal  quotations  and citations  omitted).  The  clear effect of the \nSchool District's restriction 1s to  show  disapproval  of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. \n2.  Defendants'  Restriction  Fosters  an  Excessive  Entanglement. \nThe third prong  of the Lemon test asks whether the restriction at issue  excessively  entangles  government with \nreligion.  Lemon,  403  U.S.  at 612-13.  In  Widmar v.  Vincent,  the  Supreme  Court explained:  \"[T]he  [*39]  University \nwould risk greater ‘entanglement’  by  attempting to  enforce  its  exclusion of 'religious worship’  and ‘religious  speech.' \nInitially,  the University would need to  determine which words  and activities  fall within 'religious worship  and religious \nteaching.’  This  alone  could prove  an impossible task in an age where many and various beliefs meet the  constitutional \ndefinition of religion.\"  Widmar,  454  U.S.  at 272 n.11.  (anternal  quotations  and citations  omitted).  Accordingly, \nDefendants’  attempt to  exclude  speech expressing  a  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  viewpoint creates  \"excessive \nentanglement\"  in violation of the Establishment Clause. \nIV.  Defendants Violated  the California  Constitution. \nA.  State Free  Speech Claim. \nArticle  1,  section 2  of the  California Constitution generally provides broader protection for the  exercise  of free \nspeech rights than the  First Amendment.  See Robins v.  Pruneyard Shopping Ctr.,  23  Cal.3d 899  (1979).  However, \nfederal law 1s typically followed for free  speech claims  arising in a school  setting. \nIn California  Teachers Ass'n  v.  Governing Bd.  of San Diego  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  45  Cal.  App.4th  1383  (1996),  [*40] \nfor example,  the  California appellate  court was  asked to review  a school  district policy that prohibited all  employees \nfrom wearing political buttons  at worksites  during work hours.  The  court held that under the  California Constitution and \nthe  First Amendment as well the ban may be  enforced in instructional  settings but not in noninstructional  settings.  /d.  at \n1392-93.  In its  decision, the  court relied upon U.S.  Supreme  Court precedent and noted,  \"[W]e  find the  federal \nauthorities which discuss First Amendment principles  in the  fairly unique  context of school regulation of curricular\nPage  13 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *40 \nactivities  accurately weigh the  competing interests  of school  administrators,  teachers  and students.\" /d.  at 1391. \nImplicit in the  court's reliance  on federal  authority is the  conclusion that the  California Constitution would  similarly \nprohibit a speech restriction that was viewpoint based.  See San Leandro  Teachers Ass'n  v.  Governing Bd.  of the San \nLeandro  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  154 Cal_App.4th  866  (2007)  (stating that regulations restricting  speech in a nonpublic  forum \nmust be reasonable  and viewpoint neutral).  Thus,  for the reasons  stated with regard  [*41]  to Plaintiff's  First \nAmendment claim,  Defendants have  similarly violated article  1,  section 2  of the  California Constitution. \nB.  California  Establishment Clause and  No  Preference Clause Violations. \n1.  California Establishment Clause. \nThe  California courts generally  adopt the  federal Establishment Clause  analysis when considering  cases under the \nCalifornia Constitution's  similar provision.  See Paulson v.  Abdelnour,  145 Cal_App.4th  400,  420  (2006)  (\"The \nconstruction given by California courts to the  establishment clause  of article  I,  section 4,  is guided by  decisions  of the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court.\").  Accordingly,  the previous  analysis under the  federal Establishment Clause \ndemonstrates why the  challenged action at issue  also violates the  California Constitution. \n2.  California No  Preference  Clause. \nThe Ninth Circuit has  interpreted the  California No  Preference  Clause  \"to  stand for the proposition that not only \nmay  a government body not prefer one religion over another,  it may not appear to be  acting preferentially.\"  E/lis v.  City \nof La Mesa,  990 F.2d 1518,  1524  (9th  Cir.  1993)  (citation and quotations  omitted). \nIn this  [*42]  case,  it is  evident that Defendants’  restriction,  which  singled out  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\" \nspeech for disfavored treatment while permitting  speech conveying  other religious views,  violates  California's No \nPreference  Clause. \nV.  Plaintiff Is  Entitled  to  Nominal Damages  and Attorney Fees  and  Costs. \nIn addition to  declaratory  and injunctive relief,  Plaintiff is  entitled to nominal  damages  for the past loss  of his \nconstitutional rights  as  a matter of law.  See  Carey v.  Piphus,  435  U.S.  247,  266-67  (1978);  Floyd v.  Laws,  929 F.2d \n1390  (9th  Cir.  1991)  (holding that nominal  damages must be  awarded as  a matter of law upon finding  a constitutional \nviolation). \nAs the prevailing party,  Plaintiffis  also  entitled to  an award of his  attorney  fees  and costs pursuant to  42  U.S.C.  $ \n1988,  California Code  of Civil Procedure  §  1021.5,  and other applicable law.  See Hensley v.  Eckerhart,  461  U.S.  424, \n433,  435  (1983)  (\"Where  a plaintiff has  obtained excellent results,  his  attorney  should recover a fully  compensatory \nfee.\"). \nCONCLUSION \nSchools  are places  of learning,  and this  case presents  a great opportunity  [*43]  for the  students,  faculty,  and \nadministrators  of the  School District to  learn that when government officials violate  a person's  constitutional nghts,  they \nwill be held accountable.  See Hills,  329 F.3d at  1055  (\"We  agree with the  Seventh Circuit that the  desirable  approach 1s \nnot for  schools to throw up their hands because  of the possible misconception about endorsement of religion,  but that \ninstead it 1s  'far better to teach  students  about the  first amendment,  about the  difference between private  and public \naction,  about why we tolerate  divergent views.  The  school's proper response  is to  educate the  audience rather than \nsquelch the  speaker.'\")  (quoting Hedges v.  Wauconda  Cmty.  United Sch.  Dist.  No.  118,  9 F.3d 1295,  1299  (7th  Cir. \n1993)  (internal punctuation omitted)). \nAs this  court stated 1n its prior decision,  Public  schools play an important role  educating  and guiding our\nPage  14 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *43 \nyouth through the marketplace  of ideas  and instilling national values.  One method used by the Poway \nUnified School District to  accomplish this task is to permit  students to be  exposed to  a rich diversity  of \nbackgrounds  and opinions held by high school  faculty.  In this  [*44]  way,  the  school  district goes beyond \nthe  cramped view  of selecting  curriculum and hiring teacher  speech to  simply  deliver the  approved \ncontent of scholastic  orthodoxy.  By  opening  classroom walls to the non-disruptive  expression of all its \nteachers, the  district provides  students with a healthy exposure to the  diverse  ideas  and opinions  of its \nindividual teachers,  without necessarily  endorsing  or dictating adherence to the ideas  expressed.  By \nsquelching only Johnson's patriotic  expression,  the  school  district does  a disservice to the  students  of \nWestview High  School  and the  federal  and  state  constitutions  do not permit  such one-sided censorship. \n(Doc.  No.  25  at 22-23). \nFor the  foregoing reasons,  Plaintiff respectfully requests that this  court grant his motion for summary judgment as \nto  all  claims. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nTHOMAS  MORE LAW CENTER \nBy:  /s/ Robert J.

Plaintiff Bradley Johnson (hereinafter  \"Plaintiff\") is  a public  school teacher who has been teaching in Defendant \nPoway Unified  School District (hereinafter  \"School District\")  for more than 30 years.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  3  at Ex.  1). \n2.  Plaintiff is  a high  school math teacher in the  School District.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 3  at Ex.  1). \n3.  Plaintiff has taught math at Mt.  Carmel High School,  Rancho  Bernardo  High  School,  and Westview High \nSchool,  which are  all high  schools within the  School District.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 3  at Ex.  1). \n4.  Plaintiff presently teaches math at Westview High School  and has been doing  so  since 2003.  (Johnson Decl.  at P \n3  at Ex.  1). \n5.  Mr.  John Collins,  Deputy  Superintendent for the  School  District,  testified on behalf of the  School District \npursuant to Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  30(b)(6)  as to  certain matters  set forth in the  deposition notice.  (Collins  Dep.  at  12,  Dep.  Exs. \n1,  2  at Ex.  2). \n6.  Defendant William R.  Chiment,  Associate  Superintendent for the  School  District,  testified on behalf of the \nSchool District pursuant to  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  30(b)(6)  [*46]  as to  certain matters  set forth in the  deposition notice. \n(Chiment Dep.  at  16-17,  Dep.  Ex.  31  at Ex.  3). \n7.  Defendants Jeff Mangum,  Linda Vanderveen,  Andrew Patapow,  Todd Gutschow,  and Penny Ranftle were  at all \nrelevant times members  of the  Board of Education for the  School District.  (Compl.  at PP  8-12  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at\nPage  15 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *46 \n2  (Doc.  No.  26);  Collins  Dep.  at  16  at Ex.  2). \n8.  The  Board of Education for the  School District 1s responsible  for adopting the policies  of the  School District. \n(Compl.  at P  8  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26)). \n9.  The  Board of Education for the  School District approved of the  School  District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to \nremove his banners.  (Chiment Dep.  at  138  at Ex.  3). \n10.  Defendant Dr.  Donald A.  Phillips was  at all relevant times the  Superintendent of the  School District.  (Compl.  at \nP  13  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26);  Collins  Dep.  at  17  at Ex.  2). \n11.  As the  Superintendent of the  School District,  Defendant Phillips is partially responsible  for creating  and \nimplementing the policies  of the  School District.  (Compl.  at P  13  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26)). \n12.  Defendant Phillips  approved of the  School District's  decision  [*47]  to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners. \n(Chiment Dep.  at  137  at Ex.  3). \n13.  Defendant Chiment was  at all relevant times  Assistant/Associate  Superintendent of the  School District.  (Compl. \nat P  14  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26);  Chiment Dep.  at 20  at Ex.  3). \n14.  As  Assistant/Associate  Superintendent,  Defendant Chiment is partially responsible  for creating  and \nimplementing the policies  of the  School District.  (Compl.  at P  14  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26)). \n15.  Defendant Chiment approved of the  School  District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners. \n(Chiment Dep.  at 30-31,  130,  132,  137,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3). \n16.  Defendant Dawn Kastner was  at all relevant times the Principal  of Westview High  School,  which is  one  of the \nhigh  schools in the  School District.  (Compl.  at P  15  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26);  Kastner Dep.  at  10-12  at \nEx.  4). \n17.  As the  Principal  of Westview High School,  Defendant Kastner is partially responsible  for implementing the \npolicies  of the  School District.  (Compl.  at P  15  (Doc.  No.  17);  Answer at 2  (Doc.  No.  26)). \n18.  Defendant Kastner approved of the  School District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners.  [*48] \n(Kastner Dep.  at  101-02,  172  at Ex.  4). \n19.  Plaintiff has  a  strong reputation as  a math teacher in the  School  District;  he  continues to be  one  of the highest \nrated math teachers  at Westview High  School.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP 4,  36;  Chiment Dep.  at 24-25  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep. \nat 33  at Ex.  4). \n20.  For approximately 25  years,  Plaintiff had continuously  displayed on his  classroom walls various banners that \ncontained historical  and patriotic phrases.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  5,  17-21,  Ex.  B  at Ex.  1). \n21.  During these  25  years,  Plaintiff displayed his banners  during the relevant time periods  at Mt.  Carmel High \nSchool,  Rancho  Bernardo High School,  and Westview High  School.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP 3,  5  at Ex.  1). \n22.  Plaintiff had the banners made to  order by  a private  company  and purchased them with his personal  funds. \n(Johnson Decl.  at P  5  at Ex.  1). \n23.  Plaintiff's banners  do not belong to the  School District;  they  are his personal items.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  5,  33, \n34,  37  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at 34-36  at Ex.  3). \n24.  Teachers  in the  School  District are permitted to  display in their classrooms personal items that are not related to\nPage  16 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *48 \nthe  curriculum.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  9-16,  Exs.  A,  C  at  [*49]  Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 94  at Ex.  2). \n25.  The  classrooms in which Plaintiff's banners were  displayed over the years were  assigned to  Plaintiff;  they were \nhis  classrooms  for  \"homeroom\"  and academic  classes.  They were  also the  classrooms he used for non-curricular and \nextra-curricular activities.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  7  at Ex.  1). \n26.  Plaintiff's banners were not used as part of his math curriculum,  they were not part of any  aspect of his math \ncurriculum,  they were not used as part of any of his  extracurricular activities,  students were not studying Plaintiff's \nbanners  in his  classes,  and  students were not discussing Plaintiff's banners  in his  classes.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  16,  36  at \nEx.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at 93-95  at Ex.  3). \n27.  Plaintiff's banners were not part of the  curriculum.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  16,  36  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 94  at \nEx.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 93-95  at Ex.  3). \n28.  Prior to the  School District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners  in 2007,  neither the  School \nDistrict nor its  administrators made  any  complaints to  Plaintiff regarding his banners until  Defendant Kastner \ncomplained in the  Fall  of 2006.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  5,  33,  34,  37  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  [*50]  at 34-36  at Ex.  3). \n29.  Prior to the  School District's  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners  in 2007,  the  School  District did \nnot receive  any complaints  about Plaintiff's banners  from  students,  faculty, teachers,  parents,  or School  Board members \nuntil  Defendant Kastner complained in the  Fall  of 2006.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  5,  33,  34,  37  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at \n34-36  at Ex.  3). \n30.  During his  first two years  as  a probationary teacher,  Plaintiff was  evaluated 3  times  each year.  As  a tenured \nteacher,  Plaintiff is  evaluated twice  a year,  every other year by the  School District.  Typically, the  evaluation is \nperformed by  an assistant principal.  As part of the  evaluation, the  administrator observes  Plaintiff teaching in his \nclassroom and evaluates whether or not his teaching  and his  classroom comport with School District standards  and \npolicies.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  34  at Ex.  1). \n31.  None  of Plaintiff's  official  evaluations  over a 30  plus year period ever indicated that his banners were \nimpermissible,  nor did any  of Plaintiff's  evaluators  ever inform him that his banners were  impermissible  or that they \ndisrupted or detracted from Plaintiff's teaching  or the  students’  learning  [*51]  in any way.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  34  at Ex. \n1). \n32.  Plaintiff has  discretion and control  over the non-curricular messages he  displays  on his  classroom walls. \n(Johnson Decl.  at P  8  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 42-43,  57  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 64-65,  91,  134,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3). \n33.  No  other School District teacher is permitted to  display materials  on Plaintiff's  classroom walls without \nPlaintiff's permission.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  8  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 42-43,  57  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 64-65,  91,  134 \nat Ex.  3). \n34.  The  School  District does not direct the teachers’  non-curricular displays;  it 1s up to the individual teacher. \n(Johnson Decl.  at P  8  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at  134,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3). \n35.  Pursuant to  School District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  teachers  are permitted to  display in their classrooms \nand on their classroom walls various non-curricular messages  and other items that reflect the individual teacher's \npersonality,  opinions,  and values regarding a wide range  of interests  and subject matter.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  9,  11-15, \nEx.  A at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 38,  39,  41-42  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 57-58,  61-62,  82,  128-29,  273-74  (admitting,  \"In \na limited  [*52]  way we  open the walls  [to  expression by teachers]\");  Kastner Dep.  at 23-24,  67  at Ex.  4). \n36.  School  District teachers  are permitted to  display non-curricular items  in their classrooms that contain messages \nthat express the personal views,  interests,  or opinions  of the individual teacher regarding various patriotic,  political,\nPage  17 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.

Permissible  subject matter for non-curricular teacher displays in the  classrooms  includes,  among others,  the \nfollowing: \na.  Foundations  of our Nation; \nb.  Patriotic messages; \nc.  Inspirational messages; \nd.  Historical messages;  and \ne.  Slogans that are praiseworthy  of our Nation. \n(Johnson Decl.  at PP  11-15,  38  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 38-40,  56,  155-56  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 45,  84-85,  135-36, \n141,  215-17,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 45  at Ex.  4). \n38.  The  School  District permits teachers to  display non-curricular  [*53]  items that contain partial  quotes  from the \nDeclaration of Independence.  (Collins Dep.  at  148-50  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 216-17  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 45  at \nEx.  4). \n39.  The  School  District does not object to posters,  banners,  or other  such displays by teachers that express  certain \nnon-curricular messages regarding the  following  subject matter: \na.

In  1942,  Congress  enacted the Pledge  of Allegiance,  which was  amended in  1954 to  officially include the \nphrase  \"under God.\"  (Johnson Decl.  at P 27  at Ex.  1). \n83.  Students  in the  School  District recite the Pledge  of Allegiance  on a daily basis.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 27  at Ex.  1; \nCollins Dep.  at 28  at Ex.  2). \n84.  The preamble to the Declaration of Independence  states  as  follows:  \"We hold these truths to be  self-evident, \nthat all men are  created equal,  that they  are  endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights,  that among these \nare  Life,  Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"  The  Declaration of Independence 1s  our Nation's  founding document. \n(Johnson  [*69]  Decl.  at P 29  at Ex.  1). \n85.  \"God Bless  America\"  is  an American patriotic  song written by Irving Berlin in  1918  and later revised by him in \n1938.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  30  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at 29-30  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 40  at Ex.  3).\nPage 24 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *69 \n86.  \"God Bless  America\"  1s  a phrase that is  also  commonly used in  speeches by the President of the  United  States. \n(Johnson Decl.  at P  31  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at 30  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 40-41  at Ex.  3). \n87.  The  song  \"God Bless  America\"  is  often played at public  events,  including  at sporting  events,  such as the \nseventh inning  stretch at Yankee  Stadium,  since the terrorist attacks  of September  11,  2001.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 30  at \nEx.  1). \n88.  \"God  Shed His  Grace  on Thee\"  is  a verse  from  \"America the Beautiful,\"  an American patriotic  song that is \noften played at public  events.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 32  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 30  at Ex.  2). \n89.  During his  30  plus years  of teaching in the  School  District,  Plaintiff has had 7  different school principals, \nnumerous  school board members,  superintendents,  assistant superintendents,  over 4,000  students  and several thousand \nparents in his  classrooms where the banners were  displayed.  Prior to  January  [*70]  2007,  Plaintiff had not received one \ncomplaint from any  School District administrator,  parent,  or  student about the banners.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  33  at Ex.  1). \n90.  Plaintiffs banners never prohibited or interfered with his  ability to  educate the  students  in his math class. \n(Johnson Decl.  at P  36  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at  125  at Ex.  2). \n91.  Plaintiff's  long-standing practice  of displaying his banners  came to  an abrupt end when on or about January 23, \n2007,  Defendants  ordered him to remove the banners.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP 37,  38  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at 30,  130, \nDep.  Ex.  6,  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at  101-02,  172  at Ex.  4). \n92.  Defendants  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners because the  School  District believed that the banners were \npromoting a  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  viewpoint.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  37  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at 43-44  at Ex.  2; \nChiment Dep.  at  133  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 44-45,  101-02,  137  at Ex.  4). \n93.  Defendant Chiment,  on behalf of the  School District,  sent a letter to  Plaintiff regarding the  School District's \norder directing Plaintiff to remove his banners.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  37  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at 29,  30-31,  130,  Dep. \nEx.  6  at Ex.  3).  [*71] \n94.  In the letter,  which was  dated January 23,  2007,  Defendant Chiment claimed that Plaintiff's banners  conveyed \nan impermissible  \"sectarian viewpoint\"  and,  more  specifically,  \"a particular  sectarian viewpoint.\"  (Johnson Decl.  at P \n37  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at  133,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3). \n95.  The  \"sectarian viewpoint”  noted in the  letter was referring to  \"a particular religious viewpoint,”  which is the \nviewpoint of \"those religious groups who refer to  a supreme being  as  God,\"  such as  Christians.  (Chiment Dep.  at  133  at \nEx.  3). \n96.  Defendant Kastner believed that Plaintiff's banners were  impermissible because they  expressed a  \"Christian\" \nviewpoint.  (Kastner Dep.  at  101-02  at Ex.  4). \n97.  The  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners was  discussed and approved during  one  or more \nSuperintendent Cabinet meetings in which the members  of the  cabinet were present and all  approved of the  decision. \n(Collins  Dep.  at 58-59  at Ex.  2) \n98.  Defendants  did not inform Plaintiff that his banners  caused a material  disruption or  substantial  disorder in the \nschool  or that the banners  interfered with the  curriculum.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 39  at Ex.  1;  Chiment Dep.  at  130,  276, \nDep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3).  [*72] \n99.  At the time they  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners,  Defendants had no  evidence that Plaintiff's banners \ncaused any material  disruption or disorder in the  School District.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  35  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at 36-37, \n125  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 49-51,  276  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at  85-86  at Ex.  4).\nPage 25 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75414,  *72 \n100.  Defendants  singled out Plaintiff for disfavored treatment because  of the viewpoint expressed by his banners. \n(Johnson Decl.  at PP  37-39  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep.  at 43-44  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at  133,  278,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3; \nKastner Dep.  at 44-45,  101-02,  137  at Ex.  4). \n101.  Plaintiff wants to  display his banners in his  classroom;  however,  Defendants have prohibited him from doing \nso.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 40  at Ex.  1;  see  also  Chiment Dep.  at 30,  130,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 76  at Ex.  4). \n102.  Defendants have prohibited Plaintiff from displaying his banners  in his  classroom based on the viewpoint of \nPlaintiff's  speech.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP 37-39  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 43-44  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at  133,  278,  Dep. \nEx.  6  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 44-45,  101-02,  137  at Ex.  4). \n103.  Pursuant to  School  District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  [*73]  itis  entirely proper for Plaintiff to  display \non his  classroom walls non-curricular materials,  including posters  and banners,  \"about the  foundation of our nation,\" \nthat express patriotic  or historical messages,  or that express  inspirational messages.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  11-15,  38,  Ex. \nC  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 38-40,  56,  155-56  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 45,  84-85,  135-36,  141,  215-17,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at \nEx.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 45  at Ex.  4). \n104.  The  subject matter of Plaintiff's banners was permitted.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  11-15,  38  at Ex.  1;  Collins Dep. \nat 38-40,  56,  155-56  at Ex.  2;  Chiment Dep.  at 45,  84-85,  135-36,  141,  215-17,  Dep.  Ex.  6  at Ex.  3;  Kastner Dep.  at 45 \nat Ex.  4). \n105.  Defendants’  removal  of Plaintiff's banners was not curriculum related;  Plaintiff was teaching  and continues to \nteach his  assigned mathematics  curriculum.  (Johnson Decl.  at PP  16,  36  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 94  at Ex.  2;  Chiment \nDep.  at 93-95  at Ex.  3). \n106.  Had Plaintiff not complied with Defendants’  order to remove his banners,  Plaintiff would have been  subject to \nsome  form of disciplinary action for insubordination.  (Johnson Decl.  at P 41  at Ex.  1;  Collins  Dep.  at 59  at Ex.  2). \nRespectfully  [*74]  submitted, \nTHOMAS  MORE LAW CENTER \nBy:  /s/ Robert J.  Muise \nRobert J.

INTRODUCTION\nA math teacher at a public high school displayed two very large banners in his\nclassroom.  One banner had red, white, and blue stripes, with four phrases in large\nblock letters:  “IN GOD WE TRUST”; “ONE NATION UNDER GOD”; “GOD\nBLESS AMERICA”; and “GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE.”  The other banner\nread:  “All Men Are Created Equal They Are Endowed By Their CREATOR,” with\nthe word “CREATOR” in capital letters twice the size of the other words.\nIt is the unmistakable law in this Circuit that a school district does not violate\na teacher’s First Amendment rights by restricting the teacher from advocating religion\nto students during the school day.  Peloza v. Capistrano Unified School District,\n37 F.3d 517, 522 (1994).  This is because schools have the right to avoid a violation\nof the Establishment Clause.  Id.\n  The banners’ phrases are both historical and religious.  But the school district\nconcluded  that,  displayed  together,  the  religious  message  predominated  and\nadvocated.  The school district offered the teacher alternative items to display, with\nthe same phrases in context, such as the full text of the Declaration of Independence.\nThe teacher refused this option.  The school district instructed him to remove the\nbanners.  He complied, but sued the school and administrators for violation of his\nconstitutional rights.\n1\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 12 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nThe District Court held that the removal of the banners violated the teacher’s\nconstitutional rights.  For the first time, the Court also erroneously held that a school\nclassroom is a limited public forum, even during school hours.  Moreover, despite the\nholding in Peloza, the District Court denied the individuals’ defense of “qualified\nimmunity.”  The school defendants now appeal, and urge this Court to reverse and\nenter judgment in their favor.\nAlthough a school may be a marketplace of ideas, when teachers speak to\nstudents during paid teaching time, they are extensions of the school, and the school\nhas the right to restrict  their speech.  Here, since the banners were displayed\npermanently, the teacher was speaking to students as part of his official duties. Such\nspeech should not be afforded First Amendment protections.   Moreover, because the\nspeech crossed the line from patriotism to religious advocacy, the school had the right\nto restrict the speech.  The District Court erred in holding otherwise.\n2\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 13 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nII.   JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\nA. The District Court’s Jurisdiction.\nPlaintiff Johnson filed suit against the Poway Unified School District and\nindividual School Defendants1 (collectively, “School”), alleging claims under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983, and the California Constitution.  2 ER 091.  Accordingly, the District Court\nhad jurisdiction over the federal claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, and\nhad supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1367(a).  The District Court had jurisdiction to grant equitable relief and nominal\ndamages pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nB. The Ninth Circuit’s Jurisdiction.\nThe Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction to review the final judgment.  The District\nCourt filed an order under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 56, granting\nsummary judgment and disposing of all claims in Johnson’s favor.  1 ER 001.  A final\njudgment was entered in Johnson’s favor on February 26, 2010.  4 ER 704.  On\nMarch 25, 2010, the School Defendants timely filed a notice of appeal from the\n1  The individual School defendants consist of five elected school board\nmembers (Jeff Mangum, Linda Vanderveen, Andrew Patapow, Todd Gutschow, and\nPenny  Ranftle),  District  Superintendent  Dr.  Donald  A.  Phillips,  Associate\nSuperintendent for Personnel Support Services William R. Chiment, and Dawn\nKastner, principal of Westview High School, where Johnson teaches.  2 ER 93-94.\n3\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 14 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\njudgment.  4 ER 705.  Accordingly, this Court has appellate jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nIII.  ISSUES\n1. Did the District Court err by holding that the School violated Johnson’s\nFirst Amendment free speech rights?\nSubissue 1(a):  Is Johnson’s speech curricular, and thus the School’s\nspeech, which would not be afforded First Amendment protections?\nSubissue 1(b):  Is Johnson’s speech, made pursuant to his official duties\nas a government employee, precluded from First Amendment protection?\nSubissue 1(c):  Does the School’s right to be free from an Establishment\nClause violation outweigh Johnson’s free-speech right under the Ninth Circuit’s\nbalancing test for government employee speech?\nSubissue 1(d):  Did the District Court err in deciding that the School’s\nfear of an Establishment Clause violation was not justified?\n2. Did the District Court err in holding that the public school classroom\nused by a teacher during school hours was a limited public forum?\n4\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 15 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\n3. Did the District Court err by holding that the School violated the\nEstablishment Clause?\n4. Did the District Court err by holding that the School violated the Equal\nProtection Clause?\n5. Did the District Court err by holding that the School violated Johnson’s\nstate constitutional rights?\n6. Did the District Court err in denying the School’s motion for summary\njudgment while granting Johnson’s?\n7. Did  the  District  Court  err  by  denying  qualified  immunity  to  the\nindividual School Defendants?\nIV.   STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nA. The Pleadings.\nJohnson’s First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) is the operating complaint,\nalleging six claims against all Defendants:  (1) Violation of Freedom of Speech under\nthe First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (2) Violation of the Establishment\nClause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; (3) Violation of the Equal\nProtection  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  U.S.  Constitution;\n(4)  Violation  of  the  Freedom  of  Speech  under  the  California  Constitution;\n5\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 16 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\n(5)  Violation  of  the  No  Preference  Clause  of  the  California  Constitution;  and\n(6) Violation of the Establishment Clause of the California Constitution.  2 ER\n103-108.  The first three claims are brought under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.  2 ER\n103-105.\nThe FAC seeks the following remedies:  (a) a declaration that Defendants have\nviolated  federal  and  state  law;  (b)  an  injunction  to  prevent  Defendants  from\ndiscriminating against the display of classroom messages with a Judeo-Christian\nviewpoint; (c) nominal damages against the individual Defendants; and (d) attorney\nfees and costs.  2 ER 107. \nAfter the School Defendants unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the FAC under\nRule 12(b)(6) [4 ER 750-751], they answered and denied the material allegations.\n2  ER  109-112.    The  individual  Defendants  affirmatively  alleged  “qualified\nimmunity.”  2 ER 114.\nB. The Parties’ Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment Are Decided In\nJohnson’s Favor.\nFollowing discovery, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n2 ER 43; 3 ER 411.  The District Court heard oral arguments of the parties on the\ncross-motions.  1 ER 33-90; see also RT.  The District Court issued its decision on\n6\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 17 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nFebruary 25, 2010, granting Johnson’s motion, and denying Defendants’ motion.\n1 ER 001-002.  \nAs to the free speech claims under the First Amendment and California\nConstitution, the District Court first determined that the School had opened a “limited\npublic forum” by permitting teachers to decorate their own classrooms, and thus the\nSchool was required to maintain viewpoint neutrality regarding the items posted on\nthe classroom walls by teachers.  1 ER 014.  The Court then held that the Defendants\nhad discriminated against Johnson’s banners because of their Christian viewpoint.\n1 ER 016-018.  The Court rejected the Defendants’ argument that the banners, as\npresented, impermissibly violated the Establishment Clause.  1 ER 018-020.  The\nCourt also rejected Defendants’ arguments that Johnson was speaking as a public\nemployee and therefore his speech did not warrant First Amendment protections.\n1 ER 021.  The Court also found that the Ninth Circuit’s Pickering-style balancing\ntest advocated by Defendants did not aid Defendants’ position.  1 ER 021-025.\nFinally, the Court rejected the Defendants’ arguments that Johnson’s banners should\nbe  construed  as  curricular  speech,  and  therefore  not  protected  by  the  First\nAmendment.  1 ER 25-26.  The Court then concluded that Defendants violated the\nFirst Amendment and California Constitution.  1 ER 026.\n7\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 18 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nThe District Court also found in Johnson’s favor as to his Establishment Clause\nclaims under federal and state constitutions.  1 ER 029.  The District Court rejected\nDefendants’ argument that they were maintaining religious neutrality, finding that the\nDefendants permitted other displays concerning Buddhism, Hinduism, and anti-\nreligious speech to remain in classrooms.  1 ER 027-029.  With respect to Johnson’s\nEqual  Protection  claim  under  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  and  the  California\nConstitution’s “No Preference” clause, the Court found similarly.  1 ER 030-031. \nThe District Court also held that the individual Defendants were not entitled\nto defend on qualified immunity grounds.  1 ER 031.  To that end, the Court found\nthat the law in this area is “clearly established.”  1 ER 031.\nThe District Court awarded declaratory relief, issued an injunction permitting\nJohnson to immediately re-display his banners, ordered the individual Defendants to\npay nominal damages of ten dollars each, and determined that Johnson was entitled\nto recover his reasonable attorney fees and costs.  1 ER 032.\n8\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 19 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nV.   FACTS\nA. Johnson’s Banners Come To the Attention of School Principal, Dawn\nKastner.\nDefendant Dawn Kastner has been the Principal of Westview High School2\nsince July 1, 2006.  3 ER 378.  Early in Kastner’s tenure as Westview principal\n(sometime in Fall 2006), she was approached by a Westview teacher, Mr. Subbiah,\nwho asked Kastner why a fellow teacher, Bradley Johnson, was permitted to have\ncertain banners on display in Johnson’s classroom.  3 ER 504-505; 4 ER 587.\nKastner had also heard about these banners from a student and another teacher, and\nshe wondered what they were talking about.  3 ER 504-505; 4 ER 587. \nSome background on Mr. Johnson:  He teaches math (calculus, pre-calculus,\nand algebra) at Westview High School.  2 ER 093; 3 ER 490.  He has taught with the\nDistrict at various high schools for over 30 years.  2 ER 093; 3 ER 490-491.  Johnson\nis Christian, and has served as the faculty adviser for the Christian Club at Westview\nHS since becoming a teacher there in 2005.  2 ER 093; 3 ER 493.  He was previously\nan adviser at schools where he taught previously.  3 ER 492.\n2  Westview High School is operated by Defendant Poway Unified School\nDistrict.  4 ER 578.  \n9\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 20 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nKastner visited Johnson’s classroom at Westview and saw the two banners for\nthe first time.  3 ER 505; 4 ER 587.  Both banners in Johnson’s classroom were\nprominently displayed in a non-obstructive manner.  2 ER 097.  Kastner’s first\nthought about them was, “Wow, these are really big.”  3 ER 505.\nB. Johnson’s Banners.\nBoth  banners  are  each  seven  feet  wide  by  two  feet  tall.    2  ER  097;\n3 ER 453-457.  Both are located in places in Johnson’s classroom where students can\neasily read them while in their seats.  3 ER 456-457; 3 ER 536. \n   One banner has red, white, and blue stripes, and has four phrases in large block\nletters, one over another:  “IN GOD WE TRUST”; “ONE NATION UNDER GOD”;\n“GOD BLESS AMERICA”; and “GOD SHED HIS GRACE ON THEE.”  2 ER 097;\n3 ER 453-457.  The phrase “In God We Trust” is the official motto of the United\nStates.  2 ER 097.  The phrase “One Nation Under God” is part of the U.S. Pledge of\nAllegiance.  2 ER 098-099.  The phrase “God Bless America” refers to the song of\nthe same title written by Irving Berlin in the early 20th Century.  2 ER 099.  The\nphrase “God Shed His Grace On Thee” is a phrase from the song, “America the\nBeautiful.”  2 ER 099.  \nThe other banner reads, in large font:  “All Men Are Created Equal, They Are\nEndowed By Their CREATOR.”  3 ER 493-497.  This phrase is reference to the\n10\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 21 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\npreamble to the Declaration of Independence, which states, in part:  “We hold these\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their\nCreator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the\npursuit  of  Happiness.”    http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/\ndeclaration_transcript.html (accessed on July 7, 2010).  On the banner, the word\n“CREATOR”occupies its own line of text in “ALL CAPS” typeface about twice the\nsize of the other words on the banner, which are in “Initial Caps” typeface.  3 ER\n493-497.  This banner was surrounded by photographs of nature, and was displayed\non a separate wall from the “striped” banner.  4 ER 580.  Johnson testified that he\nconceived  and  designed  the  layout  of  this  particular  banner  so  that  the  word\n“CREATOR” would be larger, in order to highlight his belief that a supreme being\nprovided mankind with the rights described in the preamble to the Declaration of\nIndependence.  3 ER 495.  \nJohnson testified in his deposition that the purpose of the two banners is for\n“celebrat[ing] our national heritage,” “highlight[ing] the religious heritage and nature\nof our nation that we have as a foundation” and “espousing God as opposed to no\nGod . . . but not any particular God.”  3 ER 496; 497.\nJohnson has had the “striped” banner or one like it hanging in his classroom\nsince 1982.  3 ER 494-495.  Johnson originally had a banner made out of paper\n11\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 22 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nhanging in his classroom at Mount Carmel High School from 1982 through 1989.\n3 ER 495.  When Johnson transitioned to Rancho Bernardo High School in 1990, he\nhad a more permanent banner made.  3 ER 494-495.  As for the “CREATOR” banner,\nJohnson had it made in 1989, and displayed it thereafter in his classroom.  2 ER 097;\n3 ER 495.  Johnson moved to Westview High School in 2003.  3 ER 491.  The School\ncould not locate any administrators who could either confirm or deny that the banners\nhave been displayed in Johnson’s classroom for length of time Johnson says they\nhave been displayed, so the duration has gone undisputed.  Furthermore, there was\nno evidence presented that any administrator knew about the banners before Principal\nKastner brought them to the administrators’ attention during the 2006-2007 school\nyear.\nC. Kastner meets with Johnson.\nWhen Kastner saw the banners, she was concerned that the banners were very\nlarge, and inappropriately promoted a viewpoint advocating God, as the phrases were\npulled out of their original context.  3 ER 506.  So Kastner met with Johnson soon\nthereafter to discuss his banners.  Kastner told Johnson that taking the phrases\nconcerning God and putting them together in large print out of context was moving\naway from a patriotic comment to promotion of his religious beliefs that might make\nsome students uncomfortable.  3 ER 508.  During the discussion, Kastner suggested\n12\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 23 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nto Johnson that an Islamic student walking into the classroom may feel bad or like he\nor she would not fit in, but Johnson replied something to the effect of “sometimes\nthat’s necessary.”  3 ER 506.  Johnson told Kastner he felt strongly that he needed the\nsigns to stay up, that he had a right to have the banners up, and that he’d had them up\nfor a long time.  3 ER 508.  Kastner suggested to Johnson that he put the banner\nphrases “in context,” such as posting the entire Declaration of Independence.  3 ER\n506; 4 ER 589.  She also suggested reducing the scale of the banners to “something\nsmall around the desk area.”  3 ER 508.  Johnson did not agree.  3 ER 508.\nFollowing her meeting with Johnson, Kastner was unsure how to proceed, so\nshe contacted Melavel Robertson (Assistant Superintendent for Learning Support\nServices [3 ER 513]) for guidance on handling the situation.  3 ER 505.  Kastner’s\nsecretary took pictures of the banners and sent them to Robertson.  3 ER 505, 538.\nRobertson was concerned about the size of the banners and felt that students of\ndifferent faiths may feel uncomfortable with a banner that large.  3 ER 516-517. \nD. The School’s Policies, Procedures, and Practices re: Teacher Speech.\nRobertson suggested that Kastner speak with William Chiment, because he is\nthe School administrator who handles personnel concerns which might raise legal\nissues.  3 ER 515-516.  Chiment has been the School’s Associate Superintendent for\n13\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 24 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nPersonnel Support Services since 1999.  3 ER 471.  Chiment spoke with Kastner and\nreviewed photographs of the banners in Johnson’s classroom.  3 ER 472.\nAccording to Chiment, the School’s informal practice is to permit teachers to\ndecorate their classrooms  with personal items such as posters, flags, or banners, but\nthere are limitations that apply at the School’s discretion.  3 ER 473-475.  For\nexample, teachers’ personal items cannot violate the School’s anti-harassment policy.\n3 ER 474.  The School may also limit personal items by taking into consideration the\nsize of the item, the age appropriateness of the particular item for the students in the\nclassroom, the potential relationship to the curriculum, and the School’s mission.\n3 ER 476-477. \nThe  School  also  has  a  formal  written  policy  regarding  the  teaching  of\ncontroversial issues, which also governs the items that teachers may display on their\nclassroom walls.  3 ER 459, 478.  This formal policy, BP 3.11, provides, in part, that\nteachers must “exercise caution and discretion when deciding whether or not a\nparticular issue is suitable for study or discussion in any particular class.”  3 ER 459.\nThe policy also “requires teachers to ensure that all sides of a controversial issue are\nimpartially  presented  with  adequate  and  appropriate  factual  information”  and\n“[w]ithout promoting any partisan point of view.”  3 ER 459.  \n14\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 25 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nThis Policy has an attached Administrative Procedure, entitled AP 3.11.2,\ncontaining a section entitled the  “Responsibilities of Teachers.”  3 ER 465.  Those\nresponsibilities include “choos[ing] suitable and useful instructional materials,”\n“direct[ing] class discussion to cover all points of view,” distinguish[ing] between\nteaching and advocating, and refrain[ing] from using classroom teacher influence\nto promote partisan or sectarian viewpoints.”  3 ER 465.  This Administrative\nProcedure also has a section on the rights of students, and expressly gives students\nthe “right to form and express individual opinions on controversial issues without\njeopardizing relations with teachers or others.”  3 ER 466.  The Administrative\nProcedure also has a section entitled “The Selection of Issues.”  3 ER 466.  Within\nthat section, the Procedure states that in general, “the decision as to whether a\ncontroversial issue should become a matter of school study should be based upon” ten\nlisted criteria, including “1.  It must contribute significantly to the objectives of the\ncurriculum; . . . 6. The issue must involve alternate points of view which can be\nunderstood  and  defined  by  students;  7.  The  issue  must  be  one  about  which\ninformation is present and available so alternatives can be discussed and evaluated\non a factual and reasonable basis; . . . and 10. The issue must provide opportunity for\ncritical thinking for the development of tolerance and the understanding of conflicting\n15\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 26 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\npoints of view, at the same time that it contributes to the prescribed course of study\nand the general educational program of the school.”  3 ER 466.\nThe School’s position is that expression of religion within the District is\nproscribed by the law of the U.S. and State constitutions.  3 ER 481.  The School\ncontends that its policies and procedures are consistent with the U.S. and State\nconstitutions.    3  ER  482.    Even  non-curricular  items  are  part  of  the  learning\nenvironment and potentially advocating, and therefore such items are subject to this\nwritten policy.  3 ER 479-480.  Sometimes the School receives complaints from\nparents about only one side of an issue being taught, and the School works with\nprincipals to ensure that teachers are teaching both sides of an issue.  3 ER 514.\nE. Johnson Is Asked To Remove The Banners From His Classroom Walls.\nThe  issue  involving  Johnson’s  banners  was  discussed  by  the  School’s\ncabinet-level  administrators  after  it  came  to  their  attention.    3  ER  516-517.\nUltimately, Chiment made the decision to have Johnson remove his banners.  3 ER\n461.  This decision was agreed to by the Superintendent’s cabinet (consisting of\nSuperintendent and Defendant Donald Philips, the Deputy Superintendent, John\nCollins, Chiment, and the School’s assistant superintendents).  3 ER 519, 521-522.\nMr. Chiment asked Mr. Johnson by telephone to remove his banners on or\nabout  January  19,  2007.    3  ER  461,  472.    A  few  days  after  their  telephone\n16\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 27 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nconversation, Mr. Chiment sent a letter to Johnson to confirm the decision to have\nJohnson remove his banners, and to provide the legal basis for the decision in writing.\n3 ER 461; 472.  Referring to the two banners, the letter states that “[t]he prominent\ndisplay of these brief and narrow selections of text from documents and songs\nwithout the benefit of any context and of a motto, all which include the word ‘God’\nor ‘Creator’ has the effect of using your influence as a teacher to promote a sectarian\nviewpoint.”  3 ER 461.  The letter expressly notes the prohibitions in California\nEducation Code section 51511 and AR 3.11.2 as grounds for the School’s position.\nId.\nDuring his deposition, Chiment further explained that the reason Johnson was\nasked to remove his banners is because they violate District policy and procedures,\nwhich are consistent with the California and U.S. Constitutions and California\nEducation Code.  Specifically, Chiment stated that the banners advocated a particular\nreligious viewpoint over non-religion (atheism and agnosticism), and they also\nadvocated “God” over other religions that do not use the word “God” for a supreme\nbeing (such as Yahweh or Allah, for example).  3 ER 468; 482-484.  Although\nreligion is not a category of items prohibited from classroom walls, the School may\nprohibit religious viewpoints where the teacher appears to be teaching or advocating\na religious viewpoint separate from a curricular context.  3 ER 482.  Chiment was\n17\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 28 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nalso concerned that Johnson’s banners could be a distraction to a student who might\nbe upset with the particular theology of the banners.  3 ER 487.\nBut School administrators did not try to scrub Johnson’s classroom of religious\nreferences;  rather,  the  administrators  provided  Johnson  with  some  suggested\nalternative posters to post on his walls in lieu of his banners.  3 ER 461.  Mr. Chiment\neven asked his staff to go to a teacher supply store and buy items that would place the\nstatements of Mr. Johnson’s banners in context.  3 ER 485.  These suggested\nmaterials consisted of various posters depicting the entire text of the Declaration of\nIndependence, displays of coinage containing the words “In God We Trust” and the\ntext of the Pledge of Allegiance.  3 ER 461, and photographs of materials are at 3 ER\n528-530.  Principal Kastner took the materials out to Johnson’s classroom.  3 ER 510.\nJohnson received the materials, but declined to display materials in his classroom in\nlieu of his banners.  3 ER 498-499.\nF. Site Inspections During Discovery.\nAfter the decision to remove the banners was made, and after the lawsuit was\nfiled,  Johnson conducted a site inspection of the School District classrooms at Mount\nCarmel High, Rancho Bernardo High, Westview High, and Poway High.  2 ER 183.\nPhotographs of some of the items displayed in various classrooms during the site\ninspection were submitted to the District Court by Johnson in support of his motion\n18\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 29 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nfor summary judgment.  These items make various references to pop culture, history,\nart, science, and current events; Johnson claims some of these items advocate for no\nreligion or a particular religion.  2 ER 196-293. \nVI.  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENTS\nThe District Court erred by granting Johnson’s motion for summary judgment\nand denying Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.  Johnson has no free speech\nrights to display his banners in his classroom.  Johnson’s banners consist of speech,\nperpetually broadcast to students during the school day, and this speech is made\npursuant to Johnson’s duties as a teacher.  The banners, although tying into national\nand patriotic sentiment, have the primary message of advancing religion over non-\nreligion and Judeo-Christian religion over others.  The School therefore has the right\nto remove the banners to keep itself free from an Establishment Clause violation.  \nThe School did not violate the Establishment Clause by directing removal of\nthe banners, because the School’s purpose in doing so was to prevent its own\nviolation of the Establishment Clause, and this purpose is secular and compelling.\nThe School also did not violate Johnson’s equal protection rights.  Although other\nmaterial in other classrooms touch on religion, there is no evidence that this other\nmaterial advocates in favor of religion or non-religion.  Furthermore, there is no\n19\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 30 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nevidence that the School knew of the other material at the time the decision was made\nwith respect to Johnson’s banners, and so there was no intent to discriminate.  Also,\nthe state law claims should have been adjudicated in Defendants’ favor on the same\ngrounds as the federal claims.\nFinally, the District Court erred by finding that the individual Defendants were\nnot entitled to qualified immunity.  The current law is that teachers may not advocate\nreligion during the school day, and the individual Defendants had a reasonable belief\nthat Johnson’s banners did just that.  The District Court therefore erred in holding that\nwell-settled law utilizes a forum-analysis for teacher speech in the classroom and that\nDefendants discriminated on the basis of viewpoint.\nVII.  ARGUMENTS\nA. Standards of Review.\nEach of the issues presented in this appeal are reviewed de novo.  A district\ncourt’s grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  Travelers Cas. &\nSur. Co. of America v. Brennete, 551 F3d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir. 2009) (order granting);\nPadfield v. AIG Life Ins. Co., 290 F3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002) (order denying).\nThe appellate court evaluates each cross-motion for summary judgment separately,\n“giving  the  nonmoving  party  in  each  instance  the  benefit  of  all  reasonable\n20\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 31 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ninferences.”  American Civil Liberties Union of Nev. v. City of Las Vegas, 333 F3d\n1092, 1097 (9th Cir. 2003).  \nIssues arising under the First Amendment are reviewed de novo even when the\ninquiry is essentially factual.  Rosenbaum v. City & County of San Francisco,\n484 F.3d 1142, 1152 (9th Cir. 2007).  \nThe question of whether an employee is speaking as a private citizen or public\nemployee for purposes of the speech’s protected status is a mixed question of fact and\nlaw.  Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille School Dist. No. 84, 546 F.3d 1121, 1129 (9th Cir.\n2008).  However, the “ultimate constitutional significance of the facts as found” is a\nquestion of law.  Id. at 1129-30.  In this case, the material facts regarding Johnson’s\nduties as a teacher are undisputed, and therefore a de novo standard is appropriate.\nA defendant’s assertion of “qualified immunity” presents a legal question, and\nis also reviewed de novo.  Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994).  “A court\nengaging in review of a qualified immunity judgment should therefore use its full\nknowledge of its own and other relevant precedents.”  Id., internal quotation omitted.\nB. The School Did Not Violate Johnson’s First Amendment Rights.\nIt has long been held that a public school teacher has certain First Amendment\nrights of freedom of speech or expression.  Downs v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist.,\n228 F.3d 1003, 1009 (9th Cir.2000); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community\n21\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 32 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nSchool District, 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969) [“[i]t can hardly be argued that either\nstudents  or  teachers  shed  their  constitutional  rights  to  freedom  of  speech  or\nexpression at the schoolhouse gate.”] \n But the free speech rights of public employees, including teachers, are not\nunlimited.  Rather, these  rights have been restricted by the Supreme Court as\ndelineated under the tests established in Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563\n(1968) and Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138 (1983).  See  Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547\nU.S. 410, 418 (2006) (“Garcetti”).\n1. The Supreme Court’s holdings on public employee speech have been\ndistilled into a five-part test in the Ninth Circuit.\nThe Ninth Circuit has distilled the Supreme Court’s public employee speech\ncases claiming retaliation under section 1983 into a five-part test.  Eng v. Cooley,\n552 F.3d 1062, 1070 (9th Cir.2009).  The five-part Eng test is as follows:  (1) whether\nthe plaintiff spoke on a matter of public concern; (2) whether the plaintiff spoke as\na private citizen or public employee; (3) whether the plaintiff’s protected speech was\na substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action; (4) whether the\nstate had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from other\nmembers of the general public; and (5) whether the state would have taken the\nadverse employment action even absent the protected speech.  Id.\n22\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 33 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nOne recent Ninth Circuit case questioned the sequential order of these queries,\nbelieving that it would be more appropriate to first determine whether the employee\nwas speaking as a public or private citizen.  Huppert v. City of Pittsburg, 574 F.3d\n696, 702-703 (9th Cir. 2009).  However, the Huppert court concluded that it was\n“bound by [Ninth Circuit] precedent to follow the test set forth in Eng.”  Id. at p. 703.\nThe Huppert court then sequentially went through the questions “where applicable.”\nId. \nUnlike Eng or Huppert, however, this case is not a true “retaliation” case\nbecause the School did not discipline or reprimand Johnson. Since there was no\nadverse employment action, the third and fifth questions in Eng’s five-part test\ntherefore do not apply under the circumstances.3  Nevertheless, the remaining Eng\nfactors  are  meant  to  determine  a  public  employee’s  First  Amendment  rights.\nAccordingly, like the Huppert court, the School will sequentially address the Eng\nfactors, “where applicable,” in this non-retaliation case.  If Johnson fails to meet any\none factor, the inquiry ends.  Huppert, supra, 574 F.3d at 703.\nThe School also notes that the District Court agreed with Johnson’s argument\nthat a forum analysis would be more appropriate under the circumstances than use of\n3  Johnson has sought injunctive and declaratory relief (and attendant nominal\ndamages) as to whether he may display his banners, and does not claim damages due\nto an alleged adverse employment action.\n23\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 34 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nthe Pickering-Connick analysis, although the District Court noted that even under a\nPickering analysis, Johnson prevails.  1 ER 12-14, 21-23.  Therefore, after discussing\nthe Eng factors, the School will discuss why the trial court erred in applying a forum\ntest under the circumstances.\n2. Johnson’s Banners Are Curricular Speech and Therefore Not A\nMatter of Public Concern. \nThe first inquiry under Eng is whether Johnson’s banners touch on a matter of\npublic concern.  “Speech involves a matter of public concern when it fairly can be\nsaid to relate to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.”\nHuppert, 574 F.3d at 703 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  “But\nspeech that deals with individual personnel disputes and grievances and that would\nbe of no relevance to the public’s evaluation of the performance of governmental\nagencies’ is generally not of public concern.  [Citations.]  Whether an employee’s\nspeech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form,\nand context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.  [Citations.]”  Eng,\nsupra, 552 F.3d at 1070 (internal quotations omitted).\n24\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 35 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\na. The weight of the Circuits holds that curricular speech is not\nafforded First Amendment protections.\nHere, the District Court rejected the School’s contention that Johnson’s banners\nare part of the curriculum.  1 ER 025.  The School’s contention is important because\nthe weight of the other Circuits holds that a teacher speaking as part of the school’s\ncurriculum is not speaking on a matter of public concern, because the school sets the\ncurriculum (not the teacher).  See Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172,\n1176 (3rd Cir. 1990) [holding that teacher has no First Amendment right to employ\nclassroom teaching methodology of choice]; Boring v. Buncombe County Board of\nEducation, 136 F.3d 364 (4th Cir.1998) [holding that a teacher’s selection of a school\nplay constituted speech that did not implicate a matter of public concern, and thus\nwas not protected by the First Amendment];  Kirkland v. Northside Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n890 F.2d 794, 795 (5th Cir. 1989) [(teacher’s choice of supplemental reading list not\nconstitutionally-protected speech]; Webster v. New Lenox School Dist. No. 122,\n917 F.2d 1004 (7th Cir. 1990);  but see Cockrel v. Shelby County School District,\n270 F.3d 1036, 1052 (6th Cir. 2001) [holding that curriculum lessons about the\nenvironmental benefits of industrial hemp, where not approved by school, touched\non matters of public concern].  The Sixth Circuit is in the minority, but the value of\nthe Cockrel case is questionable, because the teacher in Cockrel was plainly carrying\n25\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 36 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nout public duties, thus implicating Garcetti.  Therefore, if the case were to be decided\ntoday, the teacher would not likely prevail.  Or, as put by the Seventh Circuit, Cockrel\nis “inconsistent with later authority and unpersuasive.”  Mayer v. Monroe County\nCommunity School Corp., 474 F.3d 477, 480 (7th Cir. 2007). \nb. The Downs case supports that teachers cannot teach what they\nwant to high school students.\nDefendants could locate no case in the Ninth Circuit holding that a teacher’s\ncurricular speech does not touch on a matter of public concern.  The case closest on\npoint, as acknowledged by the District Court [1 ER 025], is Downs v. Los Angeles\nUnified Sch. Dist., 228 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2000).  In Downs, the Ninth Circuit held\nthat where a school is a governmental speaker, a teacher has no First Amendment\nrights to present a message on campus contrary to the school’s viewpoint.  Id. at\n1012-1013.  There, as part of an “Education for Diversity” platform, a high school\nhad bulletin boards on school grounds where staff could post displays celebrating\ntolerance for gays and lesbians.  Id. at 1006.  The school’s administration had the\nultimate say on what could be posted on the bulletin boards.  Id.  A teacher opposed\nto gay rights created a competing bulletin board across the hall from his classroom,\ncontaining writings with religious, anti-gay sentiments.  Id. at 1006-1007.  The school\nordered the teacher’s bulletin board taken down, and the teacher sued for violation\n26\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 37 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nof his free speech and equal protection rights.  Id. at 1007-1008.  The Ninth Circuit\naffirmed the District Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint, holding that the\ngovernment, not the teacher, was the speaker, and where the government is speaking,\nit need not tolerate messages from its employees that are contrary to its viewpoint.\nId. at 1012-1012.\nFurthermore, pertinent to the discussion here concerning speech pertaining to\na school’s curriculum, the Downs court noted:  “Whether or not the bulletin boards\nby themselves may be characterized as part of the school district’s ‘curriculum’ is\nunimportant, because curriculum is only one outlet of a school district’s expression\nof its policy.  Nevertheless, our decision is consistent with cases holding that school\nteachers have no First Amendment right to influence curriculum as they so choose.\n[Citations].  Downs, supra 228 F.3d at 1016-1017.  Thus, by its own terms, the\nDowns case is consistent with the cases in the other Circuits cited above.  \nHere, the facts are not much different.  The School has the right to control what\nis placed in the classroom.  Even though the School permits teachers to decorate their\nown classrooms, there are limits as to what the School permits by policy and by\npractice.  So Johnson has the same rights as the teacher in Downs.  The fact that\nJohnson’s banners were displayed in a classroom rather than a hallway is of no\nmatter; the classroom is an extension of the school hallway as in Downs.  The\n27\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 38 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nclassroom is not Johnson’s personal space, it is the space where he interacts with\nstudents and parents.  Here, there is no dispute that Johnson was speaking to students\nthrough his banners.  He is speaking on behalf of the government when educating\nstudents, and therefore his viewpoint may be limited.\nc. The case most on point is a Fourth Circuit case holding that\nteacher postings in a classroom are curricular and not afforded\nFirst Amendment protections.\nA recent case from the Fourth Circuit is directly on point. Lee v. York County\nSch. Div., 484 F.3d 687 (4th Cir. 2007).  In Lee, a Spanish teacher posted what the\nschool deemed to be “overly religious” material on bulletin boards in his classroom.\nId. at 689.  These items included (1) a 2001 National Day of Prayer poster, featuring\nGeorge Washington kneeling in prayer; (2) a news article entitled “The God Gap”;\n(3) a news article entitled “White House Staffers Gather for Bible Study”; (4) a  news\narticle detailing the missionary activities of a former Virginia high school student\nwho had been killed when her plane was shot down in South America; and (5) a June\n2001 Peninsula Rescue Mission newsletter, highlighting the missionary work of that\nstudent.  Id. at 690.  The school principal removed the teacher’s items from his\nclassroom, believing them to be violative of the Establishment Clause.  Id. at\n28\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 39 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\n690-691.  The teacher sued for violation of his First Amendment rights.  The district\ncourt granted summary judgment in the school’s favor.  \nThe  Fourth  Circuit  affirmed,  holding  that  “under  the  Pickering-Connick\nbalancing standard Lee’s classroom postings do not constitute speech concerning a\npublic matter, because they were of a curricular nature.  Thus, Lee cannot use the\nFirst Amendment to justify his assertion that he is free to place his postings on the\nclassroom bulletin boards without oversight by the School Board.”  Id. at 694.  The\ncourt noted that the removed items were curricular, as opposed to the teacher’s own\nspeech because they “were constantly present for review by students in a compulsory\nclassroom setting.  As a general proposition, students and parents are likely to regard\na teacher’s in-class speech as approved and supported by the school, as compared to\na teacher’s out-of-class statements.”  Id. at 698.  Furthermore, the items were “plainly\n‘designed to impart particular knowledge’ to the students in Lee’s classroom,” even\nthough he taught Spanish, and the removed items had nothing to do with the Spanish\nlanguage.  Id. at 699.  Accordingly, the court found that “the dispute over Lee’s\npostings of the Removed Items is nothing more than an ordinary employment\ndispute,” and therefore affirmed the trial court.  Id. at 700; see also  Borden v. School\nDist. of Tp. of East Brunswick, 523 F.3d 153, 168-169 (3rd Cir. 2008) [a high school\n29\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 40 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ncoach praying silently with his interscholastic sports team has no First Amendment\nright to do so because his speech was not a matter of public concern]. \nBased upon the precedent of this Circuit, as well as the other Circuits, this\nCourt should hold that Johnson, as a teacher, does not have First Amendment rights\nto display his banners because they are curricular and therefore do not touch on a\nmatter of public concern.\n3. Johnson’s Banners Are Not Private Citizen Speech; Rather, He Is\nSpeaking Pursuant to his Official Duties or As a Public Employee.\nIf this Court finds in Johnson’s favor as to the first Eng factor, then second\nfactor is whether Johnson was speaking as a private citizen or a public employee. The\nDistrict Court impliedly found that Johnson was speaking as a private citizen, and\nerred by doing so.\na. Garcetti is applicable to high school teacher speech.\nThe Supreme Court recently addressed the “citizen” test in Garcetti, supra.  In\nthat case, an assistant district attorney wrote a memo to his supervisor recommending\ndismissal of a particular criminal case because the affidavit police used to obtain a\ncritical search warrant was inaccurate.  Garcetti, supra, 547 U.S. at 414.  The\nassistant D.A. was criticized by his supervisors for writing the memo and demoted.\n30\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 41 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nId. at 415.  He then sued his employer under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for retaliation in\nviolation of his First Amendment rights.  Id.\nThe Garcetti court upheld the use of the Pickering test to determine the public\nemployee’s free speech rights in the workplace.  Garcetti, 574 U.S. at 418.  \nUnder the traditional Pickering test, a public employee’s speech enjoys First\nAmendment protections if (1) the employee is speaking as citizen, (2) on a matter of\npublic concern, and (3) the public entity has no adequate justification for treating the\nemployee differently from any other member of the general public.  Garcetti v.\nCeballos, 547 U.S. 410, 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 1958 (2006).\nGarcetti, however, clarified the definition of “citizen” under the first prong of\nthe Pickering test.  Id. at 421.  The Supreme Court explained that the focus should not\nbe on the content of the speech, but on the role the speaker occupied when the speech\nwas made.  Id. at 421.  Using that standard, the Supreme Court held that “when public\nemployees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not\nspeaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes.”  Id.\nBut Garcetti expressly left open the question of whether this new gloss on the\nPickering test should be applied to the world of public academia, where there are\ndifferent free speech concerns, such as academic freedom.  Id. at 425.  To that end,\nthe majority opinion noted:  “There is some argument that expression related to\n31\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 42 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nacademic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional\ninterests that are not fully accounted for by this Court’s customary employee-speech\njurisprudence.  We need not, and for that reason do not, decide whether the analysis\nwe conduct today would apply in the same manner to a case involving speech related\nto scholarship or teaching.”  Id.  \nLike the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit also has not addressed whether\nGarcetti should apply to teaching (although Garcetti has been applied to one non-\nteacher school case, Posey v. Lake Pend Oreille School Dist. No. 84, 546 F.3d 1121,\n1129 (9th Cir. 2008), and in non-school public employee speech cases4).  Therefore,\nGarcetti’s application to a high school teacher’s speech in the classroom is a novel\nquestion in the Ninth Circuit.  If Garcetti applies to this case, and Johnson’s banners\nconsist of speech made pursuant to his official duties, as the School argues, then\nJohnson has no First Amendment right to display his banners, and the inquiry ends\nthere.\nThe Garcetti gloss on Pickering should  be applied to high school teachers, just\nas the Ninth Circuit has applied it in non-academia cases.  The Supreme Court’s\nconcerns raised in Garcetti are not present here.  Johnson is not writing for an\n4  See Eng, supra, 552 F.3d at 1071; Huppert, supra, 574 F.3d at 704; see also\nAnthoine v. North Central Counties Consortium, 605 F.3d 740, 745 (9th Cir. 2010).\n32\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 43 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nacademic journal or conducting research on behalf of an institution of higher learning.\nRather,  his  speech  is  directed  to  high  school  students  during  the  school  day.\nAcademic freedom is not at issue, particularly since Johnson teaches mathematics, a\ndiscipline completely unrelated to the banners’ messages.  Moreover, the Ninth\nCircuit has already held that a high school teacher speaks for the school when\nspeaking to students during the school day, even on issues unrelated to course\ncontent.  Peloza, supra, 37 F.3d at 522.  Peloza therefore stands for the same notion\nas Garcetti, i.e., that public employee speech made pursuant to official duties does\nnot receive First Amendment protections.\nb. The Seventh Circuit has applied Garcetti to teacher classroom\nspeech.\nThe School urges this Court to apply Garcetti to teacher-speech cases where\nthe teacher is speaking to students in the classroom setting, similar to the Seventh\nCircuit’s analysis in Mayer v. Monroe County Community School Corp., 474 F.3d\n477 (7th Cir. 2007).  Mayer held that a teacher, while teaching students, is engaged\nin her official duties, and thus not afforded First Amendment protections in line with\nGarcetti.  Id. at 480.  There, the elementary-school teacher took a certain political\nstance in her class concerning the Iraq war.  The teacher claimed that the school\ndistrict did not renew her teaching contract because of her stance.  Id. at 478.  The\n33\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 44 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ndistrict court dismissed the teacher’s complaint, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed,\nexplaining that teachers may not introduce their own views on a particular subject,\nbut “must stick to the prescribed curriculum—not only the prescribed subject matter,\nbut also the prescribed perspective on that subject matter.”  Id. at 479.  This is\nbecause “the school system does not ‘regulate’ teachers’ speech as much as it hires\nthat speech.  Expression is a teacher’s stock in trade, the commodity she sells to her\nemployer in exchange for a salary.”  Id.  Accordingly, the Court concluded that the\n“Constitution does not entitle teachers to present personal views to captive audiences\nagainst the instructions of elected officials.”  Id. at 480.\nc. Johnson’s speech was made pursuant to official duties, and\ntherefore is not afforded First Amendment protections.\nJohnson’s banners are both curricular in nature and speech made pursuant to\nhis duties as a teacher.  Had Johnson not been a teacher, then he would have no right\nto decorate a classroom.  Under the  School’s policies and practices, only teachers—\nnot others—have permission to display items in their respective classrooms, within\ncertain limits.  3 ER 473-474; 475.  The fact that Johnson’s banners were not used to\nteach math does not change the fact that were displayed to students, who could\nattribute the messages to the School.  Peloza, supra, 37 F.3d at 522.  There was no\nevidence that Poway permitted non-teachers (or students not under faculty direction)\n34\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 45 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nto display items on the walls in School classrooms.  In fact, under the California\nEducation Code, if Johnson was not an employee or parent/guardian of a student, he\nwould need permission just to visit a classroom during the school day.  Cal. Educ.\nCode, § 32211, subd. (a).\nMoreover, the students in Johnson’s class, who are obligated to be there, are\nsubject to viewing the very large banners throughout class time.  The banners are\ndesigned to impart information to the students.  By Johnson’s own admission, the\nphrases on the banners were chosen not just to promote the nation’s heritage, but also\nto espouse religion over non-religion.  3 ER 497.  So this case is not about a private\ncitizen speaking in the classroom, it is about a school employee speaking to students\nand others on public school grounds during school hours.  Accordingly, the District\nCourt erred by not holding that Johnson’s banners consist of speech made pursuant\nto his official duties, and thus not are not afforded First Amendment protections.\n4. Even if the speech is deemed to be by a private citizen, then the\nNinth Circuit’s Pickering-style balancing analysis weighs in the\nSchool’s favor.\nIf this Court finds that Johnson spoke as a private citizen, then the next\napplicable Eng factor is the fourth: whether the public employer’s decision in\n35\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 46 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nstopping the speech outweighs the employee’s right to make that speech.5  The\nanswer is “yes”:  Johnson’s interest in displaying banners advocating a connection\nbetween the United States and the Judeo-Christian religion is outweighed by the\nSchool’s interest in avoiding the impression of advocacy of religion in the public\nschools, especially when that apparent religious advocacy is directed pointedly at\nstudents during class time.\nThe Ninth Circuit has traditionally applied a “slight variation” of the Pickering\nbalancing test to cases involving religious speech made by a public employee in the\nworkplace,  which  balances  the  employee’s  right  to  speak  against  the  public\nemployer’s mission to be free of Establishment Clause entanglement.  Berry v.\nDepartment of Social Services, 447 F.3d 642, 650 (9th Cir. 2006).  This test was used\nin Eng with respect to the fourth factor in that case.  Eng, supra, 552 F.3d at 1071.\na. Peloza permits schools to restrict religious speech by teachers\nto students.\nThe Ninth Circuit applied this test in Peloza v. Capistrano Unified Sch. Dist.,\n37 F.3d 517 (9th Cir.1994).  Berry, supra, 447 F.3d at 650 [noting that Peloza applied\n5  The third Eng factor is whether the school took an adverse employment\naction against the employee because of the speech.  That element does not apply,\nbecause the School did not discipline nor reprimand Johnson.  But the School did\ninstruct Johnson to remove the banners.\n36\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 47 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nthis balancing test].  In Peloza, the teacher wanted to teach creationism, and wanted\nto refer to the theory of evolution as a religion.  The school did not agree.  Ultimately,\nthe Court ruled that the “school district’s interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause\nviolation trumps Peloza’s right to free speech.”  Peloza at 522.  In balancing the\nrespective parties’ rights, the Peloza court recognized that, as a teacher in a public\nschool, Peloza had a right to free speech, stating:  “The school district’s restriction\non Peloza’s ability to talk with students about religion during the school day is a\nrestriction on his right of free speech.”  Id.  But the court made it very clear that a\nteacher may not discuss religion during instructional time in a public school:  “While\nat the high school, whether he is in the classroom or outside of it during contract time,\nPeloza is not just any ordinary citizen.  He is a teacher.  He is one of those especially\nrespected persons chosen to teach in the high school’s classroom.  He is clothed with\nthe mantle of one who imparts knowledge and wisdom.  His expressions of opinion\nare all the more believable because he is a teacher.  The likelihood of high school\nstudents equating his views with those of the school is substantial.”  Id.  The Court\nheld that permitting Peloza to discuss religion during school time would violate the\nEstablishment Clause:  “To permit him to discuss his religious beliefs with students\nduring school time on school grounds would violate the Establishment Clause of the\nFirst Amendment.  Such speech would not have a secular purpose, would have the\n37\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 48 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nprimary effect of advancing religion, and would entangle the school with religion. In\nsum, it would flunk all three parts of the test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman,\n[citation omitted].”  Id.  Similarly, the School contends that Johnson’s banners\nadvocate his view of religion during the school day.  Under Peloza, the balancing\nweighs in the School’s favor.\nb. The Berry and Tucker cases reaffirmed use of the Pickering-\nstyle test for religious speech cases.\nThe Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the use of this balancing test in a case involving\nreligious speech of a public employee in Berry, supra.  There, a county employee’s\nprimary  duties  were  to  assist  unemployed  and  underemployed  clients  in  their\ntransition out of welfare programs.  These duties frequently required the employee to\nconduct client interviews.  The department told the employee that he could not talk\nabout religion with clients and the agencies the employees contacted, but that he was\npermitted to talk about religion with his colleagues.  Berry, 447 F.3d at 646.  The\nemployee also displayed a Spanish-language Bible on his desk, and hung a sign that\nread “Happy Birthday Jesus” on the wall of his cubicle.  Id. at 647.  The department\ntold him to remove the Bible from view of clients, and to remove the word “Jesus”\nfrom the sign on his cubicle.  Id.  The employee sued, claiming, in part, that his\n38\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 49 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nspeech rights under the First Amendment were violated.  Id. at 645.  The district court\ngranted summary judgment for the county department, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\nThe Berry court balanced the Department’s fear of an Establishment Clause\nviolation against the employee’s right to free speech.  “The Department . . . must run\nthe gauntlet of either being sued for not respecting an employee’s rights under the\nFree Exercise and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment or being sued for\nviolating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment by appearing to endorse\nits employee’s religious expression.  The Pickering balancing test recognizes these\nimportant, but sometimes competing, concerns and allows a public employer to\nnavigate a safe course.”  Berry at 649-650.  The Court decided that the employee\ncould not display items to clients or speak to clients about religion, because the\nemployer’s interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation (since the material\ncould be viewed by members of the public) outweighed the employee’s right to free\nspeech.  “Applying the Pickering test to the Department’s restriction on Mr. Berry’s\nspeech with clients, we determine that the restriction is reasonable.  The Supreme\nCourt has reiterated that avoiding an Establishment Clause violation may be a\ncompelling state interest.”  Berry, at 650.\nAnother case using this balancing test is Tucker v. State of Cal. Dept. of Educ.,\n97 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir. 1996).  In Tucker, a public employee challenged a state\n39\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 50 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ndepartment’s broad ban on two categories of speech:  (1) religious advocacy by the\nemployee, written or oral, in the workplace; and (2) storage or display of religious\nartifacts, information and materials.  Tucker, supra, 97 F.3d at 1208-1209.  Using the\nPickering-style balancing test, the court first held that the employer could not prevent\nthe employee from speaking with other employees to advocate religion.  Id. at 1213.\nHowever, in reaching this conclusion the court specifically stated that the plaintiff\nwas to be treated differently from school teachers because the plaintiff was not\ninteracting with the public, where the public might construe a teacher’s speech to be\nthe government’s speech:  “A teacher appears to speak for the state when he or she\nteaches; therefore, the department may permissibly restrict such religious advocacy.\n[Citations].  Similarly, the department may, at least under some circumstances,\nprevent at least some of its employees from advocating religion in the course of\nmaking public speeches on education.”  Id.\nThe Tucker court next addressed whether the state’s broad ban on display of\nreligious items violated the First Amendment.  The court noted that the state had a\nstrong argument that permitting posting of religious material in the interior space of\na building may give the appearance of government endorsement of that material.  Id.\nat 1215.  To that end, the court stated that “there is a legitimate state interest in\npreventing displays of religious objects that might suggest state endorsement of\n40\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 51 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nreligion.  The state has a legitimate interest, for example, in preventing the posting\nof Crosses or Stars of David in the main hallways, by the elevators, or in the lobbies,\nand in other locations throughout its buildings.  Such a symbol could give the\nimpression of impermissible government support for religion.”  Id. at 1216.  The\nTucker court found a problem with the broad ban instituted by the state, however,\nbecause members of the public had no access to the plaintiff’s office, and there were\nlesser means to control the speech instead of a flat ban of religious displays.  Id. at\n1215-1216.\n  c. The common thread through Peloza, Berry, and Tucker is that\nwhere members of the public have access to the employee’s\nreligious speech, the public employer may restrict it.\nThe only clear distinction between Tucker — were the employee was permitted\nto speak about religion and display religious materials — and Peloza and Berry —\nwhere the employee was not permitted to speak about religion or display religious\nmaterials — is in the identity of the people to whom the religious advocacy was\ndirected.  In Tucker, the employee did not have direct contact with clients; his speech\nand display were directed only to other employees.  Tucker at 1213.  In Berry, the\nemployee was speaking and displaying his religious material directly to clients of the\nemployer.  Berry at  650-651.  Similarly, in Peloza, the teacher was prohibited from\n41\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 52 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nspeaking directly to students and from teaching in class about religion.  Peloza at 522.\nSo, if Johnson’s banners are directed to members of the public, including students,\nthen the School’s legitimate concerns that Johnson’s banners may be viewed by the\npublic/students  as  the  government  advocating  religion  in  violation  of  the\nEstablishment Clause.\nd. Johnson’s banners were directed toward students. \nIn the case at bar, the banners were directed at students and were not directed\nto teachers in other classrooms, nor to the administrators in their respective offices\nand sites.  The banners, however, were clearly visible to any student attending\nJohnson’s class.  There is no evidence that the banners were seen by a School\nadministrator until brought to the attention of Principal Kastner by a teacher at\nWestview High.\nAnd students are required to come to class.  They can be arrested if truant.  Cal\nEduc. Code, § 48264.  Students have diverse beliefs.  They may be Christians or\nJews, who have beliefs consistent with the banners, but some undoubtedly are\nMuslim, Buddhist, Scientologist, or Atheist, and might be troubled by those banners.\nTheir rights are not inferior to Johnson’s rights.  Their rights should be given great\nconsideration in this balancing equation.\n42\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 53 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ne. The banners advocated religious belief.  \nThese banners advocated a religious belief.  The District Court erred in holding\notherwise.  It is no secret what Johnson was doing:  He selected from among very few\nnational historical documents only those phrases that referenced God, because he\nintended to advocate the belief that the United States is a Christian nation.  As\nAssociate Superintendent Chiment aptly described to Johnson: “The prominent\ndisplay of these brief and narrow selections of text from documents and songs\nwithout the benefit of any context and of a motto, and which all include the word\n‘God’ or ‘Creator,’ has the effect of using your influence as a teacher to promote a\nsectarian viewpoint.  3 ER 461.\nThe Ninth Circuit has instructed on the importance of  “context” in the analysis\nof religious statement.  Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School Dist., 597 F.3d 1007,\n1019 (9th  Cir. 2010) (“Rio Linda”).  The context of these phrases is patriotic and\nreligious, but with the purpose of advocating the religious concept.  There is no other\ncontext.  Around one banner, Johnson has placed pictures of landscapes, presumably\nto show that God has shed his grace on the United States.  That is a religious context.\nJohnson clearly intended to connect the United States with God, for the purpose of\nadvocating the idea that the United States believes in God; Johnson believes in God;\nso the students should believe in God, too.  That is pure advocacy of religion. \n43\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 54 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nf. The display of Johnson’s banners violates the Establishment\nClause.\nThe school is correct to fear an Establishment Clause violation if Johnson is\npermitted  to  display  his  banners,  as  they  violate  the  both  the  “Lemon”  and\n“endorsement” tests.  \nThe Lemon test states that the speech (1) must have a secular purpose; (2) its\nprincipal and primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion;\nand (3) it must not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.  Lemon\nv. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971).  Johnson’s banners violate all three\nprongs.  First, the banners do not have a secular purpose.  By Johnson’s own\nadmission, the phrases on the banners were chosen not just to promote the nation’s\nheritage, but also to espouse religion over non-religion.  3 ER 496-497.  This is also\nevidenced by the use of the word CREATOR on the “Declaration” banner.  The word\n“CREATOR” occupies its own line, is about twice as big as the other words on the\nbanner, and is the only word in ALL CAPS, as if shouting to be noticed.  Johnson\nsaid that the reason the word CREATOR is bigger is because he wanted to emphasize\na supreme being’s role in giving man his rights.  3 ER 495.  This emphasis does not\nhave a secular purpose.\n44\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 55 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nSecond, the principal and primary effect of the banners is to advance religion.\nEach of the five phrases, standing alone, might not run afoul of the First Amendment\ndue to the historical implications of the phrases.  See, e.g., Aronow v. United States,\n432 F.2d 242 (9th Cir. 1970) [national motto “In God We Trust” on currency does not\nviolate Establishment Clause], but see Rio Linda, 597 F.3d at 1019, fn. 9 [phrase\n“One Nation Under God,” standing alone, might violate the Establishment clause].\nWhen all of the phrases are combined, however, they accumulatively de-emphasize\nthe patriotic aspects of the speech, and instead emphasize the religious aspects of the\nspeech.  The secondary religious meaning behind each individual phrase becomes the\nprimary meaning when strung together.  In short, when viewed in their totality, the\nbanners’ combined message is less about Nation, and more about God.  Thus, the\nprimary effect is to advocate in favor of Christian religion.\nFinally, Johnson’s banners foster excessive government entanglement with\nreligion, because he is a teacher speaking to students:  “A teacher appears to speak\nfor the state when he or she teaches; therefore, the department may permissibly\nrestrict such religious advocacy.”  Tucker, supra, 97 F.3d at 1213 (9th Cir. 1996),\nciting Peloza, 37 F.3d at 522.\nThe banners’ display also runs afoul of the “endorsement” test, which was first\narticulated by Justice O’Connor, and later adopted in County of Allegheny v. ACLU,\n45\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 56 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\n492 U.S. 573, 578-79 (1989).  The endorsement test asks “whether the challenged\ngovernmental action has the purpose or effect of endorsing, favoring, or promoting\nreligion, particularly if it has the effect of endorsing one religion over another.”  Id. at\n593-94.  Justice O’Connor was concerned with government action that made some\npeople feel like outsiders.  “Endorsement sends a message to nonadherents that they\nare outsiders, not full members of the political community.”  Lynch v. Donnelly,\n465 U.S. 668, 688 (1984).\nHere, the banners’ effect on students was the Principal’s primary concern.  She\nwas concerned because the phrases were “taken out of context and very large, they\nbecame a promotion of a personal viewpoint.”  3 ER 385.  She was concerned that\nsome students may not share Johnson’s viewpoint: “I asked him, ‘If an Islamic\nstudent walks into your classroom and sees all of these phrases, they may feel” . . .\n“If a student walks in and sees this, they man feel like, Wow, I’m not welcome, or,\nI’m not gonna fit in this classroom.  And they may feel bad.”  3 ER 385.  The\nPrincipal’s  concern  is  exactly  parallel  to  Justice  O’Connor’s  concern:  that  the\ngovernment’s message communicated endorsement of religion and exclusion of\nnonadherents.  The School had the right to direct removal of the banners. \n \n46\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 57 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ng. Johnson’s banners also violate the School’s policies.\nAn additional reason supporting the School’s removal of the banners is that the\ndisplay of the banners violates School Policy and Procedure.  Under AP 3.11.2,\nteachers are expected “to refrain from using classroom teacher influence to promote\npartisan or sectarian viewpoints.”  3 ER 465.  Students also have “the right to form\nand express individual opinions on controversial issues without jeopardizing relations\nwith teachers or others” under the policies.  3 ER 466.  The District is certainly within\nits rights to remove the banners to ensure that the students’ rights to have an opinion\non religion does not jeopardize their class standing should the students wish to make\ntheir opinions known. \n5. District Court erred by applying a forum-test.\nThe District Court found that a forum analysis applied to Johnson’s display of\nthe banners.  1 ER 12-14.  The District Court erred primarily because this “is not a\ncase involving the risk that a private individual’s private speech might simply ‘bear\nthe  imprimatur’  of  the  school  or  be  perceived  by  outside  individuals  as\n‘school-sponsored.’”  Downs, supra, 228 F.3d at 1012.  And  Downs noted that where\nthe school itself is the speaker, the analysis is not controlled by Hazelwood Sch. Dist.\nv. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 (1988) or Planned Parenthood v. Clark County Sch. Dist.,\n47\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 58 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\n941 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1991).  Here, Johnson is acting on behalf of the school,\nconsistent with the analysis in Peloza and Mayer.\nMoreover, the School did not intend to create a limited public forum.  To create\nsuch a forum, the government must make an affirmative choice to open up its\nproperty for use as a public forum.  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,\nInc., 473 U.S. 788, 802-803 (1985).  “The government does not create a public forum\nby inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a\nnon-traditional forum for public discourse.”  U.S. v. American Library Ass’n, Inc.,\n539 U.S. 194, 206 (2003).  The school’s policies show that teachers may decorate\ntheir classroom, but that the School has the ultimate say.\nAdditionally, the Ninth Circuit has been very clear that a forum test does not\napply to cases involving a public employee’s religious speech in the workplace.  For\nexample, in Tucker, the court stated:  “The interior walls of the offices of the Child\nNutrition and Food Distribution Division are neither a public forum, nor a limited\npurpose public forum.”  Tucker, supra, 97 F.3d at 1214.  This Circuit has also flatly\nrejected other tests.  Berry, supra, 447 F.3d at 649-650 [“we adhere to our practice\nof applying a balancing test when confronted with constitutional challenges to\nrestrictions on public employee speech in the workplace” and “[T]he Pickering\n48\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 59 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nbalancing approach applies regardless of the reason an employee believes his or her\nspeech is constitutionally protected.”].  \nNor does Tinker control.  Tinker involved the rights of students to speak on\nschool grounds, not the rights of teachers.  Moreover, “Tinker did not alter the test\nthat the Supreme Court established to evaluate the speech of a public employee” in\nPickering and Connick.  See Borden, supra, 523 F.3d at 168, fn. 8.\nFor all of the above reasons, the School did not violate Johnson’s free speech\nrights under the First Amendment by directing him to remove the banners.\nC. Teacher  Speech  Protections  Under  the  California  Constitution  Are\nTreated the Same as the Federal Constitution, So There Was No Violation.\nJohnson’s  Fourth  claim  is  his  free  speech  claim  under  the  California\nConstitution.    “Article  1,  section  2  of  the  California  Constitution  provides\nindependent  protection  for  free  speech  which  in  certain  contexts  exceeds  the\nprotection provided by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\nCalifornia Teachers Assn. v. Governing Board, 45 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391 (1996).\nBut in the context of the classroom activities of teachers, the California constitutional\nprotections are identical to the federal protections:  “We find the federal authorities\nwhich discuss First Amendment principles in the fairly unique context of school\nregulation of curricular activities accurately weigh the competing interests of school\n49\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 60 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nadministrators, teachers and students.”  Id.  Moreover, the court in California\nTeachers Assn. held that with respect to teacher speech inside the classroom, “school\nauthorities retain the power to dissociate themselves from political controversy by\nprohibiting their employees from engaging in political advocacy in instructional\nsettings.”  Id. at 1391.  Accordingly, the District Court erred by not granting summary\njudgment of the Fourth claim in the School’s favor.\nD. The School Did Not Violate the Establishment Clauses of Either the U.S.\nor California Constitution.\nThe District Court held that the School violated the Establishment Clause of\nboth the United States and California constitutions by allegedly disapproving of\nJohnson’s religion while advocating other religions and non-religion.  1 ER 26-29.\nThe District Court erred in its holding because the School was doing nothing of the\nsort, and violated neither the Lemon test6 nor the endorsement test, both discussed\nearlier.  The School also did not violate the “coercion” test, which states that “at a\nminimum, the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to\nsupport or participate in religion or its exercise, or otherwise to act in a way which\n6  The Lemon test is used by the California appellate courts in analyzing\nEstablishment Clause claims under state law.  See Catholic Charities of Sacramento,\nInc. v. Superior Ct., 32 Cal.4th 527, 546 (Cal. 2004) (cert. denied 125 S.Ct. 53). \n50\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 61 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nestablishes a state religion or religious faith, or tends to do so.”  Lee v. Weisman, 505\nU.S. 577, 587 (1992).  None of the actions of the School coerced students to\nparticipate in religion or non-religion.\n1. The School provided alternative materials containing the same\nlanguage, but in context.\nContrary to the District Court’s view, the School was not trying to eradicate the\nnotion of God or religion from its classroom.  Rather, the opposite is true.  Johnson\nwas provided materials by the School which contained some of the same phrases on\nhis banner, but in their historical national context.  3 ER 461, 528-530.  Johnson had\nthe option of displaying these items in lieu of his banners, but he chose not to because\nhe did not “want to show agreement with the [school] district.”  3 ER 498-499.  These\nitems,  if  posted  in  their  context,  would  alleviate  any  Establishment  Clause\nentanglement.  The District Court should not have overlooked this evidence in its\nanalysis.\n2. The District Court failed to consider the size and context of items\ndisplayed in other classrooms.\nThe District Court discussed some displays in other classrooms which the\nDistrict Court held showed that the School was advocating other religions/non-\nreligions over Johnson’s religion.  These items included the so-called “Tibetan Prayer\n51\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 62 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nFlags,” a John Lennon poster, a poster of the Dalai Lama, and a poster of Mahatma\nGandhi.    Those  items  were  located  during  discovery  in  this  case.    Johnson’s\ndeclaration says that they were photographed in April 2009 during court-authorized\ninspection of classrooms.  2 ER 179, 182.  There is no evidence that any of the\nDefendants knew about any of those items before that inspection and very little\nevidence of the context of the displays, with the exception of the Tibetan display.\nThe District Court’s ruling fails to analyze the purpose for which these items\nwere displayed, e.g., whether a particular display was a student project or teacher\ndecoration, and whether the classroom was for science, history, or other subject.  The\nabsence of that analysis was error. \nSome of these items may have been displayed in a history class, with proper\nrelevance and context.  Certainly any study of modern Asian history would contain\nsome reference to the Dalai Lama.  Some of those items might have been put up by\nstudents in connection to some project.  There is simply no evidence to show that\ncontext.  Moreover, there is not any evidence that any individual Defendant knew\nabout those items at all.  The Defendants certainly cannot be held to have intended\nto discriminate on the basis of religion or speech if they did not know the content of\nthose displays. \n52\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 63 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nIn its written decision, the District Court printed the lyrics of the song,\n“Imagine”  (taken  from  a  John  Lennon  poster)  in  the  same-sized  font  as  the\ndescription of Johnson’s banners.  But in reality, the type size was very different.  2\nER 202.  A student would need to move very close to the poster to even be able to\nread the lyrics from that poster.  Yet no student with normal vision seated at any desk\nin that classroom would fail to read the text of Johnson’s banners from their seat.  The\ndifference in the size goes directly to the issue of advocacy.   Moreover, in context,\nthe song is an anti-war song, not an anti-religion song.  Lennon was suggesting that\nwar is often caused by disputes over countries and religions. \nSimilarly, the District Court analyzed some flags that were called “Tibetan\nPrayer Flags” as if there was some way for a student in the room to know that those\nflags were Tibetan, or about prayer, or anything else.  The teacher called them\n“Tibetan Prayer Flags” in her deposition.  3 ER 405.  She said the purpose for the\ndisplay was related to teaching about fossils on the top of Mount Everest, because\npeople climbing Mount Everest place such flags at the top.  3 ER405-406.  They were\nnot displayed to advocate the Buddhist religion.  She said she was opposed to the\nadvocacy of religion in the classroom.  3 ER 409.  Moreover, the writing on them was\nwritten in Sanskrit, a language that few people are able to read, and no one was able\nto translate.  3 ER 405-406.  None of those flags are identifiably “Tibetan,” or\n53\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 64 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nreligious, without external explanation.  See, 3 ER 405.  On one of those many flags,\nnear the top of the flag, was depicted a small seated figure, which appears to be\nBuddha, surrounded with writing in Sanskrit.  2 ER 205.  There is nothing else\nobservable about these flags that would identify them as Buddhist, and nothing that\ncould possibly proselytize Buddhism as a religion.  Standing alone, they do not\nadvocate anything.  In context, they are nothing more than decoration, but they can\nbe used to discuss “the accomplishment of an amazing goal.”  3 ER 406, p. 89:9. \nThe  District  Court  apparently  concluded  that  the  display  of  a  poster  of\nMahatma Gandhi was advocacy of the Hindu religion.  1 ER 5, 15, 27.  But Gandhi\nis better known for nonviolent resistance to the British Empire than for his Hindu\nreligion.  Similarly, the District Court concluded that a poster of the Dalai Lama was\nabout  the  religion  of  Buddhism  rather  than  about  resistance  to  oppression  by\nCommunist China against the former nation of Tibet.  1 ER 5.  Similarly, a poster of\nMalcolm X is identified as a “Muslim minister” rather than a civil rights leader; every\nhigh school teaches 1960's American history, where both Martin Luther King and\nMalcolm X were prominent historical figures.  In short, each of these posters depict\npeople of influence on subjects other than religion, even though they may touch on\nreligion.  There is no context, nor any identification of the reason for the display, or\nthe type of classroom they were displayed within.\n54\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 65 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nBut most importantly, these other items do not advocate religion, which is what\nthe School’s policy and regulation prohibits.  3 ER 465.  The District Court ignored\nthis policy completely.  “The removal of materials from the classroom is acceptable\nwhen it is determined that the materials are being used in a manner that violates\nEstablishment Clause guarantees.  Thus, the Establishment Clause focuses on the\nmanner of use to which materials are put; it does not focus on the content of the\nmaterials per se.  For example, [] books about American Indian religion could be used\nin violation of the Establishment Clause if they were taught in a proselytizing manner.\nBecause  they  were  not  so  used,  however,  those  books  do  not  violate  the\nEstablishment Clause by the very existence of their content.”  Roberts v. Madigan,\n921 F.2d 1047, 1055 (10th Cir. 1990).  On the other hand, Johnson’s banners were\ndesigned by him to advocate a particular religious belief associated with America.\nThey were on display, and not sitting folded on a desk.\nIn short, the School was not advocating other religions or non-religion over\nJohnson’s religion.  The District Court erred in holding that the School violated the\nEstablishment Clause.\nE. The School Did Not Violate Equal Protection Clause.\nTo establish a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, Johnson must show\nthat Defendants’ actions resulted in him receiving disparate treatment compared to\n55\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 66 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nother similarly-situated employees.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\n473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985).  Equal protection claims require strict scrutiny if the\nlegislation discriminates against a suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental\nright.  Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).  The Equal Protection Clause may\ngive rise to a cause of action even if the plaintiff does not allege membership in a\nclass or group.  See Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000).\nHowever, this type of equal protection challenge is evaluated under a rational-basis\ntest to determine whether the legislation at issue is irrational or wholly arbitrary.\nConti v. City of Fremont, 919 F.2d 1385, 1389 (9th Cir. 1990).  In equal protection\nclaims brought by a “class of one,” the plaintiff must allege that he has been\nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no\nrational basis for the difference in treatment.  See Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota\nCounty, 260 U.S. 441, 445 (1923); Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Commission of\nWebster Cty., 488 U.S. 336 (1989).\nHere,  Defendants’  actions  did  not  impinge  on  any  fundamental  right  of\nJohnson.  He is free to hold his own religious beliefs.  If he has a personal area in the\nclassroom that is not accessible to students, he can keep religious items there.  But\nwhen students or clients/parents are present, he does not hold speech rights with\nrespect to speech made to them during the school day in his capacity as a teacher.\n56\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 67 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nAnd, as explained above, the District was not trying to rid the classroom of all\nreligious references, as the District Court presumed.  Johnson was treated the same\nwith respect to display of speech touching on religion as any other teacher.  \nFinally, the School has a legitimate state interest in ensuring that all points of\nview, and not one single viewpoint, are heard by the students in the classroom.  The\nSchool  felt  that  Johnson’s  banners  did  not  comply  with  its  policy  prohibiting\nadvocacy of a sectarian viewpoint, including religion.  The School’s decision was\ntherefore narrowly tailored to  achieve an important government interest.  There was\nno Equal Protection violation, and the District Court erred in so holding.\nF. The School Did Not Violate the “No Preference Clause” of the California\nConstitution.\nCalifornia’s No Preference Clause reads:  “Free exercise and enjoyment of\nreligion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.”  Cal. Const. art. I, § 4.\n“California courts have interpreted the No Preference Clause to require that the\ngovernment neither prefer one religion over another nor appear to act preferentially.”\nBrown v. Woodland Joint Unified School Dist., 27 F.3d 1373, 1384 (9th Cir. 1994),\nciting Sands v. Morongo Unif. Sch. Dist., 53 Cal.3d 863, 872-878 (1991).\nAs  explained  in  detail  above,  the  School  did  not  direct  the  removal  of\nJohnson’s banners with an eye to advancing one religion over another.  On the\n57\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 68 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\ncontrary, the School was concerned that Johnson himself was trying to advance his\nreligion over non-religion and over other religions by hanging his banners.  The intent\nof the school was to maintain neutrality concerning religion.  Hence, the District\nCourt erred in holding for Johnson on this claim also.\nG. If the Court Finds A Constitutional Violation, Qualified Immunity Should\nStill Shield the Individual Defendants.\nQualified immunity shields public employees from liability for civil damages\nwhere “their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982).  “When governmental officials assert the defense of\nqualified immunity to an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a court evaluating the\ndefense must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of a\nconstitutional  right  and,  if  so,  then  determine  ‘whether  the  right  was  clearly\nestablished at the time of the alleged violation.’”  Cole v. Oroville Union High School\nDist., 228 F.3d 1092, 1101 (9th Cir. 2000).  The task is determining whether the\npreexisting law provided the defendants with “fair warning” that their conduct was\nunlawful.  Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 740 (2002).\nIn the case at bar, the District Court denied the individual Defendants’ request\nfor qualified immunity, and awarded damages against these school administrators and\n58\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 69 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nelected school board members.  The District Court found that “the law has been\nclearly established since Tinker that school teachers enjoy First Amendment rights\ninside the schoolhouse gates.”  1 ER 31, citing  Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393\n(2007).  The Court also found that “[i]t is also clearly established law that where free\nspeech is permitted, the government may not discriminate based on the speaker’s\nviewpoint.”  1 ER 31.\n1. Contrary to the District Court’s opinion, the law is unsettled.\nContrary to District Court’s holding, the law is not clearly established in favor\nof teacher speech in the classroom.  In fact, the majority of the cases would point to\na limitation on teachers’ rights, and forbid school districts from displaying such\nbanners.  Even if Johnson’s banners are entitled to constitutional protection, the\nindividual defendants should be protected by qualified immunity because the law\ngoverning teacher-speech on the subject of religion in the classroom is not so well\ndeveloped that a reasonable person would know the applicable rule.  In fact, most\nreasonable people, upon review of all of the speech cases involving teachers, would\nconclude that the plainly established rule is that teachers cannot advocate religion in\nthe classroom during instructional time.  \nThe clear holding in Peloza , supra, would make any school administrator who\nwas familiar with that case absolutely certain that he or she had a obligation to stop\n59\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 70 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\na teacher from advocating about religion during the school day.  Peloza — taken\nalone —should have been sufficient basis for the District Court to rule in favor of\nqualified immunity.  The individual Defendants were justified in believing that\nteaching religious ideas during class time is a potential violation of the Establishment\nClause, and that avoiding such violation overcomes any free-speech right of a\nclassroom teacher.  Most people familiar with the cases would reasonably conclude\nthat Johnson’s banners were improper advocacy of a religion, and impermissible in\nthe classroom during class.  Or at least they would say it was a close call — too close\nto hold individuals liable. \n2. The  School’s  administrators  were  not  insensitive  to  Johnson’s\nbeliefs.\nJust a couple of years before the events in this case, the Ninth Circuit ruled that\nthe words “one Nation under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance were illegal when\nrecited in the classroom.  Newdow v. U.S. Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2005).\nAfter that event, another case was filed by Mr. Newdow, and subsequently the Ninth\nCircuit has ruled that the phrase “one Nation under God” is not a problem, in the\ncontext of the entire Pledge.  Rio Linda, supra, 597 F.3d 1007, 1013-1014.\nA reasonable person could be excused for believing that the phrase “one Nation\nunder God,” enlarged on the wall of a classroom, would take the phrase out of context\n60\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 71 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nof the Pledge, and make it less than appropriate in the classroom.  When placed on\nthe wall—along with other phrases containing references to God — the context shifts,\nand the context becomes a message proclaiming the national endorsement of the\nJudeo-Christian religion.  That shift in context argues strongly that the law is not\nclearly established, and the administrators could not have known the correct rule to\napply. \nAnd the school administrators in this case were not insensitive to Johnson’s\nrights.  The Associate Superintendent offered posters to Johnson placing each of the\nphrases in historical context.  3 ER 426.  Johnson rejected the request to substitute\nthose posters.  Id.  Like the majority opinion in Rio Linda, the school administration\nbelieved that a message’s context is important.\nThis case also involves issues of the Establishment Clause that are not well-\nsettled.  As Justice Souter recently indicated in a concurrence, “The interaction\nbetween the ‘government speech doctrine’ and Establishment Clause principles has\nnot, however, begun to be worked out.”  Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum, __\nU.S. __, 129 S.Ct. 1125, 1138 (2009).\nThe relationship between religion and the state is difficult for judges to\ndetermine.  If appellate-court judges cannot agree, then the law is not settled, and\nschool administrators cannot be held to know what the law is.  Accordingly, if this\n61\n\nCase: 10-55445   07/16/2010   Page: 72 of 74    ID: 7408968   DktEntry: 5-1\nCourt affirms the District Court with respect to Johnson’s claims against the School\nDistrict, then it still should reverse with respect to qualified immunity and have\nsummary judgment entered in favor of the individual Defendants.\nVIII.   CONCLUSION\nThe School urges this Court to reverse the judgment of the District Court and\nto enter summary judgment in favor of the School and individual Defendants.  If the\nCourt finds a constitutional violation, then the Court should still enter summary\njudgment in favor of the individuals based upon qualified immunity.\nRespectfully Submitted,\nDATED:  July 16, 2010 STUTZ ARTIANO SHINOFF & HOLTZ\nA Professional Corporation\nBy:              s/ Paul V.

Barnette,  319  U.S.  624  (1943),  the  U.S.  Supreme  Court stated,  \"If there is  any \nfixed  star in our constitutional  constellation,  it is that no  official,  high or petty,  can prescribe what shall be  orthodox in \npolitics, nationalism, religion,  or other matters  of opinion.\" /d.  at 642  (emphasis  added).  In direct contravention, \nDefendants  seek to prescribe what  \"shall be  orthodox\"  in matters  of opinion by permitting teachers to  express personal,\n  \nPage 2 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *1 \nnon-curricular messages that promote  certain favored ideologies, religions,  and partisan viewpoints  on controversial \npolitical  and  social  issues,  while  censoring certain disfavored [*2]  viewpoints,  such as  Plaintiff's  allegedly  \"Christian\" \nviewpoint.  As  a result of Defendants’  speech restriction,  that  \"fixed star\"  in our constitutional  constellation has been \nobscured and an official  orthodoxy prescribed. \nIn the  final  analysis,  accepting Defendants’  tendentious view  of the  law  and facts  of this  case would require this \ncourt to  disregard fundamental principles  of constitutional law.  This  court previously reyected Defendants’  legal \narguments in its  order denying their motion to  dismiss  (Doc.  No.  25),  and  should  similarly reject those  arguments here. \nSTANDARD  OF REVIEW \nRule  56 provides that a motion for summary judgment  should be  granted when  \"the pleadings,  the  discovery  and \ndisclosure materials  on file,  and any  affidavits  show that there 1s no  genuine issue  as to  any material  fact and that the \nmovant 1s  entitled to  a judgment as  a matter of law.\"  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c).  When reviewing Defendants’  motion,  this \ncourt must view the  evidence,  all  facts,  and inferences that may be  drawn from the  facts in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff. Matsushita Elec.  Indus.  Co.  v.  Zenith Radio  Corp.,  475  U.S.  574,  587  (1986). \nSTATEMENT  OF  FACTS  [*3] \nPlaintiff is  currently a public  school math teacher at Westview High  School in the  Poway Unified  School District \n(hereinafter  \"School District\").  He has taught math in the  School District for more than 30 years.  During these  30  plus \nyears,  he has taught at 3  different high schools in the  district,  including Mt.  Carmel  High  School  (1977 to  1989), \nRancho  Bernardo High School  (1990  to  2002),  and now Westview High  School  (2003  to present).  (SOMF  at PP  1-4). \nnl  Plaintiff has  a  strong reputation as  a teacher;  he  continues to be  one  of the highest rated math teachers  at Westview \nHigh  School.  (SOMF  at P  19). \nnl  \"SOMF\"  refers to  Plaintiff's  Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion for Summary \nJudgment and associated exhibits,  which were previously  filed in this matter and can be  found at Doc.  Nos.  43 \nthrough 54.  In order to  avoid unnecessary  and costly duplication,  Plaintiff has not re-filed those numerous \nexhibits here,  but instead relies  on the  \"the pleadings,  the  discovery and disclosure materials  on file\"  in this \nopposition.  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  56(c). \n[*4] \nThe  School District be/ieves that public  schools play  an important role  educating and guiding  our youth through the \nmarketplace  of ideas  and instilling national values.  One method the  School  District uses to  accomplish this task is to \npermit students to be  exposed to the rich diversity  of backgrounds  and opinions held by its high  school  faculty.  n2 \n(SOME  at PP 63,  64). \nn2  For example,  the  School District permits its teachers to participate  in the  \"day  of silence\"-a pro-gay rights \nactivity-on School District property with the  students  so  long as the teacher's participation does not disrupt the \nteaching  of his  or her classes.  (SOME  at P  65). \nAccordingly,  for the past 30  plus years,  the  School District has  adopted a policy,  practice,  and/or custom of \npermitting teachers to  display in their classrooms various non-curricular messages  and other items that reflect the \nindividual teacher's personality,  opinions,  and values regarding  a wide range  of interests  and  subject matter. \nConsequently,  for the past 30  [*5]  plus years, the  classroom walls have  served and continue to  serve  as  a forum for\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *5 \nteachers to  convey personal, non-curricular messages  on  subjects that interest them.  (SOMF  at PP  35-50). \nPursuant to this  long-standing  School District policy, practice,  and/or custom,  teachers have  displayed and continue \nto  display in their classrooms  such non-curricular materials  as posters  of rock bands  and musicians;  a poster of the \ncontroversial  song /magine written by John Lennon;  posters  of various professional  athletes  and professional  sports \nteams;  family photographs;  non-student artwork;  posters  and other items,  such as bumper stickers,  decals,  and buttons, \npromoting and advocating  a viewpoint on social  and political  issues  such as gay rights,  global warming,  animal \nresearch,  the  environment,  anti-war/peace,  the military,  and others.  (SOMF  at PP 36-39,  42-50). \nPursuant to this policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  the  School District has  allowed teachers to  display Tibetan prayer \nflags,  which are  considered  sacred items by those who practice the religion of Buddhism.  n3  Teachers have  also \ndisplayed and continue to  display nature pictures;  inspirational messages  on posters  and banners;  patriotic  [*6] \nmessages  on posters, banners,  and flags;  movie posters;  posters  of famous religious  leaders,  such as  Gandhi  (Hindu),  the \nDali  Lama (Buddhist),  and the  controversial Malcolm X (the Nation of Islam/Islam);  and items  of particular political \nparties  and/or candidates,  including  a campaign poster of candidate  Obama,  a Newsweek magazine  cover of the \ncandidates  Obama and Biden;  and a poster of the  \"Libertarian Party.\"  (SOMF  at PP 36-39,  42-50,  53-54).  The  School \nDistrict admits that these  displayed items  express  a personal message  on behalf of the individual teacher and not on \nbehalf of the  School District.  (SOMF  at PP  55,  56,  62). \nn3  Buddhists believe that these  flags  impart a spiritual blessing upon those in the presence  of the  flags.  (SOMF \nat P  53). \nPermissible  subject matter for this  forum for teacher  speech include,  inter alia,  the  foundations  of our Nation, \npatriotic messages,  inspirational messages,  historical messages,  and slogans that are praiseworthy  of our Nation.  (SOMF \nat P  37).  And,  as Defendants  [*7]  admit in their  statement of undisputed facts,  \"[R]eligion 1s not a category of items \nprohibited from classroom walls.\"  (Doc.  No.  55). \nPursuant to this  School  District policy,  practice,  and/or custom,  for approximately 25  years  Plaintiff continuously \ndisplayed,  without any objections  from the  School  District or its  administrators,  on his  classroom walls various patriotic \nbanners that reflect the history  and heritage  of our Nation.  Plaintiff had the banners made to  order by  a private  company \nand purchased them with his  own personal  funds.  The banners  do not belong to the  School District;  they are Plaintiff's \npersonal items.  (SOMF  at PP 20-23). \nPlaintiff's banners  contain well-known historical, patriotic phrases  and  slogans  central to  our Nation's history  and \nheritage,  and they reflect the  foundations  of our Nation.  The banners  do not contain quotes  or passages  from  Sacred \nScripture  or any  other religious text.  (SOMF  at PP  68-88). \nThe  classrooms in which Plaintiff's banners were  displayed were  assigned to him.  His  current classroom in \nWestview High  School is his  classroom for homeroom and academic  classes.  He  also uses his  classroom  for \nnon-curricular and extra-curricular activities.  [*8]  (SOME  at P 25).  As  a matter of School District policy, practice, \nand/or custom,  teachers  are  given discretion and control  over the various non-curricular messages  displayed on their \nclassroom walls.  For example,  no teacher is permitted to  display materials  or messages  on Plaintiff's  classroom walls \nwithout his permission,  and the  School District does not direct the teachers’  non-curricular displays;  it is up to the \nindividual teacher.  (SOMF  at PP  32-34). \nPlaintiff's banners  contain the  following well-known historical,  patriotic phrases:  \"In God We  Trust,\"  the  official \nmotto  of the United  States;  \"One Nation Under God,\"  the  1954  amendment to the Pledge  of Allegiance;  \"God Bless \nAmerica,\"  a patriotic  song;  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee,\"  a line  from  \"America the  Beautiful,\"  a patriotic  song;  and\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *8 \n\"All  Men Are  Created Equal,  They Are  Endowed By  Their Creator,\"  an excerpt from the preamble to the Declaration of \nIndependence.  n4  (SOMF  at PP  68-88).  Consequently,  the  subject matter of Plaintiff's  speech was permissible in this \nforum.  (SOMF  at PP  37,  103,  104). \nn4  Defendants’  claim that the historic phrases  and slogans  quoted by Plaintiff were  out of \"context\"  1s nonsense. \n(Defs.'  Mem.  at 7).  First,  as  Defendants  acknowledge, the  quoted phrases  and  slogans  are well known;  there is \nno need for any  extra  \"context.\"  (SOMF  at P  74).  Second,  Defendants  do not impose this  \"context\"  requirement \non other teacher speech,  including  speech that selectively  quotes  from the very  same historic  documents  quoted \nby Plaintiff.  (SOMF  at P 38).  And third,  Plaintiff was willing to  display the  additional historic  \"context\" \ndocuments provided by Defendants  alongside his banners,  but Defendants  refused,  demonstrating that their \nargument was mere pretext.  (Johnson Decl.  at P  3  at Ex.  1). \n[*9] \nPlaintiff's banners were not displayed pursuant to  any of his  official  duties  as  a teacher.  He  did not use his banners \nduring  any  classroom  session or period of instruction.  They were not discussed or  studied.  They caused no material \ndisruption or disorder in his  classroom or anywhere  else  in the  school.  They did not interfere with his teaching.  And \nthey were not expressing  a message  on behalf of the  School  District.  (SOMF  at PP 26-27,  60-63,  90,  98). \nPlaintiff's  long-standing practice  of displaying his banners  came to  an abrupt end when in January,  2007, \nDefendants  ordered Plaintiff to take them down.  n5  Defendants  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners because they \nbelieved that the banners were promoting  a  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  viewpoint.  On behalf of the  School District, \nDefendant William Chiment,  Assistant Superintendent at the time,  n6  sent a letter to  Plaintiff explaining the  order to \nremove the banners.  In the  letter,  Defendant Chiment stated that Plaintiff's banners  conveyed an impermissible \n\"sectarian viewpoint\"  and,  more  specifically,  \"a particular  sectarian viewpoint.”  The  \"particular sectarian viewpoint\" \nnoted in the letter was referring to the viewpoint  [*10]  of \"those religious groups who refer to  a supreme being  as  God,\" \nsuch as  Christians.  Defendant Dawn Kastner,  Plaintiff's principal  at Westview High School, believed that Plaintiff's \nbanners were impermissible because they expressed a  \"Christian\"  viewpoint.  (SOMF  at PP  91-96,  100).  Meanwhile, \nDefendants had no  objection to  a  science teacher displaying  a 40-foot string of Tibetan prayer flags,  which are  sacred \nitems that promote the Buddhist religion.  (SOMF  at PP  53,  54).  Defendants  acknowledge that these prayer flags  \"are \nnon-curricular personal items in nature\"  (Defs.'  Mem.  at  19),  similar to  Plaintiff's banners. \nn5  Prior to the  School District's  order to remove the banners in 2007, the  School District received no  complaints \nabout the banners  from  students,  teachers,  parents,  or School  Board members.  The  only  complaint to the  School \nDistrict came  from Defendant Kastner in the  fall  of 2006,  and this  complaint resulted in the removal  of the \nbanners.  (SOMF  at P 29). \nn6  Defendant Chiment's present title  is  \"Associate  Superintendent.\"  (See  SOMF  at P  13). \n[*11] \nAt the time  Defendants  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners, they had no  evidence that the banners  caused any \nmaterial  disruption or disorder in the  School District.  Defendants'  removal  of Plaintiff's banners was not curriculum \nrelated;  Plaintiff was teaching  and continues to teach his  assigned mathematics  curriculum.  Defendants  singled out \nPlaintiff for disfavored treatment because  of the viewpoint expressed by his message.  (SOMF  at PP  98-100,  102,  105). \nAnd the  decision to  order Plaintiff to remove his banners was  approved by  all Defendants,  including the  Superintendent \nand the  School Board.  (SOMF  at PP  5-18,  97).\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *11 \nPlaintiff wants to  display his banners 1n his  classroom;  however,  Defendants have prohibited him from doing  so. \nHad Plaintiff not complied with Defendants’  order to remove his banners,  Plaintiff would have been  subject to  some \nform of disciplinary action for insubordination.  (SOMF  at PP  101,  106). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants Violated  Plaintiff's  First Amendment Right to  Freedom of Speech. \nA.  Defendants'  Arguments  \"Shed\"  Plaintiff of His  Constitutional Rights. \nWhile  Defendants  claim that they  do  \"not disagree that public  school teachers have First  [*12]  Amendment nights\" \n(Defs.'  Mem.  at 8),  their arguments  suggest otherwise.  It 1s without dispute that Defendants  created a forum for \npersonal,  non-curricular teacher  speech.  However,  Defendants now  seek to  avoid this  inconvenient fact (and controlling \nlaw)  so  as to keep this  forum open for favored opinions  and viewpoints,  while retaining the power to  censor viewpoints \nthey  dislike.  From a legal  (and educational) perspective,  Defendants  arguments  are troubling. \nAs  an initial matter,  there is no  dispute that: \n(1)  Plaintiff,  a public  school teacher,  does not  \"shed  [his]  constitutional nghts to  freedom  of speech or expression at \nthe  school house gate.\"  Tinker v.  Des Moines Indep.  Cmty.  Sch.  Dist.,  393  U.S.  503,  506  (1969)  (\"First Amendment \nrights  ..  .  are  available to teachers  and  students.\"); Morse v.  Frederick,  551  U.S.  393,  403  (2007)  (\"In  Tinker,  this  Court \nmade  clear that 'First Amendment nights  applied in light of the  special  characteristics  of the  school  environment'  are \navailable to teachers  and  students.\"); Perry Educ.

See Hill v.  Colorado,  530  U.S.  703,  715  (2000)  (\"[S]ign displays  .  .  .  are \nprotected by the  First Amendment\");  United States v.  Grace,  461  U.S.  171,  176-77  (1983)  (demonstrating with  signs \nand banners  constitutes  speech under the First Amendment);  Brown  v.  California Dep't of Transp.,  321  F.3d 1217 (9th \nCir.  2003)  (enjoining policy restricting the  display  of signs  or banners  on highway overpass  fences under the  First \nAmendment); \n(3)  Defendants  created a forum for teachers to  express personal,  non-curricular messages; \n(4)  Displaying banners,  such as  Plaintiff's banners,  is  a form of expression that is permitted in the  forum; \n(5)  Plaintiff's banners,  which were  displayed without objection for 25 years,  did not disrupt the  classroom nor \nmaterially interfere with the basic  educational mission of the  School  District.  See  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at 513  (holding that \nthe  \"special  characteristics  of the  school  environment\"  permit restrictions  on  speech only  so  long as the  speech \n\"materially  and  [*14]  substantially  disrupt[s]  the work and discipline  of the  school\");  Grayned v.  City of Rockford,  408 \nU.S.  104  (1972)  (same);  and \n(6)  Plaintiff's  constitutional rights  are  implicated by Defendants’  speech restriction.  n7 See Perry Educ. Ass'n,  460 \nU.S.  at 44  (\"There  is no  question that constitutional  interests  are  implicated by denying  [appellee]  use  of the interschool \nmail  system.\"); Keyishian v.

Mem.  at  14),  1s  a choice  attributable to the government,  thereby triggering  constitutional protection.  See \nLee  v.

Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *14 \nclergy to give  an invocation and benediction at the  school's graduation ceremony was  \"a choice  attributable to \nthe  State,  and from a constitutional perspective it 1s  as  if a state  statute  decreed that the prayers must occur\"). \n[*15] \nIn  sum,  Defendants’ request that this  court eschew  a forum analysis  in favor of a  \"balancing\"  test in which \nDefendants have their fingers  on the  scale  effectively  strips Plaintiff of his  fundamental rights  and undermines the \nvalues protected by the  First Amendment. \nB.  Defendants  Created  a  Forum for Plaintiff's  Speech. \nThere is no  escaping the  fact that this is  a forum  analysis  case-not a Pickering balancing  case-because  Plaintiff is \nseeking to use  government property  (his  classroom walls)  for non-curricular,  personal  expression pursuant to  a \nlongstanding  School District policy, practice,  and/or custom of permitting teachers to use this  forum for such  speech.  A \npractice that the  School District does not deny.  n8 \nn8  There  are  some recognizable limits that the  courts have upheld in a  school  setting.  For example,  the  School \nDistrict could prohibit speech that promotes illegal  drug use  (or underage  alcohol  consumption,  for that matter \n(see  Defs.'  Mem.  at 3  (prohibiting  a picture  of a family  drinking alcohol heavily)),  see Morse,  551  U.S.  at \n408-09;  that  \"materially and  substantially disrupt[s]  the work  and discipline  of the  school,\"  7inker,  393  U.S.  at \n513,  such as  items prohibited by  an anti-harassment policy;  or that 1s  sexually  suggestive, Bethel Sch.  Dist.  No. \n403  v.  Fraser,  478  U.S.  675,  678  (1986).  Under Supreme  Court precedent,  the  School  District could also restrict \nspeech that  \"incite[s]  to  imminent lawless  action.\" Brandenburg v.  Ohio,  395  U.S.  444,  449  (1969).  None  of \nthese  limitations  apply to  Plaintiff's patriotic  expression. \n[*16] \nThe U.S.  Supreme  Court,  no  less,  \"has  adopted a forum  analysis  as  a means  of determining when the  Government's \ninterest in /imiting the  use  of its property to  its intended purpose  outweighs the interest of those wishing  fo  use  the \nproperty for other purposes.\" Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Defense  & Educ.  Fund,  473  U.S.  788,  800  (1985)  (emphasis \nadded);  see Flint v.  Dennison,  488 F.3d 816,  828-30,  n.9  (9th  Cir.  2007)  (conducting  a forum analysis  in a case  seeking \nreview  of a public  school  speech restriction);  Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified Sch.  Dist.  No.  48,  329 F.3d 1044,  1048  (9th \nCir.  2003)  (\"To  analyze his  [First Amendment free  speech]  claim,  we must first consider what type  of forum the \n[School]  District has  created.\"). \nConsequently,  contrary to Defendants’  assertion,  to  determine the  extent of Plaintiff's  free  speech rights  on  School \nDistrict property,  the  court must engage in a First Amendment forum analysis. Arizona Life  Coal.,  Inc.  v.  Stanton,  515 \nF.3d 956,  968  (9th  Cir.  2008)  (\"The  first step  in assessing a First Amendment claim relating to private  speech on \ngovernment property 1s to identify the nature  [*17]  of the  forum.\")  (internal  quotations  omitted);  see also Perry Educ. \nAss'n,  460  U.S.  at 44  (applying  a forum analysis  in a case  involving  a public  school  speech restriction and noting that \n\"[t]he First Amendment's guarantee  of free  speech applies  .  .  .  within the  school  and on sidewalks  outside\")  (internal \ncitation omitted). \nOddly,  Defendants rely heavily on Berry v.  Department of Soc.  Serv.,  447 F.3d 642  (9th  Cir.  2006),  to  argue that \nthe Pickering balancing test  should apply to the  facts  of this  case.  However,  in Berry the Ninth Circuit applied a forum \nanalysis to  determine the  constitutionality  of the  government's restriction on the use  of its  facilities  for the plaintiff's \nspeech (as  opposed to the Pickering balancing test the  court applied to  evaluate the restriction of plaintiff's  speech when \ncounseling  clients  of the  department).  Defendants mistakenly  seek to  dismiss the  application of a forum analysis by \nerroneously  concluding that Plaintiff \"does not contend that the District is restricting use  of school  facilities,  so the\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *17 \nforum analysis  does not apply here.\"  (Defs.'  Mem.  at  10,  n.3).  To the  contrary,  this 1s  exactly what  [*18]  Plaintiff is \nasserting:  Defendants have  opened the use  of its  facilities  for teachers to  express personal, non-curricular messages,  but \nare now  denying Plaintiff access to this  forum based on his viewpoint.  In their argument Defendants  acknowledge, \nalbeit unwittingly, the illegitimacy of their claims. \nThus,  it would be  error to  accept Defendants’  invitation to ignore  controlling law,  which compels  a forum analysis \nunder the  facts  of this  case.  See Flint,  488 F.3d at 828-30,  n.9  (noting that it is  error to not conduct a forum analysis  and \nfurther noting that the  U.S.  Supreme  Court has reinforced  \"the  conclusion that we must analyze  [the public  school \nspeech restriction at issue]  within the  confines  of traditional  forum analysis\").  In Hazelwood Sch.  Dist.  v.  Kuhlmeier, \n484  U.S.  260,  267  (1988),  for example,  the  Supreme  Court applied its  forum analysis  in the  context of a public high \nschool.  The  Court  specifically noted that school  facilities-such as the  classroom walls  in this  case-could be  deemed \n\"public  forums\"  for First Amendment purposes  if school  authorities  \"by policy  or by practice\"  opened those  facilities \nfor use  \"by  some  segment of the  [*19]  public,  such as  student organizations\"-or,  as here,  teachers.  /d.  See Perry Educ. \nAss'n,  460  U.S.  at 37 (applying  a forum analysis to  determine the  constitutionality  of a speech restriction applied to the \ninterschool mail  system and teacher mailboxes in a public  school  district). \n\"Forum analysis has traditionally  divided government property into three  categories:  public  fora,  designated public \nfora,  and nonpublic  fora.\" FVint,  488 F.3d at 830  (citation omitted).  \"Once the  forum 1s identified,  we  determine whether \nrestrictions  on speech are justified by the requisite  standard.\" /d.  \"On one  end of the  fora spectrum lies the traditional \npublic  forum,  'places which by long tradition  .  ..  have been devoted to  assembly and debate.’  Next on the  spectrum is \nthe  so-called designated public  forum,  which exists  '[w]hen the government intentionally  dedicates  its property to \nexpressive  conduct.\" /d.  (citations  omitted).  As the  Supreme  Court  stated,  \"[A]  public  forum may be  created by \ngovernment designation of a place  or channel  of communication for use by the public  at large  for assembly and  speech, \nfor use by  certain  speakers,  or for the  discussion  [*20]  of certain subjects.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 802  (emphasis \nadded).  In a traditional  or designated public  forum,  restrictions  on  speech are  subject to  strict scrutiny.  Flint,  488 F.3d at \n830. \nIn  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263  (1981),  for example,  the  Court held that a state university,  which made  its \nfacilities generally  available  for the  activities  of registered student groups  (similar to this  case,  the university's  facilities \nwere not open to the general public),  may not close its  facilities to  a  student group based on the  content of the  group's \nspeech.  /d.  at 264-65,  267 n.5.  The  Court stated,  \"Through its policy  of accommodating their meetings,  the  University \nhas  created a forum generally  open for use by  student groups.  Having  done  so,  the  University has  assumed an obligation \nto justify its  discriminations  and exclusions under applicable  constitutional norms .  .  .  even  if it was not required to \ncreate  the forum  in  the first place.\" Id.  at 267-68 (emphasis  added).  The  Court considered the  forum to be  a designated \npublic  forum,  applied  strict  scrutiny,  and  struck down the regulation.  /d.  at 270  &  277.  [*21] \nIn this  case,  the  School  District created a forum generally open  \"for use by  certain  speakers,\"  thereby  creating  a \nforum for  \"non-curricular personal\"  speech of its teachers.  And because  Defendants  singled out Plaintiff's  expression for \nexclusion from this  forum based not only on its  content (which 1s  fatal),  but 1ts viewpoint (which is  doubly fatal), this \ncourt should apply  strict scrutiny and strike  down the  challenged restriction. \nNonetheless,  \"[a]t the  opposite  end of the  fora spectrum 1s the non-public  forum.  The non-public  forum is  '[a]ny \npublic property that 1s not by tradition or designation a forum for public  communication.\"  Flint,  488 F.3d at 830 \n(citations  omitted).  In a nonpublic  forum government restrictions  are  subjected to  less-exacting judicial  scrutiny.  There \na government may restrict free  speech if it acts reasonably  and does not suppress  expression merely because public \nofficials  oppose the  speaker's view.  /d.  (citations  omitted). \nThe Ninth Circuit also recognizes  a  \"limited public  forum\"  as  a subcategory of the  designated public  forum.  See  id. \nat 830-31.  A  \"limited public  forum\"  is  \"a type  of nonpublic  forum that the  [*22]  government has intentionally  opened \nto  certain groups  or to  certain topics.\" /d.  at 831.  \"Once  a government has  opened a limited forum,  it must respect the \nlawful boundaries it has itself set.\"  n9 /d.  at 83/  (quoting Rosenberger v.  Rector &  Visitors of Univ.  of Va.,  515  U.S.\nPage  8 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *22 \n819,  829  (1995))  (internal  quotations  and punctuation omitted).  Accordingly,  in a limited public  forum  \"the  government \nmay not exclude  speech where  its  distinction is not reasonable  in light of the purpose  served by the  forum,  nor may the \ngovernment discriminate  against speech on the basis  of its viewpoint.\"  Hint,  488 F.3d at §3/  (citations  and quotations \nomitted). \nn9  Certainly,  if Defendants wanted to take the  draconian  step  of removing all personal  expressive items  from the \nclassroom walls,  thereby closing the  forum to  all  speech,  it could do  so.  But once it has  created this  forum,  it \ncannot pick and choose based on the viewpoint of the  speaker which messages  are  acceptable  and which are not. \n[*23] \nHere,  the undisputed evidence  shows that pursuant to  a long-standing policy, practice,  and/or custom,  the  School \nDistrict created,  at a minimum,  a  \"limited public  forum\"  that 1s  open for use by teachers,  including Plaintiff,  to  express  a \nvariety  of messages,  including personal,  non-curricular messages.  Pursuant to this policy,  practice,  and/or custom, \nteachers  displayed and continue to  display on their classroom walls messages that reflect the individual teacher's \npersonality,  opinions,  and values with regard to  a wide range  of subject matter,  including  social  and political  concerns. \nPermissible  subject matter include,  inter alia,  patriotic messages, historical messages,  inspirational messages,  religious \nmessages,  and messages regarding the  foundations  of our Nation.  Pursuant to this policy, practice,  and/or custom, \nteachers have  discretion and control  over the messages they wish to  convey in this  forum. \nC.  Defendants'  Viewpoint Restriction Violates  the  First Amendment. \nViewpoint discrimination 1s prohibited 1n all  forums because  it is  an egregious  form of content discrimination.  See \nRosenberger v.  Rector &  Visitors of the  Univ.  of Va.,  515  U.S.  819,  829  (1995)).  [*24]  Pursuant to  controlling  case law, \nif certain  speech  \"fall[s]  within an acceptable  subject matter otherwise  included in the  forum,  the  State may not \nlegitimately exclude  it from the  forum based on the viewpoint of the  speaker.\"  Cogswell v.  City of Seattle,  347 F.3d \n809,  S815  (9th  Cir.  2003).  Viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government  \"denies  access to  a speaker  solely to \nsuppress the point of view he  espouses  on an otherwise includible  subject.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 806. \nBecause  Defendants  singled out Plaintiff's  speech based on his viewpoint,  Defendants'  speech restriction cannot \nsurvive  constitutional  scrutiny.  (See also  Doc.  No.  25  (Order Denying Mot.  to  Dismiss)  at  13-14  (citing Rosenberger, \n315  U.S.  at 819;  Lamb's  Chapel v.  Center Moriches  Union Free Sch.  Dist.,  508  U.S.  384  (1993);  Good News  Club  vy. \nMilford Cent.  Sch.,  533  U.S.  98,  107-08  (2001);  Faith  Center Church Evangelistic Ministries v.  Glover,  480 F.3d 891 \n(9th  Cir.  2007);  Truth  v.  Kent Sch.  Dist.,  324 F.3d 957,  973(9th  Cir.  2008)  (observing that in a public high  school \nlimited public  forum  [*25]  \"where restriction to the  forum is based  solely  on.  .  .  religious viewpoint,  the restriction 1s \ninvalid\")). \nIndeed,  \"[rJestrictions  on free  expression in a nonpublic  forum are  constitutional  only if the  distinctions  drawn are \n(1)  'reasonable in light of the purpose  served by the  forum,'  and (2)  ‘viewpoint neutral.\"\"  Brown  v.  California Dep't of \nTransp.,  321 F.3d 1217,  1222  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (quoting Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 806);  Perry,  460  U.S.  at 46 (stating that \nspeech restrictions  in a nonpublic  forum must be reasonable  and viewpoint neutral)). \nAs noted previously,  Defendants’  speech restriction fails the viewpoint neutrality prong,  and is thus unconstitutional \nfor that reason alone.  nl10  Nonetheless,  it also  fails the  \"reasonableness\"  prong. \nnl0  The Ninth Circuit has  also  \"incorporated 'viewpoint neutrality’  analysis into nonpublic  forum, \nschool-sponsored speech cases  ...  .\" Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003,  1010  (9th  Cir.\nPage  9 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *25 \n2000)  (citing Planned Parenthood v.  Clark County Sch.  Dist.,  941  F.2d 817,  828 n.  19,  829-30  (9th  Cir.  1991)). \n[*26] \nThe  \"reasonableness\"  prong  \"focuses  on whether the limitation is  consistent with preserving the property for the \npurpose to which it is  dedicated.\"  Brown,  321  F.3d at 1222  (internal  quotations  and citation omitted).  Here,  Plaintiff's \nspeech did not disrupt school work,  nor did it cause material  disorder or interference  in the  classroom.  And Defendants’ \norder to remove the banners was not curriculum related;  Plaintiff's banners were not displayed as part of his  official \nduties  as  a teacher nor were they part of his math curriculum,  which he  continues to teach today.  The banners have \nnever prevented Plaintiff from teaching his math curriculum, nor have they limited him in any way in the teaching  of his \nclasses.  In fact,  Plaintiff was  and continues to be  one  of the highest rated math teachers  at Westview High  School. \nIn  sum,  Defendants  cannot readily  allow personal posters  of rock bands  and  sports teams,  personal posters \npromoting a particular viewpoint on controversial political issues  such as  gay nghts  or global warming,  large  (35  to 40 \nfeet)  displays  of sacred Tibetan prayer flags,  and the host of other displays  and viewpoints permitted,  but then prohibit \nPlaintiff's  [*27]  patriotic banners,  which were  displayed without objection for 25  years,  without running afoul  of the \nFirst Amendment.  Whether the  classroom walls  are  a  \"designated public  forum,\"  a  \"limited public  forum,\"  or a \n\"nonpublic  forum\"  it makes  little  difference.  Defendants'  viewpoint-based restriction on Plaintiff's  speech violates the \nFirst Amendment. \nII. Pickering/Berry/Garcetti Do  Not Justify Defendants'  Speech Restriction. \nDefendants  improperly  eschew  any  forum analysis  in favor of applying the  \"balancing test\"  set forth in Pickering v. \nBoard of Educ.,  391  U.S.  563  (1968),  Berry v.  Department of Soc.  Serv.,  447 F.3d 642  (9th  Cir.  2006),  and Garcetti v. \nCeballos,  547  U.S.  410  (2006).  n11  Not only is this  error,  as noted previously,  but these  cases  are  inapplicable here \nbecause none  of them address  a  situation in which the  government has  opened a forum for certain expressive  activity, \nbut then prohibits  a speaker from expressing an appropriate message  in the  same  forum based on his viewpoint.  Indeed, \nthe Ninth Circuit did not rely on the Pickering balancing test to reach its  conclusion in Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified \nSch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003,  1010  (9th  Cir.  2000),  [*28]  a teacher speech case.  n12 \nnll  The Pickering test essentially  seeks to balance  \"the  interests  of the  [employee],  as  a citizen,  in commenting \nupon matters  of public  concern and the  interests  of the  State,  as  an employer,  in promoting the  efficiency  of the \npublic  services it performs through its  employees.\"  Connick v.  Myers,  461  U.S.  138,  140  (1983)  (quoting \nPickering,  391  U.S.  at 568). \nnl2  While  distinguishable  on its  facts, Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003  (9th  Cir.  2000), \ndemonstrates the  constitutional violation in this  case.  Downs upheld a  school  district's restriction on a teacher's \nability to  change the viewpoint expressed by the  school  district on its  \"Gay  and Lesbian Awareness\"  bulletin \nboards.  In Downs,  the Ninth Circuit held that the bulletin boards in question were nonpublic  forums  and that the \nspeech in question was government  speech made pursuant to  a  specific  school  district policy related to the  \"Gay \nand Lesbian Awareness Month.\"  The  court stated,  \"We  do not face  an example  of the government opening up  a \nforum for either unlimited or limited public  discussion,”  and explicitly found that  \"[t]he bulletin boards  served as \nan expressive vehicle  for the  school board's policy  of 'Educating  for Diversity.\" /d.  at 10/2.  Accordingly,  the \ncourt held that the  speech was  government  speech;  therefore,  viewpoint neutrality did not apply.  /d.  In this  case, \nthere  is no  dispute that the  speech at issue is Plaintiff's  speech,  so viewpoint neutrality  does  apply. \n[*29] \nSimilarly,  as noted previously,  Defendants’  reliance  on Berry v.  Department of Soc.  Serv.,  447 F.3d 642  (9th  Cir. \n2006),  is misplaced.  Indeed,  Defendants improperly  criticize  this  court for relying  on forum analysis  cases that they\nPage  10 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *29 \nclaim do not involve  \"a public  employer's limitation on an employee's  speech.\"  (Defs.'  Mem.  at 9).  However, Berry, \nwhich is  an  \"employee  speech\"  case,  did use  a forum  analysis when deciding whether or not the  employer's restriction \non the use  of its  facilities  for the  employee's  speech violated the First Amendment.  /d.  at 652-54.  n13  Because this  case \ninvolves the restriction on Plaintiff's use  of government facilities  for his personal,  non-curricular  speech, Berry confirms \nthat a forum analysis is proper. \nnl3  The Ninth Circuit applied the Pickering balancing test  \"to the Department's restriction on Mr.  Berry's  speech \nwith clients.\"  Berry,  447 F.3d at 652-54.  And with  scant analysis,  the  court upheld the restriction on the \nplaintiff's  \"Happy Birthday Jesus\"  sign and the  display  of his  Bible  in the  cubicle that he uses to  counsel  clients, \nclaiming  \"that the  Department's restrictions  on the  display  of religious items  are reasonable under the Pickering \nbalancing test.\" /d.  at 65/7.  Consequently,  the  court treated the  displays as an  extension  of the plaintiff's speech \nwith  the Department's  clients. \nUnlike the present case,  in Berry there was no  evidence  or argument that the  government created a forum \nfor the  cubicle  displays.  And the  court considered the restriction to be  one based on subject matter,  not \nviewpoint.  In this  case, Plaintiff's speech was personal,  non-curricular speech.  His banners were  displayed \npursuant to  a long-standing policy,  practice,  and/or custom of allowing teachers to  express personal, \nnon-curricular messages  on their classroom walls-a forum  opened by Defendants for this purpose.  The banners \nwere not displayed pursuant to  any  of his  official  duties  as  a teacher.  He  did not use them during  any  classroom \nsession or period of instruction.  They were not discussed or studied in any  of his  classes.  They  caused no \nmaterial  disruption or disorder in the  school.  They  did not interfere with the teaching  of his  classes.  They were \nnot expressing  a message  on behalf of the  School District.  And Defendants'  restriction was viewpoint based. \n(SOME  at PP 26-27,  60-63,  90,  98).  Neither Pickering nor Berry apply to these  facts. \n[*30] \nMoreover,  in its latest application of the Pickering test,  the  Supreme  Court in Garcetti  expressly  stated that its \nanalysis  did not apply in a  school  setting.  Garcetti,  547  U.S.  at 425;  Lee v.  York County Sch.  Divs.,  484 F.3d 687,  694 \nn.10  (4th  Cir.  2007)  (refusing to  apply  Garcetti in a case  involving teacher speech and instead applying Pickering in \nlight of circuit precedent and noting that if the teacher's  speech was not curriculum related,  then  school  officials  could \nnot regulate  it unless it  \"materially  and  substantially interfere[d]  with the requirements  of appropriate  discipline  in the \noperation of the  school\")  (quoting  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at 509). \nNevertheless,  even if this  court were to  apply  a Pickering balancing test to the  facts  of this  case,  Defendants’  speech \nrestriction would  still violate the  First Amendment.  The  on/y justification offered by Defendants  for the restriction is \nthat they believe the  Establishment Clause requires it.  This  claim does not  survive  even modest scrutiny.  Indeed, \nDefendants  assert that the  Constitution requires them to ban Plaintiff's personal patriotic  speech,  which  [*31]  Plaintiff \nexpressed without complaint for 25  years,  n14  because  of its viewpoint,  while  a science teacher's Buddhist speech 1s \nacceptable.  n15  This  assertion is untenable  and should be rejected.  See,  e.g.,  Widmar,  454  U.S.  at 273  (rejecting \nEstablishment Clause  \"defense\"  for speech restriction);  Rosenberger,  515  U.S.  at 841-42  (rejecting Establishment \nClause  \"defense\"  for  speech restriction);  Tucker v.  California Dep't of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204,  1212-13  (9th  Cir.  1996) \n(rejecting Establishment Clause  \"defense\"  for employee  speech restriction).  As  discussed more  fully in  Section III \nbelow,  Defendants’  speech restriction, which disfavors  Christianity,  but favors Buddhism,  violates the Establishment \nClause. \nnl4  See  Van  Orden  v.  Perry,  545  U.S.  677,  699,  702  (2005)  (Breyer,  J.,  concurring)  (finding the  fact that the \nTen Commandments monument was  on display  for 40 years without complaint  \"suggest[s]  more  strongly than\nPage  11 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *31 \ncan any  set of formulaic tests that few individuals,  whatever their system  of beliefs,  are likely to have \nunderstood the monument\"  as promoting religion). \n[*32] \nnl5  Defendants make the  outlandish claim that Plaintiff's patriotic messages  serve no valid  secular purpose  and \nare therefore  impermissible, but the  40-foot display  of sacred Tibetan prayer flags by  a science teacher in her \nclassroom are permissible because they  \"have the  secular purpose  of motivating her  students to  achieve lofty \ngoals,  like mountain climbers trying to reach Everest's  summit.\"  (Defs.'  Mem.  at 20).  Why is  it that Plaintiff's \nbanners  do not motivate  students to be patriotic  and to  love their country? \nAt the  end of the  day,  Defendants  are not interested in balancing  any interests  or closely  analyzing the  significant \nFirst Amendment interests  at stake.  They  simply-and incorrectly-label Plaintiff's  speech as  \"religious\"  and then \nerroneously  conclude that the  First Amendment (Free  Speech Clause) not only allows their viewpoint restriction,  but it \n(Establishment Clause) requires  it.  But see Board of Educ.  v. Mergens,  496  U.S.  226,  250  (1990)  (O'Connor,  J.)  (noting \nthe  \"crucial  difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the  Establishment  [*33]  Clause  forbids, \nand private  speech endorsing religion,  which the Free  Speech and Free Exercise  Clauses protect\").  However,  simply \nclaiming that the Establishment Clause requires this  speech restriction does not make it so.  Indeed,  it is time  for the \ncourts to put an end to this reflexive  (and thinly veiled hostility toward Christianity) response by government officials to \nanything that is remotely related to  (the  Christian) religion.  Defendants’  reliance  on this  shopworn excuse to ban the \ndisplay of Plaintiff's well-known,  historic patriotic phrases is patently incorrect.  n16  In fact,  the  School  District itself \ncould use  some  education regarding the  First Amendment.  As the Ninth Circuit stated in Hills v.  Scottsdale  Unified Sch. \nDist.  No.  48,  329 F.3d 1044,  1055  (9th  Cir.  2003),  \"We  agree with the  Seventh Circuit that the  desirable  approach is not \nfor  schools to throw up their hands because  of the possible misconceptions  about endorsement of religion, but that \ninstead it is  'far better to teach  students  about the  first amendment,  about the  difference between private  and public \naction,  about why we tolerate  divergent views.  The  school's proper response  is to  educate  [*34]  the  audience rather \nthan  squelch the  speaker.\"  (quoting Hedges v.  Wauconda  Cmty.  United Sch.  Dist.  No.  118,  9 F.3d 1295,  1299  (7th  Cir. \n1993))  (anternal punctuation omitted). \nn16  Consider this rhetorical  question:  could a  school  district justify  a practice  of firing  (or refusing to hire) \nChristian teachers based on the  simple  claim by  school  officials that this  employment practice was necessary  in \ntheir view to prevent an Establishment Clause violation? \nIll.  Defendants'  Restriction Violates  the  Establishment Clause. \nAs  an initial matter,  Defendants incorrectly  frame the  Establishment Clause  issue  as  follows:  \"Johnson contends \nthat Defendants have violated the  Establishment Clause  of both the  United  States  and California constitutions by \nattempting to  coerce him to  change his religious belief.\"  (Defs.'  Mem.  at  16).  Similarly,  Defendants’  anemic  evaluation \nof Plaintiff's  claim demonstrates  a misapprehension of the material  facts  and relevant law;  a misapprehension that \nevidently  [*35]  guided their illicit decision to ban Plaintiff's  speech in the  first instance. \nIn  1952,  the  United  States  Supreme  Court acknowledged the  following historical reality:  \"We  are  a religious people \nwhose  institutions presuppose  a Supreme Being.\"  Zorach  v.  Clauson,  343  U.S.  306,  313  (1952).  From at least  1789, \nthere has been an unbroken history  of official  acknowledgment by all three branches  of government of religion's role in \nAmerican life.  Examples  of this historical  acknowledgment include  Executive  Orders recognizing religiously grounded \nNational Holidays,  such as  Christmas  and Thanksgiving,  Congress  directing the  President to proclaim a National  Day of\nPage  12 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *35 \nPrayer each year,  and the printing  on our currency of the national motto,  \"In God We  Trust.\"  As the  United  States \nSupreme  Court acknowledged in Lynch v.  Donnelly,  465  U.S.  668,  677-78  (1984): \nOne  cannot look  at even this brief resume  [of historical  examples  of public religious  expression]  without \nfinding that our history is pervaded by expressions  of religious beliefs...  .  Equally pervasive  is the \nevidence  of accommodation of all  faiths  and all  forms  of religious  expression,  and hostility  [*36]  toward \nnone.  Through this  accommodation,  as  Justice  Douglas  observed,  governmental  action has  \"follow[ed] \nthe best of our traditions\"  and  \"respect[ed]  the religious nature  of our people.\"  (quoting Zorach,  343  U.S. \nat 314). \nRecognition of the role  of God in our Nation's history and heritage is  consistently reflected in  Supreme  Court \ndecisions.  The  Court has  acknowledged,  for example, that religion has been closely identified with our history  and \ngovernment,  and that the history of man is inseparable  from the history  of religion.  Examples  of patriotic  invocations  of \nGod and official  acknowledgments  of religion's role  in our Nation's history  abound.  As  Justice  O'Connor observed,  \"It \n1s unsurprising that a Nation founded by religious refugees  and dedicated to religious  freedom  should find references to \ndivinity in its  symbols,  songs,  mottoes,  and oaths.\" £/k Grove  Unified Sch.  Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  35-36  (2004) \n(O'Connor,  J.,  concurring). \nEfforts to  suppress this recognition and historical  acknowledgment are the  antithesis  of the value  of religious \ntolerance that underlies the  United  States  and California Constitutions.  And the  classroom  [*37]  is peculiarly the \n\"marketplace  of ideas.\"  As  a result,  the  First Amendment does not tolerate governmental policies,  practices,  and/or \ncustoms that cast a pall  of orthodoxy  over the  classroom,  such as  Defendants'  restriction,  which prohibits  Plaintiff from \ndisplaying his banners based on the  \"particular  sectarian viewpoint\"  conveyed by his message. \nA.  Defendants'  Restriction Disfavors  Religion. \nThroughout its  decisions,  the  Supreme  Court has  consistently  described the Establishment Clause  as  forbidding not \nonly  state  action motivated by  a desire to promote  or  \"advance\"  religion,  see,  e.g.,  County of Allegheny v.  A.C.L.U.,  492 \nU.S.  573,  592  (1989),  but also  actions that tend to  \"disapprove\"  of,  \"inhibit,\"  or evince  \"hostility\"  toward religion.  See \nEdwards v.  Aguillard,  482  U.S.  578,  585  (1987);  Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 673;  Committefeor  Pub.  Educ.  & Religious Liberty \nv.  Nyquist,  413  U.S.  756,  788  (1973). \nAs the  Supreme  Court noted in Epperson v.  Arkansas,  393  U.S.  97,  104  (1968),  \"The  First Amendment mandates \ngovernmental neutrality between religion and religion,  and between religion and nonreligion.  [*38]  \"  Indeed,  even \nsubtle  departures from neutrality  are prohibited.  See,  e.g.,  Church  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc.  v.  City of Hialeah, \nS08  U.S.  520,  534  (1993). \nIn School Dist.  of Abington  Township v.  Schempp,  374  U.S.  203  (1963),  the  Court stated,  \"We  agree  of course that \nthe  State may not establish a religion of secularism in the  sense  of affirmatively  opposing or showing hostility to \nreligion,  thus preferring those who believe in no religion over those who  do believe.\" /d.  at 225  (internal  quotations  and \ncitation omitted).  As Justice Breyer stated in his  concurrence  in  Van  Orden v.  Perry,  545  U.S.  677,  699  (2005),  \"[T]he \nEstablishment Clause  does not compel the  government to purge  from the public  sphere  all that in any way partakes  of \nthe religious.  Such absolutism is not only inconsistent with our national traditions,  but would also tend to promote the \nkind of social  conflict the  Establishment Clause  seeks to  avoid.\"  See  also  Church  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc.,  508 \nU.S.  at 532  (\"In our Establishment Clause  cases we have  often  stated the principle that the First Amendment forbids  an \nofficial  [*39]  purpose to  disapprove  of a particular religion or of religion in general.\"). \nThus,  a restriction that disfavors  \"religion in general\"-or worse,  one that disfavors  \"a particular sectarian \nviewpoint,\"  such as the restriction at issue here-violates the neutrality mandated by the  Establishment Clause. \nB.  Defendants'  Restriction Disfavors  a Particular Religion.\nPage  13 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *39 \nIn addition to mandating neutrality toward religion in general,  the First Amendment also  forbids hostility aimed at a \nspecific  faith (Christianity), particularly while  favoring  another (Buddhism).  \"The  clearest command of the \nEstablishment Clause  is that one religious  denomination cannot be  officially preferred over another.\"  Larson v.  Valente, \n456  U.S.  228,  244  (1982);  see also  County of Allegheny,  492  U.S.  at 608-09  (requiring  \"'strict scrutiny’  of practices \nsuggesting  'a denominational preference’);  Church  of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,  Inc,  508  U.S.  at 532  (\"[The \nEstablishment Clause]  forbids  an official purpose to  disapprove  of a  particular religion.\");  Epperson,  393  U.S.  at 103-04 \n(stating that the  government  \"may not be hostile to  any religion\");  [*40]  Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 673  (\"[The  Constitution] \nforbids hostility toward any\"  religion.).  \nRemarkably,  even though Plaintiff's  speech expressed messages that had historical  significance  and did not contain \nreligious text,  Defendants  censored the  speech because they  claimed that the banners  conveyed an impermissible \n\"Christian\"  viewpoint (while permitting Buddhist prayer flags,  no  less).  Leaving  aside the inaccuracy  of that claim, n17 \nDefendants violated the  Establishment Clause by  singling  out Plaintiff's  speech for disfavored treatment because they \nbelieved it conveyed  \"a particular  sectarian viewpoint.\" \nn17  Plaintiff's banners  contain historical,  patriotic phrases  and  slogans  central to  our Nation's history and \nheritage;  the banners  do not contain passages  from  Sacred Scripture  or other religious texts.  See,  e.g.,  Lynch,  465 \nU.S.  at 677-78;  Elk Grove  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  342  U.S.  at 35-36 (O'Connor,  J.,  concurring). \nC.  Defendants'  Speech Restriction  [*41]  Violates Lemon  and  Its  Modifications. \nDefendants’  speech restriction,  which disfavored  \"a particular sectarian viewpoint,”  violates the Establishment \nClause  as to its purpose  and effect.  And it creates  an impermissible  entanglement.  See Lemon  v.  Kurtzman,  403  U.S.  602 \n(1971). \n1.  The Purpose and  Effect of Defendants’  Restriction. \n\"The purpose prong of the Lemon test asks whether government's  actual purpose  is to  endorse  or disapprove  of \nreligion.  The  effect prong  asks whether,  irrespective  of government's  actual purpose,  the practice under review in fact \nconveys  a message  of endorsement or disapproval.  An affirmative  answer to  either question  should render the \nchallenged practice invalid.\"  See Lynch,  465  U.S.  at 690  (O'Connor J.,  concurring). \n\"While the  Court is normally  deferential to  a  State's  articulation of a secular purpose,  it is required that the \nstatement of such purpose be  sincere  and not a  sham.\" Edwards,  482  U.S.  at 586-87.  The  secular purpose requirement \n\"reminds  government that when it acts it should do  so without endorsing  [or disapproving  of]  a particular religious \nbelief or practice...  .\"  Wallace  v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  75-76  (1985).  [*42]  And  \"[t]he  eyes that look to purpose \nbelong to  an ‘objective  observer,’  one who takes  account of the traditional  external  signs that  show up in the text, \nlegislative history,  and implementation of the  statute  or comparable  official  act.\" McCreary County v.  A.C.L.U.,  545 \nU.S.  844,  862  (2005)  (internal  quotations  omitted). \nIn this  case,  Defendants’  stated purpose  for their official  act of removing Plaintiff's banners was to prohibit  speech \nthat,  in their view,  conveyed a  \"particular sectarian viewpoint,\"  that being  a  \"Christian\"  viewpoint.  This purpose  1s not \ncompelled by the  Establishment Clause;  rather,  it 1s prohibited by it. \nThe  \"effect\"  of Defendants’  restriction,  irrespective  of Defendants’  alleged  \"purpose\"  for enforcing it,  conveys  a \nmessage  of disapproval  of religion (and the  Christian religion in particular) in violation of the  Establishment Clause.  See \nLynch,  465  U.S.  at 690  (O'Connor J.,  concurring)  (\"The  effect prong asks whether,  irrespective  of government's  actual \npurpose,  the practice under review in fact conveys  a message  of endorsement or disapproval.\").  As the  Supreme  Court \nexplained,  when evaluating the  effect of government action  [*43]  under the  Establishment Clause,  courts must\nPage  14 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *43 \nascertain whether the  challenged action is  \"sufficiently likely to  be perceived\" as  a disapproval  of religion.  County of \nAllegheny,  492  U.S.  at 597 (citations  omitted)  (emphasis  added);  Santa Fe Indep.  Sch.  Dist.  v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  307, \nn.21  (2000)  (\"[T]he  Establishment Clause  forbids  a State to hide behind the  application of formally neutral  criteria and \nremain  studiously oblivious to the  effects  of its  actions.\").  The  clear effect of the  speech restriction 1s to  show \ndisapproval  of religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. \n2.  Defendants'  Restriction  Fosters  an  Excessive  Entanglement. \nThe third prong  of the Lemon test asks whether the restriction at issue  excessively  entangles  government with \nreligion.  Lemon,  403  U.S.  at 612-13.  In  Widmar v.  Vincent,  the  Supreme  Court explained:  \"[T]he University would nsk \ngreater ‘entanglement’  by  attempting to  enforce  its  exclusion of 'religious worship’  and ‘religious  speech.’  Initially, the \nUniversity would need to  determine which words  and activities  fall within 'religious worship  and religious teaching. \nThis  alone  [*44]  could prove  an impossible task in an age where many and various beliefs meet the  constitutional \ndefinition of religion.\"  Widmar,  454  U.S.  at 272 n./11.  (internal  quotations  and citations  omitted).  Accordingly, \nDefendants'  attempt to  exclude  speech expressing  a  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  viewpoint (while permitting \n\"Buddhist\"  speech)  creates  \"excessive  entanglement\"  in violation of the Establishment Clause. \nIV.  Defendants Violated  the California  Constitution. \nA.  State Free  Speech Claim. \nArticle  1,  section 2  of the  California Constitution generally provides broader protection for the  exercise  of free \nspeech rights than the  First Amendment.  Robins v.  Pruneyard Shopping Ctr.,  23  Cal.  3d 899  (1979).  However,  federal \nlaw is typically followed for free  speech claims  arising in a school  setting.  See  California  Teachers Ass'n  v.  Governing \nBd.  of San Diego  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  45  Cal.  App.  4th  1383,  1391  (1996)  (\"[W]e  find the  federal  authorities which \ndiscuss First Amendment principles  in the  fairly unique  context of school regulation of curricular activities  accurately \nweigh the  competing interests  of school  administrators,  [*45]  teachers  and  students.\").  Thus,  for the reasons  stated \nwith regard to the First Amendment,  Defendants have  similarly violated the  California Constitution. \nB.  California  Establishment Clause and  No  Preference Clause Violations. \n1.  California Establishment Clause. \nThe  California courts generally  adopt the  federal Establishment Clause  analysis when considering  cases under the \nCalifornia Constitution's  similar provision.  See Paulson v.  Abdelnour,  145 Cal. App.  4th  400,  420  (2006)  (\"The \nconstruction given by California courts to the  establishment clause  of article  I,  section 4,  is guided by  decisions  of the \nUnited  States  Supreme  Court.\").  Accordingly,  the previous  analysis under the  federal Establishment Clause \ndemonstrates why Defendants' restriction also violates the  California Constitution. \n2.  California No  Preference  Clause. \nThe Ninth Circuit has  interpreted the  California No  Preference  Clause  \"to  stand for the proposition that not only \nmay  a government body not prefer one religion over another,  it may not appear to be  acting preferentially.\"  E/lis v.  City \nof La Mesa,  990 F.2d 1518,  1524  (9th  Cir.  1993)  (citation and quotations  [*46]  omitted).  In this  case,  it is  evident that \nDefendants’  restriction,  which  singled out  \"Christian\"  or  \"Judeo/Christian\"  speech for disfavored treatment while \npermitting  speech conveying  other religious views, violates  California's No  Preference  Clause. \nV.  Defendants'  Viewpoint Restriction Violates  the  Equal Protection Clause. \nDefendants misapprehend the nature  of Plaintiff's  equal protection claim.  The relevant principle  of law was \narticulated in Police Dept.  of the  City of Chicago  v.  Mosley,  408  U.S.  92  (1972).  In Mosley,  the  Court struck  down a  city \nordinance that prohibited all picketing within  150  feet of a school,  except peaceful picketing  of any  school involved in a\nPage  15 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *46 \nlabor dispute.  The  Court stated,  \"[U]nder the  Equal Protection Clause,  not to mention the  First Amendment itself, \ngovernment may not grant the use  of a forum to people whose views it finds  acceptable,  but deny use to those wishing \nto  express  less  favored or more  controversial views.\"  See  also  Carey v.  Brown,  447  U.S.  455,  461-62  (1980).  Here, \nDefendants  opened up  a forum for teacher expression.  Having maintained this  forum for many  decades,  Defendants \nviolated Plaintiff's  [*47]  rights when they prohibited his  speech based on the viewpoint of his message, while \npermitting other teachers to  continue their speech in the  same  forum unfettered. \nVI.  The  Individual Defendants Do  Not Enjoy Qualified  Immunity. \n\"When government officials  abuse their offices,  'action[s]  for damages may  offer the  only realistic  avenue  for \nvindication of constitutional guarantees.\" Anderson v.  Creighton,  483  U.S.  635,  638  (1987)  (citation omitted).  In \nHarlow  y.  Fitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800  (1982),  the  Supreme  Court held that government officials  are protected from \npersonal liability  for civil  damages  only  so long  as their conduct does not violate  \"clearly  established  statutory  or \nconstitutional rights  of which a reasonable person would have known.\" /d.  at 8/8.  \"This is not to  say that an official \naction is protected by  qualified immunity unless the very  action in question has been previously held unlawful,  but it 1s \nto  say that in light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be  apparent.\" Anderson,  483  U.S.  at 640 (citation omitted); \nOsolinski v.  Kane,  92 F.3d 934,  936 (9th  Cir.  1996)  (\"Absent  [*48]  binding precedent,  we  look to  all  available \ndecisional law,  including the  law  of other circuits  and district courts,  to  determine whether the right was  clearly \nestablished.  We  also  evaluate the  likelihood that this  circuit or the  Supreme  Court would have reached the  same \nresult.\"); Mendoza v.  Block,  27 F.3d 1357,  1361  (9th  Cir.  1994)  (\"[W]hen 'the  defendants’  conduct is  so patently \nviolative  of the  constitutional nght that reasonable  officials would know without guidance  from the  courts that the \naction was unconstitutional,  closely  analogous pre-existing case  law is not required to  show that the law is  clearly \nestablished.\")  (citation omitted). \nPlaintiff's nght to  engage  in his  speech free  from viewpoint discrimination was  clearly  established.  Consequently, \nthe  individual  defendants  do not enjoy qualified immunity,  and Plaintiff is  entitled to nominal  damages  as  a matter of \nlaw.  See  Carey v.  Piphus,  435  U.S.  247,  266-67 (1978);  Floyd v.  Laws,  929 F.2d 1390  (9th  Cir.  1991). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the  foregoing reasons  and for those  stated in Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Doc.  No.  43),  Plaintiff \nrespectfully requests  [*49]  that this  court deny Defendants’  motion. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nTHOMAS  MORE LAW CENTER \nBy:  /s/ Robert J.  Muise \nRobert J.  Muise,  Esq.  * \nAdmitted pro  hac vice \nCharles  S.  LiMandri,  Esq. \nCounsel for Plaintiff Bradley Johnson \nPLAINTIFF'S  RESPONSE  TO DEFENDANTS'  STATEMENT  OF UNDISPUTED  MATERIAL  FACTS \nPursuant to Local  Rule  7.1,  Plaintiff Bradley Johnson hereby responds to  Defendants'  Separate  Statement of \nUndisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion for  Summary Judgment (Doc.  No.  55).  In this response,  \"SOMEF\"  refers \nto  Plaintiff's  Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment and associated \nexhibits,  which were previously  filed in this matter (Doc Nos.  43  through  54). \n1.  Bradley Johnson 1s  a high school mathematics teacher,  currently teaching  at Westview High  School,  which is\nPage  16 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *49 \noperated by the Poway Unified  School District  [hereinafter  \"School  District\"]. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at PP  1-4). \n2.  Johnson is  a Christian,  and has taught with the  District for 30 years. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at P  1). \n3.  Johnson is  [*50]  currently the  adviser for the  Christian club  at Westview,  and has held that role  since  2005. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts. \n4.  Johnson was previously a Christian club  advisor at schools where he taught previously. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts. \n5.  Johnson prominently  displayed two banners  in his  classroom during Fall,  2006.  Both banners were  7  feet long by \n2  feet wide,  and were  \"displayed in a non-obstructive manner.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts;  however,  he  objects to  Defendants’  characterization that the \nbanners were  \"prominently\"  displayed.  True  and accurate photographs  of Plaintiff's banners  and how they were \ndisplayed can be  found at  SOMF  PP 20,  68,  70,  72-74  and the  corresponding  attached exhibits,  specifically Exhibit B  to \nJohnson's  declaration at Exhibit  1.  Moreover,  Plaintiff displayed his banners not just during the Fall  of 2006;  he had \ncontinuously  displayed his banners in the  School District for approximately 25  years.  (See  SOMF  at PP 20,  21,  68-72). \n6.  The  first banner had red,  white  and blue  stripes,  and was  emblazoned with the  following messages  in large block \nletters:  [*51]  \"INGOD  WE  TRUST\";  \"ONE NATION UNDER GOD\";  \"GOD  BLESS  AMERICA\";  and  \"GOD \nSHED  HIS  GRACE ON  THEE.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts;  however,  he  objects to  Defendants'  characterization of how the \nmessage was  displayed.  See response to P  5  above. \n7.  The phrase  \"In God We  Trust\"  1s the  official motto  of the United States. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute this  fact.  (See  SOMF  at PP  79-81). \n8.  The phrase  \"One Nation Under God\"  may be  found in the Pledge  of Allegiance. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the phrase  \"One Nation Under God\"  is in the Pledge  of \nAllegiance, which is recited daily in the  School District.  (See  SOMF  at PP  82,  83). \n9.  The phrase  \"God Bless America\"  is  a reference to the  song  of the  same title written by  Irving Berlin in the  early \n20th Century. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts,  and notes that the  song,  \"God Bless  America,\"  is not a religious \nsong;  it is  a well-known patriotic  song.  Additionally,  this phrase is  commonly used in  speeches by the President of the \nUnited  States.  (See  SOMF  at PP  85,  86). \n10.  The phrase  \"God  Shed His  Grace  On Thee\"  is  a  [*52]  reference  from the  song,  \"America the  Beautiful.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute this  fact,  and notes that the  song,  \"America the Beautiful,\"  is not a religious \nsong;  it is  a well-known patriotic  song.  (See  SOMF  at P  88). \n11.  Mr.  Johnson has had the  striped banner with four phrases  or one  like  1t hanging in his  classroom  since  1982.\nPage  17 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *52 \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at PP  70,  71). \n12.  The  second banner reads  in large  font:  \"All Men Are  Created Equal,  They Are Endowed By  Their CREATOR.\" \nThis phrase  1s  a misquote  from the preamble to the  Declaration of Independence,  which  states,  in part:  \"We hold these \ntruths to be  self-evident,  that all  men are created  equal,  that they  are  endowed  by  their Creator with certain \nunalienable  Rights,  that among these  are  Life,  Liberty  and the pursuit of Happiness.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that this phrase  is  a quote  from the Declaration of Independence. \nHowever,  Defendants’  claim that it is  a  \"misquote\"  is  incorrect-the  quote reads  on the banner as  follows:  first line,  \"All \nMen Are  Created Equal\";  second line,  \"They Are Endowed By  Their\";  and third  [*53]  line,  \"Creator.\"  Thus,  the word \n\"that\"  was purposefully left out between the  first and  second printed lines because  it makes the  quote read more  easily. \n(See  SOMF  at PP 38,  72,  84). \n13.  The word  \"Creator\"  on the  \"Declaration\"  banner 1s in ALL  CAPS  typeface  about twice the  size  of the  other \nwords  on the banner,  which are in Initial  Caps;  the word  \"CREATOR\"  also  occupies its  own line  of text. \nResponse:  Plaintiff generally disputes Defendants’  characterization of the banner and refers the  court to the \nphotographs  of the banner for an accurate  depiction of how the banner looks.  See response to P  5  above.  Moreover,  this \nbanner was  displayed  separate  from the  other banner,  and it was  displayed amongst numerous pictures  depicting nature \nscenes.  (See  SOMF  at P  72). \n14.  Johnson designed the layout of the  \"Declaration\"  banner  so that the word  \"CREATOR\"  would be larger so that \nhe  could highlight that there was  a supreme being who provided men with the rights  described in the preamble to the \nDeclaration of Independence. \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes  Defendants’  characterization of the purpose  for the layout of the banner and asserts \nthat he was highlighting what  [*54]  our Founding lathers  said in this historical  document,  which  serves  as  a founding \ndocument for our Nation.  (See  SOMF  at P  84;  Johnson Dep.  at  103,  Ex.  F  to  Defs.'  Mot.  (Doc.  No.  55)). \n15.  Johnson had his  \"Declaration\"  banner made  in  1989,  and has  displayed it thereafter in his  classroom. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at P  72). \n16.  Johnson explained that the purpose  of the two banners  1s  for  \"celebrat[ing]  our national heritage,\" \n\"highlight[ing]  the religious heritage  and nature  of our nation that we have  as  a foundation\"  and  \"espousing God as \nopposed to no  God  .  .  .  but not any particular God.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes this  characterization of Plaintiff's purpose  for the banners  in that it is misleading.  In \nhis  deposition,  Plaintiff clearly  stated,  \"These  are historical patriotic  expressions  and mottos,  and I’m  highlighting that. \nThe people who wrote them had a -  some religious background.  I  don't know what it was,  and I'm not intending to \nhighlight or promote  any  of that kind of religious background because  I  don't know what it was.  I'm trying to highlight \nthe religious heritage  and nature  of our nation,  [*55]  that we have that as  a foundation.\"  (Johnson Dep.  at  103,  Ex.  F to \nDefs.'  Mot.  (Doc.  No.  55))  (emphasis  added).  Regarding the  \"espousing  God as  opposed to no  God  .  .  .  but not any \nparticular God,\"  it is  evident in his  deposition that Plaintiff is pointing out the  obvious  fact that in these historical \nphrases,  and in particular,  the phrase  from the  Pledge  of Allegiance,  there is reference to  \"God,\"  as  opposed to no \nreference  of \"God,\"  and this reference is not to  any particular  \"God,\"  (see Johnson Dep.  at 95,  Ex.  F  to Defs.'  Mot.  (Doc. \nNo.  55)),  which would be unlike  Lori Brickley's  Tibetan prayer flags,  which  specifically reference Buddha (and display \nan image  of this  \"supreme\"  being  of Buddhism).  The  School District has no  objection to the posting of these prayer \nflags.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54). \n17.  Both banners were  located on walls  in Johnson's  classroom where they  can be  easily  seen and read from where \nstudents  sit in Johnson's  classroom.\nPage  18 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *55 \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute that his banners were posted on his  classroom walls  and that  students,  faculty, \nadministrators,  including principals  and assistant principals, parents,  and others who  came into his  classroom  [*56] \nover the past 25 years  could  see them,  along with all  of the  other items  displayed on his walls.  This  is  depicted in the \nphotographs  of Plaintiff's banners.  See response to P  5  above.  (See  SOMF  at PP 20,  29-31,  89). \n18.  Defendant William  Chiment serves  as the  School's Associate  Superintendent for Personnel  Support Services, \nand has been in that position for ten years. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at  13-15). \n19.  According to  Chiment,  the  District's  informal practice  1s to permit teachers to  decorate their classrooms with \npersonal items  such as posters,  flags,  or banners,  within  some  limits. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District has  created a forum for teacher  speech. \nHowever,  Plaintiff objects to  its  characterization as  an  \"informal practice,\"  since this has been the  longstanding practice \nof the  School District for at least 30 years.  (See  SOMF  at PP  35-62). \n20.  But teachers’  personal items  cannot violate the  School's  anti-harassment policy. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the law permits the  School District to  limit certain  subject matter \nof speech,  [*57]  and should speech  \"materially  and substantially  disrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school\"  or \n\"incite to  imminent lawless  action,\"  it can be proscribed under the law. \n21.  Some  of the  other limits the  School may  also take  into  consideration are the  size  of the  item, the  age \nappropriateness  of the particular item for the  students in the  classroom,  and the potential relationship to the  curriculum. \nResponse:  Plaintiff generally disputes these  facts.  The  School District imposes no  size  limits  on the personal \nexpressive items that teachers  are permitted to  display.  Plaintiff acknowledges that if the  size  of a displayed item causes \nit to be  obstructive,  then size  could be  an appropriate basis  for limiting the  speech.  However,  Plaintiff's banners,  as \nDefendants  acknowledge,  were  displayed in a non-obstructive manner.  Moreover,  there were personal  items that were \npermitted to be  displayed that were  significantly larger than Plaintiff's banners.  And pursuant to  School District policy, \npractice,  and/or custom,  teachers  are permitted to  display personal  items that are unrelated to the  curriculum.  Here, \nPlaintiff's banners were  similar in size  (and even  smaller) than other displays  [*58]  that were permitted;  the banners \nwere  displayed in a non-obstructive manner;  and they were non-curricular.  See response to P 20  above.  Plaintiff's  facts \nare  confirmed by the  School District,  and thus undisputed.  (See  SOMF  at PP 35-62). \n22.  For example, teachers  could exhibit family photographs,  but photographs  of a family drinking alcohol heavily \nwould not be permitted by the  School. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the law permits the  School District to  limit certain  subject matter \nof speech,  such as  speech that promotes  illegal  drug use  (or underage  alcohol  consumption).  And  should  speech \n\"materially  and  substantially  disrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school\"  or  \"incite to  imminent lawless  action,\"  1t can \nbe proscribed under the  law.  Nonetheless,  Plaintiff objects to this hypothetical  situation as  \"fact\"  in this  case.  (See,  e.g., \nSOME  at P 42). \n23.  The  School  also has  a formal written policy regarding the teaching of controversial issues,  which governs what \nteachers  can post on their classroom walls. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District has  a policy governing the  teaching of \ncontroversial  [*59]  issues;  however,  this policy,  on its  face,  does not address the  display of personal, non-curriculum \nrelated messages,  and it 1s  certainly not applied in an evenhanded manner since there  are numerous  \"controversial\" \npersonal items  (e.g.,  posters  addressing global warming,  gay rights,  etc.)  displayed by teachers that the  School District\nPage  19 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *59 \npermits.  By its  own terms, the  \"controversial  issues\"  policy  addresses the  \"study or discussion\"  of issues that are \n\"controversial.\"  The policy  defines  a  \"controversial issue\"  as  follows:  \"An issue  1s  controversial when the question  is \ndebatable and when some of the proposed solutions conflict with the intellectual  or emotional  commitments  of citizens \nto  cherished interests,  beliefs,  or group loyalties.\"  Consequently, this policy does not apply here:  Plaintiff's banners  do \nnot meet the  definition of a  \"controversial  issue\"  in the  first instance,  and the banners were never part of any  \"study  or \ndiscussion\"  in his  classes.  Indeed,  the  discriminatory way in which Defendants  seek to  apply this policy  demonstrates \nthat it was  a mere pretext for banning personal viewpoints that school  officials  dislike.  [*60]  In sum,  couching an \nofficial act in terms of a  \"policy\"  does not immunize the act from constitutional scrutiny.  (See  SOMF  at PP 26,  27, \n35-63,  90,  98,  99). \n24.  Poway Board Policy BP  3.11,  provides,  in part,  that teachers must  \"exercise  caution and discretion when \ndeciding whether or not a particular issue is  suitable  for  study  or discussion in any particular class.[\"] \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the board policy  states what is represented here by Defendants. \nHowever, this policy does not apply because  Plaintiff was not using his banners  \"for study or discussion in any \nparticular class.\"  See response to  P 23  above. \n25.  Poway Board Policy  3.11  policy  also  \"requires teachers to  ensure that all  sides  of a controversial issue  are \nimpartially presented with adequate  and appropriate  factual information\"  and  \"[w]ithout promoting  any partisan point of \nview.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the board policy  states what is represented here by Defendants. \nHowever, this policy does not apply to Plaintiff's banners,  and it is  certainly not applied in an evenhanded manner since \nit is undisputed that Defendants permit  [*61]  numerous  \"controversial\"  personal items to be  displayed in the  classroom \nthat do not  \"ensure that all  sides  of a controversial issue  are impartially presented\"  and that do promote  \"partisan points \nof view.\"  This  court need look no  further than Ms.  Lori Brickley's  science  classroom to  see that,  if anything,  Defendants \nare misusing the policy to  silence viewpoints that they  dislike  in a forum the  School District created for personal, \nnon-curricular teacher speech.  Indeed,  the  School  District even permits  Ms.  Brickley to  engage  in a pro-gray \ndemonstration (\"day  of silence\")  on  school property  during the  school  day  alongside  student participants.  See response \nto  P 23  above.  (See also  SOMF  at P  65). \n26.  BP  3.11  has  an attendant Administrative Procedure,  entitled AP  3.11.2, that contains  a section concerning the \n\"Responsibilities  of Teachers.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute this  fact.  However,  this procedure  does not apply in this  case  and is thus not \nmaterial.  See responses to  PP 23,  25  above. \n27.  Those responsibilities include  \"choos[ing]  suitable  and useful  instructional materials,\" \"direct[ing]  class \ndiscussion to  cover all points  of [*62]  view,  distinguish[ing]  between teaching  and advocating,  and refrainfing] from \nusing classroom teacher influence to promote partisan  or sectarian  viewpoints.\"  (Plaintiff's partial  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District procedure  states what is represented here by \nDefendants.  However,  this procedure  does not apply in this  case  and is thus not material.  See responses to PP 23,  25 \nabove. \n28.  A.P.  3.11.2  also has  a  section on the rights  of students,  and expressly gives  students the  \"right to  form and \nexpress individual  opinions  on controversial issues without jeopardizing relations with teachers  or others.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District procedure  states what is represented here by \nDefendants.  However,  this procedure  does not apply in this  case  and is thus not material.  See responses to PP 23,  25 \nabove.\nPage 20 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *62 \n29.  AP  3.11.2  also has  a  section entitled  \"The  Selection of Issues.\"  Within that section,  the policy  states that in \ngeneral,  \"the  decision as to whether a controversial issue  should become  a matter of school study  should be based upon\" \nten listed criteria,  [*63]  including  \"1.  It must contribute  significantly to the  objectives of the curriculum;  ...  6.  The \nissue must involve  alternate points  of view which can be understood and defined by  students;  7.  The issue must be  one \nabout which information is present and available  so alternatives  can be  discussed and evaluated on a factual  and \nreasonable basis;  .  ..  and  10.  The  issue must provide  opportunity  for critical thinking for the  development of tolerance \nand the understanding  of conflicting points  of view,  at the  same time that 1t contributes to  the prescribed course of \nstudy and the general  educational program of the school.\"  (Plaintiff's  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District procedure  states what is represented here by \nDefendants.  However,  this procedure  does not apply in this  case  and is thus not material.  See responses to PP 23,  25 \nabove. \n30.  Even non-curricular items  are part of the learning  environment and potentially advocating,  and therefore  such \nitems  (sic)  subject to this written policy. \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes this  fact,  particularly insofar as Defendants  seek to  (mis)apply  [*64]  this policy to the \npersonal,  non-curricular items  displayed by teachers in the  forum  created by the  School District,  such as  Defendants \napplication of this policy to  silence Plaintiff's viewpoint on a permissible  subject matter.  See responses to  PP 23,  25 \nabove. \n31.  Sometimes the  School receives  complaints  from parents  about only  one  side  of an issue being taught,  and the \nSchool works with principals to  ensure that teachers  are teaching both sides  of an issue.  (Plaintiff's  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  However,  they are not material.  Plaintiff does not use his banners \nwhen teaching any of his  classes,  as  Defendants  admit.  (See  SOMF  at P 26,  27,  60-63,  90,  98). \n32.  In addition,  it is  Chiment's position that expression of religion within the District is proscribed by the law  of the \nU.S.  and  State  constitutions. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Chiment holds this  opinion,  which is  contrary to \nclearly  established constitutional law. \n33.  Chiment believes that the  District's policies  and procedures  are  consistent with the U.S.  and  State  constitutions. \nResponse:  Plaintiff [*65]  does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Chiment holds this  opinion, which is  incorrect. \nHowever, this  opinion 1s not a fact,  and it is not relevant.  In this  case,  Defendant Chiment violated clearly  established \nconstitutional rights  of which a reasonable person would have known. \n34.  Dawn Kastner  serves  as the Principal  at Westview high School,  and has been in that position  since  July  1,  2006. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at P  16). \n35.  Early in her tenure  as principal  (sometime in Fall  2006),  Mr.  Subbiah,  a Westview teacher,  raised a concern \nwith Kastner about why Johnson was permitted to have those  signs in his room;  Kastner also heard about the banners \nfrom a student and another teacher.  So  Kastner went into  Johnson's  classroom and  saw the banners  for the  first time. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that this  1s what Defendant Kastner testified to  in her deposition. \nHowever,  it is not credible that Defendant Kastner,  who was the  assistant principal  of Westview High  School for an \nentire year prior to becoming principal,  would on one hand say that the  signs were  so  large that they are hard to miss, \nbut  [*66]  on the  other claim that  she  did not see them (or hear of them,  including any complaints  about them,  as  an \nadministrator) until the Fall  of 2006,  an entire year later.  (See  SOMF  at P  16;  Kastner Dep.  at  12,  Ex.  4).  Nonetheless,\nPage 21 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *66 \nthis  does not justify the viewpoint-based restriction on Plaintiff's  speech,  which did not  \"materially  and  substantially \ndisrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school.\"  (See  SOMF  at P  31,  66,  98,  99). \n36.  Kastner was  concermed that the banners were very large,  and inappropriately promoted a viewpoint advocating \nGod,  as the phrases were pulled out of their original  context.  (Plaintiff's  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner imposed a viewpoint-based restriction on \nPlaintiff's  speech (claiming that Plaintiff's banners  expressed a  \"Christian\"  viewpoint).  Moreover,  the  School  District \ndoes not require  \"full  context,\"  whatever that might mean,  for the  quotes  displayed by teachers  on their classroom walls. \nFor example,  the  School District permitted the  display  of numerous personal  items that contained only partial  quotes \nfrom  the  very documents  that Plaintiff quoted.  In  sum,  Plaintiff does  [*67]  not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner \nmay have had  \"concerns\";  however,  these  concerns were unfounded in light of the  facts  and controlling law.  (See \nSOMF  at PP  38,  92,  96). \n37.  Kastner met with Johnson to  discuss his banner.  Kastner told Johnson that taking the phrases  concerning  God \nand putting them together in large print out of context was moving  away  from  a patriotic  comment to promotion of his \nreligious beliefs that might make  some  student uncomfortable. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner met with him and informed him that his \npersonal banners had to be removed because,  according to Defendant Kastner,  the banners promoted a  \"Christian\" \nviewpoint.  Plaintiff disputes the  facts that his  display  of well-known historical  and patriotic phrases  and  slogans were \n\"out of context\"  and that they promote his  Christian religion.  (See  SOMF  at PP  68-88,  92,  96). \n38.  Kastner suggested to  Johnson that an Islamic  student walking into the  classroom may  feel bad,  and feel like he \nor she would not fit in;  Johnson replied  something to the  effect of \"sometimes that's necessary.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that  [*68]  Defendant Kastner  suggested to him that an Islamic  student \nmight not like  (or might be uncomfortable with)  our national motto  or  some  of the  other patriotic  slogans  or historical \nphrases that were  displayed.  Plaintiff's response reflects the  fact that you can't change this historic reality,  nor is  it \nproper to  deny it. \n39.  Johnson explained to Kastner that he  felt strongly that he needed the  signs to  stay up,  that he had a night to have \nthe banners up,  and that he'd had them up  for a long time. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at P  101). \nAO.  Kastner suggested to  Johnson that he put the phrases  on the banners  in context,  such as posting the  entire \nDeclaration of Independence. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner made this  odd suggestion (students know the \ncontext of the  quotes;  there  is no need for extra  \"context\").  Moreover,  Plaintiff responded by  stating that he would have \nno problem with putting up  alongside his banners  a copy  of the Declaration of Independence.  Defendants rejected his \nsuggestion.  (See  SOME  at P  78;  see  also  Johnson Decl.  at P  3  at Ex.  1,  attached to this response). \n41.  [*69]  Kastner also  suggested to Johnson that he reduce the  scale  of the banners to  \"something  small  around the \ndesk  area.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner was  asking him to make his banners  smaller, \nthus reducing his  speech.  However,  the  School  District does not impose this  speech restriction on any of the  other \nteachers.  Indeed,  Defendants permit a 35  to  40-foot display of Tibetan prayer flags.  (See  SOME  at PP 41-50,  53,  54, \n57).\nPage 22 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *69 \n42.  Kastner contacted Melavel  Robertson (Assistant Superintendent for Learning  Support Services)  for guidance  on \nthese  \"really big\"  signs. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Kastner contacted Ms.  Robertson.  However,  Plaintiff \ndoes  dispute Defendant Kastner's  characterization of Plaintiff's banners  as  \"really big.\"  Moreover,  this \nmischaracterization is not material  since there  are no  size  limits  imposed on other teacher speech,  and Plaintiff \ndisplayed his banners in a manner that was non-obstructive.  See responses to PP  5,  21  above.  (See  SOMF  at P  57). \n43.  Kastner's  secretary took pictures  of the banners  and  sent them to  Robertson. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does  [*70]  not dispute these  facts. \n44.  Robertson was  concerned with the  size  of the banners;  she  felt that students  of different faiths may  feel \nuncomfortable with a banner that large,  and this was  discussed amongst the  School's  cabinet-level  administrators. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Ms.  Robertson had concerns  about Plaintiff's banners  and the \nviewpoint expressed by them.  However,  her concerns  about the  size  are  irrelevant  since the  School  District imposes no \nsize restrictions  on other teachers.  Additionally,  Defendants  (including the  \"cabinet-level  administrators\")  apparently \nhad little  \"concern\"  about the  35  to  40-foot string of Tibetan prayer flags that are  allowed to be  displayed in Ms. \nBrickley's  classroom,  along with all  of her partisan political messages  on controversial issues  such as  global warming, \ngay rights,  and zero population growth.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54,  57). \n45.  Robertson referred Kastner to  speak with Mr.  Chiment,  as  Chiment is the person within the  School to  deal with \npersonnel  concerns that might raise  legal  issues. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts. \n46.  Mr.  Chiment spoke with Kastner and reviewed photographs  [*71]  of the banners  in Mr.  Johnson's  classroom. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendants  Chiment and Kastner reviewed photographs  of \nPlaintiff's banners,  and would add that Defendant Chiment never went into Plaintiff's  classroom to view the banners in \nfull  context before  ordering Plaintiff to remove them.  (See  Chiment Dep.  at 32  at Ex.  3  to  SOMF). \n47.  Ultimately,  the  decision to have Mr.  Johnson remove his banners was made by Mr.  Chiment. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute this  fact;  however, this  decision was  approved and ratified by all  Defendants, \nwho remain liable  for it.  (See  SOMF  at PP  9,  12,  15,  18). \n48.  This  decision was  agreed to by the  Superintendent's  cabinet,  which consists  of Defendant Donald Philips \n(Superintendents)  (sic),  and the Deputy  Superintendent,  John Collins,  Chiment,  and the  assistant superintendents. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute these  facts.  (See  SOMF  at P  97). \n49.  Mr.  Chiment asked Mr.  Johnson by telephone to remove his banners  on or about January  19,  2007. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute this  fact. \n50.  Mr.  Chiment sent a letter to Johnson dated January 23,  2007, to  [*72]  confirm the  decision to have Johnson \nremove his banners,  and to provide the legal basis  for the  decision in writing. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Chiment sent the January 23,  2007 letter, which \naffirmed the undisputed fact that the  School District was restricting Plaintiff's  speech based on its viewpoint.  Insofar as \nit was  a  \"legal basis,\"  Plaintiff disputes this  opinion since the  \"legal basis\"  violates  clearly established constitutional\nPage 23 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *72 \nrights  of which a reasonable person would have known.  (See  SOMF  at PP  93-95). \n51.  Referring to the two banners,  the January 23  letter  states that  \"[t]he prominent display of these brief and narrow \nselections  of text from documents  and  songs without the benefit of any context and of a motto,  all which include the \nword 'God'  or 'Creator'  has the  effect of using your influence  as  a teacher to promote  a  sectarian viewpoint.\" \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the letter  states what Defendants represent here.  (See  SOMF  at PP \n93-95). \n52.  The  January 23  letter expressly notes the prohibitions  in California Education Code  section  51511  and AR \n3.11.2  as  grounds  for the  School's  [*73]  position. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendants  cited various policies  in the January 23,  2007,  letter as \npretext/bases  for their unconstitutional viewpoint-based restriction on Plaintiff's personal, non-curricular speech.  See \nresponses to  PP 23,  25  above.  (See  SOMF  at PP  93-95). \n53.  Chiment has  explained that the reason Johnson was  asked to remove his banners  is because they violate District \npolicy  and procedure,  consistent with the  California and U.S.  Constitutions  and California Education Code. \nSpecifically,  the banners  advocated a particular religious viewpoint over non-religion (atheism and agnosticsism),  and \nthey  also  advocated  \"God\"  over other religions that do not use the word  \"God\"  for a supreme being  (such as Yahweh or \nAllah,  for example). \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes these  facts  and legal  conclusions  couched as  facts.  Insofar as  any policy,  practice,  or \nprocedure  of government is used as  a basis  for engaging in an official  act or for making  an official  decision that violates \nfundamental principles  of constitutional law,  such as the  act and decision of ordering Plaintiff to remove his banners \nbased on the viewpoint of [*74]  his  speech,  that official  act or decision 1s unconstitutional,  regardless  of the \nself-serving  \"explanation\"  of the  official responsible  for the  act or decision.  (See  SOMF  at PP 93-95). \n54.  Although religion  is not a category of items prohibited from classroom walls,  the District may prohibit \nreligious viewpoints where the teacher appears to be teaching  or advocating  a religious viewpoint  separate  from a \ncurricular context.  (Plaintiff's  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  assertion that  \"religion  [albeit,  certain religions]  1s not a category of items \nprohibited from classroom walls,”  particularly  since  Defendants permit  speech 1n this  forum that promotes the Buddhist \nreligion.  However,  Plaintiff objects to this incomplete  \"fact\"  in that it 1s  essentially  an incorrect legal  conclusion as it \nrelates to this  case.  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District controls the  curriculum in the  district. \nHowever, when the  School  District creates  a forum for personal,  non-curricular  speech,  as  in  this case,  and the  speaker \nis  addressing a permissible  subject matter,  as  in  this  case,  Defendants  cannot restrict a particular viewpoint  [*75]  ona \npermissible  subject matter because the viewpoint is  considered religious  (Christian) without running afoul  of \nwell-established principles  of constitutional law.  See responses to PP 23,  25  above. \n55.  Chiment further believed that these banners  could be  a distraction to  a  student that was upset with the particular \ntheology of the banners.  Mr.  Johnson was provided with  some  suggested alternative posters to post on his walls in lieu \nof his banners. \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes the  fact that his patriotic banners promote  any  \"particular theology.\"  Indeed, \nDefendant Chiment's  comments  are incorrect (and patently  offensive) given the  fact that he personally 1s  aware  of \nTibetan prayer flags  (and their religious nature),  and he personally  approves  of the  display of these  sacred items by \nteachers  (as personal,  non-curricular speech)  in the  School  District.  Moreover,  Plaintiff's banners  caused no  disruption \nin the  School District.  (See  SOMF  at PP  31,  66,  67,  98,  99). \n56.  Mr.  Johnson was provided with some suggested alternate posters to post on his walls  in lieu of his banners.\nPage 24 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *75 \n(Plaintiff's  emphasis). \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not refute this  fact,  [*76]  which further demonstrates that teachers have  discretion over \ntheir non-curricular displays in their classrooms.  (See  SOMF  at PP  32-34). \n57.  Mr.  Chiment had asked his  staff to  go to  a teacher  supply  store  and buy items that would place the  statements  of \nMr.  Johnson's banners  in context. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Defendant Chiment asked his  staff to purchase  certain items. \nHowever,  Plaintiff disputes the  fact that there was  any need to  \"place the  statements  of Mr.  Johnson's banners  in \ncontext,\"  particularly  since  Defendants  admit that the historic  and patriotic phrases  depicted on Plaintiff's banners were \nwell known by the  students.  (See  SOMF  at PP  74,  78). \n58.  These  suggested materials  consisted of various posters  depicting the  entire text of the  Declaration of \nIndependence,  displays  of coinage  containing the words  \"In God We  Trust\"  and the text of the Pledge  of Allegiance. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that the  School  District purchased certain posters that contained  some \nof the well-known historic phrases  displayed on Plaintiff's banners.  (See  SOMF  at PP  68,  74,  78,  83,  84). \n59.  Mr.  Johnson received these  [*77]  materials,  but declined to  display materials up  (sic)  in lieu of his banners. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that he received posters  from Defendants  and that Defendants  said he \ncould display them,  if he  \"wish[ed].\"  Indeed,  Plaintiff said that he would be willing to  display these  additional posters \nalongside his banners  (for additional  context),  but Defendants refused.  (See  Johnson Decl.  at P 3  at Ex.  1,  attached to \nthis response). \n60.  Poway teacher Lori Brickley has what apparently  are known as  \"Tibetan prayer flags\"  displayed in her \nclassroom. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that Ms.  Lori Brickley,  a  science teacher in the  School District,  has  a \nvery large  (35  to  40  feet)  display  of Tibetan prayer flags,  some  of which contain images  of Buddha.  Plaintiff disputes \nDefendants  \"apparently\"  modifier,  particularly  since  Ms.  Brickley,  and more  importantly,  Defendant Chiment,  know \nexactly what these religious  items  are.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54). \n61.  Brickley's prayer flags  are  in a language,  Sanskrit, that no person at the  school  (student or otherwise) has been \nable to read. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  [*78]  fact that the prayers depicted on the  flags  are in Sanskrit.  However, \nthe  image  of Buddha contained on the  flags makes it plain that these  are religious  objects  of Buddhism,  and Ms. \nBrickley explains to her students that they  are  in fact  \"prayer flags.\"  Additionally,  and perhaps more  significantly, \nDefendant Chiment knew right away that these  items were  Tibetan prayer flags  of the Buddhist religion; yet,  he  still \nallows them.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54).  Moreover,  a  simple  Google  search of \"Tibetan prayer flags,\"  including a visit to \nthe popular Wikipedia  site  at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayfelarg_,  will  inform any  observer of the religious nature \nof these items  (as if the name  of them (\"prayer flags\") was not enough to  demonstrate their religious nature). \n62.  The prayer flags  are  decorative in nature,  and an interesting  artifact in that they  are  sold at the bottom of Mount \nEverest and placed on top  of the mountain when climbers reach the top,  as  Brickley informs her  students who  ask. \nResponse:  Plaintiff disputes these  facts  as  follows.  The true nature  of the  Tibetan prayer flags is that they  are \nsacred,  religious  objects that promote Buddhism.  Ms.  Brickley  [*79]  understands that;  yet,  she  still  displays them. \nDefendant Chiment understands that; yet,  he  still  allows them to be  displayed.  Indeed,  Plaintiff's banners were just as \n\"decorative\"  and  \"interesting,\"  particularly  since the phrases  and  slogans  are meaningful to  our Nation's history  and\nPage 25 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75416,  *79 \nheritage,  unlike the  Tibetan prayer flags.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54). \n63.  Brickley's personal belief is that religion does not belong in the  classroom. \nResponse:  Plaintiff contends that Ms.  Brickley's personal belief is that the  Christian religion does not belong in the \nclassroom,  particularly  since  she  displays  Buddhist religious  symbols  in er classroom.  Moreover,  Ms.  Brickley  (and \nDefendants) believes that promoting her personal views  on controversial,  partisan issues  such as  gay nights,  global \nwarming,  zero population growth,  and the  environment are permissible  in her classroom.  Ms.  Brickley believes that it is \nappropriate  for her to  criticize Fundamentalist Christians  in her classroom.  (Ms.  Brickley displays  a bumper  sticker that \nsays,  \"Hate  is not a family value,\"  which  she uses to  convey  \"the  fact that 'family values’  is  a term that the  conservative \nright[,  which includes  [*80]  Fundamentalist Christians  and Catholics,]  has used to make people who have  different \nsorts  of families wrong.\")  (SOMEF  at P 42,  Brickley Dep.  at  114  at Ex.  5  to  SOMF).  Ms.  Brickley generally believes that \nChristians,  including Plaintiff,  are  \"homophobic.\"  (Brickley Dep.  at 32-34,  121-22  at Ex.  2,  attached to this response). \nMs.  Brickley thinks  it is  appropriate  for a teacher to recite  on  school property her own pledge  of allegiance,  which \nstates,  \"I pledge  allegiance to  our mother the  earth,  the  sea,  the land,  the  sky  and obey her  simple  law,  put back what \nyou take  away.\"  (Brickley Dep.  at 37-38  at Ex.  2,  attached to this response).  Ms.  Brickley  (and Defendants) believes \nthat it is  appropriate  for her to publicly demonstrate  (1.e.,  participate in the  controversial  \"day  of silence\")  along with the \nstudents  on school property during the  school  day in support of gay rights.  Consequently,  Ms.  Brickley  (and \nDefendants) believes that it is  entirely proper for her to use her position as  a teacher in the  school  district to  actively \npromote  certain partisan political views  on controversial  issues  so  long as those views  are the favored ones.  (See  SOMF \nat PP  39,  42,  45,  53,  54,  65).  [*81] \n64.  Brickley  says her flags have the purpose  of motivating her  students to  achieve lofty goals,  like mountain \nclimbers trying to reach Everest's  summit. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that that is what Ms.  Brickley  said about her 35  to  40-foot display  of \nTibetan prayer flags.  However,  Ms.  Brickley also  acknowledges the  fact that these  \"prayer flags”  are  considered  sacred, \nreligious items, which ultimately promote Buddhism.  (See  SOMF  at PP  53,  54). \n65.  There  is  a small  figure  on  some  flags that appears to be  Buddhist in nature,  but that 1s unclear,  and it 1s not \nprominent. \nResponse:  Plaintiff does not dispute the  fact that on  some  flags,  which are  approximately one  foot by one  foot in \nsize  and prominently  displayed (35  to  40  foot display) in classrooms in the  School District contain images  of Buddha, \nand the record  shows that these  images  are recognized as images  of Buddha,  a religious  symbol.

Stormes \nTITLE:  Defendants'  Reply  To  Plaintiff's  Opposition  To  Motion  For  Summary Judgment \nTEXT:  INTRODUCTION \nThe parties  filed crossed-motions  for  summary judgment.  There  are  some minor disagreements  in the  evaluation of \nthe  facts, but there  are no material issues  of fact in either motion.  The  significant issue  is  a single  issue  of law;  which \nrule  applies to these  facts?  The  school teacher contends that his  classroom is  a  \"public  forum\"  controlled by  a particular \nline  of cases.  The  School District contends this  is  employee-speech,  controlled by  a different line  of cases.  After the\n  \nPage 2 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75419,  *1 \ncorrect legal rule is  selected,  the  School District contends that it  should prevail under either test.  The banners  displayed \nby this teacher  [*2]  in this math classroom were too  explicitly  \"religious\"  to be permitted in the public  schools under \neither test,  and the local  elected school board and its  administration  should have  control  over the  dissemination of \ninformation 1n the  classroom,  particularly in regard to  a  subject like religion that could result in additional lawsuits \nagainst the  School District. \nThe  School District Administration believed that the banner's  size,  prominence in the  classroom,  and repetition of \nthe word  \"God\"  and  \"Creator\"  were improper,  but that the  same  concepts,  contained in posters including  some historical \ncontext and including  some  additional  educational material, would have been acceptable.  The  School District offered to \nprovide the teacher with the  same phrases  in posters,  but he would not agree.  The  issue  1s whether the  Constitution gives \na teacher the  absolute right to  display large banners  in the  classroom  on the  subject of religion,  or do the banners \nimpermissibly  entangle the  School District in religion? \nFACTS \nJohnson identifies very few  disputed issues  of fact,  and of those that are  disputed,  most are not  \"material.\"  In \nseveral  cases,  Johnson does not dispute the  fact but argues  [*3]  with the  characterization by the  School  District. \nJohnson invites the  Court to review the photos  of the banners to  determine their meaning.  Doc.  56-2,  Facts  13,  14,  and \n16.  Johnson contends that the banners  are patriotic  expressions.  But the  only  facts the banners have  in common are their \nnational historic nature  and the references to  \"God\"  or the  \"Creator\"  in each,  implying  a national  endorsement of the \nreligious belief in God the  Creator, rather than Buddha,  or Allah,  or  some  other religion,  or no religion.  The  School \nDistrict contends the banners  entangled the  School District in religion in violation of the  Establishment Clause.  But that \nis  a dispute  of law;  not a dispute  of material  fact  sufficient to  overcome  a motion for summary judgment.  It is the  central \ndispute  of law that is the reason for the  litigation.  Do these banners  -  displayed in a public  classroom,  as they  appeared, \nhowever one  characterizes their appearance  -  impermissibly  entangle the  School  District in religion? \nThis  issue  is  an issue  of law.  \"It  stands to reason that if the  question of whether a government activity \ncommunicates  endorsement of religion 1s primarily  a legal  question, then the  question of whether  [*4]  a government \nactivity  communicates  disapproval  of religion is  also  largely  a legal  question.  CLF.  v.  Capistrano  Unified School Dist., \n615 F.Supp.2d 1137,  1155 -1156 (C.D.Cal.,  2009) \nJohnson disputes the  School District's  statement that  \"non-curricular items  are part of the  learning  environment and \npotentially  advocating,  therefore  such items  [sic]  are  subject to this written policy.\"  Doc.  56-2,  Fact 30.  But this  is really \na dispute  of law.  Is it not true that some non-curricular items  could be  displayed by  a teacher that would be \nimpermissible?  Is there no  limit upon the personal  display  of a teacher in his  classroom?  The  case law has placed limits \non teacher displays  in the  classroom,  which was the basis  for the  School District's Administrator's  concern that these \nbanners were impermissible. \nIn Facts  53  and  55  the  School District referred to the Assistant Superintendent's reasons  for asking Johnson to take \ndown the banners.  Johnson disputes the  \"facts\"  but without offering  contrary  evidence.  He  simply  does not agree with \nthe  Administrator's reason,  but the reasons  identified were the reasons  given by the Administrator in his  deposition. \nArgument of counsel  [*5]  does not raise material  dispute  of fact. \nJohnson disputes the  statement that the  \"Tibetan Prayer Flags\"  on display were  \"decorative.\"  Doc.  56-2,  Fact 62.  He \ncontends that they  are  \"sacred,  religious items that promote  Buddhism.\"  But he  does not offer any  competent evidence \nthat they  are religious  or sacred.  There  1s no  evidence that they promote  any religion.  The writing  on the  flags  is  in \nSanskrit,  an ancient language,  that does not promote  anything to English  speakers.  The  Court is  invited to view Exhibit \n\"J\"  to  determine whether the  flags promote  any idea,  or are merely  decorative.  But this is not a dispute  of fact,  1f for no \nother reason,  than because Johnson offered no  admissible  evidence that the  flags promote religion. \nFinally,  Johnson disputes the  fact that teacher  \"Brickley's personal belief is that religion does not belong in the\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75419,  *5 \nclassroom.\"  But that fact 1s taken from her testimony.  Johnson offers  argument about some  of her beliefs, which he \ncontends  are political  and opposed to his ideas.  She put up  a bumper  sticker that says  \"Hate  is not a family value.\"  She \nthinks  some  Christians  are homophobic.  She  demonstrated with students in favor of gay rights.  California  [*6]  law \nmakes  discrimination against a person because  of sexual  orientation illegal.  Cal.  Ed.  Code  §  220;  Cal.  Civ.  Code  §  51; \nCal.  Pen Code  §  422.55.  Brickley's beliefs  are  consistent with California law  and not inconsistent with Christian \ndoctrine.  Hate  is not a Christian value,  either.  Johnson's  analysis  of Brickley's beliefs  does not raise  a triable issue  of \nmaterial  fact.  If her  support of controversial issues  crosses the  line,  then the  School  District will be required to  address \nthat conduct with her.  But the issue here  is  Johnson's banners,  and whether those banners  impermissibly entangle the \nSchool District with religion in violation of the  Establishment Clause. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Right to  Speech  Must be Balanced Against the Risk of Entanglement with Religion. \nA.  The Forum Test Does  Not Apply  To  These Facts. \nJohnson asks the  Court to use  a forum analysis.  The  forum analysis  does not apply to  employee  speech during \nworking hours,  but does  apply to  speech of private  citizens using the  employer's  facilities.  Berry v.  Department of \nSocial Services  (\"Berry\"),  447 F.3d 642,  650  (9th  Cir.  2006).  Berry turned upon the use  of that  space  during  [*7]  the \nemployee's  off-duty hours.  This  case  addresses  employee  speech during working hours. \nThe issue 1s not the right of a member of the public  speaking to  students,  or students  speaking to  students.  Rather, \nthis  case  addresses  a public-school  employer's right to protect its  own legitimate  interests  in performing its mission of \neducating  students balanced against a public-school teacher's rights to  speech during his working hours with students. \nThe  School District's  interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation must be balanced against Johnson's right to \nfree  speech.  \"[T]he interest of the  State in avoiding  an Establishment Clause violation 'may be  [a]  compelling’  one \njustifying  an abridgement of free  speech otherwise protected by the  First Amendment...  .\"  Lamb's  Chapel v.  Center \nMoriches  Union Free School Dist.,  508  U.S.  384,  394,  113  S.Ct.  2141,  2148,  124 L.kd.2d 352  (1993)  quoting  Widmar \nv.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271,  102 S.Ct.  269,  275,  70 L.Ed.2d 440  (1981).  The  Supreme  Court identified the balancing \ntest for public  employee's  speech in Pickering v.  Bd.  of Educ.,  391  U.S.  563  (1968),  as the  starting point  [*8]  for the \nanalysis. \nB.  Ruling a  Classroom Is  a  Limited  Public  Forum Will Disrupt the Educational Process \nIf the  Court rules that this  classroom is  a public  forum, then there  is  a substantial risk that some  other people would \nhave the right to  address the  students  in that public  forum.  That would create  an impossible  condition for the  School \nDistrict,  impeding the  ability  of the  School District to  accomplish its mission to provide  an education to  its  students. \nThe  Supreme  Court has identified three types  of fora:  the traditional public  forum,  the public  forum created by \ngovernment designation,  and the nonpublic  forum. Arkansas Educ.  Television  Com'n  v.  Forbes,  523  U.S.  666,  677 \n(1998).  Johnson contends that his  classroom 1s in the  second group,  a forum created by government designation.  \"A \npublic  forum may be  created by government designation of a place  or channel  of communication for use by the public  at \nlarge  for assembly and speech,  for use by certain speakers,  or for the  discussion of certain  subjects.\"  Cornelius v. \nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,  Inc.(\"Cornelius\")  473  U.S.  788,  802  (1985).  If this  classroom is  a public \nforum,  [*9]  then the public  at large,  or at least certain  speakers,  must have  access to use it.  That would be harmful to \nthe  educational process. \nIt is undisputed that Johnson 1s the  only teacher who  is permitted to post material in that classroom:  \"No  other \nteacher is permitted to  display materials  on Plaintiff's  classroom walls without Plaintiff's permission.\"  Doc.  43-3,  Fact \n33.  Johnson's position is  inconsistent with the notion of a public  forum.  He is  an employee  speaking  during working \nhours.  His position on this  limited permission is  inconsistent with the type  of designation.  If it is  a limited public  forum,\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75419,  *9 \nthen,  at the least,  some  other teachers would be permitted to  display materials  in his  classroom.  If some part of the \npublic  is not permitted to  access the  classroom,  then it is not a public  forum. \nC.  There  Is  No  Evidence  that the  School District Intended  a Public  Forum \nA designated public  forum cannot be  created accidently,  or by implication.  \"Designated public  fora.  .  .  are  created \nby purposeful governmental  action.  \"The  government does not create  a  [designated]  public  forum by inaction or by \npermitting limited discourse,  but only by intentionally  opening  a nontraditional  [*10]  public  forum  for public \ndiscourse.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.,  at 802,  accord, International Soc. for Krishna  Consciousness,  Inc.  v.  Lee,  505  U.S.  672, \n678  (1992)  (designated public  forum is  \"property that the  State has  opened for expressive  activity by part or all  of the \npublic\").  Hence  \"the  Court has looked to the policy  and practice  of the  government to  ascertain whether it intended to \ndesignate  a place not traditionally  open to  assembly and debate  as  a public  forum.\"  Cornelius,  473  U.S.,  at 802. \nThere is no  evidence that the  School District intended to  create  a public  forum in its  classrooms.  Johnson describes \nit as  a  \"policy,  custom,  or practice.\"  Doc.  56,  at 2:10-11;  16-17.  There is  a policy that governs the teaching of \ncontroversial  subjects.  That policy  does not  specifically  create  a public  forum and does not show  an intent to  create  a \npublic  forum.  It controls  and limits materials in the  classroom,  which includes materials posted on classroom walls.  But \nnothing in that policy  evidences  any intent by the  School  District to  open the  classrooms  as  open forums. \nThe  evidence  from each of the  school Administrators was that they believed  [*11]  that they had a duty to  limit the \nmaterials posted on the walls  of classrooms  if the material violated the  law.  There is  a limitation placed upon the \npersonal items teachers may  display under the law,  and under the  Policy and practice.  Doc.  55-5,  Defs.'  Exhs.  \"C\";  \"D,\" \npp.  13-15,  and Exh.  \"E,\"  Chiment Depo,  pp.  57:15-58:3;  65:2-6. \nD.  No  Court Has  Yet Made  a Classroom Into  an  Open  Forum \nJohnson has not identified any  case that has held that a classroom is  an open forum.  The  School District did not find \none,  either.  His  argument 1s  simply to  deny the  application of the Pickering-style  analysis,  and to proceed with a forum \nanalysis.  Ninth Circuit authority  favors the  School  District's  approach. \nSchool Districts hire teachers  for their  speech.  The  employer must be permitted to  control that speech.  \"This  is  so  in \npart because the  school  system does not  \"regulate\"  teachers’  speech as much as it res that speech.  Expression 1s  a \nteacher's  stock in trade,  the  commodity  she  sells to her employer in exchange  for a  salary.\" Mayer v. Monroe  County \nCommunity School Corp.,  474 F.3d 477,  479  (7th  Cir.  2007).  Similarly,  it is not the nghts  of the teacher at issue  [*12] \nhere;  it is the rights  of the  children.  \"Children who  attend  school because they must ought not be  subject to teachers’ \nidiosyncratic perspectives.\" /d.  \"But if indoctrination 1s likely, the power should be reposed in  someone the people  can \nvote  out of office,  rather than tenured teachers.  At least the board's views  can be  debated openly,  and the people may \nchoose to  elect persons  committed to neutrality  on contentious  issues.\" /d.  at 479-80. \nSeveral  courts have  considered arguments that a forum analysis  should apply to the  classroom,  in several  different \ncontexts.  No  court has  decided that a classroom is  an open forum.  \"[I]n classrooms,  during  school hours,  when \ncurricular activities  are  supervised by teachers,  the nonpublic nature  of the  school is preserved.  Speech occurring  during \nthese  activities may be regulated under standards  different from those that would apply in public  fora.\"  Busch  v.  Marple \nNewtown School Dist.,  567 F.3d 89,  95  (3d.  Cir.2009).  \"Some places  on the  University's  campus,  such as the \nadministration building,  the president's  office,  or classrooms  are not opened as  fora for use by the  student body  or \nanyone  [*13]  else.\" Bowman  v.  White,  444 F.3d 967,  997 (Sth  Cir.  2006).  \"[T]he  selection of textbooks by the  state  for \nuse  in public  school  classrooms  is  government speech,  and is not subject to the  forum analysis  of Hazelwood or the \nviewpoint neutrality requirement.  Chiras v.  Miller,  432 F.3d 606,  620  (5th  Cir.  2005).  \"[A]lthough Edwards has  a right \nto  advocate  outside  of the  classroom for the use  of certain curriculum materials,  he  does not have  a right to use those \nmaterials  in the  classroom.  Edwards v.  California  University of Pennsylvania,  156 F.3d 488,  491  (3d Cir.  1998). \nIn Downs v.  Los Angeles  Unified School Dist.  228 F.3d 1003,  1005,  1013  (9th  Cir 2000),  the Ninth Circuit\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75419,  *13 \ndetermined that a bulletin board, placed in a hallway,  outside  of the  classroom,  used by teachers,  had not been made into \nopen forum,  or a limited forum,  by the  school  district,  and upheld limitations placed upon displays  on that bulletin \nboard.  That ruling  argues that the less public nature  of the  classroom is  even less likely to  qualify  as  a public  forum. \nE.  \"Substantial Disruption\"  is Not The  Test. \nJohnson also  contends  [*14]  that the  Defendants  cannot prohibit the banners because the banners  did not \n\"materially  and  substantially  disrupt the work  and discipline  of the  school,\"  quoting  Zinker,  supra,  393  U.S.  at 513  and \nGrayned v.  City of Rockford,  408  U.S.  104  (1972).  Doc.  43-2,  p.  8,  fn.  6.  But Johnson does not fully  articulate the test \nfrom  Tinker.  Under  Tinker,  there  are three  conditions that permit limitations  on speech, not just  \"disruption.\"  The  actual \ntest is,  a student may exercise his night to  freedom of expression unless the  \"conduct by the  student,  in class  or out of it, \nwhich for any reason -  whether it stems  from time,  place,  or type  of behavior -  materially  disrupts  classwork  or involves \nsubstantial disorder or invasion  of the rights of others  ....\"  Tinker,  393  U.S.  at p.  513,  emphasis  added.  If a  student felt \ncoerced into reading the banners  on a daily basis,  then that student's rights were  invaded,  and the  Tinker limitation does \nnot apply. \nF.  Even using a Hazelwood forum analysis,  the Defendants  still should  prevail. \nIn the  event that this  Court were to  find that the Berry/Pickering balancing  [*15]  test does not apply,  and that \nJohnson's  classroom was  a limited public  forum under the Hazelwood analysis,  the  School District would still be within \nits rights to remove the banners.  Under that analysis, the Defendants may  still prevail if they  show that the banners \nconstitutes  an Establishment Clause violation.  This  is because  avoiding  endorsement of religion is  a constitutional \nmandate  and therefore  a compelling interest.  Good News  Club  v. Milford Cent.  Sch.,  533  U.S.  98,  112-13  (2001)  (citing \nWidmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  271  (1981)). \nTo that end,  the Ninth Circuit has held that schools may refuse to  allow religious  speech in a  limited public  forum \nwhere  it is necessary to  avoid an Establishment Clause violation.  Cole  v.  Oroville  Union High Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092 \n(9th  Cir.2000).  \"We  conclude the  District officials  did not violate the  students'  freedom of speech.  Even assuming the \nOroville  graduation ceremony was  a public  or limited public  forum,  the  District's refusal to  allow the  students to  deliver \na  sectarian  speech or prayer as part of the graduation was necessary to  avoid violating the Establishment Clause under \n[*16]  the principles  applied in Santa Fe Independent School District v.  Doe,  530  U.S.  290,  120 S.Ct.  2266,  147 L.Ed.2d \n295  (2000),  and Lee v.  Weisman,  505  U.S.  577,  112 S.Ct.  2649,  120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992).  [Citiations.]\"  Cole,  228 F.3d at \n1101;  See,  e.g., Prince v.  Jacoby,  303 F.3d 1074,  1086-87 (9th  Cir.2002)  (finding that while  student religious group \nmust be given equal  access to  school's public  address  system to  announce  its  activities, the group may be barred from \ndoing  so to  \"pray  and proselytize\");  and Lassonde v.  Pleasanton  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  320 F.3d 979,  980  (9th  Cir.2003) \n(prohibiting proselytizing in high  school graduation speech) \nG.  California  Constitution  Limits  a  Teacher Advocating  a Controversial Viewpoint. \nJohnson agrees that federal law governs  California Establish Clause  Analysis.  So,  like his First Amendment claim, \nJohnson's  Claim for violation of free  speech under the  California Constitution also  fails. \nII.  Under Equal Protection Johnson Was Not Treated Differently \nJohnson returns to his  forum analysis  argument and applies that argument to the Equal Protection analysis.  [*17] \nThe  School District continues to  contend that the  forum analysis  cannot be  applied to teacher speech during class time. \nIn equal protection claims brought by  a  \"class  of one,”  the plaintiff must show he has been intentionally treated \ndifferently from others  similarly  situated and that there is no rational basis  for the  difference  in treatment.  See Sioux \nCity Bridge  Co.  v.  Dakota  County,  260  U.S.  441,  445  (1923); Allegheny Pittsburgh  Coal Co.  v.  Commission  of Webster \nCty.,  488  U.S.  336  (1989).  But the  evidence  shows that he was not intentionally treated differently.  While he  asserts that \nseveral  documents posted in other classrooms  are  similar to his banners,  the  only display that is  as large  and as\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75419,  *17 \nprominent as his banners  is the  display  of the  \"Tibetan Prayer Flags.\"  But there  is no  evidence that the  flags \ncommunicated any religious ideas.  They appear to be  decorative,  and inscrutable,  since they  are written in Sanskrit, \nwhich no person at the  school has been able to read.  Exh.  5,  Doc.  #54-4,  pp.  224-225  (Brickley Depo.,  pp.  88:17-89:6). \nIII.  The Individual Defendants  Should  Be  Granted  Qualified  Immunity. \nQualified immunity  applies to  [*18]  protect a defendant when the  Constitutional right  \"was not clearly established \nat the time  of the  alleged violation.\"  Cole  v.  Oroville  Union High School Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092,  1101  (9th  Cir.  2000). \nThese public  school  administrators  cannot be  expected to understand the  details  of Constitutional jurisprudence,  and can \nreasonably be  expected to have believed that the banners violated the  Constitution. \nThis  is  a complicated case with logical  arguments  on both sides,  in a legal  arena where  appellate justices  frequently \ndisagree.  School Administrators have been carefully taught that advocating religion is not permitted in the  classroom. \nAll these  school Administrators  agreed that Johnson's banners looked like religious  advocacy.  They  cannot reasonably \nhave been expected to believe that these banners would be permitted by the  Court. \nCONCLUSION \nThe  difficult factual issue in this  case  is the national  slogans Johnson chose to  display.  Taken  separately,  and \ndisplayed more moderately,  each line would be permissible.  When combined and written large,  with the repeated \nreferences to  \"God\"  along with the historical  context of the phrases,  the banners  imply that the government  [*19] \nendorses religion,  and the particular religion that identifies the  deity  as  \"God\"  the  \"Creator\"  instead of \"Buddha\"  or \n\"Allah.\"  From the point of view  of the  students,  Johnson  is the  Government.  So his banners teach  students that the \nUnited  States  and the  School  District endorse the religion that identifies the  deity  as  \"God.\" \nIn C.F.  v.  Capistrano  Unified School Dist.,  615 F.Supp.2d 1137,  1155 -1156 (C.D.Cal.,  2009) the  court determined \nthat a  science teacher could not make  statements in class that were  critical  of religion.  The  court recognized that critical \nthinking was important in the  classroom,  but also  saw that even a minor transgression would harm the nghts  of students. \nThe  Court quoted a passage  limiting the  support of religion.  \"[I]t is no  defense to urge that the religious practices here \nmay be relatively minor encroachments  on the First Amendment.  The breach of neutrality that 1s today a trickling \nstream may  all too  soon become  a raging torrent and,  in the words  of Madison,  ‘it is proper to take  alarm at the  first \nexperiment on our liberties.\" /d.  at quoting School Dist.  of Abington,  374  U.S.  at 225  (1963);  see  also Elk Grove \nUnified School Dist.  v.  Newdow,  542  U.S.  1,  36-37,  [*20]  (2004)  (O'Connor,  J.,  concurring)  (explaining that  \"[t]here \nare no  de minimis violations  of the  Constitution\").  In this  case  it is  Johnson who 1s  advocating religion with the \nappearance  of government approval  and the  support of the  School District.  That 1s improper;  the  government must \nremain completely neutral  on the issue  of religion. \nThe  Court is respectfully requested to  deny Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,  and to  grant the Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment. \nDATED:  October  19,  2009 \nRespectfully  submitted, \nSTUTZ ARTIANO  SHINOFF  & HOLTZ \nA  Professional Corporation \nBy:  /s/ Jack M.

Benitez \nTITLE:  Plaintiff's  Reply Memorandum In  Support Of Motion  For  Summary Judgment \nTEXT:  Defendants’  opposition invites this  court to ignore the undisputed material  facts  and controlling law,  to  assume \nthat certain inconvenient facts  do not exist,  and to  accept their facile  (and patently erroneous)  conclusion that their \nundifferentiated fear of an Establishment Clause violation permits them to  engage in viewpoint discrimination.  By \nsilencing Plaintiff's personal,  non-curricular patriotic  expression on account of Plaintiff's viewpoint, while  approving \nthe prominent display of personal,  non-curricular Buddhist religious  items,  among other teacher displays,  Defendants \nhave violated clearly  established constitutional nghts.\n  \nPage 2 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *1 \nIn their opposition,  Defendants  complain that  \"[Plaintiff]  misses the bigger picture by  setting the parameters  [*2] \ntoo broadly.\"  (Defs.'  Opp'n at 4).  To the  contrary,  it is  Defendants who miss the picture  altogether.  Accepting \nDefendants'  arguments removes  all  \"parameters\"-including those that are required by the United States  and California \nConstitutions-thereby effectively negating the  constitutional rights  of Plaintiff.  Indeed,  it is Defendants who have \ncreated the  forum for the personal,  non-curricular  speech at issue here.  If Defendants want to  close the  forum,  they \ncould.  The  fact that they refuse to  do  so  and instead seek to retain the power to permit the  expression of viewpoints they \nfavor and censor those they  do not is  disturbing-and it 1s unconstitutional.  nl  In the  final  analysis,  Defendants  are \ninviting this  court to rewrite First Amendment law to  allow government officials to  discriminate based on a speaker's \nview.  This  court should decline the  invitation. \nnl  Defendant Chiment testified on behalf of the  School  District as  follows:  \"You could make the  argument that \nif the District were to  say no  one  can put up  anything up  (sic) unless  it's  absolutely curriculum related and these \n[Plaintiff's banners]  were up,  then they would violate  it.  But our District has  chosen -  and that would be \npermissible,  I think,  for a School District to  do  so,  but our District has chosen  not to  do  that,  to  allow \nnoncurricular and personal as well  as  curricular.  And  so when that decision's been made, / think that these  at \nleast meet that test.  The test they don't meet is the  advocacy of a particular  sectarian viewpoint.\"  (Chiment Dep. \nat  128-29  at Ex.  3)  (emphasis  added). \n[*3] \nARGUMENT \nI.  Defendants'  Viewpoint-Based Restriction  Is  Unconstitutional. \nA.  Plaintiff's  Banners  Constitute Personal,  Non-Curricular  Speech. \nThere is no  dispute that Plaintiff's banners  constitute  speech.  And Defendants  do not argue that Plaintiff's banners \nare  \"government  speech,”  nor could they in light of the undisputed facts.  n2  Defendants  admit that Plaintiffs banners \nconstitute  \"non-curricular personal\"  speech.  n3  They admit that  \"Plaintiff's banners  do not belong to the  School District; \nthey  are his personal items.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P 23).  And they  admit that Plaintiff's banners  \"were not \nused to teach math[,]  and they were not used as part of any  of [Plaintiff's]  extracurricular activities.\"  n4  (Defs.'  Resp.  to \nStmt.  of Facts  at P 26). \nn2  At most,  Defendants  claim that  \"the banners  contained  speech made by  [Plaintiff]  which carries the \nimprimatur of the  School.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  62).  This  assertion,  however,  is  flatly  contradicted \nby their testimony.  (See Pl.'s  Stmt.  of Facts  at PP  55,  56,  62).  Nonetheless,  even accepting this  claim, \nDefendants'  viewpoint-based restriction cannot withstand constitutional  scrutiny.  See Downs v.  Los Angeles \nUnified Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1003,  1010  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (stating that the Ninth Circuit has  \"incorporated \n‘viewpoint neutrality’  analysis into nonpublic  forum,  school-sponsored  speech cases\")  (citing Planned \nParenthood v.  Clark County Sch.  Dist.,  941  F.2d 817,  828 n.  19,  829-30  (9th  Cir.  1991)). \n[*4] \nn3  Defendants  admit the  following:  \"The  [Tibetan prayer]  flags,  like  Johnson's banners,  are non-curricular \npersonal items in nature.\"  (Defs.'  P  & A in Supp.  of Mot.  for  Summ.  J.  at  19)  (Doc.  No.  55)  (emphasis  added). \nn4  Defendant Chiment testified on behalf of the  School  District as  follows:\nPage  3 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *4 \nQ:  [D]o you have  any information that  [Plaintiff]  actually used those  in teaching his math class, \nthose banners? \nA:  [have no information that he used those banners  in the teaching  of his math class.  *  *  * \nQ:  Are you aware  of those banner being part of any  aspect of the math curriculum as  far as you \nunderstand the math curriculum in the high  schools  at Poway  School  District? \nA:  I  do not believe they are.  *  *  * \nQ:  *  *  *  Prior to  .  .  .  directing  [Plaintiff]  to remove those banners,  did you have  any  information \nthat students were studying these  banners  or their slogans as part of [Plaintiff's] math  classes? \nA:  No. \nQ:  And,  again, prior to.  .  .  directing  [Plaintiff]  to remove those banners,  did you have  any \ninformation that the  students were  discussing  any  aspects  of those  slogans  depicted in  [Plaintiff's] \nbanners  during his math classes? \nA:  No. \nQ:  [Prior to  directing Plaintiff to remove his banners],  did you have  any information that those \nbanners were being used in any way  for any extracurricular activities that  [Plaintiff]  might be \ninvolved with? \nA:  No. \nQ:  So was  it your understanding in January of 2007 that those banners weren't part of the math \ncurriculum for  [Plaintiff]?  *  *  * \nA:  It was my understanding that these were not part of the math  curriculum. \n(Chiment Dep.  at 93-95  at Ex.  3)  (emphasis  added). \n[*5] \nConsequently, the restriction on Plaintiff's personal  speech plainly implicates  Plaintiff's  constitutional rights.  Tinker \nv.  Des Moines Indep.  Cmty.  Sch.  Dist.,  393  U.S.  503,  506  (1969)  (\"First Amendment rights  .  .  .  are  available to teachers \nand  students.\"); Morse v.  Frederick,  551  U.S.  393,  403  (2007)  (\"In  Tinker,  this  Court made  clear that 'First Amendment \nrights  applied in light of the  special  characteristics  of the  school  environment,  are  available to teachers  and  students.'\"); \nPerry Educ. Ass'n  v.  Perry Local Educators,  460  U.S.  37,  44  (1983)  (\"The First Amendment's guarantee  of free  speech \napplies to teacher's mailboxes  as  surely as it does  elsewhere within the  school... .  \");  see also  id.  at 44 \n(\"[C]onstitutional interests  are  implicated by  denying  [appellee]  use  of the interschool mail  system.\"). \nB.  A  Forum Analysis Applies  Because Defendants  Created  the Forum at Issue. \nThe  overwhelming  evidence  demonstrates:  (1) that Defendants  created a forum for the personal, non-curricular \nspeech of its teachers;  (2) that this policy  or practice has been in place  for more than 30 years;  (3) that the  [*6]  district's \nteachers  express  a wide  array  of personal,  non-curricular messages in their classrooms  as  a result of this policy  or \npractice,  including messages  addressing  controversial  social  and political issues  as well  as religious messages;  (4)  and \nthat Plaintiff's banners were  displayed in this  forum for approximately 25  years pursuant to this policy or practice \nwithout complaint.  Consequently,  this  case  does not involve  some vague  description or identification of a forum. \nCompare  Tucker v.  State  of Cal.  Dep't of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204,  1209  (9th  Cir.  1996)  (rejecting the  creation of \"a limited \npurpose public  forum in  [the  defendant's]  offices by  allowing its  employees both to  discuss  'public  questions when they \nassemble  informally  at their desks,  drinking  fountains,  lunch rooms,  copy machines,  etc.’  and to  display written \nmaterials  in and around their offices  and cubicles\").  Rather,  the  School  District has knowingly, purposefully,  and \nintentionally  opened the  classroom walls  for the personal,  non-curricular speech of its teachers.  See  Cornelius v. \nNAACP Legal Defense  & Educ.  Fund,  473  U.S.  788,  800,  802  (1985)  (applying a forum analysis  for restrictions  [*7]  on \nthe use  of government property for expressive purposes).  Defendants  cannot refute this  evidence by  simply closing their \neyes  and wishing it weren't so.  Indeed,  in their response to  Plaintiff's undisputed  statement of facts,  Defendants \n\"dispute\"  the  creation of the  forum only  \"to the  extent that there  are  limits  on what personal items teachers  are permitted\nPage 4 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *7 \nto  display under the  law,  and by the  District's  own policies  and practices.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at PP  35-42) \n(emphasis  added).  Thus,  they  do not deny the  existence  of the  forum,  n5  and Plaintiff does not deny that there  is  certain \nspeech that can be restricted by government officials  in this  forum under the  law.  n6  The  question remains,  however, \nwhether the  application of the  \"District's  own policies  and practices\"-their viewpoint-based restriction-in this  case 1s \nunconstitutional.  And the  answer to that question based on controlling law is  an unequivocal yes.  Moreover,  1n order to \nanalyze this  question under the facts  of this case,  the  court must engage  in a forum analysis because the  case  involves \nthe use  of government property (classroom walls)  for expressive purposes  (Plaintiff's banners).  [*8]  Cornelius,  473 \nU.S.  at 802  (adopting  \"a forum  analysis  as  a means  of determining when the  Government's  interest in limiting the use  of \nits property to  its  intended purpose  outweighs the  interest of those wishing to use the property for  [expressive] \npurposes\").  Thus,  in light of the  forum created by Defendants  for the personal,  non-curricular speech of the  district's \nteachers,  what limitations  does the  law permit the  government to make?  Clearly,  whether the  forum is  a public  forum,  a \ndesignated public  forum,  a limited public  forum,  or even a nonpublic  forum,  there  is no  disputing that the law  does not \npermit government officials to make viewpoint-based restrictions.  See  Section C,  below.  As  a result,  Defendants’ \nviewpoint-based restriction under the  facts  of this  case  is unconstitutional. \nn5  Defendant Chiment testified on behalf of the  School  District as  follows: \nQ:  Sir, would you agree that the  School  District opens  its  classroom walls to  certain expression \nby its teachers? \nA:  In a  limited way we  open the walls, yes. \nQ:  And that would be  for messages that -  and ideas that may not necessarily be  curriculum \nrelated;  1s that right,  sir? \nA:  That's  correct. \n(Chiment Dep.  at 273  at Ex.  3). \n[*9] \nn6  For example,  the  School District could prohibit  speech that promotes  illegal  drug use  or underage  alcohol \nconsumption,  see Morse,  55]  U.S.  at 408-09,  that  \"materially  and substantially  disrupt[s]  the work  and discipline \nof the  school,\"  Zinker,  393  U.S.  at 513,  or that 1s  sexually  suggestive, Bethel Sch.  Dist.  No.  403  v.  Fraser,  478 \nU.S.  675,  678  (1986).  The  School District could also restrict speech that  \"Incite[s]  to imminent lawless  action.\" \nBrandenburg v.  Ohio,  395  U.S.  444,  449  (1969).  None  of these  constitutional limitations  apply here. \nC.  Defendants'  Viewpoint-Based  Restriction Violates  the First Amendment. \nDefendants  did not censor Plaintiff's  speech because the banners  \"caused a material  disruption or  substantial \ndisorder in the  school  or.  .  .  interfered with the  curriculum.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at PP  98,  99).  The  decision \nto  order Plaintiff to remove his banners was based on the  \"viewpoint\"  of the message  expressed.  (Defs.’  Resp.  to  Stmt. \nof Facts  at PP  93-96).  Consequently,  Defendants’  [*10]  speech restriction cannot withstand  scrutiny under the United \nStates  or California Constitutions,  which prohibit viewpoint discrimination even in nonpublic  forums.  Rosenberger v. \nRector &  Visitors  of the  Univ.  of Va.,  515  U.S.  819,  829  (1995);  Lamb's  Chapel v.  Center Moriches  Union Free Sch. \nDist.,  508  U.S.  384  (1993);  Good News  Club v.  Milford Cent.  Sch.,  5333  U.S.  98,  107-08  (2001);  Faith  Ctr.  Church \nEvangelistic Ministries v.  Glover,  480 F.3d 891  (9th  Cir.  2007);  Truth  v.  Kent Sch.  Dist.,  5324 F.3d 957,  973  (9th  Cir. \n2008)  (observing that in a limited public  forum  \"where restriction to the  forum is based  solely on.  .  .  religious \nviewpoint,  the restriction is  invalid\");  Cogswell v.  City of Seattle,  347 F.3d 809,  815  (9th  Cir.  2003)  (\"[If speech]  fall[s] \nwithin an acceptable  subject matter otherwise included in the  forum,  the  State may not legitimately  exclude it from the \nforum based on the viewpoint of the  speaker.\"); Brown v.  California Dep't of Transp.,  321  F.3d 1217,  1222  (9th  Cir. \n2003)  (stating that  \"[rJestrictions  on free  expression in a nonpublic  forum  [*11]  are  constitutional  only if the \ndistinctions  drawn are.  .  .  ‘viewpoint neutral.\"  (quoting  Cornelius,  473  U.S.  at 806);  Perry,  460  U.S.  at 46 (stating that\nPage  5 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *11 \nspeech restrictions  in a nonpublic  forum must be reasonable  and viewpoint neutral);  California  Teachers Ass'n  v. \nGoverning Bd.  of San Diego  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  45 Cal.  App.  4th  1383,  1391  (1996)  (applying First Amendment \nprinciples to  claims  arising under California Constitution). \nIn  sum,  it is  evident why Defendants want to  avoid a forum analysis  at all  costs:  the  case  law  overwhelmingly \ndemonstrates that their speech restriction is unconstitutional. \nII.  Undifferentiated  Fear  of an Establishment Clause Violation Does Not Justify Defendants'  Viewpoint-Based \nRestriction  of Plaintiff's  Speech. \nDefendants  claim that their  \"interest in avoiding  an Establishment Clause violation trump's  [Plaintiff's]  right to  free \nspeech.\"  (Defs.'  Opp'n at 3).  This  assertion cannot withstand even modest scrutiny.  Indeed,  the  Supreme  Court has made \nplain that the undifferentiated fear of an Establishment Clause violation does not justify  a viewpoint-based restriction on \nspeech.  Widmar v.  Vincent,  454  U.S.  263,  273  (1981);  [*12]  Rosenberger,  515  U.S.  at 841-42;  see  also  Tucker v. \nCalifornia Dep't of Educ.,  97 F.3d 1204,  1212-13  (9th  Cir.  1996)  (rejecting Establishment Clause  defense  in \n\"employee\"  speech case). \nMoreover,  the  cases  cited by Defendants,  which Defendants  acknowledge involve proselytizing and prayer in \npublic  schools,  are not remotely analogous to the  facts  of this  case.  See,  e.g.,  Peloza v.  Capistrano  Unified Sch.  Dist.,  37 \nF.3d 517 (9th  Cir.  1994)  (restricting  a teacher from  evangelizing  students  about his  Christian faith and beliefs);  Cole  v. \nOroville  Union High Sch.  Dist.,  228 F.3d 1092  (9th  Cir.  2000)  (restricting  a  sectarian,  proselytizing valedictory  speech \nand a  sectarian invocation at graduation);  Prince  v.  Jacoby,  303 F.3d 1074  (9th  Cir.  2002)  (restricting the use  of the \npublic  address  system for prayer and proselytizing); Lassonde  v.  Pleasanton  Unified Sch.  Dist,  320 F.3d 979  (9th  Cir. \n2003)  (prohibiting proselytizing in high  school graduation  speech). \nHere,  there  1s no  dispute  as to the  following facts: \n.  \"Plaintiff's banners  contain the  following historical phrases:  [*13]  \"In  God  We  Trust,\" the  official motto  of the \nUnited  States;  \"One Nation  Under  God,\" the  1954  amendment to the  Pledge  of Allegiance;  \"God Bless America,\"  a \npatriotic  song;  \"God Shed His  Grace  On  Thee,\"  a line  from  \"America the  Beautiful,”  a patriotic  song;  and  \"All Men \nAre Created Equal,  They Are Endowed By  Their Creator,\"  an excerpt from the preamble to the Declaration of \nIndependence.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  68)  (emphasis  added). \n.  \"Religious people  founded this Nation;  as  a result,  references to  God are  common in our  songs,  mottoes,  and \nslogans.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  75). \n.  \"The phrases included in Plaintiff's banners were not taken from  any religious  documents  or religious texts.\" \n(Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  76). \n.  \"Plaintiff's banners  do not contain quotes  or passages  from  Sacred  Scripture  or any  other religious text.\"  (Defs.. \nResp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  77). \n.  \"In God We  Trust’  is the  official motto  of the  United  States.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  79). \n.  \"In  1942,  Congress  enacted the Pledge  of Allegiance,  which was  amended in  1954  to  officially include the phrase \n‘under  [*14]  God.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  80). \n.  \"God Bless America'  is  an American patriotic  song written by Irving Berlin in  1918  and later revised by him in \n1938.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  85).  . \n.  God Bless America’  is  a phrase that is  also  commonly used in  speeches by the President of the  United  States.\" \n(Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  86).\nPage  6 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *14 \n.  \"The  song  'God Bless America’  is  often played at public  events,  including  at  sporting  events,  such as the  seventh \ninning  stretch at Yankee  Stadium,  since the terrorist attacks  of September  11,  2001.\"  (Defs.’  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P \n87). \n.  \"God  Shed His  Grace  on Thee'  is  a verse  from ‘America the Beautiful,’  an American patriotic  song that is  often \nplayed at public  events.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  88). \n.  \"During his  30  plus years  of teaching in the  School  District,  Plaintiff has had 7  different school principals, \nnumerous  school board members,  superintendents,  assistant superintendents,  over 4,000  students  and several thousand \nparents in his  classrooms where the banners were  displayed.  Prior to  January 2007,  Plaintiff had not received one \ncomplaint from any  School District administrator,  parent,  [*15]  or  student about the banners.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of \nFacts  at P  89). \n.  \"Plaintiff's banners never prohibited or interfered with his  ability to  educate the  students  in his math class.\"  (Defs.' \nResp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  90). \nMoreover,  Defendant Chiment testified on behalf of the  School  District as  follows: \nQ:  Have you had any information of any negative  connotations  or comments  about  [Plaintiff's]  teaching \nability? \nA:  None. \nQ:  How  about anything  from  a personal perspective? \nA:  None. \nQ: Anyone ever make any complaints that you're aware of that he would proselytize students \nimpermissibly? \nA:  No. \n(Chiment Dep.  at 25  at Ex.  3)  (emphasis  added). \nCombine these  facts  along with the  fact that Defendants permit a  science teacher to  erect in her classroom  a 35  to \nAO  foot personal,  non-curricular display  of Buddhist prayer flags  and it is  overwhelmingly evident that Defendants’ \nalleged fear of an Establishment Clause violation is baseless.  Indeed,  this  evidence  demonstrates that Defendants' \nfeigned Establishment Clause  concern 1s  little more than a pretext for their viewpoint-based restriction of Plaintiff's \nspeech. \nII.  A  \"Balancing  [*16]  Test\"  Does  Not Weigh in  Favor of Restricting Plaintiff's  Speech. \nDefendants  eschew  any forum analysis  in favor of a  \"balancing test\"-albeit,  a test in which Defendants \npredetermine the  outcome  in their favor based on their tendentious view  of the law  and facts.  While  a  \"balancing test\"  is \nnot the proper way to  analyze the  constitutional  issues in this  case,  even the fair application of such a test demonstrates \nthat Defendants violated Plaintiff's  constitutional rights. \nThe balancing test that Defendants  favor was  described in Pickering v.  Board of Educ.,  391  U.S.  563  (1968).  See \nalso Berry v.  Department of Soc.  Serv.,  447 F.3d 642  (9th  Cir.  2006).  This test requires  \"a balance between the  interests \nof the teacher,  as  a citizen,  in commenting upon matters  of public  concern and the interest of the  State,  as  an employer, \nin promoting the  efficiency of the public  services  it performs through its  employees.\" Pickering,  391  U.S.  at 568.  Thus, \nan analysis under this test requires  a ‘rue balancing of interests,  not one  in which the government has  a finger on its  side \nof the  scale,  as  Defendants’  analysis  does. \nConsequently, what  [*17]  evidence  is there to  demonstrate that Plaintiff's  speech harmed the  School District's \n\"interest  ..  .  in promoting the  efficiency  of the public  services it performs through its  employees\"  that is  sufficient to\nPage  7 \n2007  U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions 212047;  2009 U.S.  Dist.  Ct.  Motions  LEXIS  75418,  *17 \ntrump  Plaintiff's  constitutional rights?  The  answer is  simple:  there is no  such evidence.  As Defendants  admit,  \"Plaintiff's \nbanners never prohibited or interfered with  [Plaintiff's]  ability to  educate the  students  in his math class.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to \nStmt.  of Facts  at P  90).  They  admit that during the  30  plus years that Plaintiff has been officially  evaluated,  none  of his \n\"evaluators  ever inform[ed]  him that his banners were  impermissible  or that they disrupted or distracted from Plaintiff's \nteaching  or the  students'  learning in any way.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  31).  They  admit that  \"[d]uring his  30 \nplus years  of teaching 1n the  School District,  Plaintiff has had 7  different school principals,  numerous  school board \nmembers,  superintendents,  assistant superintendents,  over 4,000  students  and  several thousand parents in his  classrooms \nwhere the banners were  displayed[,  and that p]rior to  January 2007,  Plaintiff had not received one  complaint from any \nSchool  [*18]  District administrator,  parent,  or  student about the banners.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  89).  And \nthey  admit that  \"[a]t the time they  directed Plaintiff to remove his banners,  [they]  had no  evidence that Plaintiff's \nbanners  caused any material  disruption or disorder in the  School District.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at P  99).  Thus, \nthere  is no  evidence  of harm to  Defendants,  let alone  sufficient evidence to trump  Plaintiff's  constitutional rights. \nMoreover,  Defendants  admit that  \"[t]he  School District believes that public  schools play  an important role  educating \nand guiding  our youth through the marketplace  of ideas  and instilling national values.  [And o]ne method used by the \nSchool District to  accomplish  [this]  task  .  .  .  1s to permit  students to be  exposed to the rich diversity of backgrounds  and \nopinions held by high  school  faculty.\"  (Defs.'  Resp.  to  Stmt.  of Facts  at PP 63,  64).  Consequently,  Plaintiff's banners \nactually  \"promot[e]  the  efficiency of the public  services  [the  School District]  performs through its  employees.\"  And as \nnoted previously,  Defendants’  fear of an Establishment Clause violation is not plausible under the  facts  of this  case. \n[*19] \nIn the  final  analysis, the balance weighs heavily in favor of protecting Plaintiff's  speech. \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this  court grant his motion for summary judgment. \nRespectfully  submitted, \nTHOMAS  MORE LAW CENTER \nBy:  /s/ Robert J.
