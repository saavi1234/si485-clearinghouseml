The plaintiffs sought equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary and permanent injunction against the defendants, as well as declaratory relief. </p><p>The plaintiffs in the suit alleged that they were being harassed and physically assaulted by other state inmates whenever they were exposed to them, such as when they were being transported to and detained in other facilities (e.g. medical care at other prisons or attending legal proceedings). </p><p>On March 16, 2006, Senior District Court Judge Dickinson Debevoise granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, ordering that in the transport of inmates certain rules be followed to protect the ADTC inmates from verbal or physical abuse. On June 21, 2006, Judge Dickinson Debevoise granted plaintiffs motion to extend the preliminary injunction. </p><p>On August 17, 2006, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). However the Court never addressed this motion, as on November 17, 2006 the case was referred to mediation.  On September 21, 2007 the case was dismissed without prejudice by consent order, as both parties reached a settlement agreement. The details of the settlement agreement are not included on the docket.</p><p></p>",

Additionally,  the  conduct  of  State  Actors \ntowards  Mr.  Krivacska  in  the  last  two  weeks  raises  the  specter  o£ \nretaliatory  interference  with  Plaintiffs'  access  to  the  courts. \nPROCEDURAL  HISTORY  AND  COUNTER-STATEMENT  O.E'  FACTS' \nRespondents  were  served  with  the  complaint  and  TRO  motion  in \nthis  action  on  February  9,  2006.

Mr.  Krivacska'  court  date  of  February  17,  2006  is  prominently \nfeatured  in  Plaint'ffs'  complaint,  Mr.  Krivacska's  declaration  of \nJanuary  10,  2006,  nd  the  memorandum  of  law  supporting  the  TRO \nmotion.  The  State  jought  a  delay  in  this  court's  decision  on  the \nmotion  which  was  o  liginally  scheduled  ·to  be  decided  on  B'ebruary \n14,  2006.  Without !prejudging how  the  court  will  ultimately  rule, \nI \nhad  the  court  deci,ed  the  motion  for  the  Plaintiffs  on  the  14th, \nthe  State  would  hale  been  forced  to  segre  e  Mr.  Krivacska  on  the \n: \n17th,  no  matter  wheither  the  writ  had  been  cancelled  or  not. \nBut  the  State's  request  for  a  delay  so  it could  submit  an \nopposing  brief  on  ~ebruary 17th,  ensured  that  no  order  would  be  in \nplace  to  protect  Mr.  Krivacska  should  he  be  transported  on  that \nday.  Despite  the  writ  being  cancelled,  despite  his  alerting  DOC  to \nthe  cancellation  o  that  writ  five  days  earlier,  despite  advising \nDOC  and  CTU  staff o ·  the  absence  of  a  writ  and  a  request  they \nverify  the  writ  be·  re  transporting  him,  Mr.  Krivacska  was,  in \nfact,  removed  from  state  prison without  a  writ  and  transferred  to \nMonmouth  County. \nUpon  arrival  a  the  courthouse,  Mr.  Krivacska  repeatedly \nconfirm  his  status  ith  Judg~ Neabsey  so  that  he  could  be  returned \nto  A.D.T.C.  that  The  officers  refused  to  contact  the  court. \nAs  it turns  out,  y  didn't  have  to.

Yet,  even  though  CTU  made  a \ntrip  to  Monmouth  County  to  deliver  nine  state  prisoners  to  the \ncourthouse,  on  Tuesday,  the  21st,  Mr.  Krivacska  was  again  left  in \nthe  County  j  by  CTU.  Only,  apparently,  after  family  and  friends \nof Mr.  Krivacska  contacted  administration  at  the  A.D.T.C.  to \nadvise  them  that  Mr.  Kr  ska's  detention  in  the  county  was \ninterfering with  his  access  to  the  courts  on  pend  time \n~ \nsensitive  legal  matters,  did  CTU  finally  return Mr.  Krivacska  to \nA.D.T.C. \nIt  is  unknown  at  this  time  whether  State  actors  knew  that  Mr. \nKrivacska  would  be  kept  in  22  hour  s  day  lockdown  with  no  access \nto  his  legal  papers,  no  access  to  a  law  library  and  no  way  to \ncontact  the  court.  However,  it  is  somewhat  disturbing  that  in \naddition  to  the  fact  that  Mr.  Krivacska  was  rendered  legally \nimpotent  during  a  critical  period  in  the  presentation  of  a  TRO \nmotion,  even  upon  his  return  to  the  A.D.T.C.,  he  remains  the  sole \nPlaintiff who  has  not  received  a  copy  of  the  State's  opposition \nbrief. \nTo  be  clear,  Plaintiffs  are  not  suggest  any  malfeasance  on \nthe  part  of  the  Attorney  General's  e.  and  there  is  no \nevidence  that  DAG  Scott,  herself,  acted  in  any  way \ninappropriately.  However,  DOC  officials  were  directly  served  on \nFebruary  9,  2006,  and  it  is  fair  to  assume  that  in  preparation  to \ndefend  the  action,  the  information  in  the  complaint,  luding  the \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 7    Filed 03/01/06   Page 15 of 29 PageID: 236\n10  Riley,  et  al.  v.

Contrary  to  the  State's  position,  all  six  of \nthese  Plaintiffs,  under  either  version  of  the  SOA,  are  mandated  to \nbe  segregated  at  ADTC  as  long  as  they  cooperate  in  treatment  (the \ntime  parameters  of J:-l_,_L.~. .•. /.:1,_,_  2C; 47-3 (h)  not  applying  to  any  of  the \nPlaintiffs),  If  sentenced  to  ADTC,  the  state  is  required  to \nprovide  treatment  for  the  Plaintiffs'  compulsive  and  repetitive \nbehavior.

As  for  Messrs.

Mr. \nVansciver's  situa  ion  proves  the  point.  While  he  served  his \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 7    Filed 03/01/06   Page 20 of 29 PageID: 241\nRiley,  et  al.  v.

No  inmate  knew  he  was  convicted  of  a  sex  offense  whom  he \ndid  not  himself  tell.  But  as  soon  as  he  was  transferred  to  the \nA.D.T.C ..  and  even  though  he  is  not  sentenc  as  a  compulsive  and \nrepetitive  se~ual offender,  he  is  nevertheless  stigmatized  not \nonly  as  a  sex  offender,  but,  albeit  falsely,  as  a  particularly \ndangerous  and  mentally  disordered  offender.  As  a  result,  it was \nnot  the  nature  of  his  conviction,  but  the  fact  that  DOC  segregated \nhim  in  a  treatment  center  for  mentally  disordered  se~ offenders \nthat  placed  him  at  risk  of  abuse  at  the  hands  of  state  prisoners \nwho  despise  the  inmates  housed  at  the  A.D.T.C. \nFor  this  reason,  the  Plaintiffs'  distinction  is  not  imaginary \nas  claimed  by  the  State,  State  Brief  at  13,  but  quite  ~eal.  And  it \nis  unmistakable  in  the  Complaint  and  the  TRO  motion,  memorandum \nand  accompanying  declarations,  that  it is  not  the  Plaintiffs' \nstatus  as  sex  offenders  that  ls  creating  the  risk,  but  ir State \nsex  offenders  that  poses \nthe  risk. \nThe  State  next  introduces  in  1  brief  a  non  sequitor \nargument  about  liberty  interest,  or  the  lack  of  such  an  lnte~est \nln where  an  inmate  is  housed.  court  should  not  be  distracted \nby  this  irrelevant  argument.

This  argument  is  disingenuous  at  best. \nFirst,  voluntary  choice  implies  a  choice  free  from  fear,  threat  or \ncoercion.  Plaintiffs'  alle  the  presence  of  fear,  threat  and \ncoercion  resulting  from  the  actions  of  State  in  identifying \nthem  as  A.D.T.C.  residents  dur  such  tr  s,  null  s  any  claim \nof  voluntary  choice.  By  the  State's  argument,  forcing  an  inmate  to \nplay  Russian  Roulette  with  a  single  bullet  in  a  six  chamber  gun  in \norder  to  gain  access  to  a  court  or  medical  trip,  constitutes  a \nfree  choice  because  the  inmate  can  always  choose  between  putting \nthe  gun  to  his  head,  pulling  the  trigger  and  trying  his  luck \nversus  refusing  the  trip.  That  is what  it mean$  for  an  A.D.T.C. \ninmate  to  get  on  a  CTU  van  for  a  court  or  medical  trip.  Mr. \nCornwell  cocked  the  gun  one  too  many  times  and  paid  the  price  for \nit.  A.D.T.C.  sentenced  inmates  should  not  be  forced  to  make  such  a \nmacabre  choice. \nSecond,  the  State  has  not  contested  a  single  fact  advanced  by \nthe  Plaintiffs.  It has  submitted  no  affidavits  or  declarations \nfrom  any  DOC  official  challenging  the  veracity  of  the  alle  ions \nset  forth  in  the  complaint,  Consequent  s  Court.,  in \nevaluating whether  to  grant  this  TRO,  should  consider  as  true  all \nof  the  facts  asserted  by  the  Plaint  which  facts.  on  their \nface,  establish  the  long  standing  nature  of  the  risk  to  A.D.T.C. \ninmates.  The  fact.  that  no  one  can  predict  when  the  next  assault \nwill  take  place  is  inconsequential.  The  reality  is  that  another \nassault  will  take  place:  it's just  a  matter  of  time. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 7    Filed 03/01/06   Page 23 of 29 PageID: 244\n18  Riley,  et  al.  v.

And  here, \nPlaintiffs  have  sho~n the  ars  to  be  grounded  in  a  long  history \nof  such  assaults.  F~nally,  the  State  claims  any  injuries  suffered \nwere  \"not  the  result  of  any  action  or  inaction  of  the  Sttit:e \ndefendants\".  Yet  i  the  case  of  Cornwell  and  Braun,  Plaint:iffs \nallege  it was  &pec\"fically  the  action  of  the  State  defendants  in \npurposefully  ident\"fying  them  as  A.D.T.C.  inmates  and  egging  on \nState  prisonero  to  abuse  them,  that  instigated  the  abuse. \nThe  detailed  ~ature of  Plaintiffs'  claims.  the  fact  that  the \nclaims  involve  depJivation  of  First  Amendment  Rights  which \ni \ninherently  constitite  irreparable  harm.  and  the  risk  of  serious \ninjury,  are  exactl  the  types  of  harm  injunctive  relief is \nint  d  to  av~rt.

Brawn,  et  al  19 \nReply  Brief  in  Support  of  Temporary  Restraining  Order \nE.  BALANCE  OF  HARDSHIPS  WARRANTS  GRANT  OF  RELIEF  TO  PLAINTIFFS \nThe  State  again  attempts  to  discount  the  hardships  suffered \nby  the  Plaintiffs  by  framing  any  injury  or  loss  resulting  from  the \nPlaintiffs'  refusal  of  a  court  or  medical  trip  as  one  suffered  as \na  result  of  a  voluntary  choice.  Plaintiffs  disposed  of  that \nargument  in  Point  I.D,  above.  and  won't  repeat  the  argument  or  the \nRussian  Roulette  analogy  here,  incorporating  argument  here. \nby  reference.  Suffice  it to  say  that  Plaintiffs  like Mr.  Macrina \nand  Mr.  Vansciver,  both  elderly  and  sickly,  should  not  have  to \nmake  Hobson's  choice  between  risking  death  from  their \nillnesses  if they  don't  go  on  a  trip,  and  risking  death  from \nanother  inmate  as  a  result  of  an  assault  if they  go  on  the  trip. \nAnd  for  mandatory  court  trips,  there  is  no  choice,  only  risk: \nwhich  the  State  has  failed  to  take  any  actions  to  mitigate. \nMoreover.  it cannot  be  a  hardship  for  the  State  to  perform \nits constitutional  duty.  Even  the  State  cites  Farme.r  v.  BrennaJ1, \n511  U.S~ 825,  832,  114  S.Ct,  1970,  128  I,..Ed.2  811  (1994)  for  the \npropo$ition  that  the  state  has  en  obligation  to  \"take  !;'easonable \nmeasures  to  guarantee  the  safety  of  inmates.''  Plaintiffs'  are \nasking  for  nothing  more,  and  providing  inmates  with  the  safety  to \nwhich  they  are  constitutionally  entitled  constitutes  not  a \nhardship,  but  an  obligation. \nThe  State  again  offers  no  affidavit  or  declaration  either \nasserting  that  granting  the  relief  sought  by  Plaintiffs  would \ncreate  a  hardship,  or  how,  in  particular,  each  form  of  relief \nrequested  would  impose  a  hardship  on  the  state.

RELIEF  SOUGHT  IS  IN  THE  PUBL,IC  INTEREST \nAs  argued  in  Plaintiffs'  memorandum  of  law,  there  is  a  strong \npublic  interest  in  keeping  prisoners  safe  from  assault,  even  sex \noffenders.  But  the  public  interest  goes  farther. \nThe  State  contends  that  CTU  would  be  required  to  provide \nadditional  transports  to  and  from  A.D.T.C.  to  grant  this  relief. \nThis  does  not  seem  logical.  The  same  number  of  transports  to  and \nfrom  A.D.T.C.  would  occur  with  or  without  the  relief  granted.  The \ndifference  is  that  if the  relief is  granted  the  vehicle  traveling \nto  and  from  A.D.T.C.  may  not  be  making  additional  stops  to  pick  up \ninmates  from  other  state  prisons.  But  even  that  is  not  certain.  As \nMr.  Krivacska  reported  in  his  Declat\"ation  of  l/10/06.  when  was \ntransported  to  New  Jersey  State  Prison  for  dental  work,  he  was \nseparated  on  the  vehicle  from  prisoners  from  other  institutions  by \nan  empty  row  seats  and  strict  enforcement  of  the  DOC  policy \nthat  inmates  remain  in  their  seats  during  transport.  While  this \ndoes  not  necessary  eliminate  verbal  harassment,  the  verbal \nharassment  s  red  by  Mr.  Krivacska  in August  2002  and  Mr.  Braun \nin  December  2005,  was  made  particularly  onerous  and  traumatizing \nbecause  Mr.  Kt\"ivacska  and  Mr.  Braun  were  forced  to  sit next  to  the \nstate  prisoners  making  the  threato,  creating  the  very  real  risk \nthat  the  verbal  threats  would  be  carried  out.  This  is  a \nconsiderably  more  psychologically  traumatic  threat  than  an  empty \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 7    Filed 03/01/06   Page 27 of 29 PageID: 248\n22  1  Riley.  et  al.  v.

And  again, \nthe  State  has  d  no  affidavit  or  declaration  from  anyone  at \nDOC  or  CTU  g  that  transport  A.D.T.C.  inmates  on \nseparate  vans  would: pose  any  problem  for  DOC  at  all.  The  DAG \noffering  unsupported  conclusions  in  opposing  the  relief 1 \nFinally.  the  s~atus ~0 actually  creates  a  public  s  risk \nthat  is  certainly  in  the  interest  of  the  public,  one  which  the \n+t \nrelief  sought  easi y  remedies.  Placing  A.D.T.C.  inmates  within \nphysical  reach  of  tate  prisoners,  creates  the  risk  of  an  assault \nbreaking  out  on  th  transport  vehicle,  as  occurred  during  Todd \nBecka's  trip.  See  omplaint.  1/10/06.  •157-169.  Such  an  assault \ncould  break  out  in  o  a  melee  if the  A.D.T.C.  inmate  attempts  to \ndefend  himself.  Fi bting  between  DOC  inmates  on  a  moving  vehicle \nposes  an  enormous  isk  to  the  public  as  a  distracted  DOC  officer \nis  happening  his  vehicle  and  the  road  he  is  trying \nto  navi  e,  the  risk  of  an  accident.  Clearly.  the \nrelief  sought,  by  the  rjsk  of  confrontations  on  court  and \nmedical  trips  be  and  state  inmates,  is  in  the  public \ninterest. \n\nI 1\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 7    Filed 03/01/06   Page 28 of 29 PageID: 249\n1, \nRiley,  et  al.  v.

The \ncomplaint  upon  which  this  action  is  based  alleges  violation  of \nPlaintiffs'  and  class  members'  constitutional  rights  under  the \nFirst,  Eighth  and  Fourteenth Amendments  to  the  Constitution  of \nthe  United  States.  Specifically,  the  complaint  alleges  denial  of \nright  of  access  to  the  courts  under  the  First Amendment; \nimposition  of  cruel  and  unusual  puni~hment in  violation  of  the \nEighth  Amendment  resulting  from  interference  with  the  exercise  of \ninmates'  rights  to  necessary  medical  treatment,  and  from \nsubject  inmates  to  serious  physical  injury.  or  threat  of  such \ninjury;  and  denial  of  protected  property  and  liberty  interests \nunder  the  Fourteenth Amendment. \nPlaintiffs  allege  that  Defendants,  acting  under  the  color  of \nstate  law,  have  failed  and  continue  to  fail  to  provide  the \nPlaintiffs  with  protection  from  risk  of  serious  assault,  injury \nand  even  death  at  the  hands  of  violent  and  dangerous  state \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 3-1    Filed 01/18/06   Page 7 of 37 PageID: 94 '  ' \n2  Riley,  et  al  v.  Brown,  et  al \nprisoners,  during medical,  court  and  other  trips  outside  of  the \nA.D.T.C.  facility. \nSpecifically,  he  complaint  alleges  that  inmates  housed  at \nthe  A.D.T.C.

Such  State  Prisoners  harbor \nparticular  enmity  toward  A.D.T.C.  inmates  because  of  the  nature \nof  their  crimes  (  exual  offenses),  and  seek  to  cause  them \nphysical  and  psyc  ological  harm  in  the  absence  of  protection  by \nNew  Jersey  Departient  of  Corrections  (DOC)  officials. \nThe  failure  o~ Defendants  to  adopt  and  implement  policies. \npractices.  and  pr  cedures  that  segregate  and  protect  A.D.T.C. \ninmates  from  assa  lt by  State  Prisoners,  has  in  the  past  resulted \nin A.D.T.C.  inmat  s  suffering  serious  physical  injury  at  ~he \nhands  of  State  Pr  soners.

He  was  placed,  along  with  another  A.D.T.C. \ninmate,  Zhi-men  Chen,  into  a  holding  tank  with  about  a  dozen \nState  Prisoners.  While  his  wrist  shackles  were  being  removed,  one \nof  the  corrections  officers  announced  that  the  two  inmates  were \nfrom  \"Avenel,\"  which  in  the  parlance  of  the  New  Jersey  Prison \nsystem  is  understood  to  be  the  A.D.T.C.  facility which  houses  sex \noffenders.

He  would \nreceive  neurological  consults  at  NJSP  approximately  every  three \nmonths  and  neurological  evaluations  at  St.  Francis  approximately \ntwice  a  year. \nUpon  his  transfer  to  the  A.D.T.C.  however,  that  situation \nchanged.  Mr.  Vansciver,  because  of  his  neurological  problems  and \nseizure  disorder,  is  at  particular  risk  of  serious  brain  damage \nor  death  should  he  suffer  a  blow  to  the  head.  After  learning  of \nthe  assault  on  Paul  Cornwell.  in  particular  the  blow  he  suffered \nto  his  head,  Mr.  Vansciver  became  fearful  for  his  life  if he \ncontinued  on  these  trips  and  no  effort  was  made  to  segre  e  or \nprotect  him  from  State  Prisoners.  Consequently.  Mr.  Vansciver  has \nnot  been  receiving  the  neurological  consults  or  monitoring  via \nEEG  evaluation  (Electro-encephalogram),  he  needs  to monitor  his \nmedication  and  control  his  seizures.  As  a  result,  Mr.  Vansciver \ncontinues  to  suffer  and  will  continue  to  suffer  grand  mal  and \npetite mal  seizures.

Each  of these  factors  favors  the  grant  of  this motion. \nA.  PLAINTIFFS  ARE  THREATENED  WITH  IRREPARABLE  HARM \nPlaintiffs  Riley.  Krivacska.  Gibbs  and  Braun  face  irreparable \nharm  with  respect  to  the  various  civil  cases  they  have  pending \nbefore  Superior  Court  if they  choose  to  waive  appearances  at \nthose  proceedings  out  of  fear  of  being  assaulted  or  killed  by  a \nState  Prisoner while  being  transported  to  court.  In  Mr.  Riley's \ncase,  that  irreparable  harm  would  be,  at  worse,  dismissal  of  his \nPCR  petition,  irrespective  of  its merits,  or  waiver  of  rights  or \narguments  at  a  pre-hearing  proceeding.  Mr.  Krivacska  and  Mr. \nGibbs  face  a  similar  form  of  irreparable  harm  with  respect  to \ntheir  PCR  petitions,  including  waiving  arguments  or  relevant \n\n. \n/ \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 3-1    Filed 01/18/06   Page 27 of 37 PageID: 114\n22  Riley,  et  al  v.

Mr. \nGibbs'  attorney ha  filed  a  motion  seeking  recusal  of  Judge  LeBon \nfrom  hearing  Mr.  G'bbs'  PCR  Petition.  This  attorney has \ncommunicated  to  Mr.  Gibbs  that  it is  very  important  that  Mr. \nGibbs  attend  so  th  t  his  testimony  can  be  taken,  in  absence  of \nwhich  he  risks  hav'ng  the  motion  denied.  Against  his  counsel's \nrecommendation  and  solely  because  of  fear  for  his  s  and \nlife,  Mr.  Gibbs  wi  1  have  to  waive  his  right  to  appear  on  this \nmotion  unless  the  otion  for  the  TRO  is  granted. \nr \nI \nFor  his  part.  Krivacska  additionally  faces  irreparable \nharm  in  the  form  o  a  binding  judgment  against  him  for  over \n$100,000  in  a  pend~ng civil  action  in  Essex  County  Superior \nCourt,  should  he  ive  appearance  at  trial. \nFor  Mr.  Gibbs,  Mr.  Krivacska,  Mr.  Braun  and  Mr.  Riley,  the \nirreparable  harm  wpuld  ,;nsue  from  the  dangerous  conditions  in \nwhich  DOC  would  require  the  PJ.aintiffs  to  be  transported,  so \ndangerous  as  to  e  fectively  deny  them  their  right  to  access  to \nthe  courts  under  t  e  First  Amendment.  This  harm  is  imminent  as \n11r.  Gibbs,  Mr.  Braun  or  Mr.  Krivacska  could  be  call \nto  app,;ar  in  court  at  any  tim,;  in  their  respective  civil  actions, \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 3-1    Filed 01/18/06   Page 28 of 37 PageID: 115\nRiley.  et  al  v.

He \nhas  a  court  appearance  on  a  recusal  motion  schedul  for  January \n30,  2006  and  is  immediately  confronted  with  the  choice  of  waiving \nhis  constitutionally  protected  rights  and  relinquishing  valid \nclaims  he  may  have  regarding  the  need  for  his  PCR  judge  to  recuse \nherse  from  further  involvement  in the  proceedings.  or  risk \nserious  injury  or  death  if he  chooses  to  make  his  appearance.  For \nMr.  Gibbs  the  irreparable harm  would  ensue  from  the  dangerous \nconditions  in which  DOC  would  require  Mr.  Gibbs  to  be \ntransported,  so  dangerous  as  to  effectively  deny  him  his  right  to \naccess  to  the  courts  under  the  First Amendment.  This  harm  is  very \nimminent  as  Mr.  Gibbs  has  been  called  upon  to  appear  in  court  on \nJanuary  30,  2006,  just  a  few  days  away,  and  there  is  insufficient \ntime  for  Mr.  Gibbs  to  pursue  any  other  form  of  relief. \nMr.  Braun  will  again  shortly  need  to  appear  in  Family  Court \nin  Union  County  and  will  again  be  at  risk  for  suffering \nirreparable harm  if he  is  again  physically  and  psychological \nassaulted  by  dangerous  and  violent  State  prisoners  should  the  CTU \ncontinue  to  refuse  to  s  egate  him .. \nPlaint  Cornwell,  Macrina,  Vansciver  and  Braun  are  likely \nto  suffer  irreparable  harm  of  a  different  var  ,  In  case, \nthese  Plaintiffs  suffer  from  serious  medical  conditions  for  which \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 3-1    Filed 01/18/06   Page 29 of 37 PageID: 116\n24 \nRiley,  et  al  v.

THE  BALANCE  OF  HARDSHIPS  FAVORS  THE  PLAINTIFFS \ni \nIn  deciding  whether  to  grant  T!W'.s  and  preliminary \ninjunctions,  courts  ask  whether  the  suffering  of  the  moving  party \nif the  motion  is  denied  will  outweigh  the  suffering  of  the  non· \nmoving  party  the  motion  is  granted.  See  e.g., \nCuomo,  748  F.2d,  supra  at  808  (holding  that  dangers  posed  by \nprison  overcrowding  outweighed  state's  financial  and \nadministrative  concerns};  Duran  v.

Among  the  harms  the  Plaintiffs  will  suffer  from  are \nserious  medical  disability  or  death  either  from  assault  during  a \nmedical  trip  or  court  trip,  or  in  the  case  of  those  with  chronic, \ndebilitating medical  conditions,  serious  medical  disability  or \ndeath  from  untreated  medical  conditions.

THE  RELIEF  SOU  HT  WILL  SERVE  THE  PUBLIC  INTEREST \nThe  public  in  erest  is  certainly  served  by  protecting \nprisoners  from  ne  dless  and  senseless  violence.  Society  has  a \nstrong  interest  i  rehabilitation.  an  interest which  is \nshortchanged  when  prisoners  suffer  injury  or  death  at  the  hands \nof  other  prisoner  .  That  interest  is  even  stronger  in  the  case  of \nthose  sentenced  t  the  A.D.T.C.  The  public,  through  its  elected \nlegislators,  has  etermined  that  its  interests  are  particularly \nserved  by  providi  g  comprehensive  psychological  treatment  to \nthose  convicted  o  sexual  offenses.  Allowing  those  in  treatment \nto  be  subjected  t  physical  and  psycholo  al  harm,  runs  counter \nto  the  purpose  of  treatment. \nThe  public  aljo  has  an  interest  in  safe  and  secure  prisons. \ni \nAs  illustrated  byjMr.  Cornwell's  case,  allowing  unsafe  conditions \nto  persist  and  re  ult  in  injury  to  prisoners,  increases  the  cost \nI \nof  operating  the  prisons.

Krivacska, Paul Cornwell, Vincent Macrina, William F.\nVansciver, Richard A. Gibbs, and Peter Braun, who are state inmates currently housed in the\nAdult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (“ADTC”) in Avenel, New Jersey, filed a complaint\nagainst Defendants, Devon Brown, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections\n(“DOC”), William Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and various John Does,\nemployees of the DOC, claiming that Defendants denied them certain constitutional rights and\nunlawfully discriminated against them by failing to protect them from other state inmates during\nvisits to other facilities for medical treatment and legal proceedings.  The factual allegations of\nthe complaint are supported by affidavits which have not been denied by counter affidavits.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs’ complaint lists the following counts: (1) violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment right to substantive and procedural due process; (2) violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment right of equal protection; (3) violation of the First Amendment right to\nseek redress and to have access to the courts; (4) violation the New Jersey Law Against\nDiscrimination (“NJLAD”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (5) violation of the\nEighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.  \nPlaintiffs assert those claims on behalf of all inmates currently held at ADTC and wish to\nhave their complaint certified as a class action.  Plaintiffs now move for a temporary restraining\norder and/or preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from engaging in any further violations. \nPlaintiffs also move for appointment of pro bono counsel.\nI.  BACKGROUND\n2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 3 of 20(cid:10)\n  ADTC is a facility operated by the DOC for the detention and treatment of inmates who\nhave been convicted of sexual offenses and found to be compulsive and repetitive in their\noffending behavior.  Plaintiffs allege that prisoners such as themselves, who have been convicted\nof sexual offenses, are the most despised and reviled inmates in the prison system.  As such,\nPlaintiffs allege that they are harassed and physically assaulted by other state inmates whenever\nthey are exposed to those inmates, such as when they are transported to and detained in other\nfacilities (e.g., when they seek medical care at another prison or attend a legal proceeding).  As\nPlaintiffs wish to represent a class of inmates they state that each member of the class has\nsuffered from the violations alleged in the complaint.  In addition, each named Plaintiff alleges\nfacts specific to his own experience.\nClaims of Plaintiff Paul Cornwell\nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was transported from ADTC to the New Jersey State Prison\n(“NJSP”) on May 24, 2005 to receive physical therapy for a herniated disc.  After receiving\nmedical treatment he was transported to the Garden State Correctional Facility and placed in a\nholding area with another ADTC inmate, Zhi-men Chen, and approximately twelve other state\nprisoners for a period of about three hours.\nMr. Cornwell alleges that when he and Mr. Chen were placed in the holding area, one of\nthe two corrections officers announced to the other prisoners that Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Chen\nwere from Avenel, implying that they were sex offenders.  The two officers then allegedly stood\noutside a Plexiglass window and observed the events that followed.\nAccording to Mr. Cornwell, the other inmates began asking him and Mr. Chen questions. \n3\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 4 of 20(cid:10)\nThey first asked Mr. Chen where he was from and Mr. Chen responded that he was from ADTC. \nTo that, another inmate said, “I know that place; that’s where all the rapists go.”  After several\nother questions another inmate allegedly asked Mr. Cornwell, “what did you do, rape a little\ngirl?”  The inmate then allegedly stood up and began yelling, accusing Mr. Cornwell of raping a\nlittle girl.  The inmate then allegedly sat down next to Mr. Cornwell and punched him in the\nchest.  He then allegedly demanded the gold chain and cross that Mr. Cornwell was wearing.  Mr.\nCornwell says that he replied, “I’m not giving you my fucking chain.”\nThe inmate then allegedly stood up and offered Mr. Cornwell an outstreched hand, saying\n“I’m sorry.”  When Mr. Cornwell shook the inmate’s hand, the inmate allegedly pulled Mr.\nCornwell forward and punched him in the left temple, knocking him to the floor and knocking\nhim unconscious.  \nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was assaulted while he was unconscious and that when he\nawoke he had a large abrasion on his right arm and that the officers, still standing on the other\nside of the Plexiglass, had not responded.  Mr. Cornwell alleges that Mr. Chen gave a statement\nin which he said that after Mr. Cornwell was knocked out, the assault continued for several\nminutes and that Mr. Cornwell was “pummeled with fists and kicked with feet about his body\nwhile he was unconscious and defenseless” and yet the officers did nothing to stop the assault. \nMr. Cornwell was then allegedly taken to the infirmary and given a bag of ice for his head.\nAfter returning to ADTC Mr. Cornwell allegedly reported the incident to Sergeant Collins\nand was then examined by a nurse.  Mr. Cornwell alleges that his injuries included head injuries\nleading to dizziness and loss of consciousness, severe swelling in his face, and injuries to his\n4\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 5 of 20(cid:10)\nright arm that eventually required surgery.  He says he was hospitalized for a total of 55 days and\nhas a permanent scar on his right arm because of the assault.  He further alleges that he suffered\nsevere psychological symptoms and that he was diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress\ndisorder resulting from the assault.  \nMr. Cornwell further alleges that since the attack he has declined medical treatment\nbecause he is afraid of suffering another attack.  He says he filed a grievance with the DOC\nregarding the May 24th incident but that the DOC rejected it.  He also says that he filed a Tort\nClaim Notice against the DOC but that it was denied.  As such, he says the DOC has been\ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of future attacks.\nClaims of Plaintiff Peter Braun\nPlaintiff, Peter Braun, alleges that he was assaulted by a state inmate from another facility\nwhen he was returning from a court hearing at the Union County Courthouse on December 13,\n2005.  Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that he was driven past the ADTC facility in Avenel to\nBordentown, in Mercer County, where he was transferred to a van in the parking lot of the\nGarden State Youth Correctional Facility.  Mr. Braun further states that he was placed in the back\nseat of the van next to two state inmates from another facility, even though the front row of seats\nin the van’s inmate compartment was empty.\nMr. Braun alleges that for the next hour and forty minutes, while the van drove to\nNorthern State Prison in Newark, he was “subjected to a barrage of harassment, intimidation,\nphysical assault and psychological torture.”  (Compl. ¶ 142).  Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that\none of the other prisoners grabbed him, shoved his fist at him, threatened to punch and shank\n5\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 6 of 20(cid:10)\nhim, and pulled on his collar and sleeves looking for jewelry and a watch.  Mr. Braun alleges that\nthe inmate told him that the “‘cops ain’t going to help you, they set you up and told us to have\nfun with you.’”  (Compl. ¶ 144).  In addition, the other inmate allegedly told Mr. Braun that the\nDOC officers told the inmates that he was from ADTC and was a convicted sex offender.  Mr.\nBraun further states that the two other inmates then threatened to torture, kill and rape him. \nFinally, Mr. Braun says the DOC officers could see and hear everything that occurred and that\nthey were laughing and making jokes about the threats and harassment.  \nMr. Braun states that he requires frequent transport for both medical treatment and court\nhearings.  He says the assault on December 13th left him severely distraught and afraid of making\nfuture trips in DOC custody.\nMr. Braun alleges that he filed an ARF on December 22, 2005, asking to be segregated on\nfuture trips.  He says that he has not received any response to the ARF.\nClaims of Plaintiff George Riley\nPlaintiff, George Riley, alleges the following:  He is Chairman of the ADTC Legal\nSubcommittee to the Inmate Resident Committee.  In that capacity, and on his own behalf, he\nwrote to Grace Rogers, ADTC Administrator, to request that procedures be put in place to protect\nADTC inmates from other state prisoners when they are transported.  Bernard Goodwin,\nAssociate Administrator, responded with a letter telling Mr. Riley that only the DOC Central\nOffice, not ADTC, had authority to change the procedures in question.  Thus, Mr. Riley wrote to\nDefendant, William Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and repeated his request.  He\nhas not received a response from Mr. Plantier.\n6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 7 of 20(cid:10)\nMr. Riley does not allege that he has ever been personally assaulted by other state\ninmates.  However, he says he is aware of such assaults on ADTC inmates and fears that\nDefendants’ failure to prevent such attacks presents an imminent risk to his health and safety as\nhe will need the DOC to transport him for court appearances and medical treatment in the near\nfuture.\nClaims of Plaintiff James J. Krivacska\nPlaintiff, James J. Krivacska, like Mr. Riley, does not allege that he has ever been\npersonally assaulted by other state inmates.  On the contrary, Mr. Krivacska describes his May\n31, 2005 visit to NJSP that transpired without incident.  Presumably, his account serves as an\nexample of how Plaintiffs wish to be transported as Mr. Krivacska describes being segregated\nfrom other inmates at all times and says that DOC officers protected him from other inmates and\ntook precautions to conceal his identity as an ADTC inmate.   \nDespite that positive experience, Mr. Krivacska alleges that he is afraid of future trips,\neither for medical care or court proceedings, because of what happened to Mr. Cornwell on May\n24, 2005.  Mr. Krivacska alleges that he filed an Administrative Remedy Form (“ARF”)\nexpressing his concern regarding the assault on Mr. Cornwell and indicating his fear of making\nfuture trips for medical care and court proceedings.  \nMr. Goodwin allegedly responded to the ARF with the same explanation he gave to Mr.\nRiley, i.e., that ADTC had no authority to change transport procedures.  Mr. Krivacska alleges\nthat he appealed Mr. Goodwin’s decision to no avail.  \nClaims of Plaintiff Vincent Macrina\n7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 8 of 20(cid:10)\nPlaintiff, Vincent Macrina, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on one\noccasion he was placed in a large holding cell with other state inmates while awaiting medical\ntreatment.  As he alleges that he suffers from several serious medical conditions he says he needs\nfrequent medical attention but turns it down because he is afraid of being assaulted by other state\ninmates during the transport process.\nClaims of Plaintiff William F. Vansciver\nPlaintiff, William F. Vansciver, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on\nvarious occasions, when being transported for medical purposes, DOC officers identified him as\nan ADTC inmate to other state inmates, thereby putting him at risk of assault.  Mr. Vansciver\nalleges that he suffers from serious medical conditions and needs frequent medical attention. \nHowever, he states that he has declined medical attention because of the risk involved in seeking\nsuch attention.\nClaims of Plaintiff Richard Gibbs\nPlaintiff, Richard Gibbs, does not claim to have been assaulted but says he is aware of the\nattack on Mr. Cornwell and assault of Mr. Braun.  Although he wishes to attend court hearings\nconnected with his post-conviction relief hearing, he says he is afraid to attend because of the\nrisk involved in being transported to the hearings.\nAssault of Todd Becka\nIn addition to the above allegations Plaintiffs describe an attack on a former ADTC\ninmate, Todd Becka that allegedly occurred on July 20, 2004.  Mr. Becka, according to Plaintiffs’\nallegations, was threatened and attacked by an inmate from another facility while in transport to\n8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 9 of 20(cid:10)\nreceive medical attention.  The details of Plaintiffs’ allegations are drawn from a complaint that\nMr. Becka filed with the ADTC administration.  Plaintiffs state that Mr. Becka was punched in\nthe head and subjected to repeated threats of violence and that the DOC officers who were\npresent at the time did nothing to protect him.\nPlaintiffs claim to know of other ADTC inmates who have suffered verbal and physical\nabuse from inmates of other facilities while on medical or court trips but do not describe any of\nthose incidents.\nII.  DISCUSSION\nStandard of Review for a Temporary Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction\nA preliminary injunction “is ‘an extraordinary remedy, which should be granted only in\nlimited circumstances.’” Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 290 F.3d 578,\n586 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 800\n(3d Cir. 1989)).  “[T]he movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek\nv. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997).  Moreover, “[a] preliminary injunction cannot be issued\nwhen there are disputed issues of fact.  Hunterdon Transformer Co. v. Cook, No. 89-3132, 1990\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 1382, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 1990).\nTo obtain an injunction, [a movant must] demonstrate (1) that [it is] reasonably likely to\nprevail eventually in the litigation and (2) that [it is] likely to suffer irreparable injury\nwithout relief.  If these two threshold showings are made the District Court then\nconsiders, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an injunction would harm [the non-movant]\nmore than denying relief would harm the [movant] and (4) whether granting relief would\nserve the public interest.\nTenafly Eruv Ass’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2002).  Specifically,\n9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 10 of 20(cid:10)\nwith respect to the second part of the analysis, “[t]o obtain injunctive relief, a party must make a\nclear showing of ‘immediate irreparable injury’ or a ‘presently existing actual threat.’” \nMarsellis-Warner Corp. v. Rabens, 51 F. Supp. 2d 508, 528 (D.N.J. 1999) (quoting Acierno v.\nNew Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 655 (3d Cir. 1994)).\n1. Likelihood of success on the merits\nFor a moving party to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of ultimate success in the\nlitigation “it is not necessary that the moving party's right to a final decision after trial be wholly\nwithout doubt; rather, the burden is on the party seeking relief to make a prima facie case\nshowing a reasonable probability that it will prevail on the merits.”   Oburn v. Shapp, 521 F.2d\n142, 148 (3d Cir. 1975).  Thus, for Plaintiffs to satisfy their burden they must establish a prima\nfacie case for at least one of their claims.  \nA. Eighth Amendment Protection Against Cruel and Unusual Punishment\nThe Eighth Amendment's ban on inflicting cruel and unusual punishments . . .\n‘[proscribes] more than physically barbarous punishments.’  It prohibits penalties that are grossly\ndisproportionate to the offense, as well as those that transgress today's ‘broad and idealistic\nconcepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency.’”  Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S.\n678, 685 (U.S. 1978).  \n“It is undisputed that the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under\nwhich he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.”  Helling v.\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (U.S. 1993).  “‘When the State takes a person into its custody and\nholds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume\n10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 11 of 20(cid:10)\nsome responsibility for his safety and general well being . . . .”’  Id. at 32.  As such, “[t]he Eighth\nAmendment . . . requires that inmates be furnished with the basic human needs,” including\nmedical care and a reasonably safe environment.  Id. at 33. \nThe Supreme Court has further stated that prison officials have an obligation to not only\nprotect inmates from immediate harms but to also protect them from “condition[s] of\nconfinement that [are] sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering [in] the\nnext week or month or year.”  Id. at 33.  With regard to claims of unsafe conditions, the Court\nsaid that “a prisoner need not wait until he is actually assaulted before obtaining relief.”  Id. at 34\n(citing Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 572 (10th Cir. 1980).  Thus, “the Eighth Amendment\nprotects against sufficiently imminent dangers as well as current unnecessary and wanton\ninfliction of pain and suffering . . . .”  Id.\nTo prove a cause of action against a prison official for the deprivation of basic necessities\na prisoner must satisfy a two prong test.  First, the prisoner must show that the alleged\ndeprivation is, “objectively, ‘sufficiently serious’[and that the] prison official's act or omission . .\n.  result[ed] in the denial of ‘the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities[.]’  For a claim . .\n. based on a failure to prevent harm, the inmate must show that he is incarcerated under\nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\n(1994).\nSecond, the prisoner must show that the prison official acted with “a ‘sufficiently\nculpable state of mind.’  In prison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of ‘deliberate\nindifference’ to inmate health or safety . . . .”  Id.  Deliberate indifference exists where a prison\n“official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .”  Id. at 837. \n11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 12 of 20(cid:10)\nFurthermore, “the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and . . . must also draw the inference.”  Id. \nHowever, a prisoner “need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that\nharm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite\nhis knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.”  Id. at 842.\nIn claims against prison supervisors, the above standard is modified, requiring an inmate\nto prove, in addition to the above elements, that his injury was caused by a supervisor’s failure to\nestablish or enforce appropriate policies or practices.\nSupervisor-centered claims against prison officials are analyzed under the\nfour-prong test set forth in Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099 (3d Cir. 1989). \nUnder the Sample test, to hold a supervisor liable because his policies or practices\nled to an Eighth Amendment violation, the plaintiff must identify a specific policy\nor practice that the supervisor failed to employ and show that: (1) the existing\npolicy or practice created an unreasonable risk of the Eighth Amendment injury;\n(2) the supervisor was aware that the unreasonable risk was created; (3) the\nsupervisor was indifferent to that risk; and (4) the injury resulted from the policy\nor practice.\nLiles v. Camden County Dep't of Corr., 225 F. Supp. 2d 450, 463 (D.N.J. 2002).  Prison\nsupervisors may not be held responsible under a respondeat superior theory of liability. \nDempsky v. Walker, No. 05-4483, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22983, at *12 (D.N.J. Sept. 29, 2005).\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs claim they suffered injuries and are likely to suffer further\ninjuries due to Defendants’ failure to protect them from other state inmates.  Plaintiffs allege that\nDefendants’ practice of identifying them as sex offenders and refusing to separate them from\nother state inmates when they place them in vehicles and holding cells with such inmates creates\nan unreasonable risk that they will be assaulted by those inmates.  Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that\nthe risk of assault has prevented them from seeking necessary medical care.\n12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 13 of 20(cid:10)\nWith regard to the first element in the above test, Plaintiffs can show that Defendants’\npractice created an unreasonable risk by presenting “evidence that such harm has in fact occurred\non numerous occasions.”  Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1118 (3d Cir. 1989).  In Liles, 225\nF. Supp. at 462, two inmates brought a cruel and unusual punishment claim against DOC\nsupervisors and employees alleging that the defendants’ policy of having some inmates sleep on\nmattresses on the floor of their cells, near the toilet, such that they were splashed with urine when\nother inmates used the toilet, led to several fights breaking out between inmates.  Plaintiffs\nalleged that the condition led to one of the plaintiffs having a fight with another inmate on one\noccasion and the other plaintiff having fights on at least two occasions.  Id.  The court said that\nthose “incidents establish[ed] a pattern of violence” and that such allegations raised a question of\nfact, sufficient to survive summary judgment, as to whether the condition “constituted a threat to\nthe health and safety of [the plaintiffs] that violated the Eighth Amendment.”  Id.   \nIn the present case, Plaintiffs allege that prison officials engage in a practice of\nidentifying them as sex offenders, placing them in close proximity to other state inmates, and\nfailing to protect them from assaults by those inmates.  As evidence of that practice, Plaintiffs\noffer detailed accounts of three separate violent attacks: one on Plaintiff Cornwell, one on\nPlaintiff Braun, and one on former inmate Becka.  Moreover, due to those assaults, Plaintiffs\nallege that they are afraid to seek medical care because they cannot do so without risking physical\ninjury.  Such conditions “transgress today’s ‘broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized\nstandards, humanity, and decency.’” Hutto, 437 U.S. at 685.  No member of society should be\nsubjected to violent attack nor should anyone have to risk such an attack to receive medical care. \nThus, Plaintiffs have established a pattern of violence that constitutes an unreasonable risk to\n13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 14 of 20(cid:10)\ntheir Eighth Amendment rights.  They have therefore satisfied their burden under the first\nelement of the above test.\nWith regard to the second element, Plaintiffs say they notified various prison officials of\nthe unsafe condition.  Specifically:\n! Mr. Riley allegedly wrote a letter to Ms. Rogers asking for better protection during\ntransportation.  Mr. Goodwin allegedly responded to that letter stating that ADTC\nadministrators could not do anything to alter current procedures and that only the DOC\nCentral Office had authority over such matters.  Thus, Mr. Riley says he wrote to Mr.\nPlantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, requesting greater protection.  Mr. Riley\nsays he has received no response to that letter.\n! Mr. Cornwell allegedly filed a grievance with the DOC and a Tort Claim Notice against\nthe DOC regarding his alleged assault but says both were denied.  In addition, Mr.\nCornwell says he reported the incident to Sergeant Collins and was hospitalized for fifty\nfive days.\n! Mr. Krivacska allegedly filed an ARF expressing his concern over the assault on Mr.\nCornwell but says that Mr. Goodwin responded with the same explanation he gave to Mr.\nRiley.\n! Mr. Braun allegedly filed an ARF asking to be segregated on medical trips but says he has\nnot received any response.\n! Mr. Becka allegedly filed a complaint with the ADTC administration regarding the\nassault he suffered.\nOf the above notifications, Mr. Riley’s letter to Mr. Plantier is the only evidence that\n14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 15 of 20(cid:10)\ncould prove that either of the named Defendants had actual knowledge of the alleged dangerous\ncondition but there is no proof that Mr. Plantier actually read the letter.  However, Mr.\nGoodwin’s responses to both Mr. Riley and Mr. Krivacska show that Mr. Goodwin had actual\nknowledge of the condition.  Although Mr. Goodwin is not named as a defendant, Plaintiffs’\ncomplaint alleges claims against John Does, DOC employees.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ allegations are\nsufficient to satisfy Plaintiffs’ burden of showing that a defendant supervisor was aware of the\nunreasonable risk created under the existing transport procedures.\nIn addition, Plaintiffs’ other letters, complaints, Administrative Remedy Forms and\nallegation that Mr. Cornwell spent fifty five days in the hospital, which suggests that prison\nofficials must have known of his assault, tend to show that other prison officials were also aware\nof the unsafe condition.  As stated in Liles, “[a] defendant’s knowledge of a risk can be proved\nindirectly by circumstantial evidence . . . .”  Id. at 463.  Plaintiffs’ allegations show that other\nprison officials, in addition to Mr. Goodwin, likely knew of the unsafe condition as well. \nAs to the third element, Plaintiffs claim that prison supervisors have acted with deliberate\nindifference in that they have failed to correct the unsafe condition.  Mr. Goodwin allegedly\nstated that ADTC has no authority to change the procedures by which prisoners are transported. \nHowever, that explanation does not relieve Mr. Goodwin of his duty to protect ADTC inmates\nwhen he knows they are being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment.  As stated above,\nprison officials have an affirmative duty to protect inmates from immediate threats as well as\nconditions that are likely to cause harm in the future.  Mr. Goodwin’s knowledge of the unsafe\ncondition and his failure to correct it, or even attempt to correct it, show that he knew of, and\ndisregarded an excessive risk to inmate health and safety.  Thus, Plaintiffs have satisfied their\n15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 16 of 20(cid:10)\nburden for the third element.\nRegarding the fourth element, Plaintiffs’ past injuries and the likelihood of future injuries\narise from prison officials’ current practice of telling other state inmates that Plaintiffs are sex\noffenders when they put Plaintiffs in vehicles and holding cells with those inmates.  Thus,\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden as to this element as well.  \nAs Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden under all four of the above elements, they have\nsucceeded in establishing a prima facie case showing a reasonable probability that they will\nprevail on the merits with regard to their claim of cruel and unusual punishment against Mr.\nGoodwin.  As it seems likely that other prison officials were also aware of, and disregarded, the\nunsafe condition, it is probable that Plaintiffs will prevail in their claims against other officials as\nwell.  \nIn addition to their Eighth Amendment claim, Plaintiffs’ complaint lists four other causes\nof action.  The merits of those claims need not be analyzed at the present time as Plaintiffs have\nshown a likelihood of success on a claim that will entitle them to the requested relief if they\nsucceed in establishing the remaining elements in the preliminary injunction analysis.\nLikelihood of suffering irreparable injury\n“The Third Circuit has interpreted ‘irreparable harm’ to mean ‘that which cannot be\nrepaired, retrieved, put down again [or] atoned for.’”  Monmouth County Correctional Institution\nInmates v. Lanzaro, 643 F. Supp. 1217, 1228 (D.N.J. 1986).  “In order to demonstrate irreparable\nharm the plaintiff must demonstrate potential harm [that] cannot be redressed by a legal or an\nequitable remedy following a trial.”  Forchion v. Intensive Supervised Parole, 240 F. Supp. 2d\n302, 310 (D.N.J. 2003). \n16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 17 of 20(cid:10)\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs’ allegations that Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun, and Mr Becka,\nwere assaulted due to the practice described above, along with their allegations that said practice\nstill occurs, establish a likelihood that Plaintiffs will be assaulted again if an injunction is not\nissued.  In addition, the allegation that Plaintiffs cannot, in some instances, receive medical care\nwithout risking physical injury, shows that Plaintiffs will, effectively, be denied medical care if\nan injunction is not issued.\nIn Monmouth County, the court granted the plaintiff-inmates’ application for a\npreliminary injunction against prison officials where the officials enforced a policy of requiring a\ncourt ordered release and refusing to provide funding (in violation of a statute) for abortions.  643\nF. Supp. at 1229.  In finding that the defendants’ policy substantially delayed the plaintiffs’\naccess to the procedure, the court stated the following:\nIt is well-accepted that a substantial delay in the decision to abort increases\nthe risks associated with the procedure . . . .  “The enhanced risks of an abortion\ndelayed to the second trimester are of such nature and magnitude that, even\nthough abortion remains lawfully available, the parent is effectively ‘denied a\nmeaningful opportunity’ to decide whether the fetus should be aborted.”\nId. at 1228.  The court found that the plaintiffs had “adequately established the requisite\nirreparable injury.”  Id.  \nThat case is similar to the present case in that Plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs in Monmouth\nCounty, are “effectively denied” access to medical care because of the risk involved in receiving\nsuch care.  Thus, Plaintiffs are not, as Defendants claim, refusing to receive medical care. \nRather, medical care has been effectively denied because of the risk involved.\nHowever, Defendants cite Board of Education v. New Jersey Education Ass’n., 96 N.J.\nSuper. 371, 390-91 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1967) for the proposition that “[h]arm is not irreparable\n17\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 18 of 20(cid:10)\nunless it results in a material injury for which monetary damages are inadequate.”  (Def’s’ Br.\n17).  But the discussion in that case does not relate to physical injury.  Courts have frequently\nfound that an injunction is the appropriate remedy where a plaintiff’s health or well-being is\nthreatened.  See e.g., Boone v. Brown, No. 05-750, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18131 (D.N.J. Aug.\n22, 2005); Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (U.S. 1978); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir.\n1974).  \nFinally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to prove irreparable harm “since four\nof [them] have never been so much as verbally harassed” and the others “have failed to show that\n. . . [injury] is ‘virtually certain.’” (Def’s’ Br. 17).  But in Helling, the Supreme Court stated:\nIt would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an\nunsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet\nhad happened to them . . . .  [Furthermore,] a remedy for unsafe conditions need\nnot await a tragic event.\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs have plainly established an unsafe condition that could be\nlife threatening in the event that one of them is brutally attacked, as was Mr. Cornwell, or\neffectively denied medical care for a serious illness or injury.  Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently\nestablished a likelihood of irreparable injury.\nHarm imposed on Defendants\nGenerally, an injunction should not be issued if it will harm the non-moving party more\nthan the moving party would be harmed if relief was denied.  Defendants state two specific\nharms that will result if Plaintiff’s motion is granted.  First, they say the injunction will\nundermine the DOC’s discretion to establish transportation procedures.  Such a harm seems\ninsignificant when compared to the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege.\nSecond, Defendants argue that granting the injunction will invalidate a state law, N.J.S.A.\n18\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 19 of 20(cid:10)\n2C:47-3(h), that allows the DOC to house certain sex offenders in the same facility as other\ninmates.  Presumably, an injunction that imposes upon the DOC an obligation to keep ADTC\ninmates separate from other state inmates could be read as imposing upon it an obligation to\nsegregate all sex offenders from other state inmates.  However, a properly tailored injunction\ncould provide Plaintiffs with adequate protection without imposing such an obligation on the\nDefendants.  Thus, Defendants’ alleged harms do not outweigh the harms allegedly imposed on\nPlaintiffs.\nPublic interest\nThere is no doubt that society has an interest in protecting all of its members, including\nthose incarcerated for sex-offenses, from cruel and unusual punishment.\nOther relief\nPlaintiffs seek to proceed as a class action and for the appointment of an attorney to\nrepresent the class.  A ruling on those applications will be deferred in the expectation that the\nprison authorities, in conformity with the preliminary injunction to be issued herewith, or as\nappropriately modified from time to time, will take all necessary actions to provide effective\nrelief.  Failing that, attorneys can be appointed to move for class designation and represent the\nclass as appropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is granted. \nDefendants, Devon Brown and William Plantier and all those operating under their direction and\ncontrol will be preliminarily enjoined, directed and ordered as follows:\n1. When inmates are removed from ADTC and held or transported with inmates from other\n19\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD-MCA     Document 11     Filed 03/29/2006     Page 20 of 20(cid:10)\ncorrectional institutions: i) they shall not be identified as inmates of Avenel; ii) inmates\nfrom other correctional institutions shall not be confined either in a vehicle or holding\narea so as to have physical access to the Avenel inmates unless a guard is present who is\nable to prevent the Avenel inmates from being subjected to violence from other inmates;\niii) guards and other prison officials shall be directed to halt forthwith any verbal or\nphysical assaults made by inmates upon Avenel inmates; iv) prison authorities shall\ninvestigate and promptly report upon any violence committed against any Avenel\ninmates;\n2. Defendants and Plaintiffs may apply to the Court for any modification of the\naccompanying order that may be necessary to accommodate prison administration or may\nbe necessary to effectuate its purpose of protecting Avenel inmates from physical and\nother abuse.\n3. A ruling on Plaintiffs’ applications for class designation and appointment of an attorney\nwill be deferred until it can be determined whether full relief can be affected through\nimplementation of the accompanying order.\n/s/ Dickinson R.

Gibbs, Peter Braun, ADULT DIAGNOSTIC & TREATMENT CENTER, Avenel, NJ,\nPro se Plaintiffs.\nZulima V. Farber, Attorney General of New Jersey, Victoria L. Kuhn, Deputy Attorney General,\nSusan M. Scott, Deputy Attorney General, R.J. Hughes Justice Complex, Trenton, New\nJersey, Potential Attorneys for State Defendants Devon Brown and William Plantier.\nOPINION\nDICKINSON DEBEVOISE, Senior District Judge\nPlaintiffs, George Riley, James J. Krivacska, Paul Cornwell, Vincent Macrina, William F.\nVansciver, Richard A. Gibbs, and Peter Braun, who are state inmates currently housed in the\nAdult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (\"ADTC\") in Avenel, New Jersey, filed a complaint\nagainst Defendants, Devon Brown, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections (\"DOC\"), William Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and various John\nDoes, employees of the DOC, claiming that Defendants denied them certain constitutional\nrights and unlawfully discriminated against them by failing to protect them from other state\ninmates during visits to other facilities for medical treatment and legal proceedings. The factual\nallegations of the complaint are supported by affidavits which have not been denied by counter\naffidavits.\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs' complaint lists the following counts: (1) violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment right to substantive and procedural due process; (2) violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment right of equal protection; (3) violation of the First Amendment right to seek redress\nand to have access to the courts; (4) violation the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination\n(\"NJLAD\") and the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (5) violation of the Eighth Amendment\nprotection against cruel and unusual punishment.\nPlaintiffs assert those claims on behalf of all inmates currently held at ADTC and wish to have\ntheir complaint certified as a class action. Plaintiffs now move for a temporary restraining order\nand/or preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendants from engaging in any further violations.\nPlaintiffs also move for appointment of pro bono counsel.\nI. BACKGROUND\nADTC is a facility operated by the DOC for the detention and treatment of inmates who have\nbeen convicted of sexual offenses and found to be compulsive and repetitive in their offending\nbehavior. Plaintiffs allege that prisoners such as themselves, who have been convicted of\nsexual offenses, are the most despised and reviled inmates in the prison system. As such,\n\nPlaintiffs allege that they are harassed and physically assaulted by other state inmates\nwhenever they are exposed to those inmates, such as when they are transported to and\ndetained in other facilities (e.g., when they seek medical care at another prison or attend a\nlegal proceeding). As Plaintiffs wish to represent a class of inmates they state that each\nmember of the class has suffered from the violations alleged in the complaint. In addition,\neach named Plaintiff alleges facts specific to his own experience.\nClaims of Plaintiff Paul Cornwell\nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was transported from ADTC to the New Jersey State Prison\n(\"NJSP\") on May 24, 2005 to receive physical therapy for a herniated disc. After receiving\nmedical treatment he was transported to the Garden State Correctional Facility and placed in a\nholding area with another ADTC inmate, Zhi-men Chen, and approximately twelve other state\nprisoners for a period of about three hours.\nMr. Cornwell alleges that when he and Mr. Chen were placed in the holding area, one of the two\ncorrections officers announced to the other prisoners that Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Chen were from\nAvenel, implying that they were sex offenders. The two officers then allegedly stood outside a\nPlexiglass window and observed the events that followed.\nAccording to Mr. Cornwell, the other inmates began asking him and Mr. Chen questions. They\nfirst asked Mr. Chen where he was from and Mr. Chen responded that he was from ADTC. To\nthat, another inmate said, \"I know that place; that's where all the rapists go.\" After several\nother questions another inmate allegedly asked Mr. Cornwell, \"what did you do, rape a little\ngirl?\" The inmate then allegedly stood up and began yelling, accusing Mr. Cornwell of raping a\nlittle girl. The inmate then allegedly sat down next to Mr. Cornwell and punched him in the\nchest. He then allegedly demanded the gold chain and cross that Mr. Cornwell was wearing.\nMr. Cornwell says that he replied, \"I'm not giving you my fucking chain.\"\nThe inmate then allegedly stood up and offered Mr. Cornwell an outstreched hand, saying \"I'm\nsorry.\" When Mr. Cornwell shook the inmate's hand, the inmate allegedly pulled Mr. Cornwell\nforward and punched him in the left temple, knocking him to the floor and knocking him\nunconscious.\nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was assaulted while he was unconscious and that when he awoke\nhe had a large abrasion on his right arm and that the officers, still standing on the other side of\nthe Plexiglass, had not responded. Mr. Cornwell alleges that Mr. Chen gave a statement in\nwhich he said that after Mr. Cornwell was knocked out, the assault continued for several\nminutes and that Mr. Cornwell was \"pummeled with fists and kicked with feet about his body\nwhile he was unconscious and defenseless\" and yet the officers did nothing to stop the\nassault. Mr. Cornwell was then allegedly taken to the infirmary and given a bag of ice for his\nhead.\nAfter returning to ADTC Mr. Cornwell allegedly reported the incident to Sergeant Collins and\nwas then examined by a nurse. Mr. Cornwell alleges that his injuries included head injuries\nleading to dizziness and loss of consciousness, severe swelling in his face, and injuries to his\nright arm that eventually required surgery. He says he was hospitalized for a total of 55 days\nand has a permanent scar on his right arm because of the assault. He further alleges that he\nsuffered severe psychological symptoms and that he was diagnosed as having post-traumatic\nstress disorder resulting from the assault.\nMr. Cornwell further alleges that since the attack he has declined medical treatment because\nhe is afraid of suffering another attack. He says he filed a grievance with the DOC regarding\nthe May 24th incident but that the DOC rejected it. He also says that he filed a Tort Claim\nNotice against the DOC but that it was denied. As such, he says the DOC has been\ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of future attacks.\nClaims of Plaintiff Peter Braun\nPlaintiff, Peter Braun, alleges that he was assaulted by a state inmate from another facility\nwhen he was returning from a court hearing at the Union County Courthouse on December 13,\n\n2005. Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that he was driven past the ADTC facility in Avenel to\nBordentown, in Mercer County, where he was transferred to a van in the parking lot of the\nGarden State Youth Correctional Facility. Mr. Braun further states that he was placed in the\nback seat of the van next to two state inmates from another facility, even though the front row\nof seats in the van's inmate compartment was empty.\nMr. Braun alleges that for the next hour and forty minutes, while the van drove to Northern\nState Prison in Newark, he was \"subjected to a barrage of harassment, intimidation, physical\nassault and psychological torture.\" (Compl. ¶ 142). Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that one of\nthe other prisoners grabbed him, shoved his fist at him, threatened to punch and shank him,\nand pulled on his collar and sleeves looking for jewelry and a watch. Mr. Braun alleges that the\ninmate told him that the \"`cops ain't going to help you, they set you up and told us to have fun\nwith you.'\" (Compl. ¶ 144). In addition, the other inmate allegedly told Mr. Braun that the DOC\nofficers told the inmates that he was from ADTC and was a convicted sex offender. Mr. Braun\nfurther states that the two other inmates then threatened to torture, kill and rape him. Finally,\nMr. Braun says the DOC officers could see and hear everything that occurred and that they\nwere laughing and making jokes about the threats and harassment.\nMr. Braun states that he requires frequent transport for both medical treatment and court\nhearings. He says the assault on December 13th left him severely distraught and afraid of\nmaking future trips in DOC custody.\nMr. Braun alleges that he filed an ARF on December 22, 2005, asking to be segregated on\nfuture trips. He says that he has not received any response to the ARF.\nClaims of Plaintiff George Riley\nPlaintiff, George Riley, alleges the following: He is Chairman of the ADTC Legal Subcommittee\nto the Inmate Resident Committee. In that capacity, and on his own behalf, he wrote to Grace\nRogers, ADTC Administrator, to request that procedures be put in place to protect ADTC\ninmates from other state prisoners when they are transported. Bernard Goodwin, Associate\nAdministrator, responded with a letter telling Mr. Riley that only the DOC Central Office, not\nADTC, had authority to change the procedures in question. Thus, Mr. Riley wrote to Defendant,\nWilliam Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and repeated his request. He has not\nreceived a response from Mr. Plantier.\nMr. Riley does not allege that he has ever been personally assaulted by other state inmates.\nHowever, he says he is aware of such assaults on ADTC inmates and fears that Defendants'\nfailure to prevent such attacks presents an imminent risk to his health and safety as he will\nneed the DOC to transport him for court appearances and medical treatment in the near future.\nClaims of Plaintiff James J. Krivacska\nPlaintiff, James J. Krivacska, like Mr. Riley, does not allege that he has ever been personally\nassaulted by other state inmates. On the contrary, Mr. Krivacska describes his May 31, 2005\nvisit to NJSP that transpired without incident. Presumably, his account serves as an example\nof how Plaintiffs wish to be transported as Mr. Krivacska describes being segregated from\nother inmates at all times and says that DOC officers protected him from other inmates and\ntook precautions to conceal his identity as an ADTC inmate.\nDespite that positive experience, Mr. Krivacska alleges that he is afraid of future trips, either\nfor medical care or court proceedings, because of what happened to Mr. Cornwell on May 24,\n2005. Mr. Krivacska alleges that he filed an Administrative Remedy Form (\"ARF\") expressing\nhis concern regarding the assault on Mr. Cornwell and indicating his fear of making future trips\nfor medical care and court proceedings.\nMr. Goodwin allegedly responded to the ARF with the same explanation he gave to Mr. Riley,\ni.e., that ADTC had no authority to change transport procedures. Mr. Krivacska alleges that he\nappealed Mr. Goodwin's decision to no avail.\nClaims of Plaintiff Vincent Macrina\n\nClaims of Plaintiff Vincent Macrina\nPlaintiff, Vincent Macrina, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on one\noccasion he was placed in a large holding cell with other state inmates while awaiting medical\ntreatment. As he alleges that he suffers from several serious medical conditions he says he\nneeds frequent medical attention but turns it down because he is afraid of being assaulted by\nother state inmates during the transport process.\nClaims of Plaintiff William F. Vansciver\nPlaintiff, William F. Vansciver, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on various\noccasions, when being transported for medical purposes, DOC officers identified him as an\nADTC inmate to other state inmates, thereby putting him at risk of assault. Mr. Vansciver\nalleges that he suffers from serious medical conditions and needs frequent medical attention.\nHowever, he states that he has declined medical attention because of the risk involved in\nseeking such attention.\nClaims of Plaintiff Richard Gibbs\nPlaintiff, Richard Gibbs, does not claim to have been assaulted but says he is aware of the\nattack on Mr. Cornwell and assault of Mr. Braun. Although he wishes to attend court hearings\nconnected with his post-conviction relief hearing, he says he is afraid to attend because of the\nrisk involved in being transported to the hearings.\nAssault of Todd Becka\nIn addition to the above allegations Plaintiffs describe an attack on a former ADTC inmate,\nTodd Becka that allegedly occurred on July 20, 2004. Mr. Becka, according to Plaintiffs'\nallegations, was threatened and attacked by an inmate from another facility while in transport\nto receive medical attention. The details of Plaintiffs' allegations are drawn from a complaint\nthat Mr. Becka filed with the ADTC administration. Plaintiffs state that Mr. Becka was punched\nin the head and subjected to repeated threats of violence and that the DOC officers who were\npresent at the time did nothing to protect him.\nPlaintiffs claim to know of other ADTC inmates who have suffered verbal and physical abuse\nfrom inmates of other facilities while on medical or court trips but do not describe any of those\nincidents.\nII. DISCUSSION\nStandard of Review for a Temporary Restraining\nOrder/Preliminary Injunction\nA preliminary injunction \"is `an extraordinary remedy, which should be granted only in limited\ncircumstances.'\" Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 290 F.3d 578, 586\n(3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 800 (3d\nCir. 1989)). \"[T]he movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\" Mazurek v.\nArmstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997). Moreover, \"[a] preliminary injunction cannot be issued\nwhen there are disputed issues of fact. Hunterdon Transformer Co. v. Cook, No. 89-3132, 1990\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 1382, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 1990).\nTo obtain an injunction, [a movant must] demonstrate (1) that [it is] reasonably\nlikely to prevail eventually in the litigation and (2) that [it is] likely to suffer\nirreparable injury without relief. If these two threshold showings are made the\nDistrict Court then considers, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an injunction\nwould harm [the non-movant] more than denying relief would harm the [movant]\nand (4) whether granting relief would serve the public interest.\nTenafly Eruv Ass'n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2002). Specifically,\nwith respect to the second part of the analysis, \"[t]o obtain injunctive relief, a party must make\n\nwith respect to the second part of the analysis, \"[t]o obtain injunctive relief, a party must make\na clear showing of `immediate irreparable injury' or a `presently existing actual threat.'\"\nMarsellis-Warner Corp. v. Rabens, 51 F. Supp. 2d 508, 528 (D.N.J. 1999) (quoting Acierno v.\nNew Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 655 (3d Cir. 1994)).\n1. Likelihood of success on the merits\nFor a moving party to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of ultimate success in the litigation\n\"it is not necessary that the moving party's right to a final decision after trial be wholly without\ndoubt; rather, the burden is on the party seeking relief to make a prima facie case showing a\nreasonable probability that it will prevail on the merits.\" Oburn v. Shapp, 521 F.2d 142, 148 (3d\nCir. 1975). Thus, for Plaintiffs to satisfy their burden they must establish a prima facie case for\nat least one of their claims.\nA. Eighth Amendment Protection Against Cruel and\nUnusual Punishment\nThe Eighth Amendment's ban on inflicting cruel and unusual punishments . . . `[proscribes]\nmore than physically barbarous punishments.' It prohibits penalties that are grossly\ndisproportionate to the offense, as well as those that transgress today's `broad and idealistic\nconcepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency.'\" Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S.\n678, 685 (U.S. 1978).\n\"It is undisputed that the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions under\nwhich he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.\" Helling v.\nMcKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (U.S. 1993). \"`When the State takes a person into its custody and\nholds him there against his will, the Constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to\nassume some responsibility for his safety and general well being . . . .'\" Id. at 32. As such, \"\n[t]he Eighth Amendment . . . requires that inmates be furnished with the basic human needs,\"\nincluding medical care and a reasonably safe environment. Id. at 33.\nThe Supreme Court has further stated that prison officials have an obligation to not only\nprotect inmates from immediate harms but to also protect them from \"condition[s] of\nconfinement that [are] sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering [in]\nthe next week or month or year.\" Id. at 33. With regard to claims of unsafe conditions, the\nCourt said that \"a prisoner need not wait until he is actually assaulted before obtaining relief.\"\nId. at 34 (citing Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 572 (10th Cir. 1980). Thus, \"the Eighth\nAmendment protects against sufficiently imminent dangers as well as current unnecessary and\nwanton infliction of pain and suffering . . . .\" Id.\nTo prove a cause of action against a prison official for the deprivation of basic necessities a\nprisoner must satisfy a two prong test. First, the prisoner must show that the alleged\ndeprivation is, \"objectively, `sufficiently serious'[and that the] prison official's act or omission .\n.. result[ed] in the denial of `the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities[.]' For a claim .\n.. based on a failure to prevent harm, the inmate must show that he is incarcerated under\nconditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\n(1994).\nSecond, the prisoner must show that the prison official acted with \"a `sufficiently culpable\nstate of mind.' In prison-conditions cases that state of mind is one of `deliberate indifference' to\ninmate health or safety . . . .\" Id. Deliberate indifference exists where a prison \"official knows\nof and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety . . . .\" Id. at 837. Furthermore,\n\"the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a\nsubstantial risk of serious harm exists, and . . . must also draw the inference.\" Id. However, a\nprisoner \"need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that harm actually\nwould befall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge\nof a substantial risk of serious harm.\" Id. at 842.\nIn claims against prison supervisors, the above standard is modified, requiring an inmate to\nprove, in addition to the above elements, that his injury was caused by a supervisor's failure to\nestablish or enforce appropriate policies or practices.\n\nSupervisor-centered claims against prison officials are analyzed under the four-\nprong test set forth in Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099 (3d Cir. 1989). Under the\nSample test, to hold a supervisor liable because his policies or practices led to\nan Eighth Amendment violation, the plaintiff must identify a specific policy or\npractice that the supervisor failed to employ and show that: (1) the existing\npolicy or practice created an unreasonable risk of the Eighth Amendment injury;\n(2) the supervisor was aware that the unreasonable risk was created; (3) the\nsupervisor was indifferent to that risk; and (4) the injury resulted from the policy\nor practice.\nLiles v. Camden County Dep't of Corr., 225 F. Supp. 2d 450, 463 (D.N.J. 2002). Prison\nsupervisors may not be held responsible under a respondeat superior theory of liability.\nDempsky v. Walker, No. 05-4483, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22983, at *12 (D.N.J. Sept. 29,\n2005).\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs claim they suffered injuries and are likely to suffer further injuries\ndue to Defendants' failure to protect them from other state inmates. Plaintiffs allege that\nDefendants' practice of identifying them as sex offenders and refusing to separate them from\nother state inmates when they place them in vehicles and holding cells with such inmates\ncreates an unreasonable risk that they will be assaulted by those inmates. Moreover, Plaintiffs\nallege that the risk of assault has prevented them from seeking necessary medical care.\nWith regard to the first element in the above test, Plaintiffs can show that Defendants' practice\ncreated an unreasonable risk by presenting \"evidence that such harm has in fact occurred on\nnumerous occasions.\" Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1118 (3d Cir. 1989). In Liles, 225 F.\nSupp. at 462, two inmates brought a cruel and unusual punishment claim against DOC\nsupervisors and employees alleging that the defendants' policy of having some inmates sleep\non mattresses on the floor of their cells, near the toilet, such that they were splashed with\nurine when other inmates used the toilet, led to several fights breaking out between inmates.\nPlaintiffs alleged that the condition led to one of the plaintiffs having a fight with another inmate\non one occasion and the other plaintiff having fights on at least two occasions. Id. The court\nsaid that those \"incidents establish[ed] a pattern of violence\" and that such allegations raised\na question of fact, sufficient to survive summary judgment, as to whether the condition\n\"constituted a threat to the health and safety of [the plaintiffs] that violated the Eighth\nAmendment.\" Id.\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs allege that prison officials engage in a practice of identifying\nthem as sex offenders, placing them in close proximity to other state inmates, and failing to\nprotect them from assaults by those inmates. As evidence of that practice, Plaintiffs offer\ndetailed accounts of three separate violent attacks: one on Plaintiff Cornwell, one on Plaintiff\nBraun, and one on former inmate Becka. Moreover, due to those assaults, Plaintiffs allege that\nthey are afraid to seek medical care because they cannot do so without risking physical injury.\nSuch conditions \"transgress today's `broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized\nstandards, humanity, and decency.'\" Hutto, 437 U.S. at 685. No member of society should be\nsubjected to violent attack nor should anyone have to risk such an attack to receive medical\ncare. Thus, Plaintiffs have established a pattern of violence that constitutes an unreasonable\nrisk to their Eighth Amendment rights. They have therefore satisfied their burden under the first\nelement of the above test.\nWith regard to the second element, Plaintiffs say they notified various prison officials of the\nunsafe condition. Specifically:\n• Mr. Riley allegedly wrote a letter to Ms. Rogers asking for better protection during\ntransportation. Mr. Goodwin allegedly responded to that letter stating that ADTC administrators\ncould not do anything to alter current procedures and that only the DOC Central Office had\nauthority over such matters. Thus, Mr. Riley says he wrote to Mr. Plantier, Director of\nOperations for the DOC, requesting greater protection. Mr. Riley says he has received no\nresponse to that letter.\n• Mr. Cornwell allegedly filed a grievance with the DOC and a Tort Claim Notice against the\nDOC regarding his alleged assault but says both were denied. In addition, Mr. Cornwell says\nhe reported the incident to Sergeant Collins and was hospitalized for fifty five days.\n\n• Mr. Krivacska allegedly filed an ARF expressing his concern over the assault on Mr. Cornwell\nbut says that Mr. Goodwin responded with the same explanation he gave to Mr. Riley.\n• Mr. Braun allegedly filed an ARF asking to be segregated on medical trips but says he has\nnot received any response.\n• Mr. Becka allegedly filed a complaint with the ADTC administration regarding the assault he\nsuffered.\nOf the above notifications, Mr. Riley's letter to Mr. Plantier is the only evidence that could\nprove that either of the named Defendants had actual knowledge of the alleged dangerous\ncondition but there is no proof that Mr. Plantier actually read the letter. However, Mr. Goodwin's\nresponses to both Mr. Riley and Mr. Krivacska show that Mr. Goodwin had actual knowledge\nof the condition. Although Mr. Goodwin is not named as a defendant, Plaintiffs' complaint\nalleges claims against John Does, DOC employees. Thus, Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient\nto satisfy Plaintiffs' burden of showing that a defendant supervisor was aware of the\nunreasonable risk created under the existing transport procedures.\nIn addition, Plaintiffs' other letters, complaints, Administrative Remedy Forms and allegation\nthat Mr. Cornwell spent fifty five days in the hospital, which suggests that prison officials must\nhave known of his assault, tend to show that other prison officials were also aware of the\nunsafe condition. As stated in Liles, \"[a] defendant's knowledge of a risk can be proved\nindirectly by circumstantial evidence . . . .\" Id. at 463. Plaintiffs' allegations show that other\nprison officials, in addition to Mr. Goodwin, likely knew of the unsafe condition as well.\nAs to the third element, Plaintiffs claim that prison supervisors have acted with deliberate\nindifference in that they have failed to correct the unsafe condition. Mr. Goodwin allegedly\nstated that ADTC has no authority to change the procedures by which prisoners are\ntransported. However, that explanation does not relieve Mr. Goodwin of his duty to protect\nADTC inmates when he knows they are being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. As\nstated above, prison officials have an affirmative duty to protect inmates from immediate\nthreats as well as conditions that are likely to cause harm in the future. Mr. Goodwin's\nknowledge of the unsafe condition and his failure to correct it, or even attempt to correct it,\nshow that he knew of, and disregarded an excessive risk to inmate health and safety. Thus,\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden for the third element.\nRegarding the fourth element, Plaintiffs' past injuries and the likelihood of future injuries arise\nfrom prison officials' current practice of telling other state inmates that Plaintiffs are sex\noffenders when they put Plaintiffs in vehicles and holding cells with those inmates. Thus,\nPlaintiffs have satisfied their burden as to this element as well.\nAs Plaintiffs have satisfied their burden under all four of the above elements, they have\nsucceeded in establishing a prima facie case showing a reasonable probability that they will\nprevail on the merits with regard to their claim of cruel and unusual punishment against Mr.\nGoodwin. As it seems likely that other prison officials were also aware of, and disregarded, the\nunsafe condition, it is probable that Plaintiffs will prevail in their claims against other officials\nas well.\nIn addition to their Eighth Amendment claim, Plaintiffs' complaint lists four other causes of\naction. The merits of those claims need not be analyzed at the present time as Plaintiffs have\nshown a likelihood of success on a claim that will entitle them to the requested relief if they\nsucceed in establishing the remaining elements in the preliminary injunction analysis.\nLikelihood of suffering irreparable injury\n\"The Third Circuit has interpreted `irreparable harm' to mean `that which cannot be repaired,\nretrieved, put down again [or] atoned for.'\" Monmouth County Correctional Institution Inmates\nv. Lanzaro, 643 F. Supp. 1217, 1228 (D.N.J. 1986). \"In order to demonstrate irreparable harm\nthe plaintiff must demonstrate potential harm [that] cannot be redressed by a legal or an\nequitable remedy following a trial.\" Forchion v. Intensive Supervised Parole, 240 F. Supp. 2d\n302, 310 (D.N.J. 2003).\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs' allegations that Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun, and Mr Becka, were\n\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs' allegations that Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun, and Mr Becka, were\nassaulted due to the practice described above, along with their allegations that said practice\nstill occurs, establish a likelihood that Plaintiffs will be assaulted again if an injunction is not\nissued. In addition, the allegation that Plaintiffs cannot, in some instances, receive medical\ncare without risking physical injury, shows that Plaintiffs will, effectively, be denied medical\ncare if an injunction is not issued.\nIn Monmouth County, the court granted the plaintiff-inmates' application for a preliminary\ninjunction against prison officials where the officials enforced a policy of requiring a court\nordered release and refusing to provide funding (in violation of a statute) for abortions. 643 F.\nSupp. at 1229. In finding that the defendants' policy substantially delayed the plaintiffs' access\nto the procedure, the court stated the following:\nIt is well-accepted that a substantial delay in the decision to abort increases the\nrisks associated with the procedure . . . . \"The enhanced risks of an abortion\ndelayed to the second trimester are of such nature and magnitude that, even\nthough abortion remains lawfully available, the parent is effectively `denied a\nmeaningful opportunity' to decide whether the fetus should be aborted.\"\nId. at 1228. The court found that the plaintiffs had \"adequately established the requisite\nirreparable injury.\" Id.\nThat case is similar to the present case in that Plaintiffs, like the plaintiffs in Monmouth\nCounty, are \"effectively denied\" access to medical care because of the risk involved in\nreceiving such care. Thus, Plaintiffs are not, as Defendants claim, refusing to receive medical\ncare. Rather, medical care has been effectively denied because of the risk involved.\nHowever, Defendants cite Board of Education v. New Jersey Education Ass'n., 96 N.J. Super.\n371, 390-91 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1967) for the proposition that \"[h]arm is not irreparable unless it\nresults in a material injury for which monetary damages are inadequate.\" (Def's' Br. 17). But the\ndiscussion in that case does not relate to physical injury. Courts have frequently found that an\ninjunction is the appropriate remedy where a plaintiff's health or well-being is threatened. See\ne.g., Boone v. Brown, No. 05-750, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18131 (D.N.J. Aug. 22, 2005); Hutto\nv. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (U.S. 1978); Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974).\nFinally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to prove irreparable harm \"since four of\n[them] have never been so much as verbally harassed\" and the others \"have failed to show\nthat. . . [injury] is `virtually certain.'\" (Def's' Br. 17). But in Helling, the Supreme Court stated:\nIt would be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly proved an unsafe,\nlife-threatening condition in their prison on the ground that nothing yet had\nhappened to them . . . . [Furthermore,] a remedy for unsafe conditions need not\nawait a tragic event.\nIn the present case, Plaintiffs have plainly established an unsafe condition that could be life\nthreatening in the event that one of them is brutally attacked, as was Mr. Cornwell, or\neffectively denied medical care for a serious illness or injury. Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently\nestablished a likelihood of irreparable injury.\nHarm imposed on Defendants\nGenerally, an injunction should not be issued if it will harm the non-moving party more than the\nmoving party would be harmed if relief was denied. Defendants state two specific harms that\nwill result if Plaintiff's motion is granted. First, they say the injunction will undermine the DOC's\ndiscretion to establish transportation procedures. Such a harm seems insignificant when\ncompared to the constitutional violations that Plaintiffs allege.\nSecond, Defendants argue that granting the injunction will invalidate a state law, N.J.S.A.\n2C:47-3(h), that allows the DOC to house certain sex offenders in the same facility as other\ninmates. Presumably, an injunction that imposes upon the DOC an obligation to keep ADTC\ninmates separate from other state inmates could be read as imposing upon it an obligation to\nsegregate all sex offenders from other state inmates. However, a properly tailored injunction\ncould provide Plaintiffs with adequate protection without imposing such an obligation on the\n\ncould provide Plaintiffs with adequate protection without imposing such an obligation on the\nDefendants. Thus, Defendants' alleged harms do not outweigh the harms allegedly imposed on\nPlaintiffs.\nPublic interest\nThere is no doubt that society has an interest in protecting all of its members, including those\nincarcerated for sex-offenses, from cruel and unusual punishment.\nOther relief\nPlaintiffs seek to proceed as a class action and for the appointment of an attorney to represent\nthe class. A ruling on those applications will be deferred in the expectation that the prison\nauthorities, in conformity with the preliminary injunction to be issued herewith, or as\nappropriately modified from time to time, will take all necessary actions to provide effective\nrelief. Failing that, attorneys can be appointed to move for class designation and represent the\nclass as appropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\nDefendants, Devon Brown and William Plantier and all those operating under their direction and\ncontrol will be preliminarily enjoined, directed and ordered as follows:\n1. When inmates are removed from ADTC and held or transported with inmates from other\ncorrectional institutions: i) they shall not be identified as inmates of Avenel; ii) inmates from\nother correctional institutions shall not be confined either in a vehicle or holding area so as to\nhave physical access to the Avenel inmates unless a guard is present who is able to prevent\nthe Avenel inmates from being subjected to violence from other inmates; iii) guards and other\nprison officials shall be directed to halt forthwith any verbal or physical assaults made by\ninmates upon Avenel inmates; iv) prison authorities shall investigate and promptly report upon\nany violence committed against any Avenel inmates;\n2. Defendants and Plaintiffs may apply to the Court for any modification of the accompanying\norder that may be necessary to accommodate prison administration or may be necessary to\neffectuate its purpose of protecting Avenel inmates from physical and other abuse.\n3. A ruling on Plaintiffs' applications for class designation and appointment of an attorney will\nbe deferred until it can be determined whether full relief can be affected through implementation\nof the accompanying order.\n -   - ",

Defendants \nBROWN,  PLANTIER,  and  JOHN  and  JANE  DOEs'who  were  or  are  employed \nby  the  DOC,  were  acting,  and  continue  to  act,  under  color  of  state \nlaw. \nIV.  CLASS  ACTION  ALLEGATIONS \n13.  The  class  represented  by  the  named  plaintiffs  in this \naction,  and  of which  named  plaintiffs  are  themselves  members, \nconsists  of  the  class  of  persons  who  have  been  convicted  of  sexual \noffenses  as  delineated  in N.J.  Stat.  Ann.  Title  2G  and  who  are \ncurrently  confined  at  the  A.D.T.G.  administered  by  the  New  Jersey \nDOC,  and  who  are,  have  been,  or  will  be  required  to,  or  need  to, \nbe  transported  out  of  the  A.D.T.C.  by  the  Central  Transport  Unit \nof  the  DOC  for  medical,  court  or  other  trips. \n14.  The  number  of members  of  the  class,  as  hereinabove \nidentified  and  described,  is  approximately  650  members,  or  the \ncurrent  inmate  count  at  the  A.D.T.C ..  The  class  is  so  numerous \nthat  the  joinder  of  individual  members  herein  is  impracticable. \n15.  There  are  common  questions  of  law  and  fact  in  the  action \nthat  relate  to  and  affect  the  rights  of  each member  of  the  class \nand  the  relief  sought  is  common  to  the  entire  class,  namely: \n(a)  whether  the  commissions  and  omissions  of  the  defe'ndants, \nwhereby  defendants  knowingl,)disregarded  an  excessive \nrisk to  the  health  and  of A.D.T.C.  inmates  when \nsafe~y \n1: \nII \n\nI \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 6 of 50 PageID: 134\n' \n6  iley,  et  al v.

Erown.  et  al \nCivil  Class  Action  laint \n16.  The  claims  of  the  named  Plaintiffs.  who  are \nrepresentative  of  the  class  herein,  are  typical  of  the  claims  of \nthe  class,  in  that  the  claims  of  all members  of  the  class, \nincluding  Plaintiffs,  depend  on  a  showing  of  the  commissions  and \nomissions  of  defendants  giving  rise  to  the  right  of  plaintiffs  to \nthe  relief  sought  herein.  There  is  no  conflict  as  between  any \nindividual  named  Plaintiff and  other  members  of  the  class with \nrespect  to  this  action,  nor  with  respect  to  the  claims  for  relief \nherein  set  forth. \n17.  The  named  plaintiffs  are  the  representative  parties  for \nthe  class,  and  11re  able  to,  !'nd  will,  fairly  and  adequately \nprotect  the  interests  of  the  class . \n. \n18.  This  action  is  properly maintained  as  a  class  action  in \nthat the  prosecution  of  separate  actions  by  individual  members  of \nthe  class  would  create  a  risk of  varying  adjudications  with \nrespect  to  individual members  of  the  class which  would  establish \nincompatible  standards  of  conduct  for  the  defendants  herein. \n19.  Moreover  this  action  is  properly maintained  as  a  class \naction  inasmuch  as  the  defendants  herein,  all  of whom  oppose  the \nclass,  have  acted  or  refused  to  act,  as  hereinafter  more \nspecifically  stated,  on  grounds  which  are  appl  able  to  the  class. \nand  have  by  reason  of  such  conduct,  made  appropriate  final \ninjunctive  relief  corresponding  declaratory  relief with  respect \no~ \nto  the  entire  class,  as  sought  in  this  action. \n\n'I \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 9 of 50 PageID: 137\naf \nRiley.  et  al v.  Brown,  et  9 \nCivil  Class  Action  Complaint \n·. . , ., '' \n20.  Finally,  this  action  is  ~r Jerly maintained  as  a  class \naction  inasmuch  as  the  questions  of  aI'  ,l,' and  fact  common  to  the \nmembers  of  the  class  predominate  ovet  Jhy  questions  affecting  only \nindividual  members,  and  a  class  action  :is  superior  to  other \navailable methods  for  the  fair  and  efficient  adjudication  of  the \ncontroversy. \nV.  GENERAL  FACTS \n21.  Each  of  the  named  plaintiffs and  members  of  the  class \ni;'  \nwere  convicted  of  a  sexual  offense  as  enumerated  under  N.  J.  Stat. \nAnn.  §  Title  2  and  either  sentenced  to the  A.D.T.C.  under  N.J. \nStat.  Ann.  §  2C:47-3  or  otherwise  sent~nced to  State  Prison.  but \ntransferred  to  the  A.D.T.C.  by  the  Commissioner  to  serve  their \nsentence. \n22.  The  A.D.T.C.  houses  only  iinlmates  who  have  been  convicted \nI \nof  a  sexual  offense. \n23.  As  used  in  this  complaint.,  \"State  prisoners\"  will  refer \nto  prisoners  committed  to  the  custody  of  NJ  DOC  who  are  not  housed \nat  the  A.D.T.C.,  while  \"A.D.T.C.  inmates\"  will  refet:  to  those  who \nare  housed  at  the  A.D.T.C. \n24.  Two  of  the  named  Plaintif  s,  George  Riley,  and  James  J. \nKrivacska,  are members  of  the  Legal  Subcommittee  of  the  A.D.T.C. \nInmate  Resident  Committee;  Mr.  Rile  ilr  currently  Chairman  of  that \nsubcommittee. \n\nli l  . \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 10 of 50 PageID: 138\n10  iley,  et  al v,  Brown,  et  al \nCivil  Class  Action  laint \n25.  The  Inmate  Resident  Cc\\mmi tt ~!consists of  inmates \n!  I \nelected by  the  residents  of  each  hous'rt unit  and  meets  weekly  to \n'  ' \ndiscuss  issues  of  concern  to  the  A.D.T.C.  population  and  then \nmeets  monthly  with  Administration  to  review  those  concerns  with \nadministration  and  to  receive  information  of  interest  and \nimportance  to  the  population  from  the  Administration. \n26,  Complaints  about  the  risk of  physical  injury  and \nrecurring  psychological  abuse  visited upon  A.D.T.C.  inmates  by \nstate  prisoners  during  trips  away  from  the  facility  are  long· \nstanding,  dating  back  at  least  to  19f~· \n27.  In  1989,  the  Inmate  Resideht  Committee,  as  reported  in \nthe  inmate  newsletter,  the  Podium,  dat<l!d  July/Aug.  198~.  brought \nto  the  administration's  attention  at  a  meeting  on  June  27,  1989, \nconcerns  about  threats  and  harassment  suffered by  A.D.T.C.  inmates \nat  the  hands  of  prisoners  and  officers  from  other  institutions \nwhile  on  medical  trips,  complaints  which  brought  no  corrective \naction  by  defendants. \nZ8.  In  1989,  William  Plantier was  an  administrator  at  the \nA.D.T.C. \nZ9.  On  information  and  belief,  state  inmates  who  have  been \nconvicted  of  sexual  offenses  are  the  most  despised  and  reviled \ninmates  in the  prison  system,  and  such  inmates  housed  in  general \npopulation,  hide  the  nature  of  their  crimes  to  avoid  harassment \nand  assault  by  non·se:x:  offending  inmates. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 11 of 50 PageID: 139\nRiley,  et  al v.

Mr.  George  Riley.  on  his  own  behalf,  and  as  Chairman  of \nthe  IRC  Legal  Subcommittee,  wrote  to Mrs.  Grace  Rogers,  A.D.T.C. \nAdministrator.  and  requested  that  proce,dures  be  put  into  place  to \nsecure  the  safe  transport  of A.D.T.C.  inmates  on  medical  and  court \ntrips  in  light of  the  history  of  assaults,  threats  and  acts  of \nintimidation  made  against A.D.T.C.  inmates  by  state  prisoners. \n32.  On  July  6,  2005,  Mr.  Bernard  Goodwin,  Associate \nAdministrator  responded,  noting  that  A.D.T.C.  did  not  have \nauthority to  change  methods  of  inmate  transport.  such  authority \nresiding with  the  N.J.

Mr.  Riley  wrote  to Mr.  Plantier,  DOG  Director  of \nne~t \nOperations  repeating  these  concerns;  no  answer  has  been  received. \n34.  Mr.  Riley  currently has  an  appeal  of  a  Post-Conviction \nRelief  petition pending  before  Superior  Court-Appellate  Division \nwhich,  if remanded  to  the  trial  court.  will  require  his  appearance \nin  court  in  the  near  future. \n35.  Mr.  Riley  is  72  years  old,  and  is thus  concerned  about \nthe  probability  of  suffering  a  medic•l  ailment  in  the  near  future \nI \nthat  may  require  a  medical  trip out  of  the  building.  He  is \nconcerned  that he  may  have  to  forego  needed  medical  treatment  if \nno  provisions  for  the  safe  transport  of  A.D.T.C.  inmates  is made, \nso  as  to  avoid  risk  of  even  more  ser  ous  injury  or  harm. \n36.  Mr.  Riley  has  been  an  inma  e  at  the  A.D.T.C.  for  19 \nyears  and  has  personal  knowledge  tha  the  issue  of  the  safety of \nA.D.T.C.  inmates  on  medical  and  cour  trips  has  periodically  been \nraised by  A.D.T.C.  inmates- usually/ after  a  particularly \negregious  and  damaging  assault - but that  DOC  has  repeatedly \n' \nignored  these  concerns  and  continues  to  place  A.D.T.C.  residents \nat  risk  for  serious  bodily  harm  or  death  by  continuing  to \ntransport  and  hold  A.D.T.C.  inmates  in  unsafe  conditions  with \ndangerous  and  violent  state  prisonere. \n37.

KRIVACSKA \n40.  On  May  31,  2005.  Mr.  Krivacska  was  transported  to  the \nNew  Jersey  State  (NJSP)  to  have  a  tooth  removed. \nPriso~ \n41.  He  was  transported with  three  other  inmates  from  the \nA.D.T.C.,  as  well  as  approximately  10  other  inmates  from  other \nstate prisons  and  a  half-way  house. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 14 of 50 PageID: 142\nRiley,  et  al  v.

However.  on  the  transport  vehicle,  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates \nwere  separated,  front  and  back,  by  a  row  of  empty  seats,  thus \nmaking  it impossible  for  inmates  from  other  facilities  to  have  any \nphysical  contact with  them. \n43.  During  the  trip,  one  of  the  state  prisoners  made  a \nderogatory  comment  about  pedophiles  but  the  officer  on  the vehicle \nenforced  the  rule  that  inmates  could  not  get  up  out  of their  seat \nfor  any  reason,  and  no  further  incident  during  the  trip  occurred. \n44.  Upon  arrival  at  the  NJSP,  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates  were  kept \nin  separate  holding  areas  at  all times  from  inmates  from  other \nstate  prisons  (with  the  exception  o  one  occasion when  the half-\nway  house  and  A.D.T.C.  inmates  were  kept  in  a  holding  area \n. \ntogether  for  approximately  15  minut  s  - half-way  house  inmates \npose  little  risk  of  harm  to  A.D.T.C.  inmates  because  they  fear \nlosing  their  half-way  house  status  if they  break  any  rules). \n45.  Throughout  the  time  spent  at  the  NJSP,  from \napproximately  9:00  AM  to  2:00  FM.  Mr.  Krivacska  and  the  other \nA.D.T.C.  inmates  were  kept  segregated  from  other  state  prisoners, \nexcept  for  a  brief period  while  waiting  in  the  infirmary to  be \nseen by  the  dentist.  However.  during  this  period,  there was  no  way \nfor  the  other  state  prisoners  in the  room  to know  where  Mr. \nKrivacska  and  the  other  A.D.T.C.  inmates  were  from  (none  of  them \nhaving  been  on  the  vehicle).

While  at  NJSP  any  time  inmates  from  different  facil  s \nwere  brought  together  to  be  divided  up  either  for  holding  purposes \nor  to  load  a  vehicle,  the  central  transport  officer  in  charge \ncontinuously  shuffled  the  paperwork  f  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates  to  the \nbottom  of  the  pile  so  that  as  he  cal  ed  out  inmates  from  other \nfacilities,  he  did  not  have  to  discl  which  facility  Mr. \n~e \n•  I \nKrivacska  and  the  other  A.D.T.C.  inm  tes  were  from  with  other \ninmates  around.

A.D.T.C.  inmates  were  again  by  an  empty  row \n;;~eparated \nfrom  inmates  from  other  facilities  on  the  bus  trip  back.  Mr. \nKrivacska  and  the  other  A.D.T.C.  inmates  were  transported  directly \nback  to  the  A.D.T.C.  from  the  NJSP,  with  no  stops  at  any  other \nfacility.  Nor  were  they  held  at  any  other  facility  other  than \nNJSP. \n49.  On  June  4.  2005,  Mr.  Krivacska  filed  an  Administrative \nRemedy  Form  (ARF)  which  was  assigned'  the  case  number  05-06 · 0006. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 16 of 50 PageID: 144\n16  Riley,  et  al  v.

In that ARF  he  described  h~s concern  over  the  assault  of \nMr.  Cornwell  on  a  trip  to  NJSP  several  days  before  his  own  (herein \ndetailed  at  7 3) . \n52.  Mr.  Krivacska.indicated  that he  required  a  second  trip \nto  NJSP  for  the  removal  of  a  second  molar,  a  broken  tooth  that \nleft sharp,  protruding  edges  in  his  mouth,  which  frequently  caused \ncuts  to  his  tongue  and  inner  check;  the  dental  consult  authorizing \nthe  extraction procedure  having  been  issued  on  March  28,  2005. \n53.  Mr.  Krivacska  indicated  that  he  was  fearful  of  being \nassaulted  or  even  killed  if he  was  not  kept  segregated  from \nviolent  and  dangerous  state  prisoners,  as  had  occurred  with  Mr. \nCornwell,  if he  went  to  NJSP  to  have.the  tooth  pulled. \n54.  Mr.  Krivacska  also  indicated  that  he  had  a  pending \nSuperior  Court  case  which  would  require  his  transport  to  Monmouth \nCounty  court  sometime  in the  future. \n55.  Mr.  Krivacska  requested  that  A.D.T.C.  inmates  be \nsegregated  from  state  prisoners  during medical  and  court  trips  so \nas  to  ensure  their  safety,  as  had  occurred  on  his  May  31,  2005 \ntrip. \n56.  Mr.  Krivacska  indicated  that  he  was  afraid  to  go  to  NJSP \nto  have  his  tooth  pulled  because  of the  history  of  assaults  on \nA.D.T.C.  inmates  on  such  trips when  they  ate  not  segregated. \n\nI 1\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 17 of 50 PageID: 145\n/ \nRiley,  et  al v.

Mr.  Bernard  Goodwin,  Associ  te Administrator  of  the \nby \nA.D.T.C.,  responded  on  June  14,  2005,  informing  Mr.  Krivacska \nthat  transportation  arrangements  were  under  the  authority  of  the \nCentral Transport  Unit  of  DOC  and  that A.D.T.C.  had  no  authority \nto  change  the  method  of  transport,  and  that  it was  Mr.  Krivacska's \ndecision whether  or  not  to  continue  his  dental  treatments. \n58.  Mr.  Krivacska  appealed  that  decision  on  June  23,  2005, \nindicating  that  he  did wish  to  continue  his  dental  treatments,  but \nnot  at  risk of  bodily  injury  or  worse.  He  also  identified the  fact \nthat  there  had  been  a  clear  pattern  of  abuse  of A.D.T.C.  inmates \nby  state prisoners  over  the  years.  He  also  noted  in his  appeal \nthat  if A.D.T.C.  did  not  have  the  authority to  change  the  policy \non  the  transport  of  A.D.T.C.  inmates,  that  he  would  like his  ARF \nforwarded  to  an  administrator  in the. DOC  who  had  the  authority  to \nreview  and  change  that  policy. \n59.  Mr.  Krivacska  pointed  out  in his  appeal  the  ready \navailability  of  holding  tanks  to  segregate  A.D.T.C.  inmates  in all \ncorrectional  facilities  and  other  measures  to  protected  A.D.T.C. \ninmates  such  as  those  used  on  his  May  31,  2005  trip  (hiding  the \nidentity  of  A.D.T.C.  inmates  whenever  possible,  ensuring  the \npresence  of  a  corrections  officer  any  time  A.D.T.C.  inmates  are \nmixed  with  state  prisoners,  etc). \n60.  Mr.  Krivacska  also  pointed  out  that  DOC  was  clearly \nawar·e  of  the  risk  posed  by  state  prisoners  not  sentenced  to  the \n\nII  I \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 18 of 50 PageID: 146\n18  Rile.y,  et  al  v.

Mr.  Goodwin,  on  July  18,  2005  resolved  the  appeal  of  his \nown  earlier  decision,  by  reasserting  that  A.D.T.C.  has  no \nauthority  over  how  Central  Transport  manages  the  transfer  of \ninmates.  Although  indicating  that  central  transport was  aware  of \nthe  concerns  of  A.D.T.C.  inmates,  Mr.  Itrivacska's  grievance  was \nnot  forwarded  to  Central  Transport  as  Mr.  Krivacska  had  requested. \n62.  The  ARF  is  the  sole means  of  filing  an  grievance  in  the \nNew  Jersey  Department  of  Corrections.  Mr.  Krivacska's  grievance  of \nJune  4,  2005,  and  his  June  23,  2005  appeal  of  the  decision  of  June \n14,  2005,  exhausted  his  appeals  in  this  administrative  agency. \n63.  Mr.  Krivacska  delayed  having  his  tooth  pulled,  despite \nconsiderable  discomfort.  until he  was  able  to  arrange  with  the \nombudsman  to  have  an  oral  surgeon who  periodically  came  to  the \nA.D.T.C.  to  perform  dental  work  on  half\"way  house  inmates,  to  make \nan  and  pull  his  tooth  at  the  A.D.T.C.  without  having  to \ne~ception \nbe  transported  to  the  NJSP.  That  tooth  extraction  occurred  on \nOctober  26,  2005,  some  months  after  a  dental  consult  had  first \nsi~ \ndetermined  that  the  tooth  had  to  be  removed. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 19 of 50 PageID: 147\nRiley,  et  al  v.

Mr.  Krivacska  is  currently  ~efendant in  a  civil  action \nin Essex  County  Superior  Court  (Dock~tJr· o.:  ESX-L  3229·05). \ninvolving  $100,000  in  contested  legal  , es  in which  his  former  law \nfirm  is  the  plaintiff. \n65.  Although  he  has  a  jury  tri!ll,  Mr.  Krivacska \n~:eque~Jted \nwill be  forced  to  default  on  his  defenses  costing  $100,000  in  a \njudgment  against  him  because  he  fears  being  transported  to  the \nEssex  County  facility  without  a  guarantee  of  segregation  from \nother  prisoners who  are  highly  likely to  harm  him. \n66.  The  DOC's  failure  to  provide  Mr.  Krivacska  with  safe \naccess  to  the  courts.  access  which  he  can  exercise without  fear  of \n'  ' \nbodily harm.  or  death,  deprives  him of his  right  of  access  to  the \ncourts. \n67.  Mr.  Krivacska  has  a  Post  Conviction  Relief petition \ncurrently  pending  before  Judge  Neafsby  of  the  Monmouth  County \nSuperior  Court,  which  petition will  eventually  require  his \nappearance  and  probable  testimony. \n68.  The  threat  of  verbal  assault,  physical harm  or  death \nleaves  Mr.  Krivacska  very  fearful  of his  safety  and  will  very \nlikely  interfere with his  ability to  prepare  for  this  PCR  hearing, \nassist his  counsel,  or  serve  as  a  witness  on  his  own  behalf. \n69.

On  May  24,  2005,  inmate  Paul  Cornwell  was  transported  to \nNJSP  for  a  medical  trip to  receive  physical  therapy  for  a \nherniated  disc  (L-4,  L-5). \n74.  At  the  conclusion  of his  medical  trip.  he  and  another \nA.D.T.C.  inmate,  Zhi-men  Chen.  were  transferred  to  the  Garden \nState  Correctional  Facility  and  placed  in a  holding  area  for  three \nhours  with  approximately  a  dozen  state prisoners. \n75.  When  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates  were .placed  into  the  holding \narea,  one  of  the  escorting  correction  officers  announced  to  the \nother  state  prisoners  that  Mr.  Cornwell  and  Mr.  Chen  were  from \n\"Avenel.\" \n. \n76.  The  only  DOC  facility  in  ''Avenel\"  is  the  A.D.T.C.:  the \nofficers had  thus  announced  that  these  two  inmates  were  convicted \nsex  offenders.  As  they  removed  the  wrist  restraints,  one  of  the \nofficers  asked  the  other  if they  should  remove  the  leg  restraints, \nto which  the  other  officer  replied,  \"No,  let's keep  it a  fair \nfight.\" \n77.  After  the  two  officers  left.  they  stood  outside  a \nPlexiglas window  and  observed  the  events  that  transpired next. \n78.  As  the  inmates  in  the  holding  area began  to  eat  their \nlunches.  one  of  the  inmates  asked  Inmate  Chen  where  he  was  from, \ndespite having  already  been  told  by  the  officer. \n79.  Inmate  Chen  responded  \"A.D.T.c.· \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 22 of 50 PageID: 150\n22  iley,  et  al  v.

Another  inmate  stated  \"I  kno  that  place:  that's  where \n,, \n1 \nall the  rapists  go.\"  He  then  asked  Chen\"  \"What  did  you  do?\" \n81.  Inmate  Chen  replied  he  had:  a  ,consensual  relationship \nwith  a  14-year-old  girl.  I \n82.  Another  inmate  asked  Mr.  Cornwell  \"Where  you  from?\" \n83.  Mr.  Cornwell  replied  that  he  was  right  next  to  Rahway. \nI \nThe  same  inmate  then  said.,  \"You're  w~tl:t  this  guy  [meaning  Chen] , \nyou  came  from  the  same  place.  Why  dir  you  say  you  were  from \nRahway?\" \nI \n84.  Mr.  Cornwell  answered,  \"I  didn't  say  I  was  from  Rahway, \nI  said  I  was  next  to  Rahway.\" \n85.  The  inmate  who  had  been  talking  to  Chen  then  came  over \nand  sat next  to  Mr.  Cornwell  and  asked,  \"What  did  you  do,  rape  a \nlittle girl?\"  to  which  Mr.  Cornwell  replied,  \"No,  I  did  not  rape  a \nlittle girl.\" \n86.  The  inmate  then  got  up  and  got  loud  and  arrogant  and \nstarted yelling,  \"He  raped  this  little girl,  he  fucked  her  in  the \nass.\"  And  Mr.  Cornwell  said.  \"No,  I  didn't  do  that.\" \n87.  The  inmate  then  sat  back  down  bes  Mr.  Cornwell  and \nreached  around  and  punched  him  in  the  chest.  Then  he  demanded  the \ngold  chain  and  cross  Mr.  Cornwell  was \n~earing. \n88.

Then  the  inmate  stood  up,  and  came  up  in front  of  Mr. \nCornwell  and  offered  an  left hand  looking  for  a  handshake \ne~tended \nand  said,  •r·m  sorry.• \n90.  After  taking  Mr.  Cornwell  hand,  the  inmate  pulled Mr. \nCornwell  towards  him  and  then  punched  Mr.  Cornwell  hard  on  the \nleft temple,  knocking  him  down  to  the  floor  and  knocking  him  out. \n91.  When  Mr.  Cornwell  came  to,  he·was  lying  on  the  floor, \nand  had  a  large  cut/abrasion  on  his  right  arm;  at  this  point. \nthough  the  assault had  ended,  the  officers  observing  from  behind \nthe  Plexiglas  window,  still had  not  called  for  a  Code. \n92.  According  to the  statement  given  by  Inmate  Chen,  the \nOfficers watched  the  assault  for  several  minutes  and  did  not  sound \n' \nthe  alarm.  call  a  Code,  request  assistance  or  make  any  attempt  to \nintervene,  until  the  assault  ended. \n93.  Based  on  the  statement  given  by  Inmate  Chen,  after Mr. \nCornwell  was  knocked  unconscious,  the  assault  continued with  Mr. \nCornwell  being  repeatedly  pummeled  with  fists  and  kicked with  feet \nabout  his  body  while  he  was  unconscious  and  defenseless. \n94.  Mr.  Cornwell  was  taken  to  the  infirmary where  he  was \ngiven  a  bag  of  ice  for  his  head  and  information  recorded  about \nwhere  he  was  hurt. \n95.  Mr.  Cornwell  returned  to  the  A.D.T.C.  later  that  evening \nwhere  he  gave  a  statement  about  the  incident  to  Sergeant  Collins, \nand  where  he  was  also  examined  by  the  nurse. \n\nII \nI \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 24 of 50 PageID: 152\nI \n24  Riley,  et  al  v.

Mr.  Cornwell  suffered  severe  physical  injuries  as  a \nresult  of  this  assault,  including  head  injuries  leading  to \ndizziness  and  loss  of  consciousness  in  the  days  after  the  assault, \nsevere  swelling  to  his  face,  severe  injuries  to  his  right  arm \nwhich  eventually  required  surgery,  and  other  medical  problems \ncontinuing  to  this  day. \n98.  These  medical  problems  resulted  in  Mr.  Cornwell  being \nhospitalized  for  a  total  of  55  days,  including  two  separate \nhospitalizations  at  St.  Francis,  each  for  about  a  week,  and  the \nremainder  of  the  time  spend  in the  hospital  at  the  A.D.T.C. \nfacility. \n99.  Mr.  Cornwell  has  a  permanent  scar  on  his  right  arm  as  a \nresult  of his  injuries. \n100.  Mr.  Cornwell  also  suffered  severe  psychological  symptoms \nafter  the  assault  including  night  terrors,  nightmares,  flashbacks, \na  hypersensitivity  to  his  environment,  fear  of  being  around  other \npeople,  fear  of  leaving  his  immediate  bed  area  in his  housing \nunit. \n101.

For  fear  of  another  attack,  Mr.  Cornwell  refused  several \nmedical  treatments  for  his  back  injury,  eventually  agreeing  to  a \ntrip,  during  which  he  was  continuously  subjected  to  verbal \nharassment  and  abuse  by  a  State  during  the  van  trip  to \npris~ner \nthe  New  Jersey  State  Prison. \n103.  In  light  of that  experience,  and  the  assault  of  May \n24th,  and  the  refusal  of the  Department  of  Corrections  to  ensure \nhis  safety,  and  the  fact  that his  grievances  filed  under  the  DOC \ngrievance  procedure were  rejected,  a  ~~~is Tort  Claim  Notice  filed \nagainst DOC  under  the  New  Jersey  Tort  dlaims  Notice  Act  was \ndenied,  Mr.  Cornwell  determined  that DOC  would  make  no  effort to \nminimize  the  risk  to  his  personal  healthy  and  safety  posed  by \nState  prisoners  on  medical  and  court  trips,  and  has  thus  since \ndeclined  to  be  transported  out  of A.D.T.C.  for  medical·purposes. \n104.

Mr.  Vansciver. was  not  found  to  be  compulsive  and \nrepetitive  under  N.J.S.A.  2C;47-3  and  was  consequently  not \nsentenced  to  the  A.D.T.C.;  rather,  before  his  transfer  to A.D.T.C. \nhe  was  housed  at  South  Woods  Correctional  Facility. \n112.  While  housed  in  state  prison,  the  nature  of  Mr. \nVansciver's  was  not  disclosed  by  actions  of  the  NJ  DOC \noffen~e \ntoward  him,  and  thus  nothing  in how  NJ  DOC  treated  him  during \nmedical  or  court  trips while  housed  at  South Woods  Correctional \nFacility  placed him  at  risk  for  having  the  nature  of  his  offense \ndisclosed  to  other  State  prisoners;  thus  keeping  him  safe  from \nassault  by .those  State  prisoners who  harbor  particular  enmity \ntoward  sexual  offenders. \n113.  Mr.  Vansciver  suffers  from  a  seizure  disorder,  both \ngrand  mal  and  petite mal,  for  which he  takes  several  different \nmedications  to  control. \n\n'I \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    FilI ed 01/27/06   Page 28 of 50 PageID: 156>  • \n28  Riley,  et  al  v.

Among  the  effects  of the  seizures  from  which  Mr. \nVansciver  suffers  are  memory  loss,  difficulty with  balance  while \nwalking,  difficulty  focusing  and  maintaining  attention,  and \nlanguage  deficits. \n116.  Mr.  Vansciver  also  suffers  from  numerous  injuries  to  his \nhands.  legs.  shoulders,  back,  and  other  parts  of  his  body, \ninjuries  incurred while  experiencing  a  seizure. \n117.  Mr.  Vansciver  requires  electro-encephalogram  evaluation \nand  neurological  consults  that  cannot  be  provided  at  the  A.D.T.C. \n118.  Because  of  the  severity  of these  a  blow  to  Mr. \nsei~ures, \nr'o \nVansciver's  head  is  especially  like}r  cause  harm,  including \npotentially  death. \n!  . \n119.

Since  being  transferred  to  the  A.D.T.C.  by  the  NJ  DOC,  a \nfacility  to  which  he  was  not  sentenced,  Defendants  and  their \nagents  now  cause  his  identity as  a  seJtual  offender  to  be  di.sclosed \neach  he  is  and  held with  state  prisoners  on  court \n~ime  ~ransported \nand  medical  trips  exposing  him  to  rHsk  of harm  that  was  not \npresent when  he  was  housed  at  other  state  prisons. \n\nI 'I \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 29 of 50 PageID: 157\nRiley,  et  al  v.

Prior  to  the  incident  involving Mr.  Cornwell,  Mr. \nVansciver  would  be  transported  to NJSP  for  neurological  consults \napproximately  three  to  four  times  a  year  and  to  St.  Francis \nMedical  Center  for  neurological  tests  approximately  twice  a  year. \n123.  Because  Central  Transport  Unit  refuses  to  ensure  the \nanonymity  of  A.D.T.C.  residents  on  medical  and  court  trips,  and \nrefuses  to  segregate A.D.T.C.  inmates  from  other  state  prisoners, \nMr.  Vansciver  is  highly  fearful  of  suffering  severe  physical  and \n' \npotentially  fatal  injuries  and  has  thus  declined  to  go  on  any  more \nmedical  trips.  irrespective  of medical  need.  where  DOC  will  not \nguarantee  his  safety. \n124.  Mr.  Vansciver  has  not  received  needed  medical  treatments \nbecause  of his  fear  of  being  transported  under  dangerous \nconditions,  resulting  in  an  exacerbation  of  his  seizure  disorder \nand  additional  neurological  damage, \n125.  Having  received  no  consultation,  monitoring  of \nmedication  or  treatment  in  approximately  six months,  on  October \n22,  2005,  Mr.  Vansciver  suffered  a  severe  seizure which  required, \nin  the  opinion  of  the  A.D.T.C.  medical  staff,  his  emergency \ntransport  via  ambulance  to  Rahway  General  Hosp:ital.  where  he  was \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 30 of 50 PageID: 158\n30  Riley,  et  al v.

On  December  13,  2?.05,  whil<:;  ,re,turning  from  a  court  trip \nto  the  Union  County  Courthouse,  Mr.  Braun  was  driven  by  three \nofficers  from  the  CTU  from  that  court  house.  past  the  A.D.T.C.  in \nAvene1,  Woodbridge,  all  the  way  to  Bordentown  in Mercer  County, \nwhere  he  was  transferred  to  a  van  in  the  parking  lot  of  the  Garden \nState Youth  Correctional  Facility. \n141.  Mr.  Braun  was  placed  in  the  back  seat  of  the  van,  next \nto  two  State  prisoners,  despite  the  fact  the  front  row  of  seats  in \nthe  inmate  compartment  of the  van  was  empty. \n142.  During  the  ten minutes  before  the  van  left  and  through \nthe  hour  and  a  half  it took  for  the  van  to  proceed  from  Bordentown \nto  the  Northern  State  Prison  in  Newark,  Mr.  Braun  was  subjected  to \n' \na  barrage  of  harassment,  intimidation,  physical  assault  and \npsychological  torture. \n143.  One  of  the  State  prisoners,  who  was  from  Northern  State, \nwas  the  primary  aggressor  and  initially grabbed  him  a·nd  shoved  his \nfist  at  Mr.  Braun,  threatening  to  punch  him  and  shank  him.  and \nthen  pulled  down  Mr.  Braun's  shirt  collar  looking  for  neck  chain, \nand  his  shirt  sleeve  looking  for  a  watch. \n144.  Mr.  Braun  was  told  by  the  State  prisoners  that  the  \"cops \nain't  going  to help  you,  they  set  you  up  and  told  us  to  have  our \nfun  with  you.\" \n145.

Throughout  the  two  hour  trip  the  State  prisoners \ncontinuously  harassed,  threatened  and  psychologically tortured Mr. \nBraun,  asking  him  to  give  them  a  good  reason  why  they  shouldn't \nkill him,  or  torture  him.  or  rape  him  like he  did  to  his  victim, \nnot  knowing  that  Mr.  Braun  was  not  incarcerated  for  rape. \nI \n147.  They  additionally made  hiq beg  them  not  to  hurt  him  and \no~ \nto  verbalize  that  he  was  \"a  piece  shit•  because  he  was  a  sex \noffender. \n148.  Throughout  this  abuse,  theI   officers  could  see  and  hear \nwhat  was  going  on,  and  laughed  at  t,e threats  and  harassment  they \nheard  and  made  jokes  about  it.  I \n149.  Upon  returning  to  the  A.D.T.C.  Mr.  Braun  was  so \ndistressed  that  an  A.D.T.C.  Sergeant  noticed  and  questioned  him \nabout  what  had  happened. \n150.

The  complaint  filed  with  he  administration  described  an \nincident which  occurred  on  July  20,  2004,  at  which  time  Mr.  Becka \nand  Mr.  Schultz were  placed  in the  front  seat  of  a  DOC  Central \nTransport  Van  under  the  supervision  of  Corrections  Officers  Coons \nand  Gorski.  The  particulars  of  the  reported  incident  are  as \nfollows. \n159.  At  the  time  A.D.T.C.  inmates  Becka  and  Schultz  were \nplaced  in  the  van  several  inmates,  who  had  already  been  picked  up \nfrom  other  State  prisons,  were  already  seated  directly  behind \nwhere  inmates  Becka  and  Schultz  were  placed. \n' \n160.  Throughout  the  trip  from  A.D.T.C ..  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates \nwere  subjected  to  a  continuous  barrage  of harassing  and \nintimidating  comments.  including  racial  slurs,  threats  of  personal \ninjury  and  homicide. \n161.  As  no  response  from  the  correctional  officers  on  the  bus \nwas  observed,  the  state  prisoners  escalated  the  severity  of  their \nthreats  as  they  also  increased  the  volume  of  their voices. \n162.  At  one  point  a  state  prisoner  told  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates \nthat  \"I'm doing  30·50 ... fuck  it ... !'m gonna  do  you  now,  white-ass \ncrackuh.\" \n163.  This  state  prisoner  then  immediately  delivered  a  \"sharp \nblow\"  to  the  back  of  Mr.  Becka's  head,  stunning  him  for  a  moment. \n... \nL.   \n. \n. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 37 of 50 PageID: 165\nRiley,  et  al  v.

Without  turning  around  to  see  who  was \nspeaking,  one  of  the  officers  asked  Mr.  Becka  if he  wanted  medical \nattention,  to which  Mr.  Becka  responded.  \"No,  I  want  protection.\" \n165.  During  the  rest  of  the  trip to  NJSP.  the  insults  and \nthreats  from  the  state  prisoners  against  the  A.D.T.C.  inmates \ncontinued  unabated  with  no  intervention  from  the  officers. \n166.  Upon  arrival  at  NJSP,  Sgt.  Ahearn  briefly  interviewed \nMr.  Becka  and  Officer  Coons,  and  had  Mr.  Becka  go  to  the  infirmary \nwhere  he  received  a  cursory  examination  and  600  mg  of  Ibuprofen. \n167.  Mr.  Becka  was  scheduled  for  another  medical  trip  for \nphysical  therapy  on  7/21/04.  However,  Central  Transport  claimed \nthey  did  not  have  paperwork  authorizing  his  transport with  his \nback  brace. \n168.  Mr.  Becka's  back  brace  is medically  prescribed  and \nnecessary  to  prevent  further  injury  to his  back.  Despite \npreviously  transporting Mr.  Becka  with  the  back  brace,  and \ntherefore  aware  of  its  existence  and  prior  medical  documentation. \nCentral  Transport  refused  to  transport  Mr.  Becka  to  his  physician-\nprescribed  and  scheduled  Physical  Therapy  appointment  with his \nback  brace,  and  also  refused  to  call  upstairs  to  the  A.D.T.C. \nhospital  to  have  documentation  of his  need  for  a  back  brace \nbrought  down  or  confirmed. \n\nII \nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 5    Filed 01/27/06   Page 38 of 50 PageID: 166 : '!i \n38  :Riley.  et  al  v.

The specific procedures state that: (1) when inmates of\nthe East Jersey State Prison (“EJSP”) are to be picked up with the\nsame transport vehicle as ADTC inmates, EJSP inmates are to be\npicked up first; (2) when transporting ADTC inmates with inmates of\nother institutions, the ADTC inmates are to be seated on the front\nrow bench seat within the inmate compartment, the second row bench\nseat will remain empty and all other inmates will be seated in the\nlast row; (3) ADTC inmates are to be held separate from all other\ninmates at the St. Francis Medical Center and New Jersey State\nPrison (“NJSP”); (4) holding ADTC inmates at the Garden State Youth\nCorrectional  Facility  (“GSYCF”)  should  be  avoided  as  much  as\npossible, however, if it is unavoidable, the ADTC inmates are to be\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 10 of 47 PageID: 2095\nheld in one of the cells separate from all other inmates; (5) when\ntransporting ADTC inmates for court or hearings, the ADTC inmates\nmust be held in a separate holding cell away from other state or\ncounty inmates; and (6) the ADTC inmates will not be identified as\nbeing from the ADTC, but rather, they will be identified by name\nand number only.  Therefore, the concerns raised by Plaintiffs in\ntheir Complaint have all been addressed by these updated Standard\nOperating Procedures rendering Plaintiffs’ Complaint moot.\nAdditionally, the Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed\nbecause Plaintiffs failed to properly exhaust their administrative\nremedies  pursuant  to  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995\n(“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), prior to bringing suit. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs’ Complaint should be dismissed because it\nis based upon an impermissible theory of respondeat superior.\nFurthermore, Plaintiffs have failed to set forth valid claims\nof:  1)  failure  to  protect  under  the  Eighth  Amendment,  2)  a\nviolation  of  their  due  process  rights  under  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment, 3) Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, 4)\na denial of legal access, 5) discrimination in violation of the New\nJersey  Law  Against  Discrimination,  and  6)  discrimination  in\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\nIn  sum,  the  defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss,  or  in  the\nalternative, for Summary Judgment, should be granted.\n-2-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 11 of 47 PageID: 2096\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order on\nJanuary 18, 2006 and brought a Complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 on January 27, 2006, against State Defendants, Devon Brown,\nFormer Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections,\nand William Plantier, Director of the Division of Operations for\nthe  New  Jersey  Department  of  Corrections,  which  was  served  on\nDefendants Brown and Plantier by Waiver of Service on February 9,\n2006.  Defendants Brown and Plantier opposed Plaintiffs’ motion\nasserting that Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the elements necessary\nto impose preliminary restraints.  On March 16, 2006, the Court\nentered a Preliminary Injunction against the Defendants Brown and\nPlantier. \nOn  May  1,  2006,  a  Motion  to  Dissolve  the  Preliminary\nInjunction  was  filed  on  behalf  of  the  Defendants  Brown  and\nPlantier.  In response, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Postpone the\nAutomatic Stay of the Preliminary Injunction that took place on\nJune 1, 2006, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(e)(2).  Additionally,\nPlaintiffs filed a Motion for a Second Preliminary Injunction Upon\nthe Automatic Termination of  the  First Preliminary Injunction,\nwhich  occurred  on  June  16,  2006,  pursuant  to  18  U.S.C.  §\n3626(a)(2).    Oppositions  to  Plaintiffs’  Motions  were  filed  on\nbehalf of Defendants Brown and Plantier on June 5, 2006.\n-3-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 12 of 47 PageID: 2097\nOn June 21, 2006, the Court entered an Order and Opinion\ndismissing  as  moot  the  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dissolve  the\nPreliminary Injunction and the Plaintiffs’ Motion to Postpone the\nAutomatic  Stay  of  the  Preliminary  Injunction  because  the\npreliminary injunction automatically expired on June 16, 2006; and\ngranting Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Second Preliminary Injunction. \nOn July 19, 2006, the Court granted the Defendants’ Motion to\nExtend Time to Answer the Complaint.  The Defendants’ Answer is due\nby August 17, 2006.  This Motion to Dismiss in Lieu of an Answer,\nor in the alternative for Summary Judgment, follows.\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nA. Inmate Transportation\nThere were 1,975 transports of inmates housed at the Adult\nDiagnostic and Treatment Center (“ADTC”), from January 2004 through\nMay 2006.  See Affidavit of Loretta C. Brancato, dated August 16,\n2006, (hereinafter “Brancato Aff.”), Exhibits C and E.  Of those\n1,975 ADTC inmate transports, only four alleged incidents occurred\ninvolving an assault or verbal harassment of an ADTC  inmate by a\nstate inmate from another institution, while under the custody and\ncare of the New Jersey Department of Corrections; while 99.8% were\ncompleted without incident.  See Brancato Aff., Exhibits C and E;\nand  Affidavit  of  Melissa  Matthews,  dated  August  15,  2006,\n(hereinafter “Matthews Aff.”), ¶¶ 29 and 31.  \n-4-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 13 of 47 PageID: 2098\nA review of all Administrative Remedy Forms filed from January\n2004 through May 31, 2006 by state inmates housed at the ADTC\nrevealed no additional complaints with regard to any assault or\nharassment of ADTC inmates during transports with the exception of\nthose four alleged incidents.1  See Matthews Aff., ¶¶ 29 and 31. \nThose  state  inmate  transports  conducted  by  the  Central\nTransportation Unit (“Central Transportation”) are governed by the\n1\nThese reported incidents were the alleged assault of former inmate\nTodd Becka on July 20, 2004 during a medical transport (Chavers\nAff., Exhibit A), the alleged assault of inmate Cornwell on May 24,\n2005  in  the  GSYCF  holding  cell  during  his  return  trip  from  a\nmedical appointment (Matthews Aff., Exhibits B), the alleged verbal\nharassment of inmate Braun on December 13, 2005 during the return\ntrip from a court appearance (Matthews Aff., Exhibit D); and the\nalleged verbal harassment of Randall Venzie on April 7, 2006 in the\nGSYCF holding cell during his return trip from a court appearance\n(Matthews Aff., Exhibit R). \nThere were two other administrative remedy forms filed by ADTC\ninmates who alleged only that they were identified as ADTC inmates\nby DOC officers during transport.  See Matthews Aff., ¶¶ 32 and 33.\nInmate Michael Davidson filed a grievance form on May 3, 2006\nalleging that he was identified during a transport by a state\ninmate who had seen the transport roster.  See Matthews Aff.,\nExhibit S.  However, upon investigation, it was determined that the\nstate inmate could not have seen the transport roster because the\ntransport paperwork was secured by the transport officers up front\nwith them and the inmate did not have access to the paperwork at\nany time.  Id.\nInmate Javier Ramirez filed a grievance form on March 23, 2006\nalleging that while he was held in the GSYCF holding cell, an\nofficer came in and asked “Who’s going to Avenel ADTC?” and inmate\nRamirez  identified  himself.    See  Matthews  Aff.,  Exhibit  S.\nAlthough inmate Ramirez further contends that he was then left\nalone with the inmates in the holding cell, he does not allege that\nhe was subject to any verbal harassment or physical assault.  Id.\nUpon investigation, the officer reported that he did not recall\nentering the holding area and asking that question.  Id.  The\nofficer further stated that doing what Ramirez alleged had never\nbeen a practice of his in the past or present.  Id.\n-5-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 14 of 47 PageID: 2099\nCentral  Transportation  Standard  Operating  Procedures.    See\nAffidavit  of  Loretta  C.  Brancato,  dated  August  16,  2006,\n(hereinafter “Brancato Aff.”), ¶ 2.  On July 1, 2006, the New\nJersey Department of Corrections amended its Central Transportation\nStandard  Operating  Procedures  to  include  specific,  permanent\nprocedures to be adhered to when transporting, escorting or holding\ninmates  housed  at  the  Adult  Diagnostic  and  Treatment  Center\n(“ADTC”).  Id., ¶¶ 2 and 4, Exhibit A, 40-41.  These procedures\nregarding transporting, escorting or holding ADTC inmates are not\ntemporary policy changes for the Department of Corrections, but\nrather permanent additions to the Central Transportation Standard\nOperating Procedures.  Id., ¶ 4.\nInmate transports are scheduled with Central Transportation by\neither the institution in which the inmate is housed, Correctional\nMedical Services, or the court.  Id., ¶ 5.  Correctional Medical\nServices is responsible for notifying Central Transportation of an\ninmate’s medical appointment and the need for a transport.  Id., ¶\n6.    Inmates’  court  appearances  are  scheduled  with  Central\nTransportation when Central Transportation receives a Writ or Court\nOrder to produce an inmate at a court.  Id., ¶ 7.  The institutions\nin which an inmate in need of transport for any purpose other than\nmedical  or  court,  are  responsible  for  notifying  Central\nTransportation of the need for a transport.  Id., ¶ 8.\n-6-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 15 of 47 PageID: 2100\nCentral  Transportation  then  compiles  all  requests  for\ntransports for the following week and creates a schedule for the\npick-up of inmates going out to and returning from appointments or\nappearances.    See  Brancato  Aff.,  ¶  9.    The  inmates  of  those\ninstitutions in close proximity to one another are transported\ntogether.  Id., ¶ 10.  For example, inmates of East Jersey State\nPrison (“EJSP”) and the ADTC are transported together because those\ninstitutions are physically located next to one another.  Id., ¶\n12.  When a transportation unit is scheduled to pick up inmates\nfrom both the ADTC and EJSP, the ADTC inmates will be picked up\nfirst.  Id., ¶ 13 and Exhibit A at 40.\nOnce all inmates have been picked-up from their institutions,\nthey  are  all  brought  to  Albert  C.  Wagner  Youth  Correctional\nFacility  (“ACWYCF”),  where  the  transporting  officers  use  the\ntransportation  schedule  and  the  inmates’  names  and  numbers  to\nseparate the inmates by their destinations and place the inmates on\na vehicle which is to proceed to their particular destinations.\nSee Brancato Aff., ¶ 17.  For example, at ACWYCF, all the inmates\nneeding to go to Ocean County Court are put on the same vehicle\nwhich goes to Ocean County Court.  Id., ¶ 18.  It is the same for\neach  destination;  all  those  inmates  heading  to  a  particular\ndestination are transported together to that destination.  Id., ¶\n19.\n-7-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 16 of 47 PageID: 2101\nWhen transporting ADTC inmates with other state inmates, the\nADTC inmates are to be seated on the front row bench seat within\nthe  inmate  compartment,  the  second  row  bench  seat  will  remain\nempty, and all other inmates will be seated in the last row.  See\nBrancato  Aff.,  ¶  14  and  Exhibit  A  at  40.    Additionally,  the\ntransporting officers are not to identify ADTC inmates as being\nfrom the ADTC and will identify ADTC inmates by name and number\nonly.  Id., ¶ 15 and Exhibit A at 41.  The transporting officers\nare  provided  with  a  schedule  of  transports,  which  lists  the\ninmates’ names and numbers, and is used to verify the inmates are\non the correct transport vehicle to proceed to their destinations.\nId., ¶ 16.\nWhen  a  transport  occurs  after  1:00  p.m.,  Central\nTransportation uses the Admission and Discharge Intake Area Tank 1\nat GSYCF as a holding cell for inmates being transported from\nvarious locations across the State and returning to their home\ninstitution.  See Brancato Aff., ¶ 20.  The inmate is brought to\nthe GSYCF holding cell to await a transport to their destination.\nId., ¶ 21.  However, holding ADTC inmates in GSYCF will be avoided\nas much as possible by making every effort to return ADTC inmates\nto the ADTC prior to 1:00 p.m.  Id., ¶ 22 and Exhibit A at 41.\nWhen the transport of an ADTC inmate after 1:00 p.m. is unavoidable\nand the ADTC inmate must be held at the GSYCF, the ADTC inmate will\n-8-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 17 of 47 PageID: 2102\nbe kept in a separate cell from all other inmates.  Id., ¶ 23 and\nExhibit A at 41. \nWhen an inmate is transported to a medical appointment, he or\nshe is escorted by an officer who remains with the inmate at the\nappointment.  See Brancato Aff., ¶ 24.  During medical appointments\nor  outpatient  testing  at  the  St.  Francis  Medical  Center,  ADTC\ninmates will be held in holding cells separate from all other\ninmates.  Id., ¶ 25 and Exhibit A at 41.  During appointments at\nthe New Jersey State Prison (“NJSP”), the ADTC inmates will be kept\nseparate from all other inmates at all times, including intake\nholding cells for holding purposes and intake holding cells for\nstrip search purposes.  Id., ¶ 26 and Exhibit A at 41. \nWhen an inmate is transported to a court appearance, he or she\nis escorted to the court and depending on the court and remand\nschedule, the transporting officer may remain with the inmate or\nremand the inmate to the custody of that court.  See Brancato Aff.,\n¶ 27.  If the inmate is remanded to that court, the transporting\nofficer will leave the inmate in the custody of the county and\nreturn  for  the  inmate  when  the  court  notifies  Central\nTransportation  that  the  inmate’s  business  with  the  court  has\nconcluded.  Id., ¶ 28.  When transporting ADTC inmates for court\nappearances, the ADTC inmates will be held in a separate holding\ncell away from other state or county inmates.

See Brancato Aff., ¶ 30.  Again,\ninmates of institutions that are near one another are transported\ntogether.  Id., ¶ 31.  Therefore, inmates of EJSP and ADTC are\ntransported back to those institutions on the same vehicle with the\nADTC inmates seated on the front row bench seat, the second row\nbench seat remaining empty, and the EJSP inmates seated in the last\nrow.  Id., ¶ 32 and Exhibit A, 40. \nDuring all transports, inmates are shackled with leg irons,\nbelly chains and wrist shackles that are secured to the belly\nchain.  See Brancato Aff., ¶ 33 and Exhibit A, 25.  Additionally,\nall  inmates  are  kept  under  constant  surveillance  during  and\nawaiting transport.  Id., at ¶ 34 and Exhibit A, 30 and 33.\nB. Actions Taken When Inmate-on-Inmate Altercations Occur\nWhen  an  Administrator  of  a  Correctional  Institution  or\ndesignee learns of an inmate-on-inmate altercation, he or she shall\nnotify the Special Investigations Division (“SID”), which shall\nmake an immediate inquiry to determine the facts of the situation.\nN.J.A.C. 10A:21-5.1(a).  The SID shall then investigate and prepare\nwritten reports regarding any inmate-on-inmate altercations brought\nto its attention.  N.J.A.C. 10A:21-8.5(a).  If an inmate is found\n-10-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 19 of 47 PageID: 2104\nto have threatened or assaulted another inmate, they are subject to\ndisciplinary charges.2  N.J.A.C. 10A:4-1.1 et seq.\nC. Grievance Procedure\nThe administrative grievance procedure has been established to\ngive the inmate population a way to bring complaints and problems\nto the attention of the Administration at the ADTC.  See Matthews\nAff.,  ¶  12.    Pursuant  to  the  ADTC  Inmate  Handbook,  the\nAdministrative  Remedy  Forms  are  available  to  all  ADTC  inmates\nthrough their Housing Unit Officer, Unit Social Worker or the Law\nLibrary.  Id., Exhibit J.  Once the inmate completes the form and\nsubmits it to the Office of the Executive Assistant in Charge of\nRemedy Forms, the form is then given to the appropriate supervisor\nfor a response.  Id.  When the inmate receives the response to the\nAdministrative Remedy Form, his remedies have been exhausted.  Id.\nThose Administrative Remedy Forms filed by Plaintiffs were\nreviewed.  See Matthews Aff., ¶ 19.  Although Plaintiffs Cornwell,\nMacrina, Riley, and Gibbs have all filed Administrative Remedy\nForms on various issues, they never filed an Administrative Remedy\nForm regarding the allegations in Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  Id.,\nExhibits K, N, O, and P.  Plaintiff Vansciver has not filed any\n2Assaulting any person; threatening another with bodily harm\nor with any offense against his or her person or his or her\nproperty; and fighting with another person are all prohibited\nacts under N.J.A.C. 10A:4-4.1.  If an inmate is found guilty of\nany of these prohibited acts, they are subject to the sanctions\nset forth in N.J.A.C. 10A:4-5.1(a).\n-11-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 20 of 47 PageID: 2105\nAdministrative Remedy Forms in the last two years.  See Matthews\nAff., ¶ 23.\nD. Alleged Incidents During Transports\nOnly four incidents were reported within the last two and a\nhalf years regarding an ADTC inmate being verbally harassed or\nassaulted by a state inmate from another institution during or\nawaiting transport.  Those alleged incidents are as follows:\n1. Facts Specific to Former Inmate Todd Becka, Non-Party to\nthis Matter                                            \nOn July 20, 2004, former inmate Todd Becka, SBI# 014241C, was\nbeing transported from the ADTC to New Jersey State Prison (“NJSP”)\nfor a medical trip, when he reported to the transporting officers\nthat he had been “kicked in the head” by a state inmate sitting in\nthe rear seat two rows behind him.  See Affidavit of Caprice L.\nChavers,  dated  April  28,  2006,  (hereinafter  “Chavers  Aff.”),\nExhibit  A.)    All  inmates  in  the  vehicle  were  secured  in  leg\nrestraints  and  were  under  constant  supervision.    Id.    The\nsupervising officer did not witness any altercation that verified\ninmate Becka’s claim of assault.  Id.  Nevertheless, Becka was\nbrought to the medical department of NJSP.  Id.  Upon evaluation,\nthe physician noted Becka’s head appeared normal and prescribed\nMotrin for Becka’s complaints of tenderness and mild pain.  Id.\nSenior  Corrections  Officer,  J.M.  Coons,  the  transporting\nofficer, wrote a special report regarding Becka’s allegations,\nwhich was forwarded from the Central Transportation Unit to the\n-12-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 21 of 47 PageID: 2106\nSpecial  Investigations  Division,  which  then  investigated  the\nmatter.  See Chavers Aff., Exhibit A.   \n2. Facts Specific to Plaintiff Paul Cornwell \nPlaintiff Cornwell, an ADTC inmate, alleged that during his\nreturn from a medical trip on May 24, 2005, he was injured by a\nstate inmate while in the GSYCF holding cell awaiting transport.\nSee Plaintiffs’ Memo of Law at 5.  Cornwell alleged that he was\nplaced in the holding cell, his wrist shackles were removed3 and an\nofficer allegedly announced that Cornwell was from “Avenel,”  then\nleft the holding area to watch as Cornwell was physically assaulted\nby a state inmate.  See Plaintiffs’ Complaint.\nHowever, Plaintiff Cornwell told a different story immediately\nafter the incident.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibit B.  Following the\nincident, Cornwell stated that the state inmate “asked me where I\nwas from and I stated ADTC, and he began hitting me and pulling at\nmy chain.”   Id.  Cornwell told a medical staff member that,\n“Another inmate asked me where I was from and I told him I was from\nAvenel . . . ”  Id.  Cornwell did not advise that an officer\nindicated that he was from Avenel.  Id.\nSenior  Corrections  Officer  (“SCO”)  Musso  observed  the\naltercation involving Plaintiff Cornwell and immediately notified\nCenter  Control  of  a  Code  #33.    See  Matthews  Aff.,  Exhibit  B.\n3Pursuant to Central Transportation’s SOP, leg irons must\nremain on inmates in the GSYCF holding cell awaiting transport. \nSee Brancato Aff., Exhibit A at 25.\n-13-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 22 of 47 PageID: 2107\nCenter Control then announced the Code #33 for additional officers\nto respond and assist in the removal of the inmates.  Id.  The\nofficers quickly entered the holding area and removed the inmates.\nId.  Both inmates were brought to the medical department.  Id. \nPlaintiff  Cornwell  suffered  a  contusion  to  his  left  eye,\nreddened  area  of  the  back  of  his  head,  a  bloody  nose  and  an\nabrasion to his right elbow.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibit B.  The\nother inmate suffered scrapes to his knees.  Id.  An investigation\nwas conducted and the other inmate was issued a disciplinary charge\nfor assaulting another inmate.  See Affidavit of Donald Mee, dated\nMay 1, 2006, (hereinafter “Mee Aff.”), Exhibit A.  The disciplinary\ncharge was amended by the Disciplinary Hearing Officer to fighting\nwith another person, to which the inmate pleaded guilty and was\nsanctioned  to  fifteen  days’  detention,  180  days’  loss  of\ncommutation  credit,  suspended  for  sixty  days,  180  days’\nadministrative segregation, suspended for sixty days, and 15 days’\nloss of recreational privileges.  Id., Exhibit A.\n3. Facts Specific to Plaintiff Inmate Peter Braun\nPlaintiff Braun, an ADTC inmate, alleged that on December 13,\n2005, he was subjected to verbal harassment by a state inmate\nduring his return transport from court.  See Plaintiffs’ Memo of\nLaw at 15-16.  Braun did not advise anyone from the DOC of this\nincident.  Rather, on December 13, 2005, officers noticed that\nBraun  was  agitated  after  his  court  trip  and    reported  their\n-14-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 23 of 47 PageID: 2108\nobservations to their supervisor.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibit D.\nBraun was then brought to the medical department in the ADTC.  Id.\nBraun stated to medical staff that during his transport another\ninmate grabbed him by the shirt, verbally accosted him and searched\nhim for jewelry.  Id.  He further stated that he did not report the\nalleged incident to the officers because he was not physically\nassaulted.  Id.\n4. Facts Specific to Inmate Randall Venzie, Non-Party to\nthis Matter\nOn April 7, 2006, inmate Randall Venzie was placed in the\nGSYCF holding cell during his return transport from a Cape May\nCounty Court appearance.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibit R.  Inmate\nVenzie alleges that in the holding cell the other state inmates\nsurmised that he was from the ADTC and began verbally harassing\nhim.  Id.  Inmate Venzie further alleges that Officer Masi then\ncame into the holding cell and demanded that each inmate tell him\nwhere  they  were  to  be  transported  to;  thus,  confirming  inmate\nVenzie was from the ADTC.  Id.  Thereafter, inmate Venzie alleges\nhe was subject to further verbal harassment while kept in the\nholding cell and during the transport to the ADTC.  Id.  At no\npoint was inmate Venzie physically assaulted by the other state\ninmates.  Id.\n5.  Facts Specific to Plaintiffs’ Nine Additional Declarations\nPlaintiffs have supplied this Court with nine declarations of\nADTC inmates in support of their Motion for a Second Preliminary\n-15-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 24 of 47 PageID: 2109\nInjunction and relied upon by Plaintiffs in their opposition to the\nState Defendants’ Motion to Dissolve.  Five of those declarations\nfail to assert any new allegations of verbal harassment or physical\nassault while under the custody and control of the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections during transports or being held in a\nholding  cell  awaiting  transports.4    See  Declarations  of  Paul\nBechold, Michael Davidson, Robert Pilkington, James J. Krivacska,\nJohn Thomas, William Dean and Phillip Disabella.  Two of the nine\ndeclarations indicate that the ADTC inmates were subject to verbal\nharassment only after other state inmates identified them as ADTC\ninmates.    See  the  Declarations  of  Ramoncito  Ramos  and  Randall\nVenzie.\nOnly the Declaration of Keith Gardner, an ADTC inmate, alleges\na physical assault by another state inmate while he was waiting in\nthe GSYCF holding cell for a return trip to the ADTC on May 5,\n2006.  See Declaration of Keith Gardner.  However, inmate Gardner\n4The Declaration of James Krivacska provides no new\nallegations of verbal harassment or physical assault during or\nawaiting transport than alleged in his earlier declaration.  The\nDeclaration of Paul Bechold alleges suffering verbal harassment\nby other state inmates while being held in a holding cell in the\nPassaic County Jail.  The Declaration of Michael Davidson alleges\nthat a state inmate knew he was from the ADTC because that state\ninmate allegedly saw the transport roster.  See the Declaration\nof Michael Davidson and Matthews Aff., Exhibit S.  However, the\ninvestigation revealed that at no time did the state inmate have\naccess to the transport roster as it was secured by the transport\nofficers and in the front of the van with them.  See Matthews\nAff., Exhibit S.\n-16-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 25 of 47 PageID: 2110\nwas never held in the GSYCF holding cell on May 5, 2006.  See\nBrancato Aff., ¶¶ 39-49 and Exhibits G, H and I.  \nThe daily transport schedule shows that inmate Gardner was the\nonly ADTC inmate to be picked up from the ADTC and dropped off at\nthe Middlesex County Court on May 5, 2006.  See Brancato Aff., ¶ 39\nand Exhibit G.  The trip ticket for Gardner’s return trip from his\nMiddlesex County Court appearance indicates that two inmates were\npicked up from the Middlesex County Court.  Id., ¶ 43 and Exhibit\nH.  The trip ticket further indicates that one of those inmates was\nbrought directly back to “1500\", which is the code for the ADTC,\nand the other was brought directly back to “1700\", which is the\ncode for the East Jersey State Prison.  Id., ¶ 44 and Exhibit H.\nBecause Gardner was the only ADTC inmate picked up and brought back\nfrom the Middlesex County Court on May 5, 2006, the inmate listed\non the trip ticket as picked up from the Middlesex County Court at\n1:18 p.m. and dropped off at the ADTC at 2:30 p.m. is Gardner.\nId., ¶¶ 45 and 46; and Exhibits G and H.  Additionally, the ADTC\nlog book for Friday, May 5, 2006 indicates that inmate Gardner was\nreceived by the ADTC at 14:34 (2:34 p.m.) from a court transport.\nSee Matthews Aff., Exhibit U.\nFurthermore, any inmate placed in the GSYCF holding cell has\nhis name listed in the GSYCF holding cell log book.  See Brancato\nAff., ¶ 48.  The GSYCF holding cell log book for May 5, 2006 does\n-17-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 26 of 47 PageID: 2111\nnot have Gardner listed as an inmate who was placed in the GSYCF\nholding cell on that date.  Id., ¶¶ 47-49, Exhibit I.\nE. Devon Brown, Former Commissioner of the New Jersey Department\nof Corrections\nDevon Brown has not been employed by the New Jersey Department\nof  Corrections  as  the  Commissioner  since  January  9,  2006.\nAffidavit of D. Craig Stevens, dated August 17, 2006, ¶ 2.  In\nfact,  Devon  Brown  is  no  longer  employer  by  the  New  Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections in any capacity.  Id., ¶ 3.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nA. The Rule 12(b)(6) Standard\nThe Court has authority to dismiss a suit for failure to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted if the Complaint clearly\ndemonstrates that plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts that\nwould entitle it to relief.  Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S.\n69, 73 (1984).\nB. Summary Judgment Standard\nSummary Judgment is proper in any case where there is no\ngenuine issue of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex\nCorp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  A defendant who seeks\nsummary judgment on a plaintiff’s cause of action must demonstrate\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact by either (1)\nsubmitting summary judgment evidence that negates the existence of\na material element of plaintiff’s claim or (2) showing there is no\n-18-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 27 of 47 PageID: 2112\nevidence to support an essential element of plaintiff’s claim.  See\nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23.\nLEGAL ARGUMENT\nPOINT I\nPlaintiffs’  Complaint  must  Be  Dismissed  as\nMoot.                                        \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint has become moot because the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections Central Transportation Unit updated its\nStandard Operating Procedures on July 1, 2006 to include specific,\npermanent procedures to be adhered to when transporting, escorting\nor holding inmates housed at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment\nCenter (“ADTC”).  Id., ¶¶ 2 and 4, Exhibit A, 40-41.  \n“An actual controversy must exist at all stages of federal\ncourt proceedings, both at the trial and appellate levels.  If\nevents subsequent to the filing of the case resolve the dispute,\nthe case should be dismissed as moot.”  Chemerinsky, Erwin, Federal\nJurisdiction § 2.5.1 (4th Ed. 2003).  The Supreme Court explained\nthat “mootness [is] the ‘doctrine of standing in a time frame.  The\nrequisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of\nthe litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence\n(mootness).’” United States Parole Commn. v. Geraghty, 445 U.S.\n388,  397  (1980)  (quoting  Henry  Monaghan,  Constitutional\nAdjudication: The Who and When, 82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384 (1973)).\nA court also must determine whether the facts underlying a\ndispute are still operative and thus whether a judgment by the\n-19-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 28 of 47 PageID: 2113\ncourt would provide meaningful relief.  Wilmington Firefighters\nLocal 1590 v. City of Wilmington Fire Dept., 824 F.2d 262, 266 (3d\nCir. 1987).  If the requested relief is unavailable, then the\ncourt’s opinion would be merely advisory and will not be rendered.\n[Id.]  Generally, a case is moot when: (1) the specific alleged\nviolation at tissue has ceased and it is not reasonably likely that\nit will occur again; and (2) the effects of the alleged violation\nhave been eliminated by other interim relief or events.  New Jersey\nTurnpike Authority v. Jersey Cent. Power and Light, 772 F.2d 25, 30\n(3d Cir. 1985).  More than mere speculation that the wrong may\nresume  is  required  to  “shield  a  case  from  a  mootness\ndetermination.”  Bunting v. Mellen, 541 U.S. 1019, 124 S.Ct. 1750,\n1752 (2004).\nOn July 1, 2006, the New Jersey Department of Corrections\nCentral  Transportation  Unit  updated  its  Standard  Operating\nProcedures to include the additional protections sought by the\nPlaintiffs in their Complaint.  See Brancato Aff., Exhibit A at 40-\n41.  These procedures are a permanent addition to the Central\nTransportation Standard Operating Procedures, which has changed the\nway the ADTC inmates are transported, escorted and held awaiting\ntransport.  See Brancato Aff., ¶ 4.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Brown are\nmoot because Devon Brown is no longer employed by the New Jersey\n-20-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 29 of 47 PageID: 2114\nDepartment of Corrections and therefore,  any  injunctive relief\nissued against Devon Brown would be pointless.\nTherefore, there has been a change in circumstances such that\nthere is no longer a genuine conflict between the parties and\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint is moot.\nPOINT II\nPlaintiffs’  Complaint  Is  Barred  by  Their\nFailure  to  Exhaust  Their  Administrative\nRemedies.                                    \nPlaintiffs  Complaint  must  be  dismissed  because  they  have\nfailed to properly exhaust their administrative remedies.  The PLRA\nrequires prisoners asserting a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to\nfirst exhaust administrative remedies.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\nSpecifically, § 1997e(a) provides that:\nNo action shall be  brought with respect to\nprison conditions under section 1983 of this\ntitle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner\nconfined  in  any  jail,  prison,  or  other\ncorrectional  facility  until  such\nadministrative remedies as are available are\nexhausted.\nThe exhaustion requirement applies to prisoners who were in\ncustody at the time they filed their original complaint.  Porter v.\nNussle, 531 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  Exhaustion is mandatory.  Booth\nv. Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2002).  Exhaustion must be total; that\nis, a complaint raising any unexhausted claim must be dismissed in\nits entirety even if the complaint also alleges exhausted claims.\nRivera v. Whitman, 161 F.Supp. 2d 343 (D.N.J. 2001).  42 U.S.C. §\n-21-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 30 of 47 PageID: 2115\n1997e(a) contains no futility exception that would excuse a failure\nto exhaust.  Booth, supra, 532 U.S. at 741 n. 6.  \nThe Supreme Court recently held that the PLRA requires “proper\nexhaustion.”  Woodford v. Ngo, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 2387 (2006).  The\nCourt stated that “[p]roper exhaustion demands compliance with an\nagency’s deadlines and other critical procedural rules because no\nadjudicative system can function effectively without some orderly\nstructure on the course of its proceedings.”  Id. at 2386. \na. The Exhaustion Requirement Applies to   \n  Plaintiffs.                             \n42 U.S.C. § 1915 provides that \"[a]s used in this section, the\nterm 'prisoner' means any person incarcerated or detained in any\nfacility  who  is  accused  of,  convicted  of,  sentenced  for,  or\nadjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms\nand  conditions  of  parole,  probation,  pretrial  release,  or\ndiversionary  program.\"    In  assessing  whether  the  exhaustion\nrequirement applies to plaintiff, a court must look to his status\nat the time he filed his complaint.  See Ahmed v. Dragovich, 297\nF.3d 201, 210 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nIn this case, the record is undisputed that all Plaintiffs\nwere  prisoners  incarcerated  with  the  New  Jersey  Department  of\nCorrections at the time they filed their Complaint.  See Matthews\nAff., Exhibits A, C, E, F, G, H and I).\n-22-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 31 of 47 PageID: 2116\nb.   Remedies  Outlined  In  The New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections Inmate Handbook\nMeet The Definition of An “Administrative\nRemedy” Within § 1997e (a)’s Exhaustion\nRequirement.                            \nThe Third Circuit in Concepcion v. Morton, 306 F.3d 1347 (3d\nCir. 2002) held that the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement applies to\nthe grievance procedure set forth in a New Jersey Department of\nCorrection’s inmate handbook.  Concepcion, 306 F.3d at 1348-1349.\nThus,  based  on  Concepcion,  the  Plaintiffs  were  obligated  to\nproperly exhaust all available administrative remedies, such as\nthose provided by the Inmate Handbook of the ADTC.\nc.   The Record Shows That Plaintiffs Failed\nTo Exhaust Their Available Administrative\nRemedies.                               \nAll Administrative Remedy Forms filed by each plaintiff were\nreviewed.  See Matthews Aff., ¶19.  Plaintiff Braun was the only\ninmate to file an Administrative Remedy Form regarding the incident\nhe  was  personally  involved  in  on  December  13,  2005.    Id.,  at\nExhibit  L.    Although  Plaintiffs  Braun  and  Krivacska  filed\nAdministrative  Remedy Forms regarding their concerns for their\nsafety during transports; they did not file any Administrative\nRemedy Forms concerning their other claims of violations of the\nFourteenth  Amendment  right  to  substantive  and  procedural  due\nprocess, Fourteenth Amendment right of equal protection, New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination, and the Americans with Disabilities\nAct.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibits L and M.\n-23-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 32 of 47 PageID: 2117\nAdditionally, although Plaintiffs Cornwell, Macrina, Riley and\nGibbs have all filed Administrative Remedy Forms on various issues,\nthey never filed an Administrative Form regarding any of the claims\nin Plaintiffs’ Complaint.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibits K, N, O and\nP.  Finally, Plaintiff Vansciver has not filed any Administrative\nRemedy Forms in the last two years, let alone any with regard to\nthe claims in the Complaint.  See Matthews Aff., ¶23.\nd. “Total  Exhaustion”  Is  The  Rule  Under\nSection 1997e(a).                       \nThis Court has held that a prisoner must exhaust all of the\nclaims that make up his federal civil action before he may file a\ncivil rights suit in federal court.  Rivera v. Whitman, supra, 161\nF.Supp. 2d at 337, 341 (D.N.J. 2001) abrogated on other grounds,\nRay v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 293 n.6 (3d Cir. 2002).  The Court\nheld that “the plain language of section 1997e(a), as well as the\nlegislative intent and policy interests behind it, compels a ‘total\nexhaustion’ rule.”  Id. at 343. \nIn this case, some Plaintiffs pursued their administrative\nremedies with regard to only some of the allegations contained in\ntheir Complaint, while others failed to pursue their administrative\nremedies with regard to all of the allegations contained in their\nComplaint.  See Matthews Aff., Exhibits K, L, M, N, O and P.\nBecause Plaintiffs’ Complaint contains exhausted and unexhausted\nclaims, the entire Complaint should be dismissed without prejudice\n-24-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 33 of 47 PageID: 2118\nfor Plaintiffs’ failure to properly exhaust their administrative\nremedies as required by 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\nPOINT III\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint Is Barred as a Matter of\nLaw Because a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Claim Cannot Be\nPremised upon a Theory of Respondeat Superior.\nPlaintiffs’ Complaint must be dismissed as to Defendants,\nDevon Brown, Former Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of\nCorrections, and William Plantier, Director of the Division of\nOperations for the New Jersey Department of Corrections because it\nis based on an impermissible theory of respondeat superior.\nSupervisory  liability  under  42  U.S.C.  §  1983  cannot  be\npredicated solely upon a theory of respondeat superior. See Polk\nCounty v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 325 (1981).\nA defendant in a civil rights action must have\npersonal involvement in the alleged wrongs;\nliability cannot be predicated solely on the\noperation  of  respondeat  superior.  Personal\ninvolvement can be shown through allegations\nof personal direction or of actual knowledge\nand acquiescence. Allegations of participation\nor actual knowledge and acquiescence, however,\nmust be made with appropriate particularity.\n[Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F. 2d 1195, 1207\n(3d Cir. 1988) (citations omitted).]\n“Actual knowledge and acquiescence” suffice for supervisory\nliability because together they “can be equated with ‘personal\ndirection’ . . . .”  Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, 120 F. 3d at\n1294  (citation  omitted).    Furthermore,  while  knowledge  can  be\ninferred from circumstances, Baker v. Monroe Twp., 50 F.3d 1186,\n-25-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 34 of 47 PageID: 2119\n1194 (1995), it nevertheless must be actual knowledge. See Id. at\n1201 n.6 (Alito, C.J. concurring and dissenting).\nAccordingly, because the record is completely devoid of any\nevidence  that  the  Defendants  Devon  Brown  and  William  Plantier\nparticipated in the alleged violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional\nrights or had actual knowledge and acquiesced to another person's\nviolation of their rights, Plaintiffs’ Complaint must be dismissed.\nFurthermore, as Defendant Brown is no longer employed by the\nNew Jersey Department of Corrections, any injunctive relief granted\non the basis of his alleged knowledge and acquiescence is moot.\nPOINT IV\nPlaintiffs Cannot Show That Defendants Brown\nand  Plantier  Failed  to  Protect  Them  in\nViolation of the Eighth Amendment as There Is\nNo Substantial Risk of Harm to Plaintiffs to\nWhich Defendants Brown and Plantier Acted with\nDeliberate Indifference.                     \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint must be dismissed because they cannot\nestablish a failure to protect claim under the Eighth Amendment.\nTo establish a failure to protect claim, an inmate must show\nthat: (1) “he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial\nrisk of serious harm;”and (2) the defendant prison official acted\nwith deliberate indifference.  Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n834-837 (2004).  A prison official is deliberately indifferent when\nhe “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the\n-26-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 35 of 47 PageID: 2120\ninference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm\nexists, and he must also  draw the inference.”  Id. at 837.  An\nofficial’s failure to alleviate a significant risk that should have\nbeen recognized, and was not, does not constitute a violation of\nthe  Eighth  Amendment.    Farmer,  511  U.S.  at  838.    Therefore,\nPlaintiffs’ claims that Defendants Brown and Plantier failed to\nprotect them is without merit and should be dismissed.   \nA “pattern of violence” does not exist with regard to the\nalleged  harassment  or  assaults  of  ADTC  inmates  by  other  state\ninmates  during  transport.    In  fact,  of  the  1,975  ADTC  inmate\ntransports,  from  January  2004  through  May  31,  2006,  only  four\nalleged  incidents  occurred  involving  an  assault  or  verbal\nharassment  of  an  ADTC  inmate  by  a  state  inmate  from  another\ninstitution, while under the custody and care of the New Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections.  See Matthews Aff., ¶¶ 29 and 31.  \nA  review  of  all  Administrative  Remedy  Forms5  filed  from\nJanuary 2004 through May 31, 2006 by state inmates housed at the\nADTC revealed no additional complaints with regard to any assault\n5The administrative grievance procedure has been established\nto give inmates a direct avenue to bring complaints and problems\nto the attention of the DOC Administration.  See Matthews Aff.\n¶12 and Exhibit J.  Plaintiffs attempt to argue that the absence\nof an inmate filing a grievance form does not equate to the\nabsence of an incident having occurred during or awaiting\ntransport.  However, the PLRA and its interpreting caselaw\nconsistently require inmates to file grievance forms with the DOC\nAdministration so the DOC has the ability to address the\nsituations prior to the inmates going to court.  See 42 U.S.C. §\n1997e(a); and Woodford, supra, 126 S.Ct. at 2387.\n-27-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 36 of 47 PageID: 2121\nor harassment of ADTC inmates during transports with the exception\nof those four incidents.  See Matthews Aff., ¶¶ 29 and 31. \nAlthough unfortunate, these random incidents are also very\nrare  and  unconnected  to  any  behavior  on  the  part  of  prison\nofficials, and in no way are indicative of a “pattern of violence”\nor deliberative indifference.  Rather, there is no evidence to\nsupport a finding of a “pattern of violence” nor the creation of an\nunreasonable risk that would support a failure to protect claim.\nNot  only  are  inmate-on-inmate  altercations  involving  ADTC\ninmates during transport quite rare, but the DOC has implemented\nprocedures to provide even further protection for ADTC inmates\nduring or awaiting transports, which make the types of altercations\ncomplained  of  by  Plaintiffs  even  less  likely  to  occur.    See\nBrancato Aff., Exhibit A, 40-41.  Therefore, the DOC should be\ngiven the discretion it is entitled by the courts.  It is an\nextraordinarily difficult task to conduct the transportation of\ninmates to and from institutions.  See generally, Turner v. Safley,\n482 U.S. 78, 84-85 (1987).  “[T]he judiciary is ‘ill equipped to\ndeal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration\nand reform’ and should therefore give significant deference to\njudgments made by prison officials in establishing, interpreting,\nand applying prison regulations.”  Fraise v. Terhune, 283 F.3d 506,\n515 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Turner, 482 U.S. at 84-85).\n-28-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 37 of 47 PageID: 2122\nMoreover, as Defendant Brown is no longer employed by the New\nJersey Department of Corrections, any injunctive relief granted on\nthe basis of his alleged failure to protect Plaintiffs is moot.\nTherefore,  Plaintiffs  are  unable  to  establish  an  Eighth\nAmendment claim and their Complaint should be dismissed.6\nPOINT V\nPlaintiffs Do Not Possess A Liberty Interest\nIn  The  Condition  Of  Their  Confinement  And\nTherefore  Cannot  Sustain  A  Cognizable  42\nU.S.C.  §  1983  Action  Predicated  Upon  the\nFourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.     \nPlaintiffs cannot establish a claim that the Defendants Brown\nand Plantier disregarded an excessive risk to the health and safety\nof  ADTC  inmates  during  court  and  medical  trips  and  that  such\nconduct has deprived them of their substantive and procedural due\nprocess rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Plaintiffs’\nComplaint, 40-41.  Under the Due Process Clause, liberty interests\nare  limited  to  circumstances  exceeding  the  sentence  \"in  an\nunexpected manner.\"  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995).\nThus, the Due Process Clause does not create a liberty interest in\nbeing free from \"every change in the conditions of confinement\nhaving  a  substantial  adverse  impact  on  the  prisoner\"  or  from\n6Also, Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claims based upon verbal\nharassment must be dismissed because claims of harassment are not\ncognizable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and do not rise to the level of\na constitutional violation.  See Oltarzewski v. Ruggiero, 830\nF.2d 136, 139 (9th Cir. 1987); Prisoners’ Legal Association v.\nRoberson, 822 F.Supp. 185, 189 (D.N.J. 1993); and Murray v.\nWoodburn, 809 F.Supp. 383 (E.D.Pa. 1993). \n-29-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 38 of 47 PageID: 2123\ntransfers from one cell to another or one prison to another, so\nlong as conditions remain \"‘within the normal limits or range of\ncustody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.’\"\nId. at 478, (quoting Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 225 (1976)). \nPOINT VI\nPlaintiffs  Cannot  Establish  an  Equal\nProtection Claim Because They Are Not a Member\nof a Suspect Class and the State Defendants’\nTransportation  Procedures  Are  Rationally\nRelated to a Legitimate State Purpose.       \nPlaintiffs cannot establish an equal protection claim under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment because they are not members of a suspect\nclass  and  the  inmate  transportation  procedures  are  rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state purpose.  Plaintiffs claim to be\nmembers of a suspect class, which would require strict scrutiny of\ntheir claims.  It is inconceivable that inmates convicted of sex\noffenses and found to be compulsive and repetitive offenders would\ngive rise to a suspect class, and no court has so held.  Therefore,\nthe  prison  authorities'  actions  must  be  upheld  if  they  are\nrationally  related  to  a  legitimate  state  purpose.    Hluchan  v.\nFauver, 480 F.Supp. 103, 109 (D.N.J. 1979), aff'd 659 F.2d 1067 3d\nCir. 1981).  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ Equal Protection claim must be\ndismissed because the manner in which the transports are conducted\nis rationally related to legitimate state purposes and Plaintiffs\ncannot show that Defendants Brown and Plantier acted arbitrarily.\n-30-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 39 of 47 PageID: 2124\nPOINT VII\nPlaintiffs  Cannot  Establish  a  Legal  Access\nClaim Because the State Continues to Provide\nPlaintiffs with Safe Transports to Their Court\nAppearances and Is Not in Any way Prohibiting\nThem from Accessing the Courts.              \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants Brown and Plantier knowingly\ndisregarded an excessive risk to the health and safety of ADTC\ninmates during and awaiting transports, and, in doing so,Defendants\nBrown and Plantier failed to act reasonably to protect ADTC inmates\nfrom the substantial risk of serious bodily harm or injury, which\nhas  deterred  Plaintiffs  from  exercising  their  rights  to  seek\nredress of grievances and to have access to the courts.  This claim\nis  without  merit,  especially  given  the  updated  Central\nTransportation Standing Operating Procedures for transporting ADTC\ninmates. \nIt is well established that “prisoners have a fundamental\nright to access to the courts which requires prison authorities to\nprovide adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons\ntrained in the law.”  Ingalls v. Florio, 968 F.Supp. 193, 202\n(D.N.J.  1997)(citing  Bounds  v.  Smith,  430  U.S.  817  (1977)).\nHowever, in order to successfully establish a legal access claim,\na prisoner must show that he suffered an “actual injury” as a\nresult of an inadequate law library or inadequate legal assistance.\nLewis  v.  Casey,  518  U.S.  343,  349  (1996).    The  United  States\nSupreme Court in Casey instructs that an inmate must demonstrate\n-31-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 40 of 47 PageID: 2125\nthat he was “hindered in his efforts to pursue a [nonfrivolous]\nlegal claim” in order to meet the “actual injury” requirement.  Id.\nat 351-353.  Finally, Casey instructs that an inmate can only\nestablish “actual injury” where his alleged hindered legal action\nconcerned a direct or collateral attack upon his sentence, or a\nchallenge to his conditions of confinement.  Id. at 354-355.    \nDespite the alleged acts of Defendants Brown and Plantier\ndeterring Plaintiffs from exercising their rights to seek redress\nof grievances and to have access to the courts, Plaintiffs have\nprolifically continued to use correspondence, administrative remedy\nforms and complaints, such as the instant written Complaint, to\naddress their concerns.  In fact, Plaintiffs set forth in this\ncomplaint that some of them filed a few Administrative Remedy Forms\nto address the concerns outlined in the complaint.  See e.g., Abany\nv. Fridovich, 862 F.Supp. 615, 621 (D.Mass. 1994)(\"Not only does\nplaintiff  not  allege  any  facts  indicating  that  his  speech  was\nchilled, but also that the fact that this suit was filed further\nsuggests that their speech was not chilled.\").  Plaintiffs’ actions\ndefeat any claim that they suffered adverse action sufficient to\nrise to the level of a constitutional violation. \n-32-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 41 of 47 PageID: 2126\nPOINT VIII\nPlaintiffs’  Claims  Against  the  Defendants\nBrown and Plantier Pursuant to the New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination Are Barred by the\nEleventh Amendment.                          \nPlaintiffs’ claims against Defendants Brown and Plantier under\nthe  New  Jersey  Law  Against  Discrimination  are  barred  by  the\nEleventh Amendment. \n“Under the Eleventh Amendment, a federal court is prohibited\nfrom hearing a suit against a state unless the state has consented\nto such a suit.”  Camden County Recovery Coalition v. Camden City\nBd. of Educ. for Public Sch. Syst., 262 F.Supp. 2d 446, 448 (D.N.J.\n2003).  The Eleventh Amendment provides that: “[t]he Judicial power\nof the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit\nin law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United\nStates by Citizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of\nany Foreign State.”  U.S. Const. amend. XI.\nThe Eleventh Amendment also prohibits suits against a state by\nits own citizens and suits against a state agency or department.\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984).\nThus, even where the state is not a named party to the action, the\nsuit will be barred so long as the state is the real party in\ninterest.  Camden County Recovery Coalition, supra, 262 F.Supp. 2d\nat 448.  “Therefore, absent waiver, neither a State, nor agencies\nunder its control may be subjected to lawsuits in federal court.”\nDoe v. Div. of Youth and Family Servs., 148 F.Supp. 2d 462, 483\n-33-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 42 of 47 PageID: 2127\n(D.N.J. 2001).  Moreover, regardless of whether the suit is for\nmonetary damages or injunctive relief, the Eleventh Amendment bars\nsuits against a state in federal court.  Camden County Recovery\nCoalition, supra, 262 F.Supp. 2d at 448.\nTherefore, Plaintiffs’ Complaint against Defendants Brown and\nPlantier is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\nPOINT IX\nPlaintiffs’ Claims Under the ADA Are Barred by\nthe Eleventh Amendment                       \nPlaintiffs’ claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n(“ADA”) are barred by the Eleventh Amendment as Plaintiffs have\nfailed even to allege conduct on the part of Defendants Brown and\nPlantier that actually violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court has held that “insofar as Title II creates\na  private  cause  of  action  for  damages  against  the  States  for\nconduct that actually violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II\nvalidly abrogates state sovereign immunity.”  United States v.\nGeorgia, 126 S. Ct. 877, 882 (2006).  In Georgia, the plaintiff\nalleged that he was confined for 23-to-24 hours per day in a 12-by-\n3-foot cell in which he could not turn his wheelchair around.  126\nS. Ct. at 880.  He alleged that the lack of accessible facilities\nrendered  him  unable  to  use  the  toilet  and  shower  without\nassistance, which was often denied.  Id.  On multiple occasions, he\nhad injured himself in attempting to transfer from his wheelchair\nto the shower or toilet on his own, and on several other occasions,\n-34-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 43 of 47 PageID: 2128\nhe had been forced to sit in his own feces and urine while prison\nofficials refused to assist him in cleaning up the waste.  Id.  He\nalso claimed that he had been denied physical therapy and medical\ntreatment, and denied access to virtually all prison programs and\nservices.    Id.    Therefore,  the  Supreme  Court  determined  that\nplaintiff’s claims in Georgia were based, at least in large part,\non conduct that independently violated the provisions of §1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment.  Id. at 882.  The unanimous opinion of the\nCourt goes no further than that, and does not hold that Title II\ncan abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by conduct that does not\nindependently  constitute an actual violation of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\nThe Supreme Court, in Georgia, stated that the “lower courts”\nare best situated to determine on a claim-by-claim basis, (1) which\naspects of a state’s alleged conduct would violate Title II; (2) to\nwhat  extent  such  conduct  would  also  violate  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment; and (3) insofar as such misconduct would violate Title\nII  but  would  not  violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  whether\nCongress’s purported abrogation of sovereign immunity as to that\nclass of conduct is nevertheless valid.  126 S. Ct. at 882.\nAs set forth more fully in Points V and VI, Plaintiffs cannot\nshow that the conduct of Defendants Brown and Plantier actually\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment.  Therefore, Title II of the ADA\ndoes not abrogate state sovereign immunity in this matter because\n-35-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 44 of 47 PageID: 2129\nDefendants’ conduct does not independently constitute an actual\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Plaintiffs’ ADA claim is\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment.\nPOINT X\nPlaintiffs Have Not Established a Prima Facie\nShowing of an Americans with Disabilities Act\nViolation.                                   \nEven if, arguendo, Plaintiffs’ ADA claim were not barred by\nthe Eleventh Amendment, Plaintiffs’ claim under the ADA must still\nbe  dismissed  because  Plaintiffs  cannot  show  they  have  been\ndiscriminated against.  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Brown and\nPlantier have failed to provide a safe and secure environment in\nwhich Plaintiffs may exercise their constitutional rights of access\nto  medical  treatment  on  the  basis  of  their  predisposition  to\ncompulsively and repetitively commit sexual offenses. \nThe  ADA  prohibits  discrimination  of  disabled  persons  by\ndenying any benefit or service offered by a public entity due to a\nperson’s  disability.  See,  42  U.S.C.  §§  12131,  et  seq.\nSpecifically, § 12132 states:\nSubject to the provisions of this title, no\nqualified individual with a disability shall,\nby reason of such disability, be excluded from\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of\nthe  services,  programs,  or  activities  of  a\npublic  entity,  or  be  subjected  to\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\nTo establish violation of Title II of the ADA plaintiff must\nshow: (1) that he or she is qualified individual with disability,\n-36-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 45 of 47 PageID: 2130\n(2) that he or she was either excluded from participation in or\ndenied benefits of some public entity's services, programs, or\nactivities, or was otherwise discriminated against by a public\nentity;  and  (3)  that  such  exclusion,  denial  of  benefits,  or\ndiscrimination was by reason of plaintiff's disability. See, 42\nU.S.C. 12131, et seq.;  See also, Tyler v City of Manhattan 849 F.\nSupp. 1429 (D.C. Kan. 1994).\na. Plaintiffs are Not “Disabled” Pursuant to\nthe ADA.                                \nThe Supreme Court has held that the ADA extends to disability\ndiscrimination against state prison inmates.  Pennsylvania Dep’t of\nCorr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212; 213 (1998).  Thus, pursuant to\nthe holding in Yeskey, as inmates, Plaintiffs are considered a\n“qualified individuals.”  However, as a prerequisite to an ADA\nclaim,  Plaintiffs  must  show  not  only  that  they  are  qualified\nindividuals, but also that they suffer from a disability. Mahon v.\nCrowell, 295 F.3d 585, 589 (6th Cir. 2002).  \nAs defined in § 12102(2), a “disability” is:\n(A) a  physical  or  mental  impairment  that\nsubstantially limits one or more of the\nmajor life activities of such individual;\n(B) a record of such an impairment; or\n(C) being  regarded  as  having  such  an\nimpairment.\nThe phrase \"substantially limits\" means “considerably” or “to\na large degree.” Toyota Motor Manuf., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams,\n534 U.S. 184, 196 (2002). Major life activities are those \"of\n-37-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 46 of 47 PageID: 2131\ncentral importance to daily life.\" Id.  They include such functions\nas  \"caring  for  one's  self,  performing  manual  tasks,  walking,\nseeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\" Id.\nat 195.  The predisposition to compulsively and repetitively commit\nsexual offenses is not a disability under the ADA.\nTherefore,  Plaintiffs  do  not  have  a  disability  under  the\ndefinition of the ADA and cannot succeed on the merits of their ADA\nclaim.\nb. Plaintiffs  Were  Not  Denied  Meaningful\nAccess to Any Program, Benefit or Service\nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  satisfy  the  second  prong  of  a\nviolation of Title II of the ADA because they have not shown that\nthey were excluded from participation in or denied benefits of any\nservices, programs or activities offered by Defendants Brown and\nPlantier or that they were otherwise discriminated against by the\nState Defendants. See, 42 U.S.C. 12131, et seq.; see also, Tyler v\nCity of Manhattan, supra.  In fact, Defendants Brown and Plantier\nhave continually provided Plaintiffs with safe transports to and\nfrom  medical  appointments  and  court  appearances.    Therefore,\nPlaintiffs are not being discriminated against.\n-38-\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 37-1    Filed 08/17/06   Page 47 of 47 PageID: 2132\nCONCLUSION\nBecause Plaintiffs did not state a claim upon which relief can\nbe granted, the Court should dismiss the suit.\nRespectfully submitted, \nZULIMA V.

Gibbs, and Peter Braun, who are state inmates currently housed in the\nAdult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (“ADTC”) in Avenel, New Jersey, filed a complaint\nagainst Defendants, Devon Brown, Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections\n(“DOC”), William Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and various John Does,\nemployees of the DOC, claiming that Defendants denied them certain constitutional rights and\nunlawfully discriminated against them by failing to protect them from other state inmates during\nvisits to other facilities for medical treatment and legal proceedings.  \nSpecifically, Plaintiffs’ complaint lists the following counts: (1) violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment right to substantive and procedural due process; (2) violation of the\nFourteenth Amendment right of equal protection; (3) violation of the First Amendment right to\nseek redress and to have access to the courts; (4) violation the New Jersey Law Against\nDiscrimination and the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (5) violation of the Eighth\nAmendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.  Plaintiffs sought a temporary\nrestraining order or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction.\nIn an opinion dated March 16, 2006, the court determined that Plaintiffs had\ndemonstrated: a likelihood of success on the merits as to their Eighth Amendment claim of cruel\nand unusual punishment; a likelihood of suffering irreparable injury; that the harm the\npreliminary injunction would impose on the Defendants did not outweigh the harm to the\nPlaintiffs; and, that it is in the public’s interest to protect Plaintiffs from the alleged violations.  \n2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 3 of 29 PageID: 1898\nThus, in a contemporaneous order, the court issued a preliminary injunction compelling\nDefendants to employ certain measures to safeguard Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights.  That order\nprovided, in part, the following:\nWhen inmates are removed from the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment\nCenter (“ADTC”) in Avenel, New Jersey, (the “Avenel Inmates”) and held or\ntransported with inmates from other correctional institutions: i) they shall not be\nidentified as inmates of Avenel; ii) inmates from other correctional institutions\nshall not be confined either in a vehicle or holding area so as to have physical\naccess to the Avenel Inmates unless a guard is present who is able to prevent the\nAvenel Inmates from being subjected to violence from other inmates; iii) guards\nand other prison officials shall be directed to halt forthwith any verbal or physical\nassaults made by inmates upon Avenel Inmates; iv) prison authorities shall\ninvestigate and promptly report upon any violence committed against any Avenel\nInmates. \n \nThe following motions are presently before the court: Defendants’ motion to terminate, or\nin the alternative, modify the preliminary injunction; Defendants’ motion to seal various\nconfidential documents; Plaintiffs’ motion for a second preliminary injunction;1 and Plaintiffs’\nmotion to postpone the automatic stay of the current preliminary injunction.2  \n1 The Prison Litigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(2) (“PLRA”), states that\n“[p]reliminary injunctive relief [with respect to prison conditions] shall automatically expire on\nthe date that is 90 days after its entry, unless the court makes the findings required . . . for the\nentry of prospective relief and makes the order final before the expiration of the 90-day period.” \nAs such, the preliminary injunction that was issued on March 16, 2006 automatically expired on\nJune 14, 2006.  Thus, Defendants’ motion to dissolve that preliminary injunction is moot. \nPlaintiffs filed their motion for a second preliminary injunction to take effect upon expiration of\nthe first preliminary injunction.\n2 Under the PLRA, § 3626(e)(2)(A), the filing of a motion to terminate a preliminary\ninjunction, such as the one presently before the court triggers the running of a 30 day period after\nwhich the preliminary injunction is automatically stayed pending a final order ruling on the\nmotion.  As Defendants’ motion to terminate was filed on May 1, 2006 the injunction was\nautomatically stayed on May 31, 2006.  Plaintiffs’ filed their motion to postpone the automatic\nstay pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3626(e)(3).  Under that subsection, “[t]he court may postpone the\neffective date of an automatic stay specified in subsection (e)(2)(A) for not more than 60 days for\n3\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 4 of 29 PageID: 1899\nFor the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs’ motion for a second preliminary injunction\nwill be granted.  Plaintiffs motion to postpone the automatic stay will be dismissed as moot. \nDefendants’ motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction will be dismissed as moot. \nDefendants’ motion to seal various confidential documents will be addressed in a separate\nopinion.  \nI.  BACKGROUND\n  The ADTC is a facility operated by the DOC for the detention and treatment of inmates\nwho have been convicted of sexual offenses and found to be compulsive and repetitive in their\noffending behavior.  Plaintiffs allege that prisoners such as themselves, who have been convicted\nof sexual offenses, are the most despised and reviled inmates in the prison system.  As such,\nPlaintiffs allege that they are harassed and physically assaulted by other state inmates whenever\nthey are exposed to those inmates, such as when they are transported to and detained in other\nfacilities (e.g., when they seek medical care at another prison or attend a legal proceeding).  As\nPlaintiffs wish to represent a class of inmates they state that each member of the class has\nsuffered from the violations alleged in the complaint and they include factual allegations that\npertain to inmates other than those who are named as Plaintiffs in the present case.  \nWith their original motion for a preliminary injunction, filed on January 18, 2006,\nPlaintiffs submitted affidavits to support the factual allegations in their complaint.  At the time,\nthose allegations were not denied by counter-affidavits.  As to the present motions, both sides\nhave submitted affidavits to support and/or contest the various factual allegations.\ngood cause.”  However, as the court will issue a second preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs’ motion\nto postpone the automatic stay is moot.  \n4\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 5 of 29 PageID: 1900\nClaims of Plaintiff Paul Cornwell\nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was transported from ADTC to the New Jersey State Prison\n(“NJSP”) on May 24, 2005 to receive physical therapy for a herniated disc.  After receiving\nmedical treatment he was transported to the Garden State Correctional Facility and placed in a\nholding area with another ADTC inmate, Zhi-men Chen, and approximately twelve other state\nprisoners for a period of about three hours.\nMr. Cornwell alleges that when he and Mr. Chen were placed in the holding area, one of\nthe two corrections officers announced to the other prisoners that Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Chen\nwere from Avenel, implying that they were sex offenders.  The two officers then allegedly stood\noutside a Plexiglass window and observed the events that followed.\nAccording to Mr. Cornwell, the other inmates began asking him and Mr. Chen questions. \nThey first asked Mr. Chen where he was from and Mr. Chen responded that he was from ADTC. \nTo that, another inmate said, “I know that place; that’s where all the rapists go.”  After several\nother questions another inmate allegedly asked Mr. Cornwell, “what did you do, rape a little\ngirl?”  The inmate then allegedly stood up and began yelling, accusing Mr. Cornwell of raping a\nlittle girl.  The inmate then allegedly sat down next to Mr. Cornwell and punched him in the\nchest.  He then allegedly demanded the gold chain and cross that Mr. Cornwell was wearing.  Mr.\nCornwell says that he replied, “I’m not giving you my fucking chain.”\nThe inmate then allegedly stood up and offered Mr. Cornwell an outstreched hand, saying\n“I’m sorry.”  When Mr. Cornwell shook the inmate’s hand, the inmate allegedly pulled Mr.\nCornwell forward and punched him in the left temple, knocking him to the floor and knocking\n5\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 6 of 29 PageID: 1901\nhim unconscious.  \nMr. Cornwell alleges that he was assaulted while he was unconscious and that when he\nawoke he had a large abrasion on his right arm and that the officers, still standing on the other\nside of the Plexiglass, had not responded.  Mr. Cornwell alleges that Mr. Chen gave a statement\nin which he said that after Mr. Cornwell was knocked out, the assault continued for several\nminutes and that Mr. Cornwell was “pummeled with fists and kicked with feet about his body\nwhile he was unconscious and defenseless” and yet the officers did nothing to stop the assault. \nMr. Cornwell was then allegedly taken to the infirmary and given a bag of ice for his head.\nAfter returning to ADTC Mr. Cornwell allegedly reported the incident to Sergeant Collins\nand was then examined by a nurse.  Mr. Cornwell alleges that his injuries included head injuries\nleading to dizziness and loss of consciousness, severe swelling in his face, and injuries to his\nright arm that eventually required surgery.  He says he was hospitalized for a total of 55 days and\nhas a permanent scar on his right arm because of the assault.  He further alleges that he suffered\nsevere psychological symptoms and that he was diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress\ndisorder resulting from the assault.  \nMr. Cornwell further alleges that since the attack he has declined medical treatment\nbecause he is afraid of suffering another attack.  He says he filed a grievance with the DOC\nregarding the May 24th incident but that the DOC rejected it.  He also says that he filed a Tort\nClaim Notice against the DOC but that it was denied.  As such, he says the DOC has been\ndeliberately indifferent to the risk of future attacks.\nDefendants admit that Mr. Cornwell was assaulted and that he “suffered a contusion to\n6\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 7 of 29 PageID: 1902\nhis left eye, reddened area of [sic] the back of his head, a bloody nose and an abrasion to his right\nelbow.”  (Pl.’s Br. in Support of Mot. to Terminate at 11).  However, they argue that the\ncorrections officer did not tell the other inmates that Mr. Cornwell was from ADTC.  Rather,\nDefendants state that the other inmates learned of Mr. Cornwell’s origin because Mr. Cornwell\ntold them where he was from.  Defendants rely on Mr. Cornewll’s statement following the\nincident in which he said that another state inmate asked him where he was from, that he told the\nother inmate he was from ADTC, and that the other inmate then began hitting him.  But that\nstatement is not inconsistent with Mr. Cornwell’s account of the incident in his affidavit in which\nhe says the corrections officer announced that Mr. Cornwell was from Avenel and other inmates\nsubsequently questioned him and Mr. Chen.\nAdditionally, Defendants argue that in waiting to stop the assault the corrections officers\nwere following procedure.  DOC procedure provides that when an officer witnesses an\naltercation between inmates the official is to notify Central Control of a “Code 33,” thus letting\nCentral Control know that there is an emergency and the officer needs assistance.  The\nemergency is then announced over the public address system and via radio.  A minimum of one\nsergeant and five officers will respond.  Moreover, the observing officer is instructed to wait for\nother officers to arrive before entering the holding cell to break up a fight.\nPlaintiffs point out that approximately 12 minutes passed between the time the fight\nbegan and the time that officers entered the holding cell.3\n3 Sergeant Claudius Bryant’s Incident Report indicates that the time of the incident was\n4:28 pm.  (Mathews Aff. Ex. B).  According to the reports submitted by officers who responded\nto the scene, 4:40 pm is the earliest that any of them arrived on the scene to stop the attack.  (See\ne.g., Sergeant Eric Wallenburg’s Special Report, Mathews Aff. Ex. B).\n7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 8 of 29 PageID: 1903\nClaims of Plaintiff Peter Braun\nPlaintiff, Peter Braun, alleges that he was assaulted by a state inmate from another facility\nwhen he was returning from a court hearing at the Union County Courthouse on December 13,\n2005.  Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that he was driven past the ADTC facility in Avenel to\nBordentown, in Mercer County, where he was transferred to a van in the parking lot of the\nGarden State Youth Correctional Facility.  Mr. Braun further states that he was placed in the back\nseat of the van next to two state inmates from another facility, even though the front row of seats\nin the van’s inmate compartment was empty.\nMr. Braun alleges that for the next hour and forty minutes, while the van drove to\nNorthern State Prison in Newark, he was “subjected to a barrage of harassment, intimidation,\nphysical assault and psychological torture.”  (Compl. ¶ 142).  Specifically, Mr. Braun alleges that\none of the other prisoners grabbed him, shoved his fist at him, threatened to punch and shank\nhim, and pulled on his collar and sleeves looking for jewelry and a watch.  Mr. Braun alleges that\nthe inmate told him that the “‘cops ain’t going to help you, they set you up and told us to have\nfun with you.’”  (Compl. ¶ 144).  In addition, the other inmate allegedly told Mr. Braun that the\nDOC officers told the inmates that he was from ADTC and was a convicted sex offender.  Mr.\nBraun further states that the two other inmates then threatened to torture, kill and rape him. \nFinally, Mr. Braun says the DOC officers could see and hear everything that occurred and that\nthey were laughing and making jokes about the threats and harassment.  \nMr. Braun states that he requires frequent transport for both medical treatment and court\nhearings.  He says the assault on December 13th left him severely distraught and afraid of making\nfuture trips in DOC custody.\n8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 9 of 29 PageID: 1904\nMr. Braun alleges that he filed an ARF on December 22, 2005, asking to be segregated on\nfuture trips.  He says that he has not received any response to the ARF.\nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nClaims of Plaintiff George Riley\nPlaintiff, George Riley, alleges the following:  He is Chairman of the ADTC Legal\nSubcommittee to the Inmate Resident Committee.  In that capacity, and on his own behalf, he\nwrote to Grace Rogers, ADTC Administrator, to request that procedures be put in place to protect\nADTC inmates from other state prisoners when they are transported.  Bernard Goodwin,\nAssociate Administrator, responded with a letter telling Mr. Riley that only the DOC Central\nOffice, not ADTC, had authority to change the procedures in question.  Thus, Mr. Riley wrote to\nDefendant, William Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC, and repeated his request.  He\nhas not received a response from Mr. Plantier.\nMr. Riley does not allege that he has ever been personally assaulted by other state\ninmates.  However, he says he is aware of such assaults on ADTC inmates and fears that\nDefendants’ failure to prevent such attacks presents an imminent risk to his health and safety as\nhe will need the DOC to transport him for court appearances and medical treatment in the near\nfuture.\nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nClaims of Plaintiff James J. Krivacska\nPlaintiff, James J. Krivacska, like Mr. Riley, does not allege that he has ever been\npersonally assaulted by other state inmates.  On the contrary, Mr. Krivacska describes his May\n9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 10 of 29 PageID: 1905\n31, 2005 visit to NJSP that transpired without incident.  Presumably, his account serves as an\nexample of how Plaintiffs wish to be transported as Mr. Krivacska describes being segregated\nfrom other inmates at all times and says that DOC officers protected him from other inmates and\ntook precautions to conceal his identity as an ADTC inmate.   \nDespite that positive experience, Mr. Krivacska alleges that he is afraid of future trips,\neither for medical care or court proceedings, because of what happened to Mr. Cornwell on May\n24, 2005.  Mr. Krivacska alleges that he filed an Administrative Remedy Form (“ARF”)\nexpressing his concern regarding the assault on Mr. Cornwell and indicating his fear of making\nfuture trips for medical care and court proceedings.  \nMr. Goodwin allegedly responded to the ARF with the same explanation he gave to Mr.\nRiley, i.e., that ADTC had no authority to change transport procedures.  Mr. Krivacska alleges\nthat he appealed Mr. Goodwin’s decision to no avail.  \nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nClaims of Plaintiff Vincent Macrina\nPlaintiff, Vincent Macrina, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on one\noccasion he was placed in a large holding cell with other state inmates while awaiting medical\ntreatment.  As he alleges that he suffers from several serious medical conditions he says he needs\nfrequent medical attention but turns it down because he is afraid of being assaulted by other state\ninmates during the transport process.\nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nClaims of Plaintiff William F. Vansciver\n10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 11 of 29 PageID: 1906\nPlaintiff, William F. Vansciver, does not claim to have been assaulted but says that on\nvarious occasions, when being transported for medical purposes, DOC officers identified him as\nan ADTC inmate to other state inmates, thereby putting him at risk of assault.  Mr. Vansciver\nalleges that he suffers from serious medical conditions and needs frequent medical attention. \nHowever, he states that he has declined medical attention because of the risk involved in seeking\nsuch attention.\nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nClaims of Plaintiff Richard Gibbs\nPlaintiff, Richard Gibbs, does not claim to have been assaulted but says he is aware of the\nattack on Mr. Cornwell and assault of Mr. Braun.  Although he wishes to attend court hearings\nconnected with his post-conviction relief hearing, he says he is afraid to attend because of the\nrisk involved in being transported to the hearings.\nDefendants do not dispute those allegations.\nAssault of Todd Becka\nIn addition to the above allegations Plaintiffs describe an attack on a former ADTC\ninmate, Todd Becka that allegedly occurred on July 20, 2004.  Mr. Becka, according to Plaintiffs’\nallegations, was threatened and attacked by an inmate from another facility while in transport to\nreceive medical attention.  The details of Plaintiffs’ allegations are drawn from a complaint that\nMr. Becka filed with the ADTC administration.  Plaintiffs state that Mr. Becka was struck in the\nhead and subjected to repeated threats of violence and that the DOC officers who were present at\nthe time did nothing to protect him.\n11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 12 of 29 PageID: 1907\nDefendants acknowledge that Mr. Becka reported being kicked in the head.  However,\nthey state that all inmates in the vehicle were secured in leg restraints and were under constant\nsupervision.  Moreover, the supervising officer stated that he did not observe any altercation that\nverified Mr. Becka’s claims.  Nonetheless, Mr. Becka was taken to the medical department and\nthe physician noted that Mr. Becka’s head appeared normal.\nOther Allegations\nIn addition to those that were submitted with the original motion for preliminary relief\nPlaintiffs have filed numerous affidavits to supplement the record.  Plaintiff Krivacska, as well as\ninmates Ramoncito Ramos, Robert Pilkington, John Thomas, Paul Bechold, Randall Venzie,\nMichael Davidson, William Dean, Phillip Disabella, and Keith Gardner, filed affidavits\ndescribing recent trips to other facilities.  For the most part, those affidavits allege various\ninstances in which the ADTC inmates were placed on transport vehicles and in holding cells\nalong with inmates from other prisons, their identity as ADTC inmates was revealed, and they\nwere subjected to verbal harassment and/or threats of physical violence and death.\nAdditionally, Mr. Gardner alleges that On May 5, 2006 he was held in the Garden State\nYouth Correctional Facility (“GSYCF”) while en route to ADTC, after appearing in Middlesex\nCounty Court.  He states that he was placed in a holding tank with about 15 or 20 other inmates. \nHe alleges that he was asked where he was from and responded that he was from ADTC.  He\nstates that he was then verbally harassed and eventually, two inmates attempted to attack him. \nHe alleges that a brief physical altercation ensued and that officers responded about five minutes\nlater and separated him from the rest of the inmates.  He does not provide any details as to the\nphysical altercation.\n12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 13 of 29 PageID: 1908\nDefendants contend that Mr. Gardner was never taken to the GSYCF on May 5, 2006. \nWhile Mr. Gardner was taken to Middlesex County Court on that date, his trip ticket indicates\nthat he was brought directly back to ADTC after his court appearance.  Moreover, Defendants\nnote that Mr. Gardner’s name does not appear on the GSYCF holding cell log book for May 5,\n2006.  They contend that his name would be in that book if he was held there on that day.\nPlaintiffs dispute the accuracy and reliability of both the trip ticket and cell log, noting\nseveral inconsistences and missing entries.  Thus, as to Mr. Gardner’s allegations, there are\nfactual questions that remain.  The circumstances warrant further investigation.\nII.  DISCUSSION\nStandard of Review for a Preliminary Injunction\nA preliminary injunction “is ‘an extraordinary remedy, which should be granted only in\nlimited circumstances.’” Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 290 F.3d 578,\n586 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Instant Air Freight Co. v. C.F. Air Freight, Inc., 882 F.2d 797, 800\n(3d Cir. 1989)).  “[T]he movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Mazurek\nv. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997).  Moreover, “[a] preliminary injunction cannot be issued\nwhen there are disputed issues of fact.  Hunterdon Transformer Co. v. Cook, No. 89-3132, 1990\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 1382, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 1990).\nTo obtain an injunction, [a movant must] demonstrate (1) that [it is] reasonably likely to\nprevail eventually in the litigation and (2) that [it is] likely to suffer irreparable injury\nwithout relief.  If these two threshold showings are made the District Court then\nconsiders, to the extent relevant, (3) whether an injunction would harm [the non-movant]\nmore than denying relief would harm the [movant] and (4) whether granting relief would\nserve the public interest.\n13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 14 of 29 PageID: 1909\nTenafly Eruv Ass’n, Inc. v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, 157 (3d Cir. 2002).  Specifically,\nwith respect to the second part of the analysis, “[t]o obtain injunctive relief, a party must make a\nclear showing of ‘immediate irreparable injury’ or a ‘presently existing actual threat.’” \nMarsellis-Warner Corp. v. Rabens, 51 F. Supp. 2d 508, 528 (D.N.J. 1999) (quoting Acierno v.\nNew Castle County, 40 F.3d 645, 655 (3d Cir. 1994)).\nUnder the PLRA, a “court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the\ncourt finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).4  Moreover, “[t]he court shall give substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused\nby the relief.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).\n1. Likelihood of success on the merits\nPlaintiff’s original motion for a preliminary injunction was granted because Plaintiffs\ndemonstrated a reasonable likelihood of succeeding in their Eighth Amendment claim by\nshowing that Defendants’ alleged practice of identifying them as sex offenders and refusing to\nseparate them from other state inmates creates an unreasonable risk that they will be assaulted\nand additionally prevents them from seeking necessary medical care. \nDefendants argue that the preliminary injunction should be terminated and that a second\npreliminary injunction should not be issued because the assaults on Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun,\nand Mr. Becka were isolated incidents and do not demonstrate a pattern of violence. \n4 Prospective relief is defined as “all relief other than compensatory monetary damages”\nand thus includes injunctive relief.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(7).\n14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 15 of 29 PageID: 1910\nSpecifically, Defendants state that between January, 2004 and January, 2006 a total of 1,749\ninmate transports involving ADTC inmates were performed and all but three of them were\ncompleted without incident.  Thus, Defendants contend, they safely transported ADTC inmates\n99.83% of the time.\nBut as Plaintiffs point out, that analysis is flawed.  Defendants attempt to show that the\npreliminary injunction is unnecessary because transport conditions are generally safe.  But in\nevaluating the need for a preliminary injunction not all of the 1,749 trips are relevant because\nmany of them do not involve the circumstances and conditions that the preliminary injunction is\nintended to remedy.  As the preliminary injunction is intended to protect ADTC inmates from\nbeing assaulted by other state inmates, an evaluation of the need for that injunction should only\ninclude those instances when ADTC inmates were held in close proximity to other state inmates. \nDefendants’ analysis is too broad because some of the 1,749 transports didn’t even involve\nADTC inmates and others involved ADTC inmates who were segregated from other inmates\nduring transport.\nFor example, some of the trips include new admissions to ADTC involving inmates from\nother jails.  Those prisoners are not yet ADTC inmates and are therefore less likely to be targeted. \nAdditionally, ADTC services halfway-house inmates who are not at risk of assault.  \nOf the remaining trips, i.e., those that actually involved ADTC inmates, many did not put\nthe inmates at risk because the ADTC inmates were never placed in holding cells with other\ninmates.  For example, Plaintiffs contend they have never been segregated from other inmates\nwhen they have been held at the GSYCF but have almost always been segregated when held at\nthe NJSP.  Thus, the incident rate at the GSYCF is likely to be higher than the incident rate at the\n15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 16 of 29 PageID: 1911\nNJSP.   \nMoreover, Defendants assume that the assaults on Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun, and Mr.\nBecka are the only assaults that have occurred over the last two years.  But that conclusion is\npresumptuous as the number of reported incidents does not necessarily equal the number of\nactual incidents.\nRegardless, a low incident rate does not necessarily preclude finding in Plaintiffs’ favor.\nPlaintiffs can satisfy their burden by simply presenting “evidence that . . .  harm . . .  occurred on\nnumerous occasions.”  Sample v. Diecks, 885 F.2d 1099, 1118 (3d Cir. 1989).  In Liles, 225 F.\nSupp. at 462, two inmates brought a cruel and unusual punishment claim against DOC\nsupervisors and employees alleging that the defendants’ policy of having some inmates sleep on\nmattresses on the floor of their cells, near the toilet, such that they were splashed with urine when\nother inmates used the toilet, led to several fights breaking out between inmates.  Plaintiffs\nalleged that the condition led to one of the plaintiffs having a fight with another inmate on one\noccasion and the other plaintiff having fights on at least two occasions.  Id.  The court said that\nthose “incidents establish[ed] a pattern of violence . . . .”  Id.\nFinally, although there have only been two undisputed physical assaults,5 many other\ninmates allege that they have been verbally harassed and threatened with violence and even\ndeath, thus bolstering Plaintiffs’ claim that the risk of future harm is great.\nTherefore, despite Defendants recently submitted affidavits and their argument that most\ntransports are safe, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.\n5 The assaults on Mr. Cornwell and Mr. Brown are undisputed.  There remain questions\nof fact as to the assaults on Mr. Becka and Mr. Gardner.  \n16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 17 of 29 PageID: 1912\nWith regard to the present motions Defendants also argue, for the first time, that Plaintiffs\ncomplaint should be dismissed because they have failed to fully exhaust their administrative\nremedies.  42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) provides that “[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison\nconditions under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983), or\nany other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility\nuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.”\nDefendants cite Rivera v. Whitman, 161 F. Supp. 2d 337, 341 (D.N.J. 2001) for the\nproposition that § 1997e(a) requires total exhaustion of all claims before Plaintiffs may file a\ncomplaint with this court.  Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to meet that requirement\nbecause only two of the Plaintiffs have filed ARFs that relate to the present complaint and those\nARFs did not include some of the allegations that are in the complaint.\nThus, Defendants are essentially arguing that the state never had the opportunity to\nremedy many of the violations in the current complaint.  As such, they contend that the entire\ncomplaint should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have not fully exhausted their administrative\nremedies.  \nBut in the present case the response that Mr. Krivacska received regarding his ARF made\nit clear that any further attempt for administrative relief by any of the Plaintiffs would have been\nfutile as that response indicated that ADTC did not have the authority to remedy the alleged\nviolations.  \nMr. Riley received a similar response when he wrote a letter to the ADTC Administrator,\nGrace Rogers, detailing his safety concerns. From Mr. Krivacska’s ARF and Mr. Riley’s letter\n17\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 18 of 29 PageID: 1913\nthe ADTC administration was notified of the alleged dangerous condition and was given an\nopportunity to remedy the situation.  Despite their apparent lack of authority to change\ntransportation procedures the ADTC administration has an obligation to protect its inmates and\ncould have worked with the DOC to devise a solution.\nAdditionally, upon hearing that ADTC could not remedy the situation, Mr. Riley wrote to\nDefendant, Mr. Plantier, Director of Operations for the DOC.  Mr. Riley has not received any\nresponse to that letter.\nFor this court to dismiss the complaint and require each Plaintiff to file an ARF so that\neach of them may receive the same response, or non-response, that Mr. Krivacska and Mr. Riley\nreceived before allowing them to continue with the present suit would be nothing more than a\nwaste of time for everyone involved.  Plaintiffs attempted to resolve their concerns at the\nadministrative level and Defendants had sufficient opportunity to address the situation\nthemselves.  Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently exhausted their administrative remedies.  \nAdditionally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs claims are barred as a matter of law\nbecause a § 1983 claim cannot be premised upon a theory of respondeat superior liability.  They\ncontend that Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants Brown and Plantier had actual knowledge\nof the alleged violations.  This issue was thoroughly discussed in the March 16, 2006 opinion. \nAs such, it need not be discussed at length here. \nIn general, Plaintiffs satisfied their burden for proving a supervisor-centered claim by\nshowing that numerous prison officials had actual knowledge of the unreasonable risk created by\nthe DOC’s policies and practices.  Riley v. Brown, No. 06-331, slip op. at 12-15 (D.N.J. Mar. 16,\n18\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 19 of 29 PageID: 1914\n2006).\nFinally, Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs claims seeking damages against the State\nDefendants in their official capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment”  (Defs.’ Br. in\nOpp. to the Mot. for a second prelim. inj. at 20).  As Plaintiffs’ complaint makes no demand for\ndamages, that argument is moot.  \n2.  Likelihood of suffering irreparable injury\nPlaintiffs’ original motion for a preliminary injunction was granted because the evidence\nof assaults on Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Braun, and Mr Becka; along with Plaintiffs’ allegations that\nADTC inmates are targeted by other inmates because of their status as sex offenders and because\nthe allegation that they are being placed in holding cells with other inmates such that prison\nguards cannot prevent potential assaults, established a likelihood that Plaintiffs would be\nassaulted again if an injunction was not issued, and because the likelihood of future assault posed\na significant obstacle to Plaintiffs’ ability to receive necessary medical care.  \nDefendants argue that the preliminary injunction should be terminated because the DOC\nhas policies and procedures in place to protect ADTC inmates and thus, they are not likely to\nsuffer irreparable injury.  Specifically, Defendants state that DOC policy requires the following: \n• Inmates are shackled during transport with leg irons, belly chains, and wrist shackles.\n• Inmates are under constant surveillance during transport and while in holding cells.\n• Officers do not identify inmates as being from a particular institution or announce to\nother inmates the origin of any other inmate.  \n• Wrist shackles and belly chains are removed when a prisoner is placed in a holding cell\n19\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 20 of 29 PageID: 1915\nbut leg irons are not removed.\n• When an altercation occurs between inmates in a holding cell the observing officer\nnotifies Central Control of a Code 33.  That officer is instructed to wait for backup until\nentering the cell to stop the fight.\n• Altercations between inmates are to be detailed in written reports that are submitted to the\nControl Supervisor before the staff leaves the institution at the end of the shift.  Those\nincidents are also referred to the Special Investigations Division (“SID”) for an immediate\ninquiry.  If the SID finds that an inmate threatened or assaulted another inmate, the former\ninmate is brought up on disciplinary charges.  \nBut despite the above policies, ADTC inmates have been assaulted on transport vehicles and in\nholding cells.  Additionally, many allege that they have been threatened with physical violence\nand are afraid to seek medical treatment because of the risk involved in seeking such treatment.  \n  The DOC’s policy of shackling inmates and supervising them during transportation is\nineffective because, according to several inmates’ statements, ADTC inmates are often seated\nnext to or directly in front of other state inmates.  Thus placing them in such close proximity that\nthe shackles can not prevent the other inmates from grabbing or hitting the ADTC inmates. \nMoreover, several ADTC inmates have stated that DOC officers sit in the front of the vehicle\nwith their backs to the prisoners and are unaware or uninterested in what transpires behind them.\nAs to the DOC’s policy against identifying the facility in which an inmate is housed,\nnearly all of the inmates who submitted affidavits in this case state that other state inmates\nlearned of their origin one way or another.  Thus, the DOC policy of concealing inmates’ origins\n20\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 21 of 29 PageID: 1916\nfails to prevent other inmates from learning the identity of ADTC inmates.\nWith regard to the policies relating to inmates’ confinement in holding cells: leg shackles\nare not enough to keep one inmate from attacking another; a prison guard’s presence outside of a\nholding cell cannot stop fights between inmates until a substantial amount of time has passed;\nand, the reporting process, while important, is not enough to prevent some inmates from\nattacking others.\nFor the above reasons, the DOC’s policies do not sufficiently protect ADTC inmates from\nother state inmates.\nDefendants also argue that the court’s reliance on Boone v. Brown, No. 05-750, 2005\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 18131 (D.N.J. Aug. 22, 2005), Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678 (U.S. 1978),\nGates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974), and Helling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (U.S.\n1993) is misplaced as those cases all involved conditions in which the harm to the various\nplaintiffs was virtually certain, unlike the present case, in which, Defendants contend, it is\nextremely unlikely that Plaintiffs will suffer any harm because 99.83% of prison transports are\nconducted without incident.  But as discussed above, Defendants success rate is deceiving as it\noverstates the number of transports that are relevant to the present case and possibly understates\nthe number of incidents in the last two years.\nMoreover, given the assaults on Mr. Cornwell, Mr. Becka, and Mr. Braun, and the violent\nthreats received by several other inmates, along with the animosity that other state inmates have\ndisplayed toward ADTC inmates, and the close proximity in which those inmates are placed on\ntransport vehicles and in holding cells, future attacks are virtually certain.  And as discussed in\n21\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 22 of 29 PageID: 1917\nthe March 16, 2006 opinion, the risk of suffering such an attack effectively denies ADTC\ninmates their right to medical treatment.\nTherefore, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of suffering irreparable injury.\n3.  Harm imposed on Defendants\nGenerally, an injunction should not be issued if it will harm the non-moving party more\nthan the moving party would be harmed if relief was denied.  Defendants contend that the\ninjunction imposes substantial hardship on them.  However, they fail explain how they are\nburdened or why it is difficult for them to comply with the injunction.  In fact, Defendants’\nreason for opposing several of the provisions in the preliminary injunction are that they already\nhave policies in place that require them to do exactly what the injunction demands of them.  To\nthe extent that the injunction merely requires Defendants to comply with their own policies, it\ndoes not impose a substantial burden on them.  To the extent that the preliminary injunction\nimposes additional requirements on Defendants, those requirements are minimal.  \nAn example is provision i of the preliminary injunction, which provides that Defendants\nand all those operating under their direction and control are ordered that when Avenel inmates\nare held or transported with inmates from other correctional institutions they shall not be\nidentified as inmates of Avenel.  Defendants contend that “ADTC inmates are not identified . . .\nby DOC officers during transports.”  (Defs.’ Br. in supp. of mot. to dissolve at 22) (emphasis in\noriginal).  Thus, to the extent that the preliminary injunction prohibits Defendants and all of\nthose under their direction and control from revealing Avenel inmates origin, Defendants argue\nthat the preliminary injunction is unnecessary.  Such an argument does not explain why the\n22\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 23 of 29 PageID: 1918\ninjunction poses a substantial burden on Defendants.  \nDefendants also argue that they cannot prevent court officials, or the Avenel inmates\nthemselves, from exposing Avenel inmates’ origins.  Thus, they argue, the injunction is too\nbroad.  To the extent, if any, that the injunction requires Defendants to prevent Avenel inmates\nand court officials from revealing the Avenel inmates’ origins, or to the extent, if any, that the\npreliminary injunction requires Defendants to prevent other inmates from deciphering an Avenel\ninmates’ origin through incidental information, such as seeing an inmate picked up from the\nADTC, the injunction will be modified such that it only enjoins Defendants and those under their\ndirection and control from expressly announcing that an inmate is from Avenel.\nAs to provision ii of the preliminary injunction, Defendants are enjoined from confining\ninmates from other correctional institutions in a vehicle or holding area such that they have\nphysical access to Avenel inmates unless a guard is present who is able to prevent the Avenel\ninmates from being subjected to violence from other inmates.  Defendants argue that their\ninternal policies require officers to be present and supervise all inmates during transport and\nwhile in holding cells.  They further state that there is no evidence that the DOC has failed to\nhave an officer present in those circumstances.  \nAs to this provision, the injunction requires Defendants to do more than what their policy\ndictates.  The injunction not only requires Defendants to have an officer present, it requires that\nthe officer be able to prevent Avenel inmates from being subjected to violence from other\ninmates.  From the evidence submitted since the injunction was issued, and based on Defendants’\ndescription of their policy of announcing a Code 33 when an altercation between inmates in a\nholding cell ensues, and due to the fact that the Code 33 response to the attack on Mr. Cornwell\n23\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 24 of 29 PageID: 1919\nallowed approximately 12 minutes to pass before the attack was quelled, it is clear that\nDefendants’ current policy does not satisfy the requirements in the injunction because the\nsupervising officer is not able to prevent violence against Avenel inmates until the adequate\nbackup has arrived.  Requiring the supervising officer to go into the holding cell before backup\narrives would no doubt endanger the supervising officer.  On the other hand, requiring\nDefendants to post a group of officers outside of a holding cell, so they can immediately respond\nto a fight in the event that one should occur, would be terribly inefficient.  Thus, the only\nreasonable alternative that can effectively prevent violence against ADTC inmates is to hold\nthem in separate cells.  Defendants have provided no explanation as to why such a requirement is\nunduly burdensome.  \nAs this provision relates to the transport of prisoners, Defendants have not explained why\nADTC inmates cannot be seated apart from other inmates such that they are not next to or\ndirectly in front of other inmates.  \nThus, the preliminary injunction will be modified to require Defendants to confine ADTC\ninmates in separate holding cells and seat them such that they are out of reach of other inmates\nduring transport.  Such requirements will not only ensure the inmates’ safety, it will reduce the\nlikelihood of fights between inmates and thereby protect the officers who are responsible for\nbreaking up those fights.\nAs to provision iii of the preliminary injunction, Defendants are required to halt all verbal\nand physical assaults upon ADTC inmates.  Defendants once again argue that they already have\npolicies and procedures in place that make this provision unnecessary.  If that is the case, it does\nnot impose any undue burden upon Defendants.  As discussed above, the DOC policy of\n24\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 25 of 29 PageID: 1920\nresponding to inmate altercations by calling a Code 33 is an inadequate response to inmate\naltercations that occur in holding cells.  Holding ADTC inmates in separate cells is necessary to\nreduce the risk of such altercations.\nAs applied to inmate transport, and as discussed above, the injunction will be modified\nsuch that ADTC inmates are separated from other inmates on the transport vehicles.  DOC\nofficers will be required to enforce that separation in order to ensure that other inmates do not\nmove next to ADTC inmates such that they can harass and/or assault them.  Such a policy should\nprevent altercations and ultimately protect DOC officers as well as inmates.\nProvision iv of the preliminary injunction requires prison authorities to investigate and\npromptly report any violence committed against Avenel inmates.  Defendants state that they\nalready have a policy requiring such incidents to be reported and investigated.  Thus, that\nprovision of the preliminary injunction does not impose any significant burden on Defendants as\nit merely requires them to comply with their own procedures.\nAs discussed above, most of the requirements imposed by the preliminary injunction\nimpose very little, if any, burden on Defendants.  To the extent that provision i creates a\nrequirement beyond Defendants’ control, it will be modified.  To the extent that provisions ii and\niii are ineffective or place prison guards at greater risk, they will be modified.\n4.  Public interest\nAs the preliminary injunction will protect ADTC inmates from cruel and unusual\npunishment while requiring very little from the DOC, it is in the public’s best interest to impose\nthe injunction. \n25\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 26 of 29 PageID: 1921\nRequirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act\nUnder the PLRA, a “court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief unless the\ncourt finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the\nviolation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of\nthe Federal right.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).6  Moreover, “[t]he court shall give substantial\nweight to any adverse impact on public safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused\nby the relief.”  18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A).\n1.  Whether the injunction is narrowly drawn and extends no further than necessary\nDefendants argue that the preliminary injunction is overly broad because it grants relief\nnot only to Plaintiffs but to the entire class of ADTC inmates, and does so even though those\ninmates have not been certified as a class.  Such extensive relief, Defendants contend, is not\njustified by the record.  But although the ADTC inmates have not been certified as a class, it is\nclear that the past harms and threat of future harms extend to all ADTC inmates, not just those\nnamed as Plaintiffs in this case.  The record shows that other state inmates harass, threaten, and\nassault ADTC inmates without hindrance.  They are not targeting specific ADTC inmates. \nRather, they are targeting whichever ADTC inmates they happen to meet, solely because of their\nstatus as ADTC inmates.  Thus, the preliminary injunction is not overly broad because it applies\nto a particular group of inmates who are likely to be targeted by other state inmates and it does\nnot apply to any inmates that are unlikely to be targeted.\nMoreover, the preliminary injunction only applies to those situations that have proven to\n6 Prospective relief is defined as “all relief other than compensatory monetary damages”\nand thus includes injunctive relief.  18 U.S.C. § 3626(g)(7).\n26\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 27 of 29 PageID: 1922\npose a substantial risk to ADTC inmates’ safety, i.e., the injunction only requires additional\nsafeguards with respect to the manner in which ADTC inmates are transported and confined in\nholding cells.  It does not interfere with the method by which inmates are escorted from holding\ncells to the infirmary, the way in which they are seated and supervised in a reception area while\nthey await medical treatment, nor the method by which they are strip-searched.  There is no\nevidence that those procedures place inmates at risk, thus they are unaffected by the preliminary\ninjunction.  As such, the preliminary injunction is narrowly drawn and extends no further than\nnecessary because it only applies to those inmates that are being targeted and only affects the\nprocedures that have placed them in danger.\n2.  Whether the injunction is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation  \nThere can hardly be a less intrusive imposition than an order that requires an entity to\ncomply with its own policies and procedures.  As discussed above, provisions i and iv of the\npreliminary injunction require Defendants to do nothing more than enforce their own policies.  \nAs to provisions ii and iii of the preliminary injunction, also discussed above, the March\n16, 2006 order requires that ADTC inmates be confined such that a supervising officer is able to\nquell any assault that may take place, and directed those officers to do so in the event that an\ninmate is attacked.  Those provisions were intended to direct Defendants to be vigilant in their\nefforts to protect inmates from harm, without requiring Defendants to make any significant\nchanges to their existing policies and procedures.  However, based on Defendants’ description of\ntheir Code 33 procedure and the risk that prison guards face when they enter a holding cell to\nquell an altercation between inmates, those provisions cannot effectively protect ADTC inmates\nwithout placing prison guards in greater danger.  Thus, the least intrusive way to correct the\n27\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 28 of 29 PageID: 1923\nviolations in this case is to require that ADTC inmates be confined in separate holding cells and\nseated away from other inmates during transport.  Such a requirement should limit the number of\naltercations between inmates and thereby reduce the risk to prison officials as well.  \nAs Defendants have offered no less intrusive method, and have not argued that such a\nrequirement would unduly burden them, a new preliminary injunction requiring that ADTC\ninmates be segregated during transport and confined in separate holding cells, will be issued.\nAdverse impact on public safety or the operation of the criminal justice system\nThe preliminary injunction will not have any impact on public safety.  As discussed\nabove, it has only minimal impact on the operation of the criminal justice system.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, Plaintiffs’ motion for a second preliminary injunction is\ngranted.  Plaintiffs’ motion to postpone the stay of the original preliminary injunction is\ndismissed as moot.  Defendants’ motion to dissolve the original preliminary injunction is\ndismissed as moot.  Defendants’ motion to seal various confidential documents will be addressed\nin a separate opinion.\nMoreover, Defendants, Devon Brown and William Plantier and all those operating under\ntheir direction and control will be preliminarily enjoined, directed and ordered as follows:\n1. When inmates are removed from ADTC and held or transported with inmates from other\ncorrectional institutions: i) Defendants and all those under their direction and control\nshall not identify ADTC inmates as ADTC inmates; ii) inmates from other correctional\ninstitutions shall be seated out of reach from ADTC inmates on transport vehicles and\n28\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 30    Filed 06/21/06   Page 29 of 29 PageID: 1924\nDOC officers will enforce the separation between them; iii) ADTC inmates will be held\nin separate holding cells from other state inmates; iv) guards and other prison officials\nshall be directed to halt forthwith any verbal or physical assaults made by inmates upon\nADTC inmates; v) prison authorities shall investigate and promptly report upon any\nviolence committed against any ADTC inmates;\n2. Defendants and Plaintiffs may apply to the Court for any modification of the\naccompanying order that may be necessary to accommodate prison administration or may\nbe necessary to effectuate its purpose of protecting Avenel inmates from physical and\nother abuse.\n3. A ruling on Plaintiffs’ applications for class designation and appointment of an attorney\nwill be deferred until it can be determined whether full relief can be effected through\nimplementation of the accompanying order.\n/s/ Dickinson R.

Plaintiffs, all\nstate  inmates  currently  housed  in  the  Adult  Diagnostic  and\nTreatment  Center  (“ADTC”),  seek  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order\nrequiring the New Jersey Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to: 1)\nkeep all “ADTC inmates” segregated from state inmates of other\ninstitutions at all times during trips to and from the ADTC; 2)\nhave a Corrections Officer present at all times when segregation is\nnot possible; 3) institute policies and procedures directing DOC\nstaff not to identify “ADTC inmates” as such; 4) provide “ADTC\ninmates” with clothing that does not identify them as such; and 5)\ninstitute  polices and procedures providing for \"keep separate\"\nstatus for “ADTC inmates,” isolating them from state inmates of\nother institutions.  There is no merit to plaintiffs’ claims for\ninjunctive relief.\nThe State  Defendants oppose plaintiffs’ Application for a\nTemporary  Restraining  Order  because  plaintiffs  have  failed  to\nprove:  (1) a reasonable probability of success on the merits; (2)\nthey will suffer irreparable harm;(3)that the balance of hardships\nweighs  in  favor  of  granting  the  relief;  or  (4)the  preliminary\nrelief will be in the public interest. \n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 6 of 26 PageID: 184\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY AND COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS1\nPlaintiffs,  George  Riley,  133229B,  James  J.

The Motion for Temporary Restraining\nOrder and Complaint were sent ex parte to the court.  However, the\ncourt has permitted the Office of the Attorney General to file an\nopposition  to  plaintiffs’  motion  by  February  17,  2006.\nAccordingly,  this  letter  brief  is  submitted  to  the  court.\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Complaint\nwere served on State Defendants by Waiver of Service on February 9,\n2006.  Therefore, State Defendants Answer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint\nis due on April 10, 2006.\nPlaintiffs, state inmates housed at the Adult Diagnostic and\nTreatment Center (“ADTC”), allege the State Defendants imposed\ncruel  and  usual  punishment  on  the    plaintiffs,  by  subjecting\nplaintiffs to serious physical injury, or threat of injury, which\n1The Procedural History and Counter-Statement of Facts have\nbeen combined for the convenience of the Court as they are\ninextricably intertwined.\n2\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 7 of 26 PageID: 185\nin  turn,  has  allegedly  interfered  with  plaintiffs’  right  to\nnecessary medical treatment.  (Plaintiffs’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN\nSUPPORT OF TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\n(“Memo of Law”), 1).  \nSpecifically,  plaintiffs  allege  the  State  Defendants  have\nfailed to protect plaintiffs from other state inmates, which they\ncome in contact with during medical, court, and other trips outside\nof the ADTC facility.  (Id. at 2).  Plaintiffs state that these\nother state inmates  harbor particular enmity toward plaintiffs\nbecause the plaintiffs have been convicted of sexual offenses and\ntherefore,  these other inmates seek to cause plaintiffs physical\nand  psychological  harm  in  the  absence  of  protection  by  DOC\nofficers.  (Id.)  \nPlaintiffs  assert  that  the  alleged  failure  of  the  State\nDefendants  to  protect  plaintiffs  from  other  state  inmates  has\nresulted in plaintiffs fear of being seriously injured by other\nstate inmates during trips outside the ADTC. (Id.)  Plaintiffs\nclaim that due to their fears, they have voluntarily forgone needed\nmedical  treatment2  and  necessary  court  appearances,  which  has\nallegedly placed them at risk of suffering serious medical problems\n2State Defendants note at the outset that although\nplaintiffs allege they forgo necessary medical trips outside the\nADTC, medical care is provided within the ADTC facility, and\nmedical transports are only for that care which, above and beyond\nthe basic medical care provided at the ADTC.  Therefore,\nplaintiffs are not entirely without medical care when they\nvoluntarily refuse to go on medical trips outside the ADTC.\n3\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 8 of 26 PageID: 186\nand sacrificing significant property and/or liberty interest.

Krivacska\nPlaintiff James Krivacska, currently housed at the ADTC, is\nserving a sixteen-year sentence for one count of aggravated sexual\nassault  in  the  first  degree,  two  counts  of  aggravated  sexual\nassault in the third degree, and two counts of endangering the\nwelfare of a child.  (New Jersey Department of Corrections Inmate\nLocator, https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I).  \nPlaintiff Krivacska alleges that in August of 2002, he was\ntransported for a court proceeding and throughout that trip he was\nallegedly  subjected  to  verbal  abuse  and  threats  of  physical\nassault, by another state inmate, due to Krivacska’s status as a\nconvicted  sex  offender.    (Plaintiffs’  Memo  of  Law,  at  7).\nPlaintiff Krivacska also alleges that on May 31, 2005, he was\nscheduled for a medical trip to have a tooth extracted.  (Id.).\nKrivacska went on his medical trip, coming into contact with state\ninmates housed at other institutions, and allegedly suffered some\nverbal abuse on the morning trip.  (Id. at 8-9).  Krivacska was not\nthreatened or physically assaulted on this trip.  (Id. at 9).\nDespite the safe medical trip on May 31, 2005, Krivacska, allegedly\nstill fearful, claims to have delayed the extraction of a broken\ntooth for six months until an oral surgeon visiting the ADTC could\nperform the procedure.  (Id.).  Plaintiff Krivacska has a court\n4\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 9 of 26 PageID: 187\nappearance scheduled for February 17, 2006, which he allegedly\nintends to waive his right to appear due to his alleged fear of\nphysical assault or injury at the hands of other state inmates\nduring the trip.

Facts Specific to Plaintiff Richard Gibbs\nPlaintiff Richard Gibbs, currently housed at the ADTC, is\nserving  a  twenty-five  year  sentence  for  two  counts  of  sexual\nassault on a victim under thirteen years of age, four counts of\nendangering the welfare of a child in the second degree, and one\ncount of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree.  (New\nJersey  Department  of  Corrections  Inmate  Locator,  https://\nwww6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I).\nPlaintiff Gibbs alleges only that he had a court appearance\nscheduled for January 30, 2006 and he was allegedly fearful of\nbeing assaulted during that trip and waived his right to appear.\n(Plaintiffs’ Memo of Law, at 12-13).\nC. Facts Specific to Plaintiff George Riley\nPlaintiff  George  Riley,  currently  housed  at  the  ADTC,  is\nserving thirteen years for one count of rape and carnal abuse, one\ncount of endangering the welfare of a child, and one count of\ncriminal  attempt  to  commit  a  sexual  offense.    (New  Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections Inmate Locator, https://www6.state.nj.us/\nDOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I).  \n5\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 10 of 26 PageID: 188\nPlaintiff Riley alleges only that he has an Appeal before the\nAppellate Division and that if his case is remanded, he will be\nrequired to be transported to and from court.  (Plaintiffs’ Memo of\nLaw, at 14).  Riley is allegedly fearful of physical injury or\nassault during these potential court trips.  (Id.)\nD. Facts Specific to Plaintiff Peter Braun\nPlaintiff  Peter  Braun,  currently  housed  at  the  ADTC,  is\nserving eight years for one count of sexual assault on a victim\nunder thirteen years of age, one count of endangering the welfare\nof a child by selling/viewing child pornography, and one count of\nendangering the welfare of a child in the second degree.  (New\nJersey  Department  of  Corrections  Inmate  Locator,  https://\nwww6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I).\nPlaintiff  Braun  alleges  that  he  must  attend  compliance\nconferences in Union County Family Court.  (Plaintiffs’ Memo of\nLaw, at 15).  Braun alleges that on December 13, 2005, during a\ntrip  to  one  of  these  conferences,  he  was  subjected  to  verbal\nharassment and threats by other state inmates, who also allegedly\ntouched Braun’s person searching for jewelry.  (Id. at 16).  Braun\nclaims  he  suffered  psychological  trauma  as  a  result  of  this\nincident and that he is allegedly fearful of abuse during his next\ntrip to court.  (Id. at 17).  Finally, Braun alleges that the state\ninmates  knew  he  was  a  convicted  sexual  offender  because  the\ncorrections officers told them.

Facts Specific to Plaintiff Vincent Macrina\nPlaintiff Vicent Macrina, currently housed at the ADTC, is\nserving eleven years for one count of aggravated sexual assault, in\nthe  first  degree,  on  a  victim  under  thirteen.    (New  Jersey\nDepartment of Corrections Inmate Locator, https://www6.state.nj.us/\nDOC_Inmate/inmatefinder?i=I).\nPlaintiff Macrina alleges that due to his medical condition,\nhe must make frequent medical trips to New Jersey State Prison and\nSt. Francis Hospital.  (Plaintiff’s Memo of Law, at 18).  Plaintiff\nMacrina  alleges  that  he  is  fearful  of  being  assaulted  and\ntherefore, allegedly refuses his medical trips.  (Id.).\nF. Facts Specific to Plaintiff William Vansciver\nPlaintiff William Vansciver, currently housed at the ADTC, is\nserving eighteen years for two counts of aggravated sexual assault\non a victim under thirteen. (New Jersey Department of Corrections\nInmate  Locator,  https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/\ninmatefinder?i=I).\nPlaintiff Vansciver alleges that due to his medical condition,\nhe is in need of frequent medical trips.  (Plaintiffs’ Memo of Law,\nat 19).  However, Vansciver is allegedly fearful of injury or\nassault  on  these  medical  trips  and  therefore,  has  allegedly\nforegone necessary medical trips.  (Id.).\n7\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 12 of 26 PageID: 190\nG. Facts Specific to Plaintiff Paul Cornwell\nPlaintiff Paul Cornwell, currently housed at ADTC, is serving\nfive  years,  one  month  and  eight  days  for  one  count  of  sexual\nassault  in  the  second  degree.    (New  Jersey  Department  of\nCorrections Inmate Locator, https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/\ninmatefinder?i=I).  \nPlaintiff  Cornwell  alleges  that  during  his  return  from  a\nmedical trip on May 24, 2005, he was injured by another state\ninmate while being held in a holding area at Garden State Prison.\n(Plaintiffs’ Memo of Law, 5).  Cornwell alleges that he was placed\nin the holding cell with another state inmate from ADTC and that\nwhile his wrist shackles were being removed, one of the Corrections\nofficers announced that they were from “Avenel”, which is allegedly\nunderstood to mean the ADTC facility.  (Id.).  Cornwell further\nalleges that the Corrections officers left his leg shackles on,\nstating  it  would  make  a  “fair  fight.”    (Id.).    Then  Cornwell\nalleges that the officers left the holding area and watched from a\nplexiglass partition as he was physically assaulted by another\nstate  inmate.  (Id.).  Cornwell  allegedly  suffered  injuries  and\npsychological trauma as a result of the assault.  (Id. at 6).  \nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining Order\nPlaintiffs filed an Order to Show Cause seeking a Temporary\nRestraining Order compelling the DOC to: 1) keep all “ADTC inmates”\nsegregated from State inmates of other institutions at all times\n8\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 13 of 26 PageID: 191\nduring trips to and from the ADTC; 2) have a Corrections Officer\npresent at all times when segregation is not possible; 3) institute\npolicies and procedures directing DOC staff not to identify “ADTC\ninmates” as such; 4) provide “ADTC inmates” with clothing that does\nnot identify them as such; and 5) institute polices and procedures\nproviding for \"keep separate\" status for “ADTC inmates,” isolating\nthem from State inmates of other institutions. (Plaintiffs’ MOTION\nFOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER).  This office opposes plaintiffs’\napplication for a Temporary Restraining Order because plaintiffs’\nhave  failed  to  establish  the  elements  necessary  to  impose\npreliminary restraints on the State Defendants.\n9\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 14 of 26 PageID: 192\nLEGAL ARGUMENT\nPLAINTIFFS  HAVE  FAILED  TO  ESTABLISH  THE\nELEMENTS  NECESSARY  TO  IMPOSE  PRELIMINARY\nRESTRAINTS UPON THE STATE DEFENDANTS.        \nPlaintiffs have failed to satisfy their burden of proof as to\nthe  standards  governing  applications  for  preliminary  relief.\nPlaintiffs  have  failed  to  prove  irreparable  harm,  have  no\nprobability of success on the merits, and will suffer no hardship\nin the absence of relief.\nInjunctive relief is an extraordinary equitable remedy which\nshould be granted in limited circumstances.  Frank's GMC Truck Ctr.\nInc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., 847 F.2d 100, 102 (3d Cir. 1988)(citing\nUnited States v. City of Philadelphia, 644 F.2d 187, 191 n. 1 (3d\nCir.  1980)).    Four  factors  govern  a  district  court's  decision\nwhether to issue a preliminary injunction: \n(1) whether the movant has shown a reasonable\nprobability of success on the merits; \n(2)  whether  the  movant  will  be  irreparably\ninjured by denial of the relief; \n(3) whether granting preliminary relief will\nresult in even greater harm to the nonmoving\nparty; and \n(4) whether granting the preliminary relief\nwill be in the public interest.\nGerardi v. Pelullo, 16 F.3d 1363, 1373 (3d Cir. 1994), quoting SI\nHandling Systems, Inc. v. Heisley, 753 F.2d 1244, 1254 (3d Cir.\n1985).  “An injunction should issue only if the plaintiff produces\nevidence sufficient to convince the court that all four factors\n10\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 15 of 26 PageID: 193\nfavor preliminary relief.”  E.B. v. Poritz, 914 F. Supp. 85, 90\n(D.N.J. 1996), rev'd on other grounds, 119 F.3d 1077 (3d Cir. 1997)\n(citing Opticians Ass'n of Amer. v. Independent Opticians of Amer.,\n920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).\nAs set forth more fully below, plaintiffs cannot satisfy their\nburden  of  proof  as  to  each  of  these  required  elements.    In\nparticular,  plaintiffs  have  not  shown  that:  (1)  a  reasonable\nprobability  of  success  on  the  merits;  (2)  they  will  suffer\nirreparable harm;(3)that the balance of hardships weighs in favor\nof granting the relief; or (4)the preliminary relief will be in the\npublic  interest.    Therefore,  plaintiffs  Motion  for  Temporary\nRestraining Order should be denied.\n1. It is Not Probable that Plaintiffs will Succeed on\nthe Merits.                                       \nPlaintiffs have not made a preliminary showing of a likelihood\nof success on the merits as they have brought a claim for that\nwhich  they  are  not  entitled;  namely,  complete  isolation  and\nsegregation from the rest of the inmate population not housed in\nthe ADTC. \nTo prevail on an application for temporary relief,\"the party\nseeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate a ‘reasonable\nprobability of eventual success in the litigation.’\" LCN Enters. v.\nCity  of  Asbury  Park,  197  F.  Supp.  2d  141,  145  (D.N.J.  2002)\n(quoting  Kershner  v.  Mazurkiewicz,  670  F.2d  440,  443  (3d  Cir.\n1982)).  The party seeking relief must \"make a prima facie case\n11\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 16 of 26 PageID: 194\nshowing a reasonable probability that [they] will prevail on the\nmerits.\" LCN Enters., 197 F. Supp. 2d at 145 (quoting Oburn v.\nShapp, 521 F.2d 142, 148 (3d Cir. 1975)).\nPlaintiffs fail to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted  because  plaintiffs  assert  that  they  are  entitled  to\ncomplete  segregation  from  the  rest  of  the  entire  state  inmate\npopulation by virtue of the fact that they have been housed at the\nADTC.  However, plaintiffs are not entitled to such segregation, as\neven the Legislature has recognized that state inmates convicted of\nsexual offenses may be housed in state institutions other than the\nADTC.\nPursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h), a state inmate, convicted of\na sexual offense, is housed in either the Adult Diagnostic and\nTreatment Center or another DOC facility based on the length of his\nsentence.  If the court sentenced a sex offender/inmate to a term\nof seven years or less, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h)(1), the\ninmate  shall  be  initially  housed  in  the  ADTC,  as  soon  as\npractically possible.  However, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h)(2),\nif the inmate was sentenced to greater than a seven-year term, the\nADTC eligible defendant must initially be placed in a traditional\nstate correctional facility designated by the commissioner pursuant\nto N.J.S.A. 30:4-91.2.  Once the commissioner has placed the inmate\nin the designated facility, the commissioner must then calculate\nthe expiration date of the inmate’s sentence, including reductions\n12\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 17 of 26 PageID: 195\nfor any credits.  N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h)(2).  When the inmate is\nwithin five years of parole eligibility, the commissioner would\ntransfer the sex offender into the ADTC for the remainder of his\nsentence.  Id.\nTherefore,  the  Legislature  has  recognized  that  inmates\nconvicted of a sexual offense are not entitled to segregation from\nthe rest of the state inmate population and any such segregation\nwould fly in the face of N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h), which permits the\nState to house state inmates convicted of sexual offenses in the\nsame  institutions  as  those  state  inmates  convicted  of  other\ncriminal offenses.\nPlaintiffs attempt to create an imaginary distinction between\nthemselves and state inmates housed at other institutions.  In\nfact,  there  is  no  distinction.    They  are  all  state  inmates,\nconvicted of a criminal offense.  Inmates convicted of a sexual\noffense are not entitled to complete isolation and segregation from\nthe rest of the state inmates population.  N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h).  As\nstated above, even the Legislature has recognized that inmates\nconvicted of sexual offenses are not entitled to separate housing\nfrom those state inmates convicted of other criminal offenses, as\nthe DOC may place them in any other state institution until there\nis room at the ADTC.  N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h).\nAdditionally, state inmates have no liberty interest in which\nstate institution they are placed.  Trantino v. N.J. State Parole\n13\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 18 of 26 PageID: 196\nBd.,  296 N.J.

In sum,\nliberty  \"interests  will  be  generally  limited  to  freedom  from\nrestraint  which,  while  not  exceed  the  sentence  in  such  an\nunexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\nClause  of  its  own  force  nonetheless  imposes  atypical  and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.\"  Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484  (citations\nomitted).\nThose inmates convicted of a sexual offense  may be housed in\nan institution other than the ADTC, provided they are not within\nthe last five to seven years of their sentence, and have no right\n14\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 19 of 26 PageID: 197\nto segregation from the rest of the inmate population.  N.J.S.A.\n2C:47-3(h).  Therefore, they have no liberty interest in being\ncompletely  segregated  and  isolated  from  other  state  inmates.\nSandin, 515 U.S. at 484. \nAccordingly, the Court should deny plaintiffs’ request for\nTemporary Restraining Order.\n2. Plaintiffs Will Not Suffer Irreparable Injury in\nthe Absence of Preliminary Relief.                \nThe harm plaintiffs claim to be suffering, namely failing to\nattend medical appointments and court appearances, is a result of\ntheir own refusal to attend such appointments.  The Department of\nCorrections continues to make transports available to plaintiffs\nfor such appointments, yet plaintiffs allege that they voluntarily\nchoose to forgo necessary medical trips and court appearances.\nTherefore, plaintiffs are in control of the harm they are allegedly\nsuffering and such harm is not attributable to the DOC.\nPlaintiffs must make a \"clear showing of immediate irreparable\ninjury.\"  Continental Group, Inc. V. Amoco Chem. Corp., 614 F.2d\n351, 359 (3rd Cir. 1980).  \". . .injunctions will not be issued\nmerely  to  allay  the  fears  and  apprehensions  or  to  soothe  the\nanxieties of the parties.\"  Ibid.  \"Not even all irreparable harm,\nbut only irreparable harm to legal rights, should count.\"  Adams v.\nFreedom Forge Corporation,  204 F.3d 475, 489 (3rd Cir. 2000);\nquoting favorably John Luebsdorf, The Standard for Preliminary\nInjunctions, 91 Harv. L.Rev. 525, 541 (1978).  \n15\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 20 of 26 PageID: 198\nPlaintiffs  have  not  established  that  they  will  suffer\nirreparable  injury  if  the  Court  does  not  intervene  now.    The\nirreparable harm alleged by plaintiffs is entirely self-inflicted\nand  not  the  result  of  any  actions  or  inactions  of  the  State\nDefendants.  Plaintiffs alleged that due to their fear of being\ninjured or assaulted, they have and will continue choosing to forgo\nnecessary  medical  visits  and  court  appearances.    Of  the  seven\nplaintiffs, only one, Cornwell, alleges that he was physically\nassaulted, and just two, Krivacska and Braun, allege they were\nmerely subject to verbal harassment, allegedly at the hands of\nother state inmates during trips from the ADTC.  (Plaintiffs’ Memo\nof Law at 5-20).  The remaining four plaintiffs, Riley, Gibbs,\nMacrina  and  Vansciver,  allege  that  it  is  their  fear  of  being\nassaulted  that  keeps  them  from  medical  appointments  and  court\nappearances.  (Id.).\nIt  is  never  sufficient  to  merely  allege  in  a  conclusory\nfashion, as plaintiffs have, that they will suffer immediate and\nirreparable harm in the absence of restraints.  \n“Establishing a risk of irreparable harm is not enough. A\nplaintiff has the burden of proving a ‘clear showing of immediate\nirreparable injury.’”  Ecri v. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 809 F.2d 223, 226\n(3rd Cir. 1987) (quoting Continental Group, Inc. v. Amoco Chem.\nCorp.,  614  F.2d  351,  359  (3d  Cir.  1980).    The  applicant  must\npresent  specific  facts  establishing  that  irreparable  harm  is\n16\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 21 of 26 PageID: 199\nvirtually certain without restraints and not merely just a risk\nthereof.  Smith v. Travelers Mortgage Services, 699 F.Supp. 1080,\n1084 (D.N.J. 1988).  Plaintiffs have failed to make a showing that\nirreparable harm is “virtually certain,” especially since four of\nthe plaintiffs have never been so much as verbally harassed on a\ntrip outside the ADTC and their allegations that they are fearful\nof injury or physical attack at the hands of other state inmates\nduring such trips outside the ADTC are completely unfounded.\nAdditionally,  plaintiffs, Krivacska and Braun, who allege\nthey were harassed by other inmates, have failed to show that they\nwill suffer “virtually certain” irreparable harm as they alleged\nthey were merely harassed by other state inmates.  The allegation\nthat these plaintiffs were harassed by other state inmates, while\non trips outside the ADTC, does not support their alleged fear that\nthey will suffer injury or physical assault while on such trips.\nFurthermore,  plaintiff  Cornwell,  who  alleges  that  he  was\nphysically assaulted by another inmate, has failed to show harm\nwhich is irreparable.  Harm is not irreparable unless it results in\na material injury for which monetary damages are inadequate.  Board\nof Educ., Borough of Union Beach v. New Jersey Educ. Ass’n, 96 N.J.\nSuper. 371, 390-91 (Law Div. 1967), aff’d, 53 N.J. 29 (1968).\nPlaintiffs  have  made  no  allegations  nor  have  they  offered  any\nevidence that they will suffer any injuries for which pecuniary\ndamages are insufficient.  Specifically, plaintiff Cornwell alleges\n17\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 22 of 26 PageID: 200\na single assault as a result of the actions of a single officer,\nwhich would serve as the basis for a single  42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nfailure to protect claim, rather than a request for system wide\nchanges in the Department of Corrections Central Transportation\nsystem.   \nTherefore,  plaintiffs’  claim  of  injury  is  voluntarily\nwithdrawing  from  transports  to  medical  appointments  and  court\nappearances due to their unfounded fear of harassment by other\nstate inmates.  Plaintiffs have failed to identify any injuries,\nimaginary or real, monetary or otherwise, which are attributable to\nthe State Defendants. \nAccordingly, the Court should deny plaintiffs’ request for\nTemporary Restraining Order.\n3. The Hardship to Plaintiffs in the Absence of Relief\nDoes  Not  Outweigh  the  Hardship  to  the  State\nDefendants and the Public.                        \nThe balance of hardships favors the State Defendants, as there\nis no hardship to the plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs claimed hardship is\nthat  plaintiffs  will  allegedly  continue  to  voluntarily  forgo\nnecessary  medical  appointments  and  court  appearances,  which\nplaintiffs  allege  will  result  in  plaintiffs  suffering  serious\nmedical conditions and forfeiture of their claims, defenses and/or\narguments in pending court cases.  Again, as set forth in more\ndepth in Point 2, this harm plaintiffs claim to suffer is entirely\nself inflicted by plaintiffs voluntarily refusing to go on medical\n18\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 23 of 26 PageID: 201\nor court trips due to unfounded fears of injury or assault.  The\nnew Jersey Department of Corrections will continue to provide safe\ntransports for medical appointments and court appearances.  If\nplaintiffs  continue  to  voluntarily  refuse  to  take  part  in  the\ntransport, then they control whether they suffer injury.\nIn contrast, the hardship on the State Defendants is greater\nthan that of the alleged hardship placed on the plaintiffs by the\nplaintiffs themselves.\nWhile  prisoners  retain  constitutional  rights,  the  Supreme\nCourt has stated “these rights must be exercised with due regard\nfor the ‘inordinately difficult undertaking’ that is modern prison\nadministration.”  Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401, 407 (1989)\n(citing Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 85 (1987)).\nAcknowledging  the  expertise  of  [prison]\nofficials  and  that  the  judiciary  is  “ill\nequipped”  to  deal  with  the  difficult  and\ndelicate problems of prison management, this\nCourt has afforded considerable deference to\nthe  determinations  of  prison  administrators\nwho, in the interest of security, regulate the\nrelations between prisoners and the outside\nworld.\n[Thornburgh,  490  U.S.  at  407-08  (citing\nProcunier  v.  Martinez,  416  U.S.  396,  405\n(1974).]\nSuch deference is essential to prevent disorder in “the volatile\nprison environment . . . .”  Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 413. \nThe  Department  of  Corrections  has  established  Central\nTransportation, which has developed a safe and secure schedule for\n19\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 24 of 26 PageID: 202\nthe transportation of those inmates housed at the ADTC.  N.J.A.C.\n10A:3-9.3(j).  The transportation schedule developed by Central\nTransportation is not only for the safety of the inmates, but also\nfor the safety of the correctional staff, as well as the public,\nand is rationally related to its legitimate penological goal of\nmaintaining and improving the safe, secure, orderly, and efficient\nadministration of New Jersey state correctional facilities.  Farmer\nv.  Brennan,  511  U.S.  825,  832  (1994)(quotations  omitted)  (the\nEighth Amendment  requires prison officials to “take reasonable\nmeasure to guarantee the safety of inmates”); and Hudson v. Palmer,\n468 U.S. 517, 526-527 (1984) (“... prison administrators are to\ntake all necessary steps to ensure the safety of not only the\nprison  staffs and administrative personnel, but also visitors.\nThey  are  under  an  obligation  to  take  reasonable  measures  to\nguarantee the safety of the inmates themselves.”).\nTo grant the relief sought by plaintiffs would undermine the\ndiscretion of the Department of Corrections in the administration\nof  the  correctional  institutions  by  invalidating  the  current\nCentral Transportation system.  Additionally, granting plaintiffs’\nrelief would undue N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h).  As set forth more fully in\nPoint 1, the Legislature enacted N.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h) to alleviate\nsome of the overcrowding issues in the DOC by allowing the DOC to\nplace those convicted of sexual offenses in institutions other than\nthe ADTC.  Therefore, granting plaintiffs’ relief would render\n20\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 25 of 26 PageID: 203\nN.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h) useless and place the Department of Corrections\nback in the position in which is was prior to the enactment of\nN.J.S.A. 2C:47-3(h).  \nTherefore, the hardship to the DOC substantially outweighs any\nharassment that plaintiff may face as a result of their voluntarily\nforgoing medical appointments and court appearances.  Accordingly,\nthe Court should deny plaintiffs’ request for Temporary Restraining\nOrder.\n4. Plaintiffs’ Request for Preliminary Relief is Not\nin the Interest of the Public.                    \nThe  public  will  be  harmed  by  plaintiff’s  request  for\ninjunctive relief because it has a paramount interest in the safe,\nsecure, orderly, and efficient administration of the New Jersey\nstate prison system.  The transportation schedule of inmates housed\nat the ADTC to medical appointments and court appearances outside\nthe ADTC is not only for the safety of the inmates, but also for\nthe safety of the correctional staff, as well as the public.  To\ngrant the relief requested, the state will be required to provide\nadditionally transports to and from the ADTC, thus increase the\nrisks already associated with the transportation of state inmates.\n21\n\nCase 2:06-cv-00331-DRD -ES   Document 6    Filed 02/17/06   Page 26 of 26 PageID: 204\nCONCLUSION\nBased  upon  the  aforementioned,  this  office  respectfully\nsubmits  that  plaintiffs’  have  not  established  that  they  are\nentitled  to  the  preliminary  restraints  they  are  seeking  and\ntherefore, the court should deny plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary\nRestraining Order.\nRespectfully submitted, \nZULIMA V.
