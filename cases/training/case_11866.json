    "summary": "<p>On May 5, 2008, an association of residents of a New Jersey neighborhood filled a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The residents, represented by lawyers from South Jersey Legal Services, asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming that the defendants' redevelopment plan for the Gardens neighborhood represented a violation of the Fair Housing Act and of the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and New Jersey Constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' redevelopment plan, which called for the razing of the existing homes located in the Gardens neighborhood, the only one with predominantly African American and Hispanic residents, made housing unavailable because of race. Moreover, the plaintiffs claimed that the redevelopment plan had a disparate impact on African-American and Hispanic households in violation of the Fair Housing Act because it destroyed their homes without providing adequate relocation assistance. The township had displaced hundreds of predominantly African American and Hispanic residents and, the plaintiffs claimed, \"devastated a once stable minority community in need of only modest improvement.\" Only about 70 homes out of 300 remain scattered throughout the neighborhood and no new homes were constructed in 10 years. On July 18, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On October 28, 2008, the Court (Judge Noel Hillman) issued an order with respect to the defendants' motion to dismiss. Three of the allegations under state law related to local redevelopment and housing laws and open meetings laws were dismissed as moot. Two counts related to denial of just compensation under state law were dismissed as moot. In other respects, the motion was denied.</p>\r\n<p>On November 25, 2008, the Court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff's motion to file an amended complaint. The plaintiffs could not file allegations pertaining to denial of just compensation in light of the Court's opinion of October 28, 2008. On December 3, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint, which added more facts and allegations of violation of the Due Process clauses under the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions.</p>\r\n<p>On February 13, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. The injunction was sought with respect to disparate impact claim under the FHA, and the Court stated the plaintiffs did not show they were likely to succeed on the merits, and suffer and irreparable injury. Even if they lost housing, there was insufficient showing that monetary compensation would not be enough.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2009, the Court granted in part, denied in part, and continue in part the defendants' motion to dismiss. The motions with respect to claims under the FHA, EEOC, Equal Protection claim under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983, were treated as motions for summary judgment, and continued until later. The Court dismissed claims of Due Process violations under the U.S. and New Jersey constitutions, claims of discrimination under state laws, and claims of violations of local redevelopment and housing laws.</p>\r\n<p>On January 19, 2010, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On January 3, 2011, the district court (Judge Noel Hillman) granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Specifically, the district court found that the redevelopment plan of the Gardens neighborhood did not have a disparate impact on African Americans and Hispanics. The court found that the residents were unable to make a prima facie showing that the plan had a disparate impact on protected groups because they were unable to show that the plan had a greater adverse impact on protected groups than on others, and were unable to show that the township's legitimate interest in redevelopment could be accomplished with less discriminatory impact. Finally, the court held that the defendants had not acted with the discriminatory intent necessary to violate the United States Constitution.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs appealed the district court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In an opinion filed September 13, 2011 the court (Judges Sloviter, Fuentes, and Fisher) vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court made clear that at the summary judgment stage, the district court is to take the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Under that standard, the evidence submitted was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act. Specifically, the court held that the evidence presented by the residents that African American and Hispanic citizens were 8 times more likely to be affected by the redevelopment plan was sufficient to show a disparate impact. Furthermore, the appellate court made it clear that the district court had erred by asking whether the defendants had treated minorities the same as other residents, rather than asking whether minority residents were affected differently than the other residents. On May 22, 2012, the Third Circuit's mandate was entered.</p>\r\n<p>On June 11, 2012, the defendants filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United State Supreme Court, asking for review of the legal question whether disparate impact claims exist under the Fair Housing Act. This was an issue on which the Court had granted review in Magner v. Gallagher (Sup. Ct. Docket 10-1032), but then that case was withdrawn by its defendant, the City of St. Paul, after full briefing but before argument. The Court granted cert., and argument was scheduled for December 4, 2013. Observers expected the Court to strike down the disparate impact theory. Instead, on November 13, 2013, the case settled.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement--which news reports state was funded, in part, by an organization called The Reinvestment Fund--included provision for construction of 44 new homes, with the first to be ready for occupancy before the end of 2014. Twenty homes will go to current residents in exchange for allowing redevelopment of their existing homes. All of the phased new construction was to be completed by 2018. Seven households that have elected to relocate were to be compensated based in part on the appraised value of their homes. The aggregate amount that the township paid to them was $691,000.00</p>\r\n<p>On November 15, 2013, the Court entered the settlement agreement and dismissed the case and the proceedings with prejudice. However, on May 25, 2018, the defendants filed an emergency motion to show cause pertaining to whether some of the plaintiffs were still income-eligible for the newly-constructed housing. Within two weeks, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion to enforce the judgment, as some construction had not been completed. The court issued text orders requiring (1) the select plaintiffs complete applications for Housing Affordability Services indicating compliance with the settlement agreement and (2) the parties to take all reasonable means to complete construction.</p>\r\n<p>The court has since denied an individual plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees, finding that those were not covered by the settlement agreement. The case is otherwise dormant.</p>",

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This is a civil rights action challenging Mount Holly Township’s (―Township‖) wide-\nscale redevelopment of the neighborhood known as Mt. Holly Gardens (―Gardens‖).  Plaintiffs \nare an association of residents, Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc.,  (―CIA‖), and five \nindividual residents (―Residents‖) living in the Gardens, which is a cohesive, ethnically diverse \nneighborhood within Mt. Holly Township that is predominantly African-American and Hispanic \nwith  mostly  low  and  moderate  income  families.    CIA  and  Residents  are  challenging  the \nTownship’s  sweeping redevelopment  project  that  is  demolishing  existing  homes,  displacing \nnumerous families, and dismantling and destroying the entire Gardens neighborhood.            \n2.  The  Township  and  its  redevelopers  have  been  and  currently  are  aggressively \nimplementing their redevelopment project, ultimately seeking acquisition, through purchase and \neminent domain, and total demolition of all 329 homes within the Gardens redevelopment area \naffordable to current and displaced families and replacement with new, much higher-priced \nmarket  rate  homes  intended  for  households  that  are  more  affluent.    In  carrying  out \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 3 of 55 PageID: 3028\nredevelopment, the Township and its redevelopers have greatly increased blighted conditions and \nhave rendered the Gardens unsafe and unlivable.   Among other things, under the implied threat \nof eminent domain, the Township has systematically acquired, vacated and boarded up more \nthan 200 previously occupied homes—approximately two-thirds of all residential properties \nwithin the Gardens—and has demolished to date approximately 70 properties. If not stopped, the \nTownship and its redevelopers will succeed in irrevocably tearing down the most identifiable \nminority community within Mt. Holly – with the highest rates of African-American and Hispanic \nhomeownership within Burlington County – and permanently displacing hundreds of lower \nincome minority residents from their community where they will no longer be able to afford to \nlive.   \n3.  In  prior  state  court  litigation,  the  Township’s  finding  of  ―blight,‖  i.e.,  its \ndetermination that the Gardens neighborhood met New Jersey’s criteria for designation as an \n―area in need of redevelopment,‖ was upheld in April 2005.   However, in August 2005 and \nsubsequently upheld on appeal in 2007, CIA’s and Residents’ civil rights and other substantive \nchallenges to the redevelopment plan were dismissed without prejudice as then not being ripe for \nadjudication. \n4.   These claims are now unquestionably ripe in light of the Township’s subsequent \ndestructive implementation actions devastating the Gardens community, its adoption of a revised \nplan,  and  its  presentation  of  the Redevelopers’  proposed  general  development  plan  for the \nredeveloped  community.    Specifically,  the  Township  and  its  redevelopers  have  unlawfully \ndiscriminated against the Residents on the basis of race and national origin in violation of Title \nVIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1982; the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq.; and Equal \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 4 of 55 PageID: 3029\nProtection under the United States and New Jersey Constitutions.  Furthermore, the Township’s \nactions deprive Residents of just compensation by driving down the value of their homes, while \nthe Township has failed to adequately plan or prepare for replacement housing realistically \naffordable to current and displaced residents and failed to provide adequate relocation assistance \nthat would enable displaced residents to purchase replacement housing. \n5.  The Township has also acted arbitrarily, capriciously, unreasonably, ultra vires and \nunconstitutionally, by first making substantial de facto changes to the redevelopment plan in \nclosed meetings and then adopting an inadequate amended redevelopment plan, in violation of \nthe New Jersey Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq., as well as \nprocedural due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution and fundamental fairness protected under Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey \nConstitution.  The Township has additionally acted unconstitutionally in violation of the general \nwelfare  under  Article  I,  Paragraph  1,  of  the  New  Jersey  Constitution,  by  carrying  out \nredevelopment activities that will result in the destruction and substantial net loss of housing \naffordable to low and moderate income families, as well as the forcible displacement of hundreds \nof  low  and  moderate  income  residents  from  the  Gardens  community  without  providing \naffordable replacement housing.   \n6.  Residents  and  CIA  seek,  among  other  things,  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \ninvalidating the redevelopment plan; mandating that the Township carry out redevelopment in \nthe Gardens in a manner having the least discriminatory adverse impact upon African-American \nand Hispanic households; and prohibiting implementation without providing adequate affordable \nreplacement housing for all current and displaced Gardens residents.

(―Keating‖)  is  a  limited  liability \ncompany with offices located at One Liberty Place, New Brunswick, NJ 08901. \nDefendant Keating entered into a redevelopment agreement with the Township to \nimplement the WR Redevelopment Plan and has been actively engaged since that \ntime in project planning, development, and implementation.  \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 11 of 55 PageID: 3036\nb.  Defendant Triad Associates, Inc. (―Triad‖) is a corporation doing business in New \nJersey with offices at 238 West Chestnut Avenue, Vineland, NJ 08360, which the \nTownship  and/or  Keating  hired  to  assist  with  implementation  of  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan, including but not limited to serving as property manager of \nTownship-owned rental properties, preparing the Workable Relocation Assistance \nPlan (―WRAP‖) and conducting relocation activities.  \nIV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Mt. Holly Gardens Neighborhood  \n47.  Mt. Holly Gardens (―the Gardens‖) is situated on 30 acres of land within downtown \nMt. Holly Township in Burlington County, New Jersey.  \n48.  It is a cohesive, racially and ethnically diverse community.  \n49.  At the time the redevelopment process started in 2000, the neighborhood contained \n329 houses. \n50.  The houses were constructed during the 1950s.  \n51.  Houses are primarily two-story buildings of solid brick construction with joists \nmade of old-growth hardwood, and are situated in rows of 8 to 10 homes set back approximately \n50 feet from the street, allowing for front and back yards.  \n52.  Many  homes  are  well-maintained  and  have  attractively  landscaped  yards  and \ngardens.  \n53.  Until approximately March 2004 there was a playground area of approximately \n14,000 square feet and a community center converted from a dwelling unit, both which the \nTownship owned.  \n \n11 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 12 of 55 PageID: 3037\nB.  Residents of Mt. Holly Gardens  \n54. According  to  the  2000  U.S.  Census,  Burlington  County’s  total  population  was \n423,394.  Of  the  total  population,  Whites  comprised  323,171—76.3%;  African-Americans \ncomprised 62,476—14.8%; and Hispanics comprised 17,632—4.2%.  \n55.  According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Mount Holly Township’s total population was \n10,728. Of the total population, Whites comprised 7,101—66.2%; African-Americans comprised \n2,231 —20.8%; and Hispanics comprised 942 —8.8%.  \n56.  The  residential  section  of  the  Gardens  redevelopment  area  corresponds \napproximately to Blocks 1000, 1001, 1003 and 1009 of U.S. Census Tract 7026.04., Burlington \nCounty, New Jersey.  \n57.  Approximately 1,031 residents lived within  the Census Blocks corresponding to \nthe residential section of the Gardens redevelopment area. Within the residential section of the \nGardens  redevelopment  area,  Whites  comprised  approximately  203  residents—only  19.7%, \ncompared to 475—46.1% —African-American residents and 297—28.8%—Hispanic residents. \n58.  Thus,  African-American  and  Hispanic  residents  comprised  the  overwhelming \nmajority—nearly 75%—of the residents living in the Gardens redevelopment area. \n59.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the concentration of African-American \nand  Hispanic  residents  in  the  Gardens  was  the  highest  of  any  neighborhood  in  Mt.  Holly \nTownship and much higher compared to Burlington County, while the concentration of Whites \nwas comparatively much lower. \na.  46.1% of the Gardens redevelopment area was African-American, compared to \nonly 20.8% for Mt. Holly Township and 14.8 % for Burlington County. \n \n12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 13 of 55 PageID: 3038\nb.  28.8% of the Gardens redevelopment area was Hispanic, compared to only 8.8% \nfor Mt. Holly Township and only 4.2% for Burlington County. \nc.  Only  19.7%  of  the  Gardens  redevelopment  area  was  non-Hispanic,  White, \ncompared  to  66.2%  for  Mt.  Holly  Township  and  was  76.3%  for  Burlington \nCounty.    \nd.  In  addition,  approximately  31.5%  of  Mt.  Holly  Township’s  entire  Hispanic \npopulation and approximately 21,3% of Mt. Holly Township’s entire African-\nAmerican population lived within the Gardens redevelopment area, compared to \nonly 2.9% of the entire non-Hispanic, White population.   \n60.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the median household income in the \nGardens redevelopment area was only $30,104, while the median income for the Township was \n$43,284, and the median income of Burlington County was $58,608.  \n61.   According to the 2000 Census, in Census Tract 7026.04 containing the Gardens, the \nhousing characteristics were as follows: \na.  50% of the households in Census Tract 7026.04 were renters, and 50% were \nhomeowners.  \nb.  31% of the African-American households were homeowners while the percentage \nin the entire Township was 13%, and the percentage in the County was 11%.   \nc.  17% of the Hispanic households were homeowners while the percentage in the \nentire Township was 8%, and the percentage in the County was 2%.  \nd.  81% of the owner-occupied households in Census Tract 7026.4 had lived in their \nhomes for at least 9 years, while 72% of the renter-occupied households had lived \nin their homes for at least 5 years.  \n \n13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 14 of 55 PageID: 3039\ne.  The median cost of homeownership for owner-occupied homes with mortgages in \nCensus  Tract  7026.04  was  only  $969  a  month,  compared  to  $1,536  for  the \nTownship and $1,393 for the County.   \n62.   According to the 2000 Census, the Gardens neighborhood therefore had among the \nhighest rates of African-American and Hispanic home ownership in Burlington County.   \n63.  Despite  the  lower  incomes  of  the  Gardens’  households,  the  community  is \nremarkably stable and has many longtime residents.  \n64.  Residents  have  a  strong  sense  of  community  and  like  that  it  is  racially  and \nethnically diverse. \n65.  Many Gardens residents have family and friends living in the neighborhood.    \n66.  Residents enjoy the convenient location of the Gardens and its proximity to schools, \nemployment, businesses, and downtown.  \n67.  The stability of the Gardens neighborhood is attributable in part to lower housing \ncosts than that of Mt. Holly and Burlington County, making the Gardens more affordable for \nlower income households. \n68.  According to a more recent survey conducted by Triad in July 2006, the average \nmonthly homeowner cost being paid in the Gardens is $445 and the average rent is $696. \n69.  In addition, many longtime homeowners of the Gardens, particularly seniors, paid \noff their mortgages in full and can afford to keep their homes, although they would not be able to \npurchase much higher-priced homes in the current real estate market on their present incomes. \n70.  According to a survey conducted by planners commissioned by the Township in \n2000, 90% of the households in the Gardens had annual incomes below $40,000, 43% earned \nbetween $20,000 and $40,000, and nearly half—47%—earned less than $20,000. \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 15 of 55 PageID: 3040\nC.  Redevelopment Activities Before 2002  \n71.  For  almost  thirty  years,  community  members  and  Mt.  Holly  Township  have \nengaged in various planning initiatives to improve living conditions in the neighborhood. \n72.  These  planning  initiatives  included  a  community-led  effort  in  the  1980’s  that \nresulted in development of a strategy  to increase the homeownership rate through targeted \nproperty  acquisition  and  rehabilitation;  however,  this  strategy  was  never  adopted  by  the \nTownship.  \n73.  Another planning initiative was a housing rehabilitation program known as ―Mt. \nHolly 2000.‖  Through this program, eleven homeowners in the Gardens obtained grants and \nloans to fix up their properties.   \n74.  The Township subsequently decided not to support such revitalization efforts.  It \ninstead began to plan for a sweeping redevelopment of the entire community that would involve \nacquisition and demolition of most or all of the Gardens homes.  \n75.  In 2000, the Township began to purchase properties in the Gardens and leave them \nvacant  \n76.  In 2000, the Council also commissioned a private firm, THP, Inc., to investigate \nwhether the Gardens neighborhood met the criteria of an ―area in need of redevelopment‖ within \nthe meaning of N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et. seq.   \n77.  In November 2000, THP, Inc. prepared a report entitled ―Redevelopment Area \nDetermination Report‖ (―2000 Redevelopment Report‖), which it presented to the Council. \n78.  As  part  of  the  preparation  of  this  2000  Redevelopment  Report,  the  planners \nconducted a survey of the Gardens residents.  \n \n15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 16 of 55 PageID: 3041\n79.  The survey demonstrated that when questioned about the Township’s plans for \nredevelopment, residents were concerned about displacement and that more than 2/3 of the \nresidents stated that they would prefer to remain living in the Gardens. \nD.  Redevelopment Planning and Adoption of Redevelopment Plan \n80.  The Township adopted a Master Plan pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law, \nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., dated April 13, 2000.   \n81.  The Master Plan set forth certain goals, which included improving the qualify of \nMount Holly’s housing stock, upgrading the Gardens Area, and utilizing the LRHL to Mount \nHolly’s best advantage.  \n82.  With regard to the upgrade of the Gardens area, the Master Plan stated that one \nobjective of this Master Plan is to upgrade the quality of units and the character of area, and that \nmeasures should be taken to reduce the overall density in the Gardens Area, to rehabilitate \ndeteriorated units, and to provide additional amenities. \n83.  In the land use plan element, the Master Plan characterizes the Gardens as one of \ntwo ―high density areas‖ containing some deteriorated units, high proportion of rental properties, \nand with overcrowding an identified problem. The Master Plan recommended \n―redevelopment/revitalization‖ to allow for reduction of density, modernization of housing stock, \nand improvement to overall perception of the area. \n84.  On  July  30,  2002,  Council  passed  Resolution  No.  2002-166  authorizing  the \nTownship’s Planning Board to undertake a preliminary investigation and to hold a public hearing \nto determine whether the Gardens neighborhood was an area in need of redevelopment.  \n85.  The Planning Board subsequently received a report prepared by THP, Inc. entitled \n―Redevelopment Area Determination Report,‖ dated September 3, 2002.  \n \n16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 17 of 55 PageID: 3042\n86.  The September 3, 2002 Redevelopment Area Determination Report was almost \nidentical to the 2000 Redevelopment Report prepared for Council.  \n87.  On September 16, 2002, the Planning Board held the first public hearing on the \nquestion whether the Gardens should be designated as a redevelopment area. \n88.  On October 21, 2002, the Planning Board passed Resolution No. 2002-10, adopting \nthe findings and conclusions of the 2002 Redevelopment Report and recommending that the \nTownship Council designate the Gardens neighborhood as a ―redevelopment area‖ within the \nmeaning of N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. \n89.  On October 28, 2002, the Council passed Resolution No. 2002-217, accepting the \nfactual  findings  of  the  2002  Redevelopment  Report,  accepting  the  Planning  Board’s \nrecommendations and formally designating the Gardens neighborhood as an area in need of \nredevelopment under N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. \n90.  Resolution No. 2002-217 did not state or otherwise indicate that by designating the \nGardens neighborhood as an area in need of redevelopment, homes in the Gardens would be \ndemolished. \n91.  At the Planning Board hearing and at the Council meeting, Township officials \nmisled  Residents  by  telling  them  that  including  their  properties  in  an  area  in  need  of \nredevelopment did not mean that the Township would take their properties by eminent domain.   \n92.  In April 2003, the Council publicly released a document entitled ―The Gardens \nArea Redevelopment Plan‖ (―Gardens Redevelopment Plan‖).   \n93.  The Gardens Redevelopment Plan provided for the following:  \na.  Total demolition of all the homes in the neighborhood and relocation of all the \nresidents.  \n \n17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 18 of 55 PageID: 3043\nb.  Building 180 new housing units.  \nc.  No construction of any affordable housing units.  \nd.  No guarantee that any new housing in the redevelopment community would be \nmade available for Gardens residents either before or after displacement.  \ne.  No guarantee that any new housing in the redevelopment community would be \nrealistically affordable for Gardens residents.  \nf.  Building only 30 rental units, available only to seniors. \n94.  The proposed 180 new units would be much more expensive than existing homes; \ntherefore, the plan would permanently displace current residents who are predominately low-\nincome.  \n95.  On August 11, 2003, the Township held a public hearing on the adoption of the \nGardens Redevelopment Plan.   \n96.  Over 100 residents appeared before the Council protesting against the proposed \nredevelopment plan and the demolition of their homes.   \n97.  Among the objections raised by the residents were the following: \na.  They feel a strong sense of community and have pride in the community.  \nMany  are  long-term  residents.    They  feel  surrounded  by  family  and \nfriends.  They like that it is racially and ethnically diverse.  \nb.  Many residents are low-income.  Some had been homeless in the past.  \nThey are fearful that they will not be able to afford the new units that \nwere being planned for construction and that they will not be able to find \nother housing in the area they could afford. \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 19 of 55 PageID: 3044\nc.  Some residents, including some elderly homeowners, have paid off their \nmortgages.  They are afraid that if they lose their homes they will never \nbe able to purchase another one.  \n98.  Also on August 11, 2003, Plaintiff CIA submitted to the Township Council detailed \nwritten objections to the Gardens Redevelopment Plan with proposed alternatives to demolition \nof the residents’ homes, including that the Gardens Redevelopment Plan was drafted without \nmeaningful input from the residents and in disregard of the residents’ needs; that it discriminated \nagainst African-American and Hispanic residents on the basis of race and ethnicity; that it did \nnot realistically provide for housing that was decent and affordable for the residents, either as to \nunits to be newly constructed in the Gardens area or replacement housing elsewhere in Mt. Holly \nTownship  or  Burlington  County;  and  that  it would  cause  severe  hardship  by  forcing  most \nresidents, many of whom have lived in the Gardens for many years, to lose their homes and \nmove out of their community. \n99.  On  September  8,  2003,  the  Township  Council  passed  Ordinance  No.  2003-12 \nadopting the Gardens Redevelopment Plan as originally proposed. \n100. On October 23, 2003, Plaintiffs CIA and 35 individual residents filed an action in \nthe Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Docket No. BUR-L-003027-03, challenging \nthe designation of the Gardens as an area in need of redevelopment and the adoption of the \nGardens Redevelopment Plan under state law and on civil rights and constitutional grounds.  \n101. In February 2005, the Township Council directed the Planning Board to consider \namending the Gardens Redevelopment Plan.   \n102. On February 21, 2005, the Planning Board held a public hearing concerning a \nrevised redevelopment plan called the West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan (WR Redevelopment \n \n19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 20 of 55 PageID: 3045\nPlan), which encompassed the Gardens neighborhood and increased the area for commercial \nredevelopment. \n103. The WR Redevelopment Plan proposed the following:  \na.  228 new residential units. \nb.  Permitted residential uses increased up to 50% for two-family dwellings, \nup to 33% for townhouse/senior apartment combination dwellings, and \nup to 33% for townhouses.  The permitted uses; however, did not include \nany multifamily rental units.  \nc.  Demolition  of  existing  homes  and  new  construction  of  the  above \npermitted uses. \nd.  Possible  rehabilitation  of  existing  units,  but  rehabilitation  was  purely \noptional with no specified amount or percentage of existing residential \nunits that were to be rehabilitated. \ne.  Only 10% of the 228 dwelling units—a total of 23—to be affordable \nhousing units, with the remaining 205 units to be market rate units. \nf.  Commercial development in the area adjacent to the Mt. Holly Bypass \nRoad on the western edge of the redevelopment area. \n104.  Many Gardens residents appeared and spoke at the Planning Board hearing on \nFebruary 21, 2005, raising the same objections to the proposed WR Redevelopment Plan that \nthey had raised concerning the Gardens Redevelopment Plan.  \n105.  Also  on  February  21,  2005,  a  planning  expert,  Alan  Mallach,  FAICP,  PP, \nsubmitted  a  report  and  testified  on  behalf  of  the  residents  regarding  the  proposed  WR \nRedevelopment Plan.   \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 21 of 55 PageID: 3046\n106.  In the report, Mr. Mallach opined that the rehabilitation option under the Plan was \nat best illusory and that given the lower-income status of most of the Gardens residents, very few \nif any of the families could afford the 205 market rate units.  \n107.  Mr.  Mallach  also  testified  that  the  Township  could  improve  the  Gardens \ncommunity using much less drastic alternatives than the large-scale acquisition and demolition \ncalled for the WR Redevelopment Plan.  \n108.  In addition, Plaintiff CIA submitted detailed written comments to the Planning \nBoard on February 21, 2005, raising numerous objections and recommendations, including: that \nthe WR Redevelopment Plan should mandate as an overriding goal that existing homes be \nrehabilitated  instead  of  demolished  to  avoid  displacement  of  residents;  that  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan should permit multifamily rental housing—which constituted at least half \nof  the  existing  residential  units  in  the  Gardens—among  the  permitted  uses;  that  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan unlawfully discriminated against African-American and Hispanic residents \non the basis of race and ethnicity; and that the WR Redevelopment Plan’s limit of 23 affordable \nhousing units was a misapplication of the new growth share regulations promulgated by the New \nJersey Council on Affordable Housing (―COAH‖) and was otherwise contrary to the general \nwelfare under the New Jersey Constitution. \n109.  At the conclusion of the public hearing on February 21, 2005, the Planning Board \npassed a resolution recommending that the Council adopt the WR Redevelopment Plan, with the \nrecommendation  to  increase  the  townhouse  permitted  use  to  up  to  75%  of  the  total  228 \nresidential units. \n110.  The Planning Board did not recommend adoption of any amendments addressing \nthe concerns raised by the residents and plaintiffs. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 22 of 55 PageID: 3047\n111.  On March 14, 2005, the Township Council held a public hearing on the adoption \nof the WR Redevelopment Plan.   \n112.  Many  residents  appeared  and  voiced  similar  concerns  against  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan as stated before the Planning Board.   \n113.  Plaintiffs  also  submitted  written  comments  similar  to  those  presented  to  the \nPlanning Board. \n114.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Township Council adopted Ordinance 2005-\n07, adopting the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n115.  The Township Council disregarded all of the input it received from the Gardens \nresidents and failed to address the residents’ objections and concerns.   \n116.  The Township officials made false, misleading, and/or inaccurate statements in \nresponse to public comments regarding the designation of the Gardens community as an area in \nneed of redevelopment and regarding the adoption of the Gardens Redevelopment Plan and the \nWR Redevelopment Plan.  \n117.  The Township also took other actions to avoid informing the residents of its plans \nand to minimize public comment and participation in the redevelopment process.  \n118.  CIA and the other plaintiffs in the state court litigation amended their complaint \nto  allege  that  the  adoption  of  the  WR  Redevelopment  Plan  was  in  violation  of  state \nredevelopment law, civil rights laws, and the federal and state constitutions.  \n119.  On April 17, 2005, the Superior Court, the Hon. John Sweeney, held a bench trial \non the issues of whether the Gardens met the statutory criteria of a redevelopment area and \nwhether the WR Redevelopment Plan complied with the requirements of LRHL. On May 5, \n \n22 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 23 of 55 PageID: 3048\n2005, the court ruled in favor of the Township and entered judgment dismissing the prerogative \nwrit claims.  \n120.  On August 30, 2005, Judge Sweeney granted the Township summary judgment \ndismissing without prejudice the residents’ civil rights and constitutional claims upon finding \nthat they were not ripe for adjudication.  \n121.  On July 5, 2007, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the \nrulings of the trial court.  On December 11, 2007, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied the \nresidents’ petition for certification, and on February 5, 2008, the New Jersey Supreme Court \ndenied the residents’ motion for reconsideration.  \n122.  The Gardens redevelopment project is the only redevelopment initiative in Mt. \nHolly Township during the last 10 years that calls for large-scale demolition of homes and \ndisplacement of residents. \n123.  The Township conducted a reexamination of its Master Plan in June 2007.  \n124.  The Master Plan Reexamination repeats the discussion of the Gardens in the \nMaster Plan, and notes that the Township is improving the Gardens Area by declaring it a \nredevelopment area and adopting the WR Redevelopment Plan, which includes residential and \nnon-residential properties, as recommended in the Master Plan.  \n125.  The  Reexamination  includes  a  section  of  specific  recommendations,  which \nincorporate  the  specific  proposals  set  out  in  the  WR  Redevelopment  Plan  for  Residential, \nCommercial, Limited Industrial, and open space uses.  The Reexamination does not propose any \nchanges to the Master Plan with regard to the Gardens Area.  \nE.  Township’s and Redevelopers’ Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan \n1.  Acquisition of Properties \n \n23 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 24 of 55 PageID: 3049\n126.  By 2002, at the time the Gardens Plan was being considered by the Planning \nBoard and Council, the Township had acquired a total of 20 units, which it had intentionally left \nvacant and boarded up rather than attempting to renovate or sell them.   \n127.  On November 10, 2003, the Township Council enacted Ordinance No. 2003-37, \nauthorizing Township officials to negotiate and acquire all of the properties located in the \nGardens redevelopment area by voluntary sale or, if necessary, by condemnation, at a price not \nto exceed fair market value.   \n128.  After adoption of the WR Redevelopment Plan in 2005, the Township increased \nits efforts to acquire homes in the Gardens.  \n129.  In or about March 2005, the Township purchased the 62 rental properties from \nFry Properties for approximately $53,000 per unit totaling $3.27 million.  \n130.  In  or  about  April  2006,  the  Township  obtained  an  appraisal  report,  which \ndetermined that the value of a one-bedroom house in the Gardens was $32,000, a two-bedroom \nhouse was $39,000, and a three-bedroom house was $49,000.  \n131.  Since 2006, the Township has purchased numerous homes at prices ranging from \n$32,000 to $49,000, except for two purchases at $64,000 and one purchase at $81,000 for \nproperties that contained two units converted into one larger home.  \n132.  By December 2007, the Township had acquired a total of 219 residential units out \nof the 329 original homes in the Gardens redevelopment area. Most of these residential units had \nbeen occupied by tenants or homeowners before the Township acquired them. The Township had \ndemolished 42 of its acquired units, and kept 165 of the remaining 177 units vacant and boarded.  \n133.  Because the Township had not re-rented or re-sold its units upon acquisition, the \nTownship’s acquisitions increased the overall vacancy rate in the Gardens to nearly 65%.  \n \n24 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 25 of 55 PageID: 3050\n134.  Since December 2007, the Township has demolished an additional 31 residential \nunits, for a total 73 demolished units,  \n135.  The only measures the Township has taken to secure its vacant properties has to \nput particle board panels on the windows and to plaster large orange ―no trespassing signs‖ on \nthem. \n136.  The Township has not adequately secured or maintained the houses and yards of \nthe  properties  it  owns,  allowing  these  properties  to  deteriorate  and  become  vandalized  by \ntrespassers.  \n137.  The vacant Township-owned properties have caused and are continuing to cause a \nseverely  blighting  and  deleterious  effect  on  the  Gardens  neighborhood,  created  risk  of \ninfestation, fire hazards, and mold, and encouraged further disinvestment in the community. \n138.  The Township and Redevelopers have made and are continuing to make offers to \nGardens property owners to purchase units for the prices of $32,000 for a one-bedroom house, \n$39,000 for a two-bedroom house, and $49,000 for a three-bedroom house. \n139.  The Township recently initiated the eminent domain process against one absentee \nproperty owner to acquire additional properties.  \n140.  On April 12, 2008, the Township Council introduced and passed on first reading \nOrdinance 2008-12. The Ordinance states that the Township is or will be the owner of all of the \nproperties in the redevelopment area, and authorizes the Mayor, and/or the Township Manager \nand/or Township Clerk to negotiate and execute a Purchase and Sale Agreement, and all other \nnecessary documents, between the Township and Redevelopers for all of the properties for the \nminimum purchase price of $9 million and to execute any documents necessary to effectuate the \nsale, including any documents that may be required for Eminent Domain proceedings.   \n \n25 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 26 of 55 PageID: 3051\n2.  Selection of Redevelopers  \n141.  On February 15, 2006, the Township executed a Redevelopment Agreement with \nDefendant Keating. \n142.   In or about March 2006, Keating hired Triad to conduct the relocation activities \nassociated with the WR Redevelopment Plan.  \n143.   Pursuant to Exhibit C of the Redevelopment Agreement, Keating was to form a \nsingle purpose limited liability corporation with another redeveloper, Pennrose Properties, with \nKeating assigning its rights and obligations under the Redevelopment Agreement to the newly \nformed LLC and maintaining majority ownership.  Upon information and belief, the single \npurpose limited liability corporation described in Exhibit C of the Redevelopment Agreement \nhas not yet been formed and is presently not in existence. \n144.  Keating subsequently began to take various actions to move the redevelopment \nproject forward including obtaining a survey; negotiating on behalf of the Township for the \nacquisition of a number of properties; meeting with various professionals such as planners, \narchitects, and engineers; and submitting applications for permits and approvals.  \n145.  On  February  23,  2007,  the  Redevelopers  became  responsible  for  property \nmanagement of the Township-owned properties.  \n \n26 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 27 of 55 PageID: 3052\n3.  Relocation of Gardens Residents \n146.  On  September  28,  2006,  the  Township  submitted  a  Workable  Relocation \nAssistance Plan (―WRAP‖), prepared by Defendant Triad, to the New Jersey Department of \nCommunity Affairs.  \n147.  The WRAP provided the following: \na.  Proposed relocation of all current Gardens residents.  \nb.  A ―Right of First Opportunity‖ for residents to return to the Gardens area \nafter the redevelopment project is completed. \nc.  No provision that any replacement units realistically affordable to the \nresidents would be created in the Gardens  \nd.  No provision that any replacement units realistically affordable to the \nresidents would be created in any other areas in the Township or in the \nsurrounding region. \ne.  All  residents  on  August  1,  2006,  would  be  eligible  for  relocation \nassistance.  \nf.  Qualified  resident  homeowners  would  be  eligible,  in  addition  to  the \n$15,000.00 required by N.J.A.C. 5:11-3.7(a), for a $20,000 no-interest \nloan payable if and when the relocated homeowner sold the replacement \ndwelling.  \ng.  Qualified  tenants  who  moved  into  non-subsidized  rental  units  were \neligible for up to $4,000.00 in assistance as provided by N.J.A.C. 5:11-\n3.5 and additional assistance up to $3,500.00.  \n \n27 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 28 of 55 PageID: 3053\nh.  However, homeowners or tenants who used relocation funds to move out \nthe Gardens would not be eligible for additional relocation funds to return \nto the  Gardens  if  and  when  any  affordable  units  were  ultimately \nconstructed. \n148.  In November 2006, the Township received notification from the Department of \nCommunity Affairs that the WRAP was approved.  \n149.  On  November  15,  2006,  Triad  opened  an  office  in  the  Gardens  to  conduct \nrelocation activities.  \n150.  Triad staff began to send letters and notices to tenant households asking them to \ncome in for interviews.  \n151.  After assessing their housing needs, Triad staff started to make efforts to locate \nhousing for these households outside of the Gardens.  \n152.   The Township did not provide any relocation assistance to residents who moved \nout of the Gardens prior to November 2006.  \n153.  Since the WRAP was approved in November, 2006 through January, 2008, the \nTownship paid relocation funds to 62 families to move out of the Gardens. \n154.  Of these 62 households, 43, or 69%, were relocated outside of Mt. Holly.  \n4.  Demolition of Units \n155.  The  Township  and  Redevelopers  have  and  are  continuing  to  dismantle  the \nGardens community by demolishing homes in the Gardens.   \n156.  As of May 2008, the Township has demolished a total of 73 residential units, \nmost of which were previously occupied by tenants or homeowners.    \n \n28 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 29 of 55 PageID: 3054\n157.  Although the Township claimed that the demolitions of the houses were necessary \nfor  health  and  safety  concerns,  the  units  were  generally  structurally  sound,  capable  of \nrehabilitation, and did not pose a threat to public safety.  \n158.  To the extent the units were in poor condition and being used by trespassers, this \nwas a result of the Township’s failure to take measures to adequately secure and maintain them.  \n5.  Reduction in Municipal Services  \n159.  Starting in 2000, before the Township even initiated the formal redevelopment \nplanning process, the Township itself began to create blighted conditions in the Gardens.  \n160.  Starting in 2000 and continuing during the course of the redevelopment process, \nthe Township neglected the needs of the Gardens neighborhood by failing to apply for and utilize \navailable funding for community improvements and housing rehabilitation.  \n161.  From  January  1999  to  the  present,  the  Township  entered  into  regional \ncontribution agreements pursuant to the New Jersey Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et \nseq., with the municipalities of Moorestown, Hainesport, and Westhampton, with the Township \nreceiving  more  than  $4  million  to  rehabilitate  218  residential  units  occupied  by  low  and \nmoderate income households within Mount Holly. \n162.  The Township has not at any time allocated or used any funds from the regional \ncontribution agreements to rehabilitate homes in the Gardens.  \n163.  The Township failed to utilize a $25,000 grant from the New Jersey Department \nof Community Affairs earmarked for social, educational, and recreational programs for residents \nat the Gardens community center and in July, 2003 was forced to return the unspent funds.  \n164.  In 2004, the Township removed the only playground equipment in the Gardens \nand refused to replace it.  \n \n29 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 30 of 55 PageID: 3055\n165.  The  Township  also  failed  to  conduct  proper code  enforcement,  prompt  trash \nremoval, adequate policing, and other basic services needed by the Gardens residents. \n166.  The Township twice used its vacant properties in the Gardens to conduct live \npolice tactical training, bringing in numerous police officers and vehicles into the Gardens in the \nearly morning hours, without providing advance notice to residents in the neighborhood. \n167.  The Township’s failure to provide adequate and proper municipal services has \nnegatively impacted upon the community and decreased the quality of life for residents. \n168.  In spite of the Township’s actions, Gardens residents, through their own efforts, \ncontinued to combat significant deterioration of their neighborhood and tried to preserve their \nquality of life. \nF.  Continued Planning and Changes to WR Redevelopment Plan \n169.  On March 9, March 23, and April 5, 2006, the Redevelopers held three meetings \nwith Gardens residents. \n170.  The residents participating in these meetings thought  that the purpose of the \nmeetings was to consider revisions to the redevelopment plan.  \n171.  At  all  three  of  the  meetings,  Gardens  residents  gave  input  about  the \nredevelopment process and stated that they did not want to lose their homes or to be moved out \nof the Gardens.  \n172.  The  Gardens  residents  presented  to  the  Redevelopers  a  list  of  proposals  for \nrevising the WR Redevelopment Plan, which included a guarantee of affordable replacement \nunits for all residents to be displaced who wished to remain in the Gardens.  \n173.  At the third meeting, resident surveys were distributed.  \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 31 of 55 PageID: 3056\n174.  In July of 2006, Triad completed the resident survey process. 169 households \nresponded, including 107 tenant households and 60 homeowners.  \n175.  The Triad survey showed that 120 out of the 169 families were interested in either \npurchasing or renting a new home in the Gardens, only 64 families were interested in purchasing \nor renting outside of the Gardens, and only 8 households were interested in selling their property.  \n176.  In or about October 2006, the Township and Redevelopers notified the residents \nof the completion of the Relocation Plan.   \n177.  The WRAP stated that 560 units were being planned for the redevelopment area.  \n178.  During  the  period  between  February  of  2006  and  September  2007,  the \nRedevelopers prepared and revised approximately eight conceptual plans for the redevelopment \narea, referred to by the Township as ―concept plans‖.  \n179.  Since the adoption of the WR Redevelopment Plan, the Township Council has \nconducted many discussions during closed executive session.   \n180.  The Township did not provide any public notice or conduct any public meetings \nregarding the concept plans that were being prepared by the Redevelopers or refer them to the \nPlanning Board for review \n181.  On or about September 24, 2007, the Township Council approved a concept plan \nduring a closed executive session, in violation of the Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:40-\n6 et seq. Council did not notify the public about its review of the concept plan, offer any \nopportunity for public input, or provide any subsequent information to the public about the \nactions taken during the executive session.  The concept plan proposed construction of 203 \nmarket rate and 25 COAH income restricted apartments and 261 market rate and 31 COAH \ntownhouses.  \n \n31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 32 of 55 PageID: 3057\n182.  On September 8, 2008 the Township Council passed on first reading Ordinance \n2008-25,  adopting a Revised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan (Revised WR Redevelopment \nPlan), and referred it  to the Planning Board for review.. \n183.  The  Revised  WR  Redevelopment  Plan  contains,  inter  alia,    the  following \nprovisions: \n(a) It includes as objectives increasing the number of owner-occupied dwelling \nunits  by  increasing  homeownership  opportunities  for  existing  and  future \nresidents and ensuring that new dwelling units remain affordable. \n(b) It calls for acquisition and demolition of all existing homes in the Gardens.  \n(c) It proposes construction of up to 520 housing units and 54,000 square feet of \ncommercial space in the redevelopment area. Up to 75% of the housing units \nmay be townhouses and up to 50% may be apartments.  \n(d) The Land Use Plan proposes situating the apartments on a vacant land area \nnorth  of  the  Gardens, the  commercial  district  on  the  western  side  of  the \nredevelopment area along the Mt Holly Bypass Road, and the townhouses on \nthe eastern and southern portions of the redevelopment area.  \n(e) It proposes the replacement of the 11 deed-restricted houses in the Gardens, \nand creation of 45 additional deed-restricted ―affordable units‖, and states that \nthe current occupants of the existing 11 deed-restricted units would have \npriority for the replacement units, without any provision for the replacement \nof  the  other  273  units  formerly  occupied  by  predominately  low  income \nfamilies and without any guarantee that any of the affordable units would be \n \n32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 33 of 55 PageID: 3058\nrealistically affordable to current and former Gardens residents and would be \nmade available prior to displacement.  \n(f) The Revised WR Redevelopment Plan acknowledges that it is inconsistent \nwith  the  Township  Master  Plan  because  it  does  not  reduce  density  and \nbecause  it  calls  for  total  demolition  rather  than  rehabilitation  of  existing \nhomes, but concludes that this inconsistency is warranted based on economic \nconditions and redeveloper preference. The Plan states that it there would be \nno adverse impacts to neighboring Westhampton Township land uses and that \nthe Plan is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.  \n184.  On September 9, 2008 the Township and Redevelopers held a public meeting at \nwhich  the  Redevelopers  presented  their  proposed  plans  for  redevelopment.  This  general \ndevelopment plan proposed construction of 228 luxury rental units, and 292 townhouses, totaling \n520 housing units, along with 54,000 square feet of commercial development. The construction \nwould take place in phases, with the Phase IA to consist of the apartments and 60 townhouses to \nbe built  on vacant  land just north of the  Gardens, Phase  IB to  consist  of the commercial \ndevelopment to be situated along the Mt Holly Bypass, where North and South Martin Avenues \nare currently located, and Phases II and III to consist of additional townhouse development in the \neastern portion of the Gardens. The Redevelopers’ proposal called for 56 affordable units to be \ninterspersed among the remaining 464 market-rate units.  \n185.  On  September  15,  2008  the  Planning  Board  reviewed  the  Revised  WR \nRedevelopment  Plan  and  heard  public  comment.  The  Planning  Board  members  and  their \nprofessional  consultants  had  not  been  previously  involved  in  developing  or  evaluating  the \nRevised Plan. Several Gardens residents appeared before the Planning Board and objected to the \n \n33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 34 of 55 PageID: 3059\nRevised WR Redevelopment Plan because it required taking of their homes and failed to provide \naffordable replacement housing. Counsel for the residents also testified and submitted written \nobjections. The Planning Board recommended adoption of the Revised WR Redevelopment \nPlan, without meaningful consideration of the residents’ objections.  \n186.  On  September  22,  2008  the  Township  Council  held  a  public  hearing  and \nconsidered  the  Ordinance  to  adopt  the  Revised  WR  Redevelopment  Plan.  Several  Gardens \nresidents again appeared and objected to Revised WR Redevelopment Plan.  Counsel for the \nresidents also testified and again submitted written objections. The Council voted to adopt the \nOrdinance on second reading, without meaningful consideration of the residents’ objections.  \nG.  Failure to Provide Affordable Replacement Units \n187.  The Township has estimated that the prices of the new townhouses to be built in \nthe redevelopment area will range from $200,000 to 275,000 and that apartments will rent at \napproximately $1.65 per square foot, with a one-bedroom unit renting for $1,230 per month.  \nThe Redevelopers stated at the public meeting that the apartments are to be priced above current \nmarket prices, and the first set of townhouses are expected to cost $240,000. \n188.  Nearly all Gardens residents cannot afford to purchase or rent the new units.  \n189.  The affordable housing provision in the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan does \nnot constitute adequate replacement housing because it proposes to replace the 329 Gardens \nhomes with only 56 affordable units, without any guarantee that even any of these 56 units \nwould be realistically affordable or available to Gardens residents. \nH.  Harm to Residents and CIA by Township’s and Redeveloper’s Actions  \n190.  By acquiring and vacating properties, failing to maintain the properties it owns, \nreducing municipal services, demolishing units, and creating increasingly blighted conditions in \n \n34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 35 of 55 PageID: 3060\nthe Gardens, the Township and Redevelopers have interfered and are continuing to severely \ninterfere with the Gardens residents’ use and enjoyment of their property and to otherwise injure \nGardens residents.  \n191.  Gardens residents risk losing their financial investments in their homes if they \ncontinue to make improvements or repairs. \n192.  Because the Township’s and Redeveloper’s actions have created severely blighted \nconditions  and  greatly  lowered  property  values,  and  because  of  the  imminent  threat  of \ncondemnation, Gardens residents are unable to sell their home on the private market at a price \nthat  provides  just  compensation  and  that  would  enable  them  to  find  alternate  comparable \nhousing.  \n193.  The  Township’s  proposed  prices  for  purchase  of  the  properties  also  do  not \nconstitute just compensation and are inadequate to enable residents to purchase decent, safe, and \naffordable comparable replacement housing.  \n194.  Because  of  the  Township-caused  increased  vacancy  rate,  proliferation  of \nabandoned home, and ugly appearance of the neighborhood, Gardens residents increasingly fear \nfor their security and safety, experience pest infestation and mold, cannot enjoy spending time in \ntheir yards and open areas, and are embarrassed to have family and friends visit.  \n195.  Gardens residents have experienced and are continuing to experience great stress, \nanxiety, and grief because of their fear of losing their homes and their strong community ties and \nbecoming unable to find adequate affordable replacement housing. \n196.  Many  former  Gardens  residents  have  moved  out  of  the  Gardens  community \nbecause the community had become such an undesirable and unsafe place to live and because \neventual eviction or condemnation by the Township appeared inevitable.  \n \n35 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 36 of 55 PageID: 3061\n197.  Many former Gardens residents who moved out of the Gardens under threat of \ncondemnation  or  eviction  have  not  been  able  to  find  comparable  replacement  housing  at \nlocations as desirable as the Gardens community and have been forced to live under worse \nconditions and/or pay higher housing costs.   \n198.  The Township’s and Redeveloper’s actions have harmed CIA by impeding its \nability to organize residents and operate effectively as a representative organization.  \n199.  The Township’s and Redeveloper’s concerted actions render ripe for adjudication \nthe civil rights and constitutional claims that were dismissed by the state court without prejudice \nfor lack of ripeness, including but not limited to the following: \n(a) Actions to effectuate the redevelopment of the Gardens between March of \n2005  and  the  present,  including  the  selection  of  the  Redeveloper,  the \nexecution of the Redeveloper Agreement, the preparation of the WRAP, the \nacquisition, vacation, and demolition of properties, the relocation of  tow-\nthirds of the residents, the creation of severely blighted living conditions, the \nfailure to provide affordable replacement housing to those being displaced, \nand the injury suffered by the Residents as a result of these actions;  \n(b) The Township’s formal adoption of a third, revised redevelopment plan in \nSeptember 2008—five years after the Township’s first redevelopment plan in \n2003—that specifically details the number, type, and affordability levels of \nthe housing units; \n(c) The Township’s preparation of a Redeveloper general development plan that \nprovides details concerning the type and price of the housing units. \n \n \n \n36 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 37 of 55 PageID: 3062\nFIRST COUNT \n \nUNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT,  \n42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \n \n200. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n201. By the actions described above, the Township and Redevelopers have violated and \ncontinue to violate the rights of plaintiffs under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nand implementing regulations by: \na.   Making unavailable or denying dwellings to persons because of race, color and \nnational origin, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and implementing regulations;  \nb.  Discriminating  on  the  basis  of  race,  color  or  national  origin  in  the  terms, \nconditions or privileges of services or facilities in connection with the sale or \nrental  of  a  swelling  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C.  §  3604(b)  and  implementing \nregulations; and \nc.   Coercing, intimidating, threatening or interfering with any person's exercise of his \nor her rights protected under 42 U.S.C. § 3604, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3617.  \n202.  The Township’s and Redevelopers’ actions, practices and policies, as described \nabove in the Complaint, have had and continue to have a substantial adverse, disparate impact on \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3604 (a) and (b). \na.  The Township’s and Redevelopers’ actions, practices and policies will dismantle and \ndestroy the Gardens, which is predominately African-American and Hispanic and has \nthe most concentrated populations of African-American and Hispanic persons in the \nTownship. \n \n37 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 38 of 55 PageID: 3063\nb.  The Township’s and Redevelopers’ actions, practices and policies will substantially \nand disproportionately displace African-American and Hispanic households from the \nGardens and from Mt. Holly Township, who are mostly lower and moderate income \nand who cannot afford the homes that will be constructed in the Gardens or existing \nhousing in the local housing market.   \nc.   The  Township’s  and  Redevelopers’  actions,  practices  and  policies  will  destroy \nhundreds of residential homes affordable to lower and moderate income African-\nAmerican and Hispanic Households without providing replacement housing that is \naffordable to most such households. \n203.  In addition, the Township’s actions demonstrate that Township officials acted \nwith intent to discriminate, as follows: \na.  The Township knew that the residents of the Gardens were predominately African-\nAmerican  and  Hispanic,  and  that  the  Gardens  community  was  one  of  the  most \nconcentrated populations of African-American and Hispanic persons in the Township. \nb.  The Township decided to abandon efforts to rehabilitate the Gardens and instead \ninitiate a redevelopment project that would require the forcible relocation of all or \nmost Gardens residents.  \nc.  Even before adoption of a redevelopment plan, the Township took actions to create \nblighted conditions in the Gardens and to drive down the costs of property acquisition \nand relocation.  \nd.  The Township knew or should have known that the predominately African-American \nand Hispanic Gardens residents would be unable to afford the proposed new housing \nto be constructed under its redevelopment plan. \n \n38 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 39 of 55 PageID: 3064\ne.  The Township also knew or had reason to know that there was an inadequate supply \nof affordable housing in the area and especially within the Township.  \nf.   The Township knew or had reason to know that Gardens residents would find few \naffordable housing options within Mt. Holly Township and would be likely be forced \nto move out to other municipalities. \ng.  The Township knew or should have known that implementation of its redevelopment \nplan  would  therefore  result  in  decreasing  the  numbers  of  African-American  and \nHispanic residents in Mt. Holly.  \nh.  The Township knew or should have known that the African-American and Hispanic \nresidents would experience severe hardship from being forcibly relocated and would \nhave great difficulty in securing adequate replacement housing.  \ni.  The Township officials also knew or had reason to know that the redevelopment \nwould thus cause severe harm to Gardens residents, as they would lose their homes \nand their community and have great difficulty in finding decent, safe, affordable \nreplacement housing in Mt Holly Township and the surrounding region. \nj.  The Township officials adopted and began to implement the Gardens Redevelopment \nPlan, the WR Redevelopment Plan, and the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan with \nthe intent to displace current Gardens residents and force a significant number of \nthem to move out of Mt Holly.  \nk.  The Gardens community, which has the highest concentration of African-American \nand Hispanic residents in the Township, is the only community the Township has \ntargeted for large-scale displacement and relocation. \n \n39 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 40 of 55 PageID: 3065\nl.  The Township deviated from procedural and substantive norms by when the Council \nviolated the procedures mandated by the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq., and the \nOPMA, N.J.S.A. 10:4-12 by changing the redevelopment plan by vote in closed \nsession without first conducting a public process to formally amend the plan, curing \nthese statutory violations only after the Residents had brought claims based on these \nviolations, and conducting a sham public process without opportunity for meaningful \npublic input;   \nm. The Township deviated from procedural and substantive norms by adopting a revised \nredevelopment  plan  that  is  inconsistent  with  the  policies  and  priorities  of  the \nTownship’s Master Plan.  \nn.  The  Township  knowingly  and  deliberately  created  adverse  and  unsafe  living \nconditions  at  the  Gardens  by  failing  to  provide  adequate  essential  services,  by \npurchasing  properties  and  leaving  them  in  vacant  and  deteriorated  condition,  by \ndemolishing structurally sound units that were capable of rehabilitation, by failing to \nobtain and expend funds for community improvements, and by failing to support \ncommunity-led initiatives for improving housing and quality of life in the Gardens.  \no.  The  Township  intentionally  took  action  to  drive  down  property  values  and  its \nacquisition and relocation costs, improperly assessed the value of the properties, and \nfailed  to  make  available  to  the  predominately  African-American  and  Hispanic \nGardens residents just compensation and adequate relocation assistance.  \np.  When the Township adopted the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan in September \n2008, the Township knew or should have known of the significant harmful and \ndiscriminatory effects that its redevelopment project has had on Gardens residents \n \n40 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 41 of 55 PageID: 3066\nsince  2003.    Nonetheless  the  Township  failed  to  make  changes  to  the  revised \nredevelopment plan that would have alleviated such harm and discriminatory effects, \nbut instead in adopting the Revised Plan, intentionally continued to perpetuate these \nharmful and discriminatory impacts upon the residents;  \nq.   The Township’s prior history regarding its treatment the Gardens and its adoption of \nthe original and revised redevelopment plans, despite knowledge of its discriminatory \neffects  demonstrate  that  the  Township  intended  to  and  did  discriminate  against \nplaintiffs on the basis of race, color, and national origin. \nr.   The Township intentionally took action it knew or should have known would coerce, \nintimidate, threaten and interfere with residents' rights to rent, own, sell, buy and \notherwise exercise their rights protected under the 42 U.S.C § 3604 by coercing \nresidents to sell their property to the Township, by leaving the properties it purchased \nvacant,  poorly  maintained  and  attractive  to  vandalizers  and  trespassers,  by \ndemolishing  units  attached  to  units  it  knew  to  be  occupied  by  residents,  thus \nfrightening the residents and structurally damaging their units, by conducting live \npolice weapons and tactics team trainings in vacant units in view of residents and \ntheir children and by sending residents notices of relocation interviews, that they \nknew or should have known would be coercive, intimidating, threatening and would \ninterfere with residents' rights. \n204. By the actions described above, the Township has intentionally, knowingly, and \ncontinuously  discriminated  against  African  American,  Hispanic  and  other  residents  of  the \nGardens neighborhood because of their race, color or national origin, or the racial, color or \nnational origin composition of their neighborhood, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. \n \n41 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 42 of 55 PageID: 3067\n205. The  Township  have  intentionally, knowingly,  and  continuously  engaged  in  the \npractices described above that have a predictable discriminatory effect with the intent of denying \nequal housing opportunities to Residents. \n206.  The  actions  of  the  Township  and  Redevelopers  in  adopting,  revising,  and \nimplementing the redevelopment plans for the Gardens have caused and are continuing to cause \nsevere harm to the low and moderate income, predominately African-American and Hispanic \nGardens residents. \n207. The acts and conduct of the Township and Redevelopers complained of above have \ncaused and continue to cause substantial injury to each of the individual plaintiffs and to plaintiff \nCitizens in Action. \nSECOND COUNT \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866,  \n42 U.S.C. §1982 \n \n208. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n209. The Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1982,  guarantees that  ―[a]ll \ncitizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed \nby white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal \nproperty.‖ \n210. By  seeking  to  demolish  all  329  homes  within  the  Gardens  neighborhood  and \nproposing to construct much more expensive replacement housing units unaffordable to most \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households living in the Gardens, the Township is intentionally \nseeking to deprive the plaintiffs and other African-American and Hispanic residents of the same \n \n42 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 43 of 55 PageID: 3068\nright to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property as is enjoyed by \nwhite citizens, in violation of to 42 U.S.C. § 1982. \n211. The Township has otherwise intentionally discriminated against Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of the Gardens neighborhood as described under the \nFirst and Third Counts of this Complaint. \n212. The Township has thus violated plaintiffs rights guaranteed under 42 U.S.C. §1982.  \nTHIRD COUNT \nVIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF FOURTEENTH  \nAMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ACTIONABLE \nPURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n213.  Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein. \n214. The Township has intentionally discriminated against plaintiff Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of the Gardens neighborhood as described under the \nFirst and Second Counts of this Complaint. \n215.  The Township has, under color of state law, intentionally deprived the Residents of \ntheir  rights  to  equal  protection  under  the  law  as  guaranteed  to  them  by  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States Constitution because of their race, ethnicity and/or national \norigin, actionable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. \nFOURTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF NEW JERSEY LAW AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, \nN.J.S.A. 10:5-1 ET SEQ. \n       \n216. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n \n43 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 44 of 55 PageID: 3069\n217. N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination states that ―[i]t \nshall be unlawful discrimination for a municipality, county or  other local civil or  political \nsubdivision of the State of New Jersey, or an officer, employee, or agent thereof, to exercise the \npower to regulate land use or housing in a manner that discriminates on the basis of race, creed, \ncolor, national origin, ancestry, marital status, familial status, sex, nationality or handicap‖. \n218. As set forth in Counts One through Three, the Township has taken actions that are \ncausing and will continue to cause the disproportionate displacement and forced removal of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households, that have reduced and will continue to reduce the \noverall number of African-American and Hispanic households living in Mt. Holly Township, \nthat  discriminate  against  African-American  and  Hispanic  households  living  in  the  Gardens \nneighborhood in the provision of services or facilities in connection with housing, that will create \nbarriers for African-American and Hispanic households to remain in and move into Mt. Holly \nTownship, and that thus have a discriminatory impact upon the basis of race, color and national \norigin and perpetuate segregation within Mt. Holly Township in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5. \n219. In  addition  to  violating  the  New  Jersey  Law  Against  Discrimination  due  to \ndiscriminatory impact, the Township has intentionally discriminated against plaintiffs and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households living in the Gardens neighborhood contrary to \nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 as described under Counts One through Three of this Complaint. \n220. In addition, as set forth previously herein, the Township and Redevelopers have \notherwise discriminated against African-American and Hispanic households in the provision of \nhousing in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 of the LAD.  \n \n44 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 45 of 55 PageID: 3070\n221. The  Township  and  Redevelopers  have  thus  unlawfully  discriminated  against \nplaintiffs in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 and N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 of the New Jersey Law Against \nDiscrimination. \nFIFTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF ARTICLE I,  \nPARAGRAPH 1 OF NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION \n \n222. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n223. The Township has intentionally discriminated against plaintiff Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of the Gardens neighborhood by initiating and \nimplementing a redevelopment project that forcibly displaces these residents as described under \nthe First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Counts of this Complaint. \n224. The Township, under color of state law, has intentionally deprived plaintiffs of their \nright to equal protection of the law because of their race, ethnicity and/or national origin, in \nviolation of Article I, Paragraph 1 of New Jersey Constitution. \nSIXTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL \nFAIRNESS AS GUARANTEED BY ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPH 1 OF THE NEW \nJERSEY CONSTITUTION  \n \n225.  Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n226. The Township failed to provide individualized notice to all owners of properties to \nbe acquired under its redevelopment plans and to otherwise meaningfully inform and give notice \nto  residents  of  the  effects  of  redevelopment  activities  upon  their  constitutionally  protected \nproperty rights. \n \n45 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 46 of 55 PageID: 3071\n227. The Township conducted private meetings with Redevelopers and other entities \nregarding the redevelopment initiative without giving notice to residents or an opportunity to be \nheard. \n228. The Township Council decided to make revisions to the WR Redevelopment Plan \nbased upon private discussions with the Redevelopers without first holding a public meeting as \nrequired  by  OPMA,  N.J.S.A.  10:4-13,  conducting  a  formal  process  for  amending  a \nredevelopment plan as required by the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, obtaining recommendations \nfrom the Planning Board, and providing notice to the public and an opportunity for residents to \nhe heard with regard to the amendments, instead conducted private meetings with Redevelopers \nand approved the Redevelopers’ concept plan in a closed session.   \n229. The Township and Redevelopers continued to aggressively implement this new \nversion of the redevelopment plan which had not been formally adopted.   \n230. Although the Township attempted to cure these violations by formally revising the \nWR Redevelopment Plan, the Council members had already decided to adopt the Revised Plan \nthat is fully consistent with the previously approved Redevelopers’ concept plan, and failed to \nconsider any public comment and input, rendering the public process a sham.  \n231. The Township’s improper actions to amend and implement the redevelopment plan \nsignificantly and substantially interfere with and infringe upon the property rights of Residents.   \n232. The Township’s failure to follow the LRHL’s formal plan amendment procedures, \nbefore  taking  drastic  implementation  actions  destroying  and  dismantling  the  Gardens \nneighborhood, and its failure to conduct an open process allowing for meaningful public input is \nunjust and arbitrary governmental action, resulting in the unfair treatment of Gardens residents, \n \n46 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 47 of 55 PageID: 3072\nand inflicting upon them oppression, harassment, and egregious deprivation  causing unjustified \nharassment, anxiety, and expense. \n233. The Township’s actions violate due process and fundamental fairness under the \nArticle 1, Paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution. \nSEVENTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY \nTHE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \nACTIONABLE PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n234. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n235. As set forth above in the Sixth Count of this Complaint, the Township has taken \nactions that infringe upon and deprive Residents of their property rights without meaningful and \nadequate notice and opportunity to be heard.  \n236. The Township, acting under color of state law, has deprived Residents of their \nrights secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, actionable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \nEIGHTH COUNT \nADOPTION OF THE REVISED WR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN CONTRARY TO THE \nPROVISIONS OF THE NEW JERSEY LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING \nLAW, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A -1 ET SEQ. AND ARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS AND \nUNREASONABLE \n \n237. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n238. The actions of the Township in adopting the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan \nviolate the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, and are arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable as, inter \nalia: \n \n47 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 48 of 55 PageID: 3073\n(a) The Plan was revised without opportunity for meaningful community input \nand  without  consideration  by  the  Planning  Board  and  Council  of  the \nResidents’ comments; \n(b) The Plan does not further several of its own objectives; \n(c) The Plan is substantially inconsistent with the Township’s Master Plan and \ndoes not demonstrate any legitimate basis for deviating from the Master Plan; \n(d) The Plan is inconsistent with the State Plan for housing and fails to address \nthat inconsistency as mandated by N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7; \n(e) The Plan is does not address whether it is consistent with the County Master \nPlan, as mandated by N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7; \n(f) The Plan is inconsistent with the purposes of the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-2, \nas it fails to promote the advancement of community interests and physical \ndevelopment  which  will  be  most  conducive  to  social  and  economic \nimprovement and is otherwise arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.  \nNINTH COUNT \nEXCLUSIONARY REDEVELOPMENT IN VIOLATION OF THE GENERAL \nWELFARE UNDER ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPH 1 OF THE NEW JERSEY \nCONSTITUTION \n \n239. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n240.  The general welfare under Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution \nrequires municipalities to regulate and use land to promote the public health, safety, and general \nwelfare of people of all incomes and economic status within the municipality, and therefore \n \n48 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 73    Filed 12/03/08   Page 49 of 55 PageID: 3074\nprohibits municipalities from using their redevelopment police powers in a manner that displaces \nand excludes existing lower-income residents from their community. \n241.  The Revised WR Redevelopment Plan calls for replacing the 329 residential units \nin  the  Gardens  with  520  residential  units,  of  which  only  11%—a  total  of  56—would  be \naffordable housing units, with the remaining 464 units to be market rate units.  \n242.  The Township is in the process of acquiring and demolishing all of the existing \nhomes in the Gardens, although the houses were structurally sound and the Township had not \ndemonstrated that they constituted a substantial threat to health and safety and could not be \nrestored to standard condition within a reasonable time and at a reasonable expense. \n243.  Most of the households in the Gardens are lower and moderate income and will \nnot be able to afford the market rate units called for in the Revised WR Plan. \n244.  The Township has violated the general welfare under Article I, Paragraph of the \nNew Jersey Constitution by adopting the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan and by exercising its \nredevelopment, eminent domain, and demolition authority and its powers of regulation and use \nof land in a manner that fails to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of people \nof all incomes and economic status within Mt.

The  Township  has  further  violated  the  general  welfare  by  implementing  its \nredevelopment  plans  in  a  manner  that  has  created  unsafe  and  increasingly  blighted \nconditions,  greatly  decreased  quality  of  life,  interfered  with  the  residents’  use  and \nenjoyment  of  their  property,  forced  residents  to  move  out  of  their  community,  and \nprovided them with inadequate compensation and relocation assistance to enable them to \nsecure comparable decent safe replacement housing in the Township. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Residents respectfully request that the Court enter judgment against the \nTownship and Redevelopers:  \nA.

HOLLY GARDENS CITIZENS IN   \nACTION, INC., et al. \n \n                 Plaintiffs, \nCivil No. 08-2584 (NLH/JS) \n  v. \n \nTOWNSHIP OF MOUNT HOLLY, et al. \n \n                    Defendants. \n \nORDER  \nThis  matter  is  before  the  Court  on  the  “Motion  Against \nDefendant Township of Mount Holly for a) Enforcement of Order, \nEntered November 15, 2013; for b) Sanctions; for c) Extension of \nTime  Period  in  Which  this  Court  Shall  Retain  Subject  Matter \nJurisdiction  for  Enforcement  of  November  15,  2013  Order  from \nDecember 31, 2019 until March 31, 2020; and for d) Attorney’s Fees \nIncurred  by  Plaintiff  Angel  L.  Vera  in  Connection  with  the \nLitigation of this Motion” (“Motion”) [Doc. Nos. 258 and 259] filed \nby  plaintiff  Angel  L.  Vera  (“Vera”).    The  Court  received  the \nopposition of the Township of Mount Holly (“Township”) [Doc. No. \n261] and exercises its discretion not to hold oral argument.  FED. \nR. CIV. P. 78; L; L. CIV. R. 78.1.  The parties consented to the \njurisdiction of this Court to decide this motion.  See Doc. No. \n262.  For the reasons to be discussed in this Order, Vera’s motion \nis DENIED. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 2 of 7 PageID: 7922\n \nBackground \nThis litigation has a long and complicated fact and procedural \nhistory which has been previously set forth in several opinions \nthroughout the course of this litigation, therefore, the Court \nwill provide an abbreviated version as is relevant to this motion. \nThe initial complaint in this matter was filed on May 27, \n2008 and addressed the redevelopment of Mount Holly Gardens (the \n“Gardens”), an ethnically diverse low-income neighborhood in Mount \nHolly, New Jersey. See Compl. [Doc. No. 1].  Plaintiffs generally \nalleged the redevelopment plan for the Gardens violated the Fair \nHousing Act and their constitutional rights. Id.  Vera was added \nto the case as a named plaintiff in the third amended complaint \nfiled on March 12, 2013. See Third Am. Compl. [Doc. No. 157]. \nAfter  extensive  negotiations,  the  parties  reached  a \nsettlement which is memorialized in a lengthy and complex “Global \nSettlement Agreement” (“GSA”) executed in or about November 2013.  \nSee Global Settlement Agreement (“GSA”) [Doc. No. 215-1].  Vera \nsigned the GSA on November 1, 2013. Contrary to the assertion in \nVera’s motion, the language in the GSA confirms that Vera was \nrepresented  by  counsel  during  the  litigation  in  chief  and  in \nconnection  with  the  negotiation  and  execution  of  the  GSA.  See \nCertification of Joshua Brown, Township Manager at ¶6; see also \nGSA § 4.26.3 at 17. (“All parties are represented by counsel with \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 3 of 7 PageID: 7923\nregard to the preparation of this Settlement Agreement ….”). Per \nthe GSA, plaintiff exchanged her home located at 315 South Martin \nAve.  for  56  Lewis  Drive.  See  GSA.    Approximately  twenty  (20) \nplaintiffs agreed to essentially the same settlement terms. Id. \nVera’s closings occurred on May 11, 2018. Id.  \nThe parties’ dispute involves Vera’s claim that the Township \nis liable to pay the attorney’s fees ($6,644.00) he incurred in \nconnection with the lawyer he hired for his closings. Vera relies \non Section 4.26 of the GSA to support his motion which states in \nrelevant part: \n4.26  The  replacement  home  closings  shall  be \nconducted so as to ensure that the replacement group \nplaintiffs  do  not  bear  added  expenses  for  the \ntransaction but meet their obligations as purchasers of \nthe replacement homes. \n \n4.26.1 The Township shall require the additional \nredeveloper to be liable for all closing and settlement \ncosts customarily assumed by the seller in a Southern \nNew Jersey real estate transaction…. The Township shall \nbe liable for all other closing and settlement costs, …. \n(emphasis supplied). \n \nSee Mot. Br. at 8 [Doc. No. 259-2]. Plaintiff argues his legal \nfees are a closing cost the Township contracted to pay. Id.  Not \nsurprisingly, the Township disagrees.  The Township argues that \ncontrary  to  the  statements  in  Vera’s  motion,  plaintiff  was \nrepresented by counsel during the litigation. See Opp’n at 6.  The \nTownship  also  argues  it  did  not  pay  any  other  plaintiff’s \nattorney’s fees in connection with a closing which demonstrates it \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 4 of 7 PageID: 7924\nhas no obligation to pay for  Vera’s fees.  Id. at 8-14.   Most \nimportantly, the Township argues the GSA does not provide for the \npayment of Vera’s closing attorney’s fees and this was not the \nintent of the parties. Id. Having carefully considered the entire \nrecord, and for the reasons to be discussed, the Court rules in \nthe Township’s favor and denies Vera’s motion. \nDiscussion1 \nAt bottom, the Court must interpret the parties’ contract to \ndecide if the Township is responsible for the attorney’s fees Vera \nincurred  in  connection  with  his  real  estate  closings.    The \nconstruction and enforcement of the parties’ settlement agreement \nis governed by principles of New Jersey contract law.  Vandergrift \nv. Pennsauken School District, et al., C.A. No. 12-7646 (JS), 2017 \nWL 6566139, at *3 (D.N.J. Dec. 22, 2017).  When interpreting the \nterms of a contract, the writing must be interpreted as a whole \nand  the  terms  of  the  contract  must  be  given  their  plain  and \nordinary meaning.  Nester v. O’Donnell, 693 A.2d 1214, 1220 (N.J. \nSuper. A.D. 1997).  The Court should not torture language to create \n \n1 The Court finds that it has jurisdiction to decide the subject \nmotion.  The Court’s November 15, 2013 Order at paragraph 3 [Doc. \nNo.  215]  provides  that  the  Court  retains  jurisdiction  until \nDecember 31, 2019 to enforce the terms of the GSA.  Since Vera’s \nmotion was filed on December 31, 2019, the Court may decide the \npresent  dispute.    Further,  the  Court  declines  to  address  the \nTownship’s  argument  that  Vera’s  attorneys  have  a  conflict  of \ninterest.  If the Township intends to pursue this issue, it must \nfile a motion to disqualify counsel. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 5 of 7 PageID: 7925\nan ambiguity where one does not exist.  Schor v. FMS Financial \nCorp., 814 A.2d 1108, 1112 (N.J. Super. A.D. 2002). \nThe  Court  finds  the  language  in  the  GSA  supports  the \nTownship’s  position  that  it  is  not  responsible  for  Vera’s \nattorney’s fees.  The term “costs” in Section 4.26 of the GSA means \nwhat it says. The term “costs” refers to costs, not attorney’s \nfees.  There is nothing in the language of the GSA to indicate \nthat the term “costs” should be given anything other than its plain \nmeaning. Vera does not point to any provision in the GSA that \nspecifically requires that his attorney’s fees be paid.  Nor does \nVera cite to a single case supporting his position. Given the \nlength  and  complexity  of  the  GSA,  and  the  fact  that  numerous \nexperienced attorneys drafted the GSA, if the parties’ intended \nthat  the  attorney’s  fees  incurred  at  closing  by  a  homeowner’s \nattorney be paid by the Township, this would have been specifically \nstated.  The fact that there is not a single reference to the \npayment of a plaintiff’s attorney’s fees in the GSA is compelling.  \nThe Court will not read into the GSA a provision or requirement \nthat does not exist.  It is not insignificant that Vera appears to \nbe the only one of the multiple plaintiffs in this litigation who \nmade a separate claim for attorney’s fees.  The fact that the \nplaintiffs’ attorneys who negotiated the contract did not make a \nclaim for fees, demonstrates the parties did not intend for these \nfees  to  be  paid  by  the  Township.  Significantly,  Vera  did  not \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 6 of 7 PageID: 7926\ninclude anything to support his interpretation of the GSA from the \nplaintiffs’ attorneys who negotiated the GSA and represented Vera \nin the underlying litigation. This absence is telling. \nVera argues the Township agreed to pay all of his closing \ncosts which include attorney’s fees.  If the Court accepted this \nliteral argument it would lead to an absurd result.  For example, \nVera could claim the Township must pay his transportation costs to \nthe closings or perhaps his meal expenses for the day.  The Court \nwill not interpret the GSA to require this absurd result.  See \nEducational Impact, Inc. v. Danielson, et al., C.A. No. 14-937 \n(FLW)(LHG), 2015 WL 381332, at *7 (D.N.J. Jan. 28, 2015) (courts \nshould avoid interpreting a contract in a manner that would lead \nto an absurd result); see also Princeton v. Mercer County, 755 \nA.2d 637, 645 (N.J. Super. A.D. 2000), aff’d, 169 N.J. 135 (2001) \n(“Literalism must give way to context”).   \nHad the parties intended that Vera’s attorney’s fees be paid, \nthis should have and would have been specifically set forth in the \nGSA.  This was not done. Section 4.26 in the GSA only applies to \ncosts normally associated with a closing, such as taxes, closing \nfees, recording fees, etc.  The attorney’s fees Vera voluntarily \nincurred are not the sort of costs covered by the GSA.   \nSince  Vera’s  request  to  enforce  the  GSA  is  denied,  it \nnecessarily follows that his request for sanctions and fees are \nalso denied.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 265   Filed 07/23/20   Page 7 of 7 PageID: 7927\nAccordingly, for all the foregoing reasons,   \nIT  IS  HEREBY  ORDERED  this  23rd  day  of  July,  2020,  that \nplaintiff Angel Vera’s “Motion Against Defendant Township of Mount \nHolly for a) Enforcement of Order, Entered November 15, 2013; for \nb) Sanctions; for c) Extension of Time Period in Which this Court \nShall  Retain  Subject  Matter  Jurisdiction  for  Enforcement  of \nNovember 15, 2013 Order from December 31, 2019 until March 31, \n2020; and for d) Attorney’s Fees Incurred by Plaintiff Angel L. \nVera in Connection with the Litigation of this Motion” (“Motion”) \n[Doc.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nI.  This is a civil rights action challenging Mount Holly Township's (\"Township\") wide-\nscale redevelopment of the neighborhood known as Mt. Holly Gardens (\"Gardens\").  Plaintiffs \nare an association of residents, Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc.,  (\"CIA\"), and five \nindividual residents (\"Residents\") living in the Gardens, which is a cohesive, ethnically diverse \n2 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 3 of 43 PageID: 6363\nneighborhood within Mt. Holly Township that is predominantly African-American and Hispanic \nwith  mostly  low  and  moderate  income  families.  CIA  and  Residents  are  challenging  the \nTownship's  sweeping redevelopment project  that  is  demolishing  existing  homes,  displacing \nnumerous families, and dismantling and destroying the entire Gardens neighborhood. \n2.  The  Township  and  its  redevelopers  have  been  and  currently  are  aggressively \nimplementing their redevelopment project, ultimately seeking acquisition, through purchase and \neminent domain, and total demolition of all 329 homes within the Gardens redevelopment area \naffordable to  current and displaced families  and replacement with  new,  much higher-priced \nmarket  rate  homes  intended  for  households  that  are  more  affluent.  In  carrying  out \nredevelopment, the Township and its redevelopers have greatly increased blighted conditions and \nhave rendered the Gardens unsafe and unlivable.  Among other things, under the implied threat \nof eminent domain, the Township has systematically acquired, vacated and boarded up more \nthan  200  previously  occupied  homes-approximately two-thirds  of all  residential  properties \nwithin the Gardens-and has demolished to date approximately 70 properties. If not stopped, the \nTownship and its redevelopers will succeed in irrevocably tearing down the most identifiable \nminority community within Mt. Holly - with the highest rates of African-American and Hispanic \nhomeownership  within  Burlington  County - and permanently  displacing hundreds  of lower \nincome minority residents from their community where they will no longer be able to afford to \nlive. \n3.  In  pnor  state  court  litigation,  the  Township's  finding  of  \"blight,\"  i.e.,  its \ndetermination that the Gardens neighborhood met New Jersey's criteria for designation as an \n\"area in need of redevelopment,\" was upheld in April 2005.  However, in August 2005 and \nsubsequently upheld on appeal in 2007, CIA's and Residents' civil rights and other substantive \n3 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 4 of 43 PageID: 6364\nchallenges to the redevelopment plan were dismissed without prejudice as then not being ripe for \nadjudication. \n4.  These claims are now unquestionably ripe in light of the Township's subsequent \ndestructive implementation actions devastating the Gardens community, its adoption of a revised \nplan,  and  its  presentation  of the  Redevelopers'  proposed  general  development plao  for  the \nredeveloped  community.  Specifically,  the  Township  aod  its  redevelopers  have unlawfully \ndiscriminated against the Residents on the basis of race and national origin in violation of Title \nVIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601  e/ seq.  Furtilermore, the Township's \nactions deprive Residents of just compensation by driving down the value of their homes, while \ntile  Township has  failed  to  adequately plao or prepare for replacement housing realistically \naffordable to current and displaced residents and failed to provide adequate relocation assistaoce \nthat would enable displaced residents to purchase replacement housing. \n5.  The allegations of paragraph five are removed from the Complaiot as they relate to \ncounts that have been dismissed. \n6.  Residents  and  CIA  seek,  among  other  things,  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief \ninvalidating tile redevelopment plan; maodating iliat the Township carry out redevelopment in \ntile Gardens in a mailller haviog the least discriminatory adverse impact upon African-American \nand Hispanic households; aod prohibiting implementation without providing adequate affordable \nreplacement housing for all current and displaced Gardens residents. Residents and CIA also \nseek damages and/or just compensation sufficient for Residents to secure permanent replacement \nhousing in ilie local housing market. \nII.  JURISDICTION \n4 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 5 of 43 PageID: 6365\n7.  Jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' claims is conferred on this court by 28 u.s.c. § 1331 \n(federal question jurisdiction) in that this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States; 28 U.S.c. § 1343(a)(4) because the Plaintiffs seek equitable and other relief under \nActs of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights under Title VIII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq~; 42 U.S.c. § 3613 for civil actions under Title VIII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1968, 42  U.S.c.  § 3601  et seqo;  and 42 U.S.c. § 1983, which provides \nredress for the deprivation, under color of state law, of rights, privileges and immunities secured \nto all citizens and persons within the jurisdiction of the United States by the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States. \n8.

(\"Triad\") is a corporation doing business in New \nJersey with offices at 238 West Chestnut Avenue, Vineland, NJ 08360, which the \nTownship  and/or  Keating  hired  to  assist  with  implementation  of the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan, including but not limited to serving as property manager of \nTownship-owned rental properties, preparing the Workable Relocation Assistance \nPlan (\"WRAP\") and conducting relocation activities. \nIV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Mt. Holly Gardens Neighborhood \n48.  Mt. Holly Gardens (\"the Gardens\") is situated on 30 acres ofland within downtown \nMt. Holly Township in Burlington County, New Jersey. \n49.  It is a cohesive, racially and ethnically diverse community. \n50.  At the time the redevelopment process started in 2000, the neighborhood contained \n329 houses. \n51.  The houses were constructed during the 1950s. \n52.  Houses  are  primarily two-story buildings of solid brick construction with joists \nmade of old-growth hardwood, and are situated in rows of 8 to 10 homes set back approximately \n50 feet from the street, allowing for front and back yards. \n53.  Many  homes  are  well-maintained  and  have  attractively  landscaped  yards  and \ngardens. \n54.  Until approximately March 2004 there was a playground area of approximately \n14,000 square feet  and  a community center converted from  a dwelling unit, both which the \nTownship owned. \n12 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 13 of 43 PageID: 6373\nB.  Residents of Mt. Holly Gardens \n55. According  to  the  2000  U.S.  Census,  Burlington  County's  total  population  was \n423,394.  Of the  total  population,  Whites  comprised  323,171-76.3%;  African-Americans \ncomprised 62,476-14.8%; and Hispanics comprised 17,632-4.2%. \n56.  According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Mount Holly Township's total population was \n10,728. Of the total population, Whites comprised 7,101-66.2%; African-Americans comprised \n2,231 -20.8%; and Hispanics comprised 942 -8.8%. \n57.  The  residential  section  of  the  Gardens  redevelopment  area  corresponds \napproximately to Blocks 1000, 1001, 1003 and 1009 of U.S. Census Tract 7026.04., Burlington \nCounty, New Jersey. \n58.  Approximately 1,031  residents lived within  the Census Blocks corresponding to \nthe residential section of the Gardens redevelopment area. Within the residential section of the \nGardens  redevelopment  area,  Whites  comprised  approximately  203  residents-only  19.7%, \ncompared to 475-46.1 % -African-American residents and 297-28.8%-Hispanic residents. \n59.  Thus,  African-American  and  Hispanic  residents  comprised  the  overwhelming \nmajority-nearly 75%-{)fthe residents living in the Gardens redevelopment area. \n60.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the concentration of African-American \nand  Hispanic  residents  in  the  Gardens  was  the  highest  of any  neighborhood  in  Mt.  Holly \nTownship and much higher compared to Burlington County, while the concentration of Whites \nwas comparatively much lower. \na.  46.1 % of the Gardens redevelopment area was African-American, compared to \nonly 20.8% for Mt. Holly Township and 14.8 % for Burlington County. \n13 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 14 of 43 PageID: 6374\nb.  28.8% of the Gardens redevelopment area was Hispanic, compared to only 8.8% \nfor Mt. Holly Township and only 4.2% for Burlington County. \nc.  Only  19.7%  of the  Gardens  redevelopment  area  was  non-Hispanic,  White, \ncompared  to  66.2%  for  Mt.  Holly  Township  and  was  76.3%  for  Burlington \nCounty. \nd.  In  addition,  approximately  31.5%  of Mt.  Holly  Township's  entire  Hispanic \npopulation and approximately 21,3% of Mt.  Holly Township's entire African \nAmerican population lived within the Gardens redevelopment area, compared to \nonly 2.9% ofthe entire non-Hispanic, White population. \n61.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the median household income in the \nGardens redevelopment area was only $30,104, while the median income for the Township was \n$43,284, and the median income of Burlington County was $58,608. \n62.  According to the 2000 Census, in Census Tract 7026.04 containing the Gardens, the \nhousing characteristics were as follows: \na.  50% of the households  in  Census Tract 7026.04 were renters,  and 50% were \nhomeowners. \nb.  31 % of the African-American households were homeowners while the percentage \nin the entire Township was 13%, and the percentage in the County was 11 %. \nc.  17% of the Hispanic households were homeowners while the percentage in the \nentire Township was 8%, and the percentage in the County was 2%. \nd.  81 % of the owner-occupied households in Census Tract 7026.4 had lived in their \nhomes for at least 9 years, while 72% of the renter-occupied households had lived \nin their homes for at least 5 years. \n14 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 15 of 43 PageID: 6375\ne.  The median cost of homeowners hip for owner-occupied homes with mortgages in \nCensus  Tract  7026.04  was  only  $969  a  month,  compared  to  $1,536  for  the \nTownship and $1,393 for the County. \n63.  According to the 2000 Census, the Gardens neighborhood therefore had among the \nhighest rates of African-American and Hispanic home ownership in Burlington County. \n64.  Despite  the  lower  incomes  of  the  Gardens'  households,  the  community  IS \nremarkably stable and has many longtime residents. \n65.  Residents  have  a  strong  sense  of community  and  like  that  it  IS  racially  and \nethnically diverse. \n66.  Many Gardens residents have family and friends living in the neighborhood. \n67.  Residents enjoy the convenient location of the Gardens and its proximity to schools, \nemployment, businesses, and downtown. \n68.  The stability of the Gardens neighborhood is attributable in part to lower housing \ncosts than that of Mt. Holly and Burlington County, making the Gardens more affordable for \nlower income households. \n69.  According to a more recent survey conducted by Triad in July 2006, the average \nmonthly homeowner cost being paid in the Gardens is $445 and the average rent is $696. \n70.  In addition, many longtime homeowners of the Gardens, particularly seniors, paid \noff their mortgages in full and can afford to keep their homes, although they would not be able to \npurchase much higher-priced homes in the current real estate market on their present incomes. \n71.  According to a survey conducted by planners commissioned by the Township in \n2000, 90% of the households in the Gardens had annual incomes below $40,000, 43% earned \nbetween $20,000 and $40,000, and nearly half--47%-earned less than $20,000. \n15 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 16 of 43 PageID: 6376\nC.  Redevelopment Activities Before 2002 \n72.  For  almost  thirty  years,  community  members  and  Mt.  Holly  Township  have \nengaged in various planning initiatives to improve living conditions in the neighborhood. \n73.  These  planning  initiatives  included  a  community-led  effort  in  the  1980's  that \nresulted  in  development of a  strategy  to  increase  the  homeownership  rate  through targeted \nproperty  acquisition  and  rehabilitation;  however,  this  strategy  was  never  adopted  by  the \nTownship. \n74.  Another planning initiative was a housing rehabilitation program lmown as \"Mt. \nHolly 2000.\"  Through this program, eleven homeowners in the Gardens obtained grants and \nloans to fix up their properties. \n75.  The Township subsequently decided not to support such revitalization efforts.  It \ninstead began to plan for a sweeping redevelopment of the entire community that would involve \nacquisition and demolition of most or all of the Gardens homes. \n76.  In 2000, the Township began to purchase properties in the Gardens and leave them \nvacant \n77.  In 2000, the Council also commissioned a private firm, THP, Inc., to investigate \nwhether the Gardens neighborhood met the criteria of an \"area in need of redevelopment\" within \nthe meaning ofN.J.S.A\" 40A:12A-l et. seq. \n78.  In  November 2000,  THP,  Inc.  prepared a report  entitled  \"Redevelopment Area \nDetermination Report\" (\"2000 Redevelopment Report\"), which it presented to the Council. \n79.  As  part  of the  preparation  of this  2000  Redevelopment  Report,  the  plal1l1ers \nconducted a survey of the Gardens residents. \n16 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 17 of 43 PageID: 6377\n80.  The survey demonstrated that when questioned about the  Township's plans  for \nredevelopment, residents  were  concerned about displacement  and that more  than 2/3  of the \nresidents stated tbat they would prefer to remain living in the Gardens. \nD.  Redevelopment Planning and Adoption of Redevelopment Plan \n81.  The Township adopted a Master Plan pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law, \nNJ.S.A. 40:55D-l et seq., dated April 13, 2000. \n82.  The Master Plan set forth certain goals, which included improving the qualifY of \nMount Holly's housing stock, upgrading the Gardens Area, and utilizing the LRHL to Mount \nHolly's best advantage. \n83.  With regard to the upgrade of the Gardens area, the Master Plan stated that one \nobjective of this Master Plan is to upgrade the quality of units and the character of area, and that \nmeasures should be taken to reduce the overall density in the Gardens Area, to rehabilitate \ndeteriorated units, and to provide additional amenities. \n84.  In the land use plan element, the Master Plan characterizes the Gardens as one of \ntwo \"high density areas\" containing some deteriorated units, high proportion of rental properties, \nand with overcrowding an identified problem. The Master Plan recommended \n\"redevelopment/revitalization\" to allow for reduction of density, modernization of housing stock, \nand improvement to overall perception of the area. \n85.  On  July  30,  2002,  Council  passed  Resolution  No.  2002-166  authorizing  the \nTownship's Planning Board to undertake a preliminary investigation and to hold a public hearing \nto determine whether the Gardens neighborhood was an area in need of redevelopment. \n86.  The Planning Board subsequently received a report prepared by TIIP, Inc. entitled \n\"Redevelopment Area Determination Report,\" dated September 3, 2002. \n17 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 18 of 43 PageID: 6378\n87.  The  September 3,  2002  Redevelopment Area Determination Report was  almost \nidentical to the 2000 Redevelopment Report prepared for Council. \n88.  On September 16, 2002, the Planning Board held the first public hearing on the \nquestion whether the Gardens should be designated as a redevelopment area. \n89.  On October 21,2002, the Planning Board passed Resolntion No. 2002-10, adopting \nthe findings and conclusions of the 2002 Redevelopment Report and recommending that the \nTownship Council designate the Gardens neighborhood as a \"redevelopment area\" within the \nmeaning ofN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-I et seq. \n90.  On October 28, 2002, the Council passed Resolution No. 2002-217, accepting the \nfactual  findings  of  the  2002  Redevelopment  Report,  accepting  the  Planning  Board's \nrecommendations and formally designating the  Gardens neighborhood as  an area in  need of \nredevelopment underN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-I et seq. \n91.  Resolution No. 2002-217 did not state or otherwise indicate that by designating the \nGardens neighborhood as  an area in need of redevelopment, homes in the Gardens would be \ndemolished. \n92.  At the  Planning Board hearing and at the Council  meeting,  Township officials \nmisled  Residents  by  telling  them  that  inclnding  their  properties  in  an  area  in  need  of \nredevelopment did not mean that the Township would take their properties by eminent domain. \n93.  In April 2003, the  Council publicly released a document entitled \"The Gardens \nArea Redevelopment Plan\" (\"Gardens Redevelopment Plan\"). \n94.  The Gardens Redevelopment Plan provided for the following: \na.  Total demolition of all the homes in tlle neighborhood and relocation of all the \nresidents. \n18 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 19 of 43 PageID: 6379\nb.  Building ISO new housing units. \nc.  No construction of any affordable housing units. \nd.  No guarantee that any new housing in the redevelopment community would be \nmade available for Gardens residents either before or after displacement. \ne.  No guarantee that any new housing in the redevelopment community would be \nrealistically affordable for Gardens residents. \nf.  Building only 30 rental units, available only to seniors. \n95.  The proposed 180 new units would be much more expensive than existing homes; \ntherefore, the plan would permanently displace current residents who are predominately low-\nmcome. \n96.  On August II, 2003, the Township held a public hearing on the adoption of the \nGardens Redevelopment Plan. \n97.  Over 100 residents appeared before the Council protesting against the proposed \nredevelopment plan and the demolition of their homes. \n9S.  Among the objections raised by the residents were the following: \na.  They feel a strong sense of community and have pride in the community. \nMany  are  long-term  residents.  They  feel  surrounded by  family  and \nfriends.  They like that it is racially and ethnically diverse. \nb.  Many residents are low-income.  Some had been homeless in the past. \nThey are fearful that they will not be able to afford tl1e new units that \nwere being planned for construction and that they will not be able to find \nother housing in the area they could afford. \n19 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 20 of 43 PageID: 6380\nc.  Some residents, including some elderly homeowners, have paid off their \nmortgages.  They are afraid that if they lose their homes they will never \nbe able to purchase another one. \n99.  Also on August 11, 2003, Plaintiff CIA submitted to the Township Council detailed \nwritten objections to the Gardens Redevelopment Plan with proposed alternatives to demolition \nof the residents' homes, including that the Gardens Redevelopment Plan was drafted without \nmeaningful input from the residents and in disregard of the residents' needs; that it discriminated \nagainst African-American and Hispanic residents on the basis of race and ethnicity; that it did \nnot realistically provide for housing that was decent and affordable for the residents, either as to \nunits to be newly constructed in the Gardens area or replacement housing elsewhere in Mt. Holly \nTownship  or Burlington County;  and  that  it would cause  severe  hardship  by forcing  most \nresidents, many of whom have lived in the Gardens for many years, to lose their homes and \nmove out of their community. \n100.  On  September  8,  2003,  the  Township  Council  passed  Ordinance  No.  2003-12 \nadopting the Gardens Redevelopment Plan as originally proposed. \nIOJ.  On October 23, 2003, Plaintiffs CIA and 35 individual residents filed an action in \nthe Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Docket No. BUR-L-003027-03, challenging \nthe designation of the Gardens as  an area in need of redevelopment and the adoption of the \nGardens Redevelopment Plan under state law and on civil rights and constitutional grounds. \n102.  In February 2005, the Township Council directed the Planning Board to consider \namending the Gardens Redevelopment Plan. \n103.  On February 21,  2005,  the  Planning Board held  a public hearing concerning a \nrevised redevelopment plan called the West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan (WR Redevelopment \n20 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 21 of 43 PageID: 6381\nPlan),  which encompassed the  Gardens neighborhood and  increased the area for commercial \nredevelopment. \n104.  The WR Redevelopment Plan proposed the following: \na.  228 new residential units. \nb.  Permitted residential uses increased up to 50% for two-family dwellings, \nup to 33% for townhouse/senior apartment combination dwellings, and \nup to 33% for townhouses.  The permitted uses; however, did not include \nany multifamily rental units. \nc.  Demolition  of existing  homes  and  new  construction  of  the  above \npermitted uses. \nd.  Possible rehabilitation  of existing units,  but rehabilitation was  purely \noptional with no specified amount or percentage of existing residential \nunits that were to be rehabilitated. \ne.  Only  10% of the 228  dwelling units-a total  of 23-to be affordable \nhousing units, with the remaining 205 units to be market rate units. \nf.  Commercial development in the area adjacent to the Mt. Holly Bypass \nRoad on the western edge of the redevelopment area. \n105.  Many Gardens residents appeared and spoke at the Planning Board hearing on \nFebruary 21, 2005, raising the same objections to the proposed WR Redevelopment Plan that \nthey had raised concerning the Gardens Redevelopment Plan. \n106.  Also  on  February  21,  2005,  a  planning  expert,  Alan  Mallach,  FAICP,  PP, \nsubmitted  a  report  and  testified  on  behalf of the  residents  regarding  the  proposed  WR \nRedevelopment Plan. \n21 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 22 of 43 PageID: 6382\n107.  In the report, Mr. Mallach opined that the rehabilitation option under the Plan was \nat best illusory and that given the lower-income status of most of the Gardens residents, very few \nif any of the families could afford the 205 market rate units. \n108.  Mr.  Mallach  also  testified  that  the  Township  could  improve  the  Gardens \ncommunity using much less drastic alternatives than the large-scale acquisition and demolition \ncalled for the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n109.  In addition, Plaintiff CIA submitted detailed written comments to the Planning \nBoard on February 21,2005, raising numerous objections and recommendations, including: that \nthe WR Redevelopment Plan should mandate as  an  overriding  goal  that existing homes be \nrehabilitated  instead  of  demolished  to  avoid  displacement  of  residents;  that  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan should permit multifamily rental housing-which constituted at least half \nof the  existing  residential  units  in  the  Gardens-among  the  permitted  uses;  that  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan unlawfully discriminated against African-American and Hispanic residents \non the basis of race and etlmicity; and that the WR Redevelopment Plan's limit of 23 affordable \nhousing units was a misapplication of the new growth share regulations promulgated by the New \nJersey Council on Affordable Housing (\"COAH\") and was otherwise contrary to the  general \nwelfare under the New Jersey Constitution. \n110.  At the conclusion of the public hearing on February 21, 2005, the Planning Board \npassed a resolution recommending that the Council adopt the WR Redevelopment Plan, with the \nrecommendation  to  increase  the  townhouse  permitted  use  to  up  to  75%  of the  total  228 \nresidential units. \nIII.  The Planning Board did not recommend adoption of any amendments addressing \nthe concerns raised by the residents and plaintiffs. \n22 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 23 of 43 PageID: 6383\n112.  On March 14, 2005, the Township Council held a public hearing on the adoption \nof the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n113.  Many  residents  appeared  and  voiced  similar  concerns  against  the  WR \nRedevelopment Plan as stated before the Planning Board. \n114.  Plaintiffs  also  submitted  written  comments  similar to  those  presented  to  the \nPlanning Board. \n115.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Township Council adopted Ordinance 2005-\n07, adopting the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n116.  The Township Council disregarded all of the input it received from the Gardens \nresidents and failed to address the residents' objections and concerns. \n117.  The Township officials made false, misleading, and/or inaccurate statements in \nresponse to public comments regarding the designation of the Gardens community as an area in \nneed of redevelopment and regarding the adoption of the Gardens Redevelopment Plan and the \nWR Redevelopment Plan. \n118.  The Township also took other actions to avoid informing the residents of its plans \nand to minimize public comment and participation in the redevelopment process. \n119.  CIA and the other plaintiffs in the state court litigation amended their complaint \nto  allege  that  the  adoption  of the  WR  Redevelopment  Plan  was  in  violation  of state \nredevelopment law, civil rights laws, and the federal and state constitutions. \n120.  On April 17, 2005, the Superior Court, the Hon. John Sweeney, held a bench trial \non the issues of whether the Gardens met the  statutory criteria of a redevelopment area and \nwhether the WR Redevelopment Plan complied with the requirements of LRHL.  On May 5, \n23 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 24 of 43 PageID: 6384\n2005, the court ruled in favor of the Township and entered judgment dismissing the prerogative \nwrit claims. \n121.  On Augnst 30, 2005, Judge Sweeney granted the Township summary judgment \ndismissing without prejudice the residents' civil rights and constitntional claims upon finding \nthat they were not ripe for adjndication. \n122.  On July 5, 2007, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the \nrulings of the trial court.  On December II, 2007, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied the \nresidents' petition for certification, and on February 5, 2008, the New Jersey Supreme Court \ndenied the residents' motion for reconsideration. \n123.  The Gardens redevelopment project is the only redevelopment initiative in Mt. \nHolly Township during the last  10 years  that calls for large-scale demolition of homes  and \ndisplacement of residents. \n124.  The Township conducted a reexamination of its Master Plan in June 2007. \n125.  The Master Plan Reexamination repeats the  discussion of the  Gardens  in the \nMaster Plan, and notes  that the Township is improving the Gardens Area by declaring  it a \nredevelopment area and adopting the WR Redevelopment Plan, which includes residential and \nnon-residential properties, as recommended in the Master Plan. \n126.  The  Reexamination  includes  a  section  of specific  recommendations,  which \nincorporate  the  specific  proposals  set  out  in  the  WR Redevelopment  Plan  for  Residential, \nCommercial, Limited Industrial, and open space uses.  The Reexamination does not propose any \nchanges to the Master Plan with regard to the Gardens Area. \nE.  Township's and Redevelopers' Implementation ofthe Redevelopment Plan \n1.  Acquisition of Properties \n24 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 25 of 43 PageID: 6385\n127.  By 2002, at the time the Gardens Plan was being considered by the  Planning \nBoard and Council, the Township had acquired a total of 20 units, which it had intentionally left \nvacaut and boarded up rather than attempting to renovate or sell them. \n128.  On November 10, 2003, the Township Council enacted Ordinance No. 2003-37, \nauthorizing  Township  officials  to  negotiate  and acquire  all  of the properties  located  in the \nGardens redevelopment area by voluntary sale or, if necessary, by condemnation, at a price not \nto exceed fair market value. \n129.  After adoption of the WR Redevelopment Plan in 2005, the Township increased \nits efforts to acquire homes in the Gardens. \n130.  In or about March 2005, the Township purchased the 62 rental properties from \nFry Properties for approximately $53,000 per unit totaling $3.27 million. \n131.  In  or  about  April  2006,  the  Township  obtained  an  appraisal  report,  which \ndetermined that the value of a one-bedroom house in the Gardens was $32,000, a two-bedroom \nhouse was $39,000, and a three-bedroom house was $49,000. \n132.  Since 2006, the Township has purchased numerous homes at prices ranging from \n$32,000  to  $49,000,  except for  two purchases at $64,000 and  one purchase at  $81,000  for \nproperties that contained two units converted into one larger home. \n133.  By December 2007, the Township had acquired a total of219 residential units out \nof the 329 original homes in the Gardens redevelopment area. Most ofthese residential units had \nbeen occupied by tenants or homeowners before the Township acquired them. The Township had \ndemolished 42 of its acquired units, and kept 165 of the remaining 177 units vacant and boarded. \n134.  Because the Township had not re-rented or re-sold its units upon acquisition, the \nTownship's acquisitions increased the overall vacancy rate in the Gardens to nearly 65%. \n25 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 26 of 43 PageID: 6386\n135.  Since December 2007, the Township has demolished an additional 31 residential \nunits, for a total 73 demolished units, \n136.  The only measures the Township has taken to secure its vacant properties has to \nput particle board panels on the windows and to plaster large orange \"no trespassing signs\" on \nthem. \n137.  The Township has not adequately secured or maintained the houses and yards of \nthe  properties  it  owns,  allowing  these  properties  to  deteriorate  and  become  vandalized  by \ntrespassers. \n138.  The vacant Township-owned properties have caused and are continuing to cause a \nseverely  blighting  and  deleterious  effect  on  the  Gardens  neighborhood,  created  risk  of \ninfestation, fire hazards, and mold, and encouraged further disinvestment in the cOlll1llunity. \n139.  The Township and Redevelopers have made and are continuing to make offers to \nGardens property owners to purchase units for the prices of $32,000 for a one-bedroom house, \n$39,000 for a two-bedroom house, and $49,000 for a three-bedroom house. \n140.  The Township recently initiated the eminent domain process against one absentee \nproperty owner to acquire additional properties. \n141.  On April 12,2008, the Township Council introduced and passed on first reading \nOrdinance 2008-12. The Ordinance states that the Township is or will be the owner of all of the \nproperties in the redevelopment area, and authorizes the Mayor, and/or the Township Manager \nand/or Township Clerk to negotiate and execute a Purchase and Sale Agreement, and all other \nnecessary documents, between the Township and Redevelopers for all of the properties for the \nminimum purchase price of $9 million and to execute any documents necessary to effectuate the \nsale, including any documents that may be required for Eminent Domain proceedings. \n26 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 27 of 43 PageID: 6387\n2.  Selection of Redevelopers \n142.  On February 15, 2006, the Township executed a Redevelopment Agreement with \nDefendant Keating. \n143.  In or about March 2006, Keating hired Triad to conduct the relocation activities \nassociated with the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n144.  Pursuant to Exhibit C of the Redevelopment Agreement, Keating was to form a \nsingle purpose limited liability corporation with another redeveloper, Pennrose Properties, with \nKeating assigning its rights and obligations under the Redevelopment Agreement to the newly \nformed  LLC  and maintaining majority  ownership.  Upon information and belief,  the  single \npurpose limited liability corporation described in Exhibit C of the Redevelopment Agreement \nhas not yet been formed and is presently not in existence. \n145.  Keating subsequently began to take various actions to move the redevelopment \nproject forward including obtaining a survey; negotiating on behalf of the Township for the \nacquisition of a number of properties;  meeting with  various professionals  such  as  planners, \narchitects, and engineers; and submitting applications for permits and approvals. \n146.  On  February  23,  2007,  the  Redevelopers  became  responsible  for  property \nmanagement ofthe Township-owned properties. \n27 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 28 of 43 PageID: 6388\n3.  Relocation of Gardens Residents \n147.  On  September  28,  2006,  the  Township  submitted  a  Workable  Relocation \nAssistance Plan (\"WRAP\"), prepared by Defendant Triad, to the New Jersey Department of \nCommunity Affairs. \n148.  The WRAP provided the following: \na.  Proposed relocation of all current Gardens residents. \nb.  A \"Right of First Opportunity\" for residents to return to the Gardens area \nafter the redevelopment project is completed. \nc.  No provision that any replacement units realistically affordable to the \nresidents would be created in the Gardens \nd.  No provision that any replacement units realistically affordable to  the \nresidents would be created in any other areas in the Township or in the \nsurrounding region. \ne.  All  residents  on  August  I,  2006,  would  be  eligible  for  relocation \nassistance. \nf.  Qualified  resident  homeowners  would  be  eligible,  in  addition  to  the \n$15,000.00 required by N.J.A.C.  5:11-3.7(a), for a $20,000 no-interest \nloan payable if and when the relocated homeowner sold the replacement \ndwelling. \ng.  Qualified  tenants  who  moved  into  non-subsidized  rental  units  were \neligible for up to $4,000.00 in assistance as provided by N.lA-C. 5: 11-\n3.5 and additional assistance up to $3,500.00. \n28 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 29 of 43 PageID: 6389\nh.  However, homeowners or tenants who used relocation funds to move out \nthe Gardens would not be eligible for additional relocation funds to return \nto the Gardens  if  and  when  any  affordable  units  were  ultimately \nconstructed. \n149.  In November 2006, the Township received notification from the Department of \nCommunity Affairs that the WRAP was approved. \n150.  On  November  15,  2006,  Triad  opened  an  office  the  Gardens  to  conduct \nill \nrelocation activities. \n151.  Triad staff began to send letters and notices to tenant households asking them to \ncome in for interviews. \n152.  After assessing their housing needs, Triad staff started to make efforts to locate \nhousing for these households outside of the Gardens. \n153.  The Township did not provide any relocation assistance to residents who moved \nout ofthe Gardens prior to November 2006. \n154.  Since the WRAP was approved in November, 2006 through January, 2008, the \nTownship paid relocation funds to 62 families to move out of the Gardens. \n155.  Of these 62 households, 43, or 69%, were relocated outside ofM!. Holly. \n4.  Demolition of Units \n156.  The  Township  and  Redevelopers  have  and  are  continuing  to  dismantle  the \nGardens community by demolishing homes in the Gardens. \n157.  As  of May 2008, the Township has demolished a total of 73  residential units, \nmost of which were previously occupied by tenants or homeowners. \n29 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 30 of 43 PageID: 6390\n158.  Although the Township claimed that the demolitions of the houses were necessary \nfor  health  and  safety  concerns,  the  units  were  generally  structurally  sound,  capable  of \nrehabilitation, and did not pose a threat to public safety. \n159.  To the extent the units were in poor condition and being used by trespassers, this \nwas a result of the Township's failure to take measures to adequately secure and maintain them. \n5.  Reduction in Municipal Services \n160.  Starting in 2000, before the Township even initiated the formal redevelopment \nplanning process, the Township itself began to create blighted conditions in the Gardens. \n161.  Starting in 2000 and continuing during the course of the redevelopment process, \nthe Township neglected the needs of the Gardens neighborhood by failing to apply for and utilize \navailable funding for community improvements and housing rehabilitation. \n162.  From  January  1999  to  the  present,  the  Township  entered  into  regional \ncontribution agreements pursuant to the New Jersey Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et \nseq., with the municipalities of Moorestown, Hainesport, and Westhampton, with the Township \nreceiving  more  than  $4  million  to  rehabilitate  218  residential  units  occupied  by  low  and \nmoderate income households within Mount Holly. \n163.  The Township has not at any time allocated or used any funds from the regional \ncontribution agreements to rehabilitate homes in the Gardens. \n164.  The Township failed to utilize a $25,000 grant from the New Jersey Department \nof Community Affairs earmarked for social, educational, and recreational programs for residents \nat the Gardens community center and in July, 2003 was forced to return the unspent funds. \n165.  In 2004, the Township removed the only playground equipment in the Gardens \nand refused to replace it. \n30 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 31 of 43 PageID: 6391\n166.  The Township  also  failed  to  conduct  proper code  enforcement,  prompt  trash \nremoval, adequate policing, and other basic services needed by the Gardens residents. \n167.  The Township twice used its vacant properties in the Gardens to  conduct live \npolice tactical training, bringing in numerous police officers and vehicles into the Gardens in the \nearly morning hours, without providing advance notice to residents in the neighborhood. \n168.  The Township'S failure to provide adequate and proper municipal services has \nnegatively impacted upon the community and decreased the quality oflife for residents. \n169.  In spite of the Township's actions, Gardens residents, through their own efforts, \ncontinued to combat significant deterioration of their neighborhood and tried to preserve their \nquality of life. \nF.  Continued Planning and Changes to WR Redevelopment Plan \n170.  On March 9, March 23, and April 5, 2006, the Redevelopers held three meetings \nwith Gardens residents. \n171.  The residents  participating m these  meetings  thought that the  purpose  of the \nmeetings was to consider revisions to the redevelopment plan. \n172.  At  all  three  of  the  meetings,  Gardens  residents  gave  input  about  the \nredevelopment process and stated that they did not want to lose their homes or to be moved out \nof the Gardens. \n173.  The  Gardens  residents  presented  to  the  Redevelopers  a  list  of proposals  for \nrevising the WR Redevelopment Plan, which included a guarantee of affordable replacement \nunits for all residents to be displaced who wished to remain in the Gardens. \n174.  At the third meeting, resident surveys were distributed. \n31 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 32 of 43 PageID: 6392\n175.  In  July of 2006, Triad completed the resident survey process.  169 households \nresponded, including 107 tenant households and 60 homeowners. \n176.  The Triad survey showed that 120 out of the 169 families were interested in either \npurchasing or renting a new home in the Gardens, only 64 families were interested in purchasing \nor renting outside of the Gardens, and only 8 households were interested in selling their property. \n177.  In or about October 2006, the Township and Redevelopers notified the residents \nof the completion of the Relocation Plan. \n178.  The WRAP stated that 560 units were being planned for the redevelopment area. \n179.  During  the  period  between  February  of  2006  and  September  2007,  the \nRedevelopers prepared and revised approximately eight conceptual plans for the redevelopment \narea, referred to by the Township as \"concept plans\". \n180.  Since the adoption of the WR Redevelopment Plan, the Township Council has \nconducted many discussions during closed executive session. \n181.  The Township did not provide any public notice or conduct any public meetings \nregarding the concept plans that were being prepared by the Redevelopers or refer them to the \nPlanning Board for review \n182.  On or about September 24,2007, the Township Council approved a concept plan \nduring a closed executive session, in violation of the Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:40-\n6 et seq.  Council did not notify  the  public about  its  review of the  concept plan, offer any \nopportunity for public  input,  or provide any subsequent information to  the public about the \nactions  taken  during  the  executive  session.  The concept plan  proposed construction of 203 \nmarket rate and 25  COAH income restricted apartments and 261  market rate and 31  COAH \ntownhouses. \n32 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 33 of 43 PageID: 6393\n183.  On September 8, 2008 the Township Council passed on first reading Ordinance \n2008-25,  adopting a Revised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan (Revised WR Redevelopment \nPlan), and referred it to the Planning Board for review .. \n184.  The  Revised  WR  Redevelopment  Plan  contains,  inter  alia,  the  following \nprovISIons: \n(a) It includes as objectives increasing the number of owner-occupied dwelling \nunits  by  increasing  homeownership  opportunities  for  existing  and  future \nresidents and ensuring that new dwelling units remain affordable. \n(b) It calls for acquisition and demolition of all existing homes in the Gardens. \n(c) It proposes construction of up to 520 housing units and 54,000 square feet of \ncommercial space in the redevelopment area. Up to 75% of the housing units \nmay be townhouses and up to 50% may be apartments. \n(d) The Land Use Plan proposes situating the apartments on a vacant land area \nnorth  of the  Gardens,  the  commercial  district  on  the  western  side of the \nredevelopment area along the Mt Holly Bypass Road, and the townhouses on \nthe eastern and southern portions of the redevelopment area. \n(e) It proposes the replacement of the II deed-restricted houses in the Gardens, \nand creation of 45 additional deed-restricted \"affordable units\", and states that \nthe  current occupants  of the  existing  11  deed-restricted  units  would have \npriority for the replacement units, without any provision for the replacement \nof the  other  273  units  fornlerly  occupied  by  predominately  low  income \nfamilies and without any guarantee that any of the affordable units would be \n33 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 34 of 43 PageID: 6394\nrealistically affordable to current and former Gardens residents and would be \nmade available prior to displacement. \n(1)  The Revised WR Redevelopment Plan acknowledges that it is  inconsistent \nwith  the  Township  Master  Plan because  it  does  not  reduce  density  and \nbecause  it  calls  for  total  demolition  rather  than  rehabilitation  of existing \nhomes, but concludes that tbis inconsistency is warranted based on economic \nconditions and redeveloper preference. The Plan states that it there would be \nno adverse impacts to neighboring Westhampton Township land uses and that \nthe Plan is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. \n185.  On September 9, 2008 the Township and Redevelopers held a public meeting at \nwhich  the  Redevelopers  presented  their  proposed  plans  for  redevelopment.  This  general \ndevelopment plan proposed construction of 228 luxury rental units, and 292 townhouses, totaling \n520 housing units, along with 54,000 square feet of commercial development. The construction \nwould take place in phases, with the Phase IA to consist of the apartments and 60 townhouses to \nbe  built on  vacant  land just north  of the  Gardens,  Phase IB  to  consist of the  commercial \ndevelopment to be situated along the Mt Holly Bypass, where North and South Martin Avenues \nare currently located, and Phases II and III to consist of additional townhouse development in the \neastern portion of the Gardens. The Redevelopers' proposal called for 56 affordable units to be \ninterspersed among the remaining 464 marlcet-rate units. \n186.  On  September  15,  2008  the  Planning  Board  reviewed  the  Revised  WR \nRedevelopment  Plan  and  heard  public  comment.  The  Planning  Board  members  and  their \nprofessional  consultants  had  not  been  previously  involved  in  developing  or evaluating  the \nRevised Plan. Several Gardens residents appeared before the Planning Board and objected to the \n34 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 35 of 43 PageID: 6395\nRevised WR Redevelopment Plan because it required taking of their homes and failed to provide \naffordable replacement housing. Counsel for the residents also testified and submitted written \nobjections.  The  Planning Board recommended adoption  of the  Revised WR Redevelopment \nPlan, without meaningful consideration of the residents' objections. \n187.  On  September  22,  2008  the  Township  Council  held  a  public  hearing  and \nconsidered  the  Ordinance  to  adopt  the  Revised  WR Redevelopment Plan.  Several  Gardens \nresidents again appeared and objected to Revised WR Redevelopment Plan.  Counsel for the \nresidents also testified and again submitted written objections. The Council voted to adopt the \nOrdinance on second reading, without meaningful consideration of the residents' objections. \nG.  Failnre to Provide Affordable Replacement Units \n188.  The Township has estimated that the prices of the new townhouses to be built in \nthe redevelopment area will range from $200,000 to 275,000 and that apartments will rent at \napproximately $1.65 per square foot,  with a one-bedroom unit renting for $1,230 per month. \nThe Redevelopers stated at the public meeting that the apartments are to be priced above current \nmarket prices, and the first set of townhouses are expected to cost $240,000. \n189.  Nearly all Gardens residents canoot afford to purchase or rent the new units. \n190.  The affordable housing provision in the Revised WR Redevelopment Plan does \nnot constitute adequate replacement housing because it proposes to  replace the 329 Gardens \nhomes with only 56  affordable units, without any guarantee that even any of these 56 units \nwould be realistically affordable or available to Gardens residents. \nH. Harm to Residents and CIA by Township's and Redeveloper's Actions \n191.  By acquiring and vacating properties, failing to maintain the properties it owns, \nreducing municipal services, demolishing units, and creating increasingly blighted conditions in \n35 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 36 of 43 PageID: 6396\nthe Gardens, the Township and Redevelopers have interfered and are continning to  severely \ninterfere with the Gardens residents' use and enjoyment of their property and to otherwise injure \nGardens residents. \n192.  Gardens residents risk losing their financial investments in their homes if they \ncontinue to make improvements or repairs. \n193.  Because the Township's and Redeveloper's actions have created severely blighted \nconditions  and  greatly  lowered  property  values,  and  because  of the  imminent  threat  of \ncondemnation, Gardens residents are unable to sell their home on the private market at a price \nthat  provides just compensation  and  that  would  enable  them  to  find  alternate  comparable \nhousing. \n194.  The  Township's  proposed  prices  for  purchase  of the  properties  also  do  not \nconstitute just compensation and are inadequate to enable residents to purchase decent, safe, and \naffordable comparable replacement housing. \n195.  Because  of  the  Township-caused  increased  vacancy  rate,  proliferation  of \nabandoned home, and ugly appearance of the neighborhood, Gardens residents increasingly fear \nfor their security and safety, experience pest infestation and mold, cannot enjoy spending time in \ntheir yards and open areas, and are embarrassed to have family and friends visit. \n196.  Gardens residents have experienced and are continuing to experience great stress, \nanxiety, and grief because of their fear ofiosing their homes and their strong community ties and \nbecoming unable to find adequate affordable replacement housing. \n197.  Many  former  Gardens  residents  have  moved  out  of the  Gardens  conmlUnity \nbecause the community had become such an undesirable and unsafe place to live and because \neventual eviction or condenmation by the Township appeared inevitable. \n36 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 37 of 43 PageID: 6397\n198.  Many former Gardens residents who moved out of the Gardens under threat of \ncondemnation  or  eviction  have  not  been  able  to  find  comparable  replacement  housing  at \nlocations as desirable as  the  Gardens community and have been forced  to  live under worse \nconditions and/or pay higher housing costs. \n199.  The Township's and Redeveloper's actions have harmed CIA by impeding its \nability to organize residents and operate effectively as a representative organization. \n200.  The Township's and Redeveloper's concerted actions render ripe for adjudication \nthe civil rights and constitutional claims that were dismissed by the state court without prejudice \nfor lack of ripeness, including but not limited to the following: \n( a) Actions to  effectuate the redevelopment of the Gardens between March of \n2005  and  the  present,  including  the  selection  of the  Redeveloper,  the \nexecution of the Redeveloper Agreement, the preparation of the WRAP, the \nacquisition,  vacation,  and  demolition of properties, the  relocation of tow \nthirds of the residents, the creation of severely blighted living conditions, the \nfailure  to provide affordable replacement housing to those being displaced, \nand the injury suffered by the Residents as a result of these actions; \n(b) The Township's formal  adoption of a third, revised redevelopment plan in \nSeptember 2008-five years after the Township's first redevelopment plan in \n2003-that specifically details the number, type, and affordability levels of \nthe housing units; \n(c) The Township's preparation of a Redeveloper general development plan that \nprovides details concerning the type and price of the housing units. \n37 \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 204   Filed 11/15/13   Page 38 of 43 PageID: 6398\nFIRST COUNT \nUNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT, \n42 U.S.c. § 3601 et seq. \n201.  Residents  and  CIA  reallege  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  allegations  In  all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein. \n202.  By the actions described above, the Township and Redevelopers have violated and \ncontinue to violate the rights of plaintiffs under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nand implementing regulations by: \na.  Making unavailable or denying dwellings to persons because of race, color and \nnational origin, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and implementing regnlations; \nb.  Discriminating  on  the  basis  of race,  color  or  national  origin  in  the  terms, \nconditions or privileges of services or facilities  in  connection with the sale or \nrental  of a  swelling  in  violation  of 42  U.S.C.  §  3604(b)  and  implementing \nregulations; and \nc.

Appellants, \nan association of Gardens residents organized under the name \nMt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, and 23 current and \nformer  residents  of  the neighbo rhood  (collectively  the \n“Residents”)  filed  suit against t he  Township  alleging \nviolations of various anti-discrimination laws.   \n \nBefore the Township filed an Answer or discovery on \nthese allegations had taken place, the Distric t Court granted \nsummary judgment to the Township.  Because the District \n4 \n\nCourt  misapplied  the  standard f or  deciding  whether  the \nResidents could establish a prima facie case under Title VIII \nand because it did not draw all reasonable inferences in the \nResidents’ favor, we will reverse.  \n \nI.1 \n \nThe  homes  in this di spute  are located in  a  30-acre \nneighborhood called the Gardens in the Township of Mount \nHolly in Burlington County, New Jersey.  The Gardens is the \nonly neighborhood in the Township comprised predominantly \nof African-American  and Hispanic residents.  It is poor—\nalmost all of its residents earn less than 80% of the area’s \nmedian income; with most earning much less.   \n \nThe  3292  homes  in th e  Gardens  are  predominantly \ntwo-story  buildings  made out of solid brick.  Built in the \n1950s, the homes are attached in rows of  8 to 10 and are set  \nback  from the curving streets  to allow for front and back \nyards, with alleys running behind each housing block.  Two \nmajor  commercial  districts  abut oppo site  sides of   the \nneighborhood,  which  is  only  a  mile  away  from  the  major \n                                              \n1 Because this is an  appeal from a motion granting \nsummary judgment, we examine the record evidence in the  \nlight  most  favorable  to the non -moving  parties, here the  \nResidents, while resolving all reasonable inferences in their \nfavor.  Wishkin v. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \n \n2 The record inconsistently describes the number of \nhomes as 327 or 329.  (JA 61, 776, 1114).  \n \n5 \n\ndowntown business district.  Until 2004, the neighborhood \nwas also home to a playground and a community center. \n \nThe  2000  census  provides  a sn apshot  of  the \nneighborhood.3    According  to that data,   the  Gardens \nneighborhood  was s plit  evenly  between  rental  properties \n(with  a  median  rental  price of   $705 per m onth)  and \nhomeowners (the median cost of homeownership was $969 \nper month).  Eighty-one percent of the homeowners had lived \nin their homes for at least 9 years; 72% of renters had lived \nthere for at least five years.  Of the 1,0314 residents living in \nthe neighborhood, 203, or 19.7%, were non-Hispanic Whites; \n475, or 46.1% were African-Americans; and 297, or 28.8% \nwere Hispanic, the highest concentration of minority residents \nwithin  Mt.  Holly.    Almost  all  of  these  residents  were \nclassified as “low income”; indeed,  most were classified as \nhaving “very low” or “extremely low” incomes. \n \n                                              \n3 The parties dispute the utility of data from the 2000 \ncensus.  However, none of the parties has briefed or even \nasked the question of when precisely the violations at issue in \nthis  case beg an.   T his  issue is   important  because th e \nredevelopment process began in 200 2 and, as a result, the  \ndemographics of the township have changed.  Disputes over \nwhich census numbers to use thus c reate a moving target; \nhowever, the 2000 ce nsus data appears to p rovide the most \naccurate  demographic  data at th e  inception  of  the \nredevelopment process.   \n \n4  This  is  an  approximate  number  provided  by  the \nResidents’ expert.  Elsewhere in the record, the neighborhood \nis described as home to 1,605 people.  (JA 1114). \n6 \n\nThe neighborhood was not perfect.  For o ne, it was \ncrowded.    This  created  a parkin g  shortage,  which le d \nresidents to pave their backyards for use as driveways, which, \nin turn, led to drainage problems.  In addition, the fact that the \nhomes were owned in fee simple meant there was no one with \na vested interest in maintaining common spaces, such as the \nalleys.  Some of the owners were nothing more than absentee \nlandlords,  renting  to  individuals  with  little  interest  in \nmaintaining  the pro perties.   Over t he  years,  many  of  the \nproperties fell into disrepair.  Vacant properties were boarded \nup,  some  yards  filled  with  rubbish,  and  parts  of  the  area \nbecame blighted.  Because the houses were connected to one \nanother, the dilapidation of one house could and sometimes \ndid lead to the d ecay of the adjoining house s.  Finally, the \ndense  population,  narrow  streets,  and  vacant  properties \nfacilitated crime.  In 1999, 28% of crimes in the Township \noccurred  in the Gar dens,  even thoug h  that  neighborhood \ncovers only 1.5% of the Township’s land area. \n \nThese  many  problems  were not ignored.     Local \ncommunity activists and business leaders worked to revitalize \nthe Gardens through a private initiative that eventually came \nto be known as “Mt. Holly 2000.”  This community endeavor \nsought to reverse the neighborhood’s decline by rehabilitating \nproperties and increasing social services.  Despite sporadic \nachievements—ten homes were renovated and a community \npolicing  center  was  established—the  neighborhood’s \nproblems continued. \n \nIn the year 2000, the Township commissioned a study \nto determine whether the Gardens should be designated as an \n“area  in need of   redevelopment”  under  New Jerse y’s \nredevelopment  laws.    The  resulting  report,  issued  on \n7 \n\nNovember  8,  2000  concluded  that  the  area  offered  a \n“significant  opportunity  for  redevelopment”  because of  \nblight, excess land coverage, poor land use, and excess crime.  \n(JA 699).  That same year, the Township began to acquire \nproperties in the Gardens.  Those properties were left vacant. \n \nA series of redevelopment plans followed.  In 2003, \nthe Township issued the Gardens Area Redevelopment Plan \n(“GARP”).  This plan called for the demolition of all of the \nhomes in the neighb orhood and the  permanent or temporary \nrelocation  of  all of it s  residents.  In their place, the plan  \nprovided for the construction of 180 new market-rate housing \nunits,  thirty  of  which  would be ava ilable  only  to seni or \ncitizens.  The plan was changed in 2005 to include a parcel of \nland immediately north of the Gardens. This plan, the West \nRancocas Redevelopment Plan, also called for the destruction \nof most of the original Gardens homes, to be replaced with \n228 new residential units composed of two-family dwellings \nand townhouses.  Unlike the GARP, the West Rancocas plan \nprovided for the optional rehabilitation of some of the original \nGardens  homes  and  allowed  for  the  residents  of  those \nrehabilitated units to be temporarily relocated in phases so \nthat  they  could  remain  in the neighborho od.   The  West \nRancocas plan also co ntemplated that 10% of the 228 units \nwould be designated as affordable housing.  Finally, in 2008, \nthe plan was changed again.  This time, the Revised West \nRancocas Redevelopment Plan called f or construction of up \nto 520 houses, 75% of which could be to wnhouses and 50% \nof which could be apart ments.  The revise d plan called f or \nonly 56 deed-restricted affordable housing units, 11 of which \nwould  be  offered  on  a priorit y  basis  to existing Garden s \nresidents.  This revised plan did not include any rehabilitation \nof existing units. \n8 \n\n \nAt each stage of  the process, many Gardens residents \nobjected  to the redevelop ment,  complaining  about the  \ndestruction  of  their neighborhoo d  and expr essing  fear  that \nthey would not be able to afford to live anywhere else in the \nTownship.  One resid ent complained that th e house next to  \nhers was torn d own and that a bulldo zer had hit her ho me, \ntearing the wall, crack ing the ceiling, and shifting her roof.  \n(JA 577-78, 1001).  Another resident, a 70-year-old disabled \nhomeowner, told the  Township’s Planning Board that, were  \nhe  displaced,  he  would  be  unable  to  work  and  unable  to \nafford a new home.  (JA 1002).  At one meeting in 2005, a \nplanning expert testified that the  West Rancocas plan was \ndeficient because it only allowed rehabilitation as an option, \nwithout requiring or even encouraging it.  He also said that \n90% of the Gardens’ existing residents would not be able to \nafford the newly-constructed homes and complained that the \nplan did not provide an estimate of affordable housing in the \nexisting market for displaced residents.  (JA 990, 1117). \n \nDespite  these co mplaints,  work on the develop ment \ncontinued.  In February 2006 Keating Urban Partners, LLC, \nwas chosen as t he plan developer.  Kea ting, in turn, hired  \nTriad to develop a relocation plan.  That plan, the Workable \nRelocation Assistance Plan (“WRAP”), was submitted to the \nNew Jersey Department of Community Affairs on September \n28, 2006 and provided that all residents living in the Gardens \non  August  1,  2006  would  receive  relocation  assistance.   \nQualified homeowners would receive $15,000 and a $20,000 \nno-interest loan to assist in the purchase of a replacement \nhome.    The  Township  offered  to  buy  homes  for  between \n9 \n\n$32,000 and $49,000.5  The estimated cost of a new home in \nthe development was between $200,000 and $275,000, well \noutside the range of  affordability for a significant portion of  \nthe  African-American  and Hisp anic  residents  of  the \nTownship.   \n \nRenters  were a uthorized  to receive up   to  $7,500  of \nrelocation  assistance,  but  were n ot  eligible  for  relocation \nfunds to return to the Gardens.  In any case, the vast majority \nof  those renters would be unable to aff ord  the  proposed \nmarket-rate  rent of   $1,230  per  month.    Eventually,  the \nTownship paid to relocate 62 f amilies, 42 of which moved \noutside of Mt. Holly Township.  Renters who moved often \nhad to pay more in rent at their new homes. \n \nAlthough the redevelopment plan called for building in \nphases, the Township began to acquire and demolish all of the \nhomes in the Gardens, thereby displacing many residents and \ncreating conditions that encouraged the remaining residents to \nleave.  By August 2008, 75 homes had been destroyed and \n148 homes had been acquired and left vacant.  Later that fall, \nthe  Township de molished  60 more ho mes.   And ,  in  the \nsummer  of  2009, 50   more  homes  were  knocked  down.   \nResidents living amongst the destruction were forced to cope \nwith  noise, v ibration,  dust, and de bris.   W orse,  the \ninterconnected  nature  of  the houses   triggered  a casc ading \narray of problems.  Uninsulated interior walls were exposed \nto the outside and covered with unsightly stucco or tar.  But \nthese coatings did not extend below grade, allowing moisture \nto  seep into s ubterranean  crawl s paces,  creating  an \n                                              \n5  One  home  sold f or  $64,000  and  another  sold  for \n$81,000. \n10 \n\nenvironment  for  mold  problems.    Above,  the  demolitions \nopened the roofs of adjoining homes.  Those openings were \npatched with plywood, which was insuf ficient to stop water \nleaks.  Around the neighborhood, homes bore the scars of \ndemolition:  hanging wires and telephone boxes, ragged brick \ncorners,  open  masonry  joints,  rough  surfaces,  irregular \nplywood patches, and damaged porches, floors and railings.  \nDestruction  of  the sidewalks out side  demolished  homes \nfurther contributed to the disarra y by making it difficult to \nnavigate through the neighborhood. By June 2011, only 70 \nhomes remained under private ownership and the Township \nwas in the process of demolishing 52 properties that it had \nacquired.    These  conditions  discouraged  any  attempt  at \nrehabilitating  the nei ghborhood  and  encouraged  existing \nresidents  to  sell  their  homes  for  less tha n  they  otherwise \nmight have been worth.  \n \n  In October 2003, Citizens in Action filed a suit in state \ncourt alleging violations of New Jersey’s redevelopment laws \nand  procedures,  and  various a nti-discrimination  laws.  \nUltimately, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed some \ncounts and granted summary judgment to the Township on \nthe others, concluding that there was   no violation of New \nJersey  law, t hat  the  area  was blig hted,  and  that  the ant i-\ndiscrimination claims were not ripe because the plan had not \nyet been implemented. The Appellate Division affirmed, and \nthe  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  denied  a  petition  for \ncertiorari. \n \nThe Residents filed suit in the District Court on May \n27, 2008, raising the anti-discrimination claims that had not \nbeen ripe in  their state suit.  The f ederal complaint alleged, \namong other things, violations of the Fair Housing Act (the \n11 \n\n“FHA”), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968; the Civil \nRights Act of 1866, as codified at 42 U.S.C. § 19826; and the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited  States  Constitution.7    The  Residents  asked  for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to stop the redevelopment \nplan, as well as da mages or compensation that would allow  \nGardens residents to obtain housing in the  Township.  The \nResidents’ motion for a preliminary injunction was denied.  \nAfter they filed an Amended Complaint, the Township, along \nwith the other n amed defendants, filed motions to dismiss.  \nThe District Court converted these into motions for summary \njudgment  and,  after  allowing the  parties  time  to  brief  the \nmotions,  granted  summary  judgment  to  the T ownship \ndefendants.  The District Court ruled that there was no prima \nfacie case of discrimination under the FHA and that, even if \nthere was, the Residents had not shown ho w an alternative \ncourse of action would have had a lesser impact.  \n \nThe Residents filed a timely appeal and we granted the \nResidents’ motion to stay redevelopment pending this appeal.  \nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.  \n \nII. \n                                              \n6 42 U.S.C. § 1982 provides that “[a]ll citizens of the \nUnited States shall have the same right, in every State and \nTerritory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, \npurchase,  lease, sell,  hold,  and conve y  real  and personal \nproperty.”  \n \n7 Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides in \npertinent part that “[ n]o State shall . . . den y to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \n12 \n\n \nWe  exercise  plenary  review  over a D istrict  Court’s \nruling  on  summary  judgment.    See  Disabled  in  Action  of \nPennsylvania v. Se. Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., 635 F.3d 87, \n92 (3d Cir. 2011).  “Summary judgment is appropriate onl y \nwhere,  drawing all r easonable  inferences  in  favor  of  the \nnonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material \nfact . . . and  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter  of  law.”   Id.  (quoting  Melrose,  Inc.  v. City of  \nPittsburgh, 613 F.3d 380, 387 (3d Cir. 2010)). \n \nThe FHA makes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent . . \n. or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any \nperson because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or \nnational origin.”  42 U.S.C. §  3604(a).  A dwelling can be \nmade otherwise unavailable by, among other things, action \nthat limits the availability of affordable housing.  See, e.g., \nHuntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d \n926,  928-29,  938-39  (2d  Cir. 198 8);  Smith  v. Town o f \nClarkton,  682  F.2d  1055,  1059,  1062-64  (4th  Cir.  1982); \nResident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 130 (3d Cir.  \n1977).    The  FHA  can  be v iolated  by  either  intentional \ndiscrimination or if a practice h as a disparate impact on a \nprotected class.   Cmty. Serv., Inc. v. W ind Gap Mun. Auth., \n421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005).   \n \nDisparate impact claims, which do not require proof of \ndiscriminatory intent, see Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 147-48, permit \nfederal law to reach “[c]onduct that has the necessary and \nforeseeable consequence of perpetuating segregation[, which] \ncan be as deleterious as purposefully discriminatory conduct \nin frustrating the national commitment to replace the ghettos \nby  truly  integrated  and  balanced  living  patterns.”    Metro. \n13 \n\nHous.  Dev. C orp.  v.  Vill.  of Arlin gton  Heights,  558 F. 2d \n1283, 1289-90 (7th Cir. 1977).  In order to determine whether \naction of this sort was “because of race” we look to see if it \nhad  a  “racially  discriminatory  effect,”  i.e.,  whether  it \ndisproportionately burdened a particular racial group so as to \ncause a disparate impact.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 146-48; see also \nLapid-Laurel, LLC v. Zoning Bd. of Adjust ment of Twp. of \nSouth Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir. 2002) (featuring \nclaims  of  a dis parate  impact  on  handicapped  persons  in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(f)).  This is called a prima facie \ncase of discrimination.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 148 & n.31.  If \nsuch a case is established, then we look to see whether the \ndefendant has a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its \nactions.  Id. at 148.  If it does, the defendant must then also \nestablish  that “no alt ernative  course of   action could be \nadopted that would enable that interest to be served with less  \ndiscriminatory impact.”  Id. at 149.  Finally, if the defendant \nmakes this showing, the burden once again shifts to those \nchallenging the action, who must demonstrate that there is a \nless discriminatory way to advance the defendant’s legitimate \ninterest.  Id. at 149 n.37. \n \nA.  \n \nWhen  viewed  in th e  light  most  favorable  to the \nResidents,  the  evidence  submitted  by  the  Residents  was \nsufficient to establish a prima facie case.  “[N]o single test \ncontrols in  measuring disparate impact,” but the Residents \nmust offer proof of disproportionate impact, measured in a \nplausible way.  Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty., \n466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006).  Typically, “a disparate \nimpact is demonstrated by statistics,” id. at 1286, and a prima \nfacie  case  may  be  established  where  “gross  statistical \n14 \n\ndisparities  can be sho wn.”    Hazleton  Sch.  Dist.  v. United  \nStates, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977).  According to the data in \nthe  2000 cens us  conducted  before  the rede velopment  plan \nbegan, 22.54% of African-American households and 32.31% \nof Hispanic households in Mount Holly will be affected by \nthe demolition of the Gardens.  The sa me is true for only \n2.73%  of  White  households.   In   short,  the  Residents’ \nstatistical expert has calculated that African-Americans would \nbe 8 times  more likely  to be affected by  the project than \nWhites, and Hispanics would be 1 1 times more likely to be \naffected.  Furthermore, the 2000 data  showed that only 21% \nof African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington \nCounty would be able to afford new market-rate housing in \nthe Gardens, compared to 79% of White households.   \n \nThe  District  Court’s  first  error wa s  in reje cting  the \nResidents’ statistical submissions, which should have been \ntaken in the light most favorable to them at this stage in the \nproceedings.  These statistics, like those pr esented in Rizzo \nand  other  prominent  housing  discrimination  cases,  show  a \ndisparate impact.  In  Rizzo, the plaintiffs presented evidence \nthat, of the 14,000-15,000 people on a waitin g list for public \nhousing,  85% w ere  black  and  95% were   of  a  minority \nbackground.  564 F.2d at 142.  Under these circumstances, we \nconcluded that the cancellation of a public housing project \nhad a “racially disproportionate effect, adverse to Blacks and \nother minorities in Philadelphia.”  Id.  Similarly, the plaintiffs \nin  the  Second  Circuit  case of   Huntington  Branch  used \nstatistics showing that while only 7% of the residents in a  \ntown  required  subsidized  affordable  housing,  24%  of  that \ntown’s Black residents required such housing, which meant \nthat  Black  residents  were  three ti mes  more  likely  to  be \naffected by a shortage of affordable housing.  844 F.2 d at \n15 \n\n929.  And in Keith v. Volpe, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \nthe FHA was violated where a blocke d housing project had \ntwice the adverse impact on minorities.  858 F.2d 467, 484 \n(9th  Cir.  1988).   Th e  disparate  impact  here,  while  not  as \nextreme as the impact in Rizzo, is similar to or greater than \nthe  disparate  impact  found  sufficient  to  establish  a  prima \nfacie case elsewhere.  Under these circumstances, the District \nCourt erred in granting summary judgment to the Township. \n \nFurther,  the  District  Court’s challenge  to  these \nstatistics  in  a f ootnote  did  not  make  the  appropriate \ninferences.   (JA 15 -16  n.9).   Instead,  the  District Co urt \nchallenged the statistical analysis underlying the 21% figure \nof  Burlington Cou nty  minority  residents  who  could af ford \nunits the redeveloped Gardens as both too broad, because it \ntook account of the entire population of Burlington County, \nand  too narro w  because  it f ailed  to  consider    minorities \noutside the county who might move in.  \n \nIn addition, the District Court said the 21% f igure did \nnot  take int o  account  the f act  that 56 of   the units in t he \nRevised  West  Rancocas  Plan woul d  be  designated as  \naffordable housing.  But the District Court’s analysis failed to \ntake into account the Residents’ evidence  that these units, \nalthough  labeled  “affordable,”  would  be out  of  reach  for \nalmost all of the Gardens residents.   \n \nThe District Court also said that the statistics failed to \ntake into account non-minority purchasers who might rent to \nminorities.   But, un less  those purchase rs  offered  below-\nmarket  rents, this w ould  not af fect  the inference that the \nproject had a disproportionate effect on Blacks and Hispanics \nwho would be unable to afford market-rate units.  \n16 \n\n \nAs to the District Court’s concern that the statistics did \nnot take into account minorities who might move elsewhere \nin Mount Holly, the Residents’ expert opined that affordable \nhousing in the Township was scarce, and that most Gardens \nresidents  would  not be able to aff ord  market-rate  units \nelsewhere in the Township.   \n \nLastly,  the  District  Court  erred  when  it  rejected  a \nreasonable inference in favor of the Residents b y looking at \nthe  absolute  number  of  African-American  and Hispa nic \nhouseholds in Burlington County  that could afford  homes.  \nInstead, the District Court should have looked to see whether \nthe  African-American  and H ispanic  residents  were \ndisproportionately affected by the redevelopment plan.  See \nHuntington,  844  F.2d  at  938  (“By  relying  on ab solute \nnumbers  rather tha n  on proportiona l  statistics,  the district  \ncourt significantly underestimated the disproportionate impact \nof the Town’s  policy.”); Hallmark Developers, 466 F.3d at \n1286 (“[I]t may be inappropriate to rely on absolute numbers \nrather than on proportional statistics.”) (quoting Huntington, \n844 F.3d at 928.).8 \n \n  There is another probl em.  The District Court’s most \ntroubling error is its  conflation of the concept of disparate \ntreatment  with  disparate  impact.    The  District  Court \nessentially agreed with the Township that because 100% of \nminorities in the Gardens will be treated the same as 100% of \nnon-minorities in the  Gardens, the Residents failed to prove \n                                              \n8 The Department of Justice filed an  amicus curiae \nbrief agreeing that the District Court erred  in its disparate  \nimpact prima facie case analysis.  \n17 \n\nthere is a greater ad verse impact on minorities.  This was in  \nerror.  We need not simply ask whether the White residents at \nthe Gardens are treated the same as the minority residents at \nthe Gardens.  The logic behind the FHA is more perceptive \nthan that.  It looks beyond such specious concepts of equality \nto determine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful \nrights because of his race.  Rather, a disparate impact inquiry \nrequires us to ask whether minorities are disproportionately \naffected by the redevelopment plan.  Thus the Residents can \nestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact by showing \nthat  minorities  are  disproportionately  burdened  by  the \nredevelopment plan or that the redevelop ment plan “[falls] \nmore harshly” on minorities.  Doe v. City of Butler, 892 F.2d \n315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989).   \n \n  The Township asserts that a disparate impact approach \nwould result in the unintended consequence of halting the \nredevelopment  of  minority  neighborhoods  and  that it  is \nforeclosed  by  the  Supreme  Court’s deci sion  in  City  of \nMemphis v. Greene, which states that \n \n [b]ecause  urban neighborhoo ds  are so  \nfrequently characterized by a common ethnic or \nracial heritage, a regulation’s adverse impact on \na  particular  neighborhood  will  often  have  a \ndisparate  effect  on a n  identifiable  ethnic  or \nracial  group.  To   regard an inevita ble \nconsequence of that kind as a form of stigma so \nsevere as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment \nwould trivialize the great purpose of that charter \nof freedom. \n   \n451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981). \n18 \n\n \n  There  are th ree  problems  with  the  Township’s \nposition.   F irst,  City  of  Memphis  was  concerned  with  the \nstandard  for  establishing  a  violation  of  the  Thirteenth \nAmendment’s ban on the “badges and incidents of slavery in \nthe United States.”  Id. at 125-26.  Whatever that standard \nmight be—a question left open by the Supreme Court’s ruling \nin that case,  see id. at 130 (White, J., concurring)—City of \nMemphis  did not consider the FHA.  All of the  courts of \nappeals that have considered the matter, including this one, \nhave concluded that p laintiffs can show  the FHA has been \nviolated through policies that have a dispar ate impact on a \nminority  group.

City of Black Jack, 508 \nF.2d 1179, 1184 (8th Cir. 1974).  \n \nSecond, the Township’s approach urges us to conclude \nthat  the FHA   is  violated  only  when a po licy  treats  each \nindividual minority resident differently from each individual \nWhite  resident.    Under  our  precedent,  a  plaintiff  may \n19 \n\nestablish  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination  by \ndemonstrating  that th e  policy  disproportionately  affects  or \nimpacts  one  group  more  than ano ther—facially  disparate \ntreatment need not be shown.   For  instance, in  Rizzo, the \nwaiting  list  for  public  housing  comprised  85%  African-\nAmericans and 95% minorities, meaning that 5% were White.  \n564 F.2d at 142.  The White residents on the list were treated \nthe same as the minority residents on the list—each was hurt \nby  Philadelphia’s  decision  to  block  a  public  housing \nproject—but we nevertheless found a violation of the FHA \nbecause cancelling the project had a “racially disproportionate \neffect” on African-Americans.  Id. at 149 (“Nor can there be \nany doubt that the impact of the governmental defendants’ \ntermination of the project was felt primarily by blacks, who \nmake  up  a sub stantial  proportion  of  those  who  would  be \neligible to reside there.”) (emphasis added).   \n \n  The Township may be correct that a  disparate impact \nanalysis will often allow plaintiffs to make out a prima facie \ncase  when a segrega ted  neighborhood  is redeveloped in  \ncircumstances  where  there is a s hortage  of alternative \naffordable  housing.    But  this  is a   feature  of  the FHA’ s \nprogramming, not a bug.  The FHA is a broadly remedial \nstatute  designed  to  prevent and   remedy  invidious \ndiscrimination on the basis of race,  see Havens Realty Corp. \nv. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380 (1982), that facilitates its anti-\ndiscrimination  agenda  by  encouraging  a se arching  inquiry \ninto the motives behind a contested policy to ensure that it is \nnot  improper.    See  Christine  Jolls,  Antidiscrimination  and \nAccommodation,  115  Harv.  L. Rev. 642, 652 (2001)  \n(remarking that a “leading gloss”  on the Supreme  Court’s \ndecision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), \nis that “disparate impact functions as a means of smoking out \n20 \n\nsubtle or underlying forms of intentional discrimination on \nthe basis of group membership.”).  We need not be concerned \nthat this approach is too expansive because the establishment \nof a prima facie case, by itself, is not enough to establish  \nliability under the FHA.  It simply results in a more searching \ninquiry into the defendant’s motivations—precisely the sort \nof inquiry required to ensure that the gover nment does not \ndeprive people of housing “because of race.” \n \n  Finally,  the  Township  seems  to arg ue  that its  \nredevelopment  plan  does  not  violate  Title  VIII  unless  the \nstatistics show that it increases segregation in the Township.  \n(Twp. Br. at 18.).   Showing that a policy has a segregative \neffect is one way to establish a violation of Title VIII, but it is \nnot the only way.  See Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 937 \n(observing that a policy often discriminates in one  of two \nways:  having a disparate impact or perpetuating segregation).  \nThe  Township is f ree  to argue that its plan is less  \ndiscriminatory than all of the available alternatives because it \ndoes the best job of integrating the neighborhood.  However, \nthose arguments are properly considered in the context of the \nlast steps of the Title  VIII analysis, not as a requirement of \nthe prima facie case.  \n \n  In reality, the District Court’s decision was based on a \nvalid  and  practical  concern,  which  appears  to d rive  its \nreasoning throughout the opinion.  It feared that finding a \ndisparate impact here would render the Township powerless \nto rehabilitate its blighted neighborhoods.  This underlying \nrationale distorts the focus and analysis of disparate impact \ncases under the FHA.  In disparate impact cases, “[e]ffect, not \nmotivation, is the touchstone because a thoughtless housing \npractice  can  be  as  unfair  to  minority  rights  as  a wi llful \n21 \n\nscheme.”  Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp., 536 F.2d 231,  233 \n(8th Cir. 1977).  Once the Residents established a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact, the District Court ’s inquiry must \ncontinue to determine whether a person is being deprived of \nhis lawful rights because of his race.  It must ask whether that \nTownship’s legitimate objectives could have been achieved in \na less discriminatory way. \n \nB.  \n \nOnce the plaintif fs establish a prima facie  case, the \ndefendants must offer a legitimate reason for their actions.  In \nthis  case,  everyone  agrees  that  alleviating  blight  is  a \nlegitimate  interest.   The core  of  the dispute  between  the \nparties is over  the next step of the FHA’s burden-shifting \nanalysis:  whether the defendants have shown that there is no \nless discriminatory alternative.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Only \nwhen the defendants make this showing does the burden shift \nback  to the  plaintiffs—where  it u ltimately  remains—to \nprovide evidence of such an alternative.  Id. at 149 n.37.  The \ntest for whether there is no alternative is “similar to the test of \nwhether the def endant has demonstrated that the requested \naccommodation  is ‘ unreasonable’  for  the purposes of  \nrebutting a claim under § 3604(f)(3)(B).”  Lapid-Laurel, 284 \nF.3d at 468.  Section 2604(f)(3)(B) of the FHA requires that \nreasonable housing accommodations be made for individuals \nwith disabilities.  In other words, the defendant must show \nthat  the al ternatives  impose  an  undue  hardship  under  the \ncircumstances  of  this  specific  case.   See  US  Airways  v. \nBarnett, 535 U.S. 391, 401-02 (2002) (discussing the term \n“unreasonable  accommodation”  under  the  Americans  with \nDisabilities Act). \n \n22 \n\n  The  District Court   characterized the Residents ’ \nproposed alternative as follows: \n \n[E]ffectively,  plaintiffs  are  seeking  to  remain \nliving  in  the  blighted  and  unsafe  conditions \nuntil they are awarded money damages for their \nclaims  and suf ficient  compensation  to secu re \nhousing in the local h ousing market. Although \ncouched  at  times  like  an ef fort  to ha ve  the \ndevelopment go up around them, like a highway \nbuilt around a pro tected tree, or to have th eir \nunits  rehabilitated,  this  makes little if   no \npractical  sense  after  years  of  litigation, \napproved  redevelopment  plans,  and  the \nexpenditure of significant public resources. At \nthis late stage, the only real practical remedy is \nfor plaintiffs to receive the f air value for their \nhome as well as proper and non-discriminatory \nrelocation procedures and benefits . . . .  The \nrelief  they  are  seeking  is inc onsistent  with \nproving the fourth element of their FHA claim-\nnamely, that an alternative course of action to \neminent domain and relocation is viable. \n(JA 17 n.12) (ellipsis in original).   \n \n  The  Residents’  evidence  is sus ceptible  to  more \nfavorable  inferences.   The Residents  are  not  asking f or \npermission  to  continue  to live   in “bl ighted  and  unsafe” \nconditions.  Instead, they argue that there is a feasible plan \nthat meets the Township’s goals and entails more substantial \nrehabilitation.   Takin g  the evidence in t he  light  most \nfavorable to the Residents, one could credit the report of the \n23 \n\nResidents’ planning expert, which stated that the “blighted \nand unsafe” conditions could be remedied in a far less heavy-\nhanded  manner  that  would  not  entail  the wholesale  \ndestruction and rebuilding of the neighborhood.  \n  \nThe Residents’ expert pointed out that, although the \nRevised  West  Rancocas  Plan  called f or  development  in \nstages, the Township began the development by aggressively \nacquiring houses, which it left vacant and then destroyed.  He \nopined that a  more gradual redevelopment plan would have \nallowed  existing  residents  to  move  elsewhere  in  the \nneighborhood during one part of the redevelopment, and then \nmove  back  once  the  redevelopment  was  completed.   The  \nResidents’ expert further  noted that the Township had not \nperformed  a  comparative  cost  analysis  showing  that  total \ndemolition, relocation, and new construction was less feasible \nthan  an  alternative  focused  on  rehabilitation.    Indeed,  the \nexpert went on to prop ose an alternative redevelopment plan \nthat would rely on the targeted acquisition and rehabilitation \nof some of the existing Gardens homes, the combination of \nsome houses to make larger homes, an initiative to make the \nhouses more attractive through the use of landscaping and \nadded  amenities  such  as dec ks  and  porches,  and  selective \ndemolition and new construction, including the construction \nof more affordable units.  The Residents’ expert also provided \nexamples of previous alternatives—including one developed \nas early as 1989—to show that the complete demolition of the \nneighborhood was not the only possible solution to blight in \nthe Gardens.9  Finally, he provided a no n-exhaustive list of \n                                              \n9 The 1989 plan was not provided as the alternative but \nonly to show that less discriminatory alternatives had been \nconsidered in the past  and could serve as the basis f or an \n24 \n\nstate and federal funding programs that would support such a \nredevelopment  plan and observed that the   Township had  \nfailed to  make an active effort to locate a developer with \nexperience in neighborhood rehabilitation.  \n \nThe Township provided the contrasting statements of \nits  Township  manager,  who  argued  that  a  rehabilitation \nprogram was not economically feasible.  In support, she cited \nthe fact that one alter native, the Mt. Holly 2000 progra m, \ndemonstrated  that re habilitation  of  each unit would  be \nextremely  costly.    She  also challe nged  the  availability  of \nsources  of  funding  for  a  rehabilitation.   Lastly,  she \nemphasized  the  many  problems  that  led  the  Township  to \ndeclare the Gardens an area in need  of redevelopment and \nasserted the belief of the Township Council and its planning \nboard that demolition and replacement is the most effective \nand  efficient  approach to  solving  the  neighborhood’s \nproblems. \n \nThese contrasting statements, as well as the parties’ \ncontinued arguments on appeal as to th e cost and feasibility \nof  an alternative   relying  on r ehabilitation,  create  genuine \nissues of material fact that require further investigation.  Once \nthe record on alternatives has been more fully developed, the \nDistrict Court may entertain renewed motions for summary \njudgment, taking into account the Township’s initial burden \nof showing that there  are no less discriminatory alternatives, \nas  well as the standard advanced in  Lapid-Laurel  for \n                                                                                                     \nupdated  approach  that  would lesse n  the r edevelopment’s \nimpact on minority residents of the Township. \n25 \n\nultimately  determining  whether  an  alternative  is \nunreasonable.10  \n \nIII. \n \nThe Residents are also seeking to recover under the \ntheory that the To wnship intentionally discriminated against \nits  minority  residents  when it adopted the   redevelopment \nplan.   The D istrict  Court  saw no e vidence  of  intentional \ndiscrimination  and g ranted  the To wnship’s  motion f or \nsummary judgment.  After carefully considering the matter, \nwe discern no e rror in the District Court’s decision and will \nthus affirm that ruling.  \n \nIV. \n \n  The Township has broad discretion to i mplement the \npolicies it believes will improve its residents’ quality of life.  \nBut that discretion is bounded b y laws like the FHA and b y \nthe Constitution, which prevent policies that discriminate on \nthe basis of race.  F or this reason, “the f ederal courts must \n                                              \n10 Triad asserts that the portion of the District Court’s \norder relating to its involvement should be affirmed because \nthe Residents, on appeal, have waived their claims against it.  \nWe  disagree.   In   their  brief,  the Resi dents  argue tha t  the \nredevelopers,  which  include  Triad,  provided  inadequate \nrelocation  assistance,  allowed  residents  to  be i mproperly \npressured  to leav e,  and that the rede velopment  plan \nessentially pushes minority residents out of Mount Holly.  For \nall of the reasons stated in this opinion, these are genuine \nissues of material fact that must be resolved through further \ndiscovery on remand. \n26 \n\nstand prepared to provide ‘such remedies as are necessary to \nmake effective the congressional purpose.’”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d \nat 149 (quoting J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433 \n(1964)).   A  more  developed  factual  record  will assis t  the \nDistrict Court in crafting appropriate remedies, if necessary.  \nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the District Court’s order \ngranting  summary  judgment  is v acated  and  the case is  \nremanded for further proceedings.  \n27 ",

DESANTIS\nBALLARD SPAHR ANDREWS & INGERSOLL LLP\nPLAZA 1000 - SUITE 500\nMAIN STREET\nVOORHEES, NJ 08043\nAttorney for Defendant Keating Urban Partners, L.L.C.\nHILLMAN, District Judge\nThis matter comes before the Court on defendants’ motions to\ndismiss all counts in plaintiffs’ complaint pursuant to Federal\nCivil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6).  For the reasons expressed below,\ndefendants’ motions will be granted in part, denied in part, and\ncontinued in part. \nBACKGROUND\nThis case involves the redevelopment of the Mount Holly\nGardens neighborhood (the “Gardens”) in Mount Holly, New Jersey. \nPlaintiffs are low-income, African-American, Hispanic and\n“white,” residents of the Gardens, who object to the plan because\nthey are being forcibly removed from their homes, which are being\nreplaced with new, much higher-priced market rate homes. \nPlaintiffs claim that defendants--the Township of Mt. Holly, its\nmanager and mayor, the construction company selected to undertake\nthe redevelopment, Keating Urban Partners, LLC, and the company\nhired by Keating to conduct the relocation activities, Triad\nAssociates, Inc.-- violated Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1968 (the Fair Housing Act or FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.\n(Count One against all defendants); the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 3 of 31 PageID: 3958\n42 U.S.C. § 1982 (Count Two against the Township); the Equal\nProtection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, brought pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count Three against the Township); New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination, N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq. (Count Four\nagainst all defendants); Equal Protection Clause of the New\nJersey State Constitution (Count Five against the Township); Due\nProcess Clause of the New Jersey State Constitution (Count Six\nagainst the Township); Due Process Clause of the U.S.\nConstitution, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count Seven\nagainst the Township); New Jersey Local Redevelopment and Housing\nLaw, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. (Count Eight against the\nTownship); and the General Welfare Clause of the New Jersey State\nConstitution (Count Nine against the Township).\nDefendants have moved to dismiss all these claims against\nthem.  During the briefing of these motions, this case has\ninvolved several hearings, a denial of a TRO, the filing of a\nsecond amended complaint, and the issuance of three Opinions. \nMost recently, the Court denied plaintiffs’ request for a\npreliminary injunction to stop the redevelopment based on the\ndefendants’ alleged violation of the FHA.  (Docket No. 94.)  The\nplaintiffs had argued that the redevelopment plan has a disparate\nimpact on the African-American and Hispanic residents, and they\nare facing irreparable harm from the threat of losing their homes\nand their community ties, being inadequately compensated for\n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 4 of 31 PageID: 3959\ntheir properties, and being unable to obtain affordable and\ndecent replacement housing.  The defendants had countered that\nthey did not violate the FHA because there is no intentional\ndiscrimination or disparate impact on the Garden residents, and\neven if there were, the defendants are proceeding pursuant to a\nbona fide governmental interest in the least restrictive way. \nThe Court found that, for the purposes of denying a preliminary\ninjunction, plaintiffs had not pleaded a successful Fair Housing\nAct claim.  Specifically, the Court found that plaintiffs could\nnot prove their prima facie case of disparate impact, and even if\nthey were able to establish their prima facie case, they did not\nrebut the Township’s legitimate interest in the redevelopment,\nand they did not show how an alternative course of action would\nhave a lesser impact.  \nThe Court’s holding on the preliminary injunction motion\npresents a peculiar procedural posture in which to hear\ndefendants’ motions to dismiss.  Defendants filed their motions\nto dismiss prior to the preliminary injunction hearing, and even\nthough plaintiffs’ opposition and defendants’ replies were filed\na few days after, none of the briefing mentions the Court’s\nfindings with regard to the preliminary injunction.  This is\nunderstandable, because in deciding defendants’ motions to\ndismiss plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 5 of 31 PageID: 3960\nthe Court must accept all well-pleaded allegations in the\ncomplaint as true, view them in the light most favorable to the\nplaintiff, and must only consider the facts alleged in the\npleadings, the documents attached thereto as exhibits, and\nmatters of judicial notice.  Southern Cross Overseas Agencies,\nInc. v. Kwong Shipping Group Ltd., 181 F.3d 410, 426 (3d Cir.\n1999).   The Court, however, cannot ignore the parties’ briefing\nand representations at oral argument on the preliminary\ninjunction motion, and the Court cannot ignore its findings and\nlegal conclusions.  Thus, the question is whether the Court’s\nOpinion and Order on the preliminary injunction motion can be\nconsidered a “matter of judicial notice,” and to what extent can\nthe Court rely on that Opinion and Order in deciding the instant\nmotions to dismiss.\nThe Third Circuit has held that although “a prior judicial\nopinion constitutes a public record of which a court may take\njudicial notice, it may do so on a motion to dismiss only to\nestablish the existence of the opinion, not for the truth of the\nfacts asserted in the opinion.”  Lum v. Bank of America, 361 F.3d\n217, 222 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).  “‘[A] court that\nexamines a transcript of a prior proceeding to find facts\nconverts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary\njudgment.’”  Id. (citing Southern Cross, 181 F.3d at 427 n.7\n(explaining that “[i]t has been suggested that the appropriate\n5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 6 of 31 PageID: 3961\nanalogy is the hearsay rule, which allows an out-of-court\nstatement to be admitted into evidence for purposes other than\nestablishing the truth of the statement”)).  Thus, to the extent\nthat findings of fact were made in deciding the preliminary\ninjunction, and the Court wishes to rely on those findings to\ndecide the motions to dismiss, the motions to dismiss must be\nconverted into one for summary judgment. \n“When a District Court decides to convert a motion to\ndismiss into a motion for summary judgment, it must provide the\nparties ‘reasonable opportunity’ to present all material relevant\nto a summary judgment motion, and the parties can take advantage\nof this opportunity only if they have ‘notice of the\nconversion.’”  In re Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.\nSecuritites Litigation, 184 F.3d 280, 287-88 (3d Cir. 1999)\n(citing Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 340 (3d Cir. 1989)).  \nNotice must be “unambiguous and must fairly apprise the parties\nthat the court intends to convert the motion.”  Id. (citations\nand quotations omitted).  Notice need not be express to meet\nthese standards, but it is recommended that courts provide\nexpress notice when they intend to convert a motion to dismiss. \nId.\nBased on the foregoing, the Court will analyze each count in\nplaintiffs’ complaint to determine whether defendants’ motions\ncan be decided as motions to dismiss, or whether they must be\n6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 7 of 31 PageID: 3962\nconverted.  If they must be converted, the Court will provide the\nparties with sufficient time to respond.\n1. Count One - Fair Housing Act\nThe sole basis for plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary\ninjunction was their Fair Housing Act claim.  In the Opinion\ndenying plaintiffs’ motion, the Court explained the legal\nstandard for proving an FHA claim, and determined that it did not\nappear that plaintiffs would be successful on that claim.  The\nCourt explained as follows:\nSection 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act\nmakes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent\nafter the making of a bona fide offer, or to\nrefuse to negotiate for the sale or rental\nof, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a\ndwelling to any person because of race,\ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or\nnational origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)\n(emphasis added).  The FHA can be violated by\neither intentional discrimination or if a\npractice has a disparate impact on a\nprotected class.  Community Services, Inc. v.\nWind Gap Mun. Authority, 421 F.3d 170, 176\n(3d Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs here contend that\nthe Gardens redevelopment plan has a\ndisparate impact on the minorities living in\nthe Gardens.  In order to prove their claim,\nplaintiffs must first establish a prima facie\ncase of disparate impact.  Resident Advisory\nBoard v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir.\n1977).  To show disparate impact, plaintiffs\nmust show that the Township’s actions have\nhad a greater adverse impact on the protected\ngroups (here, African-Americans and\nHispanics) than on others.  Lapid-Laurel,\nL.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp. of\nScotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir.\n2002).  If a plaintiff establishes his prima\nfacie case, the burden shifts to the\ndefendant to demonstrate justification.  The\n7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 8 of 31 PageID: 3963\n“justification must serve, in theory and\npractice, a legitimate, bona fide interest of\nthe Title VIII defendant, and the defendant\nmust show that no other alternative course of\naction could be adopted that would enable\nthat interest to be served with less\ndiscriminatory impact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at\n149.  Finally, “[i]f the defendant does\nintroduce evidence that no such alternative\ncourse of action can be adopted, the burden\nwill once again shift to the Plaintiff to\ndemonstrate that other practices are\navailable.”  Id. at 149 n.37.  “If the Title\nVIII prima facie case is not rebutted, a\nviolation is proved.”  Id. at 149.\nHere, for the purposes of their motion\nfor preliminary injunction, plaintiffs have\nnot demonstrated that they will likely\nsucceed with their FHA claim because they\nhave not demonstrated that they can make\ntheir prima facie case.  Plaintiffs argue\nthat the redevelopment plan has a disparate\nimpact on minorities in two ways.  First,\nplaintiffs argue that the redevelopment more\nnegatively affects minorities in Mt. Holly\nthan non-minority residents because the\nredevelopment is driving out the minority\npopulation of Mt. Holly.  To support their\nposition, plaintiffs present a report of a\ndemographic and statistical expert, Andrew A.\nBeveridge, Ph.D., who states that as of 2000,\nseventy-five percent of the people living in\nthe Gardens were minority residents.  Dr.\nBeveridge states that the Gardens contains a\nhighly concentrated minority population, more\nthan any other area of Mt. Holly. \nConsequently, Dr. Beveridge opines that the\nredevelopment of the Gardens effectively and\nsignificantly reduces the minority population\nin Mt. Holly.  Plaintiffs contend that this\nviolates the FHA.\n  \nSecond, plaintiffs argue that the\nredevelopment plan has a disparate impact on\nminorities because the plan is targeted at an\narea that is populated by mostly minorities. \nPlaintiffs live in the Gardens because for\n8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 9 of 31 PageID: 3964\nfamilies with limited income, the Gardens\nrepresented an attractive affordable housing\nopportunity.  Demolishing the Gardens and\nreplacing the current housing with higher-\npriced homes, and only a few low-income\nunits, effectively causes the targeted\nreduction of Mt. Holly’s minority population. \nThis, too, plaintiffs argue is a violation of\nthe FHA.\nThe statistical repercussions of\nredevelopment do not provide evidence that\nthe Township implemented the plan to\nintentionally or effectively drive out the\nminority population of Mt. Holly.  Indeed,\neven though plaintiffs have pointed out that\nthe redevelopment of the Gardens has reduced\nthe minority population of Mt. Holly, they\nhave not accounted for how many minorities\nwill move into the new housing.  Furthermore,\nand more importantly for the plaintiffs’ FHA\nclaim of disparate impact, the redevelopment\nplan does not apply differently to minorities\nthan non-minorities.  Several plaintiffs\nclassify themselves as “white,” yet the plan\naffects them in the exact same way as their\nminority neighbors.  \n  \nThe real effect of the Gardens\nredevelopment is that there will be less\nlower-income housing in Mt. Holly.  Although\nthe Township may have some obligation with\nregard to providing a certain number of low-\nincome housing pursuant to other law, the\nreduction of low-income housing is not a\nviolation of the FHA.  The FHA prohibits the\nTownship from making unavailable a dwelling\nto any person because of race--it does not\nspeak to income.  Redevelopment of blighted,\nlow-income housing is not, without more, a\nviolation of the FHA.  Here, where fourteen\nhomes are occupied by African-American\nplaintiffs, thirteen homes are occupied by\nHispanic plaintiffs, and six homes are\noccupied by “white” plaintiffs, and all are\naffected in the same way by the\nredevelopment, the Court cannot find, on the\ncurrent record at this preliminary injunction\n9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 10 of 31 PageID: 3965\nstage, that plaintiffs will succeed on their\ndisparate impact FHA claim.\n      \nEven if plaintiffs were able to\nestablish their prima facie case, they have\nnot rebutted the Township’s legitimate\ninterest in the redevelopment, and they have\nnot shown how an alternative course of action\nwould have a lesser impact.  These points\nalso speak to the three other elements\nplaintiffs must prove for a preliminary\ninjunction--irreparable harm, public interest\nand equities--and these elements are\ndiscussed in depth below.  For the purposes\nof establishing an FHA claim, however, it is\nimportant to note that redevelopment of the\ncommunity to remove blight conditions is a\nbona fide interest of the State.  In 1958,\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court commented,\n“Community redevelopment is a modern facet of\nmunicipal government.  Soundly planned\nredevelopment can make the difference between\ncontinued stagnation and decline and a\nresurgence of healthy growth.  It provides\nthe means of removing the decadent effect of\nslums and blight on neighboring property\nvalues, of opening up new areas for residence\nand industry.”  Wilson v. City of Long\nBranch, 142 A.2d 837, 842 (N.J. 1958).  More\nspecifically with regard to the Gardens\nredevelopment, the New Jersey Appellate\nDivision found that “[t]he dilapidated,\novercrowded, poorly designed community, in\naddition to the high level of crime in the\narea, is clearly detrimental to the safety,\nhealth, morals and welfare of the community.” \nCitizens In Action v. Township Of Mt. Holly,\n2007 WL 1930457, 13 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\nDiv. July 5, 2007).  It is clear that the\nTownship has a legitimate interest in the\nredevelopment of the Gardens.\n(Feb. 13 Op. at 5-9.)\nThus, based on the foregoing analysis of plaintiffs’ FHA\nclaim, it appears that when facts beyond those contained in the\n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 11 of 31 PageID: 3966\ncomplaint are considered, plaintiffs do not have a viable claim. \nIn order, however, for the Court to consider its previous\nfindings and the evidence presented at the preliminary injunction\nhearing, the Court must convert the present motions to dismiss\ninto ones for summary judgment on plaintiffs’ FHA claim.  \nUpon conversion, defendants have the burden of demonstrating\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Their burden has already\nbeen met based on the findings of law and fact from the\npreliminary injunction hearing, which may now be considered due\nto the conversion of the motion.  As the facts existed at the\ntime of the preliminary injunction hearing, there was\ninsufficient evidence to prove that defendants violated the FHA.  \nBecause defendants have met their burden, the burden shifts\nto plaintiffs.  Id.  In order to defeat summary judgment,\nplaintiffs now must identify, by affidavits or otherwise,\nspecific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial on\nwhether the redevelopment has a disparate impact on a protected\ngroup, and, if so, whether defendants have a legitimate interest\nin the redevelopment and have no alternative course of action\nthat would have a lesser impact.  Due to the conversion of the\nmotions, plaintiffs must be given the opportunity to meet their\nburden to defeat summary judgment.  Consequently, defendants’\nmotions to dismiss will be adjourned to provide notice to\n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 12 of 31 PageID: 3967\nplaintiffs and time to compile and present their evidence.1\n2. Counts Two, Three, Five - Civil Rights Act and State\nand Federal Equal Protection Clause\nPlaintiffs claim that the Township violated the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982, the Equal Protection Clause of the\nU.S. Constitution, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the New Jersey State Constitution.  In\norder to prove such claims, plaintiffs must show that they were\nthe target of intentional, purposeful discrimination by the\nTownship.  City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio v. Buckeye Community Hope\nFoundation, 538 U.S. 188, 194 (2003) (citation omitted) (“‘Proof\nof racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required’ to show\na violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”); Bradley v. U.S.,\n299 F.3d 197, 205 (3d Cir. 2002) (stating that in order to\nestablish a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff\nneeds to prove that the actions (1) had a discriminatory effect\nand (2) were motivated by a discriminatory purpose); Brown v.\nPhilip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001) (citations\nand quotations omitted) (“In order to bring an action under §\n1982, a plaintiff must allege with specificity facts sufficient\n1Triad specifically argues, and Keating joins in that\nargument, that it cannot be held liable under the FHA because it\nhad no part in the drafting and adoption of the Township’s\nredevelopment plan, and its actions with regard to the relocation\nactivities do not fall within the province of the FHA-protected\nconduct.  The Court will address these arguments, if necessary,\nfollowing plaintiffs’ supplemental briefing.\n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 13 of 31 PageID: 3968\nto show or raise a plausible inference of (1) the defendant's\nracial animus; (2) intentional discrimination; and (3) that the\ndefendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of race.”);\nGreenberg v. Kimmelman, 494 A.2d 294, 308 (N.J. 1985) (stating\nthat if a law is facially neutral, “an equal protection claim\ncould succeed only if the statute had an invidious purpose”). \nEven though plaintiffs have pleaded that through the\nredevelopment plan the Township is intentionally seeking to\ndeprive plaintiffs and other African-Americans and Hispanics of\nthe right to property and equal protection under the law, in the\nOpinion denying plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction,\nthe Court found that plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the\nTownship “implemented the development plan to intentionally or\neffectively drive out the minority population of Mt. Holly.” \n(Op. at 7.)  Thus, as with their FHA claim, this claim must be\nconverted to one for summary judgment, and plaintiffs must be\nafforded the opportunity to provide other proof to support their\nclaims of intentional discrimination.\n3. Count Four - New Jersey Law Against Discrimination\nPlaintiffs claim that all defendants violated the New Jersey\nLaw Against Discrimination (NJLAD), N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 and 10:5-\n4.   N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 provides,\nIt shall be an unlawful discrimination for a\nmunicipality, county or other local civil or political\nsubdivision of the State of New Jersey, or an officer,\nemployee, or agent thereof, to exercise the power to\n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 14 of 31 PageID: 3969\nregulate land use or housing in a manner that\ndiscriminates on the basis of race, creed, color,\nnational origin, ancestry, marital status, familial\nstatus, sex, gender identity or expression, nationality\nor disability.\nPlaintiffs claim that defendants are violating this\nprovision of the NJLAD because the redevelopment plan is causing\n“the disproportionate displacement and forced removal of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic households, that have reduced and will\ncontinue to reduce the overall number of African-American and\nHispanic households living in Mt. Holly Township, and that\ndiscriminate against Africa-American and Hispanic households\nliving in the Gardens neighborhood in the provision of services\nor facilities in connection with housing, that will create\nbarriers for African-American households to remain in and move\ninto Mt. Holly Township, and that thus have a discriminatory\nimpact upon the basis of race, color and national origin to\nperpetuate segregation within Mt. Holly Township . . . .” \n(Second Am. Compl. ¶ 218.)  Plaintiffs also allege that\ndefendants have violated this provision of the NJLAD by\nintentionally discriminating against plaintiffs in the Gardens\nneighborhood.  (Id.  ¶ 219.)\nIn addition, plaintiffs allege that defendants have\n“otherwise” discriminated against them in violation of N.J.S.A.\n10:5-4 (id.  ¶ 220), which provides,\nAll persons shall have the opportunity to obtain\nemployment, and to obtain all the accommodations,\n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 15 of 31 PageID: 3970\nadvantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of\npublic accommodation, publicly assisted housing\naccommodation, and other real property without\ndiscrimination because of race, creed, color, national\norigin, ancestry, age, marital status, affectional or\nsexual orientation, familial status, disability,\nnationality, sex , gender identity or expression or\nsource of lawful income used for rental or mortgage\npayments, subject only to conditions and limitations\napplicable alike to all persons. This opportunity is\nrecognized as and declared to be a civil right.\nDefendants have moved to dismiss these claims on several\nbases.  First, the Township argues that plaintiffs’ claims\nbrought pursuant to N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 must be brought in New\nJersey state court, and therefore must be dismissed.  Second, the\nTownship argues that plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to N.J.S.A.\n10:5-4 must be dismissed because that provision does not provide\na cause of action, but is rather a general statement about the\nsweep of the NJLAD.  Finally, all defendants argue that even if\nplaintiffs’ claims pursuant to either section of the NJLAD could\nbe maintained here, plaintiffs have failed to plead facts to\nsupport such claims.\nWith regard to the Township’s first argument, the court in\nKessler Institute for Rehabilitation, Inc. v. Mayor and Council\nof Borough of Essex Fells, 876 F. Supp. 641, 664-65 (D.N.J.\n1995), found that claims brought pursuant to N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5\nare required to be brought in New Jersey state court.  The court\nexplained that even though the general enforcement provision,\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-13, contains permissive language (“may” initiate\n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 16 of 31 PageID: 3971\nsuit in Superior Court), N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5, which governs\ndiscrimination in land use policy by a municipality, states that\nan action “shall” be brought in Superior Court.  Kessler, 876 F.\nSupp. at 664; see N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5(b) (“Notwithstanding . . .\nsection 10:5-13, any person claiming to be aggrieved by unlawful\ndiscrimination under this section shall enforce this section by a\nprivate right of action in Superior Court.”).  Thus, the Kessler\ncourt dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant to\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 because they belonged in state, rather than\nfederal, court.\nPlaintiffs argue that the Kessler court’s decision should\nnot be followed.  They argue that because the other provisions of\nthe NJLAD may be enforced through filing a complaint with the\nDivision of Civil Rights or the filing of a complaint in the\nstate or federal courts, see N.J.S.A. 10:5-13, N.J.S.A.\n10:5-12.5(b) should be interpreted to only disallow the filing of\na claim pursuant to that section in the Division of Civil Rights,\nbut allow the claim to be brought in court--either federal or\nstate.  Plaintiffs, however, provide no basis for this\ninterpretation, other than their general proposition that their\ninterpretation is more consistent with “established precedent and\nlegislative intent.”  (Pl. Opp. at 29.) \nPlaintiffs are correct that the general enforcement\nprovision provides two remedies: (1) “Any person claiming to be\n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 17 of 31 PageID: 3972\naggrieved by . . . unlawful discrimination may, personally or by\nan attorney-at-law, make, sign and file with the division a\nverified complaint. . . .”; or (2) “Any complainant may initiate\nsuit in Superior Court under this act without first filing a\ncomplaint with the division or any municipal office.”   N.J.S.A.\n10:5-13.  Further, despite the NJLAD’s direction that a party\n“may initiate suit in Superior Court under this act,” NJLAD\nclaims can, and have been, properly advanced in federal court\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332 and/or 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  This Court\nagrees with the Kessler court, however, which rejected\nplaintiffs’ same argument.  The Kessler court explained,\nPlaintiffs argue that this language in § 10:5-12.5\nmeans that the alternative remedy of filing a complaint\nwith the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights provided\nin § 10:5-13 is not available for claims involving\nalleged discrimination in land use by a municipality.\nPlaintiffs disagree, however, that § 10:5-12.5 requires\nadjudication in New Jersey Superior Court.\nThis Court concludes that the New Jersey Superior\nCourt has exclusive jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' NJLAD\nclaims.  Given the strong state interests involved in\nland use regulation, . . . it is entirely plausible\nthat the New Jersey Legislature intended to avoid\nfederal court interference in this area.  As a result,\nthis Court sees no reason not to accord § 10:12.5 its\nplain meaning.  This federal district Court lacks\njurisdiction over claims of discrimination in land use\npolicy by a municipality arising under N.J.S.A.\n10:5-12.5.\nKessler, 876 F. Supp. at 664.  No court has disagreed with this\ninterpretation, and the New Jersey Legislature has not amended\nthe NJLAD to comport with plaintiffs’ proffered interpretation. \n17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 18 of 31 PageID: 3973\nHere, as in Kessler, the redevelopment of a blighted\nneighborhood, and discrimination claims with regard to that\nredevelopment, were carved out of the NJLAD’s general enforcement\nprovision in N.J.S.A. 10:5-13, and the New Jersey Legislature\nmandated that such claims be brought in the Superior Court.  This\nCourt finds no compelling argument to deviate from that\ndirective.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ NJLAD claims pursuant to\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 must be dismissed.\nNext, the Court also agrees with the Township’s argument\nthat plaintiffs’ claims pursuant to N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 must be\ndismissed because that provision does not provide a cause of\naction.  In Bumbaca v. Township of Edison, 861 A.2d 156, 160\n(N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2004), the New Jersey Appellate\nDivision considered whether the NJLAD prohibits nepotism because\nthe statute references the term “familial status.”  In\ndetermining that the NJLAD does not prohibit the practice of\nnepotism, the court noted that even though the NJLAD “is remedial\nlegislation which must be liberally construed,” that “liberality\nof interpretation does not require turning a blind eye to the\nplain meaning of the statute, which is always our starting\npoint.”  Bumbaca, 861 A.2d at 160 (citations omitted).  The court\nthen referenced N.J.S.A. 10:5-3, which “sets forth the purposes\nof the LAD,” and N.J.S.A. 10:5-4, which “sets out the general\nsweep of the entire statutory scheme.”  Id. at 161.  Finally, the\n18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 19 of 31 PageID: 3974\ncourt referenced N.J.S.A. 10:5-12, which “sets out at length the\nspecifics of those practices deemed to constitute”\ndiscrimination.  Id.   \nEven though the Bumbaca court did not specifically address\nwhether a plaintiff can assert a cause of action pursuant to\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-4, its analysis supports the notion that the\nprovision is a “general sweep” rather than the delineation of the\nspecific practices violative of the statute.  Further, as noted\nby the Bumbaca court, the plain language of the statute is\ncontrolling, and N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 is titled, “Obtaining\nemployment, accommodations and accommodation privileges without\ndiscrimination; declaration of civil right.”  Accordingly, this\nCourt finds that N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 is simply the “declaration” of a\nperson’s rights under the NJLAD, and it is not, like N.J.S.A.\n10:5-12, a provision which creates a cause of action.\nConsequently, because plaintiffs’ N.J.S.A. 10:5-12 claim\nmust be advanced in state court and plaintiffs’ N.J.S.A. 10:5-4\nclaim is invalid, plaintiffs’ NJLAD claims must be dismissed.\n4. Counts Six and Seven - Due Process Clause of the New\nJersey and Federal Constitutions\nFundamentally, due process requires an opportunity to be\nheard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  Doe v.\nPoritz, 142 N.J. 1, 662 A.2d 367 (N.J. 1995) (citing Kahn v.\nU.S., 753 F.2d 1208, 1218 (3d Cir. 1985)).  The minimum\n19\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 20 of 31 PageID: 3975\nrequirements of due process are notice and the opportunity to be\nheard.  Id. (citing U .S. v. Raffoul, 826 F.2d 218, 222 (3d Cir.\n1987) (citing Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975))).  Plaintiffs\nclaim that the Township violated their due process rights by\nfailing to give individual notice to all owners of properties to\nbe acquired under its redevelopment plan and otherwise provide\nmeaningful notice to residents with regard to the effects of the\nredevelopment activity upon their property rights.  (Second Am.\nCompl. ¶ 226.)  Plaintiffs also allege that the Township made\nrevisions to the redevelopment plan without first holding public\nmeetings or conducting a formal process, as required by N.J.S.A.\n10:4-13 and N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, and even though the Township\neventually held open meetings with regard to the revisions, it\nhad already decided to implement them, which rendered the public\nprocess a sham.  (Id. ¶ 230.)  Plaintiffs claim that the\nTownship’s failure to conduct an open process violated their due\nprocess rights and fundamental fairness.  (Id. ¶ 232.) \nThe problem with plaintiffs’ due process claims is that they\ndo not sufficiently delineate the Township’s alleged violative\nconduct.  According to plaintiffs’ second amended complaint, the\nTownship formally adopted the original redevelopment plan in\nMarch 2005, another “concept plan” was approved in September\n2007, and the plan was revised in September 2008.  More\nspecifically, on September 22, 2008, the Township adopted the\n20\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 21 of 31 PageID: 3976\nRevised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan, which invalidated the\noriginal redevelopment plan.  It is unclear, however, which part\nof the redevelopment process allegedly violated plaintiffs’ due\nprocess rights.  Plaintiffs’ complaint generally alleges that all\naspects of the process did not adequately afford plaintiffs the\nright to be heard, and that the revised redevelopment plan was\nadopted “without meaningful consideration of the residents’\nobjections.”  (Second Amended Compl. ¶¶ 185-86.)  \nTo the extent that plaintiffs are challenging the original\nredevelopment plan, even taking as true plaintiffs’ due process\nconcerns, because that plan was invalidated, there is no\njusticiable controversy--indeed, the invalidation of the plan is\none remedy for such a violation.  Thus, any due process claims\nbased on the adoption of the original plan must be dismissed.  To\nthe extent that plaintiffs are challenging the process of the\nadoption of the revised plan, plaintiffs are directed to amend\ntheir claims to more precisely plead the basis for the alleged\ndue process violations with regard to the revised plan.2 \n2Defendants also argue that because the adoption of the\nrevised plan was a legislative act, there is no cognizable due\nprocess right, see Rogin v. Bensalem Tp., 616 F.2d 680 (3d Cir.\n1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1029 (1981), and further that even\nif such a right exists the uniquely New Jersey judicial remedy of\nan action in lieu of prerogative writ provides all the process\nthat is due. Cf., John E. Long, Inc. v. The Borough of Ringwood,\n61 F. Supp. 2d 273, 279 (D.N.J. 1998)(state satisfies due process\nby establishing means to challenge governmental action).  In\nlight of our decision to allow plaintiffs to re-plead these\ncounts, that issue is no longer ripe.  However, plaintiffs are\nreminded that any re-pleading of this due process claim must\n21\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 22 of 31 PageID: 3977\nSee Fletcher-Harlee Corp. v.

Counts Eight - Violation of the New Jersey Local\nRedevelopment and Housing Law\nPlaintiffs claim that the Township violated the New Jersey\nLocal Redevelopment and Housing Law (NJLRHL), N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1\net seq., by arbitrarily, capriciously, and unreasonably adopting\nthe revised redevelopment plan.3  Specifically, plaintiffs\nallege:  (1) the plan was revised without opportunity for\nmeaningful community input and without consideration by the\naccord with Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and should not claim a due process\nviolation where federal law does not recognize such a claim\neither because the challenged action is a legislative act or the\nstate had provided all the process that is due.  \n3The Court notes that following a bench trial on plaintiffs’\nchallenge to the original redevelopment plan, on May 5, 2005, the\nNew Jersey Superior Court found in favor of the Township and\ndeclared that the plan complied with the requirements of the\nNJLRHL.  (Second Amended Compl. ¶ 119.)\n22\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 23 of 31 PageID: 3978\nplanning board and “Council of the Residents’ comments”; (2) the\nplan does not further its own objectives; (3) the plan is\nsubstantially inconsistent with the Township’s Master Plan; (4)\nthe plan is inconsistent with the State housing plan and fails to\naddress the inconsistency mandated by N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7; (5) the\nplan does not address whether it is consistent with the County\nmaster plan, as mandated by N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7; (6) the plan is\ninconsistent with the purposes of the NJLRHL, as it “fails to\npromote the advancement of community interests and physical\ndevelopment which will be most conducive to social and economic\nimprovement.”  (Second Amended Compl. ¶ 238.)\nAs a primary matter, it is important to recognize that “the\nadoption of a redevelopment plan is essentially a legislative\nfunction of a municipal government, akin to the adoption of a\nmaster plan or a zoning ordinance.”  Milford Mill 128, LLC v.\nBorough of Milford, 946 A.2d 75, 82-83 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.\n2008).  It is also important to recognize that instead of courts,\n“municipal bodies are composed of local citizens who are far more\nfamiliar with the municipality's characteristics and interests\nand therefore uniquely equipped to resolve such controversies.” \nFirst Montclair Partner, L.P. v. Herod Redevelopment I, L.L.C.,\n885 A.2d 952, 955 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2005) (citations\nomitted).  “Consequently, courts will not upset such decisions\nunless they are arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious.”  Id.  \n23\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 24 of 31 PageID: 3979\nHere, plaintiffs fail to state a valid claim under the\nNJLRHL.  First, plaintiffs’ claim that the plan is substantially\ninconsistent with the Township’s Master Plan, the State’s housing\nplan, and the County’s master plan, is unsupportable.  The NJLRHL\nprovides, “All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be\neither substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or\ndesigned to effectuate the master plan,” but it further provides\nthat “the municipal governing body may adopt a redevelopment plan\nwhich is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the\nmaster plan by affirmative vote of a majority of its full\nauthorized membership.”  N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7(d).  Thus, even\ntaking as true plaintiffs’ claim that the revised redevelopment\nplan was inconsistent with other plans, the NJLRHL allows for\nsuch inconsistencies.  \nSecond, with regard to plaintiffs’ claim that the revised\nredevelopment plan does not address those inconsistencies,\nplaintiffs are correct that the NJLRHL requires that the “reasons\nfor so acting” are “set forth in the redevelopment plan.” \nN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7(d).  However, plaintiffs’ conclusory\nallegations of the existence of any inconsistencies, and the\naccordingly absent explanation of those inconsistencies, are\ninsufficient to state a viable claim.  Stating a viable claim \n“requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true)\nto suggest the required element,”  Phillips v. County of\n24\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 25 of 31 PageID: 3980\nAllegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Bell Atlantic\nv. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1969 n.8 (2007)); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009), and “bald assertions” or\n“legal conclusions” are inadequate, In re Burlington Coat Factory\nSec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1429-30 (3d Cir. 1997).  Plaintiffs\ndo not allege any facts describing how the revised redevelopment\nplan differs from the County’s master plan and the State’s\nhousing plan.4  Without these facts, it cannot be determined\nwhether those inconsistencies were not contained in the revised\nredevelopment plan.  The failure of plaintiffs to include these\nbasic factual allegations is fatal to their claims.\nWith regard to plaintiffs’ claims that the public was not\nafforded meaningful input, this is simply a restatement of their\ndue process claim, and plaintiffs do not point to a provision in\nthe NJLRHL that requires such public input.  With regard to\nplaintiffs’ claims that the revised plan does not further its own\nobjectives, and is otherwise inconsistent with the NJLRHL,5 these\n4Plaintiffs’ complaint states that the revised redevelopment\nplan “acknowledges that it is inconsistent with the Township\nMaster Plan because it does not reduce density and because it\ncalls for total demolition rather than rehabilitation of existing\nhomes, but concludes that this inconsistency is warranted based\non economic conditions and redeveloper preference.  The Plan\nstates that it there would be no adverse impacts to neighboring\nWesthampton Township land uses and that the Plan is consistent\nwith the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.”  (Second\nAmended Compl. ¶ 183(f).)\n5N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-2 states:\nThe Legislature hereby finds, determines and declares:\n25\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 26 of 31 PageID: 3981\nare also conclusory claims and provide no basis for the court to\nupset the decision of the municipality and determine that the\nTownship’s actions were arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. \nConsequently, plaintiffs’ NJLRHL claims must be dismissed.  \n6. Count Nine - Violation the General Welfare Clause of\nthe New Jersey Constitution\nPlaintiffs claim that the Township’s use of its municipal\npowers to redevelop existing low income residential neighborhoods\nviolates the General Welfare Clause of the New Jersey\nConstitution.  Plaintiffs’ claim is based on the Mt. Laurel\ndoctrine, which prohibits municipalities from using their zoning\na. There exist, have existed and persist in various\ncommunities of this State conditions of deterioration in housing,\ncommercial and industrial installations, public services and\nfacilities and other physical components and supports of\ncommunity life, and improper, or lack of proper, development\nwhich result from forces which are amenable to correction and\namelioration by concerted effort of responsible public bodies,\nand without this public effort are not likely to be corrected or\nameliorated by private effort.\nb. From time to time the Legislature has, by various\nenactments, empowered and assisted local governments in their\nefforts to arrest and reverse these conditions and to promote the\nadvancement of community interests through programs of\nredevelopment, rehabilitation and incentives to the expansion and\nimprovement of commercial, industrial, residential and civic\nfacilities.\nc. As a result of those efforts, there has grown a varied\nand complex body of laws, all directed by diverse means to the\nprincipal goal of promoting the physical development that will be\nmost conducive to the social and economic improvement of the\nState and its several municipalities.\nd. It is the intent of this act to codify, simplify and\nconcentrate prior enactments relative to local redevelopment and\nhousing, to the end that the legal mechanisms for such\nimprovement may be more efficiently employed.\n26\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 27 of 31 PageID: 3982\nlaws to exclude lower income households and obligates them to\naffirmatively provide a realistic opportunity for construction of\nits fair share of law and moderate income housing.  See Southern\nBurlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 336 A.2d 713 (N.J.\n1975); Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 456 A.2d\n390 (N.J. 1983).  The Mt. Laurel doctrine, however, has never\nbeen applied to municipal redevelopment powers.  The Township\nargues, and plaintiffs agree, that because this claim is one of\nfirst impression under New Jersey state law, this Court should\ndecline subject matter jurisdiction over this state law claim\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1), and dismiss this claim\nwithout prejudice.  The Court agrees with this approach.  See\nTrump Hotels & Casino Resorts, Inc. v. Mirage Resorts Inc., 140\nF.3d 478, 487 (3d Cir. 1998) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(1);\nBorough of West Mifflin v. Lancaster, 45 F.3d 780, 788 (3d Cir.\n1995)) (stating that supplemental jurisdiction is exercised as a\nmatter of discretion, and a court may decline to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim where “the claim\nraises a novel or complex issue of state law”).  This is\nespecially true when a claim turns on a interpretation of a state\nconstitution. Kadetsky v. Egg Harbor Tp. Bd. Of Ed., 164 F. Supp.\n2d 425, 436 (D.N.J. 2001).  Here the need for deference is even\nmore pronounced.  The Mt. Laurel doctrine, its judicial\nreiteration, the legislative response, the continuing\n27\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 28 of 31 PageID: 3983\nimplementation of an administrative process, and the intensely\nlocal impact of this evolving right, present a complex web best\nleft to the expertise and sound judgment of the New Jersey\ncourts.6   \n7. Punitive Damage claims\nPlaintiffs are seeking punitive damages for all of their\nclaims.  The Township has moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ request\nfor punitive damages, arguing that under various legal\nprinciples, punitive damages cannot be imposed against\nmunicipalities.  \nTo the extent that plaintiffs’ NJLAD, NJLRHL, and General\nWelfare Clause claims will be dismissed (Counts Four, Eight, and\nNine), the Township’s argument with regard to those claims is\nmoot.  With regard to plaintiffs’ claims brought pursuant to 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (Counts Three and Seven - Equal Protection Clause\nand Due Process Clause), punitive damages are unavailable against\nthe Township.  It is well-established that municipalities, and\nmore broadly, state and local governments entities, are immune\nfrom punitive damages under § 1983.  City of Newport v. Fact\nConcerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271 (1981); Doe v. County of\n6In light of this disposition, the Court need not address\nwhether this count fails to state of claim because defendants\nhave followed the regulatory scheme established by the New Jersey\nFair Housing Act and the Council on Affordable Housing.  Indeed,\nin light of our decision to decline the exercise of supplemental\njurisdiction, it would be inconsistent for us to do so.  \n28\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 29 of 31 PageID: 3984\nCentre, PA, 242 F.3d 437, 455 (3d Cir. 2001).  With regard to\nplaintiffs’ state constitutional claims (Counts Five and Six),\nthe New Jersey Tort Claim Act bars the imposition of punitive\ndamages against the municipality.  N.J.S.A. 59:9-2(c); Herrera v.\nCity of New Brunswick, 2008 WL 305275, *17 (D.N.J. 2008).  With\nregard to plaintiffs’ FHA and Civil Rights Act claims (Counts One\nand Two), the Court will reserve decision on this issue pending\nconsideration of the converted motions.\n8. Claims against the individual defendants\nFor the claims plaintiffs have asserted against the\nTownship, plaintiffs have also asserted them against Kathleen\nHoffman, in her official capacity as township manager, and Jules\nThiessen, in his official capacity as mayor.  Defendants have\nmoved to dismiss these claims against them because none of the\nallegations in the complaint refer to actions taken by Hoffman or\nThiessen specifically, but rather to the Township, Council, or\nthe Planning Board.  Defendants also argue that they have\nimmunity from plaintiffs’ claims because if any allegations in\nthe complaint can be construed as against them, they were acting\nin their legislative or discretionary capacities, which entitles\nthem to absolute immunity.\nIn opposition to defendants’ motion, plaintiffs argue that\nthey need the benefit of discovery in order to lodge specific\nallegations against Hoffman and Thiessen.  Until discovery is\n29\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 30 of 31 PageID: 3985\ncomplete and the full extent of their conduct is known,\nplaintiffs argue that the legal issue of whether Hoffman or\nThiessen are entitled to immunity cannot be decided.  Plaintiffs\nfurther note, however, that they “do not seek to hold Hoffman and\nThiessen personally liable for money damages, but merely ask for\nthe same injunctive relief against Hoffman and Thiessen as they\nseek against the Township.”  (Pl. Opp. at 39 n.16.)\nUnder the pleading standard clarified in Bell Atlantic v.\nTwombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1969 n.8 (2007) and reaffirmed in\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009), a plaintiff\ncannot use the discovery process to find, in the first instance,\nfacts to support general claims advanced against a defendant. \nRather, a plaintiff must allege enough “factual matter (taken as\ntrue) to suggest” that a defendant may be liable for the alleged\nviolation.  Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 234\n(3d Cir. 2008).  Here, plaintiffs admit that they are not\ncurrently aware of facts to more-specifically plead their claims\nagainst Hoffman and Thiessen.  Indeed, they argue that\ndefendants’ immunity challenge cannot be resolved because of the\nabsence of such facts.  Consequently, plaintiffs’ claims against\nHoffman and Thiessen will be dismissed without prejudice to\nplaintiffs’ right to reassert their claims against them when, and\nif, they have gathered sufficient facts to state a viable claim.7\n7In light of this disposition, the Court need not address\nthe individual defendants’ alternative argument that they are\n30\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 102   Filed 10/23/09   Page 31 of 31 PageID: 3986\nCONCLUSION\n For the reasons expressed above, defendants’ motions to\ndismiss will be granted in part, denied in part, and continued in\npart.  Counts Four, Eight, and Nine are dismissed as to all\ndefendants.  Counts Six and Seven are dismissed without prejudice\nto plaintiffs’ right to amend their complaint within 30 days to\nmore-specifically plead those claims.  Counts One, Two, Three,\nand Five are converted into motions for summary judgment;\nplaintiffs shall have 30 days to oppose defendants’ converted\nmotions on these counts.  All counts are dismissed without\nprejudice as to defendants Hoffman and Thiessen.  An appropriate\nOrder will be entered.\nDate: October 23, 2009 s/ Noel L.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT \n1.  This is a civil rights action challenging Mount Holly Township’s (“Township”) wide-\nscale redevelopment of the neighborhood known as  Mt. Holly Gardens (“Gardens”).  Plaintiffs \nare an asso ciation of residents, Mt. Holly Gardens Citize ns in Actio n, Inc.,  (“CIA”), and 29 \nindividual residents (“Residents”) living in the Gardens, which is a cohesive, ethnically diverse \nneighborhood within Mt. Holly Township that is predominantly African-American and Hispanic \nwith m ostly low and moderate in come f amilies.  CIA a nd Residents are  cha llenging th e \nTownship’s sweeping redevelopm ent project that  is demolishing existing hom es, displacing \nnumerous families, and dismantling and destroying the entire Gardens neighborhood.            \n2.  The Township and its redevelopers have  been and currently are aggress ively \nimplementing their redevelopment project, ultimately seeking acquisition, through purchase and \neminent domain, and total demolition of all 329  homes within the Gardens redevelopm ent area \naffordable to curr ent and displaced families and replacement with new, m uch higher-priced \nmarket rate hom es intended for households th at are more affluent.  In carrying out \nredevelopment, the Township and its redevelopers have greatly increased blighted conditions and \nhave rendered the Gardens unsafe and unlivable.    Among other things, under the implied threa t \n \n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 3 of 55 PageID: 3\nof eminent domain, the Township has sys tematically acquired, vacated and boarded up m ore \nthan 200 previously occupied homes—approxim ately two-thirds of all  residential properties \nwithin the Gardens—and has demolished to date approximately 70 properties. If not stopped, the \nTownship and its redev elopers will succeed in  irrevocably tearing do wn the m ost identifiable \nminority community within Mt. Holly—with the highest rates of African-American and Hispanic \nhomeownership within Burlington County—and  permanently displacing hundreds of lower \nincome minority residents from their community where they will no longer be able to afford to \nlive.   \n3.  In prio r state court litig ation, the Town ship’s findin g of “blight,” i.e., its \ndetermination that the Garden s neighborhood m et New Je rsey’s criteria for designation as an \n“area in need of redevelopm ent,” was upheld in  April 2005.   However, in August 2005 and \nsubsequently upheld on appeal in 2007, CIA’s and Re sidents’ civil rights and other substantive \nchallenges to the redevelopment plan were dismissed without prejudice as then not being ripe for \nadjudication. \n4.   These claims are now unquestionably ripe  in light of the Township’s subsequent \ndestructive im plementation ac tions devastating the Gardens  community.  Specifically, the \nTownship and its redevelopers have unlawfully  discriminated against the Residents on the basis \nof race and national origin in violation of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § \n3601 et seq.; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.  § 1982; the New Jersey Law Against \nDiscrimination, N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq.; and Equal Protection under  the United States and New \nJersey Constitu tions.  Furthe rmore, the To wnship’s a ctions depr ive Res idents of  ju st \ncompensation by driving down the value of thei r homes, while the Township has f ailed to \n \n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 4 of 55 PageID: 4\nadequately plan or prepare for replacem ent hous ing realistically affordable to curren t and \ndisplaced residents.  \n5.  The Township has also  acted arbitrarily, capriciously, unreasonably,  ultra vires and \nunconstitutionally, by making substantial de facto changes to the red evelopment plan in clo sed \nmeetings and implementing the revisions withou t engaging in the public process m andated by \nlaw to amend a redevelopment plan, in violation of the New Jersey Loc al Redevelopment and \nHousing Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et. seq., and the Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:40-6 \net. seq., as well as procedural due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution and fundamental fairness protected under Article 1, Paragraph 1 of \nthe New Jersey Constitution.  The Township  has add itionally acte d unconstitutionally in \nviolation of the general welfare under Article I, Paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution, by \ncarrying out redevelopment activities that will result in the destruction and substantial net loss of \nhousing affordable to low and moderate income families, as well as the forcible displacement of \nhundreds of low and moderate income residents from the  Gardens community without providing \naffordable replacement housing.   \n6.  Residents and CIA se ek, am ong other thi ngs, declaratory and injunctive relief: \ninvalidating the redevelopment plan; mandating that the Township carry out redevelopment in \nthe Gardens in a manner having the least discriminatory adverse impact upon African-American \nand Hispanic households; and prohibiting implementation without providing adequate affordable \nreplacement housing for all current and displace d Gardens residents. R esidents and CIA als o \nseek damages and/or just compensation sufficient for Residents to secure permanent replacement \nhousing in the local housing market.  \nII.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Mt. Holly Gardens Neighborhood  \n38.  Mt. Holly Gardens (“the Gardens”) is situated on 30 acres of land within downtown \nMt. Holly Township in Burlington County, New Jersey.  \n39.  It is a cohesive, racially and ethnically diverse community.  \n40.  At the time the redevelopment process started in 2000, the neighborhood contained \n329 houses. \n41.  The houses were constructed during the 1950s.  \n42.  Houses are prim arily two-story buildings of solid bric k construction with joists \nmade of old-growth hardwood, and are situated in rows of 8 to 10 homes set back approximately \n50 feet from the street, allowing for front and back yards.  \n43.  Many homes are well-m aintained and ha ve attractively landscaped yards and \ngardens.  \n44.  Until approximately March 2004 there was  a playground area of app roximately \n14,000 square feet and a community center co nverted from a dwelling unit, both  which the \nTownship owned.  \nB.  Residents of Mt. Holly Gardens  \n45. According to the 2000 U.S. Cens us, Bu rlington County’s total population was \n423,394. Of the total population, W hites  comprised 323,171—76.3%; African-Am ericans \ncomprised 62,476—14.8%; and Hispanics comprised 17,632—4.2%.  \n \n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 11 of 55 PageID: 11\n46.  According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Mount  Holly Township’s total population was \n10,728. Of the total population, Whites comprised 7,101—66.2%; African-Americans comprised \n2,231 —20.8%; and Hispanics comprised 942 —8.8%.  \n47.  The reside ntial sectio n of  the Gard ens redevelop ment area correspon ds \napproximately to Blocks 1000, 1001, 1003 and 1009 of  U.S. Census Tract 7026.04., Burlington  \nCounty, New Jersey.  \n48.  Approximately 1,031 residents lived within   the Census Blocks corresponding to \nthe residential section of the Gardens redevelopment area. Within the residential section of the \nGardens redevelopm ent area, W hites com prised approxim ately 203 residents—only 19.7%, \ncompared to 475—46.1% —African-American residents and 297—28.8%—Hispanic residents. \n49.  Thus, African-Am erican and Hispanic  residents com prised the overwhelm ing \nmajority—nearly 75%—of the residents living in the Gardens redevelopment area. \n50.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the concentration of African-American \nand Hispanic residents in the Gardens was  the highest of any neighborhood in Mt. Holly \nTownship and much higher compared to Burlington County, while the concentration of Whites \nwas comparatively much lower. \na.  46.1% of the Gardens redevelopm ent area was African-Am erican, compared to \nonly 20.8% for Mt. Holly Township and 14.8 % for Burlington County. \nb.  28.8% of the Gardens redevelopment area was Hispanic, compared to only 8.8%  \nfor Mt. Holly Township and only 4.2% for Burlington County. \nc.  Only 19.7% of the Gardens redevelopm ent area was non-Hispanic, W hite, \ncompared to 66.2% for Mt. Holly Town ship and was 76.3% for Burlington \nCounty.    \n \n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 12 of 55 PageID: 12\nd.  In addition, approxim ately 31.5% of Mt . H olly Township’s entire Hispanic \npopulation and approxim ately 21,3% of Mt . Holly Township’s entire African-\nAmerican population lived within the Ga rdens redevelopment area, compared to \nonly 2.9% of the entire non-Hispanic, White population.   \n51.  Further, according to the 2000 U.S. Census, the m edian household incom e in the \nGardens redevelopment area was only $30,104, while  the median income for the Township was \n$43,284, and the median income of Burlington County was $58,608.  \n52.   According to the 2000 Census, in Census Tract 7026.04 containing the Gardens, the \nhousing characteristics were as follows: \na.  50% of the households in Census Tract  7026.04 were renters, and 50% were \nhomeowners.  \nb.  31% of the African-American households were homeowners while the percentage \nin the entire Township was 13%, and the percentage in the County was 11%.   \nc.  17% of the Hispanic households were  homeowners while th e percentage in the \nentire Township was 8%, and the percentage in the County was 2%.  \nd.  81% of the owner-occupied households in Census Tract 7026.4 had lived in their \nhomes for at least 9 years, while 72% of the renter-occupied households had lived \nin their homes for at least 5 years.  \ne.  The median cost of homeownership for owner-occupied homes with mortgages in \nCensus Tract 7026.04 was only $969 a m onth, com pared to $1,536 for the \nTownship and $1,393 for the County.   \n53.   According to the 2000 Census, the Gardens neighborhood therefore had a mong the \nhighest rates of African-American and Hispanic home ownership in Burlington County.   \n \n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 13 of 55 PageID: 13\n54.  Despite the lower incom es of the Gardens’ households, the com munity is \nremarkably stable and has many longtime residents.  \n55.  Residents have a strong sense of comm unity and like  that it is racially and \nethnically diverse. \n56.  Many Gardens residents have family and friends living in the neighborhood.    \n57.  Residents enjoy the convenient location of the Gardens and its proximity to schools, \nemployment, businesses, and downtown.  \n58.  The stability of the Gardens neighborhood is  attributable in part to lower housing \ncosts than that of Mt. Holly and Burlington  County, making the Gardens m ore affordable for  \nlower income households. \n59.  According to a m ore recent survey conducted by Tria d in July 2006, the average \nmonthly homeowner cost being paid in the Gardens is $445 and the average rent is $696. \n60.  In addition, many longtime homeowners of th e Gardens, particularly seniors, paid \noff their mortgages in full and can afford to keep their homes, although they would not be able to \npurchase much higher-priced homes in the current real estate market on their present incomes. \n61.  According to a survey conducted by pla nners commissioned by the Township in \n2000, 90% of the households in  the Gardens had annual in comes below $40,000, 43% earned \nbetween $20,000 and $40,000, and nearly half—47%—earned less than $20,000. \nC.  Redevelopment Activities Before 2002  \n62.  For alm ost thirty years, comm unity m embers and Mt. Holly Township have \nengaged in various planning initiatives to improve living conditions in the neighborhood. \n63.  These planning initiatives included a co mmunity-led effort in the 1980’s that \nresulted in developm ent of a strategy to incr ease the hom eownership rate through targeted \n \n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 14 of 55 PageID: 14\nproperty acquisition and rehabi litation; howev er, th is str ategy was never adopted by the \nTownship.  \n64.  Another planning initiative was a housing  rehabilitation program known as “Mt. \nHolly 2000.”  Through this program, ten hom eowners in the Gardens obtain ed grants and loans \nto fix up their properties.   \n65.  The Township subsequently decided not to  support such re vitalization efforts.  I t \ninstead began to plan for a sweeping redevelopm ent of the entire community that would involve \nacquisition and demolition of most or all of the Gardens homes.  \n66.  In 2000, the Township began to purchase properties in the Gardens and leave them  \nvacant  \n67.  In 2000, the Council also comm issioned a priv ate firm, THP, Inc., to investigate \nwhether the Gardens neighborhood met the criteria of an “area in need of redevelopment” within \nthe meaning of N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et. seq.   \n68.  In November 2000, T HP, Inc. prepared  a report entitled “Redevelopm ent Area \nDetermination Report” (“2000 Redevelopment Report”), which it presented to the Council. \n69.  As part of the preparation of this 2000 Re development Report, the planners \nconducted a survey of the Gardens residents.  \n70.  The survey dem onstrated that when questioned about the Township’s plans for \nredevelopment, residents were concerned abou t displacement and that m ore than 2/3 of the \nresidents stated that they would prefer to remain living in the Gardens. \nD.  Redevelopment Planning and Formal Adoption of Redevelopment Plan \n71.  The Township adopted a Master Plan pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law, \nN.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., dated April 13, 2000.   \n \n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 15 of 55 PageID: 15\n72.  The Master Plan set forth certain goals, which included improving the qualify of \nMount Holly’s housing stock, upgrading the Gardens Area, and utilizing the LRHL to Mount \nHolly’s best advantage.  \n73.  With regard to the upgrade of the Gardens area, the Master Plan stated that one \nobjective of this Master Plan is to upgrade the quality of units and the character of area, and that \nmeasures should be taken to reduce the overall density in the Gardens Area, to rehabilitate \ndeteriorated units, and to provide additional amenities. \n74.  In the land use plan element, the Master Plan characterizes the Gardens as one of \ntwo “high density areas” containing some deteriorated units, high proportion of rental properties, \nand with overcrowding an identified problem. The Master Plan recommended \n“redevelopment/revitalization” to allow for reduction of density, modernization of housing stock, \nand improvement to overall perception of the area. \n75.  On July 30, 2002, Council passed Reso lution No. 2002-166 authorizing the \nTownship’s Planning Board to undertake a preliminary investigation and to hold a public hearing \nto determine whether the Gardens neighborhood was an area in need of redevelopment.  \n76.  The Planning Board subsequently received  a report prepared by THP, Inc. entitled \n“Redevelopment Area Determination Report,” dated September 3, 2002.  \n77.  The September 3, 2002 Redevelopm ent Area Determination Report was alm ost \nidentical to the 2000 Redevelopment Report prepared for Council.  \n78.  On September 16, 2002, the Planning Board  held the first public hearing on the \nquestion whether the Gardens should be designated as a redevelopment area. \n79.  On October 21, 2002, the Planning Board passed Resolution No. 2002-10, adopting \nthe findings and conclusions of the 2002 Rede velopment Report and recomm ending that the \n \n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 16 of 55 PageID: 16\nTownship Council designate the Gardens neigh borhood as a “redevelopm ent area” within the \nmeaning of N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et. seq. \n80.  On October 28, 2002, the Council passed  Resolution No. 2002-217, accepting the \nfactual findings of the 2002 Redevelopmen t Report, accepting the Planning Board’s \nrecommendations and f ormally designating the Gardens neighborhood as an area in need of  \nredevelopment under N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. \n81.  Resolution No. 2002-217 did not state or ot herwise indicate that by designating the \nGardens neighborhood as an area in need of rede velopment, homes in the Gardens would be \ndemolished. \n82.  At the Planning Board hearing and at  the Council m eeting, Township officials \nmisled Residents by telling them  that in cluding their p roperties in  an area in need of \nredevelopment did not mean that the Township would take their properties by eminent domain.   \n83.  In April 2003, the Council publicly releas ed a docum ent entitled “The Gardens \nArea Redevelopment Plan” (“Gardens Redevelopment Plan”).   \n84.  The Gardens Redevelopment Plan provided for the following:  \na.  Total demolition of all the hom es in the neighborhood and relocation o f all the \nresidents.  \nb.  Building 180 new housing units.  \nc.  No construction of any affordable housing units.  \nd.  No guarantee that any new housing in  the redevelopment community would be \nmade available for Gardens residents either before or after displacement.  \ne.  No guarantee that any new housing in  the redevelopment community would be \nrealistically affordable for Gardens residents.  \n \n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 17 of 55 PageID: 17\nf.  Building only 30 rental units, available only to seniors. \n85.  The proposed 180 new units would be m uch more expensive than existing hom es; \ntherefore, the plan would perm anently displace current residents who are predom inately low-\nincome.  \n86.  On August 11, 2003, the Township held a  public hearing on the adoption of the \nGardens Redevelopment Plan.   \n87.  Over 100 residents appeared  before the Council protes ting against the proposed \nredevelopment plan and the demolition of their homes.   \n88.  Among the objections raised by the residents were the following: \na.  They feel a strong sense of community and have pride in the community.  \nMany are long-term  residents.  T hey feel surrounded by fa mily and \nfriends.  They like that it is racially and ethnically diverse.  \nb.  Many residents are low-incom e.  Som e had bee n homeless in the past.   \nThey are f earful that th ey will not be  able to a fford the new units tha t \nwere being planned for construction and that they will not be able to find \nother housing in the area they could afford. \nc.  Some residents, including some elderly homeowners, have paid off thei r \nmortgages.  They are af raid that if they lose their homes they will never \nbe able to purchase another one.  \n89.  Also on August 11, 2003, Plaintiff CIA submitted to the Township Council detailed \nwritten objections to the Gardens Redevelopm ent Plan with proposed alternatives to dem olition \nof the residents’ hom es, including that the Ga rdens Redevelopment Plan was drafted without \nmeaningful input from the residents and in disregard of the residents’ needs; that it discriminated \n \n17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 18 of 55 PageID: 18\nagainst African-American and Hispanic residents on the basis of race and et hnicity; that it did \nnot realistically provide for housing that was decent and affordable for the residen ts, either as to \nunits to be newly constructed in the Gardens area or replacement housing elsewhere in Mt. Holly \nTownship or Burlington County; and that it  would cause severe hardship by f orcing most \nresidents, many of whom have lived in the Ga rdens for many years, to lose their hom es and \nmove out of their community. \n90.  On September 8, 2003, the Township  Council passed Ordinance No. 2003-12 \nadopting the Gardens Redevelopment Plan as originally proposed. \n91.  On October 23, 2003, Plaintiffs CIA and 35 i ndividual residents filed an action in \nthe Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Di vision, Docket No. BU R-L-003027-03, challenging \nthe designation of the Gardens as an area in n eed of redevelopm ent and the adoption of the  \nGardens Redevelopment Plan under state law and on civil rights and constitutional grounds.  \n92.  In February 2005, the Township Council dir ected the Planning Board to consider \namending the Gardens Redevelopment Plan.   \n93.  On February 21, 2005, the Planning Board held a public hearing concerning a \nrevised redevelopment plan called the West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan (WR Redevelopment \nPlan), which encom passed the Gardens neighb orhood and increased the area for commercial \nredevelopment. \n94.  The WR Redevelopment Plan proposed the following:  \na.  228 new residential units. \nb.  Permitted residential uses increased up to 50% for two-family dwellings, \nup to 33% for townhouse/sen ior apartment combination d wellings, and \n \n18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 19 of 55 PageID: 19\nup to 33% for townhouses.  The permitted uses; however, did not include \nany multifamily rental units.  \nc.   Demolition of existin g hom es and  new construction of the above \npermitted uses. \nd.  Possible rehabilitation of existing  units, but rehabilitation was purely \noptional with no specified am ount or  percentage of existing residential \nunits that were to be rehabilitated. \ne.  Only 10% of the 228 dwelling un its—a total of 23—to be affordable \nhousing units, with the remaining 205 units to be market rate units. \nf.    Commercial development in  the  are adjacent to the Mt.  Holly Bypass \nRoad on the western edge of the redevelopment area. \n95.  Many Gardens residents appeared and s poke at the Planning Board hearing on \nFebruary 21, 2005, raising the sam e objections to  the proposed W R Redevelopment Plan that \nthey had raised concerning the Gardens Redevelopment Plan.  \n96.  Also on February 21, 2005, a planning e xpert, Alan Mallach, FAICP, PP, \nsubmitted a repor t and  testif ied o n behalf  of  the re sidents reg arding the pro posed W R \nRedevelopment Plan.   \n97.  In the report, Mr. Mallach opined that the rehabilitation option under the Plan was \nat best illusory and that given the lower-income status of most of the Gardens residents, very few \nif any of the families could afford the 205 market rate units.  \n98.  Mr. Ma llach also tes tified that the  Township could improve the Gardens \ncommunity using much less drastic alternatives than the large-scale acquisition and demolition \ncalled for the WR Redevelopment Plan.  \n \n19\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 20 of 55 PageID: 20\n99.  In addition, Plaintiff CIA subm itted detailed written comments to th e Planning \nBoard on February 21, 2005, raising num erous objections and recommendations, including: that \nthe WR Redevelopment Plan should m andate as an overriding goal that existing hom es be \nrehabilitated instead of de molished to avoid  displacement of resi dents; th at th e W R \nRedevelopment Plan should permit multifamily rental housing—which constituted at leas t half \nof the existing resid ential units in  the Garde ns—among the perm itted uses; th at the W R \nRedevelopment Plan unlawfully discriminated against African-American and Hispanic residents \non the basis of race and ethnicity; and that the WR Redevelopment Plan’s limit of 23 affordable \nhousing units was a misapplication of the new growth share regulations promulgated by the New \nJersey Council on Affordable H ousing (“COAH”) and was otherw ise contrary to the general \nwelfare under the New Jersey Constitution. \n100.  At the conclusion of the public hearing on February 21, 2005, the Planning Board \npassed a resolution recommending that the Council adopt the WR Redevelopment Plan, with the \nrecommendation to increase th e townhouse perm itted us e to up to 75% of the total 228 \nresidential units. \n101.  The Planning Board did not recomm end adoption of any amendments addressing \nthe concerns raised by the residents and plaintiffs. \n102.  On March 14, 2005, the Township Council held a public hearing on the adoption \nof the WR Redevelopment Plan.   \n103.  Many residents appeared and voiced  similar concerns  against the WR \nRedevelopment Plan as stated before the Planning Board.   \n104.  Plaintiffs also subm itted written c omments sim ilar to th ose pres ented to the \nPlanning Board. \n \n20\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 21 of 55 PageID: 21\n105.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Township Council adopted Ordinance 2005-\n07, adopting the WR Redevelopment Plan. \n106.  The Township Council disregarded all of  the input it received from  the Gardens \nresidents and failed to address the residents’ objections and concerns.   \n107.  The Township officials  made false, m isleading, and/or inaccurate statem ents in \nresponse to public comments regarding the designation of the Gardens community as an area in \nneed of redevelopment and regarding the adopti on of the Gardens Redevelopm ent Plan and the \nWR Redevelopment Plan.  \n108.  The Township also took other actions to avoid informing the residents of its plans \nand to minimize public comment and participation in the redevelopment process.  \n109.  CIA and the other plaintiffs in the stat e court litigation amended their complaint \nto alleg e that the ad option of  the W R Rede velopment Plan was in violation of stat e \nredevelopment law, civil rights laws, and the federal and state constitutions.  \n110.  On April 17, 2005, the Superior Court, the Hon. John Sweeney, held a bench trial \non the issue s of whether the Garde ns met the st atutory criteria of a redevelopm ent area and \nwhether the W R Redevelopment Plan com plied with the re quirements of LRHL. On May 5, \n2005, the court ruled in fa vor of the Township and entered  judgment dismissing the prerogative \nwrit claims.  \n111.  On August 30, 2005, Judge Sw eeney granted the Township summ ary judgment \ndismissing without prejudice the re sidents’ civil rights and cons titutional claims upon finding \nthat they were not ripe for adjudication.  \n112.  On July 5, 2007, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, affirmed the \nrulings of the trial court.  On December 11, 2007, the New Jersey Suprem e Court denied th e \n \n21\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 22 of 55 PageID: 22\nresidents’ petition for certif ication, and on February 5, 2008,  the New Jersey Suprem e Court \ndenied the residents’ motion for reconsideration.  \n113.  The Gardens redevelopment project is the only redeve lopment initiative in M t. \nHolly Township dur ing the las t 10 years that calls f or large-scale demolition of homes and \ndisplacement of residents. \n114.  The Township conducted a reexamination of its Master Plan in June 2007.  \n115.  The Master Plan Reexam ination repeats  the discussion of the Gardens in the \nMaster Plan, and notes that the T ownship is improving the Gardens Ar ea by declaring it a \nredevelopment area and adopting the W R Redevelopment Plan, which includes residential and \nnon-residential properties, as recommended in the Master Plan.  \n116.  The Reexam ination includes a secti on of specific recommendations, which \nincorporate the specific  proposals set out in the W R Re development Plan for Residential, \nCommercial, Limited Industrial, and open space uses.  The Reexamination does not propose any \nchanges to the Master Plan with regard to the Gardens Area.  \nE.  Township’s and Redevelopers’ Implementation of the Redevelopment Plan \n1.  Acquisition of Properties \n117.  By 2002, at the tim e the Gardens Plan  was being considered by the Planning \nBoard and Council, the Township had acquired a total of 20 units, which it had intentionally left \nvacant and boarded up rather than attempting to renovate or sell them.   \n118.  On November 10, 2003, the Township Council enacted Ordinance No. 2003-37, \nauthorizing Township of ficials to negotia te and acquire all of the properties located in the  \nGardens redevelopment area by voluntary sale or , if necessary, by condemnation, at a price no t \nto exceed fair market value.   \n \n22\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 23 of 55 PageID: 23\n119.  After adoption of the WR Redevelopm ent Plan in 2005, the Township increased \nits efforts to acquire homes in the Gardens.  \n120.  In or about March 2005, the Township pur chased the 62 rental properties from \nFry Properties for approximately $53,000 per unit totaling $3.27 million.  \n121.  In or about April 2006, the Township obtained an appraisal report, which \ndetermined that the value of  a one-bedroom house in the  Gardens was $32,000, a tw o-bedroom \nhouse was $39,000, and a three-bedroom house was $49,000.  \n122.  Since 2006, the Township has purchased num erous homes at prices ranging from \n$32,000 to $49,000, except for two pur chases at $64,000 and one  purchase at $81,000 for \nproperties that contained two units converted into one larger home.  \n123.  By December 2007, the Township had acquired a total of 219 residential units out \nof the 329 original homes in the Gardens redevelopment area. Most of these residential units had \nbeen occupied by tenants or homeowners before the Township acquired them. The Township had \ndemolished 42 of its acquired units, and kept 165 of the remaining 177 units vacant and boarded.  \n124.  Because the Township had not re-rented  or re-sold its units upon acquisition, the \nTownship’s acquisitions increased the overall vacancy rate in the Gardens to nearly 65%.  \n125.  Since December 2007, the Township has de molished an additional 31 residential \nunits, for a total 73 demolished units,  \n126.  The only measures the Township has taken  to secure its vacant properties has to \nput particle board panels on th e windows and to plaster large or ange “no trespassing signs” on \nthem. \n \n23\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 24 of 55 PageID: 24\n127.  The Township has not adequately secured  or maintained the houses and yards of \nthe properties it owns, allowing these properties  to deteriorate and becom e vandalized by \ntrespassers.  \n128.  The vacant Township-owned properties have caused and are continuing to cause a \nseverely blighting and deleterious effect  on the Gardens neighborhood, created risk of \ninfestation, fire hazards, and mold, and   encouraged further disinvestment in the community. \n129.  The Township and Redevelopers have made and are continuing to make offers to \nGardens property owners to purchase units  for the prices of $32,000 for a one-bedroom  house, \n$39,000 for a two-bedroom house, and $49,000 for a three-bedroom house. \n130.  The Township recently initiated the eminent domain process against one absentee \nproperty owner to acquire additional properties.  \n131.  On April 12, 2008, the Township Council in troduced and passed on first reading \nOrdinance 2008-12. The Ordinance states that the Township is or wi ll be the owner of all of the \nproperties in the redevelopm ent area, and author izes the Mayor, and/or the Township Manager  \nand/or Township Clerk to negotiate and execute  a Purchase and Sale Agreem ent, and all o ther \nnecessary documents, between the Township and Re developers for all of the properties for the  \nminimum purchase price of $9 million and to execute any documents necessary to effectuate the \nsale, including any documents that may be required for Eminent Domain proceedings.   \n2.  Selection of Redevelopers  \n132.  On February 15, 2006, the Township executed a Redevelopm ent Agreement with \nDefendant Keating. \n133.   In or about March 2006, Keating hired  Triad to conduct the  relocation activities \nassociated with the WR Redevelopment Plan.  \n \n24\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 25 of 55 PageID: 25\n134.   Pursuant to Exhibit C of the Redevel opment Agreement, Keating was to form a \nsingle purpose limited liability corporation with another redevel oper, Pennrose Properties, with \nKeating assigning its rights and obligations und er the Redevelopment Agreement to the newly \nformed LLC and m aintaining majority ownership.  Upon inform ation and belief, the single \npurpose limited liability corpora tion described in Exhibit C  of the Redevelopm ent Agreement \nhas not yet been formed and is presently not in existence. \n135.  Keating subsequently began to take vari ous actions to m ove the redevelopm ent \nproject forward including obtaini ng a survey; negotiating on beha lf of the Township f or the \nacquisition of a num ber of properties; m eeting with various professionals such as planners, \narchitects, and engineers; and submitting applications for permits and approvals.  \n136.  On February 23, 2007, the Redevelopers  becam e responsible for property \nmanagement of the Township-owned properties.  \n3.  Relocation of Gardens Residents \n137.  On September 28, 20 06, the To wnship subm itted a Workable Relocation \nAssistance Plan (“Relocation Plan”) to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs.  \n138.  The Relocation Plan provided the following: \na.  Proposed relocation of all current Gardens residents.  \nb.  A “Right of First Opportunity” for residents to return to the Gardens area \nafter the redevelopment project is completed. \nc.  No provision that any replacem ent units realistically affordable to the  \nresidents would be created in the Gardens  \n \n25\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 26 of 55 PageID: 26\nd.  No provision that any replacem ent units realistically affordable to the  \nresidents would be created in any other areas in the Towns hip or in the \nsurrounding region. \ne.  All residents on August 1, 2006, woul d be eligible for relocation \nassistance.  \nf.  Qualified resident homeowners would  be elig ible, in addition to th e \n$15,000.00 required by N.J.A.C. 5:11-3.7(a), for a $20,000 no-interest \nloan payable if and when the relo cated homeowner sold the replacement \ndwelling.  \ng.  Qualified tenants who m oved into non-subsidized rental units were \neligible for up to $4,000.00 in assist ance as provided by N.J.A.C. 5: 11-\n3.5 and additional assistance up to $3,500.00.  \nh.  However, homeowners or tenants who used relocation funds to move out \nthe Gardens would not be eligible for additional relocation funds to return \nto the  Gardens if  and when any af fordable un its were ultim ately \nconstructed. \n139.  In November 2006, the Township received  notification from the Department of \nCommunity Affairs that the Relocation Plan was approved.  \n140.  On Nove mber 15, 2006, Triad opened  an office in the  Gardens to conduct \nrelocation activities.  \n141.  Triad staff began to send letters and noti ces to tenant households asking them  to \ncome in for interviews.  \n \n26\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 27 of 55 PageID: 27\n142.  After assessing their housing needs, Triad  staff started to make efforts to locate \nhousing for these households outside of the Gardens.  \n143.   The Township did not provide any relo cation assistance to residents who m oved \nout of the Gardens prior to November 2006.  \n144.  Since the R elocation Plan was approved in N ovember, 2006 through January, \n2008, the Township paid relocation funds to 62 families to move out of the Gardens. \n145.  Of these 62 households, 43, or 69%, were relocated outside of Mt. Holly.  \n4.  Demolition of Units \n146.  The Township and Redevelopers have  and are continuing to dism antle the \nGardens community by demolishing homes in the Gardens.   \n147.  As of May 2008, the T ownship has dem olished a total of 73 residential units, \nmost of which were previously occupied by tenants or homeowners.    \n148.  Although the Township claimed that the demolitions of the houses were necessary \nfor health and safety concerns , the units were generally st ructurally sound, capable of \nrehabilitation, and did not pose a threat to public safety.  \n149.  To the extent the units were in poor condition and being used by trespassers, this \nwas a result of the Township’s failure to take measures to adequately secure and maintain them.  \n5.  Reduction in Municipal Services  \n150.  Starting in 2000, before the Township even  initiated the for mal redevelopment \nplanning process, the Township itself began to create blighted conditions in the Gardens.  \n151.  Starting in 2000 and continuing during the  course of the redevelopment process, \nthe Township neglected the needs of the Gardens neighborhood by failing to apply for and utilize \navailable funding for community improvements and housing rehabilitation.  \n \n27\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 28 of 55 PageID: 28\n152.  From January 1999 to the present, th e T ownship entered into regional  \ncontribution agreements pursuant to the New Je rsey Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52: 27D-301 et \nseq.,  with the municipalities of Moorestown, Hainesport, and Westhampton, with the Township \nreceiving more than $4  m illion to  rehabilita te 218 residential units  occupied b y low and \nmoderate income households within Mount Holly. \n153.  The Township has not at any tim e allocated or used any funds from  the regional \ncontribution agreements to rehabilitate homes in the Gardens.  \n154.  The Township failed to utilize a $25,000  grant from the New Jersey Departm ent \nof Community Affairs earmarked for social, educational, and recreational programs for residents \nat the Gardens community center and in July, 2003 was forced to return the unspent funds.  \n155.  In 2004, the Township rem oved the only playground equipm ent in the Gardens \nand refused to replace it.  \n156.  The Township also failed to  cond uct proper code enforcem ent, prompt trash \nremoval, adequate policing, and other basic services needed by the Gardens residents. \n157.  The Township twice u sed its v acant properties in the  Gardens to conduct live \npolice tactical training, bringing in numerous police officers and vehicles into the Gardens in the \nearly morning hours, without providing advance notice to residents in the neighborhood. \n158.  The Township’s failure to provide adequate and proper municipal services has \nnegatively impacted upon the community and decreased the quality of life for residents. \n159.  In spite of the Township’s actions, Garden s residents, through their own efforts, \ncontinued to combat significant deterioration of their neighborhood and tried to preserve their \nquality of life. \nF.  Continued Planning and Changes to WR Redevelopment Plan \n \n28\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 29 of 55 PageID: 29\n160.  On March 9, March 23, and April 5, 2006, th e Redevelopers held three meetings \nwith Gardens residents. \n161.  The residents participating in these m eetings thought that the purpose of the \nmeetings was to consider revisions to the redevelopment plan.  \n162.  At all three of the m eetings, Gard ens residents gave input about the \nredevelopment process and stated that they did not want to lose  their homes or to be moved out \nof the Gardens.  \n163.  The Gardens residen ts presented to the  Redevelopers a list of proposals for \nrevising the WR Redevelopm ent Plan, which included a g uarantee of affordable replacem ent \nunits for all residents to be displaced who wished to remain in the Gardens.  \n164.  At the third meeting, resident surveys were distributed.  \n165.  In July of 2006, Triad com pleted the resi dent survey process. 169 households \nresponded, including 107 tenant households and 60 homeowners.  \n166.  The Triad survey showed that 120 out of the 169 families were interested in either \npurchasing or renting a new home in the Gardens, only 64 families were interested in purchasing \nor renting outside of the Gardens, and only 8 households were interested in selling their property.  \n167.  In or about October 2006, the Township  and Redevelopers notified the residents \nof the completion of the Relocation Plan.   \n168.  The Relocation Plan stat ed that 560 units were being planned for the \nredevelopment area.  \n169.  The Township and Redevelopers have not  given residents any other infor mation \nabout any proposed or adopted changes, revisi ons, or amendments to the WR Re development \nPlan. \n \n29\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 30 of 55 PageID: 30\n170.  During the period between February  of 2006 and Se ptember 2007, the \nRedevelopers prepared and revised approximately eight conceptual plans for the redevelopm ent \narea, referred to by the Township as “concept plans”. \n171.  Since the adoption of the W R Redevelopment Plan, the Township Council has \nconducted many discussions during closed executive session.  \n172.  The Township did not provide any public  notice regarding the concept plans that \nwere being prepared by the Redevelopers.  \n173.  The Township did not conduct any public meetings regarding the concept plans.  \n174.  Upon information and belief, the Township did not refer any of the concept plans \nor any other proposed am endments to the W R Redevelopment Plan to the Planning Board for \nreview.  \n175.  On September 10, 2007, during a C ouncil meeting, Township Manager Hoffman \nadvised the Council and the public  that the Redevelopers should be coming to present a revised \nplan to Council in approxim ately two weeks and  that hopefully after the plan is approved the \nRedevelopers would be coming forth with funding to offset the 2008 budget.  \n176.  The Township Manger’s statement on September 10, 2007 was the only time that \nthat the Township discussed the Redevelopers’ concept plans during a Council meeting that was \nopen to the public. \n177.  The most recent concep t plan p roposes construction of 203 m arket rate and 25 \nCOAH income restricted apartm ents and 261  market rate and 31  COAH townhouses, totaling \n520 housing units.  \n178.  The Township Council scheduled an executive session to discuss and approve the \nconcept plan, without adopting a Re solution pursuant to the Open  Public Meeting Act, N.J.S.A. \n \n30\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 31 of 55 PageID: 31\n179.  On or about Septem ber 24, 2007, the To wnship Council approved the concept \nplan during a closed executive session.  \n180.  The Township Council approved the concept plan without any public notification \nabout the concept plan or any opportunity for public input. \n181.  The Township Council has not provided a ny information to the public about the \nactions taken during the executive session when  the Township discussed and approved the \nconcept plan. \n182.  The Township has n ot tak en a ny action to f ormally am end the W R \nRedevelopment Plan pursuant to the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7.  \n183.  The redevelopment project for the Gardens, as amended through the approval of \nthe concept plan, is inconsistent with the Township’s Master Plan and Reexamination.  \n184.  The Township has not followed the procedures set forth in the LRHL, N.J.S.A. \n40A:12A-7, for review and adoption of a redevelopment plan that is not consistent with the \nMaster Plan.  \nG.  Failure to Provide Affordable Replacement Units \n185.  The Township estimates that the prices  of the new townhouses to be bu ilt in the \nredevelopment area will range  from  $200,000 to 275,000  and that  apartm ents will rent at \napproximately $1.65 per square foot, with a one-bedroom unit renting for $1,230 per month.  \n186.  Nearly all Gardens residents cannot afford to purchase or rent the new units.  \n \n31\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 32 of 55 PageID: 32\n187.  The affordable housing provision in  the WR Redevelopment does not constitu te \nadequate replacement housing because it proposes to create only 23 affordable units, without any \nguarantee that even these 23 units would be realis tically affordable or available to  current o r \ndisplaced Gardens residents.  \n188.  The new concept plan approved by the Council on September 24, 2007, also does \nnot provide for adequate replacem ent housing because it proposes to replace the 32 9 Gardens \nhomes with only 56 affordable units, without a ny guarantee that even any of these 56 units \nwould be realistically affordable or available to Gardens residents. \nH.  Harm to Residents and CIA by Township’s and Redeveloper’s Actions  \n189.  By acquiring and vacating properties, faili ng to maintain the properties it owns, \nreducing municipal services, demolishing units, and creating increasingly blighted conditions in \nthe Gardens, the Township and Redevelopers have  interfered and are  continuing to sev erely \ninterfere with the Gardens residents’ use and enjoyment of their property and to otherwise injure \nGardens residents.  \n190.  Gardens residents risk losing their financ ial investments in their homes if  they \ncontinue to make improvements or repairs. \n191.  Because the Township’s and Redeveloper’s actions have created severely blighted \nconditions and greatly lowered  property values, and because of  the imm inent threat of \ncondemnation, Gardens residents ar e unable to sell their hom e on the private market at a price  \nthat provides just com pensation and that woul d enab le them  to find alternate com parable \nhousing.  \n \n32\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 33 of 55 PageID: 33\n192.  The Towns hip’s proposed prices for pur chase of the properties also do not \nconstitute just compensation and are inadequate to enable residents to purchase decent, safe, and \naffordable comparable replacement housing.  \n193.  Because of the Township-cau sed increas ed vacancy rate, pro liferation of \nabandoned home, and ugly appearance of the nei ghborhood, Gardens residents increasingly fear \nfor their security and safety, experience pest infestation and mold, cannot enjoy spending time in \ntheir yards and open areas, and are embarrassed to have family and friends visit.  \n194.  Gardens residents have experienced and are continuing to experience great stress, \nanxiety, and grief because of their fear of losing their homes and their strong community ties and \nbecoming unable to find adequate affordable replacement housing. \n195.  Many former Gardens residents have  moved out of the Gardens comm unity \nbecause the community had becom e such an un desirable and unsafe place to live and because \neventual eviction or condemnation by the Township appeared inevitable.  \n196.  Many former Gardens residents who m oved out of the Gardens under threat of \ncondemnation or eviction have not been able  to find com parable replacem ent housing at \nlocations as desirable as the Gard ens community and have been forced to live under worse \nconditions and/or pay higher housing costs.   \n197.  The Township’s and Redeveloper’s acti ons have harm ed CIA by impeding its \nability to organize residents and operate effectively as a representative organization.  \n198.  The Township’s and  Redevelo per’s con certed actio ns to effectuate the \nredevelopment of the Gardens between March of 2005 and the present, including the acquisition, \nvacation, an d demolition of properties,  the reloca tion of residen ts, the creation of severely  \nblighted living conditions, the failure to provide affordable replacement housing, and the injury \n \n33\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 34 of 55 PageID: 34\nsuffered by the Residents as a result of these acti ons render ripe for adjudication the civil rights \nand constitutional claims that were dismissed by the state court witho ut prejudice for lack of \nripeness.  \nFIRST COUNT \n \nUNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT,  \n42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \n \n199. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n200. By the actions described above, the Townsh ip and Redevelopers have violated and \ncontinue to violate the rights  of plaintiffs under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601  et seq. \nand implementing regulations by: \na.   Making unavailable or denying dwellings  to persons because of race, color and \nnational origin, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) and implementing regulations;  \nb.  Discriminating on the basis of race, co lor or national origin  in the term s, \nconditions or privileges of services or  facilities in connecti on with the sale or \nrental of a swelling  in violation  of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b) and im plementing \nregulations; and \nc.   Coercing, intimidating, threatening or interfering with any person's exercise of his \nor her rights protected under 42 U.S.C. § 3604, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3617.  \n201.  The Township’s and R edevelopers’ actions, practices and policies, as described \nabove in the Complaint, have had and continue to have a substantial adverse, disparate impact on \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households in vi olation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3604 (a) and (b). \n \n34\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 35 of 55 PageID: 35\na.  The Township’s and Redevelopers’ actions, practices and policies will dismantle and \ndestroy the Gardens, which is predominately African-American and Hispanic and has \nthe most concentrated populations of Afri can-American and Hispanic persons in the \nTownship. \nb.  The Township’s and Redevelopers’ actions, practices and policies will substantially \nand disproportionately displace African-American and Hispanic households from the \nGardens and from Mt. Holly Township, who are mostly lower and m oderate income \nand who cannot afford the hom es that will be constructed in the Gardens or existing \nhousing in the local housing market.   \nc.   The Township’s and Redeveloper s’ ac tions, practices  an d policies  will d estroy \nhundreds of residential hom es affordable to lower and modera te income African-\nAmerican and Hispanic Household s without providing replacem ent housing th at is \naffordable to most such households. \n202.  In addition, the Township’s a ctions demonstrate that Township of ficials acted \nwith intent to discriminate, as follows: \na.  The Township knew that the residents of  the Gardens were predom inately African-\nAmerican and Hispanic, and that the Gardens  comm unity was one of the m ost \nconcentrated populations of African-American and Hispanic persons in the Township. \nb.  The Township decided to abandon efforts to rehabilitate the Gardens and instead \ninitiate a redevelopm ent project that would  require the f orcible relocation of all o r \nmost Gardens residents.  \n \n35\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 36 of 55 PageID: 36\nc.  Even before adoption of a redevelopm ent plan, the Township took actions to create \nblighted conditions in the Gardens and to drive down the costs of property acquisition \nand relocation.  \nd.  The Township knew or should have known that the predominately African-American \nand Hispanic Gardens residents would be unable to afford t he proposed new housing \nto be constructed under the Redevelopment Plan. \ne.  The Township also knew or had reason to know that there was an inadequate supply \nof affordable housing in the area and especially within the Township.  \nf.   The Township knew or had reason to know  that Gardens residents would find few  \naffordable housing options within Mt. Ho lly Township and woul d be likely to be \nforced to move out to other municipalities. \ng.  The Towns hip knew or should have known that im plementation of the WR \nRedevelopment Plan would th erefore result in decreasing the num bers of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic residents in Mt. Holly.  \nh.  The Township knew or should have known th at the African-American and Hispanic \nresidents would experience severe hardship  from being forcibly relocated and would \nhave great difficulty in securing adequate replacement housing.  \ni.  The Township officials also knew or ha d reason to know that the redevelopm ent \nwould thus cause severe harm  to Gardens re sidents, as they would lose their hom es \nand their comm unity and have great difficu lty in finding decent, safe, affordable \nreplacement housing in Mt Holly Township and the surrounding region. \n \n36\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 37 of 55 PageID: 37\nj.  The Township officials adopted and began to implement the Gardens Redevelopment \nPlan and the WR Redevelopm ent Plan with  the intent to  displace cu rrent Gardens \nresidents and force a significant number of them to move out of Mt Holly.  \nk.  The Gardens community, which has the highe st concentration of African-American \nand Hispanic resid ents in the Township,  is the only community th e Township has \ntargeted for large-scale displacement and relocation. \nl.  The Towns hip deviated from  procedural  and substantive nor ms by violating the \nprocedures mandated by the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1  et seq., and the OPMA, \nN.J.S.A. 10:4-12, as described m ore fully under the  Seventh and Eighth Counts of \nthe Complaint. \nm. The Township deviated from procedural and substantive norms by adopting revisions \nto the WR Redevelopment Plan that are inconsistent with the policies and priorities of \nthe Township’s Master Plan.  \nn.  The Towns hip knowingly and deliberately created adverse and unsafe living \nconditions at the Gardens by failing to  provide adequate e ssential services, by \npurchasing properties and leaving them  in  vacant and deteriorated condition, by \ndemolishing structurally sound units that were capable of rehabilitation, by failing to \nobtain and expend funds for community  improvements, and by failing to support \ncommunity-led initiatives for improving housing and quality of life in the Gardens.  \no.  The Towns hip intentionally took action  to drive down property values and it s \nacquisition and relocation costs, improperly assessed the value of the properties, and \nfailed to  make availab le to  the p redominately African-Am erican a nd Hispanic \nGardens residents just compensation and adequate relocation assistance.  \n \n37\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 38 of 55 PageID: 38\np.  The Township’s prior history regarding its trea tment the Gardens and its adoption of     \nthe W R Redevelopm ent Plan despite know ledge of its discrim inatory effects \ndemonstrate that the Township intended to and did discriminate against plaintiffs on \nthe basis of race, color, and national origin. \nq.   The Township intentionally took action it knew or should have known would coerce, \nintimidate, threaten and interfere with re sidents' rights to rent, own, sell, buy and \notherwise exercise their  rights protected under the 42 U.S.C § 3604 by coercing \nresidents to sell their property to the Township, by leaving the properties it purchased \nvacant, po orly m aintained and attractiv e to vandalizers and trespassers, b y \ndemolishing units attached to units it kne w to be occupied by residents, thus \nfrightening the residents and structurally  damaging their units, by conducting live \npolice weapons and tactics team  trainings in  vacant units in view of residents and \ntheir children and by sending  residents notices of relocation interviews, that the y \nknew or should have known would be coer cive, intimidating, threatening and would \ninterfere with residents' rights. \n203. By the actions described above, the To wnship has intentionally, knowingly, and \ncontinuously discrim inated against African Am erican, Hispanic and other residents of the \nGardens neighborhood because of thei r race, color o r national orig in, or th e racial, co lor or \nnational origin composition of their neighborhood, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. \n204. The Township have intentionally, knowi ngly, and continuously engaged in the \npractices described above that have a predictable discriminatory effect with the intent of denying \nequal housing opportunities to Residents. \n \n38\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 39 of 55 PageID: 39\n205.  The actions of the Township and Re developers in adopting, revising, and \nimplementing the redevelopment plans for the Gardens have caused and are continuing to cause \nsevere harm to the low and m oderate income, predominately African-American and Hispanic \nGardens residents. \n206. The acts and conduct of the Township and Redevelopers complained of above have \ncaused and continue to cause substantial injury to each of the individual plaintiffs and to plaintiff \nCitizens in Action. \nSECOND COUNT \nVIOLATION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1866,  \n42 U.S.C. §1982 \n \n207. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n208. The Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1982,  guarantees that  “[a]ll \ncitizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed \nby white citizens thereo f to inherit,  purchase,  lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal \nproperty.” \n209. By seeking to dem olish all 329 hom es within the Gardens neighborhood and \nproposing to constru ct much  more expensive  replacement housing units unaffordable to m ost \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households living in the Gardens, the Township is intentionally \nseeking to deprive the plaintiffs and other Africa n-American and Hispanic residents of the same \nright to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property as is enjoyed by \nwhite citizens, in violation of to 42 U.S.C. § 1982. \n \n39\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 40 of 55 PageID: 40\n210. The Township has otherwise intentionally discriminated against Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of  the Gardens neighborhood as described under the \nFirst and Third Counts of this Complaint. \n211. The Township has thus violated plaintiffs rights guaranteed under 42 U.S.C. §1982.  \nTHIRD COUNT \nVIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF FOURTEENTH  \nAMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION ACTIONABLE \nPURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n212.

The Township has intentionally discrim inated against plaintiff Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of  the Gardens neighborhood as described under the \nFirst and Second Counts of this Complaint. \n214.  The Township has, under color of state law, intentionally deprived the Residents of \ntheir rights to equal protec tion under the law as guaranteed  to them  by the Fourteenth \nAmendment of the United States C onstitution because of their race, e thnicity and/or nation al \norigin, actionable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. \nFOURTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF NEW JERSEY LAW AGAINST DISCRIMINATION, \nN.J.S.A. 10:5-1 ET SEQ. \n       \n215. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n216. N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 of the New Jersey Law Agains t Discrimination states that “[i]t \nshall be unlawful discrim ination for a m unicipality, county or  other local civ il or political \nsubdivision of the State of New Jersey, or an officer, em ployee, or agent thereof, to exercise the \n \n40\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 41 of 55 PageID: 41\npower to regulate land use or housi ng in a manner that discriminates on the basis of race, creed, \ncolor, national origin, ancestry, marital status, familial status, sex, nationality or handicap” \n217. As set forth in Counts One through Three,  the Township has taken actions that are \ncausing and will contin ue to cause  the disp roportionate displacement and forced rem oval of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic ho useholds, that have reduced a nd will continue to reduce the \noverall number of African-Am erican and Hispan ic households living in Mt. Holly Township, \nthat discrim inate against African-A merican an d Hispanic households living in the Gardens \nneighborhood in the provision of services or facilities in connection with housing, that will create \nbarriers for African-American and Hispanic ho useholds to remain in and m ove into Mt. Holly \nTownship, and that thus have a discrim inatory impact upon the basis of race, co lor and national \norigin and perpetuate segregation within Mt. Holly Township in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5. \n218. In addition  to vio lating the New Jers ey Law Against Disc rimination due to \ndiscriminatory impact, the Township has inten tionally discriminated against plaintiffs and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households liv ing in the Gardens ne ighborhood contrary to \nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 as described under the Counts One through Three of this Complaint. \n219. In addition, as set forth previously herein, the Township and Redevelopers have \notherwise discriminated against African-American and Hispanic  households in the provision of  \nhousing in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 of the LAD.  \n220. The Township and R edevelopers have  thus unlawfully disc riminated against \nplaintiffs in violation of N.J.S.A. 10:5-4 and N.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5 of the New Jersey L aw Against \nDiscrimination. \nFIFTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE OF ARTICLE I,  \nPARAGRAPH 1 OF NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION \n \n41\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 42 of 55 PageID: 42\n \n221. Residents and CIA reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations in all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n222. The Township has intentionally discriminated against plaintiff Residents and other \nAfrican-American and Hispanic residents of the Gardens neighborhood by initiating and \nimplementing a redevelopment project that forcibly displaces these residents as described under \nthe First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Counts of this Complaint. \n223. The Township, under color of state law, has intentionally deprived the plaintiffs of \ntheir rights to equal protection of the law because of their race, ethnicity and/or national origin, \nin violation of Article I, Paragraph 1 of New Jersey Constitution. \nSIXTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF LOCAL REDEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING LAW,  \nN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 ET SEQ., BY SUBSTANTIAL AND MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE \nWR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN WITHOUT FORMAL REVISION OR AMENDMENT    \n \n224. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n225. The LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, provides th at no redevelopment project shall be \nundertaken or carried out except in accordance with a redevelopment plan adopted by ordinance \nof the municipal governing body. \n226. The LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-8, further provides that a municipality may proceed \nwith a redevelopment project upon the adoption of a redeve lopment plan pursuant to  N.J.S.A. \n40A:12A-7. \n227. The LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7(e), further requires that “Prior to the adoption of a \nredevelopment plan, or revision  or amendment thereto, the planning board shall transmit to the \ngoverning body, within 45 days after referral, a report containing its recommendation concerning \n \n42\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 43 of 55 PageID: 43\nthe redevelopment plan;” and it further requir es that “[T]he governing body, when considering \nthe adoption of a redevelopm ent plan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review the report \nof the planning board”.   \n228. The Council failed to refer to the Pl anning Board proposed am endments or  \nrevisions to the W R Redevelopment Plan and  the Township Planning Board did not conduct a \nreview of such proposed amendments or revisions.  \n229. The Council therefore did not review a re port of the Planning Board concerning \nsuch revisions or amendments.  \n230. The Council further failed to hold a pub lic hearing and to  adopt by ordinance \namendments to the WR Redevelopment Plan.  \n231. The Council violated the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, by approving significant and \nmaterial changes to the W R Redevelopment Plan in closed session without enactm ent of an \nordinance.   \n232. The Township and Redevelopers are pro ceeding to implement the new version of \nthe redeve lopment plan despite the Township’s  failure to am end t he redevelopm ent plan \npursuant to the LRHL.  \n233. The actions of the Township in making revisions to and proceeding to effectuate the \nRedevelopment Plan are arbitrary and capricious, unreasonable and ultra vires.  \nSEVENTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, BY MAKING DE FACTO REVISIONS TO \nREDEVELOPMENT PLAN RENDERING IT INCONSISTENT WITH TOWNSHIP \nMASTER PLAN  \n \n234. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n \n43\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 44 of 55 PageID: 44\n235. The LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, states: “All  provisions of the redevelopment plan \nshall be either substantially consistent with the municipal master plan or designed to effectuate \nthe master plan; but the m unicipal governing  body may adopt a redevelopm ent plan which is \ninconsistent with or not designed  to effectuate the master plan by affirmative vote of a majority \nof its full authorized membership with the r easons for so acting set forth in the redevelopm ent \nplan.” \n236. The LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, also provi des for a review by the planning board \nof consistency of a proposed redevelopment plan with the municipality’s master plan.  \n237. Upon information and belief, neither the Township Planning Board nor Township \nCouncil evaluated the consistency of the de fact o revisions to the W R Redevelopment Plan, as \nset forth in the Developer’s concept plan, for consistency with the master plan.  \n238. The de facto revisions that the Council in formally endorsed on or about September \n24, 2007, and has acted to im plement rendered the WR  Redevelopment Plan to be substantially \ninconsistent with the Township master plan and fails to effectuate the master plan. \n239. The Council violated the LRHL by failing to comply with the procedures mandated \nby  N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7(d) for adopting a redevelopm ent plan that is inconsistent with or not \ndesigned to effectuate a master plan. \nEIGHTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF THE OPEN PUBLIC MEETINGS ACT, N.J.S.A. 10:40-6 ET SEQ.,BY \nDE FACTO REVISION OF WR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN IN CLOSED SESSION \n \n240. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n241. The Open Public Meetings Act (“OPMA ”), N.J.S.A. 10:4-12, requires that “all \nmeetings of public bodies shall be open to the pub lic at all tim es,” with the exception that the \n \n44\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 45 of 55 PageID: 45\npublic body may exclude the public only from that portion of a meeting at which the public body \ndiscusses certain topics specifically enumerated in subsection b. of that section of the statute.  \n242. OPMA, N.J.S.A. 10:4-13, further provides that “[N]o public body shall exclude the \npublic from any meeting to discuss any matter described in subsection 7. b. until the public body \nshall first adopt a resolution, at a m eeting to which the public shall b e admitted: a. Stating th e \ngeneral nature of the su bject to be discussed; and b. Statin g as precisely as possib le, the time \nwhen and the circumstances under which the discussion conducted in closed session of the public \nbody can be disclosed to the public.” \n243. The Council violated the OPMA, N.J.S.A.  10:4-12 and N.J.S.A. 10:4-13, when it  \nfailed to adopt a proper resolution authorizing  a closed session, engaged in discussions with \nRedevelopers and approved a concept plan prepared by the Redevelopers in a closed session, and \nfailed to formalize such action in open session and to give public notification of its actions.  \nNINTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND FUNDAMENTAL \nFAIRNESS AS GUARANTEED BY ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPH 1 OF THE NEW \nJERSEY CONSTITUTION  \n \n244.  Residents and CIA reallege and incorpor ate by reference the allegations in all \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n245. The Township failed to provide individualized  notice to all owners of properties to \nbe acquired under the WR Redevelopm ent Plan and to otherwise meaningfully inform and give \nnotice to residents of the effects of redevelopment activities upon their constitutionally protected \nproperty rights. \n \n45\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 46 of 55 PageID: 46\n246. The Township conducted private m eetings with Redevelopers and other entities \nregarding the redevelopment initiative without giving notice to residents or an opportunity to be \nheard. \n247. The Township made revisions to the W R Redevelopment Plan without holding a \npublic m eeting as required by OPMA, N.J.S. A. 10:4-13, conducting a for mal process for  \namending a redevelopment plan as required by  the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7, and providing \nnotice to the public and an opportunity for residents to he heard with regard to the amendments.  \n248. The Towns hip has taken im proper actions to am end and im plement the \nredevelopment plan without adequate notice an d an opportunity to be  heard, significantly and \nsubstantially interfering with and infringing upon the property rights of Residents.   \n249. The Township’s failure to follow the LRHL’s form al plan amendment procedures, \nbefore tak ing dras tic im plementation actio ns destroying and dism antling the Gardens \nneighborhood,  is unjust and arbitrary governm ental action, resulting in th e unfair treatment of \nGardens residents, and inflicting upon them  oppression, harassment, and egregious deprivation  \ncausing unjustified harassment, anxiety, and expense. \n250. The Township’s actions violate due process and fundamental fairness under the \nArticle 1, Paragraph 1, of the New Jersey Constitution. \nTENTH COUNT \nVIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AS GUARANTEED BY \nTHE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \nACTIONABLE PURSUANT TO 42 U.S.C. §1983 \n \n251.

As set forth above in the Ninth Count of this Complaint, the Township has taken \nactions that infringe upon and deprive Residents of their property rights without meaningful and \nadequate notice and opportunity to be heard.  \n253. The Township, acting under color of state law, has deprived Residents of their \nrights secured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, actionable under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983. \nELEVENTH COUNT \nADOPTION, REVISION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REDEVELOPMENT \nPLAN IS ARBITRARY, CAPRICIOUS, AND UNREASONABLE  \n \n254. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n255. The actions of the Township in 1) adopt ing a redevelopm ent plan that fails to \nprovide for the housing needs of its residents, reduces the supply of affordable housing, forcibly \ndisplaces low and moderate income families; 2) revising the plan without following statutorily \nmandated procedures that provide for public  notice and input; and 3) acting in an  ultra vires \nmanner to ef fectuate this redev elopment plan as revised, while causing severe harm  to the \nresidents of the Gardens, are in contravention to  the plan’s own stated goals, in consistent with \nthe purposes of LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-2, and arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.  \nTWELTH COUNT \n \nVIOLATION OF THE GENERAL WELFARE UNDER ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPH 1  \nOF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION \n \n256. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n \n47\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 48 of 55 PageID: 48\n257.  The general welfare under Article I, Para graph 1 of the New Jersey Constitu tion \nrequires municipalities to regulate and use land to promote the public health, safety, and general \nwelfare of people of all incom es and econom ic status within the m unicipality, and therefore \nprohibits municipalities from using their redevelopment police powers in a manner that displaces \nand excludes existing lower-income residents from their community. \n258.  The WR Redevelopment Plan calls for re placing the 329 reside ntial units in the \nGardens with 228 residential units, of which only 10%—a total of 23—would be affordable \nhousing units, with the remaining 205 units to be market rate units.  \n259.  The Township is in the process of acquiring and dem olishing all of the existing \nhomes in the Gardens, although the houses were  structurally sound and the Township had not \ndemonstrated that they  constituted a substantia l threat to health and sa fety and could not be  \nrestored to standard condition within a reasonable time and at a reasonable expense. \n260.  Most of the households in  the Gardens are lower and m oderate income and will \nnot be able to afford the market rate units called for in the WR Plan \n261.  The Township has violated the general we lfare under Article I, Paragraph of the \nNew Jersey Constitution by adopting and implementing the WR Redevelopment Plan and failing \nto ensure that the regulation a nd use of land be m ade in such m anner as to prom ote the public \nhealth, safety, and general welfare of people of all incomes and economic status within Mt. Holly \nTownship; by destroying existing affordable hou sing and forcibly displacing low and m oderate \nincome residents; by failing to replace lost affordable housing; and by failing to act and legislate \nfor the general welfare of people throughout the  State of New Jersey, including the region \nwherein Mt. Holly Township lies. \n \n48\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 49 of 55 PageID: 49\n262.  The Township has further violated the general welfare by implementing the WR \nRedevelopment Plan in a m anner that has create d unsafe and increasingly blighted conditions, \ngreatly decreased quality of life, i nterfered with the residents’ use and enjoyment of their \nproperty, forced residents to m ove out of their community, and pr ovided them with inadequate \ncompensation and relocation ass istance to en able them  to secure com parable decent safe \nreplacement housing in the Township. \n263.  The Township’s proposed  de facto changes to the WR Redevelopment Plan, \nincreasing the total number of re sidential units to be built in the redevelopment area to 520, and \nproposing construction of only 56 COAH units, also violate the general welfare by proposing to \ndestroy existing housing affordable to low and  moderate income Gardens residents and to \nforcibly displace most low and moderate income Gardens families; and by failing to replace lost \naffordable housing and guarantee that any of the new units would be realis tically affordable or \navailable to Gardens residents .  \nTHIRTEENTH COUNT \nDENIAL OF JUST COMPENSATION UNDER 5TH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED \nSTATES CONSTITUTION ACTIONABLE PURSUANT TO  42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n \n264. Residents and CIA reallege  and incorporate by referenc e the allega tions in a ll \nprevious Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully pleaded herein.  \n265. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitu tion prohibits the taking of  \nprivate property without provision of just compensation.  \n266. The prices that the Township has p aid and is continuing to offer for purchases of \nproperty do not constitute just compensation.  \n267. In addition, within the  context of  redevelopment of lower incom e communities \nresulting in low and m oderate income homeowners being displaced, paym ent of fair m arket \n \n49\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 1   Filed 05/27/08   Page 50 of 55 PageID: 50\nvalue does not constitute just compensation where fair market value is less than the replacement \nvalue of housing within the local housing market.  \n268. As a result, the Township, acting under colo r of state law, is depriving homeowner \nResidents of just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  \nFOURTEENTH COUNT \nDENIAL OF JUST COMPENSATION UNDER ARTICLE 1, PARAGRAPH 20 OF THE \nNEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION  \n \n269.

Article I, Paragr aph 20 of  the New Je rsey Constitu tion provides th at priva te \nproperty may not be taken without just compensation.  \n271. Within the context of redevelopment of lower income communities resulting in low \nand moderate income homeowners being displ aced, payment of fair m arket value does not \nconstitute just com pensation where fair m arket value is less than th e replacement value of \nhousing within the local housing market. \n272.

DESANTIS\nBALLARD SPAHR ANDREWS & INGERSOLL LLP\nPLAZA 1000 - SUITE 500\nMAIN STREET\nVOORHEES, NJ 08043\nAttorney for Defendant Keating Urban Partners, L.L.C.\nHILLMAN, District Judge\nThis case involves the redevelopment of the Mount Holly\nGardens neighborhood (the “Gardens”) in Mount Holly, New Jersey. \nPlaintiffs are low-income, African-American, Hispanic and “white”\nresidents of the Gardens, who object to the plan because they\nclaim they are being forcibly removed from their homes, which are\nbeing replaced in large part with new, much higher-priced market\nrate homes. \nCurrently before this Court are defendants’ motions for\nsummary judgment, which had been converted from motions to\ndismiss on four of plaintiffs’ claims.1  The Court provided the\nplaintiffs with additional time to respond to the converted\nmotions, and then allowed defendants to file reply briefs.  The\nsupplemental briefing is completed, and the remaining claims that\n1 The other five counts were dismissed.  Since this case was\nfiled over two years ago, it has been extensively litigated with\nseveral hearings, the denial of a TRO and preliminary injunction,\nthe filing of a second amended complaint, and the issuance of\nnumerous written Opinions.  Litigation over the Gardens\nredevelopment also precedes this case in New Jersey state court. \nOverall, the concerns of several Gardens residents have caused\nthe dispute over the blighted neighborhood’s redevelopment plan\nto spend ten years in the courts.  \n2\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 3 of 28 PageID: 5068\nare now ready for final resolution are plaintiffs’ claims for\nviolations of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the\nFair Housing Act or FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (Count One\nagainst all defendants); the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1982 (Count Two against the Township); the Equal Protection\nClause of the U.S. Constitution, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 (Count Three against the Township); and Equal Protection\nClause of the New Jersey State Constitution (Count Five against\nthe Township), as well a claim for punitive damages.  \nAs this Court previously expressed on several occasions, we\nrecognize that the Gardens redevelopment has had an effect on\nlow-income families, and, correspondingly, minority families. \nThe Court also recognizes that being forced from one’s home is a\ndifficult and emotional issue, compounded by the fear of being\nunable to afford a comparable place to live.  However, as the\nCourt has also expressed previously, plaintiffs have failed to\ndemonstrate that the Township, or the entities assisting the\nTownship in the redevelopment and relocation services, has\nimplemented a plan that has a disparate impact on the Gardens\nresidents as the law defines it.  Nor have they shown that the\ndefendants have not been proceeding pursuant to a legitimate\ngovernmental interest in the least restrictive way, or have\notherwise acted with discriminatory intent.  Consequently, as\nexplained more fully below, defendants’ motions will be granted,\n3\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 4 of 28 PageID: 5069\nand the case will be closed.\nDISCUSSION2\nA. Standard for Summary Judgment\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the Court is satisfied\nthat “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330 (1986); Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c).  \nAn issue is “genuine” if it is supported by evidence such\nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict in the nonmoving\nparty’s favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n248 (1986).  A fact is “material” if, under the governing\nsubstantive law, a dispute about the fact might affect the\noutcome of the suit.  Id.  In considering a motion for summary\njudgment, a district court may not make credibility\ndeterminations or engage in any weighing of the evidence;\ninstead, the non-moving party's evidence “is to be believed and\nall justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.”  Marino\nv. Industrial Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir.\n2004)(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255).\n2 Because the background and procedural history have been\nlaid out in the Court’s previous Opinions, they will not be\nrestated here.\n4\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 5 of 28 PageID: 5070\nInitially, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Once the moving party has\nmet this burden, the nonmoving party must identify, by affidavits\nor otherwise, specific facts showing that there is a genuine\nissue for trial.  Id.  Thus, to withstand a properly supported\nmotion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must identify\nspecific facts and affirmative evidence that contradict those\noffered by the moving party.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57.  A\nparty opposing summary judgment must do more than just rest upon\nmere allegations, general denials, or vague statements.  Saldana\nv. Kmart Corp., 260 F.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir. 2001).\nB. Analysis\n1. Count One - Fair Housing Act\nThis Court has already analyzed plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act\nclaim substantively in the context of plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction.  That analysis was adopted in the Court’s\nmost recent Opinion, which converted defendants’ motions to\ndismiss into ones for summary judgment.  That analysis found that\nplaintiffs had not demonstrated that the redevelopment has had a\ndisparate impact on a protected group, or that defendants did not\nhave a legitimate interest in the redevelopment, or that no\nalternative course of action would have a lesser impact. \nRecognizing that plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act claim had only been\n5\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 6 of 28 PageID: 5071\nconsidered in the context of a preliminary injunction, the Court\nafforded plaintiffs time to gather specific facts to show a\ngenuine issue for trial on these issues.  The Court now affirms\nits prior decision on plaintiffs’ FHA claim because plaintiffs\nhave not provided the requisite proof to take the issues to a\njury.\nAs a preliminary matter, plaintiffs argue that they should\nbe afforded time for discovery, and are prejudiced in their\nability to oppose the converted motions because of the lack of\ndiscovery.  Plaintiffs contend that they require a look into the\ndefendants’ state of mind and intentions, as well as documents\nthat are only within the control of defendants and, thus,\nunavailable to plaintiffs.  Without this information, plaintiffs\nargue that summary judgment is premature, which is further\nevidenced by the fact that defendants have not even filed their\nanswers to plaintiffs’ complaint.\nAlthough the Court recognizes the peculiar procedural\nhistory that has led to the resolution of summary judgment\nmotions without the filing of answers or the undertaking of\nformal discovery, this is not a case where plaintiffs are\nneophytes filing an initial challenge to the Gardens\nredevelopment plan.  Not only has there been extensive\nproceedings over two years in this Court, most of these issues\nhave been thoroughly litigated in New Jersey state court over the\n6\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 7 of 28 PageID: 5072\ncourse of several years preceding this case.3  As pointed out by\ndefendants, plaintiffs have already had the ability to obtain the\ninformation they seek through Open Public Records Act requests,\nas well as through the previous state court litigation.  Further,\nmuch of the information is available by other means, including\nfrom the residents themselves or the Public Advocate, who\nundertook an investigation of the Township’s relocation\npractices.4 \nMoreover, plaintiffs do not specifically identify what\ninformation defendants hold to support their claims, and instead\nrequest discovery generally, such as depositions of key officials\nin order to acquire testimony as to their intent to “rid [the\nTownship] of a minority community.”  (Pomar Cert., Docket No.\n106-41) (“Residents are severely prejudiced by being unable to\nprobe, at a deposition, the attitudes, intent, and motives of the\nTownship officials who made the critical decisions to pursue the\nGardens redevelopment project.”).  Discovery, however, cannot\nserve as a fishing expedition through which plaintiffs search for\n3 The Court recognizes that the state court case was more\nnarrow than this one, and the civil rights claims had been\ndismissed as unripe, but none of the discovery plaintiffs contend \nthey need here to supplement the discovery from the state court\nlitigation would save their otherwise deficient claims.\n4 In the Court’s February 13, 2009 Opinion, the Court\nconsidered and referenced the Public Advocate’s report, which was\nprovided by plaintiffs pursuant to the Court’s November 25, 2008\nOrder granting plaintiffs’ request to supplement the record with\nthe report.\n7\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 8 of 28 PageID: 5073\nevidence to support conclusory speculations.  Giovanelli v. D.\nSimmons General Contracting, 2010 WL 988544, *5 (D.N.J. 2010). \nFurther, such depositions may be barred by a privilege afforded\nto decision-making government officials.  See, e.g., U.S. v.\nSensient Colors, Inc., 649 F. Supp. 2d 309, 316 (D.N.J. 2009).5   \n5 Indeed, in addressing the same argument by plaintiffs in\nthe earlier state court litigation, Judge Sweeney explained, \nThere are many reasons why discovery is the\nexception rather than the rule in actions\nsuch as this one.  First, a public official’s\nstate of mind is rarely an issue and can\nusually be determined from the record below. \nThere are transcripts, tapes, minutes and the\nlike.  Secondly, and no less important, is\nthe consideration that members of the\nmunicipal governing bodies and local boards\nserve without significant remuneration.  They\nwould be far less likely to serve if their\nofficial actions frequently subjected them to\nthe arduous discovery process. \nInterrogatories would have to be answered and\ndepositions attended after usual hours of\npublic service.  It would place a chilling\neffect on public service.  \nHere, I am convinced that the discovery\nsought would burden the officials involved to\na degree that would be totally\ndisproportionate to any usable information\nthat could be recovered.  Furthermore, there\nhas already been one hearing in this matter. \nAlthough I limited plaintiffs to two expert\nwitnesses, I also afforded them the right to\ncall township officials to testify.  They\nelected, for whatever reason, not to do so. \nFollowing that hearing, I determined that the\ndesignation of the Gardens as an area in need\nof redevelopment had substantial credible\nsupport in the record, was a designation made\nin accordance with statutory criteria, and I\nfound no evidence of racial or ethnic bias or\nanimus in the testimony of . . . the town\n8\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 9 of 28 PageID: 5074\n \nOverriding all these points with specific reference to\nplaintiffs’ FHA claim, however, is that in order to prove their\nclaim, none of the discovery plaintiffs claim they lack would\nsave their allegations, as plaintiffs must present their own\nproof of disparate impact and a more-viable alternative.  Stated\nseveral times before, Section 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act\nmakes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent after the making of\na bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or\nrental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to\nany person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial\nstatus, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (emphasis\nadded).  The FHA can be violated by either intentional\ndiscrimination or if a practice has a disparate impact on a\nprotected class.  Community Services, Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun.\nAuthority, 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005).  \nPlaintiffs here contend that the Gardens redevelopment plan\nhas a disparate impact on the minorities living in the Gardens. \nIn order to prove their claim, plaintiffs must first establish a\nprima facie case of disparate impact.  Resident Advisory Board v.\nRizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977).  To show disparate\nimpact, plaintiffs must show that the Township’s actions have had\nplanner.\n(August 30, 2005 Opinion, L-3027-03, at 6-7, Def. Ex. A, Docket\nNo. 84-3.)\n9\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 10 of 28 PageID: 5075\na greater adverse impact on the protected groups (here, African-\nAmericans and Hispanics) than on others.  Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v.\nZoning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp. of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442,\n466-67 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nIf a plaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the burden\nshifts to the defendant to demonstrate justification.  The\n“justification must serve, in theory and practice, a legitimate,\nbona fide interest of the Title VIII defendant, and the defendant\nmust show that no other alternative course of action could be\nadopted that would enable that interest to be served with less\ndiscriminatory impact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Finally, “[i]f\nthe defendant does introduce evidence that no such alternative\ncourse of action can be adopted, the burden will once again shift\nto the Plaintiff to demonstrate that other practices are\navailable.”  Id. at 149 n.37.  “If the Title VIII prima facie\ncase is not rebutted, a violation is proved.”  Id. at 149.\nThus, it is plaintiffs’ burden to show disparate impact, and\nif they do, it is their burden to rebut the Township’s position6\nand demonstrate a more-viable alternative course of action. \nPlaintiffs have done neither.  \nTo support disparate impact, plaintiffs argue that the\n6 In the October 23, 2009 Opinion, the Court found that the\nTownship had already met its burden based on the record before\nthe Court at that time.  As explained more fully herein,\nplaintiffs’ supplemental briefing does not demonstrate a material\nissue of fact regarding the Township’s legitimate interest and\nalternative choices.\n10\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 11 of 28 PageID: 5076\nredevelopment more negatively affects minorities in Mt. Holly\nthan non-minority residents because the redevelopment is driving\nout the minority population of Mt. Holly.  Plaintiffs also argue\nthat the redevelopment plan has a disparate impact on minorities\nbecause the plan is targeted at an area that is populated by\nmostly minorities.  To support their position, plaintiffs had\npreviously presented a report of a demographic and statistical\nexpert, Andrew A. Beveridge, Ph.D.  Dr. Beveridge opined that the\nredevelopment of the Gardens effectively and significantly\nreduces the minority population in Mt. Holly.  \nThe Court had rejected that proof.  The Court explained, \nEven though plaintiffs have pointed out that the\nredevelopment of the Gardens has reduced the minority\npopulation of Mt. Holly, they have not accounted for\nhow many minorities will move into the new housing. \nFurthermore, and more importantly for the plaintiffs’\nFHA claim of disparate impact, the redevelopment plan\ndoes not apply differently to minorities than non-\nminorities.  Several plaintiffs classify themselves as\n“white,” yet the plan affects them in the exact same\nway as their minority neighbors.  The real effect of\nthe Gardens redevelopment is that there will be less\nlower-income housing in Mt. Holly.  Although the\nTownship may have some obligation with regard to\nproviding a certain number of low-income housing\npursuant to other law, the reduction of low-income\nhousing is not a violation of the FHA.  The FHA\nprohibits the Township from making unavailable a\ndwelling to any person because of race--it does not\nspeak to income.  Redevelopment of blighted, low-income\nhousing is not, without more, a violation of the FHA. \nHere, where fourteen homes are occupied by African-\nAmerican plaintiffs, thirteen homes are occupied by\nHispanic plaintiffs, and six homes are occupied by\n“white” plaintiffs, and all are affected in the same\nway by the redevelopment, the Court cannot find, on the\ncurrent record at this preliminary injunction stage,\n11\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 12 of 28 PageID: 5077\nthat plaintiffs will succeed on their disparate impact\nFHA claim. \n(Feb. 13, 2009 Op. at 7-8.)\nIn their opposition to the converted motions, plaintiffs\npresent the same statistics, and further argue that there is\ndisparate impact on minorities because the displaced plaintiffs\nwill not be able to afford the new $200,000+ homes, or the $1,300\nto rent these same properties.7  As explained before, however, if\nnone of the plaintiffs can afford the new homes, it is not just\nthe African-American and Hispanic plaintiffs who are impacted by\nthe increased housing prices--it is all Gardens residents,\nincluding the Caucasian residents.8  Additionally, as also\nexplained before, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the\nTownship is preventing minorities from purchasing or moving into\nthe new homes, or otherwise limiting the new residents to non-\nminorities.  Plaintiffs have not provided any proof or statistics\nto suggest that the new homes created by the redevelopment will\nbe financially out-of-reach for all or most minorities.9     \n7 Although 464 units will be market rate, 56 will be deed-\nrestricted affordable housing units.\n8 Relatedly, plaintiffs argue that because a greater\npercentage of minority Township residents have been affected by\nthe redevelopment they have demonstrated a disparate impact. \nEven if this statistic was sufficient to establish a prima facie\ncase, plaintiffs’ FHA claim fails for reasons other than the\ndisparate impact analysis.  \n9Plaintiffs present statistics that only 21% of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic households in Burlington County would be\n12\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 13 of 28 PageID: 5078\nFurthermore, under plaintiffs’ logic, any action by the\nTownship to do anything with regard to the Gardens would result\nin a disparate impact, simply because of the racial composition\nof the Gardens.  The FHA (or any other civil rights law) does not\ncontemplate that a town will never be permitted to ameliorate a\nblighted area inhabited mainly by minorities simply because it\nwill affect minorities.  See, e.g., City of Memphis v. Greene,\n451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981) (“Because urban neighborhoods are so\nfrequently characterized by a common ethnic or racial heritage, a\nregulation's adverse impact on a particular neighborhood will\noften have a disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic or racial\ngroup.  To regard an inevitable consequence of that kind as a\nform of stigma so severe as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment\nable to afford the new houses, because that percentage of\nAfrican-American and Hispanic population earns above 80% of the\nmedian income ($44,580).  (Bev. Cert., Ex. B-2, Docket No. 106-\n4.)  This is in contrast to 79% of white Burlington County\nresidents who earn above 80% of the median income.  (Id.)  These\nstatistics hold little validity to show a disparate impact on the\nTownship’s minority population for several reasons: (1) they take\ninto account the entire population of Burlington County, rather\nthan only Mt. Holly Township, and the towns in Burlington County\nare of various economic and racial compositions; (2) they do not\naccount for minorities who will move into Mt. Holly Township from\noutside Burlington County; (3) they do not account for the deed\nrestricted units that will be more affordable; (4) they do not\naccount for a non-minority purchaser who rents to a minority; \n(5) they do not account for the minorities who will move\nelsewhere within Mt. Holly Township; and (6) more recent\npopulation survey data (from 2008, compared to the 2000 Census\ndata used by plaintiffs’ expert) shows 16,744 African-American\nand Hispanic households in Burlington County have incomes\nexceeding $45,000, evidence of the minority population’s ability\nto occupy all 464 market rate homes.\n13\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 14 of 28 PageID: 5079\nwould trivialize the great purpose of that charter of freedom.”). \nFinally, it is important to point out that none of the\nplaintiffs has been forced out of their homes by the Township\nwithout the offer of relocation services.  The FHA makes it\nunlawful to otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any\nperson because of race.  The Township has advised the residents\nnot to move until directed by the Township so that they will be\neligible for relocation assistance.  All plaintiffs, save for one\nwho was told to leave by her landlord, are still residing in the\nGardens.  Thus, on this basis alone, plaintiffs’ FHA claim fails.\nBut even if plaintiffs were able to establish their prima\nfacie case, they have not rebutted the Township’s legitimate\ninterest in the redevelopment, and they have not shown how an\nalternative course of action would have a lesser impact. \nPlaintiffs cannot refute that redevelopment of the community to\nremove blight conditions is a bona fide interest of the state, as\nexplained previously by this Court and by the New Jersey\nAppellate Division.  (See Feb. 13, 2009 Op. at 9, citing Wilson\nv. City of Long Branch, 142 A.2d 837, 842 (N.J. 1958) (“Community\nredevelopment is a modern facet of municipal government.  Soundly\nplanned redevelopment can make the difference between continued\nstagnation and decline and a resurgence of healthy growth.  It\nprovides the means of removing the decadent effect of slums and\nblight on neighboring property values, of opening up new areas\n14\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 15 of 28 PageID: 5080\nfor residence and industry.”); Citizens In Action v. Township Of\nMt. Holly, 2007 WL 1930457, *13 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. July\n5, 2007) (finding that “[t]he dilapidated, overcrowded, poorly\ndesigned community [the Gardens], in addition to the high level\nof crime in the area, is clearly detrimental to the safety,\nhealth, morals and welfare of the community”).)  It is clear that\nthe Township has a legitimate interest in the redevelopment of\nthe Gardens.\nWith regard to alternatives, plaintiffs have not identified\ndisputed issues of fact concerning whether the Township failed to\nshow “that no alternative course of action could be adopted that\nwould enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory\nimpact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  The adequacy of the\nredevelopment plan, as opposed the rehabilitation plan advocated\nby Plaintiffs, was extensively analyzed in New Jersey state\ncourt.  See Citizens In Action v. Township Of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL\n1930457, 14 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007) (finding that “the\nredevelopment designation is based on a record that provides\nsubstantial evidence in support of the determination”).10 \n10Even though that analysis was performed in the context of\nplaintiffs’ claims under New Jersey's Local Housing and\nRedevelopment Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 to -73 (LHRL), the issue of\nthe sufficiency of the 2005 redevelopment plan was extensively\nlitigated.  Thus, collateral estoppel principles may also apply. \nSee In re Graham, 973 F.2d 1089, 1097 (3d Cir. 1992) (citations\nomitted) (explaining that issue preclusion applies when “(1) the\nissue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the\nprior action; (2) that issue was actually litigated; (3) it was\ndetermined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the\n15\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 16 of 28 PageID: 5081\nPlaintiffs have not presented any plan more viable than the one\nimplemented by the Township.11  They advocate rehabilitation, but\nhave proposed a plan, as pointed out by defendants, that relies\nupon governmental subsidies and upon costs based on property\nconditions in 1989.  It also does not take into account\nrehabilitation costs to rehab owner-occupied homes, which is an\nadditional $2.5 million, and it does not account for temporary\ndetermination was essential to the prior judgment”).  The Court,\nhowever, refrains from considering this issue because plaintiffs’\nFHA claim, which also concerns the 2008 revised redevelopment\nplan, was not litigated in state court. \n11 The Township has shown that several organizations have\nattempted to rehabilitate the Gardens in the last 15 or so years. \nThese small scale efforts were ineffective in curing the overall\nblight of the community, which was a frustrating result for the\norganizations, the Township, and the residents.  (See Sept. 8,\n2003 Town Council meeting transcript at 25-26, 31-32, Def. Ex.\nB.).   Plaintiffs argue that it is not their burden to prove a\nbetter alternative.  Although it is true that the Township must\nshow the other alternatives they considered and rejected, and\nthat the alternative course of action could not “be adopted that\nwould enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory\nimpact,” once that showing is made, the ultimate burden “once\nagain shift[s] to the Plaintiff to demonstrate that other\npractices are available.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Thus,\nplaintiffs in this case have the obligation to show what\nalternatives would have better served the community.  Of course,\nthis analysis was intended to be performed after a finding of\ndisparate impact, which causes this “alternative course of\naction” analysis to make more sense in that context--that is, if\ndisparate impact is shown, the Township has the burden of showing\nit had no choice but to proceed in its chosen path despite the\ndisparate impact.  Here, where no disparate impact has been\nshown, this analysis devolves into plaintiffs’ personal\ndisagreement with the plan, and an argument as to what they\nbelieve to be the best course of action.  The fact that the\nTownship did not follow a plan sanctioned by the plaintiffs is\nnot the standard for a FHA claim.\n16\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 17 of 28 PageID: 5082\nrelocation costs.12  Simply because the properties could have\nbeen rehabilitated does not mean that rehabilitation was the\nfeasible option.13   \n12 Plaintiffs’ residential planning expert, Gary Smith, AIA,\nAICP, relates in his updated certification that the Township is\nviolating several building codes in its demolition process.  The\nlegality of how the Township is currently proceeding under its\nredevelopment plan is not before the Court.   Mr. Smith also\nopines that the redevelopment plan should be halted, and\nredirected to save the existing housing stock for rehabilitation. \nAs the Court commented before, however, “[e]ffectively,\nplaintiffs are seeking to remain living in the blighted and\nunsafe conditions until they are awarded money damages for their\nclaims and sufficient compensation to secure housing in the local\nhousing market.  Although couched at times like an effort to have\nthe development go up around them, like a highway built around a\nprotected tree, or to have their units rehabilitated, this makes\nlittle if no practical sense after years of litigation, approved\nredevelopment plans, and the expenditure of significant public\nresources.  At this late stage, the only real practical remedy is\nfor plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their home as well\nas proper and non-discriminatory relocation procedures and\nbenefits. . . . The relief they are seeking is inconsistent with\nproving the fourth element of their FHA claim--namely, that an\nalternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is\nviable.”  (Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 10-11.)\n13 The state appellate court commented, \nPhotographic evidence reveals areas within\nthe Gardens that are dilapidated.\nAdditionally, there was testimony that there\nwas overcrowding and excessive land coverage\nbecause of the way the units were arranged in\nblocks in fee simple ownership. Accordingly,\na dilapidated home on one lot had a serious\neffect on homes on either side of it.\nExcessive land coverage was also evident\nwhere a majority of the rear yards were paved\nor covered with gravel to accommodate\nadditional parking spaces. Finally, the\nalleyways created a faulty arrangement or\ndesign for the Gardens because it increased\nthe amount of crime in the area. The\ndilapidated, overcrowded, poorly designed\n17\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 18 of 28 PageID: 5083\nIn short, Plaintiffs have failed to show an impermissible\ndisparate impact.  Even if they have made such a showing, they\nhave failed to offer sufficient evidence to rebut the Township’s\nlegitimate governmental purpose or demonstrate illegitimate\ndiscriminatory intent.  Therefore, plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated that material disputed facts exist as to their FHA\nclaim.  Accordingly, summary judgment must be entered in favor of\ndefendants on this claim.14\n2. Counts Two, Three, Five - Civil Rights Act and State\nand Federal Equal Protection Clause\nPlaintiffs claim that the Township violated the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982, the Equal Protection Clause of the\nU.S. Constitution, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the New Jersey State Constitution.

App. Div. 2007).\n14 Plaintiffs’ FHA claim was lodged against all defendants,\nincluding the construction company selected to undertake the\nredevelopment, Keating Urban Partners, LLC, and the company hired\nby Keating to conduct the relocation activities, Triad\nAssociates, Inc.  In their previous motion to dismiss, Triad\nargued, and Keating joined in that argument, that it cannot be\nheld liable under the FHA because it had no part in the drafting\nand adoption of the Township’s redevelopment plan, and its\nactions with regard to the relocation activities do not fall\nwithin the province of the FHA-protected conduct.  Because the\nCourt has found no FHA violation, Triad’s argument will not be\nconsidered.\n18\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 19 of 28 PageID: 5084\norder to prove such claims, plaintiffs must show that they were\nthe target of intentional, purposeful discrimination by the\nTownship.  City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio v. Buckeye Community Hope\nFoundation, 538 U.S. 188, 194 (2003) (citation omitted) (“‘Proof\nof racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required’ to show\na violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”); Bradley v. U.S.,\n299 F.3d 197, 205 (3d Cir. 2002) (stating that in order to\nestablish a claim under the Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff\nneeds to prove that the actions (1) had a discriminatory effect\nand (2) were motivated by a discriminatory purpose); Brown v.\nPhilip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001) (citations\nand quotations omitted) (“In order to bring an action under §\n1982, a plaintiff must allege with specificity facts sufficient\nto show or raise a plausible inference of (1) the defendant's\nracial animus; (2) intentional discrimination; and (3) that the\ndefendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of race.”);\nGreenberg v. Kimmelman, 494 A.2d 294, 308 (N.J. 1985) (stating\nthat if a law is facially neutral, “an equal protection claim\ncould succeed only if the statute had an invidious purpose”). \nPlaintiffs claim that through the redevelopment plan the\nTownship is intentionally seeking to deprive plaintiffs and other\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics of the right to property and\nequal protection under the law.  In the Court’s prior Opinion\ndenying plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction, the Court\n19\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 20 of 28 PageID: 5085\nfound that plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the Township\n“implemented the development plan to intentionally or effectively\ndrive out the minority population of Mt. Holly.”  (Feb. 9, 2009\nOp. at 7.)  Thus, as with their FHA claim, the Township’s motion\nto dismiss these claims was converted to one for summary\njudgment, and the Court afforded plaintiffs the opportunity to\nprovide other proof to support their claims of intentional\ndiscrimination.\nIn their response, plaintiffs have failed to provide such\nproof.  As discussed above, plaintiffs first argue that summary\njudgment is premature, because their ability to prove these\nintentional discrimination claims is thwarted by the lack of\ndiscovery--namely, the depositions of Township officials.  As\nalso discussed above, however, even if such depositions were\npermitted, the Court doubts that any Township official will\ntestify to his or her “discriminatory purpose” in approving the\nredevelopment plan.  See, e.g., Smith v. Town of Clarkton, N.C., \n682 F.2d 1055, 1064-65 (4th Cir. 1982) (in an FHA case, stating,\n“Municipal officials acting in their official capacities seldom,\nif ever, announce on the record that they are pursuing a\nparticular course of action because of their desire to\ndiscriminate against a racial minority.  Even individuals acting\nfrom invidious motivations realize the unattractiveness of their\nprejudices when faced with their perpetuation in the public\n20\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 21 of 28 PageID: 5086\nrecord.  It is only in private conversation, with individuals\nassumed to share their bigotry, that open statements of\ndiscrimination are made, so it is rare that these statements can\nbe captured for purposes of proving racial discrimination in a\ncase such as this.”).\nWith regard to other methods for proving discriminatory\nintent, plaintiffs have had years to gather such proof, including\nobtaining affidavits from Gardens residents or other people who\nhave been involved in the Gardens redevelopment process. \nInstead, plaintiffs’ brief details the Township’s alleged\ndiscriminatory actions, but none of the claims are supported by\nany documentary or other evidence.15  Rather, plaintiffs tell a\n15 Several affidavits by plaintiffs were submitted in support\nof their motion for preliminary injunction.  In their brief,\nplaintiffs specifically refer to one of them by Santos Cruz to\nsupport the claim that the Township’s redevelopment activities\nlowered the property values of the remaining homes, and the\nTownship took advantage of that situation by pressuring residents\nto sell their homes at deflated prices that did not represent\nfair market value.  (Pl. Opp. at 31.)  This conclusion is based\non Mr. Cruz’s “belief.”  (Cruz Cert., Docket No. 17-9 (“I believe\nthe houses are worth much more than the Township is offering.”) \nThe other affidavits by plaintiffs in the record contain similar\nstatements as to their “beliefs” and “feelings.”  See Ancho\nCert., Docket No. 17-7, ¶ 18, “I believe that my home is worth\nmuch more than that [$39,000 to $42,000 offered to others]\nbecause we invested a great amount of money to make it\ncomfortable for our retirement”); Simons Cert., Docket No. 17-10,\n¶ 14, “I believe my house is worth a great deal more than what\nthe Township is offering me,” because it has three bedrooms, a\nlarge lot, and it has undergone “costly upgrades.”) These\naffidavits are insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. \nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 332 (“[C]onclusory, self-serving affidavits\nare insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\nInstead, the affiant must set forth specific facts that reveal a\ngenuine issue of material fact.”). \n21\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 22 of 28 PageID: 5087\nstory, long on accusations and suppositions but short on proof,\nof the Township’s ten-year, insidious desire to displace the\nminority population of Mt. Holly.  If there were merit to these\nclaims, plaintiffs would be able to annotate their allegations\nwith factual evidence that would infer such discriminatory\nmotive.16  They have not done so.  See Village of Arlington\nHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n266-67 (1977) (explaining that the determination as to “whether\ninvidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands\na sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence\nof intent as may be available,” and identifying objective factors\nthat may be probative of racially discriminatory intent: (1) the\nracial impact of an official action; (2) the historical\nIncidentally, these affidavits relate the plaintiffs’\nextensive participation in numerous meetings with the Township\nand the builders over the years.\n16 For example, plaintiffs state that “the Township failed to\nprovide adequate compensation and relocation assistance to enable\nresidents to purchase a replacement house in the Township or\nsurrounding region.”  (Pl. Opp. at 38.)  In the Court’s prior\nOpinion, however, the Court noted, “The evidence on the record\nshows that other Garden residents whose homes have been acquired\nby the Township and have been relocated are pleased with both\ntheir compensation and place of relocation.  In fact, the\nevidence demonstrates that many residents now have significantly\nimproved living conditions and are in better circumstances\nfinancially.  Additionally, the defendants represent, and\nplaintiffs do not dispute, that none of the people who have been\nrelocated and wanted to remain in Mt. Holly were unable to.” \n(Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 12 n.5.) Moreover, it is an undisputed fact\nthat New Jersey statute only requires the Township to pay $4,000\nin relocation benefits to tenants, and $15,000 in relocation\nbenefits to homeowners, but the Township has paid $7,500 to\ntenants and $35,000 to homeowners.  (See Def. Statement of Facts,\n¶ 23, at 31.)\n22\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 23 of 28 PageID: 5088\nbackground of the decision; (3) the sequence of events leading up\nto the challenged decision, including departures from normal\nprocedures and usual substantive norms; and (4) the legislative\nor administrative history of the decision).  \nIn contrast, the Township provides transcripts of town\ncouncil and planning board meetings, where concerned citizens and\ncouncil members discussed the plans for the Gardens.  The\nTownship has also provided letters and affidavits from former\nGardens residents, as well as certifications from individuals\ninvolved with the redevelopment plan implementation and\nrelocation process.  These documents range in date from 2002\nthrough early 2010.  The documents show that from the very\nbeginning, the planning board was aware of the sensitive issues\nthat would arise as they undertook the process, the desire to\nhave direct communication with Gardens’ residents, and the\nTownship’s consideration of the residents’ concerns.  (See, e.g.,\nSept. 8, 2003 Town Council meeting transcript at 36-44, Def Ex.\nB.)  Although many viewpoints were expressed by the Gardens’\nresidents and community activists, with some being supportive and\nhopeful, while other disenfranchised residents speaking\nemphatically and eloquently on their negative opinion on the\nredevelopment plan, their input was welcomed and encouraged.17\n17 Plaintiffs refer to the Township’s “secret,” off-the-\nrecord meetings among Township officials and the redevelopers\nwhere decisions were made without input from the community, and\nwhere they presume the true discriminatory intent of the Township\n23\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 24 of 28 PageID: 5089\nFurthermore, nowhere in plaintiffs’ recitation of the\nTownship’s motives do plaintiffs specifically acknowledge the\nextensive deterioration, crime, and overall unsafe living\nconditions the Township was endeavoring to cure.  Although\nplaintiffs feel that the Township simply wishes to remove all\nminorities from the town, evidence in the record supports an\nopposing viewpoint--that but-for the significant concern for the\nGardens’ resident’s welfare, and the desire to make the Township\nas a whole a safe and pleasant town for all of its citizens,\nminority and non-minority, the Township would have never\nundertaken the long-overdue project, particularly considering the\nchallenges that the redevelopment would, and did, inspire.18 \nAdditionally, as noted above and previously, evidence in the\nrecord shows that many relocated residents have been pleased with\nwas revealed.  Although “New Jersey has a strong, expressed\npublic policy in favor of open government, as evidenced by our\nOpen Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 to -21,” Times of\nTrenton Pub. Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Community Development Corp.,\n874 A.2d 1064, 1070 (N.J. 2005) (citation omitted), the OPMA sets\nforth specific instances where closed-door sessions are\nappropriate, see N.J.S.A. 10:4-12, -13.  It is unclear whether\nthese alleged “secret” meetings met the requirements of New\nJersey’s OPMA.  The Township’s compliance with OPMA is not before\nthe Court, however, and plaintiffs’ allegations concerning these\nmeetings as evidence of discriminatory intent are speculative,\nand, therefore, of insufficient weight to defeat summary\njudgment.\n18 It seems that plaintiffs could not dispute the ironic\nobservation that if the Township had allowed the Gardens to\ncontinue to deteriorate as it had over the years, that it might\nthen be fairly characterized as having a discriminatory intent\ntoward its minority, low-income residents.\n24\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 25 of 28 PageID: 5090\nthe process, and are now in a much better place as a result.  \nIt also cannot be forgotten that the redevelopment plan has\ngone through three machinations, from the Gardens Area\nRedevelopment Plan (“GARP”) in 2003, to the West\nRancocas Redevelopment Plan (“WRRP”) in 2005, and then to the\nRevised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan in September 2008.  For\neach of these plans, the Township Council and the builder heard\nextensive public comment, testimony, and written objections (as\nintricately detailed in plaintiffs’ complaint), and even though\nthe 2005 WRRP was approved by the New Jersey Department of\nCommunity Affairs and affirmed by the New Jersey state trial and\nappellate courts, the Township and redevelopers conducted a\nreevaluation of the plan which resulted in the 2008 Revised WRRP. \nDespite plaintiffs’ claims that all the plans were adopted\nwithout meaningful consideration of the residents’ objections, it\nseems specious to believe that the Township extensively\nreevaluated and revised its plans while entertaining numerous\nopportunities for public comment and objection simply as a ruse\nto mask its ultimate purpose of “ridding” Mt. Holly of its\nminority population.\nThe Court acknowledges that for every governmental action,\npeople will object, for personal reasons, or as a champion for\nthose who cannot speak out for themselves.  The Court also\nacknowledges that governing officials are often not the most\n25\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 26 of 28 PageID: 5091\nefficient or pragmatic in their decision-making process.  When\npeople’s homes are at stake, and when issues concerning race and\neconomic status are involved, the emotions of everyone are\namplified.  This is evidenced not only by the 10-year litigation\nconcerning the Gardens’ redevelopment, but by the voices of the\nresidents who have expressed the extremes of satisfaction and\ndispleasure with the plan.  In addition to the people who feel\nbenefitted by the Township, it is undisputable that people have\nfelt unjustifiably wronged by the Township, which has had to make\nsome hard decisions along the way.   \nThe Court, however, must view the case under the legal\nframework that constrains this Court’s consideration of these\nissues, rather than under the emotional contours of the\nsituation.  At this summary judgment stage in the context of what\nproof has been provided, and in deciding what material issues of\nfact need to be resolved, the weight of the record evidence\ndemonstrates that no reasonable juror could find that the\nTownship acted with intentional discrimination in the development\nand implementation of the Gardens’ redevelopment plan.  Moreover,\nno additional discovery appears calculated or even remotely\nlikely to provide the missing proofs.  Consequently, summary\njudgment must be entered in favor of the Township on plaintiffs’\nintentional discrimination claims.\n \n26\n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 114    Filed 01/03/11   Page 27 of 28 PageID: 5092\n3. Punitive damage claims\nPlaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages for all of\ntheir claims.  The Township had moved to dismiss plaintiffs’\nrequest for punitive damages, arguing that under various legal\nprinciples, punitive damages cannot be imposed against a\nmunicipality.  In the Court’s previous Opinion, all of\nplaintiffs’ punitive damages requests were dismissed, except for\nthose relating to plaintiffs’ FHA and Civil Rights Act claims\n(Counts One and Two).  The Court reserved decision on these two\nclaims pending consideration of the converted motions.\nEven though “punitive damages can be awarded in a civil\nrights case where a jury finds a constitutional violation, even\nwhen the jury has not awarded compensatory or nominal damages,”\nAlexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing\nCurtis v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189 (1974)) (both discussing FHA\nclaims), a finding of a violation is a mandatory prerequisite to\nany possibility of punitive damages.  Because the Court has not\nfound defendants to be liable for plaintiffs’ FHA and civil\nrights claims, plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims fail as\nwell.19 \n19For punitive damages, plaintiffs would also need to prove\nthat defendants’ “‘conduct is shown to be motivated by evil\nmotive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous\nindifference to the federally protected rights of others.’”\nAlexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting\nSmith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)).

In so moving, plaintiffs rely\nsolely on their claim that defendants violated the Fair Housing\nAct, Title VIII, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  For the\nreasons expressed below and at oral argument, plaintiffs’ motion\nwill be denied.\nBACKGROUND\nSince the filing of plaintiffs’ complaint, this case has\ninvolved several hearings, the filing of numerous motions and a\nsecond amended complaint, and the issuance of two Opinions.  At\nissue is the redevelopment of the Mount Holly Gardens\nneighborhood (the “Gardens”) in Mount Holly, New Jersey. \nPlaintiffs are low-income, African-American, Hispanic and\n“white,” residents of the Gardens, who object to the plan because\nthey are being forcibly removed from their homes, which are being\nreplaced with new, much higher-priced market rate homes. \nPlaintiffs contend that the redevelopment plan is violative of\nseveral laws, but they are currently seeking a preliminary\ninjunction to stop the redevelopment based on the defendants’\n2\n\nalleged violation of the Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1968 (the Fair Housing Act or FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nThey argue that the redevelopment plan has a disparate impact on\nthe African-American and Hispanic residents, and they are facing\nirreparable harm from the threat of losing their homes and their\ncommunity ties, being inadequately compensated for their\nproperties, and being unable to obtain affordable and decent\nreplacement housing.  \nDefendants counter that they did not violate the FHA because\nthere is no intentional discrimination or disparate impact on the\nGarden residents, and even if there were, the defendants are\nproceeding pursuant to a bona fide governmental interest in the\nleast restrictive way.  Therefore, defendants argue that\nplaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction.1 \nDISCUSSION\nIn Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 129 S.\nCt. 365, 377 (2008), the Supreme Court recently reiterated that a\n“preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded\nas of right,” and directed lower courts that “in each case,\ncourts must balance the competing claims of injury and must\nconsider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding\n1Defendants have also moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ FHA\nclaim.  Because the standard for reviewing a motion for\npreliminary injunction is different from a motion to dismiss\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the Court will not address defendants’\nmotion to dismiss at this time.\n3\n\nof the requested relief.”  Winter, 129 S. Ct. at 377.  It is\nbased on these principles that this Court assesses plaintiffs’\nrequest for an injunction to enjoin defendants from continuing\nwith their redevelopment plan.\nIn order to obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff\nmust establish that (1) he is likely to succeed on the merits,\n(2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of\npreliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in his\nfavor, and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Id. \nWith regard to the first two elements, the Supreme Court has\ninstructed that “issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a\npossibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our\ncharacterization of injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy\nthat may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff\nis entitled to such relief.”  Id. at 375-76 (citation omitted). \nWith regard to the second two elements, the Supreme Court has\nemphasized that in “exercising their sound discretion, courts of\nequity should pay particular regard for the public consequences\nin employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction.”  Id. at\n376-77.\nIn this case, plaintiffs have not demonstrated, at this\nstage in the proceedings, that they have pleaded a successful\nFair Housing Act claim, they have not shown that they will suffer\nan irreparable injury, and they have not demonstrated that an\n4\n\ninjunction is in the best interest of the public or that the\nequities tip in their favor.\nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nSection 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to\n“refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or\nto refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise\nmake unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of\nrace, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (emphasis added).\nThe FHA can be violated by either intentional discrimination\nor if a practice has a disparate impact on a protected class.\nCommunity Services, Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun. Authority, 421 F.3d\n170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005).  Plaintiffs here contend that the\nGardens redevelopment plan has a disparate impact on the\nminorities living in the Gardens.  In order to prove their claim,\nplaintiffs must first establish a prima facie case of disparate\nimpact.  Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d\nCir. 1977).  To show disparate impact, plaintiffs must show that\nthe Township’s actions have had a greater adverse impact on the\nprotected groups (here, African-Americans and Hispanics) than on\nothers.  Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp.\nof Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir. 2002).  If a\nplaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the burden shifts to\nthe defendant to demonstrate justification.  The “justification\n5\n\nmust serve, in theory and practice, a legitimate, bona fide\ninterest of the Title VIII defendant, and the defendant must show\nthat no other alternative course of action could be adopted that\nwould enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory\nimpact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Finally, “[i]f the defendant\ndoes introduce evidence that no such alternative course of action\ncan be adopted, the burden will once again shift to the Plaintiff\nto demonstrate that other practices are available.”  Id. at 149\nn.37.  “If the Title VIII prima facie case is not rebutted, a\nviolation is proved.”  Id. at 149.\nHere, for the purposes of their motion for preliminary\ninjunction, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they will\nlikely succeed with their FHA claim because they have not\ndemonstrated that they can make their prima facie case. \nPlaintiffs argue that the redevelopment plan has a disparate\nimpact on minorities in two ways.  First, plaintiffs argue that\nthe redevelopment more negatively affects minorities in Mt. Holly\nthan non-minority residents because the redevelopment is driving\nout the minority population of Mt. Holly.  To support their\nposition, plaintiffs present a report of a demographic and\nstatistical expert, Andrew A. Beveridge, Ph.D., who states that\nas of 2000, seventy-five percent of the people living in the\nGardens were minority residents.  Dr. Beveridge states that the\nGardens contains a highly concentrated minority population, more\n6\n\nthan any other area of Mt. Holly.  Consequently, Dr. Beveridge\nopines that the redevelopment of the Gardens effectively and\nsignificantly reduces the minority population in Mt. Holly. \nPlaintiffs contend that this violates the FHA.\nSecond, plaintiffs argue that the redevelopment plan has a\ndisparate impact on minorities because the plan is targeted at an\narea that is populated by mostly minorities.  Plaintiffs live in\nthe Gardens because for families with limited income, the Gardens\nrepresented an attractive affordable housing opportunity. \nDemolishing the Gardens and replacing the current housing with\nhigher-priced homes, and only a few low-income units, effectively\ncauses the targeted reduction of Mt. Holly’s minority population. \nThis, too, plaintiffs argue is a violation of the FHA.\nThe statistical repercussions of redevelopment do not\nprovide evidence that the Township implemented the plan to\nintentionally or effectively drive out the minority population of\nMt. Holly.  Indeed, even though plaintiffs have pointed out that\nthe redevelopment of the Gardens has reduced the minority\npopulation of Mt. Holly, they have not accounted for how many\nminorities will move into the new housing.  Furthermore, and more\nimportantly for the plaintiffs’ FHA claim of disparate impact,\nthe redevelopment plan does not apply differently to minorities\nthan non-minorities.  Several plaintiffs classify themselves as\n“white,” yet the plan affects them in the exact same way as their\n7\n\nminority neighbors.    \nThe real effect of the Gardens redevelopment is that there\nwill be less lower-income housing in Mt. Holly.  Although the\nTownship may have some obligation with regard to providing a\ncertain number of low-income housing pursuant to other law, the\nreduction of low-income housing is not a violation of the FHA. \nThe FHA prohibits the Township from making unavailable a dwelling\nto any person because of race--it does not speak to income. \nRedevelopment of blighted, low-income housing is not, without\nmore, a violation of the FHA.  Here, where fourteen homes are\noccupied by African-American plaintiffs, thirteen homes are\noccupied by Hispanic plaintiffs, and six homes are occupied by\n“white” plaintiffs, and all are affected in the same way by the\nredevelopment, the Court cannot find, on the current record at\nthis preliminary injunction stage, that plaintiffs will succeed\non their disparate impact FHA claim.       \nEven if plaintiffs were able to establish their prima facie\ncase, they have not rebutted the Township’s legitimate interest\nin the redevelopment, and they have not shown how an alternative\ncourse of action would have a lesser impact.  These points also\nspeak to the three other elements plaintiffs must prove for a\npreliminary injunction--irreparable harm, public interest and\nequities--and these elements are discussed in depth below.  For\nthe purposes of establishing an FHA claim, however, it is\n8\n\nimportant to note that redevelopment of the community to remove\nblight conditions is a bona fide interest of the State.  In 1958,\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court commented, “Community redevelopment\nis a modern facet of municipal government.  Soundly planned\nredevelopment can make the difference between continued\nstagnation and decline and a resurgence of healthy growth.  It\nprovides the means of removing the decadent effect of slums and\nblight on neighboring property values, of opening up new areas\nfor residence and industry.”  Wilson v. City of Long Branch, 142\nA.2d 837, 842 (N.J. 1958).  More specifically with regard to the\nGardens redevelopment, the New Jersey Appellate Division found\nthat “[t]he dilapidated, overcrowded, poorly designed community,\nin addition to the high level of crime in the area, is clearly\ndetrimental to the safety, health, morals and welfare of the\ncommunity.”  Citizens In Action v. Township Of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL\n1930457, 13 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. July 5, 2007).  It is\nclear that the Township has a legitimate interest in the\nredevelopment of the Gardens.\nB. Irreparable Harm, Public Interest & Balance of Equities\nPlaintiffs have also failed, at this preliminary injunction\nstage, to demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm, or\nthat it would be in the public’s best interest to halt the\nredevelopment of the Gardens.  To date, the majority of the\nGardens has been vacated, with these vacated homes either being\n9\n\nboarded up or demolished.  Plaintiffs are still living in the\nGardens, but they claim that the demolition and vacancies have\ncreated even more blight and unsafe living conditions.  Both\nsides agree that the vacant homes have created fire hazards,\ncrime, squatters, graffiti, roaches and mold.  They request,\nhowever, that the Court enjoin the Township from acquiring the\nremaining occupied homes through eminent domain, forcibly\nevicting tenants and homeowners, and otherwise pressuring\nresidents to move out.2  Plaintiff contend that this relief is\nnecessary to maintain the status quo while their claims are being\nlitigated against the Township.\nEffectively, plaintiffs are seeking to remain living in the\nblighted and unsafe conditions until they are awarded money\ndamages for their claims and sufficient compensation to secure\nhousing in the local housing market.  Although couched at times \nlike an effort to have the development go up around them, like a\nhighway built around a protected tree, or to have their units\nrehabilitated, this makes little if no practical sense after\nyears of litigation, approved redevelopment plans, and the\nexpenditure of significant public resources.  At this late stage,\nthe only real practical remedy is for plaintiffs to receive the\nfair value for their home as well as proper and non-\n2Plaintiffs state that their request for an injunction does\nnot seek to stall the first phase of redevelopment construction,\nwhich is the building of a 200-unit apartment building and 70\ntownhouses on a vacant 62-acre site.\n10\n\ndiscriminatory relocation procedures and benefits.3\nOn a motion for preliminary injunction, the Third Circuit\nhas emphasized that “the injury must be of a peculiar nature, so\nthat compensation in money cannot atone for it.”  Morton v.\nBeyer, 822 F.2d 364, 372 (3d Cir. 1987) (citation omitted).  It\ncould be argued that not being properly compensated so that\nplaintiffs are rendered homeless or forced to live in an\nundesirable location is a special type of injury for preliminary\ninjunction purposes.  Plaintiffs, however, have provided no\nevidence to demonstrate this will occur.  Instead, plaintiffs\nrely on their statistician, who states that plaintiffs will not\nbe able to afford to live in the newly constructed housing4 and\nthat they most likely will not find comparably-priced housing\nwithin Mt. Holly, which is evidenced by the fact that only 19 of\n62 families relocated by defendant Triad found housing within the\nTownship.  Plaintiffs do not provide any evidence the\nredevelopment will render them homeless--they only argue that the\nredevelopment will render them unable to remain in the Gardens\n3 The relief they are seeking is inconsistent with proving\nthe fourth element of their FHA claim--namely, that an\nalternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is\nviable.\n4Fifty-six low income housing units are planned for the new\ndevelopment.  Defendants represent that under New Jersey law\nthese low income homes cannot be promised specifically to the\ncurrent Garden residents, but rather the homes must be\ndisseminated pursuant to a lottery system.\n11\n\narea specifically, or in the Township generally.5\nThis claim of harm is speculative.  We simply do not know at\nthis stage where the remaining Garden residents will find\nalternative housing.   We do know that there is substantial\nevidence former residents have been successfully relocated both\nwithin and outside the Township, that these efforts are ongoing,\nthat some current residents may yet find housing in the\nredevelopment, and that these efforts are or will be funded, at\nleast in part, by the defendants.  Failure to demonstrate that\nthe harm plaintiff is suffering will not be compensated through\nmoney damages standing alone defeats plaintiff’s application.6 \nSee Morton v. Beyer, 822 F.2d at 367 (“To obtain a preliminary\ninjunction, the moving party must demonstrate both a likelihood\nof success on the merits and the probability of irreparable harm\n5The evidence on the record shows that other Garden\nresidents whose homes have been acquired by the Township and have\nbeen relocated are pleased with both their compensation and place\nof relocation.  In fact, the evidence demonstrates that many\nresidents now have significantly improved living conditions and\nare in better circumstances financially.  Additionally, the\ndefendants represent, and plaintiffs do not dispute, that none of\nthe people who have been relocated and wanted to remain in Mt.\nHolly were unable to do so.  \n6 The Court recognizes the line of cases that suggests that\nthe loss of one’s home, a unique and special piece of real estate\nhaving significant personal meaning, can be irreparable harm. \nThat argument, however, proves too much.  Taken to its logical\nextreme, such a rule would perforce preclude redevelopment\nprojects whenever residential real estate is impacted.  That is\nnot the law.  What the law requires is that parties from\nprotected groups be fairly treated and adequately compensated for\ntheir loss. \n12\n\nif relief is not granted, [and] we cannot sustain a preliminary\ninjunction ordered by the district court where either or both of\nthese prerequisites are absent.”).  Stated differently, even if\nplaintiffs had demonstrated a successful FHA claim for\npreliminary injunction purposes, of primary significance is that\nmonetary compensation will redress their FHA claim, as well as\nall their other claims.  Thus, even if plaintiffs leave their\nhomes and end up in an undesirable location, if they are\nsuccessful on any of their claims and are awarded their requested\nrelief--money damages--they can use that compensation to obtain\nthe housing they are entitled to by a judgment in their favor.  \nSimilarly, for the purposes of a preliminary injunction,\nplaintiffs have not shown how their interests outweigh the public\ninterest nor have demonstrated how the Township should proceed in\na different manner.  As mentioned above, both sides agree that\nbefore the redevelopment began, the Gardens was a blighted\nneighborhood in need of major improvement.  Now that the\nredevelopment has been underway for several years, the conditions\nof the Gardens has become even more of a hazard--to the people\nstill living there, to the workers, and to the community at\nlarge.  Every level of the New Jersey state courts has agreed and\npermitted the redevelopment to proceed, despite plaintiffs’\ncontinued challenges.  Plaintiffs have not demonstrated any\nviable alternative to the continuance of the redevelopment plan,\n13\n\nand to halt the process at this point as plaintiffs request would\nbe to subject everyone to crime, disease and injury. \nThe Court recognizes that being forced from one’s home with\nthe fear of not being able to afford a comparable living\nsituation, all in the name of redevelopment and the creation of\nhouses one cannot afford, is a difficult prospect and an\nemotional issue.  It is compounded by the fact that redevelopment\ndirectly affects low-income families who lack the resources for\nself-help.  This is evident in the report issued by the Public\nAdvocate, which uses the Gardens redevelopment as an example of\nwhy New Jersey’s redevelopment laws should be reformed.7  This\n7The Court notes that the certification of Marcia Holt, an\nemployee of defendant Keating who has been responsible for the\nacquisition of property in the Gardens and for the management of\nTownship owned property within the Gardens for the past two\nyears, evidences that the defendants have gone to great lengths\nto assist Garden residents with their relocation, and all\nattendant issues that arise from relocation.  The assistance\nprovided to the Gardens residents includes clearing of property\ntitles, credit counseling, rental assistance, assistance with\nschool, legal, and educational issues, wellness checks for the\nelderly, transportation services, and general counseling.  Ms.\nHolt has even purchased items--such as toilet paper, garbage\nbags, a child’s car seat--with her own money to assist residents. \nMs. Holt has also detailed the stories of dozens of families she\nand others have helped in improving their living and financial\nconditions.  Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence that any\nof these people have been dissatisfied with their relocation\ncompensation and location.\nAs a corollary issue, defendants have moved to have Ms.\nHolt’s certification filed under seal.  This issue was addressed\nat the hearing held on December 5, 2008.   Because the\ncertification contains sensitive personal information of non-\nparties to this action, plaintiffs do not contest the filing of\nMs. Holt’s certification under seal, no party has intervened to\ncontest the filing of this document under seal, and a redacted\nversion has been filed on the public docket, the Court will grant\n14\n\nCourt, however, cannot legislate from the bench, and it is\nrequired to follow the law as it currently exists.  Plaintiffs’\nrequest for preliminary injunction is based on their FHA claim. \nBecause the Court finds that plaintiffs have not shown that they\nare likely to succeed on such a claim or suffer irreparable\ninjuries, and because the public interest and balance of equities\nare in defendants’ favor, the Court is precluded from issuing an\ninjunction.8    \nCONCLUSION\n For the reasons expressed above, plaintiffs’ request for\npreliminary injunction must be denied.  An appropriate Order will\nbe entered.\nDate:   February 13, 2009   s/Noel L. Hilman        \nAt Camden, New Jersey NOEL L. HILLMAN, U.S.D.J.\n \ndefendants’ motion to seal.

If  such  claims  are  cognizable,  should \nthey be analyzed under the burden shift-\ning approach used by three circuits, un-\nder  the  balancing  test  used  by  four \ncircuits, under a hybrid approach used \nby two circuits, or by some other test? \n\nii \n \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED – Continued \n \n(a)  What  is  the  correct  test  for  deter-\nmining whether a prima facie case \nof disparate impact has been made? \n(b)  How  should  statistical  evidence  be \nevaluated? \n(c)  What  is  the  correct  test  for  deter-\nmining when a Defendant has satis-\nfied its burden in a disparate impact \ncase? \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \n \n  Pursuant to Rule 14.1(b), the following list iden-\ntifies all of the parties appearing here and before the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit: \n  The  Petitioners  here  and  Defendants-Appellees \nbelow are Township of Mount Holly, Township Coun-\ncil of Township of Mount Holly, Kathleen Hoffman, as \nTownship Manager of the Township of Mount Holly, \nJules Thiessen, as Mayor of the Township of Mount \nHolly. \n  The Respondents here and Plaintiffs-Appellants \nbelow are Mt.

Background. \n  This matter involves a challenge to a redevelop-\nment plan, adopted to address blight conditions on \nproperty comprised of vacant land and a residential \narea of Mount Holly Township known as “the Gar-\ndens.” The Gardens is a 30 acre area, containing 329 \ninexpensive,  market  rate  units,  which  were  pre-\ndominately  occupied  by  low  and  moderate  income \nhouseholds. (Pet. App. 5a). As of 2000, 74.9% of the \n\n3 \nGarden’s  residents  were  minority  and  19.7%  were \nWhite. (Pet. App. 6a).  \n  Mount  Holly  Township  is  a  small  New  Jersey \nmunicipality comprised of approximately 2.9 square \nmiles, and is the county seat for Burlington County. \nIn 2000, its population was 10,728, of which 66.19% \nwere Non-Hispanic White alone. (Document #17-04, \nJa103).1  Its  current  population  is  9,536,  of  which \n60.1% are Non-Hispanic White alone. (Pet. App. 78a-\n79a). \n \nA.  The 2002 Redevelopment Designation. \n  The Gardens had been problematic for the Town-\nship of Mount Holly (hereinafter the “Township”) for \nmany years because of high crime, poor maintenance, \na heavy concentration of rental units, overcrowding, \ncode violations, and related problems. (Pet. App. 6a-\n7a). As  explained  in  the  2002  Redevelopment Area \nDetermination  Report  (hereinafter  the  “Determina-\ntion Report”), as of 2002 “the Gardens area accounted \nfor 28 percent of the Township’s Part 1 crimes, even \nthough it is only (sic) accounts for 1.5 percent of the \nTownship’s total land area.” (Document #17-21, p.9, \n \n  1 References to “Document #___” are to the documents filed \nin the District Court below in this case. The number refers to \nthe document number generated by the electronic filing system. \nReferences  to  “Ja__”  are  to  the  Joint Appendix  filed  by  the \nParties in this action in the Third Circuit. The number following \nthe “Ja” refers to the page of the Joint Appendix in which the \nexhibit can be found. \n\n4 \nJa781). The Determination Report further noted that \nthe layout of the buildings contributed to this crime \nproblem  due  to  “paved  alley[s]  where  activity  can \ntake place under cover.” Id. \n  In  the  ten  years  preceding  the  redevelopment \ndesignation, Township Police employed several police \ninitiatives to combat the crime problem in the Gar-\ndens.  Between  1991  and  1997,  approximately  419 \narrests occurred within the Gardens because of police \ninitiatives.  (Document  #76-3,  ¶8,  Ja1931-1932).  In \n1999 alone, there were 152 arrests in the Gardens. \n(Document #17-21, p.12, Ja784). Despite these efforts, \nthere  was  still  significant  criminal  activity  in  the \nGardens in 2002. \n  Moreover,  the  Township  cited  properties  for \nmaintenance  and  other  property  code  violations. \nBetween 1996 and 2002, the 329 Gardens properties \ncollectively generated 1,117 code violation citations. \n(Document #17-21, p.16 & 38-43, Ja788 & 810-815). \nIn the late 1990’s, several organizations attempted to \nrehabilitate some units within the Gardens, including \na  group  organized  with  Township  support  called \nMount Holly 2000 (Pet. App. 7a, and 49a, n.11). De-\nspite  these  projects,  the  blight  conditions  were  not \ncorrected. Id. \n  Because it was evident that small scale attempts \nto correct the problem were not working, in 2002, the \nTownship designated the Gardens as an area in need \nof redevelopment pursuant to The Local Redevelop-\nment and Housing Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. \n\n5 \nThis designation under New Jersey law constitutes \n“blight” under the New Jersey Constitution.  \n \nB.  The Redevelopment Plans. \n  In 2003 the Township adopted a Redevelopment \nPlan for the Gardens. (Document #17-23, Ja842-866). \nImmediately,  the  Gardens  residents  filed  suit  chal-\nlenging both the designation and the redevelopment \nplan and alleging discrimination. (Pet. App. 11a-12a). \nThroughout  the  four  years  of  litigation  in  State \nCourt, all levels of the New Jersey Courts upheld the \nredevelopment or blight designation. (Document #17-\n31,  p.1,  Ja1114  and  Document  #17-32,  Ja1133).  In \nupholding  the  redevelopment  designation,  the  New \nJersey Courts found that the Gardens was a “dilapi-\ndated, overcrowded, poorly designed community” that \nwas  “detrimental  to  the  safety,  health,  morals  and \nwelfare of the community.” (Document #17-31, p.11-\n12, Ja1124-1125).  \n  On  December  16,  2004,  the  Township  acquired \n11.4 acres of vacant land immediately adjacent to the \nGardens.  Because  the  acquisition  of  this  property \npresented an opportunity to formulate a more com-\nprehensive  plan  for  redevelopment,  in  2005,  the \nTownship adopted an Amended Redevelopment Plan, \ncalled the “West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan,” for \nthe Gardens and the adjacent vacant acreage. (Pet. \nApp. 8a). After adoption of the 2005 Redevelopment \nPlan, the Township selected Keating Urban Partners, \nLLC as Redeveloper pursuant to a public Request for \n\n6 \nProposals  process  (“RFP”).  (Document  #17-30,  p.9, \n¶23-25, Ja1101).  \n  Again, in 2008, the Township amended the 2005 \nRedevelopment  Plan  to  conform  to  specifications  of \nthe Redeveloper’s project. (Pet. App. 58a). The 2008 \nAmended Redevelopment Plan called for acquisition \nand demolition of all the homes in the Gardens and \nthe construction of 520 new residential units, as well \nas 54,000 square feet of commercial space and 4.33 \nacres  of  open  space.  (Document  #37-2,  p.12  &  34, \nJa1587  &  Ja1609).  Of  the  520  units,  464  will  be \nmarket rate and 56 will be deed-restricted affordable \nhousing  units  pursuant  to  New  Jersey’s  affordable \nhousing laws. (Document #37-2, p.26, Ja1601). \n \nC.  Implementing the Redevelopment Plans. \n  The Township believed the adoption of the 2008 \nAmended Redevelopment Plan was the only way to \nimprove the quality of life for the Gardens residents \nand  the  citizens  of  Mount  Holly  in  general.  The \nDistrict  Court  specifically  recognized  the  Township \nwas motivated by significant concern for the Gardens \nresidents’ welfare. (Pet. App. 56a-57a). \n  Because of their concerns for the impact of the \nRedevelopment  Plan  on  the  Gardens  residents,  the \nTownship  decided  to  implement  the  redevelopment \nplan by voluntarily buying houses and/or providing \nrelocation benefits to residents who sought assistance \nfrom the Township for personal reasons, unrelated to \nredevelopment.  \n\n7 \n  Over  the  last  10  years,  the  Township  acquired \nand demolished over 237 of the 329 units in the area \nthrough voluntary sales and has not begun a single \neminent domain proceeding.2 (Pet. App. 10a-11a). Not \na  single  Plaintiff  nor  any  other  resident  has  been \nevicted or ordered to vacate or move from their home. \n(Pet. App. 47a). Rather, the Township gave the Gar-\ndens residents a notice advising them not to move \nuntil they were directed to move by the Township. Id.  \n  Many Gardens residents still chose to voluntarily \nsell their property because of the proposed redevel-\nopment project and also because of personal reasons, \nincluding threatened foreclosure of their homes, new \njobs, Section 8 issues, non-payment of rent, to attend \na  new  school,  overcrowding  in  the  structure,  N.J. \nDistrict  attorney  seizure  of  their  home,  and  death. \n(Document #76-1, ¶11.a, ¶12.b, ¶23a-b, ¶26.a-c & e-f, \n¶27.b  &  d,  and  ¶29.b;  Ja1850,  Ja1852,  Ja1863, \nJa1865-1870 & Ja1874).  \n  The  Township  then  demolished  the  Township \nowned properties because, as was specifically found \nby the New Jersey Courts, the vacant buildings posed \na health and safety threat.3 To date, only 70 of the \noriginal 329 units remain in private ownership and \n \n  2 In 2011, the Township began the appraisal and negotia-\ntion process that precedes eminent domain actions, which was \nstayed by the Third Circuit. \n  3 Even Plaintiffs admit that the Township owned properties \nwere posing health and safety hazards, namely infestation, fire \nhazards and mold. (Document #94, p.10, Ja1978).  \n\n8 \nnearly all 237 of the Township owned properties have \nbeen demolished. (Pet. App. 10a & 11a). Throughout \nthis demolition process, despite Plaintiffs’ numerous \nrequests for injunctions, no Federal or State court has \nprevented the Township from demolishing Township-\nowned buildings. \n  In  implementing  the  Redevelopment  Plan,  the \nTownship took care to ensure that those who wanted \nto  remain  in  Mount  Holly  would  find  appropriate \nreplacement housing. The District Court specifically \nnoted “[The Township] represent[s] and Plaintiffs do \nnot dispute that none of these people who have relo-\ncated  and  wanted  to  remain  in  Mount  Holly  were \nunable to.” (Pet. App. 55a, n.16). \n  To  assist  residents  in  finding  an  appropriate \nreplacement  home,  the  Township  gave  relocating \nresidents  double  the  relocation  benefits  required \nunder  State  law.  (Pet. App.  55a,  n.16).  Specifically, \ntenants  were  given  $7,500  in  relocation  benefits, \nwhich was $3,500 above the statutory maximum of \n$4,000. (Compare Document #76-1, ¶5, Ja1844 with \nN.J.S.A. 20:4-5(a) and N.J.A.C. 5:11-3.7(a)). Similarly, \nhomeowners were given $35,000 in relocation benefits \nin  the  form  of  $15,000  as  the  statutory  maximum \npayment and a $20,000 no payment and no interest \nloan which need not be repaid until the new replace-\nment home was sold. (Compare Document #76-1, ¶5, \nJa1844  with  N.J.S.A.  20:4-6(a)  and  N.J.A.C.  5:11-\n3.5(a)). \n\n9 \n  In addition, the Township provided a variety of \nsocial services to the relocating residents. (Document \n#94, p.14 n.7, Ja1982 and Document #76-1, Ja1844-\n1872).  Over  139  families  have  relocated  from  the \nGardens, including three former Plaintiffs and there \nis no evidence that anyone has been made homeless \nor could not find an appropriate replacement home as \na result of the Township’s actions.4 In fact, many of \nthe former residents’ economic situations improved as \na result of the relocation process. (Pet. App. 59a, n.16). \n  Despite the fact that the Gardens contained the \nTownship’s largest concentration of its Hispanic and \nAfrican-American populations (Pet. App. 6a), the re-\nlocation of over 200 Gardens households has not re-\nsulted  in  any  decrease  in  the  Township’s  minority \npopulation. In fact, according to the 2010 Census of \nPopulation  and  Housing,5  Mount  Holly’s  minority \npopulation has actually grown since 2000 (compare \n8.78% Hispanic and 20.08% African-American in 2000 \nto  12.7%  Hispanic  and  23.1%  African-American  in \n2010). (Pet. App. 78a-79a & Document 17-04, p.48, \nJa103). \n  As of May 2008 Mount Holly Township had spent \n$16  million  in  acquisitions,  relocations,  litigation \n \n  4 The only exception is Alandia Warthen, who moved in \n2005 as a result of her landlord’s actions, not the Township’s, \nand whose move predated the opening of the Township’s reloca-\ntion office. (Pet. App. 47a). \n  5 The Court is permitted to take judicial notice of Census \ndata. See Fong Yue Ting v. U.S., 149 U.S. 698, 734 (1893). \n\n10 \nexpenses and other costs in furtherance of the Gar-\ndens redevelopment.  \n \nD.  Federal Court Litigation. \n  After losing on appeal in all levels of the State \nCourts, Plaintiffs filed suit in Federal District Court. \nPlaintiffs claimed that the Township’s actions were \nhaving a disparate impact on minorities based on two \nstatistics.  First,  Plaintiffs  claimed  that  22.54%  of \nAfrican-American and 32.31% of Hispanic households \nas compared to 2.73% of White households in Mount \nHolly  would  be  affected  by  the  demolition  of  the \nGardens  properties.  (Pet.  App.  15a-16a).  Second, \nPlaintiffs’ expert claimed that the 2000 Census data \nshowed that only 21% of the minority households in \nBurlington County, as compared to 79% of the White \nhouseholds  could  afford  the  new  housing  proposed \nunder the redevelopment plan. Id. \n  In  challenging  these  statistics,  the  Township \npointed out that the first statistics, concerning the \nimpact of the demolitions, did not consider appropri-\nate comparable groups. The expert arrived at these \nnumbers  by  comparing  the  percentage  of  Whites, \nHispanics  and African-American  residents  living  in \nthe Township with those living in the Gardens. (Com-\npare Pet. App. 15a-16a with Document #17-4, p.49, \nJa104). This statistic only shows that the minority \npopulation  is  overrepresented  in  the  Gardens,  as \ncompared to the rest of Mount Holly. (Document #94, \np.6-7, Ja1974-1975). \n\n11 \n  As to the second statistic, namely the minorities \nwho cannot afford the new housing, Plaintiffs’ statis-\ntics  are  not  consistent  with  the  record.  Plaintiffs’ \nexpert opined that only households above 80% of the \narea  median  income  can  afford  to  move  into  the \nproposed Project. (Pet. App. 45a, n.9). According to \nthe 2000 Census data, there are a total of 123,725 \nWhite households in Burlington County, and of those \nhouseholds, 36,185 have incomes under 80% of the \nMedian  Family  Income,  meaning  87,540  White \nhouseholds  (70.7%)  can  afford  the  new  housing. \n(Document #17-4, p.51, Ja106). By contrast, there are \n24,806  minority  households  in  Burlington  County, \nand of those, 8,861 have incomes under 80% of the \nMedian  Family  Income,  meaning  15,945  minority \nhouseholds (64.2%) can afford the new housing. Id. \nThis is contrary to Plaintiffs’ statistics (21% versus \n79%).  \n  Plaintiffs  also  claimed  that  rehabilitation  of \nexisting units was a feasible option, citing to a “Biber \nReport”  done  in  1989  (hereinafter  “1989  Report”). \n(Pet. App. 26a-27a). The 1989 Report concluded that \nto  undertake  rehabilitation,  even  with  the  use  of \npublic  funding  sources  and  resale  income,  there \nwould  be  a  significant  financial  gap  of  over  $2.5 \nmillion in 1989 dollars. (Pet. App. 49a-50a).  \n \nII.  Decisions of the District Court. \n  After Plaintiffs Complaint was filed on May 27, \n2008, the Township filed a Motion to Dismiss, which \n\n12 \nthe District Court granted in part and denied in part \non October 28, 2008. Upon Plaintiffs’ filing of a Se-\ncond  Amended  Complaint,  the  Township  filed  a \nsecond Motion to Dismiss, which the District Court \nconverted to a summary judgment motion on October \n23,  2009.  On  January  3,  2011,  the  District  Court \nentered Summary Judgment in favor of the Township \nfinding that: (1) Plaintiffs’ failed to establish a prima \nfacie  case  of  disparate  impact  under  the  FHA;  (2) \neven if they had, Plaintiffs failed to show there were \nless restrictive means available to the Township; and \n(3) Plaintiffs failed to establish intentional discrimi-\nnation. (Pet. App. 38a, 43a & 55a). \n \nIII.  Decision  of  the  Third  Circuit  Court  of \nAppeals. \n  Plaintiffs appealed the District Court’s grant of \nsummary judgment to the Third Circuit. The Third \nCircuit  reversed  the  District  Court  as  to  Plaintiffs’ \nFHA claim finding that Plaintiffs established a prima \nfacie case of disparate impact sufficient to withstand \nsummary judgment. (Pet. App. 15a-19a). The Third \nCircuit, however, affirmed the District Court’s finding \nthat there was no evidence of intentional discrimina-\ntion, upholding the grant of Summary Judgment for \nclaims based on intentional discrimination. (Pet. App. \n28a). The Township then filed a request for a rehear-\ning en banc. Decision on the rehearing was deferred \nat Petitioner’s request pending this Court’s considera-\ntion of Magner v. Gallagher, Case No.: 10-1032, which \nhad been pending before the Court. Upon withdrawal \n\n13 \nof the Magner appeal, the Third Circuit denied re-\nhearing. (Pet. App. 63a-64a).  \n---------------------------------  --------------------------------- \n \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI.  THIS  COURT  HAS  NOT  YET  DECIDED \nWHETHER DISPARATE IMPACT CLAIMS \nARE  COGNIZABLE  UNDER  THE  FAIR \nHOUSING ACT. \n  Petition for Certiorari should be granted because \nthis matter involves an important question concern-\ning the Federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3604 \n(“FHA”), which has not been, but should be, settled by \nthis Court. Rule 10(c). To date, the Supreme Court \nhas not decided whether disparate impact claims are \ncognizable under the FHA.6 Thus, the issue of wheth-\ner disparate impact claims are cognizable under the \nFHA has remained unresolved and ripe for review for \nover two decades. \n  The provision of the FHA at issue in this case is \n42 U.S.C. §3604(a). The FHA makes it unlawful “to \n \n  6 Although  the  Supreme  Court  has  taken  two  disparate \nimpact cases under FHA, it has never decided whether disparate \nimpact claims are cognizable or what standard should be applied \nto such claims. See Town of Huntington, N.Y. v. Huntington \nBranch, N.A.A.C.P., 488 U.S. 15, 18 (1988) (the parties conceded \nthe applicability of the disparate impact theory and the Court \ndid not reach the question about the appropriateness of the test \nused) and City of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio v. Buckeye Cmty. Hope \nFound., 538 U.S. 188, 199-200 (2003) (vacating the FHA claim \nbecause it was abandoned on appeal). \n\n14 \nrefuse to sell or rent . . . , or otherwise make available \nor  deny,  a  dwelling  to  any  person  because  of  race, \ncolor,  religion,  sex,  familial  status  or  national  ori- \ngin.”  42  U.S.C.  §3604(a).  The  District  and  Circuit \nCourts below have interpreted this language to en-\ncompass  both  disparate  treatment  and  disparate \nimpact theories of liability. (Pet. App. 13a-14a & 41a-\n42a). The Third Circuit found no evidence of discrim-\ninatory intent or disparate treatment, and upheld the \nDistrict Court’s grant of Summary Judgment to the \nTownship  on  those  claims,  leaving  only  Plaintiffs’ \ndisparate  impact  claim  under  the  FHA.  (Pet. App. \n18a-19a & 28a). \n  Before  this  Court  can  determine  which  test \nshould be applied to a disparate impact claim, it must \nfirst  consider  the  threshold  question  of  whether \ndisparate  impact  claims  are  cognizable  under  the \nFair Housing Act. This antecedent question is critical \nin this case because if disparate impact claims are not \ncognizable under the FHA, there is no need to decide \nwhich test to apply.  \n  Most Circuit Courts deciding this issue have con-\ncluded  that  disparate  impact  claims  are  cognizable \nunder  Title  VIII,  42  U.S.C.  §3601  et  seq.  because \nthere  are  similarities  between  Title  VII,  42  U.S.C. \n§2000e et seq. and Title VIII. However, the plain lan-\nguage and purpose of the FHA differs significantly \nfrom  the  plain  language  and  purpose  of  Title  VII, \nmaking disparate impact claims under the FHA in-\nappropriate. Granting this Petition is essential to pro-\nvide the Circuit Courts with definitive and necessary \n\n15 \nguidance  for  determining  when  an  FHA  claim  has \nbeen made. \n \nA.  The  FHA’s  Plain  Language  Indicates \nthe  FHA  did  not  Include  Disparate \nImpact Claims. \n  Unlike  Title  VII,  the  Age  Discrimination  in \nEmployment  Act  of  1967,  29  U.S.C.  §621,  et  seq. \n(“ADEA”), and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, 42 U.S.C. §12101, et seq. (“ADA”), the FHA’s \nstatutory  language  does  not  include  language  ad-\ndressing discriminatory effect. Previously, this Court \nnoted  the  importance  of  considering  “key  textual \ndifferences”  between  statutory  provisions  when \ndetermining  whether  a  disparate  impact  claim  is \ncognizable under the ADEA. Smith v. City of Jackson, \nMiss., 544 U.S. 228, 236, n.6 (2005). \n  When undertaking statutory interpretation, the \nSupreme Court must “begin, as in any case of statu-\ntory interpretation, with the language of the statute.” \nCSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 131 \nS. Ct. 1101, 1107 (2011). This is because “the authori-\ntative statement is the statutory text, not the legisla-\ntive history or any other extrinsic material.” Exxon \nMobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc., 545 U.S. 546, \n568 (2005). “‘[W]hen the statute’s language is plain, \nthe sole function of the courts – at least where the \ndisposition required by the text is not absurd – is to \nenforce  it  according  to  its  terms.’”  Lamie  v.  U.S. \nTrustee, 540 U.S. 526 (2004).  \n\n16 \n  The ADA, ADEA, and Title VII by their express \nlanguage  each  prohibit  the  “effect”  or  “impact”  of \ncertain actions by using the term “affect” when de-\nscribing  unlawful  actions.  See  42  U.S.C.  §2000e-\n2(a)(2)  (emphasis  added)  (unlawful  to  “otherwise \nadversely affect his status”); 42 U.S.C. §12112(b)(1) \n(emphasis  added)  (unlawful  to  take  action  “that \nadversely affects the opportunities or status of such \napplicant  or  employee”);  and  29  U.S.C.  §623(a)(1) \n(emphasis added) (unlawful to “otherwise adversely \naffect his status as an employee”). \n  By  contrast,  the  FHA  does  not  contain  com-\nparable language regarding “effect” or the “affect” of \ncertain actions. “Discriminatory housing practice” is \ndefined in the FHA as “an act that is unlawful under \nsection [sic] 3604, 3605, 3606, or 3617 of this title.” \n42  U.S.C.  §3602(f).  None  of  those  sections  include \nlanguage  addressing  discriminatory  effect.  Section \n3604(a), which is the particular section at issue here, \ndoes not use the word “effect” or “affect” at all: \n. . . it shall be unlawful – \n(a)  To refuse to sell or rent after the mak-\ning of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negoti-\nate  for  the  sale  or  rental  of,  or  otherwise \nmake unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any \nperson  because  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex, \nfamilial status, or national origin. \n42 U.S.C. §3604.  \n  This Court has said, “‘we ordinarily resist read-\ning  words  or  elements  into  a  statute  that  do  not \n\n17 \nappear on its face.’” Dean v. U.S., 556 U.S. 568, 572 \n(2009).  Moreover,  “considerations  of  policy  divorced \nfrom the statute’s text and purpose could not override \nits meaning.” U.S. v. Tohono O’Odham Nation, 131 \nS. Ct. 1723, 1731 (2011). Since the FHA on its face \ndoes not discuss “affect” or “effect,” this Court should \nnot read those words into the FHA. Thus, the plain \nlanguage  of  the  FHA  does  not  permit  a  disparate \nimpact claim. \n \nB.  Congress  never Amended  the  FHA  to \nInclude Disparate Impact Claims. \n  Congress’s action in failing to amend the FHA to \ninclude  disparate  impact  claims  when  it  amended \nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 demonstrates Congress’s \nintent  to  exclude  such  claims  under  the  FHA.  If \nCongress had intended the FHA to apply to disparate \nimpact claims, it would have amended the FHA when \nit amended The Civil Rights Act of 1991 to specifically \ninclude  claims  for  discriminatory  effect,  as  it  had \ndone to Title VII.  \n  This Court has said that it is inappropriate to \n“ignore Congress’ decision to amend” Title VII where \nit  did  not  make  similar  changes  to  similar  laws \nbecause  “[w]hen  Congress  amends  one  statutory \nprovision  but  not  another,  it  is  presumed  to  have \nacted intentionally.” Gross v. FBL Fin. Services, Inc., \n557 U.S. 167, 174 (2009). This was also one of the \nreasons why this Court chose to limit the scope of \ndisparate impact claims under the ADEA. Smith v. \n\n18 \nCity of Jackson, supra, 544 U.S. at 240. In light of the \nlack  of  statutory  reference  to  discriminatory  effect, \nCongress’s failure to amend the FHA indicates Con-\ngress’s  lack  of  intent  to  include  disparate  impact \nclaims under the FHA. \n \nC.  Disparate Impact Claims are Unneces-\nsary  to  Further  the  Purposes  of  the \nFHA. \n  While both Title VII and the FHA were designed \nto  ameliorate  the  effects  of  discrimination,  their \npurposes are very different. One of the main purposes \nof the FHA is to “replace the ghettos ‘by truly inte-\ngrated and balanced living patterns.’” Trafficante v. \nMetro. Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211 (1972), declined \nto follow on other grounds by Thompson v. N. Am. \nStainless,  LP,  131  S. Ct.  863,  869  (2011).  The  De-\npartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development \n(“HUD”) has also recognized the FHA was designed to \naddress  the  “consequences  of  housing  practices,” \nnamely the creation, perpetuation or the increasing of \nsegregation. 76 FR 70922.  \n  By contrast, Title VII’s purpose was “to achieve \nequality  of  employment  opportunities  and  remove \nbarriers that have operated in the past to favor an \nidentifiable  group  of  white  employees  over  other \nemployees”  because  certain  practices,  policies  and \nprocedures “operate to ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior \ndiscriminatory employment practices.” Griggs v. Duke \nPower Co., 401 U.S. 424, 429-430 (1971). See also Int’l \n\n19 \nBroth.  of  Teamsters  v.  U.S.,  431  U.S.  324,  348-49 \n(1977). Discriminatory impact claims were permitted \nbecause  certain  practices  operate  as  the  functional \nequivalent  of  intentional  discrimination.  Watson  v. \nFort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 987 (1988). \n  “Section 3604(a) is designed to ensure that no one \nis  denied  the  right  to  live  where  they  choose  for \ndiscriminatory  reasons.”  The  FHA  was  designed  to \n“provide,  within  constitutional  limitations,  for  fair \nhousing  throughout  the  United  States.”  42  U.S.C. \n§3601.  It  was  not  meant  to  result  in  liability  for \nactions that were taken for non-discriminatory pur-\nposes simply because they impact the availability of \nhousing. As a result, not “every action which produces \ndiscriminatory effects is illegal.” Metro. Housing Dev. \nCorp.  v.  Vill.  of  Arlington  Heights,  558  F.2d  1283, \n1290 (7th Cir. 1977). See also Jersey Heights Neigh-\nborhood Ass’n v. Glendening, 174 F.3d 180, 192 (4th \nCir.  1999)  (stating  the  Fair  Housing  Act  does  not \nreach every event “that might conceivably affect the \navailability of housing.”). \n  The  vast  majority  of  disparate  impact  claims \nbrought in the housing context are not the functional \nequivalent to intentional discrimination and result in \nthe  potential  for  liability  for  non-discriminatory \nactions. This is because disparate impacts in housing \nare  often  caused  by  a  myriad  of  innocent  causes \nunrelated  to  the  actual  housing  policy  being  chal-\nlenged. \n\n20 \n  For example, minorities might be overrepresent-\ned in a neighborhood due to voluntary housing pat-\nterns of the minority residents. In such a case, any \npolicy that applies to such a neighborhood would have \na disparate impact. See City of Memphis v. Greene, \n451  U.S.  100,  128  (1981)  (noting  that  “[b]ecause \nurban neighborhoods are so frequently characterized \nby a common ethnic or racial heritage, a regulation’s \nadverse  impact  on  a  particular  neighborhood  will \noften have a disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic \nor racial group”). However, as has been recognized in \nthe school segregation context, a governmental actor \ncannot be held liable for an effect caused by residen-\ntial housing patterns over which it had no control. \nAustin Indep. Sch. Dist. v. United States, 429 U.S. \n990, 994 (1976). \n  Similarly, housing may be unavailable because it \nis blighted, unsafe or unsanitary. Occasionally, high \nconcentrations of minorities live in such buildings or \nneighborhoods.  If  a  governmental  entity  exercises \nits  police  powers  through  enforcement  of  building/ \nconstruction  regulations,  condemnation  of  unsafe \nbuildings, or redevelopment of blighted areas, hous-\ning could be made unavailable. Such unavailability is \ndue to the condition of the building or neighborhood, \nnot the race of the occupant or owner of the house. \nDisparate impact on a minority group is simply an \nunavoidable  consequence  of  such  valid,  legitimate \ngovernmental action needed to be taken for the public \nhealth and welfare.  \n\n21 \n  Finally,  housing  can  be  unavailable  because  of \nthe economic status of the household. Simply because \nminorities  might  be  overrepresented  among  low-\nincome households does not mean that a policy affect-\ning low-income households is an action taken “because \nof race.” This is because a mere statistical correlation \nbetween  poverty  and  a  particular  race  or  ethnicity \ndoes not transform discrimination against poor people \ninto racial discrimination. Ybarra v. Town of Los Altos \nHills,  503  F.2d  250,  253  (9th  Cir.  1974).  Even  the \ndrafters of the FHA recognized that the law of eco-\nnomics impacts the availability of housing. See 114 \nCong. Rec. 2279 (“Fair housing does not promise to \nend  the  ghetto  . . .  but  it  will  make  it  possible  for \nthose who have the resources to escape. . . .”). There-\nfore, unless decisions regarding low-income housing is \nhaving a segregative effect by driving minorities out \nof  the  municipality  or  preventing  minorities  from \nmoving in, the housing is not being made unavailable \ndue to race. \n  Allowing disparate impact claims under the FHA \nwould render illegal many legitimate governmental \nand private activities designed to promote the general \nwelfare  of  the  community.  Limiting  FHA  claims  to \nthose  showing  proof  of  intentional  discrimination, \ndisparate treatment, and/or actual segregative effect \nwill  sufficiently  advance  the  purposes  of  the  FHA \nwithout unreasonably limiting valid activities. Thus, \ndisparate impact claims are unnecessary. \n \n   \n\n22 \nII.  THE CIRCUITS ARE SPLIT. \n  Petition  for  Certiorari  should  also  be  granted \nbecause this matter involves an important question \nconcerning the FHA which has not been, but should \nbe, settled by this Court, and over which the Circuit \nCourts have entered conflicting decisions. Rule 10(a) \n& (c). While this Court has addressed the appropriate \nstandard for determining a prima facie case in Title \nVII employment discrimination cases, it has not done \nso for FHA cases involving disparate impact claims.7  \n  This lack of guidance has resulted in the various \nCircuit Courts’ development and application of differ-\ning  standards  for  determining  not  only  when  a \nplaintiff has satisfied its prima facie case under the \nFHA,  but  as  to  when  a  FHA  violation  has  been \nproven. Several of the Circuits have recognized this \nsplit.  See  Graoch  Assoc.  #33,  L.P.  v.  Louisville/ \nJefferson County Metro Human Relations Comm’n, \n508 F.3d 366, 382-385 (6th Cir. 2007) (Merritt con-\ncurring) and Keith v. Volpe, 858 F.2d 467, 483 (9th \nCir.  1988).  In  addition,  some  Circuits  have  not \napplied a consistent standard within their Circuits \nwhen  evaluating  disparate  impact  claims.  Clear \nguidance  from  the  Supreme  Court  is  necessary  to \navoid haphazard application of an important federal \nstatute  and  to  give  clear  standards  to  potential \n \n  7 As noted in Section I. above, the Supreme Court has taken \ntwo disparate impact cases under FHA, but has never addressed \nwhether such claims are cognizable or what standard should be \napplied.  \n\n23 \ndefendants as to when their conduct might potential-\nly violate the FHA. \n \nA.  Circuits  Applying  a  Burden  Shifting \nTest. \n  The First, Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, \nand  Ninth  Circuits  have  applied  a  burden  shifting \ntest to determine whether a plaintiff has established \na violation of the FHA.8 Under the burden shifting \ntest, a plaintiff can establish a prima facie case by \nshowing  disparate  impact  alone,  through  statistics, \nand then the burden shifts back to the defendant to \nestablish a defense. However, there is great variation \namong  these  Circuits  as  to  what  each  party  must \nprove and as to when the burden shifts back to the \nplaintiff.  \n \n1.  The Second & Third Circuits’ Varia-\ntions. \n  The variation applied by the Second and Third \nCircuit is the easiest standard for a plaintiff present-\ning  a  disparate  impact  claim.  This  standard  was \ndeveloped by the Third Circuit and adopted by the \nSecond Circuit. See Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, \n564  F.2d  126,  148-49  (3d  Cir.  1977)  and  Salute  v. \nStratford Greens Garden Apartments, 136 F.3d 293, \n302 (2d Cir. 1998). \n \n  8 As will be discussed later, the Second, Fourth, Sixth, and \nNinth Circuits have also applied other tests as well. \n\n24 \n  Under this variation, once a plaintiff has made a \nprima facie showing of disparate impact, the burden \nshifts  to  the  defendant  to  show:  (1)  that  it  has  a \nlegitimate reason for its actions; and (2) there is no \nless  restrictive  means.  (App. A,  22a).  Only  after  a \ndefendant  has  shown  both,  would  the  burden  shift \nback to a plaintiff. Id. This is the standard applied by \nthe Third Circuit in this case.  \n  However, the Second and Third Circuits diverge \nas  to  what  is  required  to  establish  a  prima  facie \ncase. In the Third Circuit, a plaintiff is simply re-\nquired to present statistics, of any type, so long as it \nshows  disproportionate  impact  in  some  “plausible \nway.” (App. A, 14a). No specific standard applies for \nmeasuring  disparate  impact.  Id. Any  statistics  will \ndo. \n  By contrast, the Second Circuit requires proof of \nthe following: “‘(1) the occurrence of certain outward-\nly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate  impact  on  persons  of  a  particular \ntype produced by the defendant’s facially neutral acts \nor practices[,]’” and (3) “a causal connection between \nthe facially neutral policy and the alleged discrimina-\ntory effect.”9 Tsombanidis v. W. Haven Fire Dept., 352 \nF.3d 565, 574-575 (2d Cir. 2003) (emphasis original).  \n \n  9 Title VII cases impose a similar causation requirement \nby requiring a plaintiff to (1) identify the specific employment \npractice being challenged and (2) provide “statistical evidence \nof a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in \n(Continued on following page) \n\n25 \n2.  The Sixth and Eighth Circuits’ Var-\niations. \n  The variation applied by the Eighth Circuit, and \nin at least one Sixth Circuit Court case, differs from \nthe Third Circuit test by shifting the burden back to \nthe plaintiff once the defendant has shown a legiti-\nmate  business  reason  for  its  actions.  Gallagher  v. \nMagner, 619 F.3d 823, 837 (8th Cir. 2010) and Graoch \nAssoc.,  supra,  508  F.3d  at  374.  In  other  words,  a \nplaintiff’s  prima  facie  case  can  be  rebutted  by  a \ndefendant  solely  by  showing  a  legitimate  business \ninterest. Then, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \nto show that the business reason is a pretext or that \nthere is less discriminatory means. Id. This variation \nis essentially a variation of the McDonnell Douglas \nburden shifting framework applied in Title VII em-\nployment cases. Graoch Assoc. 508 F.3d at 374. \n  It is unclear as to what, if any, guidelines the \nEighth Circuit utilizes for determining the sufficiency \nof statistics for a prima facie case of disparate impact \nbecause the Eighth Circuit has said, “[t]he elements \nof a prima facie case of discrimination will vary from \ncase to case, depending on the allegations and the \n \nquestion  has  caused  the  exclusion  of  applicants  for  jobs  or \npromotions because of their membership in a protected group.” \nWatson, supra, 487 U.S. at 994. These requirements are imposed \n“to avoid the ‘result [of] employers being potentially liable for \n“the  myriad  of  innocent  causes  that  may  lead  to  statistical \nimbalances.”’” Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 554 U.S. \n84, 100 (2008).  \n\n26 \ncircumstances.” U.S. v. Badgett, 976 F.2d 1176, 1178 \n(8th Cir. 1992).  \n  By contrast, the Sixth Circuit has indicated that \na  plaintiff’s  statistics  of  disparate  impact  must  be \nmeasured by inquiring into the impact of the action \nupon minorities in the total group to which the policy \napplied.10 Graoch Assoc., 508 F.3d at 378 (emphasis \nadded). Simply because minorities are disproportion-\nately represented in group to which a policy applies, \nthat alone is not sufficient to establish a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact. Id. at 378-379. \n \n3.  The First Circuit’s Variations. \n  The First Circuit burden shifting test differs from \nboth the Third and Eighth Circuits because once a \nplaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a defendant \ncan defeat an FHA claim by showing a “legitimate \nand  substantial  goal  of  the  measure  in  question.” \nLanglois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 51 (1st \nCir. 2000). In other words, when a defendant estab-\nlishes a legitimate business reason for its action, a \nplaintiff’s disparate impact claim fails. Id. Therefore, \n \n  10 In a Title VII case, this Court has also recognized that it \nmay  be  appropriate  to  limit  statistical  evidence  to  the  total \ngroup to which the policy applied. “When special qualifications \nare required to fill particular jobs, comparisons to the general \npopulation (rather than to the smaller group of individuals who \npossess the necessary qualifications) may have little probative \nvalue.” Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. U.S., 433 U.S. 299, 309 (1977). \nAccord, Watson, supra, 487 U.S. at 997.  \n\n27 \nunlike the Third and Eighth Circuits, there is no need \nor ability to show less restrictive means, by either a \nplaintiff or defendant.  \n  Like  the  Third  Circuit,  no  specific  standard \napplies for measuring disparate impact, as any statis-\ntical  analysis  is  sufficient.  Id.  at  50.  However,  in \nLanglois, the First Circuit did utilize the 4/  test used \n5\nin employment cases. Id. \n \n4.  The Fourth and Ninth Circuits’ Var-\niations. \n  Neither the Fourth nor Ninth Circuit has been \nvery clear on which test they employ. Both Circuits \nhave indicated that once a plaintiff has shown proof \nof discriminatory impact, it is appropriate to shift the \nburden back to the defendant to establish a legiti-\nmate  business  necessity. See Betsey v. Turtle Creek \nAssociates, 736 F.2d 983, 988-89 (4th Cir. 1984) and \nOjo v. Farmers Group, Inc., 600 F.3d 1205, 1207 (9th \nCir. 2010). The problem is that neither Circuit is clear \nas to whether they adopt the First, Third, or Eighth \nCircuit burden shifting tests. However, in at least one \ncase, the Ninth Circuit did apply the Eighth Circuit \nburden shifting test to a disparate treatment claim. \nGamble v. City of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 305 (9th \nCir. 1997). \n  As for the establishment of a prima facie case of \ndisparate  impact,  in  the  Fourth  Circuit,  the  Court \nrequired  that  a  plaintiff’s  statistics  of  disparate \nimpact be measured by inquiring into the impact of \n\n28 \nthe action upon minorities in the total group to which \nthe policy applied. Betsey, 736 F.2d at 988-89. It was \ninsufficient  to  rely  on  absolute  numbers.  Simply \nbecause minorities are disproportionately represented \nin a group to which a policy applies, that alone is not \nsufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate \nimpact. Id. \n  However, in the Ninth Circuit, at least one case \nallowed  a  group  of  plaintiffs  to  establish  disparate \nimpact  based  on  absolute  numbers  alone.  Keith, \nsupra, 858 F.2d at 484 (stating that because 2/  of the \n3\ngroup were minorities, disparate impact was shown). \n \nB.  The Multi-Factor Test. \n  The Fourth, Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits \nhave  utilized  a  multi-factor  test.  Under  the  multi-\nfactor  test,  a  plaintiff’s  FHA  claim  is  based  on  a \nnumber of factors. There is no shifting of the burden \nto a defendant. Therefore, these factors are required \nboth for establishment of a prima facie case and for \nproving an FHA violation.  \n \n1.  The Seventh Circuit’s Variations.  \n  In the Seventh Circuit, statistics alone are insuf-\nficient  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case.  Rather,  the \nSeventh Circuit requires proof of four factors: \n(1) how strong is the plaintiff’s showing of \ndiscriminatory effect; (2) is there some evi-\ndence  of  discriminatory  intent,  though  not \n\n29 \nenough to satisfy the constitutional standard \nof Washington v. Davis; (3) what is the de-\nfendant’s interest in taking the action com-\nplained of; and (4) does the plaintiff seek to \ncompel  the  defendant  to  affirmatively  pro-\nvide housing for members of minority groups \nor merely to restrain the defendant from in-\nterfering  with  individual  property  owners \nwho wish to provide such housing.  \nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., supra, 558 \nF.2d at 1290. Upon the weighing of these four factors, \nthe evidence must tip in favor of the Plaintiffs. Id. at \n1294.  \n  The Seventh Circuit has also clarified that cer-\ntain factors tip heavily either toward the plaintiff or \nthe defendant. For example, “courts cannot be overly \nsolicitous when the effect is to perpetuate segregated \nhousing.” Id. at 1293. By contrast, “if the defendant is \na  governmental  body  acting  within  the  ambit  of \nlegitimately  derived  authority,  we  will  less  readily \nfind that its action violates the Fair Housing Act.” Id. \n \n2.  The  Fourth,  Sixth,  and  Ninth  Cir-\ncuits’ Variations. \n  Some  version  of  the  Seventh  Circuit  Test  has \nbeen used by the Fourth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits. \nSmith v. Town of Clarkton, N.C., 682 F.2d 1055, 1065 \n(4th Cir. 1982); Arthur v. City of Toledo, Ohio, 782 \nF.2d 565 (6th Cir. 1986); and Keith, supra, 858 F.2d at \n483 (applying both the 3rd/8th Circuit tests and the \n4th/7th Circuit tests). While the Fourth and Ninth \n\n30 \nCircuits have applied the test using all four factors, \nthe Sixth Circuit has applied the test with only three \nof the four factors. Specifically, it did not require any \nshowing of discriminatory intent (factor 2).  Arthur, \n782 F.2d at 575. \n \nC.  The Combination Test. \n1.  The Tenth Circuit’s Variations. \n  The Tenth Circuit uses a combination test that \ncombines the Eighth Circuit’s burden shifting and the \nSeventh Circuit’s factor tests. The Tenth Circuit has \nbeen very specific as to what is required of a plaintiff \nand a defendant in an FHA case. \n  In a disparate impact case, a prima facie case can \nbe shown by plaintiff by statistical disparity. Moun-\ntain Side Mobile Estates P’ship v. Sec’y of Hous. & \nUrban  Dev.,  56  F.3d  1243,  1253  (10th  Cir.  1995). \nHowever, the statistical analyses must “involve the \nappropriate comparables.” Id. Additionally, some level \nof  causation  is  required.  See  Reinhart  v.  Lincoln \nCounty,  482  F.3d  1225,  1230-31  (10th  Cir.  2007) \n(stating “[i]t is not enough for the [plaintiffs] to show \nthat (1) a regulation would increase housing costs and \n(2)  members  of  a  protected  group  tend  to  be  less \nwealthy than others.) \n  Once a plaintiff has established their prima facie \ncase, the burden shifts to the defendant who must \n“‘produce evidence of a genuine business need for the \nchallenged practice.’” Reinhart, 482 F.3d at 1229. In \n\n31 \nother words, “the defendant must demonstrate that \nthe discriminatory practice has a manifest relation-\nship  to  the  housing  in  question.”  Mountain  Side, \nsupra,  56  F.3d  at  1254.  A  defendant’s  proofs  are \nevaluated based on three of the four Seventh Circuit’s \nArlington Height’s factors (excludes proof of discrimi-\nnatory intent). Reinhart, 482 F.3d at 1229).  \n  However, in evaluating these factors, the Tenth \nCircuit has said that if a defendant offers “valid non-\npretextual reasons for the challenged practices, the \ncourts should not be overzealous to find discrimina-\ntion.” Mountain Side, supra, 56 F.3d at 1253. More-\nover, the Tenth Circuit has said “‘courts ought to be \nmore reluctant to grant relief when the plaintiff seeks \nto  compel  the  defendant  to  construct  integrated \nhousing  or  take  affirmative  steps  to  ensure  that \nintegrated housing is built than when the plaintiff is \nattempting  to  build  integrated  housing  on  his  own \nland and merely seeks to enjoin the defendant from \ninterfering with that construction.’” Id. \n  If a defendant can satisfy this burden, then the \nburden again shifts back to the plaintiff to “‘“show \nthat other [policies], without a similarly undesirable \n. . . effect, would also serve the [defendant’s] legiti-\nmate interest.”’” Mountain Side, supra, 56 F.3d at \n1254. \n \n2.  The Second Circuit’s Variations. \n  The  Second  Circuit’s  standard  is  somewhat \nsimilar  to  the  Tenth  Circuit’s  standard  in  that  it \n\n32 \napplies a combination burden shifting and factor test. \nHowever, the Second Circuit combines the Seventh \nand Third Circuits’ tests. While the Second Circuit \nhas set forth very specific guidelines for how to eval-\nuate a defendant’s justification and as to the weigh-\ning  of  the  interests,  the  Second  Circuit  has  not \nprovided much guidance on evaluating a prima facie \ncase.  \n  The Second Circuit has said that once a plaintiff \npresents a prima facie case of disparate impact, the \nburden  shifts  to  the  defendant  to  “avoid  liability.” \nHuntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Hunting-\nton, 844 F.2d 926, 936 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d in part sub \nnom., Town of Huntington, N.Y. v. Huntington Branch, \nN.A.A.C.P., 488 U.S. 15 (1988). In deciding whether a \ndefendant  has  met  its  burden,  the  Second  Circuit \nrequires a showing of three factors taken from both \nthe Third Circuit and Seventh Circuit tests. These \nthree factors are “(1) whether the reasons are bona \nfide and legitimate; and (2) whether any less discrim-\ninatory  alternative  can  serve  those  ends”  and  (3) \n“whether the plaintiff is suing to compel a govern-\nmental defendant to build housing or only to require \na governmental defendant to eliminate some obstacle \nto housing that the plaintiff itself will build.” Id. at \n935-36 & 939. \n  Ultimately,  “there  must  be  a  weighing  of  the \nadverse impact against the defendant’s justification.” \nId. at 936. In undertaking this weighing, “the bal-\nance should be more readily struck in favor of the \nplaintiff when it is seeking only to enjoin a municipal \n\n33 \ndefendant from interfering with its own plans rather \nthan  attempting  to  compel  the  defendant  itself  to \nbuild housing.” Id. at 940. \n \nIII.  THE THIRD CIRCUIT’S DECISION CON-\nFLICTS  WITH  ONE  OF  THE  LEGISLA-\nTIVE GOALS OF THE FHA. \n  The Third Circuit’s decision conflicts with one of \nthe goals of the FHA because it impedes the Town-\nship’s  ability  to  replace  a  minority  predominated \nghetto with an integrated mixed race, mixed income \nhousing project. There are two concurrent goals of the \nFHA. The first goal is “that government protect the \nfreedom of individuals to choose where they want to \nlive.” 114 Cong. Rec. 2525 (statement of Sen. Brooke). \nThe second goal is the replacement of minority pre-\ndominated  ghettos  with  “truly  integrated  and  bal-\nanced  living  patterns.”  See  114  Cong.  Rec.  3422 \n(statement of Sen. Mondale).  \n  Several Circuits have recognized these dual goals \nof the FHA: “the Act was intended to promote ‘open, \nintegrated residential housing patterns and to pre-\nvent the increase of segregation, in ghettos, of racial \ngroups whose lack of opportunities the Act was de-\nsigned to combat.’” Metro. Housing Dev. Corp., supra, \n558 F.2d at 1289.  \n  The Fifth Circuit has stated, “[t]he provisions of \n42  U.S.C.  §3604  are  to  be  given  broad  and  liberal \nconstruction,  in  keeping  with  Congress’  intent  in \npassing  the  Fair  Housing Act  of  replacing  racially \n\n34 \nsegregated  housing  with  ‘truly  integrated  and  bal-\nanced living patterns.’” Woods-Drake v. Lundy, 667 \nF.2d 1198, 1201 (5th Cir. 1982). The Second Circuit \nhas gone so far as to say that the purpose of promot-\ning  integration  is  even  more  important  than  the \npolicy of protecting a person’s choice of where to live.  \nCongress’  desire  in  providing  fair  housing \nthroughout  the  United  States  was  to  stem \nthe spread of urban ghettos and to promote \nopen, integrated housing, even though the ef-\nfect in some instances might be to prevent \nsome members of a racial minority from re-\nsiding in publicly assisted housing in a par-\nticular  location.  The  affirmative  duty  to \nconsider the impact of publicly assisted hous-\ning programs on racial concentration and to \nact affirmatively to promote the policy of fair, \nintegrated  housing  is  not  to  be  put  aside \nwhenever racial minorities are willing to ac-\ncept segregated housing. The purpose of ra-\ncial integration is to benefit the community \nas a whole, not just certain of its members.  \nOtero v. New York City Hous. Auth., 484 F.2d 1122, \n1134  (2d  Cir.  1973).  This  is  probably  why  several \nCircuit Courts have recognized that not “every action \nwhich  produces  discriminatory  effects  is  illegal.” \nMetro. Housing Dev. Corp., supra, 558 F.2d at 1290; \nJersey Heights, supra, 174 F.3d at 192. \n  Depending on the circumstance, disparate impact \ncases can create a conflict between the dual goals of \nthe  FHA.  The  most  prominent  example  is  when \nhousing  must  be  condemned,  demolished  and/or \n\n35 \nredeveloped. In this case, Plaintiffs’ FHA claim causes \na conflict between the dual goals of the FHA. The \nTownship  seeks  to  redevelop  a  blighted  residential \narea  which  is  predominately  occupied  by  low  and \nmoderate income minority households and redevelop \nit into a mixed income neighborhood. The declaration \nof  blight  has  been  upheld  by  every  level  of  New \nJersey State Courts. The area is blighted and 80% of \nthe area’s occupants are poor minorities. (Pet. App. \n5a, 23a & 50a-51a, n.12-13). In its place, the Town-\nship’s plan seeks to construct up to 464 market rate \nhouses (in the form of townhouses and apartments), \nand  56  deed  restricted  affordable  housing  units  in \naccordance with New Jersey law. (Pet. App. 45a, n.7). \nIn  short,  the  Township’s  plan  would  replace  this \nsegregated  urban  ghetto  with  a  truly  integrated \nhousing  pattern  that  is  available  to  any  household \nregardless of race.11 \n  Plaintiffs demand that the area be redeveloped \nthrough  rehabilitation  only,  and  be  undertaken  in \nstages so that all of the existing residents who have \nsuccessfully been relocated would move back to the \nneighborhood.  (Pet.  App.  26a).  In  short,  they  are \n \n  11 The District Court also found that “the record shows that \nother Garden residents whose homes have been acquired by the \nTownship and have been relocated are pleased with both their \ncompensation  and  place  of  relocation.  In  fact,  the  evidence \ndemonstrates  that  many  residents  now  have  significantly \nimproved  living  conditions  and  are  in  better  circumstances \nfinancially.” (Pet. App. 55a, n.16). These facts are irrelevant in \nthe Third Circuit disparate impact variation. \n\n36 \nseeking  to  force  the  Township  to  perpetuate  the \nsegregated  living  conditions  in  the  Gardens  and \nspend millions of taxpayer dollars to do so. (See Pet. \nApp. 49a-50a stating Plaintiffs’ proposed rehabilita-\ntion plan fails to account for a $2.5 million funding \ngap). \n  This  Court  has  recognized  that  “Congress  has \nmade  a  strong  national  commitment  to  promote \nintegrated housing.” Linmark Assoc., Inc. v. Willing-\nboro Twp., 431 U.S. 85, 95 (1977). It is inconceivable \nthat  the  drafters  of  the  FHA  would  have  intended \nthat  the  FHA  could  be  used  to  force  governmental \nentities to continue or perpetuate segregation.  \n  Yet, the Third Circuit’s decision allows just that. \nThe  Third  Circuit’s  decision  places  the  Township \nbetween  a  rock  and  a  hard  place.  Obviously,  the \nTownship’s  redevelopment  of  the  blighted  area  has \nresulted in Plaintiffs’ allegations of a FHA violation. \nBut because there are a greater number of minorities \nliving in the blighted area, a prima facie case is made \nunder the Third Circuit’s variation. To the contrary, \nas  the  District  Court  noted  “the  ironic  observation \nthat  if  the  Township  had  allowed  the  Gardens  to \ncontinue to deteriorate as it had over the years, that \nit  might  then  be  fairly  characterized  as  having  a \ndiscriminatory  intent  towards  its  minority,  low  in-\ncome residents.” (Pet. App. 58a, n.18). \n  This Court should grant certiorari to clarify the \nstandard applicable in cases where the dual goals of \nthe FHA are in conflict. \n\n37 \nIV.  THIS  CASE  PROVIDES  THE  IDEAL  OP-\nPORTUNITY  TO  RESOLVE  IMPORTANT \nISSUES  REGARDING  THE  SCOPE  OF \nTHE FHA. \n  On November 7, 2011, this Court granted certio-\nrari in Magner, supra, Case No.: 10-1032 to consider \nwhether  disparate  impact  claims  are  cognizable \nunder the FHA and if so, what test should be applied. \nHowever,  Magner  was  withdrawn  by  the  parties \nbefore this Court could issue a decision on the merits. \nThe within case presents exactly the same issues to \nbe  considered  on  certiorari  as  were  presented  in \nMagner. This Court should grant certiorari to clarify \nthis important issue as it has once again come before \nthis Court. \n  Because  Third  Circuit  precedent  has  clearly \nestablished  the  cognizability  of  disparate  impact \nclaims under the FHA, any attempt by the Township \nto raise this challenge below would have been futile. \nBecause the Township was unable to raise this chal-\nlenge  below,  this  argument  was  not  waived.  See \nMedimmune,  Inc.  v.  Genentech,  Inc.,  549  U.S.  118, \n125 (2007) (failure to raise arguments was counsel’s \nsound assessment that the argument would be futile, \nnot  waiver).  Although  the  Township  may  not  have \ndirectly  challenged  the  cognizability  of  disparate \nimpact claims under the FHA, it did challenge the \nscope of the application of FHA in the redevelopment \ncontext,  arguing  that  a  redevelopment  plan  should \nnot  violate  Title  VIII  unless  it  has  a  segregative \neffect. (Pet. App. 23a). \n\n38 \n  It is appropriate for this Court to hear this case \nbecause it presents a pure question of law, namely \nwhether a disparate impact claim is cognizable under \nthe FHA. While consideration of the facts below are \nrelevant to determining whether any applicable test \nhas been met, they are immaterial to the determina-\ntion of whether disparate impact claims are cogniza-\nble and if so, which test should be applied. This Court \nhas previously recognized that purely legal questions \nare appropriate for certiorari even if the question was \nnot addressed by the lower court. See Nixon v. Fitz-\ngerald, 457 U.S. 731, 743 n.23 (1982); and Mitchell v. \nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985). \n  Finally, a claim not raised by the petitioner below \ncan be considered by the Court when “the interests of \njustice require its consideration,” Anderson v. U.S., \n417 U.S. 211, 223 (1974), or “where the question (1) is \nin ‘a state of evolving definition and uncertainty,’ and \n(2)  is  ‘one  of  importance  to  the  administration  of \nfederal law,’” Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, \n501 U.S. 1083, 1099 n.8 (1991). See also Gilmer v. \nInterstate/Johnson  Lane  Corp.,  500  U.S.  20,  37-38 \n(1991),  Stevens  dissenting,  recognizing  that  “[o]nly \nthis Term, the Court has on at least two occasions \ndecided cases on grounds not argued in any of the \ncourts  below  or  in  the  petitions  for  certiorari”  in \nArcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73 (1990) and \nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467 (1991). The inter-\nests of justice dictate that this Court provide clear \n   \n\n39 \nguidance as to when a plaintiff has established an \nFHA claim. \n---------------------------------  --------------------------------- \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, Petitioners respectful-\nly request that a Writ of Certiorari be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \nM.

Appellants, an association of Gardens \nresidents organized under the name Mt. Holly Gar-\ndens Citizens in Action, and 23 current and former \nresidents of the neighborhood (collectively the “Resi-\ndents”)  filed  suit  against  the  Township  alleging \nviolations of various anti-discrimination laws. \n  Before the Township filed an Answer or discovery \non  these  allegations  had  taken  place,  the  District \nCourt granted summary judgment to the Township. \nBecause the District Court misapplied the standard \nfor deciding whether the Residents could establish a \n\n5a \nprima facie case under Title VIII and because it did \nnot draw all reasonable inferences in the Residents’ \nfavor, we will reverse. \n \nI.1 \n  The homes in this dispute are located in a 30-\nacre neighborhood called the Gardens in the Town-\nship  of  Mount  Holly  in  Burlington  County,  New \nJersey. The Gardens is the only neighborhood in the \nTownship  comprised  predominantly  of  African-\nAmerican and Hispanic residents. It is poor – almost \nall of its residents earn less than 80% of the area’s \nmedian income; with most earning much less. \n  The 3292 homes in the Gardens are predominant-\nly two-story buildings made out of solid brick. Built in \nthe 1950s, the homes are attached in rows of 8 to 10 \nand are set back from the curving streets to allow for \nfront  and  back  yards,  with  alleys  running  behind \neach housing block. Two major commercial districts \nabut opposite sides of the neighborhood, which is only \na  mile  away  from  the  major  downtown  business \ndistrict. Until 2004, the neighborhood was also home \nto a playground and a community center. \n \n  1 Because this is an appeal from a motion granting sum-\nmary judgment, we examine the record evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving parties, here the Residents, \nwhile resolving all reasonable inferences in their favor. Wishkin \nv. Potter, 476 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir. 2007). \n  2 The record inconsistently describes the number of homes \nas 327 or 329. (JA 61, 776, 1114). \n\n6a \n  The  2000  census  provides  a  snapshot  of  the \nneighborhood.3 According to that data, the Gardens \nneighborhood was split evenly between rental proper-\nties (with a median rental price of $705 per month) \nand homeowners (the median cost of homeownership \nwas  $969  per  month).  Eighty-one  percent  of  the \nhomeowners had lived in their homes for at least 9 \nyears; 72% of renters had lived there for at least five \nyears. Of the 1,0314 residents living in the neighbor-\nhood, 203, or 19.7%, were non-Hispanic Whites; 475, \nor 46.1% were African-Americans; and 297, or 28.8% \nwere Hispanic, the highest concentration of minority \nresidents within Mt. Holly. Almost all of these resi-\ndents were classified as “low income”; indeed, most \nwere  classified  as  having  “very  low”  or  “extremely \nlow” incomes. \n  The  neighborhood  was  not  perfect.  For  one,  it \nwas crowded. This created a parking shortage, which \nled  residents  to  pave  their  backyards  for  use  as \ndriveways, which, in turn, led to drainage problems. \n \n  3 The  parties  dispute  the  utility  of  data  from  the  2000 \ncensus. However, none of the parties has briefed or even asked \nthe question of when precisely the violations at issue in this case \nbegan.  This  issue  is  important  because  the  redevelopment \nprocess began in 2002 and, as a result, the demographics of the \ntownship have changed. Disputes over which census numbers to \nuse thus create a moving target; however, the 2000 census data \nappears to provide the most accurate demographic data at the \ninception of the redevelopment process. \n  4 This is an approximate number provided by the Residents’ \nexpert. Elsewhere in the record, the neighborhood is described \nas home to 1,605 people. (JA 1114). \n\n7a \nIn addition, the fact that the homes were owned in fee \nsimple meant there was no one with a vested interest \nin maintaining common spaces, such as the alleys. \nSome of the owners were nothing more than absentee \nlandlords, renting to individuals with little interest in \nmaintaining the properties. Over the years, many of \nthe  properties  fell  into  disrepair.  Vacant  properties \nwere boarded up, some yards filled with rubbish, and \nparts of the area became blighted. Because the hous-\nes were connected to one another, the dilapidation of \none house could and sometimes did lead to the decay \nof the adjoining houses. Finally, the dense population, \nnarrow  streets,  and  vacant  properties  facilitated \ncrime. In 1999, 28% of crimes in the Township oc-\ncurred in the Gardens, even though that neighbor-\nhood covers only 1.5% of the Township’s land area. \n  These  many  problems  were  not  ignored.  Local \ncommunity activists and business leaders worked to \nrevitalize  the  Gardens  through  a  private  initiative \nthat  eventually  came  to  be  known  as  “Mt.  Holly \n2000.”  This  community  endeavor  sought  to  reverse \nthe neighborhood’s decline by rehabilitating proper-\nties and increasing social services. Despite sporadic \nachievements  –  ten  homes  were  renovated  and  a \ncommunity  policing  center  was  established  –  the \nneighborhood’s problems continued. \n  In the year 2000, the Township commissioned a \nstudy to determine whether the Gardens should be \ndesignated  as  an  “area  in  need  of  redevelopment” \nunder New Jersey’s redevelopment laws. The result-\ning  report,  issued  on  November  8,  2000  concluded \n\n8a \nthat  the  area  offered  a  “significant  opportunity  for \nredevelopment” because of blight, excess land cover-\nage, poor land use, and excess crime. (JA 699). That \nsame year, the Township began to acquire properties \nin the Gardens. Those properties were left vacant. \n  A  series  of  redevelopment  plans  followed.  In \n2003, the Township issued the Gardens Area Rede-\nvelopment  Plan  (“GARP”).  This  plan  called  for  the \ndemolition of all of the homes in the neighborhood \nand the permanent or temporary relocation of all of \nits residents. In their place, the plan provided for the \nconstruction of 180 new market-rate housing units, \nthirty  of  which  would  be  available  only  to  senior \ncitizens. The plan was changed in 2005 to include a \nparcel of land immediately north of the Gardens. This \nplan,  the  West  Rancocas  Redevelopment  Plan,  also \ncalled  for  the  destruction  of  most  of  the  original \nGardens homes, to be replaced with 228 new residen-\ntial  units  composed  of  two-family  dwellings  and \ntownhouses.  Unlike  the  GARP,  the  West  Rancocas \nplan provided for the optional rehabilitation of some \nof the original Gardens homes and allowed for the \nresidents of those rehabilitated units to be temporari-\nly relocated in phases so that they could remain in \nthe  neighborhood.  The  West  Rancocas  plan  also \ncontemplated  that  10%  of  the  228  units  would  be \ndesignated as affordable housing. Finally, in 2008, the \nplan was changed again. This time, the Revised West \nRancocas Redevelopment Plan called for construction \nof up to 520 houses, 75% of which could be townhous-\nes  and  50%  of  which  could  be  apartments.  The \n\n9a \nrevised plan called for only 56 deed-restricted afford-\nable housing units, 11 of which would be offered on a \npriority  basis  to  existing  Gardens  residents.  This \nrevised  plan  did  not  include  any  rehabilitation  of \nexisting units. \n  At  each  stage  of  the  process,  many  Gardens \nresidents objected to the redevelopment, complaining \nabout  the  destruction  of  their  neighborhood  and \nexpressing fear that they would not be able to afford \nto live anywhere else in the Township. One resident \ncomplained  that  the  house  next  to  hers  was  torn \ndown and that a bulldozer had hit her home, tearing \nthe wall, cracking the ceiling, and shifting her roof. \n(JA  577-78,  1001).  Another  resident,  a  70-year-old \ndisabled  homeowner,  told  the  Township’s  Planning \nBoard that, were he displaced, he would be unable to \nwork and unable to afford a new home. (JA 1002). At \none meeting in 2005, a planning expert testified that \nthe West Rancocas plan was deficient because it only \nallowed rehabilitation as an option, without requiring \nor even encouraging it. He also said that 90% of the \nGardens’  existing  residents  would  not  be  able  to \nafford the newly-constructed homes and complained \nthat the plan did not provide an estimate of afforda-\nble  housing  in  the  existing  market  for  displaced \nresidents. (JA 990, 1117). \n  Despite these complaints, work on the develop-\nment  continued.  In  February  2006  Keating  Urban \nPartners,  LLC,  was  chosen  as  the  plan  developer. \nKeating, in turn, hired Triad to develop a relocation \nplan. That plan, the Workable Relocation Assistance \n\n10a \nPlan  (“WRAP”),  was  submitted  to  the  New  Jersey \nDepartment of Community Affairs on September 28, \n2006  and  provided  that  all  residents  living  in  the \nGardens on August 1, 2006 would receive relocation \nassistance.  Qualified  homeowners  would  receive \n$15,000 and a $20,000 no-interest loan to assist in \nthe purchase of a replacement home. The Township \noffered  to  buy  homes  for  between  $32,000  and \n$49,000.5 The estimated cost of a new home in the \ndevelopment  was  between  $200,000  and  $275,000, \nwell outside the range of affordability for a significant \nportion  of  the African-American  and  Hispanic  resi-\ndents of the Township. \n  Renters were authorized to receive up to $7,500 \nof  relocation  assistance,  but  were  not  eligible  for \nrelocation  funds  to  return  to  the  Gardens.  In  any \ncase,  the  vast  majority  of  those  renters  would  be \nunable  to  afford  the  proposed  market-rate  rent  of \n$1,230 per month. Eventually, the Township paid to \nrelocate  62  families,  42  of  which  moved  outside  of \nMt. Holly Township. Renters who moved often had to \npay more in rent at their new homes. \n  Although  the  redevelopment  plan  called  for \nbuilding  in  phases,  the  Township  began  to  acquire \nand demolish all of the homes in the Gardens, there-\nby displacing many residents and creating conditions \nthat encouraged the remaining residents to leave. By \nAugust 2008, 75 homes had been destroyed and 148 \n \n  5 One home sold for $64,000 and another sold for $81,000. \n\n11a \nhomes had been acquired and left vacant. Later that \nfall, the Township demolished 60 more homes. And, in \nthe summer of 2009, 50 more homes were knocked \ndown. Residents living amongst the destruction were \nforced to cope with noise, vibration, dust, and debris. \nWorse, the interconnected nature of the houses trig-\ngered  a  cascading  array  of  problems.  Uninsulated \ninterior walls were exposed to the outside and cov-\nered with unsightly stucco or tar. But these coatings \ndid not extend below grade, allowing moisture to seep \ninto subterranean crawl spaces, creating an environ-\nment  for  mold  problems.  Above,  the  demolitions \nopened the roofs of adjoining homes. Those openings \nwere patched with plywood, which was insufficient to \nstop  water  leaks. Around  the  neighborhood,  homes \nbore  the  scars  of  demolition:  hanging  wires  and \ntelephone boxes, ragged brick corners, open masonry \njoints, rough surfaces, irregular plywood patches, and \ndamaged porches, floors and railings. Destruction of \nthe  sidewalks  outside  demolished  homes  further \ncontributed to the disarray by making it difficult to \nnavigate  through  the  neighborhood.  By  June  2011, \nonly 70 homes remained under private ownership and \nthe Township was in the process of demolishing 52 \nproperties  that  it  had  acquired.  These  conditions \ndiscouraged any attempt at rehabilitating the neigh-\nborhood  and  encouraged  existing  residents  to  sell \ntheir homes for less than they otherwise might have \nbeen worth. \n  In October 2003, Citizens in Action filed a suit \nin  state  court  alleging  violations  of  New  Jersey’s \n\n12a \nredevelopment  laws  and  procedures,  and  various \nanti-discrimination laws. Ultimately, the New Jersey \nSuperior Court dismissed some counts and granted \nsummary judgment to the Township on the others, \nconcluding that there was no violation of New Jersey \nlaw, that the area was blighted, and that the antidis-\ncrimination  claims  were  not  ripe  because  the  plan \nhad not yet been implemented. The Appellate Divi-\nsion  affirmed,  and  the  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court \ndenied a petition for certiorari. \n  The Residents filed suit in the District Court on \nMay 27, 2008, raising the anti-discrimination claims \nthat had not been ripe in their state suit. The federal \ncomplaint alleged, among other things, violations of \nthe Fair Housing Act (the “FHA”), Title VIII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1968; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, \nas codified at 42 U.S.C. § 19826; and the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.7 The Residents asked for \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief to stop the redevel-\nopment plan, as well as damages or compensation \nthat would allow Gardens residents to obtain hous-\ning  in  the  Township.  The  Residents’  motion  for  a \n \n  6 42 U.S.C. § 1982 provides that “[a]ll citizens of the United \nStates shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as \nis enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, \nsell, hold, and convey real and personal property.” \n  7 Section  1  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  provides  in \npertinent part that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person \nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” \n\n13a \npreliminary injunction was denied. After they filed an \nAmended  Complaint,  the  Township,  along  with  the \nother  named  defendants,  filed  motions  to  dismiss. \nThe District Court converted these into motions for \nsummary  judgment  and,  after  allowing  the  parties \ntime to brief the motions, granted summary judgment \nto the Township defendants. The District Court ruled \nthat there was no prima facie case of discrimination \nunder the FHA and that, even if there was, the Resi-\ndents  had  not  shown  how  an  alternative  course  of \naction would have had a lesser impact. \n  The  Residents  filed  a  timely  appeal  and  we \ngranted the Residents’ motion to stay redevelopment \npending this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1291. \n \nII. \n  We  exercise  plenary  review  over  a  District \nCourt’s ruling on summary judgment. See Disabled in \nAction of Pennsylvania v. Se. Pennsylvania Transp. \nAuth.,  635  F.3d  87,  92  (3d  Cir.  2011).  “Summary \njudgment  is  appropriate  only  where,  drawing  all \nreasonable  inferences  in  favor  of  the  nonmoving \nparty, there is no genuine issue as to any material \nfact . . . and the moving party is entitled to judgment \nas a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Melrose, Inc. v. City \nof Pittsburgh, 613 F.3d 380, 387 (3d Cir. 2010)). \n  The FHA makes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or \nrent  . . .  or  otherwise  make  unavailable  or  deny,  a \ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, \n\n14a \nsex,  familial  status,  or  national  origin.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 3604(a). A dwelling can be made otherwise unavail-\nable by, among other things, action that limits the \navailability of affordable housing. See, e.g., Hunting-\nton Branch, NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d \n926, 928-29, 938-39 (2d Cir. 1988); Smith v. Town of \nClarkton,  682  F.2d  1055,  1059,  1062-64  (4th  Cir. \n1982); Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, \n130 (3d Cir. 1977). The FHA can be violated by either \nintentional  discrimination  or  if  a  practice  has  a \ndisparate impact on a protected class. Cmty.  Serv., \nInc. v. Wind Gap Mun. Auth., 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d \nCir. 2005). \n  Disparate  impact  claims,  which  do  not  require \nproof of discriminatory intent, see Rizzo, 564 F.2d at \n147-48, permit federal law to reach “[c]onduct that \nhas  the  necessary  and  foreseeable  consequence  of \nperpetuating segregation[, which] can be as deleteri-\nous as purposefully discriminatory conduct in frus-\ntrating  the  national  commitment  to  replace  the \nghettos  by  truly  integrated  and  balanced  living \npatterns.” Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. v. Vill. of Arlington \nHeights, 558 F.2d 1283, 1289-90 (7th Cir. 1977). In \norder to determine whether action of this sort was \n“because of race” we look to see if it had a “racially \ndiscriminatory effect,” i.e., whether it disproportion-\nately  burdened  a  particular  racial  group  so  as  to \ncause a disparate impact. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 146-48; \nsee also Lapid-Laurel, LLC v. Zoning Bd. of Adjust-\nment of Twp. of South Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466-67 \n(3d Cir. 2002) (featuring claims of a disparate impact \n\n15a \non  handicapped  persons  in  violation  of  42  U.S.C. \n§ 3604(f)). This is called a prima facie case of discrim-\nination. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 148 & n.31. If such a case \nis established, then we look to see whether the de-\nfendant has a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason \nfor its actions. Id. at 148. If it does, the defendant \nmust then also establish that “no alternative course \nof  action  could  be  adopted  that  would  enable  that \ninterest to be served with less discriminatory impact.” \nId. at 149. Finally, if the defendant makes this show-\ning, the burden once again shifts to those challenging \nthe action, who must demonstrate that there is a less \ndiscriminatory way to advance the defendant’s legit-\nimate interest. Id. at 149 n.37. \n \nA. \n  When viewed in the light most favorable to the \nResidents, the evidence submitted by the Residents \nwas sufficient to establish a prima facie case. “[N]o \nsingle test controls in measuring disparate impact,” \nbut the Residents must offer proof of disproportionate \nimpact,  measured  in  a  plausible  way.  Hallmark \nDevelopers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 \n(11th  Cir.  2006).  Typically,  “a  disparate  impact  is \ndemonstrated by statistics,” id. at 1286, and a prima \nfacie case may be established where “gross statistical \ndisparities  can  be  shown.”  Hazelton  Sch.  Dist.  v. \nUnited States, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977). Accord-\ning to the data in the 2000 census conducted before \nthe  redevelopment  plan  began,  22.54%  of African-\nAmerican  households  and  32.31%  of  Hispanic \n\n16a \nhouseholds  in  Mount  Holly  will  be  affected  by  the \ndemolition of the Gardens. The same is true for only \n2.73% of White households. In short, the Residents’ \nstatistical  expert  has  calculated  that  African-\nAmericans would be 8 times more likely to be affected \nby the project than Whites, and Hispanics would be \n11 times more likely to be affected. Furthermore, the \n2000 data showed that only 21% of African-American \nand Hispanic households in Burlington County would \nbe  able  to  afford  new  market-rate  housing  in  the \nGardens, compared to 79% of White households. \n  The District Court’s first error was in rejecting \nthe Residents’ statistical submissions, which should \nhave been taken in the light most favorable to them \nat this stage in the proceedings. These statistics, like \nthose presented in Rizzo and other prominent hous-\ning discrimination cases, show a disparate impact. In \nRizzo, the plaintiffs presented evidence that, of the \n14,000-15,000  people  on  a  waiting  list  for  public \nhousing, 85% were black and 95% were of a minority \nbackground.  564  F.2d  at  142.  Under  these  circum-\nstances, we concluded that the cancellation of a public \nhousing  project  had  a  “racially  disproportionate \neffect,  adverse  to  Blacks  and  other  minorities  in \nPhiladelphia.”  Id.  Similarly,  the  plaintiffs  in  the \nSecond  Circuit  case  of  Huntington  Branch  used \nstatistics showing that while only 7% of the residents \nin  a  town  required  subsidized  affordable  housing, \n24%  of  that  town’s  Black  residents  required  such \nhousing,  which  meant  that  Black  residents  were \nthree times more likely to be affected by a shortage of \n\n17a \naffordable housing. 844 F.2d at 929. And in Keith v. \nVolpe, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the FHA was \nviolated where a blocked housing project had twice \nthe adverse impact on minorities. 858 F.2d 467, 484 \n(9th Cir. 1988). The disparate impact here, while not \nas extreme as the impact in Rizzo, is similar to or \ngreater than the disparate impact found sufficient to \nestablish a prima facie case elsewhere. Under these \ncircumstances, the District Court erred in granting \nsummary judgment to the Township. \n  Further, the District Court’s challenge to these \nstatistics in a footnote did not make the appropriate \ninferences. (JA 15-16 n.9). Instead, the District Court \nchallenged  the  statistical  analysis  underlying  the \n21% figure of Burlington County minority residents \nwho could afford units the redeveloped Gardens as \nboth too broad, because it took account of the entire \npopulation  of  Burlington  County,  and  too  narrow \nbecause  it  failed  to  consider  minorities  outside  the \ncounty who might move in. \n  In  addition,  the  District  Court  said  the  21% \nfigure did not take into account the fact that 56 of the \nunits in the Revised West Rancocas Plan would be \ndesignated  as  affordable  housing.  But  the  District \nCourt’s analysis failed to take into account the Resi-\ndents’  evidence  that  these  units,  although  labeled \n“affordable,” would be out of reach for almost all of \nthe Gardens residents. \n  The District Court also said that the statistics \nfailed to take into account non-minority purchasers \n\n18a \nwho  might  rent  to  minorities.  But,  unless  those \npurchasers  offered  below-market  rents,  this  would \nnot affect the inference that the project had a dispro-\nportionate effect on Blacks and Hispanics who would \nbe unable to afford market-rate units. \n  As to the District Court’s concern that the statis-\ntics did not take into account minorities who might \nmove elsewhere in Mount Holly, the Residents’ expert \nopined that affordable housing in the Township was \nscarce, and that most Gardens residents would not be \nable  to  afford  market-rate  units  elsewhere  in  the \nTownship. \n  Lastly, the District Court erred when it rejected a \nreasonable  inference  in  favor  of  the  Residents  by \nlooking at the absolute number of African-American \nand Hispanic households in Burlington County that \ncould afford homes. Instead, the District Court should \nhave looked to see whether the African-American and \nHispanic  residents  were  disproportionately  affected \nby the redevelopment plan. See Huntington, 844 F.2d \nat 938 (“By relying on absolute numbers rather than \non  proportional  statistics,  the  district  court  signifi-\ncantly underestimated the disproportionate impact of \nthe Town’s policy.”); Hallmark Developers, 466 F.3d at \n1286 (“[I]t may be inappropriate to rely on absolute \n\n19a \nnumbers  rather  than  on  proportional  statistics.”) \n(quoting Huntington, 844 F.2d at 928.).8 \n  There  is  another  problem.  The  District  Court’s \nmost troubling error is its conflation of the concept of \ndisparate  treatment  with  disparate  impact.  The \nDistrict Court essentially agreed with the Township \nthat because 100% of minorities in the Gardens will \nbe treated the same as 100% of non-minorities in the \nGardens,  the  Residents  failed  to  prove  there  is  a \ngreater  adverse  impact  on  minorities.  This  was  in \nerror.  We  need  not  simply  ask  whether  the  White \nresidents at the Gardens are treated the same as the \nminority residents at the Gardens. The logic behind \nthe FHA is more perceptive than that. It looks beyond \nsuch  specious  concepts  of  equality  to  determine \nwhether  a  person  is  being  deprived  of  his  lawful \nrights because of his race. Rather, a disparate impact \ninquiry  requires  us  to  ask  whether  minorities  are \ndisproportionately  affected  by  the  redevelopment \nplan. Thus the Residents can establish a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact by showing that minorities \nare  disproportionately  burdened  by  the  redevelop-\nment  plan  or  that  the  redevelopment  plan  “[falls] \nmore harshly” on minorities. Doe v. City of Butler, 892 \nF.2d 315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989). \n \n  8 The Department of Justice filed an amicus curiae brief \nagreeing that the District Court erred in its disparate impact \nprima facie case analysis. \n\n20a \n  The  Township  asserts  that  a  disparate  impact \napproach would result in the unintended consequence \nof  halting  the  redevelopment  of  minority  neighbor-\nhoods and that it is foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s \ndecision in City of Memphis v. Greene, which states \nthat \n[b]ecause  urban  neighborhoods  are  so  fre-\nquently characterized by a common ethnic or \nracial heritage, a regulation’s adverse impact \non a particular neighborhood will often have \na disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic or \nracial group. To regard an inevitable conse-\nquence of that kind as a form of stigma so \nsevere as to violate the Thirteenth Amend-\nment  would  trivialize  the  great  purpose  of \nthat charter of freedom. \n451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981). \n  There  are  three  problems  with  the  Township’s \nposition. First, City of Memphis was concerned with \nthe standard for establishing a violation of the Thir-\nteenth  Amendment’s  ban  on  the  “badges  and  inci-\ndents of slavery in the United States.” Id. at 125-26. \nWhatever that standard might be – a question left \nopen by the Supreme Court’s ruling in that case, see \nid. at 130 (White, J., concurring) – City of Memphis \ndid not consider the FHA. All of the courts of appeals \nthat have considered the matter, including this one, \nhave concluded that plaintiffs can show the FHA has \nbeen violated through policies that have a disparate \nimpact on a minority group. See Greater New Orleans \nFair Housing Action Center v. HUD, 639 F.3d 1078, \n\n21a \n1085  (D.C.  Cir.  2011)  (acknowledging  the  majority \nview but declining to take a position on the matters); \nSimms v. First Gibraltar Bank, 83 F.3d 1546, 1555 \n(5th Cir. 1996); Mountain Side Mobile Estates P’ship \nv.  HUD,  56  F.3d  1243,  1250-51  (10th  Cir.  1995); \nJackson v. Okaloosa County, 21 F.3d 1531, 1543 (11th \nCir.  1994);  Casa  Marie,  Inc.  v.  Superior  Court  of \nPuerto Rico, 988 F.2d 252, 269 n.20 (1st Cir. 1993); \nKeith, 858 F.2d at 482-84; United States v. Starrett \nCity  Assocs.,  840  F.2d  1096,  1100  (2d  Cir.  1988); \nArthur v. City of Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 574-75 (6th Cir. \n1986);  Smith,  682  F.2d  at  1065;  United  States  v. \nMitchell, 580 F.2d 789, 791-92 (5th Cir. 1978); Rizzo, \n564 F.2d at 147-48; Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 558 F.2d \nat 1290; United States v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d \n1179, 1184 (8th Cir. 1974). \n  Second,  the  Township’s  approach  urges  us  to \nconclude that the FHA is violated only when a policy \ntreats  each  individual  minority  resident  differently \nfrom  each  individual  White  resident.  Under  our \nprecedent, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case \nof  discrimination  by  demonstrating  that  the  policy \ndisproportionately affects or impacts one group more \nthan another – facially disparate treatment need not \nbe shown. For instance, in Rizzo, the waiting list for \npublic housing comprised 85% African-Americans and \n95%  minorities,  meaning  that  5%  were  White.  564 \nF.2d  at  142.  The  White  residents  on  the  list  were \ntreated the same as the minority residents on the list \n– each was hurt by Philadelphia’s decision to block a \npublic housing project – but we nevertheless found a \n\n22a \nviolation of the FHA because cancelling the project \nhad  a  “racially  disproportionate  effect”  on African-\nAmericans. Id. at 149 (“Nor can there be any doubt \nthat  the  impact  of  the  governmental  defendants’ \ntermination  of  the  project  was  felt  primarily  by \nblacks, who make up a substantial proportion of those \nwho  would  be  eligible  to  reside  there.”)  (emphasis \nadded). \n  The  Township  may  be  correct  that  a  disparate \nimpact analysis will often allow plaintiffs to make out \na prima facie case when a segregated neighborhood is \nredeveloped in circumstances where there is a short-\nage of alternative affordable housing. But this is a \nfeature of the FHA’s programming, not a bug. The \nFHA is a broadly remedial statute designed to pre-\nvent  and  remedy  invidious  discrimination  on  the \nbasis of race, see Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 \nU.S. 363, 380 (1982), that facilitates its antidiscrimi-\nnation  agenda  by  encouraging  a  searching  inquiry \ninto the motives behind a contested policy to ensure \nthat it is not improper. See Christine Jolls, Antidis-\ncrimination and Accommodation, 115 Harv. L. Rev. \n642, 652 (2001) (remarking that a “leading gloss” on \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Griggs v. Duke Power \nCo., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), is that “disparate impact \nfunctions as a means of smoking out subtle or under-\nlying forms of intentional discrimination on the basis \nof  group  membership.”).  We need not be concerned \nthat  this  approach  is  too  expansive  because  the \nestablishment of a prima facie case, by itself, is not \nenough to establish liability under the FHA. It simply \n\n23a \nresults in a more searching inquiry into the defen-\ndant’s  motivations  –  precisely  the  sort  of  inquiry \nrequired  to  ensure  that  the  government  does  not \ndeprive people of housing “because of race.” \n  Finally,  the  Township  seems  to  argue  that  its \nredevelopment plan does not violate Title VIII unless \nthe statistics show that it increases segregation in the \nTownship. (Twp. Br. at 18.). Showing that a policy has \na segregative effect is one way to establish a violation \nof Title VIII, but it is not the only way. See Hunting-\nton Branch, 844 F.2d at 937 (observing that a policy \noften  discriminates  in  one  of  two  ways:  having  a \ndisparate  impact  or  perpetuating  segregation).  The \nTownship is free to argue that its plan is less discrim-\ninatory than all of the available alternatives because \nit does the best job of integrating the neighborhood. \nHowever, those arguments are properly considered in \nthe context of the last steps of the Title VIII analysis, \nnot as a requirement of the prima facie case. \n  In reality, the District Court’s decision was based \non a valid and practical concern, which appears to \ndrive its reasoning throughout the opinion. It feared \nthat  finding  a  disparate  impact  here  would  render \nthe  Township  powerless  to  rehabilitate  its  blighted \nneighborhoods. This underlying rationale distorts the \nfocus and analysis of disparate impact cases under \nthe  FHA.  In  disparate  impact  cases,  “[e]ffect,  not \nmotivation, is the touchstone because a thoughtless \nhousing practice can be as unfair to minority rights \nas a willful scheme.” Smith v. Anchor Bldg. Corp., \n536 F.2d 231, 233 (8th Cir. 1977). Once the Residents \n\n24a \nestablished a prima facie case of disparate impact, \nthe District Court’s inquiry must continue to deter-\nmine whether a person is being deprived of his lawful \nrights because of his race. It must ask whether that \nTownship’s  legitimate  objectives  could  have  been \nachieved in a less discriminatory way. \n \nB. \n  Once the plaintiffs establish a prima facie case, \nthe  defendants  must  offer  a  legitimate  reason  for \ntheir  actions.  In  this  case,  everyone  agrees  that \nalleviating blight is a legitimate interest. The core of \nthe dispute between the parties is over the next step \nof  the  FHA’s  burden-shifting  analysis:  whether  the \ndefendants have shown that there is no less discrimi-\nnatory alternative. Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149. Only when \nthe defendants make this showing does the burden \nshift  back  to  the  plaintiffs  –  where  it  ultimately \nremains – to provide evidence of such an alternative. \nId.  at  149  n.37.  The  test  for  whether  there  is  no \nalternative  is  “similar  to  the  test  of  whether  the \ndefendant  has  demonstrated  that  the  requested \naccommodation is ‘unreasonable’ for the purposes of \nrebutting  a  claim  under  § 3604(f)(3)(B).”  Lapid-\nLaurel, 284 F.3d at 468. Section 2604(f)(3)(B) of the \nFHA  requires  that  reasonable  housing  accommoda-\ntions  be  made  for  individuals  with  disabilities.  In \nother  words,  the  defendant  must  show  that  the \nalternatives  impose  an  undue  hardship  under  the \ncircumstances of this specific case. See U.S. Airways \nv.  Barnett,  535  U.S.  391,  401-02  (2002)  (discussing \n\n25a \nthe  term  “unreasonable  accommodation”  under  the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act). \n  The District Court characterized the Residents’ \nproposed alternative as follows: \n[E]ffectively, plaintiffs are seeking to remain \nliving in the blighted and unsafe conditions \nuntil they are awarded money damages for \ntheir claims and sufficient compensation to \nsecure housing in the local housing market. \nAlthough couched at times like an effort to \nhave  the  development  go  up  around  them, \nlike a highway built around a protected tree, \nor  to  have  their  units  rehabilitated,  this \nmakes little if no practical sense after years \nof litigation, approved redevelopment plans, \nand the expenditure of significant public re-\nsources. At this late stage, the only real prac-\ntical remedy is for plaintiffs to receive the \nfair value for their home as well as proper \nand  non-discriminatory  relocation  proce-\ndures  and  benefits. . . .  The  relief  they  are \nseeking  is  inconsistent  with  proving  the \nfourth  element  of  their  FHA  claim-namely, \nthat an alternative course of action to emi-\nnent domain and relocation is viable. \n(JA 17 n.12) (ellipsis in original). \n  The  Residents’  evidence  is  susceptible  to  more \nfavorable inferences. The Residents are not asking for \npermission to continue to live in “blighted and un-\nsafe” conditions. Instead, they argue that there is a \nfeasible  plan  that  meets  the  Township’s  goals  and \nentails  more  substantial  rehabilitation.  Taking  the \n\n26a \nevidence in the light most favorable to the Residents, \none could credit the report of the Residents’ planning \nexpert, which stated that the “blighted and unsafe” \nconditions  could  be  remedied  in  a  far  less  heavy-\nhanded manner that would not entail the wholesale \ndestruction and rebuilding of the neighborhood. \n  The Residents’ expert pointed out that, although \nthe Revised West Rancocas Plan called for develop-\nment in stages, the Township began the development \nby aggressively acquiring houses, which it left vacant \nand then destroyed. He opined that a more gradual \nredevelopment  plan  would  have  allowed  existing \nresidents  to  move  elsewhere  in  the  neighborhood \nduring one part of the redevelopment, and then move \nback  once  the  redevelopment  was  completed.  The \nResidents’  expert  further  noted  that  the  Township \nhad not performed a comparative cost analysis show-\ning  that  total  demolition,  relocation,  and  new  con-\nstruction  was  less  feasible  than  an  alternative \nfocused on rehabilitation. Indeed, the expert went on \nto  propose  an  alternative  redevelopment  plan  that \nwould rely on the targeted acquisition and rehabilita-\ntion  of  some  of  the  existing  Gardens  homes,  the \ncombination of some houses to make larger homes, an \ninitiative to make the houses more attractive through \nthe use of landscaping and added amenities such as \ndecks and porches, and selective demolition and new \nconstruction,  including  the  construction  of  more \naffordable units. The Residents’ expert also provided \nexamples  of  previous  alternatives  –  including  one \ndeveloped  as  early  as  1989  –  to  show  that  the \n\n27a \ncomplete demolition of the neighborhood was not the \nonly  possible  solution  to  blight  in  the  Gardens.9 \nFinally, he provided a non-exhaustive list of state and \nfederal funding programs that would support such a \nredevelopment plan and observed that the Township \nhad failed to make an active effort to locate a devel-\noper with experience in neighborhood rehabilitation. \n  The  Township  provided  the  contrasting  state-\nments of its Township manager, who argued that a \nrehabilitation program was not economically feasible. \nIn support, she cited the fact that one alternative, the \nMt. Holly 2000 program, demonstrated that rehabili-\ntation of each unit would be extremely costly. She also \nchallenged the availability of sources of funding for \na  rehabilitation.  Lastly,  she  emphasized  the  many \nproblems that led the Township to declare the Gar-\ndens an area in need of redevelopment and asserted \nthe belief of the Township Council and its planning \nboard that demolition and replacement is the most \neffective and efficient approach to solving the neigh-\nborhood’s problems. \n  These  contrasting  statements,  as  well  as  the \nparties’ continued arguments on appeal as to the cost \nand feasibility of an alternative relying on rehabilita-\ntion,  create  genuine  issues  of  material  fact  that \n \n  9 The 1989 plan was not provided as the alternative but \nonly  to  show  that  less  discriminatory  alternatives  had  been \nconsidered  in  the  past  and  could  serve  as  the  basis  for  an \nupdated approach that would lessen the redevelopment’s impact \non minority residents of the Township. \n\n28a \nrequire  further  investigation.  Once  the  record  on \nalternatives  has  been  more  fully  developed,  the \nDistrict  Court  may  entertain  renewed  motions  for \nsummary  judgment,  taking  into  account  the  Town-\nship’s initial burden of showing that there are no less \ndiscriminatory alternatives, as well as the standard \nadvanced in Lapid-Laurel for ultimately determining \nwhether an alternative is unreasonable.10 \n \nIII. \n  The Residents are also seeking to recover under \nthe theory that the Township intentionally discrimi-\nnated against its minority residents when it adopted \nthe redevelopment plan. The District Court saw no \nevidence  of  intentional  discrimination  and  granted \nthe Township’s motion for summary judgment. After \ncarefully considering the matter, we discern no error \nin the District Court’s decision and will thus affirm \nthat ruling. \n \n   \n \n  10 Triad asserts that the portion of the District Court’s order \nrelating  to  its  involvement  should  be  affirmed  because  the \nResidents, on appeal, have waived their claims against it. We \ndisagree. In their brief, the Residents argue that the redevelop-\ners, which include Triad, provided inadequate relocation assis-\ntance, allowed residents to be improperly pressured to leave, \nand that the redevelopment plan essentially pushes minority \nresidents out of Mount Holly. For all of the reasons stated in this \nopinion, these are genuine issues of material fact that must be \nresolved through further discovery on remand. \n\n29a \nIV. \n  The Township has broad discretion to implement \nthe  policies  it  believes  will  improve  its  residents’ \nquality of life. But that discretion is bounded by laws \nlike the FHA and by the Constitution, which prevent \npolicies that discriminate on the basis of race. For \nthis reason, “the federal courts must stand prepared \nto provide ‘such remedies as are necessary to make \neffective the congressional purpose.’” Rizzo, 564 F.2d \nat 149 (quoting J.I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, \n433  (1964)).  A  more  developed  factual  record  will \nassist  the  District  Court  in  crafting  appropriate \nremedies, if necessary. For all of the foregoing rea-\nsons,  the  District  Court’s  order  granting  summary \njudgment  is  vacated  and  the  case  is  remanded  for \nfurther proceedings. \n \n   \n\n30a \nAPPENDIX B \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT \n----------------------------------------------------------------------- \nNo. 11-1159 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMT.

Plaintiffs  are  low-\nincome,  African-American,  Hispanic  and  “white” \nresidents  of  the  Gardens,  who  object  to  the  plan \nbecause they claim they are being forcibly removed \nfrom their homes, which are being replaced in large \npart  with  new,  much  higher-priced  market  rate \nhomes. \n  Currently  before  this  Court  are  defendants’ \nmotions  for  summary  judgment,  which  had  been \n\n35a \nconverted from motions to dismiss on four of plain-\ntiffs’ claims.1 The Court provided the plaintiffs with \nadditional time to respond to the converted motions, \nand then allowed defendants to file reply briefs. The \nsupplemental briefing is completed, and the remain-\ning claims that are now ready for final resolution are \nplaintiffs’  claims  for  violations  of  Title  VIII  of  the \nCivil  Rights Act  of  1968  (the  Fair  Housing Act  or \nFHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (Count One against all \ndefendants); the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1982 (Count Two against the Township); the Equal \nProtection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, brought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count Three against \nthe  Township);  and  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nNew Jersey State Constitution (Count Five against \nthe Township), as well a claim for punitive damages. \n  As  this  Court  previously  expressed  on  several \noccasions, we recognize that the Gardens redevelop-\nment has had an effect on low-income families, and, \ncorrespondingly,  minority  families.  The  Court  also \nrecognizes  that  being  forced  from  one’s  home  is  a \ndifficult and emotional issue, compounded by the fear \n \n  1 The other five counts were dismissed. Since this case was \nfiled over two years ago, it has been extensively litigated with \nseveral hearings, the denial of a TRO and preliminary injunc-\ntion, the filing of a second amended complaint, and the issuance \nof  numerous  written  Opinions.  Litigation  over  the  Gardens \nredevelopment also precedes this case in New Jersey state court. \nOverall, the concerns of several Gardens residents have caused \nthe dispute over the blighted neighborhood’s redevelopment plan \nto spend ten years in the courts. \n\n36a \nof being unable to afford a comparable place to live. \nHowever, as the Court has also expressed previously, \nplaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Town-\nship,  or  the  entities  assisting  the  Township  in  the \nredevelopment  and  relocation  services,  has  imple-\nmented a plan that has a disparate impact on the \nGardens  residents  as  the  law  defines  it.  Nor  have \nthey shown that the defendants have not been pro-\nceeding pursuant to a legitimate governmental inter-\nest  in  the  least  restrictive  way,  or  have  otherwise \nacted  with  discriminatory  intent.  Consequently,  as \nexplained more fully below, defendants’ motions will \nbe granted, and the case will be closed. \n \nDISCUSSION2 \nA.  Standard for Summary Judgment \n  Summary  judgment  is  appropriate  where  the \nCourt  is  satisfied  that  “the  pleadings,  depositions, \nanswers  to  interrogatories,  and  admissions  on  file, \ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is \nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the \nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  Celotex  Corp.  v.  Catrett,  477  U.S.  317,  330 \n(1986); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). \n  An issue is “genuine” if it is supported by evi-\ndence  such  that  a  reasonable  jury  could  return  a \n \n  2 Because the background and procedural history have been \nlaid  out  in  the  Court’s  previous  Opinions,  they  will  not  be \nrestated here. \n\n37a \nverdict in the nonmoving party’s favor. Anderson v. \nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). A fact is \n“material” if, under the governing substantive law, a \ndispute about the fact might affect the outcome of the \nsuit. Id. In considering a motion for summary judg-\nment, a district court may not make credibility de-\nterminations  or  engage  in  any  weighing  of  the \nevidence; instead, the non-moving party’s evidence “is \nto be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be \ndrawn in his favor.” Marino v. Industrial Crating Co., \n358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting Anderson, \n477 U.S. at 255). \n  Initially,  the  moving  party  has  the  burden  of \ndemonstrating  the  absence  of  a  genuine  issue  of \nmaterial fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, \n323  (1986).  Once  the  moving  party  has  met  this \nburden, the nonmoving party must identify, by affi-\ndavits or otherwise, specific facts showing that there \nis a genuine issue for trial. Id. Thus, to withstand a \nproperly  supported  motion  for  summary  judgment, \nthe nonmoving party must identify specific facts and \naffirmative evidence that contradict those offered by \nthe moving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57. A \nparty  opposing  summary  judgment  must  do  more \nthan just rest upon mere allegations, general denials, \nor  vague  statements.  Saldana  v.  Kmart  Corp.,  260 \nF.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir. 2001). \n \n   \n\n38a \nB.  Analysis \n1.  Count One-Fair Housing Act \n  This Court has already analyzed plaintiffs’ Fair \nHousing  Act  claim  substantively  in  the  context  of \nplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. That \nanalysis  was  adopted  in  the  Court’s  most  recent \nOpinion,  which  converted  defendants’  motions  to \ndismiss into ones for summary judgment. That analy-\nsis found that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that \nthe redevelopment has had a disparate impact on a \nprotected group, or that defendants did not have a \nlegitimate interest in the redevelopment, or that no \nalternative  course  of  action  would  have  a  lesser \nimpact. Recognizing that plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act \nclaim had only been considered in the context of a \npreliminary injunction, the Court afforded plaintiffs \ntime to gather specific facts to show a genuine issue \nfor trial on these issues. The Court now affirms its \nprior decision on plaintiffs’ FHA claim because plain-\ntiffs have not provided the requisite proof to take the \nissues to a jury. \n  As  a  preliminary  matter,  plaintiffs  argue  that \nthey should be afforded time for discovery, and are \nprejudiced  in  their  ability  to  oppose  the  converted \nmotions  because  of  the  lack  of  discovery.  Plaintiffs \ncontend that they require a look into the defendants’ \nstate of mind and intentions, as well as documents \nthat are only within the control of defendants and, \nthus,  unavailable  to  plaintiffs.  Without  this  infor-\nmation, plaintiffs argue that summary judgment is \n\n39a \npremature,  which  is  further  evidenced  by  the  fact \nthat defendants have not even filed their answers to \nplaintiffs’ complaint. \n  Although  the  Court  recognizes  the  peculiar \nprocedural history that has led to the resolution of \nsummary  judgment  motions  without  the  filing  of \nanswers or the undertaking of formal discovery, this \nis not a case where plaintiffs are neophytes filing an \ninitial challenge to the Gardens redevelopment plan. \nNot only has there been extensive proceedings over \ntwo years in this Court, most of these issues have \nbeen thoroughly litigated in New Jersey state court \nover the course of several years preceding this case.3 \nAs pointed out by defendants, plaintiffs have already \nhad the ability to obtain the information they seek \nthrough Open Public Records Act requests, as well as \nthrough the previous state court litigation. Further, \nmuch of the information is available by other means, \nincluding from the residents themselves or the Public \nAdvocate,  who  undertook  an  investigation  of  the \nTownship’s relocation practices.4 \n \n  3 The Court recognizes that the state court case was more \nnarrow  than  this  one,  and  the  civil  rights  claims  had  been \ndismissed as unripe, but none of the discovery plaintiffs contend \nthey need here to supplement the discovery from the state court \nlitigation would save their otherwise deficient claims. \n  4 In  the  Court’s  February  13,  2009  Opinion,  the  Court \nconsidered and referenced the Public Advocate’s report, which \nwas provided by plaintiffs pursuant to the Court’s November 25, \n2008 Order granting plaintiffs’ request to supplement the record \nwith the report. \n\n40a \n  Moreover,  plaintiffs  do  not  specifically  identify \nwhat  information  defendants  hold  to  support  their \nclaims, and instead request discovery generally, such \nas  depositions  of  key  officials  in  order  to  acquire \ntestimony as to their intent to “rid [the Township] of a \nminority community.” (Pomar Cert., Docket No. 106-\n41)  (“Residents  are  severely  prejudiced  by  being \nunable to probe, at a deposition, the attitudes, intent, \nand motives of the Township officials who made the \ncritical  decisions  to  pursue  the  Gardens  redevelop-\nment project.”). Discovery, however, cannot serve as a \nfishing expedition through which plaintiffs search for \nevidence  to  support  conclusory  speculations. \nGiovanelli v. D. Simmons General Contracting, 2010 \nWL 988544, *5 (D.N.J. 2010). Further, such deposi-\ntions may be barred by a privilege afforded to decision- \nmaking  government  officials.  See,  e.g.,  U.S.  v. \nSensient Colors, Inc., 649 F. Supp. 2d 309, 316 (D.N.J. \n2009).5 \n \n  5 Indeed, in addressing the same argument by plaintiffs in \nthe earlier state court litigation, Judge Sweeney explained, \nThere are many reasons why discovery is the excep-\ntion rather than the rule in actions such as this one. \nFirst, a public official’s state of mind is rarely an issue \nand can usually be determined from the record below. \nThere are transcripts, tapes, minutes and the like. \nSecondly, and no less important, is the consideration \nthat members of the municipal governing bodies and \nlocal boards serve without significant remuneration. \nThey would be far less likely to serve if their official \nactions frequently subjected them to the arduous dis-\ncovery  process.  Interrogatories  would  have  to  be  \n(Continued on following page) \n\n41a \n  Overriding all these points with specific reference \nto plaintiffs’ FHA claim, however, is that in order to \nprove  their  claim,  none  of  the  discovery  plaintiffs \nclaim  they  lack  would  save  their  allegations,  as \nplaintiffs must present their own proof of disparate \nimpact and a more-viable alternative. Stated several \ntimes before, Section 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act \nmakes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent after the \nmaking of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate \nfor the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavaila-\nble or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” \n42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (emphasis added). The FHA can \nbe violated by either intentional discrimination or if a \n \nanswered and depositions attended after usual hours \nof public service. It would place a chilling effect on \npublic service. \nHere, I am convinced that the discovery sought would \nburden the officials involved to a degree that would be \ntotally  disproportionate  to  any  usable  information \nthat could be recovered. Furthermore, there has al-\nready been one hearing in this matter. Although I lim-\nited plaintiffs to two expert witnesses, I also afforded \nthem  the  right  to  call  township  officials  to  testify. \nThey elected, for whatever reason, not to do so. Fol-\nlowing that hearing, I determined that the designa-\ntion  of  the  Gardens  as  an  area  in  need  of \nredevelopment had substantial credible support in the \nrecord, was a designation made in accordance with \nstatutory criteria, and I found no evidence of racial or \nethnic bias or animus in the testimony of . . . the town \nplanner. \n  (August 30, 2005 Opinion, L-3027-03, at 6-7, Def. Ex. A, \nDocket No. 84-3.) \n\n42a \npractice has a disparate impact on a protected class. \nCommunity Services, Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun. Authori-\nty, 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005). \n  Plaintiffs here contend that the Gardens redevel-\nopment plan has a disparate impact on the minorities \nliving in the Gardens. In order to prove their claim, \nplaintiffs must first establish a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact. Resident Advisory Board v. Rizzo, \n564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977). To show disparate \nimpact,  plaintiffs  must  show  that  the  Township’s \nactions  have  had  a  greater  adverse  impact  on  the \nprotected groups (here, African-Americans and His-\npanics) than on others. Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v. Zon-\ning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp. of Scotch Plains, 284 \nF.3d 442, 466-67 (3d Cir. 2002). \n  If a plaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the \nburden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate justifi-\ncation. The “justification must serve, in theory and \npractice, a legitimate, bona fide interest of the Title \nVIII defendant, and the defendant must show that no \nother alternative course of action could be adopted \nthat would enable that interest to be served with less \ndiscriminatory impact.” Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149. Final-\nly, “[i]f the defendant does introduce evidence that no \nsuch alternative course of action can be adopted, the \nburden will once again shift to the Plaintiff to demon-\nstrate that other practices are available.” Id. at 149 \nn.37. “If the Title VIII prima facie case is not rebut-\nted, a violation is proved.” Id. at 149. \n\n43a \n  Thus, it is plaintiffs’ burden to show disparate \nimpact, and if they do, it is their burden to rebut the \nTownship’s position6 and demonstrate a more-viable \nalternative  course  of  action.  Plaintiffs  have  done \nneither. \n  To support disparate impact, plaintiffs argue that \nthe redevelopment more negatively affects minorities \nin Mt. Holly than non-minority residents because the \nredevelopment is driving out the minority population \nof Mt. Holly. Plaintiffs also argue that the redevelop-\nment  plan  has  a  disparate  impact  on  minorities \nbecause the plan is targeted at an area that is popu-\nlated by mostly minorities. To support their position, \nplaintiffs  had  previously  presented  a  report  of  a \ndemographic and statistical expert, Andrew A. Beve-\nridge, Ph.D. Dr. Beveridge opined that the redevel-\nopment of the Gardens effectively and significantly \nreduces the minority population in Mt. Holly. \n  The  Court  had  rejected  that  proof.  The  Court \nexplained, \n  Even though plaintiffs have pointed out \nthat the redevelopment of the Gardens has \nreduced the minority population of Mt. Holly, \nthey  have  not  accounted  for  how  many  \n \n  6 In the October 23, 2009 Opinion, the Court found that the \nTownship had already met its burden based on the record before \nthe Court at that time. As explained more fully herein, plaintiffs’ \nsupplemental briefing does not demonstrate a material issue of \nfact regarding the Township’s legitimate interest and alternative \nchoices. \n\n44a \nminorities will move into the new housing. \nFurthermore, and more importantly for the \nplaintiffs’ FHA claim of disparate impact, the \nredevelopment plan does not apply different-\nly to minorities than non-minorities. Several \nplaintiffs classify themselves as “white,” yet \nthe plan affects them in the exact same way \nas their minority neighbors. The real effect of \nthe Gardens redevelopment is that there will \nbe  less  lower-income  housing  in  Mt.  Holly. \nAlthough the Township may have some obli-\ngation  with  regard  to  providing  a  certain \nnumber of low-income housing pursuant to \nother law, the reduction of low-income hous-\ning is not a violation of the FHA. The FHA \nprohibits  the  Township  from  making  una-\nvailable a dwelling to any person because of \nrace – it does not speak to income. Redevel-\nopment  of  blighted,  low-income  housing  is \nnot, without more, a violation of the FHA. \nHere, where fourteen homes are occupied by \nAfrican-American  plaintiffs,  thirteen  homes \nare occupied by Hispanic plaintiffs, and six \nhomes are occupied by “white” plaintiffs, and \nall are affected in the same way by the rede-\nvelopment, the Court cannot find, on the cur-\nrent  record  at  this  preliminary  injunction \nstage,  that  plaintiffs  will  succeed  on  their \ndisparate impact FHA claim. \n(Feb. 13, 2009 Op. at 7-8.) \n  In  their  opposition  to  the  converted  motions, \nplaintiffs  present  the  same  statistics,  and  further \nargue  that  there  is  disparate  impact  on  minorities \n\n45a \nbecause  the  displaced  plaintiffs  will  not  be  able  to \nafford the new $200,000+ homes, or the $1,300 to rent \nthese same properties.7 As explained before, however, \nif none of the plaintiffs can afford the new homes, it is \nnot just the African-American and Hispanic plaintiffs \nwho are impacted by the increased housing prices – it \nis  all  Gardens  residents,  including  the  Caucasian \nresidents.8  Additionally,  as  also  explained  before, \nplaintiffs have not demonstrated that the Township is \npreventing minorities from purchasing or moving into \nthe new homes, or otherwise limiting the new resi-\ndents to non-minorities. Plaintiffs have not provided \nany proof or statistics to suggest that the new homes \ncreated by the redevelopment will be financially out-\nof-reach for all or most minorities.9 \n \n  7 Although 464 units will be market rate, 56 will be deed-\nrestricted affordable housing units. \n  8 Relatedly, plaintiffs argue that because a greater percent-\nage of minority Township residents have been affected by the \nredevelopment  they  have  demonstrated  a  disparate  impact. \nEven if this statistic was sufficient to establish a prima facie \ncase,  plaintiffs’  FHA  claim  fails  for  reasons  other  than  the \ndisparate impact analysis. \n  9 Plaintiffs  present  statistics  that  only  21%  of  African-\nAmerican and Hispanic households in Burlington County would \nbe able to afford the new houses, because that percentage of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic population earns above 80% of \nthe median income ($44,580). (Bev. Cert., Ex. B-2, Docket No. \n106-4.) This is in contrast to 79% of white Burlington County \nresidents who earn above 80% of the median income. (Id.) These \nstatistics hold little validity to show a disparate impact on the \nTownship’s minority population for several reasons: (1) they take \ninto account the entire population of Burlington County, rather \n(Continued on following page) \n\n46a \n  Furthermore,  under  plaintiffs’  logic,  any  action \nby the Township to do anything with regard to the \nGardens would result in a disparate impact, simply \nbecause of the racial composition of the Gardens. The \nFHA (or any other civil rights law) does not contem-\nplate that a town will never be permitted to amelio-\nrate a blighted area inhabited mainly by minorities \nsimply because it will affect minorities. See, e.g., City \nof Memphis v. Greene, 451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981) (“Be-\ncause urban neighborhoods are so frequently charac-\nterized  by  a  common  ethnic  or  racial  heritage,  a \nregulation’s adverse impact on a particular neighbor-\nhood will often have a disparate effect on an identifi-\nable ethnic or racial group. To regard an inevitable \nconsequence  of  that  kind  as  a  form  of  stigma  so \nsevere as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment would \ntrivialize the great purpose of that charter of free-\ndom.”). \n \nthan only Mt. Holly Township, and the towns in Burlington \nCounty are of various economic and racial compositions; (2) they \ndo  not  account  for  minorities  who  will  move  into  Mt.  Holly \nTownship  from  outside  Burlington  County;  (3)  they  do  not \naccount for the deed restricted units that will be more afforda-\nble; (4) they do not account for a non-minority purchaser who \nrents to a minority; (5) they do not account for the minorities \nwho will move elsewhere within Mt. Holly Township; and (6) \nmore recent population survey data (from 2008, compared to the \n2000  Census  data  used  by  plaintiffs’  expert)  shows  16,744 \nAfrican-American  and  Hispanic  households  in  Burlington \nCounty have incomes exceeding $45,000, evidence of the minori-\nty population’s ability to occupy all 464 market rate homes. \n\n47a \n  Finally, it is important to point out that none of \nthe plaintiffs has been forced out of their homes by \nthe Township without the offer of relocation services. \nThe FHA makes it unlawful to otherwise make una-\nvailable or deny a dwelling to any person because of \nrace. The Township has advised the residents not to \nmove until directed by the Township so that they will \nbe  eligible  for  relocation  assistance.  All  plaintiffs, \nsave for one who was told to leave by her landlord, \nare still residing in the Gardens. Thus, on this basis \nalone, plaintiffs’ FHA claim fails. \n  But even if plaintiffs were able to establish their \nprima facie case, they have not rebutted the Town-\nship’s legitimate interest in the redevelopment, and \nthey  have  not  shown  how  an  alternative  course  of \naction would have a lesser impact. Plaintiffs cannot \nrefute  that  redevelopment  of  the  community  to  re-\nmove blight conditions is a bona fide interest of the \nstate, as explained previously by this Court and by \nthe New Jersey Appellate Division. (See Feb. 13, 2009 \nOp. at 9, citing Wilson v. City of Long Branch, 142 \nA.2d  837,  842  (N.J.  1958)  (“Community  redevelop-\nment  is  a  modern  facet  of  municipal  government. \nSoundly planned redevelopment can make the differ-\nence between continued stagnation and decline and a \nresurgence of healthy growth. It provides the means \nof removing the decadent effect of slums and blight on \nneighboring property values, of opening up new areas \nfor  residence  and  industry.”);  Citizens  In  Action  v. \nTownship Of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL 1930457, *13 (N.J. \nSuper. Ct. App. Div. July 5, 2007) (finding that “[t]he \n\n48a \ndilapidated, overcrowded, poorly designed community \n[the Gardens], in addition to the high level of crime in \nthe area, is clearly detrimental to the safety, health, \nmorals and welfare of the community”).) It is clear \nthat the Township has a legitimate interest in the \nredevelopment of the Gardens. \n  With regard to alternatives, plaintiffs have not \nidentified disputed issues of fact concerning whether \nthe  Township  failed  to  show  “that  no  alternative \ncourse of action could be adopted that would enable \nthat  interest  to  be  served  with  less  discriminatory \nimpact.” Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149. The adequacy of the \nredevelopment  plan,  as  opposed  the  rehabilitation \nplan  advocated  by  Plaintiffs,  was  extensively  ana-\nlyzed  in  New  Jersey  state  court.  See  Citizens  In \nAction v. Township Of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL 1930457, \n14 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007) (finding that “the \nredevelopment designation is based on a record that \nprovides substantial evidence in support of the de-\ntermination”).10 \n \n  10 Even though that analysis was performed in the context \nof  plaintiffs’  claims  under  New  Jersey’s  Local  Housing  and \nRedevelopment  Law,  N.J.S.A.  40A:12A-1  to  -73  (LHRL),  the \nissue of the sufficiency of the 2005 redevelopment plan was \nextensively litigated. Thus, collateral estoppel principles may \nalso apply. See In re Graham, 973 F.2d 1089, 1097 (3d Cir. 1992) \n(citations  omitted)  (explaining  that  issue  preclusion  applies \nwhen “(1) the issue sought to be precluded is the same as that \ninvolved in the prior action; (2) that issue was actually litigated; \n(3) it was determined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the \ndetermination was essential to the prior judgment”). The Court, \n(Continued on following page) \n\n49a \n  Plaintiffs  have  not  presented  any  plan  more \nviable than the one implemented by the Township.11 \nThey  advocate  rehabilitation,  but  have  proposed  a \nplan, as pointed out by defendants, that relies upon \ngovernmental  subsidies  and  upon  costs  based  on \nproperty conditions in 1989. It also does not take into \naccount rehabilitation costs to rehab owner-occupied \n \nhowever, refrains from considering this issue because plaintiffs’ \nFHA claim, which also concerns the 2008 revised redevelopment \nplan, was not litigated in state court. \n  11 The Township has shown that several organizations have \nattempted to rehabilitate the Gardens in the last 15 or so years. \nThese small scale efforts were ineffective in curing the overall \nblight of the community, which was a frustrating result for the \norganizations, the Township, and the residents. (See Sept. 8, \n2003 Town Council meeting transcript at 25-26, 31-32, Def. Ex. \nB.). Plaintiffs argue that it is not their burden to prove a better \nalternative. Although it is true that the Township must show the \nother alternatives they considered and rejected, and that the \nalternative course of action could not “be adopted that would \nenable  that  interest  to  be  served  with  less  discriminatory \nimpact,” once that showing is made, the ultimate burden “once \nagain shift[s] to the Plaintiff to demonstrate that other practices \nare available.” Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149. Thus, plaintiffs in this \ncase have the obligation to show what alternatives would have \nbetter  served  the  community.  Of  course,  this  analysis  was \nintended to be performed after a finding of disparate impact, \nwhich causes this “alternative course of action” analysis to make \nmore sense in that context – that is, if disparate impact is \nshown, the Township has the burden of showing it had no choice \nbut to proceed in its chosen path despite the disparate impact. \nHere, where no disparate impact has been shown, this analysis \ndevolves into plaintiffs’ personal disagreement with the plan, \nand an argument as to what they believe to be the best course of \naction. The fact that the Township did not follow a plan sanc-\ntioned by the plaintiffs is not the standard for a FHA claim. \n\n50a \nhomes,  which  is  an  additional  $2.5  million,  and  it \ndoes  not  account  for  temporary  relocation  costs.12 \nSimply because the properties could have been reha-\nbilitated does not mean that rehabilitation was the \nfeasible option.13 \n \n  12 Plaintiffs’ residential planning expert, Gary Smith, AIA, \nAICP, relates in his updated certification that the Township is \nviolating several building codes in its demolition process. The \nlegality of how the Township is currently proceeding under its \nredevelopment  plan  is  not  before  the  Court.  Mr.  Smith  also \nopines  that  the  redevelopment  plan  should  be  halted,  and \nredirected to save the existing housing stock for rehabilitation. \nAs the Court commented before, however, “[e]ffectively, plaintiffs \nare seeking to remain living in the blighted and unsafe condi-\ntions until they are awarded money damages for their claims \nand  sufficient  compensation  to  secure  housing  in  the  local \nhousing market. Although couched at times like an effort to have \nthe  development  go  up  around  them,  like  a  highway  built \naround a protected tree, or to have their units rehabilitated, this \nmakes  little  if  no  practical  sense  after  years  of  litigation, \napproved redevelopment plans, and the expenditure of signifi-\ncant public resources. At this late stage, the only real practical \nremedy is for plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their home as \nwell as proper and non-discriminatory relocation procedures and \nbenefits. . . .  The  relief they  are  seeking  is inconsistent  with \nproving the fourth element of their FHA claim – namely, that an \nalternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is \nviable.” (Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 10-11.) \n  13 The state appellate court commented, \nPhotographic evidence reveals areas within the Gar-\ndens that are dilapidated. Additionally, there was tes-\ntimony  that  there  was  overcrowding  and  excessive \nland coverage because of the way the units were ar-\nranged in blocks in fee simple ownership. Accordingly, \na dilapidated home on one lot had a serious effect on \nhomes on either side of it. Excessive land coverage \n(Continued on following page) \n\n51a \n  In  short,  Plaintiffs  have  failed  to  show  an  im-\npermissible disparate impact. Even if they have made \nsuch a showing, they have failed to offer sufficient \nevidence to rebut the Township’s legitimate govern-\nmental purpose or demonstrate illegitimate discrimi-\nnatory  intent.  Therefore,  plaintiffs  have  not \ndemonstrated that material disputed facts exist as to \ntheir  FHA  claim.  Accordingly,  summary  judgment \nmust be entered in favor of defendants on this claim.14 \n \n \nwas also evident where a majority of the rear yards \nwere paved or covered with gravel to accommodate \nadditional parking spaces. Finally, the alleyways cre-\nated a faulty arrangement or design for the Gardens \nbecause it increased the amount of crime in the area. \nThe dilapidated, overcrowded, poorly designed com-\nmunity, in addition to the high level of crime in the \narea, is clearly detrimental to the safety, health, mor-\nals and welfare of the community. \nCitizens In Action v. Township of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL 1930457, \n*13 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007). \n  14 Plaintiffs’ FHA claim was lodged against all defendants, \nincluding the construction company selected to undertake the \nredevelopment, Keating Urban Partners, LLC, and the company \nhired  by  Keating  to  conduct  the  relocation  activities,  Triad \nAssociates,  Inc.  In  their  previous  motion  to  dismiss,  Triad \nargued, and Keating joined in that argument, that it cannot be \nheld liable under the FHA because it had no part in the drafting \nand  adoption  of  the  Township’s  redevelopment  plan,  and  its \nactions with regard to the relocation activities do not fall within \nthe province of the FHA-protected conduct. Because the Court \nhas  found  no  FHA  violation,  Triad’s  argument  will  not  be \nconsidered. \n\n52a \n2.  Counts Two, Three, Five-Civil Rights Act \nand State and Federal Equal Protection \nClause \n  Plaintiffs claim that the Township violated the \nCivil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982, the Equal \nProtection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, brought \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause of the New Jersey State Constitution. In \norder to prove such claims, plaintiffs must show that \nthey were the target of intentional, purposeful dis-\ncrimination by the Township. City of Cuyahoga Falls, \nOhio  v.  Buckeye  Community  Hope  Foundation,  538 \nU.S.  188,  194  (2003)  (citation  omitted)  (“‘Proof  of \nracially discriminatory intent or purpose is required’ \nto show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.”); \nBradley  v.  U.S.,  299  F.3d  197,  205  (3d  Cir.  2002) \n(stating that in order to establish a claim under the \nEqual Protection Clause, a  plaintiff needs to prove \nthat the actions (1) had a discriminatory effect and \n(2)  were  motivated  by  a  discriminatory  purpose); \nBrown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. \n2001) (citations and quotations omitted) (“In order to \nbring an action under § 1982, a plaintiff must allege \nwith  specificity  facts  sufficient  to  show  or  raise  a \nplausible inference of (1) the defendant’s racial ani-\nmus; (2) intentional discrimination; and (3) that the \ndefendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of \nrace.”); Greenberg v. Kimmelman, 494 A.2d 294, 308 \n(N.J. 1985) (stating that if a law is facially neutral, \n“an equal protection claim could succeed only if the \nstatute had an invidious purpose”). \n\n53a \n  Plaintiffs claim that through the redevelopment \nplan the Township is intentionally seeking to deprive \nplaintiffs and other African-Americans and Hispanics \nof the right to property and equal protection under \nthe law. In the Court’s prior Opinion denying plain-\ntiffs’  request  for  preliminary  injunction,  the  Court \nfound  that  plaintiffs  did  not  demonstrate  that  the \nTownship  “implemented  the  development  plan  to \nintentionally  or  effectively  drive  out  the  minority \npopulation of Mt. Holly.” (Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 7.) Thus, \nas with their FHA claim, the Township’s motion to \ndismiss these claims was converted to one for sum-\nmary judgment, and the Court afforded plaintiffs the \nopportunity  to  provide  other  proof  to  support  their \nclaims of intentional discrimination. \n  In their response, plaintiffs have failed to provide \nsuch proof. As discussed above, plaintiffs first argue \nthat summary judgment is premature, because their \nability  to  prove  these  intentional  discrimination \nclaims is thwarted by the lack of discovery – namely, \nthe  depositions  of  Township  officials.  As  also  dis-\ncussed above, however, even if such depositions were \npermitted,  the  Court  doubts  that  any  Township \nofficial will testify to his or her “discriminatory pur-\npose” in approving the redevelopment plan. See, e.g., \nSmith v. Town of Clarkton, N.C., 682 F.2d 1055, 1064-\n65 (4th Cir. 1982) (in an FHA case, stating, “Munici-\npal officials acting in their official capacities seldom, \nif ever, announce on the record that they are pursuing \na particular course of action because of their desire to \ndiscriminate against a racial minority. Even individuals \n\n54a \nacting  from  invidious  motivations  realize  the  unat-\ntractiveness of their prejudices when faced with their \nperpetuation in the public record. It is only in private \nconversation, with individuals assumed to share their \nbigotry,  that  open  statements  of  discrimination  are \nmade,  so  it  is  rare  that  these  statements  can  be \ncaptured for purposes of proving racial discrimination \nin a case such as this.”). \n  With  regard  to  other  methods  for  proving  dis-\ncriminatory  intent,  plaintiffs  have  had  years  to \ngather such proof, including obtaining affidavits from \nGardens  residents  or  other  people  who  have  been \ninvolved  in  the  Gardens  redevelopment  process. \nInstead, plaintiffs’ brief details the Township’s alleged \ndiscriminatory  actions,  but  none  of  the  claims  are \nsupported  by  any  documentary  or  other  evidence.15 \n \n  15 Several affidavits by plaintiffs were submitted in support \nof their motion for preliminary injunction. In their brief, plain-\ntiffs specifically refer to one of them by Santos Cruz to support \nthe claim that the Township’s redevelopment activities lowered \nthe property values of the remaining homes, and the Township \ntook advantage of that situation by pressuring residents to sell \ntheir homes at deflated prices that did not represent fair market \nvalue. (Pl. Opp. at 31.) This conclusion is based on Mr. Cruz’s \n“belief.” (Cruz Cert., Docket No. 17-9 (“I believe the houses are \nworth much more than the Township is offering.”) The other \naffidavits by plaintiffs in the record contain similar statements \nas to their “beliefs” and “feelings.” See Ancho Cert., Docket No. \n17-7, ¶ 18, “I believe that my home is worth much more than \nthat [$39,000 to $42,000 offered to others] because we invested a \ngreat amount of money to make it comfortable for our retire-\nment”);  Simons  Cert.,  Docket  No.  17-10,  ¶ 14,  “I  believe  my \nhouse is worth a great deal more than what the Township is \n(Continued on following page) \n\n55a \nRather, plaintiffs tell a story, long on accusations and \nsuppositions but short on proof, of the Township’s ten-\nyear, insidious desire to displace the minority popula-\ntion of Mt. Holly. If there were merit to these claims, \nplaintiffs would be able to annotate their allegations \nwith factual evidence that would infer such discrimi-\nnatory motive.16 They have not done so. See Village of \n \noffering me,” because it has three bedrooms, a large lot, and it \nhas undergone “costly upgrades.”) These affidavits are insuffi-\ncient to defeat a summary judgment motion. Celotex, 477 U.S. at \n332  (“[C]onclusory,  self-serving  affidavits  are  insufficient  to \nwithstand a motion for summary judgment. Instead, the affiant \nmust  set  forth  specific  facts  that  reveal  a  genuine  issue  of \nmaterial fact.”). \n  Incidentally, these affidavits relate the plaintiffs’ extensive \nparticipation in numerous meetings with the Township and the \nbuilders over the years. \n  16 For example, plaintiffs state that “the Township failed to \nprovide  adequate  compensation  and  relocation  assistance  to \nenable residents to purchase a replacement house in the Town-\nship or surrounding region.” (Pl. Opp. at 38.) In the Court’s prior \nOpinion, however, the Court noted, “The evidence on the record \nshows  that  other  Garden  residents  whose  homes  have  been \nacquired by the Township and have been relocated are pleased \nwith both their compensation and place of relocation. In fact, the \nevidence demonstrates that many residents now have signifi-\ncantly improved living conditions and are in better circumstanc-\nes  financially.  Additionally,  the  defendants  represent,  and \nplaintiffs do not dispute, that none of the people who have been \nrelocated and wanted to remain in Mt. Holly were unable to.” \n(Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 12 n.5.) Moreover, it is an undisputed fact \nthat  New  Jersey  statute  only  requires  the  Township  to  pay \n$4,000 in relocation benefits to tenants, and $15,000 in reloca-\ntion benefits to homeowners, but the Township has paid $7,500 \nto tenants and $35,000 to homeowners. (See Def. Statement of \nFacts, ¶ 23, at 31.) \n\n56a \nArlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop-\nment Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266-67 (1977) (explaining \nthat  the  determination  as  to  “whether  invidious \ndiscriminatory  purpose  was  a  motivating  factor \ndemands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial \nand direct evidence of intent as may be available,” \nand identifying objective factors that may be proba-\ntive  of  racially  discriminatory  intent:  (1)  the  racial \nimpact of an official action; (2) the historical back-\nground  of  the  decision;  (3)  the  sequence  of  events \nleading  up  to  the  challenged  decision,  including \ndepartures from normal procedures and usual sub-\nstantive norms; and (4) the legislative or administra-\ntive history of the decision). \n  In contrast, the Township provides transcripts of \ntown  council  and  planning  board  meetings,  where \nconcerned citizens and council members discussed the \nplans for the Gardens. The Township has also provid-\ned letters and affidavits from former Gardens resi-\ndents,  as  well  as  certifications  from  individuals \ninvolved  with  the  redevelopment  plan  implementa-\ntion and relocation process. These documents range \nin date from 2002 through early 2010. The documents \nshow  that  from  the  very  beginning,  the  planning \nboard was aware of the sensitive issues that would \narise  as  they  undertook  the  process,  the  desire  to \nhave direct communication with Gardens’ residents, \nand  the  Township’s  consideration  of  the  residents’ \nconcerns. (See, e.g., Sept. 8, 2003 Town Council meet-\ning transcript at 36-44, Def Ex. B.) Although many \nviewpoints were expressed by the Gardens’ residents \n\n57a \nand community activists, with some being supportive \nand  hopeful,  while  other  disenfranchised  residents \nspeaking emphatically and eloquently on their nega-\ntive opinion on the redevelopment plan, their input \nwas welcomed and encouraged.17 \n  Furthermore, nowhere in plaintiffs’ recitation of \nthe  Township’s  motives  do  plaintiffs  specifically \nacknowledge the extensive deterioration, crime, and \noverall  unsafe  living  conditions  the  Township  was \nendeavoring to cure. Although plaintiffs feel that the \nTownship simply wishes to remove all minorities from \nthe town, evidence in the record supports an opposing \nviewpoint – that but-for the significant concern for \nthe  Gardens’  resident’s  welfare,  and  the  desire  to \nmake the Township as a whole a safe and pleasant \ntown for all of its citizens, minority and non-minority, \n \n  17 Plaintiffs refer to the Township’s “secret,” off-the-record \nmeetings among Township officials and the redevelopers where \ndecisions were made without input from the community, and \nwhere  they  presume  the  true  discriminatory  intent  of  the \nTownship was revealed. Although “New Jersey has a strong, \nexpressed public policy in favor of open government, as evi-\ndenced by our Open Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 to -21,” \nTimes  of  Trenton  Pub.  Corp.  v.  Lafayette  Yard  Community \nDevelopment Corp., 874 A.2d 1064, 1070 (N.J. 2005) (citation \nomitted), the OPMA sets forth specific instances where closed-\ndoor sessions are appropriate, see N.J.S.A. 10:4-12, -13. It is \nunclear  whether  these  alleged “secret”  meetings  met  the  re-\nquirements of New Jersey’s OPMA. The Township’s compliance \nwith OPMA is not before the Court, however, and plaintiffs’ \nallegations concerning these meetings as evidence of discrimina-\ntory intent are speculative, and, therefore, of insufficient weight \nto defeat summary judgment. \n\n58a \nthe Township would have never undertaken the long-\noverdue  project,  particularly  considering  the  chal-\nlenges  that  the  redevelopment  would,  and  did,  in-\nspire.18 Additionally, as noted above and previously, \nevidence  in  the  record  shows  that  many  relocated \nresidents have been pleased with the process, and are \nnow in a much better place as a result. \n  It  also  cannot  be  forgotten  that  the  redevelop-\nment  plan  has  gone  through  three  machinations, \nfrom  the  Gardens  Area  Redevelopment  Plan \n(“GARP”) in 2003, to the West Rancocas Redevelop-\nment Plan (“WRRP”) in 2005, and then to the Revised \nWest  Rancocas  Redevelopment  Plan  in  September \n2008. For each of these plans, the Township Council \nand  the  builder  heard  extensive  public  comment, \ntestimony,  and  written  objections  (as  intricately \ndetailed in plaintiffs’ complaint), and even though the \n2005  WRRP  was  approved  by  the  New  Jersey  De-\npartment of Community Affairs and affirmed by the \nNew  Jersey  state  trial  and  appellate  courts,  the \nTownship and redevelopers conducted a reevaluation \nof the plan which resulted in the 2008 Revised WRRP. \nDespite  plaintiffs’  claims  that  all  the  plans  were \nadopted  without  meaningful  consideration  of  the \nresidents’ objections, it seems specious to believe that \n \n  18 It  seems  that  plaintiffs  could  not  dispute  the  ironic \nobservation that if the Township had allowed the Gardens to \ncontinue to deteriorate as it had over the years, that it might \nthen be fairly characterized as having a discriminatory intent \ntoward its minority, low-income residents. \n\n59a \nthe Township extensively reevaluated and revised its \nplans while entertaining numerous opportunities for \npublic  comment  and  objection  simply  as  a  ruse  to \nmask its ultimate purpose of “ridding” Mt. Holly of its \nminority population. \n  The Court acknowledges that for every govern-\nmental  action,  people  will  object,  for  personal  rea-\nsons, or as a champion for those who cannot speak \nout for themselves. The Court also acknowledges that \ngoverning officials are often not the most efficient or \npragmatic  in  their  decision-making  process.  When \npeople’s homes are at stake, and when issues concern-\ning race and economic status are involved, the emo-\ntions of everyone are amplified. This is evidenced not \nonly by the 10-year litigation concerning the Gardens’ \nredevelopment, but by the voices of the residents who \nhave  expressed  the  extremes  of  satisfaction  and \ndispleasure with the plan. In addition to the people \nwho feel benefitted by the Township, it is undisputa-\nble that people have felt unjustifiably wronged by the \nTownship, which has had to make some hard deci-\nsions along the way. \n  The Court, however, must view the case under \nthe  legal  framework  that  constrains  this  Court’s \nconsideration of these issues, rather than under the \nemotional contours of the situation. At this summary \njudgment stage in the context of what proof has been \nprovided, and in deciding what material issues of fact \nneed to be resolved, the weight of the record evidence \ndemonstrates that no reasonable juror could find that \nthe Township acted with intentional discrimination in \n\n60a \nthe development and implementation of the Gardens’ \nredevelopment plan. Moreover, no additional discov-\nery  appears  calculated  or  even  remotely  likely  to \nprovide the missing proofs. Consequently, summary \njudgment must be entered in favor of the Township \non plaintiffs’ intentional discrimination claims. \n \n3.  Punitive damage claims \n  Plaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages for \nall of their claims. The Township had moved to dis-\nmiss plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages, arguing \nthat under various legal principles, punitive damages \ncannot  be  imposed  against  a  municipality.  In  the \nCourt’s  previous  Opinion,  all  of  plaintiffs’  punitive \ndamages  requests  were  dismissed,  except  for  those \nrelating to plaintiffs’ FHA and Civil Rights Act claims \n(Counts One and Two). The Court reserved decision \non  these  two  claims  pending  consideration  of  the \nconverted motions. \n  Even though “punitive damages can be awarded \nin a civil rights case where a jury finds a constitu-\ntional violation, even when the jury has not awarded \ncompensatory  or  nominal  damages,”  Alexander  v. \nRiga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Curtis v. \nLoether, 415 U.S. 189 (1974)) (both discussing FHA \nclaims), a finding of a violation is a mandatory pre-\nrequisite  to  any  possibility  of  punitive  damages. \nBecause  the  Court  has  not  found  defendants  to  be \n\n61a \nliable  for  plaintiffs’  FHA  and  civil  rights  claims, \nplaintiffs’ punitive damages claims fail as well.19 \n \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  expressed  above,  defendants’ \nconverted  motions  for  summary  judgment  shall  be \ngranted  on  the  four  remaining  claims  in  plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint. An appropriate Order will be entered. \nDate: January 3, 2011  /s/ Noel L. Hillman\nNOEL L. HILLMAN, \nAt Camden, New Jersey    U.S.D.J. \n \n \n  19 For punitive damages, plaintiffs would also need to prove \nthat  defendants’  “‘conduct  is  shown  to  be  motivated  by  evil \nmotive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indiffer-\nence to the federally protected rights of others.’” Alexander v. \nRiga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting Smith v. Wade, \n461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)).

Conditions within delineated \narea establishing need for redevelopment \nEffective: July 9, 2003  \nA delineated area may be determined to be in need \nof  redevelopment  if,  after  investigation,  notice  and \nhearing  as  provided  in  section  6  of  P.L.1992,  c.  79 \n(C.40A:12A-6), the governing body of the municipality \nby  resolution  concludes  that  within  the  delineated \narea any of the following conditions is found: \na.  The generality of buildings are substandard, un-\nsafe, unsanitary, dilapidated, or obsolescent, or pos-\nsess any of such characteristics, or are so lacking in \nlight, air, or space, as to be conducive to unwholesome \nliving or working conditions. \nb.  The discontinuance of the use of buildings previ-\nously used for commercial, manufacturing, or indus-\ntrial purposes; the abandonment of such buildings; or \nthe same being allowed to fall into so great a state of \ndisrepair as to be untenantable. \nc.  Land that is owned by the municipality, the county, \na  local  housing  authority,  redevelopment  agency  or \nredevelopment  entity,  or  unimproved  vacant  land \nthat has remained so for a period of ten years prior to \nadoption of the resolution, and that by reason of its \nlocation, remoteness, lack of means of access to de-\nveloped  sections  or  portions  of  the  municipality,  or \ntopography, or nature of the soil, is not likely to be \n\n66a \ndeveloped through the instrumentality of private cap-\nital. \nd.  Areas with buildings or improvements which, by \nreason  of  dilapidation,  obsolescence,  overcrowding, \nfaulty  arrangement  or  design,  lack  of  ventilation, \nlight and sanitary facilities, excessive land coverage, \ndeleterious land use or obsolete layout, or any com-\nbination of these or other factors, are detrimental to \nthe safety, health, morals, or welfare of the commun-\nity. \ne.  A growing lack or total lack of proper utilization \nof areas caused by the condition of the title, diverse \nownership of the real property therein or other condi-\ntions, resulting in a stagnant or not fully productive \ncondition of land potentially useful and valuable for \ncontributing to and serving the public health, safety \nand welfare. \nf.  Areas, in excess of five contiguous acres, whereon \nbuildings or improvements have been destroyed, con-\nsumed by fire, demolished or altered by the action \nof storm, fire, cyclone, tornado, earthquake or other \ncasualty in such a way that the aggregate assessed \nvalue of the area has been materially depreciated. \ng.  In any municipality in which an enterprise zone \nhas been designated pursuant to the “New Jersey Ur-\nban Enterprise Zones Act,” P.L.1983, c. 303 (C.52:27H-\n60 et seq.) the execution of the actions prescribed in \nthat  act  for  the  adoption  by  the  municipality  and \napproval by the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zone \nAuthority of the zone development plan for the area \n\n67a \nof the enterprise zone shall be considered sufficient \nfor the determination that the area is in need of re-\ndevelopment pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of P.L.1992, \nc. 79 (C.40A:12A-5 and 40A:12A-6) for the purpose of \ngranting tax exemptions within the enterprise zone \ndistrict pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c. 431 \n(C.40A:20-1 et seq.) or the adoption of a tax abate-\nment and exemption ordinance pursuant to the pro-\nvisions of P.L.1991, c. 441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.). The \nmunicipality  shall  not  utilize  any  other  redevelop-\nment powers within the urban enterprise zone unless \nthe  municipal  governing  body  and  planning  board \nhave also taken the actions and fulfilled the require-\nments prescribed in P.L.1992, c. 79 (C.40A:12A-1 et \nal.) for determining that the area is in need of rede-\nvelopment or an area in need of rehabilitation and \nthe municipal governing body has adopted a redevel-\nopment  plan  ordinance  including  the  area  of  the \nenterprise zone. \nh.  The designation of the delineated area is consis-\ntent with smart growth planning principles adopted \npursuant to law or regulation. \n \n   \n\n68a \nN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-6. Preliminary investigation \nby planning board; notice; hearing; determination \nof redevelopment area; review; redevelopment \narea deemed blighted area \nEffective: July 9, 2003  \na.  No area of a municipality shall be determined a \nredevelopment area unless the governing body of the \nmunicipality shall, by resolution, authorize the plan-\nning board to undertake a preliminary investigation \nto determine whether the proposed area is a redevel-\nopment  area  according  to  the  criteria  set  forth  in \nsection 5 of P.L.1992, c. 79 (C.40A:12A-5). Such de-\ntermination  shall  be  made  after  public  notice  and \npublic  hearing  as  provided  in  subsection  b.  of  this \nsection. The governing body of a municipality shall \nassign the conduct of the investigation and hearing to \nthe planning board of the municipality. \na. (1)  Before proceeding to a public hearing on the \nmatter,  the  planning  board  shall  prepare  a  map \nshowing  the  boundaries  of  the  proposed  redevelop-\nment area and the location of the various parcels of \nproperty included therein. There shall be appended to \nthe map a statement setting forth the basis for the \ninvestigation. \n(2)  The planning board shall specify a date for and \ngive notice of a hearing for the purpose of hearing \npersons who are interested in or would be affected by \na determination that the delineated area is a redevel-\nopment area. \n\n69a \n(3)  The  hearing  notice  shall  set  forth  the  general \nboundaries of the area to be investigated and state \nthat a map has been prepared and can be inspected at \nthe office of the municipal clerk. A copy of the notice \nshall be published in a newspaper of general circula-\ntion  in  the  municipality  once  each  week  for  two \nconsecutive weeks, and the last publication shall be \nnot less than ten days prior to the date set for the \nhearing. A copy of the notice shall be mailed at least \nten days prior to the date set for the hearing to the \nlast owner, if any, of each parcel of property within \nthe area according to the assessment records of the \nmunicipality. A notice shall also be sent to all persons \nat their last known address, if any, whose names are \nnoted on the assessment records as claimants of an \ninterest in any such parcel. The assessor of the mu-\nnicipality  shall  make  a  notation  upon  the  records \nwhen requested to do so by any person claiming to \nhave an interest in any parcel of property in the mu-\nnicipality. The notice shall be published and mailed \nby the municipal clerk, or by such clerk or official as \nthe planning board shall otherwise designate. Failure \nto mail any such notice shall not invalidate the inves-\ntigation or determination thereon. \n(4)  At  the  hearing,  which  may  be  adjourned  from \ntime to time, the planning board shall hear all per-\nsons who are interested in or would be affected by a \ndetermination that the delineated area is a redevel-\nopment area. All objections to such a determination \nand  evidence  in  support  of  those  objections,  given \n\n70a \norally or in writing, shall be received and considered \nand made part of the public record. \n(5)  After completing its hearing on this matter, the \nplanning board shall recommend that the delineated \narea, or any part thereof, be determined, or not be \ndetermined, by the municipal governing body to be a \nredevelopment area. After receiving the recommenda-\ntion of the planning board, the municipal governing \nbody  may  adopt  a  resolution  determining  that  the \ndelineated area, or any part thereof, is a redevelop-\nment  area.  Upon  the  adoption  of  a  resolution,  the \nclerk of the municipality shall, forthwith, transmit a \ncopy of the resolution to the Commissioner of Com-\nmunity  Affairs  for  review.  If  the  area  in  need  of \nredevelopment  is  not  situated  in  an  area  in  which \ndevelopment  or  redevelopment  is  to  be  encouraged \npursuant to any State law or regulation promulgated \npursuant  thereto,  the  determination  shall  not  take \neffect without first receiving the review and the ap-\nproval of the commissioner. If the commissioner does \nnot issue an approval or disapproval within 30 calen-\ndar days of transmittal by the clerk, the determina-\ntion  shall  be  deemed  to  be  approved.  If  the  area \nin need of redevelopment is situated in an area in \nwhich development or redevelopment is to be encour-\naged pursuant to any State law or regulation promul-\ngated pursuant thereto, then the determination shall \ntake  effect  after  the  clerk  has  transmitted  a  copy \nof the resolution to the commissioner. The determi- \nnation, if supported by substantial evidence and, if \nrequired,  approved  by  the  commissioner,  shall  be \n\n71a \nbinding  and  conclusive  upon  all  persons  affected \nby  the  determination.  Notice  of  the  determination \nshall be served, within 10 days after the determina-\ntion, upon each person who filed a written objection \nthereto and stated, in or upon the written submis-\nsion, an address to which notice of determination may \nbe sent. \n(6)  If  written  objections  were  filed  in  connection \nwith the hearing, the municipality shall, for 45 days \nnext following its determination to which the objec-\ntions were filed, take no further action to acquire any \nproperty by condemnation within the redevelopment \narea. \n(7)  If  a  person  who  filed  a  written  objection  to  a \ndetermination by the municipality pursuant to this \nsubsection shall, within 45 days after the adoption by \nthe municipality of the determination to which the \nperson  objected,  apply  to  the  Superior  Court,  the \ncourt may grant further review of the determination \nby procedure in lieu of prerogative writ; and in any \nsuch action the court may make any incidental order \nthat it deems proper. \nc.  An area determined to be in need of redevelop-\nment pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a \n“blighted area” for the purposes of Article VIII, Sec-\ntion III, paragraph 1 of the Constitution. If an area is \ndetermined to be a redevelopment area and a rede-\nvelopment plan is adopted for that area in accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  this  act,  the  municipality  is \n\n72a \nauthorized  to  utilize  all  those  powers  provided  in \nsection 8 of P.L.1992, c. 79 (C.40A:12A-8). \nN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-7.

No redevelopment project shall be undertaken or \ncarried  out  except  in  accordance  with  a  redevelop-\nment  plan  adopted  by  ordinance  of  the  municipal \ngoverning body, upon its finding that the specifically \ndelineated project area is located in an area in need of \nredevelopment or in an area in need of rehabilitation, \nor in both, according to criteria set forth in section 5 \nor  section  14  of  P.L.1992,  c.  79  (C.40A:12A-5  or \n40A:12A-14), as appropriate. \nThe redevelopment plan shall include an outline for \nthe planning, development, redevelopment, or reha-\nbilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate: \n(1)  Its relationship to definite local objectives as to \nappropriate  land  uses,  density  of  population,  and \nimproved  traffic  and  public  transportation,  public \nutilities,  recreational  and  community  facilities  and \nother public improvements. \n(2)  Proposed land uses and building requirements in \nthe project area. \n\n73a \n(3)  Adequate provision for the temporary and per-\nmanent relocation, as necessary, of residents in the \nproject area, including an estimate of the extent to \nwhich  decent,  safe  and  sanitary  dwelling  units  af-\nfordable  to  displaced  residents  will  be  available  to \nthem in the existing local housing market. \n(4)  An identification of any property within the re-\ndevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in \naccordance with the redevelopment plan. \n(5)  Any  significant  relationship  of  the  redevelop-\nment  plan  to  (a)  the  master  plans  of  contiguous \nmunicipalities, (b) the master plan of the county in \nwhich the municipality is located, and (c) the State \nDevelopment  and  Redevelopment  Plan  adopted \npursuant to the “State Planning Act,” P.L.1985, c. 398 \n(C.52:18A-196 et al.). \n(6)  As of the date of the adoption of the resolution \nfinding the area to be in need of redevelopment, an \ninventory of all housing units affordable to low and \nmoderate income households, as defined pursuant to \nsection 4 of P.L.1985, c. 222 (C.52:27D-304), that are \nto be removed as a result of implementation of the \nredevelopment plan, whether as a result of subsidies \nor  market  conditions,  listed  by  affordability  level, \nnumber of bedrooms, and tenure. \n(7)  A  plan  for  the  provision,  through  new  con-\nstruction or substantial rehabilitation of one compa-\nrable, affordable replacement housing unit for each \naffordable  housing  unit  that  has  been  occupied  at \nany time within the last 18 months, that is subject \n\n74a \nto affordability controls and that is identified as to be \nremoved as a result of implementation of the redevel-\nopment  plan.  Displaced  residents  of  housing  units \nprovided  under  any  State  or  federal  housing  sub- \nsidy program, or pursuant to the “Fair Housing Act,” \nP.L.1985, c. 222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), provided they \nare deemed to be eligible, shall have first priority for \nthose  replacement  units  provided  under  the  plan; \nprovided that any such replacement unit shall not be \ncredited  against  a  prospective  municipal  obligation \nunder  the  “Fair  Housing  Act,”  P.L.1985,  c.  222 \n(C.52:27D-301  et  al.),  if  the  housing  unit  which  is \nremoved had previously been credited toward satisfy-\ning the municipal fair share obligation. To the extent \nreasonably  feasible,  replacement  housing  shall  be \nprovided within or in close proximity to the redevel-\nopment area. A municipality shall report annually to \nthe Department of Community Affairs on its progress \nin implementing the plan for provision of comparable, \naffordable replacement housing required pursuant to \nthis section. \nb.  A redevelopment plan may include the provision \nof  affordable  housing  in  accordance  with  the  “Fair \nHousing Act,” P.L.1985, c. 222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) \nand  the  housing  element  of  the  municipal  master \nplan. \nc.  The  redevelopment  plan  shall  describe  its  rela-\ntionship to pertinent municipal development regula-\ntions as defined in the “Municipal Land Use Law,” \nP.L.1975, c. 291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.). The redevelop-\nment  plan  shall  supersede  applicable  provisions  of \n\n75a \nthe  development  regulations  of  the  municipality  or \nconstitute  an  overlay  zoning  district  within  the \nredevelopment  area.  When  the  redevelopment  plan \nsupersedes any provision of the development regula-\ntions, the ordinance adopting the redevelopment plan \nshall  contain  an  explicit  amendment  to  the  zoning \ndistrict map included in the zoning ordinance. The \nzoning  district  map  as  amended  shall  indicate  the \nredevelopment area to which the redevelopment plan \napplies. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Mu-\nnicipal Land Use Law,” P.L.1975, c. 291 (C.40:55D-1 \net seq.) or of other law, no notice beyond that required \nfor adoption of ordinances by the municipality shall \nbe required for the hearing on or adoption of the re-\ndevelopment plan or subsequent amendments there-\nof. \nd.  All provisions of the redevelopment plan shall be \neither  substantially  consistent  with  the  municipal \nmaster  plan  or  designed  to  effectuate  the  master \nplan; but the municipal governing body may adopt a \nredevelopment plan which is inconsistent with or not \ndesigned to effectuate the master plan by affirmative \nvote of a majority of its full authorized membership \nwith the reasons for so acting set forth in the redevel-\nopment plan. \ne.  Prior to the adoption of a redevelopment plan, or \nrevision or amendment thereto, the planning board \nshall transmit to the governing body, within 45 days \nafter referral, a report containing its recommendation \nconcerning the redevelopment plan. This report shall \ninclude  an  identification  of  any  provisions  in  the \n\n76a \nproposed redevelopment plan which are inconsistent \nwith the master plan and recommendations concern-\ning these inconsistencies and any other matters as \nthe  board  deems  appropriate.  The  governing  body, \nwhen  considering  the  adoption  of  a  redevelopment \nplan or revision or amendment thereof, shall review \nthe report of the planning board and may approve or \ndisapprove or change any recommendation by a vote \nof a majority of its full authorized membership and \nshall record in its minutes the reasons for not follow-\ning  the  recommendations.  Failure  of  the  planning \nboard to transmit its report within the required 45 \ndays  shall  relieve  the  governing  body  from  the  re-\nquirements of this subsection with regard to the per-\ntinent  proposed  redevelopment  plan  or  revision  or \namendment thereof. Nothing in this subsection shall \ndiminish the applicability of the provisions of subsec-\ntion d. of this section with respect to any redevelop-\nment plan or revision or amendment thereof. \nf.  The governing body of a municipality may direct \nthe planning board to prepare a redevelopment plan \nor an amendment or revision to a redevelopment plan \nfor a designated redevelopment area. After complet-\ning the redevelopment plan, the planning board shall \ntransmit the proposed plan to the governing body for \nits adoption. The governing body, when considering \nthe proposed plan, may amend or revise any portion \nof the proposed redevelopment plan by an affirmative \nvote of the majority of its full authorized membership \nand shall record in its minutes the reasons for each \namendment or revision. When a redevelopment plan \n\n77a \nor amendment to a redevelopment plan is referred to \nthe governing body by the planning board under this \nsubsection, the governing body shall be relieved of the \nreferral requirements of subsection e. of this section. \n \n\n78a \nAPPENDIX G \n[Nonrelevant Data Omitted] \nTable DP-1.

Certain repairs are needed to \nrestore and maintain the current Gardens Homes in safe and fully habitable conditions during this \nperiod. Plaintiffs have provided to defendants a list of conditions requiring repair, contained in \nExhibit I. The Township has agreed to make these repairs in accordance with the timetable set forth \nin Exhibit I. \n7 .2.  The Parties further recognize that it is in the interest of all parties to make the \ncommunity more livable Jor Plaintiff.'> during this time period and to increase the desirability and \nmarketability of the Township's redevelopment.  The Township agrees to make available several \nplots of land in the Gardens neighborhood no later than April I, 2014 for use by Plaintiffs to make \ncommunity gardens.  Specifically, the Plaintiffs may use Township land within a fifty yard radius of \nthe intersecti011 of Grant Street and Levis Drive and Township land on .Joseph Place.

Contingency-Based on Changes in Circumstances of Plaintiffs \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 11/15/13   Page 24 of 98 PageID: 6453\nSETTLEMENT AGRI~I~MENT RESOLVING \nLITIGATION IN nm MATfER OF MT.

The Patties recognize that in order to \nadequately plan for and apply for funding for replacement housing and other aspects of the \nresolution plan, the Township has required, and Individual Plaintiffs have agreed, that each \nIndividual Plaintiff designate at the time of the signing ofthis Settlement Agreement whether the \nIndividual Plaintiff seeks a financial resolution payment package or a Replacement Home. \nHowever, because it will take a period oftime for the Township and redevelopers to plan, develop, \nand construct the replacement housing, some Replacement Group Plaintiffs may experience \nchanges in circumstances such as death, medical illness making independent living impracticable, \nor other factors that make continuing to wait for a replacement housing or moving into the \nreplacement unit impracticable, unfeasible, or inconvenient.  Such Replacement Group Plaintiffs \nmay exercise an option of selling their Gardens Home to the Township as provided below. \n8.2  Notice to Township. If a Replacement Group Plaintifl: representative, or heir, must \nsell the Gardens Home pursuant to 8.1, such person will give written notice to the Township of their \nintent to sell at least 90 days prior to an anticipated closing date. \n8.3  Township Obligation to Purchase Gardens Home. The Township shall purchase the \nGardens Homes fi·om Replacement Group PlaintitTs pursuant to the procedures and conditions set \nfotth in Section 3 above, except that the price shall be determined as follows: 140% of the \nTownship's 2010 appraised value or $60,000, whichever is greater. Under this contingency, no \nrelocation benefits shall be pt·ovided. A specific chart of these plaintiffs' appraised values is \nattached hereto as Exhibit J. \n8.4  Release of Claims. Upon such payment, the parties shall mutually release each other \nof all claims and the Township shall be H·ee of any further responsibility fot· provision of temporary \nor pet·manent replacement housing. \n9  Contingency-If Replacement Homes Are Not Provided Within Time Specified in \nAgreement Appr·oval/ Development/Grant Delays \n9.1  Basis for Provision ofContingencies. The parties recognize that there may be delays \nnot anticipated at the time of signing ofthis Agreement in the process of the overall development. \nBecause Replacement Group Plaintiffs have at the time of this Settlement Agreement chosen to \naccept a Replacement Home in Ii eu of other options that may have been available to them, the \nparties recognize it is necessary to provide a process in the event that the development does not \nproceed on the anticipated schedule. \n9.2  Anticipated Deadlines and Township's Options If Deadlines Not Met. The Township \nhas agreed to provide Replacement Homes to all Replacement Group Plaintiffs in accordance with \nthe following schedule: Phase I no later than December 3 I, 2014, Phase II no later than December \n31,2016, and Phase Ill no later than December 31,2018.  If the Replacement Homes are not being \nconstructed according to schedule, the Township shall have the right to terminate the Additional \nRedeveloper Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in that Agreement. \n\nCase 1:08-cv-02584-NLH-JS   Document 215-1   Filed 11/15/13   Page 25 of 98 PageID: 6454\nSETTLEMENT AGREEMENT RI~SOLVING \nLITIGATION IN THE MATTER OF MT.J-IOLLY GARDENS \n·CITIZENS IN ACTION, INC., ET AL V.

Continuing to wait for a replacement home; or \nOption 2. Selling their Gardens Home or Temporary Replacement House after exercising the \noption to take title in Section 5.4 to the Township at a price of$150,000 in accordance with \nthe procedures in Section 3. \n10. Execution of this Agreement and Dismissal of Litigation \n10. I  Effectuation of Settlement Agreement.

The Township agrees to take all \nof \nsteps necessary to obtain the dismissal  the pending petition for certiorari.  The Parties agree that \nthe dismissal of the pending petition tor certiorari is an essential condition for this Settlement \nAgreement to take effect.

The New Jersey Superior Court Law Division dismissed the claims \nagainst the redevelopment designation and the Redevelopment Plan with prejudice, finding that \nthe designation was supported by substantial, credible evidence and that the Township's adoption \nof the Redevelopment Plan was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  The Court further \ndismissed  the  civil  rights  claims  without  prejudice,  finding  that  the  designation  of  a \nredevelopment area and the adoption of a redevelopment plan do not violate the plaintiffs' civil \nrights.  There is no additional pending  or to the best of Township's knowledge  additional, \nthreatened litigation that would prevent Township from performing its duties and obligations \nhereunder. The Redeveloper is not a party to this or any related litigation and is hereby held \nharmless by the Township with respect to any claims arising from or related to the existing or any \nrelated litigation in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 .2.  The litigation is now the \nsubject  of a  settlement  agreement  (the  \"Settlement  Agreement\")  which  is  being  executed \ncontemporaneously with this Redevelopment Agreement. The terms of the Settlement Agreement \nthat are applicable to the Redeveloper are incorporated herein and made a part hereof. \nD.  The Township has utilized reasonable efforts to deliver to Redeveloper complete \ncopies of all documents and materials in the Township's possession of which it has knowledge \nrelating to the West Rancocas Redevelopment Area and to the development and proposed use \nthereof, including all documents relating to the physical and environmental conditions of such \nWest Rancocas Redevelopment Area. \nE.  The Township shall reasonably cooperate with the Redeveloper in order to enable \nthe Redeveloper to  carry  out its obligations and responsibilities under this Redevelopment \nAgreement. \nSECTION 2.3. Mutual Representations. \nA.  The  Township  and  Redeveloper  agree  that  the  Redevelopment  Project  will \nbe governed by the Redevelopment Agreement. \nB.  In  the  event  that  any  contractual  provisions  that  are  required  by  Legal \nRequirements  have  been  omitted,  then  the  Township  and  Redeveloper  agree  that  this \nRedevelopment Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate all such clauses by reference and such \nrequirements shall become a part of this Redevelopment Agreement. If such incorporation occurs \nand results in a change in the obligations or benefits of one of the parties, the Township and \nRedeveloper agree to act in good faith to mitigate such changes in position. \nARTICLE3 \nREDEVELOPER  COVENANTS;  DECLARATION  OF  COVENANTS \nAND RESTRICTIONS; TOWNSHIP COVENANTS \nSECTION  3.1  Redeveloper  Covenants.

This Court’s resolution \nof the question presented regarding the standards for establishing a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact will likely affect the Justice Department’s and HUD’s \nenforcement responsibilities under the FHA.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUE \n \nWhether the district court erred in concluding, on summary judgment, that \nplaintiffs failed to state a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination \nbecause they did not show that the challenged redevelopment would be \nunaffordable for “all or most” of the township’s minority households, and because \nthere were enough middle-income minority households in the county to \ntheoretically occupy all of the proposed higher-priced housing.1   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nPlaintiffs, residents of the Mount Holly Gardens neighborhood in Mount \nHolly, New Jersey, sued to stop the township’s redevelopment of their \nneighborhood.  R. 73 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 114 at 2, App. 5 (Jan. 3, \n                                                           \n1  The United States takes no position on the other issues presented in this \nappeal. \n \n \n\n  - 3 -   \n2011 Opinion).2  They alleged that the redevelopment, which would replace their \nhomes with higher-priced housing, would have a disparate impact on the mostly-\nminority residents and violate the Fair Housing Act.  Plaintiffs also brought claims \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1982, 42 U.S.C. 1983, and state law.  R. 114 at 3, App. 6 (Jan. 3, \n2011 Opinion).  They sought injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive \ndamages.  R. 73 at 52 (Second Amended Complaint).  In addition to the federal \ncase, there were several years of litigation in state courts.  R. 73 at 3 (Second \nAmended Complaint); R. 114 at 6-7, App. 9-10 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  The state \ncourts upheld the township’s designation of the Gardens neighborhood as blighted \nand “in need of redevelopment,” but those courts did not address the plaintiffs’ \nFair Housing Act claims.  See R. 73 at 3 (Second Amended Complaint). \nThe district court conducted several hearings over two years, denied a \ntemporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and issued several \nopinions.  R. 114 at 2. n.1, App. 5 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Parties were not \nallowed formal discovery.  R. 114 at 6, App. 9 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Finally, the \ndistrict court converted defendants’ motion to dismiss to a motion for summary \n                                                           \n2  “R. __” refers to documents filed in the district court, identified by docket \nnumber.  “App. __” refers to pages in the Appellants’ appendix, volume 1, attached \nto their opening brief.  Subsequent volumes of the appendix were not available to \namicus. \n \n\n  - 4 -   \njudgment, took supplemental briefing, and granted the motion.  R. 114 at 2-3, App. \n5-6 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nSTATEMENT OF THE FACTS \n1.  Facts And Procedural History \nThere were roughly 330 homes in the 30-acre Mount Holly Gardens \nneighborhood.  R. 17-3 at 8 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 2, 11 (Second Amended \nComplaint); R. 106-1 at 2 (Responding Statement of Facts).  About half the \nneighborhood’s residents were homeowners in 2000.  R. 73 at 13 (Second \nAmended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 6 (Responding Statement of Facts).  Almost all \nresidents have very low or extremely low incomes, defined as less than 50% or \n30% of the area median income, respectively.  R. 17-3 at 9 (Beveridge Decl.).  \nDefendants began purchasing homes as early as 2002, and by 2008 had already \npurchased, vacated, and boarded up more than 200 homes.  R. 73 at. 3, 24 (Second \nAmended Complaint).  They had demolished more than 70.  R. 17-3 at 8 \n(Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 25 (Second Amended Complaint).  \nRedevelopment would substantially increase housing costs in the \nneighborhood.  See R. 73 at 14, 34 (Second Amended Complaint).  Indeed, nearly \nall Gardens residents could not afford to purchase or rent market-rate homes in the \nredeveloped area.  R. 73 at 14 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 94 at 11 n.4 (Feb. \n13, 2009 Opinion); R. 106-1 at 42 (Responding Statement of Facts); R. 112 at 38-\n \n\n  - 5 -   \n40 (Def. Summ. J. Br.).  The township pays between $32,000 and $49,000 for each \nhome it buys in the Gardens.  R. 73 at 24 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 106-1 \nat 34 (Responding Statement of Facts).  Redevelopment plans call for 464 homes \nselling for between $200,000 and $275,000.  R. 73 at 34 (Second Amended \nComplaint); R. 106-1 at 41-42 (Responding Statement of Facts).  A one-bedroom \napartment will rent for more than $1200 per month.  R. 73 at 34 (Second Amended \nComplaint); R. 106-1 at 41-42 (Responding Statement of Facts).  There will also \nbe 56 deed-restricted, affordable units, but these will not be affordable for very low \nincome residents.  R. 73 at 34 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 114 at 12 n.7, \nApp. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nPlaintiffs presented expert evidence that the redevelopment in the Gardens \nwould greatly impact the minority population of Mount Holly.  R. 17-3 at 16 \n(Beveridge Decl.).  Mount Holly is 66% white, 21% African-American, and 9% \nHispanic.  R. 17-3 at 13 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 12 (Second Amended \nComplaint); R. 106-1 at 4 (Responding Statement of Facts).  It has a population of \nmore than 10,700.  R. 17-3 at 13 (Beveridge Decl.).  Burlington County is, overall, \n76% white, 15% African-American, and 4% Hispanic.  R. 17-3 at 13 (Beveridge \nDecl.); R. 73 at 12-13 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 3 (Responding \nStatement of Facts).  The population is very different, however, within the census \nblocks containing the Gardens neighborhood.  The population is 20% white, 46% \n \n\n  - 6 -   \nAfrican-American, and 29% Hispanic.  R. 17-3 at 14 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at \n12 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 4 (Responding Statement of Facts).  \nThe neighborhood accounts for 32% of Mount Holly’s entire Hispanic population \nand 21% of the township’s entire African-American population.  But only 3% of \nthe township’s white residents live there.  R. 106-1 at 5 (Responding Statement of \nFacts).  It contains the highest percentage of African-American and Hispanic \nresidents of any neighborhood in the township.  R. 73 at 12 (Second Amended \nComplaint); R. 106-1 at 5 (Responding Statement of Facts).  Seventy-five percent \nof the neighborhood’s residents are minorities.  R. 17-3 at 17 (Beveridge Decl.); R. \n102 at 8 (Oct. 23, 2009 Opinion).   \nAccordingly, plaintiffs argued that redevelopment that forces residents to \nleave the Gardens will disproportionately affect minority households.  R. 73 at 37 \n(Second Amended Complaint); R. 114 at 12 n.8, App. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  \nResidents are not only displaced from their neighborhood, but also will likely leave \nthe township – and perhaps Burlington County – altogether.  Plaintiffs showed that \nthere is a shortage of low-income housing in the township and its immediate \nsurroundings, suggesting they would likely not be able to find replacement housing \nthere.  R. 17-3 at 18-19 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 36 (Second Amended \nComplaint).  It appears residents who have left the Gardens most often move \noutside Mount Holly.  R. 17-32 at 9, 27-31 (Redevelopment Report).  There is also \n \n\n  - 7 -   \na shortage of low-income housing in the county as a whole.  The plaintiffs’ expert \nstated that in 2000 there were roughly 5300 units affordable for families making \n50% or less of area median income, while more than 22,000 households needed \nsuch affordable housing.  R. 17-3 at 12 (Beveridge Decl.).  Affordable units \ndecreased between 2000 and 2006 in part, plaintiffs’ expert stated, “due to the \nvacant and now demolished units in the Gardens being removed from the housing \nstock.”  R. 17-3 at 12 (Beveridge Decl.).  Destruction of the Gardens will eliminate \nsome 5% of the county-wide stock of housing affordable for very low or extremely \nlow income residents.  R. 17-3 at 12 (Beveridge Decl.). \nIndeed, relatively few minorities in the county will be able to buy the new \nhomes.  Plaintiffs presented evidence that only 21% of African-American and \nHispanic households in the county would likely be able to afford the new market-\nrate homes, compared to 79% of white households.  R. 106-2 at 8 (Beveridge \nSumm. J. Decl.); R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  \n2.  The District Court’s Decision \nThe district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.  Among \nother things, the court held that the plaintiffs had not presented a prima facie case \nunder their disparate impact theory.  It acknowledged that the project had “an \neffect on low-income families, and, correspondingly, minority families.”  R. 114 at \n3, App. 6 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  But “under plaintiffs’ logic,” the court \n \n\n  - 8 -   \nconcluded, “any action by the Township to do anything with regard to the Gardens \nwould result in a disparate impact, simply because of the racial composition of the \nGardens.”  R. 114 at 13, App. 16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nIn particular, the court rejected plaintiffs’ statistical analysis.  According to \nthe district court, the analysis improperly included the whole of Burlington County \n(rather than only Mount Holly township), did not account for minorities who might \nmove in from outside the county, and did not consider how many displaced \nresidents would move elsewhere in the township.  R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 \n(Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Furthermore, the district court concluded, plaintiffs had \nnot accounted for how many minorities will move into the new development by \nbuying one of the 56 planned affordable units or renting from a white purchaser.  \nR. 114 at 11-13 & n.9, App. 14-16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  The court concluded \nthat plaintiffs’ analysis was insufficient because it did not show that “the new \nhomes created by the redevelopment will be financially out-of-reach for all or most \nminorities.”  R. 114 at 12, App. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nTurning to statistics on the absolute numbers of African-American and \nHispanic households who could likely afford the homes, the court concluded that \nthere were 16,744 such families in Burlington County.  R. 114 at 12 n.9, App. 15 \n(Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  This population had the “ability to occupy all 464 market \nrate homes.”  R. 114 at 12 n.9, App. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Furthermore, the \n \n\n  - 9 -   \ncourt stated the plan did not “apply differently to minorities than non-minorities,” \nbecause many residents – including some plaintiffs – were white and would \nnevertheless lose their housing.  R. 114 at 11, App. 14 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nThe court further decided that plaintiffs had failed to establish a prima facie \ncase of disparate impact on the ground that no one has “been forced out of their \nhomes by the Township without the offer of relocation services.”  R. 114 at 14, \nApp. 17 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  In so holding, the court noted that all plaintiffs, \nexcept one removed by her landlord, still reside in the neighborhood.  R. 114 at 14, \nApp. 17 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nThe court found that, in any event, defendants met their burden to show a \nlegitimate government interest.  R. 114 at 10 & n.6, App. 13 (Jan. 3, 2011 \nOpinion).  Plaintiffs, the court concluded, had not rebutted this conclusion with any \nshowing that less discriminatory actions were available.  R. 114 at 10 & n.6, App. \n13 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).   \nThe court further concluded that the plaintiffs had not shown intentional \ndiscrimination.  R. 114 at 20-21, App. 23-24 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion); see also R. 94 \nat 7 (Feb. 13, 2009 Opinion).  Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment \nfor defendants on plaintiffs’ 42 U.S.C. 1982 and 42 U.S.C. 1983 claims, as well as \ntheir intentional discrimination claims brought under New Jersey law.  R. 114 at \n18-26, App. 21-29 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  \n \n\n  - 10 -   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n  The district court applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating plaintiffs’ \ndisparate impact claim, and consequently erred in ruling that they had not \npresented a prima facie case.  The district court held that plaintiffs had failed to \nestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact under the FHA because they had \nnot shown that the new homes created by the redevelopment would be financially \nunavailable for most or all minorities.  In so ruling, the district court failed to \nproperly resolve the determinative question:  whether the proposed redevelopment \nwould have a disproportionate effect on a protected group.  Because plaintiffs \npresented sufficient evidence that the redevelopment would have a \ndisproportionate adverse effect upon minorities in Mount Holly Township, as well \nas Burlington County, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to \ndefendants on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to present a prima facie case of \ndisparate impact under the FHA.  \nThe district court similarly erred in rejecting plaintiffs’ disparate impact \nclaim on the ground that there were, in absolute terms, enough higher-income \nminority households in Burlington County to purchase all of the houses in the \nplanned redevelopment.  While there is no one statistical method to demonstrate \ndisparate impact, the analysis should be based on relative numbers of minority and \nnonminority households adversely affected by the proposed redevelopment, rather \n \n\n  - 11 -   \nthan on the absolute number of minority households who the court finds earn \nenough income to be able to afford the new housing to be created by \nredevelopment. \nIn this case, the district court did not fulfill its proper role in resolving \ndefendants’ summary judgment motion.  The court plainly did not view the facts \non the disproportionate racial effect of the redevelopment in the light most \nfavorable to plaintiffs, instead rejecting plaintiffs’ evidence – including expert  \nreports – that the proposed redevelopment will effectively and significantly affect \nthe minority population in Mount Holly.  Because of this, and the erroneous legal \nstandards it applied, the district court’s determination that plaintiffs failed to \nestablish a prima facie case of disparate impact should be reversed.    \nARGUMENT \n \nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE \nPLAINTIFFS DID NOT PRESENT A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF \nDISPARATE IMPACT DISCRIMINATION \n \nA.  Standard Of Review   \nThe issue of whether plaintiffs presented a prima facie case of disparate \nimpact is a matter of law, reviewed de novo.  EEOC v. Metal Serv. Co., 892 F.2d \n341, 345 (3d Cir. 1990) (“[A] district court’s analysis of whether the evidence \npresented is sufficient to establish a prima facie case” of discrimination, as \n \n\n  - 12 -   \nopposed to liability, “is plenary because it necessarily implicates the application of \na legal standard to historical facts”). \nThis Court reviews a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.  \nLapid-Laurel v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of Twp. of South Plains, 284 F.3d 442, \n449 & n.4 (3d Cir. 2002).  A court should grant summary judgment only where, \n“viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,” there is \n“no genuine issue of material fact.”  Id. at 449 n.4.  “The judge’s function at the \nsummary judgment stage is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of \nthe matter.”  Ibid. \nB.   Disparate Impact Analysis Under The Fair Housing Act  \nThe Fair Housing Act makes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent * * * or \notherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. 3604(a).  This \nCourt – and indeed every Circuit to consider the issue – has concluded that the Act \nencompasses disparate impact claims.3  Community Servs., Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun. \nAuth., 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005); Lapid-Laurel, 284 F.3d at 466-467; \n                                                           \n3  Under the Fair Housing Act a prima facie showing of discriminatory effect \nmay also be established by evidence that a facially neutral housing practice \nperpetuates segregated housing patterns.  See, e.g., Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. \nFulton Cnty., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006); Huntington Branch, NAACP \nv. Town of Huntington, 844 F. 2d 926, 937 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d, 488 U.S. 15 \n(1988) (per curium); United States v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1184-\n1186 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1042 (1975). \n \n\n  - 13 -   \nResident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 \nU.S. 908 (1978); Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. HUD, Nos. 10-\n5257 & 10-5269, 2011 WL 1327713, at *6 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 8, 2011) (“Each of the \neleven circuits that have resolved the matter has found the disparate impact theory \napplicable under the Fair Housing Act.”). \nTo establish a disparate impact case of racial discrimination, the plaintiff \nmust show that the defendant’s action will have a disproportionate effect on a \nracial group.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 143 (noting disparate impact claim where city’s \naction “had the undeniable effect of ‘bear[ing] more heavily on one race than \nanother’”) (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 270 (1977)).  Although other factors may go to the ultimate merits, this Court \nhas held that “discriminatory effect alone will, if proved, establish a * * * prima \nfacie case.”  Id. at 148 & n.32.  If the plaintiff succeeds, the burden shifts to the \ndefendant to show “a legitimate, bona fide interest” in taking the challenged action.  \nId. at 149.  If the defendant meets its burden, plaintiff then has the burden to show \nthat less discriminatory practices are available.  Id. at 149 n.37. \nThere is no clear rule for the statistical showing needed in a prima facie \ncase; plaintiffs must offer “proof of disproportionate impact, measured in some \nplausible way.”  Greater New Orleans, 2011 WL 1327713, at *6.  See also \nHallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton Cnty., 466 F.3d 1276, 1286 (11th Cir. 2006) \n \n\n  - 14 -   \n(“no single test controls in measuring disparate impact”) (quotation marks and \ncitation omitted).  This Court has stated that plaintiffs must show that a challenged \nhousing practice “has fallen more harshly” on a protected group.  Doe v. Butler, \n892 F.2d 315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989).  In Rizzo, the Court found prima facie evidence \nof a disparate impact where “the impact of the governmental defendants’ \ntermination of the [housing] project was felt primarily by blacks.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d \nat 149.   \nCourts have accepted a variety of statistical showings as establishing a prima \nfacie disparate impact case, including analyses based on a statistical connection \nbetween income and race.  This can be shown where the plaintiff establishes that \nthere is a shortage of housing accessible to a protected group, and that the shortage \nis causally linked to the challenged policy.  In Huntington Branch, NAACP v. \nTown of Huntington, 844 F. 2d 926, 929 (2d Cir. 1988), aff’d, 488 U.S. 15 (1988) \n(per curium), for example, plaintiffs stated a prima facie case by showing a \nshortage of low- and moderate-income housing, and that the impact of the shortage \nwas three times greater on African Americans than on the overall population.  See \nalso Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055, 1062-1064 (4th Cir. 1982); cf. \nArtisan/American Corp. v. City of Alvin, 588 F.3d 291, 298-299 (5th Cir. 2009) \n(plaintiffs’ claim failed where they did not make a showing typical in a disparate \n \n\n  - 15 -   \nimpact case, such as a waiting list for affordable housing, a shortage of affordable \nhousing, or individuals affected by the challenged action).   \nC.   The District Court Erred In Holding That Plaintiffs Failed To Show A Prima \n  Facie Case Of Disparate Impact Discrimination Under The Fair Housing \n  Act Because They Did Not Show That The New Housing Would Be \n  Unaffordable To All Or Most Minority Households \n \nIn this case, the district court applied the wrong standard to plaintiffs’ \nstatistical evidence, concluding that plaintiffs failed because they did not show that \n“the new homes created by the redevelopment will be financially out-of-reach for \nall or most minorities.”  R. 114 at 12, App. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  This \nstandard is much more restrictive than the proper rule applied in a disparate impact \ncase.   \nThe proper analysis requires a disproportionate adverse effect on a protected \ngroup, rather than an adverse effect on “all or most” minority families.4  R. 114 at \n12, App. 15 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  In order to make out a disparate impact claim, \na plaintiff must “establish[] that a challenged practice has a significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate impact on a protected group.”  See Tsombanidis v. West Haven \nFire Dep’t, 352 F.3d 565, 575 (2d Cir. 2003).   \n                                                           \n4  Even if the court’s standard were correct, the plaintiffs established that \nonly 21% of African-American and Hispanic households in Burlington County \ncould afford to live in the new development, whereas 79% of white households \ncould afford the new homes.  R. 106-2 at 8 (Beveridge Summ. J. Decl.); R. 114 at \n12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Thus “most” minority households \nin the county could not afford the new housing.     \n \n\n  - 16 -   \nIn Rizzo, for example, this Court found a prima facie case where the city \nopposed a low-income housing development, and African Americans made up “a \nsubstantial proportion of those who would be eligible” to live in the challenged \ndevelopment.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 142, 149.  Waiting lists for low-income housing \nwere 85% African-American, and this showed that African-American families \nwould be disproportionately affected.  Ibid.  But the Court did not require plaintiffs \nto show that all or most African-American families in the city needed low-income \nhousing.  And in Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 929, plaintiffs stated a prima \nfacie case where there was a shortage of low-income housing, and 24% of African-\nAmerican families required such housing.  Twenty-four percent was certainly not \nall or most African-American families, but the impact of the shortage was \ndisproportionate; only seven percent of all families in the city needed low-income \nhousing.  Ibid.  In this case, plaintiffs’ expert opined that – at least by some \nmeasures – African-American and Hispanic families are respectively 8 and 11 \ntimes more likely than white families to be negatively affected by the \nredevelopment.  R. 106-2 at 5 (Beveridge Summ. J. Decl.).   \nIndeed, a plaintiff may state a prima facie case even if substantial numbers \nof minority families clearly are not affected by the challenged practice.  In \nCommittee Concerning Community Improvement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, \n703 (9th Cir. 2009), for example, the plaintiffs argued their neighborhoods, which \n \n\n  - 17 -   \nwere 71% Hispanic, were improperly denied certain city services.  Other \nneighborhoods, which did receive services, also had substantial Hispanic \npopulations of 48%.  Ibid.  Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit concluded that plaintiffs \nhad made a prima facie showing of disparate impact.  Id. at 704-705.   \nAccording to plaintiffs’ evidence, the proposed redevelopment in this case \nnot only affects the availability of affordable housing in the township and county, \nbut also directly affects a discrete group – Gardens residents.  In measuring the \nadverse effect of the proposed redevelopment, the racial composition of potentially \ndisplaced residents is also a relevant consideration.  Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assocs., \n736 F.2d 983, 987 (4th Cir. 1984).  Here, it is undisputed that displaced residents \nare disproportionately minority when compared to the population of Mount Holly \nTownship or Burlington County as a whole.  Mount Holly Township is 66% white, \n21% African-American, and 9% Hispanic; Burlington County has roughly similar \ndemographics (76% white, 15% African-American, and 4% Hispanic).  R. 17-3 at \n13 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 12-13 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 3-\n4 (Responding Statement of Facts).  The census blocks containing the Gardens \nneighborhood are 20% white, 46% African-American, and 29% Hispanic.  R. 17-3 \nat 14 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 73 at 12 (Second Amended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 4 \n(Responding Statement of Facts).   \n \n\n  - 18 -   \nIndeed, relatively few minorities in the county will be able to buy the new \nhomes.  Plaintiffs’ expert stated that only 21% of African-American and Hispanic \nhouseholds in the county would likely be able to afford the new market-rate \nhomes, compared to 79% of white households.  R. 106-2 at 8 (Beveridge Summ. J. \nDecl.); R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  Moreover, it is \nundeniable that nearly all Gardens residents have low incomes and could not afford \nto purchase or rent market-rate homes in the redeveloped area.  R. 73 at 14 (Second \nAmended Complaint); R. 106-1 at 42 (Responding Statement of Facts); Doc. 112 \nat 38-40 (Def. Summ. J. Br.). \nOn this record, then, plaintiffs have plainly made a plausible statistical \nshowing of disparate impact sufficient to state a prima facie case.  The district \ncourt’s conclusion that plaintiffs failed to prove that most or all minorities would \nbe unable to afford the new housing does nothing to undermine this conclusion.5 \n                                                           \n5  Given the flexible standards for establishing a prima facie statistical \nshowing, the district court also erred in concluding plaintiffs’ analysis was too \nnarrow because it did not “account for minorities who will move into Mt. Holly \nTownship from outside Burlington County.”  R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 (Jan. \n3, 2011 Opinion).  Where there is a sufficient impact in a smaller region, broader \nanalysis may not be necessary.  See Huntington Branch, 844 F.2d at 938 n.8.  \nGoing to the opposite extreme, the court erred in rejecting plaintiff’s analysis \nbecause it was too broad, including “the entire population of Burlington County, \nrather than only Mt. Holly Township.”  R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, App. 15-16 (Jan. 3, \n2011 Opinion).  Plaintiffs in fact did include statistics about the township, adjacent \nareas, and the Gardens neighborhood.  R. 17-3 at 5, 9-11 (Beveridge Decl.).  \nPlaintiffs’ expert stated that nearly all Gardens residents would be unable to afford \n(continued...) \n \n\n  - 19 -   \nD.   The District Court Erred In Holding That Plaintiffs Failed To Establish A \n  Prima Facie Case Of Disparate Impact Because There Were Enough \n  Minority Households In Burlington County To Occupy All Of The Proposed \n  New Units \n \nThe court also erred in rejecting plaintiffs’ prima facie showing on the \nground that there were, in absolute terms, enough middle-income minority families \nin Burlington County to occupy all of the proposed new units.  R. 114 at 12-13 n.9, \nApp. 15-16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  The district court found that there were some \n16,744 African-American and Hispanic families in Burlington County who could \nlikely afford houses in the new development.  R. 114 at 13 n.9, App. 16 (Jan. 3, \n2011 Opinion); see also R. 112 at 39 (Def. Summ. J. Br.).  The court concluded \nthat this showed “the minority population’s ability to occupy all 464 market rate \nhomes.”  R. 114 at 13 n.9, App. 16 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  While there is no \nspecific rule about the form of statistical analysis required to show disparate \nimpact, the analysis should be based, by definition, on a disproportionate impact \non a protected group, rather than on absolute numbers.   \nOther appellate courts have specifically considered and rejected analyses of \nabsolute rather than proportional statistics.  In Huntington Branch, the Second \n                                                           \n(...continued) \nthe new homes, and that the development project would have a disparate impact on \nthe township and the county.  R. 17-3 at 5, 9-11, 51 (Beveridge Decl.); R. 17-4 \n(Beveridge Decl. Exh.).  The county-wide impact does not negate plaintiffs’ \nshowing; rather it underscores the scope of the disparate impact.   \n \n\n  - 20 -   \nCircuit reversed the district court in part because of its improper reliance on \nabsolute figures.  In that case, the district court compared “the larger absolute \nnumber of white poor (22,160) with minority poor (3,671),” and noted that large \nnumbers of white residents might benefit from the proposed project.  Huntington \nBranch, 844 F.2d at 933 (quoting Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of \nHuntington, 668 F. Supp. 762, 786 (E.D.N.Y. 1987)).  The Second Circuit held \nthat “[b]y relying on absolute numbers rather than on proportional statistics, the \ndistrict court significantly underestimated the disproportionate impact of the \nTown’s policy,” and “perceived facts through a misapprehension of the applicable \nlaw.”  Id. at 938.  The Eleventh Circuit has similarly rejected reliance on absolute \nnumbers, noting that “[t]ypically, a disparate impact is demonstrated by statistics,” \nand “it may be inappropriate to rely on absolute numbers rather than on \nproportional statistics.”  Hallmark Developers, Inc., 466 F.3d at 1286 (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted).6 \nGiven the relatively flexible standard for establishing a statistical prima facie \nshowing, see Greater New Orleans, 2011 WL 1327713, at *6, it is clear that the \n                                                           \n6  The district court made a similar analytical error in rejecting plaintiffs’ \nanalysis on the ground that white residents of the Gardens were affected in the \nsame way as minority residents.  R. 114, App. 14 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  The \ncourt should have considered the disproportionate impact on minority families, \ninstead of the fact that some number of white families would also lose their homes.   \n \n\n  - 21 -   \ndistrict court applied impermissibly restrictive legal standards in granting \ndefendants’ summary judgment motion on the ground that plaintiffs failed to \npresent a prima facie case of disparate impact.  It is equally clear that the court \nfailed to consider the plaintiffs’ evidence “in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party,” and to “draw all reasonable inferences in that party’s favor.”  \nEBC, Inc. v. Clark Bldg. Sys., 618 F.3d 253, 262 (3d Cir. 2010).  Here, “a rational \nperson could conclude” that plaintiffs are correct on the disputed issue of disparate \nimpact.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).7   \n \n \n \n                                                           \n7  In addition, the district court erred in ruling that plaintiffs failed to \nestablish their disparate impact claim because they have not yet been evicted, and \nno one has “been forced out of their homes by the Township without the offer of \nrelocation services.”  R. 114 at 14, App. 17 (Jan. 3, 2011 Opinion).  The Fair \nHousing Act states that “[a]n aggrieved person” may seek redress, and defines an \naggrieved person as “any person who * * * claims to have been injured by a \ndiscriminatory housing practice” or “believes that such person will be injured by a \ndiscriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.”  42 U.S.C. 3602(i); 42 \nU.S.C. 3613 (emphasis added).  The Act reaches “imminent” harm, provided it is \n“not conjectural or hypothetical.”  Lincoln v. Case, 340 F.3d 283, 289 (5th Cir. \n2003) (quoting United States v. Hays, 515 U.S. 737, 743 (1995)).  “[A] person who \nis likely to suffer such an injury need not wait until a discriminatory effect has \nbeen felt before bringing suit.”  LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 425 \n(2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1017 (1998).  Moreover, relocation \nassistance does not cure a potential Fair Housing Act violation.  If this were so, an \noffer of assistance would essentially immunize a municipality against Fair Housing \nAct claims, even where the displacement is discriminatory. \n \n\n  - 22 -   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should hold that the district court erred in granting summary \njudgment to the defendants on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to establish a \nprima facie case of disparate impact.   \n \n \n              Respectfully submitted, \n              THOMAS E.

The Notice of Appeal was filed in a timely \nmanner pursuant to F.R.A.P 4 on Jan.19, 2011. \nSTATEMENT OF ISSUES \n1.  Whether  the  District  Court,  in  dismissing  Residents’  Title  VIII \ndisparate impact claims on summary judgment, misapplied well settled precedent \nby:  (a)  conflating  “disparate  treatment”  with  “disparate  impact”;  and  (b) \ndetermining that governmental action disproportionately displacing minorities by \neliminating lower income housing is not actionable under Title VIII? \n1 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 10      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n2.  Whether the District Court erred in finding that Residents, in opposing \nsummary  judgment,  had  failed  to  establish  any  genuine  issue  of  material  fact \nregarding their prima facie case of Title VIII disparate impact where Residents had \npresented  uncontroverted  expert  evidence  showing  that  the  Township’s \nredevelopment is having a “severe” disparate impact upon African-American and \nHispanic residents? \n3.  Whether the District Court erred in finding that there was no genuine \nissue of material fact concerning redevelopment alternatives where Residents had \npresented  expert  evidence  showing  that  the  Township  could  have  taken  less \ndestructive redevelopment alternatives having less discriminatory impact? \n4.  Whether the District Court erred in finding there was no genuine issue \nof material fact that Township officials had undertaken the Gardens redevelopment \nwith discriminatory intent where residents had presented circumstantial evidence \nof discriminatory motive meeting the Arlington Heights factors? \n5.  Whether the District Court erred in converting a motion to dismiss to \na summary judgment motion and rendering final judgment in the case even though \nResidents had been denied any opportunity for discovery? \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n  This is a civil rights action challenging Defendant-Appellee Mount Holly \nTownship’s  (“Township”)  wide-scale  redevelopment  of  the  predominately \n2 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 11      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nAfrican-American and Hispanic, low and moderate income neighborhood known \nas  Mt.  Holly  Gardens  (“Gardens”).    Plaintiffs-Appellants are  an  association  of \nresidents, Mt. Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., (“CIA”), and 23 current and \nformer  individual  residents  of  the  Gardens.  The  Township  and  its  selected \nredevelopers,  Defendant-Appellees  Keating  Urban  Partners,  LLC  and  Triad \nAssociations,  Inc.    (“Keating,”  “Triad,”  or  collectively,  “Redevelopers”),    are \nseeking to acquire and demolish all 329 homes within the Gardens redevelopment \narea that are affordable to current and displaced families to make way for new, \nmuch higher-priced market rate homes intended for more affluent households. If \nthe  redevelopment  project  proceeds  as  planned,  the  Township  will  succeed  in \nirrevocably tearing down the most identifiable  minority community within Mt. \nHolly, permanently displacing hundreds of lower income minority residents.    \n  In  prior  state  court  litigation,  in  2005  the  Superior  Court  upheld  the \nTownship’s finding that the Gardens neighborhood met New Jersey’s state law \ncriteria for designation as an “area in need of redevelopment.” JA 1360-70; (#18-\n09,  pp.  1-10  (5/5/05  Op.).  The  Trial  court  dismissed  without  prejudice  the \nResidents’ civil rights and other substantive challenges to the redevelopment plan \nas not being ripe for adjudication. JA 1952-64, #84-04, pp. 1-13 (8/30/05 Op.). \nThese rulings were affirmed on appeal. JA 1114-1132, #17-31, pp. 1-19 (App. Div. \nOp.); JA 1133, #17-32, p. 1 (Sup. Ct. Order).  \n3 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 12      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n  The Residents filed their Complaint in federal District Court on May 27, \n2008, alleging both disparate impact and intentional discrimination in violation of \nTitle VIII, (First Count), the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \n§1982,  (Second  Count),  and  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the \nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because of race, ethnicity \nand/or national origin, actionable pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. (Third Count) JA \n1\n39-40 (Dkt.)   Residents and CIA sought, among other things, declaratory and \ninjunctive relief invalidating the redevelopment plan, mandating that the Township \ncarry  out  redevelopment  in  the  Gardens  in  a  manner  having  the  least \ndiscriminatory adverse impact upon African-American and Hispanic households, \nand prohibiting implementation without providing adequate affordable replacement \nhousing for all current and displaced Gardens residents. Residents and CIA also \nsought  damages  and/or  just  compensation  sufficient  for  Residents  to  secure \n2\npermanent replacement housing in the local housing market.   \n  On July 18, 2008, the Residents moved for preliminary injunctive relief and \nthe Defendants moved to dismiss the claims. JA 42 (Dkt.); JA 56-1343; JA 1349-\n                                                 \n1  Residents  also  included  two  additional  constitutional  claims  (Tenth  and \nThirteenth Counts) and nine supplemental state law claims. These claims were \ndismissed early in the litigation and are not the subject of this appeal. JA 39-40 \n(Dkt.) \n \n2 The Complaint was amended on June 10, 2008 to add additional plaintiffs. JA 41 \n(Dkt.) \n4 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 13      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n70. After the Township formally amended its redevelopment plan in September, \n2008, Residents moved to amend their complaint. JA 46 (Dkt.). On October 28, \n2008, the District Court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss, \nfinding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the Residents’ discrimination \nclaims,  and  dismissing  certain  other  claims  as  moot  or  as  not  yet  ripe  for \nadjudication. JA 46 (Dkt.). On November 25, 2008 the Court granted in part the \nmotion  for  leave  to  amend.  JA  48  (Dkt.).  On  November  26,  2008  Residents \nrequested  emergency  relief  to  stop  demolitions  of  Township-owned  properties, \nwhich was denied. JA 48 (Dkt); JA 1732-1787.  On December 4, 2008 and January \n14, 2009, Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. JA \n50-51 (Dkt.); JA 1949-1968.  On February 13, 2009, the District Court issued an \nOpinion denying preliminary injunctive relief. JA 1969-83, #114, pp. 1-15 (Pr. Inj. \nOp.). On October 23, 2009, the District Court converted the motions to dismiss the \nfederal discrimination claims to a summary judgment motion, while dismissing the \nremaining state law and constitutional claims. JA 53 (Dkt.). Summary judgment in \nfavor of the Defendants was entered on January 3, 2011. JA 3-31, #114, pp. 1-29 \n(SJ Op.); #115, p. 1 (SJ Order).  \n  Residents filed their Notice of Appeal on January 19, 2011, and applied to \nthis  Court  for  a  stay  pending  appeal  on  January  27,  2011.    The  Township’s \nsubsequent Motion to Clarify the Stay was denied and the appeal was expedited.   \n5 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 14      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n  Originally consisting of 329 rowhomes, the Gardens neighborhood in Mount \nHolly Township, at one time housed the largest concentration of African-American \nand Hispanic residents living within the Township.  JA 71, 105; #17-04, p. 16, 50 \n(Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec. & Exh. G). In the Gardens, Whites comprised only 19.7% \nof  the  population,  while  African-Americans  comprised  46.1%  and  Hispanic \ncomprised  28.8%.  This  is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  Township,  where  Whites \ncomprised 66.2%, African-Americans comprised 20.8%, and Hispanics comprised \n8.8%  of  the  population,  and  to  Burlington  County,  where  Whites  comprised \n76.3%, African-Americans comprised 14.8%, and Hispanics comprised 4.2% of \nthe population.

All \nthree  plans,  adopted  despite  strong  resident  opposition,  have  called  for  the \nTownship’s acquisition of all Gardens homes by purchase or eminent domain, the \nTownship’s  displacement  and  relocation  of  all  Gardens  residents  out  of  the \ncommunity, total demolition of all Gardens homes and replacing them with newly \nconstructed, more expensive housing beyond the financial reach of current Gardens \nresidents.

Even though the \nTownship and Keating did not need the land that Residents were occupying within \nthe Gardens until later in the redevelopment process, the Township nonetheless \nstarted  to  aggressively  implement  the  redevelopment  plan  against  Gardens \nresidents soon after hiring Keating.   \n  In  2006,  the  Township  adopted  a  Workable  Relocation  Assistance  Plan \n(“WRAP”), prepared by Triad.

General Elec. Astrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d Cir.1996) The Third \nCircuit’s review of the grant of summary judgment is plenary. Id.  Under F.R.C.P. \n56(c),  summary  judgment  “is  proper  only  where  there  is  no  genuine  issue  of \nmaterial  fact  for  the  factfinder  to  decide”  and  the  moving  party  is  entitled  to \njudgment as a matter of law.

Rizzo,  564  F.2d  126  (3d  Cir.  1977),  cert. \ndenied, 435 U.S. 908 (1978).  Contrary to Rizzo, the court conflated “disparate \ntreatment” with “disparate impact” under Title VIII and ignored Rizzo and settled \nauthority  from  around  the  country  in  reasoning  that  governmental  action \ndisproportionately displacing minorities by eliminating lower income housing is \nnot actionable under Title VIII.    \nThe  District  Court  also  improperly  disregarded  the  Residents’  expert’s \ncomprehensive analysis and opinion establishing Residents’ Title VIII prima facie \ncase that the Township’s redevelopment plan is having a “severe” disparate impact \non minority residents of the Gardens neighborhood, Mount Holly Township and \nBurlington County, and ignored genuinely disputed issues of material fact that, \nunder Rizzo, the Township could have taken and still can take less destructive \nredevelopment alternatives having less of a discriminatory impact. \n The District Court further erred in granting summary dismissing Residents’ \nintentional discrimination claims against the Township under Title VIII and the \nth\nEqual Protection Clause of 14  Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The \nResidents  had  presented  circumstantial  evidence  meeting  the  factors  that  the \nSupreme Court had established in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan \nHousing  Development  Corporation,  429  U.S.  252,  265-69  (1977)  (“Arlington \n15 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 24      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nHeights”)  for  proving  discriminatory  intent  sufficient  to  preclude  summary \njudgment, as well evidence showing that the foreseeable result of the Township’s \nactions supported an inference of discriminatory motive.   \nThe  District  Court  also  misapplied  summary  judgment  standards  by \nimpermissibly weighing the evidence and erroneously drawing inferences in favor \nof the Township as moving party rather than in favor of Residents in opposing \nsummary judgment, as well improperly granting summary judgment dismissing \nResident’s  claims  without  allowing  Residents  the  reasonable  opportunity  to \nconduct any discovery in this case.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  THE THIRD CIRCUIT SHOULD REVERSE THE DISTRICT \nCOURT’S SUMMARY JUDGMENT DECISION DISMISSING \nRESIDENTS’  TITLE  VIII  DISPARATE  IMPACT  HOUSING \nDISCRIMINATION CLAIMS. \n \nIn 1968, Congress enacted the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., to combat housing discrimination \nthroughout the nation.  Title VIII makes it “unlawful to refuse to sell or rent . . . or \notherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any person because of race, \ncolor, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  The \n“broad remedial  intent  of  Congress”  is  “embodied  in  the  Act,”  Havens  Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 381 (1982) and as such Title VIII’s scope is \n“broad  and  inclusive”  and  should  be  given  “a  generous  construction.”  City  of \n16 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 25      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nEdmonds v. Oxford House, Inc., 514 U.S. 725, 731 (1995).  See also Hovsons, Inc. \nv. Brick Township, 89 F. 3d 1096, 1106 (3d Cir. 1996) (acknowledging broad \nCongressional remedial intent underlying Title VIII); Lakeside Resorts Enterprises, \nL.P. v. Board of Supervisors of Palmyra Township, 455 F.3d 154, 157 (3d Cir. \n2006)  (“we  are  to  give  a  ‘generous  construction’  to  the  statute's  ‘broad  and \ninclusive’ language”) (quotation omitted). \nIn  the  Third  Circuit,  it  has  long  been  established  that  a  plaintiff  may \nestablish a prima facie case of housing discrimination under Title VIII by showing \ndiscriminatory  effect,  i.e.  “adverse  disparate  impact,”  without  having  to \ndemonstrate  any  discriminatory  intent,  i.e.,  “disparate  treatment.”  Resident \nAdvisory Board v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 147-49 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 \nU.S. 908 (1978). The Rizzo court explained that “[e]ffect, not motivation, is the \ntouchstone because a thoughtless housing practice can be as unfair to minority \nrights as a willful scheme.\" Id. at 148, n. 31.  Further, under Rizzo, if a plaintiff \nestablishes  a  prima  facie  case,  the  burden  shifts  to  defendant  to  demonstrate \njustification that “must serve, in theory and practice, a legitimate, bona fide interest \nof the Title VIII defendant, and the defendant must show that no other alternative \ncourse of action could be adopted that would enable that interest to be served with \nless discriminatory impact.” Id. at 149. “If the defendant does introduce evidence \nthat no such alternative course of action can be adopted, the burden will once again \n17 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 26      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nshift to the plaintiff to demonstrate that other practices are available.” Id. at 149 n. \n37. See also, Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C v. Zoning Board of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, \n466-67 (3d Cir. 2002). \nA.  The  District  Court  Misapplied  Well-Settled  Third  Circuit \nDisparate  Impact  Precedent  Established  Under  Rizzo  By \nErroneously  Conflating  “Disparate  Treatment”  With  “Disparate \nImpact” Under Title VIII.   \n  \n  The District Court acknowledged that “the Gardens redevelopment has had \nan effect on low-income families, and correspondingly, minority families” and that \n“being forced from one’s home is a difficult and emotional issue, compounded by \nthe fear of being unable to afford a comparable place to live.” JA 6, #114, p. 3 (SJ \nOp.). The court nevertheless concluded that the redevelopment plan did not have a \ndisparate impact upon minority residents because “importantly for the plaintiffs’ \nFHA claim of disparate impact, the redevelopment plan does not apply differently \nto minorities than non-minorities” residing in the Gardens. JA 14, #114, p. 11 (SJ \nOp.).  The court emphasized that “it is not just the African-American and Hispanic \nplaintiffs who are impacted by the increased housing prices – it is all Gardens \nresidents, including the Caucasian residents.” JA 15, #114, p. 12 (SJ Op.).   \n  The  District  Court’s  interpretation  of  Title  VIII  improperly  conflates \n“disparate treatment” With “disparate impact.  The essence of disparate impact \nunder  Title  VIII  is  a  facially  neutral  governmental  action  that  adversely  and \ndisproportionately affects a protected group.  Rizzo, supra.  Disparate impact does \n18 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 27      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nnot require that the challenged action must absolutely and exclusively impact a \nprotected minority group; rather, disparate impact is established by showing the \nrelative  comparative  harm,  i.e.,  that  the  group  of  persons  adversely  affected, \ncompared  to  the  larger  relevant  population,  is  comprised  disproportionately  of \nmembers of a protected class.  See Rizzo, supra, (disparate impact found in favor \nof minority public housing applicants despite white public housing applicants also \nadversely affected); Lapid Laurel, supra, at 466-67 (applying Rizzo, “the plaintiff \nmust show that the Township's action had a greater adverse impact on the protected \ngroup . . . than on others).  See also, Huntington Branch, NAACP v. Town of \nHuntington, 844 F.2d 926, 938 (2d Cir. 1988), aff'd in part, 488 U.S. 15 (1988) \n(proper focus is on “disproportionate burden on minorities”).   \nIndeed, the Eighth Circuit in Charleston Housing Authority v. U.S. Dept. of \nth\nAgriculture,  419  F.3d  729  (8   Cir.  2005)  expressly  rejected  the  same  flawed \ninterpretation of Title VIII that the District Court adopted below. The Housing \nAuthority  argued  on  appeal  that  the  minority  tenants'  disparate  impact  claims \nchallenging demolition should fail because the tenants did not demonstrate that \nsimilarly  situated  non-minority  persons  were  being  treated  any  differently.    In \nrejected this argument, the Court explained that the “Tenants, however, did not \nallege  disparate  treatment,  they  alleged  disparate  impact….[T]he  Tenants  need \nprove no more than that the conduct of the defendant actually or predictably results \n19 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 28      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nin discrimination; in other words, that it has a discriminatory effect.” Charleston, at \n741.  See also Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, \n558  F.2d 1283,  1291 (7th  Cir.  1977)  (Arlington  Heights  II) (“the  fact  that  the \nconduct  complained  of  adversely  affected  white  as  well  as  nonwhite  people, \nhowever,  is  not  by  itself  an  obstacle  to  relief  under  the  Fair  Housing  Act”). \nAccordingly, the District Court below seriously misconstrued Title VIII disparate \nimpact law, mandating reversal. \nB.  The  District  Court  Erroneously  Reasoned  That  Governmental \nAction  Disproportionately  Displacing  Minorities  By  Eliminating \nLower Income Housing Is Not Actionable Under Title VIII.   \n \nThe District Court further erred in ruling that the Township’s destruction of \nthe  Gardens  is  not  actionable  under  Title  VIII  because  “the  real  effect  of  the \nGardens redevelopment is that there will be less lower-income housing in Mt. \nHolly” and “reduction of low-income housing is not a violation of the FHA” which \n“does not speak to income.” JA 14, #114, p. 11 (SJ Op.).  The District Court cited \nno support for this proposition and inexplicably ignored significant federal court \ndecisions over the past 30 years repeatedly ruling that destruction or exclusion of \nlow and moderate income housing does in fact violate disparate impact under Title \nVIII  where  protected  lower  income  minorities  would  be  disproportionately \nadversely affected by the loss or denial of such housing. \n Indeed, the Third Circuit’s decision in Rizzo is just such a case. The Third \n20 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 29      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nCircuit found that the housing authority’s refusal to permit construction of public \nhousing in a predominantly white neighborhood had a much greater adverse effect \non  minorities  because  more  minorities  had  lower  incomes  qualifying  them  for \npublic housing.  See also, Arlington Heights II, supra, at 1291 (minority plaintiffs \nhad  actionable  Title  VIII  claim  where  municipality’s  zoning    preventing \nconstruction  of  low-cost  housing  disproportionately  excluded  lower  income \nAfrican-Americans  in  need  of  such  housing);  Huntington  Branch,  supra,  938 \n(municipality  violated  Title  VIII  by  refusing  to  allow  low-income  subsidized \nhousing in a predominately white neighborhood since minorities, because of their \nlower  income  status,  were  more  likely  to  be  in  need  of  and  eligible  for  such \nhousing); Dews v. Town of Sunnyvale, Texas, 109 F. Supp. 2d 526, 565-66 (N.D. \nTex. 2000)  (zoning ordinance effectively banning apartments found to have a \ndiscriminatory effect upon African-Americans because they were in greater need \nof rental housing); Rivera v. Incorporated Village of Farmingdale, 571 F.Supp.2d \n359, 369 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (challenge to redevelopment project eliminating housing \noccupied by lower income Latino workers and replacing it with higher priced units \nunaffordable to such residents actionable under Title VIII  because even if the \nmunicipality “had the best of intentions, the result of the plan disproportionately \ninjured the Latino population in need of low income housing”).  Thus, the District \nCourt’s reasoning is fundamentally flawed and contrary to settled Title VIII law.  \n21 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 30      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nC.  The  District  Court  Improperly  Disregarded  Resident’s  Expert’s \nComprehensive Analysis And Opinion Establishing Residents’ Title \nVIII Prima Facie Case That The Township’s Redevelopment Plan \nIs Having A “Severe” Disparate Impact On African-American And \nHispanic Residents Of The Gardens Neighborhood, Mount Holly \nTownship And Burlington County. \n \nA prima facie case of Title VIII disparate impact can be established through \nstatistical  data  comparing  the  relative  percentage  of  protected  class  members \nversus non-protected class members affected.  See Huntington Branch, supra, at \n937-38; see also Hispanics United v. Addison, 988 F. Supp. 1130, 1156-57 (N.D. \nIll.  1997)  (\"using  town-wide  demographics  for  comparison  to  the  affected \npopulation is a perfectly legitimate method of establishing discriminatory effect”); \nRivera  v.  Incorporated  Village  of  Farmingdale,  ___  F.Supp.2d  ___,  2011  WL \n1260209,  at  *7-*9  (E.D.N.Y.

Inj. Dec.); JA 2044; # 106-02, p. 4 (Beveridge SJ Dec.).  Residents’ \nexpert, Dr. Andrew Beveridge, demonstrated that as of the 2000 Census nearly \n22 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 31      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n75% of the people living in the Gardens were minority residents—46% African-\nAmerican  and  28.8%  Hispanic  –  and  thus  “the  Gardens  contains  a  highly \nconcentrated minority population (African-American and Hispanic), indeed more \nso than any other area of Mt. Holly.”  JA 71, #17-04, p.16 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. \nDec.).  Further,  Dr.  Beveridge  showed  that  while  the  Gardens’  demolition  will \naffect only about 2.7% of all non-Hispanic White households in Mt. Holly, it has \nand  will  impact  22.5%  of  all  African-American  households  and  32.3%  of  all \nHispanic households living in Mt. Holly. JA 71, #17-04, p.16 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. \nDec.).  Thus,  Dr.  Beveridge  concluded  by  demolishing  the  Gardens,  “African-\nAmericans are more than 8 times more likely to be negatively affected, and the \nHispanics are more than 11 times more likely to be negatively affected, than are \nnon-Hispanic  Whites.”    JA  71,  #17-04,  p.16  (Beveridge  Pr.  Inj.  Dec.).    Dr. \nBeveridge  subsequently  affirmed  that  2008  census  data  demonstrated  that  the \n“same pattern of results found in 2000 hold for 2008.” JA 2046, #106-02, p. 6 \n(Beveridge SJ Dec.). \n  Furthermore,  Dr.  Beveridge  demonstrated  that  the  Township’s \nredevelopment project is displacing minority families from homes that have been \naffordable to them.  Gardens residents “were and are mainly a group of extremely \nand very low income homeowners and tenants,” with median household incomes \nsignificantly less compared to Mt. Holly Township and Burlington County, most \n23 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 32      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nwith  annual  household  incomes  less  than  $40,000  and  almost  half  less  than \n$20,000. JA 64, #17-04, p. 9 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.). Existing homes in the \nGardens have been “generally affordable either as rentals or as ownership units” to \nhouseholds “with even lower incomes,” since the homeowner “monthly expenses \nare very low, and the rentals are among the lowest in Burlington County.”  JA 64, \n#17-04, p. 9 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.). Thus, “for families with limited means,” the \nGardens “represented a very attractive affordable housing opportunity.” JA 65; \n#17-04, p. 10 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.). \n   The market rate units called for in the revised WR Redevelopment Plan to \nbe built where the Gardens now stands will sell for $200,000 to $270,000.  The \nmonthly rents for the new apartments will be at least $1,320.  As Dr. Beveridge \nexplained, these prices are “well out of reach” of almost all Gardens residents, \nespecially  since  the  Township  is  paying  Gardens  homeowners  only  $32,000, \n$39,000 and $49,000 for existing one, two and three bedroom homes respectively. \nJA 66, #17-04, p. 11 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA  2044, 2049, #106-02, pp. 4, 9 \n(Beveridge  SJ  Dec.).    In  addition,  the  relocation  assistance  that  the  Township \nprovides for in the WRAP “is woefully inadequate to make the market rate units \naffordable to low income households like those in the Gardens”  JA 66, #17-04; p. \n11 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.) and do “little to mitigate the severe disparate impact \non African-American and Hispanic residents.”  JA 2049, #106-02, p. 9 (Beveridge \n24 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 33      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nSJ  Dec.).    Thus,  except  for  the  few  proposed  affordable  units,  “there  is  no \npossibility that the current residents could afford moving into the new housing \nwithout substantial additional resources,” JA 2048, #106-02, p. 8 (Beveridge SJ \nDec.). Even this small number are targeted to benefit households earning 80% of \nthe  median  area  income,  which  would  still  be  unaffordable  to  most  Gardens \nfamilies, the vast majority of whose household incomes are less than 50% of the \nmedian area income. JA 65-66, #17-04, pp. 10-11 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.).    \n  Dr. Beveridge further opined that since “only those households with incomes \nabove  80  percent  of  area  median  income  will  be  able  afford  to  move  to  the \nredeveloped community” under the proposed market prices, “approximately only \n21% of African-American and Hispanic households would be able to afford the \nnew market rate housing, compared to approximately 79% non-Hispanic White \nhouseholds.”  JA 2048, #106-02, p. 8 (Beveridge SJ Dec.). Since the Gardens was \ncomprised  of  nearly  75%  African-American  and  Hispanic  residents  prior  to \nredevelopment, JA 71, #17-04, p. 16 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.),  “the redeveloped \narea will be mostly non-Hispanic White and will have drastically less African-\nAmericans and Hispanic residents than before redevelopment.” JA 2048, #106-02, \np. 8 (Beveridge SJ Dec.). \nSimilarly, the price of available owner-occupied and rental units in the rest \nof  Mt.  Holly  and  immediate  surrounding  area  are  unaffordable  to  Gardens \n25 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 34      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nresidents. As Dr. Beveridge showed, only a handful of market rate units in the local \narea  would  be  affordable  to  Gardens  residents,  with  the  “overwhelming  of \nmajority” of market rate units “far beyond their reach, even taking into account the \ncurrent provision of relocation assistance in the WRAP.” JA 73-74, #17-04, pp. 18-\n19  (Beveridge  Pr.  Inj.  Dec.).    Dr.  Beveridge’s  analysis  of  updated  area  home \nlistings  is  consistent  with  his  earlier  findings  “as  to  the  scarcity  of  affordable \nhousing options for displaced Gardens residents in the Mt. Holly area.” JA 2049, \n#106-02, p. 9 (Beveridge SJ Dec.). Thus, the redevelopment project “has and will \ncontinue to remove from the current and past residents of the Gardens affordable \nhousing opportunities, while forcing them to search, often in vain, for comparable \nhousing.”  JA 68, #17-04, p. 13 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.).  See also JA 560, # 17-\n08, p. 6 (Arocho Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 624-0625, #17-12, pp. 5-6 (Vicente Pr. Inj. \nDec.); JA 628, # 17-13, p. 3 (Warthen Pr. Inj. Dec.).  \nTherefore,  the  “ongoing  destruction  of  affordable  housing  by  the  WR \nRedevelopment Project has had and will continue to have serious consequences for \nall  low  income  residents,  most  particularly  including  African  American  and \nHispanic residents of the region, who are more likely to be low-income.” JA 75, \n#17-04, p. 20 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.). “Especially hard hit” have been “African-\nAmerican  and  Hispanic  households  who  had  lived  and  currently  live  in  the \nGardens” who “have virtually no chance of replacing their current housing with \n26 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 35      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nhousing equally affordable.” JA 75, #17-04, p. 20 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.).  Thus, \naccording to Dr. Beveridge, “[m]y conclusions set forth in the [earlier] Declaration \nregarding the severe disparate impact of African-American and Hispanic residents \nin the Gardens, in Mt. Holly Township, and in Burlington County similarly still \nhold true.” JA 2044, #106-02, p. 4 (Beveridge SJ Dec.).   \nSince  on  summary  judgment  “[t]he  evidence  of  the  nonmovant  is  to  be \nbelieved, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn” in the Residents’ favor, \nChambers, supra,  587 F.3d at 181, this expert evidence, establishing Residents’ \nprima facie Title VIII disparate impact claim, clearly sufficed to defeat summary \njudgment.  Indeed,  the  Township  never  challenged  the  underlying  statistical \ndemographic  data  or  presented  any  competent  expert  evidence  refuting  Dr. \nBeveridge,  and  the  District  Court  acknowledged  that  Residents  have  made  a \nshowing  that  a  greater  percentage  of  minority  Township  residents  have  been \n3\naffected by the redevelopment. JA 15, #114, p. 12, fn. 8. (SJ. Op.).   Therefore, \nthere was no basis whatsoever for granting the Township summary judgment.  \nThe  District  Court,  however,  impermissibly  “weigh[ed]  the  evidence”  to \n“determine the truth” of Dr. Beveridge’s opinion rather than simply determining \n                                                 \n3 The District Court dismissed this evidence without further discussion, stating that \n“[E]ven if this statistic was sufficient to establish a prima facie case, the plaintiffs’ \nFHA claim fails for reasons other than the disparate impact analysis,” JA 15, #114, \np. 12, fn. 8 (SJ Opinion), thus ignoring well-settled precedent where comparable \nstatistics establishes a prima facie case, as previously discussed above. \n27 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 36      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n“whether there [was] a genuine issue for trial.” Doeblers', supra,  442 F.3d at 820. \nThe Trial Court sua sponte critiqued Dr. Beveridge’s methodology and concluded \nthat Dr. Beveridge’s statistical evidence – showing that only a small percentage of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic households in the County (21%) would be able to \nafford the new homes to be built in the redeveloped neighborhood, while a much \nhigher percentage of white residents (79%) would be able to afford those same \nhomes – “hold little validity to show disparate impact.” JA 16; #114, p. 13 (SJ \nOp.).  Without  citing  any  legal  or  other  support,  the  Court  criticized  Dr. \nBeveridge’s selection of the comparison population (County wide) without any \nexplanation as to why such a county wide analysis would not be appropriate. JA \n16; #114, p.13 (SJ Op.). The Court further contended that the expert analysis did \nnot account for minorities who will move into Mt Holly from outside the County, \nwithout offering any proof that the demographics of the surrounding counties differ \nfrom  those  of  Burlington  County  so  significantly  as  to  alter  the  expert’s \nconclusions.   JA 16; #114, p. 13 (SJ Op.).  \nThe District Court also incorrectly stated that Dr. Beveridge’s analysis did \nnot account for the 11% deed-restricted unit, ignoring the evidence that showed \nthat the deed-restricted units would be affordable to households earning up to 80% \nof  median  income,  while  most  Gardens  residents  had  incomes  below  50%  of \nmedian income. JA 64; #17-04, p. 9 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec); JA 66; #17-04, p. \n28 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 37      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n11(Beveridge  Pr.  Inj.  Dec).  The  court  further  criticized  Dr.  Beveridge  for  not \naccounting for the possibility of minority renters, although the townhouses are, \naccording to the Township’s plan, designed for homeownership, and there is no \nreason to assume that the new townhouses would rent at prices affordable to a \n4\nsignificant number of minority residents.   The Court below also claimed that the \nResidents’ expert did not consider the fact that minorities are moving (presumably \nfrom the Gardens) within Mt. Holly, even though the data in the record showed \nthat less than 1/3 of Gardens residents were being relocated within Mt Holly. JA \n1160; #17-33, pp. 27-31 (Reloc. Chart); JA 1156; #17-33, p. 23(1/24/08 Twp. \nResp. to NJ Publ. Adv.).  \nFinally,  the  District  Court  referred  to  recent  census  data  to  argue  that \nbecause there are almost 17,000 African-American and Hispanic households in the \nCounty who could afford the new homes, a minority population could theoretically \noccupy all 464 market rate houses, improperly considering only the numbers of the \nminority population, rather than the manner in which they are disproportionately \n                                                 \n4\n Indeed, Dr. Beveridge has shown that the new proposed rental units, considerably \nsmaller in size than the townhouses, are out of reach for Gardens residents and for \nmost minority households, so there is no reason to expect the townhomes to be \nmore accessible to minority renters. JA 2048; #106-02, p. 11 (Beveridge SJ Dec.).  \n \n29 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 38      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n 5\naffected, as required under a disparate impact analysis.  JA 16; #114, p. 13 (SJ \nOp.). The court’s severely flawed critique of Residents’ expert evidence, neither \ngrounded in legal precedent nor supported by professional opinion, at most sets a \nframework for a material dispute, but cannot justify the District Court’s outright \nrejection of Residents’ expert proofs and grant of summary judgment.  \nD.  The  District  Court  Improperly  Ignored  Genuinely  Disputed \nIssues Of Material Fact That, Under Rizzo, The Township Could \nHave Taken And Still Can Take Less Destructive Redevelopment \nAlternatives Having Less Discriminatory Impact. \n \nThe District Court similarly erred in holding that the Residents “have not \nshown how an alternative course of action would have a lesser impact” under \nRizzo.  JA 17; #114, p. 14 (S J Op.).  In doing so, the court again failed to accept \nas true the analysis and opinions of Residents’ planning expert, failed to draw all \nreasonable inferences in Residents’ favor, and improperly weighed and assessed \nthe truth of Mr. Smith’s opinions.  \nMr. Gray Smith, Residents’ planning expert, described various options for \nrehabilitating  and  improving  the  Gardens  neighborhood  and  eliminating  or \nreducing  the  blighted  conditions  in  a  less  costly  manner  without  wholesale \nacquisition and demolition of all existing houses and relocation of all residents. JA \n399-407; #17-06, pp. 17-25 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2380, #106-30, pp.14-15 \n                                                 \n5  The  District  Court  also  ignored  the  fact  that  Dr.  Beveridge  had  updated  his \nDeclaration to include the newer census information. JA 2044-2045; #106-02 pp. \n4-5.( Beveridge SJ Dec.). \n30 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 39      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n(Smith  SJ  Dec.).    According  to  the  expert,  a  redevelopment  plan  that  focused \nprimarily on rehabilitation of existing Gardens homes and additional neighborhood \namenities, combined with limited and targeted acquisition, selective demolition \nand new construction and including many more infill affordable units would “meet \nthe  stated  goals  of  the  Township's  original  Redevelopment  Plan”  and  would \n“eliminate blight and comply with state and local public policy criteria” under the \nLRHL. JA 406-407; #17-06, pp. 24-25 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2382; #106-30, p. \n16 (Smith SJ Dec.).  Further, despite “the damages caused by recent Township and \nRedeveloper  actions,”  such  an  “alternative  neighborhood  redevelopment  plan” \ncurrently “is viable and still implementable,”  would be “considerably less costly, \neasier to accomplish,” and would “retain local residents” while providing “modern \naffordable housing.” JA 406-407, #17-06, pp. 24-25 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2382; \n#106-30, p. 16 (Smith SJ Dec.) In his declaration, the expert provided planning \nrecommendations for a rehabilitation approach, listed potential funding sources, \nand identified developers engaged in housing rehabilitation. JA 399-407; #17-06, \npp. 17-25 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.).  \nMoreover, Dr. Beveridge, in reviewing the alternatives that  the planning \nexpert had outlined, stated that in his opinion such less drastic measures would \npermit  many  more  minority  Gardens  residents  “to  stay  either  in  their  current \naffordable  units  or  move  into  newly  constructed  or  substantially  renovated \n31 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 40      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\naffordable  homes,  and  therefore  not  be  permanently  displaced  from  their \ncommunity.” JA 75; #17-04, p. 20 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.).  In addition, these \nalternatives would significantly lessen the adverse impact of African-American and \nHispanic families in the region, since affordable housing opportunities for low \nincome residents would be eliminated.”  JA 75; #17-04, p. 20 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. \nDec.).  Accordingly, Dr. Beveridge states that in his opinion “if these alternatives \nhad been or were to be implemented, it would significantly lessen the adverse \nimpact  of  the  Project  upon  African-American  and  Hispanic  households  and \nfamilies.” JA 75; #17-04, p. 20 (Beveridge Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2047-48; #106-02, pp. \n7-8 (Beveridge SJ Dec.).  \nThe  Township  disputed  the  viability  of  these  alternative  approaches  to \nredevelopment  through  the  Certifications  of  Kathleen  Hoffman,  Township \nManager (stating belief as to why Mt Holly 2000 rehabilitation program too costly, \ndisputing  some  of  Mr.  Smith’s  statements  regarding  availability  of  housing \nsubsidies,  and  concluding  that  complete  redevelopment  with  demolition  and \nrelocation was needed) and Redeveloper Michael Scencindiver (after looking at \nsome  deteriorated,  vacant  property  in  the  Gardens,  decided  that  rehabilitation \nwould be too costly, and stating that new construction is favored by federal and \nstate entities over rehabilitation.).  JA 1376-77; #30-02, pp. 6-7 (Hoffman Pr. Inj. \nDec.); JA 1416; #30-04, p. 5 (Sencindiver Pr. Inj. Dec.).  In response, Residents’ \n32 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 41      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nexpert stated, inter alia, that the Township’s witnesses were not experts, that there \nwere inconsistencies between the estimate by the City employee and the actual \nexperience of the Township in rehabilitating homes, that the witnesses evaluated \nonly the most seriously deteriorated and vacant properties, that the comparisons \nbetween  rehabilitation  and  new  construction  costs  were  inaccurate,  and  that \nrehabilitation was encouraged by HUD and undertaken by many developers. JA \n1507-08; #34-03, pp. 3-4 (Smith 2d Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2381-82; #106-30, pp. 15-16 \n(Smith SJ Dec.). At best, the “evidence” presented by the Township’s witnesses \nsimply  showed  that  material  factual  disputes  existed  regarding  redevelopment \nalternatives, and in no way justified the Trial Court’s grant of summary judgment. \nIn addition, Residents showed through expert evidence that there were other \nways in addition to a rehabilitation approach that the Township could lessen the \ndiscriminatory impacts. “Even if the Township proceeds with 100% demolition of \nthe existing housing and 100% relocation of existing residents, it is a feasible \nalternative to construct a new residential community….within a sequential plan \nthat allows new units to be built without disturbing the existing community.”  JA \n2389; #106-30, p. 23 (Smith SJ Dec.).  The Township also could pay residents \nsufficient compensation and relocation assistance to enable them to purchase a \nreplacement unit within or in the vicinity of the redevelopment area.  JA 2389; \n#106-30, p. 23 (Smith SJ Dec.). Instead, even though the Gardens homes are not \n33 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 42      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nneeded  for  phase  one  of  construction,  the  Township  “made  every  effort  to \ndismantle the existing community before even beginning construction of the new \nunits, JA 2390; #106-30, p. 24 (Smith SJ Dec.), conducting destructive demolitions \nand  reducing  services,  while,  as  discussed  above,  providing  inadequate \ncompensation and relocation benefits.  JA 72- 75; #17-04 pp. 17-20 (Beveridge Pr. \nInj. Dec.); JA 2049; #106-02, p. 9 (Beveridge SJ Dec.). \nResidents  also  presented  evidence  that  Township  never  meaningfully \nconsidered  a  rehabilitation  approach  and  repeatedly  rejected  less  destructive \napproaches to addressing problems in the Gardens.  JA 2136; #106-06, pp. 4-5 \n(Pipes SJ Dec.); JA 2386-2387; #106-30, pp. 21-22 (Smith SJ Dec.). Indeed, the \nResidents’ evidence credibly demonstrated that the Township had pursued a course \nhaving  the  most  discriminatory  impact  –  exacerbating  blight,  conducting \ndestructive  demolitions,  and  pressuring  residents  to  move  out  even  before  the \nTownship was ready to move ahead with construction, while offering inadequate \ncompensation and relocation – evidencing the greatest disregard for the needs and \ninterests of Gardens residents.  \nInstead  of  recognizing  that  this  record  clearly  demonstrated  “sufficient \ndisagreement” on the issue of redevelopment alternatives, Chambers, supra, at 181, \nthe  District  Court  misapplied  the  law,  improperly  analyzed  and  weighed  the \nevidence, and erroneously drew all inferences in favor of the moving party.  First, \n34 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 43      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nthe Court erred in relying on the findings of the state court, contending that the  \nadequacy of the redevelopment plan, as opposed to the rehabilitation plan” had \nbeen extensively litigated, even while noting that the issues in state court were \nlimited to technical compliance with the LRHL. JA 18-19; #114, pp. 15-16 (SJ \n6\nOp.).   Next, the District Court misinterpreted the evidence, contending  that the \nResidents  “propose  a  plan,  as  pointed  out  by  defendants,  that  relies  upon \ngovernment subsidies and upon costs based on property conditions in 1989,” even \nthough the Residents had  proferred the 1989 Biber Plan not as a blueprint to be \nfollowed, but as evidence the Township refused to consider viable alternatives. JA \n19; #114, p. 16 (SJ Op.).  \nThe Court further erroneously contended Residents’ plan did not consider \nrehabilitation costs and did not account for temporary relocation. JA 19; #114, p. \n16 (SJ Op.).  In addition, the Court impermissibly weighed the evidence regarding \nthe feasibility of a rehabilitation alternative. The Court accepted without question \nthe Township’s representations regarding rehabilitation costs of $2.5 million, while \nsummarily rejecting Mr. Smith’s expert testimony comparing relative costs and \n                                                 \n6 In fact, the state courts only examined the validity of the blight designation and \nthe  conformity  of  the  plan  with  the  technical  requirements  of  the  LRHL,  and \nexpressly refused to consider the Residents’ Title VIII claims for lack of ripeness. \nJA 1952-64, #84-04, pp. 1-13 (8/30/05 Opinion); JA 1114-1132, #17-31, pp. 1-19 \n(App.  Div.  Op.).  At  no  time,  therefore,  did  the  state  courts  analyze  whether \nrehabilitation was a feasible, less discriminatory alternative. \n \n35 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 44      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nfinding  that  acquisition,  demolition,  relocation,  site  preparation,  and  new \nconstruction is more expensive than a scaled-down rehabilitation plan. JA 406-407; \n7\n#17-06, pp. 24-25; JA 1508-19, #34-03, pp. 4-15 (Smith Pr. Inj. Reply Dec.)    \nThe  Court  also  impermissibly  drew  inferences  favorable  to  the  moving \nparty.    The  Court  relied  on  self-serving  statements  of  the  Township  Council \ncontained in the public hearing Transcripts about the Township’s consideration and \nrejection  of  “small  scale  efforts”  to  infer  that  the  Township  had  no  viable \nalternatives to its redevelopment proposal, while failing to consider other evidence \nin those Transcripts that showed that the Council completely ignored the valid \nobjections of every Gardens resident who testified regarding the redevelopment \nplan and their proposals for less discriminatory approaches for eliminating blight. \nJA 19; #114, p. 16 (SJ Op.); JA 0652; #17-16, p. 10 (Mallach Report); JA 2536-37, \n2540-41; #112-03, pp. 57-58, 61-62 (9/8/03 Mtg. Trans.); JA 2136; #106-06, pp. 4-\n5 (Pipes SJ Dec.) In addition, the Court relied on language in the New Jersey \nAppellate  Division  decision  upholding  the  blight  designation  to  conclude  that \nrehabilitation was not feasible, even though the appellate court did not rule on that \n                                                 \n7  In  a  footnote,  the  District  Court  rejected  Mr.  Smith’s  expert  analysis  and \nexpressed its own opinion regarding the feasibility of rehabilitation, without citing \nany legal or expert support, stating that at this stage relocation was the “only real \npractical remedy.” JA 20; #114, p. 17 (SJ Opinion).  The Court again engaged in \nimpermissible weighing and evaluating the evidence, instead of recognizing the \nclear dispute of material fact created by the conflicting opinions of Mr. Smith and \nthe Township’s and Redevelopers’ representatives.  \n  \n36 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 45      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nissue, as well ignoring evidence presented by Residents’ experts as to how those \n8\nblighted conditions could be otherwise addressed though rehabilitation.  JA 399; \n#17-06, p. 17 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.)  \nIn addition, the Court misstated the law when it concluded that even if a \ndisparate impact had been shown, Residents “failed to offer sufficient evidence to \nrebut the Township’s legitimate governmental purpose or demonstrate illegitimate \ndiscriminatory intent.” JA 21; #114, p. 18 (SJ Op.).  First, as discussed above in \nPoint  I-A,  Rizzo  does  not  require  any  showing  of  “illegitimate  discriminatory \nintent” under a disparate impact claim. Second, under Rizzo, even if the Township \nhas a legitimate government purpose, that does not negate the Township’s burden \nof showing there are no less discriminatory alternatives.  \nThe  District  Court  additionally  misinterpreted  Title  VIII  by  inaccurately \ncharacterizing Residents’ argument that any action to “ameliorate a blighted area \ninhabited mostly by minorities” would not be permitted under Title VIII. JA 16; \n#114, p. 13 (SJ Op.). However, Residents have never argued that there must be \n                                                 \n8 In addition to Mr. Smith, Residents had also previously retained another planning \nexpert, Mr. Alan Mallach, AIA, AICP. In 2005, Mr. Mallach prepared two reports \nthat  the  Residents  submitted  as  comments  on  the  second  version  of  the \nredevelopment plan and he testified before the Township Planning Board at the \ntime they were reviewing that plan in February, 2005.  Mr. Mallach advised the \nBoard that there were many viable alternatives to total destruction of the Gardens \nthat  would  correct  the  blighted  conditions  identified  by  the  Township  in  the \nGardens.

Indeed,  as \nResidents’ experts had demonstrated in the record below, the Township could have \nused any one of several less discriminatory alternatives to eliminate blight than \ntotal demolition of the Gardens. \nAccordingly, the District Court’s erroneous analysis of law and evidence is \nfatally flawed and this Court should reverse the District Court’s grant of summary \njudgment dismissing Residents’ Title VIII disparate impact claims.  \n \nII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  GRANTING  THE \nTOWNSHIP  SUMMARY  JUDGMENT  DISMISSING \nRESIDENTS’ CLAIMS BECAUSE THERE ARE DISPUTED \nMATERIAL  FACTS  THAT  THE  TOWNSHIP  HAS \nINTENTIONALLY DISCRMINATED AGAINST AFRICAN-\nAMERICAN AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS. \n \nA.  The  Residents  Have  Presented  Circumstantial  Evidence \nMeeting  The  Arlington  Heights  Factors  Creating  Genuine \nFactual  Disputes  That  The  Township  Acted  With \nDiscriminatory Intent In Carrying Out Its Redevelopment Of \nThe Gardens Sufficient To Preclude Summary Judgment.  \n \nSeparate from the Title VIII disparate impact discrimination claim discussed \nabove  in  Point  I,  Residents  brought  three  additional  claims  asserting  that  the \nTownship has intentionally discriminated against them based on race and national \norigin in violation of Title VIII , 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., 42 U.S.C. §1982; and \nth\nequal  protection  under  of  14   Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution.  \n38 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 47      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nAlthough  these  claims  have  their  unique  elements,  proof  of  intentional \ndiscrimination is a critical component of each. See Village of Arlington Heights v. \nMetropolitan  Housing  Development  Corporation,  429  U.S.  252,  265-69  (1977) \n(“Arlington Heights”); see also Rizzo, supra,  546 F.2d at  140, 144-45. \n    In proving intentional discrimination, a plaintiff need not show “that the \nchallenged  action  rested  solely  on  racially  discriminatory  purposes.”  Arlington \nHeights, at 265.  Proof that purposeful discrimination was a “motivating factor” is \nsufficient. Arlington Heights, at 265-66.  See also Community Services, Inc. v. \nWind Gap Municipal Authority, 421 F.3d 170, 177 (3d Cir. 2005). \n Further,  direct  evidence  alone  is  not  required  to  establish  intentional \ndiscrimination, but rather ”demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial \nand direct evidence of intent as may be available.” Arlington Heights, at 266; \nth\nRizzo, at 141.

Id.  at  267-68.     The  Arlington \nHeights  factors  are  not  intended  to  be  “exhaustive”  and  a  plaintiff  need  not \nestablish each and every factor to show that racially discriminatory intent existed. \n                                                 \n9 Indeed, “blight” historically has been “a facially neutral term infused with racial \nand ethnic prejudice” that has been often used “to justify the removal of blacks and \nother minorities from certain parts of the city.”  Wendell E. Pritchett, The “Public \nMenace” of Blight, 21 Yale L. & Pol’y Rev. 1, 6 (2003).  See also  Kelo v.

Mindy  Thompson \nFullilove, Root Shock:  How Tearing Up City Neighborhoods Hurts America, and \nWhat We Can Do About It 17 (2004). \n \n10 The same Arlington Heights factors establishing intentional discrimination under \nequal protection are applicable as well to Residents’ claims under Title VIII and \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1866.

Compelling  adverse  disparate  impact  upon  African-\nAmerican and Hispanic residents.  \n \nThe “impact of the official action” and “whether it bears more heavily on \none  race  than  another”  is  the  “important  starting  point”  for  assessing \ndiscriminatory purpose.  Arlington Heights at 267-68.  In Reno v. Bossier Parish \nSchool  Bd.,  520  U.S.  471  (1997),  the  Court  explained  that  the  “impact  of  an \nofficial action is often probative of why the action was taken in the first place since \npeople usually intend the natural consequences of their action.” Id. at 487.  \nIn  Point  I,  Residents  compellingly  demonstrated  that  the  Township’s \nGardens  redevelopment  project  disproportionately  adversely  impacts  African-\nAmerican and Hispanic residents in the Township and County. These proofs are \nsufficient to infer discriminatory intent to defeat summary judgment and present \nthis issue for trial. See 2922 Sherman Ave. Tenants’Ass’n v. District of Columbia, \n444 F.3d 673, 682-85 (D.C. Cir. 2006); The Committee Concerning Community \nth\nImprovement v. City of Modesto, 583 F.3d 690, 702-06 (9  Cir. 2009).  \n2.  Historical  background  of  the  Gardens  redevelopment \nproject.  \n \nThe  Residents  also  presented  a  history  of  the  Gardens  community  that \ncreated inferences of discriminatory motives.  Township officials were fully aware \n41 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 50      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nof  the  demographics  of  the  neighborhood,  based  upon  observations  of  the \nneighborhood and the participation of Gardens residents at public meetings and \n11\nhearings.   One Township official stated that “the Gardens and the residents of the \nGardens were a matter of distaste, scorn, embarrassment, and neglect.” JA 2249, \n12\n#106-13, p.  1  (Boas  Memo)   As  discussed  in  Point  I-D  above,  officials  gave \nminimal support for community-led initiatives to revitalize the community, and as \nearly as 2000, before instituting any formal planning process to determine whether \nthe neighborhood was blighted, completely abandoned efforts to rehabilitate the \nGardens. JA 673-714, #17-17, pp. 1-42 (2000 Red. Rpt.); JA 1222-29, #17-35, pp. \n1-8 (Acq. Program Memo); JA 2134-4, #106-08, pp. 2-12 (Pipes SJ Dec.)  The \nTownship  even  repudiated  approximately  $2  million  it  received  through  state \nRegional Contribution Agreements that was expressly intended for rehabilitating \nlower-income homes in Mt. Holly. JA 2142, #106-18, p. 10 (Pipes SJ Dec.)  The \nTownship’s  refusal  to  seriously  consider  alternative  solutions  to  improve  the \nquality of life in the Gardens community and eliminate blight without displacing \nresidents  is  indicative  of  the  Township’s  intent  to  dismantle  and  destroy  this \nminority community.   \n                                                 \n11 JA 767-71, #17-20, p. 2-6 (9/16/02 Mtg. Min.); JA 874-931, 934-36,  #17-24, pp. \n8- 65, 68-70 (8/11/03 Mtg. Trans.).   \n \n12 Without benefit of discovery, Residents have not been able to confirm the author \nor  establish  the  date  of  this  memo  obtained  from  the  Township,  but  from  the \ncontext, it is assumed that it was written by then-council member Joan Boas.  \n42 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 51      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n3.  Sequence  of  events  leading  to  the  Township’s  decision  to \ndemolish the Gardens. \n \nThe  Residents  further  presented  circumstantial  evidence  showing  that \nseveral years before the redevelopment plan was adopted in 2003, the Township \nundertook a series of actions with discriminatory intent.  The Township began \nacquiring  residential  properties  through  tax  foreclosures  and  purposefully \nwarehousing the properties as vacant rather than returning the properties to the \nmarket. By the time that Township had declared the Gardens blighted in 2002, the \nTownship’s  own  vacant  properties  amounted  to  a  vacancy  rate  of  7%  – \n13\nexacerbating blighted conditions within the Gardens.  During this same time, the \nTownship also began reducing municipal services to residents. JA 557, #17-08, p. \n3 (Arocho Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 576-77, #17-09, pp. 3-4 (Brooks Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA \n2138, 2140-41, 2143, 2147, #106-08, pp. 6, 8-9, 11, 15 (Pipes SJ Dec.). \n                                                 \n13  In  2000,  the  Gardens  had  a  vacancy  rate  of  14%,  with  most  of  the  vacant \nproperties were privately owned.. JA 677, 704-14, #17-19, pp. 5, 32-42 (2000 Red. \nRpt).  By 2002, the vacancy rate had risen to 18%. JA 777, #17-21, p. 5 (2002 Red. \nRpt.) While the Township’s redevelopment studies blame the vacancies on the \nprevalence of absentee owners and deterioration of properties, the 2002 Report \nacknowledges that the Township had acquired 23 units of the 327 units in the \nGardens, or 7%, and had kept these units vacant. JA 781, #17-21, p. 9.  In addition, \nResidents submitted a memo obtained from the Township entitled “Mount Holly \nGardens Acquisition Program” which admits that the Township was considering a \nplan to purchase and demolish 15 units in anticipation of future redevelopment, \nand  recognized  that  acquiring  and  “banking”  properties  would  reduce  future \nrelocation costs. JA 1224, #17-35, p. 8. (Acq. Prog. Memo).  Although the memo \nis undated, the context makes clear it was written after 1999 and before early 2001. \nJA 1223, #17-35, p. 7.  Without benefit of discovery, Residents do not have more \ninformation regarding the author or other circumstances surrounding the memo. \n43 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 52      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nFurther,  many  Gardens  residents  had  strongly  voiced  concerns  at  public \nhearings that they feared they would be forced out of their community. JA 767-71, \n#17-20, p. 2-6 (9/16/02 Mtg. Min.); JA 914- 931, #17-24, pp. 10-65 (8/11/03 Mtg. \nTrans.).  In order to reduce opposition to the redevelopment project, Township \nofficials  gave  residents  false  assurances  –  first,  that    that  the  project  did  not \nnecessarily involve eminent domain,  and later, when the plan was unveiled, that \nthe plan was developed with residents’ interests in mind, that residents would not \nbe displaced from the community, and would be provided replacement housing. JA \n767, 772, #17-20, pp. 2, 7 (9/16/02 Mtg. Min.); JA 871-72, 934, 936, 938, 941-43, \n#17-24, pp. 5-6, 68, 70, 72, 75-77 (8/11/08 Mtg. Trans.).  While residents testified \nabout the diverse minority composition of the Gardens, the Township specifically \ntargeted the Gardens – the neighborhood with the highest concentration of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic residents – as the only neighborhood slated for drastic and \ndestructive redevelopment in the Township.   JA 771, #17-20, p. 6 (9/16/02 Mtg. \nMin.); JA 911, 923, #17-24, pp. 47, 57 (8/11/03 Mtg. Trans.); JA 997, 1000, #17-\n27,  pp.  17,  24,  (9/21/05  Mtg.  Trans.);  JA  1022,  #17-28,  p.  4-5  (3/14/05  Mtg. \nTrans.); JA 1253, #17-36, p. 24 (Master Plan).   \n4.  Township’s  disregard  of  procedural  norms  under  state \nredevelopment law  \nThe  Residents’  evidence  further  demonstrates  that  the  Township  did  not \nconduct  this  redevelopment  planning  process  in  an  open,  transparent  process \n44 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 53      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nconsistent with all requirements of the LRHL, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et. seq.  The \nLRHL  mandates  that  a  municipal  governing  body  must  first  pass  a  resolution \nauthorizing its planning board to conduct a preliminary study to determine whether \nblight criteria are met. N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-6(a). The planning board must then hold \npublic hearings regarding its blight findings. N.J.S.A 40A:12:A-6(b).  The LRHL \nfurther mandates that “[n]o redevelopment project shall be undertaken or carried \nout” until after the planning board hearing process is completed, the governing \nbody formally declares the area blighted, and then adopts by ordinance after public \ncomment a redevelopment plan. N.J.S.A 40A:12:A-7(a). See generally, Gallenthin \nRealty Development, Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, 191 N.J. 344, 924 A.2d \n447 (2007).   \nIn this case, however, in 2000 the Township Council conducted its own \nblight study out of public view, without the required referral to the planning board \nand  without  any  public  hearings.  Although  the  Township  Council  eventually \n“cured” its failure to comply with the LRHL’s procedures two years later in 2002 \nby passing the required resolution authorizing the planning board to conduct the \n“preliminary study,” by that time the Township had in effect already begun to \nimplement  its  redevelopment  agenda  contrary  to  the  LRHL  by  acquiring  and \nwarehousing vacant properties in the Gardens, as discussed above. JA 2175, #106-\n45 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 54      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n14\n12, p. 1 (Res. 2002-166).  \n In addition, the Township and Redevelopers proceeded with relocation in a \nmanner deviating from state law.  They submitted a relocation plan that contained \nsignificant inconsistencies with the redevelopment plan then in effect, such as the \ndiscrepancies as to number of units to be built in the redeveloped community, and \nthat  failed  to  provide  meaningful  information  about  the  opportunities  for \n15\nreplacement housing.   Without instituting condemnation proceedings or giving \nresidents  notice  to  vacate  that  would  trigger  eligibility  for  relocation,  as \ncontemplated by N.J.A.C. 5:11-2.1(a), the Township picked an arbitrary date of \nAugust 1, 2006 to trigger eligibility for relocation assistance. JA 1043, #17-29, p. 9 \n(WRAP).  As  a  result,  the  Township  did  not  provide  assistance  to  the \napproximately 92 resident households who had moved out prior to August, 2006, \nwhile offering relocation to those willing to move in anticipation of eventually \n                                                 \n14\n  Residents are not relitigating this issue decided in state court, but rather use \nthese facts to demonstrate that the Township’s procedures were unusual.  \n \n15 The redevelopment plan called for 228 new units, while the WRAP anticipated \n520 units. JA 962, #17-26, p. 9; (WR Red. Plan); JA 560, #17-29, p. 6 (WRAP). \nWhile  the  WRAP  contained  a  provision  regarding  first  refusal  for  newly \nconstructed  units,  it  never  specified  whether  any  of  the  new  units  would  be \nrealistically affordable to Gardens residents or available prior to displacement, nor \ndid it warn residents that if they needed relocation benefits to make the initial \nmove out of the Gardens, they would receive no further assistance to enable them \nto buy a replacement unit. JA 145-46, #17-26, p.11-12. \n \n46 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 55      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n16\nbeing forced out through eminent domain.   \nThis  evidence  regarding  deviations  from  procedural  norms  supports  an \ninference that although the Township was outwardly going through the motions of \nconducting public hearings and complying with relocation requirements, it had  \nprivately  decided  to  dismantle  the  Gardens  neighborhood  and  displace  its  \npredominately minority residents from the municipality.   \n5.  Township’s departure from substantive planning norms.   \nOne of redevelopment’s stated goals is “promoting the physical development \nthat will be most conducive to the social and economic improvement of the State \nand its several municipalities.”  N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-2. See,  Gallenthin, supra.  As \ndiscussed  under  Point  I-D,  the  record  demonstrates  that  instead  of  using  the \nredevelopment  process  to  advance  this  goal,  the  Township  officials  selected  a \nmethod of redeveloping the community that is most harmful to residents and most \ncostly to the taxpayers and general public. Their refusal to consider less destructive \nalternatives is contrary to “responsible and reasonable Township planning process, \nin  accordance  with  sound,  comprehensive,  professional  and  ethical  planning \nprinciples,” JA 2386. #106-30, p. 20, and thus a departure from substantive norms.  \nFurthermore, even assuming that the Township had no choice but to pursue \n                                                 \n16 According to the 2002 Study, there were 269 households living in the Gardens, \nwhile the WRAP states there were 177 households remaining in 2006. JA 777, \n#17-21, p. 5; JA 1039, #17-29, p. 5. \n47 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 56      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\ntotal acquisition and demolition of the Gardens, the Residents presented ample \nevidence illustrating how the Township’s timing and manner in implementing the \nplan also constituted a departure from substantive norms. Instead of preserving the \nneighborhood until residents could be relocated and building replacement houses \nfor existing residents before their housing was demolished, the Township chose to \nstart  aggressively  acquiring  and  demolishing    properties    while  the  Gardens \nneighborhood was still intact, several years before actually needing the land  where \nthe occupied homes stood. JA 2254, #106-20, p. 1 (9/9/08 Twp. Press Rel.); JA \n2389-90, #106-30, pp. 23-24 (Smith SJ Dec.)   \n  The  Residents’  expert  also  established  that  the  Township  conducted \ndemolitions that were either not necessary or required solely due to Township’s \nown failure to properly secure and maintain its vacant properties. JA 392, 396, 398 \n#17-06, pp. 10, 14, 16 (Smith Pr. Inj. Dec.); JA 2374-75, #106-30, pp. 7-8 (Smith \nSJ Dec.). Further, the demolitions were disruptive, and caused damage to adjoining \n17\nhouses and removal of sidewalks.   After demolishing the homes, the Township \ndid  not  properly  even  seal  the  roofs  and  newly  exposed  exterior  walls  of  the \n                                                 \n17 JA 398, #17-06, p. 16 (Smith Pr.

The Township took advantage \nof this situation by pressuring residents to sell their homes at deflated prices that \ndid not represent fair market value, and were insufficient to purchase a replacement \nhouse  in  the  surrounding  area,  ensuring  that  most  Gardens  residents  would be \n20\nforced to move out of the Township.  At the same time, the increasingly blighted \nconditions the Township created in the Gardens gave residents little incentive to \n21\ninvest in their properties and added pressure on them to move.  As a result, the \nTownship succeeded in displacing  approximately 169 households even without \n                                                 \n18JA 2130- 31, #106-07, pp. 3-4 (Cruz SJ Dec.); JA 2375- 79, #106-30, pp. 9-13 \n(Smith SJ Dec.). \n  \n19 JA 591-606, #17-10, pp. 8-23 (Cruz Pr.

Such  behavior  of  governmental \nofficials towards their constituents must by all standards of civil decency be a \ndeviation from the norm sufficient to infer discriminatory purpose.   \nB.  Evidence  Of  The  Foreseeable  Results  Of  The  Township’s  Actions \nSupport  A  Finding  Of  Intent  And  Creates  A  Sufficient  Material \nFactual Dispute To Render Summary Judgment Inappropriate. \n  The Supreme Court has recognized the probative value of evidence that a \ndefendant acted with knowledge of the likely result of its action as a means of \nproving discriminatory purpose.  While it is true that voluntary acts and \"awareness \nof  consequences\"  alone  do  not  necessitate  a  finding  of  discriminatory  intent, \nPersonnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979), \n\"actions having foreseeable and anticipated disparate impact are relevant evidence \nto prove the ultimate fact, forbidden purpose.” Columbus Board of Education v. \nPenick, 443 U.S. 449, 464 (1979). See also, Ammons v. Dade County, 783 F.2d \nth th\n982 (11  Cir. 1986); Dowdell v. City of Apopka, 698 F.2d 1181 (11  Cir. 1983).  \nAs discussed above, Township officials knew that the Gardens was a diverse \n                                                 \n22  JA 777, #17-21, p. 5 (2000 Red. Rpt); JA 1372, #30-02, p. 2 (Hoffman Pr. Inj. \nDec.).    \n50 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 59      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nlow-income community with a high proportion of African-American and Hispanic \nresidents  who  would  have  difficulty  in  finding  affordable  housing  within  the \nTownship.    Residents  have  thus  shown  that  the  discriminatory  effects  of  the \nTownship’s  actions  –  removal  of  low  income  minority  population  from  the \nTownship – were undeniably foreseeable,  \nC.  The  District  Court  Misapplied  Summary  Judgment \nStandards  by  Ignoring  Material  Facts  In  Dispute, \nImpermissibly  Weighing  The  Evidence,  And  Erroneously \nDrawing Inferences In Favor Of The Township As Moving \nParty Rather Than In Favor of Residents.   \n  The Court erroneously stated that the Residents had failed to support their \nclaims  with  any  documentary  evidence,  ignoring  the  volumes  of  Township \ndocuments such as Transcripts, resolutions, ordinances, reports, plans, and internal \nmemos that the Residents had proffered into evidence, cited throughout this brief. \nJA 24, #114, p. 21 (SJ Op.). The Court incorrectly contended, for example, that the \nResidents’ claims that the Township lowered the prices of the Gardens homes \nthrough its redevelopment activities and pressured them to sell at less than fair \nmarket value were based upon “opinions” and “beliefs” set forth in “conclusory, \nself-serving affidavits.” JA 24, #114, p. 21, fn. 15 (SJ Op.).  The Court ignored the \nTownship’s own appraisal report that contained an unambiguous admission that \nthat the Township’s redevelopment project was adversely affecting property values \nand making it impossible to sell Gardens homes on the private market.  It was this \n51 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 60      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nappraisal which served as the basis for the Township’s valuation of the homes, and \nas  the  sale  price  for  the  unit  in  question  was  determined  based  upon  the \nTownship’s recent acquisitions of other Gardens homes, this valuation that would \nclearly not constitute just compensation in a condemnation proceeding. Village of \nSouth Orange v. Alden Corp., 71 N.J. 362, 367-68, 365 A.2d 469 (1976); Jersey \n23\nCity Red. Agency v. Kugler, 58 N.J. 374, 277 A.2d 833 (1971).   \nNext, the Court improperly concluded that residents were being successfully \nrelocated.  It impermissibly relied on its prior findings in its Preliminary Injunction \nOpinion to conclude that residents were “pleased” with their new homes, enjoyed  \nimproved living situations, and were  even better off financially.  JA 25, #114, p. \n22, fn. 16 (SJ Op.).  These findings were presumably based on the Certification of \nMs.  Marcia  Holt,  an  employee  of  Keating,  submitted  in  opposition  to  the \nPreliminary  Injunction  Motion.  Ms.  Holt’s  self-serving  characterizations  of \nGardens residents’ motives for moving and their attitudes toward their new place \n                                                 \n23 The Township’s appraisal stated that “market values in the Mount Holly Gardens \nneighborhood have declined during recent years because approximately half of the \nunits are vacant and boarded up. As the units are acquired by the Township, and \nthe revitalization project gets closer to its start date, the primary market for the \navailable units will be the Township.”  JA 593, #17-10, p. 10.  The appraisal \nfurther noted an “adverse site condition” – “[A]s mentioned throughout this report, \nthe  subject  neighborhood  is  part  of  a  Township  revitalization  program.  \nApproximately half of the units in the Mount Holly Gardens neighborhood are \nboarded up and vacant. The neighborhood is no longer attractive or feasible for \nfuture homebuyers and/or investors.” JA 593, #17-10, p. 10.  \n \n52 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 61      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n24\nof residence is pure hearsay.  F.R.E. 801, 802. Furthermore, Ms. Holt provided \nonly  anecdotal  evidence  regarding  selected  residents,  and while  she  mentioned \nthere were a few instances where the household’s monthly housing costs remained \nthe same or decreased, she did not ever discuss whether any homeowners were \n 25\nforced to assume significant new debt in order to relocate.   \nFurthermore, while accepting Ms. Holt’s testimony at face value, the District \nCourt  ignored  evidence  that  raised  clear  factual  disputes  as  to  whether  the \nrelocation  was  successful  and  whether  residents  were  “pleased,”  including  the \nDeclaration of a former Gardens resident, Ms. Alandia Warthen, and the Report of \nthe New Jersey Public Advocate. JA 626-630, #17-13, pp. 1-6; JA 1688-1731, #54-\n                                                 \n24\n  While  evidentiary  standards  may  be  relaxed  for  purposes  of  preliminary \ninjunction motions, these statements were not competent evidence and should not \nhave been considered for purposes of summary judgment. Kos Pharmaceuticals v. \nAndrx Corporation, 369 F.3d 700 (3d Cir 2004). \n \n25 The only direct evidence of former residents’ satisfaction with their new living \narrangement is one Certification formerly submitted by the Township in state court \nproceedings made by a tenant made in 2007 shortly after relocating to a new unit, \nand  even  that  statement  contains  no  information  about  whether  the  tenant’s \nhousing costs and general financial circumstances changed after moving from the \nGardens. JA 2559-2562, #112-03, pp. 77-80 (Bryant Cert.). The Township also \nsubmitted  one  hearsay  document,  a  letter  from  a  Gardens  property  owner \nexpressing interest in selling her property to the Township, and again offering no \ninformation about her circumstances after relocation. JA 2563-64; #112-03, pp. 81-\n82 (Brito Letter).   \n \n53 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 62      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\n26\n02, pp. 1-44 (NJ Publ. Adv. Rpt)    Finally, the Court accepted without question \nthe Township’s representation that residents who wanted to remain in Mount Holly \nwere able to do so.  JA 25, #114, p. 22, fn. 16 (SJ Op.).  At the same time, it \nignored all of the evidence submitted by Residents to the contrary, including the \nstatistical data that showed that two-thirds of the displaced residents were relocated \noutside  of  the  Township,  the  resident  surveys  and  public  meeting  Transcripts \nwhere Gardens residents expressed a strong desire to remain in the neighborhood, \nthe expert testimony regarding the shortage of affordable housing in the region, \nand  the  Declarations  of  Gardens  residents  describing  their  limited  income  and \n27\ndifficulty in finding affordable housing in the Township.   \n  The Court also erroneously characterized the testimony before the Council \nand  Planning  Board  in  an  unjustifiably  favorable  light  for  the  benefit  of  the \n                                                 \n26\n The NJ Public Advocate Report is admissible pursuant to F.R.E. 803(8) as a \npublic record or report of a public agency setting forth factual findings resulting \nfrom an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law.  \n \n27 JA 67-68, 71-75,  #17-04, pp. 12-13, 16-20 (Beveridge Pr.

The Court inferred without basis that Township officials “welcomed \nand encouraged” residents’ input, even though the public hearings in question were \n29\nmandated by the LRHL, N.J.S.A 40A:12A-6, 7. JA 26, #114, p. 23 (SJ Op.)   The \nCourt further assumed that the Township officials acted out of “significant concern \nfor the Gardens residents’ welfare” JA 27, #114, p. 24 (SJ Op.), accepting at face \nvalue  their  self-serving  statements,  while  completely  ignoring  the  evidence \npresented by the Residents that showed these statements were directly contradicted \nby  the  officials’  actions,  as  discussed  in  detail  above.  Similarly,  the  Court \ninterpreted the Township’s revisions of the redevelopment plan to mean that the \nTownship was interested in public input, JA 28, #114, p. 25 (SJ Op.). The District \nCourt ignored evidence that the Redevelopers had prepared “concept plans” upon \nwhich the revisions were based, ignoring residents’ concerns, and the Court failed \n                                                 \n28 JA 26, #114, p. 23 (SJ Opinion); JA 914- 931, #17-24, pp. 10-65 (8/11/03 Mtg. \nTrans.);  JA 996-1010,  #17-27, pp. 16-30 (2/21/05 Mtg.

THE  COURT  BELOW  ERRED  IN  GRANTING  SUMMARY \nJUDGMENT  WITHOUT  ALLOWING  RESIDENTS \nREASONABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCOVERY. \n \nF.R.C.P.  56(c),  governing  summary  judgment,  provides  for  the  entry  of \nsummary  judgment,  after  adequate  time  for  discovery.  Celotex  Corporation  v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986) (emphasis added).  Where the party opposing the \nmotion demonstrates that for specified reasons it is unable to present facts essential \nto its opposition, the court is obligated to deny the motion, order a continuance for \nappropriate discovery or provide another just order.  F.R.C.P 56(d); Bradley v. \nUnited States, 299 F.2d 197, 206-07 (3d. Cir  2002). See also F.R.C.P 12(d).    \n  The  Residents  were  most  significantly  prejudiced  by  lack  of  discovery \nregarding their intentional discrimination claims, as these involve the state of mind \nof municipal actors and critical facts exclusively within the Township’s knowledge \nand  control.  Although  Residents  presented  sufficient  proofs  of  circumstantial \nevidence under the Arlington Heights test, as discussed above, Residents were \ndenied  opportunity  for  discovery  of  direct  evidence  from  the  Township.  The \nDistrict Court‘s reason for  denying discovery, that it doubted that a Township \n56 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 65      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nofficial would ever admit to racial animus in a deposition, is in direct contradiction \n 30\nto F.R.C. P 26(b).  JA 24-25, #114, p. 21-22 (SJ Op.).  \nThe  District  Court  also  erroneously  decided  that  discovery  was  not \nwarranted  because  the  Residents  had  already  been  in  litigation  over  the \nredevelopment  plan  for  several  years  and  could  obtain  certain  Township \ndocuments  through  Open  Public  Records  requests,  even  though  the  scope  of \ndiscovery is far wider than that of public information requests. United States v. \nWeber Aircraft Corp., 465 U.S. 792, 803 (1984).  JA 9-10, #114, p. 6-7 (SJ Op.).  \n  Finally, the District Court summarily concluded that no discovery “appeared \ncalculated  or  even  remotely  likely  to  provide  the  missing  proofs,”  without \ndiscussing the specific discovery proposed in Residents’ Rule 56 Declaration. JA \n29, #114, p.26 (SJ Op.).  The District Court’s ruling is inconsistent with Rule 26 \nand Rule 56 and mandates reversal of summary judgment.  \nCONCLUSION \n \n  For  all  the  foregoing  reasons,  it  is  respectfully  requested  that  the  Order \ngranting Appellees summary judgment be reversed, and the matter be remanded \nfor discovery and a plenary trial.  \n \n                                                 \n30 As explained in the Resident’s Rule 56(f) Declaration, no discovery had been \nconducted in this case. JA 2424-31, #106-41, pp. 1-8.   Indeed, during the two and \na half years the matter was in litigation, the Defendants had never even answered \nthe Complaint.   \n57 \n \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110545952     Page: 66      Date Filed: 05/27/2011\nDated:  May 27, 2011    Respectfully submitted, \n          By:  /s/ Olga D.

The\nsupplemental briefing is completed, and the remaining claims that\n1 The other five counts were dismissed.  Since this case was\nfiled over two years ago, it has been extensively litigated with\nseveral hearings, the denial of a TRO and preliminary injunction,\nthe filing of a second amended complaint, and the issuance of\nnumerous written Opinions.  Litigation over the Gardens\nredevelopment also precedes this case in New Jersey state court. \nOverall, the concerns of several Gardens residents have caused\nthe dispute over the blighted neighborhood’s redevelopment plan\nto spend ten years in the courts.  \n2\n0005\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 31/91 1        PDaagtee  F3i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15068\nare now ready for final resolution are plaintiffs’ claims for\nviolations of Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (the\nFair Housing Act or FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. (Count One\nagainst all defendants); the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1982 (Count Two against the Township); the Equal Protection\nClause of the U.S. Constitution, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §\n1983 (Count Three against the Township); and Equal Protection\nClause of the New Jersey State Constitution (Count Five against\nthe Township), as well a claim for punitive damages.  \nAs this Court previously expressed on several occasions, we\nrecognize that the Gardens redevelopment has had an effect on\nlow-income families, and, correspondingly, minority families. \nThe Court also recognizes that being forced from one’s home is a\ndifficult and emotional issue, compounded by the fear of being\nunable to afford a comparable place to live.  However, as the\nCourt has also expressed previously, plaintiffs have failed to\ndemonstrate that the Township, or the entities assisting the\nTownship in the redevelopment and relocation services, has\nimplemented a plan that has a disparate impact on the Gardens\nresidents as the law defines it.  Nor have they shown that the\ndefendants have not been proceeding pursuant to a legitimate\ngovernmental interest in the least restrictive way, or have\notherwise acted with discriminatory intent.  Consequently, as\nexplained more fully below, defendants’ motions will be granted,\n3\n0006\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/01 1        PDaagtee  F4i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15069\nand the case will be closed.\nDISCUSSION2\nA. Standard for Summary Judgment\nSummary judgment is appropriate where the Court is satisfied\nthat “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\nthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 330 (1986); Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c).  \nAn issue is “genuine” if it is supported by evidence such\nthat a reasonable jury could return a verdict in the nonmoving\nparty’s favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n248 (1986).  A fact is “material” if, under the governing\nsubstantive law, a dispute about the fact might affect the\noutcome of the suit.  Id.  In considering a motion for summary\njudgment, a district court may not make credibility\ndeterminations or engage in any weighing of the evidence;\ninstead, the non-moving party's evidence “is to be believed and\nall justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.”  Marino\nv. Industrial Crating Co., 358 F.3d 241, 247 (3d Cir.\n2004)(quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 255).\n2 Because the background and procedural history have been\nlaid out in the Court’s previous Opinions, they will not be\nrestated here.\n4\n0007\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/11 1        PDaagtee  F5i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15070\nInitially, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Once the moving party has\nmet this burden, the nonmoving party must identify, by affidavits\nor otherwise, specific facts showing that there is a genuine\nissue for trial.  Id.  Thus, to withstand a properly supported\nmotion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must identify\nspecific facts and affirmative evidence that contradict those\noffered by the moving party.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256-57.  A\nparty opposing summary judgment must do more than just rest upon\nmere allegations, general denials, or vague statements.  Saldana\nv. Kmart Corp., 260 F.3d 228, 232 (3d Cir. 2001).\nB. Analysis\n1. Count One - Fair Housing Act\nThis Court has already analyzed plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act\nclaim substantively in the context of plaintiffs’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction.  That analysis was adopted in the Court’s\nmost recent Opinion, which converted defendants’ motions to\ndismiss into ones for summary judgment.  That analysis found that\nplaintiffs had not demonstrated that the redevelopment has had a\ndisparate impact on a protected group, or that defendants did not\nhave a legitimate interest in the redevelopment, or that no\nalternative course of action would have a lesser impact. \nRecognizing that plaintiffs’ Fair Housing Act claim had only been\n5\n0008\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/21 1        PDaagtee  F6i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15071\nconsidered in the context of a preliminary injunction, the Court\nafforded plaintiffs time to gather specific facts to show a\ngenuine issue for trial on these issues.  The Court now affirms\nits prior decision on plaintiffs’ FHA claim because plaintiffs\nhave not provided the requisite proof to take the issues to a\njury.\nAs a preliminary matter, plaintiffs argue that they should\nbe afforded time for discovery, and are prejudiced in their\nability to oppose the converted motions because of the lack of\ndiscovery.  Plaintiffs contend that they require a look into the\ndefendants’ state of mind and intentions, as well as documents\nthat are only within the control of defendants and, thus,\nunavailable to plaintiffs.  Without this information, plaintiffs\nargue that summary judgment is premature, which is further\nevidenced by the fact that defendants have not even filed their\nanswers to plaintiffs’ complaint.\nAlthough the Court recognizes the peculiar procedural\nhistory that has led to the resolution of summary judgment\nmotions without the filing of answers or the undertaking of\nformal discovery, this is not a case where plaintiffs are\nneophytes filing an initial challenge to the Gardens\nredevelopment plan.  Not only has there been extensive\nproceedings over two years in this Court, most of these issues\nhave been thoroughly litigated in New Jersey state court over the\n6\n0009\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/31 1        PDaagtee  F7i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15072\ncourse of several years preceding this case.3  As pointed out by\ndefendants, plaintiffs have already had the ability to obtain the\ninformation they seek through Open Public Records Act requests,\nas well as through the previous state court litigation.  Further,\nmuch of the information is available by other means, including\nfrom the residents themselves or the Public Advocate, who\nundertook an investigation of the Township’s relocation\npractices.4 \nMoreover, plaintiffs do not specifically identify what\ninformation defendants hold to support their claims, and instead\nrequest discovery generally, such as depositions of key officials\nin order to acquire testimony as to their intent to “rid [the\nTownship] of a minority community.”  (Pomar Cert., Docket No.\n106-41) (“Residents are severely prejudiced by being unable to\nprobe, at a deposition, the attitudes, intent, and motives of the\nTownship officials who made the critical decisions to pursue the\nGardens redevelopment project.”).  Discovery, however, cannot\nserve as a fishing expedition through which plaintiffs search for\n3 The Court recognizes that the state court case was more\nnarrow than this one, and the civil rights claims had been\ndismissed as unripe, but none of the discovery plaintiffs contend \nthey need here to supplement the discovery from the state court\nlitigation would save their otherwise deficient claims.\n4 In the Court’s February 13, 2009 Opinion, the Court\nconsidered and referenced the Public Advocate’s report, which was\nprovided by plaintiffs pursuant to the Court’s November 25, 2008\nOrder granting plaintiffs’ request to supplement the record with\nthe report.\n7\n0010\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/41 1        PDaagtee  F8i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15073\nevidence to support conclusory speculations.  Giovanelli v. D.\nSimmons General Contracting, 2010 WL 988544, *5 (D.N.J. 2010). \nFurther, such depositions may be barred by a privilege afforded\nto decision-making government officials.  See, e.g., U.S. v.\nSensient Colors, Inc., 649 F. Supp. 2d 309, 316 (D.N.J. 2009).5   \n5 Indeed, in addressing the same argument by plaintiffs in\nthe earlier state court litigation, Judge Sweeney explained, \nThere are many reasons why discovery is the\nexception rather than the rule in actions\nsuch as this one.  First, a public official’s\nstate of mind is rarely an issue and can\nusually be determined from the record below. \nThere are transcripts, tapes, minutes and the\nlike.  Secondly, and no less important, is\nthe consideration that members of the\nmunicipal governing bodies and local boards\nserve without significant remuneration.  They\nwould be far less likely to serve if their\nofficial actions frequently subjected them to\nthe arduous discovery process. \nInterrogatories would have to be answered and\ndepositions attended after usual hours of\npublic service.  It would place a chilling\neffect on public service.  \nHere, I am convinced that the discovery\nsought would burden the officials involved to\na degree that would be totally\ndisproportionate to any usable information\nthat could be recovered.  Furthermore, there\nhas already been one hearing in this matter. \nAlthough I limited plaintiffs to two expert\nwitnesses, I also afforded them the right to\ncall township officials to testify.  They\nelected, for whatever reason, not to do so. \nFollowing that hearing, I determined that the\ndesignation of the Gardens as an area in need\nof redevelopment had substantial credible\nsupport in the record, was a designation made\nin accordance with statutory criteria, and I\nfound no evidence of racial or ethnic bias or\nanimus in the testimony of . . . the town\n8\n0011\n\nCaseC a1s:0e8: -1c1v--10125598 4  - N DLoHc-uJmS e  nDt:o 0c0u3m1e1n0t5 141549 5  3 F  i le  dP a0g1e/0: 32/51 1        PDaagtee  F9i loefd 2: 80 5P/a2g7e/2ID01: 15074\n \nOverriding all these points with specific reference to\nplaintiffs’ FHA claim, however, is that in order to prove their\nclaim, none of the discovery plaintiffs claim they lack would\nsave their allegations, as plaintiffs must present their own\nproof of disparate impact and a more-viable alternative.  Stated\nseveral times before, Section 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act\nmakes it unlawful to “refuse to sell or rent after the making of\na bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or\nrental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to\nany person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial\nstatus, or national origin.”  42 U.S.C. § 3604(a) (emphasis\nadded).  The FHA can be violated by either intentional\ndiscrimination or if a practice has a disparate impact on a\nprotected class.  Community Services, Inc. v. Wind Gap Mun.\nAuthority, 421 F.3d 170, 176 (3d Cir. 2005).  \nPlaintiffs here contend that the Gardens redevelopment plan\nhas a disparate impact on the minorities living in the Gardens. \nIn order to prove their claim, plaintiffs must first establish a\nprima facie case of disparate impact.

Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v.\nZoning Bd. of Adjustment of Tp. of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442,\n466-67 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nIf a plaintiff establishes his prima facie case, the burden\nshifts to the defendant to demonstrate justification.  The\n“justification must serve, in theory and practice, a legitimate,\nbona fide interest of the Title VIII defendant, and the defendant\nmust show that no other alternative course of action could be\nadopted that would enable that interest to be served with less\ndiscriminatory impact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Finally, “[i]f\nthe defendant does introduce evidence that no such alternative\ncourse of action can be adopted, the burden will once again shift\nto the Plaintiff to demonstrate that other practices are\navailable.”  Id. at 149 n.37.  “If the Title VIII prima facie\ncase is not rebutted, a violation is proved.”  Id. at 149.\nThus, it is plaintiffs’ burden to show disparate impact, and\nif they do, it is their burden to rebut the Township’s position6\nand demonstrate a more-viable alternative course of action. \nPlaintiffs have done neither.  \nTo support disparate impact, plaintiffs argue that the\n6 In the October 23, 2009 Opinion, the Court found that the\nTownship had already met its burden based on the record before\nthe Court at that time.  As explained more fully herein,\nplaintiffs’ supplemental briefing does not demonstrate a material\nissue of fact regarding the Township’s legitimate interest and\nalternative choices.\n10\n0013\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 2/171        P Daagtee  1F1il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5076\nredevelopment more negatively affects minorities in Mt. Holly\nthan non-minority residents because the redevelopment is driving\nout the minority population of Mt. Holly.  Plaintiffs also argue\nthat the redevelopment plan has a disparate impact on minorities\nbecause the plan is targeted at an area that is populated by\nmostly minorities.  To support their position, plaintiffs had\npreviously presented a report of a demographic and statistical\nexpert, Andrew A. Beveridge, Ph.D.  Dr. Beveridge opined that the\nredevelopment of the Gardens effectively and significantly\nreduces the minority population in Mt. Holly.  \nThe Court had rejected that proof.  The Court explained, \nEven though plaintiffs have pointed out that the\nredevelopment of the Gardens has reduced the minority\npopulation of Mt. Holly, they have not accounted for\nhow many minorities will move into the new housing. \nFurthermore, and more importantly for the plaintiffs’\nFHA claim of disparate impact, the redevelopment plan\ndoes not apply differently to minorities than non-\nminorities.  Several plaintiffs classify themselves as\n“white,” yet the plan affects them in the exact same\nway as their minority neighbors.  The real effect of\nthe Gardens redevelopment is that there will be less\nlower-income housing in Mt. Holly.  Although the\nTownship may have some obligation with regard to\nproviding a certain number of low-income housing\npursuant to other law, the reduction of low-income\nhousing is not a violation of the FHA.  The FHA\nprohibits the Township from making unavailable a\ndwelling to any person because of race--it does not\nspeak to income.  Redevelopment of blighted, low-income\nhousing is not, without more, a violation of the FHA. \nHere, where fourteen homes are occupied by African-\nAmerican plaintiffs, thirteen homes are occupied by\nHispanic plaintiffs, and six homes are occupied by\n“white” plaintiffs, and all are affected in the same\nway by the redevelopment, the Court cannot find, on the\ncurrent record at this preliminary injunction stage,\n11\n0014\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 2/181        P Daagtee  1F2il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5077\nthat plaintiffs will succeed on their disparate impact\nFHA claim. \n(Feb. 13, 2009 Op. at 7-8.)\nIn their opposition to the converted motions, plaintiffs\npresent the same statistics, and further argue that there is\ndisparate impact on minorities because the displaced plaintiffs\nwill not be able to afford the new $200,000+ homes, or the $1,300\nto rent these same properties.7  As explained before, however, if\nnone of the plaintiffs can afford the new homes, it is not just\nthe African-American and Hispanic plaintiffs who are impacted by\nthe increased housing prices--it is all Gardens residents,\nincluding the Caucasian residents.8  Additionally, as also\nexplained before, plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the\nTownship is preventing minorities from purchasing or moving into\nthe new homes, or otherwise limiting the new residents to non-\nminorities.  Plaintiffs have not provided any proof or statistics\nto suggest that the new homes created by the redevelopment will\nbe financially out-of-reach for all or most minorities.9     \n7 Although 464 units will be market rate, 56 will be deed-\nrestricted affordable housing units.\n8 Relatedly, plaintiffs argue that because a greater\npercentage of minority Township residents have been affected by\nthe redevelopment they have demonstrated a disparate impact. \nEven if this statistic was sufficient to establish a prima facie\ncase, plaintiffs’ FHA claim fails for reasons other than the\ndisparate impact analysis.  \n9Plaintiffs present statistics that only 21% of African-\nAmerican and Hispanic households in Burlington County would be\n12\n0015\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 2/191        P Daagtee  1F3il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5078\nFurthermore, under plaintiffs’ logic, any action by the\nTownship to do anything with regard to the Gardens would result\nin a disparate impact, simply because of the racial composition\nof the Gardens.  The FHA (or any other civil rights law) does not\ncontemplate that a town will never be permitted to ameliorate a\nblighted area inhabited mainly by minorities simply because it\nwill affect minorities.  See, e.g., City of Memphis v. Greene,\n451 U.S. 100, 128 (1981) (“Because urban neighborhoods are so\nfrequently characterized by a common ethnic or racial heritage, a\nregulation's adverse impact on a particular neighborhood will\noften have a disparate effect on an identifiable ethnic or racial\ngroup.  To regard an inevitable consequence of that kind as a\nform of stigma so severe as to violate the Thirteenth Amendment\nable to afford the new houses, because that percentage of\nAfrican-American and Hispanic population earns above 80% of the\nmedian income ($44,580).  (Bev. Cert., Ex. B-2, Docket No. 106-\n4.)  This is in contrast to 79% of white Burlington County\nresidents who earn above 80% of the median income.  (Id.)  These\nstatistics hold little validity to show a disparate impact on the\nTownship’s minority population for several reasons: (1) they take\ninto account the entire population of Burlington County, rather\nthan only Mt. Holly Township, and the towns in Burlington County\nare of various economic and racial compositions; (2) they do not\naccount for minorities who will move into Mt. Holly Township from\noutside Burlington County; (3) they do not account for the deed\nrestricted units that will be more affordable; (4) they do not\naccount for a non-minority purchaser who rents to a minority; \n(5) they do not account for the minorities who will move\nelsewhere within Mt. Holly Township; and (6) more recent\npopulation survey data (from 2008, compared to the 2000 Census\ndata used by plaintiffs’ expert) shows 16,744 African-American\nand Hispanic households in Burlington County have incomes\nexceeding $45,000, evidence of the minority population’s ability\nto occupy all 464 market rate homes.\n13\n0016\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/101        P Daagtee  1F4il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5079\nwould trivialize the great purpose of that charter of freedom.”). \nFinally, it is important to point out that none of the\nplaintiffs has been forced out of their homes by the Township\nwithout the offer of relocation services.  The FHA makes it\nunlawful to otherwise make unavailable or deny a dwelling to any\nperson because of race.  The Township has advised the residents\nnot to move until directed by the Township so that they will be\neligible for relocation assistance.  All plaintiffs, save for one\nwho was told to leave by her landlord, are still residing in the\nGardens.  Thus, on this basis alone, plaintiffs’ FHA claim fails.\nBut even if plaintiffs were able to establish their prima\nfacie case, they have not rebutted the Township’s legitimate\ninterest in the redevelopment, and they have not shown how an\nalternative course of action would have a lesser impact. \nPlaintiffs cannot refute that redevelopment of the community to\nremove blight conditions is a bona fide interest of the state, as\nexplained previously by this Court and by the New Jersey\nAppellate Division.  (See Feb. 13, 2009 Op. at 9, citing Wilson\nv. City of Long Branch, 142 A.2d 837, 842 (N.J. 1958) (“Community\nredevelopment is a modern facet of municipal government.

It is clear that\nthe Township has a legitimate interest in the redevelopment of\nthe Gardens.\nWith regard to alternatives, plaintiffs have not identified\ndisputed issues of fact concerning whether the Township failed to\nshow “that no alternative course of action could be adopted that\nwould enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory\nimpact.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  The adequacy of the\nredevelopment plan, as opposed the rehabilitation plan advocated\nby Plaintiffs, was extensively analyzed in New Jersey state\ncourt.  See Citizens In Action v. Township Of Mt. Holly, 2007 WL\n1930457, 14 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007) (finding that “the\nredevelopment designation is based on a record that provides\nsubstantial evidence in support of the determination”).10 \n10Even though that analysis was performed in the context of\nplaintiffs’ claims under New Jersey's Local Housing and\nRedevelopment Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 to -73 (LHRL), the issue of\nthe sufficiency of the 2005 redevelopment plan was extensively\nlitigated.  Thus, collateral estoppel principles may also apply. \nSee In re Graham, 973 F.2d 1089, 1097 (3d Cir. 1992) (citations\nomitted) (explaining that issue preclusion applies when “(1) the\nissue sought to be precluded is the same as that involved in the\nprior action; (2) that issue was actually litigated; (3) it was\ndetermined by a final and valid judgment; and (4) the\n15\n0018\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/121        P Daagtee  1F6il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5081\nPlaintiffs have not presented any plan more viable than the one\nimplemented by the Township.11  They advocate rehabilitation, but\nhave proposed a plan, as pointed out by defendants, that relies\nupon governmental subsidies and upon costs based on property\nconditions in 1989.  It also does not take into account\nrehabilitation costs to rehab owner-occupied homes, which is an\nadditional $2.5 million, and it does not account for temporary\ndetermination was essential to the prior judgment”).  The Court,\nhowever, refrains from considering this issue because plaintiffs’\nFHA claim, which also concerns the 2008 revised redevelopment\nplan, was not litigated in state court. \n11 The Township has shown that several organizations have\nattempted to rehabilitate the Gardens in the last 15 or so years. \nThese small scale efforts were ineffective in curing the overall\nblight of the community, which was a frustrating result for the\norganizations, the Township, and the residents.  (See Sept. 8,\n2003 Town Council meeting transcript at 25-26, 31-32, Def. Ex.\nB.).   Plaintiffs argue that it is not their burden to prove a\nbetter alternative.  Although it is true that the Township must\nshow the other alternatives they considered and rejected, and\nthat the alternative course of action could not “be adopted that\nwould enable that interest to be served with less discriminatory\nimpact,” once that showing is made, the ultimate burden “once\nagain shift[s] to the Plaintiff to demonstrate that other\npractices are available.”  Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 149.  Thus,\nplaintiffs in this case have the obligation to show what\nalternatives would have better served the community.  Of course,\nthis analysis was intended to be performed after a finding of\ndisparate impact, which causes this “alternative course of\naction” analysis to make more sense in that context--that is, if\ndisparate impact is shown, the Township has the burden of showing\nit had no choice but to proceed in its chosen path despite the\ndisparate impact.  Here, where no disparate impact has been\nshown, this analysis devolves into plaintiffs’ personal\ndisagreement with the plan, and an argument as to what they\nbelieve to be the best course of action.  The fact that the\nTownship did not follow a plan sanctioned by the plaintiffs is\nnot the standard for a FHA claim.\n16\n0019\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/131        P Daagtee  1F7il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5082\nrelocation costs.12  Simply because the properties could have\nbeen rehabilitated does not mean that rehabilitation was the\nfeasible option.13   \n12 Plaintiffs’ residential planning expert, Gary Smith, AIA,\nAICP, relates in his updated certification that the Township is\nviolating several building codes in its demolition process.  The\nlegality of how the Township is currently proceeding under its\nredevelopment plan is not before the Court.   Mr. Smith also\nopines that the redevelopment plan should be halted, and\nredirected to save the existing housing stock for rehabilitation. \nAs the Court commented before, however, “[e]ffectively,\nplaintiffs are seeking to remain living in the blighted and\nunsafe conditions until they are awarded money damages for their\nclaims and sufficient compensation to secure housing in the local\nhousing market.  Although couched at times like an effort to have\nthe development go up around them, like a highway built around a\nprotected tree, or to have their units rehabilitated, this makes\nlittle if no practical sense after years of litigation, approved\nredevelopment plans, and the expenditure of significant public\nresources.  At this late stage, the only real practical remedy is\nfor plaintiffs to receive the fair value for their home as well\nas proper and non-discriminatory relocation procedures and\nbenefits. . . . The relief they are seeking is inconsistent with\nproving the fourth element of their FHA claim--namely, that an\nalternative course of action to eminent domain and relocation is\nviable.”  (Feb. 9, 2009 Op. at 10-11.)\n13 The state appellate court commented, \nPhotographic evidence reveals areas within\nthe Gardens that are dilapidated.\nAdditionally, there was testimony that there\nwas overcrowding and excessive land coverage\nbecause of the way the units were arranged in\nblocks in fee simple ownership. Accordingly,\na dilapidated home on one lot had a serious\neffect on homes on either side of it.\nExcessive land coverage was also evident\nwhere a majority of the rear yards were paved\nor covered with gravel to accommodate\nadditional parking spaces. Finally, the\nalleyways created a faulty arrangement or\ndesign for the Gardens because it increased\nthe amount of crime in the area.

Even if they have made such a showing, they\nhave failed to offer sufficient evidence to rebut the Township’s\nlegitimate governmental purpose or demonstrate illegitimate\ndiscriminatory intent.  Therefore, plaintiffs have not\ndemonstrated that material disputed facts exist as to their FHA\nclaim.  Accordingly, summary judgment must be entered in favor of\ndefendants on this claim.14\n2.

In their previous motion to dismiss, Triad\nargued, and Keating joined in that argument, that it cannot be\nheld liable under the FHA because it had no part in the drafting\nand adoption of the Township’s redevelopment plan, and its\nactions with regard to the relocation activities do not fall\nwithin the province of the FHA-protected conduct.  Because the\nCourt has found no FHA violation, Triad’s argument will not be\nconsidered.\n18\n0021\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/151        P Daagtee  1F9il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5084\norder to prove such claims, plaintiffs must show that they were\nthe target of intentional, purposeful discrimination by the\nTownship.

Holly.”  (Feb. 9, 2009\nOp. at 7.)  Thus, as with their FHA claim, the Township’s motion\nto dismiss these claims was converted to one for summary\njudgment, and the Court afforded plaintiffs the opportunity to\nprovide other proof to support their claims of intentional\ndiscrimination.\nIn their response, plaintiffs have failed to provide such\nproof.  As discussed above, plaintiffs first argue that summary\njudgment is premature, because their ability to prove these\nintentional discrimination claims is thwarted by the lack of\ndiscovery--namely, the depositions of Township officials.  As\nalso discussed above, however, even if such depositions were\npermitted, the Court doubts that any Township official will\ntestify to his or her “discriminatory purpose” in approving the\nredevelopment plan.  See, e.g., Smith v. Town of Clarkton, N.C., \n682 F.2d 1055, 1064-65 (4th Cir. 1982) (in an FHA case, stating,\n“Municipal officials acting in their official capacities seldom,\nif ever, announce on the record that they are pursuing a\nparticular course of action because of their desire to\ndiscriminate against a racial minority.

In their brief,\nplaintiffs specifically refer to one of them by Santos Cruz to\nsupport the claim that the Township’s redevelopment activities\nlowered the property values of the remaining homes, and the\nTownship took advantage of that situation by pressuring residents\nto sell their homes at deflated prices that did not represent\nfair market value.  (Pl. Opp. at 31.)  This conclusion is based\non Mr. Cruz’s “belief.”  (Cruz Cert., Docket No. 17-9 (“I believe\nthe houses are worth much more than the Township is offering.”) \nThe other affidavits by plaintiffs in the record contain similar\nstatements as to their “beliefs” and “feelings.”  See Ancho\nCert., Docket No. 17-7, ¶ 18, “I believe that my home is worth\nmuch more than that [$39,000 to $42,000 offered to others]\nbecause we invested a great amount of money to make it\ncomfortable for our retirement”); Simons Cert., Docket No. 17-10,\n¶ 14, “I believe my house is worth a great deal more than what\nthe Township is offering me,” because it has three bedrooms, a\nlarge lot, and it has undergone “costly upgrades.”) These\naffidavits are insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion. \nCelotex, 477 U.S. at 332 (“[C]onclusory, self-serving affidavits\nare insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\nInstead, the affiant must set forth specific facts that reveal a\ngenuine issue of material fact.”). \n21\n0024\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/181        P Daagtee  2F2il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5087\nstory, long on accusations and suppositions but short on proof,\nof the Township’s ten-year, insidious desire to displace the\nminority population of Mt.

Moreover, it is an undisputed fact\nthat New Jersey statute only requires the Township to pay $4,000\nin relocation benefits to tenants, and $15,000 in relocation\nbenefits to homeowners, but the Township has paid $7,500 to\ntenants and $35,000 to homeowners.  (See Def. Statement of Facts,\n¶ 23, at 31.)\n22\n0025\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 3/191        P Daagtee  2F3il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5088\nbackground of the decision; (3) the sequence of events leading up\nto the challenged decision, including departures from normal\nprocedures and usual substantive norms; and (4) the legislative\nor administrative history of the decision).  \nIn contrast, the Township provides transcripts of town\ncouncil and planning board meetings, where concerned citizens and\ncouncil members discussed the plans for the Gardens.  The\nTownship has also provided letters and affidavits from former\nGardens residents, as well as certifications from individuals\ninvolved with the redevelopment plan implementation and\nrelocation process.  These documents range in date from 2002\nthrough early 2010.  The documents show that from the very\nbeginning, the planning board was aware of the sensitive issues\nthat would arise as they undertook the process, the desire to\nhave direct communication with Gardens’ residents, and the\nTownship’s consideration of the residents’ concerns.  (See, e.g.,\nSept. 8, 2003 Town Council meeting transcript at 36-44, Def Ex.\nB.)  Although many viewpoints were expressed by the Gardens’\nresidents and community activists, with some being supportive and\nhopeful, while other disenfranchised residents speaking\nemphatically and eloquently on their negative opinion on the\nredevelopment plan, their input was welcomed and encouraged.17\n17 Plaintiffs refer to the Township’s “secret,” off-the-\nrecord meetings among Township officials and the redevelopers\nwhere decisions were made without input from the community, and\nwhere they presume the true discriminatory intent of the Township\n23\n0026\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 4/101        P Daagtee  2F4il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5089\nFurthermore, nowhere in plaintiffs’ recitation of the\nTownship’s motives do plaintiffs specifically acknowledge the\nextensive deterioration, crime, and overall unsafe living\nconditions the Township was endeavoring to cure.  Although\nplaintiffs feel that the Township simply wishes to remove all\nminorities from the town, evidence in the record supports an\nopposing viewpoint--that but-for the significant concern for the\nGardens’ resident’s welfare, and the desire to make the Township\nas a whole a safe and pleasant town for all of its citizens,\nminority and non-minority, the Township would have never\nundertaken the long-overdue project, particularly considering the\nchallenges that the redevelopment would, and did, inspire.18 \nAdditionally, as noted above and previously, evidence in the\nrecord shows that many relocated residents have been pleased with\nwas revealed.  Although “New Jersey has a strong, expressed\npublic policy in favor of open government, as evidenced by our\nOpen Public Meetings Act, N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 to -21,” Times of\nTrenton Pub. Corp. v. Lafayette Yard Community Development Corp.,\n874 A.2d 1064, 1070 (N.J. 2005) (citation omitted), the OPMA sets\nforth specific instances where closed-door sessions are\nappropriate, see N.J.S.A. 10:4-12, -13.  It is unclear whether\nthese alleged “secret” meetings met the requirements of New\nJersey’s OPMA.  The Township’s compliance with OPMA is not before\nthe Court, however, and plaintiffs’ allegations concerning these\nmeetings as evidence of discriminatory intent are speculative,\nand, therefore, of insufficient weight to defeat summary\njudgment.\n18 It seems that plaintiffs could not dispute the ironic\nobservation that if the Township had allowed the Gardens to\ncontinue to deteriorate as it had over the years, that it might\nthen be fairly characterized as having a discriminatory intent\ntoward its minority, low-income residents.\n24\n0027\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 4/111        P Daagtee  2F5il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5090\nthe process, and are now in a much better place as a result.  \nIt also cannot be forgotten that the redevelopment plan has\ngone through three machinations, from the Gardens Area\nRedevelopment Plan (“GARP”) in 2003, to the West\nRancocas Redevelopment Plan (“WRRP”) in 2005, and then to the\nRevised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan in September 2008.  For\neach of these plans, the Township Council and the builder heard\nextensive public comment, testimony, and written objections (as\nintricately detailed in plaintiffs’ complaint), and even though\nthe 2005 WRRP was approved by the New Jersey Department of\nCommunity Affairs and affirmed by the New Jersey state trial and\nappellate courts, the Township and redevelopers conducted a\nreevaluation of the plan which resulted in the 2008 Revised WRRP. \nDespite plaintiffs’ claims that all the plans were adopted\nwithout meaningful consideration of the residents’ objections, it\nseems specious to believe that the Township extensively\nreevaluated and revised its plans while entertaining numerous\nopportunities for public comment and objection simply as a ruse\nto mask its ultimate purpose of “ridding” Mt. Holly of its\nminority population.\nThe Court acknowledges that for every governmental action,\npeople will object, for personal reasons, or as a champion for\nthose who cannot speak out for themselves.  The Court also\nacknowledges that governing officials are often not the most\n25\n0028\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 4/121        P Daagtee  2F6il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5091\nefficient or pragmatic in their decision-making process.  When\npeople’s homes are at stake, and when issues concerning race and\neconomic status are involved, the emotions of everyone are\namplified.  This is evidenced not only by the 10-year litigation\nconcerning the Gardens’ redevelopment, but by the voices of the\nresidents who have expressed the extremes of satisfaction and\ndispleasure with the plan.  In addition to the people who feel\nbenefitted by the Township, it is undisputable that people have\nfelt unjustifiably wronged by the Township, which has had to make\nsome hard decisions along the way.   \nThe Court, however, must view the case under the legal\nframework that constrains this Court’s consideration of these\nissues, rather than under the emotional contours of the\nsituation.  At this summary judgment stage in the context of what\nproof has been provided, and in deciding what material issues of\nfact need to be resolved, the weight of the record evidence\ndemonstrates that no reasonable juror could find that the\nTownship acted with intentional discrimination in the development\nand implementation of the Gardens’ redevelopment plan.  Moreover,\nno additional discovery appears calculated or even remotely\nlikely to provide the missing proofs.  Consequently, summary\njudgment must be entered in favor of the Township on plaintiffs’\nintentional discrimination claims.\n \n26\n0029\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 4/131        P Daagtee  2F7il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5092\n3. Punitive damage claims\nPlaintiffs are also seeking punitive damages for all of\ntheir claims.  The Township had moved to dismiss plaintiffs’\nrequest for punitive damages, arguing that under various legal\nprinciples, punitive damages cannot be imposed against a\nmunicipality.  In the Court’s previous Opinion, all of\nplaintiffs’ punitive damages requests were dismissed, except for\nthose relating to plaintiffs’ FHA and Civil Rights Act claims\n(Counts One and Two).  The Court reserved decision on these two\nclaims pending consideration of the converted motions.\nEven though “punitive damages can be awarded in a civil\nrights case where a jury finds a constitutional violation, even\nwhen the jury has not awarded compensatory or nominal damages,”\nAlexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing\nCurtis v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189 (1974)) (both discussing FHA\nclaims), a finding of a violation is a mandatory prerequisite to\nany possibility of punitive damages.  Because the Court has not\nfound defendants to be liable for plaintiffs’ FHA and civil\nrights claims, plaintiffs’ punitive damages claims fail as\nwell.19 \n19For punitive damages, plaintiffs would also need to prove\nthat defendants’ “‘conduct is shown to be motivated by evil\nmotive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous\nindifference to the federally protected rights of others.’”\nAlexander v. Riga, 208 F.3d 419, 430 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting\nSmith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)).  Plaintiffs cannot make\nthis showing.\n27\n0030\n\nCaseC 1a:s0e8:- c1v1--012155894  - N  DLHoc-JuSm  e Dnto: c0u0m31e1n0t 5141549  5  3F i le  d P 0a1g/e0:3 4/141        P Daagtee  2F8il eodf :2 085 P/2a7g/e2I0D1:1 5093\nCONCLUSION\n For the reasons expressed above, defendants’ converted\nmotions for summary judgment shall be granted on the four\nremaining claims in plaintiffs’ complaint.

This opinion addresses only the\njurisdictional issues raised in the motions to dismiss.3   \n1 Joining in the brief submitted on behalf of Township of\nMount Holly are defendants Kathleen Hoffman and Brooke Tidswell,\nIII, collectively “Township Defendants.”\n2 Defendant Keating Urban Partners, L.L.C. relied upon the\nbrief submitted by the Township of Mount Holly.\n3 On September 22, 2008, the Township Council invalidated\nthe redevelopment plan challenged in the Amended Complaint with\nthe adoption of the Revised West Rancocas Redevelopment Plan\n(“Revised WRRP”).  Counsel for Plaintiffs have moved for leave to\nfile a second amended complaint in light of the revised\nredevelopment plan.  Because Plaintiffs have moved to file a\nsecond amended complaint, this Court will address the objections\nto the merits of the claims in conjunction with Plaintiffs’\nmotion for leave to amend.  Of course, we express no opinion\nregarding our subject matter jurisdiction over claims not yet\nfiled.\nPage 2\n\nThis Court holds that it has subject matter jurisdiction\nover the claims in Counts 1 through 5 and 9 through 12 of the\nAmended Complaint.  It does not, however, have subject matter\njurisdiction over the claims in Counts 6 through 8 because these\nclaims are now moot.  Likewise, this Court does not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction over Counts 13 and 14 because these claims\nare unripe for adjudication.  This Court will not abstain from\nexercising its jurisdiction over the remaining claims, and in the\ninterests of judicial economy, will exercise supplemental\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over any state law\nclaims found in Counts 1 through 5 and 9 through 12.\n  \nJURISDICTION\nAs Plaintiffs have alleged violations of the United States\nConstitution, the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., and\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982, this Court\nexercises subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).\nBACKGROUND\nMount Holly Gardens (“Gardens”) is a neighborhood in Mount\nHolly, New Jersey.  Its residents are primarily low-income\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics.  This demographic contrasts with\nPage 3\n\nthat of the rest of Mount Holly, whose residents are primarily\nwhite and have a higher median income.\nIn 2002, the Mount Holly Township Council (“Township\nCouncil”) determined that the Gardens was an “area in need of\nredevelopment” under New Jersey law.  See N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et\nseq.  Pursuant to this determination, the Township Council passed\nthe Gardens Area Redevelopment Plan (“GARP”) in 2003.  In 2005,\nthis redevelopment plan was superseded by the passage of the West\nRancocas Redevelopment Plan (“WRRP”).  The redevelopment plans\ncalled for the acquisition and demolition of the 329 homes in the\nGardens redevelopment area.4\nFearing displacement, Plaintiff Mount Holly Gardens Citizens\nin Action (“CIA”), an advocacy group for Gardens residents, and\nmultiple Gardens residents filed suit in New Jersey state court\nin 2005.  In May 2005, Judge Sweeney of the New Jersey Superior\nCourt found: (1) that the Gardens was an area in need of\nredevelopment under New Jersey law; (2) that the Township Council\nhad followed proper procedures with respect to the redevelopment\nfrom 2002 through 2005; and (3) that the WRRP complied with New\nJersey’s Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (“LRHL”).  In August\n2005, Judge Sweeney dismissed Plaintiffs’ civil rights claims\nwithout prejudice as unripe.  All of Judge Sweeney’s rulings were\n4 The WRRP left open the possibility that some homes might\nbe rehabilitated rather than demolished.  However, it did not\nindicate how many homes, if any, might be salvaged.\nPage 4\n\nupheld by the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division, and\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court denied certification.\nSince Judge Sweeney’s rulings in 2005, the Township has\ntaken substantial steps towards redeveloping the Gardens.  In\n2006, the Township selected defendant Keating Urban Partners,\nL.L.C. as its redeveloper.  Keating, in turn, hired defendant\nTriad Associates, Inc. to conduct relocation activities. \nPlaintiffs allege that the Township has acquired at least 219 of\nthe 329 residential units in the Gardens redevelopment area and\nhas demolished at least 73 units.  In April of 2008, the Township\nCouncil passed an ordinance stating that the Township is or will\nbe the owner of all homes in the Gardens redevelopment area.  \nThis ordinance also authorized the use of eminent domain\nproceedings in furtherance of this goal.\nOn May 27, 2008, Plaintiffs CIA and numerous current and\nformer Gardens residents (“Residents”) filed suit in this Court. \nTheir Amended Complaint, comprising five (5) federal and nine (9)\nstate law counts, challenged the implementation of the WRRP as\ndiscriminatory both in intent and effect.  The Amended Complaint\nalso alleged that the Township Council had failed to follow\nrequired procedures with respect to the modification of the WRRP, \nand that the redevelopment activities constituted a governmental\ntaking without just compensation.\nPage 5\n\nDISCUSSION\nI.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\nThis Court must first determine whether it has subject\nmatter jurisdiction over this action.  Defendants argue that\nCounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, and 14 of the Amended Complaint are\nunripe for adjudication; that Counts 6 through 9 are now moot;\nand that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine.  These issues are addressed in turn\nbelow.\nA.  Ripeness\nAn Article III court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over\nclaims that are unripe.  The Supreme Court has explained that \nclaims relying upon “‘contingent future events that may not occur\nas anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all,’” are unripe for\nadjudication and must be dismissed.  Thomas v. Union Carbide \nAgricultural Products Co., 473 U.S. 568, 580-81, 105 S.Ct. 3325,\n87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985) (quoting 13A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R.\nMiller, & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §\n3532, p. 112 (1984)).  In determining the ripeness of a claim,\nthe court must “evaluate both the fitness of the issues for\njudicial consideration and the hardship to the parties of\nwithholding court consideration.” Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,\n387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967).\nPage 6\n\nWith these rulings in mind, we shall now analyze the\nripeness of Plaintiffs’ civil rights claims (Counts 1 through 5)\nand Plaintiffs’ taking claims (Counts 13 and 14).\n(a)  Civil Rights Claims - Counts 1 through 5\nCounts 1 through 5 of the Amended Complaint allege\nviolations of Plaintiffs’ civil rights.  Plaintiffs argue, in\nessence, that the Township’s planned demolition of minority-\noccupied housing is discriminatory both in intent and effect. \nPlaintiffs allege violations of the Fair Housing Act, the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, and the\nEqual Protection Clause of the New Jersey Constitution.  \nDefendants contend that these claims are not ripe and must\ntherefore be dismissed.  The Township states that “Plaintiffs\nfail to articulate any harm other than that recited before the\nState courts during the prior litigation, rendering their claims\nspeculative and un-ripe.” (Township’s Brief in Support of Motion\nto Dismiss, p. 17.)  Furthermore, the Township states that “[n]o\nPlaintiff is alleged to have been unable to find safe, decent,\naffordable housing or been forcibly removed from their home. \nPlaintiffs allege that they may be unable to find affordable\nhousing if they are forced to relocate.  Such allegations rest on\nPage 7\n\ncontingent future events that may never occur.”  (Township’s\nBrief, p. 18.)  \nHowever, the complaint alleges that at this point, the\nTownship has acquired 219 residential units out of the 329 homes\nin the Gardens redevelopment area.  At least 73 of these units\nhave been demolished.  In April of 2008, the Township Council\npassed an ordinance stating that the Township is or will be the\nowner of all homes in the redevelopment area.  The ordinance\nauthorizes the use of eminent domain proceedings in conjunction\nwith the acquisition of these homes, and the Township has\ncommenced eminent domain proceedings against at least one\nproperty owner.  In light of these developments, the majority of\nPlaintiffs’ claims are no longer speculative.  The ripeness of\neach challenged count will be analyzed below.\n(1) Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. \nPlaintiffs have alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act\n(“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq.  The FHA defines an “aggrieved\nperson” as any person who “claims to have been injured by a\ndiscriminatory housing practice,” or who “believes that such\nperson will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that\nis about to occur.”  § 3602(i).  Plaintiffs’ claims may therefore\nbe ripe under the statute even if Plaintiffs have not yet been\ninjured by a discriminatory housing practice.\nPage 8\n\nThe first claim Plaintiffs bring under the FHA is a\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a).  This section makes it unlawful\n“[t]o refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide\noffer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or\notherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person\nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or\nnational origin.”  § 3604(a) (emphasis added).  Plaintiffs\ncontend that by acquiring and demolishing their homes, Defendants\nwill “make unavailable or deny” their dwellings within the\nmeaning of § 3604(a).  \nPlaintiffs’ claim under § 3604(a) is ripe for adjudication. \nPlaintiffs are “aggrieved persons” for purposes of this section\nbecause they believe that Defendants are about to make their\nhomes unavailable to them in violation of § 3604(a).  This belief\nis well-founded in light of recent events.  Indeed, the Township\nCouncil passed an ordinance in April of 2008 declaring that the\nTownship would be the owner of Plaintiffs’ homes.  \nThus, Plaintiffs’ claims under § 3604(a) are no longer\nspeculative.  It is clear that the Township intends to take their\nhomes.  This issue is fit for judicial consideration, as it is\nclear that, if Plaintiffs’ claims are valid, injury will occur in\nthe absence of judicial intervention.  Additionally, there would\nbe considerable hardship to the Plaintiffs in withholding court\nconsideration until their homes have actually been taken, as they\nPage 9\n\nhave alleged that they wish to remain in their homes.  Thus,\nPlaintiffs’ claim under § 3604(a) is ripe.\nHaving determined that Plaintiffs’ claim under § 3604(a) is\nripe, we now turn to their claim under § 3604(b).  Section\n3604(b) makes it unlawful “[t]o discriminate against any person\nin the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in\nconnection therewith, because of race, color, religion, sex,\nfamilial status, or national origin.”  § 3604(b).  Plaintiffs\nallege that “by failing to provide adequate essential services,”\nAm. Compl. p. 38, the Township has discriminated against them in\nviolation of § 3604(b). \nThis claim is also ripe for adjudication.  The actions\nchallenged pursuant to § 3604(b) are not speculative; rather,\nPlaintiffs challenge actions that the Township has \nalready taken.  Because this claim rests on events that have\nalready occurred, it is ripe for adjudication.\nHaving found that Plaintiffs’ claim under § 3604(b) is ripe,\nwe now turn to Plaintiffs’ claim under § 3617.  Section 3617 \nmakes it unlawful “to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere\nwith any person in the exercise or enjoyment of . . . any right\ngranted or protected by section 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this\ntitle.” Plaintiffs allege that they have been harassed as a\nresult of remaining in their dwellings and that this harassment\nPage 10\n\nis discriminatory.  Because Plaintiffs allege a harm that has\nalready occurred, this claim is ripe for adjudication.\n(2) Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. § 1982\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, guarantees that\n“[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right,\nin every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens\nthereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real\nand personal property.”  42 U.S.C. § 1982.  Plaintiffs allege\nthat the Township’s plan to acquire and demolish their homes is \nbased in part on racial animus and thus violates their rights\nunder § 1982.\nDefendants allege that this claim is not ripe for\nadjudication.  However, as discussed above, it is now clear that\nthe Township will acquire Plaintiffs’ homes.  The claim is thus\nfit for judicial consideration, as Plaintiffs’ claims that they\nwill lose their homes are no longer speculative.  Withholding\ncourt consideration would result in a hardship to Plaintiffs\nbecause forcing them to wait until they are actually displaced\nwould eclipse any chance they have of obtaining the equitable\nrelief they desire.\n(3) Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and\nof Art. I, Para. 1 of the New Jersey Constitution\nPlaintiffs allege that the Township has intentionally\ndiscriminated against them on the basis of race in violation of\nPage 11\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the\nEqual Protection under Art. I, para. 1 of the New Jersey\nConstitution.  The discriminatory acts that Plaintiffs allege\ninclude planning to demolish their housing, harassment in an\neffort to force Plaintiffs to leave the Gardens, and the\nreduction of municipal services in the Gardens.\nDefendants contend that these claims are not ripe for\nadjudication.  However, some of the harms alleged have already\noccurred, and the demolition of Plaintiffs’ housing, as noted \nabove, is no longer speculative.  Because the harms Plaintiffs\nallege under these counts are not speculative, and because\nwithholding court consideration would create a hardship for the\nplaintiffs, these counts are ripe for adjudication.\n(4) New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (“LAD”),\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-1 et seq.\nPlaintiffs allege violations of sections 10:5-12.5 and 10:5-\n4 of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (“LAD”).  Section\n10:5-12.5 of the LAD states that \nit shall be unlawful discrimination for a municipality,\ncounty or other local civil or political subdivision of the\nState of New Jersey, or an officer, employee, or agent\nthereof, to exercise the power to regulate land use or\nhousing in a manner that discriminates on the basis of race,\ncreed, color, national origin, ancestry, marital status,\nfamilial status, sex, gender identity or expression,\nnationality or disability. (emphasis added) \nPage 12\n\nN.J.S.A. 10:5-12.5.  Plaintiffs allege that the Township’s\nredevelopment of the Gardens is racially discriminatory and thus\nviolates section 10:5-12.5 of the LAD.\nThe Township contends that this claim is not ripe for\nadjudication.  However, Plaintiffs allege in this claim certain\nharms that have already occurred, including the reduction of\nservices provided by the Township and the demolition of housing. \nBecause these harms are not speculative, but have already\noccurred, this claim is ripe for adjudication.  Having addressed\nthe ripeness of Plaintiffs’ claim under section 10:5-12.5 of the\nLAD, we now turn to Plaintiffs’ claim under section 10:5-4.\nSection 10:5-4 of the LAD states that “[a]ll persons shall\nhave the opportunity . . . to obtain all the accommodations,\nadvantages, facilities, and privileges of any place of public\naccommodation, publicly assisted housing accommodation, and other\nreal property without discrimination” on the basis of race,\ncolor, or national origin.  N.J.S.A. 10:5-4.  Plaintiffs allege\nthat the Defendants (including the Redevelopers) have violated\nthis section of the LAD by acquiring, vacating, and demolishing\npreviously-occupied housing in the Gardens. \nDefendants contend that this claim is not ripe for\nadjudication.  However, at this point, the harms Plaintiffs\nallege are not speculative.  Defendants have demolished many\nunits in the Gardens and have evidenced their intent to acquire\nPage 13\n\nand demolish the remaining units.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claim\nis not speculative, and it is ripe for adjudication.\n(b) Counts 13 and 14 - Denial of Just Compensation under the\nFifth Amendment and Art. I, para. 20 of the New Jersey\nConstitution\nThis Court holds that Counts 13 and 14 are not ripe for\nadjudication, and will be dismissed without prejudice.5\n  A taking claim is not ripe until state procedures for\nseeking just compensation have been exhausted.  As the Third\nCircuit recently explained, “Because the Fifth Amendment bars not\njust the ‘taking’ of property, but the taking of property\n5 Plaintiffs, concerned that they might run afoul of New\nJersey’s entire controversy doctrine, have asked this Court to\nexpressly reserve their right to bring their taking claims in a\nseparate state court litigation.  This request is denied because\nPlaintiffs have cited no authority for the proposition that a\nfederal court has the power to prejudge an issue of state\nprocedural law.  Nor have Plaintiffs cited cases standing for the\nproposition that their unripe claims will be barred unless this\nCourt expressly reserves their right to bring them in a later\nlitigation.  We believe that it will be for the state courts to\ndetermine whether Plaintiffs have complied with state procedural\nrules, if and when such proceedings are brought.\nIt is noted, however, that this Court foresees no harm to\nPlaintiffs as a result of this denial.  New Jersey’s entire\ncontroversy doctrine requires litigants to bring all claims\narising out of the same facts in the same litigation.  See\nN.J.S.A. Rule 4:30A.  However, “[t]he entire controversy doctrine\ndoes not require that all claims be adjudicated in one\nproceeding, it merely requires that a party assert those claims\nat the outset....  Thus, it is the party’s original compliance\nwith the doctrine ... that ensures preservation of that claim.”\nMystic Isle Development Corp. v. Perskie & Nehmad, 142 N.J. 310,\n332, 662 A.2d 523, 534 (N.J. 1995), overruled on other grounds by\nOlds v. Donnelly, 150 N.J. 454, 696 A.2d 633 (N.J. 1997).\nPage 14\n\n‘without just compensation,’ a plaintiff ‘cannot claim a\nviolation of the Just Compensation Clause until’ he or she has\nexhausted a state’s ‘procedure for seeking just compensation.’”\nCounty Concrete Corp. v. Township of Roxbury, 442 F.3d 159, 168\n(3d Cir. 2006) (citing Williamson County Regional Planning Comm’n\nv. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 194-95 & 194 n.\n13, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985)).  Although County\nConcrete Corp. addressed only takings under the Fifth Amendment,\nthe rule applies equally to a taking “without just compensation”\nprohibited by the New Jersey Constitution.\nIn this case, Plaintiffs have not exhausted New Jersey’s\nprocedures for seeking just compensation.  Therefore, Plaintiffs’\ntaking claims are unripe and must be dismissed without prejudice. \nHaving addressed Defendants’ arguments that Plaintiffs’\nclaims are unripe, we now turn to Defendants’ arguments that\nCounts 6 through 9 are rendered moot by the passage of the\nRevised WRRP.\nB.  Mootness\nThe parties agree that Counts 6 through 8 of the Amended\nComplaint are now moot.  These counts are therefore dismissed.\nHowever, Plaintiffs contest Defendants’ assertion that the\npassage of the Revised WRRP moots Count 9 of the Amended\nComplaint.  The issue before the Court is whether the passage of\nPage 15\n\nthe Revised WRRP, which is not alleged to have violated\nstatutorily-required procedures, moots Plaintiffs’ due process\nand fundamental fairness claims under Art. I, para. 1 of the New\nJersey Constitution.  \nA defendant may not “moot a case by repealing the challenged\nstatute and replacing it with one that differs only in some\ninsignificant respect.”  Northeastern Florida Chapter of the\nAssociated General Contractors of America v. City of\nJacksonville, Florida, 508 U.S. 656, 662, 113 S.Ct. 2297, 124\nL.Ed.2d 586 (1993).  Likewise, “[a] claim is not mooted by the\namendment [of a challenged statute] if the ‘gravamen of\npetitioner’s complaint’ remains because, although the new\nordinance ‘may disadvantage [plaintiffs] to a lesser degree than\nthe old one,’ still ‘it disadvantages them in the same\nfundamental way.’”  Nextel West Corp. v. Unity Township, 282 F.3d\n257, 262 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Northeastern Florida Chapter of\nthe Associated General Contractors of America, 508 U.S. at 662).\nIn this case, Plaintiffs allege that the substance of the\nRevised WRRP is essentially the same as the “concept plans”\nchallenged in Count 9 of the Amended Complaint.  They claim that\nthe Township’s compliance with proper procedures in the passage\nof the Revised WRRP was “little more than a sham, depriving\nResidents of due process.” (Plaintiffs’ Opposition to Townships’\nLetter Brief, pp. 6-7.)  In sum, they appear to argue that\nPage 16\n\nDefendants violated due process and fundamental fairness in\nadopting the WRRP and in subsequently formulating “concept\nplans”; that the Revised WRRP is, in substance, equivalent to the\noffending “concept plans”; that in enacting the “concept plan” as\nthe Revised WRRP, the Township merely made a show of complying\nwith the Open Public Meetings Act and the Local Housing and\nRedevelopment Law; and that therefore, the passage of the Revised\nWRRP did not afford Plaintiffs due process and fundamental\nfairness, as guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution.\nTaking the facts in the light most favorable to the\nPlaintiffs, Count 9 is not moot.  Accepting Plaintiffs’\nallegations and inferences as true, there is a live controversy\nas to whether Plaintiffs have been afforded due process and\nfundamental fairness in the process of enacting a redevelopment\nplan.  The New Jersey Supreme Court explained the requirements of\ndue process in Doe v. Poritz, 662 A.2d 367 (N.J. 1995):\nFundamentally, due process requires an opportunity to be\nheard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.  Kahn\nv. U.S., 753 F.2d 1208, 1218 (3d Cir. 1985).  The minimum\nrequirements of due process, therefore, are notice and the\nopportunity to be heard.  U.S. v. Raffoul, 826 F.2d 218, 222\n(3d Cir. 1987) (citing Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 95 S.Ct.\n729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975)).  \nId. at 420-21.  If the public process utilized in passing the\nRevised WRRP was, in fact, “little more than a sham,” see\nPlaintiffs’ Opposition, p. 7, and if Plaintiffs therefore did not\nhave the “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a\nPage 17\n\nmeaningful manner,” then the passage of the Revised WRRP cannot\nhave cured the lack of due process alleged in Count 9. \nTherefore, Count 9 is not moot. \nHaving decided the issue of lack of subject matter\njurisdiction due to mootness, we now turn to Defendants’ argument\nthat this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the\nRooker-Feldman doctrine.\nC.  Rooker-Feldman\nDefendants argue that this Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  However, Rooker-\nFeldman is inapplicable to the case at hand.  Therefore, this\nCourt has subject matter jurisdiction over all remaining claims\n(Counts 1 through 5 and Counts 9 through 12).\nThe Supreme Court recently clarified the Rooker-Feldman\ndoctrine in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp.,\n544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005).  Exxon\nMobil made clear that a district court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction under Rooker-Feldman only in “cases brought by\nstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court\njudgments rendered before the district court proceedings\ncommenced and inviting district court review and rejection of\nthose judgments.”  Id. at 283.  Thus, Rooker-Feldman only applies\nPage 18\n\nwhen a litigant is essentially seeking appellate review of a\nstate-court judgment in the district courts.\nIn this case, Plaintiffs are not asking this court to\nexercise appellate review over the judgment rendered in the New\nJersey state court litigation.  Rather, Plaintiffs are bringing\ntheir now-ripe civil rights claims, dismissed three years ago as\nunripe, as well as claims regarding violations of proper\nprocedures that have occurred since the 2005 state court\nlitigation.  Even if some issues raised in this litigation were\nalready decided in the state court litigation, this does not\nimplicate Rooker-Feldman.  Rather, the handling of matters\nalready litigated would be dictated by preclusion law, which is\nnot a jurisdictional matter.  Id. at 293.  Thus, Rooker-Feldman\ndoes not apply to this case, and this Court has subject matter\njurisdiction over the claims in Counts 1 through 5 and Counts 9\nthrough 12 of the Amended Complaint. \nHaving ruled that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction\nover Counts 1 through 5 and 9 through 12, we shall now address\nDefendants’ arguments that this Court should abstain from\nexercising its jurisdiction under Burford.  \nII.  Burford Abstention\nPage 19\n\nDefendants request that this Court abstain from hearing\nPlaintiffs’ claims.  For the reasons explained below, this court\nwill not abstain from exercising its jurisdiction.\n“Abstention is a judicially created doctrine under which a\nfederal court will decline to exercise its jurisdiction so that a\nstate court or state agency will have the opportunity to decide\nthe matters at issue.  The doctrine was born out of a concern for\nthe maintenance of our federal system; seeking to avoid\nunnecessary conflicts between the federal judiciary and state\ngovernment.”  Heritage Farms, Inc. v. Solebury Township, 671 F.2d\n743, 746 (3d Cir. 1982), citing Railroad Comm’n of Texas v.\nPullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500-01, 61 S.Ct. 643, 645, 85 L.Ed 971\n(1941).  \nConcededly, eminent domain and land use issues are\ntraditionally local in nature.  As the Third Circuit noted in\nIzzo v. Borough of River Edge, 843 F.2d 765, 769 (3d Cir. 1988),\n“[l]and use policy customarily has been considered a feature of\nlocal government and an area in which the tenets of federalism\nare particularly strong.”  Id. at 769.  However, “the mere\nexistence of land use regulation will not automatically mandate\nfederal court abstention.”  Id.\nThis court may abstain only if, after carefully examining\nthe facts of the case, it determines that the case falls into one\nof the narrow categories of cases from which a district court may\nPage 20\n\nproperly abstain.  Abstention is an “extraordinary and narrow\nexception to the duty of a District Court to adjudicate a\ncontroversy properly before it.  Abdication of the obligation to\ndecide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the\nexceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to\nrepair to the state court would clearly serve an important\ncountervailing interest.”  County of Allegheny v. Frank Mashuda\nCo., 360 U.S. 185, 188-89, 79 S.Ct. 1060, 1062-63, 3 L.Ed.2d.\n1163 (1959).  Defendants argue that abstention is justified in\nthis case under the Supreme Court decision in Burford v. Sun Oil\nCo.   However, an analysis under Burford demonstrates that\nabstention is not warranted in this case.\nBurford abstention derives its name from the case of Burford\nv. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424\n(1943).  That case dealt with abstention in the context of Texas’\nhighly complex, state-wide regulatory system for gas and oil\nconservation.  The complexity of the law and the importance of\nnot having conflicting decisions led Texas to centralize\nadjudication of claims in the Texas Railroad Commission and a\nsingle state court.  The Supreme Court held that in this\nsituation, the federal district court should abstain from hearing\nclaims normally adjudicated by the centralized court.  “The state\nprovides a unified method for the formation of policy and\ndetermination of cases by the Commission and by the state courts\nPage 21\n\n.... Conflicts in the interpretation of state law, dangerous to\nthe success of state policies, are almost certain to result from\nthe intervention of the lower federal courts.”  Id. at 333-34. \nIn upholding the district court’s decision to abstain, the\nSupreme Court recognized that incorrect decisions of difficult\nand industry-specific Texas law in individual cases could\nseriously disrupt state-wide regulation of an industry essential\nto Texas’ economy.  \nThe Supreme Court further explained Burford abstention in\nthe case of New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of the City\nof New Orleans (“NOPSI”), 491 U.S. 350, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105\nL.Ed.2d 298 (1989).  The court described the analysis the\ndistrict court must undertake thusly:\nWhere timely and adequate state-court review is available, a\nfederal court sitting in equity must decline to interfere\nwith the proceedings or orders of state administrative\nagencies: (1) when there are “difficult questions of state\nlaw bearing on policy problems of substantial public import\nwhose importance transcends the result in the case at bar”;\nor (2) where the “exercise of federal review of a question\nin a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of state\nefforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a\nmatter of substantial public concern.” \nId. at 361 (quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v.\nUnited States, 424 U.S. 800, 814, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483\n(1976)).  Additionally, the Third Circuit has instructed us that\nthe Burford inquiry must begin with an analysis of whether timely\nPage 22\n\nand adequate state court review is available.  See Riley v.\nSimmons, 45 F.3d 764, 771 (3d Cir. 1995).  \nIn the present case, it is clear that timely and adequate\nstate court review is available.  There is no bar preventing\nPlaintiffs from filing suit in the New Jersey state courts. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs brought their first suit on related matters in\nthe New Jersey state court system.  This court has no doubt that\nthe New Jersey state courts would provide plaintiffs with\nadequate and timely review.  Having made the threshold\ndetermination that adequate and timely state court review is\navailable, this Court must determine whether abstention is\nwarranted under either prong of the NOPSI analysis.\nA district court must abstain under the first prong of NOPSI\nonly if there are “difficult questions of state law bearing on\npolicy problems of substantial public import whose importance\ntranscends the result in the case at bar.”  In this case, the\nstate law in question is not “difficult” in the sense that the\nlaw in Burford was difficult.  The regulations at issue in\nBurford required expertise in the complex area of gas and\ndrilling, and there was a significant probability that courts\nunfamiliar with the industry would err in rendering decisions. \nThat is one of the reasons why Texas elected to have a single\nstate court hear all such claims - so that the adjudicating court\nPage 23\n\nwould have the expertise necessary to come to the correct\nconclusion.\nIn contrast, the state law at issue here is not so difficult\nas to require expertise to properly apply the law.  Plaintiffs’\nstate law claims require interpretation of the New Jersey\nConstitution, New Jersey’s Local Redevelopment and Housing Law,\nN.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq., and New Jersey’s Open Public Meetings\nAct, N.J.S.A. 10:40-6 et seq.  While New Jersey courts will of\ncourse have more experience applying these laws, such is always\nthe case when a federal court hears state law claims. \nInterpretation of these laws is not so difficult to warrant\nabstention under Burford.  Having concluded that Burford\nabstention is not warranted under the first prong of NOPSI, we\nnow turn to the second prong.\nThe second prong of NOPSI requires a district court to\nabstain where the “exercise of federal review of a question in a\ncase and in similar cases would be disruptive of state efforts to\nestablish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of\nsubstantial public concern.”  Defendants contend that this \nCourt’s review would disrupt New Jersey’s policies with respect\nto eminent domain and land use.  Although there is some support\nfor their contention that this Court may abstain under NOPSI’s\nsecond prong, see, e.g., Rucci v. Cranberry Township, 130 Fed.\nAppx. 572 (3d Cir. 2005), those cases are distinguishable and in \nPage 24\n\nany event, do not mandate abstention even in similar\ncircumstances.6  Under Burford, NOPSI, and controlling Third\nCircuit case law, this is not a case where Burford abstention is\nappropriate.\nThe Third Circuit addressed a situation similar to that at\nhand in Heritage Farms, Inc. v. Solebury Township, 671 F.2d 743\n(3d Cir. 1982).  In that case, the plaintiff had challenged,\namong other things, Solebury Township’s denial of a building\npermit.  The district court abstained on the basis of Burford,\nciting the “traditionally local nature of land use decisions and\nthe danger of unwarranted federal interference with such\ntraditionally local functions.”  Heritage Farms, Inc. v. Solebury\nTownship, 507 F. Supp. 33, 35-36 (E.D. Pa. 1980), rev’d, Heritage\nFarms, Inc. v. Solebury Township, 671 F.2d 743 (3d Cir. 1982).  \nHowever, the Third Circuit disagreed with the district\ncourt’s decision to abstain under Burford.  The Court held that \nbecause the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code delegated\nlocal land use decisions to local planning commissions, there was\n“no uniform state policy for land use and development - policies\nnecessarily differ[ed] from municipality to municipality.” \nHeritage Farms, Inc., 671 F.2d at 747.  Indeed, the Court\nexplained that through the plaintiff’s complaint, “[t]he policies\n6 For example, in Rucci, the district court’s decision to\nabstain was based in part on the fact that no federal claims\nremained.  Rucci, 130 Fed. Appx. at 577. \nPage 25\n\nembodied in the Municipalities Planning Code are not being\nattacked - it is rather the application of those policies by a\nsingle township that is at issue.  In fact, if it is found that\nthe defendants acted unlawfully, the state and local policies\nwill be vindicated.”  Id. at 748.\nLikewise, no New Jersey state policy is being attacked here. \nPlaintiffs take issue with a single land use decision by a single\ntownship’s planning board.  Through their lawsuit, Plaintiffs\nhope to uphold New Jersey’s state-wide policies, as embodied in\nthe Local Redevelopment and Housing Law and the New Jersey\nConstitution.  Federal review of this case will not “be\ndisruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy” with\nrespect to land use issues.  Therefore, Burford abstention is\ninappropriate under the second prong of NOPSI.\nHaving decided not to abstain under Burford, this court must\nnow address the issue of supplemental jurisdiction over the\npendent state law claims.  \nIII.  Supplemental Jurisdiction\nDefendants have requested that this Court decline to\nexercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ pendent state\nlaw claims.  In the interests of judicial economy, this Court\nwill exercise supplemental jurisdiction over all justiciable\npendent state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).\nPage 26\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’\nclaims in Counts 1 through 5 and 9 through 12 of the Amended\nComplaint.  These claims are ripe for adjudication, are not moot,\nand are not barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  However,\nCounts 6 through 8 of the Amended Complaint are dismissed as\nmoot.  Counts 13 and 14 of the Amended Complaint are dismissed\nwithout prejudice because they are not ripe for adjudication.  \nThis Court will not abstain from exercising its jurisdiction\nover the justiciable claims.  In the interests of judicial\neconomy, this Court will exercise supplemental jurisdiction over\nall remaining pendent state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1367.\n /s/ Noel L.

There are simply insufficient permissible pages to even attempt a point by \npoint response to Appellants’ alleged issues, let alone its argument.  Despite the \npertinacious attempts by Appellants to create a morass of mythical factual issues \nand divert judicial attention, it is a remarkable aspect of this litigation that very few \nvital facts are actually in dispute. \nIt is undisputed that the Gardens area of Mount Holly is the only blighted \nresidential  neighborhood in the Township as found by the Township pursuant to \nthe Local Redevelopment and Housing Law (N.J.S.A.  40A:12A-1 et seq.) and as \nvalidated by the New Jersey Superior Court trial court, the Appellate Division and \nthe  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  (JA1790,  ¶3  &  JA1810,  ¶119-121).    It  is \nundisputed that the New Jersey Superior Court found the 2002 blight designation \nwas based on the established record that showed “the general condition of the \nstructures [were] substandard, dilapidated, obsolescent and in some cases unsafe \nand unsanitary.”  (JA1369).   It is undisputed that through the State Court review, \nboth  the  State  Trial  and  Appellate  Courts  specifically  found  no  evidence  of \ndiscriminatory intent on the part of the Township in the designation of blight or in \nthe adoption of the redevelopment plan.  (JA1121, JA1128, JA1960 & JA1963). \nIt is undisputed that neither the 2003 Redevelopment Plan, nor the 2005 \n1 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 10      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nRedevelopment  Plan  called  for  “acquisition  of  all  Gardens  homes”  or \n“displacement  and  relocation  of  all  Gardens  residents  out  of  the  community.”  \n(Appellant’s Brief, p.7).  Rather, the 2003 Redevelopment Plan “authorize[d]” the \nTownship to acquire properties through the use of eminent domain, but anticipated \nthat  the  Township would  work  with  affected  property  owners  to  appropriately \nredevelop their own properties, and that the residents might have to relocate during \nconstruction. (JA0863).  Similarly, the 2005 Redevelopment Plan “authorize[d]” \nacquisition,  but  specifically  included  a  rehabilitation  component.  (JA0979  & \nJA0972).  Temporary relocation again was anticipated.  (JA0978).   \nIt is undisputed that Mount Holly Township has acquired over 200 of the \nTownhouses in the area through voluntary sales over the last ten (10) years and has \nnot begun a single eminent domain proceeding.1   (JA2017, ¶130).   These former \nresidents sold their home  or  relocated  for  many  reasons:    some  related to the \nplanned  redevelopment  and  some  unrelated  to  the  implementation  of  the \nRedevelopment Plan, including threatened foreclosure of their homes, new jobs, \nSection 8 issues, non-payment of rent, to attend a new school, overcrowding of the \nresidence, N.J. District attorney seizure of their home, and death.  (JA1850-1874, \n¶11.a, ¶12.b, ¶23a-b, ¶26.a-c &e-f, ¶27.b, ¶27.d, &¶29.b).  \nOf those former residents who relocated through the Township relocation \n                                                 \n1   Although this year the Township has started the appraisal and negotiation \nprocess that precedes eminent domain actions. \n2 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 11      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\noffice, Plaintiffs made no credible allegation that persons  had difficulty finding \nreplacement housing at their desired location.  It is undisputed that many of the \nformer  residents’  economic  situations  improved  as  a  result  of  the  relocation \nprocess.2  (JA1850-1870, ¶11b, ¶12.g, ¶13.d, ¶14.d-e, ¶17.b, ¶18, ¶20.c, ¶23.b, \n¶24.e, ¶26.a-b & ¶26.e)   It is undisputed that the one former resident alleged by \nPlaintiffs to have had difficulty finding replacement housing was Alandia Warthen, \nwho moved  in 2005 as a result of her landlord’s actions, not the Township’s; \nmoreover,  Ms.  Warthen  moved  before  the  Township’s  relocation  office  was \nopened in November, 2006. (JA0627-0628, ¶7 & 10; & JA2675-2678; & JA1815, \n¶149). \nIt is further undisputed that not all Gardens residents wanted to remain in the \nGardens.  Residential surveys from 2000 and 2006 showed that 33% and 39%, \nrespectively,  of  the  residents  polled  expressed  an  interest  in  living  in  a  new \nneighborhood.  (JA0743  &  JA1627).  The    injunction  contains  evidence  of  the \nlocations of 57 of the relocated families.  (JA160-1164).  Of those relocated, 17 \n(30%)  stayed  in  Mount  Holly  and  31  (54%)  relocated  to  other  municipalities \nwithin Burlington County.   Id. \n                                                 \n2   The vast majority of those individuals who were referenced in Ms. Holt’s \nCertification were selected because they were feature stories in the Public \nAdvocate’s Report.  Ms. Holt’s Certification was primarily intended to rebut the \ninaccurate facts contained in the Public Advocate’s Report, on which Plaintiffs’ \nrelied in support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction. \n3 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 12      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nIt is undisputed that there are hundreds of pages of transcripts of dozens of \npublic  meetings  indicating  that  the  Township  wanted  to  get  rid  of  the  crime, \nabsentee landlords and deteriorated properties within in the Gardens area, not the \npeople. (JA1223, JA1224, JA0744, & JA0987-0988).  It is undisputed that many of \nthe members of the Planning Board and Governing Body repeatedly expressed \nconcern about taking care of the Gardens residents as part of the redevelopment \nefforts. (JA2266-2267 & JA2272-2273).  Finally, it is undisputed that the Planning \nBoard  and  Governing  Body  also  indicated  that  they  did  not  want  any  of  the \nresidents to move out of town and that the redevelopment of the Gardens was done \nto better their lives.  (JA0934-0936 & JA2267 & JA1012, p.124, line 23 to p.125, \nline 21 & JA1013, p.127, lines 7-14 & JA1031, p.51, line 24 to p.52, line 11).   \nIt is undisputed that that same record reflects that officials truly believed \nMount Holly had enough affordable housing stock to accommodate everyone who \nwanted to stay.  (JA1012, p.122, lines14-25 & JA1032, p.55, lines 6-13).  It is \nundisputed  that  to  assist  residents  in  finding  affordable  replacement  housing, \nMount Holly Township has paid residents relocation benefits when State law did \nnot  require  such  payments,  at  levels  that  substantially  exceed  State  law \nrequirements.  (JA2475, ¶22, Appellant’s Brief, p.46 & JA1043-1044). \nIn determining the best method of implementing redevelopment within the \narea, the Township was first and foremost concerned with identifying a realistic \n4 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 13      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nand financially feasible plan that would actually result in redevelopment of the \narea. (JA2547).  However, the Township also had the “goal to provide as many \nlow-to-moderate income units as economically feasible.”  (JA1014, p.130, lines \n23-25).  The Township Council was also concerned with adopting a redevelopment \nplan that would  bankrupt the Township.  (JA1346). \nIt is undisputed that as of  May 2008 Mount Holly Township had spent $16 \nmillion in acquisitions and relocations in furtherance of their redevelopment of the \nGardens and had bonded $16.5 million. (JA1346).   \nIt is undisputed that in June 2011, of the original 300 plus townhomes, there \nremain 70 privately owned properties and 52 Township-owned properties currently \nundergoing demolition. \nSTA(cid:4)DARD OF REVIEW \n \nSince  the  standard of  review  for the  grant of summary  judgment  is  “de \nnovo” the Appellate Division must apply the “same standard as that used by the \nDistrict Court”. American Eagle Outfitters v. Lyle & Scott Ltd., 584 F.3d 575, \n581 (3d Cir. 2009). In other words, the Appellate Division must “review the record \nand draw inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Pa. Prot. & \nAdvocacy, Inc. v. Pa. Dept. of Pub. Welfare, 402 F.3d 374, 379 (3d Cir. 2005).   \nWhile it is true that the “non-movant’s allegations are to be taken as true, \nand when they ‘conflict with those of the movant’ they are entitled to the “benefit \n5 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 14      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nof  the  doubt”,  the  non-moving  party  is  required  to  “designate  ‘specific  facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial’”. Blair v. Scott Specialty Gases, 283 \nF.3d 595, 603 (3d Cir. 2002). Specifically, “the nonmoving party must provide \nadmissible evidence containing ‘specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue \nfor trial.” Pa. Prot. & Advocacy, 402 F.3d at 379. To defeat Summary Judgment, \n“a  plaintiff  cannot  simply  rely  on  ‘vague’,  ‘self-serving’  statements  which  are \nunsupported by facts in the record … plaintiff ‘must point to concrete evidence in \nthe record which supports each essential element’ of a claim on which he will bear \nthe burden of proof at trial.” Heffron v. Adamar of New Jersey, Inc., 270 F. Supp. \n2d 562, 574 -575 (D.N.J. 2003). \nApplying  this  standard,  the  District  Court  properly  concluded  “plaintiffs \nhave not provided the requisite proof to take the issues to a jury.” (JA0009). \nARGUME(cid:4)T \n \n \nI. SUMMARY OF ARGUME(cid:4)T \n \nAppellants contend the legal standard is simple.  In a neighborhood of 100 \npeople, where 75 are minorities and 25 are white, a governmental action affecting \nall 100 people equally is prima facie evidence of a “disparate impact” under the \nFair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §3601, et seq. (“FHA”).  Appellants contend affecting \na greater raw number of minorities constitutes “disparate impact.” \nThe Township contends credible allegations that governmental action \n6 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 15      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nadversely affected a substantially greater percentage of minorities as compared to \nthe percentage of whites affected would be prima facie evidence of “disparate \nimpact” under the FHA. \n  This is the legal issue at the core of this case. \n \nAppellants also contend that if they identify any conceptual alternative to the \nTownship’s proposed redevelopment project, they have shown a less restrictive \nmeans.  The Township contends that any alleged less discriminatory means must \nbe realistic, both in terms of capability of being carried out and economic \nfeasibility; it needs to be in the “realm of possibility.”  The Township contends \nthat, throughout the public record of the redevelopment process, it has adequately \nand reasonably considered the less discriminatory means proposed by Appellants \nand found them to be unrealistic. \n \nII. THE DISTRICT COURT PROPERLY GRA(cid:4)TED SUMMARY \nJUDGME(cid:4)T TO THE TOW(cid:4)SHIP. \n \n \nA. Appellants Failed to Allege Facts Sufficient to Support their FHA \nClaims. \n \nThe Township Defendants were properly granted Summary Judgment on  \nthe Plaintiff’s FHA claims because Appellants did not make credible allegations, \nstatistically or otherwise, that housing was being made unavailable “because of” \nrace.  By its express terms, §3604(a) of the FHA makes it unlawful “[t]o refuse to \nsell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the \n7 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 16      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nsale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person \nbecause of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. \n§3604(a). Thus, unless property is (1) denied or made “unavailable”, (2) “because \nof” race, there is no violation of the FHA. \nDiscrimination  “because  of  race”  can  be  established  through  proof  of \nintentional  discrimination,  or  that  \"the  challenged  action  by  defendant  had  a \nracially discriminatory effect.”  Resident Advisory Bd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 147 \n& 148 (3d Cir. 1977). See also Eastampton Center, L.L.C. v. Tp. of Eastampton, \n155 F. Supp. 2d 102, 111 (D.N.J. 2001). Evidence that governmental actions had \nthe effect of removing minorities from an area, leaving an all-white community is \nsufficient to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory effect.  Rizzo, 564 F.2d \nat 149. Discriminatory impact can also be shown where governmental action has \nthe \"undeniable effect of 'bear(ing) more heavily on one race than another.'\"  Id. at \n143. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ FHA case focused on allegations of discriminatory impact.  \nHowever,  neither  discriminatory  impact,  nor  intentional  discrimination  was \nsupported by sufficient allegations to prevail on the cause of action. \n \n1. Appellants’ Statistics did not Show Disparate Adverse Impact. \nAppellants  assert  that  the  Township’s  redevelopment  activities  have  an \nadverse disparate impact on minorities. “Discriminatory effect may be proved by \n8 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 17      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nshowing either ‘adverse impact to a particular minority group’ or ‘harm to the \ncommunity generally by the perpetuation of segregation.’” Koorn v. Lacey Tp., 78 \nFed. Appx. 199, 206, 2003 WL 22366923, 5 (3d Cir. 2003). A prima facie case \nunder  the  disparate  impact  theory  requires  proof  of  the  following:  “‘(1)  the \noccurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices, and (2) a significantly adverse or \ndisproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant's \nfacially neutral acts or practices.’” Lapid-Laurel, L.L.C. v. Zoning Bd. of Adj. of \nTp. of Scotch Plains, 284 F.3d 442, 466 -467 (3d Cir. 2002). \nWhile  it  is  true  that  “[t]ypically,  a  disparate  impact  is  demonstrated  by \nstatistics,” Hallmark Developers, Inc. v. Fulton County, Georgia, 466 F.3d 1276, \n1286  (8th  Cir.  2006),  the  usefulness  of  statistics  in  proving  disparate  impact \n“depends on all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.” Intern. Brotherhood \nof Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977). Statistics are generally considered \nuseful in discrimination cases when the statistical imbalance is a telltale sign of \npurposeful discrimination. Id. at 324, n.20.  \nStatistics  alone  are  proper  in  establishing  a  prima  facie  case  of \ndiscrimination only where “gross statistical disparities can be shown.”  Hazelwood \nSchool Dist. v. U.S., 433 U.S. 299, 307-308 (1977). 3 For example, in Rizzo, the \n                                                 \n3   Both Intern. Brotherhood and Hazelwood School Dist. (later cited) are Title VII \ncases. It has been said that Title VIII FHA cases are “analogous” to Title VII \ncases. Anjelino v. New York Times Co., 200 F.3d 73, 90, n.23 (3d Cir. 1999). \n9 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 18      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nCourt found statistical evidence of discriminatory impact from the elimination of \nan affordable housing project, where 95% of the affordable housing waiting list \nwas non-white. Rizzo, 546 F.2d 143. The Rizzo Court explained that the effect of \nthe canceled housing project was to contribute to maintaining segregated housing \nin Philadelphia.  Id. at 142.  Unlike Rizzo, the District Court correctly found that \nneither gross statistical disparities nor perpetuation of segregation was shown by \nPlaintiffs’ statistical proofs.    \n \na. Appellants  Failed  to  Credibly  Allege  a  Disproportionate \nBurden on Minorities. \n \nAppellants attempt to use statistics to allege a greater adverse impact on \nminorities by pointing out that the Gardens is predominately minority.  (Plaintiff’s \nBrief, p.12). However, it is insufficient to simply allege that an action will affect a \ngreater number of minorities than non-minorities if the degree of harm is the same \nfor both. Edwards v. Johnston County Health Dept., 885 F.2d 1215, 1223 (4th Cir. \n1989). The focus must be on the “the disproportionate burden on minorities”.  \nHuntington Branch NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 938 (2nd Cir.), \naff’d 488 U.S. 15 (1988) (emphasis added).  As explained in Huntington Branch, \n844 F.2d at 938, the proper focus is on the “disproportionate burden on minorities” \n                                                                                                                                                             \nFederal Courts have routinely stated that in reviewing disparate impact claims \nunder  the  FHA,  it  is  appropriate  to  “borrow”  from  Title  VII  caselaw. \nCommunity  Services,  Inc.  v.  Wind  Gap  Mun.  Auth.,  421  F.3d  170,  176, \nn.5 (C.A.3 (Pa.),2005). Lapid-Laurel, 284 F.3d at 466  and Rizzo, 564 F.2d at \n146. \n10 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 19      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nconsidering proportional statistics rather than absolute numbers.  \nA statistical analysis must utilize appropriate comparables.  Mountain Side \nMobile Estate Partnership v. Sect. of HUD, 56 F.3d 1243, 1253 (10th Cir. 1995). \nTo establish disparate impact, “appropriate inquiry is into the impact on the total \ngroup to which the policy or decision applies.” Hallmark Developers, 466 F.3d at \n1286 (internal citations omitted). Thus, a court must look at the total group to \nwhich  a  policy  applies  and  compare  the  impact  on  minorities  to  that  on  non-\nminorities  within  the  group.  Groach  Assoc.  #33,  L.P.  v.  Louisville/Jefferson \nCounty Metro Human Relations Comm’n, 508 F.3d. 366, 378 (6th Cir. 2007).  \nFor example, in Koorn, supra, 78 Fed. Appx. at 206, no disparate impact was \nfound where an ordinance affected all citizens, minorities and white, alike. See also \nDoe v. City of Butler, Pa., 892 F.2d 315, 323 (3d Cir. 1989), (stating plaintiffs \nfailed to show discriminatory effect from an ordinance which primarily impacted \ngroup homes for abused women because the ordinance would have a comparable \neffect on a non-protected group if it were applied to a different type of group home \nsuch as one for recovering alcoholics). Similarly, in Bonvillian v. Lawler-Wood \nHousing, LLC, 242 Fed. Appx. 159, 160 (5th Cir. 2007), no disparate impact on \nminorities was found from the closure of an apartment because “the building is \nclosed to all potential tenants” and therefore, “there is no ‘significantly greater \ndiscriminatory impact on members of a protected class.’” Likewise, in Groach \n11 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 20      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nAssoc., 508 F.3d at 378-379, the Court found no disparate impact even though \n90% of the occupants of an apartment building to be demolished were minority \nbecause the policy applied to all residents of the building.  \nBy contrast, in Betsey v. Turtle Creek Assoc., 736 F.2d 983, 987 (4th Cir. \n1984), disparate impact was found because after considering the group to which \nthe policy applied, it found “[o]f the total number of men, women and children \nliving  in  Building  Three,  74.9  percent  of  the  non-whites  were  given  eviction \nnotices while only 26.4 percent of the whites received such notices.”  Ibid.  Thus, \nthere was a disparate impact.  Ibid.  \nHere,  when  considering  the  total  group  to  which  the  Township’s \nredevelopment policies apply, it is clear that there is no greater impact or burden \non minorities. The ongoing voluntary acquisition of properties and demolition of \nTownship-owned  properties  is  being  applied  to  all  residents  of  the  Gardens, \nregardless  of  race.  It  is  undisputed  that  the  Redevelopment  Plan  calls  for  the \nacquisition and demolition of all the existing homes in the Gardens, without regard \nto race. (JA2009, ¶100 & 125 - Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Fact).  This \nmeans 100% of the minority residents in the area, and 100% of the white residents \nwill have their homes acquired. Even though there are more minorities in the area, \nboth  are  being  impacted  or  burdened  equally.  Appellants’  statistics  did  not \nestablish a disproportionate impact on minorities.  \n12 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 21      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nRather,  their  statistics  establish  that  minorities  are  disproportionately \nrepresented in the redevelopment area. Appellants claim that minorities will be 8 \ntimes and 11 times more affected than non-minorities. (JA2045, ¶11). The reason \nfor this is simple: the Gardens has a high concentration of minority residents and \nminorities are overrepresented in the Gardens area, compared to the rest of Mount \nHolly.  (JA0069, ¶30 & JA0070, ¶32). \nMerely establishing a disproportionate representation alone is insufficient to \nestablish discrimination. As explained in City of Memphis v. Greene,  \nBecause urban neighborhoods are so frequently characterized by a \ncommon ethnic or racial heritage, a regulation's adverse impact on a \nparticular  neighborhood  will  often  have  a  disparate  effect  on  an \nidentifiable  ethnic  or  racial  group.  To  regard  an  inevitable \nconsequence of that kind as a form of stigma so severe as to violate \nthe Thirteenth Amendment would trivialize the great purpose of that \ncharter of freedom. Proper respect for the dignity of the residents of \nany neighborhood requires that they accept the same burdens as well \nas the same benefits of citizenship regardless of their racial or ethnic \norigin. \n \n451  U.S.  100,  128  (1981).4 Rather,  if  a  consequence  of  a  particular  action  is \nunavoidable, there can be no inference of discriminatory intent. See Edwards, 885 \nF.2d  at  1223  (stating  that  simply  showing  that  the  majority  of  migrant  farm \nworkers were minorities, without more, did not establish disparate adverse impact \n                                                 \n4   The  FHA  was  enacted  pursuant  to  the  Congressional  Power  under  the \nThirteenth  Amendment.  Mitchell  v.  Cellone,  389  F.3d  86,  87  -88 (3d  Cir. \n2004). \n \n13 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 22      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nbecause “any policy or action taken with respect to these workers will necessarily \naffect more non-white than white migrant workers”). See also Jones v. HUD, 390 \nF.  Supp.  587  (E.D.La.  1974) (stating  the  Court  should  not  “infer”  racial \ndiscrimination  is  a  motivating  factor  behind  a  decision  to  close  an  apartment \nsimply because the majority of the occupants are minority).   \nGiven the Garden’s racial composition, there was no way for the Township \nto undertake redevelopment of the area without affecting more minorities than \nwhites simply because there are more of them in the area.  In granting Summary \nJudgment, the lower Court explained the flaw in Plaintiffs’ logic:  \n[U]nder Plaintiffs’ logic, any action by the Township to do anything \nwith regard to the Gardens would result in a disparate impact, simply \nbecause of the racial composition of the Gardens.  The FHA (or any \nother civil rights law) does not contemplate that a town will never be \npermitted to ameliorate a blighted area inhabited mainly by minorities \nsimply because it will affect minorities. \n \n(JA0016). Affecting more minorities than non-minorities is simply an unavoidable \nconsequence of the Township’s redevelopment efforts and does not amount to an \ninference of discriminatory intent. \nSince 100% of  minorities  and 100% of  non-minorities  will  be burdened \nequally,  Plaintiffs’  statistics  fail  to  prove  there  is  a  greater  adverse  impact  on \nminorities. \n \n \n14 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 23      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nb.  Appellants  Failed  to  Show  a  Disparate  Impact  on  the \nGeneral Minority Population. \n \nTo support their claim of disparate impact, Appellants also claim that more \nof the minority population lives in poverty and therefore destruction of inexpensive \nblighted housing would have a greater impact on minorities in general.  \nAppellants equate blighted, cheap housing with “affordable” housing, a term \nin  New  Jersey  that  equates  with  housing  that  is  certified  compliant  with \nhabitability  and  income  restrictions  under  the  Council  on  Affordable  Housing \n(COAH). \nAppellants’ expert opined that low-income residents “are disproportionately \nAfrican-American  and  Hispanic.”  (JA2047,  ¶14).  However,  a  mere  statistical \ncorrelation between poverty and a particular race or ethnicity does not transform \ndiscrimination against poor people into racial discrimination. Ybarra v. Town of \nLos Altos Hills, 503 F.2d 250, 253 (9th Cir. 1974).   \nAppellants’ expert also opined that only households above 80% of the area \nmedian  income  can  afford  to  move  into  the  proposed  Project.  (JA2047,  ¶18). \nBecause  the  homes  with  the  Gardens  are  currently  “affordable”  to  low  and \nmoderate income families, Appellants’ conclude that acquisition and demolition of \nthe homes in the Gardens and replacement of the homes with more expensive \nmarket  rate  homes  will  have  a  disproportionally  adverse  effect  on  minorities. \n(JA1991,  ¶30  &  JA2003,  ¶82  &  JA2033,  ¶206-208  -  Plaintiffs’  Statement  of \n15 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 24      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nUndisputed Fact). \nHowever,  as  the  District  Court  explained,  “[t]he  FHA  prohibits  the \nTownship from making unavailable a dwelling to any person because of race – it \ndoes not speak to income.”  (JA0014).   \nAppellants’ statistics show that the percentage difference between whites \nand minorities who can afford the new housing is a slim margin. Appellants’ 2008 \nEmulated CHAS Table shows approximately 64.5% of the minority households \nhave incomes above 80% of the Median Family Income5 compared to 72.7% of \nwhite households. (JA2070). This is also consistent with the Census Data provided \nby  the  Township,  which  showed  that  65.92%  of  the  African  American  and \nHispanic population in Burlington County have incomes above 80% of the median \nincome  of  $44,580.6   (JA2679-2680).  Thus,  the  act  of  replacing  the  cheaper, \nblighted units with market rate units will only affect 35.5% of minority versus \n27.3% of white households or 8.2% more minority households.7 \n                                                 \n5   This figure is derived from subtracting the number of Non-Hispanic Black and \nHispanic households below 80% from the total households (all income levels) \nand dividing by the total households, i.e. (29,543 – 10,475) / 29,543 = 0.645432 \nor about 64.5%. \n6   This figure is derived from adding all the minority households (both Hispanic \nand African American) with incomes of $45,000 or higher and dividing by the \ntotal number of Hispanic and African American households. \n7   Appellants’  2008  Emulated  CHAS  Table  shows  that  23.4%  of  the  white \naffordable housing in the Gardens will be lost, compared to 74.4% minority \noccupied  affordable  housing.    (JA2070).  However,  these  figures  are  only \n16 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 25      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nAffecting 8.2% more minorities than non-minorities is not a “gross statistical \ndisparity”.    See  Hazelwood  School  Dist.,  supra,  433  U.S.  at  307-308  (stating \nstatistics alone are proper in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination only \nwhere “gross statistical disparities can be shown”).    \nIn addition, when you compare the total households with incomes below \n80% of the median income with those of white and minorities, it appears that a \ngreater number of whites are affected than minorities. Approximately 71.8% of the \nhouseholds  below  80%  median  income  are  white,  compared  to  22%  who  are \nminority.8 (JA2070).  Likewise,  66.8%  of  the  households  below  50%  median \nincome  are  white,  compared  to  26.5%  minority.  Id.  In  other  words,  the  vast \nmajority of the households in need of affordable housing are white. \nIn Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp. v. Village of Arlington Heights, 558 \nF.2d 1283, 1291 (7th Cir. 1977), statistics similar to those presented by Appellants \nin this case was considered “relatively weak” support for a disparate impact claim. \nThe Court stated,  \nIt is true that the Village's refusal to rezone had an adverse impact on \na  significantly  greater  percentage  of  the  nonwhite  people  in  the \nChicago area than of the white people in that area. But it is also true \nthat  the  class  disadvantaged  by  the  Village's  action  was  not \n                                                                                                                                                             \nreflective  of  the  fact  that  the  Gardens  area  is  predominately  occupied  by \nminorities (nearly 75%). (JA0069, ¶29 & 30). \n8   These  figures  are  derived  by  dividing  the  number  of  white  and  minority \nhouseholds  below  80%  median  income  by  the  total  number  of  households \nbelow 80% median income (i.e., 34,206 ÷ 47,611 = 0.718). \n17 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 26      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\npredominantly nonwhite, because sixty percent of the people in the \nChicago area eligible for federal housing subsidization in 1970 were \nwhite. \n \nBy contrast, in Rizzo, where adverse impact was found, the Court noted that the \ncanceled housing project would affect about 14,000 to 15,000 people on a public \nhousing waiting list, of which 95% were minority and 5% were non-minority. \nRizzo, supra, 564 F.2d at 142.   \n  Here, the statistics show that the majority of the households who would need \nand/or qualify for affordable housing (with incomes below 50% and 80% median \nincome) are white. Thus, like Arlington Heights, Appellants’ statistics regarding \nadverse impact on minorities are weak and therefore, the District Court properly \nfound that Appellants failed to present facts to defeat Summary Judgment. \n    c.  Appellants’ Statistics Fail to Show a Segregative Effect. \n \nFinally,  Plaintiffs’  allege  that  redevelopment  will  drive  the  minority \npopulation out of Mount Holly. Historically, statistics have been used to show a \npolicy will perpetuate segregation.  In Rizzo, 564 F.2d at 142, the Court relied on \nstatistics to show disparate impact, where the cancellation of a housing project \nwould perpetuate segregation.  The Court noted that the waiting list for the project \nwas 95% minorities and that the area in which the housing project was to be \nlocated had recently become 99.9% white.  Id. at 140 & 142. Because the project \n“was a unique opportunity for these Blacks living in racially impacted areas of \n18 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 27      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nPhiladelphia  to  live  in  an  integrated,  non-racially  impacted  neighborhood,” \n“[c]ancellation  of  the  project  erased  that  opportunity  and  contributed  to  the \nmaintenance of segregated housing.”  Id. a 142. \nHere,  Appellants’  claim  their  statistics  showed  that  the  Township’s \nredevelopment perpetuates segregation by causing Mt. Holly’s minority population \nto  be  “drastically  reduced.”    (Appellants’  Brief,  p.13).    Appellants’  statistics \nindicated  that  the  displaced  population  is  75%  minority  and  “a  much  smaller \npercentage of minority households – only 21% – would be able to afford the newly \nredeveloped community.” Id. at p.12-13. Appellants’ concluded that this translated \ninto a reduction of the minority population within the Township.   \nThe  District  Court,  however,  found  Appellants’  arguments  unavailing, \nstating,  \n[P]laintiffs have not demonstrated that the Township is preventing \nminorities  from  purchasing  or  moving  into  the  new  homes,  or \notherwise limiting the new residents to non-minorities. Plaintiffs have \nnot provided any proof or statistics to suggest that the new homes \ncreated by the redevelopment will be financially out-of-reach for all or \nmost minorities. \n \n(JA0015).  In a footnote, the Court noted that Appellants’ statistics were based on \nold 2000 Census numbers, and that the 2008 Census numbers “evidence” “the \nminority population’s ability to occupy all 464 market rate homes.” (JA0016, n.9). \nThe Court explained,  \nThese statistics hold very little validity to show a disparate impact on \n19 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 28      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nthe Township’s minority population for several reasons: (1) they take \ninto account the entire population of Burlington County, rather than \nonly Mt. Holly Township, and the towns in Burlington County are of \nvarious economic and racial compositions (2) they do not account for \nminorities  who  will  move  into  Mt.  Holly  Township  from  outside \nBurlington County; (3) they do not account for the deed restricted \nunits that will be more affordable; (4) they do not account for a non-\nminority purchaser who rents to a minority; (5) they do not account \nfor  the  minorities  who  will  move  elsewhere  within  Mt.  Holly \nTownship; and (6) more recent population survey data (from 2008, \ncompared to the 2000 Census data used by plaintiffs’ expert) shows \n16,744  African-Americans  and  Hispanic  households  in  Burlington \nCounty have incomes exceeding $45,000, evidence of the minority \npopulations ability to occupy all 464 market rate homes. \n \nId. \nAppellants’ statistics do not show evidence of perpetuation of segregation. \nRather,  the  undisputed  facts  show  that  redevelopment  will  further  integration. \nInitially,  the  Gardens  was  heavily  segregated,  with  a  significant  low-income \nminority population of 75%, compared to a 33.3% minority population for the rest \nof the Mt. Holly. (JA1987, ¶13 & 10 - Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts). \nThe  redevelopment  project  will  have  the  effect  of  creating  a  more  integrated \nhousing  project,  dispersing  poverty  concentration  by  limiting  the  affordable \nhousing units and comingling them with market rate housing. (JA1987, ¶11 & 13, \n& JA1991, ¶30 - Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts). Since the proposed \nredevelopment project will result in a more integrated, mixed-income community \nthan previously existed, Appellants have failed to show evidence of a segregating \neffect.  \n20 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 29      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nThe Township’s redevelopment efforts are consistent with the underlying \npurposes of the FHA. As explained in S. Camden Citizens in Action v. N.J. Dep’t \nof Env. Prot., 254 F. Supp. 2d 486, 500 (D.N.J. 2003), “the underlying policy \nbehind Title VIII is to encourage the dispersion of urban ghettos and to create more \nintegrated  neighborhoods.  See  114  Cong.  Rec.  2985  (1968) (statement of  Sen. \nProxmire) (noting that Title VIII will establish ‘a policy of dispersal through open \nhousing ... look[ing] to the eventual dissolution of the ghetto and the construction \nof  low  to  moderate  income  housing  in  the  suburbs.’).”  Adverse  impact  is  not \nshown  where  a  proposed  housing  project  results  in  a  more  integrated,  mixed-\nincome  housing  complex  than  what  previously  existed.  Strykers  Bay \nNeighborhood Council, Inc. v. The City of New York, 695 F. Supp. 1531, 1542-\n1543 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \nMoreover,  unlike  in  Rizzo,  Mount  Holly  is  not  a  community  which  is \npredominately white. Rather, as of 2000, it was only 66.2% white. (JA1987, ¶13 - \nPlaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts). At Summary Judgment, over two-thirds \n(2/3) of the residents in the Gardens had relocated. (JA1985, ¶3 & JA2024, ¶163 - \nPlaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts). Appellants fail to identify any fact to \nshow  that  Mount  Holly’s  minority  population  decreased  as  a  result  of  the \nredevelopment  activities.  Rather,  American  Community  Survey  Demographic \n21 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 30      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nEstimates from the 2005 to 20099 show that Mount Holly’s minority population \nhas  actually  grown  over  the  last  few  years. \nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ACSSAFFFacts?_event=&geo_id=06000US34\n00548900&_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US34%7C05000US34005%7C0600\n0US3400548900&_street=&_county=mount+holly%2C+nj&_cityTown=mount+h\nolly%2C+nj&_state=&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=&_useEV=&p\nctxt=fph&pgsl=060&_submenuId=factsheet_1&ds_name=null&_ci_nbr=null&qr_\nname=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry,  last  visited  2-28-11.  In \n2000, Mt. Holly was comprised of 66.2% white, while population estimates from \n2005 to 2009 indicate the white population has declined to 63.3%. (Id. & JA1987, \n¶10 - Plaintiffs’ Statement of Undisputed Facts). Thus, Plaintiffs’ did not make \ncredible allegations to show redevelopment has or will reduce Mt. Holly’s minority \npopulation. \n \n2. Appellants’ Allegations Fail to Show Intentional Discrimination. \nUnder the FHA, intentional discrimination can be shown two ways, either by \nshowing disparate treatment, or by showing that a discriminatory purpose was the \nmotivating factor behind the governmental action. Eastampton Center, supra, 155 \nF. Supp. 2d at 122.  Ordinarily questions of intent must be decided by the fact-\n                                                 \n9   The Court is permitted to take judicial notice of Census data.  See Citizens \nFinancial Group, Inc. v. Citizens Nat. Bank of Evans City, 383 F.3d 110, 127 n. \n2 (3d Cir. 2004). \n22 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 31      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nfinder. U.S. v. Branella, 972 F. Supp. 294, 299 (D.N.J. 1997). “However, on a \nmotion for summary judgment, if the non-moving party does not provide sufficient \nevidence  to  support  each  element  of  the  prima  facie  case,  the  case  does  not \nwithstand summary judgment and the fact finder need never address the factual \nquestion of intent.”  Ibid.   \nAs discussed above, there was no credible allegation of disparate impact \nbecause the Township’s redevelopment designation and redevelopment plan were \nfacially  neutral  and  treated  all  residents  alike  regardless  of  race.  As  to \ndiscriminatory  purpose,  the  District  Court  determined  that  Plaintiffs  failed  to \nprovide sufficient facts to defeat summary judgment, noting, \n[P]laintiffs tell a story, long on accusations and suppositions but short \non proof, of the Township’s ten-year, insidious desire to displace the \nminority population of Mt. Holly. If there were merit to these claims, \nplaintiffs  would  be  able  to  annotate  their  allegations  with  factual \nevidence that would infer such discriminatory motive. They have not \ndone so. \n \n(JA0024-0025).  The  Court  also  stated  “[i]n  contrast,  the  Township  provides \ntranscripts of town council and planning board meetings, where concerned citizens \nand  council  members  discussed  the  plans  for  the  Gardens.”  (JA0026).  These \ndocuments,  the  Court  noted,  showed  the  “Township’s  consideration  of  the \nresidents’  concerns”  and  that  “their  input  was  welcomed  and  encouraged.”  Id. \nRather  than  evidencing  discrimination,  the  Court  found  that  the  documented \nevidence showed the Township was motivated by the need to cure the “extensive \n23 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 32      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\ndeterioration, crime, and overall unsafe living conditions” and by the “significant \nconcern for the Gardens’ resident’s welfare”. (JA0027). \nDiscriminatory intent or purpose can be established through the weighing of \nseveral factors:  (1) “discriminatory impact”; (2) the challenged action’s “historical \nbackground” or the action’s legislative history; (3) “‘sequence of events leading up \nto  the  challenged  decisions’”;  (4)  any  departure  from  “‘normal  procedural \nsequences’”; and (5) any departure from or “normal substantive criteria”.  Rizzo, \nsupra,  564  F.2d  at  143,  citing  Village  of  Arlington  Heights  v.  Metropolitan \nHousing  Development  Corp.,   429  U.S.  252,  265 (1977).  This  fact-sensitive \nanalysis must start from the presumption that governmental actors generally act \nconstitutionally. McKnight v. Hayden, 65 F. Supp. 2d 113, 120 (E.D.N.Y.1999). \nThis means “‘courts should be ‘reluctant to attribute unconstitutional motives to \nthe state, particularly where a plausible [constitutional] purpose may be discovered \nfrom the face of the statute.’” Ibid.  \nAppellants failed to make the required showing and the District Court \nproperly granted summary judgment to the Township. \n \na. Removal  of  Blight  was  the  Motivating  Factor  for  the \nTownship’s Actions. \n \nThe  facts  of  record  showed  that  the  true  motivating  factor  behind  the \nTownship’s Actions was the removal of blight.  Appellants are really claiming that \nthe Township’s selection of the Gardens area for redevelopment was done with \n24 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 33      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nintent to discriminate against minorities.  This issue was litigated in State courts \nand those courts specifically found no evidence of discriminatory intent in the \nredevelopment  designation  or  adoption  of  a  redevelopment  plan.      (JA1121, \nJA1128, JA1133, JA1160 & JA1163)  \nIn  this  case,  based  on  the  extensive  public  record,  the  District  Court \nspecifically found that “but-for the significant concern for the Gardens’ residents’ \nwelfare, and the desire to make the Township as a whole a safe and pleasant town \nfor all of its citizens, minority and non-minority, the Township would have never \nundertaken the long-overdue project…” (JA0027).  Moreover, the District Court \nnoted, “plaintiffs could not dispute the ironic observation that if the Township had \nallowed the Gardens to continue to deteriorate as it had over the years, that it might \nthen be fairly characterized as having a discriminatory intent towards its minority, \nlow-income residents.” (JA0027, n.18). \nThe evidence showed Appellants’ housing was being made unavailable, not \nbecause of race, but because it had become blighted.  All acquisition of housing by \nthe  Township  was done  and  will  continue  to be done  for the  sole purpose of \neffectuating the Redevelopment Plan for the area. (JA2251-2252 & JA1690).  \nLikewise, the evidence shows that the new housing to be built as part of the \nRedevelopment Project may be unavailable to Appellants because of income, not \nrace. Appellants’ certifications make clear that the new housing will be unavailable \n25 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 34      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nto  Appellants  because  they  cannot  afford  it,  not  because  of  race.    (Compare \nJA2129 with JA2131 & JA0613 with JA1795, ¶32).  See also JA2025, ¶165. In \nfact, several of the Plaintiffs are white. (JA1793, ¶15 & JA1795, ¶¶29, 30, 32 & 35 \n&JA1796, ¶40). \nAs recognized by the District Court in granting Summary Judgment,  “if \nnone of the plaintiffs can afford the new homes, it is not just the African-American \nand Hispanic plaintiffs who are impacted by the increased housing prices -- it is all \nGardens  residents,  including  the  Caucasion  residents.”  (JA0015).  The  District \nCourt concluded, “[t]he FHA prohibits the Township from making unavailable a \ndwelling to any person because of race -- it does not speak to income.”  (JA0014).  \nPoverty is not a suspect classification, Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 323 (1980). \nThus, the District Court properly found that there was no credible allegation \nof intentional discrimination. \n \nb. There is not Discriminatory Impact. \n \nWith  regard  to  the  first  factor  of  the  Arlington  Heights/Rizzo  test,  the \nevidence supports the Trial Court’s granting of Summary Judgment finding that \nthere was no discriminatory impact. \n \nc. The Historical Background Demonstrates (cid:4)o Discriminatory \nIntent. \n   \n  Evidence of historical background is relevant “if it establishes an ongoing \npattern of discrimination against the plaintiff class.” Jean v. Nelson, 711 F.2d \n26 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 35      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n1455, 1490 (11th Cir. 1983) (emphasis added). Moreover, to be relevant, historical \nbackground evidence must be “reasonably contemporaneous with the challenged \ndecision.”  McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987).  Actions taken too \nfar in the past are simply not indicative of current discriminatory intent.  Id. \n  Here, the challenged governmental action is actually twofold:  First, in the \nprocess  of  the  voluntary  acquisition  of  properties  and  demolition  of  those \nproperties and, second, in the adoption and implementation of a redevelopment \nplan  for  the  Gardens.  Appellants  identify  numerous  programs  that  previously \nattempted, prior to the redevelopment designation, to redevelop or improve the \nGardens,  but  which  they  allege  the  Township  refused  to  consider  or  failed  to \nadequately support. (JA2386-2389, ¶¶29, 30 & 32).  \nHowever,  the  New  Jersey  Courts  have  already  concluded  that  the \nTownship’s prior actions with respect to the Gardens up through August 30, 2005 \nreveal “not a scintilla of evidence of discriminatory motivation by defendants.” \n(JA1960). It was specifically acknowledged that “[t]he historical background of the \nredevelopment effort has been explored in detail in the Court’s prior opinions. So, \ntoo, have the procedural and substantive sequences of events. Nothing nefarious \nhas been suggested nor has anything of that nature been uncovered.”  Id. \n  Yet, despite this explicit finding, Appellants still cite to the same Township \nactions, specifically found by State Courts to be non-discriminative, as evidence of \n27 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 36      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\ndiscriminatory  intent,  which  is  simply  irrelevant  to  a  claim  of  intentional \ndiscrimination. Such facts are insufficient to establish discriminatory intent.  See \nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 625 (1982) (historical background evidence is \nrelevant “where the evidence shows that discriminatory practices were commonly \nutilized, that they were abandoned when enjoined by courts or made illegal by civil \nrights legislation, and that they were replaced by laws and practices which, though \nneutral on their face, serve to maintain the status quo”). See also In re Graham, 973 \nF.2d  1089,  1097  (3d  Cir.1992)  (citations  omitted)  (explaining  when  issue \npreclusion applies). The historical background of the Township’s actions clearly \nshows a lack of discriminatory intent by the Township.  \n \nd. The Administrative History and Sequence of Events Leading \nUp to the Adoption of the Redevelopment Plan Show (cid:4)o \nDiscriminatory Intent. \n \n  As to the third factor in the Arlington Heights/Rizzo test, the administrative \nhistory and sequence of events leading up to the adoption of the Redevelopment \nPlan, the evidence is clear that the Townships actions were not racially motivated.  \nAgain, it must be noted these allegations were litigated in State court and found \nwithout merit.  (JA1960).   \n  The relevance of the sequence of events is explained by the following: \n“Environment illuminates the meaning of acts, as context does that of \nwords. What a man is up to may be clear from considering his bare \nacts  by  themselves;  often  it  is  made  clear  when  we  know  the \nreciprocity  and  sequence  of  his  acts  with  those  of  others,  the \n28 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 37      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\ninterchange  between  him  and  another,  the  give  and  take  of  the \nsituation.”  \n \nCramer v. U.S., 325 U.S. 1, 33 (1945).   \nSimilarly,  legislative  or  administrative  history  is  “highly  relevant”  when \naccompanied by “contemporary statements by members of the decision making \nbody, minutes of its meetings, or reports.”  Arlington Heights, supra, 429 U.S. at \n268. When considering the underlying motive of a multi-member decision-making \nbody, “an element of causation is a necessary part of plaintiff’s showing.” Sylvia \nDev. Corp. v. Calvert County, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 819, n.2 (4th Cir., 1995).  This is \nbecause “‘[w]hat motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not \nnecessarily  what  motivates  scores  of  others  to  enact  it,  and  the  stakes  are \nsufficiently high to eschew guesswork.” McCauley v. City of Jacksonville, N.C., \n739 F. Supp. 278, 281-82 (E.D.N.C. 1989), quoting U.S. v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, \n383-84 (1967). \n  The  legislative  record  and  statements  made  by  the  Planning  Board  and \nTownship Council members demonstrate that the Township was concerned first \nand  foremost  with  finding  a  plan  for  redevelopment  that  would  actually  and \nrealistically result in the redevelopment of the Gardens and that would improve the \nquality of life for the residents there and for the town at large. “There is no reason \nto  look  for  hidden  reasons  and  racial  motivation”  behind a government  action \nwhen there is an obvious alternative explanation for the action. Jones v. U.S. Dept. \n29 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 38      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nof Housing and Urban Devel., 390 F. Supp. 579, 587 (D.C.La. 1974). \nVarious  entities,  including  the  Township,  had  repeatedly  attempted  to \nimprove the Gardens and the quality of life for the residents in the Gardens over \nthe years, but nothing has worked.  As explained by the former Mayor,  \n[M]any people over the years have tried many, many projects, many \nthings to address the problem in the Gardens.  Two of those problems \nhave  not  been  able  to  be  resolved.    One  is  the  large  volume  of \nabsentee landlord held units…. The last and the next problem is the \nspecific condition of some of the houses … one alternative might have \nbeen to try to do it with the buildings that we have now.  To move \npeople out, to rebuild the buildings and to move them back in.  That \nprocess had been tried. \n \n (JA0870-0871). These sentiments were echoed by a former Mayor and Council \nperson, \nFifteen years ago when I sat where you are sitting the Council applied \nfor and received millions of dollars in grants, in rental rehab monies, a \nlot  of  different  programs  to  make  the  Gardens…  Many  of  our \nresidents and in the County were members of Mount Holly 2000 and \ndevoted an enormous amount of time without pay to upgrade units on \nSaul Place, South Martin. And it just seems that no matter what was \ndone or what was invested, the stigma did not go away. \n \n(JA2536-2537). Planning Board members also recognized the limited effect of past \nattempts to resolve the problems of the Gardens, \nAs  you  know,  many,  many  years  sitting  on  Council,  patchwork \nattempts by Mount Holly 2000 and other, you know, well-intentioned \ngroups that picked up a few houses.  But this group was so small it \ndidn’t make any major impact on the neighborhood. I think it’s long \noverdue that we take a comprehensive look. And I think this is the \nfirst step towards it. \n… \n30 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 39      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n  I know I for one have long been concerned about the quality of \nlife in the Mount Holly Gardens.  There have been plans, Mount Holly \n2000.  I was with it when it was brainstormed, when the Committee \nfirst came together with the idea that they would have Mount Holly \nGardens renovated by the year 2000.   \n \n  I saw Genesis come in with their plans.  I’ve seen Hearts of \nHope come in with a group from the mid-west work on the houses.  \nAll  that  was  very,  very  good,  but  there  was  no  large  scale \ndevelopment plan.  And this is what we need and this is I hope the \ndirection we’re going in. \n \n(JA2495 & JA2504-2505).   \nNothing in the legislative history nor the sequence of events leading up to \nthe adoption of the Redevelopment Plan suggested that the Township’s motivation \nwas  anything  other  than  to  find  a  workable  solution  that  appropriately  and \npermanently addresses the blighting conditions found in the Gardens. Appellants \nmake no credible allegation of intentional discrimination. \n \ne. There were no Departures from (cid:4)ormal Procedural or \nSubstantive (cid:4)orms. \n \n  Finally, as to the fourth and fifth factor in the Arlington Heights/Rizzo test, \nAppellants failed to point to sufficient facts to show substantial departures from \nnormal procedural or substantive norms. The District Court observed the record \nshowed  that  the  Township  took  extra  measures  to  listen  to  and  consider  the \nGardens’ residents’ concerns regarding redevelopment. (JA0026).   \nAppellants’ allege violations of the Open Public Meetings Act in adopting \n2008  amendments  to  the  redevelopment  plan  and  other  earlier  procedural \n31 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 40      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nirregularities as evidence of departures from procedural and substantive norms. \n(JA0026-0027, n.17).  The State Courts have concluded the redevelopment process \nwas  completed  in  compliance  with  State  law,  finding  no  evidence  of  any \ndiscriminatory  intent.    Moreover,  if  Appellants  believed  any  later  Township \nactions carried out after the State court litigation violated statutory requirements \nunder redevelopment or Open Public Meeting laws, they should have appealed \nsuch actions to State Court.  The Appellants have shown no reluctance to litigate \nand yet they never challenged the recent actions they continue to complain of. \nAs to substantive departures, Appellants essentially argue that because the \nTownship has not undertaken redevelopment in the manner in which Appellants \nhave  dictated,  the  Township  is  discriminating  against  them.  However,  these \nallegations show nothing more than Appellants’ dissatisfaction with the legislative \nprocess in the adoption of the Redevelopment Plan, which is insufficient to show \nintentional discrimination.  See Moore v. Detroit School Reform Bd., 293 F.3d \n352, 369-70 (6th Cir. 2002) (“rejection of amendments and choice of methods to \naddress  the  perceived  problems  of  the  DPS  is  simply  the  operation  of  the \ndemocratic process” and “allegations that the Legislature acted with haste and did \nnot engage in extensive fact-finding might be a legitimate and even a valid critique \nof its behavior, but it does not lead to an inference of racial discrimination”).  \nRather, the undisputed evidence showed that the Township appropriately \n32 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 41      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nevaluated  the  factors  normally  considered  by  public  entities  undertaking \nredevelopment.  (JA2547). The Township’s first and foremost consideration was \nthe  adoption  of  a  plan  that  would  actually  and  realistically  result  in  the \nredevelopment of the area.   \nThe  evidence  supports  the  Township’s  focused  interest  in  assisting  all \nGardens’ residents during the redevelopment process.  The Township voluntarily \nbought  houses  and/or  provided  relocation  benefits  to  residents  who  sought \nassistance from the Township for personal reasons, such as personal economics, \npending/threatened  foreclosures  and/or  evictions,  and  illegal  tenancies  (i.e. \novercrowded  conditions).  (JA1850-1874,  ¶11.a,  ¶12.b,  ¶23a&b,  ¶26.a-c  &  e-f, \n¶27.b & d, ¶29.b).  In addition, the Township provided a variety of social services \nto  residents  who  sought  relocation  assistance,  which  was  not  required  by  the \nrelocation laws. (JA1844-1847, ¶6); N.J.S.A. 20:4-1 et seq. and N.J.S.A. 52:31B-1 \net seq. \nIn addition, the Township provided relocation benefits above and beyond \nwhat  was  required  by  law.  Specifically,  the  Township  provided  double  the \nrelocation  benefits  required  under  law  to  anyone  who  has  relocated.  Compare \n$7,500  given  to  tenants  with  N.J.S.A.  40:4-6  (assistance  “not  to  exceed  $ \n4,000…”) and $35,000 given to homeowners with N.J.A.C. 5:11-3.7(a) (assistance \n“not to exceed $ 15,000”).  (JA0073, ¶40).  \n33 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 42      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n  It is clear that the Township went above and beyond any legal requirements \nit had in undertaking redevelopment to ensure that the needs of the residents within \nthe  Redevelopment  Area  were  adequately  met.    The  District  Court  noted  that \n“evidence in the record shows that many relocated residents have been pleased \nwith the process, and are now in a much better place as a result. (JA0027-0028).  It \nalso noted that “evidence demonstrates that many residents now have significantly \nimproved living conditions and are in better circumstances financially.”  (JA0025, \nn.16).   \nAppellants  fail  to  make  any  credible  allegations  of  intentional \ndiscrimination. \n \n3. The Township Established a Bona Fide Interest and Proof of (cid:4)o Less \nRestrictive Means. \n \nIn this case, all levels of the New Jersey State Courts considered and upheld \nthe Township’s Redevelopment designation of the Gardens and the Redevelopment \nPlan. (JA1125 at *14, JA1133, & JA1368-1370. Both the N.J. and U.S. Supreme \nCourts have recognized that community redevelopment constitutes a legitimate and \nbona  fide  interest  of  the  State.10 Gallenthin  Realty  Dev.,  Inc.  v.  Borough  of \nPaulsboro, 924 A.2d 447, 459 (N.J. Sup. Ct. 2007) and Kelo v. New London, 545 \nU.S. 469, 484-85 (2005). When addressing FHA claims, the courts have said, “if \n                                                 \n10  Appellants  never  challenged  the  Township’s  legitimate  interest  in \nredevelopment.    Rather,  they  focus  their  arguments  on  the  less  restrictive \nmeans. \n34 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 43      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nthe  defendant  is  a  governmental  body  acting  within  the  ambit  of  legitimately \nderived authority, we will less readily find that its action violates the Fair Housing \nAct.” Arlington Heights, supra, 558 F.2d at 1293.  Thus, it was undisputed that the \nTownship’s interest in redeveloping the Gardens was a bona fide governmental \ninterest. \nOnce the bona fide interest is shown, the government entity must show there \nis no less restrictive means. Rizzo, supra, 564 F.2d at 149.  In upholding the blight \ndesignation, the New Jersey Appellate Division noted that the blighting conditions \nin the neighborhood included dilapidation of the units, overcrowding, excessive \nland  coverage,  diverse  ownership  and  faulty  arrangement.    (JA1124-1125).    It \nnoted that  \n[A] majority of the rear yards were paved or covered with gravel to \naccommodate additional parking spaces … the alleyways created a \nfaulty arrangement or design for the Gardens because it increased the \namount of crime in the area. The dilapidated, overcrowded, poorly \ndesigned community, in addition to the high level of crime in the area, \nis clearly detrimental to the safety, health, morals and welfare of the \ncommunity. \n. . .  \n“And the problems created by that diverse ownership pattern is that \nthere was an inability to address portions of this development that \nhave common-that function in common with each other. One was the \ndriveway, one other is roof systems, building facades. One unit is \neffected [sic] by the lack of maintenance to the exterior, including the \nsides and the rooftop and the landscaping of the property next door. \nAnd its just exacerbated because you have all of these lots in diverse \nownership without any type of mechanism for ensuring that they are \nmaintained and adequately kept up, so that the area as a whole can \nimprove.” \n35 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 44      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n. . . \n[The Township’s Planner] also explained how the diverse ownership \nin the form of absentee landlords contributed to maintenance issues. \nBecause many of the residents in the Gardens are renters, there is less \nincentive to invest in the property and improve it.  \n   \nId.  None of the problems that caused the blight, the overcrowding, excess land \ncoverage, faulty arrangements due to the alleys, the absentee landlords and lack of \nhomeowner’s  association  to  address  common  areas,  can  be  remedied  without \nredesigning and rebuilding the entire area. Thus, there is no less restrictive means \nto redevelop the area.  As explained by the former Mayor,  \n[M]any people over the years have tried many, many projects, many \nthings to address the problem in the Gardens.  Two of those problems \nhave  not  been  able  to  be  resolved.    One  is  the  large  volume  of \nabsentee landlord held units…. The last and the next problem is the \nspecific condition of some of the houses … One alternative might \nhave been to try to do it with the buildings that we have now.  To \nmove people out, to rebuild the buildings and to move them back in.  \nThat process had been tried. \n \n(JA0870-0871). \nThe evidence was also clear that past attempts to rehabilitate the Gardens \nwere unsuccessful.  (JA2495, JA2504-2505 & JA0934).  A former Mayor and \nCouncil person stated, \nFifteen years ago when I sat where you are sitting the Council applied \nfor and received millions of dollars in grants, in rental rehab monies, a \nlot of different programs to make the Gardens…Many of our residents \nand in the County were members of Mount Holly 2000 and devoted \nan enormous amount of time without pay to upgrade units on Saul \nPlace, South Martin. And it just seems that no matter what was done \nor what was invested, the stigma did not go away. \n36 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 45      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n \n(JA2536-2537).  \n \nThe  evidence  amply  shows  that  less  restrictive  means  had  been  tried \nunsuccessfully over the years and redevelopment was the Township’s last resort.  \n \n4. Appellants  Failed  to  Make  Credible  Allegations  of  Less \nRestrictive Means.  \n \nThe  Trial  Court  correctly  found  that  Appellants  failed  to  make  credible \nallegations of less restrictive means. Once a defendant introduces evidence that no \nless restrictive alternative course is available, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \nto demonstrate the existence of less restrictive means. Rizzo, supra, 564 F.2d at \n149, n.37. In granting Summary Judgment, the District Court stated that even if \nAppellants had proved its prima facie case under the FHA, “they have not rebutted \nthe Township’s legitimate interest in the redevelopment, and they have not shown \nhow an alternative course of action would have a lesser impact.” (JA0017).  \nThe  District  Court  correctly  found  that  Appellants  had  insufficient \nallegations  to  support  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Gardens  as  a  viable  means  of \nredevelopment.  In doing so, it noted that Plaintiffs’ rehabilitation plan “relies upon \ngovernmental subsidies and upon costs based on property conditions in 1989” and \ndid  not  take  into  consideration  extra  costs,  such  as  relocation  costs.  (JA0019-\n0020).  The  Court concluded  “[s]imply  because the properties  could have been \nrehabilitated does not mean that rehabilitation was the feasible option.” (JA0020). \n37 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 46      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nIn  short,  Appellants  failed  to  allege  sufficient  facts  that  would  show  their \nrehabilitation plan was viable. \n \na. Appellants’  Fact  Allegations  Show  that  Rehabilitation  is \nFinancially Unfeasible.  \n \n Appellants own allegations showed that financial feasibility was a crucial \nelement to successful redevelopment. The Township Mayor explained, “[t]he final \nanalysis for the success of any plan is whether it can be effectively implemented, \nwhether it can be accepted both at the local and at the State level, whether it can be \nfinanced and whether it can be built.” (App. 129).  Appellants’ allegations failed to \nestablish that rehabilitation was financially plausible. \nIn support of its rehabilitation plan, Plaintiffs relied on affidavits submitted \nby  their  expert,  Gray  Smith11.  His  affidavit,  however,  is  insufficient  to  defeat \nSummary Judgment. Affidavits in opposition to summary judgment must contain \nfacts, not opinions and conclusions.  Maldonado v. Ramirez, 757 F.2d 48, 51 (3d \nCir. 1985); see also Kirleis v.

Supp. \n120, 123 (D.N.J. 1958) (an affidavit can be disregarded if its contents “consist[] of \nconclusions drawn by the defendant and not affirmations of fact” and is “nothing \nmore than a self-serving declaration”). \n                                                 \n11  Gray Smith passed away on April 29, 2010. \n38 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 47      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nThis  is  equally  true  for  expert  affidavits.  As  explained in Advo,  Inc.  v. \nPhiladelphia Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1198 -1199 (3d Cir. 1995),  \n[E]xpert testimony without such a factual foundation cannot defeat a \nmotion  for  summary  judgment.  “When  an  expert  opinion  is  not \nsupported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or \nwhen  indisputable  record  facts  contradict  or  otherwise  render  the \nopinion  unreasonable,  it  cannot  support  a  jury's  verdict....  Expert \ntestimony is useful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not \na substitute for them.” \n \nRather, “[t]he factual predicate of the opinion of an expert must find some support \nin  the  record.”  Lynch  v.  J.P.  Stevens  &  Co.,  Inc.,  758  F.Supp.  976,  1006  -\n1007 (D.N.J.  1991).  “An  expert  opinion  which  contains  no  support  for  factual \nassertions should be rejected.” Id.  A court may disregard an expert affidavit which \nis “‘essentially conclusory’ and lacking in specific facts” or where the opinion \nassumes facts which are unsupported by the record. Shaw by Strain v. Strackhouse, \n920 F.2d 1135, 1144 & 1139 (3d Cir. 1990). \n  Moreover, “[a] trial court is not precluded from granting summary judgment \nmerely because expert testimony is admitted.  If, even given the proffered expert \ntestimony, the proponent ‘still has failed to present sufficient evidence to get to the \njury,’ summary judgment is appropriate.”  In re TMI Litig., 193 F.3d 613, 716 (3d \nCir. 1999) amended 199 F.3d 158 (3d Cir. 2000).  See also J & J Snack Foods \nCorp. v. Earthgrains Co., 220 F. Supp. 2d  358, 368 (D.N.J. 2002) (stating “a court \nmay grant summary judgment even where the opponent presents admissible expert \n39 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 48      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\ntestimony, if that testimony is insufficient to support a jury verdict in favor of the \nparty offering the evidence on a crucial element of the claim”). \n  In this case, the Trial Court correctly concluded that the record as a whole \ndemonstrates  that  there  was  no  violation  of  the  FHA  and  no  intentional \ndiscrimination by the Township.   \nMr. Smith’s Declaration contains numerous conclusory statements, without \nciting to any factual evidence to support them. For example, Mr. Smith states that \nbecause the units were “structurally sound” and due to high costs of demolition, \nrecycling,  disposal  and  replacement  of  housing  components,  “the  houses  were \neconomically feasible to rehabilitate.” (JA2373-2375, ¶15 & JA0396, ¶24). Mr. \nSmith’s  Declaration  is  filled  with  similar  unsupported  statements  as  to  the \neconomic  feasibility  of  rehabilitation.  (JA2382,  ¶25).  While  Appellants’  expert \nopines  that  rehabilitation  would  be  less  costly  than  new  construction  and  that \naffordable  housing  could  be  “easily  and  economically  retained  at  little  or  no \nexpense to the Township”, he fails to provide any facts or figures to support his \nopinion. (JA0400, ¶28-29). He cites to no facts to support any of his conclusions.  \nNowhere does he ever provide an estimate of the actual cost of rehabilitation. \nSmith’s opinions regarding the feasibility of rehabilitation is based in part on \nhis assumption that many of the units, especially the homeowner units, are well \nmaintained  or  have  “minor  cosmetic  issues”.  (JA0390,  ¶15  &  JA0406,  ¶32). \n40 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 49      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nHowever, of the four houses Mr. Smith cites to as examples of homes in “good \ncondition”, two of those homes (154 Levis Drive and 354 South Martin Avenue) \nwere  Mount  Holly  2000  homes,  wherein  $42,240  and $36,845  in  grant  funds, \nrespectively, were spent on renovating the properties in 1996. (JA0396-0399, ¶25 \n&  JA1382).  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  these  houses  were \nrepresentative of the other homes within the Gardens.   \nBy contrast, the Township provided photographic evidence demonstrating \nseveral  of  the  unoccupied  homes  had  more  than  “minor  cosmetic  issues.”  \n(JA1929-1934 & JA1766-1767). The President of Keating explained that due to \nthe extensiveness of the damage, gut rehabilitation of many of the units would be \nrequired.  (JA1413-1414,  ¶4-7).  The  Township  provided  evidence  that \nrehabilitation costs would be substantial, about $150,000 to $200,000 per unit. \n(JA1415-1416, ¶14-15 & JA1372-1373, ¶6-9 & JA1381 & JA1383-1384).  \nMoreover, Appellants’ expert admits that the units are not consistent with \ntoday’s design standards, which would result in increased rehabilitation costs.    \nThe units in the Gardens, while meeting health and safety standards, \nare small from a market standpoint; i.e., relative to what a middle-\nincome buyer paying a market price would seek with respect to a \ntownhouse.  While large units that would reflect market preferences \ncould be created by combining existing units, that would significantly \nincrease the cost and complexity of undertaking rehabilitation rather \nthan new construction.   \n \n(JA0671).    Thus,  the  facts  set  forth  indicate  substantial  unarticulated  costs \n41 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 50      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nassociated with rehabilitation without any identifiable funding source.  \nSmith opines that “[t]o overtly conclude that a Rehabilitation Plan is not \nfeasible without performing a feasibility study is unacceptable” and to conclude \nwholesale demolition and new construction “is less costly without a comparative \ncost analysis is also unacceptable.” (JA1508, ¶7). Yet despite the fact that he touts \n“[m]y  firm  has  conducted  feasibility  studies”  (JA1505-1506,  ¶1),  he  never \nundertook a feasibility analysis to support his claims that Appellants’ rehabilitation \nplan was feasible.  \nInstead of performing his own feasibility study, Smith cites to a 1989 report \nby Joseph Biber, who undertook a full analysis, including financial feasibility of \nrehabilitating the Gardens.  (JA2386, ¶29).  It identified several public funding \nsources, as well as resale income and concluded that in 1989 dollars that there \nwould still be a financial gap of $3,242,396.  (JA1211).  The report surmised that \nadditional public, governmental sources might be able to fill the gap, assuming \nthat those governmental sources would provide extra funding.  Id.  Moreover, it \nidentified a $793,149 and $288,639 gap needed to address a capital subsidy and \noperating  support  for  a  projected  100  lease-purchase  units,  for  which  no \naccompanying funding source was identified.  Id.  Finally, it identified another \n$1,749,058 as a funding gap for operating expenses for certain rental units and \nhoped that this gap could be addressed through the federal Section 8 program.   Id. \n42 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 51      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n  The problem with the Biber analysis is three-fold.  First, it relies, almost \nexclusively, on governmental subsidies to fund the program.  (JA1202-1211).  In \ntoday’s climate of program cuts, and with the State and Federal Government’s \nsignificant budget deficits which need to be filled, the availability of governmental \nfunding is tenuous at best, and is most likely going to be significantly reduced over \nthe upcoming years. Second, the rehabilitation cost figures in this report were done \nin 1989.  (JA1163).  Since that time, many of the units have experienced greater \ndeterioration,  thereby  increasing  rehabilitation  costs,  and  many  have  been \ndemolished, as documented by the Township.  (JA1413-1414, ¶¶4-7, & JA1923-\n1928 & JA2373, ¶¶13-14 & JA2379-2380, ¶¶19 & 20, JA2027, ¶177).   It also \ndoes not account for increased construction costs. \nThird, this report does not take into consideration the additional costs that \nwould necessarily need to be incurred to ensure proper rehabilitation. For example, \nthis  report  excludes  costs  to  rehab  owner-occupied  homes.  (JA1166-1167).  \nUtilizing  the  rehabilitation  figures  in  the  Report  (JA1172),  that  is  another \n$2,697,192  to  $2,860,164  that  needs  to  be  subsidized.    (JA1166)  (stating  108 \nowner-occupied units).  Finally, the Report does not take into consideration the \nrelocation costs for the displaced individuals.  Each of the 225 tenants displaced as \na result of the acquisition would need to receive the statutory $4,000 in relocation \nbenefits.  N.J.S.A. 20:4-6.  This is another $900,000 that needs to be subsidized.  In \n43 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 52      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\naddition, if homeowner rehabilitation occurs, it is likely that the homeowners will \nneed  to  relocate  during  the  rehabilitation,  depending  upon  the  severity  of  the \nrehabilitation needed (i.e. rehab to electrical or plumbing systems), adding another \n$1,620,000 to the cost.  (108 x $15,000).  N.J.S.A. 20:4-5.  This is a minimum of \n$5,217,192 in additional unaccounted for costs. \nIt  is  clear  that  Plaintiffs’  are  seeking  affirmative  relief  that  requires  the \nTownship  and/or  a  private  redeveloper  to  undertake  significant  financial \nobligations, without identifying viable funding sources.  (JA2385, ¶27).  However, \nthe court has made clear, “[c]ourts should be more reluctant to grant affirmative \nrelief:  ‘To  require  a  defendant  to  appropriate  money,  utilize  his  land  for  a \nparticular purpose, or take other affirmative steps toward integrated housing is a \nmassive judicial intrusion on private autonomy.’”  Hispanics United of DuPage \nCounty v. Village of Addison, Illinois, 988 F. Supp. 1130, 1163 (N.D.Ill 1997, \nquoting Arlington Heights, supra, 558 F.2d at 1293. \nAs to funding sources to cover the gap, Mr. Smith asserts that governmental \nfunding sources are available to offset the cost of rehabilitation, but fails to provide \nany figures as to the amount of funding which can be secured from these unnamed \nsources. (JA2385, ¶27 & JA0401-0403, ¶30).  Township evidence demonstrates \nthat the funding sources identified by Mr. Smith have either limited funds or are \nnot truly funding sources.  (JA1373-1376, ¶9). \n44 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 53      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nSmith  also  suggests  that  rehabilitation  could  have  been  feasible  if  the \nTownship  had  retained  an  affordable  housing  developer,  citing  to  numerous \nentities active in rehabilitating affordable housing in Burlington County. (JA1515-\n1516,  ¶20).  This  statement  assumes  that  an  affordable  housing  developer  is \ninterested in and willing to undertake this project. There are no facts or evidence to \nsupport this assumption.   \nSmith asserts that the “Township has never attempted to engage housing \ndevelopers in The Gardens redevelopment that have an interest in and capacity for \nhousing  rehabilitation.”  (JA2387,  ¶30).  However,  this  contradicts  another  of \nAppellants’  expert’s  statements,  namely,  that  Keating  and  Penrose,  the  named \nredevelopers, has undertaken affordable housing projects in the past.  (JA1517, \n¶20).    He  also  asserts  that  the  Township  “engaged,  by  a  non-competitive \nRedevelopment Agreement” Defendant Keating and Penrose Properties. (JA0389, \n¶10).  However,  such  allegations  are  contrary  to  the  proofs.  The  Township’s \nselection  of  the  Redeveloper  was  undertaken  pursuant  to  open  public  bidding \nthrough  a  Request  for  Proposals  (“RFP”).  (JA1101,  ¶23-25).    There  was  no \nallegation that any affordable housing developer submitted a viable proposal to the \nTownship in response to the RFP.  There was certainly no allegation that any of the \nentities cited in the Smith Declaration submitted a proposal to the Township or \notherwise showed any interest or ability to undertake a rehabilitation project in the \n45 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 54      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nGardens.  \nAppellants do not allege that the Township received, but rejected, a valid, \nworkable, realistic, financially feasible proposal to rehabilitate the Redevelopment \nArea in such a way that would both eliminate the blighting conditions and correct \nor  resolve  the  problems  historically  plaguing  the  Redevelopment  Area,  while \nhaving no impact on minorities.  \nThe bottom line is that there needs to be an enormous private investment in \norder  to  make  any  rehabilitation  redevelopment  of  then-existing  Gardens  units \nfinancially feasible.  Appellants allege no private entity, nor any non-profit group \nwho is willing and able to undertake the type of commitment necessary to ensure \nthat redevelopment of the Gardens actually and realistically occurs. \nb.  The Facts of Record Show that Rehabilitation is \n(cid:4)ot Less Discriminatory. \n \nAppellants allege that their rehabilitation plan is the only less discriminatory \noption  available.  Appellants’  expert  opined  that  “severe  disparate  impact  with \nrespect to Hispanic and African-American residents will hold … short of a plan \nthat replaces or rehabilitates the current units with other units that are affordable to \n‘very low income and extremely low income tenants and homeowners.’”  (JA0072, \n¶39).   \nHowever, Appellants’ rehabilitation plan is not less discriminatory than the \nTownship’s  proposed  redevelopment.  Under  rehabilitation,  Plaintiffs  seek  to \n46 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 55      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nperpetuate segregation by requiring the Township to maintain the heavily minority \npopulated low-income community.  (JA1990-1991, ¶¶P27 & 28).  Plaintiffs’ intent \nis to ensure that all of the former residents, and therefore the exact prior racial \ncomposition  of  75%  minority  vs.  25%  non-minority,  remain  in  the  area.  This \nCircuit has recognized the damaging effects of such action, stating an “[i]ncrease \nor maintenance of racial concentration is prima facie likely to lead to urban blight \nand is thus prima facie at variance with the national housing policy.” Shannon v. \nU.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev., 436 F.2d 809, 821 (3d Cir. 1970).  \n  The continuation of minority concentrated areas, particularly low-income \nareas, is discriminatory under the Title VIII. “According to floor debates in the \nSenate, which ultimately enacted the legislation that became the Fair Housing Act, \nthe underlying policy behind Title VIII is to encourage the dispersion of urban \nghettos and to create more integrated neighborhoods. See 114 Cong. Rec. 2985 \n(1968).”   S. Camden Citizens in Action, supra, 254 F. Supp. 2d at 500. See also \nSadler  v.  218  Housing  Corp.,  417  F.  Supp.  348,  358 (N.D.Ga.  1976)  (stating \n“[u]nder  the  fair  housing  provisions,  it  has  been  uniformly  held  that  it  is \nimpermissible for governmental agencies to confine and isolate low-income blacks \nto racially compacted and concentrated areas”). \n  To  date,  the  Township  has  been  providing  sufficient  compensation  and \nrelocation assistance to enable Gardens residents to purchase a replacement unit \n47 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 56      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nwithin Mount Holly or some other area of their choosing.  (JA1843-1874).  By \nusing both monetary and non-monetary relocation assistance, the Township has \nbeen able to provide sufficient compensation and relocation benefits to the over \n100 families who have relocated thus far, without a problem. In many cases, it was \nthe non-monetary relocation assistance provided by the Township that allowed the \nfamilies to be able to afford more expensive housing, without increasing their costs \nof living. (JA1850-1870, ¶¶12.d-g & 14.d-e & 18 & 26.b & 26.d-f & 27.e).  There \nis no evidence in the record that any family who has relocated has been dissatisfied \nwith, filed any complaint regarding their compensation and relocation assistance, \nor have been otherwise unable to live comfortably in their new homes.  Appellants \nalso presented no credible allegation to suggest that they would not be equally able \nto relocate with the Township’s help.   \n  Appellants continue to rely on a report prepared by the New Jersey Public \nAdvocate.  The Public Advocate’s Report suggests that the housing costs for those \nwho have relocated have increased.  (JA1705-1706 & JA1730).  However, those \nfigures  do  not  account  for  the  relocation  assistance  they  were  provided.  Just \nbecause a person’s rent may have increased after relocation, does not mean that \nthey cannot afford the rent increase. Relocated residents were given $7,500 in \nrelocation benefits if they were tenants. (JA2021, ¶148).  That is an additional \n$125 per month, if spread over five years, an extra $156.25 per month if spread \n48 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 57      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nover four years, an extra $208.33 per month if spread over three years, and an extra \n$312.50 per month if spread over two years.  Based on the average rental increase \nset forth in the Public Advocate’s report (JA1730), accepting that these figures are \ntrue, the average family who moved could afford to live in their new place, without \npaying any more rent, for approximately 2 1/3 years.  \nMore importantly, the rents in the two charts in the Public Advocate’s report \ndo not match up.  The Gardens Rents set forth in the second chart are significantly \nhigher. For example, although there are only four (4) properties over $900 in the  \nRent Change Chart (Chart 1) (JA1730), there are 29 properties over $900 in the \nTriad  Referrals  Chart  (“Chart  2”)  (JA1731).    Similarly,  there  are  eight  (8) \nproperties under $600 in Chart 1, but only two (2) properties under $600 in Chart \n2. As a result, the average rent in the Gardens based on the rents set forth in Chart \n2 is $864.43.  When that is compared with the average “new rent” set forth in \nChart 1 ($971.53), that is an average rental increase of only $107.10.  With $7,500 \ngiven in relocation benefits, the average Gardens resident can live in their new unit \nwithout any increased cost for 70 months, or over 5 ¾ years.  If the rents in Chart 1 \nand Chart 2 are combined and averaged, the average rent in the Gardens becomes \n$786.45. This means that with the $7,500 relocation benefits, the average resident \ncould live in a new place for over 40 months or 3 ½ years without any increased \ncost. \n49 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 58      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nThus, there is no credible allegation or evidence that Appellants will not \nreceive  sufficient  compensation  and  relocation  assistance  to  enable  Gardens \nresidents to purchase a comparable replacement unit. The District Court’s finding \nthat the Township has already employed the least restrictive means supports the \ngranting of Summary Judgment. \n  5.  Adoption of Appellants Standard for a Fair Housing Violation in \n    the Redevelopment Context Will Severely Limit Municipal \n    Redevelopment. \n \n  The practical impact of Appellants’ standard for a Fair Housing violation, is \nthat  disparate  impact  and  intent  to  discriminate  can  be  assumed  whenever  a \nmunicipality or other governmental entity wants to proceed with redevelopment \nand blight clearance.  The reality is in nearly every occasion, redevelopment of \nblighted  urban  areas  will  involve  an  area  which  is  predominately  low-income \nminority.    City  of  Memphis,  supra,  451  U.S.  at  128.    Plaintiffs  in  their  Brief \nacknowledged  that  redevelopment  impacts  minorities  more  often  than  non-\nminorities  (Appellants’ Brief, p. 40, n.9) \n  Moreover,  the  homes  in  blighted  redevelopment  areas  will  generally  be \naffordable  to  low-income  households.    These  rents  or  mortgage  payments  are \ncheap because they are severely deteriorated or located in a blighted area with a \nsignificantly depressed market value.  The New Jersey Courts have recognized that \n50 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 59      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nby its very definition, a blighted area is an area where the property values have \nfallen dramatically.  As explained in Gallenthin, supra, 924 A.2d at 457 - 458,  \n\"Certain sections of [the older cities in the State] have fallen in value, \nand have [become] what [are] known as “blighted” or “depressed” \nareas ... \n \nThese depressed areas go steadily downhill. The original occupants \nmove away, the rents fall, landlords lose income and they make up for \nit by taking in more families per house. It's impossible to keep the \nproperties in good condition, the houses deteriorate more and more, \nand  what  was  once  a  good  section  of  the  town  is  on  the  way  to \nbecoming a slum. \n \nNaturally,  this slump  in  value  is  not  confined  to  the original  area \naffected.  It  spreads  to  neighboring  blocks.  No  one  person  ...  can \ncounteract this spread, because no one can afford to sink money into a \nblighted area ... **458 because the improvement is so small that it \ncannot turn the tide of deterioration. \n \n  In New Jersey, to designate an area in need of redevelopment, the area as a \nwhole must meet one or more of the criteria set forth in N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-5.  The \nNew Jersey Supreme Court has said that the criteria in N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-5 must \nbe read as consistent with the definition of \"blight\" in order to avoid the statute \nbeing considered unconstitutional. Gallenthin, 924 A.2d at 460 - 461.  This means \nthat an area designated a redevelopment area must be an area \"with economic \ndeterioration\"  or  severely  deteriorated  properties,  and  such  stagnation  or \ndeterioration must have a \"decadent effect on surrounding property.\"  Id. at 460.  \nThus, any residential area designated as a redevelopment area will necessarily be \npredominated  by  properties  that  are  affordable  to  low  and  moderate  income \n51 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 60      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nhouseholds  because the properties  are  either  economically  deflated  or  severely \ndeteriorated.  \n  Disparate impact under the FHA cannot possibly mean that the only thing \nthat a plaintiff has to prove is that the redevelopment area is occupied by more \nminorities than non-minorities or even a greater percentage of minorities live in the \nredevelopment area than in other areas of the municipality. If this were the case, \nany time a municipality in New Jersey designates a residential area in need of \nredevelopment, the residents will be able to come to court, allege disparate impact, \nand according to Appellants, establish a prima facie case under the FHA. Even \nthough redevelopment will be considered a legitimate governmental interest, the \nmunicipality will then be required to set forth all of its possible redevelopment \noptions for the Courts to determine which is the least discriminatory.   \n  Essentially, the Courts will be sitting in place of the municipal governing \nbody  deciding  what  course  of  action  is  best  to  take  in  order  to  achieve \nredevelopment of the area.  Federal courts have recognized, \"[l]and use policy \ncustomarily has been considered a feature of local government and an area in \nwhich the tenets of federalism are particularly strong.\" Izzo v. Borough of River \nEdge, 843 F.2d 765, 769 (3d Cir. 1988).  \"'[I]t is not the Court's function to act as a \n‘super zoning board’ substituting its judgment for that of a democratically elected \nbody on debatable issues of land use policy.'”  Eastampton Center, supra, 155 F. \n52 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 61      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nSupp.  2d  at  120.    Nor  should  a  federal  court  act  as  a  \"super  redevelopment \nauthority.\"  This is especially true for a redevelopment designation that has been \nupheld by every level of the New Jersey State Courts.12  This is why the District \nCourt concluded that \"[u]nder plaintiffs’ logic, any action by the Township to do \nanything with regard to the Gardens would result in a disparate impact, simply \nbecause of the racial composition of the Gardens.”   (JA0016). \n  In  the  redevelopment  context,  where  any  redevelopment  activity  will \nnecessarily impact minorities more than non-minorities simply because minorities \npredominate the redevelopment area, something more must be shown in order to \nestablish a prima facie case under the FHA, such as that the action will have a \nsegregative effect, or that the minorities in the municipality or the county (not just \nthe redevelopment area) are disproportionately in need of affordable housing.  See \nEdwards, supra, 885 F.2d at 1223. \n  a.  Amicus United States Misstates Appellants Statistical \nAllegations. \n \n  Amicus United States argues that \"[b]ecause plaintiffs presented sufficient \nevidence  that  the  redevelopment  would  have  a  disproportionate  adverse  effect \nupon  minorities  in  Mount  Holly  Township,  as  well  as  Burlington  County,  the \ndistrict court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the ground that \n                                                 \n12   The Appellate Court and Supreme Court decisions in this matter were issued \nafter Gallenthin was decided. \n53 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 62      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nplaintiffs had failed to present a prima facie case of disparate impact under the \nFHA.\"  (Amicus Brief, p.10).  If Plaintiffs had submitted evidence to establish this \nfact,  amicus  would  be  correct.    However,  the  evidence  does  not  show  that \nminorities  within  Mount  Holly  or  Burlington  County  are  disproportionally \nadversely affected.  Rather, Plaintiffs' statistics only apply to the Gardens residents.  \n  Amicus claims that \"[i]n this case, plaintiffs’ expert opined that – at least by \nsome measures – African-American and Hispanic families are respectively 8 and \n11  times  more  likely  than  white  families  to  be  negatively  affected  by  the \nredevelopment.\"  (Amicus Brief, p.16).  However, a review of these statistics, \nrather than just a reading Appellants’ Brief, reveal that what Plaintiffs' expert is \nreally saying is that minorities in the Gardens are overrepresented by 8 and 11 \nmore times than white families.13  The reality is that when the figures are evaluated \nbased on county-wide statistics, the proportionate number of minorities verses non-\nminorities who need affordable housing is only a few percentage points different.14  \n \nThis does not rise to the level of a disparate impact. \n \n                                                 \n13   Beveridge arrived at these numbers by comparing the percentage of whites and \nHispanics and African American residents who live in the Township with those \nliving in the Gardens (JA0071, ¶35).  Since the Gardens is one of the most \nheavily concentrated minority populations in the Township, (JA1991, ¶28), the \nredevelopment will necessarily impact more of the Township’s minority \nresidents. \n14   There were no figures for the number of households in Mount Holly Township \nwho are low and moderate income households. \n54 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 63      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nB. The Township was Properly Granted Summary Judgment on \nAppellants’ Equal Protection Claims. \n \n  The  Township  was  properly  granted  Summary  Judgment  on  Appellants’ \nEqual Protection Claims because Appellants did not establish a prima facie case of \nan  Equal  Protection  violation.    The  Fourteenth  Amendment  of  the  U.S. \nConstitution provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. This is not a command \nthat all persons be treated alike, but, rather, a direction that all persons similarly-\nsituated be treated alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. \n432, 439 (1985) and Chambers ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. of Philadelphia \nBd. of Educ., 587 F.3d 176, 196 (3d Cir. 2009).   \n  To  succeed  on  a  denial  of  Equal  Protection  claim,  a  plaintiff  “must \ndemonstrate  that  they  received  different  treatment  from  that  received  by  other \nindividuals similarly situated.” Chambers, 587 F.3d at 196. The critical issue is \nwhether “persons similarly circumstanced” are being treated alike. Alexander v. \nWhitman, 114 F.3d 1392, 1406 (3d Cir. 1997). Whether people are “similarly \ncircumstanced” is a matter left to legislative discretion.  \nThe Equal Protection Clause does not require that things which are \ndifferent in fact be treated in law as though they are the same. “The \ninitial  discretion  to  determine  what  is  ‘different’  and  what  is  ‘the \nsame’  resides  in  the  legislatures  of  the  States.”  Accordingly,  “the \nFourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion \nin enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than \nothers.”  Therefore,  “a  statutory  classification  that  neither  proceeds \n55 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 64      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nalong  suspect  lines  nor  infringes  fundamental  constitutional  rights \nmust  be  upheld  against  equal  protection  challenge  if  there  is  any \nreasonably  conceivable  state  of  facts  that  could  provide  a  rational \nbasis for the classification.” \n \nAlexander, 114 F.3d at 1407 (internal citations omitted) \n \n  Here, the group of people who are similarly situated are the residents of the \nGardens.  This decision  was  made in  2002  when the  Township  Council of the \nTownship  of  Mount  Holly  directed  the  Planning  Board  to  undertake  an \ninvestigation of whether properties within the Gardens qualified as an area in need \nof redevelopment within the meaning of N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 et seq. (JA1996, \n¶55). In declaring the area in need of redevelopment, the Township determined that \nthe properties within the redevelopment area were different than the properties \nelsewhere in the Township because they were blighted. (JA0860). The validity of \nthis group as similarly situated was confirmed by the New Jersey Courts when they \nupheld the Township’s redevelopment designation. (JA1806, ¶¶100 & JA1810, \n¶120 & 121).  None of these facts are in dispute. \n  Once the group of similarly situated people is identified, the court must \ndetermine whether any of these people are being treated differently. Under both the \nFederal and New Jersey Constitutions, an Equal Protection violation does not exist \nabsent different treatment of similarly situated members of a class. See City of \nCleburne, supra, 473 U.S. at 439 and Chambers, surpa, 587 F.3d at 196 (Federal \nConstitution);  see  also  Felicioni  v.  Administrative  Office  of  Courts,  961  A.2d \n56 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 65      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n1207,  1216 (N.J.  Super.  Ct.,  A.D.  2008)  (New  Jersey  Constitutional  Equal \nProtection Claims) (“[a]n equal protection violation does not exist in the absence \nof disparate treatment of persons who are or ought to be considered to be members \nof the same class”) and Lewis v. Harris, 908 A.2d 196, 211-12 (N.J. Sup. Ct. \n2006). \nAs  indicated  above,  it  was  undisputed  that  everyone  within  the \nRedevelopment  Area  is  being  treated  alike  regardless  of  race.  The  2008 \nRedevelopment Plan “calls for acquisition and demolition of all existing homes in \nthe Gardens.”  (JA2009, ¶100) (emphasis added).  Appellants never alleged that \nany resident within the Redevelopment Area was treated differently from any other \nsimilarly situated person and present no facts that establish any differing treatment. \nAbsent such proof, there can be no Equal Protection violation under either the New \nJersey or Federal Constitutions.  \nC.  (cid:4)o Violation of Civil Rights Act. \n \n  The District Court properly granted Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs Civil \nRights Act Claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1982.  A §1982 claim required proof of \nthe following: “‘(1) the defendant's racial animus; (2) intentional discrimination; \nand (3) that the defendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of race.’” Brown \nv. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 797 (3d Cir. 2001).  As indicated above, there \nwas no evidence of intentional discrimination. Thus, the District Court’s decision \n57 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 66      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\ngranting Summary Judgment should be affirmed. \nIII.  APPELLA(cid:4)TS FAILED TO DEMO(cid:4)STRATE HOW ADDITIO(cid:4)AL \nDISCOVERY WOULD BE(cid:4)EFIT THEM. \n \n  Initially, the obvious must be stated.  Plaintiffs claim they need discovery in \npapers accompanied by a 7 volume, 2783 page Appendix.  Nearly 10 years of \nlitigation, public records requests, participation in public meetings with transcripts \nof each, access to all records and participation with an “investigation” by the State \nPublic Advocate, and hundreds of Certifications - and yet Plaintiffs contend with \none more piece of paper, they will sustain their allegations. \n  The District correctly concluded that lack of discovery does not prevent \nsummary  judgment,  especially  in  this  case,  where  the  procedural  history  and \nfactual circumstances are unique.  Plaintiffs have had more than ample opportunity \nto “discover” any relevant fact in issue, and either have in their possession, or \notherwise have access to the information alleged to be necessary by means other \nthan discovery. \nIn  deciding  whether  or  not  to  allow  additional  discovery  for  summary \njudgment purposes, the court’s decision “‘depends, in part, on ‘what particular \ninformation is sought; how if uncovered, it would preclude summary judgment; \nand why it has not previously been obtained.’”  Horvath v. Keystone Health Plan \nEast, Inc., 333 F.3d 450, 458 (3d Cir. 2003).  A court is free to deny the request for \nadditional discovery where “‘the information [sought] is otherwise available to the \n58 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 67      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nnon-movant.’”  In re Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co. Sales Practices Litigation, 70 \nF. Supp. 2d 466, 482 (D.N.J. 1999).  Similarly, “‘if the non-moving party has had \nan adequate opportunity to discover the information, then summary judgment may \nbe granted even if the information is solely in the possession of the moving party.’”  \nE.C. v. Antar, 120 F. Supp. 2d 431, 440 (D.N.J. 2000).  \nThe vast majority of the information claimed to be needed by Appellants has \nalready  been  obtained  through  other  means,  namely  numerous  Open  Public \nRecords Act requests.  Unlike a normal defendant in a lawsuit, the Township is a \npublic entity who is obligated to provide documents to the public, including the \nPlaintiff, upon request pursuant to the Open Public Records Act, N.J.S.A. 47:1A-1, \net seq. (“OPRA”).  Thus, information alleged to be needed regarding any official \naction by the Township were all available, and produced, to the Plaintiffs through \nOPRA.   \nSimilarly,  any  information  sought  regarding  the  relocation  activities  and \nrelocation benefits given to former residents is available through other means.  All \nsuch information is available directly from the former residents themselves and \nfrom the Office of the Public Advocate, who undertook an investigation of the \nTownship’s relocation practices. (JA1688-1731). \n  Finally, Plaintiffs had prior opportunity to depose and/or call as witnesses \nTownship  officials  and  employees  as  part  of  the  State  Court  litigation.  As \n59 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 68      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\nexplained in Judge Sweeney’s August 30, 2005 Opinion,  \nFirst, a public official’s state of mind is rarely an issue and can usually \nbe determined from the record below.  There are transcripts, tapes, \nminutes and the like…[T]here has already been one hearing in this \nmatter.  Although I limited plaintiffs to two expert witnesses, I also \nafforded them the right to call township officials to testify.  They \nelected, for whatever reason, not to do so. \n \n(JA1957) It is important to note that an issue contended by Plaintiffs before the \nState Trial Court was that the Township’s blight designation had a discriminatory \nintent.  Thus, it is clear that Plaintiffs have already had the opportunity, and chose \nnot to take advantage of it, to obtain information from Township employees and \nofficers regarding their intent.    \nFinally, with respect to the depositions of the Township officials alleged to \nbe  necessary,  decision-making  governmental  officials  have  Morgan  protection \n(“mental process privilege”) from depositions.  U.S. v. Sensient Colors, Inc., 649 \nF.Supp.2d  309,  318 (D.N.J.  2009).  This  is  because  “[a]bsent  extraordinary \ncircumstances,  good  cause  exists  to  preclude  the  deposition  of  a  high  level \ngovernmental official because there is a public policy interest in ensuring that high \nlevel government officials are permitted to perform their official tasks without \ndisruption  or  diversion.”    Buono  v.  City  of  Newark,  249  F.R.D.  469,  470, \nn.2 (D.N.J. 2008).   \n  As recognized by the District Court, even if Plaintiffs were able to depose \nany Township official, it is not likely that such a deposition would result in the \n60 \n\nCase: 11-1159     Document: 003110559421     Page: 69      Date Filed: 06/10/2011\n“smoking gun” Appellants seek as to discriminatory intent.  “‘Municipal officials \nacting in their official capacities seldom, if ever, announce on the record that they \nare pursuing a particular course of action because of their desire to discriminate \nagainst a racial minority.’” U.S. v. City of Birmingham, Mich., 727 F.2d 560, 564 \n(6th Cir. 1984).  Through 10 years of litigation, Appellants have not uncovered one \nscintilla of improper motive of any Township official.   \nTherefore, the District Court’s decision to grant summary judgment without \nallowing Appellants’ requested discovery was entirely consistent with Rule 56 and \ndoes not warrant reversal. \nCO(cid:4)CLUSIO(cid:4) \n \n  Appellants have failed to allege credible facts necessary to present their case \nto a fact finder.  The District Court’s decision granting Summary Judgment should \nbe upheld. \nMALEY & ASSOCIATES \n              A Professional Corporation \n \n \n \nDated: June 10, 2011                                    By: /s/ M.
