Plaintiff argued that the ten percent rate reduction violated Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (the Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq., and was therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause.

Box 997413, MS 0000 \nSacramento, CA 95899-7413 \nDear Mr. Douglas: \nI am responding to the pending request for reconsideration of the decision to disapprove the \nCalifornia State plan amendments (SPAs) 08-009A; 08-009Bl; 08-009B2; 08-009D, which \n. were submitted on September 30, 2008, and SPA 08-019, which was submitted on \nDecember 31,2008. The SPAs proposed to reduce the reimbursement rates for certain \nservices furnished under the approved State plan. \nOn November 18,2010, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \ndisapproved these amendments because the State did not provide sufficient information \nconcerning the impact of the proposed reimbursement reductions on beneficiary access to \nservices as required by section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act). \nSection 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act requires that care and services are available to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries at least to the extent that care and services are available to the general \npopulation in the geographic area. In addition, CMS was concerned that, given the time \nthat had elapsed since the above SPAs had been submitted, the cumulative effect of \napproval of and subsequent implementation of these reimbursement reductions would \n. exacerbate beneficiary access concerns. On November 19,2010, the State requested that \nCMS reconsider the disapproval of the above amendments. \nOn March 25,2011, the State submitted documentation to support a demonstration of \ncompliance with section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act, as it specifically relates to \nreimbursement rates that are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services \nare available at least to the extent that care and services are available to the general \npopulation in the geographic area. From March 25, 2011, through approximately \nSeptember 30,2011, CMS has been working with the State to refine the information \ninitially submitted and, as a result of this collaborative process, the State was able to \nprovide metrics that adequately demonstrated beneficiary access. In general, th~se metrics \nincluded data which provided: \n•  Total number of providers by type and geographic location and participating Medi-\nCal providers by type and geographic area \n•  Total number of Medi-Cal beneficiaries by eligibility type \n•  Utilization of services by eligibility type over time \n•  Analysis of benchmark service utilization where available· \n3 \n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 10    Filed 11/28/11   Page 5 of 21   Page ID #:52\nPage 2 - Toby Douglas \nData concerning these metrics were submitted for State Fiscal Years (SFYs) 2008, 2009 \nand 2010. \nBased on the analysis described above, the State has requested that CMS approve SPAs \n08-009A, 08-009Bl, 08-009D. As part of the reconsideration of the above SPAs, the State \nhas modified the SPAs to reflect that the reductions prior to 2011 will only be authorized \nunder the plan in those years, and for those periods, during which the State actually \nimpleme.nted the reduction.  This targeting addresses the issue we had raised earlier of \nretroactively implementing rate cuts which might potentially affect current access.  As. \nnoted in our original letter denying the 2008 SPAs, recoupment of retroactive reductions \nmight create access problems going forward.  The arpendments to the 2008 State plan \nlargely resolve this concern for periods prior to 2011. \nBecause the State implemented some reductions, CMS was able to study the correlation between \nthe reduction to the reimbursement of those services and the change in the above metrics from \nSFY 2008 - SFY 2010.  Based on this analysis,including a period of rate reductions, CMS was \nable to conclude that the implementation of the above reimbursement reductions complied with \nsection 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act so that care and services are available at least to the extent that \ncare and services are available to the general population in the geographic area. As modified, the \nSPAs also implement payment reductions for certain services in 2011.  The retroactive \nimplementation of rate cuts for a short time in 2011 is of far less concern than the retroactive \nimplementation of rate cuts for several years. Nevertheless, the State demonstrated beneficiary \naccess for SFY 2010, and also submitted a monitoring plan as part of SPA 08-009B 1 by which \nbeneficiary access will be monitored on a service-by-service basis for all the services at issue in \nthese three SPAs. We believe that the proposed monitoring process will allow California to \nensure that payment rates for 2011 are consistent with section 1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act or to \npromptly take corrective action if the rates prove to be insufficient. The State will monitor \npredetermined metrics on a quarterly or annual basis in order to ensure that beneficiary access is \ncomparable to services available to the general population in the geographic area. \nIn light of the data CMS reviewed, the monitoring plan, and our consideration of \nstakeholder input, we have determined that these amendments comply with section \n1902(a)(30)(A) of the Act and all other applicable requirements of the Act, therefore, SPAs \n08-009A; 08-009Bl; 08-009D have been approved, effective July 1,2008. This approval \ndoes not affect SPA 08-009B-2 and SPA 08-019. The State has chosen not to pursue the \nreductions proposed via SPA 08-009B-2, therefore, we understand that the State will . \nwithdraw its formal request for reconsideration of this amendment. With regard to SPA \n08-019, the State incorporated the reductions initially proposed via SPA 08-019 into the \nreductions proposed via SPA 08-009 A, therefore, we understand that the State will also \nwithdraw its formal request for reconsideration of SPA 08-019. The revised approved plan \npages and the HCF A-179 are enclosed. \n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 10    Filed 11/28/11   Page 6 of 21   Page ID #:53\nPage 3 - Toby Douglas \nIf you have any questions, please have your staff contact Dianne Heffron at \n(410) 786-3247. \nEnclosures \n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 10    Filed 11/28/11   Page 7 of 21   Page ID #:54\nfVltM foWKIJvhl, \nJ,• • _T  k.. _At_lSM_m•  _ Al._l.n.I_MIH  :I••E _ Jt... .. __ ••••~•.• •S•' _I .A_'1~1!,!

(a), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (c)- (e) of § 14105.19 Welf. & \n5  Inst. Code by the Legislature was without any consideration of quality and access as \nrequired by Sec. 30A,1 and was without any consideration ofwhat it costs NEMT \n6 \nproviders to perform the various services and procedures, as required by Sec. 30A;2 such \n7 \nthat the State's sole purpose, and the conclusive factor, in enacting the across-the-board \n8 \n10% reduction in reimbursement to providers in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program, \n9 \nincluding NEMT providers, was to reduce the budget deficit.  Accordingly, under the \n10  standard of Orthopaedic Hasp.,  103 F.3d 1491, at 1500 (1997); and Arkansas Medical \nSociety, Inc. v.

Code, \n12 \nand the policy and action of the Defendants to implement these statutes by reducing \n13 \npayments to providers in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program, including payments to \n14 \nNEMT providers, by ten percent (10%), was and is arbitrary and capricious, and contrary \n15  to and in violation of the quality and access provisions of Sec. 30A; so that hence, under \n16  the Supremacy Clause, the aforesaid subds.

Plaintiff CMTA, its NEMT members, and the patients of the NEMT \n10  members of Plaintiff CMTA, have no administrative remedy, nor any plain, speedy, or \nadequate remedy whatsoever or at all, except by this complaint in intervention for \n11 \ninjunctive relief. \n12 \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff CMTA prays for judgment and orders as shall \n13 \nhereinafter be specified: \n14 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n15  Against the Director, for declaratory \njudgment under 42 U.S.C. § 2201 \n16 \n28.  Plaintiff CMTA refers to and incorporates each of the allegations in the \n17  preceding Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n18  29.  Welf. & Inst. Code§ 14105.19(b)(1), enacted by AB 5, provided: \n\"(b) (1)  Except as otherwise provided by subdivision (c), payments shall be \n19 \nreduced by 10 percent for Medi-Cal fee-for-service benefits for dates of service \non and after July 1, 2008.\"; \n20 \n(herein, \"Subd.

Hence the Ten Percent Rate Reduction of AB 5 expressly applied to NEMT \n23 \n-9-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 11 of 24   Page ID #:11\nservices and NEMT providers. \n1 \n30.  However, the above-entitled Court did, on August 18, 2008, file an order \n2 \nentitled: \n3 \n\"Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petitioners' Motion for \n4  Preliminary Injunction,\" \n5  (Clerk's Document 121 in Case No. 2:08-cv-03315 in the above-entitled Court, (\"ILC')), \n6  which provided in relevant part: \n7  \"The Court hereby orders Defendant Director, her agents, servants, employees, \nattorneys, successors, and all those working in concert with her to refrain from \n8  enforcing Cal.

Subsequent to August 18, 2008, three minute orders were filed in the \n12  Clerk's Docket of this Case No. 2:08-cv-03315, namely: \n-A written order dated August 27, 2008; --being Clerk's Document 135 in ILC; \n13 \n-A written order dated August 28, 2008, --being Clerk's Document 134 in ILC; \n14 \n-A written order dated Sept. 5, 2008; --being Clerk's Document 162 in!LC; and, \n15 \n-A written order dated Sept. 15,2008,-- being Clerk's Document 175 in!LC. \n16  32.  Plaintiff CMTA hereinafter refers to the five orders mentioned in \n17  Paragraphs 30 and 31, collectively, as a single order, (herein, \"the Order in Question\"). \n3 3.  A controversy in respect to the Order in Question has arisen between \n18 \nPlaintiff CMTA and the Defendant Director, in that  Plaintiff CMTA claims that the \n19 \nOrder In Question, in substance and its totality, ordered the Director to refrain from \n20 \nenforcing Cal. Welf. & lnst. Code§ 14105.19(b)(l); but, the Director has failed at all \n21 \ntimes to so obey the aforesaid provision of the Order in Question, by deducting 10 % \n22  from payments to NEMT providers for NEMT services in the Medi-Cal FFS program, \nfor dates of service on or after August 18, 2008. \n23 \n-10-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 12 of 24   Page ID #:12\n34.  Further,  PlaintiffCMTA claims that by virtue of the duty of the Director \n1 \nnot to deduct anything from payments to NEMT for NEMT services furnished in the \n2 \nMedi-Cal FFS program on or after August 18, 2008, --which duty is set forth in the \n3 \nOrder in Question, -- that the Director has a present, existing, and continuing mandatory \n4 \nduty to pay over all the 10% deductions to all NEMT providers which the Director has \n5  made and will make in the future, to the respective NEMT providers from whose \npayments the aforesaid deductions were and are being made, -- all, without any demand \n6 \nbeing required by any NEMT provider to be entitled to receive such pay over. \n7 \n3 5.  In contrast, the Director claims that the Order in Question does not so \n8 \nprovide, and that she has a defense to, and a justification, for (1) not ceasing to make \n9 \nthese deductions and (2) not paying over the deducted amounts. \n10  36.  In tum, a further controversy exists between PlaintiffCMTA and the \n1 Director in respect to her claims set forth in the preceding Paragraphs, in that Plaintiff \n1 \nCMTA claims that under established U.S. Supreme Court decisions, that if a person \n12 \nsubject to an injunction has good and legal cause not to obey or to be excused from \n13 \ncomplying with the injunction, that it is incumbent on the person to apply to the court \n14 \nand obtain an order which amends or terminates the injunction, or excuses the \n15  noncompliance with the injunction; and for failure to so apply and obtain any \n16  exculpatory order, that the injunction continues in full force and effect as written, so as \nto cause the person subject to the injunction to continue to subject thereto; but, the \n17 \nDirector disputes this claim of Plaintiff CMTA  . \n18 \n37.  By the foregoing set forth in this Second Claim for Relief, an actual \n19 \ncontroversy exists between Plaintiff CMTA, suing on behalf of its constituent member \n20  NEMT providers, and the Defendant Director, such that a judgment and order should \nissue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and Rule 65, Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., which: \n21 \n-First, declares on the one hand, the rights ofNEMT providers, including the \n22 \nNEMT providers who are members of Plaintiff CMTA in respect to whom \n23 \n-11-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 13 of 24   Page ID #:13\nPlaintiff CMTA   is their virtual representative and their jus tertii \n1 \nrepresentative, and, \n2 \n3 \n-Second, declares on the other hand, the rights and duties of the Defendant \n4 \nDirector and her successors in office, in respect to this controversy, and, \n5 \n- Third, orders the Director to perform her mandatory duty under the Order in \n6 \nQuestion, -- namely, the mandatory duty to pay over all the 10% deductions to \n7 \nall NEMT providers which the Director has made and will make in the future, to \n8 \nthe respective NEMT providers from whose payments the aforesaid deductions \n9 \nwere and are being made; \n10  unless and until the Director applies to the Court and obtains some order from the Court \nwhich relieves her from any such further duty in this respect. \n11 \n38.  PlaintiffCMTA, its NEMT members, and the patients of the NEMT \n12 \nmembers of Plaintiff CMTA, have no administrative remedy, nor any plain, speedy, or \n13 \nadequate remedy whatsoever or at all, except by this complaint in intervention for \n14 \ninjunctive relief. \n15  WHEREFORE, Plaintiff CMTA prays for judgment and orders as shall \n16  hereinafter be specified: \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n17 \nAgainst the Director and Does 1 through 50. \n18 \n39.  PlaintiffCMTA refers to and incorporates each of the allegations in  the \n19 \npreceding Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n20  40.  At all times, from and after at least September 15, 2008 to the present and \n21  continuing, the Order in Question prohibited and commanded the Director to refrain \nfrom enforcing the Ten Percent Rate Reduction ofSubd. (b)(1) ofWelf. & Inst. Code \n22 \n§ 14105.19. \n23 \n-12-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 14 of 24   Page ID #:14\n41.  The Legislature on September 30, 20098, while the aforesaid Order in \n1 \nQuestion was still in force, did enact Sections 44 and 45 of AB 1183, (Cal. Stats. 2008-\n2 \n2009, Ch. 758), which provisions, as part of one single statute, reduced the Ten Percent \n3 \nRate Reduction for all Medi-Cal fee-for-service benefits which had been subject to the \n4  Ten Percent Rate Reduction under Subd. (b)(l) ofWelf. & Inst. Code§ 14105, (of AB \n5  5) to first, a five percent (5%) reduction in Medi-Cal fee-for-service payments to \npharmacies, (herein \"the Five Percent Rate Reduction\"), and second, reduced the Ten \n6 \nPercent Rate Reduction to a one percent (1 %) reduction in Medi-Cal fee-for-service \n7 \npayments to all other providers who had been subject to the aforesaid Ten Percent Rate \n8 \nReduction, including NEMT providers ofNEMT services in the Medi-Cal FFS program, \n9 \n(herein \"the One Percent Rate Reduction\"), for dates of service on or after March 1, \n10  2009. \n11  42.  Sec. 45 of AB 1183 enacted subd. (f) ofWelf. & Inst. Code \n§ 14105.191 to provide: \n12 \n\"(f) Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of \n13  Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the department may implement \nand administer this section by means of provider bulletins, or similar \n14 \ninstructions, without taking regulatory action.\" \n15 \nFurther, the policy and practice of the Director whenever Medi-Cal rate reductions are \n16  enacted by the Legislature, which contain a provision as in subd. (f) ofWelf. & Inst. \nCode§ 14105.191, next above which permits the Director to pass through a rate cut \n17 \nenacted by the Legislature without taking any regulatory action herself, by use of \n18 \nprovider bulletins to the providers affected, is to always so pass through the legislative \n19 \nMedi-Cal rate cut, without taking any regulatory action herself, by announcing the rate \n20 \ncut to providers in bulletins, Uust as the Director did in respect to legislative rate cuts in \n21  the Medi-Cal program in the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and 2007-2008 fiscal years, which \n22  contained the same above \"pass through\" authorization set forth in subd.

However, -- due to the fact that the existing injunction of the Order in \nQuestion still facially currently enjoins the Director: \n6 \n- in the first ordering clause of the Order in Question, to refrain from enforcing \n7 \nSubd. (b)(l) ofWelf. &Inst. Code§ 14105.19 (ofAB 5), \n8 \nit follows that the Director has been enjoined to refrain from deducting anything \n9 \nfrom  providers such as NEMT providers ofNEMT services in the Medi-Cal FFS \n10 \nprogram, without first applying to the Court and obtaining an order which terminates or \n11  modifies the Order in Question to so allow. \n12  45.  Therein by each and all of the facts alleged in this Third Claim for Relief, \nunless: \n13 \n- (1) a declaratory judgment and order is issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, \n14 \nadjudicating and declaring that the Director must first apply to the Court and \n15 \nshow by a preponderance of the evidence that the State has complied with the \n16  requirements of the federal Medicaid rate-setting statute, Sec. 30A, in enacting \n17  and implementing the One Percent Rate Reduction ofWelf. & Inst. Code \n§ 14105.191, and, \n18 \n19 \n- (2) an appropriate preliminary and permanent injunction is issued, \n20 \n21 \nthe Director will violate the existing Order in Question by implementing the One \n22  Percent Reduction to NEMT providers (which include NEMT providers who are \nmembers of Plaintiff CMTA), without first applying to the Court in the ILC case, \n23 \n-14-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 16 of 24   Page ID #:16\n(No. 2:08-cv-03315 in the above-entitled Court), and obtaining an order in the ILC case \n1 \nwhich terminates or modifies the August 18, 2008 preliminary injunction in the ILC \n2 \ncase, so as to permit the Director to implement AB 1183 in respect to dates ofNEMT \n3 \nservices on and after March 1, 2009. \n4  46.  PlaintiffCMTA, its NEMT members, and the patients of the NEMT \n5  members ofPlaintiffCMTA, have no administrative remedy, nor any plain, speedy, or \nadequate remedy whatsoever or at all, except by this complaint in intervention for \n6 \ninjunctive relief. \n7 \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff CMTA   prays for judgment and orders as shall \n8 \nhereinafter be specified: \n9 \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n10  Against each of the Defendants, for injunctive relief to enjoin the \nDefendants to refrain from implementmg a One Percent Rate \nReduction in respect to NEMT providers, -- which statute, and the State \n11 \naction of Defendants to implement the state statute, violate, and are \nhence preempted under the Supremacy Clause by, the quality and equal \n12  access clauses of 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n13  47.  Plaintiff CMTA refers to and incorporates each of the allegations in the \npreceding Paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n14 \nLEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF ASSEMBLY BILL 1183 \n15 \n48.  Assembly Bill (\"AB\") 1183, --a health trailer bill to implement the \n16 \nbudget cutting decisions  of the 2008-2009 Budget Bill, was enacted September 30, \n17 \n2008 and was chaptered as Chapter 758, Statutes 2008-2009. \n18  AB 1183 \n49.  AB 1183 was introduced Feb. 2, 2008 as a hazardous material bill. \n19 \nHowever, during the record budget stalemate which preceded enactment of the 2008-\n20 \n2009 budget bill in late September 2008, the budget bills which had passed by each \n21 \nhouse without 2/3 majority needed for enactment, were sent to the Big Four, namely, the \n22 \nmajority and minority leader of each house.  When they finally made their budget deal \n23 \n-15-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 17 of 24   Page ID #:17\nin late September 2008, the AB 1183 hazardous material bill was amended Sept. 15, \n1 \n2008 by the Assembly Committee on Budget, passed by both houses on September 16, \n2 \n2008, and signed by the Governor and filed with the Secretary of State on September \n3 \n30, 2008, as part of the process of the Governor signing the Budget Bill for 2008-2009. \n4 \n50.  By such legislative history, there were no committee hearings on AB \n5  1183.  The reasons why its provisions are what they are, are a secret known only to the \nBig Four leaders of the Legislature who drafted the provisions of AB 1183 in secret. \n6 \n51.  Further, there are hundreds of different health care subjects in AB 1183, \n7 \neach of which required separate consideration by the Legislature if any reasoned \n8 \ndecision was to be made by any legislator in the Senate or the Assembly in deciding to \n9 \nvote for or against particular provisions in the hundreds of different subjects contained \n10  in the bill.  AB 1183 was hence the pure product of pure logrolling, where, if any \nmember wished his or her health care provision in the multi-provisioned AB 1183 to be \n11 \nenacted, that legislator had to accept blindly all the other provisions relating to the \n12 \nhundreds of other subjects in the same bill. \n13 \n52.  It is a fact, and it is manifest from all the facts alleged in this Fourth \n14 \nClaim for Relief, that individual legislators who voted on AB 1183, and the Legislature \n15  as a whole, could not and did not appropriately consider whether or not the reduced \nrates of the Five Percent Rate Reduction for pharmacy services, and the reduced rates of \n16 \nthe One Percent Rate Reduction, were consistent with quality of services, or consistent \n17 \nwith equal access of beneficiaries to quality services, in the Medi-Cal FFS program. \n18 \n53.  Hence, facially, the action of the Legislature in enacting, and the action of \n19 \nthe Director to implement, the One Percent Rate Reduction provisions of AB 1183 were \n20  and are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, (namely, contrary to the quality and \n21  equal clauses of Sec. 30A; so that the provisions of(new) Welf. & Inst. Code \n§ 14105.191, subds. (a) and (b) which enacted the One Percent Rate Reduction in \n22 \nrespect to NEMT services, effective March 1, 2009, violated and hence are preempted, \n23 \n-16-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 18 of 24   Page ID #:18\nunder the Supremacy Clause, by Sec. 30A. \n1 \n54.  Further, unless restrained by the Court by an appropriate injunction, the \n2 \ndefendant Director will implement the aforesaid One Percent Rate Reduction in respect \n3 \nto  NEMT services providers (including members of the Plaintiff CMTA); which in \n4  tum will thereby result in injury to the Plaintiff CMTA; to its members who are nemt \n5  providers; and to patients ofNEMT services providers (including patients of members \nof the Plaintiff CMTA); --which injury will foreseeably result in NEMT providers \n6 \n(including members of Plaintiff CMTA) not accepting new Medi-Cal patients, or \n7 \nstopping serving Medi-Cal patients at all, or by reducing kinds, amounts, locations, and \n8 \nlevels of services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries, or by going out of business, so that thereby \n9  beneficiaries are and will be caused, and threatened to be caused, denial and reduction \n10  of access to life-vital NEMT services and treatment in the Medi-Cal FFS program, \nresulting in great physical suffering and injury to beneficiaries, including beneficiaries \n11 \nserved by the members of Plaintiff CMTA, many of whom will thereby be forced into \n12 \ninstitutions such as nursing homes to obtain their necessary medical treatment and \n13 \nmedicines, especially to receive dialysis treatments; and some will die; all to the \n14 \nirreparable injury, and threat of irreparable injury, to thousands ofMedi-Cal \n15  beneficiaries including the beneficiaries served by the members ofPlaintiffCMTA. \n55.  PlaintiffCMTA and the members ofPlaintiffCMTA, have no \n16 \nadministrative remedy, nor any plain, speedy, or adequate remedy whatsoever or at all, \n17 \nexcept by this complaint in intervention for injunctive relief. \n18 \nWHEREFORE,  Plaintiff CMTA prays for judgment and orders as shall \n19 \nhereinafter be specified: \n20  II \nII \n21 \nII \n22 \nII \n23 \n-17-\n\nCase 2:08-cv-07046-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 10/24/08   Page 19 of 24   Page ID #:19\nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n1 \nAgainst each of the Defendants, for injunctive relief to enjoin the \n2 \nDefendants to refrain from implementing a One Percent Rate \nReduction under Sec. 45 of AB 1183 in payments to NEMT \n3 \nproviders, --which statute, and the State action of Defendants to \nimplement the state statute, violate, and are hence preempted under the \n4 \nSupremacy Clause by, the quality and equal access clauses of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396a(a)(30)(A). \n5 \n56.  Plaintiff CMTA refers to and incorporates each of the allegations in  the \n6 \npreceding Paragraphs of this Petition as if fully set forth herein. \n7 \n57.  However, the enactment of the One Percent Rate Reduction in respect to \n8 \nNEMT services and providers in the Medi-Cal FFS program, by subds. (a)- (b)(l) and \n9 \n(e)- (h) of new Welf. & Inst. Code§ 14105.191, by Sec. 45 of AB 1183, by the \n10 \nLegislature was without any consideration of quality and access as required by Sec. \n11  30A,3 and was without any consideration of what it costs providers to perform the \n12  various services and procedures, as required by Sec. 30A;4 such that the State's sole \npurpose, and the conclusive factor, in enacting the across-the-board 10% reduction in \n13 \nreimbursement to providers in the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program, including NEMT \n14 \nproviders, was to reduce the budget deficit. \n15 \n58.  Accordingly, under the standard of Orthopaedic Hosp.,  103 F.3d 1491, at \n16 \n1500 (1997); and Arkansas Medical Society, Inc. v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519 (8th Cir. \n17 \n1983), the action of the Legislature to enact the aforesaid subds. (a)- (b)(l) and \n18 \n(e)- (h) of §14105.191 Welf. & Inst.

Accordingly, by each and all of the foregoing facts alleged, subds. \n6 \n(a)- (b)(l) and (e)- (h) of§ 14105.191 Welf. & Inst. Code, and the One Percent Rate \n7  Reduction and the Five Percent Rate Reduction, in respect to NEMT providers, were \n8  and are contrary to and in violation of the quality and access provisions of Sec. 30A, so \nas to be preempted. under the Supremacy Clause. by the quality and access provisions \n9 \nof Sec. 30A, such that the Defendant Director is and will be acting in excess of and \n10 \nwithout jurisdiction to implement subds.
