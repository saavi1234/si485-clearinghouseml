We consider the Urgent Motion for Clarification Pursuant to Circuit Rules 27-3(b) and 27-10 filed by Plaintiffs-Appellants California Pharmacists Association, et al. (the Hospital Plaintiffs). The Hospital Plaintiffs filed the instant motion more than fourteen days after the date of our April 6, 2009 Order, in violation of Circuit Rule 27-10(a). Nevertheless, we find that the Hospital Plaintiffs were not, and could not have been, aware of the matter in which the Director would implement our Order until after the fourteen-day period had passed. Under the circumstances, and pursuant to Circuit Rule 27-10 (a), we enlarge the said fourteen-day period, and consider the motion. We resolve the Hospital Plaintiffs' motion and clarify our April 6, 2009 Order as follows: Those sections, or portions of sections, of the California Welfare and Institutions Code added or amended by Assembly Bill 5 that were not purportedly amended or deleted by the text of California Assembly Bill 1183 are not covered by, nor is the implementation thereof stayed by, our April 6, 2009 Order.

    "summary": "<p>In 2008 and 2009, the California Legislature passed three statutes modifying the State's Medicaid plan. Under the Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396 et seq., such modifications must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&ldquo;CMS&rdquo;) prior to being implemented. In September and December 2008, California submitted amendment proposals to CMS that incorporated most of the rate reductions the Legislature had already included in these statutes. Before CMS had completed its review of the amendments, this suit and several others seeking injunctions to prevent the rate reductions were filed.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs in this case were a group of several associations of California medical professionals, pharmacies, and hospitals. On January 29, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Central District of California against the Director of the Department of Health Care Services of the State of California. Private counsel represented the plaintiffs in this action and the Attorney General of California represented the defendant. The group of plaintiffs sought an injunction to invalidate the cutbacks to California's Medicaid program (\"Medi-Cal\") mandated by the State Legislature.</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2008, Governor Schwarzenegger had signed into law AB 1183, which included a five percent rate reduction for payments to certain intermediate care facilities under the Medi-Cal fee-for-service program, a five percent rate reduction to payments to pharmacies and adult day health care, and a one percent rate reduction for all other Medi-Cal fee-for-service benefits. This amended an earlier law, which had a higher, 10 percent rate reduction and had been struck down by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in <a href=\"../../../../case/11829/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Shewry</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs in the instant case alleged that AB 1183 violated Title XIX, because they had not been approved by CMS and because the State had failed to study the potential effects of the rate reductions on the quality of and level of access to care available to Medi-Cal recipients. Plaintiffs argued that California had not shown that, were the rate reductions to go into effect, the State would be able to enlist enough providers as to make Medi-Cal services sufficiently available to benefit recipients, as required by 42 U. S. C. &sect;1396a(a)(30)(A). The plaintiffs alleged that because these rate reductions violated federal Medicaid law they were therefore preempted by the Supremacy Clause. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to find that AB 1183 was in violation of federal law and to prevent its enforcement.</p>\r\n<p>On February 11, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of rate reductions for pharmacies and adult day health care centers. A second motion for preliminary injunction followed on February 13, 2009 regarding the rate reductions for hospital services. On March 9, 2009, Judge Christina Snyder issued orders on these motions for preliminary injunction granting the motion as to adult health care centers and denying the motion as to hospitals. For the motion relating to hospitals, Judge Snyder found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits but had not shown a likelihood of irreparable harm. <u>Cal. Pharmacists Assoc. v. Maxwell-Jolly</u>, 630 F.Supp.2d 1144 (C.D. Cal. 2009). The defendants and plaintiffs then appealed the orders granting preliminary injunction and denying preliminary injunction, respectively, to the Ninth Circuit. On April 6, 2009, the Ninth Circuit found that the district court had abused its discretion in not granting the preliminary injunction as to hospitals and granted the plaintiff's motion for stay pending appeal. On March 3, 2010, the Ninth Circuit found that in implementing the rate reductions the State had not relied on responsible costs studies or studied the impact of the contemplated rate changes prior to setting the rates, and was therefore in violation of 42 U. S. C. &sect;1396a(a)(30)(A). The Ninth Circuit, therefore, affirmed the district court's order granting the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. <u>Cal. Pharmacists Assoc. v. Maxwell-Jolly</u>, 563 F.3d 847 (9th Cir. 2009). In light of this, on April 16, 2010, Judge Snyder issued an order vacating her March 9, 2009 order and granting the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction with regard to hospitals.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2010, the defendants petitioned the United States Supreme Court to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit holding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution could serve as a basis for a cause of action in this case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari review on January 18, 2011, consolidating this case with four others that raised the same issue, 131 S.Ct. 992 (2011). These four cases were <a href=\"../../../../case/11829/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc. v. Shewry</a>, <a href=\"../../../../case/11871/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Managed Pharmacy Care v. Maxwell-Jolly</a>,<a href=\"../../../../case/11431/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Dominguez v. Schwarzenegger</a>, and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Shewry (Docket #: 3:08-cv-05173-SC). On June 1, 2011, Judge Snyder issued an order removing this action from the list of active District Court cases pending the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>\r\n<p>Oral argument before the Supreme Court took place on October 3, 2011. After oral argument, while the cases were pending in the Supreme Court, CMS approved California's amendments to its Medicaid plan. In light of this change, the Supreme Court declined to issue a ruling on whether the Supremacy Clause could serve as a basis for a private suit to enforce Title XIX against a state. Instead, on February 22, 2012, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit Court's decision and remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration, with instructions to take into account CMS's approval of the amendments. <u>Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California</u>, 132 S. Ct. 1204 (U.S. 2012).</p>\r\n<p>Back in the Ninth Circuit, on May 22, 2012, the plaintiffs, joined by parties in other Ninth Circuit cases, filed a unanimous joint motion to refer parties to mediation. That motion was granted on the same day, and parties began mediation on May 25, 2012.</p>\r\n<p>On September 16, 2013, the caption of the case was changed to reflect that Toby Douglas was the Director of the Department of Health Care Services, and David Maxwell-Jolly&rsquo;s name was omitted.</p>\r\n<p>After a span of two years of mediation, the parties negotiated a settlement. On May 27, 2014 the plaintiffs, joined by parties in other Ninth Circuit cases, filed a joint motion to dismiss each of the cases voluntarily, with each side bearing its own costs and fees on appeal. The motion was granted and the appeals dismissed on May 28, 2014.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement itself was executed in April 2014, and was submitted to the district court for approval on August 19, 2014. Judge Snyder granted the motion, approving the settlement agreement on September 22, 2014, and dismissed the case with prejudice on April 23, 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Under the settlement agreement, the Department of Health Care Services and its Director (collectively, &ldquo;the Department&rdquo;) agreed to forgo recoupment claims against Medi-Cal providers arising out of the preliminary injunctions in these cases, except with respect to Medi-Cal providers who are not represented here and choose to opt out of the settlement agreement, the plaintiff hospitals in Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Maxwell-Jolly (Docket No. 08-CV-5173-SC), Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Douglas (Docket No. CPF-09-509658), and North Bay Healthcare Group v. Douglas (Docket No. CGC-11-512059), and any providers who institute a new suit or fail to dismiss a pending suit or administrative action under AB 5 or AB 1183 rate reductions.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs agreed to release state and federal entities from liability relating to the rate reductions, excluding claims about the Department&rsquo;s accuracy in calculating reimbursement. The Department released the plaintiffs from liability relating to any payments not made while the rate reductions were enjoined, but where federal approval from CMS was ultimately obtained or where the Department withdrew its requests for approval regarding proposed amendments from CMS. The district court retained jurisdiction over the enforcement of this order until January 1, 2016.</p>",

The plaintiffs alleged that because these rate reductions violated federal Medicaid law they were preempted by the Supremacy Clause.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief.

Kim, Office of the Attorney General, Los\nAngeles, CA, Shannon Michelle Chambers, Office of the California Attorney General, Sacramento, CA, for\nDefendant-Appellee.\nBefore: STEPHEN REINHARDT, MARSHA S. BERZON, and MILAN D. SMITH, JR., Circuit Judges.\nORDER\nPlaintiffs-Appellants, the California Pharmacists Association, et al., filed this suit to challenge the Medi-Cal\nreimbursement rate reductions to various providers as set forth in AB 1183. A group of the plaintiffs, the Hospital\nPlaintiffs, which comprises the California Hospital Association and some individual hospitals, filed a motion in the\ndistrict court for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the defendant from reducing Medi-Cal fee-for-service rates to\n[1]\nhospitals,  arguing that AB 1183 was enacted in violation of ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A) of Title XIX of the Social Security\nAct, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396 et seq. ((a)(30)(A)). The district court denied the preliminary injunction. The Hospital\nPlaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion Pursuant to Circuit Rule 27-3 for Preliminary Injunction Pending Appeal.\nWe review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion. Earth Island Inst. v. U.S. Forest Serv., 442\nF.3d 1147, 1156 (9th Cir.2006). A district court abuses its discretion in denying a request for a preliminary\ninjunction if it \"base[s] its decision on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact.\" Id.\n(citation omitted). It also does so if in reaching its decision it makes a material error of law. We review\nconclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error. Id.\nPlaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction in a case in which the public interest is involved must establish that they\nare likely to succeed on the merits, that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v.\nNatural Res. Def. Council, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 365, 376, 172 L.Ed.2d 249 (2008). When deciding\n850 whether to issue a stay, including *850 a stay of a state action that the district court has declined to enjoin, we\nconsider: (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2)\nwhether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially\ninjure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. See Humane Soc'y of\nU.S. v. Gutierrez, 527 F.3d 788, 789-90 (9th Cir.2008).\n\nIn this case, the district court found that the Hospital Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, but that they\nfailed to demonstrate irreparable harm. We address these issues in turn, and, in view of the time-urgency and the\nirreparability of the harm, also consider the other Winter factors which necessarily follow.\nI. Likelihood of Success on the Merits\nIn Orthopaedic Hospital v. Belshe, 103 F.3d 1491 (9th Cir.1997), we held that 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A)\nrequires the state to consider efficiency, economy, quality of care, and access before setting Medi-Cal\nreimbursement rates. Id. at 1496. The district court concluded that the Hospital Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood\nof success on the merits under Orthopaedic because the Legislature did not consider any such factors before\npassing the rate cuts in AB 1183. The court ruled that although the Department of Health Care Services (the\nDepartment) had performed some studies after AB 1183's passage, those post-hoc studies failed to meet the\nrequirements of Orthopaedic, 103 F.3d at 1496. It noted that AB 1183 gives the Department no discretion to alter\nthe rate cuts based on the Department's own analysis, and, therefore, the cuts were not \"based on\" the\nDepartment's consideration of the relevant factors, but instead constituted a post-hoc rationalization for a\nlegislative decision that had already been made. Cal. Pharmacists Ass'n v. Jolly, No. 09-722, slip op. at 9-11\n(C.D.Cal. Mar. 9, 2009). Moreover, the district court determined that, although the state Legislative Analyst Office\nissued a report analyzing the proposed cuts, there was no evidence the legislature actually considered the report\nbefore enacting AB 1183. Id. at 10 n. 8.\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Hospital Plaintiffs\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. Indeed, the Hospital Plaintiffs made a strong showing of such\nlikelihood.\nII. Irreparable Harm\nThe Hospital Plaintiffs must also show a likelihood of irreparable harm. See Winter, 129 S.Ct. at 375.\nA. Harm\nWe first address the type of harm we may consider in the irreparable harm analysis. The Department argues that\nonly harm to Medi-Cal beneficiaries is relevant to this motion, while the Hospital Plaintiffs assert that harm to\nMedi-Cal service providers is also relevant, and that they need show only the latter type of harm, in this case\nharm to themselves or their members, in order to obtain injunctive relief. The Hospital Plaintiffs further claim that\nthey or their members will lose considerable revenue between the effective date of AB 1183 and the date their\nclaims can be reviewed on the merits if injunctive relief is denied.\nWe agree with the Hospital Plaintiffs. In Independent Living Center v. Shewry (ILC), we held that \"a plaintiff\nseeking injunctive relief under the Supremacy Clause on the basis of federal preemption need not assert a\nfederally created `right,' in the sense that term has recently been used in suits brought under ยง 1983, but need\n851 only satisfy traditional standing requirements.\" 543 F.3d 1050, 1058 (9th *851 Cir.2008). We rejected the\ncontention that federal statutes enacted pursuant to Congress's spending power, such as the one here at issue,\nare excluded from this principle, id. at 1059-62, and concluded that the health care providers in that case (which\nat that point did not include hospitals) had standing because:\n[A]ccording to their complaint, [they] will be \"directly injured, by loss of gross income,\" when the\nten-percent rate reduction takes effect. The Supreme Court \"repeatedly has recognized that such\n[direct economic] injuries establish the threshold requirements\" of Article III standing.... Moreover,\nthis injury is directly traceable to the Director's implementation of AB 5 [the statute at issue in that\ncase], and would certainly be redressed by a favorable decision of this court enjoining the ten-\npercent rate reduction.\n\nId. at 1065. Notably, ILC did not indicate that the service providers had standing to assert the interests of the\nbeneficiary plaintiffs as third parties, as, for example, the medical service providers do in cases concerning the\nconstitutional rights of patients. See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349\n(1972). A cause of action based on the Supremacy Clause obviates the need for reliance on third-party rights\nbecause the cause of action is one to enforce the proper constitutional structural relationship between the state\nand federal governments and therefore is not rights-based. In contrast, a case brought to enforce the Due\nProcess or Equal Protection Clauses is rights based, and requires that the rights of someone be advanced, even\nif not the rights of the plaintiffs who have been injured.\nConsistent with this understanding, in the various precedents cited throughout the ILC opinion in which plaintiffs\nbrought cases directly under the Supremacy Clause, the interests asserted were basically economic, and there\nwas no inquiry into whether the plaintiffs asserting the economic injury were in any sense intended beneficiaries\nof the federal statute on which the Supremacy Clause cause of action was premised. For example, in Bud Antle,\nInc. v. Barbosa, one of the cases upon which we relied in ILC, we held that employers could sue to enjoin a\nCalifornia statute as preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) \"regardless of whether the NLRA\nconferred a federal `right' on employers.\" 45 F.3d 1261, 1271 n. 13 (9th Cir.1994). It was for that very reason that\nwe concluded the ยง 1983 cases were inapposite, and that Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051 (9th Cir.2005), did\nnot preclude the plaintiffs' suit. Essentially, the line of cases on which we relied held that private parties could\nenforce the structural relationship between the federal and state governments so long as they had Article III\nstanding as, essentially, private enforcers of the Supremacy Clause; the specific relationship of those parties to\nthe federal statute on which the Supremacy Clause cause of action is premised does not matter.\nGiven these underpinnings of ILC, there is little basis on which to import an \"intended beneficiary\" concept back\ninto the case for purposes of determining irreparable injury. Applying this determination to the present motion, it is\nclear that AB 1183 harms the Hospital Plaintiffs and their members through reductions in Medi-Cal revenue\npayments.\nB. Irreparability of Harm\nHaving determined that the Hospital Plaintiffs have shown unlawful harm under (a)(30)(A), we next consider\nwhether the harm is irreparable. Typically, monetary harm does not constitute irreparable harm. L.A. Mem'l\nColiseum Comm'n v. Nat'l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1202 (9th Cir.1980). The Hospital Plaintiffs argue that\n852 in this case, however, the monetary *852 injury is irreparable because the Eleventh Amendment sovereign\nimmunity of the Department (a branch of the State of California government) bars the Hospital Plaintiffs from ever\nrecovering damages in federal court. The most relevant authority on this issue00though not controlling00supports\n97 97\nthe Hospital Plaintiffs' argument. See Kan. Health Care Ass'n v. Kan. Dep't of Soc. & Rehab. Servs., 31 F.3d\n1536, 1543 (10th Cir.1994) (\"Because the Eleventh Amendment bars a legal remedy in damages ... the court\nheld that plaintiffs' injury was irreparable. We agree.\"). We note also that Supreme Court case law and some of\nour own cases clarify that economic damages are not traditionally considered irreparable because the injury can\nlater be remedied by a damage award. See Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90, 94 S.Ct. 937, 39 L.Ed.2d 166\n(1974) (\"[I]t seems clear that the temporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually constitute\nirreparable injury.... The possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a\nlater date, in the ordinary course of litigation, weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.\" (internal\nquotation omitted)); Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. Canyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th\nCir.1991)(\"It is true that economic injury alone does not support a finding of irreparable harm, because such injury\ncan be remedied by a damage award.\" (emphasis added)); Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d\n668, 676 (9th Cir. 1988); Arcamuzi v. Cont'l Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 938 (9th Cir.1987); Colo. River Indian\nTribes v. Town of Parker, 776 F.2d 846, 850-51 (9th Cir.1985); Goldie's Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, 739\nF.2d 466, 471 (9th Cir.1984) (\"Mere financial injury ... will not constitute irreparable harm if adequate\ncompensatory relief will be available in the course of litigation.\" (emphasis added)).\n\nBecause the economic injury doctrine rests only on ordinary equity principles precluding injunctive relief where a\nremedy at law is adequate, it does not apply where, as here, the Hospital Plaintiffs can obtain no remedy in\n[2]\ndamages against the state because of the Eleventh Amendment. See Kan. Health Care Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 1543.\nConsidering the relevant authorities, we are persuaded that because the Hospital Plaintiffs and their members\nwill be unable to recover damages against the Department even if they are successful on the merits of their case,\nthey will suffer irreparable harm if the requested injunction is not granted.\nIII. Equities and the Public Interest\nThe district court did not reach the question of the equities and the public interest. Although the state argues that\nthese factors weigh in its favor because an injunction will worsen the state's budget crisis, the record reflects that\nthe impact of a stay on the budget crisis will be minimal at most. Further, it is clear that it would not be equitable\n853 or in the public's interest to allow the state to continue to *853 violate the requirements of federal law, especially\nwhen there are no adequate remedies available to compensate the Hospital Plaintiffs for the irreparable harm\nthat would be caused by the continuing violation. In such circumstances, the interest of preserving the\nSupremacy Clause is paramount. See Am. Trucking Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles, 559 F.3d 1046, 1059-60 (9th\nCir.2009) (considering the public interest represented by \"the Constitution's declaration that federal law is to be\nsupreme\").\nIn light of the showing made by the Hospital Plaintiffs in this case, we grant their motion for an order staying the\nrate cuts in AB 1183 with respect to the specified hospital services pending their appeal to this court of the district\ncourt's order denying the motion for preliminary injunction.\nMOTION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL IS GRANTED.\n[1] Specifically, the Hospital Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the rate reductions as to four types of services: (1) inpatient\nservices for non-contract hospitals, (2) outpatient services, (3) Distinct Part Nursing Facilities, and (4) subacute\nservices.\n[2] We observe that, although damages may become available to the Hospital Plaintiffs in state court, persuasive\nauthority suggests that federal courts may consider only what federal remedies are available. See United States\nv. New York, 708 F.2d 92, 93-94 (2d Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (holding that \"federal courts may consider only the\navailable federal legal remedies\"). But see Kan. Health Care Ass'n, 31 F.3d at 1543 (\"Because the Eleventh\nAmendment bars a legal remedy in damages, and the court concluded no adequate state administrative remedy\nexisted, the court held that plaintiffs' injury was irreparable. We agree.\" (emphasis added)). We find the reasoning\nof New York to be more persuasive, and consider only prospective federal remedies for the purpose of gauging\nwhether the harm caused to the Hospital Plaintiffs and their members is irreparable.\nSave trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.",

The exodus of providers from the program is leaving massive \n2 numbers of Californians without access to critical services or is forcing them to \n3 obtain care in the already over-crowded and increasingly scarce emergency \n4 departments of hospitals throughout the state.  Despite this disturbing state of \n5 affairs and an injunction prohibiting the reduction of Medi-Cal rates for certain \n6 providers, California has decided to reduce Medi-Cal rates again, without regard to \n7 the impact of these reductions.    \n8 4.  The deterioration of the California safety net is perhaps most evident in \n9 Los Angeles County, where, in some areas, the healthcare system is now in crisis.  \n10 Emergency room and hospital closures in Los Angeles County make Los Angeles \n1  11 County especially vulnerable to reductions in Medi-Cal payments.

He has a history of seizures and has a shunt in his brain to drain off \n6 excess fluid.  He also has a history of hypertension and depression.  Mr. Gallagher \n7 lives alone and is dependent for assistance on a part-time caregiver at home and on \n8 ADSNV.

Medi-Cal providers are in a unique position to advance the interests of \n20 Medi-Cal beneficiaries.  The members of Associational Plaintiffs which provide \n \n21 services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries have an extremely close relationship with their \n22 Medi-Cal beneficiary patients who seek that care.  A Medi-Cal beneficiary cannot \n23 secure medical services without his/her health care providers, and without \n24 reimbursement by Medi-Cal for those services. Medi-Cal providers are better \n25 positioned and informed as to the impact of a reimbursement rate cut on the \n26 services they intend to provide.   \n27 63.  Furthermore, Medi-Cal beneficiaries face economic hindrances to their \n28 ability to assert their own rights in this case.  To qualify for Medi-Cal, an individual \n2018549.4    23 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00722-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 01/29/09   Page 24 of 37   Page ID #:24\n \n1 must demonstrate financial need for medical assistance from the State.  In light of \n2 their finances and the cost of litigation, Medi-Cal beneficiaries may not be able to \n3 effectively protect their interests.   \n4 64.  Associational Plaintiffs, as associations representing the interests of \n5 doctors, dentists, pharmacies, hospitals and ADHCs that participate in the Medi-Cal \n6 program and the Medi-Cal beneficiaries served by these providers, and as parties \n7 seeking to compel the Director to comply with his public duties as defined by \n8 federal law, have a right and an enforceable interest to maintain this action to: (1) \n9 enjoin Defendantโs continuing violation of federal Medicaid law; and (2) compel \n10 Defendant to comply with the provisions of the applicable federal laws.   \n1  11 65.

As providers in the Medi-Cal program, the Provider Plaintiffs will \n22 suffer a concrete economic injury in the form of reduced payment for services if the \n23 AB 1183 Rate Reductions are implemented.   \n24 68.  Provider Plaintiffs have a sufficiently close relationship with their \n25 patients who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries to have third-party standing on behalf of \n26 their beneficiary plaintiffs. There are hindrances or genuine obstacles to Medi-Cal \n27 beneficiariesโ ability to assert their own interests.  Here, the obstacle Medi-Cal \n28 beneficiaries face is a lack of information about the effect of Medi-Cal \n2018549.4    24 \nCOMPLAINT \n \n\nCase 2:09-cv-00722-CAS-MAN   Document 1    Filed 01/29/09   Page 25 of 37   Page ID #:25\n \n1 reimbursement rates on providers in light of providers' costs and the further effect of \n2 a rate cut on the provision of services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries.

Neither the Director nor the Legislature considered the factors of \n25 efficiency, economy, quality of care, and access to services prior to \n26 enacting the AB 1183 Rate Reductions; \n27 c.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND \nOn September 16, 2008, the California Legislature passed \nAssembly  Bill  1183  (โAB  1183โ),  which  was \nsubsequently signed by the Governor and filed with the \nSynopsis \nSecretary of State on September 30, 2008. AB 1183, inter \nBackground: Health care providers and others brought \nalia, amends Cal. Welf. & Inst.Code. ยง 14105.191 and ยง \nsuit against the Director of the Department of Health Care \n14166.245, mandating that, for dates of service on or after \nServices  of  the  State  of  California,  challenging  the \nMarch 1, 2009, MediโCal reimbursement payments to \nvalidity  of  legislation  mandating  a  five  percent  rate \nsome  fee-for-service  providers  are  reduced  by  one \nreduction for Medi-Calโs fee-for-service benefits paid to \npercent,  five  percent,  or  ten  percent,  depending  on \nadult day health centers (ADHCs). Plaintiffs moved for \nprovider type. Particularly relevant to the instant action, \npreliminary injunctive relief. \nAB  1183  mandates  a  five  percent  rate  reduction  for \n  \nMediโCal fee-for-service benefits paid to pharmacies and \nAdult Day Health Centers (โADHCsโ). \nHoldings: The District Court, Christina A. Snyder, J.,    \nheld that:  These reductions mandated in AB 1183 replace the ten \n   percent rate reduction put into place by Assembly Bill \n[1] Eleventh Amendment did not bar the suit;  X35 (โAB 5โ), which terminates on February 28, 2009. \n   See Cal.

On August 18, 2008, the ten percent rate reduction \n[3] preliminary injunctive relief was warranted.  mandated by AB 5 was partially enjoined by this Court in \n   a related action, Independent Living Center of Southern \nCalifornia, Inc. v. Sandra Shewry, CVโ08โ3315โCAS. In \nOrdered accordingly.  issuing the preliminary injunction, this Court found that \n   petitioners  had,  inter  alia,  demonstrated  a  strong \nlikelihood  of  success  in  showing  that  AB  5  was \nAttorneys and Law Firms  preempted by ยง 30(A) of the Medicaid Act (referred to \nherein as โยง 30(A)โ).

The Courtโs June 25, 2008 order found that plaintiffs in Independent \n \nLiving lacked any federal rights under ยง 30(A), and therefore had denied petitionersโ motion for preliminary injunction. On appeal, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs could bring suit under the Supremacy Clause to enjoin AB 5 as preempted under the Medicaid \nAct, and remanded to this Court. See Independent Living Center of Southern California et al. v. Sandra Shewry et al., 543 F.3d \n1050 (9th Cir.2008). \n \n2  In Managed Pharmacy Care, et al. v. David MaxwellโJolly, CV09โ382โCAS, plaintiffsโ arguments regarding irreparable harm \nfocused on brand and generic drugs dispensed by pharmacies. The Court therefore found that plaintiffs had not shown irreparable \n \nharm as to the effect of the five percent rate reduction on other pharmacy products, and limited the scope of the injunction to drug \nproducts dispensed by pharmacies. \nIn their reply, plaintiffs request that the Court rule on the merits of their motion for injunction as to pharmacies, arguing that the \nscope  of  the  injunction  requested  in  the  instant  action  is  broader  than  that  granted  in  Managed  Pharmacy  Care,\nCV09โ382โCAS. However, plaintiffs offer no basis for extending the scope of the injunction as to pharmacies issued in \nManaged Pharmacy Care, and, after examining the evidence submitted by plaintiffs in the instant action, the Court finds no \nbasis for such an extension. \n \n3  The hospitals did not, however, challenge the rates under the โequal accessโ provision. Orthopaedic I, 1992 WL 345652 at *14 n. \n4. \n \n \n4  See e.g., Alaska Depโt of Health & Soc. Servs. v.

Socโy v. Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 530 (8th Cir.1993) (โWe agree with the trial courtโs conclusion that the relevant \nfactors that DHS is obliged to consider in its rate-making decisions are the factors outlined in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A).โ); cf. \nMethodist Hosps. v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1030 (7th Cir.1996) (finding that ยง 30(A) does not require a state to consider any \nparticular factors, but rather, requires that the state arrive at substantive results consistent with the Medicaid Act); Rite Aid, Inc. v. \nHoustoun, 171 F.3d 842 (3d Cir.1999) (same). \n \n5  Subsequently, in Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051 (9th Cir.2005), the Ninth Circuit held that ยง 30(A) does not confer individual \nrights that are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Id. at 1060. However, in Independent Living, 543 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2008), the \n \nNinth Circuit held that โa plaintiff seeking injunctive relief under the Supremacy Clause on the basis of federal preemption need \nnot assert a federally created โright,โ in the sense that term has been recently used in suits brought under ยง 1983, but need only \nsatisfy traditional standing requirements.โ Independent Living, 543 F.3d 1050, 1058 (9th Cir.2008). \n \n6  The Department states that because it is in the process of auditing costs of ADHCs, it is not able to assess how current ADHC \nreimbursement in the aggregate compares to the reasonable and allowable costs that ADHCs incur. See Eng Decl. ยถ 4. Therefore, \n \nthe Departmentโs analysis uses as a proxy the costs of intermediate care facilities (โNFโAsโ). Plaintiff disputes the validity of this \nproxy, arguing that there is no basis for equating the costs of NFโAs with the costs of ADHCs. Reply at 12. \n \n7  Furthermore, if the five percent rate reduction is given effect, many MediโCal beneficiaries may turn to more costly forms of \nmedical care, such as emergency room care, thereby diminishing the Stateโs projected savings. See e.g., Rodde v. Bonta, 357 F.3d \n \n988, 999 (9th Cir.2004). \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  8\n ",

The Courtโs June 25, 2008 order found that plaintiffs in Independent \n \nLiving lacked any federal rights under ยง 30(A), and therefore had denied petitionersโ motion for preliminary injunction. On appeal, \nthe Ninth Circuit held that plaintiffs could bring suit under the Supremacy Clause to enjoin AB 5 as preempted under the Medicaid \nAct, and remanded to this Court. See Independent Living Center of Southern California et. al. v. Sandra Shewry et al., 543 F.3d \n1050 (9th Cir.2008). \n \n2  By contrast, where non-contract hospitals are located in the same geographic area (known as a Health Facility Planning Area) \nwhere contract hospitals are providing adequate services to the areaโs populations, the hospitals not covered by a contract will be \n \nreimbursed only in emergency situations. \n \n3  Defendant note that non-contract hospitals may also receive supplemental MediCal reimbursements under programs such as the \ndisproportionate share hospital (DSH) program, the Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP) program, and the Health Care Coverage \n \nInitiative (HCCI) program.

Reynolds, 6 F.3d 519, 530 (8th Cir.1993) (โWe agree with the trial courtโs conclusion that the relevant \n \nfactors that DHS is obliged to consider in its rate-making decisions are the factors outlined in 42 U.S.C. ยง 1396a(a)(30)(A).โ); cf. \nMethodist Hosps. v. Sullivan, 91 F.3d 1026, 1030 (7th Cir.1996) (finding that ยง 30(A) does not require a state to consider any \nparticular factors, but rather, requires that the state arrive at substantive results consistent with the Medicaid Act); Rite Aid, Inc. v. \nHoustoun, 171 F.3d 842 (3d Cir.1999) (same). \n \n7  Subsequently, in Sanchez v. Johnson, 416 F.3d 1051 (9th Cir.2005), the Ninth Circuit held that ยง 30(A) does not confer individual \nrights that are enforceable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. Id. at 1060. However, in Independent Living, 543 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2008), the \n \nNinth Circuit held that โa plaintiff seeking injunctive relief under the Supremacy Clause on the basis of federal preemption need \nnot assert a federally created โright,โ in the sense that term has been recently used in suits brought under ยง 1983, but need only \nsatisfy traditional standing requirements.โ Independent Living, 543 F.3d 1050, 1058 (9th Cir.2008). \n \n8  Defendant argues that โthe Legislature followed the advice of the Legislative Analyst Officeโs (LAO) report concerning the \n2008โ2009 Budget ... While the LAO expressed concerns about reductions for physician services, the LAO stated that โHospitals \n \nand some other providers have received recent rate increases. In contrast to physicians, MediโCal adjusts on an annual basis the \nreimbursement rates for certain other providers.โ โ Oppโn at 1. While defendant is correct that the LAO report discussed the \npossible rate reduction for hospital services, and ultimately concluded that such reductions were advisable, defendant presents no \nevidence to indicate that the Legislature actually reviewed or considered the LAOโs report in passing AB 1183. \n \n9  Plaintiffs also argue that (1) AB 1183 is preempted by ยง 13(A) of the Medicaid Act, because the State failed to comply with that \nprovisionโs notice-and-comment requirements, and (2) AB 1183 violates 42 C.F.R. ยงยง 430.12, 447.252, 447.256(a)(I) because it \n \nwas implemented without approval from the Federal government. Because the Court finds herein that plaintiffs have established a \nstrong likelihood of success in demonstrating that the AB 1183 rate reductions for hospitals are preempted by ยง 30(A), the Court \nneed not reach these issues. \n \n10  Plaintiffs also argue that hospitals will suffer pecuniary harm, and that such harm is irreparable because retroactive monetary \nclaims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment in this action. Mot. at 22, citing Kansas Health Care Assoc. v. Kansas Dept. Of \n \nSocial and Rehabilitation Svcs., 31 F.3d 1536, 1543 (10th Cir.1994) (harm from inadequate Medicaid reimbursement rates would \nbe irreparable because Eleventh Amendment bars retrospective monetary relief). However, the Court notes that in that case, the \nCourt held โthe Eleventh Amendment bar simply indicates irreparability, but does not, in itself, establish harm.โ See id. \n \n \n\n \nCalifornia Pharmacists Assโn v. Jolly, 630 F.Supp.2d 1154 (2009) \n \n \n11  Plaintiffs argue that the disparity between plaintiffsโ cost estimate (reimbursement at 79 percent of costs) and defendantโs cost \nestimate is that defendant included in the analysis supplemental payments, which were only received by 13 of the 78 hospitals \n \nincluded in the analysis. Reply at 15โ16. \n \n12  Plaintiffs, however, respond that many of the supplemental reimbursement programs provide funding for services to non-MediCal \npatients. Reply at 13. \n \n \n13  Because the Court finds herein that plaintiffs have failed to show irreparable harm, the Court determines that, regardless of the \nCourtโs findings regarding the balance of hardships and the public interest, a preliminary injunction is not warranted. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n ",

Mirroring the analysis of todayโs holdings, we address the \nchallenges to AB 1183 with respect to pharmacy and hospital providers, as well as their beneficiaries, in two separate, concurrently \n \nfiled memorandum dispositions. \n \n2  The Directorโs reliance on Folden v. Wash. State Depโt of Soc. & Health Servs., 981 F.2d 1054 (9th Cir.1992), is also misplaced. In \nFolden, the owners of fourteen nursing home care facilities challenged Washington state Medicaid payments under a now repealed \n \nsection of the Medicaid Act known as the Boren Amendment. 981 F.2d at 1056. We have numerous times rejected the Directorโs \nattempt to โgraft past judicial interpretation of the Boren Amendment onto this courtโs interpretation of ยง 30(A).โ Indep. Living II,\n572 F.3d at 654โ56 & nn. 11โ12; Alaska Depโt of Health and Soc. Servs. v. Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., 424 F.3d 931, \n940โ41 (9th Cir.2005). \n \n3  The Directorโs argument that he has discretion regarding the rates is drawn from a footnote in the district courtโs analysis in \nOrthopaedic I. There, the Director argued that legislative consideration of the ยง 30(A) factors excused the Department from again \n \nhaving to consider ยง 30(A). In rejecting that argument, the district court noted that the relevant statutory enactments โgave the \nDepartment fairly wide discretion in implementing the basic changes outlined in the statute.โ Orthopaedic I, 1992 WL 345652, at \n*9. To buttress that conclusion, the district court pointed out that under the Medicaid Act, the โultimate responsibilityโ for \nadministration of a stateโs Medicaid program is entrusted to a โsingle state agency.โ Id. at n. 14 (quoting 42 C.F.R. ยง 431.10). As a \nresult, the district court concluded that under federal law, the state agency has the โfinal say in what payment rates to set, \nnotwithstanding a legislatureโs efforts to provide broad guidelines for the agency.โ Id. (emphasis added). The court found it \nparticularly relevant that the California legislature directed the Department to โseek federal approval for this section, if necessary.โ\nId. (citing California Senate Bill 2563) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court also noted that subsection (a) under the \nMediโCal enabling statute grants the Department โextremely broad authorityโ to โcomply with legislative budgetary enactmentsโ\nonly to the extent that those enactments comply with federal law. Id. \nAs we have described, there are a number of notable differences between the legislative enactments at issue in Orthopaedic I\nand AB 1183, thus raising the question of whether, under AB 1183, the Director had the โfinal say in what payment rates to set.โ\n \n\n \nCalifornia Pharmacists Assโn v. Maxwell-Jolly, 596 F.3d 1098 (2010) \n \n \nId. However, because we reject the Directorโs argument for the reasons set forth below, we do not decide whether differences \nbetween AB 1183 and the legislative enactments at issue in Orthopaedic I are dispositive of the Directorโs discretion in this \ncase. \n \n4  At oral argument the Director conceded that he did not have authority to change the rates set by the legislature, but, he argued, he \ncould exercise a veto power based on a determination that the rates did not comply with the statutory factors in ยง 30(A). We need \n \nnot decide whether the type of discretion contemplated by ยง 14105(a) of the California Welfare & Institutions Code is different \nfrom that under ยง 14105.191(i). That is, that the Director may โlimit the rates,โ or โadopt regulations setting ratesโ under ยง \n14105(a) would seem to provide for a different type of discretion than deciding simply not to implement the rates as set. However, \nbecause we hold that the Director did not retain any discretion to act once rates had been set, we do not discuss the distinction, if \nany, between the discretion contemplated by ยง 14105(a) as opposed to ยง 14105.191(i). \n \n5  We need not decide whether a study completed after rates have been set complies with ยง 30(A) where the Department has \ndiscretion not to implement the rates. For purposes of our analysis only, we assume such a study would suffice, but do not so hold \n \nbecause we find that the Director did not retain any discretion in this case. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n ",
