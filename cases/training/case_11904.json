This action is brought by the United States to enforce the provisions of the Fair \nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (\"FHA\"), and the Equal Credit OppOltunity Act, 15 \nU.S.c. §§ 1691-1691f(\"ECOA\"). \n2.  This Court has jurisdiction ofthis action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1345,42 U.S.c. \n§ 3614, and 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(h).  Venue is appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.c. § 1391. \n3.  PrimeLending, a Texas corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Plains Capital \nBank, a bank chartered by the Texas Department of Banking and a member of the Federal \nReserve System.  PlainsCapital Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Plains Capital Corporation. \nPrimeLending's principal place of business is 2323 Victory Avenue, Suite 1400, Dallas, Texas, \nand it is subject to the regulatory authority of the Federal Reserve System. \n4.  PrimeLending is a residential mortgage lender offering conventional prime loans and \nloans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs.  It \noperates through a retail model of accepting applications and originating loans using its own \nemployees.  Although its lending continues to be concentrated most heavily in Texas, \n-1-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 1    Filed 12/08/10    Page 2 of 8   PageID 2 \nparticularly in the Dallas market, it had expanded by the end of 2009 to operate 168 offices in 32 \nstates.  In 2009, PrimeLending originated more than 30,000 loans secured by residential real \nestate, with an aggregate principal value of more than $5.5 billion, and it was one of the 20-\nlargest lenders in the Federal Housing Administration loan program. \n5.  PrimeLending is subject to Federal laws governing fair lending, including the FHA \nand the ECOA and the regulations promulgated under each of those laws.  The FHA and the \nECOA prohibit financial institutions from discriminating on the basis of, inter alia, race in their \nlending practices.  Charging higher prices for loans on the basis of race, including charging \nhigher annual percentage rates of interest, is one of the discriminatory lending practices \nprohibited by the FHA and the ECOA. \n6.  PrimeLending is a \"creditor\" within the meaning of the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. § 169Ia(e), \nand engages in \"residential real estate-related transactions\" within the meaning of the FHA, 42 \nU.S.C. § 3605.  PrimeLending also is subject to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 12 U.S.c. \n§ 2803, which requires mortgage lenders to maintain data on the race of each borrower. \n7.  Beginning in 2008, the Federal Reserve System conducted an examination of the \nlending practices of PrimeLending to evaluate compliance with, among other laws, the FHA and \nthe ECOA.  Based on analysis of the annual percentage rates of interest that PrimeLending \ncharged in 2006 and 2007 for conforming fixed-rate loans secured by residential real estate and \nfor loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Depat1ment of Veterans Affairs \nsecured by residential real estate (collectively, \"the examined loan products\"), the Federal \nReserve System found reason to believe that PrimeLending had displayed a pattern or practice of \ndiscrimination on the basis of race against African-American borrowers.  Further, the Federal \n~2-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 1    Filed 12/08/10    Page 3 of 8   PageID 3 \nReserve System found that PrimeLending did not have robust fair lending controls.  On \nDecember 15, 2009, following the examination described above, the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System referred the lending practices of PrimeLending to the United States \nDepartment of Justice pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 169Je(g). \n8.  PlainsCapital Corporation has disclosed in a public securities filing that the Federal \nReserve in the spring of 20 I 0 gave PlainsCapital Bank a \"needs to improve record of meeting \ncommunity credit needs\" rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, J 2 U.S.C. § 2906, as a \nresult of alleged fair lending issues associated with PrimeLending. \n9.  After receiving the referral from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, the United States Department of Justice analyzed the annual percentage rates of interest \nthat PrimeLending charged between 2006 and 2009 for the examined loan products. \n10.  Between at least 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending gave its employees wide discretion to \ncharge \"overages\" or accept \"underages\" that raised or lowered, respectively, the annual \npercentage rate of interest paid by borrowers from the \"par\" interest rate at which PrimeLending \nwould originate the loan.  These par rates were communicated to employees through the daily \ndistribution of \"rate sheets.\"  PrimeLending did not monitor or separately record overage or \nunderage data for those years. \n11.  The compensation of PrimeLending's employees was, in part, based on their ability \nto charge overages and avoid accepting underages.  Prior to 2010, PrimeLending did not \nestablish objective criteria to be followed by employees in charging overages or accepting \nunderages.  Moreover, prior to 20 I 0, it did not require employees to document the reasons for \ncharging overages or accepting underages, it did not monitor whether discrimination based on \n-3-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 1    Filed 12/08/10    Page 4 of 8   PageID 4 \nrace occurred through the inclusion of overages and underages, and it did not offer detailed fair \nlending training to its employees. \n12.  Between 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending charged higher loan prices to African \nAmerican borrowers, as measured through the annual percentage rates of interest for the \n\"examined loan products,\" than it charged to similarly-situated white borrowers.  The differences \nin the annual percentage rates of interest charged to African-Americans borrowers for the \n\"examined loan products\" and those charged to white borrowers cannot be explained fully by \nfactors unrelated to race. \n13.  In each year between 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending charged annual percentage rates \nof interest between 11 and 14 basis points I higher nationwide to African-Americans who \nobtained conforming fixed-rate loans secured by residential real estate than the annual \npercentage rate of interest charged to similarly-situated whites, after accounting for all the credit \nrisk factors (such as credit score, loan-to-value ratio, and property type) that PrimeLending's \nratesheets used to set the par rate.  These disparities are statistically significant, and mean that an \nAfrican-American borrower who took out a $200,000 loan of this type, on average, annually paid \napproximately $220 to $280 more in interest than a similarly-situated white borrower during \neach year that he or she remained in the loan. \n14.  In each year between 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending charged annual percentage rates \nof interest between 5 and 11  basis points higher nationwide to African-Americans who obtained \nloans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and Depaltment of Veterans Affairs \nsecured by residential real estate than the annual percentage rate of interest charged to similarly \nsituated whites, after accounting for all the credit risk factors that PrimeLending's ratesheets \nlOne basis point represents one hundredth of a percentage point (0.01 %). \n-4-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 1    Filed 12/08/10    Page 5 of 8   PageID 5 \nused to set the par rate.  These disparities are statistically significant, and mean that an African \nAmerican borrower who took out a $200,000 loan of this type, on average, annually paid \napproximately $ 100 to $220 more in interest than a similarly-situated white borrower during \neach year that he or she remained in the loan. \n15.  Between 2006 and 2009, PrimeLending made nearly 3,300 loans to African \nAmerican borrowers that involved the examined loan products with statistically significant \npricing disparities. These disparities will result in African-American borrowers continuing to \npay additional interest because of race in each monthly mortgage payment they make until the \nloan is paid off, as many as 30 years in the future. \n16.  The higher annual percentage rates of interest that PrimeLending charged to African \nAmerican borrowers for \"the examined loan products\" are a result of PrimeLending's policy or \npractice of giving its employees wide subjective discretion in charging overages and accepting \nunderages that altered the annual percentage rate of interest for a loan. \n17.  PrimeLending's policy or practice of giving its employees wide subjective discretion \nin charging overages and accepting underages that altered the annual percentage rate of interest \nfor a loan have had a disparate impact on African-American borrowers compared to similarly \nsituated white borrowers. \n18.  PrimeLending's policy or practice of giving its employees wide subjective discretion \nin charging overages and accepting underages is not justified by business necessity or legitimate \nbusiness interests. \n19.  PrimeLending's actions, policies and practices, as alleged herein, constitute: \n-5-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 1    Filed 12/08/10    Page 6 of 8   PageID 6 \na.

The Order resolves the claims of the United States that the Defendant, PrimeLcnding, \nhas engaged in a pattern or practice of conduct in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 \nU.S.c. §§ 3601-3619, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), 15 U.S.c. §§ 1691-1691 C \nby charging African-American borrowers higher annual percentage rates of interest for certain \nfixcd rate loans and certain loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs secured by residential real estate than charged to non-Hispanic \nwhite borrowers between 2006 and 2009. Defendant denies that it discriminated unlawfully in \nsetting loan prices. \nDefendant has altered its pricing policy prior (0 the entry of this Order, and, under the \nprovisions of the Order, (he Defendant agrees (0 continue (0 implement policies and procedures \ndesigned to ensure that the price charged for its residential loan products, including the portion of \nthe pricc that reflects the discretion of the loan officer or any other company employee, is set in a \n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 2 of 21   PageID 12 \nnondiscriminatory manner consistent with the requirements ofthe FHA and the ECOA. In \naddition, the Defendant will compensate certain African-American borrowers. \nThere has been no factuallinding or adjudication with respect to any matter alleged by \nthc United States. The parties have entered into this Order to avoid the risks and burdens of \nlitigation, and to resolve voluntarily the claims in the United States' Complaint relating to \nDefendant's alleged violations of fair lending laws. \nII. BACKGROUND \nPrime Lending is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PlainsCapital Bank, a bank chartered by \nthe Texas Department of Banking and a member of the Federal Reserve System. PrimeLending's \nprincipal place of business is Dallas, Texas. \nPrime Lending engages in retail mortgage lending. Historically, the company has largely \nconcentrated its lending in Texas, particularly Dallas, but has opened other branches throughout \nthe country in more recent years. It originated more than 30,000 loans secured by residential real \nestate in 2009, and, at the end of 2009, it originated these loans through employees who worked \nin 168 offices located in 32 states. PrimeLending has rapidly expanded its operations over the \npast several years, with originations of loans secured by residential real estate more than tripling \nbetween 2007 and 2009. Consistent with other mortgage lenders, the company's volume of loans \nguaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration has grown at an even more rapid clip over \nthat period, with an increase fl'Om under 1,500 such loans in 2007 to nearly 15,000 in 2009. \nPrior to 20 I 0, PrimeLending did not limit the discretion of its employees to charge \n\"overages\" or accept \"underages,\" which could influence the overall price of the loan. Par prices, \nthe price of the loan before any overage 01' underage, were communicated to employees through \nthe dai Iy distribution of \"rate sheets. \" Prior to 20 I 0, PrimcLending did not require its employees \nto document the reasons for charging overages or accepting undcragcs. The compensation of \n-2-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 3 of 21   PageID 13 \nPrimeLending's employees was, in part, based on their ability to charge overages and avoid \naccepting underages. \nThe Federal Reserve System began in 2008 to examine the lending practices of \nPrimeLending to evaluate compliance with, among other laws, the FHA and the [eOA. The \nFederal Reserve System analyzed the annual percentage rates (APR) of interest charged for \ncertain fixed rate and government-guaranteed loans secured by residential real estate that \nPrimeLending originated in 2006 and 2007. Although PrimeLending did not monitor or \nseparately record overage or underage data for those years. the APR, in part. reflects the \ndiscretionary pOliion of the loan price. The Federal Reserve System found reason to believe that \nPrimeLending had displayed a pattern or practice of charging African-American borrowers \nhigher annual percentage rates of interest than non-Hispanic white borrowers that, in the \nagency's view, could not be explained fully by factors unrelated to race. Further, the Federal \nReserve System found that Prime Lending did not have robust fair lending controls. \nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System referred this matter to the United \nStates Department of Justice on December 15,2009 for appropriate enforcement pursuant to 15 \nU.s.c. § 169Ie(g). In addition to the information obtained from the Federal Reserve System, the \nUnited States reviewed the annual percentage rates of interest charged for certain fixed rate and \ngovernmcnt-guaranteed loans secured by residential real estate that PrimeLending originated \nbetween 2006 and 2009. The Defendant promptly approached the United States to seek a \nmutually agreeable resolution of this matter, and it cooperated in good faith with the United \nStates throughout its inquiry. \nBoth parties have agreed to the entry of this Order to resolve voluntarily the claims \nasserted by the United States in order to avoid the costs, risks, and burdens of' litigation. \n-3-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 4 of 21   PageID 14 \nIII. MODIFICATION OF LOAN PRICING AND MONITORING PRACTICES \nSubsequent to the referral from the Federal Reserve System, Prime Lending altered its \nloan pricing policy to advance fair lending compliance. The company began to measure the \ndiscretionary portion of the price of each loan so that overages and underages could be \ndetermined and monitored to ensure that any deviations from the starting price are not based on \nfactors prohibited by the FHA or the ECOA. \nThe company adopted a pricing policy that limits overages to 100 basis points (1.00% of \nthe loan principal) and requires written explanations li'OIn loan officers for all overages and \nunderages that exceed 50 basis points (0.50% of the loan principal). The company hired outside \neconomists to evaluate loan pricing to borrowers of different races and ethnicities to ensure that \npricing was being effectuated without regard to impermissible factors. \nPrimeLending of11cials consult with regional managers and branch managers to ensure \nuniform compliance with fair lending standards. The company has developed a national training \nprogram to ensure that the pricing policy is understood by all employees who interact with \nconsumers or otherwise are involved in the loan pricing or loan approval process. \nIV. REMEDIAL ORDER \nI.  Unless otherwise stated herein, the remedial provisions of this Order shall be \nimplemented within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Order and shall continue throughout its \ntenn. The Effective Date of this Order shall be the date on which it is approved and entered by \nthe Court. \nA.  General Nondiscrimination Injunction \n2.  The Defendant, including all of its officers, employees, agents, assignees, \nsuccessors in interest, and all those in active concert 01' participation with any of them, is hereby \nenjoined from engaging in any act or practice that discriminates on the basis of race in any aspect \n-4-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 5 of 21   PageID 15 \nofa residential real estate-related transaction in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ \n3604 and 3605, or in any aspect ofa credit transaction in violation of the Equal Credit \nOpportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(I). This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, the \nadoption, performance, or implementation of any policy, practice, or act that results in race \ndiscrimination in the charging of loan prices. including the portion of the loan price thaI reflects \nthe discretion of the loan officer or any other company employee, to those who borrow moncy \nsecured by residential real estate. \nB.  Lending Policies and Procedures \n3.  Until April 1,2011, the Defendant shall continue to follow the pricing policy \ndescribed above that Ii mits overages to 100 basis points. Effective April I, 20 I I, in accordance \nwith the Federal Reserve System Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. § 226.36(d), the Defendant shall \nprohibit its employees from receiving, directly or indirectly, overages or other compensation in \nan amount that is based on any of the terms or conditions of a loan sccured by residential real \nestate, including the annual percentage rate of interest charged to the borrower or the amount by \nwhich it varies hom the par rate. This prohibition shall not limit compensation that is based on \nthe principal amount of a loan, provided the compensation is based on a fixed percentage of the \nprincipal; however, such compensation may be subject to a minimum or maximum dollar \namount. This prohibition also shall not limit the Defendant fi'om allowing a borrower to finance, \nat the option of the borrower, including through principal or rate, any origination fees or costs, so \n-5-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 6 of 21   PageID 16 \nlong as such fees or costs do not vary based on the terms of the loan (other than the amount of \nthe principal) or the borrower's decision about whether to finance such fees or costs. I \n4.  Within 30 days of the Effective Date of this Order, the Defendant shall set \nspecific, nonracial standards for the assessment of all origination fees and costs it charges and \nretains for itself or pays to its employees on loans secured by residential real estate. To the extent \nit allows discretion in the amount of these fees and costs, loan oiTicers wi II provide a written \nexplanation for all discretionary amounts charged that result in overages or underages that \nexceed 50 basis points. \n5.  The Defendant shall require all employees who originatc loans secured by \nresidcntial real estate to comply with the requirements established in Paragraphs 3-4. The \nDefendant shall also require an appropriate manager, under the supervision of a designated \nsenior oiTieial oflhe Defendant, to review compliance with thcsc requirements, including the \ncxistence of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for any overage or underages that exceeds 50 \nbasis points and ensuring that discretionary loan prices do not vary materially by race or \nethnicity. Any loan that is not in compliancc with these requirements may not be funded. In the \nevent that a loan inadvertently is funded in material violation of the policy, an appropriate refund \nwill be provided to the borrower. All reviews shall be documented and kept in the loan file. \nI  No term of this Consent Order will be interpreted to prevent the Defendant from complying \nwith any federal statutory or regulatory requirement concerning loan officer compensation or \nloan pricing. In the event that the federally scheduled implementation of Regulation Z is \nmodified, Defendant may continue with its current loan pricing policy pending the effective date \nof any modified provisions, but will remain under the obligation to ensure nondiscrimination as \nrequired by this Consent Order. \n-6-\n\nCase 3:10-cv-02494-P   Document 3    Filed 01/11/11    Page 7 of 21   PageID 17 \nC.
