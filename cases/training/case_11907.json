(the \"Fair Housing Act\" or the \"Act\").  The United States brings this action on behalf \nof DeVauglm Duncan and her three children, James Gainey, Charles Tucker and RW, \npursuant to Section 812(0) of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3612(0) . \n.J urisdiction and Venue \n2.

They have rented these properties through the Tampa Housing Authority \n(\"THA\") Housing Choice Voucher (\"Section 8\") Program. \n5.  The subject property is a dwelling within the meaning of 42 U.S.c. § 3602(b). \n6.  At all times relevant to this action, Defendants were both involved in all aspects of the \nrental of their jointly owned  properties,  including the subject property,  and served  as \nagents for each other with respect to such rentals. \nFactual Allegations \n7.  Complainant DeVaughn Duncan is an African-American woman.  Ms. Duncan's \nchildren, Complainants James Gainey, Charles Tucker and RW, who are also African \nAmerican, were sixteen (16), fifteen (15), and eleven (11)-years old, respectively, in \nAugust 2007. \n8.  In mid-July 2007, Ms. Duncan, who was a participant in THA's Section 8 voucher \nprogram, visited THA's Section 8 office seeking a home for herself and her children. At \nthe office, she saw a listing for the subject property. \n9.  Shortly afterward, Ms. Duncan contacted Mr. Cairns and told him she would like to see \nthe property.  The two met at the property on or about July 9, 2007, and, after Mr. Cairns \nshowed her the home, Ms. Duncan informed him that she would like to rent it for  herself \nand her three minor children begirming in late July or early August 2007. \n10.  On or about July 12,2007, TEA issued Ms. Duncan a Section 8 voucher for the home, \nsetting the maximum monthly rental value of the property and stating that a \"payment \nnotice\" of the rental amount Ms. Duncan would be obligated to pay under the voucher \n2 \n\nCase 8:11-cv-00100-RAL-TGW   Document 1    Filed 01/14/11   Page 3 of 8 PageID 3\nprogram would be issued after the unit passes inspection and the family moves in.  Under \nthe terms of the program, Tl-IA would pay the remainder of any approved rental amount. \nII.  On or about July 30, 2007, Mr. Cairns and Ms. Duncan met again and signed a lease \nfor the subject property, and Mr. Cairns gave Ms. Duncan the keys to the property. \nMr. Cairns informed Ms. Duncan that he would work with her if she were unable to pay a \nfull month's rent and the full security deposit by the move-in date.  Accordingly, the two \nagreed orally that Ms. Duncan would pay approximately half of the first month's rent \nand half of the security deposit after the move-in date. \n12.  Defendants offered 10 reduce or defer move-in payments, such a<; the first month's rent \nand security deposit, to other Section 8 tenants of theirs. \n13.  On August 2, 2007, Ms. Duncan and her three children moved into the subject properly. \nMs. Duncan and Mr. Cairns agreed to meet at the property at I :00 p.m. on August 4, \n2007, at which lime Ms. Duncan was to pay Mr. Cairns approximately halfofthe first \nmonth's rcnt and half of the security deposit, with the expectation that THA would pay \nthe balance of the rent after it inspected the property and set a maximum monthly rent. \n14.  On the even.ing of August 3, 2007, Ms. Duncan telephoned Mr. Cairns to remind him of \ntheir scheduled meeting the next day.  During that conversation, Mr. Cairns said he \nthought they were to meet at 11 :00 a.m., rather than I :00 p.m., but Ms. Duncan reminded \nhim that the scheduled time of their meeting was 1: 00 p.m. \n1S .  On August 4, 2007, Mr. Cairns telephoned Ms. Duncan at her office shortly after 11: 00 \n3.111., infonning her that he was at the property and demanding to know why she was \nnot there to meet him.  She reminded him again that they were to meet at I :00, not \n11 :00, and said that she had arranged to have someone else meet him at the property at \n3 \n\nCase 8:11-cv-00100-RAL-TGW   Document 1    Filed 01/14/11   Page 4 of 8 PageID 4\n1: 00 to pay him because she could not leave work.  Mr. Caims told Ms. Duncan that if \nshe were not at the property in fifteen minutes, he would change the locks on the doors. \n16.  At that point, Ms. Duncan lost her cell phone connection with Mr. Cairns and \nirrunediately tried to call him several times from her office phone, but he did not pick up. \n17.  Ms. Duncan telephoned her husband, Michael Brown, and asked him to go directly to the \nproperty to pay Mr. Cairns with money she had given him previously for that purpose. \nMr. Brown arrived at the property at approximately 12:30 p.rn. with the agreed-upon \namount to pay Mr. Cairns.  Upon his arrival, Mr. Brown saw Mr. Cairns coming out of \nthe house with a clear plastic bag full of locks.  When Mr. Brown approached Mr. Cairns \nand offered him the money, Mr. Cairns told him it was too late because he had already \nchanged the locks. \n18.  Mr. Brown asked Mr. Cairns where Ms. Duncan's children were.  Mr. Cairns replied that \nhe told them they had to get out of the house and to go to the neighbors' house because \nhe was changing the locks.  Then Mr. Cairns drove  away with Mrs. Cairns, who was \nwaiting for him in a vehicle in fTont of the property.  Mr. Brown confirnled that thc locks \nhad been changed and that the children were not inside the house, and he checked the \nneighbors' house but the children were not there. \n19.  Mr. Brown telephoned Ms. Duncan, who became frantic when he told her what had \nhappened.  He initiated a search for the children and found them nearly tJlfee hours later \nunder all underpass approximately a quarter-mile from the subject property.  The children \nwere still dressed in their night clothes. \n20.  Later that day, Ms. Duncan checked into a motel with her three children and drove with \nMr. Brown to the subject property.  From there she telephoned the Hillsborough County \n4 \n\nCase 8:11-cv-00100-RAL-TGW   Document 1    Filed 01/14/11   Page 5 of 8 PageID 5\nSheriffs Department to report that she and her children had been evicted and locked out \nofmeir home.  A sheriffs deputy mel them at the property and telephoned Mr. Cairns \nfrom his cell phone.  When Mr. Cairns answered, the deputy explained to him that \nunder Florida law, he could not evict the family without a court order. \n21.  While the deputy was talking with Mr. Cairns, Mrs. Cairns took the phone and the deputy \nrepeated what he had told her husband.  Mrs. Cairns replied mat it was her house and \nshe could do what she wanted.  When the deputy told her she was mistaken, Mrs. Cairns \nresponded, \"Let me talk to that f**king nigger,\" or words to that effect, referring to Ms. \nDuncan.  The deputy advised her that her language was inappropriate and she cursed at \nhim. \n22.  The deputy handed the phone to Ms. Duncan, and Mrs. Cairns said to her, \"J can't believe \nyou niggers called the police on liS.  You niggers make me sick.  1 just want your nigger \nasses out or my house,\" or words to that effect. \n23.  The Cairns refused to come to the property that night to let Ms. Duncan and her children \nback into the house.  Ms. Duncan anempted to reach them by telephone the next day, \nAugust 5, 2007, but Defendants did not answer the phone or return her phone messages. \n24.  On August 6, 2007, Mrs. Cairns met Ms. Duncan at the property and gave her the keys \nin exchange for the previously-negotiated rental payment and security deposit, the \nsame amount of money Mr. Brown had tendered two days earlier.  The two women \nalso entered into a written agreement that day requiring Ms. Duncan to pay the balance of \nthe monies owed in two installments, on August 11 and August 25, 2007. \n25.  On or about August 6, 2007, Ms. Duncan telephoned her Section 8 counselor to inform \nher of the Cairns' actions.  Her counselor told her that THA would not complete the work \n5 \n\nCase 8:11-cv-00100-RAL-TGW   Document 1    Filed 01/14/11   Page 6 of 8 PageID 6\nnecessary for THA to contribute to Ms. Duncan's rental paymems because the counselor \nhad received an irate call from Mr. Cairns saying he wanted Ms. Duncan out of his home. \n26.  Accordingly, Ms. Duncan and her children moved out of the properly on September 2, \n2007. \nnUl) Administrative Process \n27.  On or abollt December 6, 2007, Complainants filed a complaint with the United States \nDepartment of I-lousing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), alleging that Defendants \nviolated the Fair Housing Act by discriminating in the rental of the subject property \nbecause of race or color. \n28.  In accordance with 42 U.S.c. §§ 3610(a) and (b), the Secretary of HUD conducted and \ncompleted an investigation of the complaint, attempted conciliation without success, and \nprepared a final investigative report.  Based on the information gathered in this \ninvestigation, the Secretary, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3610(g), determined that reasonable \ncause existed to believe that illegal discriminatory housing practices had occurred. \nTherefore, on or about September 30, 20 I 0, the Secretary issued a charge of \ndiscrimination pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 361 O(g), charging the Defendants with engaging \nin discriminatory practices on the basis of race or color in violation of the Fair Housing \nAct, 42 §§ 3604(a) and. 3604(c), and 3617. \n29.  On October 25, 20 I 0, Ms. Duncan and her children elected to have the claims asserted in \nHUD's charge resolved in a civil action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3612(a). \n30.  On October 26, 20 I 0, the Administrative Law Judge issued a Notice of Election and \ntenninated the administrative proceeding on the I-IUD complaint. \n6 \n\nCase 8:11-cv-00100-RAL-TGW   Document 1    Filed 01/14/11   Page 7 of 8 PageID 7\n31.
