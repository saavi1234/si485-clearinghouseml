The DOJ alleged that testing completed by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center revealed that the defendants had engaged in a pattern and practice of rental discrimination on the basis of race or color. Specifically, the complaint alleged that defendants refused to return phone calls from prospective renters who were African-American, but did return phone calls from prospective white renters, and otherwise made units unavailable to persons of color. The U.S. sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief as well as civil penalties.</p><p>Settlement negotiations preceded the lawsuit, and the parties filed a proposed settlement concurrently with the complaint.  On September 02, 2011, the Court (Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt) approved that four-year Consent Order.  The decree covered all properties in which the defendants have any ownership or management interest; in addition to generally prohibiting discrimination, it required development and posting of non-discrimination policies, prominent posting of availability of units with the Equal Housing Opportunity slogan, explicit anti-discrimination notices in all advertising, and training of all employees.   The settlement also provided for a system of recordkeeping to insure people of color were not being turned away, and maintenance of a timely updated list of available units.</p><p>Defendants paid $50,000 to the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center and $10,000 as a civil penalty.  The case terminated on September 07, 2011.</p>",

INTRODUCTION \n \n1. \t  This action was filed by the United States to enforce the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq. The United States alleges that Betty Bouchon, the Bouchon \nLimited Family Partnership, and the Sapphire Corporation (collectively “Defendants”) \nhave engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of race or color and/or \na denial of rights to a group of persons that raises an issue of public importance, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3614, in the rental of dwelling units that the Defendants own, \n1 \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02157-KDE-DEK   Docu  m  ent 5    Filed 09/02/11   Page 2 of 27 \n \n \nmanage, and/or operate at 4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.  This agreement is \nentered into among the United States and the Defendants, Betty Bouchon, the Bouchon \nLimited Family Partnership, and the Sapphire Corporation. \n2.\t   The United States alleges that Defendants have refused to negotiate for the rental of, or \notherwise made unavailable or denied housing to persons because of race or color, in \nviolation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a); discriminated against persons in the terms, conditions \nor privileges of rental, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection \ntherewith, because of race or color, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b); (c) made \nstatements that expressed explicitly an intent to discriminate in the rental of dwellings  \non the basis of race or color; and (d) discriminated by representing to persons because of \nrace or color that dwellings were not available for inspection or rent when such \ndwellings were in fact so available, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604(d).   \n3. \t  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345 and \n  42 U.S.C. § 3614.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) as the claims alleged \n  herein arose in the Eastern District of Louisiana. \n4. \t  The Bouchon Limited Family Partnership owns a sixteen-unit apartment building located \n  at 4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.  The Bouchon Limited Family Partnership \n  offers apartments in that building for rent.  Those apartments are dwellings within the \n  meaning of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). \n5. \t  Defendant Bouchon Limited Family Partnership is a Louisiana partnership with its \n  principal place of business in Metairie, Louisiana. \n2  \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02157-KDE-DEK   Docu  m  ent 5    Filed 09/02/11   Page 3 of 27 \n \n \n6.\t   Defendant Sapphire Corporation is a Louisiana corporation with its principal place of  \n  business in Metairie, Louisiana.  Defendant Sapphire Corporation is the general partner \n  of the Bouchon Limited Family Partnership. \n7.\t   Defendant Betty Bouchon is a limited partner in the Bouchon Limited Family \n  Partnership, and manages and operates the sixteen-unit apartment building located at \n  4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana on behalf of the Bouchon Limited Family \nPartnership. \n8.\t   Defendant Bouchon Limited Family Partnership has the right to direct and control \n  Defendant Betty Bouchon’s actions as manager and operator of the apartment building \n  located at 4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. \n9.\t   While acting with the actual or apparent authority of the Bouchon Limited Family \n  Partnership, Betty Bouchon showed and offered for rent apartments located in the \n  sixteen-unit apartment building located at 4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana. \n10.\t   The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center conducted a series of tests in \n  September 2009 to evaluate the Defendants’ compliance with the Fair Housing Act.  \n  Testing is the simulation of a housing transaction that compares responses given by \n  housing providers to different types of home-seekers to determine whether illegal \n  discrimination is occurring.  The testing undertaken by the Greater New Orleans Fair \n  Housing Action Center revealed that Defendant Betty Bouchon engaged in \n  housing practices that discriminate on the basis of race or color at the sixteen-unit \n  apartment building located at 4919 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana.  \n3  \n \n\nCase 2:11-cv-02157-KDE-DEK   Docu  m  ent 5    Filed 09/02/11   Page 4 of 27 \n \n \n11. \t  The testing conducted by the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center \n  revealed that Defendant Betty Bouchon refused to return phone calls from prospective \n  African-American renters, but did return phone calls from prospective white renters.  The \n  testing further revealed that Defendant Betty Bouchon made statements to prospective \n  white renters indicating that she would not rent to African Americans.  The testing further \n  revealed that Betty Bouchon indicated to an African-American prospective tenant that a \n  unit in the sixteen-unit apartment building located at 4919 Canal Street, New \n  Orleans, Louisiana was not available for rent when it was, in fact, available.  \n12. \t  The Defendants deny the allegations in the United States’ Complaint.  \n13. \t  The United States and the Defendants have agreed that to avoid protracted and costly \nlitigation, this lawsuit should be resolved without a trial.  Therefore, the parties consent to \nthe entry of this Consent Order, as shown by the signatures below. \nACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ADJUDGED, ORDERED and ORDERD: \nII.
