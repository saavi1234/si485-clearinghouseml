    "summary": "On July 17, 2008, the United State filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District Court of Alabama under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3619, against Defendants, rental property owners and their property manager.  The U.S. Department of Justice alleged the Defendants discriminated in their rental business against women. Specifically, DOJ claimed that beginning in 2005 or earlier, the defendants' property manager subjected actual and prospective female tenants to unwanted verbal sexual advances, unwanted sexual touching, and adverse action when they refused or objected to his sexual advances. (For example, he would, the DOJ claimed, send false notices of rent owed to tenants who spurned his advances.)  The complaint sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief and an assessment of civil penalties.The property manager's request for a stay due to a pending bankruptcy was denied (after the bankruptcy was dismissed), and he eventually sought summary judgment.  The court denied that motion on November 23, 2009.  Additional litigation led to a motion for summary judgment by another individual defendant, which was largely denied on September 9, 2010.  (The court did note that this individual would not be held vicariously liable for any punitive damages related to the property manager.)  Considerable discovery and other disputes followed, and the case was eventually set for trial on May 23, 2011.  In the meantime, however, the property manager whose conduct was at the center of the case had died.  Between May 12, 2011, and July 20, 2011, the Court (Judge Mark E. Fuller) approved separate five-year Consent Decrees agreed to by the Plaintiff and the various Defendants. The decrees generally enjoined the Defendants from discriminating in their housing rental practices on the basis of sex, and required them to pay monetary damages into a fund established for the persons aggrieved by their conduct and civil penalties. Each of the Consent Decrees required non-discrimination in advertising, rental showing, employee EEO training, reporting and recordkeeping. On August 16, 2011, the Court entered a default judgment against the remaining defendants, after an extensive evidentiary hearing on damages and civil penalties.  But after that hearing, the chief remaining defendant -- the owner of two apartment buildings -- sought relief from its default judgment of $27,000.  This the Court denied, finally closing out the case, on April 19, 2012.",

    "summary_short": "On July 17, 2008, the United State filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District Court of Alabama under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§3601-3619, against Defendants, numerous rental property owners and their shared property manager.  DOJ claimed that beginning in 2005 or earlier, the defendants' property manager subjected actual and prospective female tenants to unwanted verbal sexual advances, unwanted sexual touching, and adverse action when they refused or objected to his sexual advances. (For example, he would, the DOJ claimed, send false notices of rent owed to tenants who spurned his advances.)  The complaint sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief and an assessment of civil penalties.\r\n\r\nAfter the property manager died, the case settled against most of the defendants, who agreed to pay damages and to entry of injunctive relef forbidding discrimination going forward.   One defendant did not settle, and declined to participate further; DOJ won entry of a default judgment of $27,000 against that defendant.  Afterwards, however, that defendant sought relief from the default, which the Court denied, finally closing out the case, in April 2012.",

INTRODUCTION\nThis cause comes before the Court on four motions—two filed by Defendant\nMatthew Bahr and two filed by the United States. Bahr’s first motion is a Motion to\nAlter, Amend or Vacate Final Judgment Or, in the Alternative, Motion for Relief from\nFinal Judgment. (Doc. # 427.) His second is a Motion to Stay Execution Pending\nDisposition of Motion to Alter, Amend, or Vacate. (Doc. # 443.) The United States’ first\nmotion is a Motion to Supplement the Record (Doc. # 433) and the second is a Motion to\nSeal (Doc. # 436). For the reasons discussed below, both of Bahr’s motions are due to be\ndenied whereas both of the United States’ motions are due to be granted.\nII. BACKGROUND\nThe Court need not recount all of the facts underlying this case. Many of these\nfacts are discussed elsewhere, for example in the Court’s Memorandum Opinion and\n1\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 2 of 10\nOrder on defendant Lori Williams’s motion for summary judgment. (Doc. # 197.) The\nCourt will assume the parties’ familiarity with those opinions for the sake of brevity. In\nshort, this case involves a pattern and practice of sex discrimination by Jamarlo\nGumbaytay, a property manager employed by a number of property owners. This led to\nthe United States bringing suit under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601, against\nGumbaytay and the various property owners.\nImportant here is that defendant Matthew Bahr—one of the property owners who\nemployed Gumbaytay—chose not to participate in the underlying lawsuit.1 Due to this\ndecision, the United States moved to have default judgment entered against Bahr. The\nCourt granted the motion after conducting an evidentiary hearing. (See Docs. # 418,\n419.) The final judgment against Bahr included civil penalties of $10,000 and damages\nof $17,000 to be distributed to the victims—$4500 to Loretta Hull; $5,000 to Rita Julian;\n$2,500 to Calandra Wright; and $5,000 to Britney Knight. (Doc. # 419.)\nBahr has since moved the Court to vacate the final judgment or to at least fix\nvarious errors that he claims the judgment contains. The basis for this motion is as\nfollows. The third amended complaint alleged that Bahr employed Gumbaytay as his\nagent to manage two of his properties: one located at 3661 Whiting Avenue,\nMontgomery, Alabama 36105; the other at 964 North Gap Loop, Montgomery, Alabama\n36110. (Doc. # 168 at ¶ 6.) Yet the United States never offered testimony during the\n1 Bahr made this decision despite having knowledge of the suit and being served with the\ncomplaint. His wife even appeared to defend against the claims brought against her.\n2\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 3 of 10\nevidentiary hearing related to these properties, instead focusing on testimony from\nvictims of other Bahr-owned and Gumbaytay-managed residences. This evidence\nincluded: Calandra Wright’s testimony that she lived at 817 North Pass Road; Loretta\nHull’s testimony that she lived at 609 Boyce and 2233 E. 4th Street; Rita Julian’s\ntestimony that she lived at 105 Stuart St. and 649 Cramer Ave.; and Britney Knight’s\ntestimony that she lived at 105 Stuart St. Bahr has now asserted various arguments about\nwhy these discrepancies call for post-judgment relief.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nA. Bahr’s motion to alter, amend, or vacate the final judgment against him\nBahr asks the Court to do three things in his Motion to Alter, Amend, or Vacate.\nFirst, he wants vacated this Court’s judgment ordering damages against him. (Doc. # 427\nat 10.) Second, he seeks a downward revision as to the damages awarded against him\nbecause, he claims, the statute of limitations bars some of the United States’ claims. (Id.\nat 10.) Third, he wants a ruling that the Court’s final judgment is “void” for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction. (Id. at 12.) The Court will address each argument in turn.\n1. Bahr’s attempt at voiding the judgment against him\nBahr primarily wants the Court to revisit and then vacate the judgment entered\nagainst him. To this end, Bahr argues that, while the United States proved sex\ndiscrimination as to some properties he owned, it did not prove its case as to the\nproperties listed in the amended complaint. Bahr contends that the Court must fix this\n3\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 4 of 10\ndiscrepancy and that “Rule 59 is the proper mechanism for . . . relief.” (Doc. # 441 at 1.)\nBut this is incorrect: the “exclusive . . . method for attacking a default judgment in the\ndistrict court is by way of a Rule 60(b) motion.” Gulf Coast Fans, Inc. v. Midwest Elec.\nImporters, Inc., 740 F.2d 1499, 1507 (11th Cir. 1984). \nThis leaves Bahr with Rule 60(b) as the only procedural mechanism for relief.\nUnder Rule 60(b), “the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment” for one of\nfive specific reasons or for “any other reason that justifies relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n60(b)(1)–(6). Here, Bahr cannot meet any of the first five reasons for granting relief from\nthe default judgment entered against him. So he can seek relief only through the “any\nother reason” catchall contained in Rule 60(b)(6). “[R]elief under this clause is an\nextraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional\ncircumstances.” Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., 996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(quotations omitted).\nBahr can make no such showing. He made a conscious decision to ignore the\nlawsuit filed against him. That he dislikes the negative consequences tied to this decision\ndoes not make his circumstances exceptional. See, e.g., Ackermann v. United States, 340\nU.S. 193, 198 (1950) (“His choice was a risk, but calculated and deliberate and such as\nfollows a free choice. Petitioner cannot be relieved of such a choice because hindsight\nseems to indicate to him that his decision not to appeal was probably wrong . . .”);\nAghassi v. Holden & Co., 92 F.R.D. 98, 100 (D. Mass. 1981) (“The consequences of\n4\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 5 of 10\nneglectfulness on the plaintiff’s part will not ordinarily constitute the kind of extreme\nhardship contemplated by Rule 60(b)(6)”). Bahr’s main argument—that the damages\nawarded to four of his tenants should be vacated because the amended complaint did not\nidentify the tenant’s addresses specifically—is an objection appropriately raised during\nadversarial proceedings. His failure to do so does not justify granting relief. Cf. Dowell v.\nState Farm Fire and Cas. Auto. Ins., 774 F. Supp. 996, 1001 (S.D. W. Va. 1991) (“we do\nnot find extreme hardship that would compel granting relief inasmuch as the Plaintiff\nknowingly and voluntarily passed over the means to protect his interest in litigation and\npossibly achieve his desired outcome.”).\nIt is also unclear whether the technicality related to the tenant’s addresses is even\nrelevant. A party can move at the end of trial to amend the pleadings to conform with the\nevidence presented during the proceeding; this allows federal courts to avoid the problem\nBahr now complains of. Borden, Inc. v. Fla. E. Coast Ry. Co., 772 F.2d 750, 758 (11th\nCir. 1985). In fact, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “permit[] amendments to the\npleadings even after judgment if the issues involved are tried by the express or implied\nconsent of the parties.” Diaz v. Jaguar Restaurant Group, LLC, 627 F.3d 1212, 1214\n(11th Cir. 2010) (emphasis added) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)). Since Bahr did not\ndeign to appear in the case, he gave implicit consent to the United States to prove the\nclaims that it did. “The fact that no formal amendment of the pleadings took place is of\nno consequence.” Proctor v. Gissendaner, 579 F.2d 876, 885 n.20 (5th Cir. 1978).\n5\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 6 of 10\nAt bottom, “[t]here must be an end to litigation someday, and free, calculated,\ndeliberate choices are not to be relieved from.” Ackermann, 340 U.S. at 211–12. Bahr\nhad an opportunity to defend himself and chose not to. It would serve neither equity nor\nefficiency to open the floodgates now to a new round of motions and hearings in this\ncase due to a technicality related to the specifics of the pleadings. This is especially true\nseeing how Bahr, had he showed up to defend himself, could have pointed out this defect\nthen. Bahr’s motion is therefore due to be denied on the first ground he raises.\n2. Bahr’s statute of limitations argument\nBahr next asserts that “all damages based on events that occurred before July 28,\n2006[,] are barred by the statute of limitations.” (Doc. # 427.) From there, he appears to\nargue that the Court should reduce the plaintiffs’ damages accordingly. This argument is\nmeritless. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that a defendant waives by\nfailing to plead it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1); Day v. Liberty Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 122 F.3d\n1012, 1015 (11th Cir. 1997) (citing cases holding “failure to plead the bar of the statute\nof limitations constitutes a waiver of the [statute of limitations] defense”). Besides, as\ndiscussed above, both Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b) are unavailable to Bahr, so he has no\nprocedural means to bring this argument properly before the Court. His motion is due to\nbe denied on this ground too.\n3. Bahr’s arguments centered on subject-matter jurisdiction\nBahr lastly seeks relief under Rule 60(b)(4), which allows a court to relieve a\n6\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 7 of 10\nparty from a final judgment where “the judgment is void.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4). The\nCourt never had subject-matter jurisdiction, Bahr claims, because the United States “did\nnot establish a pattern or practice of discrimination at [his] properties.” (Doc. # 427 at\n12.) This, however, is not the test for assessing the Court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.\nThe relevant statute, 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a), confers standing on the Attorney\nGeneral to bring suit in certain circumstances. One of which is where the Attorney\nGeneral “has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged\nin a pattern or practice of” violating the Fair Housing Act. 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a); United\nStates v. Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., 474 F.2d 115, 122–23 (5th Cir. 1973).2 For\njurisdictional purposes, the statute does not require actual proof of the pattern or practice\nof discrimination; the Attorney General need only “reasonable cause” to believe that it\noccurred. See United States v. Pelzer Realty Co., Inc., 484 F.2d 438, 444 (5th Cir. 1973).\nA number of allegations in the third amended complaint support the Attorney\nGeneral’s reasonable-cause determination. For example, the United States alleged that\nGumbaytay managed two properties owned by Bahr (Doc. # 168 at ¶ 5); that Bahr\nemployed Gumbaytay as his agent to manage those properties (id. at ¶¶ 6–20); that\nGumbaytay subjected female tenants to sexual harassment there (id. at ¶ 23); that Bahr\nknew or should have known of this harassment (id. at ¶ 24); and that Bahr owned other\n2 In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh\nCircuit adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down before the close of business\non September 30, 1981.\n7\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 8 of 10\ndwellings in which he employed Gumbaytay and in which Gumbaytay engaged in similar\ndiscriminatory conduct (id. at ¶ 29). Because Bahr defaulted, he admitted all of these\nallegations. Nishmatsu Const. Co. v. Houston Nat’l Bank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.\n1975) (“defendant, by his default, admits the plaintiff’s well-pleaded allegations of\nfact”). These facts, taken as true, establish that the Attorney General had reasonable\ncause to believe a pattern or practice of sex discrimination took place.\nFurthermore, the Court has already addressed whether the Attorney General had\nreasonable cause to bring the action, and in doing so, found that he did. (See Doc. # 197\nat 10.) Bahr’s arguments, as the United States points out, relate to whether particular\nvictims should have received a damages award after an evidentiary hearing. This has\nnothing to do with whether the United States had the ability to bring the action initially.\nAccordingly, because the Attorney General satisfied the statutory standard, Bahr’s Rule\n60(b)(4) motion is due to be denied.\nB. The United States’ motion to supplement\nAfter Bahr filed his motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment entered against\nhim, the United States moved to supplement the record. The newly provided evidence\nwould further support the damages award against Bahr. Specifically, the evidence\nprovides more proof that Bahr owned the properties at issue, employed Gumbaytay to\nmanage them, and harmed the victims awarded damages by the Court. Bahr of course\ndisputes the propriety of granting the United States’ motion.\n8\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 9 of 10\nA defendant’s decision to ignore a lawsuit against him prejudices not only himself\nbut also his opponent by depriving the adverse party of the ability to obtain important\nevidence. See Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 187 (1st Cir.\n2004). Allowing the absentee defendant to then come along and nitpick the sufficiency\nof the evidence supporting the judgment against him would turn the litigation process on\nits head. Indeed, “[i]t would usher in a new era in the dynamics of litigation if a party\ncould suffer a default judgment to be entered against it and then go about its business as\nif the slate was wiped clean and a new day had dawned.” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.\nHughes, 449 F.2d 51, 63–64 (2d Cir. 1971), rev’d on other grounds, 409 U.S. 363\n(1973). Thus the Eleventh Circuit allows district courts to create a record after default to\nsupport “whatever award of damages it deems appropriate.” Adolph Coors Co. v.\nMovement Against Racism and the Klan, 777 F.2d 1538, 1544 (11th Cir. 1985).\nHere, the Court sees no reason to revisit its damages award against Bahr. The\nevidence adduced at the damages hearing, standing alone, supports the judgment. Yet,\nout of an abundance of caution, the Court has reviewed the newly submitted evidence\nfiled by the United States. This evidence shows that Wright, Cates, Julian, and Knight\nlived in Bahr-owned properties that Gumbaytay managed on his behalf. Because it does,\nand since Bahr’s absence deprived the United States of the opportunity to obtain\nevidence from him, the motion to admit the supplemental evidence is due to be granted.\nAnd because this evidence contains personal information, the United States’ motion to\n9\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 446    Filed 04/19/12   Page 10 of 10\nseal is likewise due to be granted.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nAfter having fully considered the parties’ arguments, and for the reasons discussed\nabove, it is hereby ORDERED as follows:\n1. Bahr’s Motion to Alter, Amend or Vacate Final Judgment (Doc. # 427) is\nDENIED.\n2. Bahr’s Motion to Stay Execution Pending Disposition (Doc. # 443) is\nDENIED AS MOOT.\n3. The United States’ Motion to Supplement the Record (Doc. # 433) is\nGRANTED.\n4. The United States’ Motion to Seal (Doc. # 436) is GRANTED.\nth\nDONE this the 19  day of April, 2012.\n              /s/ Mark E. Fuller                      \n     UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n10",

Accordingly, it is hereby\nORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:\nI. SCOPE OF CONSENT DECREE\n1. The provisions of this Consent Decree shall apply to Abraham Campbell and his\nemployees, agents, assigns, successors-in-interest, and all persons in active concert or\nparticipation with him.\n2. This Consent Decree constitutes a full and final resolution of all claims of violation of the\nFair Housing Act that the United States brought or could have brought in this action related to\nDefendant Campbell's ownership andlor management of real property in Montgomery, AL.\nII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n3. This action was filed by the United States to enforce the provisions of Title VIII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1968 (the Fair Housing Act), as amended by the Fair Housing Act\nAmendments of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq. The United States alleges that Defendant\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF -SRW   Document 411    Filed 07/20/11   Page 2 of 16 \nJamarlo K. Gumbaytay, aka Laurence Lamar dlb/a Elite Enterprises Consultant Group (hereinafter\n\"Gumbaytay\") engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the Fair Housing Act\nin connection with rental dwelling units he managed on behalf of Defendants Matthew Bahr, Brett\nRosenbaum, Lori Williams, Sean McDonough, Woody D. Franklin, Sr., James F. Clark, Barbara\nClark, Millennia Properties, LLC, Abraham Campbell, Guest Properties, LLC, Jewel Manahan,\nTodd Chamelin, Terrill Jorgensen, and Bruce Dunn (hereinafter \"the owner Defendants\") in and\naround Montgomery, Alabama. Specifically, the United States alleges that Defendant\nGumbaytay, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (a), (b), (c) and 3617, subjected female tenants and\nprospective tenants to discrimination on the basis of sex, including severe, pervasive, and\nunwelcome sexual harassment. Such conduct is alleged to have included, but is not limited to,\nunwanted verbal sexual advances; unwanted sexual intercourse and sexual touching; entering the\napartments of female tenants without permission or notice; granting and denying tangible housing\nbenefits based on sex; and taking adverse action against female tenants when they refused or\nobjected to sexual advances.\n4. The United States further alleges that the owner Defendants, including Defendant\nCampbell, are vicariously liable for the above-described discriminatory conduct because\nDefendant Gumbaytay engaged in such acts while acting within the scope of his employment\nand/or agency with the owner Defendants.\n5. Defendant Campbell represents that he currently owns no residential real property outside\nof his primary residence.\n6. The United States alleges that the Defendant's conduct constituted a pattern or practice of\ndiscrimination and/or a denial of rights to a group of persons that raises an issue of general public\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF -SRW   Document 411    Filed 07/20/11   Page 3 of 16 \nimportance. See 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a).\n7. To avoid the risks and burdens of litigation and without admitting liability or any of the\nallegations, Defendant Campbell has entered into this Decree to resolve voluntarily the claims\nasserted by the United States.\nIII.

The\nexpiration of the Consent Decree shall not extinguish or otherwise affect Defendant's debt for any\nunpaid portion of the monetary judgments in paragraphs 14, 18 or 25, including any accrued\ninterest. Nor shall the expiration of the Consent Decree extinguish or otherwise affect the United\nStates' ability to collect such unpaid sums.\nXII. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES\n25.\t If Defendant fails to make any payment within the time or in the amount set forth in\nparagraph 14, fails to pay the civil penalty within the time or in the amount set forth in paragraph\n18, or fails to pay the interest within the time or in the amount set forth in paragraphs 17 or 21 a\njudgment shall be entered immediately, without further notice or hearing, against Defendant in the\naggregate amount of the following:\na.the outstanding balance owed under the terms of paragraphs 14, 17, 18 and 21 of this\nOrder; and\nb.

This policy means, among other things, that Abraham Campbell, as well as all his\nagents or employees with the responsibility for renting, managing or administering any dwelling\nunits must not discriminate on the basis of sex or otherwise engage in sexual harassment in any\naspect of the rental of dwellings to qualified applicants or tenants. Such agents and employees\nmust refrain from-\na. Denying or otherwise making unavailable housing to any person because of sex;\nb. Discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions or privileges of renting a\ndwelling unit, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,\nbecause of sex;\nc. Making statements with respect to the rental of a dwelling unit that states any\npreference, limitation or discrimination based on sex; or\nd. Coercing, intimidating, threatening or interfering with any person in the exercise or\nenjoyment of, or on account of her having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of her\nhaving aided and encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any\nright granted by the Fair Housing Act.\nAny action taken by an agent or employee that results in unequal service, treatment or\nbehavior to tenants on the basis of sex may constitute a violation of state and federal fair housing\nlaws. Any tenant who believes that any of the above policies has been violated by any owner,\nagent or employee may contact the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development at\n1-800-669-9777, the Central Alabama Fair Housing Center at 334-263-HOME or the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice at 1-800-896-7743 or 202-514-4713.\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF -SRW   Document 411    Filed 07/20/11   Page 15 of 16 \nAPPENDIX B\nEmployee/Agent Acknowledgment of Receiving and Reviewing Decree\nand Nondiscrimination Policy and Procedures\nI have received a copy of the Consent Decree entered in United States v.

      "text": "Case 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 1 of 20\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF ALABAMA \nNORTHERN DIVISION \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,      ) \n) \nPLAINTIFF,          ) \n) \nv.              )  CASE NO. 2:08-CV-00573-MEF-SRW \n)   \nMATTHEW BAHR, et al.,         ) \n) \nDEFENDANTS.        ) \n              )   \n \nUNITED STATES’ RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT MATTHEW BAHR’S MOTION TO \nALTER, AMEND OR VACATE FINAL JUDGMENT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, \nMOTION FOR RELIEF FROM FINAL JUDGMENT  \n \nDefendant Bahr makes three requests: (1) that the Court revise its damages downward \ndue to alleged statute of limitations concerns (Bahr Motion at 9-10); (2) that the Court declare its \n―Final Judgment [] void‖ due to an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction (id. at 12), and; (3) \nthat the Court vacate its order of damages and civil penalties against him due to an alleged lack \nof evidence (id. at 6-9).  For the reasons stated below, the Court‘s original judgment should stand \nand Bahr‘s requests should be denied.  Alternatively, if the Court chooses to grant Defendant‘s \nmotion, the Court should affirm its award of injunctive and monetary relief based on the \nadditional evidence offered below. \nARGUMENT \nAs a threshold matter, Bahr cites Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 60(b)(4) and 60(b)(6) as the bases \nfor his motion but cites no case law suggesting that Rule 59(e) is the appropriate vehicle for \nvacating either a default judgment or a default damages award and, the United States has not \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 2 of 20\nfound any reported cases in the 11th Circuit.  Since Bahr‘s requests for vacatur are effectively \nrequests for relief from the default judgment, they should be construed as arising only under Rule \n60(b).  See Vesligaj v. Peterson, 331 F. App‘x. 351, 354 (6th Cir. 2009) (treating a Rule 59(e) \nmotion contesting both a default judgment and default damages award as ―seeking relief under \nRule 60(b).‖); Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records, 370 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir. 2004) (―It is \nby no means clear that a Rule 59(e) motion is even a valid mechanism for altering or amending a \ndefault judgment.‖).  If Rule 59(e) is available at all, it should only apply to Bahr‘s request that \nthe Court revise its damages award based on the statute of limitations.  Cf. Day v. Liberty Nat. \nLife Ins. Co., 122 F.3d 1012 (11th Cir. 1997) (discussing Rule 59(e) and statute of limitations \ndefense). \nA.  The Court’s Damages Award Should Stand Because Bahr has Failed to Present a \nValid Statute of Limitations Defense. \n \nBahr claims that ―all damages based on events that occurred before July 28, 2006 are \nbarred by the statute of limitations‖ under 42 U.S.C. § 3613 and are due to be reduced, ostensibly \nunder Rule 59(e).  Bahr Motion at 10.  In this Circuit, ―[t]he only grounds for granting [a Rule \n59] motion are newly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.‖ Arthur v. King, 500 \nF.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (alteration in original) (quotation omitted).  \nAlthough litigants ―cannot use a Rule 59(e) motion to relitigate old matters, raise argument or \npresent evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment‖ Bahr is raising his \nstatute of limitations argument for the first time now.  Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of \nWellington, 408 F.3d 757, 762 (11th Cir. 2005).  But according to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1), a \ndefendant ―must affirmatively state any . . . affirmative defense, including. . . . statute of \nlimitations.‖  Since Bahr did not so plead, he has waived this defense.   See Day v. Liberty Nat. \n  - 2 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 3 of 20\nLife Ins. Co., 122 F.3d 1012 (11th Cir. 1997) (―This court has held in a number of discrimination \nactions that failure to plead the bar of the statute of limitations constitutes a waiver of the \ndefense‖) (citing cases).  This holding applies with particular force when the argument is raised \nfor the first time after final judgment.  Id. at 1015. \nWhile it is true, as Bahr notes, that aggrieved persons are ordinarily granted two years to \ncommence their own actions under § 3613, Bahr Motion at 9-10, that fact is irrelevant because \nthis suit arose under 42 U.S.C. § 3614.  See Dkt. 1 – Complaint at ¶ 2; U.S. v. Tanski, No. 1:04-\nCV-714, 2007 WL 1017020 * 9 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2007) (―section 3613(a)(1)(A) [] governs \nonly lawsuits commenced by aggrieved persons.  It does not govern a section 3614(a) claim, . . . \n[which] allow[s] the Attorney General to recover compensatory damages on behalf of a victim \n. . , even where the victim is time-barred from recovering compensatory damages.‖); Garcia v. \nBrockway, 526 F.3d 456, 477 n.11 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc) (―[N]o matter how the FHA‘s \nstatute of limitations for private suits is interpreted, [defendants] may still in some instances be \nsubject to suits brought by the Department of Justice under its ‗pattern or practice‘ authority.‖) \n(citing 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a)).  \nThe limitation period for claims for monetary damages brought by the United States \npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a)—the period that applies here—is three years from the date on \nwhich the cause of action accrues, in this case, when the Attorney General has knowledge of a \nviolation of the Act.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2415(b).  Because the United States filed its suit in July of \n2008, and because the harms suffered by the aggrieved person all occurred well after July 2005, \nthere can be no legitimate question that the United States may seek damages for those \nindividuals here. \n  - 3 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 4 of 20\nA section 3614(a) pattern-or-practice claim is not an agglomeration of smaller claims in \nthe way that a class action or a multi-plaintiff case is.  Instead, it is a single claim, with one \nplaintiff, alleging a range of incidents over a period of time. See United States v. Veal, 365 F. \nSupp. 2d 1034, 1040 n.3 (―[T]here is only one plaintiff in this case—the United States of \nAmerica. It is therefore appropriate to view the punitive and compensatory damages \ncollectively.‖).  To establish liability in a pattern or practice case the Government must show that \nthe defendant engaged in a regular policy or practice of unlawful discrimination, i.e., ―that such a \npolicy existed,‖ not that each victim ―for whom it will ultimately seek relief was a victim of the \n. . . discriminatory policy.‖  United States v. Indigo Invs., LLC, No. 1:09CV376, 2010 WL \n4718897, at *3 (S.D. Miss. Nov. 15, 2010) (quoting Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 360; FHA case \nrejecting argument that at liability stage government had to prove a prima facie case of \ndiscrimination as to each individual aggrieved person).  Once liability is established – i.e., that \nthere was a pattern or practice – the determination is made of the appropriate damages or other \nrelief for each aggrieved party.   \nAs such, this Court‘s consideration of harms suffered by the victims of Gumbaytay‘s \nharassment before July of 2006 constituted no error of law or fact so long as the United States \nalleged a pattern or practice of discrimination before that date, which it did, both in its complaint \nand through the testimony of the victims at the evidentiary hearing.  Dkt. 1. ¶¶ 16-17 (―From at \nleast 2005 through the present, Defendant Gumbaytay has been subjecting actual and prospective \nfemale tenants of the subject properties to discrimination on the basis of sex, including severe, \npervasive, and unwelcome sexual harassment. . . . The owner Defendants [] are liable for the \ndiscriminatory conduct of their agent and manager, Defendant Gumbaytay‖); id. ¶ 19 (―The \n  - 4 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 5 of 20\nDefendants‘ conduct [] constitutes: [] A pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of \nrights granted by the Fair Housing Act.‖). \nB.  The Court’s Judgment Should Stand Because the United States has Satisfied all \nRequirements for Subject Matter Jurisdiction. \n \ni.  The United States has established “pattern or practice” jurisdiction. \nBahr seeks relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b)(4) because the United States \nallegedly ―did not establish a pattern or practice of discrimination at Bahr‘s properties‖ as a \npredicate for the Court‘s subject matter jurisdiction.  Bahr Motion at 12.  Rule 60(b)(4) provides \nthat a court may relieve a party from a final judgment or order only where ―the judgment is void‖ \nas a matter of law.  See American Bankers Ins. Co. v. Northwestern Nat’l Ins. Co., 198 F.3d \n1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999) ―[u]nlike motions pursuant to other subsections of Rule 60(b), Rule \n60(b)(4) motions leave no margin for consideration of the district court‘s discretion as the \njudgments themselves are by definition either legal nullities or not.‖).  As a threshold matter, \nBahr misstates the relevant legal test.  As this Court has recognized, the precise question is \nwhether the United States has ―reasonable cause to believe that [] there is an ‗individual‘ or \n‗group‘ pattern or practice violative of the Fair Housing Act.‖  Dkt. 197 at 7 (Summary \nJudgment Order of 9/1/10) (emphasis added).  Not only does the United States‘ complaint meet \nthis test, but also this Court found ―reasonable cause to believe [that] group action exists‖ and \nthat the United States ―easily satisfied its burden of producing evidence . . . about whether the \ngroup of defendants ‗engaged in a pattern or practice of [discrimination].‘‖  Id. at 10.  Thus, the \nlegal question of jurisdiction has already been considered and resolved by the Court and cannot \nbe revisited by Bahr, especially not after default.  Gonzalez v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, \n366 F.3d 1253, 1295 (11th Cir. 2004) (―Like a motion to reconsider, a motion under Rule 60(b) \n  - 5 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 6 of 20\nis not a second opportunity for the losing party to make its strongest case, to rehash arguments, \nor to dress up arguments that previously failed.‖) (quoting Kustom Signals, Inc. v. Applied \nConcepts, Inc., 247 F. Supp. 2d 1233, 1235 (D. Kan. 2003)). \nBahr relies on language in the Court‘s order leaving the ultimate determination of \nwhether the actions of the owner-defendants in fact constituted a group pattern or practice of \ndiscrimination for trial.  Bahr Motion at 12.  But by the Court‘s own terms, this was a factual \nquestion, which cannot be examined by a Rule 60(b)(4) motion.  But even if the question of \npattern-or-practice jurisdiction were deemed to be a mixed one of law and fact, the allegations in \nthe complaint alone are sufficient to support the Attorney General‘s reasonable-cause \ndetermination regarding discriminatory group action by owner-defendants through a common \nproperty manager and agent in the person of Gumbaytay.  Nishimatsu Const. Co. v. Houston Nat. \nBank, 515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975) (―defendant, by his default, admits the plaintiff‘s well-\npleaded allegations of fact‖). \nThe relevant facts in the complaint include: \n  That Gumbaytay managed at least seventeen properties identified by address, \nincluding two owned by Bahr, and that these properties, in conjunction with \nothers not enumerated by street address, comprised the ―subject properties‖ of the \ncomplaint.  Dkt. 168 ¶ 5 (Third amended complaint). \n  That eighteen owner-defendants, including Bahr, ―employed Defendant \nGumbaytay as [their] agent‖ to manage the subject properties.  Id. ¶¶ 6-20. \n  That ―f[]rom at least 2005 through the present, Defendant Gumbaytay has been \nsubjecting actual and prospective female tenants of the subject properties to \n  - 6 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 7 of 20\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex, including severe, pervasive, and unwelcome \nsexual harassment. Such conduct has included, but is not limited to, unwanted \nverbal sexual advances; unwanted sexual touching; unwanted sexual language; \ngranting and denying tangible housing benefits based on sex; and taking adverse \naction against female tenants when they refused or objected to his sexual \nadvances.‖  Id. ¶ 23. \n  That all the owner-defendants, including Bahr, ―knew or should have known of \nthe discriminatory conduct of Defendant Gumbaytay, yet failed to take reasonable \npreventive or corrective measures.‖  Id. ¶ 24. \n  That all the owner-defendants, including Bahr, ―may own or have owned other \ndwellings, for which they employed Gumbaytay as their manager and agent, \nwhere [discriminatory] conduct similar to that described [above] may have \noccurred.‖  Id. ¶ 29. \nEven if Bahr‘s central allegation—that the victims who testified at the default hearing \ncannot be linked to any property owned by Bahr—were true (and, as shown below, it is not), it is \nirrelevant to the question of subject matter jurisdiction.  The question of whether particular \nvictims should or should not have been awarded damages after an evidentiary hearing is separate \nfrom the question of whether the United States has the authority to bring this action.  Because the \nallegations in the complaint, as shown above, adequately support the Attorney General‘s \nreasonable-cause determination, subject matter jurisdiction is nowhere lacking.   \n  - 7 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 8 of 20\nii.  The United States has established “denial of rights to a group” jurisdiction. \nThe Court has noted that subject matter jurisdiction is also established where there is \nreasonable cause to believe that ―a group of persons has been denied rights granted by the Act \nand that denial raises an issue of general public importance.‖  Dkt. 197 at 10 (citing 42 U.S.C. \n3614(a)).  Since this alternative basis has not been challenged by Bahr and is supported by the \ncomplaint, the Court may find jurisdiction on these grounds as well. \nThe Fair Housing Act permits the Attorney General to sue when there is a denial of rights \nto a group of persons protected by the FHA raising a matter of general public importance. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 3614(a); United States v. City of Parma, 661 F.2d 562, 565 at n.2 (6th Cir. 1981).  \nWhether a fair housing case raises an issue of general public importance within the meaning of \nsection 814(a) is left to the discretion of the Attorney General. See e.g., U.S. v. Bob Lawrence, \n474 F.2d 115, 124-25 & n.14 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Northside Realty Associates, Inc., \n474 F.2d 1164, 1168 (5th Cir. 1973).  As the Fifth Circuit stated in Bob Lawrence: \nJust as the Attorney General has discretion when to exercise the prosecutorial function in \ncriminal cases, so too the Attorney General must have wide discretion to determine when \nan issue of public importance justifying his intervention under [this section] is raised. . . . \nOnce the Attorney General alleged that he had reasonable cause to believe that violation \nof § 3604(e) denied rights to a group of persons and that this denial raised an issue of \ngeneral public importance, he had standing to commence an action in District Court . . . . \n \nBob Lawrence, 474 F.2d at 125 n.14 (citations omitted).  \n \nMoreover, the United States‘ enforcement authority under this provision may be based on \n―a single (unintentional) violation of the Act when by that violation a group of persons are \ndenied their statutory rights.‖  See United States v. Hunter, 459 F.2d 205, 217-18 (4th Cir. 1972).  \nHere, the complaint alleged that Gumbaytay‘s actions as the owner-defendants‘ agent denied \nnumerous ―female tenants‖ rights protected by the FHA.  Dkt 168 ¶¶ 23, 27.  These victims \n  - 8 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 9 of 20\nconstitute an identifiable ―group of persons,‖ whose denial of rights has been deemed by the \nAttorney General to raise an issue of general public importance.  Jurisdiction has, therefore, been \nestablished under 42 U.S.C. 3614(a).  \nC.  The Court’s Judgment Should Stand Because it is Supported by Sufficient Evidence \nAdmitted at the Court’s Evidentiary the Hearing. \n \nAlthough the United States‘ complaint established that Bahr is vicariously liable for \nviolations of the Fair Housing Act stemming from the actions of his agent, Gumbaytay, Bahr \nrequests that the Court vacate its damages award due to an alleged lack of supporting evidence, \nostensibly on the basis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).1  Bahr Motion at 1.  According to the \nEleventh Circuit, ―relief under this clause is an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only \nupon a showing of exceptional circumstances.‖  Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., 996 F.2d 1111, \n1115 (11th Cir. 1993) (quotation omitted).  Reduced to its essentials, Bahr‘s argument is that the \ndamages awarded to four of Bahr‘s victim-tenants should be vacated because the Bahr-owned-\nproperties in which they resided and were harassed were not identified by street address in the \ncomplaint.  Bahr Motion at 5-6.  But this argument, even if true, presents no ―exceptional \ncircumstances‖ warranting a reversal of the Court‘s award as the United States presented \nsufficient evidence in support of the damages at the hearing itself. \nDespite Bahr‘s assertions to the contrary, the testimony of victims Calandra Wright, \nLoretta Hall-Cates, Rita Julian and Britney Knight established both Bahr‘s ownership of the \nproperties in question and Gumbaytay‘s agency on Bahr‘s behalf at the times of harassment. \n                                                 \n1  Although Bahr does not clarify the basis of his argument, it must be presumed to be Rule \n60(b)(6) over Rule 60(b)(4) because the two provisions are mutually exclusive and because Bahr \nargues factual, not legal, deficiencies here.  In re Gledhill, 76 F.3d 1070, 1080-1081 (10th Cir. \n1996) (―Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) may not be premised on one of the specific grounds \nenumerated in Rule 60(b)(1)-(5).‖). \n  - 9 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 10 of 20\nCalandra Wright \n  Q: [W]hen is the next time that you interacted with Gumbaytay?  \nA: After I moved into the home. \nQ: Okay. Now, tell me about the property when you visited it.  What was the property \naddress? \n \nA: 817 North Pass Road. \nWright Dep. Tr. 5:10-15 \nQ:. What kind of power did Gumbaytay have over your housing? \nA: I knew him as being the landlord. \nQ: Did you know who he was a landlord for? \nA: I eventually found out that Matthew Bahr was the owner of the home that I was  \nliving in. \n \nQ: And how did you learn that? \n \nA: Some tax papers or something started coming in the mail to the home. \n \nId. at 16:19-17:1. \nLoretta Hall-Cates \nCourt: You said that you contacted the Montgomery Housing Authority about some \nSection 8 housing, and you were put in contact with Mr. Gumbaytay regarding the 609 \nBoyce Street residence? \n \nA: Yes, sir.

I asked Housing about that, \n and they let me know that he owned that property. . .   \n  \nI believe I submitted a letter either to Mr. Bahr or to Housing pertaining to the things  \nthat were going on, but I never heard anything back. \n \nId. at 29:5-13.2 \n \nRita Julian \n \nA: So I had called Mr. Bahr on the telephone, and I had told Mr. Bahr -- I was like, Mr. \nBahr, I know this is your house, and I know you -- you know, that Mr. Gumbaytay is \nrenting. But if any water damage happens, it‘s not my fault, because I‘ve told him and \nI‘ve called him several times to have someone to come and fix it. \n \nAnd at that point, I was flustrated (phonetic). And I told Mr. Bahr, I said, because Mr. \nGumbaytay is not fixing anything for me, I feel like it‘s because he‘s sexually harassing \nme and I won‘t sleep with him, and I feel like he‘s taking that out on me. So he told me \nthat he will call Mr. Gumbaytay and get him to get somebody over there.  And sure \nenough, happily, again, it got fixed. \n \nQ: So the repair issue was taken care of. What happened with respect to Gumbaytay‘s \nbehavior? \n \nA: Nothing. It just -- he just kept coming on, kept coming on, kept doing the same things, \nadvancing me for sexual favors, still coming to my house late at night, still sending me \neviction notices. Nothing ever changed. \n \nJulian Dep. Tr. 15:7-25. \n \nCourt: Who did you know to be the owner of the property located at 105 Stuart Street?  \n \nA: Matthew Bahr. \n \nId. at 29:23-25. \n \nCourt: Ms. Julian, you said that you moved into the residence at 105 Stuart Street.

Because I moved at the end of 2005, so it had to have \nbeen April of 20, 2007, I think it was. \n \nId. at 27:8-20 \n \nBritney Knight \n \nQ: When did you first hear the name Jamarlo Gumbaytay? \nA: When I moved on Stuart Street. \nQ: What was the address of that? \nA: 105. \nKnight Dep. Tr. 4:15-18. \nQ: How did you know of Jamarlo Gumbaytay? \nA: He was our landlord. \nId. at 5:12-13 \nCourt: On the day that [Gumbaytay] was at your home with his foot in the door when \nyour mother called, you said that was about mid-June of 2007? \n \nA: Yes. \n \nCourt: How long -- how much longer did y‘all live at that house? \n \nA: Probably four months after then. \n \nId. at 17:4-10.3 \n                                                 \n3  Although Ms. Knight did not testify as to the ownership of 105 Stuart St. at the time of her \nharassment in mid-June of 2007 (when she was 15 years old), the ownership testimony of Rita \n  - 12 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 13 of 20\n \nIn sum, Bahr‘s repeated insistence that there was ―no allegation or proof that Gumbaytay \nwas acting as Bahr‘s agent‖ and ―no evidence before the Court that establishes that Bahr \nown[ed]‖ the properties in question, is flatly wrong.  Bahr Motion at 7.  Precisely such evidence \nwas offered by every witness that lived in Bahr‘s properties at the hearing.  Indeed, the Court \nwas offered two binders of supporting documentary evidence at the hearing by the United States, \nbut ruled that it ―did not nede to consider the [] exhibits provided‖ because the testimony alone4 \nwas sufficient to support its judgment.  Dkt. 420.  Because Bahr declined to participate in the \nevidentiary hearing, he has waived his right to challenge the sworn assertions made by the \nvictims as to Bahr‘s ownership of the properties in question and of the fact that Gumbaytay acted \nas Bahr‘s property manager.5  Because the Court found the testimony of Wright, Cates, Julian, \nand Knight to be credible, and because these women testified to all of the ―missing‖ facts in the \nUnited States‘ complaint, Bahr cannot meet his burden and his motion to vacate should be \ndenied.   \nD.  Even if the Court Grants Bahr’s Motion, it Should Affirm its Original Award Based \non Additional Evidence. \n \nIf the Court is inclined to grant Bahr‘s motion, the United States submits that it should \nalter or amend its judgment to incorporate additional evidence into the record and affirm its \noriginal damages awards.  See Adolph Coors Co. v. Movement Against Racism and the Klan, 777 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nJulian provides sufficient evidence to support the inference that Bahr still owned the property at \nthat time of Knight‘s harassment.  See Julian Dep. Tr. 27:8-20 (showing Julian living at 105 \nStuart St. until April 20, 2007); id. at 29:23-25 (showing Bahr‘s ownership). \n4  The only exceptions being the Court‘s consideration of affidavits of two victims who were not \npresent at the hearing.  Dkt. 420. \n5  Although Bahr chose to forego his opportunity to present any evidence to rebut the testimony \nof the victims, it is important to note that his motion never actually states that he did not own the \nproperties at the relevant times or that Gumbaytay was not his property manager. \n  - 13 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 14 of 20\nF.2d 1538, 154 (11th Cir. 1985) (reversing damages award after default and remanding ―so that \nthe trial court may create a record adequate to sustain whatever award of damages it deems \nappropriate.‖).

Additionally, the testimony of all the women is consistent with the evidence regarding the \ndates of Gumbaytay‘s harassment coinciding with the victims‘ dates of occupancy.9  \nIn weighing this evidence, the Court should also consider the fact that, although the \nrecord is sufficient, it will never be complete because Bahr deprived the United States of the \nability to obtain additional relevant documents in discovery and the opportunity to question Bahr \ndirectly on these matters under oath.  Although the United States must (and did) substantiate its \ndamages claims, its burden of proof should be lighter than it would otherwise be by virtue of \nBahr choosing default over meaningful participation in this suit.  Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. \nHughes, 449 F.2d 51, 63-64 (2d Cir. 1971) rev’d on other grounds, 409 U.S. 363 (1973) (―It \nwould usher in a new era in the dynamics of litigation if a party could suffer a default judgment \nto be entered against it and then go about its business as if the slate was wiped clean and a new \n                                                 \n9  The fact that Ms. Knight testified to being harassed in mid-June 2007 and that her mother‘s \nlease was effective August 1, 2007, presents no contradiction.  See Ex. 61.  The evidence shows \nthat the previous tenant-victim, Ms. Julian, vacated 105 Stuart St. in April of 2007 and that \nKnight‘s mother requested that her Sec. 8 voucher be applied to the Stuart St. address that same \nmonth.  See Julian Dep. Tr. 27:8-20; Ex. 59.  This is consistent with Ms. Knight‘s testimony that \nthe family was already living at the property when she experienced harassment in mid-June \n2007.  Whether the Knight family lived under an annual lease, month-to-month, or under some \nother arrangement at the time is irrelevant. \n  - 16 - \n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 432   Filed 09/30/11   Page 17 of 20\nday had dawned.

GUMBAYTAY, et al.,        ) (WO)\n      )\nDefendants.           )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOn July 17, 2008, the United States of America (“Plaintiff”) brought suit (Doc. #1)\nagainst  eleven defendants pursuant to Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619 (“Fair Housing Act”).   Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint (Doc.\n#45) on January 7, 2009, with additional claims pursuant to the Fair Housing Act against the\nten remaining of the original defendants and three additional defendants.  Plaintiff alleges\nthat  defendant  Jamarlo  Gumbaytay  (“Gumbaytay”)  engaged  in  a  pattern  of  unlawful\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex in connection with the rental of the other defendants’\nproperties.  On June 26, 2009, Plaintiff moved for entry of default as to seven defendants,\nincluding Gumbaytay (Doc. #75).  This Court denied that motion, but, in so doing, required\nGumbaytay to file an answer to Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint by no later than October 19,\n2009 (Doc. #97).  Gumbaytay timely responded with what the Court construed as a Motion\nto Dismiss or, in the alternative, a Motion for Summary Judgment (see Doc. #101).  Upon\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 2 of 8\nconsideration of these motions and Plaintiff’s response in opposition, both motions are due\nto be DENIED.\nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\nJurisdiction over Plaintiff’s claims is proper under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1345.  The\nparties do not contest personal jurisdiction or venue, and the Court finds adequate allegations\nin support of both personal jurisdiction and venue.\nIII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.  Therefore, for the\npurposes of adjudging a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the court will accept as true all\nwell-pleaded factual allegations and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\nSee Pielage v. McConnell, 516 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir. 2008); Am. United Life Ins. Co.\nv. Martinez, 480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir. 2007).  While  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n8(a)(2) requires only that a complaint contain “a short and plain statement of the claim\nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” as a general matter, to survive a motion to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 554, 570\n(2007).  Plaintiff’s “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the\nspeculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true.”  Id. at\n555 (internal citations omitted).  It is not sufficient that the pleadings merely leave “open the\npossibility that a plaintiff might later establish some set of undisclosed facts to support\n2\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 3 of 8\nrecovery.”  Id.  at 561 (internal quotation and alteration omitted).\nUnder Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is\nappropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\nand that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Celotex Corp. v.\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).  The party asking for summary judgment “always bears\nthe initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and\nidentifying those portions of ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,’ which it believes demonstrate the\nabsence of a genuine issue of material fact.”  Id. at 323.  The movant can meet this burden\nby presenting evidence showing there is no dispute of material fact, or by showing the non-\nmoving party has failed to present evidence in support of some element of its case on which\nit bears the ultimate burden of proof.  Id. at 322-23.\nOnce the moving party has met its burden, Rule 56(e) “requires the nonmoving party\nto go beyond the pleadings and by [its] own affidavits, or by the ‘depositions, answers to\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file,’ designate ‘specific facts showing that there is a\ngenuine issue for trial.’”  Id. at 324.  To avoid summary judgment, the nonmoving party\n“must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material\nfacts.”  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986).  On the\nother hand, a court ruling on a motion for summary judgment must believe the evidence of\n3\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 4 of 8\nthe non-movant and must draw all justifiable inferences from the evidence in the non-moving\nparty's favor.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986).  After the\nnonmoving party has responded to the motion for summary judgment, the court must grant\nsummary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\nIV. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\nThe  factual  allegations  and  evidentiary  submissions,  viewed  in  the  light  most\nfavorable to the non-movant, show the following:\nGumbaytay  managed  several  residential  rental  properties  in  the  Montgomery,\nAlabama area.  From at least 2005 through the filing of the suit, Gumbaytay subjected actual\nand prospective female tenants of those properties to conduct that included unwanted verbal\nsexual advances, unwanted sexual touching, unwanted sexual language, grants and denials\nof tangible housing benefits based on sex, and adverse action when they refused or objected\nto his sexual advances.  As examples, Gumbaytay would regularly comment to female tenants\nor prospective tenants about their physical attractiveness, repeatedly ask them out on dates\neven when they had previously declined, and would send false notices of rent owed to those\nwho spurned his advances.\nB. Procedural History\nOn July 17, 2008, Plaintiff brought suit against eleven defendants pursuant to the Fair\n4\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 5 of 8\nHousing Act.  The original eleven defendants included Gumbaytay.  On August 15 and 28,\n2008, Gumbaytay filed separate motions to dismiss this complaint, on the grounds that he had\nfiled for bankruptcy (Docs. #8 & 12).  The Court denied both of those motions (Doc. #55).\nThe Court noted that any automatic stay required by Gumbaytay’s bankruptcy expired when\nthe bankruptcy court dismissed his petition on July 25, 2008.  Id.  Additionally, the stay\nwould not apply to conduct that occurs after the bankruptcy filing, such as that conduct\nalleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  Id.  \nPlaintiff filed an Amended Complaint (Doc. #45) on January 7, 2009, with additional\nclaims pursuant to the Fair Housing Act against the remaining original defendants and three\nadditional defendants.  On June 26, 2009, Plaintiff moved for entry of default judgment as\nto seven defendants, including Gumbaytay, for failure to file an answer to its Amended\nComplaint (Doc. #75).  All defendants had at least filed an answer to either the original\ncomplaint or the amended complaint (see Doc. #97).  Therefore, because the Eleventh Circuit\ndisfavors defaults, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for entry of default judgment.  Id.\nHowever,  the  Court  did  direct  Gumbaytay  to  file  an  answer  to  Plaintiff’s  Amended\nComplaint no later than October 19, 2009.  Id.\nOn that date, Gumbaytay submitted a filing initially titled “Memorandum Opinion and\nOrder” and wholly copying three full paragraphs—without citation—from the Court’s order\ndenying Plaintiff’s motion for entry of default judgment (Doc. #99).  However, he did add\nan additional section entitled “Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Evidence.”  Id.  The Court\n5\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 6 of 8\nconstrued this filing as a Motion to Dismiss or, in the alternative, a Motion for Summary\nJudgment (Doc. #101).\nV. DISCUSSION\nA. Motion to Dismiss\nIn its Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Gumbaytay violated the Fair Housing\nAct (Doc. #45).  Plaintiff adds that from at least 2005 through the filing of the lawsuit,\nGumbaytay subjected actual and prospective female tenants of his managed properties to\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex.  Id.  Plaintiff goes on to list specifics, including “unwanted\nverbal sexual advances, unwanted sexual touching, unwanted sexual language, granting and\ndenying tangible housing benefits based on sex, and taking adverse action against female\ntenants when they refused or objected to his sexual advances.”  Id.  These factual allegations,\ntaken as true, “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Therefore, Gumbaytay’s\nMotion to Dismiss is due to be DENIED.\nB. Motion for Summary Judgment\nAs stated above, the party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of\nidentifying to the Court the portions of the pleadings and evidence on file that demonstrate\nthe absence of a genuine issue of material fact.  In his motion, Gumbaytay points out Texas\nstate case law and irrelevant instances of false rape allegations that occurred outside of this\nCourt’s jurisdiction.  Gumbaytay only refers to the pending suit in one-half of one paragraph,\nas follows:\n6\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 7 of 8\nThe females in the complaint all have the same socio-economic issues [as the\nwomen Gumbaytay cites as falsely alleging rape], unemployed or under\nemployed [sic].  I never rented any units to the tenants in question except for\ntwo or three and all of them were evicted for non-payment of rent.  The ladies\nare seeking to get paid for the lies, deceit and defamation of my character.\nGumbaytay submits no evidentiary materials to support these allegations, nor does he cite to\nany other evidence or the contents of any other pleading in this pending suit.  Therefore,\nGumbaytay clearly fails to meet his initial burden, and his motion for summary judgment is\ndue to be DENIED.\nHowever, even had he satisfied that initial burden his motion would be denied.\nPlaintiff asserts in its Amended Complaint that Gumbaytay’s conduct constitutes violations\nof several provisions in § 3604 and a provision of § 3617 of the Fair Housing Act.  Section\n3604 prohibits, inter alia, various forms of sex discrimination in the rental of housing.\nSection  3617  prohibits  coercion,  intimidation,  threats,  or  interference  with  the  rights\nprotected under § 3604.\nFactually, Plaintiffs plead that Gumbaytay engaged in various types of discrimination\nagainst female tenants and prospective tenants, including unwanted verbal sexual advances,\nunwanted sexual touching, unwanted sexual language, grants and denials of tangible housing\nbenefits based on sex, and adverse actions taken when those female tenants and prospective\ntenants refused or objected to his sexual advances.  Plaintiffs also submitted affidavits from\nseveral women who have lived in properties managed by Gumbaytay, all describing various\nforms of discrimination based on sex.  Therefore, Plaintiff has submitted evidentiary material\n7\n\nCase 2:08-cv-00573-MEF-SRW   Document 108   Filed 11/23/09   Page 8 of 8\nbeyond the pleadings which designates specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.  As a result, even if Gumbaytay had satisfied his initial burden, his motion for\nsummary judgment would still be due to be DENIED.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that \n(1) Gumbaytay’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. #99) is DENIED; and\n(2) Gumbaytay’s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. #99) is DENIED.\nDONE this the 23rd day of November, 2009.\n                    /s/ Mark E.
