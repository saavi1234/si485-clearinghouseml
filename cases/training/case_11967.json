    "summary": "<p>On September 13, 2001, seven students with disabilities, by and through their parents, filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin against the Milwaukee Public School System (\"MPS\") and the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (\"DPI\"). The Plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from Disability Rights Wisconsin, claimed that MPS violated their right to a free, appropriate public education as guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Specifically, the Plaintiffs claimed that they were improperly denied special education services and Individualized Education Programs (\"IEPs\") designed to fit their needs.</p><p>The Plaintiffs' original complaint defined the class as \"all school age children with disabilities who reside in the Milwaukee Public School District boundaries and who are or may be eligible for special education and related services under IDEA and Wisconsin law.\" The court, however found this too broad, which prompted the Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint on May 3, 2004, redefining the class as \"all students eligible to receive special education from MPS who are, have been or will be denied or delayed entry into or participation in the IEP process.\"  Magistrate Judge Aaron Goodstein granted the Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. </p><p>The district court eventually held a bench trial and found both the city and state Defendants liable for systemic violations of the IDEA. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 519 F. Supp. 2d 870 (E.D. Wis. 2007). At that point, DPI settled with the class, agreeing to order MPS to meet certain compliance benchmarks. The district court approved the settlement over MPS's objection. 2008 WL 2340362 (E.D. Wis. June 6, 2008).  The settlement required that MPS conduct at least 95% of its initial evaluations within the required time period (or get proper extensions), that MPS make a reasonable effort to ensure that a parent or guardian was present at 95% of the initial IEP meetings, and that MPS make better efforts in identifying children with disabilities by monitoring school suspension patterns. The Court then appointed a monitor for a two-year period to track MPS's compliance, and imposed a comprehensive remedial scheme. 2009 WL 1615520 (E.D. Wis. June 9, 2009).  </p><p>MPS appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Plaintiffs cross-appealed the denial of certification of their first proposed class. On February 3, 2012, the Seventh Circuit (Judge Diane S. Sykes) quickly dismissed the Plaintiffs cross-appeal, noting that it was neither timely nor within the Court's jurisdiction. Turning to MPS's appeal, the Court vacated the Settlement Agreement, holding that the class never should have been certified because the Plaintiffs' cases were \"highly individualized and vastly diverse,\" thus making the case inappropriate for a class-action lawsuit. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public Schools, 668 F.3d 481 (7th Cir. 2012). </p><p>The 7th Circuit opinion stated: \"What remains are the claims of the individual Plaintiffs; the district court did not find a denial of a free appropriate public education [FAPE] in any individual case. Furthermore, the court's reasons for excusing administrative exhaustion appear to have been tied to the class allegations, and it's not clear whether the court would have excused exhaustion for any of the individual claims. Finally, it's possible - perhaps likely - that some of the named Plaintiffs' individual circumstances have changed such that their claims are now moot. We leave it to the district court on remand the task of determining whether anything remains of this case and what, if anything, should happen next.\" Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499-500 (7th Cir. 2012).</p><p>On remand, the district court's Judge Rudolph Randa dismissed the action altogether on August 20, 2012. Judge Randa entered a judgment in favor of Defendant Milwaukee Public Schools and against Disability Rights of Wisconsin, and ordered the Disability Rights of Wisconsin to pay the Defendant's attorney fees of $459,123.96. </p><p>In entering the judgment to dismiss, the court explained several reasons from the Seventh Circuit decision to remand:<blockquote>- A dispute over eligibility policies concerns that the Plaintiff raised--such as the Defendant's alleged failure to identify and evaluate individual disabled children--are in essence, disputes for which the Plaintiffs should have exhausted administrative remedies and utilized the formal administrative process. </p><p>- The class should not have been certified in the first place. The reason is that while none of the Plaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies, and the exception for systemic violations is essentially a \"class action exception,\" the exception does not apply here because Wisconsin's procedures are capable of resolving child find disputes on a case-by-case, individual basis. In summary, administrative process can resolve individual child find disputes. </p><p>- Plaintiffs' argument that exhaustion should be excused because their claims are \"systemic\" in nature is without merit because the Defendants cannot find safe harbor in the exception for systemic violations--each Plaintiff must offer an individual excuse for failing to exhaust the administrative process. </blockquote>In conclusion, none of the individual Plaintiffs had followed the formal process, and therefore, the court dismissed the case in favor of the Defendant. The plaintiffs appealed, but later withdrew the appeal. The case is closed.</p>",

Defendant MIL WAUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS \n(MBSD)oversees Defendant MIL WAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (MPS) \n5 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 5 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nincluding the provision of special education and related services.  ThcMBSD and \nMPS receive feclcral funds under IDEA and must therefore comply with the \nrequirements of IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section \n504).  The Milwaukee Board of school Directors and Milwaukee Public Schools \narea local education agency (LEA) within the meaning ofiDEA. \n8.  Defendant SPENCE KORTE is the Superintendent of Milwaukee Public Schools \nand is a school district administrator within the meaning of section 118.24 Wis. \nStats. As school district administrator he is responsible for the general supervision \nand management of professional work of the schools and the promotion of \nstudents. \n9.  Defendant STATE OF \\VISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC \nINSTRUCTION (DPI) supervises the provision of public education including \nspecial education and related services to students in Wisconsin. Both federal and \nstate laws (IDEA and section 115. 762 Wis. Stats. respectively) re'J.uire that DPI \nensure that students with disabilities in Wisconsin have available a free \nappropriate public education, including those who arc suspended or expelled from \nschool.  DPI is the State Educational Agency (SEA) within the meaning of IDEA \nAs a recipient of federal funds under IDEA, the DPI must also comply with \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n10.  Defendant ELIZABETH BURMASTER is the State Superintendent of Public \nInstruction, whose duties include the supervision of public schools in Wisconsin \nand assuring compliance with IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. \n6 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 6 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n11.  Named Plaintiffs Lamont A.; Aaron V., Jim M., Tyler C., David P., Jamie S., and \nMaiysha Y.  bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief on their ovJn \nbehalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b) (2) of \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Plaintiff class consists of all school age \nchildren with disabilities who reside in the Milwaukee Public School District \nboundaries and who are or may be eligible for special education and related \nservices under IDEA and Wisconsin law. \n12.  The plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all plaintiffs is impractical.  In \nthis case it is unknown who and how many children fall within the class. \nHowever, on information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the December 2000 \ncount reported by Milwaukee Public Schools to the Department of Public \nInstruction was 16,113 children with disabilities in the Milwaukee Public School \nDistrict. Additionally, the class includes children who will be enrolled in \nMilwaukee Public Schools who are or who will be eligible for special education \nand related services in the future. \n13.  There are questions of law and fact common to the class. \n14.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class. The named \nplaintiffs' claims offailure to provide a free appropriate public education arise \nfrom the same course of conduct that gives rise to the absentee members' claims. \n15.  The named plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nThey have no interests that are antagonistic to the class and seek relief which will \n7 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 7 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nbenefit all members of the class. \n16.  The Defendants have acted on gronnds generally applicable to the entire class, and \ntherefore declaratory and injnnctive relief with respect to the entire class is \nappropriate. \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n17.  Pursuant to IDEA and its implementing regulations, each child with a disability is \nentitled to receive a free appropriate public education consisting of special \neducation and related services provided in the least restrictive environment \nappropriate to meet the child's unique needs. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d), 1401 (8), and \n1412(a)(l) and (5). \n18.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 providesin relevant part that \"[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, ... shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination nnder any program or activity \nreceiving Federal fmancial assistance ... \" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). A recipient of federal \nfunds which operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall \nprovide a free appropriate public education to each qualified individual with a \ndisability in the recipient's jurisdiction. 34 C.F.R. § 10 4.33(a).  The provision of \nan appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and \nrelated aids and services designed to meet the individual educational needs of \nindividuals with disabilities as adequately as the need of individuals without \n8 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 8 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \ndisabilities are met. 34 C.P.R.§ 104.33(b). \n19.  Under IDEA and its implementing regulations both SEAs and LEAs have \nobligations to find and timely evaluate students who are suspected ofbeing a child \nwith a disability.  20 U.S.C.

Under IDEA and its implementing regulations, every child with a disability shall \nbe individually assessed by a multi-disciplinary team responsible for developing \nan Individualized Education Program (IEP) that meets the specific educational \nneeds of the child. 20 U.S. C.§ 1414(d)(l)(A) and (B); 34 C.P.R.§§ 300.343(a) \nand 300.532(h).  The IEP team is to consist at a minimum of the parents of the \nchild, at least one regular education teacher, at least one special education teacher \nwho has extensive and recent training and experiences related to the child's \nknown or suspected disability, and a representative of the LEA. 20 U .S.C. § \n1414(d )(l )(B).  The IEP developed by the team shall include, inter alia, a \nstatement of the specific educational services to be provided to the child and the \nextent to which the child will be able to participate in regular education programs. \n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(l)(A); 34 C.P.R.§ 300.346(c). \n21.  The IEP team is to meet periodically but not less than annually to determine \nwhether the annual goals of the child are being achieved, and to revise the IEP as \nappropriate to address any lack of expected progress. 34 C.P.R.§ 300.343(c). \n22.  The right of children with disabilities to be educated in the least restrictive \nenvironment (LRE) is an integral and legally required component of the free \n9 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 9 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nappropriate public education guaranteed by IDEA and Section 504.  TI1e LRE \nmandate requires that a child with a disability be educated with nondisabled peers \nto the maximum extent appropriate to meet the needs of that child.  20 U.S.C. § \n1412(a)(5)(A); 29 U.S.C. § 794; and 34 C.P.R.§§ 104.34(a) and 300.550(b)(l). \n23.  The LEA or the SEA shall ensure that the parents of each child with a disability \nare members of any group that makes a decision on the educational placement of a \nchild, and that the team that makes the placement decision is knowledgeable about \nthe child, the meaning of the placement data, and the placement options \n34 C.P.R. § 300.552 (a)(1). \n24.  The provision of special education and related services includes the requirement \nof planning for and providing transition services for students age 14 and older to \ntransition from secondary school to post-school activities including post \nsecondary education, vocational training, integrated employment, continuing and \nadult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation. 20 \nU.S.C. §§ 1401(30) and 1414(d)(l)(A)(vii). \n25.  Under IDEA children with disabilities who are subjected to 10 or more days in a \nschool year of disciplinary removal including constructive removal are considered \nto have experienced a change in placement.  34 C.P.R. § 300.519.  If there is no \nbehavior intervention plan in place the LEA must convene the IEP team to \ndevelop a functional behavioral assessment in order to develop a behavioral \nintervention plan.  If the child already has a behavioral intervention plan the IEP \nteam shall meet to review the plan and review its inlplementation. 34 C.P.R. § \n10 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 10 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \n300.520 (b) (1). \n26.  Under the IDEA, a state education agency (SEA) must assure (i) that all children \nwith disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education, (ii) that all \neducational programs for children with disabilities are supervised by persons in \nthe State responsible for the educational programs for children with disabilities \nand meet the SEA educational standards, and (iii) that an adequate supply of \nqnalified special education and related services personnel, and other personnel \nnecessary to educate children with disabilities, are appropriately and adequately \nprepared. 20 U.S. C.§§ 1412(a)(l)(A), 1412(a)(ll)(A), 1412 (a) (14) and 1412 (a) \n15. \n27.  Under IDEA, the SEA is responsible for approving or disapproving local \neducational agency (LEA) applications for IDEA funds.  If the SEA determines \nthat the LEA is failing to maintain programs providing free appropriate public \neducation to children with disabilities, the SEA may reduce or halt payments it \nwould have made to the LEA until the SEA is satisfied that the LEA has come \ninto compliance.  34 CFR § 300.197 (a). \n28.  In order to carry out its responsibilities under the IDEA, the SEA must monitor \nthe LEA for compliance with IDEA requirements, including free and appropriate \npublic education, least restrictive environment, transition, discipline and \nplacement. If the SEA finds that the LEA is not following such requirements, the \nSEA must take steps to see that corrective action is taken.  34 C.F.R. §§ 300.556, \nand 300.660. \n11 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 11 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n29.  Over 16,000 students in Milwaukee Public Schools are children with disabilities \nas defined by IDEA or Section 504. \n30.  Defendants have established a system that fails to provide many of these student \nwith the free appropriate public education to which they are entitled. \n31.  Defendants have adopted practices and procedures which fail to ensure timely, \nprocedurally proper, and adequate evaluations and individualized education plans \nfor children with disabilities. \n32.  Defendants have failed to ensure that children are provided with educational \nplacements that can meet their individual needs and which have been chosen with \nthe participation of parents and by a team that is knowledgeable about the child, \nthe meaning of the evaluation data and the placement options. \n33.  Defendants have adopted practices and polices which discourage or prevent \nchildren with disabilities from receiving their education in the least restrictive \nenviromnent. \n34.  Defendants have failed to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements, \nranging from the least restrictive to the most restrictive is available for students \nwith disabilities.  Rather, students with disabilities are routinely placed in overly \nrestrictive environments. \n35.  Defendants do not determine each child's individual needs and then provide a \n12 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 12 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nprogram to meet those needs in the least restrictive environment possible along a \ncontinuum of placements.  Instead, their policy and practice is to make placement \ndecisions based on pre-existing programs, staffing arrangements, and \ntransportation zones or to require the child's parent to fmd a school on his or her \nown that is willing to admit the child regardless of that schools ability to provide \nthe elements of the child's IEP. \n36.  Defendants have tailed to ensure that the limitations on suspensions and \nconstructive suspensions are enforced resulting in many students missing school \nwithout being provided functional behavioral assessments and plans, or any \nalternative educational placements. \n37.  Defendants have failed to ensure that the full range of transition services are \navailable and provided to transition age students. \n38.  Defendants have failed to ensure that IEP' s , once prepared, are properly \ndistributed and implemented and that required related services are provided. \n39.  Defendants have failed to ensure that an adequate supply of qualified special \neducation and related service personnel and other personnel necessary to educate \nchildren with disabilities are appropriately and adequately prepared. \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS \n40.  Each of the named plaintiffs has been injured by the aforesaid practices and \npolicies ofthe defendants. \n41.  Plaintiff Lamont A. is a seventeen year old with cognitive disabilities. He attends \n13 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 13 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nthe Milwaukee School of Languages and is served in a segregated classroom. \nDuring the 2000-2001 school year he received virtually no transition services. He \nhas not received training in activities of daily living despite a documented need. \nAn educational consultant observing his classroom noted his academic \nprograming included coloring and watching Tcletubbies on TV. He was denied \nparticipation on field trips, participation in a special Olympics program, and work \nprograms. He has made virtually no progress on IEP goals in the last three years \nand the goals have not been significantly changed during that period.  In February \n2001 he missed eighteen consecutive days of school and the family received no \ncontact from the school regarding Lamont's absence. The IEP team was not \nreconvened in response to this absence. \n42.  Plaintiff Aaron V. is a 16 year old with Asperger'syndrome, oppositional defiant \ndisorder, and attention deficit disorder.  He attends Hamilton High School.  Proper \ndisciplinary procedures have not been followed with Aaron.  He has not had a \nfunctional behavioral assessment and he missed more than ten days of school \nduring the 2000-2001 school year due to constructive removals. The IEP team \nwas not reconvened in response to this suspension.  His IEP does not address his \ntransition needs including behavioral and social skills. His procedural IEP rights \nhave been violated numerous times.  His teacher reported at an IEP meeting that \nthere is inadequate staffmg to provide the services Aaron needs. \n43.  Plaintiff Jim M. is a 17 year old with Asperger's syndrome.  He currently is \nplaced \"temporarily\" in a satellite site classroom at a Milwaukee Public School \n14 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 14 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nadministration building. This \"temporary\" placement has lasted for over one year. \nHe is completely segregated from regular education students. He has been \nunnecessarily segregated from his peers and been prohibited from participating in \nvarious activities because of his disability. Attempts to return him to his previous \nplacement at Milwaukee School for the Arts have been unsuccessful despite his \nmusical gifts. Additionally, he has been intentionally harassed and provoked by \nschool personnel and told by an administrator that teachers do not want him at \ntheir school. \n44.  Plaintiff Tyler C. is a ten year old with learning disabilities and emotional \ndisturbances. His IEP is not meeting his needs and school personnel have told his \nmother they are not equipped to meet his needs and they \"have nowhere to put \nhim.\"  He has made little or no progress in his IEP goals over the last two years. \nDuring the 2000-2001 school year he was constructively suspended from school \nin fur excess of l 0 days.  The IEP team was not convened to develop a functional \nbehavioral assessment. Milwaukee Public Schools suggested an alternative \nplacement for the 2001-2002 school year that wonld have required an hour and a \nhalf bus ride one way and wonld require Tyler to get up early which is made \nexceedingly difficnlt because of his medications. When Tyler's mother objected \nto this proposed placement she was given a list of twenty three schools and told to \nfmd one on her own that would take her son. \n45.  Plaintiff Jamie S. is an eight year old girl with cognitive disabilities. She attended \nEmerson Elementary for three years starting there in K5. In kindergarten she had \n15 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 15 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nserious difficulties with learning and behavior.  When her mother questioned \nschool personnel she was assured Jamie would outgrow it. Jamie continued to \nstruggle and was required to repeat first grade.  It was not until the second \nsemester of her second year in first grade that Jamie was finally evaluated for \nspecial education eligibility.  She was found to have am IQ of 62 and is eligible \nfor special education services under coguitive disabilities. Jamie's mother did not \nreceive notice of the meeting at which Jamie's eligibility was determined, her IEP \nwritten and her placement determined. \n46.  Plaintiff David P. is a sixteen year old who is deaf and emotionally disturbed. In \nthe 2000-2001 school year he was enrolled in a residential treatment program. In \nthe 2001-2002 school year he is attending Marshall High School in Milwaukee \nPublic Schools.  He is eligible for special education services and has received \nthem in the past from Milwaukee Public Schools.  However, he does not currently \nhave an IEP and no dates to convene an IEP meeting have been set. \n47.  PlaintiffMaiysha Y. is a thirteen year old with learning disabilities. In the 2000-\n2001 school year she attended the Wisconsin Conservatory of Life Long \nLearning. According to her IEP she is to be pulled out for special education \nservices four times per week but this service has not been provided. She was \nremoved from school for fifteen days without a functional behavioral assessment \nbeing done.  When the IEP team was eventually reconvened, it was scheduled at a \ntime that her mother had advised the school that she was not available.  The IEP \nmeeting that was conducted without the mother present was additionally missing \n16 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 16 of 24   Document 1\n\n'  0 \n' \nthe regular education teacher \nSUMMARY OF DEFENDANTS' SYSTEMIC F AlLURE TO \nCOMPLY WITH THE IDEA \n48.  Pursuant to its obligation to adequately monitor the performance of LEAs in \nWisconsin, DPI accepts complaints which allege IDEA violations by LEAs. \n49.  In 1994, a group of parents of children who were eligible to receive special \neducation supports and services from l\\1PS filed an IDEA complaint alleging \nnumerous violations of the IDEA committed by l\\1PS.  DPI numbered this \ncomplaint 94-044.  (Hereinafter \"group IDEA complaint\"). \n50.  Under federal law, DPI is obligated to investigate and determine whether or not an \nIDEA complaint is substantiated within 60 days.  If it is substantiated, DPI must \norder the LEA to correct the substantiated violations of the IDEA. \n51.  DPI substantiated the group IDEA complaint as to five different issues. \nSpecifically, it found MPS out of compliance with the IDEA in the following \nareas: failure to complete Multi disciplinary-team (M-team) evaluation process in \na timely manner, failure to have Individualized Education Program (IEP) teams \ndevelop placements, failure to document consideration of least restrictive \nalternative (LRE) in placement offers, assignment of special education aide to \nfunction as general secnrity aide for building, and fuilure to conduct IEP meetings \nwith all the required participants. \n52.  It took DPI 148 days to investigate the group IDEA complaint and issue its \n~7 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 17 of 24   Document 1\n\n. \n'  0  0 \nfindings.  MPS did not submit a corrective action plan (CAP) until 95 days later. \nHowever, that CAP was not accepted by DPI as DPI did not concur that the CAP \nwould remedy the substantiated IDEA violations. \n53.  Since that time, DPI has substantiated t 08 violations of the IDEA after \ninvestigating further IDEA complaints against MPS.  Included in those violations \nare 15 violations ofiDEA evaluation and reevaluation procedures, 21 violations \nof IDEA placement procedures, 8 violations of transportation procedures, 44 \nviolations of IEP procedures, 13 violations of absence and suspension procedures, \nand 7 miscellaneous other IDEA violations. (See MPS  IDEA Substantiated \nComplaint SUllJ.llliU'Y, 1994, September 2001 attached hereto as Ex. A). \n54.  As recently as May 11,2001, DPI informed MPS by letter, that MPS had failed to \ncomply with DPI orders regarding issuance and implementation of corrective \naction plans (CAPS) which DPI had ordered pursuant to substantiated IDEA \ncomplaints.  (See letter from Stephanie Petska to Carol Topinka, dated May 11, \n2001, attached hereto as Ex. B). \n55.  Under the IDEA, DPI also has the obligation to monitor the performance of all \nLEAs, separate from its dury to investigate complaints. \n56.  In its 2000 monitoring report DPI found that MPS had systemic IDEA violations \nin 10 separate areas and ordered MPS to remedy those violations.  (See 2000 \nmonitoring report, attached hereto as Ex. C) \n57.  In its 2001 monitoring report, DPI found that MPS had systemic violations in 19 \nareas.  In 2000 DPI found that MPS had systemic violations in I 0 areas, 4 of \n18 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 09/13/01   Page 18 of 24   Document 1\n\n0  0 \nwhich were the same as DPI found in its 2001 monitoring report and 3 of which \nDPI failed to review in the 2001 report.  (See 2001 monitoring report, attached \nhereto as Ex. D, and Summary Comparison of2000 and 2001 DPI monitoring \nreports, attached hereto as Ex. E). \n58.  Given the systemic violations of the IDEA which DPI has repeatedly found in \nMPS, but defendants have failed to remedy, the IDEA violations which the named \nplaintiffs allege are clearly capable of repetition, but evade systemic review if the \nnamed plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION-IDEA VIOLATIONS--MPS DEFENDANTS \n59.

Named Plaintiffs, Jamie S., Melanie V.  Bryan E. and Biagio R.  bring this action \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief on their own behalf and on behalf of all others \nsimilarly situated pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  Plaintiff class consists of all school age children with disabilities who \nreside in the Milwaukee Public School District boundaries and who are or may be \neligible for special education and related services under IDEA and Wisconsin law. \n12.  The plaintiff class is so numerous that joinder of all plaintiffs is impractical.  In \nthis case it is unknown who and how many children fall within the class. \nHowever, on information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that the December 2002 \ncount reported by Milwaukee Public Schools to the Department of Public \nInstruction was 16,021 children'with disabilities in the Milwaukee Public School \nDistrict. Additionally, the class includes children who will be enrolled in \nMilwaukee Public Schools who are or who will be eligible for special education \nand related services in the future. \n13.  There are questions oflaw and fact common to the class. \n14.  The claims of the Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of the class. The named \nplaintiffs' claims of failure to provide appropriate referral and evaluations \n6 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 6 of 20   Document 236\n\nresulting in a failure to provide a free appropriate public education arise from the \nsame course of conduct that gives rise to the absentee members' claims. \n15.  The named plaintiffs will fair Iy  and adequately represent the interests of the class. \nThey have no interests that are antagonistic to the class and seek relief which will \nbenefit all members ofthe class. \n16.  The Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the entire class, and \ntherefore declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the entire class is \nappropriate. \nSTATUTORY FRAMEWORK \n17.  Pursuant to IDEA and its implementing regulations, each child with a disability is \nentitled to receive a free appropriate public education consisting of special \n· education and related services.and the state is obligated to see that all children \nwith disabilities residing in the State, including children with disabilities attending \nprivate schools, regardless of severity of their disabilities, and who are in need of \nspecial education and related services are identified, located , and evaluated and a \npractical method is developed and implemented to determine which children with \ndisabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related services. \n1 \n20 U.S.C. §§ 1400(d), 1401 (8), and 1412(a)(l) and (3). \n18.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides in relevant part that \"[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, ... shall, solely \nby reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied \n7 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 7 of 20   Document 236\n\n0 \n' \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance ... \" 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). A recipient of federal \nfunds which operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall \nprovide a free appropriate public education to each qualified individual with a \ndisability in the recipient's jurisdiction. 34 C.P.R.§ 104.33(a).  The provision of \nan appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and \nrelated aids and services designed to meet the individual educational needs of \nindividuals with disabilities as adequately as the need of individuals without \ndisabilities are met. 34 C.P.R.§ 104.33(b).  A recipient of federal funds that \noperates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall \nannually (a) undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped person \nresiding in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a public education and \n(b) take appropriate steps to notify handicapped person and their parents or \nguardians of the recipient's duty under this subpart. 34 C.F. R. § 104.32. \n19.  Under IDEA and its implementing regulations both SEAs and LEAs have \nobligations to find and timely evaluate students who are suspected of being a child \nwith a disability.  20 U.S.C. Sec. 1414(a)(l)(A), 34 C.P.R. 300.125, 34 C.P.R. \n300.530, Sec. 115.77 (1m) Wis. Stats. and Sec. 115.78(3)(a) Wis. Stats. \n20.  Under IDEA and its implementing regulations, every child with a disability shall \nbe individually assessed by a multi-disciplinary team responsible for developing \nan Individualized Education Program (IEP) that meets the specific educational \nneeds ofthe child. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(l)(A) and (B); 34 C.P.R.§§ 300.343(a) \n8 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 8 of 20   Document 236\n\ni.11!flii!O>\"I'\"llllL·n·u  'II!Mifi  ··ii.~Anll  i..11J  !lllfll'  li.I.VIfl  II  I  illlii!Ji1ffi11JilrlJIIilrl111  l'OOWIF;HF.

The IEP team is to consist at a minimum of the parents of the \nchild, at least one regular education teacher, at least one special education teacher \nwho has extensive and recent training and experiences related to the child's \nknown or suspected disability, and a representative of the LEA. 20 U.S.C. § \n1414(d )(1 )(B).  The IEP developed by the team shall include, inter alia, a \nstatement of the specific educational services to be provided to the child and the \nextent to which the child will be able to participate in regular education programs. \n20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A); 34 C.P.R.§ 300.346 (c). \n21.  Under IDEA, the SEA is responsible for approving or disapproving local \neducational agency (LEA) applications for IDEA funds.  Ifthe SEA determines \nthat the LEA is failing to maintain programs providing free appropriate public \neducation to children with disabilities, the SEA may reduce or halt payments it \nwould have made to the LEA until the SEA is satisfied that the LEA has come \ninto compliance.  34 CPR§ 300.197 (a). \n22.  In order to carry out its responsibilities under the IDEA, the SEA must monitor \nthe LEA for compliance with IDEA requirements.  If the SEA finds that the LEA \nis not following such requirements, the SEA must take steps to see that corrective \naction is taken.  34 C.P.R.§§ 300.556, and 300.660. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n23.  Over 16,000 students in Milwaukee Public Schools are children with disabilities \n9 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 9 of 20   Document 236\n\n0 \nas defined by IDEA or Section 504.  Approximately 3% of students are referred \nfor special education evaluations each year and more may be eligible for such \nevaluations. Defendants have established a system that fails to provide many of \nthese student with the free appropriate public education to which they are entitled \nbecause they are not effectively and timely evaluated and because the required \nparticipants are not included in the initial IEP team meeting. \n24.  Defendants have adopted practices and procedures which fail to ensure timely, · \nprocedurally proper, and adequate evaluations and individualized education plans \nfor children with disabilities. \nNAMED PLAINTIFFS \n25.  Each of the named plaintiffs has been injured by the aforesaid practices and \npolicies of the defendants. \n26.  a.)  Plaintiff Jamie S. is an eight year old girl with cognitive disabilities. She \nattended Emerson Elementary for three years starting there in K5. In kindergarten \nshe had serious difficulties with learning and behavior.  When her mother \nquestioned school personnel she was assured Jamie would outgrow it. Jamie \ncontinued to struggle and was required to repeat first grade.  It was not until the \nsecond semester of her second year in first grade that Jamie was finally evaluated \nfor special education eligibility.  She was found to have am IQ of 62 and is \neligible for special education services under cognitive disabilities. Jamie's mother \ndid not receive notice of the meeting at which Jamie's eligibility was determined, \n10 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 10 of 20   Document 236\n\n0 \n' \nher IEP written and her placement determined. \nb.)  Melanie V. is a fourteen year old girl with mental illness. She attends the \nMilwaukee School of the Languages. Beginning in sixth grade, 2001-2002. \nMelanie had great difficulties with depression and failed her classes having to \nrepeat sixth grade again.  She was frequently absent and was not able to complete \nhomework.  During that year her mother, Jane, was in frequent contact with the \nschool psychologist to try and figure out ways to help Melanie. There was no \nmention of evaluating Melanie for special education by school staff and her \n· parents didn't know that type of help might be available to Melanie.  Melanie \n: struggled through her second year of sixth grade with barely passing grades. \n· In September of 2003, Melanie had progressively more and more problems with \n· behaviors at school. By October of2003, her mother had been contacted by the \n: school to say they had called the police to have Melanie taken down to the \nMilwaukee County Mental health complex.  She was kept there on a seventy-two \n· hour hold then released to her mother with medications for depression.  The \nschool had called the police because Melanie had told the school psychologist that \nMelanie felt like she wanted to kill people.  When she returned to school there \nwas no suggestion to her parents to have her evaluated for special education. \nShe had failing grades and never did or turned in homework. By November of \n2003,  the school called again to say Melanie had been taken by the police to the \nMilwaukee County Mental Health Complex. This time Melanie had shown the \n11 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 11 of 20   Document 236\n\nnt  um, \n0 \n' \nschool Psychologist where she had been \"cutting\" her ann.  Again, nobody \nsuggested to her parents that Melanie be referred for a special education \nevaluation. \nIn December 2003, Melanie found a piece of glass and a box cutter type razor \nblade and showed Ms. Kinney and then met with the school psychologist. Melanie \nadmitted to using them to cut her arms. Again the police were contacted and \nMelanie was brought to the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex.  At this \ntime Melanie was suspended from school for 5 days and a central office hearing \nwas initiated to determine if Melanie should be expelled from school. \nDuring the hearing, Jane asked about referring Melanie for special education and \nasked about the school's obligation for child find.  She was directed to the student \nhandbook and was told that was her responsibility.  Finally, Melanie was referred \nfor an evaluation by her mother and found eligible in January of2004. \nc.)  Bryan E. is fifteen years old with learning disabilities. He attends John \nMarshall High School.  Bryan has a long history of failing grades and absenteeism \nfrom schooL  All through Middle School his grades were nearly all failing. When \nhe was in sixth grade Bridget, his mother, frequently contacted the principle of \nBell Middle School where he was attending, His mother asked the Principal on \nseveral occasions if there was any testing that could be done to help figure out \nwhat was going on with Bryan. Bridget was told there was no testing available. \nBryan began to be suspended frequently. He was gone from school so often that at \none point the school social worker came to Bryan's home to meet with Bridget to \n12 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 12 of 20   Document 236\n\n0 \nsee why Bryan was missing so much school.  His mother was concerned as well \nand contacted the Principal again asking about possible testing for Bryan. She was \ntold that the Principal was not aware of any testing that could be done for Bryan. \nHe was passed on to ninth grade and High school. His mother didn't want him to \nbe passed on since he did not have any passing grades. She changed his placement \nfrom Washington to John Marshall.  His mother contacted the new school staff \nagain  for some type of testing to help Bryan.  She made a written request and \nbrought it to the school after contacting WCA.  Finally Bryan was evaluated and \nfound eligible for Special Education in January of2004.  However, Bridget had \nsurgery and was not able to attend the date the first IEP meeting was scheduled. \nThe school offered her no alternative means to participate or find out her \nconcerns. Bryan was not a participant either.  The initial IEP was determined and \nwritten without their input or participation. \nd.) Biagio R. has had a long history of mental health problems and associated \nbehaviors related to his mental health. ·These include several hospitalizations and \nsubsequent diagnosis of Bi-polar disorder, attention deficit disorder and \noppositional defiance disorder.  He is currently involved in an intense day \ntreatment program at Child Dynamics to assist with his behaviors. \nBiagio had been attending a private school but when behaviors became too \nproblematic his mother removed him and requested a special education evaluation \nthrough the Milwaukee Public Schools from Emerson Elementary, his \nneighborhood school.  His mother shared all the medical interventions and mental \n13 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 13 of 20   Document 236\n\n1  n  ru  n  lflll  1111'r  ;.c \n0 \nhealth diagnosis with the school staff.  Despite this, he was not evaluated for \nspecial education needs for emotional disabilities.  Instead he was evaluated for \nOther Health Impairment and Speech and Language Disorder.  His mother was \ntold he did not meet eligibility for either of these categories because they were not \nlegally allowed to observe Biagio at Child Dynamics and they were not able to \nobserve him much at school because he wasn't attending at that time. \nSUMMARY OF DEFENDANTS' SYSTEMIC FAILURE TO \nCOMPLY WITH THE IDEA \n27.  Pursuant to its obligation to adequately monitor the performance of LEAs in \nWisconsin, DPI accepts complaints which allege IDEA violations by LEAs. \n28.  In 1994, a group of parents of children who were eligible to receive special \neducation supports and services from MPS filed an IDEA complaint alleging \nnumerous violations of the IDEA committed by MPS.  DPI numbered this \ncomplaint 94-044.  (Hereinafter \"group IDEA complaint\"). \n29.  Under federal law, DPI is obligated to investigate and determine whether or not an \nIDEA complaint is substantiated within 60 days.  If it is substantiated, DPI must \norder the LEA to correct the substantiated violations of the IDEA. \n30.  DPI substantiated the group IDEA complaint as to five different issues.  Included \namong those five were findings that  MPS was out of compliance with the IDEA \ndue to failure to complete Multi disciplinary-team (M-team) evaluation process in \n14 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 14 of 20   Document 236\n\n, .J  rr  r 1 · 1111  1  1.  •  ~. ur  .a  1  i  ·I  t 11111 ·  r 1  T  r ·  Ul ··  1  r  rn  1  1 ·  I  i  II  [HI' \nv~   \na timely manner, and failure to conduct IEP meetings with all the required \nparticipants. \n31.  It took DPI 148 days to investigate the group IDEA complaint and issue its \nfindings.  MPS did not submit a corrective action plan (CAP) until 95 days later. \nHowever, that CAP was not accepted by DPI as DPI did not concur that the CAP \nwould remedy the substantiated IDEA violations. \n32.  Since that time, DPI has substantiated dozens more violations ofthe IDEA after \ninvestigating further IDEA complaints against MPS.  Included in those violations \nof IDEA evaluation and reevaluation procedures, and violations ofiEP \nprocedures.  (Wisconsin Department ofP ublic Instruction, Special Education \nIDEA Complaints, <http://www .dpi.state. wi. us/ dpi/ dlsealeen!c omplain.html>) \n33.  Under the IDEA, DPI also has the obligation to monitor the performance of all \nLEAs, separate from its duty to investigate complaints. \n34.  In its 2000 monitoring report DPI found that MPS had systemic IDEA violations \nin 10 separate areas including the lack of LEA representation in the evaluation of \nthe child including a meeting to determine if the child is a child with a disability, \n(this violation was again found int the 2001 monitoring report) and the failure to \nhave parents participate in the review of the existing evaluation data and in \nidentifying what additional data, if any, are needed to complete the (re)evaluation \nand  contacting parents and affording them the opportunity to participate in the \nreview of the existing evaluation data on the child and ordered MPS to remedy \nthose violations. When those same factors were reviewed again two years later in \n15 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/04   Page 15 of 20   Document 236\n\n0 \nthe 2002 monitoring, MPS was again found to systemic violations in these areas. \n(See 2000-02 monitoring report summaries, attached hereto as Ex.B) \n35.  Given the systemic violations of the IDEA which DPI has repeatedly found in \nMPS, but defendants have failed to r~medy, the IDEA violations which the named \nplaintiffs allege are clearly capable of repetition, but evade systemic review if the \nnamed plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION-IDEA VIOLATIONS--MPS DEFENDANTS \n36.

In the\ninitial district court proceedings, Magistrate Judge Aaron Goodstein granted the plaintiffs’\nmotion for class certification and appointed Disability Rights Wisconsin (“DRW”) as class\ncounsel.  ECF No. 195.  The district court eventually held a bench trial and found the\ndefendants, Milwaukee Public Schools (“MPS”) and the Wisconsin Department of Public\nInstruction (“DPI”), liable for systemic violations of the IDEA.  ECF No. 389; Jamie S. v.\nMilwaukee Pub. Sch., 519 F. Supp. 2d 870 (E.D. Wis. 2007).  DPI settled with the class,\nagreeing to order MPS to meet certain compliance benchmarks.  The district court approved\nthe settlement over MPS’s objection.  ECF No. 471; 2008 WL 2340362 (E.D. Wis. June 6,\n\n2008).  The court then ordered MPS to comply with a complex remedial scheme.  ECF No.\n598; 2009 WL 1615520 (E.D. Wis. June 9, 2009).  \nMPS appealed, and the Seventh Circuit vacated all of these orders.  “What remains\nare the claims of the individual plaintiffs; the district court did not find a denial of a free\nappropriate public education [FAPE] in any individual case.  Furthermore, the court’s\nreasons  for  excusing  administrative  exhaustion  appear  to  have  been  tied  to  the  class\nallegations, and it’s not clear whether the court would have excused exhaustion for any of\nthe individual claims.  Finally, it’s possible – perhaps likely – that some of the named\nplaintiffs’ individual circumstances have changed such that their claims are now moot.  We\nleave it to the district court on remand the task of determining whether anything remains of\nthis case and what, if anything, should happen next.”  Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Sch., 668\nF.3d 481, 499-500 (7th Cir. 2012).\nOn remand, MPS and DPI jointly move for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that\nthe plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies.  Also before the Court are\nseparate motions filed by MPS and DPI for restitution of attorneys fees.\nI. Judgment on the Pleadings\nAs an initial matter, the Court must discuss the plaintiffs’ argument that the Seventh\nCircuit’s ruling does not preclude further litigation over the certification of a class.  This\nargument flies in the face of the mandate rule, which requires a lower court to adhere to the\ncommands of a higher court on remand.  United States v. Polland, 56 F.3d 776, 777 (7th Cir.\n1995).  Here, the Seventh Circuit specifically stated that individual claims are all that\n-2-\n\n“remains” of this case.  Moreover, the law of the case doctrine, a corollary to the mandate\nrule, prohibits a lower court from reconsidering on remand an issue expressly or impliedly\ndecided by a higher court absent certain circumstances.  Id. at 779.  “Once an appellate court\neither expressly or by necessary implication decides an issue, the decision will be binding\nupon all subsequent proceedings in the same case.”  Roboserve, Inc. v. Kato Kagaku Co., 121\nF.3d 1027, 1031 (7th Cir. 1997).  The bulk of the Seventh Circuit’s opinion was devoted to\nits discussion of why the class certified by the district court failed to meet the various\nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.  That the issue was conclusively decided is highlighted\nby Judge Rovner’s separate opinion, where she wrote: “I do not rule out the possibility that\na class properly could be certified in this case or one like it, and it is to this limited extent that\nI dissent.”  Jamie S. at 504 (Rovner, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis\nadded).  Thus, according to the controlling majority opinion, the plaintiffs can no longer\npursue class certification. \nAs explained by the Seventh Circuit, the duty to provide disabled students with a “free\nappropriate public education” is a “complex and inherently child-specific undertaking.”\nJamie S. at 486.  The IDEA imposes “child find” obligations, wherein all “children with\ndisabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need of special education and related\nservices, are identified, located, and evaluated and a practical method is developed and\nimplemented to determine which children with disabilities are currently receiving needed\neducation and related services.”  20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A).  Each child’s individual needs\nmust be evaluated for the purpose of developing an “individualized educational program,”\n-3-\n\nor “IEP,” outlining the “particular special-education services that are necessary to allow the\nchild to learn in the ‘least restrictive environment.’” Jamie S. at 486 (citing §§ 1412(a)(4)-\n(5), 1414).\nWith respect to exhaustion, the IDEA requires states to provide a formal process for\nparents to seek administrative and judicial review of “any matter relating to the identification,\nevaluation, or educational placement of a child, or the provision of a free appropriate public\neducation to such child” in a funded special-education program.  § 1415(b)(6)(A).  Any party\naggrieved by the findings and decision made after an impartial due process hearing may\nbring a civil action in federal court.  § 1415(i)(2)(A).1  “It is well-settled that the IDEA\nrequires an aggrieved party to exhaust all administrative remedies before bringing a civil\naction in federal or state court . . .”  J.S. ex rel. N.S. v. Attica Cent. Sch., 386 F.3d 107, 112\n(2d Cir. 2004).  Exhaustion advances several objectives, including:  (1) permitting the\nexercise of agency discretion and expertise on issues requiring these characteristics; (2)\nallowing the full development of technical issues and a factual record prior to court review;\n(3) preventing deliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established by\nCongress; and (4) avoiding unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency the first\nopportunity to correct any error.  McQueen v. Colo. Springs Sch. Dist. No. 11, 488 F.3d 868,\n873 (10th Cir. 2007).  “States are given the power to place themselves in compliance with\n1  Plaintiffs argue that their use of DPI’s Complaint Resolution Procedure is sufficient for purposes of the IDEA’s\nexhaustion requirement.  Formerly known as EDGAR complaints, the CRP process is an “informal” process and an\n“optional step toward binding relief.”  Vultaggio ex rel. Vultaggio v. Bd. of Educ., 343 F.3d 598, 601 (2d Cir. 2003).  It is\nnot an “adequate substitute to exhausting administrative remedies under the IDEA.”  Ass’n for Cmty. Living in Colo. v.\nRomer, 992 F.2d 1040, 1045 (10th Cir. 1993). \n-4-\n\nthe law, and the incentive to develop a regular system for fairly resolving conflicts under the\n[IDEA].  Federal courts – generalists with no experience in the educational needs of\nhandicapped students – are given the benefit of expert factfinding by a state agency devoted\nto this very purpose.”  Hoeft v. Tucson Unified Sch. Dist., 967 F.2d 1298, 1303 (9th Cir.\n1992).\nPlaintiffs may bypass the administrative process in a variety of contexts, including\nwhen exhaustion would be futile or inadequate, or when the administrative agency cannot\ngrant relief.  Beth V. v. Carroll, 87 F.3d 80, 88 (3d Cir. 1996).  Plaintiffs argue, as they did\nin the prior district court proceedings, that exhaustion should be excused because their claims\nare “systemic” in nature.  “[S]everal courts have recognized that IDEA claims raising\n‘systemic’ or ‘structural’ allegations may not need to be administratively exhausted.”  Doe\nv. Ariz. Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 681 (9th Cir. 1997) (collecting cases).  The exception\nfor “systemic” violations “merely flows implicitly from, or is in fact subsumed by, the futility\nand no-administrative-relief exceptions . . .”  Beth V. at 89.  For example, in Heldman v.\nSobol, 962 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1992), the plaintiff challenged a state procedure which\npermitted boards of education to appoint hearing officers, resulting in the selection of\nadjudicators that were biased in favor of the school district, which in turn violated his right\nto an impartial due process hearing.  The court characterized this claim as “systemic” and\nexcused exhaustion.  “Heldman claims that the NYSED regulation specifying the hearing\nofficer selection procedure violates the mandate of the IDEA.  Because the regulation\nimplements a New York statute, neither the Commissioner nor the assigned hearing officer\n-5-\n\nhas the authority to alter the procedure; therefore, it would be an exercise in futility to require\nHeldman to exhaust the state administrative remedies.”  Id. at 159.  As the Second Circuit\nlater explained, the “common element” among Heldman and other cases applying the\n“systemic violation” exception is that the “plaintiffs’ problems could not have been remedied\nby administrative bodies because the framework and procedures for assessing and placing\nstudents in appropriate educational programs were at issue, or because the nature and volume\nof complaints were incapable of correction by the administrative hearing process.”  J.S. ex\nrel. N.S. at 114 (discussing Heldman; Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi, 832 F.2d 748 (2d Cir. 1987) ; J.G.\nv. Bd. of Educ. of the Rochester Sch. Dist., 830 F.2d 444 (2d Cir. 1987); Jose P. v. Ambach,\n669  F.2d  865  (2d  Cir.  1982)).    In  other  words,  “it  would  be  futile  to  complete  the\nadministrative process because the hearing officer had no power to correct the violation.”\nJ.S. ex rel. N.S. at 113.\nThe plaintiffs claim that the defendants failed to identify them as eligible for special\neducation at an earlier time.  The failure to properly identify a disabled student can itself be\na violation of the IDEA, but only if the “failure results in the denial of a free appropriate\npublic education to a qualifying child with a disability.”  Jamie S. at 495.  Accordingly, this\nis an issue that must be litigated through the administrative process.  “A dispute over such\neligibility policies concerns, in essence, questions about the identification and evaluation of\nindividual  disabled  children,  precisely  the  kind  of  dispute  to  which  the  IDEA’s\nadministrative scheme is addressed.”  Hoeft at 1306.  Wisconsin’s procedures are capable of\nresolving child find disputes on a case-by-case, individual basis.  Wis. Stat. § 115.80(1)(a)1\n-6-\n\n(a parent or attorney representing the child may “file a written request for a hearing within\none year after the refusal or proposal of the local educational authority to initiate or change\nhis or her child’s evaluation, individualized education program, educational placement, or\nthe provision of a free appropriate public education”); § 115.80(5)(a) (hearing officers have\nthe authority to “issue an order consistent with this subchapter and 20 U.S.C. § 1415(k) and\nto order whatever remedy is reasonably necessary to bring the parties into compliance with\nthis subchapter”); Hoffman v. East Troy Cmty. Sch. Dist., 38 F. Supp. 2d 750 (E.D. Wis.\n1999) (describing Wisconsin’s child-find procedures).\n  Moreover, when the Seventh Circuit ruled that the class certification order must be\nvacated for lack of commonality, it held that “[c]hild-find inquiries, like other aspects of the\nIDEA, are necessarily child specific.  There is no such thing as a ‘systemic’ failure to find\nand refer individual disabled children for IEP evaluation – except perhaps if there was\n‘significant proof’ that MPS operated under child-find policies that violated the IDEA. . . .\n[P]roof of an illegal policy ‘is entirely absent here.’”  Jamie S. at 498 (citing Wal-Mart\nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, — U.S. —, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011)) (emphasis in original).\nAccordingly, it is the law of the case that the defendants did not systematically fail to find\nand  refer  disabled  children  for  evaluation  pursuant  to  an  illegal  policy  of  “general\napplicability.”  Mrs. W at 756; Heldman at 158 n.11.  Therefore, the defendants cannot find\nsafe harbor in the exception for systemic violations.  Each plaintiff must offer an individual\nexcuse for failing to exhaust the administrative process.  See, e.g., Urban by Urban v.\nJefferson Cnty. Sch. Dist. R-1, 89 F.3d 720, 725 (10th Cir. 1996) (exhaustion required for\n-7-\n\nclaim regarding creation of IEP because the district did not adopt a “policy of general\napplicability contrary to law which ‘thereby renders agency expertise and the factual\ndevelopment of an administrative record less important’”) (quoting Ass’n for Cmty. Living\nin Colo. v. Romer, 992 F.2d 1040, 1044 (10th Cir. 1993)).\nThe Seventh Circuit remanded this case to address the individual claims of the named\nplaintiffs in this case, not to engage in further litigation over class certification.  None of the\nplaintiffs exhausted their administrative remedies, and the exception for systemic violations\nis essentially a “class action exception.”  J.S. ex rel. N.S. at 113.  While there are some cases,\nsuch  as  Heldman,  that  apply  this  exception  to  individual  claims,  those  cases  are\ndistinguishable because the administrative process can resolve individual child find disputes.\nTherefore, the defendants are entitled to judgment on the pleadings.2\nII. Attorneys’ Fees – MPS\nThe district court ordered MPS to pay DRW $459,123.96 in interim attorneys’ fees\nbased upon the plaintiffs’ status as “prevailing parties” under the IDEA.  20 U.S.C. §\n2  Aside from the primary issue of child find, the plaintiffs also argued that the defendants failed to review\nrelevant data, granted improper extensions to mandated deadlines, used suspensions in the pre-referral process (which\nimpedes the child’s initial evaluation), and conducted meetings outside the presence of parents.  Jamie S. v. Milwaukee\nPub. Sch., 519 F. Supp. 2d 870, 881 (E.D. Wis. 2007).  The plaintiffs do not appear to advance these theories after\nremand.  To the extent these claims are still viable, the defendants are entitled to judgment on them because they are\nclaims that should have been raised in the administrative process, just like the child find claims.  See, e.g., Hoeft v. Tucson\nUnified Sch. Dist., 967 F.2d 1298, 1307 (9th Cir. 1992) (“even where local school policies appear on their face to violate\nthe IDEA, administrative exhaustion may be necessary to give the state a reasonable opportunity to investigate and correct\nsuch policies. . . . Although hearing officers lack power to adjudicate questions of statutory compliance, they are\nempowered to order the provision of an appropriate education program for an individual child, as guaranteed by the\nIDEA”) (internal citations omitted); McQueen v. Colo. Springs Sch. Dist. No. 11, 488 F.3d 868, 875-76 (10th Cir. 2007)\n(“To be sure, Joshua contends that the CDE’s guidelines and the District’s policy facially violate the IDEA. . . . But the\nultimate issue in the case – and the decisive consideration for the reimbursement claim in district court – is whether\nJoshua received an appropriately individualized IEP and whether he was denied a FAPE”); Romer at 1045 (“facial\nviolation” of the IDEA “still ultimately requires a determination as to whether any individual child was denied a [FAPE]. \nSuch a determination is enhanced by the factual details of a particular child’s case”).\n-8-\n\n1415(i)(3)(B)(I).  As the court explained, the “question of liability was determined by the\ncourt in its September 11, 2007 Decision and Order.  The plaintiffs have prevailed.”  ECF\nNo. 511; 2008 WL 3852663, at *1 (E.D. Wis. Aug. 15, 2008).  The liability order referenced\nin this decision was ultimately vacated by the Seventh Circuit.  Therefore, the plaintiffs are\nno longer prevailing parties under the IDEA, and the order granting interim attorneys’ fees\nmust be vacated.  “The plaintiffs, we now know, have lost this case; and when a judgment\non which an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party is based is reversed, the award,\nof course, falls with it.”  Palmer v. City of Chi., 806 F.2d 1316, 1320 (7th Cir. 1986); Fed’n\nof Adver. Indus. Representatives, Inc. v. City of Chi., 326 F. 3d 924, 933 (7th Cir. 2003)\n(“Obtaining a favorable judgment that is reversed on appeal does not entitle a party to\nprevailing-party status”).  Plaintiffs argue that MPS cannot recover their fees because they\ndid not appeal the interim fee order.  Even if MPS did not explicitly attack the fee award on\nappeal, MPS’s successful appeal eviscerated the entire basis for the fee award.  Pursuant to\nthe law of the case, the plaintiffs are no longer prevailing parties, so the fee award is subject\nto vacatur.3\nIII. Attorneys’ Fees – DPI\nAs noted above, the plaintiffs settled their claims against DPI.  In exchange, DPI\nagreed to pay DRW $475,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs.  ECF No. 433-2 at 18.  DPI did\n3  Strangely, the plaintiffs also chastise MPS for not obtaining a bond pending appeal.  “The function of a\nsupersedeas bond is to protect the judgment creditor’s position from erosion during any period that its right to execute is\nobstructed by a stay pending appeal . . .”  Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. Western Union Tel. Co., 786 F.2d 794, 800 (7th\nCir. 1986).  In this context, the plaintiffs and DRW are judgment creditors, and their position was protected during the\nappeal because MPS tendered payment of the fees to DRW.  Now DRW has to pay them back.  Balark v. City of Chi., 81\nF.3d 658, 663 (7th Cir. 1996) (“If a district court judgment is reversed on appeal, the effect of the appellate court ruling is\nthat the judgment was never correct to begin with.  If a judgment has been paid immediately, it must be refunded”).\n-9-\n\nnot join in MPS’s appeal (in fact, they filed an amicus brief in support of the settlement), but\nthe Seventh Circuit vacated the district court’s order approving the settlement because DPI\n“cannot unilaterally force MPS to take specific remedial action,” and also because there can\nbe “no class settlement if the class should not have been certified in the first place.”  Jamie\nS. at 502.  DPI argues that it is entitled to restitution because the fees were paid in reliance\non the district court’s now-vacated order approving the settlement agreement.  Put another\nway, DPI argues that the settlement agreement – specifically the agreement to pay the fees\n– should be rescinded under a variety of theories, including mutual mistake and frustration\nof purpose.  This is a state law claim that should be initiated by a pleading, not raised for the\nfirst time in a collateral motion.  Carr v. Runyan, 89 F.3d 327, 331 (7th Cir. 1996) (“the\nformation, construction, and enforceability of a settlement agreement is governed by local\ncontract law”).  The Court would not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over such a claim\nin any event because the federal claims have now been dismissed.  28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3);\nBourke v. Conger, 639 F.3d 344, 346 (7th Cir. 2011) (“district courts should generally\ndismiss . . . state law claims without prejudice once they have resolved all federal claims”).\nNOW,  THEREFORE,  BASED  ON  THE  FOREGOING,  IT  IS  HEREBY\nORDERED THAT:\n1. Defendants’  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  [ECF  No.  680]  is\nGRANTED;\n2. MPS’s motion to vacate the order granting interim attorneys’ fees and for\nrestitution of attorneys’ fees [ECF No. 682] is GRANTED;\n-10-\n\n3. DPI’s motion for restitution of attorneys’ fees [ECF No. 677] is DENIED\nwithout prejudice;\n4. Plaintiffs’ motion to strike DPI’s reply brief [ECF No. 701] is DENIED; and\n5. This matter is DISMISSED.  The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment\naccordingly.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 20th day of August, 2012.\nBY THE COURT:\n__________________________\nHON. RUDOLPH T.

Wisconsin \nAve., Milwaukee, WI 53202. \n \nAll interested class members are invited to attend to address the fairness of this proposed \npartial  settlement  between th e  plaintiffs  and  the W isconsin  Department  of Public \nInstruction  (DPI).  Any cla ss  members  who wish to obj ect  to the proposed partial \nsettlement must state their objections in writing and send them to Judge Goodstein at the \naddress listed above no later than July 21, 2008. \n \nThe Plaintiffs are asking for declaratory and injunctive relief.  They are  not seeking \nmoney damages. \n  \n  1  \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-AEG     Filed 07/01/2008     Page 1 of 3     Document 505-2 \n\n \nThe court has decided that the class of plaintiffs in this lawsuit consists of: from the date \nof September 13, 2000 to the present, those students eligible for special services who are, \nhave been or will be denied or delayed entry into the special education process which \nresult in a properly constituted initial IEP meeting between the IEP team and the parents \nor guardians of the student.   \n \nExamples may include: \n•  Parents who requested that their children b e evaluated for special education \nservices, and MPS either never evaluated their children, or failed to do so within \nthe legally permissible time period  (60 or 90 days from the referral depending \non when the referral was submitted); \n•  Students who had an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) meeting to determine \nwhether they should begin  receiving special education services, but MPS did not \nhave all the right people at the IEP meeting, in order to make such a decision; \n•  Students, on whose behalf teachers or ot her professionals, such as doctors or \npsychologists,  suggested to MPS that they   should receive special educatio n \nsupports or services, but MPS failed to evaluate those children, or failed to do so \nwithin  the legally per missible  time p eriod  (60 or 90 days   from the referra l \ndepending on when the referral was submitted); \n•  Students who have been suspended more than 10 days in a school year, but MPS \nfailed to hold a special education evalua tion in order to de termine whether or \nnot those children needed special education services. \n \nIf you are a member of the class, you are represented by attorneys from Disability Rights \nWisconsin (DRW), through the class representatives.  If you want to find out whether you \nmay be a class member, please contact DRW.  The defendants are the Milwaukee Public \nSchool District and the W isconsin Department of Public In struction.  They also have \nattorneys working on their respective sides.  \n \nOn September 11, 2007, Magistrate Judge Aaron  Goodstein issued an order  finding that \nbetween September 2000 to June 2005, Milwaukee Public Schools systemically violated \nthe Child Find provisions of the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in \nthe following ways:  (1 ) MPS failed to refer children with a suspected disability in a \ntimely manner for an initial evaluation, i.e., the 90 day requirement; (2) MPS improperly \nextended the 90 day tim e requirement; (3) MPS imposed suspensions in a m anner that \nimproperly impeded its ability to refer children with suspected disabilities for an initial \nevaluation; and (4) MPS failed to insure that  the child’s parents or guardians attend the \ninitial evaluation.  The Court also found that between September 2000 and June 2005, the \nWisconsin  Department  of Public Instruct ion  (DPI) violated the IDEA by failing to \nadequately  discharge its ove rsight  and supervisory obli gations  in  regard  to  the \ncompliance by MPS with the IDEA and related  state statutes, as that compliance relates \nto the systemic violations found by the Court. The Court ordered the matter to proceed to \na remedy stage.  DRW and the DPI have reached an agreement of resolution of the matter \nas it pertains to the claims against DPI. No remedy has been agreed upon with Milwaukee \nPublic Schools and that matter is still pending. \n \nIn summary the terms of the agreement include the following: \n \n  2  \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-AEG     Filed 07/01/2008     Page 2 of 3     Document 505-2 \n\n \n1)  Appointment of an independent outsid e  expert to m onitor  the Milwaukee \nPublic Schools’ state and federal speci al education law obligations, and the \nestablishment of measurable standards for MPS’s future performance with \nrespect to a) timely initial evaluations of children for special education; b) \nparental participation in initial IEP meetings; c) referral of students who reach \na set number of suspensions in a given school year to a system  of early \nintervention services to address the student’s academic or behavior issues that \nresulted in suspensions; d) referral of  students who are retained in a given \nschool year to the system of early intervention services. \n \n2)  The independent expert shall conduct a  review of policy and procedures in \nMilwaukee Public Schools and conduct a needs assessment regarding finding \nchildren who may be eligible for sp ecial education (also known as Child \nFind).  The expert will oversee the crea tion of a compliance plan to achieve \nagreed upon performance standards in the Milwaukee Public Schools District \nand have the authority to see that those standards are met. \n \n3)  The  creation of a parent trainer pos ition  housed at W isconsin  Family \nAssistance Center for Education T raining and Support (FACETS) to provide \ntraining and support to MPS parents and others for 4 years. \n \n4)  The  payment  of attorney’s fees to  plaintiff’s  counsel in the am ount  of \n$475,000. \n \n5)  All class members will release or give up all claims against DPI that arose out \nof or were related to the litigation, between September 13, 2000, and the date \non which the Court approves the settlement agreement. \n \n6)  Class members do not release or give  up any rights to seek relief from  MPS \nwith respect to claims that arise out of or are related to the litig ation between \nSeptember 13, 2000, and the date on which the Court approves the settlem ent \nagreement, including but not limited to claims for compensatory services for \ninjured class members, and claims for additional attorneys fees and costs.   \n \n7)  Dismissal of DPI as a party defendant  in further proceedings in the lawsuit, \nsubject to the Court’s  retention of jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the \nagreement. \n \nFor a detailed copy of the settlement agreement, contact Disability Rights Wisconsin \n(DRW) at:  414-773-4646, or see its website www.disabilityrightswi.org .  \n \n        Jon  W.

Therefore, no later than July 24, 2009, the\nparties shall submit joint proposals detailing the means that shall be used to provide\nindividual and general notice to potential class members, as well as the contents of any\nproposed notice. If after good faith efforts, the parties are unable to reach a mutual\nagreement, the parties shall each submit separate proposals. Further, no later than July\n24, 2009, the parties shall submit jointly the name, curriculum vitae, affidavit pursuant\nto Rule 53(b)(3)(a), and information indicating the terms under which the independent\nmonitor shall be compensated for the proposed independent monitor.

Case No. 01-C-928 \nMILWAUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS, et. al., \nDefendants. \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION \nOn November 14, 2003, this court issued its decision certifying a class in resolution of the · \nplaintiffs' second amended motion for class certification.  Thereafter, the plaintiffs unsuccessfully \nsought to file an interlocutory appeal  with the Seventh Circuit, and also filed a motion to compel \ndisclosure from the United States Department of Justice over an expert report prepared by Dr. Mary \nMargaret Kerr.  The report concerned the findings of her investigation of the delivery of special \neducation in the Milwaukee public school district. \nOn April 14, 2004, the court met with counsel for the parties to discuss further scheduling. \nAs a result of that conference, the plaintiffs were directed to file an amended complaint in accordance \nwith the court's order of certification and the procedures and a schedule for class notification were \nestablished.  A schedule for lay and expert discovery was also put in place. \nThe plaintiffs filed their amended complaint in May, the defendants answered, and on June 15, \n2004, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider the court's order of class certification.  The motion \nhas been fully briefed and following the briefing, plaintiffs submitted additional case citations of \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 01/24/05   Page 1 of 5   Document 255\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\nII  .<U __ UUUUL_I \n~  0 \n'W \nrecent decisions from several circuits.  The plaintiffs' motion is based on \"new evidence\" obtained \nin support of their original claim for class certification.  Basically, this new evidence is the report of \nDr. Kerr, which the plaintiffs contend that they attempted to obtain with all due diligence, but were \nfinally forced to file the aforementioned motion to compel disclosure. The plaintiffs did not receive \nDr. Kerr's report until March, 2004, which was several months after the court issued its decision on \nclass certification. \nBoth defendants MPS and State of Wisconsin DPI oppose the motion for a variety of reasons. \nThe defendants submit that the evidence of Dr. Kerr is not admissible since she is not an expert named \nin this case, that the evidence is no longer reflective of the current status and that it is not new.  They \nalso contend that since the parties have relied on earlier rulings from the court, reconsideration at this \njuncture of the case would cause unreaSonable delay, expense and duplication of effort. \nAccording to the plaintiffs, Dr. Kerr's report \"verifies plaintiffs' long-standing contention that \nthere is a systemic failure in the delivery of special education services and compliance with the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in MPS.\" (Plaintiffs' brief at 4).  Plaintiffs thus \nagain ask the court to expand its definition of class to include systemic failures in both the pre-\ndetermination and post-determination processes.  Plaintiffs state that, while the fmdings in Kerr's \nreport are consistent with the findings of plaintiffs' experts, the report is not duplicative and is \nsubstantially more in-depth than the expert reports. \nAgain, the defendants disagree with the plaintiffs' assessment of Kerr's report.  They submit \nthat the report's fmdings and conclusions do not disturb the underlying basis of the court's earlier \nrulings, i.e. that there is an adequate due process mechanism in place to address and remedy post-\ndetermination grievances.  In fact, the defendants note that Dr. Kerr declined to offer an opinion on \n2 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 01/24/05   Page 2 of 5   Document 255\n(Rev.B/82) \n\nG \n' \nthe availability or adequacy of the due process hearing system.  (See, Kerr report at 91  n.  106). \nHowever,  Dr. Kerr then goes on to briefly note that based upon her \"observations,\" the MPS \ncomplaint system lacks appropriate coordination for receiving and dealing with complaints. \n( Id. at 97). \nEven though Kerr's report may be more in-depth and may contain some information not \npreviously set forth by plaintiffs' experts, in the opinion of this court, it is simply cumulative of what \nhas already been presented by the plaintiffs.  Nothing here is  new.  Even if it offers a \"new \nperspective,\"  as  the  plaintiffs  contend  (Plaintiffs'  reply  brief at  4),  that  is  not  a  basis  for \nreconsideration. Armed with the Kerr report, the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is still shooting \nat the same target of inclusion of post-termination processes;  this time the plaintiffs are just using \na different caliber of ammunition. This court has tread this same ground before and the bottom line \nis that the plaintiffs disagree with the decision as to the extent of challenges that are eligible for class \ncertification.  From the outset, it has been the plaintiffs' very forceful position that the alleged \nsystemic failures of MPS permeate the entire scope of its attempt to comply with the requirements of \nthe IDEA. Numerous examples of plaintiffs' position have been presented by its named experts and \nnow by Dr. Kerr.  But, for reasons previously set out in its class certification decisions, this court is \nof the opinion that the category of challenges characterized as \"post-determination\" are subject to \nadministrative exhaustion because they are individual and substantive in nature, and an adequate due \nprocess mechanism is in place to consider and remedy these problems . The court further believes that \nthose challenges characterized as \"pre-determination\" are, on the other hand, systemic or procedural \nin nature and not likely to be remedied by administrative exhaustion. Parenthetically, Dr. Kerr's report \ndoes make findings that are supportive of plaintiffs' position in the pre-determination area. \n3 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 01/24/05   Page 3 of 5   Document 255\n(Rev.S/82) \n\nSubsequent to the completion of briefing on the motion to reconsider, plaintiffs submitted \ncopies of decisions in the cases of J.S. v. Attica Central Schools, 386 f.3d 107 (2nd Cir. 2004) and \nChristopher S. v.  Stanislaus County Office of Education, 384 F. 3d 1205 (9th Cir. 2004).  Both \ndecisions discuss the requirement for a student to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a \nfederal court action under the IDEA.  The requirement for exhaustion is excused when such efforts \nwould be futile since the administrative procedures do not provide an adequate remedy.  With the \nIDEA, exhaustion of administrative remedies is required so that disputes relating to the education of \ndisabled students can be first addressed by those with expertise in the area. \nBoth of the cited cases arrived at the appellate court on review of the district court's ruling on \nthe defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs·complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, i.e. \nthe alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In J.S., the circuit court affirmed the decision \nof the district court in denying the motion to dismiss and, in so doing, discussed a number of different \nexamples of systemic violations precluding the application of exhaustion.  In Christopher S., the \ncircuit court reversed the district court's dismissal of the complaint, stating that it had sufficiently \nalleged subject matter jurisdiction. \nLike the Kerr report, neither of these cases presents anything new for the court to consider. \nBoth state the law, which was thoroughly considered by the court when its earlier decisions were \nissued.  There are exceptions to the exhaustion requirement, and this court believes that they exist in \nthe pre-determination challenges. The court has established the scope of this litigation. It is time to \nmove the case forward to its ultimate resolution. \n4 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 01/24/05   Page 4 of 5   Document 255\n(Rev.S/82) \n\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is Denied. \nSO ORDERED. \n~ \nJ.lf-\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this  day of January, 2005. \n5 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 01/24/05   Page 5 of 5   Document 255\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) ",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nJAMIE S., on behalf of the class, \n \n      Plaintiffs, \n    v.            Case No. 01-C-928 \n \nMILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, et. al., \n \n    Defendants.  \n \n \nORDER GRANTING PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF PROPOSED CLASS \nSETTLEMENT \n \n \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  On September 13, 2001, the plaint iffs filed their com plaint, alleging violations under the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (“IDEA”) and related state \nstatutes, Wis. Stat. §§ 115.758, et seq.  Upon the written  consent of the partie s to the exercise of \njurisdiction by the magistrate judge, the case was reassigned to  this court on  November 28, 2001.  \nThe court then issued its scheduling order establishing a tim e frame for pretrial discovery and for \nfiling a motion seeking class certification.  On  November 7, 2002, the plaintiffs filed their m otion \nfor class certification seeking to  proceed on their claims within the context of a class action.  T he \ndefendants filed their opposition to the motion, and on May 23, 2003, the court, in its Decision and \nOrder Regarding Class Certification, directed the plaintiffs to submit an amended class certification \nmotion because the court determined that a number of the plaintiffs’ claim s were subject to the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement, pursuant to the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).   As \nstated in that decision, this cour t determined that the plaintiffs’ proposed class definition included \nclaims for which exhaustion would be required.  Th e court concluded that some of the plaintiffs’ \n\nclaims were not systemic in natu re, identifying these as “p ost-determination” claims.  The court \nreasoned that these claims were subject to administrative exhaustion because they are individual and \nsubstantive  in natu re  and each   alleged  wrong  could  be poten tially  remedied  through  the \nadministrative  process outlin ed  in the IDEA.  Th e  court identif ied  the othe r  claims  as “pre-\ndetermination” claims and concluded that these could be systemic or procedural in nature.  As such, \nthese claims had the potential for class certificat ion.   The plaintiffs we re required to file an \namended motion for class certification limited to the pre-determination claims. \n  On June 23, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their  amended motion for class certification, which \nsought class certification based upon the claims as narrowed by the court’s May 23, 2003 order.  On \nAugust 1, 2003, the court issued a second Decision and Order, which directed the plaintiffs to file a \nsecond amended motion for class certification  because, in the court’s opinion, both the plaintiffs \nand the defendants misconstrued the May 23, 2003, decision and order.   Ultimately, on November \n14, 2003, this court entered its third  Decision and Order, and at that tim e, defined the class as  \nfollows:  \nThose students eligible for special educat ion services from the Milwaukee Public \nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delay ed entry or \nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between \nthe IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \n \n  At this point, a number of other motions were filed, including the defendant MPS’s motion \nto dismiss certain claims as not typical of the class and the plaintiffs’ motion to compel production \nof materials from the United States Departm ent of Justice.  The court ruled on these m otions and \nthen met with the parties to discuss appropriate notice to the class, and a discovery schedule for \nexpert witnesses.  After notice to the class was given and expert discovery com pleted, the court \nrequested that the parties file a joint stipulated statement of facts, together with summaries of their \nrespective expert witnesses.   Based upon the subm issions, and in an effort to avoid the time  \nconsuming process involved in summary judgm ent motions, the court decided to bifurcate trial \n  2\n\nproceedings, and first conduct a court trial for expert witnesses.  After some rescheduling, the court \ntrial involving expert witnesses (referred to as Phase I) was  commenced on October 18, 2005, and \ncompleted on November 2, 2005 (the trial did not r un continuously during that period).  The court  \nheard from six experts. \n  On November 28, 2005, the court held a hearing  at which time the parties were advised of \nthe court’s initial reaction to the experts’ testimony and conclu sions drawn therefrom.  The court \ninformed the parties that it woul d be necessary to proceed to Phase II,  which would consist of the \nfactual presentations upon which the experts form ed their respective opinions.   The trial to the \ncourt in Phase II began on April 10, 2006, and wa s concluded on April 26, 2006.  The testimony of \n48  witnesses was presented, and num erous  documents  were rec eived  in evidenc e.   Post tr ial \nsubmissions were filed by the parties in June, 2006.   \n  On September 11, 2007, the court issued its Phase II Decision and Order finding that MPS \nviolated the IDEA’s Child Find req uirements. This violation was not limited to the representative \nplaintiffs but was systemic in nature and violated  the rights of the plaintiff class. Specifically,  the \ncourt held that MPS f ailed to refer children with a suspected disability in a timely manner for an \ninitial  evaluation, i.e. the 90 day requirem ent;  MPS improperly extended the 90 day tim e \nrequirement; MPS imposed suspensions in a manner  that improperly impeded its ability to r efer \nchildren with suspected disabilities for an initial evaluation; and MPS failed to insure that the \nchild’s parents or guardians atte nd the initial evalua tion.  The court furthe r concluded that the \nactions of MPS in not reviewing all d ata to determine the exact nature of the child’s disability, \nwhile violations in individual cases, did not constitute systemic violations of the IDEA. \n  Finally, the court concluded that during th e time period from September, 2000 to June , \n2005,  DPI violated the IDEA and related state stat utes by failing to adequately discharge its \n  3\n\noversight and supervisory obligations in regard  to the com pliance by MPS with the IDEA and \nrelated state statutes, as that compliance related to the systemic violations found by the court.   \n  In  light of this court’s   finding  of  liability,  the court p roceeded  towards  Phase  III, the \nremedies phase of this m atter. (See Docket No. 415.) A court trial is scheduled to commence on \nNovember 3, 2008. \n  On April 7, 2008, the plaintiffs and DPI filed  a joint motion seeking the court to approve a \nsettlement agreement between the plaintiffs and DPI. (Docket Nos. 431, 432, 433, 435.) Following \na status conference on Ap ril 17, 2008, (Docket No.  441), the court ordered MPS to respond with \nany objections to the proposed settlem ent agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant DPI no \nlater than May 1, 200 8, and the p laintiffs and DPI were permitted until May 15, 2008 to reply. \n(Docket No. 441.) The pleadings on the plaintiffs’ and DPI’s motion to approve settlement are now \nclosed and the matter is ready for resolution.  \nAlso pending before this court is the plainti ffs’ motion for interim attorneys’ fees. (Docket \nNos. 392, 393, 394, 395, 397; DPI / MPS resp. 400, 404, 405; Plaint. reply 408, 409, 411.) \nII. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT \n  The settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and DPI addresses the three specific areas \nof systemic violations found by the court in Phase II, namely, MPS’ failure to conduct timely initial \nevaluations, MPS’ failure to insure that a child’s parent or guardian participated in an initial IEP \nmeeting, and the fact that MPS utilized suspens ions in a manner that impeded its ability to refer \nchildren who may be suffering from a disability for an initial evaluation. (Docket No. 431-2 at 4-7.)  \n  The settlement agreement provides that MPS  shall conduct 95% of its initial evaluations \nwithin the required time period or the time period shall be properly extended, for two consecutive \nyears. (Docket No. 431-2 at 4-5.) Similarly, the settlement agreement calls for MPS to have a parent \nor guardian present for an initial IEP meeting or for MPS to m ake reasonable efforts to ensure the \n  4\n\nparent or guardian’s participation, in 95% of its initial IEP meetings for a period of two consecutive \nyears. (Docket No. 431-2 at 5-6.) Finally, the settlement calls for MPS, in two consecutive years, to \nrefer 95% of students in kinderg arten through fifth grade who ar e suspended ten or m ore days \nduring a school year and 95% of students in sixth through twelfth grades who are suspended twenty \nor more days in a school year to a “system of early intervention services . . . designed to address the \nstudents’ behavior issues that resulted in suspen sions and which shall incl ude the possibility of \nreferral of the student for an evaluation to determ ine if the student is a student with a disability.”  \n(Docket No. 431-2 at 6-7.) \n  Compliance with these agreed-upon benchm arks shall be evaluated by a court-appointed \nindependent expert, whom the parties agree should  be Alan Coulter. (D ocket No. 431-2 at 7-12.) \nThis independent expert shall be paid for by  DPI. (Docket No. 431-2 at 8.) The 95% com pliance \nrate shall be measured in each individual MPS school for the timeliness of initial evaluations, parent \nor  guardian  participation  in in itial  IEP m eetings,  and with respect to   compliance  regarding \nsuspended students.  \n  Further, the settlement agreement calls for MPS, in two consecutive years, to refer 95% of \nMPS students who are retained in a given school  year and are not identified as suf fering from a \ndisability shall be “referred to a system of early intervention services approved by the Independent \nExpert  designed to timely address  the  students’  academic  or beh avior  issues  that  resulted in  \nretention and which shall in clude the possibility of referral of the student for an evaluation to \ndetermine  if the student is a  student  with a disability.” (D ocket  No.  431-2 at 7.) The 95% \ncompliance is not referenced to “each school,”  and programs for the referred students will be \nimplemented with an 80% degree of integrity. Unlike the three issues discussed above, the court has \nnot found any systemic IDEA violation related to the retention of students.  \n  5\n\n  The settlement agreement calls for MPS to ha ve four years to achieve the required two \nconsecutive  years of com pliance  regarding tim ely  initial evaluations and parent or guardian \nparticipation  in initia l  IEP  meetings  and eight years to com ply  with  the  agreement  regarding \nsuspended and retained students.  (Docket No. 431-2 at 14-15.) N on-compliance shall result in a \nhearing before this court for a determination of the remedy. (Docket No. 431-2 at 15.) Compliance \nshall result in termination of the agreement and dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst DPI.  \n  Further, the agreement calls for DPI to o rder MPS to provide training to MPS’ staff, as \ndeemed necessary by the Independent Expert, on indi cators of special edu cation needs, referral \nprocedures, and Child Find obligations. (Docket No. 431-2 at 13.) Finally, DPI agrees to provide for \na fulltime professional to train and support parents and MPS staff regarding provisions of the IDEA \nand Child Find obligations for the length of this  agreement, or until DPI’s paym ents for this \nprofessional meets $300,000.00. (Docket No. 431-2 at 13.)  \n  Finally, DPI agrees to pay to the plain tiffs $475,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs to \nDisability Rights Wisconsin. (Docket No. 431-2 at 18.) \nIII. MPS’ OBJECTIONS TO CLASS SETTLEMENT \n  MPS primarily argues that the court should  reject the proposed settlem ent because the \nsettlement will strip MPS of its legal rights. (Docket No. 452 at 3-22.) Specifically, MPS contends \nthat (1) the settlement strips MPS of the right to argue whether prospective relief is necessary and/or \nappropriate, (Docket No. 425 at 4-12 ); (2) the proposed settlement strips MPS of its right to make \ndecisions regarding which students shall be reta ined, (Docket No. 452 at 12-13); (3) the proposed \nsettlement strips MPS of its right to appeal a DPI directive to the Department of Education, (Docket \nNo. 452 at 13-14); (4) and the proposed settlement agreement strips MPS of its right to discipline its \nstudents, (Docket No. 452 at 14-22).Further, MPS objects to the proposed settlement on the grounds \n  6\n\nthat it includes a class that it broader than that determined by the court, (Docket No. 452 at 23), the \nproposed settlement relieves DPI of liability for any potential compensatory education, (Docket No. \n452 at 24-25), and the proposed settlem ent agreement exceeds DPI’s authority un der the IDEA, \n(Docket No. 452 at 25-27).  \nIV. ANALYSIS \n  A court in this district, some time ago in another class action involving MPS had this to say: \nIt is axiomatic that the  federal courts look with great favor upon the voluntary \nresolution of litigation through settlement. United States v. McInnes, 556 F.2d 436, \n441  (9th Cir. 1977);  Du  Puy v. Director, Office  of  Workers'  Compensation \nPrograms, 519 F.2d 536, 541 (7th Cir. 1975). In the class action context in particular, \n“there is an overriding public interest in favor of settlement.” Cotton v. Hinton, 559 \nF.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir. 1977).  Settlement of the complex disputes often involved \nin class actions minimizes the litigation expenses of both parties and also reduces the \nstrain such litigation imposes upon already scarce judicial resources. Id.\n \nSettlement of a class action is not, howeve r, an unmixed blessing. Balanced against \nthe  “overriding public interest in f avor  of  settlement”  are strong countervailing \npublic  policies which counsel against auto matic  judicial acceptance of such \nagreements. First and foremost is the fact that most of those whose rights are affected \nby  a class action settlem ent  the mem bers  of  the class are not involved in its \nnegotiation nor are they present to voice their views in co urt. The class m embers \nmust rely upon the representa tion of the class representa tives and class counsel to \nprotect their interests. While this representation is no doubt vigorous in m ost cases, \non occasion the negotiating parties may find that their individual interests can best be \nserved by a settlem ent which is not in the bes t interests of the class as  a whole. \nSimilarly, class counsel m ay be persuaded  by the prospect of a substantial fee to \naccept a settlement proposal which leaves the class with less relief than could have \nbeen procured through more vigorous negotiation. In such cases, the class m embers \nmay find that substantial rights have been  bargained away in exchan ge for relief \nwhich inures primarily to the benefit of a few class members or class counsel. See In \nre General Motors Cor p. Engine Interchange Litigation, 594 F.2d 1106, 1120 (7th \nCir. 1979); Moreland v. Rucker Pharmacal Co., 63 F.R.D. 611, 615 (W.D.La.1974). \n \nIn addition to this con cern with the interests of class members, there is a concern \nwith the interests of the public as a whole. The substantive issues involved in many \nclass actions reflect a broad public interest in the rights to be vindicated or the social \nor  economic  policies to be established. In such cases, the ram ifications  of a \nsettlement can extend far beyond the rights of individual class members. This public \ninterest is present not only in civil rights suits such as the one now before us, but also \nin such economic litigation as antitrust and consumers' rights actions. Uncritical \nacceptance of a class action settlem ent can, therefore, disturb im portant national \n  7\n\npolicies  beyond the immediate impact  upon  the rights of class m embers.  See \nDevelopments in the Law Class Actions, 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1318, 1536-39 (1976). \n \nTo safeguard the rights of class mem bers and allow consideration of  the broader \nimplications of a class acti on settlement, Rule 23(e) of  the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure requires that notice of a proposed  settlement be sent to all class m embers \nand that judicial approval of  settlement offers be procured prior to dism issal of a \nclass action. Rule 23(e) does not specify any  particular standard which a settlement \nmust satisfy nor does it provide for a pr ocedure within which settlement proposals \nshould be reviewed. The courts of appeals  have required that district court approval \nof a settlement pursuant to Rule 23(e) be given only where the district court finds the \nsettlement fair, reasonable and adequate. See, e.g., Grunin v. International House of \nPancakes, 513 F.2d 114, 123 (8th Cir. 1975).  \n \nArmstrong v. Board of School Directors, 616 F.2d 305, 313-14 (7th Cir. 1980).  Thus, the threshold  \nquestion presented to this court is whether the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. \nOnly if this court determines that the settlement crosses this threshold does the court proceed to the \nfirst step in the settlement process; that being notification of the class members and a f ormal \nfairness hearing. See, e.g., id. at 314.  \n“Generally, a non-settling defenda nt lacks standing to  object to approval of a settlem ent \nbecause the non-settling defendant is not affected by that settlement. Zupnick v. Fogel, 989 F.2d 93, \n98 (2d Cir. 1993) (citing cases). Standing exists  only where the non-settling defendant can show \nthat it will ‘sustain some formal legal prejudice as a result of the settlement.’ Id. (citing Waller v. \nFinancial Corp. of America, 828 F.2d 579, 583 (9th Cir. 1987)).”  In re NASDAQ Market-Makers \nAntitrust Litig., 176 F.R.D. 99, 103-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). The question of MPS’ standing to object to \nthe proposed settlement is essentially subsumed into the analysis of the merits of MPS’ objections; \nMPS has standing only if the proposed settlem ent only if it affects MP S’ rights and MPS objects \nlargely because it alleges that the settlement adversely affects its legal rights. The court does not \naccept the concession of the plain tiffs and DPI that MPS necessarily has standing to challeng e the \nproposed settlement, (Docket No. 456 at 2), and ther efore rejects MPS’ argument raised in its sur-\n  8\n\nreply  that the plaintiffs and DPI have conced ed  that MPS  shall be legally prejudiced by the  \nproposed settlement, (Docket No. 468 at 1).  \nThe proposed settlement is between the plaintiffs and defendant DPI. Nonetheless, many of \nthe provisions set forth in the p roposed settlement agreement create benchmarks that are to be \nachieved by the non-settling defendant MPS. Howeve r, the establishment of such benchmarks per \nse does not mean that MPS’ legal  rights are affected by the settlement. This is because all of the \nobligations that would be im posed upon MPS as a  result of the enforcem ent of this proposed \nsettlement could independently be imposed by DPI  pursuant to its authority as a supervising state \neducational agency (“SEA”) under the IDEA.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11);  see also 20 U.S.C.         \n§ 1413(d). Therefore, in analyzing MPS’ objections, the court turns to the question of whether DPI \nhas the authority to order MPS to take the actions called for in the proposed settlement agreement.  \nIn relevant part, the IDEA provides: \nState educational agency responsible for general supervision. \n \n(A) In general. The State educational agency is responsible for ensuring that— \n \n(i) the requirements of this part [20 USCS §§ 1411 et seq.] are met; \n \n(ii)  all  educational  programs  for  children  with disab ilities  in the State,  \nincluding all such programs administered by any other State agency or lo cal \nagency— \n \n(I) are under the general supervis ion of individuals in the State who \nare responsible for educational programs for children with disabilities; \nand \n \n(II) meet the educational standards of the State educational agency; \n \n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).  \n \nSimilarly, Wisconsin Statute § 115.90, the provi sion outlining what m ay occur if a local \neducational  agency fails to com ply  with W isconsin  law relating to the education of disabled \nstudents, provides: \n  9\n\n(1) If, as the result  of a monitoring procedure or a  complaint investigation, the state \nsuperintendent finds that a local educational agency has violated this subchapter, the \nstate superintendent may require the local educational agency to submit a corrective \nplan addressing the violation. \n \n(2) If the state superintendent, after r easonable notice and an opportunity for a \nhearing,  finds that a local educational  agency  has failed to com ply  with any \nrequirement in this subchapter, the state  superintendent shall reduce or elim inate \nspecial education aid to the local educational agency until he or she is satisfied that \nthe local educational agency is complying with that requirement. \n \n(3) If the state superintendent finds that a corrective plan under sub. (1) has not been \nimplemented, or that withholding aid under su b. (2) has been inadequate to ensure \ncompliance with this subchapter, the state superintendent shall request the attorney \ngeneral  to proceed ag ainst  the lo cal  educational  agency  for injunctive or oth er \nappropriate relief. \n \n  In exercising its authority over MPS, DPI’s ultimate sanction is controlling the purse strings; \nin other words, its available enforcement mechanism is primarily the actual or threat of withholding \nfunds. See id.; see also 20 U.S.C. § 1413(d)(1). W hen it comes to funding, MPS retains certain \nprocedural rights to challenge DPI’s withholding of funds, including an appeal to the Secretary of \nEducation. See 34 C.F.R. § 76.401. MPS argues that proposed settlement unfairly infringes upon its \nlegal rights by foreclosing its opportunity to seek review of DPI’s orders. \nThe plaintiffs and DPI are explicit in their reply in stating that the proposed settlement does \nnot expand DPI’s authority to withhold funds from MPS and would not foreclose MPS’ procedural \nrights to challenge any withholding of funds by DPI. (Docket No. 456 at 19.) From the court’s own \nreview of the proposed settlem ent, there is nothing in the docum ent that affects MPS’ right to \nchallenge DPI’s withholding of funds; MPS’ pr ocedural right to challenge any action by DPI  \nremains  unaffected  by this se ttlement.  The settle ment  could be viewed as essentially another \ncorrective action, similar to any one of the num erous other corrective  action plans previously \nestablished by DPI.  \nAnother objection raised by MPS i s that it has com e into compliance with the IDEA, thus  \nnegating the need for prospective relief.  MPS ar gues that the proposed set tlement takes away its \n  10\n\nability to challenge prospective relief in Phase III.  The correction of th e systemic problems found \nby the court in Phase II would be an issue for this court to resolve in Phase III, but the question of \ncompliance with the IDEA is not solely for the court. Rather, compliance with the IDEA is first and \nforemost the responsibility of DPI. This court’s  authority regarding compliance exists by virtue of \nthe plaintiffs’ suit and the determination of DPI’s violations. This action in no way limits the ability \nof DPI to address the failures within MPS to comply with its obligations under the IDEA. By doing \nso,  as evidenced in the proposed   settlement  agreement,  DPI relieves this court of the time  \nconsuming task of receiving evidence and making prospective relief determinations in Phase III. \nLooking at the obligations imposed upon MPS within the context of being pursuant to DPI’s \nsupervisory  authority, the proposed settlem ent  is  not challengeable by MPS for i mproperly \ninfringing upon MPS’ legal rights. MPS retains its procedural rights to object to any action by DPI, \nand, in particular, the withholding of funds, if it should come to that. Even though DPI has statutory \nauthority to impose corrective action upon MPS, the court by virtue of approving the settlem ent \ndoes give its imprimatur and independent authority  to same. But, for the reason s stated, the court \nfinds that by exercising its authority in approving the proposed settlement, it has not diminished the \nlegal rights of MPS. \nAs for MPS’ distinct but related arguments that the proposed settlement agreement infringes \nupon MPS’ rights to discipline students and to  determine which students should be retained, the \ncourt  does not find that these argum ents  are su fficient  to warrant rejection of the propose d \nsettlement agreement.  \nIt appears that MPS’ objection to the se ttlement on the basis of its impact upon MPS’ \nresponsibilities regarding suspended students is based upon a  misunderstanding of the nature and \nconsequences of the proposed settlement agreement. MPS argues, “Pursuant to the proposed class \nsettlement, however, the school could not suspend the [hypothetical disruptive fourth grade] student \n  11\n\nfor longer than [10 days], even if it had  no reasonable suspicion whatsoever that the student might \nhave a disability.” (Do cket No. 452 at 18.) L ater, after citing num erous examples of students \nsuspended for more than the threshold number of days, MPS alleges it “would not have been able to \nsuspend or refer for ex pulsion either student as they had accum ulated the threshold number of \nsuspension days in a school year – according to the class settlement – and instead would have to be \nreferred to a ‘system of early intervention services.’” (Docket No. 452 at 21.) Parenthetically, the \ncourt notes that many of the suspensions cited by MPS as examples that “occur with frequency in \nthe District,” involve suspensions for truancy and tardiness. (See Docket No. 452 at 20.) As pointed \nout by DPI and the plaintiffs in  reply, state law explicitly prohibits MPS from suspending students \nfor truancy or tardiness.  See Wis. Stat. § 120.13(1)(d);  see also Wis. Stat. § 118.16(c). However, \nMPS’ compliance or non-compliance with state law regarding suspending students for truancy and \ntardiness is an issue beyond the scope of this litigation.  \nIn  no way does the settlem ent  agreement  prohibit  MPS from  suspending or otherwise \ndisciplining students to the full extent authorized by law. Quite the contrary, the effectiveness of the \nsettlement agreement in identifying students whose  discipline problems m ay  be caused by an \nundetected disability depends largely upon MPS utilizing suspensions in much the same way that it \nhas in the past. It says that students who are suspended ten days or more during a school year “shall \nbe referred to a system of early intervention services.” (Docket No. 431-2 at 6.) The court fails to \nsee how this abrogates the ability of MPS to discipline students. It simply establishes a threshold for \ntaking a closer look at the disciplined student. \nGranted, to some degree, the costs or time likely to be incurred by MPS in making a referral \n“to  a syste m  of early   intervention  services”  may  act to dissuade MPS from surpass ing  the \nsuspension threshold of ten days, but the court is una ble to conclude that this subtle disincentive \nconstitutes an infringement upon MPS’ statutory right to discipline students.  \n  12\n\nFurther, MPS argues that the proposed settlem ent agreement should be rejected because it \nwould  provide the Independent E xpert  with th e  “authority to overturn MPS’ suspension and \nexpulsion decisions.” (Docket No. 452 at 22.) Wisconsin law provides that decisions regarding the \nsuspension or expulsion of student s are within the authority of lo cal school boards. Wis. Stat. §§ \n119.04, 120.13(1)(b)(2); see also Wis. Stat. § 119.18(21).  \nThe court finds nothing in the proposed settlem ent agreement that would e mpower the \nIndependent Expert to overturn a disciplinary  decision of MPS. There is nothing in the proposed \nsettlement agreement to suggest that the referral to early intervention services is designed to replace \na suspension imposed by MPS, but rather referral is an additional step that DPI has determined MPS \nmust undertake to comply with the IDEA’s Child Find obligations.  \nAs for MPS’ objection to the proposed settlement agreement with regards to the retention of \nstudents, MPS objects on the basis that the retention of students was not a basis for liability in Phase \nII and that the agreement would strip MPS of its au thority to make rules regarding the retention of \nstudents. The court finds that, for m any of the same reasons discussed above with respect to \nsuspension of students, the proposed settlement does not improperly infringe upon MPS’ authority \nto make retention decisions for its students.  \nAlthough the court did not m ake any finding of  MPS’ retention policies being a source of  \nsystemic IDEA violations in MPS, the fact that this matter was not at issue in this litigation does not \npreclude DPI from exercising its supervisory authority under the IDEA and determining that MPS \nmust undertake corrective action. In the give-and-take of settlement discussions, the parties are free \nto include matters beyond those before the court. For example, a c ourt cannot order a tortfeasor to \napologize to a plaintiff, but an apology can certainly be a term of a private settlement. It is pursuant \nto its supervisory authority that DPI may order the changes called f or in proposed settlement  \n  13\n\nagreement, and thus the court does not find that  MPS’ arguments merit rejection of the proposed \nsettlement agreement.  \nHaving addressed and rejected many of MPS’ specific objections to the proposed settlement \nagreement, the court shall turn to the m ore general questions of whether the proposed settlement is \nfair, reasonable, and adequate and in doing so the court shall address the remaining concerns raised \nby MPS.  \nDPI’s failure to supervise MPS’ compliance with the IDEA contributed to the s ystemic \nfailures the court found in the Phase II. Therefor e, any remedy imposed, whether as a result of a  \nsettlement agreement or an order of this court,  must address these systemic failings and DPI’s lax \noversight.  \nThe remedies called for in the prop osed settlement agreement are entirely prospective and \nthus do not directly compensate any class member for any injury suffered by the class member. For \nexample, the settlement does not call for any cl ass member to receive com pensatory education. \nMPS objects to the se ttlement on the basis tha t it leaves it entirely liable for any com pensation \nsought by the class. (Docket No. 452 at 24-25.)  \nThe fact that the settlement does not provide any direct benefit for the members of the class \ndoes not render the proposed settlement agreement unfair, unreasonable, or inadequate. This case \nhas always involved much m ore than simply obtaining relief for each class m ember; creating \ncomprehensive change in the manner in which special education is addressed by MP S has formed \nthe foundation of this litigation fr om the plaintiffs’ perspective. And this proposed settlement does \nmuch to accomplish this goal. In fact, it accom plishes more than what might have been achieved \nhad this case fully continued th rough Phase III. For example, as  discussed above, the proposed \nsettlement addresses MPS’ retention of students,  a matter that was not a basis f or this court’s \nliability determination and would not have been the subject of remedial relief. \n  14\n\nSimilarly, the court did not explicitly find that DPI and MPS violated the IDEA by failing to \nprovide  parents with adequate  support  and infor mation  to eff ectively  navigate MPS’ special \neducation bureaucracy, but nonethel ess, as was m ade clear by the  numerous stories told by the \nrepresentative plaintiffs’ parents during Phase II, there was substa ntial room for improvement. The \nproposed settlement agreement addresses this concern by requiring DPI to fund a fulltim e position \nto coordinate and facilitate parents’ involvement in MPS’ special education system. This settlement \nprovision, although again not a direct benefit to the class members, should prove to be a substantial \nasset for other parents who face the sam e or similar struggles, as did the represen tative plaintiffs’ \nparents. Thus, this provision shall serve to aid  in remedying the systemic Child Find failures that \nformed the basis for MPS and DPI’s liability, at least until MPS meets the goals established by the \nproposed settlement agreement and DPI’s obligation to fund the position terminates.  \nFurther, this agreement is not merely a corrective action plan by which DPI promises to do a \nbetter job monitoring MPS’ compliance with the IDEA. Rather, the proposed settlement agreement \nrepresents a truly differe nt approach by having the Independe nt Expert undertake the substantive \nrole in ensuring MPS’ compliance, a responsibility that DPI failed to effectively discharge during \nthe years in question. \nAt the April 17, 2008, conference with the parties, the court raised a significant concern with \nthe proposed settlement agreement, that being the 95% compliance rate. The IDEA does not call for \nsome percentage of compliance, but rather calls for full com pliance, i.e. a 100% com pliance rate. \nHowever, when dealing with a larg e urban school district with thousands of disabled students, the  \nabsence of 100% com pliance does not necessaril y constitute systemic noncompliance with the \nIDEA.  \nCertainly, if 95% compliance is attained, violations of the IDEA are still occurring. Even if \nMPS were to m eet the standards  set forth in the proposed  settlement agreement, the rights of as \n  15\n\nmany as 5% of MPS’ disabled students m ay be violated. Of course, the la w provides each one of \nthese students with the right to pursue an indivi dual claim against MPS. But this litigation was not \ncontesting a failure of procedural rights, it was addressing system ic failures. Based upon what has \nbeen presented in Phases I and II of this litigation, the court is of the opinion that a 95% compliance \nrate in these key areas is sufficient and appropria te to remedy the systemic failures the court found \nin Phase II. This is particularly true because  the 95% compliance rate is to be m easured by \nindividual  school, rather than district-wide. Th erefore,  because one could assum e  that certain \nschools would exceed the 95% m inimum compliance rate, while others m ay just squeak by, the \ndistrict’s overall compliance rate will necessarily be higher than 95%.  \nMPS argues that m easurement by school is inappropriate b ecause certain schools are too  \nsmall to permit for a meaningful sample. For ex ample, certain MPS schools have fewer than 5 \ninitial referrals for evaluation in  each school year, (Aff.  Patricia A. Yahle, Docket No. 453 at 7, \n¶30), and thus a single untimely initial evaluation in a school with few disabled students may result \nin MPS failing to meet the standards established in the proposed settlement agreement for a given \nyear. However, because special education services are administered largely at the individual school \nlevel in MPS, the court finds that measuring compliance by school is not only appropriate, but will \nbe more effective. Based on the ev idence presented at Phases I and II, district-wide com pliance \nmeasuring was very in adequate in the challenged areas. Further, the cour t finds that the higher \nstandard established by measuring compliance by school rather than  district-wide is appropriate to \nremedy MPS’ systemic failures.  \nWith respect to the 95% compliance rate, the court notes a different standard in regard to the \nmeasurement for retained students.  It is clear that the 95% compliance rate is to be m easured by \neach school for timely initial evaluations, (Docket No. 431-2 at 4), p arental participation in initial \nIEP team meetings, (Docket No.  431-2 at 5), and referrals of  suspended students who surpass a \n  16\n\nthreshold number of suspension days, (Docket No.  431-2). In contrast, the proposed settlem ent in \nregard to retained students states, “As m easured during a twelve (12) month period as designed \nwithin the Compliance Plan, ninety-five percent (95%) of MPS students who are retained in a grade \nshall be referred to a system of early intervention services . . . .”  (Docket No. 431-2 at 7.) Thus, \nunless the court is misreading or misinterpreting this statement, it appears that compliance with this \nprovision shall be measured on a district-wide basis.  \nUnlike the parental par ticipation and timely evaluation requirements, the IDEA does not \nrequire a referral to early intervention services  for students who are retained. Rather, the IDEA \nsimply requires appropriate systems be in place to ensure that a lo cal school district is identifying \nstudents with disabilities, and DPI has determined that this referral system is necessary for MPS to \ncomply with its Child Find obligations. Becau se the referral process set forth in  the proposed \nsettlement agreement is not required by the IDEA, the court finds evalua ting compliance with the \nrequirement that MPS refer retained students to a system of early intervention services on a district-\nwide rather than individual school basis is appropriate.  \nThe court notes that the proposed settlement agreement does not define what shall constitute \n“a system of early intervention services,” other than to say that this system shall be approved by the \nIndependent Expert and “designed to timely address the students’ [academic or] behavior issues that \nresulted in suspension [or retention] and which shall include the possibility of referral of the student \nfor an evaluation to determine if the student is a student with a disability.” (Docket No. 431-2 at 6, \n7.)  It appears that all parties are deferring to   the judgment of the Independent Expert for a  \ndetermination of what sorts of services shall be sufficient, and thus it appears  that the parties are \nasking the court to likewise defer to the Independent Expert. Having reviewed the curriculum vitae \nof  proposed Independent Expert  Alan  Coulter, the court finds   him  amply  qualified to make \n  17\n\nappropriate judgments as to the nature of the early intervention services that shall be provided, and \ntherefore the court finds that deferring to the Independent Expert in this respect is appropriate.  \nFinally, the proposed settlem ent provides for a paym ent of attorney’s fees to plaintiffs’  \ncounsel by DPI in the am ount of $475,000. Currently pe nding before the court is the plaintiffs’ \npetition for interim attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $1,319,898.89. That motion was filed \non October 12, 2007. The court recognizes that the plain tiffs are prevailing parties in this action by \nvirtue of its September 11, 2007 decision, but the tota l interim amount of attorney’s fees and costs \nwhich should be awarded pursuant to the fee shifting provision of the IDEA and Wisconsin statutes \nhas not been decided. \n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B) provides for an interim award of fees. The court is of the opinion \nthat plaintiffs are entitled to an award of inter im fees. This litigation has been protracted and  all \nparties have incurred substantial legal expense. The court need not resolve the plaintiffs’ petition for \ninterim fees at this tim e to reach the conclusion that the sum of $475,000 is fair and reason able. \nFrom the court’s review of the petition and  supporting documentation, and having considered the \ndefendants’ objection, the court would have awarded at least that amount as an interim award. Thus, \nthe court will approve the attorneys’ fees provision of the proposed settlement. \nV. CONCLUSION \n  Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, th e court rejects MPS’ objections and finds the \nproposed settlement fair, reasonable, and adequate. Thus, the court  grants its preliminary approval \nof the proposed settlement agreement.  \nHowever, the court has certain questions with  some of the language of the proposed class \nnotice. Therefore, the court will defer its approv al of the proposed class notice, (Docket No. 431-2 \nat 19-21), until it has an opportunity to discuss its concerns with the parties. In addition, the court \nwishes to know the procedures the parties intend to utilize in disseminating the class notice.  \n  18\n\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that the court grants its preliminary approval of the \nproposed class settlement between the plaintiffs and the DPI defendants.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that the court will conduct  a telephone conference with \ncounsel  for the parties to discuss the content  of  the class notice and the procedures for its \ndissemination. The conference shall be held on June 20, 2008 at 10:00 AM.  The court shall initiate \nthe call.  \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 6th day of June 2008. \n \n \n             s/AARON E.

APPENDIX.............................................................................................................................72 \nI. PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n  On September 13, 2001, the plaint iffs filed their com plaint, alleging violations under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et  seq. (“IDEA”) and related state \nstatutes, Wis. Stat. §§ 115.758, et seq. Upon the written  consent of the parties to the exercise of \njurisdiction by the magistrate judge, the case was reassigned  to this court on November 28, 2001. \nThe court then issued its scheduling order establishing a tim e frame for pretrial discovery and for \nfiling a motion seeking class certification. On November 7, 2002, the  plaintiffs filed their motion \nfor class certification seeking to  proceed on their claims within the context of a class action. Th e \ndefendants filed their opposition to the motion, and on May 23, 2003, the court, in its Decision and \nOrder Regarding Class Certification, directed the plaintiffs to submit an amended class certification \nmotion because the court determined that a number of the plaintiffs’ claim s were subject to the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement, pursuant to the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).  The \ncourt concluded that some of the plaintiffs’ claims were not systemic in nature, identifying these as \n“post-determination” claims. The court reasoned that th ese claims were subject to adm inistrative \nexhaustion because they are individual and substantive in nature and each alleged  wrong could be \npotentially remedied through the administrative process outlined in the IDEA. The c ourt identified \nthe other claims as “pre-determination” claims and concluded that these could be system ic or \nprocedural in nature. As such, th ese claims had the potential for cl ass certification. The plaintiffs \nwere required to file an amended motion for class certification limited to the pre-determ ination \nclaims. \n  On June 23, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their  amended motion for class certification, which \nsought class certification based upon the claims as narrowed by the court’s May 23, 2003 order. On \n  3\n\nAugust 1, 2003, the court issued a second Decision and Order, which directed the plaintiffs to file a \nsecond amended motion for class certification  because, in the court’s opinion, both the plaintiffs \nand the defendants misconstrued the May 23, 2003, decision and order.  Ultimately, on November \n14, 2003, this court entered its third  Decision and Order, and at that tim e, defined the class as  \nfollows:  \nThose students eligible for special educat ion services from the Milwaukee Public \nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delay ed entry or \nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between \nthe IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \n \n  At this point, a number of other motions were filed, including the Milwaukee Public Schools \n(“MPS”) defendants’ motion to dismiss certain claims as not typical of the class an d the plaintiffs’ \nmotion to compel production of materials from the United States Department of Justice. The court \nruled on these motions and then met with the parties to discuss appropriate notice to the class, and a \ndiscovery schedule for expert witn esses. After notice to the class was given and expert discovery \ncompleted, the court requested that the parties file a joint stipulated statement of facts, together with \nsummaries of their res pective expert witnesses. Based upon the subm issions, and in an effort to \navoid the time consuming process involved in summary judgm ent motions, the court decided to \nbifurcate  trial pro ceedings,  and first condu ct  a  court  trial for exp ert  witnesses. After some  \nrescheduling, the court trial involving expert witnesses (referred to as Phase I) commenced on \nOctober 18, 2005, and com pleted on November 2, 2005 (the trial did not run continuously during \nthat period). The court heard from six experts. \n  On November 28, 2005, the court held a hearing  at which time the parties were advised of \nthe court’s initial reaction to the experts’ tes timony and conclusions drawn therefrom . The court \ninformed the parties that it woul d be necessary to proceed to Phase II,  which would consist of the \nfactual presentations upon which the experts formed their respective opinions. The trial to the court \nin Phase II began on April 10,  2006, and was concluded on Ap ril 26, 2006. The testim ony of 48 \n  4\n\nwitnesses  was presen ted,  and  numerous  documents  were received in evidence. Post-trial \nsubmissions were filed by the parties in June, 2006.   \n  On September 11, 2007, the court issued its Phase II Decision and Order finding that MPS \nviolated the IDEA’s Child Find req uirements. This violation was not limited to the representative \nplaintiffs but was systemic in nature and violated  the rights of the plaintiff class. Specifically,  the \ncourt held that MPS f ailed to refer children with a suspected disability in a timely manner for an \ninitial  evaluation, i.e. the  90-day  requirement; MPS impr operly  extended the 90-day time  \nrequirement; MPS imposed suspensions in a manner  that improperly impeded its ability to r efer \nchildren with suspected disabilities for an initial evaluation; and MPS failed to ensure that the \nchild’s parents or guardi ans attend the initial  evaluation. The court f urther concluded that the  \nactions of MPS in not reviewing all d ata to determine the exact nature of the child’s disability, \nwhile violations in individual cases, did not constitute systemic violations of the IDEA. \n  Finally, the court concluded that during th e time period from September, 2000 to June , \n2005, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction defendants (“DPI”) violated the IDE A and \nrelated state statutes by failing to adequately discharge its oversight and supervisory obligations in \nregard to the compliance by MPS with the ID EA and related state statutes, as that com pliance \nrelated to the systemic violations found by the court.   \n  In  light of this court’s   finding  of  liability,  the court p roceeded  towards  Phase  III, the \nremedies phase of this matter.  \n  On April 7, 2008, the plaintiffs and DPI filed  a joint motion seeking the court to approve a \nsettlement agreement between the plaintiffs and DPI. Following a period of briefing in which MPS \nvoiced its objections to the proposed settlement, on June 6, 2008, this court granted its prelim inary \napproval of the proposed class settlem ent. On July 1, 2008 this court approved the proposed class \nnotice, and a final fairness hearing was held before this court Ju ly 28, 2008. The court received no \n  5\n\nwritten objection and no objector appeared at the final fairness hearing. Therefore, on July 28, 2008, \nthe court approved the class settlement and dismissed DPI from this case.  \nThe settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and DPI addresses the three specific areas \nof systemic violations found by the court in Phase II, namely, MPS’ failure to conduct timely initial \nevaluations, MPS’ failure to ensure that a child’s parent or guardian participated in an initial IEP \nmeeting, and the utilization of suspensions in a m anner that impeded the ability of MPS to refer  \nchildren who may be suffering from a disability for an initial evaluation. (Docket No. 431-2 at 4-7.)  \n  The settlement agreement provides that MPS  shall conduct 95% of its initial evaluations \nwithin the required time period or the time period shall be properly extended, for two consecutive \nyears. (Docket No. 431-2 at 4-5.) Similarly, the settlement agreement calls for MPS to have a parent \nor guardian present for an initial IEP meeting or for MPS to m ake reasonable efforts to ensure the \nparent or guardian’s participation, in 95% of its initial IEP meetings for a period of two consecutive \nyears. (Docket No. 431-2 at 5-6.) Finally, the settlement calls for MPS, in two consecutive years, to \nrefer 95% of students in kinderg arten through fifth grade who ar e suspended ten or m ore days \nduring a school year and 95% of students in sixth through twelfth grades who are suspended twenty \nor more days in a school year to a “system of early intervention services . . . designed to address the \nstudents’ behavior issues that resulted in suspen sions and which shall incl ude the possibility of \nreferral of the student for an evaluation to determ ine if the student is a student with a disability.”  \n(Docket No. 431-2 at 6-7.) \n  Compliance with these agreed-upon benchm arks shall be evaluated by a court-appointed \nindependent expert, whom the parties agreed should be Alan Coulter. (Docket No. 431-2 at 7-12.)  \nThis independent expert shall be paid for by  DPI. (Docket No. 431-2 at 8.) The 95% com pliance \nrate shall be measured in each individual MPS school for the timeliness of initial evaluations, parent \n  6\n\nor  guardian  participation  in in itial  IEP m eetings,  and with respect to   compliance  regarding \nsuspended students.  \n  Further, the settlement agreement calls for MPS, in two consecutive years, to refer 95% of \nMPS students who are retained in a given school  year and are not identified as suf fering from a \ndisability “to a system of early intervention services approved by the Independent Expert designed \nto timely address the students’ academic or behavior issues that resulted in retention and which shall \ninclude the possibility of referral of the student for an evaluation to  determine if the student is a \nstudent with a disability.” (Docket No. 431-2 at 7.) The 95% compliance is not referenced to “each \nschool,”  and  programs  for the referred s tudents  will be  implemented  with an  80% degree of \nintegrity. Unlike the three issues discussed above, the court has not found any systemic deficiencies \nrelated to the retention of students.  \n  The settlement agreement calls for MPS to ha ve four years to achieve the required two \nconsecutive  years of com pliance  regarding tim ely  initial evaluations and parent or guardian \nparticipation  in initia l  IEP  meetings  and eight years to com ply  with  the  agreement  regarding \nsuspended and retained students.  (Docket No. 431-2 at 14-15.) N on-compliance shall result in a \nhearing before this court for a determination of the remedy. (Docket No. 431-2 at 15.) Compliance \nshall result in termination of the agreement and dismissal with prejudice of the plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst DPI.  \n  Further, the agreement calls for DPI to o rder MPS to provide training to MPS’ staff, as \ndeemed necessary by the Independent Expert, on indi cators of special edu cation needs, referral \nprocedures, and Child Find obligations. (Docket No. 431-2 at 13.) Finally, DPI agrees to provide for \na fulltime professional to train and support parents and MPS staff regarding provisions of the IDEA \nand Child Find obligations for the length of this  agreement, or until DPI’s paym ents for this \nprofessional meets $300,000.00. (Docket No. 431-2 at 13.)  \n  7\n\n  Finally,  DPI agrees to pa y  $475,000.00 in attorneys’ fees  and  costs to class counsel, \nDisability Rights Wisconsin. (Docket No. 431-2 at 18.) \n  On August 15, 2008, this court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for interim attorneys’ fees and \nordered MPS to pay to the plaintiffs’ attorney s an additional $459,123.96 in attorneys’ fees. T he \ncourt denied without prejudice the plaintiffs’ request for interim costs.  \n  On November 6, 2008, a court tr ial, referred to as Phase I II, commenced to determine the \nappropriate remedy for the systemic violations the court found in Phase II. Following the trial, the \ncourt ordered the parties to submit simultaneous post-trial briefs no later than January 16, 2009 and \nsimultaneous replies no later than January 30, 2009. The court also provided the parties with certain \nquestions the court sought the parties to addr ess in their p ost-trial briefs. (Docket No.  566.) The \nmatter is now ready for resolution.  \n  During Phase III, DPI filed a motion seeking a declaration that it is not responsible for any \nfurther remedy that the court may order in Phase III. (Docket No. 559.) The court permitted MPS to \nrespond and DPI to reply. The pleadings on this  motion are closed and the m atter is ready for \nresolution.  \nII. SUMMARY OF PHASE III \nA. Patricia Yahle \n  Patricia Yahle (“Yahle”), MPS’  Director of Special Services, was called adversely by the \nplaintiffs and directly by MPS, testifying as both the first and last witness in this phase of trial. Set \nforth here is a summary of all of her testimony in Phase III.  \nYahle’s responsibilities are largely the same as those she had when she last testified in 2006 \nalthough the No Child Left Behind legislation  has added additional responsibilities for her. Under \nNo Child Left Behind, MPS has been identified as a “District Identified for Improvement,” and this \nhas imposed additional requirements for the district.  \n  8\n\n  Yahle testified that according to MPS’ IEP Team Procedural Handbook, Revised September, \n2007, (Ex. 402), the IEP team has a responsibility to determine whether compensatory education or \nservices are appropriate “[a]ny ti me any school st aff member becomes aware that a student wit h \nspecial education needs has receiv ed inappropriate or insufficien t education services.” (Ex. 402.) \nUltimately, it is a complex decision left to the professionals on the IEP team to determine what type \nof service is needed to bring the child to the place he would be if appropriate education had not been \ndenied, but one that is regularly conducted by MPS’ IEP teams. For example, all students identified \nin Exhibit 197 (2003-2004 school  year) whose evaluations occurr ed beyond the 90-day deadline \nwere evaluated for compensatory education; she directed that all students, from 2000 forward, who \nwere identified late for special education, be evaluated for compensatory education. However, when \npresented with Exhibit 401, (for 2000-2005 school  years), a list of students whose evaluations \noccurred beyond the 90-day deadline, she could offe r no explanation as to why very few of the se \nstudents had a “Y” in the column titled “Discussed Comp Ed.” Yahle testified she had not seen this \nexhibit in a while.  \nWhen a student is referred late to special  education, MPS’ existing procedures require the \nIEP team to make a determination if that individual was denied FAPE as a result of that delay. The \ncompensatory services that might be awarded may be equivalent in duration to the time the student \nwas denied FAPE but a 1:1 equivalence would not be appropriate in every case. Each compensatory \neducation  determination,  like each referral or   special education determ ination,  must  be \nindividualized.  \n  As for the roughly 11,000 students who were suspended ten or more days in any school year \nbetween 2000 and 2005, (Ex. 400), Yahle does not know if any of these students were evaluated for \nspecial education, but testified  that Child Find is an ongoing pr ocess. The only way MPS coul d \n  9\n\nlearn  if these studen ts  were referred for spec ial  education would be the exceptionally time -\nconsuming process of physically reviewing all 11,000 student file folders.  \n  With respect to MPS’ proposed remedy, Yahle te stified that it was craf ted so as to enable \nMPS to best utilize its limited resources. For example, students who are no longer enrolled in MPS \nwho have a history of suspensi ons, students whose IEP was delayed less than 10 days beyond the  \n90-day deadline, or students olde r than 22 years of age, would  be excluded from any potential \nremedy.  If a student w as  found to be eligible fo r  compensatory  education, the nature of the \ncompensatory education determined to be appropriate would determine where that service would be \nprovided.   \n  Yahle believes that MPS has the staff and resources to be able to ef fectively monitor the \nimplementation of any court ordered rem edy and to assist parents in the process, and therefore an \noutside monitor or parent advocate, as are called for under the  plaintiffs’ proposed remedy, would \nbe unnecessary. Further, Yahle testified that th e plaintiffs’ proposed remedy of giving all class \nmembers their first choice of school would be unworkable for MPS.  \n  In April of 2004, MPS implemented a protocol for automatically considering compensatory \neducation at the time of the initial IEP team meeting for each case in which the m eeting did not \noccur within the statutory timeline. For students whose IEP team meetings were delayed before the \nimplementation of this new protocol, MPS review ed a list of students whose IEP team  meetings \nwere delayed more than 10 days and identified  221 students who were current students who were \neligible for special education or whose eligibility had not yet been determ ined. A worksheet was \ndeveloped for auditors to rely  upon in conducting a review of  these 221 student files. These \nauditors, all of whom were experienced IEP team leaders, were tasked with determining whether the \ninformation in the da tabase regarding the delay was accurate and to gather so me preliminary \ninformation for the next step of the evaluation. Th is audit, (Ex. 461), reve aled that of the 221 \n  10\n\nstudents,  48 required an additional IEP team  meeting  to assess th e  need for com pensatory \neducation.  Of these 48 students,  the  IEP team   determined that   compensatory  education was  \nappropriate for 7. As part of th is process, it was necessary for the IEP team to determine at what \npoint the student was denied FAPE. Yahle ackno wledged that MPS has not conducted any review \nof students whose initial review was delayed after April of 2004.  \n  Since this court’s September 11, 2007 decision, MPS has upgraded its technology to make it \neasier to calculate and track th e relevant dates in the special education referral process and track \nIEPs, increased its Child Find training of staff m embers, and strengthened parent participation, \namong many other things.  \n  B. Kina K. \n  Kina K. is the m other of Jamie S. Jamie’s problems began when she was in K-4 in the \nWauwatosa School District. She wa s referred for special education  but was not identified because \nWauwatosa was not her hom e district and thus , she was told MPS was required to conduct the \nevaluation. MPS told her that they would monitor Jamie.  \n  In May of 2001, after Jamie was required to repeat the 1st grade for the third time, she was \nevaluated, found eligible for special  education, and an IEP put in  place. Jamie has had an IEP in \nplace every year since 2001, including years Jamie was not enrolled in MPS, and Kina has regularly \nparticipated in Jamie’s IEP meetings. Frequently, Jamie was unable to m eet her IEP goals. At no \npoint  was com pensatory  education  ever discu ssed  with Kina, and Jam ie  has never received \ncompensatory education. However, during an  April 16, 2007 IEP m eeting, a meeting attended by \nKina, Jamie, and a representative from DRW, MPS recommended that Jamie attend summer school. \nJamie declined because she prefers to spend the summers in Chicago with her grandmother.  \nCurrently, Jamie is 15 years old and in the 9th  grade at Wisconsin Career Academy. This is \nJamie’s second year in 9th grade. According to  her more than three-inch thick file, (Ex. 215A), \n  11\n\nJamie reads at an early 2nd grade  level, writes at a beginning 3rd  grade level, and has 4th grade  \nmath skills, (Ex 215A at 94807). Jam ie also has a long history of significant attendance problems. \nFor example, as of October 7, 2008, Jamie attended her 1st hour class only once, and had missed 14 \nfull days of school so far this school year; however  some of these full-day absences were due to a  \npsychiatric hospitalization. (Ex. 215A at 94808.) Sometimes Jamie misses school intentionally or as \na result of suspensions. (Ex. 215A  at 87549). However, Kina is frequently unaware of Jamie being \ntruant or suspended because Jamie destroys correspondence from the school. (Ex. 215A at 87549.) \nJamie was offered the opportunity to participate in  a career program but was required to m aintain \nperfect attendance to be eligible for the program. Jamie continued to frequently miss school.  \nAccording to her IEP, Jamie is able to perform ordinary household chores, estimate money, \nbaby-sit, but should continue to  work on skills such as reading  a menu, measurements skills, and \nmath and budgeting. (Ex. 215A at 94808.)  \nC. Jamie S.  \nJamie does not like going to school because she is teased by other students for doing easier \nwork and she has only one friend. S he gets frustrated. Her special education math class consists of \ncopying a checkbook, and doing worksheets on multiplication, addition, and subtraction. She is in a \nregular education biology class  but her teacher is hard to follow because she speaks Spanish. \nJamie’s special education teacher gives her add itional science assignments, such as looking  up \nscience pictures on the internet and writing a description of the picture.  \nIn her reading class, she is supposed to read  silently to herself for about 10 minutes, but she \ndoes not understand what she is supposed to be reading so she stops reading and just sits there. The \nteacher then will read to the class but the teacher does not offer any explanations. And then sh e is \nsupposed  to write in her journal but she does  not  do this because sh e  once wrote personal \ninformation in her journal that was reported back to her mother.  \n  12\n\nJamie likes her history class because the teacher provides explanations. However, on cross-\nexamination, Jamie admitted she had been to history class only once in the last six weeks.  \nIn the special education room she goes on the computer to “Blink” and meets people. Some \nof the males she has met online she has met in person.  \nJamie has not been taught job skills and she is not involved in any school activities. One day \nshe would like to become a nursing assistant like her mother. She believes she needs more help and \nif she received more help, she would attend more.  \nIn an effort to accomm odate Jamie, MPS permitted her to begin her school day at 10 AM \nbut she still failed to attend. Teachers have come to  her home to discuss her attendance problems. \nWhen she was told that she would fail 9th grade if she did not attend that last two days, she still did \nnot attend. Although her teachers offe red to help her after school, she  refused to stay late because \nshe had “other things to do” at hom e. Similarly, she refused to attend summer school because she \nspends summers with family in Chicago.  \nD. Erin Goff \nErin Goff (“Goff”) is the Program  Director for Creative Employment Opportunities, a for-\nprofit company that contracts w ith various governmental organizations to provide em ployment \nservices for persons with disabilities and other  employment barriers. The company at times does \nreceive school district referrals as part of a student’s IEP.  Client s receive individualized services \ntailored to their unique needs. An internship might be appropriate for a person such as Jam ie and \nunlike Wisconsin Career Academy, Goff would not condition eligibility for the internship upon \nschool attendance. Creative Employment Opportunities has contracts with school districts, but not  \nwith MPS.  \n \n \n  13\n\nE. Claudia Weaver Hendrickson \nClaudia  Weaver  Hendrickson (“Hendrickson”)  is  a MPS Special Education Leadership  \nLiaison (“SELL”), and has been since 2003. She is  a member of Yahle’s management team in \ncharge of special education training including issues relating to compensatory education.  \nShe testified that compensatory education must be viewed on an individualized basis, first \ndetermining whether the student was denied FAPE.  She acknowledged that in determining whether \nFAPE was denied as a result of a delay, or whethe r the student had no prior IEP, it is necessary to \nrely upon the best judgm ent of professionals to determine where the student would be had FAPE \nbeen provided on a timely basis. Determining whether or not a student was denied FAPE and if so, \nwhat type of compensatory services are necessary will require an evaluation of a variety of factors, \nincluding how long was the delay, what are the child ’s needs, and what services the child receiv ed \nin the past. Compensatory education must be above and beyond what the child is now receiving;  \notherwise, it is not compensatory.  \nHendrickson supervised an au dit of files for students whos e initial evaluations occurred \nbeyond the 90-day deadline without  a valid extension betw een September of 2000 and April of \n2004. (See Ex. 461.) As Yahle also testified, MPS id entified 487 students who m et these criteria \nand determined that 221 of these student files  needed to be reviewed. (Ex. 461.) MPS excluded \nstudents who were no longer enrolled in MPS or  who were not initially  reviewed by MPS. (Ex. \n461.) As a result of this review, it was determined that it was necessary to reconvene the IEP teams \nfor 48 students.  As a result, the IEP teams determined that compensatory education was appropriate \nfor 7 of these 48 students. (Ex. 461.)  \nSince 2004, IEP teams have been required to report whether or not compensatory education \nis discussed during an initial IEP meeting. Hendri ckson said that Exhibit 336 indicates whether or  \nnot compensatory education was discussed in a pa rticular case.  She, however, acknowledged that \n  14\n\nthis record may not be entirely accurate since some educators turned in the proper data and others \ndid not. \nFinally,  she testified that only on rare  occasion  will she question an IEP team ’s \ncompensatory education determination; on less than 10 occasions has she asked for an IEP to \nconvene specifically to consider compensatory education.  \nF. Audrey Potter \nAudrey Potter (“Potter”) is MPS’ Coordi nator of Psychological,  Speech, Language, and \nHealth Services, and is  also a part of Yahle’s m anagement team. Potter supervises 150 school \npsychologists in the district.  \nPotter testified that compensatory education is viewed as part of the IEP process. In regard \nto this case the MPS s taff has not received a ny specific training regarding how  to determine \ncompensatory education for class members who should have been evaluated earlier.  \nG. Kim Brizendine \nKim Brizendine (“Brizendine”) is a Special Services Inform ation Management Systems \nsupervisor for MPS. Her responsibilities include  data tracking and m anaging software to com ply \nwith the IDEA’s 2004 amendments. She discussed Exhibits 401 and 336 and stated that if there is a \n“Y” (“Yes”) in the compensatory education colu mn, it shows that compensatory education was \ndiscussed. However, the absence  of a “Y” does not m ean that compensatory education was never \ndiscussed because the report simply documents an isolated point in time.  \nH. Christine Shaver \nChristine Shaver (“Shaver”) is a self-employed special education advocate living in East \nTroy, Wisconsin. She is generally  contracted by county hum an services departments or hired by \nprivate clients.  She has been doing this contra ct work since May of 2003. The children she works \nwith have serious emotional or mental health needs. Not all are in spe cial education. Nearly all of \n  15\n\nthese children attend MPS. She refe rred 7-8 of these students to special education and she went to \nIEP team meetings for these 7-8 students. At none of these meetings was the issue of compensatory \neducation raised by MPS. On the other hand, neither did Shaver raise the issue. She testified that \nshe did not raise the issue of com pensatory education because she was concerned about m oving \nforward.  \nShaver testified that in her experience, advocates are able to assist parents in navigating the \nspecial education process because, although district s provide parents with information, the parents \nare  often not able to understand   the inform ation  they receive.  Even  though the plaintiffs are \nproposing requiring MPS to fund a dvocates as part of their proposed rem edy, she knows that the \nIDEA does not require a school district to provide parent advocates.  \nI. Cynthia J. \nCynthia J. is the m other of Jyran J., a 17- year-old MPS student who was identified for \nspecial education when he was 13 or 14. He was  found eligible for special education in May of \n2005 on the basis of an emotional disorder and a learning disability. Since that time, he was in MPS \nfor  all years, except for one. P rior  to being  found  eligible for specia l  education, Jyran was \nrepeatedly retained in 3rd grade so that he was eventually 12-years-old and still in the 3rd grade. He \nthen transferred schools and was placed into the 7th grade. Therefore, Jyran never attended 4th, 5th, \nor 6th grades.  \nJyran  has a significant truancy problem ;  he  rarely goes to school. Although Cynthia \nacknowledges that Jyran has a significant problem, she believes that the attendance records included \nin Jyran’s file, (Ex. 317A), were f abricated and he was at school m ore often than the records \nindicate. Jyran reports to his mother that he does not go to school because he does not feel like MPS \ncan help him anymore. Jyran has a twin sister who was found eligible for special education in 1999. \nShe does not have a similar truancy problem.  \n  16\n\nAt an IEP team meeting on November 30, 2005, the IEP team concluded that Jyran should \nundergo an hour of “[t]utoring  in all academic areas” twice  a week from December 1, 2005 to \nMarch 31, 2006 “to address com pensatory time.” (Ex. 317A at 95173.) Cynt hia did not request a  \ndue process hearing or otherwise object to this  finding. Immediately after this IEP team  meeting, \nJyran transferred to another school and was truant for nearly the entire period he was supposed to be \nreceiving tutoring. (Ex. 317A at 94897.) Jyran’s trua ncy has continued. From July of 2005 through \nOctober 22, 2008, Jyran was truant for 61 partial days and 330 full days.  \nMPS attempted to accommodate Jyran by, for  example, providing him with a shortened \nschool day, an altered school schedule, and offering door-to-door bus service. (Ex. 317A at 94991, \n95013.) However, Jyran refuses to take the bus and Cynthia told this to MPS.  \nJ. Georgette Rodriguez \nGeorgette Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”), herself di sabled, serves as a volu nteer assistant for \nparents of children with disabilities. She worked for 26 years as an advocate for families with \nspecial needs, and in 2001 she began working for MPS to assist parents as a Parent Inform ation \nSpecialist. She worked for MPS until March of 2007  when she was discharged for violating M PS’ \nleave of absence policy. (See Ex. 465.)  After two years of a ssisting parents and attending IEP \nmeetings, Rodriguez’s duties were lim ited so that she no longer attended  IEP meetings and her \nwork related to advising families regarding disability questions became just one subset of the wider \nduties she was tasked with as an employee of MPS’ Parent Education Center.  \nRodriguez testified as to her disagreement with the policy implemented by the new Director \nof Student Services, which limited her ability to inform parents of their rights regarding disability \nservices. She continued to attempt to inform parents who called the Parent Education Center of their \nrights regarding disability matters but she did so in a “low tone” so as to not let her supervisor know \n  17\n\nwhat  she was doing. She filed a grievance with  the  district contending that her supervisor \ninappropriately restricted her ability to discuss matters with parents.  \nSometimes when she wrote up Parental Dispu te Resolution Forms, she would write “comp. \ned.” on the for m followed by a question m ark when she thought the dispute m ight lead to an \nevaluation for compensatory education, but she is not aware what, if anything, happened as a result \nof these forms. Sometimes she would contact staff members to make inquiries, and sometimes she \nfelt  that she was encountering resistance from   staff  and  administrators.  Rodriguez got the \nimpression that they felt she was over-stepping her bounds.  \nAs part of her duties, Rodriguez would attend disciplinary hearings. When she encountered a \nstudent with a history of suspensions, she may have suggested a special education referral.  \nBased upon her experience, parents are in need  of assistance from advocates in order to \nnavigate the special education system, and if th e court ordered MPS to provide parent advocates, \nshe would like to be one of them.  \nK. Melanie V. \nMelanie’s problems, which included depression, self-injury, and hallucinations, began in 5th \ngrade and she repeatedly m issed school in 6th grad e. Melanie also has a  longstanding history of \nexcessive absences that continued until she left MPS. (See Ex. 214A at 88132.) She was referred \nand found eligible for special education in January of 2004 when sh e was in 7th grade. (Ex. 293 at \n46.) Neither at this initial meeting nor at any subsequent meeting, including those attended by her, \nher mother, and advocates, was compensatory education discussed.  \nOnce she was placed in special education, matters improved slightly for Melanie. While she \nwas in high school, Melanie and her  mother requested that she be removed from special education \nand be given a Section 504 plan instead. (See Ex. 214A at 88131.) This 504 plan was put in place in \nMelanie’s junior year and Melanie was provide d with accommodations similar to those she was \n  18\n\nprovided when in special education. Melanie never made it to her senior year. She no longer wanted \nto go to school; when she did go, she would leave  mid-day because she no longer wanted to b e at \nschool. Her depression worsened. And so she arranged to obtain her GED.  \nWhen she alerted MPS of her intent to withdraw from school, her principal wrote Melanie a \nletter informing her that although she was age 18  and thus MPS could not com pel her to attend, \nMPS encouraged her to continue attending and offered to provide Melanie with additional services \nunder her 504 plan. (Ex. 214A at 94552.) The letter closed, “The district is prepared to provide any \nnecessary accommodations to ensure that you receive appropriate educational services.” (Ex. 214A \nat 94552.)  \nWhile at MPS, she was not provided inform ation on how to create a resume or how to look \nfor a job, but was given career exploration opportuni ties in her junior year . Right now, at age 19, \nMelanie is not interested in looking for a job, and does not have any ideas as to what she might like \nto do for a career in the future, although she is interested in forensic science.  \nL. Bryan E.  \nBryan is currently 20 years old. He was not found eligible for special education until the 9th \ngrade. Prior to that he was required to repeat  the 5th and 7th grades a nd at other tim es he was \npromoted  although he did not m eet  requirements.  Beginning in about 5th grade, Bryan was \nfrequently truant because he di d not like going to school. When  he was at Marshall High School, \nBryan was mistakenly placed in a special education class. When the mistake was discovered, he was \nplaced back into regular education and the work was harder.  \nAfter three requests by his mother, he was placed into special education and Bryan came to \nlike school better and did not m iss as often, alt hough he did continue to  have problems with \nattendance. He appreciated the  one-on-one support he received  and the extra tim e to complete \nassignments that he received as part of his IE P. The issue of compensatory education was nev er \n  19\n\nbrought up at any of his IEP m eetings, although he was frequently  assisted by an advocate from \nDRW. In November of 2006, Bryan was determined to  be no longer eligible for special education. \nHe later contested this determination and was placed back into special education.  \nBryan graduated from Community High School with a regular education diploma in June of \n2007 despite testing at the academic level of a student in 6th or 7th grade. Since graduation, Bryan \nhas had various unskilled jobs, but is currently unemployed and acts as the primary caretaker for his \ndaughter. Prior to graduation, Co mmunity High School assisted Br yan in searching for college  \nscholarships, filling out college applications, and took him on a college visit. However, Bryan did \nnot receive training on filling out job applications or job sha dowing opportunities, but h e was \nprovided with an internship at the Milwaukee Art Museum and at a local barber shop. Bryan would \nlike to continue with his education in order to become an electrician.  \nM. Dr. Diana Rogers-Adkinson \nDr. Diana Rogers-Adkinson, chair of the special  education department at the University of \nWisconsin-Whitewater testified as an expert f or the plaintiffs. Dr. R ogers-Adkinson previously \nserved as an independent educational evaluator for New Berlin public schools as part of a 6-m onth \nIEP process, and has been part of a compensatory education determination for a student in Kenosha. \nShe  was also an expert witness   in a case  in  Kansas w here  summer school was ordered as \ncompensatory education.  \nDr. Rogers-Adkinson described special education  as being distinct from general education \nbecause special education provides a very specialized  service that is geared towards the ind ividual \nstudent and is tailored in a m anner to be most beneficial to that student. A student is required to \nhave a disability and a need for special education services in order to qualify; in other words; it is \npossible to have a disability that  does not translate into a need  for special education.  It is not \n  20\n\nuncommon  for schools to utilize a sy stem  of pre-referral interven tions  as part of the general \neducation process, before deciding to refer a student to special education.  \nStudents who are in special  education at age 14 under W isconsin law, or age 16 under  \nfederal law, may also be provided with transitional services geared towards enabling the student to \ndevelop the necessary skills to  be a productive m ember of society. These may include a wide \nvariety of services such as job coaching or shadowing, recreation and leisure skills, or assisting the \nstudent in obtaining vocational rehabilitation. Thes e services may be provided by the school or an \noutside community organization.  \nTurning to the issues in Phase III of this case,  the age of the child when the denial of FAPE \noccurs is significant in determining the impact of such denial. The impact of denial of FAPE early \nin a student’s educational career, for exam ple between ages 5 and 8 when the ch ild is learning \nprimary  literacy skills,   may  be more signifi cant.  A lag in early  skills  can com pound  later \ndeficiencies. The impact of being denied FAPE may have an impact even after a child’s eligibility \nfor special education is determ ined, as it m ay be more difficult to re-engage the child in the \neducational process.  T his can lead to the stud ent being frustrated, which m ay lead to increased \ntruancy or disruptive classroom behavior.  \nCompensatory education is the remedy for a child who has been denied FAPE.  Determining \nthe  level  of  compensatory  education  that is   appropriate  for a de nial  of FAPE requires a \ndetermination of where the student would be had he received appropriate special education services.  \nCompensatory education services can cover a broad spectrum.  Dr. Rogers-Adkinson testified that \ncompensatory education services can be provided to students who graduated from high school with \na special education diplom a or even to pers ons over age 22. She does not  have any personal \nexperience in providing compensatory services to students who either gra duated from, or dropped \nout of, high school.   \n  21\n\nAddressing the question of whether MPS provided compensatory education to the class, Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson updated her prior analysis built upon the records and methodology that she relied \nupon in Phase II. (See Expert Report, Ex. 445.) In regard to  the 96 student files she reviewed, she \nnow identified a pattern for the students who were  suspended more than 10 days of not being \nprovided compensatory services, even though some of these students were found eligible for special \neducation.  (Ex. 445, Appendix A.) Tables 1-8 in  her  report were crea ted  by an independent \nstatistician; Dr. Rogers-Adkinson did not independently verify the statistician’s work.  \nDr.  Rogers-Adkinson also reviewed 316 file s  of students who were considered for \ncompensatory services in MPS. As a resu lt of this qualitative analysis, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson was \nnot able to identify any pattern regarding the deci sion to award or deny compensatory services. Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson did not find any clear rationale for  the failure to provide compensatory services \nfor 80% of the students. For the students she could determine the rationale for denial, 4 were denied \nbecause the IEP team felt that significant harm did not result from the delay, and others were denied \nbecause the IEP team felt the student was making adequate progress.  \nIn  Dr. Rogers-Adkinso n’s  opinion  it is n ecessary  to ev aluate  whether  a stud ent  needs \ncompensatory services every time there is a denial of FAPE.  \nTo support her conclusions, Dr. Rogers-Adkins on provided examples from various student \nfiles,  which in her opinion, contained deficient  compensatory  education determinations.  She \npointed to a student who was denied com pensatory services because he was receiving double the \nservices called for in his IEP. (See Ex. 411.) Dr. Rogers-Adkinson testified that simply doubling \nspecial education is not necessarily an appropriate means to compensate for a prior denial of FAPE \nbecause it is not necessarily providing the student with what was lost. Additionally, it may result in \nfurther deficiencies because it requires a decrease in regular education services.  \n  22\n\nDr.  Rogers-Adkinson also noted that MPS in appropriately  planned for suspensions in \nadvance for a special education student by stating  in his IEP that he should receive one hour of \nservices after school for every day the student was suspended. (See Ex. 421.)  \nAnother student was determined not to need  compensatory services because, although his \nevaluation was delayed, he went th rough the problem solving model. (See Ex. 408.) Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson regarded this approach  as inappropriate because the probl em solving model is part of \nregular education and regular education cannot substitute for special education.  \nDr. Rogers-Adkinson also testified that she reviewed the files of the named plaintiffs in this \naction, Jamie S., Melanie, and Byran, and determ ined that compensatory services were never \ndiscussed for any of these students.  \nIn the opinion of Dr. Rogers-Adkinson, MPS’ co mpensatory education guidelines, as set \nforth in its IEP Team Procedural Handbook, (Ex. 402), are deficient because, although they provide \na variety of examples, they do not provide very  specific guidelines for helping the IEP team m ake \nits decision. She pointed to the fact that, for ex ample, IEP teams were finding that com pensatory \nservices were not necessary because the student  was receiving twice the services called for unde r \nthe IEP, as evidence that there was a general  misunderstanding of compensatory education among \nIEP teams.  \nAs a remedy for the class, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson testified that, in her opinion, compensatory \nservices must be delivered on a 1:1 basis where th e amount of compensatory services received is \nequivalent to the time period the student was denied FAPE. She tes tified that this approach would \nbe necessary because of the size of the class.   It should be noted that her 1:1 recommendation was \noffered for the first time at trial and did not a ppear in her report. It  appears that Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson’s opinion that com pensatory services on  a 1:1 basis are appropriate originates from a \nsingle  sentence  in a single article.   In “Puniti ve  Damages  in Special Education,” by Antonis  \n  23\n\nKatsiyannis and Maria Herbst, published in 2004 in the  Journal of Disability Policy Studies , in \ndiscussing the Supreme Court’s decision in Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181 (2002), a case brought \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132, and th e Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a), the authors st ated, “Using a contract law analogy—when a contract is broken, \nthe promise should be enforced to p ut the parties in a good position, as they would have been h ad \nthe contract been fulfilled—the court [sic] held that punitive damages are not compensatory and are \ntherefore not embraced by that rule.” (Ex. 460A at 11.) From this sentence, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson \nconcluded that compensatory services must be provided on a 1:1 basis.  \nHowever, on cross-examination, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson acknowledged that not all students \nprogress at the same rate and the age at which a  student was denied FAPE  may be significant in \ndetermining what, if any, deficiencies the student m ay have as a result of th at denial. Further, Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson  acknowledged that special e ducation  does not resolve every student’s \ndeficiencies, even if the IEP is appropriate.  \nIn order to implement remedies, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson recommended an oversight monitor \nbe put into place, a checklist be developed to assist the IEP teams in their compensatory education \ndeterminations, additional training for IEP team s members, and methods be developed to ensure \nthat regular education did not suffer as a result of compensatory education.  She also recommended \nincreased alternative interventions to address the continuing problem of suspensions.  \nIn regard to the category of  suspended students, Dr. Roge rs-Adkinson recommended that \nstudents who have never been evaluated for specia l education should be automatically referred for \nspecial education evaluation if th ey were suspended m ore than 10  days in a school year.  This \nshould be done even if the student is perform ing at grade level and there are no other indicators, \nbecause 10 days of suspensions signals a child may be in need of special support and services. On \ncross-examination, she did acknowledge that it is neces sary to determine in every case if there is a  \n  24\n\nlink between the suspension and the potential speci al education need.  Further, she acknowledged \nthat if there is not a reasonable suspicion of disability it would be “unfair”  to force the ch ild to \nundergo the experience of a special education evaluation.  \nMPS provided numerous examples to which Dr. Rogers-Adkinson acknowledged that a \nvariety  of factors would affect  whether  any of those exemplar st udents  would be entitled to \ncompensatory services. Dr. Rogers-Adkinson acknowle dged that the student’s specific disability, \ncurrent life situation, external  stressors, rate of learning, progre ss on IEPs, behavior, attitude, and \ntolerance for programming would all be factors that  would need to be considered in determ ining \nwhat, if any, compensatory services are necessary for a student who was denied FAPE. \nDr. Rogers-Adkinson emphasized th at not being provided FAPE  is a substantive denial.   \nThis means that a stud ent’s willingness to participate should not be considered in determ ining \nwhether compensatory education is needed.  \nN. Jyran J.  \nJyran’s behavior problems began in elementary school. He acted out to get attention. He was \nfrequently suspended and receiv ed bad grades. He repeated 3r d grade three times and became \nembarrassed because he was older than the o ther students. He felt his failu res were not his  fault \nbecause teachers refused to help him  and instead chose to suspend him . When he transferred \nschools and was placed into 7th grade, he was placed into special education. School was difficult \nbecause he missed out on the thing s he should have learned in 4th, 5th and 6th grades, but the \nteachers were helpful.  \nJyran transferred schools again and at this ne w school his primary teacher took the time to \nwork with him one-on-one, and this was helpful. He got into a fight at this school and transferred to \nanother school. Coincidentally, the teacher who was  particularly helpful to Jyran transferred with \nhim and continued to work with him.  \n  25\n\nJyran is now in 9th grade at yet another school. He is 17 years old, and he continues to miss \na lot of school. He feels that the school does not care about him and so he does not go. For example, \nhe felt he worked hard and should have passed the 9th grade but nonetheless was retained. When he \ndoes  go, he does not understand certain elem entary  matters  in subjects such as m ath.  He is \nembarrassed to ask questions in cl ass and so instead walks out of  the classroom. Jyran feels he  \nneeds one-on-one attention.  \nJyran likes to work on computers and believes that an online school might be beneficial. He \nwants to graduate and would be willing to accept one-on-one tutoring at home.  \nM. Dr. Eric Hartwig \nDr. Eric Hartwig, Marathon County’s Administrator for Pupil Services, testified as an expert \nfor MPS. He supervises 110 employees who work in special education in six rural school districts in \nMarathon  County, W isconsin.  The largest distri ct  he oversees, Marat hon  School District, has  \napproximately  80 special education students. He  regularly  participates  in  IEP  meetings.  In \npreparation for his testimony, Dr. Hartwig met with Melanie and reviewed various student files. He \nalso reviewed the professional literature for discussions of the issue of compensatory education but \nrealized that there is a derth  of information. Therefore, his opi nions regarding special education \nwere shaped, in large part, by prior court cases. None of the cases he relied upon were class actions. \nHis expert report was received as Exhibit 455. \nIn reviewing Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s report, Dr. Hartwig found it remarkable that it had only \na single citation and that citation was to an op inion piece. An opinion piece is not subjec t to the \nsame sort of rigorous scrutiny to which a peer-reviewed article is subjected. Dr. Hartwig also noted \nthe limitations of a records review, such as the one conducte d by Dr. Rogers-Adkinson. It is one-\ndimensional, capturing only the opinion of the writer  at an isolated point in tim e, the records are \nfrequently incomplete, and the records often  times focus primarily upon problems rather than \n  26\n\npresenting the entire portrait of the student. In  Dr. Hartwig’s opinion, it would be inappropriate to \nconclude that any student needed compensatory education based solely on a review of record s, as \nconducted by Dr. Rogers-Adkinson.  \nAccording to Dr. Hartwig, the process for m aking a compensatory education determination \nis identical to that necessary for crafting the IE P, and it is necess ary to evaluate the s tudent’s \nindividual needs. Ultimately, the goal of compensatory education is to put the student in the position \nhe would have been had he not been denied FAPE. (Ex. 455 at 7.) Dr. Hartwig noted that the idea of \ncompensation underlies many special education dete rminations; for example, frequently an IEP \nteam is initially convened only after a student has failed over a period of time, and thus every initial \nIEP seeks to remedy this lack of services and thus special education is inherently compensatory.  He \nemphasized that compensatory education must look forward; after determining the child’s present \nlevel of performance, it must be determined what is needed prospectively by way of compensatory \neducation.  \nDr. Hartwig dismisses any formulaic approach.  In other words, in determ ining the level of \ncompensatory services a student m ay receive for a denial o f FAPE, it is inappropriate to sim ply \nprovide a student with one m inute of additional instruction for every minute lost because one \nminute of instructional time does not necessarily equal one minute of engaged instructional time. \nRather, when determining the level of com pensatory services, it is necessary to consider m any \nvariables, including the student’s  level of engagement. A formulaic approach may be useful in \nestablishing a framework for determining compensatory services but i ndividual tailoring remains \nnecessary.  \nIn his own review of the professional literature on the subject, Dr. Hartwig found no support \nfor Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s conclusion that compensatory services should be provided on a 1:1 basis \n  27\n\nor any support for the plaintiffs’ contention that compensatory services provided should be rounded \nup to the next semester on a 1:1 basis for every semester for which a student was denied FAPE. \nDr. Hartwig noted that Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s failed to rely upon scholarly research for her \nconclusions and this impeded her ability to m ake a recommendation. Dr. Hartwig said that often \ntimes  her s tatements  lacked foun dation  or were   counter-intuitive; he  described  Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson’s method of analysis as “like shooting at a barn and th en drawing a bull’s eye around it \nafter it was over.”  \nDr. Hartwig testified that only the IEP team can determine whether compensatory education \nis appropriate for a stu dent, and if so, what sort of services  are appropriate. A compensatory \neducation determination for a member of the class would be uniquely challenging because so much \ntime has passed since the denial of  FAPE.  As  for the process to be implem ented to meet this \nchallenge, Dr. Hartwig did not reject plaintiffs’ recommendation for an outside monitor, but opined \nthat this is often a cumbersome procedure. \nFurther, Dr. Hartwig testified that Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s recommendation that all students \nwho were suspended 10 or m ore days a year s hould be automatically referred for an evaluation \ntotally misconstrues the notion of individual analysis that underlies special education. Misconduct is \nnot synonymous with disability.  \nIn his review of Melanie’s records, discussion  with staff who interacted with Melanie, and \nhis meeting with Melanie, it is Dr . Hartwig’s opinion that Melanie does not need com pensatory \neducation because she was provided with a program that met her educational needs. Of particular \nimportance to Dr. Hartwig was the fact that Me lanie was dismissed from special education. Dr. \nHartwig also offered his impression regarding various other students based upon his review of their \nrecords, but acknowledged that this was no substitute for an IEP team meeting.  In this regard, the \n  28\n\ncourt finds that Hartwig’s records review “impressions” do not advance the issues being considered.  \nThey are no more than random comments. (See Ex. 455 at 30-42.) \nN. Patricia Hall \nPatricia Hall (“Hall”) is in her third year as a special education teacher at Wisconsin Career \nAcademy. Overall, she has 10 years of teaching experience. She first met Jamie S. last school year, \nwhich was Jamie’s first year in high school. Sin ce then, she has been Jam ie’s special education \nteacher, except for the second semester of last  year when Hall was o n medical leave. Jamie is \ncurrently repeating 9th grade; she failed  9th grade because of attendance issues. Her attendance \nproblems have continued this year. So far, Jamie was at school only three full days.  \nHall has talked to Jam ie about the things  going on in Jam ie’s life including discussions \nabout problems at home and about Jamie’s group of friends at school  with whom she socializes on \nthe weekends. Jamie has never discussed being teased with Hall, nor has Hall witnessed or heard of \nsuch incidents from other staff members. Hall speaks with Jamie’s mother roughly once a month \nand would frequently contact her by sending written information to her.   \nAs for Jamie’s post-high school plans, Jam ie used to want to go in to child care but has \nrecently expressed interest in becoming a certified nursing assistant like her m other. When Jamie \nwas still interested in working in child care, Hall did a class with her exploring issues relating to \nworking with young children. Jam ie was also given  the opportunity to work  at Boston Store, an \nopportunity usually limited to 11th and 12th graders, but Jamie failed to appropriately attend school, \nwhich was a requirement to take advantage of this opportunity.  \nHall has participated in Jamie’s IEP team meetings and describes Jamie as a very verbal and \nactive participant in thes e meetings. Jamie’s mother was also  present and participating. In part, \nJamie’s IEP calls for her to get one-on-one assistance and Hall is the one to provide that assistance. \nJamie is given the opportunity to work on a computer in the special education room but her activity \n  29\n\nis monitored and Hall has never observed Jam ie on websites such as Facebook or Blink.  In Hall’s \nopinion, Jamie has made good progress when considering her cognitive disability.  In fact, she may \nbe nearing her cognitive level, although there are still some goals to reach. \nJamie has received various other accommodations such as a later start time and a community \nawareness class where Jamie was very involved in a project raising money and purchasing toiletries \nfor a community organization. Jam ie was also give n the opportunity to participate in group and \nindividual counseling; Jamie chose not to. No one has ever objected to the services Jamie receives. \nFurther, no one has raised the issue of compensatory education or suggested that she pursue online \neducation or home tutoring. \nO. Roxanne Mayeur \n Roxanne  Mayeur is em ployed  at Commun ity  High School as its Special S ervices \nAdministrator. Community High School is a charter school within MPS that is run by its teachers \nrather  than a single adm inistrator  and em phasizes  social justice and community involvem ent. \nStudents are required to pa rticipate in some sort of community service at least once a week. This  \ncomponent is designed to build skills that will enable the s tudent to transition into a professional \nenvironment.  Community  High Sc hool  helps all its students in   gaining vocational training, \ncompleting  job applications, writing resum es,  exploring  career interests, completing college \napplications, and visiting colleges.  \nMayeur has known Bryan E. since 2004, when  Community High School opened. Mayeur \ndescribes their relationship as a good one and he  discusses with her the problem s he is having. \nBryan has an interest in  art and Mayeur’s teach ing background is in art; therefore,  she has had \nseveral classes with him. Bryan has done well in  these classes, including an advanced art class \nwhere he designed clothes and developed an art portfolio. In light of Bryan’s interests, he was given \nthe  opportunity to complete his community service at the Milwaukee Art Museum. He later \n  30\n\nexpressed interest in working at a local barbershop and the school  approved a placement arranged \nby Bryan’s family.  \nMayeur has attended B ryan’s IEP meetings, and Bryan has been an active participant in \nthese meetings. In November of 2006, the IEP team concluded that Bryan was on par with his peers \nand on pace to graduate.  The team recomm ended that Bryan was no longer eligible for special \neducation, and neither Bryan nor his advocate from DRW objected. Subsequently, Bryan stated that \nhe wanted to return to special education. Another meeting was convened, and Bryan was returned to \nspecial education; there was no lapse in services . At no point was the issue of com pensatory \neducation ever raised.  \nBryan was found to be eligible for graduation,  but was not at a 12t h grade level in any \nsubject when he graduated.  According to Mayeur,  such deficiency in grade level is not uncommon \nfor a regular education student at Community  High School. So even though his IEP goals did not \nrequire Bryan to be at a 12th grade level, he was on par with his regular education peers.  \nP. Sara Janacek \nSara Janacek (“Janacek”) is the school psychologist at the Milwaukee School of Languages \nwhere she has known Melan ie since 2002. Janacek a ttended all of Melan ie’s IEP meetings. In \nMelanie’s November 2006 IEP m eeting, the team, which included Melanie, her m other, and her \nattorney, concluded that Melanie should be dismissed from special education and a Section 504 plan \nbe put in place. This Section 504 plan included accommodations similar to those provided under the \nIEP.  \nDuring the 11th grade, Melanie began having significant problems completing assignments \nand her grades declined. She expressed her frustration with school to Janacek and discussed plans of \ndropping out and pursuing her GED. Melanie had frequent problems with attendance throughout her \n  31\n\ntime in special education and under  the Section 504 plan.  At som e point after she turned 18 years \nold and MPS was no longer able to compel her to attend, she completely stopped coming to school.  \nMelanie never requested that the IEP team  be reconvened following her dism issal from \nspecial education. At no point did she or her attorneys request a due process hearing.  \nQ. Dr. Barbara Van Haren \nDr.  Barbara Van Haren is the Director of  Special  Education Services for Cooperative \nEducational Service Agency (“CESA”) #1 in Brookf ield, Wisconsin, (Ex. 451), and testified as an \nexpert on behalf of MPS. CESA #1 provides servi ces for 45 school district s, including MPS, and \nacts as an intermediary between DPI and the local  school districts, providing the districts with the \nspecial education services and support they might not be able to provide on their own. Previously, \nDr. Van Haren worked as a m iddle school special  education teacher and a director of special \neducation services and an assistant superintendent of pupil services. Her expert report was received \nas Exhibit 454.  \nDr.  Van Haren was asked to review Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson’s  conclusions regarding \ncompensatory education. Dr. Van Haren concluded that Dr. Rogers-Adkinson relied upon numerous \nerroneous  assumptions.  For example, Dr. R ogers-Adkinson  erroneously concluded that post-\nsecondary education may be appropriate compensatory education. Dr. Van Haren testified that it is \na school district’s responsibility to provide tran sitional services that may lead to p ost-secondary \neducation, but the district is not  responsible for providing that education. Dr. Van Haren has never \nseen  post-secondary education ordered as compen satory  education. She is not aware whether \nChapter 118 of the Wisconsin Statutes provides for tuition to technical colleges for at risk students. \nFurther, Dr. Van Haren disagrees with Dr. Rogers-A dkinson’s conclusion that special education is \nthe only remedy for students who are not successful; many students may struggle for reasons other \nthan a disability and there are programs and interventions available to assist those students.  \n  32\n\nAs for Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s conclusion that compensatory services should be provided to \nstudents with a history of susp ensions, Dr. Van Haren found this conclusion overbroad. Students  \nmay be suspended for a wide variety of reasons that have nothing to do with a disability.  \nIn  Dr. Van Haren’s opinion, an IEP team   asked to determ ine  whether com pensatory \neducation is appropriate must consider numerous factors including, whether the student was denied \nFAPE, the type of services the stud ent received, the services the student was denied, the students \nacademic  and attend ance  records,  the tim e  between th e  denial of FAPE and the rem edy, \nopportunities and participation in additional services such as summer school, after school programs, \nor other compensatory services, and the student’s progress on IEP goals. (Ex. 454 at 8.) Further, in \nher opinion, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s conclusion that compensatory services should be provided on a \n1:1 basis fails to consider the student as an individual. \nDr.  Van Haren also reviewed individual stud ent  records  as well as   interviewing  those \nstudents and key staff involved in  the students’ education. In her opi nion, Bryan is not eligible for  \ncompensatory education because she saw no tim eline violations in his referral process.  Even if \nthere  was a denial of FAPE, compensatory   education  is not appropriate because he made \nappropriate progress on his IEP  goals and graduated. Further, Dr . Van Haren disagreed with Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson’s conclusion that Bryan was s ubjected to “excessive” suspensions; Bryan was  \nsuspended only twice. In her interview with Brya n, he reported that he fe lt he needed special \neducation once he got into high school; however, Dr. Van Haren acknowledged that it is unusual for \na learning disability to first app ear at age 15.  Ultimately, she conceded that she d oes not know \nwhether Bryan should have been referred earlier.  \nAs for Jamie, Dr. Van Haren believes that Jamie may be eligible for compensatory services \nbased upon a delay in her referral. In Dr. Van Ha ren’s opinion, Jamie should have been referred \nafter testing indicated she might have a mild cognitive disability; the referral occurred roughly two \n  33\n\nmonths later.  She believes that Jam ie might receive a benefit if she participated.  She recognized \nthat Jamie’s truancy is severe and frequent and conceded that a functional behavioral assessment in \nregard to this problem might be warranted. \nIn regard to Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s conclusion  that Jamie should receive three years of \ncompensatory education, Dr. Van Haren disagr eed since there was only a two-m onth delay in \nreferral. In Dr. Van Haren’s inte rview with Jamie, she discussed summer school and Jamie stated \nthat she did not feel summer school was necessary  and she preferred to spend her summers in \nChicago. Further, although Jamie continued to have significant academic problems, in Dr. Van \nHaren’s opinion, this did not indicate that the IE P was inappropriate, especi ally in view of her \nsignificant absences.  \nBased upon her review of these and other stud ent records, she was unable to discern any \npattern within MPS with respect to handling compensatory education determinations.  \nR. Dr. Cindy Walker \nDr. Cindy Walker is a professor at the Univ ersity of Wisconsin – Milwaukee where she \nteaches  numerous  courses includ ing  Educational  Statistics, Techniques of Education al  and \nPsychological Measurement, and Techniques of Educational Research. (Ex. 450.) She testified as an \nexpert on behalf of MPS. Her expert report was received as Exhibit 453.  \nDr. Walker reviewed Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s repo rt to determine whether her analysis was \nsound from a methodological point of view. Dr. W alker pointed to  numerous deficiencies in Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson’s methodology. As an initial m atter, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson failed to explain her \nmethodology in a manner that would allow a subsequent researcher to replicate her work.  \nDr. Walker described qualitative research as intended to discern on  a micro level what is \nhappening in a specific situation. This is distinguished from quantitative research, which is typically \nutilized when the researcher seeks to generalize the research to a larger population and is conducted \n  34\n\non a much larger scale. The only way that a research finding can be generalized to the population as \na whole is if the population studied was selected as the result of random sampling.  \nRandom  sampling is distinguished from   purposive  sampling,  which is utilized when a \nresearcher is attempting to answer a specific research question that might not lend itself to the use of \na random sample. For example, if the target populat ion is small, it might not be appropriate to \nutilize a random sample.  \nGiven the size of the sample, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson utilized purposive sampling and engaged \nin  quantitative analysis but then attem pted  to  call it qualitative. Dr .  Walker  also found it \ninappropriate that Dr. Rogers-Adkinson relied upon statistical data that she did not verify. Further, \nDr. Walker considered it inapprop riate for Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson to utilize in Phase  III the s ame \nresearch  design  she utilized   in  Phase II because the res earch  questions  being  asked in   these \nrespective phases were very different.  \nIn Dr. Walker’s opinion, the question being presented in Phase III, whether all members of \nthe class should receive compensatory education, is not the type of question that could be answered \nthrough a review of a few select files and then  generalized to the entire population. It is not a \nquestion that lends itself to generalizations but rather would require a review of each individual file.  \nS. Patricia Gill \nPatricia Gill (“Gill”) is a Student S ervices Coordinator at MPS and works particularly on \nmatters involving student discipline and expulsi on. On a daily basis, sc hools provide her with \nrecords of disciplinary actions, and if it appears that an expulsion hearing is forthcoming, she begins \nthe expulsion process. The first step is to revi ew the student’s computer  records to determ ine \nwhether the student is in regular  or special education.  If the student is in special education, a \nseparate process at the school le vel occurs. If the student is in  regular education, the expulsion \nprocess continues with the scheduling of an investigative interview.  \n  35\n\nAt times, a student who was previously in re gular education may be identified as possibly \nbeing  eligible for special educa tion during the expulsion process.  If this were to happen, the \nexpulsion process is either returned to the school or the student is placed into an interim placement \nwhile the referral is completed.  \nGill discussed Pheng, a student wh o received As and Bs, and received report cards stating \nthat he was never a problem  in class, but wh o was suspended for 15 days pending an expulsion \nhearing for possession of marijuana. Prior to that, he was suspended on two other o ccasions for 2 \ndays each. (Ex. 449.) Gill also d iscussed Greg, a student who was suspended for 13 days pendin g \nhis referral for expulsion for possession of marijuana. Years earlier, he had been suspended for three \ndays. At the time of his referral for expulsion, Gr eg’s grades ranged from a B to two Us. Neither \nGreg nor Pheng were expelled and both graduated from MPS.  \nAlthough Pheng and Greg were suspended more than 10 days during the period purportedly \ncovered by Exhibit 400, inexplicably, neither of these students were listed on Exhibit 400.  \nT. Stephanie Petska \nStephanie Petska (“Petska”), DPI’s Director of Special Education, testified that DPI does not \nhave any guidelines regarding the delivery of com pensatory education. It is f or the IEP team to \nanalyze  each case on an indiv idual  basis  to  determine  whether c ompensatory  education  is \nappropriate and if so, what form that compensatory education should take. The use of a for mula to \ndetermine compensatory education would be inappr opriate. The student’s age and health, severity \nof disability, the specific services the student d id not receive, the studen t’s pre-referral progress, \nearly intervention services provided, and the length of the delay are just some of the factors that the \nIEP team should consider in m aking any compensatory education determination. In determining \nwhether compensatory education is appropriate, the IEP team  must determine whether the student \n  36\n\nshould have been referred for special education earli er than he was.  The IEP team  should try and \nascertain this date because FAPE was not being received during this period. \nA referral to special education is appropriate when there is reasonable cause to believe that \nthe student has a d isability. In certain situations, a single factor might be sufficient to warrant a \nreferral. However, simply because a student was suspended for 10 days, alon e, would not be \nsufficient to warrant a referral.  Rather, suspensions should be one  factor to be considered am ong \nothers in determining whether a referral is appropr iate. This could be a difficult determ ination to \nmake.  \nDPI  does not have any guidelines relating to   providing post-secondary education as \ncompensatory education. However, although post-secondary education is not required, it also is not \nprohibited. It might be provided in the appropriate situation.  \nDPI has never reviewed MPS to assess its compensatory education determinations. It has no \nopinion as to whether MPS has e ffectively provided compensatory education for students between \n2000 and 2005.  \nIII. PLAINTIFFS’ PROPOSED REMEDY \nPlaintiffs seek the appointment of an independent monitor, in addition to the independent \nmonitor called for under the settlement with DPI, who will be paid for by MPS. (Docket No. 540-2.) \nThe monitor will be able to order MPS to tak e corrective action and  to report to the court any \nfailures of MPS to comply. (Docket No. 540-2.) This independent monitor will provide both parties \nwith monthly reports indicating the class members that have received compensatory education, the \namount of compensatory education received, and th e results of all in itial evaluations of class \nmembers. (Docket No. 540-2.)  \n  The plaintiffs seek a written notice to be provided directly to the last known address of each \npotential class member  \n  37\n\nincluding  all students whose initial eval uation  for special educatio n  exceeded \nstatutory guidelines anytime during the period Septem ber 2000 through June 2005, \nall students who were initially found eligible for special education since that time, all \nstudents who were suspended 10 or m ore times in any one school year between \nSeptember  2000 and June 2005, and were not   evaluated for special education \neligibility. \n(Docket No. 540-2.) Further, the plaintiffs seek the creation of a separate fund, in the amount to be \ndetermined by the parties and the  outside monitor, to be used to  fund compensatory education. \n(Docket No. 540-2.)  \n  As for class members who have aged out of  MPS or are no longer resi dents of the district, \nthe plaintiffs seek compensatory services de pending upon the length of ti me they were denied \nappropriate services, which may include: \n1. Tuition and support for post secondary technical college or university  \n \n2. Provision of functional community based assessments to determine current needs, \nrecommendations for employment, benefits analyses, community participation. \n \n3. Training on self-determination and self-advocacy from providers such as People \nFirst.  \n \n4. Passport to Employment program at Creative Employment Opportunities. \n \n5. Job Internship series- 3 internships of 40-60 hours each, minimum of 10 hours per \nweek in multiple areas of interest such as retail, office, construction, factory, etc. \n \n6. Job placement and training. \n \n7. Job coaching. \n \n8. Life skills training such as budgeti ng, money management, food planning an d \npreparation, shopping, transportation, self-advocacy, etc. \n \n9. Life planning assistance- includes employment, independent living, life skills, etc. \n \n10. Provision of technology such as com puters, internet access, software program s, \nand assistive technology. \n \n(Docket No. 540-2.) \n  As for class members who are cu rrent MPS students, the plaintiffs seek com pensatory \nservices that may include: \n  38\n\n1. Any of the services mentioned . . . above  especially with regard to transition ag e \nstudents. \n \n2. Tutoring through outside programs such as Sylvan, Huntington’s Learning Center, \nMarquette, possibly Boys and Girls Clubs, including transportation. \n \n3. Summer Camps, such as Easter Seals,  YMCA, UW Whitewater, etc. including \ntransportation if necessary. \n \n4. Tuition for private schools such as Cradwe ll, Wisconsin Lutheran, or St. Francis \nChildren’s Center. \n \n5. Mentoring services-such as Running Rebels. \n \n6. Community based specialized services  such as occupational therapy, physical \ntherapy, or speech and language therapy.  \n \nAdditionally, all class members shall be assured of their 1st Choice of 3 Choice list \nafter parents are provided with inform ation of the school’s perform ance, its special \neducation performance and the nature of special ed service offered at that school. \n \n(Docket No. 540-2.) \n  The plaintiffs also seek that MPS “fund the  services of at least 5 new community based \n(independent  of MPS) parent ad vocates  to assis t  at all com pensatory  service  determination \nmeetings, all initial IEP m eetings for newly referred class members . . .”  and that “[a]ll students \nreceiving compensatory services under this agreement shall be assigned an expediter (paid for by  \nMPS) whose duty and authority is to ensure that the compensatory services are delivered in a timely \nand appropriate manner.” (Docket No. 540-2.)  \nAs for the students who have not yet been found eligible for special education, MPS shall \nevaluate for special education all students who were suspended 10 or more times in any one school \nyear between September 2000 and June 2005 who have not yet been evaluated for special education \neligibility. (Docket No. 540-2.) “A parent advocate . . . will be provided for all initial IEP evaluation \nmeetings and the record shall contain com plete information about all efforts including adjusting \ntimes and locations to ensure parental involve ment.” (Docket No. 540-2.) Students who becom e \n  39\n\neligible as a result of this identification process shall be entitled to receive compensatory education \nin accordance with the terms set forth above. (Docket No. 540-2.) \nAs for the named plaintiffs, the plaintiffs seek compensatory education services that include, \nfor example, the provision of laptop computers with software and a high speed internet connection, \nYMCA membership, educational aides to work with the named plaintiff at home, school, and during \nextracurricular programs, college education at the school of the plaintiff’s choice, job placem ent, \nand life skills training. (Docket No. 540-2.) \nAs part of their po st-trial briefing, the pl aintiffs submitted an amended proposed remedy. \n(Docket  No.  585-2.)  In th is  revised p roposed  remedy,  the p laintiffs  outline  additional \nresponsibilities  for the outside monitor, whic h  would include developing screening tools to \ndetermine whether students who were suspended 10  or more days during a school year or respond \nto the class notice contending that they should have received special education should be provided \nwith a full special education evaluation, to determ ine when students who we re delayed entry into \nspecial education should have been referred for special education, and a tool for IEP teams to utilize \nin determining what sorts of compensatory services a student should receive.  (Docket No. 585-2 at \n1-2.)  \nFurther, in its revised proposed remedy, the plaintiffs “clarify that not all students who had \nextensive suspensions are eligible for compensatory education. Students must first be found eligible \nfor special education b efore they could be considered for compensatory education.” (Docket No. \n584 at 2.) Finally, the plaintiffs acknowledge “that th ere may be situations in which the denial of \nFAPE was de minimis and compensatory education is no longer necessary.” (Docket No. 584 at 2.) \nIV. MPS’ PROPOSED REMEDY \n  Under  MPS’  proposed rem edy,  (Docket N o.  552), MPS divides those eligible for \ncompensatory services into three distinct categories: \n  40\n\n1.  Students enrolled in MPS on the date of the remedy is approved by the court who, while \nin Kindergarten through Grade 5 who were  suspended at least 15 days or while in \nGrades 6-12 were suspended at least 25  days between September 13, 2000 and June 30, \n2005 “[w]ho are eligible for special education services on the date on which” the remedy \nis  approved by the court, whose IEP team   has no t  previously  determined  that \ncompensatory services were necessary due to a delay in a referral for special education.  \n2.  Students enrolled in MPS on the date of  the remedy is approved  by the court whose  \ninitial evaluations took longer than ten da ys beyond the statutory time limit without a \nvalid extension who are eligible for special education services on the date the court \napproves the proposed remedy, whose initial evaluations o ccurred between September \n13, 2000 and June 30, 2005, and whose IEP has not  previously made determinations as \nto whether compensatory services were necessary due to a delay in a referral for special \neducation.  \na.  If the student’s initial evaluation was delayed between 10 and 30 days, the \nstudent  shall receive a ge neral  notice, which sha ll  include, for exam ple, \npublication on party websites,  posting in MPS’s buildings, and distribution to \nlocal media.  \nb.  If the student’s initial evaluation was  delayed more than 30 days, the student \nshall receive an individualized notice sent to the student or parent.  \n3.  Students who were found to be  initially eligible for special education by MPS between \nSeptember 13, 2000 and June 30, 2005 but w hose initial evaluation was im properly \ndelayed more than 30 days, and who reside  within the geographic boundaries of MPS \nand are not yet 22-years-old on the date the remedy is approved by the court, and did not \ngraduate, shall receive an individualized notice.  \n  41\n\nFor each of these students, an IEP Team shall be convened to determine if the student was \ndenied FAPE as a result of his or her delayed  referral to special education and to determine if \ncompensatory services are necessary to remedy any deficiency. If the IEP Team cannot agree as to \nwhether  compensatory  services  are necessary or  the  type  of  compensatory  services  that  are \nnecessary, the parties shall go to binding arbitration.  \nMPS and DPI shall establish a fund to ensure  that funds are available for com pensatory \nservices with DPI and MPS contributing equally.   \nV. ANALYSIS \n  All told, this case has been pending for roughl y 7½ years, consisted of  28 days of trial, \ngenerated a transcript that is nearly 5,000 page s long, involved tens of thousands of pages of \nexhibits, and, as is outlined, in part, above,  resulted in many, many, motions by the parties and \nconsequently decisions and orders by this court. No w, the court is in a position to take a f inal step \ntowards resolving this case.  \nUpon reviewing and considering the evidence  presented, remedial intervention by the court \nis required. Although Director of  Special Services Yahle’s testim ony indicates that MPS is now \npaying more attention to the issue of compensatory education when there is a delay in com pleting \nan evaluation, the evidence demonstrates that MPS has a long way to go.  \nMPS’ own procedural handbook calls for the IEP  team to consider whether compensatory \nservices are appropriate whenever “a student has  received inappropriate or insufficient serv ices,” \n(Ex. 402 at 247), but the evidence demonstrates that this infrequently occurs. Exhibit 401 identifies \nhundreds of students whose initial evaluations were delayed beyond the statutory deadline between \nSeptember of 2000 and June of 2005, but there is  a “Y” in the “Discussed Com p Ed” column in \nonly a miniscule percentage of cases. Further, a “Y” in a column on a spreadsheet offers no insight \ninto the nature of the discussion or if compensatory services were provided.  \n  42\n\nEven now, after this case has  been pending for years, and near ly two years since this court \ndetermined that MPS was liable for its systemic violations of the IDEA, MPS has not demonstrated \nthat  it h as  taken s teps  to evaluate whether com pensatory  services f or  a den ial  of FAPE are \nappropriate for all the members of class. Although MPS conducted an audit of the files of students \nwhose initial special education evaluations occurred more than 90-days after the initial ref erral \nwithout a valid extension between September 1, 2000 and April 1, 2004, to determine whether there \nwas a need for com pensatory services, (Ex. 461), this audit was signif icantly narrower than the  \nentire class. Further, Potter, MPS’ Coordina tor of Psychological, Speech, Language, and Health \nServices, testified that following  this court’s Phase II ruling, M PS did not provide any specific \ntraining as to how IEP teams should assess whether compensatory services are appropriate for class \nmembers. (See Docket No. 567 at 195-96.) Thus, MPS has fa iled to demonstrate that it is taking \nappropriate steps to comply w ith its obligations under the IDEA  to remedy a denial of FAPE \nsuffered by class members.  MPS has had more than ample time to provide a remedy on its own; the \nonly option left is a court ordered remedy.  \nAs demonstrated by the testimony and the parties’ proposals, this will not be an easy task. It \nis one that involves m any considerations. In stru cturing the appropriate rem edy in this case, the \ncourt must resolve many issues, both logistical and substantive. The former includes the method of \nnotification  and the latter includ es  the m ethod  to be used for evaluating whether those class \nmembers whose entry into special education was delayed are in need of compensatory services, and \nif  so, what sort of co mpensatory  services  are  required. For those who  have  not as yet been \ndetermined to be eligible for special education, what type of additional evaluation will be required? \nThe remedy proposed by the plaintiffs is broad and comprehensive whereas the remedy proposed by \nMPS far more limited. It is the conclusion of the court that the appropriate remedy lies within the \ntwo extremes proposed by the parties.  \n  43\n\nIn broad terms, it is th e conclusion of this court that the establishment of an additional \nspecial education system providing relief to class members is not necessary. Such a system  would, \nin a sense, piggyback the existing st ructure and plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate such a broad \nframework is warranted. Instead, the court believes that development of a remedy structure that to \nthe extent practical parallels the well-established existing structure for determining eligibility and a \nstudent’s special education plan under the IDEA is a more workable approach. Moreover, the court \nfinds that a deviation from  the IDEA’s procedural  requirements would be incon sistent with the \nspirit if not the letter of  the Act. Thus, for example, the court finds it  inappropriate to impose a \ncondition of binding arbitration as a class m ember’s exclusive means of remedying a dispute. The \nIDEA sets forth a comprehensive and well-established procedural framework that is f amiliar to \nparticipants in the special education system and provides a practical foundation upon which to base \nthe court’s remedy in this case. In essence, this court’s conclusion that MPS systemically violated \nthe IDEA during the class period “resets the cloc k” for class m embers, and thus perm its class \nmembers to pursue relief through the court ordered  remedy set forth here that m ight be otherwise \ntime barred.  \nA. Evaluation of Class Members \n  All persons who shall receive or respond to a notice may not be class members. Even if they \nare determined to be class m embers, compensatory services may not be appropriate. And finally, \neven if they are class members and are entitled to compensatory services, not all class members are \nentitled to the sam e compensatory services. Thus, it is necessary for this court to  establish the \nframework for a system whereby these difficult individualized questions may be answered.  \n   i.  Independent Monitor \nAs a preliminary matter, the court must address the question of whether it is necessary to \nappoint an independent monitor to oversee the c ourt ordered remedy. The court does not believe \n  44\n\nthat MPS will accomplish the task required without outside intervention. Throughout this litigation, \nMPS had an opportunity to correct the alleged and la ter established systemic deficiencies in Child \nFind. Self-correction would have been the best way  for MPS to avoid the inte rventions that it has \nfought so vigorously to avoid. W hile MPS has made certain improvements, its efforts have fallen \nshort of the mark. As just one example, if the conduct outlined in Exhibit 401, which includes many \npages of late initial referrals w ithout valid extensions and indications that compensatory education \nwas considered in few such cases, constitutes MPS’ “best efforts,” the court finds it unreasonable to \nexpect that MPS is capable of  implementing any court ordered re medy without either the court’s \ndirect oversight of every step or the direct oversight of an independent monitor.  \nNot only would the utilization of judicial resources to undertake the detailed monitoring that \nshall be necessary to implement this remedy be inefficient, the interests of the class members would \nbe best served if this monitoring is completed by a person with professional expertise in the field of \nspecial education, knowledge that even after thes e many years addressing these issues, this court \ndoes not possess, see Mather v. Hartford Sch. Dist. , 928 F. Supp. 437, 445 (D. Vt. 1996) (citing \nBoard of Education v. R owley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1982)). This is  an exceptional case where the \nunique requirement of conducting i ndividual evaluations of a poten tially large number of class \nmembers warrants the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee this remedy. See Thomas \nS. v. Flaherty, 902 F.2d 250, 255-56 (4th Cir. 1990);  see also Amos v. Board of School Directors, \n408  F. Supp. 765, 822-24 (E.D. W is.  1976). Accordingly, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 53, the court shall appoint an independent monitor to oversee the implementation of the \ncourt ordered remedy, attempt to resolve issues th at may arise between the  parties, and to report \nback to the court as necessary. (Rule 53 refers to “masters.” The court uses the term “monitor” here \nbecause it is the term used by the parties, and it better conn otes the role envisioned by the court. \nSubstantively, the distinction is one without consequence.)     \n  45\n\nPursuant to Rule 53(g)(2)(A) and in accordance with Rule 53(g)(3), MPS shall pay all costs \nassociated with the independent monitor. The independent monitor shall be empowered to “regulate \nall proceedings” necessary to effectuate the co urt ordered remedy and to “tak e all appropriate \nmeasures to perform the assigned duties fairly and efficiently.”  Rule 53(c)(1). The independent \nmonitor shall have the primary authority to fill in the details to the framework the court constructs \nhere regarding the m eans by which purported clas s  members  shall  be  evaluated  to determine \nwhether they are entitled to compensatory services. A primary concern for the independent monitor \nshall be ensuring that this remedy is implemented in an expeditious manner, including establishing \ndeadlines for completing all phases of this reme dy, so as to not unnecessarily further delay any \nrelief for class members.  \nIn accordance with Rule 53(d), th e independent monitor shall issue o rders necessary to \neffect  the rem edy  the court discusses in m ore  detail below, including, for example, orders  \nappointing permanent members to the hybrid IEP t eam, and establishing the guidelines that the  \nhybrid  IEP  team  shall apply in m aking  the indi vidualized  determinations  necessary for each \npurported class member. Further, in accordance with the Appendix to this De cision and Order, \nwhich is incorporated herein by reference, the independent monitor shall be tasked with establishing \nfirm deadlines to complete all tasks necessary to implement this remedy. The independent monitor \nis authorized to issue orders establishing such deadlines throughout the implementation process.  \nAlthough the plaintiffs contend th at this independent monitor must be separate from Alan \nCoulter, the monitor appointed under the settlement with DPI, th e court, at this point, m akes no \ndetermination on the selection. There m ay be any number of reasons why  Dr. Coulter is not an \nappropriate person to appoint as the independent monitor to oversee the court ordered remedy, but \nthe court shall not disqualify Dr. Coulter ab initio.  \n  46\n\n  The parties shall engage in a good faith effort  to agree upon an independent m onitor. If the \nparties are not able to agree, th e plaintiffs and MPS shall each submit to the court the name and \ncurriculum vitae of up to two proposed independent  monitors for the court to consider. Regardless \nof whether the independent monitor is proposed by the parties individually or jointly, in addition to \nproviding the curriculum vitae of any proposed i ndependent monitor, the parties shall also subm it \nan affidavit of any proposed independent m onitor in accordance with Rule 53(b)(3)(A), as well as \ninformation regarding the proposed  monitor’s rates of com pensation for services rendered. Upon \nreceipt of the parties’ recommendation, the court shall then issue an  order in accordance with Rule \n53 appointing an independent monitor. \n   ii.  Hybrid IEP Team \n  The  plaintiffs  contend that e ligibility  determinations  should be conducted by “a tea m \nappointed by the Monitor that includes special  educators from outside of MPS and an independent \nParent Advocate” utilizing a “tool” developed by an outside monitor. (Docket No. 585-2 at 1.) MPS \ncontends that these determinations should be conducted by the IEP team. (See Docket No. 552 at 2.) \nAgain, similar to many issues presented in this litigation, the court finds that the acceptable answer \nlies somewhere in-between the parties’ proposals.  \n  It is the conclusion of the court that all questions related to a purported class m ember’s \nstatus as a class member, eligibility for compensatory services, and the nature of any compensatory \nservices awarded, shall be resolved by a team that the court shall re fer to as a “hybrid IEP team.” \nThis hybrid IEP team shall consist of certain “permanent” members, consisting of MPS personnel, \napproved by the independent m onitor, and at late r stages of the evaluati on, as explained below, \n“rotating” members who shall be  best suited to address the unique  needs of the individual class \nmember.  \n  47\n\nA traditional IEP team is composed of members who are generally unique to each student. \nIn the present cas e, an entirely unique IEP te am for each purported  class member may lead to \ndisparate analysis among class members. Further, the questions that this  hybrid IEP team will be \nasked to resolve are different from those an IEP team is traditionally tasked with resolving. Proper \nresolution will require an understanding of this litigation and this court’s orders. It would be grossly \ninefficient to require each person who may serve on an IEP team  to become familiar with this \nsizable amount of information. Thus, the court finds it appropriate to utilize an IEP team composed \nof certain permanent members.  \nTherefore, MPS shall nom inate individuals to serve as pe rmanent members of the hybrid \nIEP  team.  Then, in consultation and cooperation  with  the parties, in   accordance with the \nrequirements set forth herein and subject to the procedures set forth below, the independent monitor \nshall enter an order appointing the permanent members of the hybrid IEP team. There shall be, at a \nminimum, four permanent members of the hybrid IEP team and, to the extent practicable, the hybrid \nIEP  team  should  be com posed  of individuals fr om  diverse professional backgrounds, thereby \navoiding any potential predisposition to a monolithic perspective and placing the team in the best \nposition  to address th e  wide variety  of issues  with  which it will be   faced. For exam ple,  the \nindependent monitor may find it appropriate to in clude on the hybrid IEP team elem entary and \nsecondary general and special education teachers, professionals with backgrounds in psychology or \nsocial work, as well adm inistrators, as opposed to, for example,  only administrators. At least one \npermanent member shall meet the qualifications set forth in 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B)(iv) and (v). \nHowever, the hybrid IE P team need not m eet all the formal requirements set forth in 20 U.S.C.   \n§ 1414(d). At all phases of the in dividualized evaluation process, parents and, where appropriate, \nstudents should be provided the  opportunity to participate, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415( b)(1), and the \nindependent monitor shall establish procedures for ensuring the opportunity for such participation.   \n  48\n\n  The court rejects the plaintiffs’ contention that  this evaluative team must be composed of \npersons independent of MPS. A certain degree of familiarity with MPS is a virtue, not a vice, in this \nsituation. The oversight that shall be provided by the independent m onitor is sufficient to alleviate \nany “fox guarding the henhouse” concerns.  \n  iii. Determination if Purported Class Member is a Class Member \n  The court anticipates that the response to the notice to the class will cover a broad spectrum. \nAt one end will be the obvious ex clusion from the class, e.g., the purported class member had no \nassociation with MPS during the class period. At the other end will be the obvious inclusion, e.g., it \nis undisputed that during the cl ass period the initial IEP team  meeting was delayed beyond the \nstatutory deadline without a valid reason. The court exp ects that many respons es will fall in-\nbetween, and it will be far more difficult to determine whether or not a person is to be included in \nthe class. Because an individual is eligible for compensatory services only if he or she was denied \nFAPE during the class period, as a threshold matter, that person must have been eligible for special \neducation during the class period.  \nThe permanent members of the hybrid IEP team  shall have the primary responsibility for \nmaking this determination. However, in certain limited cases, for example when a purported class \nmember seeks membership based on a failure to  be referred for a special education evaluation \nduring the class period, the perm anent members of the hybrid IEP team  may find it necessary to \nincorporate into the hybrid IEP team individuals who had personal knowledge of the purported class \nmember during the class period in order to determ ine if MPS had a reasonable basis  to suspect the \npurported class member was in need of special education. See Wis. Stat. § 115.777. \nThe independent monitor, in consultation and cooperation with the  permanent members of \nthe  hybrid IEP team ,  shall develop guidelines  for  making  the determ ination  of whether the \npurported class member was, between September of 2000 through June of  2005, a student eligible \n  49\n\nfor special education services from MPS who was either denied or delayed entry or participation in \nthe processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between the IEP team and the parents \nof the student. The hybrid IEP team  shall then  apply these guidelines to each purported class \nmember and determine whether the purported class m ember is a class member. In the event that a \npurported class member presents issues that are not adequ ately addressed by the pre-es tablished \nguidelines, the hybrid IEP shall promptly notify the independent monitor of this deficiency, and the \nindependent monitor, in consultation and cooperation with the perm anent members of the hybrid \nIEP team, shall formulate additional guidelines for addressing the un-anticipated situation.  \nThese guidelines to evaluate class eligibility shall include the type of information that the \nhybrid IEP team shall consider in making its determination. The court envisions that the eligibility \nreview by the hybrid IEP team  will be primarily, if not exclusively, pape r-based and rely upon \nMPS’ records. Should records be m issing, as may likely be the case in light  of MPS’ repeatedly \ndemonstrated deficiencies in record keeping, the following procedure shall apply. To the extent that \nMPS had a duty to retain particular records, the absence of such records shall permit the hybrid IEP \nteam to draw an inference that the docum ent would be adverse to MPS and favorable to a finding \nthat there was a reasonable basis fo r MPS to su spect that the purported class m ember may have \nbeen in need of special educa tion during the class period. The guide lines shall further outline the \ncircumstances  under which a purported class m ember  or MPS m ay  be perm itted  to subm it \nadditional information or when professionals outside of the permanent IEP team members should be \nconsulted.  \nCertain situations may present more difficult questions of eligibility as a class m ember. \nExamples of this will likely involve purported class members who contend MPS failed to identify \nthem as students in need of special education du ring the class period, or cu rrent special education \nstudents who contend that MPS failed to make an early referral. In both examples, the first question \n  50\n\nthat must be answered is whether MPS had a reasonable basis to suspect the student was in need of \nspecial education during the class period. The independent monitor in consultation and cooperation \nwith the permanent members of the hybrid IE P team shall establish guidelines for m aking this \ndetermination. However, this is only the first of three questions that must be answered to determine \nwhether such a purported class member is a class member.  \nOnce the hybrid IEP team determines that there was a reasonable basis for MPS to suspect \nthe purported class m ember was in need of s pecial education during the class period, the next  \nquestion is whether the purported class m ember was actually eligible for special education during \nthe class period. Obviously, not all students that m ay be suspected as bei ng in need of special \neducation are, in fact, eligible for special education. Again, the independent monitor in consultation \nand cooperation with the permanent members of the hybrid IEP  team shall establish guidelines for \nmaking this determination. Although the fact that a purported class  member might have been later \ndetermined  to be elig ible  for  special educatio n  will be probative of   a prior ne ed  for  special \neducation, it certainly is not dispositive. Like  the hybrid IEP team’s determination as to whether  \nthere  was a reasonable basis to s uspect  the pur ported  class m ember  was in need of special \neducation,  when determ ining  whether  the purported class m ember  was eligible for special \neducation, the focus must be on the class period; only if the purported class member was eligible for \nspecial education during the class period must the analysis continue.  \nThe final step in the analysis as to whether the purported class member is a class member is \na determination of whether the purported class member was denied or delayed entry or participation \nin the process which resulted in a properly co nstituted meeting between the IEP team  and the \nparents of the student. Not all st udents who were found eligible  for special education during the \nclass period are class members. For many students, the Child Find process worked as required. \nRather, the student must have been eligible for special education and had been denied or delayed \n  51\n\nparticipation in the process which resulted in a properly constituted IEP team. Therefore, it shall be \nnecessary  for the independent m onitor,  in co nsultation  and cooperation with the perm anent \nmembers of the hybrid IEP team, to establish guidelines for making this determination. \nIf the hybrid IEP team determines that the purported class member is not a member of the \nclass, the hybrid IEP team shall notify the purported class member of its decision. Further, the  \nhybrid IEP team shall inform the purported class member of the right to object to its determination, \nin accordance with the provisions the court sets forth below.  \niv. Determination if Class Member is Entitled to Compensatory Services  \nIn regard to class members who should have been referred for, or were delayed in m eeting \nwith a properly constituted IEP team, during that period of delay, because the class member was not \nprovided services in accordance with an IEP,  by definition, that student was denied FAPE.  See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1401(9)(D).  \nAlthough  not explicitly m entioned  in the st atute,  “[c]ompensatory services are well-\nestablished as a remedy under the IDEA” when a student is denied FAPE. Evanston Cmty. Consol. \nSch. Dist. No. 65 v. Michael M. , 356 F.3d 798, 803 (7th Cir. 2004). This m ight include “adult \ncompensatory education if necessary to cure a violation .” Id. (citing Parents of Student W . v. \nPuyallup School District, 31 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir. 1994); Pihl v. Massachusetts Dep't of Educ., \n9 F.3d 184, 187-89 (1st Cir. 1993)).  \nNot  every denial of F APE  mandates  the  provision  of com pensatory  services.  Id.  For \nexample, following the Phase III trial, the plaintiffs now clearly acknowledge that  de minimis \nviolations do not warrant an aw ard of compensatory education. (Docket No. 584 at 2.) Further, in \ncertain cases, such as cases involving cognitive disabilities where the student’s educational potential \nhas plateaued, (see, e.g., Docket No. 569 at 145, Test. of Dr . Rogers-Adkinson), compensatory \nservices would not be appropriate. Regardless of any denial of FA PE, if a student has reach ed the \n  52\n\nmaximum of his or her educational potential, providing compensatory services would not serve its \npurpose as an equitable remedy. Thus, in determining whether compensatory services are necessary, \nthe question for the hybrid IEP team m ust be, if the student had not been denied F APE, would the \nstudent be in a better educationa l position than he is now? It is not simply a matter of whether the \nstudent would have been in a  different position. As an equitable remedy, it would be inappropriate \nto require compensatory services to place the student in the identical place he would have been had \nhe not been denied FAPE. Rather, com pensatory services are aim ed at remedying wrongs, not \nundoing or correcting every potential  variable. If the hybrid IEP team  determines that the student \nwould not be in any better of a position had FAPE  not been denied, no com pensatory services are \nappropriate.  \nIf the denial of FAPE resulted in a deficien cy, compensatory services must be aimed at \nplacing the student in the position he would have  been had he not been denied FAPE. Under the \nIDEA, an “appropriate” education is not the best  possible education or everything that a loving \nparent may wish was provided for a child.  See, e.g., San Rafael Elem. Sch. Dist. v. Cal. Special \nEduc.  Hearing Office ,  482 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1156 (N.D. Cal. 2007). Rather, an appropriate  \neducation is one that provides a “basic floor of opportunity” and is “reasonably calculated to enable \nthe child to receive educational benefits.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 201, 207;  see also Michael M., 356 \nF.3d at 802 (citing Board of Educ. v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ., 41 F.3d 1162 (7th Cir. 1994)). And \naccordingly, it is not appropriate to require MPS to provide compensatory services aimed at placing \na student in the best possible or  ideal position. Rather, compensatory services must be aimed at \nelevating  that student  to  that “basic floor of opportunity ”  by providing the student with the  \neducational benefits lost during the denial of FAPE. Thus, compensatory services must be aimed at \nremedying MPS’ failure to provide FAPE, but need  not remedy every deficiency of a disabled \nstudent. \n  53\n\nWith respect to the type of compensatory services a class member may receive, there is no \n“one size fits all” remedy under the IDEA. The IDEA mandates determinations be made based upon \nthe unique circumstances of each student and the provision of compensatory services pursuant to \nthis court’s order shall be no different. Thus, it shall be the re sponsibility of the hybrid IEP team, \nsubject to the oversight by the independent monitor, to make individualized determinations as to the \nneeds of each class member.  \nJust as there is no “one size fits all” remedy regarding the type of compensatory services, the \nlength of time a class member shall receive compensatory services will vary depending upon the \nunique  circumstances  of each class m ember.  Thus,  the  court finds   that it is   inappropriate  to \nconclude  that any class m ember  who is found to   be eligible for com pensatory  services is \nautomatically entitled to receive compensatory services for a tim e period equivalent to the time  \nperiod  that person was denied special educa tion.  Special  education  services,  including \ncompensatory services, and even when those compensatory services are ordered for a class, must be \ndetermined on an individualized case-by-case basis. For example, a class member whose delay in an \ninitial evaluation was minimal, or a class member whose special education needs are comparatively \nlimited, may not need com pensatory services. Further, any number of variables may affect the \nlength of any compensatory services that are appropriate. For example, a class member may suffer \nfrom certain limitations for which a full time program of compensatory services would not be most \nbeneficial; or another class member may benefit from an accelerated and focused program of \ncompensatory services. For either class m ember, the result would not necessarily be sem ester by \nsemester equivalence between the period of delay and the length of the compensatory services.  \nIn the opinion of the pl aintiffs’ expert Dr. Rogers-Adkinson, the duration of compensatory \neducation provided must be equivalent to th e time the student was denied FAPE. During her \ntestimony, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson explained that this 1:1 approach is  necessary because of the large \n  54\n\nsize  of the class. Individualized determ inations  underlie the IDEA. Undoubtedly, when large \nnumbers of students are i nvolved, it becomes more difficult to  comply with this requirem ent of \nindividualized attention. But difficulties, whether in complying with Child Find, or in executing an \nappropriate remedy for a systematic violation of Child Find, does not perm it a deviation from the \nrequirements of the IDEA.  \nFurther,  the court finds that Dr. Rogers-A dkinson’s  opinion that a 1:1 equivalence is \nnecessary to remedy MPS’ violation of its Child Find obligations is not adequately supported within \nthe professional literature to be entitled to consideration by this court. As was made clear during \ncross-examination, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson’s conclusion that 1:1 equivalence is appropriate was based \nupon what was, at a minimum, an exceptionally strained interpretation of a single article. In fact, on \ncross-examination,  Dr. Rogers-Adkinson effec tively  abandoned her prio r  contention that 1:1 \ncompensation as opposed to an individualized appro ach was always appropriate. The fact that Dr. \nRogers-Adkinson offered as an expert opinion a c onclusion for which she could not m uster any \ndegree of appropriate support, and in fact departed her own conclusion, causes this court to question \nthis conclusion Dr. Rogers-Adkinson offered in this Phase of this case.  \nOn this issue, the court finds persuasive the ex pert opinion of Dr. Hartwig that it is not the \nquantity  but rath er  the  quality of   compensatory  services  that  is th e  most  important  factor  in \ndetermining the level of compensatory services that should be provided and this determination must \nbe made on an individual basis.  \nThe independent monitor, in consultation and cooperation with the  permanent members of \nthe hybrid IEP team, shall develop guidelines for the hybrid IEP team to apply to determine whether \na  class m ember  is in need of compensatory se rvices  and, if so, determ ine  the nature of the \ncompensatory services that are appropriate. As for the nature of the compensatory services that shall \nbe provided, the plaintiffs outline a var iety of services that they believe should be considered, \n  55\n\nincluding,  for exam ple,  post-secondary  education,  job  placement  and  training,  provision of  \ncomputers with internet access, private tutoring, mentors, and summer camps. (Docket No. 582-2 at \n3-4.)  \nThe specific nature of the compensatory services offered for any class member is a question \nthat it is not appropriate for this court to resolve. Compensatory education in the form of traditional \neducational services might be appropriate for one class member, whereas for another class member \nthe best form of compensatory education based upon the class member’s current situation may be \nservices aimed at providing the class member with transitional skills or job training necessary to \nsustain himself later in life. Thus, the question of what compensatory services are appropriate for an \nindividual class member must be resolved by the hybrid IEP team based upon the unique needs and \ncircumstances of that class member. \nExcept in instances where it is clear th at compensatory services are not appropriate, for \nexample  where the d enial  of FAPE was  de  minimis  or where, as   discussed  below, MPS has  \npreviously unequivocally evaluated and determinined the need for compensatory services, it shall be \nnecessary at this point for the hybrid IEP team  to include additional revolving members who have \ndirect knowledge of the particular class m ember. The independent m onitor, in consultation and \ncooperation with the permanent members of the hybrid IEP team, shall develop guidelines for the \nselection  of the educational professionals wh o  shall serve as the revolving m embers  on an \nindividual class member’s hybrid IEP team.  \nIf  MPS had previously unequivocally determ ined  whether com pensatory  services  were \nappropriate for the denial of FAPE to a class member, (see Ex. 402 at 247-49), it is unnecessary for \nthis  matter  to be reconsidered. The student ha d  an opportunity to utilize the full panoply of \nprocedural rights provided under the IDEA and challenge any disagreement with that prior decision. \nIn other words, although the student is a class  member, he has been provided his rem edy through \n  56\n\nmeans independent of this class ac tion and therefore is not eligible to receive any  benefit through \nthis  class rem edy.  Thus, if MPS previously de termined  that compensa tory  services were \nunnecessary, or the s tudent now alleges th at the compensatory services were insufficient, or, for \nwhatever  reason, the student did not take adva ntage  of the com pensatory  services offered, \nreconsideration within the context of the court ordered remedy is inappropriate. \nHowever, to preclude further analysis, the record must be unequivocal that a class member’s \nneed for compensatory services as a result of  a denial of FAPE dur ing the class period was \nevaluated  and determ ined  by the IEP team   at  a  properly constituted IEP team   meeting.  The \nguidelines developed by the independent m onitor for the hybrid IEP team to apply to determ ine \nwhether  a student m ay  be eligible for compensa tory  services  shall include g uidelines  for \nascertaining whether the class member is barred from seeking relief under this court ordered remedy \nas a result of a prior unequivocal evaluation and determination. \nIt shall be MPS’ burden to dem onstrate that the student was unequivocally evaluated for a \npotential  need for compensatory s ervices  and  that  a determ ination  was m ade.  A “Y” in the  \n“Discussed Comp Ed” column of a spreadsheet, (see Ex. 401), by itself, is insufficient. Or take the  \nexample of a student whose entry into special education was inappropriately delayed and whose IEP \nprovided 2 hours of individualized instruction in  addition to what would ordinarily be provided by \nthe  IEP. However, this additional instru ctional  time  was never ref erred  to as   “compensatory \nservices” or something substantively identical. (C.f. Docket No. 569 a t 58, Test. of Dr. Rogers-\nAdkinson.) In such an exam ple, the consideration of compensatory services was not unequivocal; \nthe analysis by the hybrid IEP team must continue to determine whether the class member is in need \nof  compensatory  services to rem edy  the denial   of FAPE. Nonetheless, the provision of any \nadditional instructional services beyond the minimum required by the IEP will certainly be relevant \n  57\n\nto the question of whether the class m ember has a present deficiency caused by a denial of FAPE \nduring the class period for which compensatory services are necessary. \nFurther, a subsequent determination that a student is no longer eligible for special education \nor a student having graduated with a general education diploma does not necessarily preclude the \nprovision of compensatory services for a denial  of FAPE during the cla ss period. Nonetheless, \nagain,  these facts shall be relevant in determ ining  what, if any, compensatory services are \nappropriate and should be addressed in the guidelines developed by the independent monitor.  \nIn the event that the evaluation of the class m ember presents issues that are not adeq uately \naddressed in the pre-established guidelines, the  hybrid IEP shall promptly notify the independent \nmonitor of this deficiency and the hybrid IEP team and the independent monitor shall cooperatively \nattempt to formulate guidelines for addressing the un-anticipated situation. \nB. Eligibility \n  MPS proposes that a group of  people significantly narrower than the entire class should be \nconsidered for compensatory services. For example, under MPS’ proposal, any person who would \notherwise be within the class but who has attained 22-years-of-age or has moved out of Milwaukee \nshould not be provided with any remedy. \n  The class is defined as: \nThose students eligible for special educat ion services from the Milwaukee Public \nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delay ed entry or \nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between \nthe IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \n \nThe time period for this class spans from September of 2000 through June of 2005.  \nThe court finds that the scope of M PS’ proposed remedy casts too narrow of a net. MPS’ \nproposal is limited to persons who are currently eligible to receive special education services from \nthe district. However, this case is no t so limited. Simply because a person is no longer eligible to \nreceive special education services from the district does not absolve the district of responsibility for \n  58\n\nany harm it may have caused by violating the student’s  rights to special education in the past. The \ndistrict may not avoid its remedial responsibility because the student moved outside the district or \nturned 22 years old. Class members, regardless of age or current residence, are entitled to equitable \nrelief from MPS that, to the extent possible, pl aces the individual in the position they would have \nbeen had it not been for MPS’ failure to com ply with the IDEA. Further, it is the conclusion of the \ncourt that a class member being removed from special education or a student’s graduation from the \ndistrict, even if that graduation  resulted in the obtainment of a regular education diploma does not \nnecessarily preclude an individual from being eligible for compensatory services as a class member. \nThus, the appropriate group that should be evaluated to determine whether each person is entitled to \ncompensatory education is the entire class, regardless of a member’s current age or residence.  \nIntegral with the question of who may be eligible for compensatory services is the question \nof how these class members will be informed of their potential eligibility. The plaintiffs seek to cast \na very wide net by requiring that “[w]ritten notice will be mailed to the last known address of all \npotential class members . . . .” (D ocket No. 585-2 at 2-3.)  It seems to the court that “all potential \nclass members” would necessarily include all general education students who were enrolled in MPS \nduring the class period, because any student may have an undiagnosed disability that should have \ncaused MPS to refer the student to be evaluated  for special education eligibility. MPS proposes the \nuse of both an individualized notice mailed to the last known address of students identified as being \npotential class members due to an untim ely initial evaluation or a history of suspensions and a  \ngeneral notice posted at certain locations around MPS. (Docket No. 552 at 6-8.)  \nOn the question of notice, a combination of general and individualized notice must be used. \nStudents  who  are readily identifiable as bei ng  potential class m embers  based upon certain \ndocumented facts, such as an evaluation having  been conducted beyond the statutory deadline or a \nhistory of suspensions, are entitled to receive notice mailed to their last known addresses.  \n  59\n\nThe court finds a general notice is  also necessary because any student enrolled in MPS \nduring the class period m ight be a class m ember. However, requiring an individualized m ailed \nnotice to each of these students’ last known addresses would be incredibly inefficient and a waste of \nmoney. A general notice certainly  should be posted in areas of th e schools and district buildings \nwhere parents are likely to see it. \nThe court shall not establish here the precise details regarding the manner that notice must \nbe provided or the contents of that notice; thes e are issues that the p arties must work towards \nresolving in a cooperative fashion and then subm it to the court in the form  of a mutually agreed-\nupon proposal. The parties shall set forth a joint proposal outlining the contents of the notice and the \ndetails for distributing a general and an individualized notice to identifiable potential class members \nthat shall then be subject to the final approval  of the court. Although this decision provides certain \nparameters to guide the parties’ discussions, it shall be incumbent upon the parties to work towards \nresolving the details and logistics of the notice.  \nWith respect to the dissemination of a general notice, the parties should consider whether it \nwould be practical to include a  general notice in certain regular  communications the district may \nhave with parents and other community members, such as parent newsletters. Additionally, because \ncertain potential class members may no longer be in the community and thus not in a positio n to \nview a general notice posted in  a school building, a for m of notice that has a far br oader reach is \nnecessary. The court concludes  that this broad notice is ac complished by posting the notice on \nMPS’ website. Additional m eans of communicating a general notice to potential class m embers \nshall be determined by the parties.  \nAs for the questions of how long the notice should be posted and how l ong a potential class \nmember should be given to respond to the notice,  these are m atters the parties must attempt to \nresolve based upon all relevant circum stances. However, the court finds th at MPS’ proposal that \n  60\n\npotential class members should be provided only 30 days in which to respond to the notice to likely \nbe insufficient. The notice must be posted for a period long enough for it to be reasonable to expect \nthat a parent were to see it and then there must be sufficient time to permit a potential class member \nto decide whether he or she wishes to respond.  The length of tim e in which class m embers may \nrespond will depend upon when it is  possible to finally post th e notice and open the period for \naccepting responses from potential class m embers. For example, it might not be reasonab le to \nassume that a parent would see a notice posted in his or her child’s school during a specific period if \nthe response period fell in the middle of the summer. However, if that period included the beginning \nof the school year or som e other time when parents are likely to be inside the school, the parties \nmay agree that an extended period is unnecessary. Generally, the court would expect that a 90 day \nperiod for posting the general notice and permitting potential class members to respond would be \nsufficient. The court expects to issue an order regarding the form and procedures for dissemination \nof notice within 30 days of the parties’ submission.  \nC. Parent Advocates \nThe  plaintiffs seek the requirem ent  that  MPS fund “at least 5 new   community-based \n(independent  of MPS) Parent A dvocates  to  assist at all com pensatory  education  services \ndetermination meetings and all initial IEP meetings for newly referred class members.” (Docket No. \n582-2 at 5.) The plaintiffs also seek the court to order MPS to fund an “expediter” who would have \n“the duty and authority to ensure that compensatory education services are delivered in a timely and \nappropriate manner.” (Docket No. 585-2 at 5.) These positions would be in addition to the separate \nindependent monitor (who, in the plaintiffs’ view,  would be separate from the monitor overseeing \nthe settlement between the DPI defendants and the plaintiffs).  \n  Certainly, navigating the special education process, particularly in the unique context of this \nlitigation, can be a daunting challenge for a parent  or guardian or individual class member, and the \n  61\n\nservices of an independent parent advocate m ay be beneficial for all parties involved. However, \nCongress designed the IDEA fra mework as a system aimed at being navigable for lay parents; if \n“parent  advocates”  were necessary   for a parent  to  navigate  the spe cial  education  framework, \nCongress would have required them.  \nFurther,  the court finds that providing fo r  an independent parent advocate w ould  be \nredundant in light of the circum stances of this case. Under the settlement agreement between the \nDPI defendants and the plaintiffs, DPI is funding a  parent trainer whose services may be available \nto class members. (See Docket No. 431-2 at 13.)  \nD. Segregated Fund \nAs part of their proposed remedy, the plaintiffs seek:  \nA separate account will be established to fund compensatory education services in an \namount to be determined by the parties and the Monitor. A separate fund is required \nto  ensure that individual school budgets   are not burdened by the c ost  of these  \nservices and that there are funds available for their delivery. \n \n(Docket No. 585-2.) The court disagrees with the plaintiffs that a separate fund is required. One way \nor another, MPS is going to pay the costs associat ed with complying with its obligations under this \ncourt ordered remedy. Whatever the expens e may be, it will no t be discretionary; it is not an \nexpense that can be red uced or eliminated in an  effort to balance a pere nnially strained budget. \nRequiring the costs ass ociated with complying with the court ordered rem edy be paid from a  \nsegregated and dedicated fund would simply create an unnecessary requirement that would make no \nsubstantive difference.   \nE. Dispute Resolution \nAs the court discussed above, the court reject s MPS’ request that the court im pose binding \narbitration as the exclusive means by which class members may be able to resolve disputes relating \nto decisions of the hybrid IEP team or independ ent monitor. MPS has presented no authority to \nindicate that the court is authorized to impose binding arbitration, either pursuant to the IDEA or as \n  62\n\npart of any inherent authority the court m ay possess when tasked with st ructuring a remedy for a \nclass of individuals.  \nNotwithstanding, it would be an  incredibly inefficient application of the court’s lim ited \nresources for every dispute that may arise to be resolved by this court. Thus, the primary means for \nresolving any disputes that m ay arise must be the good faith efforts of cooperation between the \nparties. Cooperation among parties in an effort to  avoid or resolve disputes is a principle prevalent \nthroughout the IDEA.  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e) and (f )(1)(B)(i). Further protraction of this \nlitigation benefits no party. It drains the lim ited resources of MPS and further delays any remedy a \nclass member may receive.  \nBuilt into the remedial framework outlined above are certain decisional junctures at which \nthe parties and the independent monitor m ust cooperate and attempt to agree to certain details \nnecessary to effect the court ordered rem edy. One such juncture is the de termination of who the \nindependent monitor shall appoint as permanent members of the hybrid IEP team . As is discussed \nabove, the court explicitly calls for the parties to attempt to reach an agreement on this point. But \ncooperation among the participants in this remedial framework shall be essential at all stages, not \njust those stages where the cour t has explicitly required it. T hus, it shall be incumbent upon the \nindependent  monitor  to  permit  the  parties, i.e .  class  counsel  and  MPS,  to of fer  input  to  the \nindependent monitor prior to the independent m onitor issuing any substantive order relating to the \nprocedures that will be utilized to effect this remedy (this requirement need not apply to ministerial \norders of the independent monitor, such as those relating to scheduling and the like).  \nTherefore, after consulting with the hybrid IEP team  and composing an initial draft of the \nguidelines that shall be utilized to determine whether a purported class member is a class member, \nhow rotating members shall be chosen for the hybrid IEP team, whether compensatory services are \nappropriate for a class m ember, and the nature of  those compensatory services, the independent \n  63\n\nmonitor shall submit the draft guidelines to MPS and class counsel for their review and input. If any \nparty objects to a guideline, the pa rties and the independent monitor  shall then attempt to reach an \nagreement as to any disputes. It shall be incu mbent upon the independent monitor to establish the \nprocedures that shall permit the parties to provide input and to permit dispute resolution.  \nNotwithstanding, after considering the input of  the parties and attempting to resolve any \ndisputed issues on substantive matters, such as who shall serve as a perm anent member on the \nhybrid IEP team or the guidelines that the hybrid IE P team shall apply, the  final decision shall be \nthat of the independent monitor.  Therefore, following the input and dispute resolution process, the \nindependent monitor shall file an order pursuant to Rule 53(d) incorporating his determination as to \nthe guidelines that shall be f ollowed or any other substantive m atter. The parties may file an \nobjection with the court to this ord er of the i ndependent monitor in acco rdance with Rule 53(f). \nUpon the filing of any substantive order by the independent monitor, including the order appointing \nthe permanent members to the hybrid IEP team  or any order outlining the guidelines that shall be \napplied by the hybrid IEP team , either party shall have  14 days in which to file an objection. The \nnon-objecting party shall respond no later than 5 days after the objection is filed. No reply shall be \npermitted absent leave of the court. Hearings shall be scheduled at the court’s discretion. The court \nshall then resolve the party’s objection in accordance with Rule 53(f).  \n  A slightly different procedure shall apply to disputes relating to whether or not a purported \nclass member is, in fact, a class m ember. As discussed above, the hybrid IEP team is tasked w ith \ninitially making this decision. Upon completing its review of all persons who responded to the class \nnotice, the hybrid IEP team shall notify all respondents to the class notice of its decision to include \nor exclude the respondent in the class. Any individual whom the hybrid IEP team determines is not \na class member shall be informed of the right to object to a decision of exclusion and be informed as \nto the procedure for filing an objection. The procedure for filing an objection shall be established by \n  64\n\nthe independent monitor in accordance with the terms set forth here. The hybrid IEP team shall then \npromptly send to the independent monitor its list  indicating which respondents it determined to be \nclass members. Additionally, the hybrid IEP team shall provide to the independent monitor a list of \nindividuals who responded to the class notice but were excluded and  a brief explanation as to why \neach was determined to not be a class m ember. The independent monitor shall promptly provide \nthese documents to class counsel and MPS.  \nAn individual who responded  to the class notice but who  was found to not be a class \nmember shall be perm itted to file an objection to the hybrid IEP  team’s determination with the \nindependent monitor. The independent monitor shall then conduct a de novo review of the evidence \npresented to the hybrid IEP team to determine if the individual is a class member. The independent \nmonitor shall notify the individual of his decision and the indivi dual’s right to object to a decision \nof exclusion in accordance with the terms set forth herein.  \n  Upon  the com pletion  of the independent  monitor’s  de novo review of any objecting \npurported class members, the independent monitor shall file an order in accordance with Rule 53(d). \nIn  this  order,  the  independent  monitor  shall  identify  those  individuals  the hyb rid  IEP tea m \ndetermined to be class m embers as well as  any additional individuals he de termined to be class  \nmembers based upon the independent m onitor’s de novo review following the objection of an \nexcluded  class m ember.  Additionally,  the  independent  monitor  shall  file  with  the  court  a list \nidentifying any purported class m ember who filed an objection with the independent monitor but \nwho the independent m onitor determined was not a class m ember. Any purported class member \nwho was not included in the independent m onitor’s order identifying class members and who filed \nan appropriate objection with the independent m onitor may file an objection with the  court within \n14 days of the independent monitor informing the individual of the unfavorable decision.  \n  65\n\nFurther, at this stage, MPS m ay object to the inclusion of any individual whom  it does not \nbelieve qualifies as a class m ember. MPS may object by filing an objection within  14 days of the \nfiling of the independent monitor’s order identifying all class members. The court shall then inform \nthe individual of MPS’ objection. The individual and class counsel shall then have 14 days from the \ndate of the filing of MPS’ objection in which to respond. No reply shall be permitted absent leave of \nthe court. Hearings shall be sc heduled at the court’s discretion.  The court shall th en resolve the \nparty’s objection in accordance with Rule 53(f). \nAs for disputes relating to the resolution of the claim of any individual class member, e.g. \ndisputes regarding a determ ination as to wheth er the class member is eligible for compensatory \nservices or the nature of com pensatory services ordered, any disput es must first be brought to the \nattention of the independent monitor. Either the class member or MPS, as the local edu cation \nagency, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), m ay object to a de termination of the hybrid IEP team . The \nindependent monitor shall assume the role of mediator and attempt to encourage the parties to arrive \nat a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute. \nIf the class m ember and MPS are unable to  agree upon a resolution of the dispute, the \nindependent monitor shall then co nduct an adjudicative review of  the disputed decision of the  \nhybrid IEP team. The review of the independent monitor shall be limited to ensuring that the hybrid \nIEP team complied with the pre-established guidelines and that the determination of the hybrid IEP \nteam is not plainly erroneous. The  independent monitor shall either affirm the determination of the \nhybrid IEP team or, if the IEP team failed to comply with the guidelines or engaged in plain error, \nremand the matter to the hybrid IEP team for reconsideration. If the hybrid IEP team appropriately \ncomplied  with the pre-established guidelines a nd  the decision was not  plainly  erroneous, the \nindependent monitor shall affirm the decision of the hybrid IEP team. \n  66\n\nThe independent monitor’s affirmance of the decision of the hybrid IEP team shall constitute \na final decision of the local education agency that may be challenged exclusively through the State \nof Wisconsin’s pre-existing due process framework under the IDEA.  See Wis. Stat. § 115.80;  see \nalso 20 U.S.C. § 1415. The right to challenge a deci sion relating to compensa tory services shall \nexist regardless of any procedural bar that  might have existed absent this class rem edy, see, e.g., \nWis. Stat. § 115.80(1)(a) (one-year  statute of limitations), up to  and including, if necessary, the \ninitiation of a civil action independent of this case.  \nF. Named Plaintiffs \n  The individually named plaintiffs seek a wide variety of compensatory services. Melanie V. \nseeks “coverage of any expenses related to he r completion of the GED  program at MATC, . . . \n[t]ution, books, supplies and trans portation stipend and tutoring fo r at least two year of post-\nsecondary education at the school of [her] choice,”  as well as a laptop co mputer and a high speed \ninternet connection. Jamie S. seeks “[t]uition and services to take all necessary child care and child \ndevelopment  related courses at M.A.T.C. in cluding  books, supplies, lab or sim ilar  fees, \ntransportation stipend and individual tutoring at th e appropriate time,” a laptop computer and high \nspeed  internet connection, “[t]raining on self -determination,  self-advocacy[,] sexuality . . . \nbudgeting, money management, food planning and preparation .  . . [and] [j]ob placem ent and \ntraining at the appropriate time.” (Docket No. 582-2 at 7.) Bryan E.  similarly seeks compensatory \nservices  for a m inimum  of four years including  “[t]uition  and services to tak e  all neces sary \nplumbing related courses at M.A.T.C. including books , supplies, lab or similar fees, transportation \nstipend and individual tutoring,” a laptop computer with a high speed internet connection, and job \nplacement assistance. (Docket No. 582-2 at 7-8.)  \n  MPS proposes a remedy for only Melanie V. and Jamie S. For Jamie S., MPS proposes to \nreconvene her IEP team “to determ ine whether compensatory education is necessary due to a two \n  67\n\nmonth delay in her referral for special education services.” (Docket No. 552 at 1-2.) MPS proposes \na similar remedy for Melanie V. but any remedy for her would be contingent upon her re-enrolling \nin MPS. (Docket No. 552 at 1.)  \nFirst, at the liability ph ase of this litig ation, the named plaintiffs served to exem plify the \nsorts of Child Find failures that were systemic in MPS. And at the remedy phase of this litigation, \nthe named plaintiffs demonstrated that these systemic failures resulted in lasting consequences for  \nclass members. Although the court received evidence indicating the future aspirations of the named \nplaintiffs and vague indications as  to the sorts of services that m ight be beneficial to persons in \nsituations similar to those of the named plaintiffs, at no point did the court receive specific evidence \nfrom  educational professionals who engaged in   an ind ividualized  assessment  of the nam ed \nplaintiffs, determined the nature of any denial  of FAPE, and determined precisely what sorts of \nservices were necessary to restore that floor of opportunity that was lost as a result of the denial of \nFAPE.  These  sorts of individualized determ inations  are essential to the IDE A  and are the \ndeterminations that an IEP team is expected to make. Absent such an individualized determination \nor detailed individualized evidence, the court is in no position to  order any remedy for the named \nplaintiffs. Accordingly, it is the conclusion of this court that if any named plaintiff is entitled to any \nindividualized remedy as a resu lt of this action, it is to be  found through the system  the court \ndevises here as being applicable to the entire class.  \nHowever, to the extent that the court’s assessment of the parties’ proposed remedies may be \nbeneficial in offering guidance to the independ ent monitor and the hybrid IEP team , it may be \ninstructive to note that, the nature of the compensatory services proposed by the plaintiffs strikes the \ncourt as an effort to place the n amed plaintiffs in the best possible position they might be in had it \nnot been for a denial of FAPE. As discussed above, this is inconsistent with the requirements of the \nIDEA. Rather, any compensatory services th at might be appropriate must be aim ed at remedying \n  68\n\nthe wrong, i.e. placing the na med plaintiffs and class m embers in the position s they would have \nbeen had it not been for the de nial of FAPE. Likewise, MPS’ proposed remedy strikes the court as \nagain being too narrow. For example, as discusse d above, there is no requirem ent that a class \nmember be currently enrolled at MPS to be provided with compensatory services.  \nVI. DPI’S MOTION \n  The  DPI defendants have filed a m otion  seeking  a  declaration  that  this  court’s  order \napproving  the class s ettlement  between the p laintiffs  and DPI precludes MPS   from  seeking \ncontribution from DPI for the costs associated with implementing the remedy ordered by this court \nor if the court’s approval of the class settlement did not address this issue, a declaration that MPS \ncannot later seek contribution from DPI. (Docket No. 559.) MPS has responded, (Docket No. 582), \nand DPI has replied, (Docket No.  589.) For the reasons set forth be low, the court shall deny DPI’s \nmotion.  \n  In this court’s order approving the class settlement between the plaintiffs and DPI, the court \nacknowledged MPS’ objection that the settlem ent did not require DPI to pay any portion of any \ncompensatory services the court may order after Phase III. (Docket No. 471 at 14.) However, at no \npoint did the court hold  that DPI was forever precluded from be ing required to contribute to any \nremedy that the court might impose following Phase III; that issue was not before the court. W hen \nthe court was deciding the joint motion for approval of the class settlement, the issue before the \ncourt was whether the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members.  \n  As for DPI’s alternative request that the court now declare that  it is not responsible for any \nportion of the expenses related to the rem edy the court sets forth here, the  court finds no basis to \nmake such a declaration. DPI is dismissed as a defendant in this case. The court no longer possesses \nthe jurisdiction over DPI that would be necessary  to make such a finding. For the same reason, the \ncourt has not and cannot order DPI to be responsib le for any portion of the remedy set forth above \n  69\n\n(although the court acknowledges that this remedy may indirectly result in certain costs to the state \nas a result of class m embers challenging compensatory services determinations of the hybrid IEP \nteam through the statutory due process framework). If MPS has a claim for contribution against DPI \nin light of Board of Educ. v. Nancy E., 207 F.3d 931 (7th Cir. 2000), if it may be found at all, it may \nbe found only in an action independent of the present case. Accordingly, DPI’s motion, (Docket No. \n559), is denied.  \nVII. CONCLUSION \nIt  is the co nclusion  of  the court that MPS’ system ic  failures  to m eet  its Child   Find \nobligations necessitates an individualized evaluation of all class members to determine whether \ncompensatory services are appropriate for a re sulting denial of FAPE, and accordin gly, the court \nhereby  orders the rem edy  set forth herein. T his  remedy  shall r equire  the  establishment  of  a \nprocedural framework in which these determ inations may be made. The court shall appoint an \nindependent  monitor  to oversee the developm ent  and implem entation  of this process. The \nindependent monitor shall appoint MPS staff members to serve as permanent members of the hybrid \nIEP team. In consultation and cooperation with the permanent members of the hybrid IEP team, the \nindependent monitor shall establish guidelines for the hybrid IEP team to apply when determining if \na  purported  class  member  is, in   fact, a class  member,  and the r elief,  if  any,  in the   form \ncompensatory services that any individual class member may receive pursuant to the court ordered \nremedy.  \nThe parties must engage in good faith efforts  to resolve any disputes  that may develop. \nHowever, should the parties fail to reach a mutually agreed upon resolution, disputes relating to the \nprocedural framework or a purported class member’s eligibility as a class member, shall ultimately \nbe resolved by the court in accordance with the framework set forth above. Disputes relating to the \n  70\n\nindividualized remedy that any class member shall receive under this court ordered remedy shall be \nresolved within the existing administrative framework under the IDEA.  \n  The next step of this litigation requires the parties to meet in a good faith effort to reach an \nagreement as to certain essential matters set forth above. First, the parties must identify and attempt \nto agree upon an independent m onitor to oversee this remedy. Second, the parties must attem pt to \nagree on the details as to the procedures that s hall be utilized to provide individualized notice to \ncertain readily identifiable potential class and a general notice that is  likely to reach other potential \nclass members who may not be so readily identifiable. This shall also require the parties to attempt \nto agree as to the specific contents of any proposed notice.  \nTherefore, no later than July 24, 2009, the parties shall submit joint proposals detailing the \nmeans that shall be used to provide individual and general notice to potential class members, as well \nas the contents of any proposed notice. If after g ood faith efforts, the parties are unable to reach a  \nmutual agreement, the parties shall each submit separate proposals.  \nFurther, no later than July 24, 2009, the parties shall submit jointly the name, curriculum \nvitae, affidavit pursuant to Rule 53(b)(3)(a), an d information indicating the terms under which the \nindependent monitor shall be compensated for the proposed independent monitor. If after good faith \nefforts, the parties are unable to reach a m utual agreement, the parties shall each subm it such \ninformation for up to two proposed independent monitors.  \nSO ORDERED. \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 9th day of June 2009. \n \n \n \n             s/ AARON E.

Case No. 01-C-928 \nMILW  AUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, \nSPENCE KORTE,  U.S. OIST. COURT EAST DIST. WISC. \nWISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION,  FILED \nELIZABETH BURMASTER, and \nMILW  AUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS,  MAY  - 3 2002 \nDefendants. \nORDER \nOn March 20,2002, this court conducted a scheduling conference, pursuant to Rule 16 ofthe \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In accordance with the briefing schedule established at that \nconference, the two motions discussed are now briefed and ready for resolution. \nFirst, the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association (MTEA) has filed a motion to intervene \nin this action, pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) and (b) ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; In addition, \nin a letter dated March 19, 2002, MTEA requests notice of informal interviews and depositions. \nSecond, the plaintiffs have filed a motion for a declaratory order, and have subsequently filed a motion \nto compeL \nI.  MTEA's Motion to Intervene \nAs a preliljllinary matter, the Executive Director ofMTEA, Sam Carmen, represents that it is \nthe duly certified collective bargaining representative, under§ 111.70 Wis. Stat., for MPS regular and \nspecial education teachers, including teachers involved in particular aspec~s of diagnosis and special \nservices such as diagnostic teachers, guidance counselors, school social workers, speech pathologists, \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 1 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n.. \n• \nA \noccupational therapists and physical therapists, mobility and orientation specialists, and school nurses. \nCarmen Affid. ~ 2.  In addition, MTEA represents that it is the collective bargaining representative \nof educational assistants, some of whom assist teachers in delivering special education services.  Id. \nIn its motion, MTEA argues that it is entitled to intervene both as of right and on a permissive \nbasis, pursuant to Rule 24(a) and (b). MTEA seeks limited intervention, specifically in the remedial \nportion of this litigation as an undesignated intervenor. More particularly, the scope of intervention \nis to share its insight in addition to input at mediation or remedial phase since any potential remedial \nplan would affect the wages, hours, and working conditions ofMTEA's members. \nAs grounds, MTEA submits that relief obtained either by mediation or ordered by this court \nwill directly involve bargaining unit members' wages, hours, and working conditions. MTEA seeks \nintervention to ensure the collective bargaining rights of its members. \nIn support ofi ntervention as ofr ight, MTEA contends that the organization ofd elivery systems \nto fulfill the IDEA directly impact wages, hours, and working conditions ofMTEA's bargaining unit \nmembers. Since the labor agreements between MPS and MTEA contain provisions in those areas and \nthere is a duty to bargain over changes in educational policy that impact those areas, MTEA argues \nthat it has an interest in the subject-matter of this action.  Next, MTEA argues that its interest is not \nadequately represented by the parties currently involved in this case. \nAlternatively, as regards permissive intervention, MTEA argues that it is appropriate because \nMTEA shares an interest in potential remedial measures. MTEA submits that it seeks an intervention \nin this case similar to that granted in the Milwaukee school desegregation case of the 1970's.  See \nArmstrong v. O'Connell, 75 F.RD. (E.D. Wis. 1977). \n2 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 2 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n• \nAll of the parties have responded to  MTEA's motion.  The State defendants, i.e., the \nDepartment ofPublic Instruction and Elizabeth Burmaster, do not object to the motion to intervene \nfor purposes of and under the conditions set forth in MTEA 's motion. \nLikewise, as to the motion to intervene, defendants Milwaukee Board of School Directors, \nMilwaukee Public Schools, and Spence Korte (collective the \"MPS defendants\") do not object to \nMTEA's motion for the purposes and under the conditions set forth in that motion. \nFinally, the plaintiffs contend that MTEA does not have a right of intervention under Rule \n24( a), i.e., intervention as ofr ight. The plaintiffs assert that MTEA' s ability to protect its interests will \nnot be impaired absent its intervention because of the Milwaukee Public Schools' continuing \nbargaining duty with MTEA.  Nonetheless, the plaintiffs believe that it may be expeditious to have \nMTEA participate in fashioning appropriate remedies.  Thus, the plaintiffs agree to stipulate to \npermissive intervention under Rule 24(b) by MTEA, for the limited purpose of participation in the \nremedial portion. \nAt this juncture, intervention is premature for two reasons. First, this litigation is in its nascent \nstage. The remedial stage, assuming liability is found, is far into the future.  At that point, persuasive \narguments can be made for intervention.  Second, this is a putative class action; i.e., the motion for \nclass certification has not been brought, much less has a class been certified.  Class certification, if \ngranted, will change the dynamics ofthe litigation. In other words, at this time there are seven named \nplaintiffs, assuming liability and no class certification, how many educators would need to be involved \nin the remedial phase?  Certainly, not a substantial portion ofMTEA's members. \n· Although the court will deny the motion for intervention without prejudice, this ruling should \nnot foreclose MTEA' s informal involvement in the discovery issues. Now, the court will turn to those \nissues vis-a-vis MTEA's request for notice. \n3 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 3 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nII.  MTEA's Request for Notice \nAlthough MTEA does not take a position with respect to the ethical issues raised by the \nplaintiffs motion for declaratory order, it requests specific notice of contemplated discovery, both \nformal and informaL  As the basis for this request, MTEA submits it has a concern that statements \ngiven by MPS employees might adversely affect their employment. \nMore particularly, as regards informal discovery MTEA requests, \nthat any procedures for informal discovery include three working days \nnotice  to  the  MTEA  of any  interviews  plaintiffs  seeks  with  a \nbargaining  unit  member  and  an  opportunity  for  an  MTEA \nrepresentative to be present and provide advice, if necessary at such \ninterview. \nMTEALetterto the Court, dated March 19,2002. \nWith respect to formal discovery through depositions, MTEA requests that it receive \"notice \nof depositions of its members either as intervenor, if that motion is granted, or by arrangements with \ncounsel for the plaintiffs and MPS.\" Id. \nThe State defendants do not object the request in MTEA's letterofMarch 19,2002. The MPS \ndefendants respond that if there were an informal discovery program, they would not object to \nMTEA's involvement as proposed, subject to and conditioned on compliance with both Wisconsin \nand federal law regarding the confidentiality of pupil records.  Finally, the plaintiffs agree to give \nMTEA three  days  advance notice of informal in-person interviews and  formal  depositions  of \nbargaining unit members that they seek to-interview or depose.  However, the plaintiffs submit that \nit is unduly burdensome and time-consuming to give MTEA advance notice ofbriefinitial discussions \nwith bargaining unit members.  The plaintiffs point to the situation where bargaining unit members \ninitiate contact with plaintiffs' counsel. \n4 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 4 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n0 \n. \nThe matter of notice regarding preliminary informal discovery will have to be worked out \nbetween plaintiffs' counsel and MTEA.  Of course, nothing precludes MTEA from advising its \n. \nmembers in advance that they may be contacted by plaintiffs' attorneys in regard to this litigation and \nrequesting that MTEA attorneys be promptly notified. \nAs discussed above, MTEA's motion to  intervene will be denied without prejudice, as \npremah1re. \nIII.  Plaintiffs' Motion for a Declaratory Order \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), the plaintiffs have filed a motion for a declaratory order. \nIn that motion, they seek an order \"expressly pennitting plaintiffs counselto contact, interview, meet, \nor otherwise obtain information from current and former non-managerial employees of the defendant \nMilwaukee Public Schools (MPS), outside the presence of MPS counsel.\"  Pl. Brief in Support of \nDecl. Mtn. at 11. \nAs a preliminary matter, the plaintiffs bring their motion pursuant to 28U.S.C. § 2201(a). \nThat statute concerns declaratory judgments, and it provides that any declaration by the court shall \nhave \"the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.\"  § 2201(a). \nWhile it is true that the plaintiffs arerequesting that this court provide them with declaratory guidance \nin order to avoid potential ethical and/or legal complaints, the matters with which they have concern \nare within the context ofthe management of discovery. As such, the court will entertain the plaintiffs' \nmotion under its general supervision of discovery instead of pursuant to § 2201. \nAddressing the underlying subject-matter ofthe motion, this district has adopted Wisconsin's \nethical rules as its own rules of professional conduct, subject to modification by this court.  General \nL.R. 83.10.  Thus, Wisconsin SCR 20: 4.2 provides the framework for determining whether the \ncontact the plaintiffs seek is permissible. \n5 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 5 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nIf. P  Iii \nThe text of that Rule provides, \nIn representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the \nsubject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to  be \nrepresented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the  J. \nconsent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so. \nSCR 20:4.2. Of import for the plaintiffs' motion is the second paragraph ofthe Comment to the Rule. \nIn relevant part, that paragraph provides, \nIn the case of an organization, this rule prohibits communications by \na lawyer for one party concerning the matter in representation with \npersons  having  a  managerial  responsibility  on  behalf  of  the \norganization, and with any other person whose act or omission in \nconnection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for \npurposes  of civil  or  criminal  liability  or  whose  statement  may \nconstitute an admission on the part of the organization. \nSCR 20:4.2, Comment. \nAlthough this court has adopted the Wisconsin rules of professional conduct, \"[o  ]nee the \nfederal court adopts the text of the state rules, it has its own professional responsibility standards, and \nany interpretation it may wish to give is not binding in any sense on the [state] courts.\"  Weibrecht \nv. Southern Illinois Transfer, Inc., 241 F.3d 875, 878-79 (7th Cir. 2001).  In that case, the Seventh \nCircuit upheld the district court's interpretation of its local rule of professional responsibility that \nadopted the text of the Illinois state court rules, finding that the district court was within its discretion. \nId. at 882. The Seventh Circuit noted that \"even though in this case the district court has incorporated \nIllinois's rules by reference, nothing compelled the district court to adopt the same interpretation of \nthose mles that has been adopted by an intermediate appellate court.\" Jd. Moreover, parenthetically, \nthe Seventh Circuit noted that, \nWe see no indication in the materials accompanying the professional \nconduct rules of the Southern District ofillinois that the district court \nintended  to  bind  itself to  follow  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court's \ninterpretation of the Illinois rules ... \n6 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 6 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nII  !!PI. Ill  I 'it . II I! i1  UlliliilJf I'IJ JQ . ...  ! F 11111  'f  ''f. \nA \n\"\"\" \nAgainst this background, this court will now examine the plaintiffs' motion vis-a-vis the \nEastern District of Wisconsin's ethical rules.  The plaintiffs submit that there are three categories of \nindividuals who are at issue in their motion, i.e., individuals whom plaintiffs' counsel seeks ex-parte \ncontact to  conduct informal discovery.  More particularly these categories consist of:  (1) MPS \nemployees who have children in the putative class; (2) former MPS employees who do not have \nchildren in the putative class; and (3) current non-managerial employees who do not have children in \nthe putative class. \nAt the Rule 16 conference, the court suggested a possible way to proceed.  That suggestion \nwas that plaintiffs' counsel may seek through informal discovery basic background information and \nalso seek to ascertain who should be considered as a candidate for formal discovery procedures. This \nsuggested informal discovery contained certain limitations regarding its subsequent use during the \ncourse of this litigation. \nDespite the court's suggestion, .the parties have been unable to resolve their differences, and \ncourt intervention is necessary.  In their. reply brief, the plaintiffs state that they do not object to the \ncourt's suggestion.  Rather, they submit that \n[D]espite the court's request that the parties discuss the possibility of \nagreeing  to  allow  the  plaintiffs'  attorneys  to  have  ex  parte \ncommunication with current and former MPS  employees, but not \nallowing any statements obtained in such meetings to  be used as \nadmission  against  the  MPS  defendants,  MPS  apparently  remains \nadamant  about insisting on a blanket prohibition to  any ex parte \ncommunications. For the record, although the plaintiff's do not think \nit is necessary to put into an order, the plaintiffs have no difficulty with \nthe concept that they will be unable to use the statements of current and \nformer MPS employees, obtained in an ex parte manner, as admissions \nin  this  litigation.  Plaintiffs  are  well  aware  of the  ethical  and \nevidentiary rules proscribing such use.  Plaintiffs are merely seeking \nthrough  this  motion,  an  expeditious  way  to  obtain  preliminary \ninformation so they can determine which current and former MPS \nemployees should be deposed. \n7 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 7 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n• \n• \n. \nPl. Reply at 2-3. \nOn the other hand, MPS counsel vigorously contest ex parte contact as to all three categories. \nAs a preliminary matter, the MPS defendants submit that the plaintiffs' counsel has refused to discuss \nthe option of conducting informal discovery, but with defense counsel present. Plaintiffs reject this \nproposal out ofhand. \nThat option aside, in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion, the MPS defendants submit four \nreasons for denying the plaintiffs informal discovery. First, the defendants contend that the nature of \nMPS employees' duties and responsibilities under the IDEA, which is the central subject ofthis case, \nplaces many current and former employees in a position where their acts and/ or omissions may be \nused to impute liability to MPS.  Second, the defendants submit that a carte blanche ordered \npermitting ex parte communications with innumerable current and former employees fails to provide \nMPS with a reasonable opportunity to anticipate or object to any specific ex parte-contact until it is \ntoo late.  Third, the defendants submit that MPS and its students will suffer irreparable harm if an \nemployee inadvertently discloses confidential student information, in violation of§ 118.125 Wis. Stat \nand the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (~'FERP A\").  Fourth, the defendants assert that \nthe inability to clearly identify appropriate and inappropriate contacts will result in great conflict and \ncopious disputes, all of which could be averted through the use of formal discovery methods. \nThe MPS defendants contend that the appropriate distinction drawn by the Comment to \nWisconsin Supreme Court Rule 20:4.2 is whether an individual's acts or omissions in connection with \nthe issues being litigated may be imputed to MPS or constitute an admission on behalf ofMPS. Next, \nthe MPS defendants present four arguments in support of its position that the plaintiffs' counsel \nshould refrain from engaging in ex parte communications with MPS employees, regardless of status. \n8 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 8 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n{Rev.S/82) \n\n0  n \nv \nCiting 34 C.F.R. § 300.350, the MPS defendants argue that the full range of employees could \npotentially subject MPS to liability.  In addition, the MPS defendants point to the possibility of \nliability under the theory of respondeat superior, citing Terra Int'l Inc. v. Mississippi Chemical Corp., \n913 F.Supp 1306, 1322 (N.D. Iowa 1996). \nThus, the MPS defendants propose whatthey characterize as a simple solution to this dispute. \nIn particular, they request that the plaintiffs be held accountable to the ethical rules and be prohibited \nfrom ex parte contact with any individuals whose acts or omissions in relation to this case could \npotentially subject MPS to liability.  The defendants' proposed solution is really not so simple, for \nhow would the plaintiffs know in advance of contact which individuals might subject MPS to \nliability? · \nThe dispute between the parties must be resolved with a balanced approach.  First, the court \nrecognizes the plaintiffs' need for basic information in order to prosecute their case.  Requiring the \nplaintiffs to proceed solely by means of formal discovery is not practical and is too expensive.  It \nwould needlessly disrupt the lives of numerous MPS employees. On the other hand, the defendants' \nconcerns about being potentially exposed to liability without having counsel present when statements \nare obtained is legitimate. The court's previously proposed solution involves balancing the need for \npreliminary information that the plaintiffs are seeking against the defendants' liability concerns.  It \nwill hopefully provide a balance which will enable the parties to proceed with discovery without the \n\"conflict and copious disputes\" the defendants believe will emerge. \nMore particularly, the court will establish the following procedure.  Plaintiffs' counsel may \nseekinformal discovery, consisting ofi nterviewing, meeting with, or otherwise obtaining information, \nfrom current and former non-managerial employees of MPS outside the presence of MPS counsel. \nSuch informal discovery is subject to limitations on its subsequent use in this litigation.  First, \n9 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 9 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\ninformation obtained can only be used for the purpose of preliminary discovery; the plaintiffs are \nprecluded from singularly or cumulatively using such information in an attempt to establish the \ndefendants' liability.  If the plaintiffs wish to use the information gathered informally in an attempt \nto impute same to the defendants, they must resort to formal discovery.  This limitation does not \nforeclose plaintiffs' use of the informally gathered information in support of their motion for class \ncertification.  Second, plaintiffs' counsel must give adequate warnings to the individuals contacted \nprior to commencing the interview regarding privacy laws and regulations, i.e., § 118.125 Wis. Stat. \nand FERPA    These warnings should be provided both orally and in writing.  Counsel should, of \ncourse, maintain copies of all written warnings. \nAs regards the class ofMPS employees who have children in the putative class, including one \nof the named plaintiffs, Flora Y., plaintiffs' counsel may have unfettered contact with them in the \nnormal course of the attorney-client relationship. This relationship, however, does not authorize any \nMPS employee to reveal confidential information relating to students that are not their children or \nminors over whom they are guardians. \nIV.  Plaintiff's Motion to Compel \nAs a preliminary matter, the plaintiffs have not complied with the \"personal consultation\" \nrequirement of Civil Local Rule 37.1. Nonetheless, as the court indicated in its letter, dated AprillO, \n2002, the court decided to entertain that motion because it did not foresee the parties reaching an \namicable solution on their own.  The court's prescience is borne out in the plaintiffs reply brief. \nPursuant to Rule 37(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the plaintiffs seeks an \norder compelling the MPS defendants, i.e., Milwaukee Board of School Directors, Milwaukee Public \nSchools, and Spence Korte, to provide the plaintiff with documents responsive to Plaintiffs' First \nRequest for Production of Documents, Request Number 16. \n10 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 10 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n• \n• \n. \n. \nIn particular, that item requests, \nAll  documents within your actual  or constructive possession and \ncreated or modified on or after 3/1100 and before 12/17/01 created or \nmodified by, directed to or referring to counsel employed by Quarles \n& Brady LLP, including Gary M. Ruesch. \nPl.'s Mtn. to Compel, Ex. A at~ 16.  The MPS defendants have responded, \nObject to this request.. The documents described are attorney-client \nprivileged and/or work product. \nPl.'s Mtn to Compel, Ex. Bat,[ 16. \nIn support of their motion, the plaintiffs submit that they do not seek privileged information. \nAlthough they initially contended that there was no confidential attorney-client privilege between \n. \n' \nQuarles & Brady and MPS, in reply, the plaintiffs concede that MPS and Quarles & Brady appear to \nhave entered into an attorney client-relationship as of September 25, 2001. Accordingly, the plaintiffs \nmodify their request to exclude documents produced on or after September 25, 2001.  Despite this \nconcession, the plaintiffs continue to argue that no such relationship existed prior to that time. Finally, \nthe plaintiffs contend that even if a privilege exists, it was waived by reports that Quarles & Brady \nprovide to the Department of Public Instruction (\"DPI), one of the co-defendants in this case. \nResponding, MPS maintains its objection on the basis of attorney-client privilege and/ or \nwork-product doctrine. In support of this claim, MPS submits that Quarles & Brady and Attorney \nRuesch have represented MPS in the past on various matters and it would have been ludicrous for \nI \nAttorney Ruesch to have suggested otherwise.  This assertion is supported by Ruesch's affidavit in \nsupport ofMPS' response.  See Ruesch Affid. at~ 3. \nFurther review ofRuesch' s affidavit reveals that Ruesch told Attorney Jeffrey Spitzer-Resnick, \nplaintiffs' counsel, that neither he nor Quarles and Brady \"was serving as litigation counsel\" in this \ncase.  Id. at '!16.  Next, Ruesch avers that he and Quarles & Brady \"did engage in legal advising and \n11 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 11 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n•  If II  I  i  Iii II!  111J lL lHQII(Il \nA \nv \n. \nconsultation with the  City Defendants with the expectation, by all parties involved,  that such \nconsultation and advice was privileged.\"  Id. at~ 7.  Finally, Ruesch avers that \"[a]t no time did I \nindicate to Mr. Spitzer-Resnick that Quarles & Brady LLP would not represent the City Defendants \nin this matter, nor did I ever misrepresent the status of our representation of the City Defendants with \nregard to this particular case.\" Id. at~ 9. \nNext, MPS responds that the plaintiffs' reliance on DPl' s payment of fees to Quarles and \nBrady, pointing to a letter attached as Exhibit A to MPS' brief.  Specifically, that letter, dated \nDecemb.er 4, 2000, from Gary M. Ruesch to Sheila C. Ellefson of the DPI, represents that, \n... we have been retained by MPS to assist it in developing, reviewing, \nand implementing its special education forms and procedures.  In the \ncourse of our representation, we have been advising MPS regarding \nthe threatened litigation involving the Wisconsin Coalition for \nAdvocacy since it substantially relates to many ofthe procedures \nfollowed  by  MPS  in  implementing  state  and  federal  special \neducation  law.  As we  understand  it,  the  Department  of Public \nInstruction  has  made  an  arrangement  with  MPS  to  provide \ndiscretionary grant money for our services.  It has always been the \nunderstanding  of Quarles  &  Brady  that  we  represent  MPS \nsingularly. \nMPS' Resp., Ex. A (emphasis added).  Thus, the relationship between DPI and Quarles & Brady is \nthat DPI is providing the funding for the law firm to represent MPS.  Moreover, the letter supports \nMPS' position that it had an attorney-client relationship with Quarles & Brady prior to September 25, \n2001. \nIn summary, the court is satisfied that an attorney-client relationship existed prior to September \n25, 2001, and covers the period in dispute.  Therefore, in response to plaintiffs' discovery requests, \nMPS is required to prepare a privilege log, which will specifically indicate what information it \nbelieves is privileged.  MPS submits that it is preparing such a log.  If there are remaining disputes \n12 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 12 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n0  0 \n. \nas to what is privileged, the parties should meet in a good faith effort to resolve the disputes; only \nthen, should court intervention be sought. \nAs regards the plaintiffs' argument that the privilege was waived by sharing information with \nDPI, MPS contends that the plaintiffs have not submitted evidence regarding the existence of such \nsharing.  Notwithstanding, MPS argues that even if information was shared, it and DPI have related \nfunctions and goals, akin to related companies, thus there is no waiver, citing Leybold-Heraes Tech., \nInc. v. Midwest Instrument Co., Inc.,  118 F.R.D. 609, 613 (E.D. Wis: 1987).  In addition, MPS \nsubmits that it and DPI are co-defendants in this case, and argues that sharing of information in the \ncourse of preparing a joint defense does not constitute a waiver of privilege.  In reply, the plaintiffs \ncontinue to assert that information was shared. \nAs a final matter, despite the parties' failure to adequately comply with the Local Rule, both \nparties imprudently seek sanctions.  It is apparent that if the parties had sat down face-to-face, or at \nleast talked by phone, rather than exchanging e-mails and voice mails, the matter in dispute, if not \nfully resolved, would have been limited at the outset.  Thus, the cross-requests for sanctions will be \ndenied.  The very nature of this case requires that counsel for the parties work together to avoid \nneedless time and effort, and cost to their respective clients.  Counsel have demonstrated that such \ncooperative efforts  are possible,  without jeopardizing vigorous  representation of their clients' \npositions, e.g. the joint stipulation for the protective order and their view regarding intervention by \nMTEA.  Therefore, the parties are forewarned that this court will not consider any future discovery \nrelated motions that are not in strict compliance with both the Federal and Local Rules. Such motions \nwill be summarily denied. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that MTEA's motion to intervene (Docket #32) in denied \nwithout prejudice. \n13 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 13 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\nA  0 \nv \n. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion for a declaratory order (Docket #26) \nis denied but the court establishes the informal discovery procedure set forth in this order at pages 9-\n10. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion to compel (Docket #38) is denied. \nM \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this  day of May, 2002. \n! \nI \nI  14 \nI \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/03/02   Page 14 of 15   Document 58\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\nt!!'tta \nw \n.. \n77(d) Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure, copies of this document were mailed by \nW.

Case No. 01-C-928 \nMILW  AUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, \nWILLIAM ANDREKOPOLOUS, \nWISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, \nELIZABETH BURMASTER, and \nMILWAUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS, \nDefendants. \nDECISION AND ORDER REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION \nThis is an action brought under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 1400 et seq.(\"IDEA'').  The thirteen above-named plaintiffs are bringing this action on their own \nbehalf and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons to compel the defendants to ensure the \nprovision of a free appropriate public education (\"F APE\") to children by complying with and \nenforcing the federal and state laws designed to protect children with disabilities. The plaintiffs have \nnow moved to certify the class. \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/23/03   Page 1 of 8   Document 159\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n1.1  I!  Jl.l.  I .I 11  If rtUJIJlLULlff  ill \n. . \nAlong with their brief in support of class certification, the plaintiffs filed a motion to file an \noversized brief. Given the complex nature of the case, the number ofp arties potentially involved and \nthe fact that there was no opposition to the oversized brief by the defendants, the court will grant the \nplaintiffs' motion to file an oversized brief. \nIn order to obtain class certification, the plaintiffs must satisfy the four threshold requirements \nofFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and establish that the action qualifies under one ofthe \nsubdivisions ofFederal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b). Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, \n163 (1974).  In this case, the plaintiffs allege that they satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a). \nRule 23(a) states: \nOne or more members ofa  class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf \nof all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, \n(2) there is a question oflaw or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses \nof the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and ( 4) \nthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  The plaintiffs also allege that they satisfy Rule 23(b)(2), which states: \nthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto the class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nThe plaintiffs' motion for class certification is challenged by both the Milwaukee defendants \nand the Wisconsin defendants, hereinafter referred to as the \"defendants.\"  The defendants challenge \nthe numerosity requirement, the commonality requirement and the typicality requirement of Rule \n23(a).  The defendants, however, have not challenged the adequately protect requirement.  The \ndefendants also challenge the plaintiffs' contention that they satisfied Rule 23(b )(2).  Additionally, \nthe defendants submit that the class certification should be denied because the representative class has \n-2-\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/23/03   Page 2 of 8   Document 159\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n0 \n. . \nfailed to exhaust its administrative remedies.  The court will address the exhaustion claim first and, \nif necessary, the court will address the requirements for class certification. \nI. Exhaustion \nThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs' motion for class certification should be denied \nbecause the class representatives have not exhausted their administrative remedies as required by 20 \nU.S.C. § 1415(1). The defendants argue thatthereliefthattheplaintiffs seek is available to them and \nall members ofthe class through the administrative procedures ofthe IDEA, as instituted by MPS and \nD PI. The defendants raised exhaustion as an affirmative defense in their answers, as well as a defense \nto the motion for class certification. (Milwaukee Defendants' Answer at 22, Wisconsin Defendants' \nAnswer at 14.) \nThe plaintiffs respond by contending that exhaustion is not a proper defense to the class \ncertification motion. Further, the plaintiffs argue that the problems they allege are systemic and could \nnot be solved through the administrative process.  Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that pursuing \nany administrative remedies would be futile and therefore, not required under the IDEA. \nEven though the court agrees with the plaintiffs that exhaustion is not a proper defense to their \nmotion for class certification, the defendants have raised an important threshold question.  The statute \nrequires the exhaustion of administrative remedies as a prerequisite to federal claim under the IDEA. \n20 U.S.C. § 1415(1).  However, the failure to exhaust under the IDEA does not deprive the court of \nsubject matter jurisdiction. Charlie F. v. BoardofEducationofSkokie SchoolDist., 98 F.3d989, 991 \n(7th Cir.  1996)(noting that lack of exhaustion does not deprive a court of jurisdiction because \nexhaustion is usually waivable). But, because exhaustion is a prerequisite to a federal IDEA claim, \nthe court must determine whether the plaintiffs need to exhaust their administrative remedies before \n-3-\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/23/03   Page 3 of 8   Document 159\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nr\nlli!IOIHil;iJ .U.i  - llli{!l!lllll- •:U.ntlilti  1111  H  Til  j  'iiili.IJI  toU!f  1  tiuntil' liiTUJJ f  1  !1!'111  .l.iiiRllll.  11'111]  011  _I]J \n1\nA  0 \n.  w \n. \nit can address the plaintiffs' class certification motion. \nA plaintiffm  ust exhaust his or her IDEA remedies before bringing a civil action ift he plaintiff \nis seeking relief that is also available under the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1).  The purpose of the \nexhaustion requirement is to allow the education professionals the first chance to remedy the system's \neducational shortfalls. Charlie F., 98 F.3d at 992.  However, plaintiffs do not need to exhaust their \nadministrative remedies when such exhaustion would be futile or inadequate. Honig v. Doe, 484 U:S. \n305, 327 (1988). \nThe  plaintiffs allege that the problems in the MPS are systemic and relief could not be \nachieved, one student at a time, through the administrative process.  \"[A] claim is 'systemic'· if it \nimplicates the integrity or reliability oft he IDEA dispute resolution procedures themselves orrequires \nrestructuring the education system itself in order to comply with the dictates of the Act; but that it is \nnot 'systemic' if it involves only a substantive claim having to do with limited components of a \nprogram, and if the administrative process is capable of correcting the problem.\" Doe v. Arizona \nDep't. of Ed., 111 F.3d 678, 681  (9th Cir. 1997).  Further, the plaintiffs allege that because the \nproblem is  systemic,  the exhaustion of IDEA remedies  would be futile.  Complaint at ,  58. \nNotwithstanding the plaintiffs'  allegations,  the  administrative  process  does not appear to  be \ncompletely inadequate. \nAs the court views the situation, there are two overriding areas of alleged failure into which \nthe various problems presented by the plaintiffs can be placed. The first area is where there is a failure \nin the process to get a student into services. Into this category, the court places the following alleged \nproblems: (1) evaluations and (2) procedural rights in the IEP process. In these cases, the child is not \nyet in services and the parents or guardians may not be aware of the child's procedural rights or how \n-4-\nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/23/03   Page 4 of 8   Document 159\n(Rev.B/82) \n\nn · \n.Jill ....  1 .. 1 J1JI .. L1LIIII.IL  .II \n• \n• \nto invoke those rights.  This sort of pre-determination failure can reasonably be categorized as a \nsystemic failure. \nThe other area is where there is a failure to provide certain services.  Into this category, the \ncourt places the following alleged problems: (1) IEP implementation and distribution; (2) transition \nservices; (3) placement, least restrictive environment and continuum of services; (4) disciplinary \nsuspensions withoutrequired interventions; (5) denial ofFA  PE due to non-attendance; and (6) lack \nofq ualified personnel. Although the plaintiffs also characterize the problems in this area as systemic, \nit appears that each individual child would have a remedy for the problem through the administrative \nprocess.  Here, it is instructive to note that the plaintiffs are not challenging the due process hearing \nsystem in Wisconsin.  Reply brief at 23 n.l3.  Once a student is in the system, a parent has the \nopportunity to raise issues that the parent feels are not being addressed.  Thus, for example, the fact \nthat a particular student is not getting services, or the services are not sufficient, is not a systemic \nproblem, but an individual problem, which the administrative process is capable of correcting.  If a \nparticular problem is not resolved, an administrative remedy should be pursued.  This was precisely \nthe case with Lamont A.  The court previously denied Lamont A.'s request to amend the complaint \nto  add his individual claim that MPS failed to provide him services pursuant to a settlement \nagreement.  The agreement was a result of Lamont A.'s use of the administrative system.  The court \ndenied his request to amend the complaint  on the basis that Lamont A. had failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies by seekingreliefto enforce the agreement before a Wisconsin hearing officer. \nThe plaintiffs submit that their investigation during discovery has uncovered numerous \nviolations within the six post-determination areas. The plaintiffs contend that the root cause oft hese \nproblems is a lack of accountability within the system.  Whether or not the plaintiffs' assessment is \n-5-\nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 05/23/03   Page 5 of 8   Document 159\n(Rev.B/82) \n\nH 1!11.1  11 ... 1.JIJ!flllllf1JPIIHI11  i  .... IIJ ...·   '' \naccurate, the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the structure of the system is such that individual \nstudents would be unable to obtain relief on a case by case basis. Obtaining a favorable federal court \norder is certainly one way to restore accountability to the system in one blow, but the court cannot opt \nfor judicial expediency by ignoring the legal requirements for the exercise of jurisdiction.  It is \nconceivable that requiring pursuit of individual relief by numerous parents would overwhelm the \nadministrative system.  Nonetheless, since the plaintiffs have not established that this is futile, such \naction is required. Parenthetically, it may be that full utilization ofthe administrative process by those \naggrieved will either restore the accountability to the system that plaintiffs contend it lacks, or clearly \ndemonstrate futility; i.e., that the system itself is not capable of correcting the problem. \nConsequently, the administrative remedies to these six post-determination problems must be \nexhausted before the court retains jurisdiction to address these claims. It appears from the pleadings \nand the briefs that the administrative remedies have not been exhausted by the plaintiffs to the post-\ndetermination claims. If, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1), the court does not have jurisdiction to hear \nclaims regarding the post-determination claims, such claims are not eligible for class certification. \nII.  Class Certification \nBecause the court has narrowed the scope of the plaintiffs' claims by excluding those that \nconcern the post-determination problems, the class definition must be amended to reflect the change. \nIn addition to amending the class definition, the plaintiffs must designate new class representatives, \nif necessary.  Consequently,  the  court will permit the plaintiffs to  submit an amended class \ncertification motion, in light of the modified class definition.  The plaintiffs shall submit their \namended class certification motion by no later than June 23, 2003. The defendants shall submit their \nresponse regarding the Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b) requirements by no later than July 14,2003.

Affidavit of Patricia Yahle \nThe defendants have moved to strike the affidavit of Patricia Y ahle because it contains \ninformation outside the scope of Yahle's personal knowledge and none of the exceptions to the \nhearsay rule apply. \nBecause the plaintiffs' claims have been narrowed and the relevance ofYahle's affidavit to \nthe amended class certification motion cannot be determined at this time, the defendants'motion to \nstrike the affidavit will be denied without prejudice.  If,  after submitting the  amended class \ncertification motion, the defendants still believe that the affidavit ofYa hle is not relevant and violative \nofithe Federal Rules of Evidence, they can resubmit their motion to strike Yahle's affidavit. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion to file an oversized brief is \ngranted. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs shall submit an amended class certification \nmotion by no later than June 23,2003.

On November 7, \n2002, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification so that they could proceed on their claims as \na class action.  On May 23, 2003, the court, in its Decision and Order Regarding Class Certification, \ndirected the plaintiffs to submit an amended class certification motion because the court determined \nthat a number of the plaintiffs' claims were subject to the exhaustion of administrative remedies, \npursuant to the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(1). \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 1 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nA \nv \nOn June 23, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their amended motion for class certification, which \nsought class certification based upon the claims as narrowed by the court's May 23, 2003 order.  On \nAugust 1, 2003, the plaintiffs were required to file a second amended motion for class certification \nbecause, in the court's opinion, both the plaintiffs and the defendants misconstrued the May 23, 2003, \ndecision and order.  On August 22, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their second amended motion for class \ncertification.  The motion is fully briefed and ready for resolution.  Additionally, the plaintiffs have \nmoved to strike the affidavit of Patricia Yahle, which was submitted in support of the Milwaukee \ndefendants' brief in opposition to the motion for class certification. \nIn order to obtain class certification, the plaintiffs must satisfy the four threshold requirements \nof Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and establish that the action qualifies under one of the \nsubdivisions of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b). Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacguelin, 417 U.S. 156, \n163 (1974).  Rule 23(a) states: \nOne or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf \nofallonly if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, \n(2) there is a question of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses \nofthe representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4 ) \nthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  The plaintiffs allege that they satisfy Rule 23(b)(2), which states: \nthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable \nto the class, thereby making appropriate final  injunctive relief or corresponding \ndeclaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nBefore the court can address the class certification requirements, there are still issues with the \nclass definition that must be addressed. \n2 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 2 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n•  • \nI' \n. \n\" \nI.  Class Definition \nIn the plaintiffs' original motion for class certification, they sought to certify a class that they \ndefined as: \n[the named plaintiffs] on behalf of themselves and a class of all school age Wisconsin \nresidents living within the boundaries of the Milwaukee Public School District or \notherwise eligible for education from the District who are or may be eligible for special \neducation  and  related  services  under  IDEA  and  Wisconsin  Law  due  to  their \ndisabilities. \nAfter considering the defendants' objections and the plaintiffs' response, this court determined that \nthis proposed class definition included claims, of which, the exhaustion of administrative remedies \nwould be required. The court thus concluded that some of the plaintiffs' claims were not systemic in \nnature, identifying these as \"post-determination\" claims.  The court  reasoned that were subject to \nadministrative exhaustion because they are individual and substantive in nature and each alleged \nwrong could be potentially remedied through the administrative process outlined in the IDEA.  The \ncourt identified the other claims as  \"pre-determination\" claims and concluded that these were \nsystemic or procedural in nature. As such, these claims had the potential for class certification.  The \nplaintiffs were required to file their amended motion for class certification based only upon the pre-\ndetermination claims. \nBut, when the plaintiffs filed their amended motion for class certification, they latched onto \nthe \"procedural\" language in the court's decision and redefined the class broadly so that it actually \ncontained the claims that the court determined were subject to the exhaustion requirement.  At the \nsame time, the defendants in their briefs in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for class certification, \nlatched onto the \"pre-determination\" language to view any class definition so narrowly as to define \n3 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 3 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\nI  I  l!!!!lt  i!l!JUH  1  \"JJJ  f  •ll  \nit out of existence.  Because the court felt that parties' proposed and opposing class definitions both \nmisconstrued the first order on class certification, the court formulated its own definition and directed \nthe plaintiffs to submit a second motion for class certification.  The court defined the putative class \nas: \nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee Public \nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed entry or \nparticipation in the processes which result in a meeting between the IEP team and the \nparents or guardians of the student \nNow, on the most recent attempt to certify the class, there is still as dispute between the parties \nas to. which alleged violations should be included in the class definition.  The plaintiffs have \ncharacterized the class, based upon the court's definition, to include students with claims involving \nsituations where the defendants have failed to evaluate when required, where the defendants have \nfruled to convene an IEP Team when required, or where the defendants have held an IEP Team \nmeeting without the required people, including the parents and/or child. Plaintiffs Brief at 23. Both \nthe Milwaukee and State defendants object to the plaintiffs' interpretation of the court's class \ndefinition.  The defendants argue that the language in the court's August, 1, 2003, order clearly \nindicates that the class definition only applies to situations where the student's parents or guardians \nhave not been to the initial IEP meeting.  Not so, argue the plaintiffs in response.  The plaintiffs \nsubmit that the court in its August 1, 2003, order explicitly rejected the notion that the class not \ninclude violations that arise out of, or occur after the initial IEP meeting. Reply Brief at 5-6. \nThis court believes that its August 1, 2003 order is sufficiently clear in its conclusion of what \nclass ofstudents may have been the victims of systemic violations.  Such students can include those \nwho are now in \"the system,\" but allegedly have been denied or delayed entry at an earlier time.  In \n4 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 4 of 15   Document 195\n(Rev.S/82) \n\n111  u-- Ill I  •  I ... 11.  I  iF I  LJ]JJI  :  a  11111•1   \nother words, the denial or delay of participation in the program must occur prior to the initial IEP \nmeeting. · But, to qualify as  a class representative, a plaintiff does not have to be at the pre-\ndetermination stage during the lawsuit.  It is enough that he or she was denied or delayed entry at an \nearlier time.  The court made this point clear when it stated that \"this court still believes that a group \nof claims exists that can be classified as systemic ... those students who suffer from deficiencies which \nhinder, unduly delay or prevent them from being initially served.\" August 1, 2003, Decision and Order \nat 4, emphasis added. \nIn using the phrase \"prevent them from being initially served,\" the court intended to encompass \nthose, students whose initial IEP meeting failed to serve its statutory purpose. One example is the \nsituati~m when the initial IEP meeting, even though conducted, was not properly constituted, such as \nwhen no parent or guardian of the student attended the meeting. In such a case, the parent or guardian \nmay 1;emain unaware of their IDEA rights and remedies despite the fact that an IEP meeting actually \ntook place. Another instance would be where the proper MPS officials were not involved in the IEP \nmeeting. This could occur if aMPS teacher decided to hold an IEP meeting without any other MPS \nofficials. .In situations like these, a potential class plaintiff would be able to proceed with this \"post \nIEP meeting'' claim if the plaintiff was able to demonstrate that the IEP meeting, as it was constituted, \nfailed ,to adequately provide notice of procedural rights. A failure to conduct a properly constituted \nI '  ~ \n' \nIEP meeting is the equivalent of a failure to even have a meeting. \nConversely, any of the plaintiffs' claims which arise out of facts or occurrences that originate \nafter the initial IEP meeting, are considered post-determination claims, not falling under the class \ndefinition. The class is to only include those students who were, are or will be delayed or denied entry \ninto the system and whose parents or guardians have not been informed of their procedural rights at \n5 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 5 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n! \n., \n~ \nthe initial IEP meeting. Despite the defendants' contentions, the court is concerned that even though \nthere are Child Find procedures in place, parents or guardians may not be adequately aware, or even \naware at all, of their remedies for the alleged failure of MPS to get their children into the system. \nHowever, once a parent has been informed by the Child Study team of their rights in regard to any \nproblem that arises, a remedy must first be sought through the statutorily established administrative \nprocess before it can be addressed in federal court. \nThe defendants also note that as soon as a child is identified as needing an evaluation or \nscreening and before the initial IEP meeting, the parents or guardians are sent information regarding \nthe students rights 1.mder Wisconsin and federal special education law. And, as a result, the defendants \nargue that the actual time for a claim to become a post-determination claim, is when the information \nregarging th~ students' rights is sent to the parents or guardians of the child. The court does not accept \nthe defendants' position that the post-determination period commences from the time that the school \nsyste]in sends the statement of rights to the parents.  Even though the parent may be sent some \ninformation regarding their rights, the court is not sanguine with the fact that this information is \nalways properly delivered or that the parents have a full understanding of the information. Under such \ncircumstances, the potential of having parties unwittingly forego their rights is too great. \nThe defendants also challenge the plaintiffs' class certification motion, claiming that  the \nplaintiffs will not succeed on the merits of their claims.  However, the court should not make its \ndecision regarding class certification based upon a belief that the claims will or will not succeed on \nthe merits; Szabo v. Bridgeport Machines, 249 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2001 ). This means that judges \nmust be willing to certify classes that have weak claims as well as those that have strong ones. Id. \nConsequently, the defendants' challenge to  the merits of the plaintiffs' claims will have to wait for \n6 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 6 of 15   Document 195\n(Rev.B/82) \n\n•  • \nproceedings on the merits, such as a  trial or a motion for summary judgment. \nTherefore, using the court's class definition, as discussed above, the court now turns to the \nrequirements for class certification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. \nII.  Class Certification Requirements \nThe plaintiffs have alleged that they have satisfied all of the Rule 23(a) requirements as well \nas Rule 23(b)(2) and therefore class certification is proper.  Neither the Milwaukee or Wisconsin \ndefendants  challenge the  Rule 23(a)(2) commonality or Rule 23(a)(4) adequate representation \nrequirements.  Nor  do  the  defendants  argue  that  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  establish  the \nmaintainability of their claims under Rule 23(b)(2).  Thus, the only class certification requirements \nin issue are the numerosity and typicality requirements.  However, to be thorough, the court will \naddress all of the Rule 23(a) requirements in tum and then address the Rule 23(b) requirement. \nA.  Numerosity \nRule 23(a)(1) requires that the class be so numerous that the joinder of all members of the class \nis impracticable. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(l)  Joinder has been found to be impracticable when there was \na class of· twenty-five. 7 A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure § \n1762 (2d ed. 1987 & Supp.2003). At the same time, joinder was found to be practicable with a class \nof three..,hundred-fifty. Id.  However, the Seventh Circuit has indicated that a class of at least forty is \nsufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement. Swanson v. American consumer Industries. Inc., 415 \nF. 3d 1326, 1333 n.9 (7th Cir. 1969). While the plaintiffs are not required to identify the exact number \nof members of the class, they cannot rest on mere allegations of the existence of a class. Marical v. \nCoronet Instruments!, Co., 880 F.2d 954, 957 (7th Cir. 1989). It is well established that a reasonable \nestimate will suffice, Peterson v. H& R Block Tax Services, Inc., 174 F.R.D. 78, 81 (N.D. Ill. 1997), \n7 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 7 of 15   Document 195\n(Rev.8/82) \n\nr \nG \nand that courts are entitled to make common sense assumptions in order to support a finding of \nnumerosity,, McCabe v .. Crawford & Co., 210 F.R.D. 631, 644 {N.D. lll. 2002). \nThe plaintiffs a1lege that they have satisfied the numerosity requirement because they have \nestablished that MPS has failed to evaluate when required, has failed to convene an IEP Team when \nrequired or has held an IEP Team meeting without the required people in approximately 20% of the \ntime, according to DPI monitoring.  The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' number includes post-\ndetermination claims and that from the information provided by the plaintiffs, it cannot be determined \nhow many students are in the pre-determination class.  Therefore, the defendants submit  that the \nplaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of establishing numerosity.  Additionally, the defendants \nargue that the plaintiffs have not presented any other evidence that would suggest that joinder would \nbe impracticable, such as a lack of geographic proximity. \nThe defendants are rightly concerned about the plaintiffs' numbers to support the satisfaction \nof the numerosity requirement, noting that they  include claims that the court considers post-\ndetermination. Because the number suggested by the plaintiffs (3200 class members) includes some \npost,.:determination claims and because the plaintiffs have not identified which of the 3200 class \nmembers were'students who were denied or delayed entry into the system, the 20% figure cannot be \naccepted as the guidepost in the court's determination.  However, the plaintiffs do note one statistic \nin their brief that is clearly applicable to the numerosity determination.  The plaintiffs note that DPI \nfound that 1. out of 259 students eligible failed to have any IEP at all. Plaintiffs' Brief at 27 n.13.  If \nthat ratio is applied to the 16,000 identified special education students in MPS, at least 62 students \nwould have gone without an IEP, well over the 40 plaintiffs found sufficient to make joinder \nimpracticable by the Seventh Circuit. Swanson 415 F.3d at 1333  n.9.  Nevertheless, a question still \n8 \nA072A  Case 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 8 of 15   Document 195\n(Rev.8/82) \n\n•  • \nremains as to whether or not these 62 class members actually exist.  But when the approximation of \n62 potential plaintiffs is considered in light of the fact that, in their declarations, the plaintiffs have \nidentified five non-namedstudents who are potential class members (Joseph D., Lassomer C., Tyrone \nD. AaronF. and Michael T.), the existence of at least 62 members of the class seems more likely. \nIn any event, it does not seem reasonable that all of the 3200 arguable potential class members should \nbe summarily disqualified from consideration as constituting only post-determination claims. As such, \nthe court finds that the plaintiffs have established that the class is so numerous as to make joinder \nimpracticable.  And therefore,  the plaintiffs do not need to  allege any other facts  that would \ndemonstrate that joinder would be impracticable. \nB.  Commonality \nRule 23(a)(2) requires that the plaintiffs prove that the questions of law or fact are common \nto the proposed class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).  A common nucleus of operative fact is enough to \nsatisfy the commonality requirement. Rosario v. Linvadits, 963 F.3d 1013, 1018 (7th Cir. 1992). \nHowever, some factual variation among the grievances will not defeat a class action. Id. at 1017. \nThe plaintiffs allege that this requirement is met because all of the plaintiffs' claims are based \nupon the defendants' failure to assure that children are not denied or delayed entry into the system. \nThe defendants do not argue that the issues of law or fact are uncommon to the class. \nThe denied or delayed entry into the special education system is the issue of law that will be \ncommon  to  all members  of the  class.  And the  defendants  do  not  argue  that it is  missing. \nConsequently, the plaintiffs have established the existence of common question of law. \nC.  Typicality \nRule 23(a)(3) requires that the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of \n9 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 9 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n•  • \n. \nthe claims or defenses of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3).  A claim is typical if it arises from the \nsame event or practice that gives rise to the claims of other class members and if the named plaintiffs' \nclaims are based upon the same legal theory as the other members' claims. De La Fuente v. Stokely-\nVan Camp, Inc., 713 F.2d 225, 232 (7th Cir. 1989). So, even if there are factual distinctions between \nthe claims of the named plaintiffs and the other class members, the typicality requirement can still be \nsatisfied. \nBefore the court addresses the issue of typicality, it reiterates that the only claims subject to \nthe motion for class certification are those that allege that a student was denied or delayed entry into \nthe system prior to a properly constituted  initial IEP meeting.  So, a named plaintiff's individual \nclaims must be typical of that definition. \nThe plaintiffs allege that they have demonstrated a pattern of practice by the defendants that \ndeny or delay the proposed class' entry or participation in IEP Team meetings. They further argue that \nthe claims of the named plaintiffs and the class arise from the same practice by the defendants i.e. the \nfailure to assure the evaluation and the placement into special education services of students under \nstate and federal special education law. \nThe defendants respond that each of the named plaintiffs had an initial IEP meeting or would \nhave otherwise received a statement of their rights, at which point the parents or guardians are aware \nof their procedural rights. Therefore, the defendants argue, that the named plaintiffs are not typical of \nthe class and as a result, the plaintiffs have not established the typicality requirement. \nSpecifically, the defendants note that even Jamie S., who the defendants concede would be the \nmost likely proposed plaintiff to represent the class, was provided with her statement of rights on \nMarch 21, 2001, and that she did not pursue her administrative remedies as outlined in the statement \n10 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 10 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n• \n0 \nof rights. Therefore, they argue, that J mnie S. is not typical of the class. In reply, the plaintiffs allege \nthat Jamie S.'s mother made therequest to be evaluated when Jamie S. was in kindergarten, during \nthe 1999-2000 school year, but she was not evaluated until the spring of 2001.  The defendants \ndisagree with Jamie S.'s mother's contention, noting that there is no written record of any 1999-2000 \nschoolyear request for evaluation.  The alleged lack of written evidence is not enough to persuade \nthe court that the assertion by Jamie S.'s mother lacks credibility.  The parties have raised an \nevidentiary matter which cannot be resolved on the record before the court. Absent any contradictory \ndirect evidence, the court will accept Jamie S.'s mother's statements as true for the purpose of \ndeciding the class certification motion. Thus, the court concludes that Jamie S. is typical of the class. \nThe defendants also argue that the other named plaintiffs (Lamont A., Aaron V ., Jim M., Tyler \nC., David P. and Maiysha Y.) are not typical because none of them allege that they were denied or \ndelayed entry into the system prior to the initial IEP meeting. \nBased upon the record before the court, the defendants are correct about all of the plaintiffs \nexcept forAaron V., who could possibly qualify as a class representative.  It is not clear from the \nplaintiffs' submissions whether the concerns about the IEP meeting that Aaron V. argues is improper \nwas hisinitial IEP meeting or if it is a subsequent one.  Declaration of Kim V. at 'l['l[ 2-4.  If the IEP \nmeeting referenced here is Aaron V.'s initial IEP meeting, he is also a proper class representative. \nHowever, none of the other named plaintiffs allege that they were denied or delayed entry into \nthe system prior to the initial IEP meeting.  Lamont A.'s IEP had been in effect when the alleged \nviolations occurred. Declaration of Maurice A. at 'I[ 3. Jim M. had been diagnosed at an early age with \nADD  and Asperger's Syndrome and had been eligible for  special education because of these \nimpairments. Declaration of Jim M. at 'I[ 2. In addition, the claims that Jim M. allege that are relevant \n11 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 11 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n• \nII \nI' \n:I \nI•I  \nhere occurred during an IEP meeting that occurred after his initial IPE meeting. Id. at <[19-11, Exhibit \nA at 4-5. Likewise, it is clear that Tyler C.'s claim that the IEPteam failed to find another school for \nhim occurred after an initial IEP team meeting. Declaration of Vickie S. at 13. And David P., who \nis deaf, has been a MPS  student most of his school years and has been placed by MPS in the \nWisconsin School for the Deaf and another specialty school in lllinois. Declaration of Doris T. at 11 \n2-5.  Obviously, an IEP must have been in place before David P. could be sent to a specialty schooL \nBut, David P. ''s claim arises out of the facts that surround his return placement into MPS after he could \nno longer attend the school in lllinois. Id.  Maiysha Y. was in special education since K5, her her \ncomplaint arises out of an alleged IEP violation that concerns her high school placement. Declaration \nof FloraY. at fl2-5. Based upon the above facts, these named plaintiffs are not typical of the class. \nBecause only Jamie S. and possibly Aaron V. are typical of the class, LaMont A., Jim M., \nTyler C.,, David P. and Maiysha Y. will be disqualified from representing the class.  Jamie S. will \nremain as a named plaintiff, as will Aaron V., unless or until it is demonstrated that Aaron V. is not \na proper class representative. \nD.  Adequate Representatives of the Class \nRule23(a)(4 ) requires that the plaintiffs establish that the class representative possess the same \ninterest· and  suffers  the  same  injury  as  the  class.  lJhl  v.  Thoroughbred  Technology  & \nTelecommunications, Inc., 309 F.3d 978, 985 (7th Cir. 2002).  This requires that the district court \nensure that there is no inconsistency between the named parties and the class that they represent. Id. \nAdditionally, the named plaintiffs be represented by competent counsel. Susman v. Lincoln American \nCorp., 561 F.2d 86, 90 (7th Cir.  1977). \n12 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 12 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.8/82) \n\n.. \n-n  • \n'I \n-A \nThe plaintiffs allege none of the plaintiffs have interests that would conflict with goals of the \nclass.  Additionally, the plaintiffs allege that they are represented by adequate counsel, who has \npreviously represented parties in civil rights actions in federal court, both in individual and class \nactions.  The defendants have not responded to the adequacy of representation requirement. \nAs noted above, the court has limited the named plaintiffs to only include Jamie S. and Aaron \nV.  And there is no evidence that their personal claims would conflict those of the class, which would \nmake them inadequate as the class representatives. Moreover, there is no indication that the plaintiffs' \ncounsel is inadequate.  Therefore, the court finds that the plaintiffs have satisfied the adequacy of \nrepresentation requirement. \nE.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nIn addition to establishing the requirements of Rule 23(a), the proposed class must establish \none of the Rule 23(b) requirements. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 163 (1974).  The \nplaintiffs believe thattheiractionismaintainable underFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Under Rule 23(b)(2), \na class action is maintainable if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds \ngenerally applicable to the class, thereby making final injunctive relief appropriate. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b) (2).  However a class action is not appropriate under Rule 23(b) (2) if the final relief sought is \nexclusively or predominately monetary damages.  Lemon  v.  International Union ·Of Operating \nEngineers, Local No. 139, AFL-CIO, 216 F.3d 577, 580 (7th Cir. 2000). \nThe plaintiffs argue that they have satisfied Rule 23(b)(2) because they have alleged that the \ndefendants have acted in a manner to the class that may be viewed as a pattern and practice and \ntherefore they have acted on grounds generally applicable to the entire class.  The defendants do not \nchallenge the plaintiffs' arguments regarding Rule 23(b)(2). \n13 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 13 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) \n\n'·  • LIH T  :11 U  I.  l!!i.tl!!lt!I!IIIID!HL£11  n •1   \nHere, the plaintiffs have not sought any monetary damages, other than their request to have the \ndefendants pay the plaintiffs' attorney's fees and costs. Complaint at pp. 22-23.  Additionally, the \nplaintiffs have alleged that the defendants have denied or delayed the entire class entry into the special \neducation system, noting the specific examples of Jamie S., Joseph D., Lasso mer C., Tyrone D., Aaron \nF. and Michael T.  As a result, the court finds that the plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 23(b)(2). \nIII.  Motion to Strike Yahle Affidavit \nThe plaintiffs move to strike the affidavit of Patricia Yahle, submitted in support of the \nMilwaukee defendants' brief in opposition to the motion for class certification, on the grounds that \nmost of the affidavit violates the rule against hearsay and that other evidence is not based upon \npersonal information as required by Fed. R. Evid. 602. The defendants acknowledged the evidentiary \nconcern and submitted a supplemental affidavit, in which Yahle indicates how she has personal \nknowledge of the information and that the records are kept in the course of regularly conducted \nbusiness activity.  The supplemental affidavit corrects the hearsay problem by establishing that the \nreports and records alluded to fall within the business records exception. Fed. R. Evid. 803(6).  The \nsupplemental affidavit also established that the assertions are based upon personal knowledge, \nsatisfying. Fed. R. Evid. 602 problem. Consequently, the plaintiffs' motion to strike the affidavit of \nPatricia Yahle will be denied. \nIII.  Conclusion \nBased upon the class definition established by the court in its August 1, 2003, order and as \nmodified above, any alleged violations that occur after a parent or guardian has attended a properly \nconstituted rEP meeting, are post-determination claims and are subject to the exhaustion requirement. \nThus, The only viable claims are those that allege that the defendants have denied or delayed a \n14 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 14 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.S/82) \n\n':111111111  '  I I •  I,U!II!!!  . r  I  J •~H _.Ji lL ,,  ::=  I \nIll·- I  I & \n. \n'  . \n• \n' \n' \nstudent's entry into the special education system before the parent or guardian is initially made aware \nof their child's procedural rights. Based upon the claims that fall under the class definition, the court \nhas determined that the plaintiffs have satisfied all of the Rule 23(a) requirements, as well as Rule \n23(b)(2).  However, because of a lack of typicality, of the named plaintiffs, only Jamie S.  and Aaron \nV. can remain as representative plaintiffs.  Consequently, the court certifies the class defined above, \nwith Jamie S.  and Aaron V. as the representative plaintiffs.  Additionally, the plaintiffs' motion to \nstrike the Y ahle affidavit will be denied. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion for class certification is granted \nin part.  The class is defined as follows: \nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee Public \nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed entry or \nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between \n, theiEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the caption shall be changed to reflect the fact that Jamie \nS. andAaron V. 3re the only class representatives and named plaintiffs. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs' motion to strike the affidavit of Patricia \nYa hle is denied. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the court shall conduct a conference on December 1, 2003 \nat 9:30 a.m., in Courtroom 254, United States Courthouse, to discuss all matters, such as further \nscheduling, post-certification discovery and notice to the class members. \n~ \nLf,..... \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this  f  day \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n15 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 11/14/03   Page 15 of 15   Document 195\nA072A \n(Rev.B/82) ",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\nJAMIE S., on behalf of the class,\nPlaintiffs,\nv. Case No. 01-C-928\nMILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, et. al.,\nDefendants.\nDECISION AND ORDER\nI.  CHRONOLOGY\nOn September 13, 2001, the plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging violations under the\nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq. (“IDEA”) and related state\nstatutes, Wis. Stat. §§ 115.758, et seq.  Upon the written consent of the parties to the exercise of\njurisdiction by the magistrate judge, the case was reassigned to this court on November 28, 2001.\nThe court then issued its scheduling order establishing a time frame for pretrial discovery and for\nfiling a motion seeking class certification.  On November 7, 2002, the plaintiffs filed their motion\nfor class certification seeking to proceed on their claims within the context of a class action.  The\ndefendants filed their opposition to the motion, and on May 23, 2003, the court, in its Decision and\nOrder Regarding Class Certification, directed the plaintiffs to submit an amended class certification\nmotion because the court determined that a number of the plaintiffs’ claims were subject to the\nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement, pursuant to the IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l).   As\n\nstated in that decision, this court determined that the plaintiffs’ proposed class definition included\nclaims for which exhaustion would be required.  The court concluded that some of the plaintiffs’\nclaims were not systemic in nature, identifying these as “post-determination” claims.  The court\nreasoned that these claims were subject to administrative exhaustion because they are individual and\nsubstantive  in  nature  and  each  alleged  wrong  could  be  potentially  remedied  through  the\nadministrative process outlined in the IDEA.  The court identified the other claims as  “pre-\ndetermination” claims and concluded that these could be systemic or procedural in nature.  As such,\nthese claims had the potential for class certification.   The plaintiffs were required to file an amended\nmotion for class certification limited to the pre-determination claims.\nOn June 23, 2003, the plaintiffs filed their amended motion for class certification, which\nsought class certification based upon the claims as narrowed by the court’s May 23, 2003 order.  On\nAugust 1, 2003, the court issued a second Decision and Order, which directed the plaintiffs to file\na second amended motion for class certification because, in the court’s opinion, both the plaintiffs\nand the defendants misconstrued the May 23, 2003, decision and order.   Ultimately, on November\n14,  2003, this court entered its third Decision and Order, and at that time, defined the class as\nfollows: \nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee Public\nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed entry or\nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between\nthe IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student.\nAt this point, a number of other motions were filed, including the defendant MPS’s motion\nto dismiss certain claims as not typical of the class and the plaintiffs’ motion to compel production\nof materials from the United States Department of Justice.  The court ruled on these motions and\n2\n\nthen met with the parties to discuss appropriate notice to the class, and a discovery schedule for\nexpert witnesses.  After notice to the class was given and expert discovery completed, the court\nrequested that the parties file a joint stipulated statement of facts, together with summaries of their\nrespective expert witnesses.   Based upon the submissions, and in an effort to avoid the time\nconsuming process involved in summary judgment motions,  the court decided to bifurcate trial\nproceedings, and first conduct a court trial for expert witnesses.  After some rescheduling, the court\ntrial involving expert witnesses (referred to as Phase I ) was commenced on October 18, 2005, and\ncompleted on November 2, 2005 (the trial did not run continuously during that period).  The court\nheard from six experts.\nOn November 28, 2005, the court held a hearing at which time the parties were advised of\nthe court’s initial reaction to the experts’ testimony and conclusions drawn therefrom.  The court\ninformed the parties that it would be necessary to proceed to Phase II, which would consist of the\nfactual presentations upon which the experts formed their respective opinions.   The trial to the court\nin Phase II began on April 10, 2006, and was concluded on April 26, 2006.  The testimony of 48\nwitnesses was presented, and numerous documents were received in evidence.  Post trial submissions\nwere filed by the parties in June, 2006.  The court is now in a position to render its decision.    \nII.  FACTUAL SUMMARY\n  In preparation for the trial in Phase I of this case, the parties submitted a joint stipulated\nstatement of facts. (Docket No. 267).  The document contains 257 stipulated facts.  In addition to\nthe stipulated facts, the parties also submitted statements of facts in dispute.  The agreed upon facts\npresent a thorough foundation for the litigation in this case.  The time line under consideration in this\nlitigation is the period from September, 2000 to June, 2005.  Following is a modified recitation of\n3\n\na portion of the statement of stipulated facts that are germane to the court’s decision.  Since not all\nfacts contained in the statement have been reproduced, the numbering that appears herein does not\ncorrespond with that found in the statement of the parties. This factual statement applies to the years\nunder consideration in this litigation.\n1.  All school districts in the State of Wisconsin, including Milwaukee Public Schools\n(“MPS”) are required annually to submit data to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction\n(“DPI”).  This includes data concerning students in special education.\n2. As part of its obligations regarding special education, MPS requires each individual school\nto develop a School Educational Plan (“SEP”) that outlines how each school will be working\ntowards increasing student achievement throughout the school year. The foundation of all school\nbased planning and decision making is guided by the SEP.  The SEP is developed at the building\nlevel by a team of individuals usually called the “Learning Team”.  The SEP is  developed to\nincorporate the district’s mission and teaching and learning targets which are aligned with state\nstandards into a working document to guide the day-to-day activities of each school. School-based\nadministrators are trained and offer in-service opportunities on the development of the SEP\nthroughout the school year.  The SEP is intended to be a roadmap and a working document for each\nschool to use during the school year to support its efforts in increasing student achievement.  The\nten sections of the SEP guide the school’s efforts in developing and implementing an effective\neducational plan.  The development of the plan is supported by the central administration through\nthe provision of workbooks, electronic support, and personal training seminars to ensure that schools\nhave the tools available to them to develop a meaningful plan aimed at boosting the achievement of\nall students.\n4\n\n3.  As part of its oversight responsibilities regarding special education, DPI monitors school\ndistricts for compliance with federal and state law.  DPI’s July 17, 2001 letter to MPS summarizing\nits 2000-2001 on-site monitoring findings observed that MPS needed an effective system of\nadministrative accountability at the school building level in order to resolve the compliance issues\nDPI had found through on-site monitoring and its other oversight activities.  The letter expressed\nDPI’s pleasure that MPS had agreed to develop and implement such a system by September 1, 2001.\nMPS did not develop and implement a system of administrative accountability at the school building\nlevel by September 1, 2001.\n4.  In October, 2001, DPI engaged a consultant, Dr. Lee Greenwald, to assist MPS in creating\na centralized system of specialized education accountability within the district’s decentralized service\ndelivery system. The plan was completed in April, 2002 and entitled, “Milwaukee Public Schools\nSpecial Education Oversight Action Plan.” The parties and witnesses in this case frequently refer to\nthe plan by its initials – “SOAP.”\n5.  DPI’s 2001-2002 on-site monitoring of MPS in May, 2002, revealed that MPS had not\ncorrected the implementation errors found in DPI’s 2000 on-site monitoring, and had not corrected\nthe implementation errors identified in the five Consolidated Corrective Action Plans (“CCAPs”)\ncreated in 2000 and 2001. CCAPs are corrective action plans centered around broadly-defined\nthemes of placement, non-attendance, discipline, speech and language, and individualized education\nprogram (“IEP”) services, identified in monitoring findings and IDEA complaint findings.\n6.  The IEP is a written statement for each child with a disability that is developed, reviewed\nand revised in accordance with the requirements of the IDEA.  20 U.S.C. § 1414(d).\n5\n\n7. During the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years, DPI focused its oversight activities\non assisting MPS to build the effective, centrally administered system of special education\nprocedural oversight and accountability mechanisms within MPS, and the mechanisms to be\nimplemented at each school building, that DPI had ordered in its June 18, 2002 monitoring report\nto MPS.\n8.  With minor modifications, Dr. Greenwald’s SOAP plan was adopted by the Milwaukee\nBoard of School Directors on June 27, 2002, with instructions to MPS administrators to implement\nSOAP as soon as possible.\n9.  One of the essential features of SOAP is the establishment of direct lines of authority and\naccountability in the district’s special education program. The Director of Special Services was\ncharged with the accountability for SOAP with the authority equal to the Director of Leadership\nServices who provides comparable directions, support, and oversight of the district’s general\neducation program. \n10.  SOAP makes each school principal accountable for the provision of special education\nservices and for the implementation of program improvements in his/her school.  Under SOAP, the\nbuilding-based oversight and evaluation of the delivery of special education services takes place\nthrough the SEP, which is developed each year by a school committee.  SOAP requires that the\nspecial education component of each school’s SEP be reviewed and approved by the Special\nEducation Supervisor and the Special Education Leadership Liaison (“SELL”) assigned to that\nschool.\n11.  According to MPS policy, all school administrators, teachers, psychologists, building\ncoordinators, SELLs, health professionals, counselors, pupil services central office staff, among\n6\n\nothers in MPS, are responsible for meeting the district’s Child Find obligations required by the IDEA\nand related state statutes. Child Find deals with the identification, location and evaluation of children\nwith suspected disabilities, who may be in need of special education.\n12. Ultimate oversight responsibilities for Child Find rest with the MPS Superintendent and\nthe  School  Board.  The  Chief  of  Pupil  Services  is  third  behind  the  School  Board  and  the\nSuperintendent in ensuring that MPS meets its Child Find obligations. A majority of the oversight\nduties regarding Child Find activities have been delegated to the Director of Special Education and\nthat office.\n13. Because Child Find is an important responsibility,  MPS assigned a specific SELL to\noversee district-wide Child Find activities, even though the responsibilities for referral and\nevaluation are with the schools.\n14. MPS publishes a Parent/Guardian Rights and Responsibilities Handbook which is\ndistributed to the parents and guardians of MPS students at the beginning of each school year, and\nis also provided to parents when their students enroll in the district during the school year.\n15.  MPS policy requires that when a parent requests a special education referral, the district\nmust evaluate the student, develop an IEP for eligible students, and send the student’s parents a\nnotice of educational placement, within 90 days of the receipt of the referral.\n16. MPS policy requires that any time a parent or other individual inquires, verbally or in\nwriting, about a referral for special education services or expresses concern regarding a possible\ndisability, the parent or individual must be provided with information about how to initiate a referral.\n17. MPS policy requires that when the district receives correspondence from any person\nrequesting an evaluation for a student and the correspondence does not state that the reason for the\n7\n\nevaluation is a suspected disability, or does not identify the request as a special education referral,\nthe district must determine if the correspondence is a special education referral. This policy is\ndocumented in MPS’s IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004.\n18.  MPS policy requires that, in order to make a determination within a reasonable time after\nreceipt of such correspondence, the district must inform the correspondent of their right to make a\nspecial education referral and how to make a written referral. This policy is documented in MPS’s\nIEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004.\n19.  MPS policy assigns responsibility for processing initial referrals for special education\nto the building coordinator at each school.\n20.  MPS policy requires that parents be provided with written notice of their procedural\nrights at the time they are notified that a referral has been received. This policy is documented in\nMPS’s IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004.\n21.  MPS policy requires that parents be given the opportunity to participate in the review\nof existing data on the child, and in identifying what additional data, if any, are needed to complete\nthe evaluation. This policy is documented in MPS’s IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised\nSeptember 2004.\n22.  MPS policy requires that IEP Team meetings include the following participants: one or\nmore of the student’s parents; at least one regular education teacher familiar with the student; at least\none special education teacher; a qualified, knowledgeable representative of the local educational\nagency (“LEA”) with authority to commit the district’s resources; and under some circumstances,\nother specified individuals. This policy is documented in MPS’s IEP Team Procedural Handbook,\nrevised September 2004. \n8\n\n23.  MPS policies restrict requests for extensions of time beyond 90 days to complete the IEP\nTeam process and determine placement to a specific set of reasons, require that the reasons be\ndocumented, require that the requests be approved by a supervisor, and limit the number of extension\nrequests to two per case. This policy is documented in MPS’s IEP Team Procedural Handbook,\nrevised September 2004.\n24.  MPS  disseminates  Child  Find  information  in  a  variety  of  ways  throughout  the\ncommunity. MPS sends information about special education forums that are held periodically\nthroughout the year to various community organizations. MPS sends a packet of Child Find\ninformation to clinics and doctor’s offices upon request. The packet is available in English, Spanish\nand Hmong languages. The packet includes a referral form, school and district contact information,\nand a booklet on the special education process, including a statement of parental rights. \n25.  MPS has a Parent Center located at its central office.  The Parent Center staff answer\ncalls and meet in-person with parents.  Their role is to direct parents to the proper resource with MPS\nto have their issues resolved.  The staff is trained in Child Find and other special education issues.\nThe school application that the staff assists the parents in completing asks whether a child has special\neducation needs.  If a parent requests a special education referral, it is MPS policy that the Parent\nCenter process that request.  \n26.  The 2004-2005 MPS district policy regarding disciplinary removal procedures requires\nMPS staff to consider, in situations where a student has been removed for more than ten days in a\nschool year, whether the child should be suspected of having a disability. Paragraph 8 of the policy\nprovides, \n9\n\n“if the student does not have an IEP and is not in the referral process but has been\nremoved more than 10 days, the student may be in need of consideration for a special\neducation or Section 504 evaluations. In such cases, the staff will need to consult\nwith the building coordinator or Special Services Supervisor/Administrator regarding\npossible “Child Find” obligations under IDEA and Section 504.”\n27. Weekly truancy reports are generated by school and central office administrators,\nincluding principals, vice principals, and special services administrators. Each school is required to\nhave a building Truancy Intervention Coordinator (i.e., social worker, psychologist, or another\nidentified person) who is responsible to monitor these weekly reports, contact and meet with the\nparents, work with regular education teachers, and encourage students to attend school.\n28.  MPS has numerous programs and policies that target at risk students in the general\neducation school population that may need special education or non-special education assistance in\norder to succeed at school.\n29. It is MPS policy that each school principal is responsible for implementing and\nmonitoring a dispute resolution process in their schools. Parents with a complaint may file an MPS\ncomplaint with their school principal. If a principal cannot resolve a complaint within five school\ndays of the receipt of the written or verbal complaint, immediate intervention is requested from a\nSELL. The SELL must resolve the matter within five days of the request for intervention and may\nconsult with the leadership specialist for that school, if necessary.\n30.  Under federal law, formal complaints can be filed with DPI.  When an IDEA complaint\nis received by DPI, it is forwarded to MPS and, in accordance with the procedures in place,  it is then\nsent to the appropriate school principal with directions to investigate and resolve the complaint.  If\nthe complaint is substantiated by DPI, the citywide program support teacher assists the school in\nimplementing the corrective action plan in a timely manner.  \n10\n\n31. The IDEA was re-authorized in the summer of 1997, before the beginning of the third\nyear of DPI’s new six-year on-site review schedule. Because of the numerous changes to special\neducation law, DPI’s six-year on-site review process was suspended and compliance review efforts\nwere refocused to assist Wisconsin school districts to understand and implement the new provisions\nof IDEA.\n32.  DPI found in the Spring of 1998 that 17% of MPS students with disabilities did not have\na current IEP in effect. In addition, the evaluation logs MPS submitted to DPI showed that only\n81.1% of evaluations during the 1997-98 school year had been timely completed.\n33.  Throughout the 1998-1999 school year, DPI required MPS to take corrective action with\nrespect to these issues, and required MPS to regularly provide DPI with data that reflected the extent\nof MPS’s compliance with the requirements to have current IEPs in effect and to timely complete\nstudent evaluations.\n34.  On June 1, 1999, DPI notified MPS that 7.4% of MPS students did not have current IEPs\nrecorded in the district database as of December 1, 1998, and that many of its evaluations were\nuntimely. As a result, DPI notified MPS that the district would not receive $604,206 of its IDEA\nfunds. DPI further informed MPS that it would approve the use of IDEA discretionary funds only\nto resolve outstanding compliance issues. DPI directed MPS to have a current IEP in effect for all\nchildren and to eliminate the evaluation backlog prior to the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year.\n35.  Also in June, 1999, DPI first consolidated its oversight of the corrective actions MPS\nhad been ordered to take in response to substantiated IDEA complaints from individual students on\nthe issue of timely evaluations. On June 28, 1999, DPI sent a letter to MPS, stating: “As you know,\nthe department has five open complaints against MPS regarding timely evaluations (94-044, 98-050,\n11\n\n98-059, 99-009, 99-014.) The department will consolidate its oversight of necessary corrective action\nin those complaints and close each of the complaints when MPS documents: (1) compliance with\nany child-specific directive(s) in the decision, and (2) compliance with the two relevant directives\nissued in Superintendent Bensons’ letter of June 1, 1999.”\n36.  Since June 1999, DPI has also continued to follow up on MPS’s duty to timely complete\nevaluations. In May 2000, DPI on-site monitoring revealed that 95.6% of MPS sampled evaluations\nwere completed timely. In July 2000, MPS evaluation logs submitted for DPI’s review showed that\n98.1% of evaluations initiated in January through March were completed timely.  Although DPI\ninformed MPS in July 2000 that the issue of timely evaluations was resolved, DPI has continued to\nrequire MPS to submit IEP team evaluation logs since the resolution of the issue. \n37.  DPI conducted its 1999-2000 on-site review of MPS by visiting three elementary\nschools, three middle schools and three high schools.  Ten student records were reviewed for each\nsite.  DPI reviewers evaluated the soundness of MPS’s self-assessment of its IDEA 1997 compliance,\nand also interviewed parents, regular education teachers, special education teachers, the building\nprincipal, and the special education supervisor for each site.  Implementation errors were found, and\nin October, 2000, DPI approved MPS’s CAP regarding the 1999-2000 on-site review.\n38. DPI conducted an on-site review during the 2000-2001 school year.  DPI’s July 17, 2001\nletter to MPS summarizing its on-site monitoring findings observed that MPS needed an effective\ncentralized system of administrative accountability that reached down to the school level in order\nto resolve the compliance issues DPI had found through on-site monitoring and its other oversight\nactivities. DPI stated that it was encouraged that MPS had agreed to develop and implement such\n12\n\na system by September 2001, and expressed its pleasure that the initial focus of the accountability\nsystem would be on the unresolved compliance issues DPI and MPS had been discussing.\n39.  One of DPI’s findings in its 2000-2001 monitoring report specifically related to an MPS\npolicy and procedure that could potentially delay the referral of a student suspected of being a child\nwith a disability. The district’s policies in effect at the time might have required district staff to take\nactions  when  making  a  referral  that  are  not  required  in  the  law  (i.e.,  a  reasonable  cause\ndetermination). These actions might delay a referral by a staff member or interfere with the duty to\nmake a referral. DPI instructed MPS that the district’s policies and procedures must make clear that\nthese actions may not delay the referral when the referring person reasonably believes the child is\na child with a disability. While MPS policies correctly explained the 90-day evaluation time limit\nrequirement following referrals from parents and others, it did not clarify that the requirement also\napplies to referrals from district staff. DPI therefore directed MPS to add a clarification that any\nlicensed school staff member who reasonably believes that a child has a disability is required to\nmake a special education referral. In addition, DPI directed MPS to add new policy language\nclarifying that any physician, nurse, psychologist, social worker, or administrator of a social agency\nwho reasonably believes that a child brought to him or her for services has a disability is required\nto refer the child for an evaluation. Moreover, DPI directed MPS to add policy language to clarify\nthat when persons other than the school district staff make a written referral to the district, the receipt\nof the written referral by any MPS staff person marks the beginning of the 90-day time line. MPS\ncomplied with DPI’s directives.\n40.  On October 2, 2000, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of\nrequired corrective action in four open complaints where MPS had been directed to take steps to\n13\n\nprovide children with a free and appropriate public education within a reasonable amount of time\nafter the district learns that a child with a disability is not attending school. DPI’s consolidated\noversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the “Non-Attendance\nConsolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).”\n41.  On October 11, 2000, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of\nrequired corrective action in five complaints where MPS was determined to have unlawfully failed\nto provide a free and appropriate public education by repeatedly suspending or excluding children\nwith disabilities.  DPI’s consolidated oversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by DPI and\nMPS as the “Discipline Consolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).”\n42. On August 10, 2001, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of\nrequired corrective action in three open complaints involving speech and language issues. DPI’s\nconsolidated oversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the “Speech\nand Language Consolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).”\n43.  On October 3, 2001, DPI issued a decision in IDEA Complaint No. 01-058, finding that\nMPS failed to provide services to a student consistent with the requirements of the student’s IEP.\n44. During the 2002-2003 school year, DPI focused its MPS oversight activities on building\nMPS compliance capacity through the implementation of SOAP and the development of the MPS\nInternal Audit Action Plan. During that same school year DPI did not conduct on-site monitoring\nactivities using the on-site monitoring model acknowledged by the United States Department of\nEducation Office of Special Education Programs (“OSEP”) in its 2000 monitoring of DPI’s\noversight. Where DPI found any compliance problems at this time, it ordered corrective action\n14\n\nthrough the mechanism of IDEA complaint decisions and directives, and their modifications to the\nCCAPs.\n45.  In the 2002-2003 school year, MPS used the IEP checklist system in 18 pilot schools.\nAt the completion of the pilot, MPS did not provide DPI with a report on the assessment or the\nresults.\n46.  In November 2003, the internal audit plan was renamed “MPS Continuous Improvement\nand Focused Monitoring Action Plan” (“MPS CIFM Action Plan”), and was revised to reflect the\ncompletion of activities during the 2002-2003 school year and to add additional activities for the\n2003-2004 school year. The format of the MPS CIFM Action Plan was also changed to specifically\nidentify whether an activity had been completed, and to specify the target dates for DPI’s verification\nof the efficacy of the required corrective activities.  A self-assessment pursuant to this plan was\nconducted in  each MPS school in  March, 2004.\n47.  Once the March, 2004 self-assessments of each school were completed, the Special\nEducation Supervisors and SELLs scored each of the 62 checklist items measured by the school as\nrequiring one of three levels for monitoring support.  Some schools were at different levels of\nsupport for different checklist items.  \n48.  Following receipt of their school data, the principals were required to develop a plan,\nincluding goals and actions, to remediate or address any of the 62 checklist or non-checklist items\nthat were measured below 95% compliance. Principals were not required to develop a remediation\nplan for compliance items assessed at 95% or higher compliance (“periodic review” level of\nsupport), even though the district goal is 100% compliance in all schools. This plan was incorporated\ninto the Special Education Section of each school’s overall SEP. The SELLs and the Special\n15\n\nEducation  Supervisors  conducted  follow-up  meetings  with  school  principals  and  SEP\nrepresentatives, as needed, for the purpose of amending or strengthening the special education\ncomponent of the SEP.\n49. The results of the overall assessment indicate compliance concerns including the\nfollowing findings. The following findings are not limited to the allegations in this lawsuit.\na.  Half of MPS schools (50.6%) merit ongoing oversight.\nb. 10.9% need intensive monitoring, including 25% of high schools and 28% of\nmiddle schools.\nc. 61.5% of MPS schools either merit intensive monitoring or ongoing oversight.\n50.  A September 2004 MPS CIFM Action Plan required MPS to evaluate the same specific\nchecklist and non-checklist items as were in the original September, 2002 internal audit system\naction plan.  This was to be done in the March, 2005 self-assessment.\n51.  In regard to data concerning untimely evaluations, MPS produced two reports.  The first\nreport covers referral dates from June 1, 2003 to July 8, 2004. The second report covers a time period\nfrom August 23, 1995 to June 30, 2003.\n52. The first report documents 114 IEP placement offer dates that were over the 90-day time\nline. Past-due days range between 1 and 267 days. 58 children had evaluations that were overdue\nbetween 1 and 20 days. 44 children had IEP evaluations that were completed between 21-60 days\npast due. 5 children had evaluations that were completed more than 90 days overdue. One child had\nan initial evaluation that was 267 days past due. No information is provided regarding the reason for\nthe delay in initial evaluation. The average number of days past due was 30 days.\n16\n\n53. The second report documents special education evaluations that are past the legally\nrequired 90 day time line for completion. This report is dated November 18, 2003, but covers an\nearlier period from August 23, 1995 through June 30, 2003.  This report indicates that there were 978\npast due initial evaluations from June, 2000 through June, 2003.  Overdue days range from 1 to 579.\nSixty eight children had their evaluations completed 100 or more days past due.  Two children had\ninitial evaluations that took 600 or more days to complete.  The average days past due is 37.\n DPI notified MPS that it had seven open complaints regarding MPS’s failure to provide\nservices consistent with the IEPs, and notified MPS that DPI was consolidating its oversight of the\nrequired corrective action in the seven open complaints. DPI’s consolidated oversight regarding this\nissue area came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the “IEP Consolidated Corrective Action Plan\n(CCAP).”\n54.  Nationally, DPI has received periodic guidance from OSEP about its special education\noversight activities. In 2003, OSEP moved from a Continuous Improvement Monitoring Process\n(“CIMP”) to the Continuous Improvement and Focused Monitoring System (“CIFMS”), and\nprovided technical assistance to states.\n55.  During the second semester of the 2003-2004 school year, DPI established a pilot\nstatewide CIFMS, in order to test new protocols in order to achieve positive results for children with\ndisabilities.\n56. The IDEA was reauthorized by the passage of H.R. 1350, the Individuals With\nDisabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, in December, 2004.\n17\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\nA.   CHILD FIND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE IDEA\nThe parties are not in disagreement over the applicable federal and state law.  Nevertheless,\nthe court will very briefly highlight the provisions which constitute the legal foundation in this case.\nIn order to be eligible for federal funding under the IDEA, each state must meet Child Find\nobligations, which the statute defines as follows:\nAll children with disabilities residing in the State . . . regardless of the\nseverity of their disabilities, and who are in need of special education and\nrelated services, are identified, located, and evaluated and a practical\nmethod is developed and implemented to determine which children with\ndisabilities are currently receiving needed special education and related\nservices. \n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A) (1997) (emphasis added).   As can be seen, the certified class implicates\nthe Child Find obligations of the IDEA.  The class, as stated earlier, is defined as, \nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee\nPublic School System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed\nentry or participation in the processes which result in a properly constituted\nmeeting between the IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student.\nThe ultimate obligations for ensuring that a state’s obligations, including Child Find, are met\nrests with the state education agency.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).  In the case of  Schaeffer v.\nWeast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005), the Supreme Court stated that “[s]tate educational authorities must\nidentify and evaluate disabled children.”  Id. at 53.  The state agency in this case is the defendant\nWisconsin Department of Public Instruction.  Regulations promulgated pursuant to the IDEA require\neach state agency to ensure that each local educational authority establishes and implements the\nobligations required under the IDEA.  34 C.F.R. § 300.530.  The local educational agency in this\ncase is the defendant Milwaukee Public Schools.  In order to effectuate the requirements of the\n18\n\nIDEA, state statutes have been enacted to see that these obligations are met.  For example, in regard\nto Child Find, MPS must identify, locate and evaluate “all children with disabilities who are in need\nof special education and related services, including such children who are not yet 3 years of age.”\nWis. Stat. § 115.77(1m)(a).  \nOnce a child with a disability who may be in need of special education has been located and\nidentified, that child is to be referred for an initial evaluation.  The task of locating and identifying\nthe child falls on a number of people, not only those associated with the school administration.  Here,\nthe child’s parents play an important role.  As acknowledged by the Supreme Court, “[p]arents and\nguardians play a significant role in the IEP process.  They must be informed about and consent to\nevaluations of their child under the Act. . . .Parents are included as members of the ‘IEP teams.’”\nSchaeffer, at 53. \nWhen a child has been referred for an evaluation, the law requires that an IEP team be\nappointed.  The team must consist of certain persons, which include the parent or guardian of the\nchild, one regular education teacher of the child, one special education teacher or provider and a\nknowledgeable representative of the LEA.  Other individuals with knowledge of the child can also\nbe members of the IEP.  Wis. Stat. § 115.78(1m).  Moreover, during the time period being\nconsidered in this case, Wisconsin law required that the child’s evaluation be completed, and an IEP\nplacement be offered, within 90 days after the date the school district received the referral.\nExtensions of the 90 days, under certain conditions, may be granted.  Wis. Stat. § 115.78(1m).  The\nIDEA and related state statutes now requires that the evaluation take place within 60 days.  20 U.S.C.\n§ 1414(a)(1)(C)(I) (effective July 1, 2005); Wis. Stat. § 115.78(3)(a) (2005-2006).\n19\n\nB. POSITIONS OF PARTIES - AN  OVERVIEW\nIt is the position of the plaintiffs that MPS has failed to meet its obligations under the IDEA,\nspecifically in regard to Child Find.  In particular, the plaintiffs have concentrated on the following\nareas: 1) the failure to refer children with a suspected disability in a timely manner; 2) the failure to\nreview all relevant data to determine the appropriate needs at the child’s initial evaluation; 3) the\npattern of improper extensions of mandated time lines; and 4) the use of suspensions during the pre-\nreferral process, which impede the child’s initial evaluation.  The plaintiffs contend that MPS,\nespecially during the period in question, systematically delayed and illegally denied special education\nservices for children.  \nIn regard to DPI, the plaintiffs cite the IDEA, which places the ultimate implementation and\nenforcement obligations on the state education agency.  Plaintiffs submit that DPI has failed its Child\nFind obligations in the Milwaukee public schools.  \nIn response, MPS first contends that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a systemic violation\nof the Child Find provisions of the IDEA.  MPS submits that any individual alleged violations were\nsusceptible to resolution through the administrative hearing process.  MPS also argues that its\npolicies and practices in regard to Child Find comply with the IDEA.  DPI acknowledges that the\nIDEA imposes certain obligations regarding Child Find on the state education agency.  It contends\nthat the various oversight procedures it instituted satisfied  its obligations under federal law.  DPI\nalso joins MPS in its position that the plaintiffs have failed to establish a systemic violation of the\nlaw.\n20\n\nC.  SYSTEMIC VIOLATIONS/EXHAUSTION REQUIREMENTS\nDuring the lengthy process eventually resulting in class certification, this court dealt with the\nissue of systemic violations vis-a-vis satisfying the exhaustion requirement of the law.  In its several\ndecisions, the court engaged in a discussion of the post-and pre-determination stages.  (See Decisions\nof May 23, 2003, August 1, 2003, and November 14, 2003.)  In particular, individual complaints\narising after the post determination stage, i.e. after the initial evaluation has been made,  are\nsusceptible to resolution through the administrative hearing process.  The court stated that no\nchallenge had been raised to the adequacy of the due process procedure itself. For example, if the\nparents had a complaint regarding the appropriateness of the education being provided to their child,\nprocedures for addressing their complaint are in place.  Therefore, the plaintiffs were unable to\npresent challenges of a systemic nature that warranted the creation of a class to address those\nproblems.  On the other hand, the court  found that the challenges focusing on the pre-determination\nstage did allege systemic violations, violations that were not amenable to individual exhaustion.\nThese were complaints for which the due process format did not provide an adequate remedy, and\nthey were basically in the area of Child Find.  As a result, the court ultimately defined and certified\nthe class as follows:\nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee Public\nSchool System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed entry or\nparticipation in the processes which result in a properly constituted meeting between\nthe IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student.\nThe defendants now claim that, upon a review of the evidence presented at trial, the court\nshould conclude that MPS has not systemically violated the Child Find provisions of the law.  First\nof all, MPS argues that a claim is not systemic if it deals with only a “limited component” of a\n21\n\nprogram.  Doe v. Arizona Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 682 (9th Cir. 1997).  MPS correctly states\nthat this court did refer to Doe v. Arizona in its initial decision of May 23, 2003, when discussing\na systemic violation.  This court stated, “[A] claim is ‘systemic’ if it implicates the integrity or\nreliability of the IDEA dispute resolution procedures themselves or requires restructuring the\neducation system itself in order to comply  with the dictates of the Act; but that it is not ‘systemic’\nif it involves only a substantive claim having to do with limited components of a program, and if the\nadministrative process is capable of correcting the problem.” (Decision of May 23, 2003 at 4\n(quoting Doe, 111 F.3d at 681)).  \nAddressing the court’s prior statement, the evidence presented at trial clearly established that\nChild Find functions more than as a limited component of the IDEA; it functions as one of the most\nimportant elements in the pre-determination stage.  If a child with a disability is not found, that child\nwill  not receive any special education.  This court thus declines to accept the defendant’s\ncharacterization of Child Find as merely a “limited component” of the program.\nNext, the evidence established that certain deficiencies existed in the MPS system itself that\nadversely affected its ability to fully implement the requirements of Child Find.  As argued by the\nplaintiffs, these deficiencies are structural in nature.  In other words, whether or not one agrees or\ndisagrees with the professional judgment exercised by an MPS professional in any individual case,\nand despite policies and procedures that look adequate on paper, during the period under challenge,\nMPS continually failed to comply with its Child Find obligations.   As will be discussed in greater\ndetail, the 90 day time limit to complete evaluations is illustrative of a systemic problem.  Exhibit\n336 sets forth the non-compliance figures on this issue.  The defendants contend that the percentages\nof non-compliance are small, approximately 3%, and arguably the violations are not pervasive.  To\n22\n\nthis court, 3% still represents a significant number of students, but more importantly, the exhibit\nshows that there was no substantial improvement over time.  Even if the defendants submit that this\nis a minor problem, something is wrong with a system that is unable to correct the problem, despite\nalleged improvements in procedures to foster compliance.  \n Returning to the MPS argument that the individual cases presented during Phase II of the\ntrial are precisely the type of cases that can be resolved through the administrative process,  as opined\nby one of the plaintiffs’ experts, Dr. Rogers Adkinson, these cases are simply illustrative of many\nmore.  This court is not faced with the factual situation discussed in the case of Hoffman v. East Troy\nCommunity School District, 38 F.Supp.2d 750 (E.D.Wis. 1999), wherein Judge Adelman addressed\nthe general policy of trying other interventions before making a special education referral.  In that\ncase, the judge agreed with the district that it did not have enough specific  information regarding\nthe student to suggest the need for an evaluation, so that there was “no reasonable cause to suspect\nthat Joseph was emotionally disturbed.”  Id. at 766.  As will be seen from the facts presented in the\ninstant class action, the warning signs in the representative cases discussed were far more severe and\noccurred over a greater duration of time, all of which belie continuation of any conservative other\ninterventions approach.\nThe cases presented in this litigation  reflect a system that has failed to adequately address\nits Child Find responsibilities; these situations do not defeat, but support the certification of a class\nin order to address and hopefully remedy the systemic Child Find problems at MPS. \nThe  court  will  subsequently  discuss  the  facts  and  expert  testimony  upon  which  its\nconclusions are based, but at this juncture, it is the opinion of the court that the plaintiffs have\nsatisfied their burden to establish a systemic problem with the MPS program. \n23\n\nD.  PHASE I CONCLUSIONS\nPhase I of the trial involved the presentation of expert witness testimony, limited to the\nmatters set forth in the respective expert’s report.  The subject matter of the experts’ reports were\nthe issues raised by the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.  As stated earlier, after the conclusion of the\ntestimony in Phase I, the court held a conference with the parties, advising them of the court’s initial\nreaction and conclusions from the testimony and exhibits received during Phase I.  Briefly, the\nparties were advised that the court found the conclusions reached by the plaintiffs’ experts more\npersuasive than those offered by the defendants’ experts.   The court indicated that the plaintiffs’\nexperts identified the following three categories of violations: 1) non-compliance with the 90 day\ntime limit for completing evaluations; 2) failure to identify, or untimely identification, of children\nwith disabilities who were in need of special education, including students who had been subjected\nto excessive periods of suspension; and 3) potential problems with record keeping.  \nThe trial in Phase II has been completed and the court has now had the opportunity to fully\nconsider the testimony of the experts, the testimonial and documentary facts from which the expert\nopinions were drawn, and  the post trial arguments and briefs of counsel.  Since the trial presentation\nwas bifurcated, the court believes that it makes sense to follow a similar format with this decision\nand first analyze and discuss the expert testimony.\nExperts regarding MPS liability\nThe plaintiffs presented the testimony of Dr. Diana Rogers Adkinson, an expert in the area\nof special education, with a particular expertise regarding programs for children with emotional\ndisorders. Dr. Rogers Adkinson reviewed records for two categories of children: children whose\nevaluations extended beyond the 90 day timeline required by federal law; and children experiencing\n24\n\nhigh rates of suspension, greater than 10 days.  Concentrating on the time period in question, Dr.\nRogers Adkinson requested 200 cumulative files of students involving extensions, but received 152.\nMPS was unable to locate 30 files.  For suspensions, she requested 90 cumulative files and received\nand reviewed 70.\nBefore discussing the testimony of Dr. Rogers Adkinson, it should be noted that, while  the\ndefendants disagree with Dr. Rogers Adkinson’s conclusions, they produced no evidence to rebut\nher findings of the records she reviewed.  In other words, the defendants did not offer the testimony\nof any expert who stated that he or she reviewed similar records, but reached contrary conclusions.\n The defendants argue that Dr. Rogers Adkinson only reviewed files; she never spoke to the children\ninvolved or their parents; and she never evaluated these children.  It is true that Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nconducted a records review, and from that review, concluded that certain patterns were evident.   The\ncourt is not persuaded by this challenge to the findings of Dr. Rogers Adkinson.  Much of this case\nis about record keeping.  In fact, a primary way in which the defendant DPI attempted to fulfill its\nduty under the IDEA was by reviewing records, records that were generated from the same type of\ncumulative files the plaintiff’s expert reviewed.  As such, there is no compelling reason not to accept\nthe findings of Dr. Rogers Adkinson concerning the records she reviewed.  \nThe defendants also urge the court to disregard the findings of Dr. Rogers Adkinson because\nshe failed to utilize any recognized scientific method in reaching her conclusions.  There is no\ndispute, not even from the plaintiffs, that Dr. Rogers Adkinson did not use a scientific methodology\nfor her analysis.  One of the primary tests for scientific research is that another expert would be able\nto replicate the results.  Dr. Rogers Adkinson used her professional judgment in reviewing the files\nselected and drew certain conclusions.  So, if another expert reviewed the same files and exercised\n25\n\nhis or her professional judgment, the conclusions drawn might be different.  As pointed out earlier,\nno expert on behalf of the defendants was called upon to engage in such an exercise.  Instead, the\ndefendants simply argue that the court should not consider the conclusions of Dr. Rogers Adkinson.\nDr. Rogers Adkinson engaged in what has been described as a qualitative analysis.  This is\na recognized methodology, but it has a different goal than a scientific analysis.  The goal of a\nqualitative analysis is to ascertain certain patterns or trends.  That is what Dr. Rogers Adkinson did.\nHer report and testimony sets forth the patterns she found from the files she reviewed, and she then\nprojected those patterns over the entire MPS district.  She testified that she believes that the same\ntrends would appear if a scientific or true random sampling of files had been conducted.  In fact, the\ntype of analysis conducted by Dr. Rogers Adkinson is not dissimilar from the analysis engaged in\nby DPI in monitoring MPS.  For example, Jack Frye-Osier, former assistant director of Special\nEducation for DPI testified that for the school years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002, records from a total\nof nine schools were reviewed.  MPS choose three of the schools and DPI chose six.  From this\nreview, DPI believed it obtained a representative district-wide sampling, upon which it could\ndetermine whether or not MPS was in compliance in certain areas.  Furthermore, the schools selected\nfor 2001-2002 were not the same as those selected for the prior school year.  And yet, upon this less\nthan scientific methodology, DPI was willing to reach certain conclusions regarding compliance by\nMPS with IDEA requirements.  \nThe court accepts the qualitative analysis methodology used by Dr. Rogers Adkinson. The\ncourt further accepts her Child Find trends or patterns and applies them system wide to MPS.   In\nparticular,  MPS failed to conduct initial evaluations within the required 90 day period and granted\nextensions more than once, often without a valid reason being placed in the file.  This failure was\n26\n\nlargely the result of not conducting evaluations during the summer months and often waiting until\nthe following October.  Even though MPS subsequently remedied this problem in the summer of\n2003, until that time, the practice of extending evaluations over the summer and beyond the 90 day\ntime period constituted a violation of the IDEA.  \nDr. Rogers Adkinson also found that MPS engaged in a pattern of suspending students as a\nway of coping with the discipline and behavioral problems of students.  However, as established by\nthe Phase II evidence, the more appropriate approach for many of these students who were later\nfound to be suffering from an emotional behavioral disorder, would have been a referral for an\nevaluation.  Here, it should be noted that Dr. Rogers Adkinson utilized more of a random sampling\nof MPS elementary and middle schools.  Phase II evidence established the factual reality of the\nsystem wide pattern of violations that Dr. Rogers Adkinson found from a review of the records. \nAs previously noted, MPS presented no expert witness to directly contradict or refute Dr.\nRogers Adkinson’s review of the records.  However, MPS did present two experts who attempted\nto soften the impact of the findings of Dr. Rogers Adkinson.  In regard to dealing with behavioral\nproblems, Dr. Eric Hartwig, who specializes in discipline and behavior concerns, testified.  Dr.\nHartwig visited two schools, one that utilized a “problem solving” approach, and the other that did\nnot.  It was Dr. Hartwig’s opinion that the best way to deal with a student who exhibits disciplinary\nor behavioral traits is the problem solving or intervention approach.  In this way, the school might\nbe able to avoid suspending the student.  Dr. Hartwig also testified that not all disciplinary problems\nwarrant special education referrals.  \nNo one disputes Dr. Hartwig’s last statement, but his testimony fails to advance the\nresolution of the issues in this litigation.  First of all, Dr. Hartwig limited his testimony to two\n27\n\nschools, but still attempted to project his findings to the whole of MPS.  Looking at two schools out\nof 160 is of no statistical significance.  He also limited his visits to one point in time, November-\nDecember, 2004.  More importantly, regardless of the merits of the problem solving approach, it\ndoes not obviate the school district’s obligation to locate children in need of special education.  The\nlaw requires the district to identify children with special education needs and then make a referral.\nWhen asked how long a particular child might be subject to the problem solving approach, Dr.\nHartwig said this was a qualitative determination.  In other words, it is not over until it is over.  In\nthe meantime, the referral may be unduly delayed.   In the opinion of the court, Dr. Hartwig’s\ntestimony failed to establish that the problem solving approach meets the district’s Child Find\nobligations.\nThe second expert called by MPS was Dr. Elise Frattura, a consultant who assisted the\ndistrict in moving from centralization to decentralization.  This is a process whereby the school itself,\nbecomes responsible for the services delivered.   According to Dr. Frattura, if the school becomes\nresponsible for the services it delivers, it will become more responsive and implement appropriate\nand effective changes in the area of special education.  Since the principal is in charge of his or her\nschool, the major burden on implementing the decentralization process fell on the principals.  This\nreorganization included an entire hierarchy of support staff and services.  The decentralization\nprocess began in the 2000-2001 school year.  In regard to the delivery of special education services,\nthe process was described in various plans, referred to by their acronyms.  For example, there was\nSEP (“School Education Plan”) and SOAP (“Special Education Oversight Plan”). \nDr. Frattura described the Child Find aspects of the process within the school and how the\n90 day period was monitored.  She also discussed Child Find when truancy problems are involved.\n28\n\nShe acknowledged that the most difficult thing to do is find a child eligible for special education\nwhen no referral has been made.  She indicated that since Child Find is a “proactive obligation,” a\n“broad  net” must be cast.  In her opinion, MPS was meeting federal and state Child Find standards.\n Unfortunately, the underlying refrain of Dr. Frattura’s testimony was that this is “a process.”\nIn other words, nothing happens immediately.  Dr. Frattura indicated that SOAP was a “good\nrecipe” to create change.  In the opinion of the court, while it may be a good recipe, the proof is in\nthe pudding, and the evidence from reports generated from MPS gathered data show that during the\nperiod in question, MPS was not in compliance in regard to its obligations under Child Find.  Even\nDr. Frattura was unable to adequately support her opinion regarding compliance.  For example, when\ncross examined about a statement in her report that IEP meetings are scheduled jointly with parents,\na legal requirement, Dr. Frattura admitted that there was no specific data to support this statement.\nOr, when presented with statistics that the suspension rate increased between 2002 and 2004, she\nsaid that each building must be concerned with this.\n  Basically, Dr. Frattura relies on the structure of the plan itself.  She says the plan strives\ntoward success, and success is improvement toward goals.  When asked to give a reasonable time\nframe for improvement, Dr. Frattura could not answer the question.  Now that the school is\nresponsible, she said it depends on the individual school and the particular problem. When pressed,\nshe opined that  it usually takes five to seven years for deep change, and at the time of her testimony,\nMPS was only in year four.   However, under the IDEA compliance obligations, “it depends” is not\na satisfactory response.  \nTo determine whether or not MPS was in compliance with the law, SOAP included a plan\nto assess the data, and this was jointly developed by MPS and DPI.  This was referred to as the\n29\n\nbuilding based assessment process which was initially used during the 2002-2003 school year.  It\ncontinued into the 2003-2004 year.  The process used a checklist to measure compliance and\ninvolved taking a point-in-time snapshot of the compliance of each school.  The plaintiffs presented\nthe testimony of Mark Mlawer, a consultant in special education, with an expertise in the area of\nmonitoring and compliance.  \nMr. Mlawer concentrated his attention on the MPS building based assessment process and\nconcluded that, in regard to the IDEA compliance issues raised in this litigation, the process was\ndeficient in many  respects.   He also concluded that there was no way to measure the accuracy of\nthe data used in the process.  For example, Mlawer testified that the only issue in this case measured\nby the building based assessment process is the 90 day evaluation timeline, and compliance is the\nonly aspect measured.  Parenthetically, this fits into the method of analysis conducted by Dr. Rogers\nAdkinson, since she was only able to select files which indicated that the 90 day timeline was\nexceeded.  Mr. Mlawer said that the assessment process did not monitor the IDEA requirement to\nidentify, locate and evaluate all students with disabilities.  \nRegardless of the accuracy of the data used by MPS, these are the numbers that DPI used in\nfulfilling its monitoring and compliance obligations.  Based on these numbers, DPI determined that\nMPS continued to experience compliance problems.  As discussed by DPI’s expert witnesses, in\nschool year 2003-2004, it was decided to establish and impose a different type of monitoring process\nfor MPS; this was known as the Continuous Improvement Focused Monitoring System (“CIFMS”).\nExperts regarding DPI liability\nThe plaintiffs called Dr. James Tucker to discuss the oversight responsibility of DPI.  Dr.\nTucker’s report and testimony focused on whether DPI had adequately fulfilled its role regarding\n30\n\noversight of MPS in the area of Child Find.  In a word, Dr. Tucker’s conclusion was “no.”  Dr.\nTucker testified that DPI had created a system that only dealt with reporting, but not one that would\nassure compliance.  Dr. Tucker explained that DPI would receive reports from MPS, determine non-\ncompliance, impose a corrective action plan for MPS to implement, but then fail to follow-up.  DPI\nwould order many corrective action plans, give deadlines, but if MPS failed to meet the deadline,\nDPI set another deadline.  Dr. Tucker stated that DPI failed to impose any sanctions on non-\ncompliance by MPS, sanctions which could include public reprimand or loss of funds.\nAccording to Dr. Tucker, DPI created a Child Find procedural checklist for MPS to follow,\nbut failed to have a method in place to determine if the checklist was correctly completed.  Further,\nthis was only a checklist, rather than a comprehensive screening, which is the only way in which to\nidentify and locate disabled children.  Based upon his analysis,  Dr. Tucker concluded that DPI does\nnot understand the nature of its oversight role and thus cannot fulfill it.\nDr. Tucker was especially critical of the building based assessment plan.  He stated that the\nbuilding-based assessment plan, as it was used by DPI, was ineffective particularly because different\nbuildings were evaluated each year and there was no year-to-year comparison of the same building.\nIncluded in Dr. Tucker’s report are several recommendations for improving DPI’s oversight\nresponsibilities.  One is to create a focused monitoring plan.  He said that this is the best way to\ncheck for compliance, because it is a plan that does not end with the collection of the data, but\nanalyzes it and establishes priorities and action plans. Also, that in creating priorities and action\nplans, input from a “stakeholders’ group” or advisory council is very important.  Interestingly, at the\ntime of his report, DPI was in the initial stages of developing its focused monitoring plan and had\njust established a stakeholders’ group.   \n31\n\nDirectly contrasting Dr. Tucker’s characterization of DPI’s oversight efforts as “all procedure\nand no substance,” was Dr. Judy Schrag, also an expert in the area of IDEA compliance.  She was\nengaged by the defendant DPI to review its systems, procedures and programs and render her opinion\nas to whether DPI was complying with its legal oversight responsibilities relating to the issues\npresented in this case.  As part of her analysis, she looked at MPS under the procedures of SOAP,\nbut she did not review any individual student record and offered no opinion as to whether any of the\nplaintiffs’ rights were violated.\nDr. Schrag stated that each state agency is required to have appropriate practices and\nprocedures in place to assure that the children in the state receive the benefits of FAPE, Child Find\nand §504.  She further stated that, to satisfy these responsibilities, the state system must be a\ncontinuous improvement system.  Dr. Schrag briefly reviewed the various monitoring systems\nestablished by the state agency since the 1997 IDEA.  From 1997-2003, there was the Continuous\nImprovement Monitoring Process (“CIMP”).  This was a self-assessment process which involved\na records review of a selected sampling, plus interviews with stakeholders.  During the 2003-2004\nschool year, the state agency replaced CIMP with the Continuous Improvement Focused Monitoring\nSystem (“CIFMS”).  This monitoring process focused on established priorities and involved more\ntargeted data review.  It also had broader stakeholder involvement.  In instituting both CIMP and\nCIFMS, the state agency took its cue from the federal agency, OSEP.  \nImmediately prior to the time period involved in this lawsuit, OSEP found that DPI’s\nmonitoring was in compliance, except for one area, investigating complaints regarding MPS within\nthe required 60 day period.  Dr. Schrag says that this deficiency was corrected by DPI.  Moving into\nthe time period covered by the lawsuit, DPI would review the data received from MPS,  and order\n32\n\nMPS to take corrective action in the areas of non-compliance.  For example, after its review in May\n2000, corrective action was ordered for certain items (exhibit 206).  The same occurred after the May\n2001 review (exhibit 208) and May, 2002 (exhibit 233).  These orders were known as corrective\naction plans, and then, in the spring of 2002,  DPI consolidated these corrective action orders\n(exhibits 277 and 278). Since  DPI had been issuing corrective action plans to MPS since 1997-1998,\nand there were still consolidated corrective action plans unresolved, DPI required SOAP on June 27,\n2002.\nIn the view of Dr. Schrag, SOAP was a significant factor in DPI’s monitoring.  The major\nfeatures of SOAP are detailed in her report (exhibit 11), and they include clearly defined lines of\nauthority, expanded staffing, annual self-assessment of each school, Child Find activities, and 95%\naccuracy.  As a result of the various increased monitoring procedures implemented by DPI, from the\ncorrective action plans, to the consolidated corrective action plans, to SOAP and finally, CIFMS, Dr.\nSchrag concluded that DPI was fully complying with its oversight responsibilities under the IDEA.\nDr. Schrag testified that DPI engaged in a series of increased sanctions in order to give MPS an\nopportunity to correct specific problems and come into compliance with the law.  Dr. Schrag\nconcluded that, as a result of its various efforts, DPI is now in full compliance with its monitoring\nand oversight duties.  She was unable to pinpoint an exact date as to when DPI’s full compliance\noccurred.\nOf course, even if full credence is given to Dr. Schrag’s analysis, there is a flip side. Under\nthe IDEA, the goal is 100% compliance.  According to SOAP, if 95% compliance is reached on a\nparticular issue, that issue need not be addressed in the school education plan.  So this means that\n5% of that area is not in compliance.  Under SOAP, if there was 80-94% compliance, the issue\n33\n\nrequired “ongoing oversight;”  “intensive monitoring” was required for under 70% compliance.  As\nto when MPS might enter the area of 95% across the board compliance, Dr. Schrag opined that it\nusually takes three years for a plan such as SOAP to work.  \n The monitoring by DPI and its corrective action plans and SOAP clearly establish that MPS\nwas not in compliance with the IDEA during the years in question.  Further,  despite the increased\nsanctions  imposed by DPI, MPS failed to correct these areas of non-compliance. In fact, the\nevidence discloses that DPI’s use of sanctions, and threat of more serious ones, failed to have the\ndesired effect.  In 1999, the State Superintendant of Public Instruction wrote to the superintendant\nof MPS that there were numerous children without IEPs in effect, and the withholding of state funds\nwas possible (exhibit 222).  No funds were withheld and, as seen above, various corrective action\nplans and SOAP were required, but as observed by Dr. Tucker, no deadlines were ever established.\nDr. Schrag stated that MPS has shown good faith in implementing a series of strategies, but she also\nhad to acknowledge that good faith does not always equal IDEA compliance.\nBased on the experts’ reports and their testimony, the court concludes that both MPS and DPI\nhave failed to comply with their respective obligations under the IDEA during the period from\nSeptember, 2000 to June, 2005.  In regard to its Child Find responsibilities, throughout the entire\ntime frame, the system in place at MPS was inadequate to satisfactorily locate and identify children\nwith special education needs, and, in particular, this was a result of how MPS handled students with\nemotional problems and suspended students.  Also, during a portion of the time, MPS failed to\nconduct initial IEPs within the required 90 day time frame.  Similarly, DPI failed to adequately\ncomply with its oversight responsibilities of MPS.  Based on the records it reviewed, it knew that\n34\n\nMPS was not in compliance in certain areas, but it failed to impose sanctions sufficient enough to\nbring MPS into prompt compliance.  \nThese are the court’s conclusions based on the testimony from the experts (Phase I).  The\nevidence presented at Phase II will now be addressed to see whether the facts upon which the\nexperts’ conclusions are based have been established.\nE.  PHASE II FACTS and CONCLUSIONS\n1.  Liability of MPS\nThe testimony elicited from the named plaintiffs present the reality underlying the foregoing\nconclusions of the experts.  The plaintiffs’ post-trial brief sets forth a concise summary of the real\nlife situations of the named plaintiffs.  In reviewing the testimony, the court believes that the\nplaintiffs’ summary  accurately captures the testimony received in court.  The response of MPS, in\nits post-trial brief, to the individual plaintiffs, does not take issue with the testimony presented, but\nrather contends that such testimony illustrates that these are the types of cases that should be handled\nunder the administrative process.  MPS further submits that the plaintiffs failed to link these\nindividual cases to the larger MPS student population and therefore, the court should decertify the\nclass.  DPI has adopted a response approach similar to MPS.   In its post-trial brief, DPI argues that\nthe plaintiffs only produced limited testimony establishing, at best, ten occasions involving just\nseven MPS schools, where MPS failed to initiate or accept a parents’ request for referral.  Therefore,\nDPI similarly contends that the evidence is insufficient to establish a systemic failure.\nSince the facts presented regarding the named plaintiffs are basically uncontested, the court\nwill simply summarize.  In reviewing the facts, it is important not to lose track of the ultimate\ninquiry, i.e. did the defendants systemically violate the IDEA, and, in particular, the Child Find\n35\n\nprovisions?  The testimony discloses two overarching aspects in Child Find.  The first is to identify\nthose children who may be eligible for special education.  According to the parties, the standard or\nguideline used by educators is whether there is a “reasonable belief” that special education “may be\nappropriate” for the child. (Stipulated Fact 39.)  A second aspect is that once this reasonable belief\nexists, how long does it take to make the initial determination that the child is eligible for special\neducation, i.e. the length of time from the request or referral to the IEP.\nRegarding the initial identification aspect, the plaintiffs presented testimony regarding certain\nchildren.  The plaintiffs first presented testimony regarding Melanie V.  Melanie was a good student\nuntil the fourth or fifth grade.  Her fourth grade report card characterized her as  “bright and capable”\nwith “clever ideas.”  In the fifth grade, she started missing school (42 days); she said she was not\nfeeling well, had difficulty sleeping, and was not herself.  Melanie attended the Milwaukee School\nof Languages for sixth grade in 2001-2002.  She failed  sixth grade and repeated in 2002-2003.  She\nfailed to improve during her repeat year.  The school implemented a homework plan and maintained\ncontact with her parents regarding Melanie’s progress.  The situation got worse, and Melanie wrote\nnotes about killing herself.  The school psychologist met with her parents and worked with Melanie\nregarding mental health concerns.  Nevertheless, Melanie’s mental health deteriorated and she started\nbeing sent to the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex.  She was sent there three times in the\nfirst semester of 2003.  In December, 2003, Melanie was found in possession of a razor blade, in\nviolation of the MPS weapon’s policy and was suspended for five days.  A hearing was conducted\nat the MPS central office, at which time the school principal stated that an alternative placement\nwould have to be found;  it was determined that Melanie should not return to her current school, the\nMilwaukee School of Languages.\n36\n\nUp until this time, no-one from MPS suggested that Melanie may be a child with a special\neducation need.  No referral for this purpose was made.  According to the testimony of the school\npsychologist, this was a mental health issue that required medical treatment. Even though Melanie\nwas receiving poor grades, the school psychologist did not feel a special education referral was\nwarranted.  She testified that the standard was a “reasonable suspicion” that a child qualifies.  At the\ncentral office hearing, the school principal recommended an assignment to another school, not a\nreferral for an evaluation.\n  Finally, in January, 2004, almost two years after Melanie started having problems, a request\nfor a special evaluation was  made by Melanie’s mother. This was after she made contact with the\nWisconsin Coalition for Advocacy.   Her mother testified that she had never heard of Child Find and\nbelieved that special education was only for children with learning and physical disabilities, not\nemotional disabilities.  An evaluation was completed and Melanie was found eligible for special\neducation.  Melanie continues to receive special education and related counseling services.  \nRyan O’s problems began in the sixth grade at the Lincoln School of the Arts during the\n2002-2003 school year.  He started having behavioral problems and was suspended frequently.  He\nwas privately hospitalized for mental health problems.  Ryan’s mother met with the school’s\nassistant principal to discuss her concerns, especially regarding her son’s suicidal thoughts. She was\nof the opinion that the assistant principal was not interested and so she went to the principal. No\nsuggestions were made. Ryan started the seventh grade at Lincoln School of the Arts but continued\nto have problems.  His mother made a school visit and then had Ryan transferred to Bell Middle\nSchool in February, 2004.  She advised the Bell assistant principal of Ryan’s problems.  Ryan’s\nmental health problems continued and his grades dropped dramatically, from the honor roll in the\n37\n\nfall of 2003 to failing grades in June, 2004. The principal at Bell testified that students who transfer\ninto the school are given an opportunity to improve, and she was advised that Ryan had good\nacademic skills. At the start of the 2004-2005 year,  Ryan’s behavior had not improved.  There was\nan incident on September 3, 2004, and he was suspended from school.  The principal did not suggest\na special education referral.\nRyan’s mother went to the MPS Parent Center, but a special education evaluation was not\nsuggested.  Finally, she met with a child advocate who suggested that she request a special education\nevaluation.  She made the request, Ryan was evaluated and found eligible for special education based\non an emotional behavior disorder.  According to the mother’s testimony, despite her involvement\nand numerous meetings with MPS, no one from MPS suggested special education.\nNathan L. moved to Milwaukee from Florida in June, 2001.  While attending school in\nFlorida, Nathan had been receiving services under a §504 (Rehabilitation Act) plan.  He was\nregistered at Fritsche Middle School.  His mother testified that at the time she registered Nathan, she\nadvised school authorities that her son had a §504 plan in Florida and was diagnosed with ADHD\nand OHI.  Nathan immediately started experiencing problems in school and he became very\ndisruptive. His mother met with his teachers and mentioned the prior §504 plan. Nathan was\neventually arrested for felony assault on a teacher.  He hit his teacher in the head with a planner, and\nat age 13, was handcuffed and taken into custody.  His mother then learned that no §504 plan had\nbeen put into effect; she was told that “they don’t transfer.” \nIn January 2002, Nathan’s mother requested a special education referral, and only then, did\nMPS request Nathan’s records from Florida.  An IEP meeting was held on May 9, 2002.\n38\n\nThe cognitive problems of Jamie S. began in kindergarten.  Her mother asked Jamie’s\nteacher in grade K-5 about certain problems in school and at home, but the response was to see what\ntranspired during the year. At age nine, she was unable to multi-task and needed help with hygiene\nand dressing.  She repeated first grade.  According to the testimony, her mother repeatedly requested\nthat Jamie be tested.  An IEP was finally held, but Jamie’s mother was not present.  Her mother says\nshe was working and not notified of the meeting.  Jamie was found to have a low IQ and to be\neligible for special education.  MPS states that it attempted to contact Jamie’s mother by phone calls\nand in writing on three occasions.  \nThe academic and truancy struggles for Bryan E. began in the fifth grade.  He was struggling\nwith reading and repeated the fifth grade at Clement Avenue School.  He then attended Bell Middle\nSchool in 1999-2000 for sixth grade, and despite the fact that his report card indicates “not\npromoted,” he proceeded on to seventh grade.  The same scenario occurred upon his “promotion”\nto eighth grade.  His eighth grade report card in 2002-2003, shows a final grade point average of\n0.821, but he was passed on to the ninth grade.  In other words, even though he was consistently not\nreceiving passing grades to qualify for a promotion, he was nevertheless passed along to the next\ngrade.  \nBryan’s problems included numerous absences from school. His mother would place him on\nthe bus, but he failed to attend school.   Also, he would do his homework, but would fail to turn it\nin.  His mother discussed her son’s  academic failures with the assistant principal, who suggested\nthat she meet with an MPS social worker.  Bryan’s mother did this, raising a concern of ADHD and\nasking what tests were available.  The social worker made no specific suggestions and no mention\nof a special education referral.  Then Bryan went to Marshall High School and, apparently because\n39\n\nof a name mix up, was mistakenly placed in a special education classroom.  Academically, Bryan\nstarted to do well.  Then, the mistake was recognized, Bryan was returned to the regular classroom,\nand his poor performance returned.  At this point, his parents went to the Parent Center for help and\nit was suggested that they request a special education referral.  Bryan’s mother then wrote a letter\nto the school principal requesting an IEP, but received no response.  A second letter also failed to\nobtain a response.  A third request was successful and an IEP was scheduled for February 26, 2004.\nDue to health problems, Bryan’s mother said she would be unable to attend, but requested that she\nbe provided alternate participation by telephone.  Her alternate attendance at the IEP was not\narranged, but Bryan was found eligible for special education.\nAs seen in Melanie’s situation, the issue of suspension has an effect on the timely\nidentification of children in need of special education.  It also had an effect on the timeliness of\nproviding services.  These were areas reviewed by Dr. Rogers Adkinson.  She requested 90\ncumulative files, but was only provided with 70.  Based on her study of those files, she concluded\nthat certain patterns of conduct emerged.  She found that the suspension rate was higher in the MPS\nschools than the state average, especially at the elementary school level.  Parenthetically, she only\nanalyzed elementary schools, because the MPS high school suspension rate was so much higher than\nthe state average that she did not believe a review was feasible.  \nIn her opinion, many of the suspension were the result of emotional behavioral problems,\nwhich can constitute a disorder eligible for special education if it impacts on the child’s ability to\nlearn.  Dr. Rogers Adkinson testified that she reviewed the files with an eye toward academic failure\ncorrelating to suspension, and whether, in her opinion, the child would qualify for special education.\nEven though this involves a subjective analysis, none of the defendants’ experts conducted a similar\n40\n\nreview of individual files.  According to Dr. Rogers Adkinson, suspensions not only delayed the\nidentification of children with a disability, but also delayed their referral for an evaluation.   The\nevidence introduced by way of exhibits 322 and 321 indicates that the suspension rate percentage\nincreased from the 2002-2003 to the 2003-2004 school years, and the district wide SEP for 2004-\n2005 indicates that these rates have gotten worse.\nThe foregoing students are representative of the class.  Testimony regarding other children\nwas presented, and the pattern was similar to that described above was presented.  For example,\nJyran J. had received mental health treatment. Jyran’s problems started at age 4, his twin sister had\nsimilar problems and was found eligible for special education, but Jyran’s  IEP was not held until\nage 13 in May, 2005.  This was despite the fact that when Jyran was suspended in 2003, the notice\nstated, “Jyran is totally uncooperative!  This has been going on for many weeks.  He has become a\ndanger to himself and others.  Jyran is not responding to any of our interventions.”  (Exhibit 320.)\nThese children, the named plaintiffs and the other children for whom the court received\nevidence,  exhibited  behavioral  and  academic  problems  in  school  and  often  had  diagnosed\npsychological conditions.   But referrals were not made in a timely manner.  What is interesting in\nthe response of the witnesses for MPS is that MPS did not argue these were children who “slipped\nthrough the cracks,” or that the plaintiffs selected the most severe examples, but rather the educators\nsteadfastly stuck by their decisions not to refer.  Witnesses spoke of use of other interventions before\nreferral, or attempting to avoid the stigma of the special education label. \nTurning to the responses of MPS, several approaches were presented.  First, MPS  established\nthat it disseminates a substantial amount of material in an attempt to alert parents to the special\neducation services it provides.  It distributes a Parent/Guardian Handbook to parents and guardians\n41\n\nat the beginning of each school year.  This handbook has a section that includes the MPS Child Find\ntelephone number if a parent suspects his or her child may have special education needs.  MPS sends\nChild Find information to community organizations, and to clinics and doctors’s offices upon\nrequest.  The MPS special education liaisons are responsible for outreach and training to private and\nparochial schools.  The MPS Parent Center is also a source of special education referrals and\ninformation.  \nEven though MPS tries to get the word out about its special education programs, it is still\nmissing too many children with needs.  It certainly missed the individual children about whom\ntestimony was taken at trial.  And, it missed the hundreds more found as a result of Dr. Rogers\nAdkinson’s record review.  The dissemination of information is obviously required to comply with\nthe IDEA, and it no doubt triggers a number of requests for referral.  However, under the law, the\nobligation of MPS goes beyond a self-identification process, which is all that the dissemination of\nthese materials does.  When the parent or guardian fails to request a referral, it is incumbent upon\nMPS to initiate the process when appropriate.\n   Notwithstanding the stipulated MPS policy that requires any licensed school staff member\nwho reasonably believes a child has a disability to make a special education referral, the evidence\nshows a delay in triggering the referral. Is that delay reasonable?   In response to many of the\nindividual situations, the testimony shows that MPS goes to great alternative lengths before it\nreaches the “reasonably believes” point that triggers the special education referral.  \nIllustrative of this point, is the testimony of Sandra Schroeder, who was assistant principal\nat Bell Middle School.  She testified regarding Ryan O.  In February, 2004, Schroeder met with\nRyan’s mother about having her son transfer to the sixth grade at Bell.  His mother said that Ryan\n42\n\nwas a good student, but picked on by his peers due to his gothic dress.  According to Schroeder,\ninitial problems with Ryan were new school adjustment issues.  Bell had a behavior modification\nworkroom where students who were acting out could be sent, and a variety of incidents resulted in\nRyan’s referral to the workroom.  In March, 2004, Ryan met with the school psychologist, and\nSchroeder testified that the school psychologist observed Ryan for the balance of that semester.\nSchroeder testified that Ryan was seen by the Collaborative Support Team, but the MPS records do\nnot substantiate this.   As far as Ryan’s grades, he entered with a 2.2 grade point average and ended\nthe semester with at 0.88 grade point average.  Ryan would also refuse to go to some classes and\nfailed to turn in homework.  Ryan also engaged in self-mutilation; after his dog was hit by a car, he\ncarved the dog’s name in his arm.  When asked whether or not Ryan should have been referred for\nspecial education, Schroeder emphatically said “no.”  She believed that the school had sufficient\ninterventions in place, such as a guidance counselor, a social worker, and an outside counselor to\nwork through the issues.  When cross-examined about Ryan’s behavior, Schroeder acknowledged\nthat she was concerned, but not alarmed.    \nSchroeder also encountered Bryan E. at Bell.  A number of truancy letters were sent and\nSchroeder had a number of conversations about the problem with his mother.  Bryan consistently had\npoor grades, often below 1.0 for a final grade point average.  Schroeder testified that this was not a\ncase for a special education referral because a student’s grades will not be good if he is absent from\nclass so often.\nTherefore, in regard to this first aspect of initially identifying a child who may be eligible for\nspecial education services, MPS contends that referral decisions are individual and subjective.  Since\nthe educators have been trained in dealing with these issues, persons like Sandra Schroeder should\n43\n\nbe accorded great deference.  Another important consideration that came into play in reaching the\n“when appropriate” guideline, was illustrated in the testimony of Lynn Boreson, who is a DPI\nconsultant for emotional behavioral disability (“EBD”).  Boreson had also been a special education\nteacher for 17 years, but not in MPS.  She has prepared an EBD worksheet for school staff to follow.\nFor the student exhibiting unusual behavior to be eligible for special education on the basis of EBD,\nthe IEP team must answer each of the four questions in the affirmative.  For example, the behavior\nmust significantly depart from the ethnic or cultural norm; it must be severe, chronic and frequent;\nit must occur at school and at least one other setting; and the student must display any of the\nbehaviors on an enumerated list.  \nThe consideration involved here, as indicated by Boreson, is to avoid “labeling” the child.\nIn other words, once the school staff proceeds to the EBD checklist, the process of stigmatizing the\nchild as an individual with a disability in need of special education begins.  Boreson testified that\nmany view special education in negative terms and this label may stay with the child for years.\nTherefore, Boreson testified that other interventions should be tried first, but she also acknowledged\nthat sometimes these alternates take too long and it is not reasonable to continue the child in regular\neducation.\nAlthough Boreson did not review the records of the plaintiffs, she was examined about their\nparticular situations in a hypothetical context.  Basically, she stated that she did not want to second\nguess any of the decisions since they are subjective, but she did acknowledge that the facts do\ndisclose reasonable suspicion for an earlier referral.  Boreson’s testimony clearly indicates that the\neducators responsible for making a referral are very reluctant to do so because of what they believe\nit will do to the child, i.e. place an adverse label on the child.  Thus, they will go to great lengths in\n44\n\nattempting alternate methods of intervention, and in doing so, will not suggest a special education\nreferral to the parent. As can be seen in the cases of the named plaintiffs, the extreme hesitancy of\neducators to pull the special education referral trigger, even if done in good faith, did a disservice\nto the educational and other needs of the child.  \nThe IDEA, of course, does not contain a “stigma exception.”  Further, a child can be referred,\nevaluated, and have a disability identified, all without changing the child’s academic situation.  It\nis only after the disability is identified, that the IEP process will determine what changes, if any,\nmajor or minor, will be needed in the child’s education plan.  Finally, the stigma argument is\nillogical, because a worse stigma is going to attach to a child who is not referred and ends up being\nconstantly disciplined, suspended, or too old for the grade he or she is in.  In retrospect, and in the\nopinion of the court, it would have been better to make the referral and go forward with the IEP,\nsince this only commences the process of determining whether or not there is a need for special\neducation.  Then, if the IEP team determines that alternative interventions are more appropriate in\nlieu of special education, if the parents disagree, there are sufficient due process administrative\nprocedures in place to challenge that decision.  To the contrary, as this litigation has clearly\nillustrated, when special education is not suggested, too often the parents default to the subjective\njudgment of the educators.\nThe second overarching aspect in Child Find, and one also reviewed by Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nwas the delay during the years under consideration in conducting the IEP after the referral or request\nhad been made.  The determination as to whether the child is eligible for special education is made\nat this initial team meeting.  Dr. Rogers Adkinson reviewed records in which the timing of the initial\nevaluation took longer than 90 days after the referral.  This covered the period from June 1, 2000 to\n45\n\nJune 30, 2005.   Exhibit 336 shows that for the period from June 1, 2000 to June 30, 2003, a total\nof 853 (9.9%) of all initial evaluations exceeded 90 days; for the period from July 1, 2003 to June\n30, 2005, the total was 778, which represents 8.4% of all referrals.  The exhibit also discloses that\nnumerous cases were marked closed, but the records fail to disclose the reasons for this action. Based\nupon her review of these records, Dr. Rogers Adkinson concluded that certain patterns emerged.  She\nidentified eight separate patterns of conduct engaged in by MPS in regard to these extensions of time.\nShe testified as to these patterns, a summary of which is attached to her expert report, (exhibit 8,\nappendix A).  They include extensions due to the fact that a referral was made between March and\nMay and no evaluations were conducted during the summer, and extensions in order to obtain\nmedical information.  The patterns also include a category in which the MPS file was too incomplete\nfor Dr. Rogers Adkinson to determine the reason for extension.  \nTo demonstrate the various patterns observed by Dr. Rogers Adkinson, she testifed during\nPhase I of her review of cumulative files for specific students.  Some of the files  on which Dr.\nRogers Adkinson offered testimony were of the named plaintiffs, but others were not.  The stated\npurpose of this testimony was to illustrate the typicality of the files she reviewed, the files that\nunderlie her conclusion regarding the systemic delay of IDEA services by MPS during the years in\nquestion.  \nBy way of example, she noted the file of Xavier, (exhibit 191).  The file shows that a special\neducation referral was requested by Xavier’s mother on November 5, 2002; the time within which\nto conduct the evaluation was extended until January 30, 2003; and the IEP was held April 29, 2003.\nThe file also shows that the parent refused to consent to any extension, and no authorization was\nobtained from DPI.  The only “justification” in the file for the extension is “additional testing and\n46\n\nobservation,” but Dr. Rogers Adkinson questions this reason because a language proficiency was\nconducted on December 2, 2002.  Special education services did not commence until September,\n2003.    \nAnother example was Joseph, a first grader who had an existing IEP for ADHD at West\nBend  and  transferred  to  MPS,  (exhibit  260).    After  transfering,  Joseph  experienced  many\nsuspensions, including one occasion when the police were called.  His mother requested a referral\nupon his transfer in July, 2002, but it was extended until October, 2002.  At that time, the IEP team\ndetermined that his problem was “environmental,” and did not qualify for special education.  Despite\nthe fact that  Dr. Rogers Adkinson opined that this child qualifies for special education, there was\nno reason for the delay in evaluation.  \nDesmond, (exhibit 255), received 16 suspensions in first grade and 28 in second grade.  In\naddition, he failed to complete his work at school.  Psychological testing was suggested, but no\nspecial education referral was generated.  Dr. Rogers Adkinson testified that examples like Desmond\nand others, as well as named plaintiff Melanie, students who exhibit extreme emotional behavior and\nare performing poorly academically, are subject to discipline and suspensions instead of being\npromptly referred for special education.  \nFinally, in regard to the adverse effect suspensions have on children who may qualify for\nspecial education is that, under the law, if a child has a suspected disability, the maximum\nsuspension that can be imposed is 10 days.  However, before a referral is made of a child suspected\nof having a disability, there is no such maximum.  So, for example, if Dr. Rogers Adkinson’s opinion\nregarding Desmond is correct, that he should have been referred for special education early on, the\n47\n\nexcessive period of suspension would not have occurred, unless he was determined not to be\ndisabled.    \nThe court finds that the plaintiffs have proven by a preponderance of the evidence that,\nduring the years in question, MPS violated the Child Find provisions of the IDEA.  The evidence\nestablishes that, system wide, MPS  failed to refer children with suspected disabilities in a timely\nfashion, improperly extended the initial evaluation of children with suspected disabilities, and\ninappropriately used suspensions in a manner that adversely affected both the identification and\nevaluation of children with suspected disabilities.  The plaintiffs have also claimed that MPS\nviolated the Child Find provisions of the law by failing to review all data to determine the\nappropriate needs within the child’s initial evaluation of a suspected disability, and by not having\nparents or all appropriate persons at the initial IEP.  \nThe court previously discussed the defendants’ challenge to finding systemic violations in\nregard to their arguments that this case is dealing with just limited components of the IDEA and that\nthe plaintiffs have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.  As this court stated at the time\nit certified the class, \n[A] claim is ‘systemic’ if it implicates the integrity or reliability of the IDEA\ndispute  resolution  procedures  themselves,  or  requires  restructuring  the\neducation system itself in order to comply with the dictates of the Act.\nDoe, 111 F.3d at  682.  At this point, the court will address the defendants’ arguments that the\nplaintiffs have presented only individual cases and have failed to establish that these situations are\nexamples of system wide problems.\nFirst of all, the actions of the defendant DPI lend support to the conclusion that the Child\nFind problems at MPS were in need of restructuring.  These problems have been the subject of\n48\n\ncontinual monitoring by DPI during the years in question and resulted in a forced remaking of the\nspecial education system at MPS in order to comply with the requirements of the IDEA, in more\nareas than just Child Find.  DPI began issuing corrective action plans (“CAPs”) which turned into\nconsolidated corrective action plans (“CCAPs”).  DPI altered its monitoring of MPS in an attempt\nto bring the district into compliance.  Finally, at the beginning of the 2002-2003 school year, DPI\nrequired MPS to establish a Special Education Oversight Action Plan (“SOAP”).  This was followed\nby the CIFM Action Plan.  Notwithstanding these multiple corrective actions, Child Find violations\ncontinued to occur at MPS, even at the end of the period under scrutiny in this litigation.  As noted\nearlier, even MPS’s expert Dr. Elise Frattura opined that it may take five to seven years following\nthe latest corrective action for MPS to come into compliance in regard to Child Find.  Based on this\nhistory, it would simply be counterintuitive to view DPI’s continual oversight as merely attempts to\nrequire MPS to correct sporadic individual complaints.  If that were the case, it would be akin to\nusing a shotgun to kill a fly.  MPS was in need of system wide restructuring, DPI knew this and\ntherefore required it.  What has been presented in this litigation is evidence of systemic violations.\nTurning to the discrete areas of challenge raised by the plaintiffs, finding a systemic violation\nin regard to failing to conduct IEPs within the required 90 days is not difficult. The evidence\nestablishes that MPS failed to conduct IEPs over the summer months, and as a result, improperly\nextended the 90 day period. Until this particular problem was corrected by having IEP teams\navailable during the summer, this was obviously a district wide practice.  In other words, no\nevaluations during the summer means just that, i.e. none were performed.  Therefore, in those cases\nin which the referral was made during the spring, waiting until the following October to conduct the\nIEP violated the IDEA.  The fact that this problem has now been corrected is something that can be\n49\n\nconsidered when discussing appropriate remedies, but the eventual corrective action does not nullify\nthe violation.\nIn regard to other reasons for delay, as noted above in exhibit 336, MPS records disclose that\nfrom June 1, 2000 to June 30, 2005, hundreds of referrals were not evaluated within the 90 day\nperiod.  Adequate reasons to support the extensions are not found in the records.  Referrals were\nclosed without explanation.  The evidence presented is more than sufficient to support the conclusion\nthat MPS systemically violated the 90 day requirement.\nDuring Phase II, plaintiffs presented evidence concerning individual situations in which the\nreferral should have been made at an earlier point in time.  In Phase I, Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nconcluded from her review of over 200 files that this failure to refer was a system wide problem.\nIn addition to the testimony offered during Phase II, she testified about other particular students.\nAgain, while it was only her subjective analysis that a referral should have been made sooner, her\nopinion based on a review of MPS files was not contradicted.  Hers was a qualitative analysis to\nascertain certain trends.  However, these were not trends that were limited simply to the files being\nreviewed; they are trends that Dr. Rogers Adkinson opines should be projected over the entire\ndistrict.  \nBased on the totality of the evidence presented, which includes testimony regarding the\nindividual  situations,  the  experts’  opinions,  together  with  the  fact  that  DPI  found  MPS  in\nnoncompliance with Child Find issues, this court concludes that the plaintiffs have established\nsystemic violations during the years in question.  As discussed earlier, one reason for the delay in\nreferral was that MPS preferred to utilize alternate intervention methods.  These pre-referral\ninterventions, while well-intended, do not excuse the Child Find violations.  The evidence\n50\n\nestablishes that alternate intervention was always MPS’s preferred choice, when in fact,  a referral\nfor special education was the more appropriate route to choose.  \nThe court’s conclusion regarding failure to refer on a timely basis applies equally to the\nimproper use of suspensions.  Although suspensions were not the subject of any noncompliance\norders from DPI, here the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, including from Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nprovides a sufficient basis for projection system wide.  The evidence presented indicates that the\nsuspension rates at MPS were not only greater than the state average, but were increasing during\nsome of the school years in question.  The comparison between school years 2002-2003 (exhibit 322)\nand 2003-2004 (exhibit 321) shows an increase.  Suspensions alone do not qualify a child for special\neducation, but such disciplinary action is indicative of a child with a disability, when combined with\nthe other signs exhibited by the child pointing to that same conclusion.  Each of the representative\nplaintiffs in the class exhibited, not just one, but many warning signs pointing to the need for a\nreferral for an evaluation.\nTurning to the plaintiffs’ claim regarding the failure of MPS to review all data to determine\na child’s appropriate needs at the initial evaluation, the proof presented to establish that this is a\nsystemic violation is not as persuasive as that regarding other claims. First of all, Dr. Rogers\nAdkinson discussed this issue in regard to one of her several categories of improper reasons for\nextension from the referral to the IEP.  Here, she provided specific examples wherein she contended\nthat MPS ignored existing data of an emotional disorder and extended the time in order to seek\nevidence for a referral under a different disability.  Although her analysis is supportive of ways in\nwhich MPS misused extensions, that conclusion does not establish a systemic failure to consider all\ndata to determine a child’s appropriate needs for an initial evaluation.  \n51\n\n  In each of the examples in this category, she reviewed the child’s cumulative file and\ndisagreed with the way in which MPS discerned the child’s disability.  By way of illustration, she\ntestified regarding Marquita, (exhibit 256), who was qualified as OHI, but Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nsaid she should have qualified under EBD; she said that based on the nature of the child’s problems,\nEBD was the appropriate diagnosis.  Primarily, she used  this file as an example of  improper use of\nseveral extensions, but the plaintiffs now seek to expand its significance.  For Dr. Rogers Adkinson\nto make a diagnosis of a specific disability on a paper record, without seeing the child, is troubling\nto this court.  This is not the same as reviewing the paper record and concluding that MPS should\nhave suspected such a disability earlier and made a referral, as in the case of Tennessee, (exhibit\n257), a child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression, had behavior problems at\nschool, was suspended, changed schools five times, but was never referred for an IEP.  This claim\nappears more related to the exercise of individual professional judgment in each case, and not a\nviolation that is inherent in the system.  The plaintiffs on this issue have failed to persuade the court\nthat the specific failure to consider all of the available data in attempting to ascertain whether the\nchild has a disability, or the nature of same, is a systemic problem.\nThe evidence presented at Phase II demonstrated that there were other problems in regard to\nChild Find, such as not having the parent at the IEP.  The law requires that parents are to be involved\nin the initial evaluation process and the IEP should be scheduled at a time that is mutually convenient\nto educators and parents.  Wis. Stat. § 115.78.  The plaintiffs presented evidence that this was not\nalways done.  Without going into detail, the plaintiffs presented testimony from certain parents that\nthey were not in attendance at the IEP.  The argument is that MPS failed to make adequate attempts\n52\n\nto secure the presence of these parents.  In response, MPS offered testimony to demonstrate the\nefforts made in an attempt to secure the presence of the parent or parents. \nIn order to get a better grasp on whether or not MPS was complying with certain Child Find\nrequirements, both a checklist and non-checklist of items was established.  Checklist items #1, #2\nand #4 pertain to parent participation in the evaluation process. ( See exhibit 195 (2003-2004\nreport)).   The results vary.  For example, for the school year 2003-2004, for checklist item #1, which\nis whether the child’s parents are provided with a notice of the evaluation, the district wide average\nwas 87.8%.  Exhibit 353 is a comparison between school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 for district\nwide compliance with Child Find checklist items.  This exhibit shows that the district wide average\nfor checklist item #1 for 2004-2005 was 87.7%.  On the other hand, checklist item #4 covers whether\nthe child’s parents attended the meeting to determine whether their child is, or continues to be, a\nchild with a disability.  This item includes whether attempts were made to find a mutually agreeable\ntime for the meeting.  The compliance rate for 2003-2004 is 95.2% and for 2004- 2005 is 95.5%. \nChecklist item #2 covers whether the child’s parents were contacted and afforded an\nopportunity to participate in the review of existing evaluation data.  For 2003-2004, the compliance\nrate was 92% and for the following year, 89.9%.  What should be made of these statistics is the\nquestion asked by the court.  Of significance in answering that question is the fact that the creation\nof the checklist was a result of DPI’s continued efforts to bring MPS into compliance in these areas.\nIt was in 2002, when DPI recognized that its many corrective action plans were not accomplishing\ntheir goal that it felt sufficiently motivated to require a system of internal accountability.  MPS was\nunable to translate corrective action plans into compliance and apparently, in some areas, the more\nrigorous  accountability plan was able to move MPS toward better compliance.\n53\n\nThe fact that MPS has improved its compliance rate in some of these Child Find areas does\nnot alter this court’s conclusion that the violations of the IDEA are nevertheless systemic in nature.\nThe testimony and the data lead this court to only one conclusion, which is that the inability of MPS\nto reach full compliance with the law in the area of Child Find is not the result of numerous isolated\nand unrelated cases, but stems from systemic inadequacies. \n2.  Liability of DPI\nPlaintiffs’ experts, and in particular, Dr. Tucker testified that the actions of DPI to fulfill its\nobligation to assure compliance with the IDEA were all procedural, but lacked substance.  In other\nwords, DPI engaged in substantial efforts to obtain reports from MPS, but not compliance.  As just\ndiscussed, the court has concluded that MPS failed to comply with the law in regard to Child Find.\nLike MPS, DPI also contends that the plaintiffs have failed to establish any systemic violations, and\nthat they should not be excused from the law’s exhaustion requirement.  Since DPI  does not raise\nany new arguments on these points, it is not necessary for the court to reiterate what it has previously\nstated in rejecting the defendants’ positions. \n Instead, the court will address the issue of whether DPI is also liable for the failures to\ncomply with the IDEA.  Here, the court recognizes that the state agency is in a difficult position since\nit has the overall duty to ensure IDEA compliance.  The state is responsible for success, but in this\ncase, the Child Find efforts of MPS were not successful, in that they failed to comply with the law.\nOf course, DPI knew MPS was not in compliance, and attempted to bring about a change by issuing\ncontinual procedural requirements.  DPI argues that its constant oversight satisfied its obligations\nunder the law.   Unfortunately, a similar argument, that a state’s duty is satisfied by general oversight\nand supervision, was rejected in the case of Corey H. v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago,\n54\n\n995 F. Supp. 900 (N.D. Ill. 1998).  As with MPS, this court is not saying that DPI did not act in good\nfaith and did not try, but it efforts were not able to bring about the required compliance.\nThe evidence, as it is relevant to this case, details the efforts of DPI to bring about\ncompliance starting in 1999.  In June, 1999, the State superintendent wrote a letter to the MPS\nsuperintendent raising serious concerns regarding the district’s failure to ensure timely IEP\nevaluations.  The letter states, in part, “The second compliance issue of major concern is MPS’s\nfailure over a four- and- one-half year period to ensure timely evaluation of children with suspected\nor known disabilities  . . . Data submitted by MPS continue to demonstrate a significant number of\nchildren are not evaluated in a timely manner.” (Exhibit 222.)   In an effort to obtain a change in\ndirection, DPI insisted upon specific corrective actions and cautioned MPS that DPI might withhold\n$1.84 million in IDEA discretionary funds, or would permit use of such funds only for correcting\nMPS deficiencies.   At that time, there were five open corrective action plans which  DPI decided\nto consolidate, so it issued consolidated corrective action plans (“CCAPs”) in an effort to tighten up\nits oversight.  Nevertheless,  Child Find problems continued at MPS.\nThen, with the 1999-2000 school year, DPI started increased on-site monitoring.  In May,\n2000, it visited three elementary, three middle, and three high schools, and ten student records were\nreviewed at each school.  DPI found a number of errors in implementation of Child Find, including\na failure to complete timely evaluations in 4.4% of the sampled records.   As a result, a directive\nrequiring corrective action was issued to deal with the compliance problems.  (Exhibit 206.)  \nThe next annual on-site monitoring was conducted in May, 2001, but it did not focus on the\ncompliance problems of the prior year.  This review found additional compliance problems, which\nincluded documentation of data for initial evaluations.  Additional directives requiring corrective\n55\n\naction were issued, (exhibit 208),  and in May, 2002, DPI conducted its third annual on-site review.\nMore problems were found.  The annual on-site monitoring by DPI did not effectively correct\nimplementation problems previously identified within the district.  By letter dated July 18, 2002,\n(exhibit 29), the assistant state superintendent wrote the MPS Superintendent as follows: “With\nrespect to the implementation errors identified in the May 2000 onsite compliance report, the current\nreport documents that MPS has not yet corrected these errors.  These implementation errors must\nbe corrected without undue delay.”  The letter goes on to state that with respect to the CCAP issues\nreviewed, these have not been corrected, and “the district must establish oversight and accountability\nmechanisms at each building to ensure that these continuing implementation errors are corrected.”\nAs a result, DPI ordered MPS to establish for the 2002-2003 school year, a special education\noversight and accountability plan, one which would provide an effective centralized system that\nwould hopefully resolve the compliance problems at the individual school level.  This plan, which\nwas established by school board resolution in June, 2002, became known as SOAP (Special\nEducation Oversight Action Plan).  During the district’s transition to SOAP, DPI did not continue\nits on-site monitoring, but instead worked with MPS in implementing the plan’s protocols.  SOAP\nrequired MPS to develop an internal auditing system that would address the implementation errors\nfound by DPI.  School staff were also trained in the self-assessment program.  In November, 2003,\nthe internal audit plan became known as CIFM  The CIFM plan was subsequently revised and\nadditional forms, procedures and standards were developed by MPS, with the assistance of DPI.\nFinally, a checklist which contained all of the out of compliance issues from the 2000-2002 on-site\nmonitoring was created, as was a list of non checklist items which related to implementation issues.\n56\n\nIn March, 2004, MPS conducted a self-assessment in each of its schools, with a focus on both\nthe checklist and non-checklist items.  During the 2004-2005 school year, MPS changed its policy\nin order to check the accuracy of its underlying data.  Parenthetically, one of the concerns raised by\nplaintiff’s expert Mark Mlawer was that there was an absence of any meaningful verification or\nvalidation by either MPS or DPI of the recorded results.  (Exhibit 9.)  However, even if the numbers\nreported by MPS were not valid, they were relied on by DPI, and they showed that MPS was not in\ncompliance.\nIn any event, the March 2004 self-assessment found a varying range of compliance levels,\nand still showed compliance concerns. Under SOAP, different levels of compliance were to be slated\nfor different degrees of monitoring.  The higher the compliance, the less monitoring was required.\nIf there was 95% or higher compliance, only periodic review was required; ongoing support was\nrequired  for  80-94%  compliance;  and  intensive  monitoring  was  needed  for  less  than  80%\ncompliance.  Therefore, in August, 2004, the Milwaukee School Board directed that each school\nreview its checklist and non-checklist items to see which type of monitoring was required for the\nfollowing school year.\nThe March, 2004 self-assessment disclosed that one half (50.6%) of MPS schools required\nongoing oversight, and 10.9% needed intensive monitoring.  In other words,  61.5% warranted either\nintensive monitoring or ongoing oversight.  The district, as a whole, required ongoing oversight\n(90.5% compliant).  Based on this assessment, Mr. Mlawer concluded that MPS “paint[s] a picture\nof a district with significant compliance concerns. . .”  (Exhibit 9 at 9.)   \nThe foregoing simply highlights some of the key evidence, but having fully considered all\nof the evidence presented, this court concludes that DPI did not satisfactorily fulfill its oversight\n57\n\nobligation under the IDEA.  MPS was in non-compliance, but DPI only had to encounter the\nsituation every six years. Then, during the start of the period involved in this lawsuit, DPI\ncommenced annual on-site monitoring in an effort to pressure compliance. This tool was not\nsuccessful so DPI armed itself with SOAP and CIFM. The procedures changed, but the compliance\npicture remained unsatisfactory.\nDespite its continuing supervisory efforts, the compliance by MPS, while improved in some\nareas, was still inadequate under the law.  For example, the failure of MPS to comply with the 90\nday time limit is one of the major issues in this litigation, but the district had no adequate method\nto track compliance.  Kim Brizendine, the MPS supervisor of special services information, testified\nthat the system for tracking the 90 day time line for evaluations was not satisfactory until the second\nsemester of the 2004-2005 school year.  Her testimony corroborates the findings of Mr. Mlawer, who\nindicated that, in his opinion,  there was only one self-assessment item that even tangentially related\nto the 90 day time limit, and that was non-checklist item #1, which is notification to parents.\n(Exhibit 195.)  This item, however, does not check whether everything required is completed within\nthe 90 day period.  Brizendine testified that it was  necessary to manually track extensions.  The\ndefendants did not present any witnesses who were able to point to any checklist or non-checklist\nitem that monitored each school’s compliance in this area.  Mr. Mlawer, in his report, concludes that\nthe building based self-assessment process “is manifestly inadequate to monitor compliance with the\nrequirements at issue [in this litigation].”  \nMaybe the lack of an adequate system is a partial explanation for the data contained in the\n“Over Ninety Day” report, (exhibit 336).   This summary shows that from the period from July 1,\n2000 to June 30, 2003, MPS had 853 cases over 90 days, with extensions granted in 603 and no\n58\n\nextensions in 250.  For the period from July 1, 2003 to June 30, 2005, 778 cases were over 90 days,\nwith extensions in 529 and no extensions in 249.   As a percentage of the total referred in the district,\nthe over 90 day percentage decreased  from 9.95% to 8.47% during these two periods.  In the latter\nperiod, the summary shows a total of 622 closed cases, i.e. cases which never reached an evaluation.\nParenthetically, there are no standards for closing cases. \nRegardless of the reasons for the non-compliance of MPS, as concerns DPI, the question is\ndid it do all that was reasonably required to assure compliance, even at the 95% level?  It appears\nto this court, that the underlying problem was the failure of DPI to put any teeth into its bite.  DPI\nrequired new procedures, but failed to impose appropriate sanctions when the acronym programs did\nnot produce satisfactory compliance. As Donna Hart-Tervalon, assistant director of special education\nfor DPI, acknowledged, no time line for compliance by use of SOAP was imposed.  She was not\naware of any deadline being established by DPI for MPS to remedy non-compliance items.   Or, as\nElliot Weiman, consultant to DPI on school administration and one of the monitoring co-leaders\nduring the 2000-2005 period, was asked, were there specific consequences for MPS failing to\nimprove?  His answer was that the consequences would be non-resolution of the items and more\nintensive work would continue.  \n  In other words, after the on-site monitoring, in which DPI failed to conduct year-to-year\ncomparisons of non-compliance items, more intensive monitoring was established by way of SOAP\nand CIFM, but no deadlines were ever imposed on MPS.  No consequences were ever imposed.  The\nIDEA gives the supervising state agency a substantial sanction for non- compliance: reduction or\nwithholding of federal funds until compliance is met. 20 U.S.C. § 1413(d)(1).  However, according\nto Stephanie Petska, state director of special education, there were never any monetary sanctions of\n59\n\nwithholding funds imposed.   In her opinion, DPI would rather “direct the use” of funds than\nwithhold, the latter which requires a public hearing.  She also acknowledged that DPI also could\nimpose a sanction of decertifying a district, although that has never been done during her tenure.  \nDPI has urged this court to find that throughout the entire period of this lawsuit, it has\nfulfilled its supervision responsibilities over MPS as they relate to the issues in this litigation.  For\nthe reasons set forth in this decision, the court cannot reach that conclusion.  It finds that DPI during\nthe period in question, and in regard to the issues raised in this lawsuit, has failed to fulfill its\noversight responsibilities over MPS.\nIV.  CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the evidence presented at both Phase I and Phase II of the trial, and for the reasons\nstated above, the court reaches the following conclusions of law:\nA.  The court confirms its certification of the class in this action as,\nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee\nPublic School System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed\nentry or participation in the processes which result in a properly constituted\nmeeting between the IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \nB.  The court concludes that during the time period from September, 2000 to June, 2005, the\ngroup of defendants identified as the Milwaukee Public Schools violated the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act and related state statutes.  These violations consisted of the failure of\nMPS to comply with the provisions of the IDEA known as Child Find.  Pursuant to the requirements\nof the IDEA and related state statutes, MPS failed to adequately identify, locate and evaluate children\nwith disabilities in need of special education and related services.  The court further concludes that\n60\n\nthe violations of MPS during this period of time not only violated the rights of the individual\nplaintiffs, but were systemic in nature and thus violated the rights of the plaintiff class . \nC.   In particular, the court concludes that the systemic violations of the Child Find provisions\nestablished during the trial consisted of the following:  MPS failed to refer children with a suspected\ndisability in a timely manner for an initial evaluation, i.e. the 90 day requirement;  MPS improperly\nextended the 90 day time requirement; MPS imposed suspensions in a manner that improperly\nimpeded its ability to refer children with suspected disabilities for an initial evaluation; and MPS\nfailed to insure that the child’s parents or guardians attend the initial evaluation.  The court further\nconcludes that the actions of MPS in not reviewing all data to determine the exact nature of the\nchild’s disability, while violations in individual cases, did not constitute systemic violations of the\nIDEA.\nD.  The court concludes that during the time period from September, 2000 to June, 2005, the\ngroup of defendants identified as the Department of Public Instruction  violated the Individuals with\nDisabilities Education Act and related state statutes.  The violation of DPI consisted of its failure to\nadequately discharge its oversight and supervisory obligations in regard to the compliance by MPS\nwith the IDEA and related state statutes, as that compliance relates to the systemic violations found\nby the court.   \nIn reaching the foregoing conclusions, the court notes that the period in question spanned five\nyears and the situation did not remain static.  The evidence established that, throughout this period,\nboth MPS and DPI were aware of their respective responsibilities to comply with the Child Find\nprovisions of the law, and they made efforts to discharge these responsibilities.  As discussed in this\ndecision, their respective efforts, while taken in good faith, were not adequate to bring MPS into\n61\n\nsatisfactory compliance.   As further discussed, as DPI continued to insist upon more thorough\ninternal accountability procedures, compliance by MPS did improve in some areas, but overall,\nremained uneven.  However, the evidence established that by the end of the time period under\nanalysis, June, 2005, the situation regarding Child Find was in a much better position than it was at\nthe start of the period, September, 2000.   Furthermore, according to the testimony of one of the\ndefendant’s experts, Dr. Judy Schrag, it takes time for the internal accountability procedures to work\nand things are improving.  The court would hope that Dr. Schrag’s assessment is accurate; if not, no\nlessons have been learned by the parties as a result of this protracted litigation.\nNevertheless, even though the court has determined liability, before judgment can be entered,\nthe court must address the issue of what sanctions/remedies are appropriate to be imposed.  As for\nindividual  members  of  the  class,  since  these  students  with  disabilities  may  have  suffered\neducationally as a result of Child Find failures, are they entitled to some form of compensatory\neducation?  \nNext, since the violations were systemic in nature, what sanctions should be imposed to bring\nMPS into satisfactory compliance with the IDEA?  Is satisfactory compliance considered something\nless than the 100% required by law? In order to address these questions, the present level of\ncompliance for MPS must be determined.  How much improvement has occurred since the latest\ninternal accountability procedures were put into place and since the CIFMS approach has been\nimplemented? One of the plaintiff’s experts, Dr. James Tucker testified that a number of things can\nbe done to bring a school district into compliance.  One of his recommendations is for the state\nsupervisory agency to establish a “stakeholders group,” which would consist of representatives of\nevery organization that has a stake in seeing that children receive a free appropriate public education.\n62\n\nDPI recently instituted such a group, and it includes participation by plaintiffs’ counsel.  Dr. Tucker\nalso recommended that an outside monitor be appointed to oversee full and appropriate development\nand implementation of Child Find strategies. \nTo resolve the issues raised in this next step of the litigation, the court will need to receive\ninput from the parties.  In an effort to avoid a fully litigated Phase III, it would be appropriate for the\nparties to again attempt to resolve this case by mutual agreement.  The court knows the parties have\nmade prior efforts to settle this case, but those efforts were unsuccessful.  In the court’s opinion, now\nis the time to renew such efforts.  It seems that a mutually agreeable solution would be more\nsatisfactory than a court-imposed resolution.  Also, it would have the effect of terminating the\nlitigation, except for a possible supervisory role by the court.  An agreement between the parties\nwould expedite remedies and curtail continuing litigation costs, especially if either or both parties\ncontemplate an appeal.\nHowever, the court can only suggest, but the parties must act.  This court must proceed with\nthe case and to that end, the court will schedule a status conference with the parties to discuss the\nsanction/remedy phase of this case.  This conference will be conducted on September 27, 2007 at\n10:00 a.m., in Room 254, United States Courthouse, 517 E. Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 11th day of September, 2007.\ns/AARON E.

      "title": "Order Granting in Part Plaintiffs' Motion for Interim Attorneys' Fees",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nJAMIE S. et. al., \n \n     Plaintiffs,     \n \n    v.            Case No. 01-C-928 \n \nMILWAUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS, et. al., \n \n     Defendants. \n \n \n \nORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR INTERIM \nATTORNEYS’ FEES \n \n \n  Currently pending before the court is the p laintiffs’ motion for interim attorneys’ fees. \n(Docket No. 392.) The defendants have filed  a joint response. (Docket No.  400.) The plaintiffs’ \nhave replied, (Docket No. 408), and after obtaining permission of the court, (see Docket No. 416), \nthe defendants filed a joint sur-reply, (Docket No. 418).  \n  While this motion was pending, the plaintiffs entered into a class settlement agreement with \nthe  Department  of Public Instruc tion  (“DPI”) defendants, (Docket No.  431),  which was \nsubsequently approved by the court, (Docket No.  509), after a final fairness hearing, (Docket No. \n510). DPI agreed to pay $475,000.00 in attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs a s a part of this  \nclass settlement agreement and was subsequently di smissed from this case. (Docket No. 431-2 at \n18.) Therefore, the present dispute over attorney s’ fees now involves onl y the Milwaukee Public \nSchools (“MPS”) defendants.  \n \n \n\nPREVAILING PARTY \n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) permits a prevailing party to \nrecover reasonable attorneys’ fees. Specifically, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B) states:  \nIn any action or proceeding brought under this section, the court, in its discretion, \nmay award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs— \n            (I) to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.  \n \nMPS objects to the p laintiffs’ request for interim attorneys’ fees on the basis th at the \nplaintiffs are not yet a prevailing party.  \nSo far, this case has pro ceeded through two phases of court trial; a final rem edies phase is \nscheduled to begin November 3, 2008. In a deci sion and order following the second phase of the \ncourt trial dated September 11, 2007, the court determined that the defendants systemically violated \nthe IDEA. (Docket No. 389.) Nonetheless, MPS argues that since the plaintiffs have not obtained an \nenforceable legal judgment against the defendant and there has been no judicially sanctioned change \nin the legal relationship between the parties, the plaintiffs are not  a prevailing party. (Docket N o. \n404 at 14-15.) \nWith respect to a reque st for interim attorneys’ fees, the Seventh Circuit held that “once a \nplaintiff obtains substantive relief that is not defeasible by further proceedings, he can seek interim \nfees and the district court has the power to award them.” Dupuy v. Samuels, 423 F.3d 714, 719 (7th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Richardson v. Penfold, 900 F.2d 116, 119 (7th Cir. 1990)).  \nThe only matter left to be decided in this cas e is the remedy; the question of liability was \ndetermined  by the court in its Septem ber  11,  2007  Decision and Order. The plaintiffs have \nprevailed. There is nothing that could be reasonab ly expected to o ccur in Phase III that would \nremove such status from the plaintiffs. Even if th e court completely rejected the plaintiffs’ requests \nfor relief, the plaintiffs would nonetheless be th e prevailing party, having prevailed in the crucial \n  2\n\nquestion of liability. Thus, the court finds that an aw ard of interim attorneys’ fees is appropriate in \nthis case.  \nATTORNEYS’ FEES \n  Turning to the content of the plaintiffs’ clai m for interim attorneys’ fees, MPS objects to \ncertain fees requested, such as fees related to unsuccessful efforts to certify the class, unsuccessful \nmediation, media contacts, attendance at IEP m eetings, experts, and travel. Further, MPS argues  \nthat the fees claimed are vague. (Docket No. 404 at 5.)  \n  The  plaintiffs seek $1,200,891.32 in attorneys’ fees and $119,007.57 in costs incurred \nthrough the end of September 2007. (Docket No. 392 at 3.) In support of  this claim, the plaintiffs \nsubmitted  a 104-page exhibit detailing the co sts  and fees incurred. (Docket No. 393- 2.)  This \ndocument sets forth roughly 7,400 hours of work on th is case covering more than six years. The \nhours  include the tim e  of four  attorneys  (totaling alm ost  3,700 hou rs  of attorney tim e),  five \nparalegals (totaling roughly 2,600 hours of paralegal time), and seven law clerks (totaling roughly \n1,200 hours of law clerk time).  \nThe most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the \nnumber of hours reaso nably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable \nhourly rate. This calculation provides an objec tive basis on which to make an initial \nestimate of the value of a lawyer' s services. The party seeking an award of fees \nshould submit evidence supporting the hours  worked and rates claimed. W here the \ndocumentation  of hour s  is inadequate, th e  district court m ay  reduce the award \naccordingly. \n \nHensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).  \n  Beginning with the question of  a reasonable hourly rate, atto rneys Jeffrey Spitzer-Resnick \nand Monica Murphy each request compensation at an hourly rate of $265.00. Patrick Berigan seeks \ncompensation at an hourly rate of $250.00, and  Michael Bachhuber seeks compensation at $215.00 \nper hour. For paralegal time, plaintiffs seek compensation at the rate of $80.00 per hour and for law \nclerks at the rate of $40.00 per hour.  MPS  objects to these hourly   rates on the basis that the  \n  3\n\nplaintiffs  have failed to present adequate ev idence  to support the conclusion that they are \nreasonable.  \n  In determining whether an hourly rate is re asonable, a court should  evaluate what is a \nprevailing market rate in the relevant community for an attorney of comparable experience, skill, \nand reputation. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11 (1984). “[ T]he burden is on the fee \napplicant to produce satisfactory evidence -- in addition to the attorney's own affidavits -- that the \nrequested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of \nreasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.” Id. at 896 n.11.  \n  In support of the fees requested is attorney  Spitzer-Resnick’s affidavit in which he outlines \nthe experience of the attorneys and support staff at Disability Rights Wisconsin (“DRW”) for whom \nhe seeks compensation as follows: \nI [Attorney Spitzer-Resnick] have been a  practicing attorney for 22 years. I have \nlitigated complex cases in both state and federal court both at the trial and appellate \nlevels. I have been an attorney at DRW  for over 12 years, during which tim e I have \nbecome an expert in special education matters. \n   \nAttorney  Monica Murphy has been a pract icing  attorney for 21 years. She has \nlitigated complex cases in both state and federal court both at the trial and appellate \nlevels. She has been an  attorney at DRW for over 13 years, during which tim e she \nhas become an expert in special education matters. \n \nAttorney Patrick Berigan was e mployed at DRW from November, 2000-August, \n2006, as a Supervising Attorney. A t the time he left DRW, he had over 22 years of \nexperience practicing as an attorney. \n \nAttorney Mike Bachhuber was employed at DRW from June, 1997-November, 2003. \nAt the time he left DRW, he had over 18 years of experience practicing as an \nattorney, including litigating complex class action and special education matters. \n   \nParalegal Terri Fuller was employed at DRW from September, 1995-August, 2007. \nAt the time she left DRW, she had over 16 years of paralegal equivalent experience. \nShe had significant expertise in special education matters. \n \nParalegal Cathy Steffke has been employe d at DRW since February, 2004. To date, \nshe  has nearly 23 years of paralegal equi valent  experience. She has significant \nexpertise in special education matters. \n \n  4\n\nParalegal Jo Cauley has been e mployed at DRW since January, 2000. To date, she  \nhas over 12 years of paralegal equivalent experience. She has significant expertise in \nspecial education matters. \n \nParalegal Susan Tess has been employe d at DRW since November 1986. Her 21 \nyears  of paraleg al  experience  at DRW   has  given her significant disability law \nexperience. \n \nParalegal  Catherine Krieps was employe d  at DRW from J une,  2000-December, \n2002. During this period, she gained significant special education experience. \n \nLaw Clerks Melanie Cairns, Vanessa Carroll, Jonathan Kinkel, Kathryn Peacock, \nErin Parks and Demian Casey were all law students while working at DRW on this \ncase. \n \nLaw Clerk Krystal Thomas was trained by DRW legal professionals to investigate \nand conduct research in this case. \n \n(Docket No. 393-1 at ¶¶4a-k.)  \nThe other evidence provided by the plaintiffs  in support of the proposed  hourly rate is the \naffidavit of Lynn Novotnak. (Docket No. 394.) Attorney Novotnak,  a shareholder at the law firm of \nHawks, Quindel, Ehlke & Perry, SC in Milwaukee, has been a practicing attorney for 26 years and \nhas spent the last 15 years focusing upon “representing plaintiffs in a variety of civil rights matters, \nincluding cases involving state and federal special education law, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, and Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.” (Docket No. 394 at 1.) Depending upon the nature and \ncomplexity of the case, she charges clients $200.00 per hour in special education cases and the firm \ncharges $50.00 per hour for paralegal work. (D ocket No. 394 at 1.) Attorn ey Novotnak also avers \nthat the rates charged requested by the plaintiffs are reasonable. (Docket No. 394 at 2.)  \n  MPS argues that the affidavit of plaintiffs’ c ounsel is insufficient to support the requested \nfees and that the only competent evidence provided by the plaintiffs establishes that the prevailing \nmarket rate in the Milwaukee area is no more than $200 per hour for attorney time and $50 per hour \nfor paralegal time. (Docket No. 404 at 31.)  \n  5\n\n  The court disagrees with MPS in part regard ing the reasonableness of the hourly rates for \nplaintiff’s attorneys. Even though attorney Novotnak  is very experienced and  bills at a lower rate \nthan plaintiffs’ counsel, the present class action has been exceptionally complex and has required an \nextra degree of expertise and ski ll in its prosecution. As such, the  court finds that the hourly rates  \ncharged by plaintiffs’ lead counsel, attorneys Spitzer-Resnick and Murphy, are reasonable.  \nAs for attorneys Patrick Berigan and Mich ael Bachhuber, based upon  their experience in \nrelation to attorneys Sp itzer-Resnick and Murphy, and in view  of attorney Novotnak’s rate, the \ncourt finds that a rate of $200.00 per hour is reasonable.  \n  On the other hand, turning to the requested hourly rate for paralegals, the court finds that the \nplaintiffs have failed to dem onstrate that $80.00 per hou r is a reasonable prev ailing market rate. \nRather, the court finds that the $50.00 per hour rate set forth in the affidavit of attorney Novotnak is \nan appropriate prevailing market rate.  \nFinally, there is the question of a reasonable hourly rate for law clerks. It is unclear if these \nlaw clerks were paid or volunteers. In any event,  in light of the fact  that DRW acknowledges that \nthe value of the work of temporary law clerks, the majority of whom were law students, is half that \nof an experienced paralegal, the court finds a  rate of $25.00 per hour is appropriate for these law \nclerks.  \n  Having determined reasonable hourly rates, the second step in the formula is a determination \nof a reasonable number of hours expended by the plai ntiffs in this litigation. MPS argues that the \ncourt should substantially reduce the hours claim ed by the plaintiffs because th e plaintiffs are \nseeking compensation for matters on which they did  not prevail. For example, there were several \nunsuccessful efforts to certify the class; m any time entries are vague and thus do not perm it the \ncourt to determine whether the time claim ed was reasonably expended; and the plaintiffs seek \n  6\n\ncompensation for non-compensable activities such as  attending IEP meetings, contacts with the  \nmedia, or attending unsuccessful mediation.  \n  The court agrees with the defendants that  some reduction of the total hours claim ed is \nwarranted. A line-by-line analysis of the more than 100 pages of b illing records submitted in this \ncase is impractical and not required. Harper v. City of Chicago Heights, 223 F.3d 593, 605 (7th Cir. \n2000). Rather, a review ing court may, if appropriate,  strike the unacceptabl e entry or reduce the \nrequested hours by a reasonable percentage.  Id. “Whichever option the district court chooses, it is \nrequired to ‘provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award’ that is sufficient \nto permit appellate review.” Id. (quoting Ohio-Sealy Mattress Mfg. Co. v. Sealy Inc., 776 F.2d 646, \n658 (7th Cir. 1985) (in turn quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983))).  \n  MPS argues that the plain tiffs are inappropriately s eeking compensation for 291.55 hours \nspent at IEP meetings. (See Docket No. 405-2.)  20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(D)(ii) prohibits the award \nfor attorneys fees relating to a ny IEP meeting “unless such meeting is convened as a result of an \nadministrative proceeding or judicial action.” The plaintiffs respond to MPS’ objection by stating \nsimply, “It goes without saying that every IEP  meeting which was include d in the plaintiffs’ \nsubmission was an IEP meeting which was convened as a result of this litigation.” (Docket No. 48 \nat 14.)  \n  The court is not persuaded by the plaintiffs’ pe rfunctory explanation. This court declines to \naccept  a co nclusory  statement  that every IEP   meeting  convened during the p endency  of this  \nlitigation was as a result of judicial action. While  the court recognizes that  both defendants took \ncertain remedial action during the pendency of this litigation, none of it was in response to any court \norder.  Therefore, sim ply  because a particular   IEP was c onvened  during the pendency of t his \nlitigation does not support the conclusion that it was as a result of this action. Accordingly, the court \nfinds that the plaintiffs have failed in their burden to demonstrate that the IEP meetings for which \n  7\n\nthey seek compensable time were convened as a result of judicial action. Since the plaintiffs do not \nchallenge MPS’ allocation of the time it alleges was improperly charged for IEP meetings, the court \nshall accept the figures set forth in MPS’ Exhibit  F, (Docket No. 405-2.) Therefore, the court shall \nsubtract the following hours: Attorney Murphy – 87.10 hours; Attorney Bachhuber – 66.00 hours; \nAttorney Berigan – 33.45 hours; paralegal Fuller  – 52.50 hours; and paralegal Steffke – 52.50 \nhours.  \n  As for the plaintiffs’ request for compensation for time spent in con tact with the m edia, \ncourts have differed on whether or  not such time is compensable. See Roger Whitmore’s Auto. \nServs., Inc. v. Lake County, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21626, 27-29 (N.D. Ill. 2004) (citing cases); see \nalso Mercier v. City of La Crosse, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11106, 3-5 (W.D. Wis. 2004). The court \nfinds that under certain circumstances, media contacts may be compensable time, provided that the \ntime spent was “reasonably expended on the litigation.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. For example, in a \ncomplex class action case such as this, a certa in amount of media contact may be a reasonably \nexpected responsibility of class counsel as a means to ensure that the class members are notified of \nthe pendency of this action and their respective rights.  \n  However, plaintiffs’ counsel do not allege th at this was the reason for the m edia contacts. \nRather, in support of their request for fees related to media contacts, the plaintiffs state: \nThe instant case that is bei ng litigated by plaintiffs ag ainst governmental entities \nwhich are clearly subject to the influence of the democratic process, which is, in turn, \nsubject  to influence by the m edia.  Indeed,  DRW’s  media  contacts have been \nconsistent with this court’s efforts to try to encourage the parties to resolve this \nmatter through settlement. \n   \n(Docket No. 408 at 14.)  \nSettlement is to be encouraged, and this cour t has been a proponent of such a resolution.   \nNevertheless, the court finds that a  party’s attempts to use the media in an effort to create ex ternal \npressure upon the opposing parties is not tim e for which compensation should be awarded from \n  8\n\nsuch parties. When cases such as this are of public im portance, the court certainly hopes that the  \nmedia would fully inform  the public. But if one pa rty attempts to use the m edia as a m eans to \nmanipulate public opinion against an opponent, in an e ffort to either engender settlement or further \nits own aims, this is not an expenditure of tim e this court believes is reasonably necessary to the \nlitigation.  Therefore, such tim e  is not com pensable.  The plaintiffs do not challenge MPS’ \ncalculation of hours spent on non-com pensable media work and therefore the court shall deduct  \n5.10 hours from the hours of attorney Spitzer-Resnick, (Docket Nos. 400-6, 400-10), and 5.60 hours \nfrom the hours of attorney Monica Murphy, (Docket No. 400-10).  \n  MPS  also subm its  that  time  spent during   unsuccessful  mediation  sessions should be  \ncompensated. The court disagrees. As stated above, settlement should be encouraged. However, not \nevery attempt to resolve the case by the parties may be successful, but they should not be dissuaded \nfrom  making  the effort. The court finds that m ediation  effort, even if   unsuccessful, is time  \nreasonably expended on the litigation. An unsu ccessful mediation if pursued in good faith is not \ntime wasted, and therefore the court rejects MPS’ position that this time should not be compensated.  \n  Next, MPS contends that the  plaintiffs should not be compensated for tim e related to the \nplaintiffs’ unsuccessful effort to have this court reconsider its class determination and for time spent \non an appeal of the court’s class certification. In  response, the plaintiffs acknowledge they are not \nentitled to be compensated for this time and withdraw their claims for these fees and costs.  \n  MPS alleges that this tim e amounts to 82.00 hours, (Docket No. 405-3), and again the \nplaintiffs do not challenge MPS’  accounting. A review of the affi davit exhibit cited by MPS in \nsupport of this claim indicates that attorney Spitzer-Resnick spent 32.00 hours, attorney Bachhuber \nspent 2.5 hours and law clerk Peacock spend 47.5 hours for a total of 82.00 hours, (Docket No. 405-\n3.) Therefore, the court shall reduce these hours from those claimed by the plaintiffs.  \n  9\n\n  MPS  raises num erous  other specific objectio ns  to the fees claim ed,  most  significantly \narguing that the hours expended be fore November 13, 2003, the date  the court finally certified the \nclass, should be exclud ed because they were expe nded in an unsuccessful effort to certify a f ar \nbroader class than the one the court eventually certified. (Docket No. 19-20.) The plaintiffs respond \nthat this time should be fully compensable because, although they had to try numerous times before \nthey finally obtained class certif ication, this effort was nonethel ess necessary to  their eventual \nsuccess.  (Docket  No. 408 at 5-11.) MPS also seeks reductions for tim e  spent related to the \nplaintiffs’ efforts to obtain documents prepared by the Department of Justice relating to the subject \nmatter of this action.  \n  The court finds som e reduction of tim e is appropriate in light of  the plaintiffs’ failure to \nobtain as broad a class certification as they had originally desired. In other words, certain amounts \nof  time  devoted to plaintiffs’ num erous  unsuccessful  efforts of cl ass  certification  are  not \ncompensable, but this adjustment should be considered in the final step of the lodestar analysis, i.e. \nan adjustment based upon the degree of success obtained.  \n“The  Supreme  Court has said that ‘the mo st  critical  factor’  in  determining  the \nreasonableness of a fee award ‘is the degree of success obtained.’” Linda T. v. Rice Lake Area Sch. \nDist., 417 F.3d 704, 708 (7th  Cir. 2005) (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436). If  a plaintiff fails to \nprevail on claims that are distinguishable from those that he prevailed upon, the fee award should be \nappropriately reduced. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.  \nIn the present case, as a result of several rulings, the court narrowed the scope of the class \nsubstantially from that sought by plaintiffs. Undoubt edly, many of the hours the plaintiffs spent in \nthese early stages of the case involved issues on wh ich the plaintiffs did not prevail. Although the \nplaintiffs attempt to argue that all of this time was nonetheless related to the prevailing claims, the \ncourt rejects this contention. The class eventually  certified, and thus  the scope of this case is \n  10\n\nsubstantially narrower than that which the plai ntiffs initially sought. Much tim e and effort was \nexpended by plaintiffs’ counsel in an attem pt to initially persuade this c ourt to adopt plaintiffs’ \nposition on the class, an d then to seek a reconsiderat ion. It is simply illogical to conclude that all \ntime relating to matters beyond the eventual scope of  this litigation was reasonably related to this \nlitigation. Additionally, the plaintiffs were not fully successful on other issues such as their efforts  \nrelated to the Department of Justice.  \nHowever, once the class was certified by the court,  the plaintiffs were largely successful. A \ncomparison of the unsuccessful portions of the  case with the portions on which the plaintiffs \nprevailed indicates that the former constitutes a small percentage. Transposing that small percent to \nthe hours expended, the court finds that a minimal reduction of 5% is appropriate.  \n  Finally, MPS argues that the court should red uce the fees claim ed by 40% becau se the \nentries on the billing statements are vague and do not permit the court to analyze whether the stated \nactivity was reasonably expended in  furtherance of the present liti gation. The plaintiffs’ attorneys \nrespond that their billin g records have been accepted by ot her courts without any reduction f or \nvagueness. (Docket No. 408 at 14-15.)  \n  In this court’s opinion, the billing records submitted are filled with vague entries, which \nmakes it impossible to evaluate whether the hours were reasonably related to the plaintiffs’ success. \nFor example, the billing records repeatedly provide only terse explanations of the work performed, \nsuch as “Email to . . .,” Telephone Conversation with . . .,” or “Meeting with . . . .” For certain \npersons, particularly the law clerks, the time records are even more vague, often times providing \nonly a single word such as “Research” or “Drafting” to describe the work performed. However, the \ncourt acknowledges that the to tal hours alleged are not, on  their face, unreasonab le. This is an \nexceptionally complex and time consuming case and the court would expect thousands of hours to \n  11\n\nbe expended. But even acknowledgi ng this, the court is  not able to look past  the vague billing \nentries.  \nHaving  already concluded that the plainti ffs  have included num erous  non-compensable \nactivities on the their billing statements, the court finds it likely that buried within these vague \nentries is time that was not reaso nably related to the plaintiffs’ success in this case. Howe ver, \nneither the court nor MPS is able to neatly discern which entries are not compensable, in light of the \nfact that the entries are so vague. Therefore, the court finds it appropriate to make a reduction for \nthis  vagueness.  But, s imilar  to the unsucce ssful/successful  comparative  analysis,  the co urt \nconcludes that any vagueness redu ction should also be m inimal. See J. v. Board of Educ. , 98 F. \nSupp. 2d 226, 243 (D. Conn. 2000). Therefore, the court concludes that an additional 5% reduction \nis appropriate.  \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is the conclu sion of this court th at the total interim \nattorneys’ fees through September 30, 2007 appropriate in this case is $934.123.96. See Appendix. \nAfter  subtracting from   this fi gure  the $475,000.00 that D PI  has agre ed  to pay as part of its  \nsettlement with the plaintiffs, MPS’ obligation is $459,123.96.  \nCOSTS \nThe plaintiffs seek $119,007.57 in costs pursuan t to 28 U.S.C. § 1920. (Docket N o. 392.) \nThis District’s Local Rules are explicit that costs  are not recoverable unt il after the en try of \njudgment. Civil L.R. 54.1. The Rule further explains  that the party seeking to recover costs m ust \nserve on the adverse party and serve with the Clerk of Court the party’s bill of costs. Judgment has \nnot yet been entered and the plaintiffs have not complied with this procedure.  \nIn light of this District’s Local Rule requ iring judgment be entered before the award of \ntaxable  costs, the cou rt  finds that an award o f  costs,  unlike an award for atto rneys’  fees, is \npremature at this point. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ request for costs shall be denied without prejudice.  \n  12\n\nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that the plaintif fs’ motion for interim attorneys’ fees, \n(Docket  No. 392), is  granted  as modified .  The MPS defendants shall pay to the plaintiffs ’ \nattorneys, Disability Rights Wisconsin, the amount of  $459,123.96. The plaintiffs’ m otion for \ninterim costs is denied without prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that defendants’ m otion for leave to file excess pages, \n(Docket No. 399), is granted. \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 15th day of August 2008. \n \n \n             s/AARON E.

      "title": "Order Denying Motion for Stay",
      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nJAMIE S., et. al., individually and  \non behalf of the class, \n \n      Plaintiffs, \n \n    v.              Case No. 01-C-928 \n \nMILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, et. al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \nORDER DENYING MOTION FOR STAY \n \n \nOn September 13, 2001, the plainti ffs filed their com plaint, alleging violations under the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et  seq. (“IDEA”) and related state \nstatutes, Wis. Stat. §§ 115.758, et seq. Nearly 8 years later, after 28 days and three phases of a court \ntrial, tens of thousands of pages of exhibits, an d more than 600 separate docket entries, on June 9, \n2009 this court entered a decision  and order setting forth a framework through which the members \nof the class harmed by MPS’ systemic violations of its Child Find obligat ions may obtain relief. \n(Docket No. 598.) In this decision and order, the cour t set forth a timeline for implementing the \ncourt ordered remedy.  \nMPS filed an appeal, (Docket No.  604), and on July 21, 2009, file d a motion to stay the  \ncourt-ordered remedy pending the resolution of its appeal, (Docket No.  618). Accompanying this \nmotion is a 19 page brief wherein MPS outlines its arguments in favor of a stay. Because time is of \nthe essence, with July 24, 2009 being the deadline for the part ies to submit the names of proposed \nindependent monitors, MPS has requested either oral argument or expedited briefing to resolve its \nmotion. The court finds that neither expedited briefing nor oral argument is necessary.  \n\nIn assessing whether a stay is warranted, [a] district court [is] required to determine \nwhether the party seeking the stay has de monstrated that: 1) it has a reasonable \nlikelihood of success on the m erits; 2) no adequate remedy at law exists; 3) it will \nsuffer irreparable harm if it is denied; 4) the irreparable harm the party will suf fer \nwithout relief is greater th an the harm the opposing party will suffer if the stay is  \ngranted; and 5) the stay will be in the public interest.  \n \nHinrichs v. Bosma, 440 F.3d 393, 396 (7th Cir. 2006) (citing Kiel v. City of Kenosha, 236 F.3d 814, \n815-16 (7th Cir. 2000)). If an appeal has no merit  at all, the request f or a stay should be denied. \nCavel Int'l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 544, 547 (7th Cir. 2007). If,  however, appellants have some \nlikelihood of success on appeal, then the court applies a “sliding scale” approach, u nder which the \ncourt weighs the likelihood of success and ex tent of irreparable harm likely to b e suffered by \nappellants against the harm likely to be suffered by appellees if stay is entered. Id. \n  Beginning with the question of whether MPS  has a reasonable likelihood of success on the \nmerits, as indicated above, this case is exceptionally complex. Accordingly, there have been m any \nissues that required resolution, and MPS seeks to challenge many unfavorable rulings on appeal. In \nits motion, MPS states its legal positions on these issues, positions the court did not find persuasive. \nIt is not necessary for the cour t to restate its rulings , but simply acknowledge that because these \nissues were complex, both legally and factually,  and were at times somewhat novel, it is possible \nthat an appellate court may reach a different conc lusion. This is no t an outcome that this court \nregards as highly likely, but it is nonethele ss reasonably likely. Thus, the court must apply the               \n“  sliding scale ” to weigh the com peting interests at issue to determine whether this court should \ngrant or deny the stay.  \n  MPS argues that it will be irreparably harmed should a stay be denied, because the financial \nburden of the remedy will be great, while any comparable harm to the plaintiffs if a stay is granted \nis de minimis. In considering the motion of MPS,  the court finds that two factors overwhelm ingly \ntip the balance in favor of denying a stay. As no ted above, this case has already been pending for \nnearly 8 years. The class period spans from September of 2000 through June of 2005. Thus, certain \n  2\n\nclass members have already been waiting nearly ni ne years for compensation for MPS’ failures to \ncomply with the IDEA. Based upon the proposed tim eline set forth in this court’s order, it is likely \nto be at least another year before any class members are provided with an individualized remedy.  \nThe cliché, “Justice delayed is justice denied,” is appropriate here. As the evidence in this \ncase has made clear, every delay in providing compensatory services to a student who was denied \nFAPE compounds the harm of the prior denial. A student who is not provided with the elem ents \nessential for an educational foundation lacks the basis upon which to build all subsequent education. \nA decade of delay and denial has already caused substantial injury to class members; any continued \ndelay will not only continue but rather exace rbate the harm. Additionally, for a wide varie ty of \nreasons, any additional delay will undoubtedly result in a decrease in the number of class members \nwho will respond to any class notice and thus  will obtain relief. The aim of this litig ation is to \nensure that all reason able steps are taken to en sure that as many class members as possible are \nprovided with the remedy to which they are entitled. Granting a stay would run counter to this goal.  \nFurther, the public interest weighs in favor  of denying MPS’ motion for a stay. W hen the \nharm of MPS’ failures is exacerbated by a further delay, not only does every class member suffer, \nbut the harm extends to the public as a whole. The consequences of MPS’ systemic denial of FAPE \nmanifest themselves every day in countless varied ways throughout this community.  \nFurther, the court is m indful of the fact that  MPS’ status as a public entity m eans that the \ncosts of the litigation are ultimately borne by taxpayers. MPS has emphasized this point throughout \nthis litigation, for example, contending that any remedy should be limited because of the potential \ncost  to the district. A lthough  as  a general m atter  the expense of   compliance  or rem edying \nnoncompliance is not an appropriate consideration for the court, when considering whether to grant \nor deny a stay, costs for taxpayers is an appropria te consideration falling within in the pu blic \ninterest factor. In this regard, a further delay wi ll simply exacerbate costs. For example, any delay  \n  3\n\nwill likely make any necessary compensatory services more expensive due to the fact that existing \neducational deficits will be exacerbated. Not only do the deficits become more substantial and thus \nmore difficult and expensive to rem edy, but it may be  reasonable to conclude that as students get \nolder, the most appropriate com pensatory services will be found outside of MPS. To be bl unt, \nconcerns about money do not trump providing appropriate education. \n In weighing the competing interests, it is the conclusion of the court that the harm to class \nmembers and the public that would result should this court grant a stay substantially outweighs the \nrisk of irreparable harm that the defendants may suffer should a stay be denied. Accordingly, MPS’ \nmotion for a stay, (Docket No. 618), is denied.  \nSO ORDERED.  \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 22nd day of July 2009. \n \n             s/AARON E.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nJAMIE S., on behalf of the class, \n \n      Plaintiffs, \n    v.            Case No. 01-C-928 \n \nMILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, et. al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \n \n \nORDER APPOINTING INDEPENDENT MONITOR \n \n \n  In  this court’s Decision and Order Follo wing  Phase III, (Doc ket  No.  598), the court \nconcluded that an independent m onitor is necessary to oversee and implem ent the court ordered \nclass remedy. On July 24, 2009, the parties each submitted the names of three nominees to serve as \nthe independent monitor as well as affidavits required under Rule 53(b)(3)(A). ( See Docket Nos. \n624, 627, 628, 629, 630.) On July 31, 2009, each party sub mitted a response to the other party ’s \nproposal. (Docket No. 633, 635, 636.)  \nHaving  carefully reviewed these subm issions  and  conducted telephone   interviews with \ncertain candidates, the court hereby appoints Elise T. Baach to serve as the independent monitor in \nthis case pursuant to Rule 53 of th e Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. ( Rule 53 refers to “masters.” \nThe court uses the term “monitor” here because it is the term used by the parties, and it better connotes \nthe role envisioned by the court. Substantively, the distinction is one without consequence.) \n  The independent monitor shall proceed with all reasonable diligence to implem ent the remedy \nset forth within this court’s Decision and Order Following P hase III, (Docket No. 598), which is  \nincorporated herein by reference.  \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/19/09   Page 1 of 5   Document 638\n\n   The independent monitor is empowered to “regulate all proceedings” necessary to effectuate \nthe court ordered remedy and to “take all appropriate measures to perform the assigned duties fairly \nand efficiently.” Rule 53(c)(1). The independent monitor shall have the primary authority to fill in \nthe details to the framework the court constructed in its Decision and Order Following Phase III, \n(Docket No. 598), regarding the m eans by which pur ported class members shall be evaluated to \ndetermine  whether th ey  are entitled to compen satory  services. A prim ary  concern for the \nindependent monitor shall be ensuring that this remedy is implemented in an expeditious m anner, \nincluding establishing deadlines for completing all phases of this remedy, so as to not unnecessarily \nfurther delay any relief for class members.  \nIn accordance with Rule 53(d), the independent monitor shall issue orders necessary to effect the \nremedy the court discusses in more detail below, including, for example, orders appointing permanent \nmembers to the hybrid IEP team, and establishing the guidelines that the hybrid IEP team shall apply in \nmaking  the  individualized  determinations  necessary  for  each purported  class  member.  Further,  in \naccordance with the Appendix to this court’s Decision and Order Following Phase III, (Docket No. \n598),  which is incorporated herein b y  reference,  the independent m onitor  shall  be  tasked  with \nestablishing firm deadlines to complete all tasks necessary to implement this remedy. The independent \nmonitor is authorized to issue orders establishing such deadlines throughout the implementation process. \nThe  independent m onitor  may  communicate ex parte w ith  any party whenever the \nindependent monitor concludes that it is necessary to effectuate  her designated responsibilities. \nHowever,  in general, the independent m onitor  should  act with a presum ption  that ex parte \ncommunication is an exception to the norm of communicating with the parties. Examples where ex \nparte communication might be appropriate are scheduling or other administrative tasks or when the \nindependent monitor assumes the role of  mediator in an e ffort to bring the parties to a m utually \nagreeable conclusion.  \n  2\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/19/09   Page 2 of 5   Document 638\n\n  The independent monitor may communicate ex  parte with the court if the independent \nmonitor concludes that it is necessary to effectuate her designated responsibilities. Such ex parte \ncommunications with the court sh all not involve substa ntive matters over which the independent \nmonitor has responsibility, but shall be limited to matters of administrative concern. For example, at \nno point should the independent monitor communicate ex parte with the court regarding individuals \nconsidered to be appointed to the hybrid IEP  team, specific guidelines under consideration by the \nhybrid IEP team, whether an individual claim ant is or is not a class m ember, or the nature of \ncompensatory services that are appropriate for any individual class member. From time to time, the \ncourt may engage in ex parte status conferences  with the independent monitor to inquire generally \nas to the progress in implementing the remedy. \n  The court may periodically require the independent monitor to file reports with the cour t \npursuant to Rule 53(e).  \n  The independent monitor shall preserve all documents relating to communications between \nthe independent monitor and the parties and potent ial and actual class members. The independent \nmonitor need not preserve her individual work pr oduct, which might include items such as draft \ndocuments created by her or her ow n personal notes. At a later date, the court shall issue an order \nidentifying which preserved documents should be filed as the record of the independent monitor’s \nactivities.  \n  Pursuant to Rule 53(g)(2)(A) and in accordan ce with Rule 53(g)(3 ), the MPS defendants \nshall pay all cos ts associated with the independent monitor. The independent monitor shall be \ncompensated as follows:  \n  $225 per hour for all work performed by the in dependent monitor that is necessary to \neffectuate this court ordered remedy;  \n \n  $35 per hour for work perform ed by an adm inistrative assistant that is necessary to \neffectuate this court ordered remedy;   \n \n  3\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/19/09   Page 3 of 5   Document 638\n\n  When travel to the Milwaukee area is necessary to effectuate this court ordered remedy, \ntravel expenses including, but not necessari ly limited to, actual cost of coach class \nairfare  to Milwaukee and ground transpor tation  in the Milwaukee area which m ay \ninclude either cab fare or economy rental car expenses;  \n \n  When travel to the Milwaukee area is necessary to effectuate this court ordered remedy, \na per diem rate for m eals and lodging for  days spent in the Mi lwaukee area. The per  \ndiem  rate s hall  be d etermined  in accordan ce  with  United  States  General Se rvice \nAdministration (“GSA”) Regulations; \n \n  Reimbursement for duplication costs, ECF ch arges, teleconferencing fees, postage and \ndelivery fees, and transcription services if the expense is  necessary for the independent \nmonitor to fulfill her duties.  \n \n  The independent monitor shall submit a statement to the court within five business days of \nthe end of every m onth in which she engages in  compensable activity during the period of her \nappointment. The statement shall set forth the du ties performed under this appointm ent in the \npreceding month, briefly describe the nature of the work performed, and indicate the time expended \nfor each duty. The independent m onitor shall also  retain all receipts for expenses for which she \nseeks reimbursement and upon request shall provide copies of receipts to DRW, MPS, or the court.  \nIf  MPS believes that any char ge  on the statem ent  is improper, within 10 days of the \nindependent monitor filing her statement with the court, M PS may file an objection. If the court \nbelieves a response to the objection is necessary, the court shall permit the independent monitor and \nDRW to submit their respective responses within 5 days. No reply shall be permitted absent leave of \nthe court. The court shall then issue an order resolving the objection.  \nIf no objection is filed, MPS shall have 30 days from the date the statement is filed to pay in \nfull the statement submitted by the independen t monitor. Payments shall be m ade directly to the \nindependent monitor.  \nThe independent monitor shall utilize this district’s Electronic Case Filing (“ECF”) system \nfor filing all documents such as statements or orders that this court has indicated must be filed on \nthe docket. This will ensure that all parties, including the court, shall receive prompt notice of any \n  4\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/19/09   Page 4 of 5   Document 638\n\nfilings and shall avoid the need for the execution of traditional service upon each party. Further, the \nClerk shall add the independent m onitor as a party  in this case. This shall enable the independent \nmonitor to be informed about all other filings that may occur in this case during the pendency of the \nindependent monitor’s appointment.  \nAs  a party,   when a d ocument  is electron ically  filed the independ ent  monitor  shall be \npermitted to view the document once for free. If the independent monitor fails to save the document \nduring this “free view” or wishes  to view a p reviously filed document, the independent monitor \nshall be billed at the rate of $0.08 per page. A ny such charges are processed through the Public  \nAccess to Court Electronic Records (“PACER”) syst em. Therefore, if she has not already done so, \nthe  independent m onitor  shall  register with PACER.   http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/psco/cgi-\nbin/register.pl. \nBecause the independent monitor shall be using this district’s ECF system as an independent \nmonitor and not as an attorney, the court hereby  waives the requirement that she be an attorn ey \nadmitted to practice in this district. Information about this district’s ECF system, including User \nManuals, can be found on this district’s website, http://www.wied.uscourts.gov.  \nUpon registering with PACER, the independent monitor shall contact the district’s Q uality \nControl Administrator at 414-297-3418 so that the independent monitor may be added as a party in \nthis case and the Clerk’s office may complete the independent monitor’s ECF registration.  \nSO ORDERED. \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin this 19th day of August 2009. \n \n             s/AARON E.

Posted in a location highly visible to the general public within the MPS Parent Inf ormation \nCenter; \n5.  A link to a PDF version of the class action notic e shall be posted in a prominent location on \nthe main page of MPS’ website, http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us; \n6.  MPS shall post the general class  notice in all of its locations  listed above no later than \nSeptember 1, 2009. The notice shall remain posted until January 4, 2010; \n7.  MPS shall include the general notice in all district-wide MPS publications, e.g. district-wide \nparent  newsletters,  mailed  to parents or guardians of current MPS   students between \nSeptember 14, 2009 and December 14, 2009;  \n8.  DRW shall post the general notice on its website;  \n9.

The five-page information packet may be printed double-sided.  \n3.  MPS shall identify all current and former students:  \n  2\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/19/09   Page 2 of 4   Document 639\n\na.  whose  special education evaluations o ccurred  more  than 10 days beyond the  \nstatutory deadline then in effect, between September 2000 and June 2005, without a \nvalid extension; or \nb.  who were suspended more than 10 days in any school year.  \n4.  Not later than October 16, 2009, MPS shall provide DRW a  list identifying all students \nidentified as meeting either of these criteria.  \n5.  MPS shall mail an individual class notice packet  to the last known a ddress of all students \nidentified as meeting either of these criteria, not later than October 16, 2009. \nCLAIM FORM \n1.  In addition to being m ailed with each individual class notice packet, a P DF version of the \nclaim form shall be ava ilable on MPS and DRW ’s respective websites. With respect to \nMPS’ website, http://mpsportal.milwaukee.k12.wi.us, a link to a PDF ve rsion of the class \naction notice shall be posted in a prom inent location on the m ain page of MPS’ website, \nadjacent to the general notice of class action.  \n2.  MPS shall mail a claim form to any individual requesting one by calling the Office of the \nDirector of Special Services at 414-475-8745.  \n3.

The motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal (number 09-2741) is DENIED.  The\ndistrict court’s class-certification order, its liability order following Phase II of the trial, its\norder approving DPI’s settlement, and its remedial order following Phase III of the trial is\nVACATED.  The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.\nThe above is in accordance with the decision of this court entered on this date.

We are asked in these consolidated\nappeals to review multiple procedural and substantive\norders  in  a  long-running  class-action  lawsuit  seeking\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 5 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (6 of 56)\n2 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nstructural reform of special education in the Milwaukee\npublic school district. Under the Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Act (the “IDEA” or “the Act”), 20 U.S.C.\n§§  1400  et  seq.,  the  States  receive  federal  funding  for\nthe education of disabled children on the condition that\ntheir local school districts comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the Act and provide a “free appropriate\npublic education” to all resident children with disabilities.\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A). As relevant here, local districts must\nidentify  children  with  disabilities,  determine  whether\nthese  children  require  special-education  services,  and\ndevelop  individualized  education  programs  (“IEPs”)\ntailored to each student’s specific needs. Each step in the\nprocess is highly individualized because every child is\nunique.\nIn 2001 seven students with disabilities sued the Mil-\nwaukee Public Schools (“MPS”) and the Wisconsin De-\npartment of Public Instruction (“DPI”) on behalf of them-\nselves and a class of “all school age children with dis-\nabilities  who  reside  in  the  Milwaukee  Public  School\nDistrict boundaries and who are or may be eligible for\nspecial education and related services under IDEA and\nWisconsin  law.”  The  complaint  alleged  widespread\nviolations of the IDEA touching on nearly every aspect\nof MPS’s implementation of the Act. The district court\nrejected  the  plaintiffs’  ambitious  proposed  class  but\ncertified a somewhat more modest one: students eligible\nto receive special education from MPS “who are, have\nbeen or will be” denied or delayed entry into or partic-\nipation in the IEP process. This narrower class definition\nhad the effect of focusing the case on alleged violations\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 6 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (7 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 3\nof the so-called “child find” requirements of the IDEA.\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A).\nThe district court held a bench trial and found MPS\nand DPI liable for various “systemic” IDEA violations.\nDPI then settled with the class by agreeing to order MPS\nto meet certain compliance benchmarks; the district court\napproved the settlement over MPS’s objection. On June 9,\n2009,  the  court  ordered  a  complex  remedial  scheme\nrequiring  MPS  to  set  up  a  court-monitored  system  to\nidentify disabled children who were delayed or denied\nentry  into  the  IEP  process,  implement  “hybrid”  IEP\nmeetings, and craft compensatory-education remedies.\nMPS appealed the remedial order and also challenged\nthe  district  court’s  class-certification  decision,  the\nliability order, and the approval of the DPI settlement.\nThe plaintiffs sought review of the order rejecting their\nsweeping class definition but missed the filing deadline\nfor a cross-appeal. On August 19 the district court issued\ntwo  follow-up  orders  appointing  an  independent\nmonitor  and  approving  the  class  notice.  The  plaintiffs\nappealed  from  these  orders  but  do  not  contest  either\ndecision; instead, they ask us to review the order denying\ntheir original class-certification motion.\nBoth sides moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.\nWe took the motions with the merits and now dismiss\nthe plaintiffs’ appeal. The orders from which the plain-\ntiffs appealed are not final orders; nor are they the equiva-\nlent of injunctions, so they do not qualify for immediate\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs  are  attempting  a  flagrantly  improper  procedural\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 7 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (8 of 56)\n4 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nmaneuver;  they  may  not  revive  their  untimely  appeal\nby appealing from orders they do not want reviewed.\nWe deny the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal. The June 9\nremedial order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion and may be immediately appealed under § 1292(a)(1);\nwe  have  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction  over  the\nrelated orders.\nOn the merits we vacate the class-certification order.\nLike the Title VII claims in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\n131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011), the IDEA claims in this case are\nhighly  individualized  and  vastly  diverse,  making  this\ncase unsuitable for class-action treatment under Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class itself\nis  fatally  indefinite,  the  claims  lack  the  commonality\nrequired by Rule 23(a)(2), and it’s not possible to order\nfinal injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief on a\nclass-wide basis, as required by Rule 23(b)(2). Because\nthe  class  should  not  have  been  certified,  the  liability\nand remedial orders must be vacated as well. Finally,\nDPI’s settlement with the class prejudiced MPS’s legal\nrights by requiring more of MPS than DPI had the statu-\ntory  authority  to  demand.  In  any  case,  because  the\nclass  was  certified  in  error,  the  order  approving  the\nDPI settlement must also be vacated.\nI.  Background\nA.  Legal Framework\nThe IDEA requires participating States to provide to\nall disabled students a “free appropriate public education.”\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 8 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (9 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 5\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A). Complying with this require-\nment is a complex and inherently child-specific under-\ntaking. First, the IDEA requires that “[a]ll children with\ndisabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need\nof special education and related services” be “identified,\nlocated, and evaluated,” a process known as “child find.”\nId.  §  1412(a)(3)(A).  Once  a  disabled  child  in  need  of\nspecial education is identified, the local school district\nmust  evaluate  the  child’s  specific  needs  and  develop\nan  “individualized  educational  program,”  or  “IEP,”\noutlining  the  particular  special-education  services  that\nare necessary to allow the  child to learn in the “least\nrestrictive environment.” Id. §§ 1412(a)(4)-(5), 1414. The\ncontent of an IEP and the meaning of “least restrictive\nenvironment”  are  nuanced  topics  that  we  need  not\nexplore  here.  With  limited  exceptions,  an  “IEP  Team”\nmust be convened and meet within 90 days of the child’s\ninitial referral, see WIS. STAT. § 115.78(3)(a) (1998);1 the\nIEP Team must include various educational professionals\nand  the  child’s  parent  or  guardian,  see  20  U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(B). Once an IEP is in place, the school must\nprovide the services listed in it, and the IDEA sets out\nmany rules governing the process of amending an IEP.\nThese topics, too, are beyond the scope of inquiry here.\nTo ensure that each disabled child receives a free ap-\npropriate  public  education,  the  IDEA  also  requires\nStates to provide various procedural safeguards to stu-\n1 The  statutory  time  frame  has  since  been  shortened  to\n60 days.

See id. § 1415. A parent may file a\ncomplaint  “with  respect  to  any  matter  relating  to  the\nidentification,  evaluation,  or  educational  placement  of\nthe  child,”  id.  §  1415(b)(6)(A),  and  may  request  an\nimpartial due-process hearing to resolve the complaint,\nid.  §  1415(f).  After  receiving  a  final  decision  from  the\nhearing officer, the parent may appeal to the state educa-\ntional  agency.  Id.  §  1415(g).  Finally,  a  still-aggrieved\nparent may file a civil action seeking review of the deci-\nsion. Id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also requires that parents\nbe  given  notice  of  their  procedural  rights  at  various\ntimes, including when the school district first proposes\nor  refuses  to  evaluate  a  child  for  a  disability.  Id.\n§ 1415(b)(3), (c)(1).\nWisconsin  implements  the  IDEA  through  sections\n115.758-115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes, which track the\nIDEA’s  requirements  while  adding  functional  detail.\nOne  provision  of  particular  importance  here,  section\n—\n115.90, gives DPI the state educational agency charged\n—\nwith overseeing Wisconsin’s IDEA compliance various\nenforcement mechanisms if individual schools or school\ndistricts  are  not  fulfilling  their  statutory  obligations.\nSpecifically, DPI may order a school district to submit\na “corrective plan” that addresses the area of noncom-\npliance,  withhold  state  funding  until  the  violation  is\nfixed, or if the first two methods are unsuccessful, ask\nthe state attorney general to bring a lawsuit against the\nschool district to force compliance. WIS. STAT. § 115.90.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 10 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (11 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 7\nB.  Proceedings Below\nThe  procedural  history  of  this  case  is  lengthy  and\ncomplex; we will simplify where we can. In 2001 Jamie S.\nand six other named plaintiffs brought this class-action\nsuit against MPS and DPI alleging a host of IDEA viola-\ntions. Jamie is cognitively impaired and was at that time\nan eight-year-old student in an MPS school. The other\nnamed plaintiffs are (or were) MPS students with disabili-\nties ranging from deafness to Asperger’s syndrome to\nvarious  emotional  disturbances.  The  parties  consented\nto the jurisdiction of a magistrate  judge, see 28 U.S.C.\n§  636(c)(1),  and  the plaintiffs  moved  to certify  a  class\nof  all  Milwaukee-area  students  who  “are  or  may  be\neligible for special education and related services under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law due to their disabilities.” The\nmagistrate  judge  declined  to  certify  a  class  of  this\nscope  based  largely  on  concerns  about  exhaustion  of\nadministrative  remedies.  But  the  judge  believed  that\nsome of plaintiffs’ claims could be litigated as a class\nnotwithstanding their failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.\nTo  that  end,  the  judge  divided  the  proposed  class\ninto  two  categories:  those  having  “pre-determination\nclaims” and those having “post-determination claims.”\nThese were terms of the court’s own creation and referred\nto IDEA violations arising before an IEP meeting takes\nplace  and  IDEA  violations  arising  after  an  IEP  takes\nplace. Although  the  IDEA  generally  requires  plaintiffs\nto  use  the  administrative  dispute-resolution  process\nbefore filing suit, the judge thought that exhaustion of\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 11 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (12 of 56)\n8 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nadministrative remedies for “pre-determination claims”\nwould be futile because parents of children with these\nkinds  of  claims  might  not  know  they  have  a  right  to\nadministrative  review.  For  this  reason  the  judge\nexcused,  on  a  class-wide  basis,  the  failure  to  exhaust\nadministrative  remedies  for  pre-determination  claims.\nOn the other hand, the judge thought that parents who\nhad  attended  an  IEP  meeting  would  understand  their\nright  to  administrative  review.  Accordingly,  the  judge\nheld that the administrative system is adequate for post-\ndetermination claims and declined to excuse the exhaus-\ntion requirement for this category.\nThis  approach  meant  the  plaintiffs  could  litigate\ntheir pre-determination claims as a class, but their post-\ndetermination  claims  had  to  proceed  individually  (or\nnot at all if administrative remedies had not been ex-\nhausted). Accordingly, the judge invited the plaintiffs to\ntry  again  at  class  certification  using  the  court’s  pre-\ndetermination/post-determination distinction. After two\nmore rounds of briefing, the judge settled on his own\nclass definition. On November 14, 2003, the court entered\nan order certifying the following class:\nThose students eligible for special education services\nfrom the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\nhave been or will be either denied or delayed entry\nor  participation  in  the  processes  which  result in  a\nproperly constituted meeting between the IEP team\nand the parents or guardians of the student.\nFollowing class certification and several years of dis-\ncovery, the court conducted a two-phase bench trial on\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 12 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (13 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 9\nliability.  In  Phase  I  the  court  heard  testimony  from\nexperts regarding MPS’s and DPI’s compliance with the\nIDEA. Satisfied that a full trial was warranted, the court\nconducted  lengthy  Phase  II  proceedings  in  which  the\nparties presented further evidence regarding the basis for\nthe  experts’  opinions.  In  a  written  decision  issued  on\nSeptember 11, 2007, the court found both MPS and DPI\nliable for “systemic” violations of the child-find require-\nments  of  the  IDEA.  Specifically,  the  court  found  that\nfrom September 2000 to June 2005, MPS committed the\nfollowing  IDEA  violations  on  a  system-wide  basis:  it\nfailed  to  identify  children  with  suspected  disabilities\nand refer them for evaluation within the statutory 90-\nday  time  frame;  improperly  extended  the  90-day  time\nframe;  imposed  suspensions  in  a  way  that  frustrated\ndisability  referrals;  and  failed  to  ensure  that  parents\nattended IEP meetings. The court also found that DPI\nfailed in its oversight duties.\nThe  court  based  its  liability  findings  primarily  on\nthe  opinion  testimony  of  Dr.  Diana  Rogers-Adkinson,\na  special-education  professor  at  the  University  of\nWisconsin-Whitewater  who  served  as  the  plaintiffs’\nprimary  expert.  She  reviewed  approximately  200  MPS\nstudent  files  but  engaged  in  no  statistical  analysis  or\nother accepted analytical method to determine whether\nany particular violation of the IDEA could properly be\ncharacterized  as  “systemic.”  Instead,  she  based  her\nopinion entirely on “patterns” or “trends” she observed\nin the student files. During the time period in question,\nMPS  annually  enrolled  95,000  to  97,000  students,  ap-\nproximately  16,000  of  whom  were  eligible  for  special\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 13 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (14 of 56)\n10 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\neducation  every  year.  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson  did  not\nexplain how a  review of  200 student  files could  yield\na conclusion that MPS was in systemic violation of the\nIDEA during the relevant five-year period.\nIndeed,  the  court’s  64-page  liability  order  does  not\ncontain  any  analysis  subjecting  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson’s\ntestimony to the standards applicable to expert witnesses\nunder Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. To the\ncontrary,  the  court  expressly  acknowledged  that  her\nopinion  was  not  based  on  any  scientific  method  but\ninstead rested on what she loosely termed a “qualitative\nanalysis” of the student files she reviewed. After iden-\ntifying “certain patterns” and “trends” in the student files,\nDr. Rogers-Adkinson simply “projected” the patterns and\ntrends  “over  the  entire  MPS  district”  and  said  she\n“believe[d]  .  .  .  the  same  trends  would  appear  if  a\nscientific  or  true  random  sampling  of  files  had  been\nconducted.”  Without  mentioning  the  requirements  of\nRule  702,  the  court  summarily  accepted  Dr.  Rogers-\nAdkinson’s methodology as an adequate factual founda-\ntion for finding MPS in systemic violation of the IDEA:\n“The court accepts the qualitative analysis methodology\nused  by  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson.  The  court  further\naccepts her Child Find trends or patterns and applies\nthem system wide to MPS.”\nIn response to the court’s liability order, DPI entered\ninto settlement negotiations with the plaintiff class and\neventually  presented  a  settlement  agreement  to  the\ncourt  for  approval. We  will  describe  it  in  more  detail\nlater,  but  in  brief,  DPI  agreed  to  order  MPS  to  meet\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 14 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (15 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 11\nvarious  compliance  benchmarks  within  a  certain  time\nframe and to pay for an independent monitor to oversee\nMPS’s performance. In exchange the plaintiff class dis-\nmissed its claims against DPI and gave away the rights\nof  class  members  to  bring  representative  suits  against\nDPI for IDEA violations predating the agreement. Over\nMPS’s  vigorous  objection,  the  district  court  approved\nthe settlement.\nThe case then proceeded to the remedial phase of the\ntrial  against  MPS  alone.  The  court  heard  evidence\nand argument on possible remedies, and on November 17,\n2008, ordered the parties to submit posttrial briefs re-\ngarding  their  final  remedial  proposals.  This  order\nincluded two pages of detailed questions, the answers to\nwhich  informed  the  content  of  the  parties’  final  pro-\nposals.  For  example,  the  court  directed  the  parties  to\naddress how putative members of the class were to be\nevaluated  for  inclusion  in  the  class;  how  individual\nliability  and  compensatory-education  determinations\nshould be made; which party should prevail when the\nevidence  is  inconclusive;  how  disputes  between  the\nparties should be resolved; and who should pay for the\ndispute-resolution process. The parties submitted briefs\noutlining  their  preferred  remedies  and  responded  to\neach other’s proposal.\nOn June 9, 2009, the court issued a lengthy order setting\nforth an elaborate court-monitored remedial scheme. The\ncourt  ordered  both  general  and  specific  class  notice\ndesigned  to  reach  the  parent  or  guardian  of  as  many\npotential  class  members  as  possible.  Recipients  would\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 15 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (16 of 56)\n12 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nidentify  their  children  as  potential  class  members  by\nsubmitting response forms that would initiate a process\nof professional evaluation to determine whether or not\nthe child was a member of the class. The court ordered\nthe creation of a “hybrid” IEP team, closely resembling\nthe IEP team required by the IDEA but including a court-\nappointed independent monitor to oversee its operation.\nThe hybrid IEP team was charged with evaluating the\nresponses  to  the  class  notice  to  determine  how  to\nproceed in each individual case. In some cases it might be\nobvious that the  child is not disabled, and no further\nevaluation would be required. In others a professional\nevaluation would be required to determine whether the\nchild  has  a  disability.  In  others  a  full  IEP  meeting\nwould be needed to determine whether the child requires\nspecial-education services in order to receive a free ap-\npropriate public education. And finally, in some cases\n—\nthe child might be entitled to compensatory education\n—\na remedy available under the IDEA to compensate for\na  past  denial  of  a  free  appropriate  public  education.\nThe hybrid IEP team was given the authority to grant\ncompensatory-education  awards,  subject  to  the  court’s\noversight. The estimated cost to MPS to implement this\nremedy: between $11.5 and $40 million, depending on\nhow many parents responded and the extent of the com-\npensatory education awarded to qualifying children.\nThe June 9 remedial order also rejected some of the\nremedial proposals made by the parties. For example, the\njudge  rejected  the  plaintiffs’  request  for  a  segregated\ncompensatory-education fund and for “parent advocates”\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 16 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (17 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 13\nseparate  from  the  independent  monitor  and  denied\nMPS’s  request  for  a  binding-arbitration  system  to\nresolve disputes. Finally, the court ordered the parties to\nnegotiate  regarding  the  independent  monitor  and  the\nform  of  the  class  notice.  If  they  could  not  agree,  the\nparties were to submit nominations for the independent\nmonitor and a proposed class-notice form.\nMPS  appealed  the  June  9  remedial  order  and  also\nsought review of the court’s class-certification decision,\nthe liability order, and the court’s order approving the\nDPI  settlement.  The  plaintiffs  sought  review  of  the\ndistrict court’s rejection of their original class definition\nbut missed the deadline for filing a cross-appeal. In the\nmeantime the parties could not agree on an independent\nmonitor or class-notice form, so they submitted competing\nproposals on these two follow-on matters.\nOn August 19, 2009, the court entered an order naming\nthe  independent  monitor  and  charging  her  with  the\nresponsibility of “implement[ing] the remedy set forth\nwithin” the June 9 order. This brief order also summarizes\nthe independent monitor’s duties, explains how she is to\nbe paid, and provides some detail about how she would\ninteract with the parties and the court. In a second order\nissued  on  August  19,  the  court  approved  the  class-\nnotice form and explained how it should be distributed.\nThe plaintiffs appealed the August 19 orders, but they\nhave no quarrel with the substance of these decisions. That\nis, they do not disagree with the judge’s choice of an\nindependent  monitor  or  the  form  of  the  class  notice.\nInstead, they ask us to review the denial of their original\nclass-certification motion.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 17 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (18 of 56)\n14 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nBoth  sides  moved  to  dismiss  the  other’s  appeal  for\nlack of jurisdiction. MPS also moved to stay the June 9\nremedial  order  pending  resolution  of  its  appeal.  We\nconsolidated the cases, stayed the remedial order, and\nasked  the  parties  to  brief  the  jurisdictional  questions\nalong with the merits.\nII.  Discussion\nThese consolidated appeals raise important procedural\nand substantive issues regarding the suitability of IDEA\nclaims  for  class  certification,  the  kind  and  degree  of\nevidence necessary to find a local school district in sys-\ntemic violation of the IDEA, and the propriety of a federal-\ncourt  takeover  of  a  school  district’s  special-education\nprogram  as  a  remedy  for  individual  IDEA  violations.\nWe begin, however, with jurisdictional issues.\nA.  Jurisdiction\nBoth  appeals  claim  appellate  jurisdiction  under  28\nU.S.C.  §  1292(a)(1),  which  permits  immediate  appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order “granting, continuing, modi-\nfying,  refusing  or  dissolving”  an  injunction.  Section\n1292(a)(1) “creates an exception from the long-established\npolicy against piecemeal appeals,” but “[t]he exception is\na  narrow  one  and  is  keyed  to  the  ‘need  to  permit\nlitigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of\nserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’” Gardner v.\nWestinghouse Broad. Co., 437 U.S. 478, 480 (1978) (quoting\nBalt.  Contractors  v.  Bodinger,  348  U.S.  176,  181  (1955)).\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 18 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (19 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 15\nAccordingly,  mandatory  interlocutory  orders  are  con-\nsidered injunctions reviewable under § 1292(a)(1) “only\nif they effectively grant or withhold the relief sought on\nthe merits and affect one party’s ability to obtain such\nrelief in a way that cannot be rectified by a later appeal\n(that is, ‘irreparably’).” In re City of Springfield, Ill., 818 F.2d\n565, 567 (7th Cir. 1987) (citing Stringfellow v. Concerned\nNeighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 377-79 (1987), and Carson\nv. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981)). Stated differ-\nently,  “[a]n  order  .  .  .  is  properly  characterized  as  an\n‘injunction’  when  it  substantially  and  obviously  alters\nthe  parties’  pre-existing  legal  relationship.”  Jones-El  v.\nBerge, 374 F.3d 541, 544 (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Gautreaux\nv. Chi. Hous. Auth., 178 F.3d 951, 958 (7th Cir. 1999)).\nThe  parties  agree  that  by  ordering  the  creation  of\nthe  hybrid  IEP  system,  the  district  court  granted  an\ninjunction within the meaning of § 1292(a)(1), but they\ndisagree  about  which  order  achieved that  result.  MPS\nappealed from the June 9 remedial order and contends\nthat this order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion. The plaintiffs argue that MPS’s appeal was prema-\nture. They maintain that the remedial order did not fully\n“ripen” into an appealable injunction until the district\ncourt appointed the independent monitor and approved\nthe class notice on August 19.\nThe plaintiffs direct our attention to Sherpell v. Humnoke\nSchool District No. 5, 814 F.2d 538, 539-40 (8th Cir. 1987),\nand Groseclose v. Dutton, 788 F.2d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 1986),\nboth  of  which  held  that  an  order  requiring  parties  to\nsubmit  proposed  remedial  plans  is  generally  not  an\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 19 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (20 of 56)\n16 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ninjunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). In our decision\nin  Springfield,  we  agreed  with  that  general  principle:\n“[O]nly directives awarding the relief plaintiffs seek or\nputting the case on a collision course with that relief are\n‘injunctions’  under  §  1292(a)(1).”  818  F.2d  at  568.  The\nplaintiffs  insist  that  the  June  9  order  was  merely  an\norder  to  formulate  proposals  for  the  independent\nmonitor and class notice and that it was only after the\nAugust 19 orders appointing the monitor and approving\nthe  class  notice  that  the  hybrid  IEP  system  was  truly\nin place.\nThis characterization of the June 9 order is disingen-\nuous.  It’s  true  that  the  court  directed  the  parties\nto consult with each other about the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the form of the class notice, and\nto submit proposals if they could not agree. But the bulk\nof the court’s 71-page order was devoted to evaluating\nthe comprehensive remedial proposals the parties had\nalready submitted and explaining the elaborate remedial\nscheme the court had crafted. The order established in\nfine detail the remedial program MPS was required to\n—\nimplement a  scheme  designed  to  produce  indi-\nvidualized  compensatory-education  awards,  the  ulti-\nmate relief sought in the case.\nAlthough the June 9 order left the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the content of the class notice to\nbe worked out by the parties, MPS’s obligations were\nnot contingent on those details. Whoever the monitor, and\nwhatever the form of the class notice, the June 9 order\nrequired  MPS  to  create  a  massive  identification  and\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 20 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (21 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 17\nevaluation  system  consuming  significant  educational\nresources  and  costing  millions  of  dollars.  Even  if  the\nhybrid IEP system could not begin operating until the\nindependent  monitor  was  appointed  and  the  class\nnotice was approved, the June 9 order gave the plaintiffs\nthe  relief  they  were  seeking  and  substantially  altered\nMPS’s legal rights. The remedial order is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). See\nSpringfield,  818  F.2d  at  568.  We  have  jurisdiction  over\nMPS’s appeal; the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss is denied.\nIn  contrast,  the  plaintiffs’  jurisdictional  argument  in\nsupport of their own appeal is at best inconsistent and at\nworst incoherent. The plaintiffs initially tried to cross-\nappeal from the June 9 remedial order, seeking review\nof  the  denial  of  their  original  class-certification  mo-\ntion. But they missed the filing deadline, so they tried a\ndifferent  route  to  get  their  preferred  class  definition\nbefore this court: They appealed the August 19 orders\nappointing  the  independent  monitor  and  approving\nthe class notice, insisting that these orders are the “injunc-\ntion” for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). They are not. Unlike\nthe June 9 order, the August 19 orders do not grant relief\non  the  merits  or  substantively  alter  the  parties’  legal\nrelationship.  See  Jones-El,  374  F.3d  at  544;  Springfield,\n818 F.2d at 567. They do not require the parties to do\nor  refrain  from  doing  anything  at  all.  The  district\ncourt  had  already  announced  the  remedial  scheme  in\nthe June 9 order, including the appointment of an inde-\npendent  monitor  and  the  requirement  of  general  and\nspecific class notice. All that remained was to decide the\nidentity  of  the  monitor  and  approve  the  form  of  the\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 21 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (22 of 56)\n18 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nclass  notice.  These  details  were  surely  important,  but\nresolving them did not amount to an appealable injunc-\ntion.  Cf.  Jones-El,  374  F.3d  at  544  (“[A]n  unappealable\norder is one that interprets or clarifies a prior order and\ndoes not create new rights or obligations independently\nenforceable through a contempt action.”).\nMoreover, the plaintiffs are plainly engaged in a boot-\nstrapping  procedural  maneuver.  They  have  no  com-\nplaint about the independent monitor or the class notice,\nthough they appealed those decisions; rather, they want\nus to review the denial of their original class-certifica-\ntion  motion.  This  is  an  improper  attempt  to  revive\ntheir  untimely  cross-appeal  from  the  June  9  remedial\norder. We dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal.\nFinally, MPS seeks review of the district court’s orders\ncertifying  the  class,  finding  liability,  and  approving\nDPI’s  settlement. Ordinarily  these  interlocutory  orders\nwould be unappealable, but MPS argues that the doc-\ntrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction applies. In Swint\nv. Chambers County Commission, 514  U.S. 35,  51  (1995),\nthe Supreme Court ”‘set out a general rule against exer-\ncising  pendent  jurisdiction  over  related  rulings.’”\nMcKinney v. Duplain, 463 F.3d 679, 692 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Watkins v. City of Oakland, Cal., 145 F.3d 1087, 1092\n(9th Cir. 1998)). Pendent appellate jurisdiction “may be\ninvoked  ‘only  if  there  are  compelling  reasons  for  not\ndeferring the appeal of the former order to the end of the\nlawsuit.’ ” Montano v. City of Chicago, 375 F.3d 593, 599\n(7th Cir. 2004) (quoting U.S. for Use of Valders Stone &\nMarble, Inc. v. C-Way Constr. Co., 909 F.2d 259, 262 (7th\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 22 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (23 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 19\nCir. 1990)). We may “review an otherwise unappealable\ninterlocutory  order  if  it  is  ‘inextricably  intertwined\nwith  an  appealable  one.’”  Research  Automation,  Inc.  v.\nSchrader-Bridgeport  Int’l,  Inc.,  626  F.3d  973,  977  (7th\nCir. 2010) (quoting Montano, 375 F.3d at 599). In other\nwords,  ”‘it  must  be  practically  indispensable  that  we\naddress the merits of the unappealable order in order to\nresolve the properly-taken appeal.’” Montano, 375 F.3d\nat 600 (quoting Valders Stone & Marble, 909 F.2d at 262).\nIf an otherwise unappealable order is sufficiently inter-\ntwined  to  permit  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction,  we\nmay exercise our discretion to review it. Jones v. InfoCure\nCorp., 310 F.3d 529, 536-37 (7th Cir. 2002).\nThe decision to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction\nis inherently case specific. See Montano, 375 F.3d at 600.\n—\nHere, our review of the appealable order the June 9 order\n—\nimposing the remedial scheme simply cannot be con-\nducted in isolation from the earlier orders. The June 9\norder  imposes  a  remedy  for  MPS’s  liability  to  the\nplaintiff class; deferring review of the class-certification\nand liability decisions until after final judgment would\nmake our present review of the remedial scheme mean-\ningless. As this case comes to us, it is “practically indis-\npensable”  that  we  review  the  class-certification  and\nliability orders now “in order to resolve the properly-\ntaken appeal.” Id.; see also Asset Allocation & Mgmt. Co. v.\nW.  Emp’rs  Ins.  Co.,  892  F.2d  566,  569  (7th  Cir.  1989)\n(“[A]ny ruling on which the validity of the [appealable\norder] turns is reviewable . . . .”).\nThe court’s order approving DPI’s settlement presents\na closer question, but viewing the case as a whole, we\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 23 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (24 of 56)\n20 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthink this order is so closely linked with the others that\nit cannot be separated. Because we vacate the class certifi-\ncation,  declining  to  exercise  pendent  jurisdiction  over\nthe order approving DPI’s settlement would create the\nstrangely  anomalous  result  of  a  free-standing  district\ncourt  order  approving  and  incorporating  a  settlement\nbetween a defendant and a class that no longer exists.\nFurthermore,  with  essentially  the  entire  case  already\nbefore us, deferring appellate review of the settlement\nwould create rather than prevent piecemeal appeals; this\ntoo  favors  pendent  appellate  review.  See  Greenwell  v.\nAztar Ind. Gaming Corp., 268 F.3d 486, 491 (7th Cir. 2001).\nB.  Class Certification\n“The  class  action  is  ‘an  exception  to  the  usual  rule\nthat litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the indi-\nvidual  named  parties  only.’”  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  v.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011) (quoting Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979)). A district court\nmay certify a case for class-action treatment only if it\nsatisfies the four requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\n—\nProcedure  23(a) numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,\n—\nand adequacy of representation and one of the condi-\ntions of Rule 23(b). See FED. R. CIV. P. 23. In addition, a\nclass  must  be  sufficiently  definite  that  its  members\nare ascertainable. Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506,\n513 (7th Cir. 2006); see Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 669\n(7th Cir. 1981) (“It is axiomatic that for a  class action\nto be certified a ‘class’ must exist.”).\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 24 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (25 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 21\nClass  certification  is  appropriate  only  if,  “after  a\nrigorous  analysis,”  the  trial  court  is  satisfied  that  the\nrequirements of Rule 23 have been met. Wal-Mart, 131\nS.  Ct.  at  2551  (quotation  marks  omitted).  “Frequently,\nthat ‘rigorous analysis’ will entail some overlap with the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim. That cannot be\nhelped.” Id.; see also Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 634 F.3d 883, 890 n.6 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Szabo v.\nBridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2001)).\nWe  review  the  district  court’s  class-certification  order\nfor abuse of discretion, but legal determinations made\nin support of the decision are reviewed de novo. Andrews\nv. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 573 (7th Cir. 2008).\nThere are several basic flaws in the district court’s class-\ncertification decision. First, the class is both fatally indefi-\nnite and lacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2).\nFurthermore, although the case was certified as a class\naction  for  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  under\nRule  23(b)(2),  final  injunctive  or  corresponding  de-\nclaratory relief cannot be ordered on a class-wide basis,\nas required for a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\nWe begin with the terms of the class definition, some-\nthing  over  which  the  parties  and  the  judge  struggled\nmightily.  The  plaintiffs  initially  sought  to  represent  a\nclass  so  broad  that  it  effectively  included  all  students\neligible for special education and related services from\nMPS. The original proposed class thus joined together\nall  Milwaukee-area  disabled  students,  regardless  of\ndifferences in their disabilities or educational situations,\nwhose procedural or substantive rights under the IDEA\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 25 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (26 of 56)\n22 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nwere  violated  in  any  way.  The  district  court  properly\nrejected this sweeping class definition, but not for the\nobvious reason that it sought to lump together thousands\nof  disparate  plaintiffs  with  widely  varying  individual\nclaims. Rather, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed\nclass definition based on difficulties associated with the\nIDEA’s  requirement  that  administrative  remedies  be\nexhausted before filing suit.\nThe district court was justifiably concerned about the\nadministrative-exhaustion  requirement.  But  the  court’s\neffort to resolve the problem was misguided. The court\nsua sponte divided the class into two categories: those\nwith “pre-determination claims” and those with “post-\ndetermination  claims.”  These  designations  were  ap-\nparently meant to categorize individual violations of the\nIDEA,  separating  those  that  occurred  prior  to  an  IEP\nmeeting from those that occurred after an IEP meeting.\nThe judge thought this categorization made it possible\nto  excuse  the  exhaustion  requirement  for  “pre-deter-\nmination claims” and allow these  alleged IDEA viola-\ntions  to  be  litigated  on  a  class-wide  basis,  while\nenforcing the exhaustion requirement for “post-determina-\ntion claims,” excluding them from class-action treatment.\nThere is reason to doubt the propriety of this approach,\nbut for present purposes we will address it on its own\nterms.  Ordinarily,  a  plaintiff  may  not  file  an  IDEA\nlawsuit without first exhausting available administrative\nremedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415; Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305,\n326-27 (1988); Charlie F. v. Bd. of Educ. of Skokie Sch. Dist. 68,\n98 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996).

The district court\napplied  this  exception  to all  pre-determination  claims,\nreasoning  that  the  parents  of  disabled  students  might\nnot  be  fully  aware  of  the  right  to  administrative\nremedies prior to a properly constructed IEP meeting,\nmaking exhaustion an exercise in futility.2 Once an IEP\nmeeting  is  convened,  however,  the court  thought  that\n2 We  question  this  reasoning.  Wisconsin  law  requires  that\nparents be notified of their administrative-review rights when\na child is initially referred for evaluation, well before an IEP\nmeeting  occurs.  WIS.  STAT.  §  115.792(1)(b).  For  this  reason\nthe  defendants  argued  below  that  if  exhaustion  was  to  be\nexcused on a class-wide basis for violations occurring before\nparents  received  notice  of  their  right  to  administrative\nremedies,  it  should  be  excused  for  pre-referral  claims  only.\nThe  district  court  rejected  this  argument,  perceiving  “too\ngreat” a “potential of having parties unwittingly forgo their\nrights.”  Even  when  notice  of  administrative  remedies  was\nprovided, the judge was “not sanguine with the fact that this\ninformation is always properly delivered or that the parents\nhave a full understanding of the information.” Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it was appropriate to waive the\nexhaustion requirement on a class-wide basis on the rationale\nthat parents “lacked full understanding” of their rights. The\nplaintiffs,  as  the  proponents  of  the  futility  exception  to\nthe exhaustion requirement, would bear the burden of estab-\nlishing this lack of understanding. See Polera v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Newburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 488 n.8 (2d\nCir. 2002). That burden is not satisfied by the district court’s\nunsupported  intuition  that  notice  might  not  always  be\n“properly delivered” or that parents might not always under-\nstand it.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 27 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (28 of 56)\n24 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nparents  would  sufficiently  understand  their  rights,\nmaking  administrative  review  adequate  and  keeping\nthe IDEA’s exhaustion requirement intact for post-determi-\nnation  claims.  On this rationale the  court was  willing\nto certify a class defined to include only pre-determina-\ntion claims, for which it excused the plaintiffs’ failure\nto exhaust administrative remedies.3\n3 In  settling  on  the  pre-determination/post-determination\nline of demarcation, the district court relied heavily on the\nconcept of  “systemic”  IDEA  violations  developed  by  other\ncircuits,  most  prominently  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  Doe  ex  rel.\nBrockhuis v. Arizona Department of Education, 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th Cir. 1997). Doe discussed the distinction between “systemic”\nand “nonsystemic” IDEA claims in the context of deciding\nwhether to apply the futility exception to excuse the plaintiffs’\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a\nclass-action suit. Here, however, the district court applied the\nNinth Circuit’s definition of a “systemic” IDEA violation in\ndetermining MPS’s liability, using it as the substantive legal\nstandard for evaluating whether MPS was in noncompliance\nwith  the  IDEA  system-wide.  We  question  whether  Doe’s\ndefinition of “systemic” IDEA noncompliance has any value\noutside  its  specific  context—that  is,  outside  the  context  of\ndeciding as a threshold matter in a proposed IDEA class action\nwhether to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies. And even in that context, the line drawn in Doe between\nsystemic  and  nonsystemic  violations  for  purposes  of  the\nexhaustion requirement seems rather arbitrary. While some\nIDEA  violations  may  implicate  the  structure  of  a  school\ndistrict’s  special-education  program  and  may  not  be\nremediable through ordinary administrative review, it does\nnot necessarily follow that administrative review is futile or\n(continued...)\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 28 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (29 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 25\nThe court thus certified a class of its own creation:\nThose students eligible for special education services\nfrom the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\nhave been or will be either denied or delayed entry\nor  participation  in  the  processes  which  result in  a\nproperly constituted meeting between the IEP team\nand the parents or guardians of the student.\nIn other words, the certified class combined all disabled\nstudents  eligible  for  special  education  from  MPS  who\nwere not identified as potentially eligible for services, not\ntimely  referred  for  evaluation  after  identification,  not\ntimely  evaluated  after  referral,  not  evaluated  in  a\nproperly constituted IEP meeting, or whose parents did\nnot  (for  whatever  reason)  attend  an  otherwise  proper\nIEP  meeting.

A  significant  segment  of  the  class  (of\nunknown  and  unknowable  size)  comprises  disabled\nstudents who may have been eligible for special education\n3 (...continued)\ninadequate for all violations that are alleged to be “systemic.”\nHowever, because our decision rests on other flaws in the class-\ncertification decision and does not reach the substance of the\ncourt’s  liability  decision,  we  neither  accept  nor  reject  the\nNinth Circuit’s reasoning in Doe.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 29 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (30 of 56)\n26 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nbut were not identified and remain unidentified. There is\nno question that MPS has a legal obligation under the\nIDEA to seek out disabled students and refer for evalua-\ntion  those  it  reasonably  believes  are  disabled  and  in\nneed of special education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A);\nWIS.  STAT.  §  115.77(1m)(a).  The  failure  to  properly\nidentify a disabled student can itself be a violation of\nthe IDEA if the failure results in the denial of a free ap-\npropriate public education to a qualifying child with a\ndisability. Cf. Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129 S. Ct. 2484,\n2495  (2009)  (“A  reading  of  the  Act  that  left  parents\nwithout  an  adequate  remedy  when  a  school  district\nunreasonably failed to identify a child with disabilities\nwould not comport with Congress’ acknowledgment of\nthe paramount importance of properly identifying each\nchild eligible for services.”). The problem with a class\nof  potentially  eligible  but  unidentified  students  is  not\nthat  their  rights  might  not  been  violated  but  that  the\nrelevant  criteria  for  class  membership  are  unknown.\nBy what standard is class membership to be determined?\nHow is the court to decide whether there was reason\nto believe in 2000-2005 that a presently unidentified child\nwas  potentially  eligible  for  special-education  services\nfrom MPS? It’s not hard to see how this class lacks the\ndefiniteness required for class certification; there is no\nway to know or readily ascertain who is a member of the\nclass.4 See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513; Simer, 661 F.2d at 669.\n4 Typical  suits  for  child-find-violations  focus  on  a  school\ndistrict’s failure to timely identify a qualifying disability in an\nidentified student, e.g., Richard S. v.

Dist., 334\n(continued...)\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 30 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (31 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 27\nOf course, unidentified but potentially eligible disabled\nstudents  are  defined  not  only  by  having  not  been\nidentified but also by having a disability. If we could\neasily identify all Milwaukee students with disabilities\nduring the relevant time period, perhaps we could cross-\ncheck that list against a list of known disabled students\nto determine which students MPS failed to identify and\nrefer  for  an  IEP  evaluation.  But  identifying  disabled\nstudents  who  might  be  eligible  for  special-education\nservices  is  a  complex,  highly  individualized  task,  and\ncannot be reduced to the application of a set of simple,\nobjective  criteria.  Every  step  of  the  child-find  inquiry\nand IEP process under the IDEA is child specific and\nrequires  the  application  of  trained  and  particularized\nprofessional educational judgment. In short, a class of\nunidentified but potentially IDEA-eligible disabled stu-\ndents is inherently too indefinite to be certified.\nThis  conclusion  draws  support  from  Adashunas  v.\nNegley,  626  F.2d  600  (7th  Cir.  1980).  The  plaintiffs  in\nAdashunas  alleged  widespread  violations  of  the  child-\nfind  requirements  in  the  IDEA’s  predecessor  statute\nand proposed a class consisting of “all children within\n4 (...continued)\nF.

In both\nsituations  the  identity  of  the  student  is  known.  The  class\nhere  includes  all  students  not  properly  identified  as\npotentially eligible for special education, the vast majority of\nwhom are not individually known.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 31 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (32 of 56)\n28 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthe  State  of  Indiana  entitled  to  a  public  education\nwho  have  learning  disabilities  who  are  not  properly\nidentified  and/or  who  are  not  receiving  such  special\ninstruction as to guarantee them of minimally adequate\neducation.” Id. at 601. We noted the practical difficulty\nin  defining  the  class  in  this  way:  “How  does  one\nidentify class members consisting of persons not identi-\nfied?” Id. at 603. In theory such a class might make sense\nif  the  process  of  identifying  unknown  class  members\nwas relatively simple. But because the task of identifying\nlearning-disabled children is a “long, arduous process,”\nand  the  proposed  class  of  plaintiffs  was  “so  highly\ndiverse  and  so  difficult to  identify,” we  held  that the\nclass was “not adequately defined or nearly ascertain-\nable” and the class action could not be maintained. Id. at\n603-04  (citing  DeBremaecker  v.  Short,  433  F.2d  733,  734\n(5th Cir. 1970)). The same is true here.\nThe plaintiffs insist that because the class is defined\n—\nby reference to MPS’s illegal actions that is, by MPS’s\n—\nfailure to comply with the IDEA the defect of indefinite-\nness  may  be  forgiven.  For  this  principle  they  rely  on\nAlliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 977-\n78 (7th Cir. 1977), in which we upheld the certification\nof two plaintiff classes consisting of organizations and\npersons  in  Chicago  who  had  been  unconstitutionally\nmonitored  and  harassed  by  various  municipal  and\nfederal  defendants  in  retaliation  for  exercising  their\nFirst  Amendment  rights.

We  concluded  that  “a\nclass  that  satisfies  all  of  the  other  requirements  of\nRule 23 will not be rejected as indefinite when its con-\ntours are defined by the defendants’ own conduct.” Id.\nat 978.\nRochford’s tolerance of a wildly indefinite class defini-\ntion  under  Rule  23  is  no  longer  the  norm.  We  have\nnoted  that  “[Rochford]  is  a  relic  of  a  time  when  the\nfederal  judiciary  thought  that  structural  injunctions\ntaking control of executive functions were sensible. That\ntime is past.” Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 626 (7th\nCir.  2008).  Moreover,  the  class  certified  in  Rochford  is\ndifferent from the one here in at least two critical respects.\nFirst,  for  reasons  we  will  explain  in  a  moment,  class\ncertification  in  this  case  does  not  comply  with  other\nrequirements of Rule 23; more specifically, the class does\nnot  satisfy  Rule  23(a)(2)’s  commonality  requirement,\nand it does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2). Second, the defen-\ndants’ actions in Rochford provided at least some means\nof  identifying  class  members:  Each  class  member  was\nthe victim of some discrete act of harassment that once\n— —\nrevealed for  example,  through  discovery would  in\nturn reveal the identity of the victimized class member.\nNot so with the present class. MPS’s alleged failure to\nidentify  disabled  students  in  no  way  pins  down  the\nidentities  of  the  class  members;  the  relevant  conduct\nhere is not a discrete action as in Rochford but rather a\nfailure to act. The liability and remedial orders are power-\nful  evidence  of  this  difference;  the  elaborate  scheme\nfor identifying class members via a hybrid IEP process\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 33 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (34 of 56)\n30 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ndramatically  illustrates  the  fatal  indefiniteness  of  this\nclass. Rochford is no help to the plaintiffs here.5\nBeyond its inherent indefiniteness, the class certified\nhere fails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality prereq-\nuisite,  which  requires  that  the  class  claims  involve\n“questions of law or fact common to the class.” FED. R. CIV.\nP. 23(a)(2). It’s true that ” ‘[e]ven a single [common] ques-\ntion’  will  do.”  Wal-Mart,  131  S.  Ct.  at  2556  (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the\nStructure of the Class Action, 103 COLUM. L. REV. 149, 176,\nn.110  (2003))  (alteration  in  original).  But  the  Supreme\nCourt  explained  in  Wal-Mart  that  superficial  common\n—\nquestions like whether each class member is an MPS\nstudent or whether each class member “suffered a viola-\n—\ntion of the same provision of law” are not enough. Id. at\n2551.  Rather,  “[c]ommonality  requires  the  plaintiffs  to\ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the\nsame injury.’” Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)). The class “claims must depend\nupon a common contention,” and “[t]hat common con-\ntention,  moreover,  must  be  of  such  a  nature  that  it\n—\nis  capable  of  classwide  resolution which  means  that\ndetermination  of  its  truth  or  falsity  will  resolve  an\nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.” Id.\n5 Our conclusion that a class of child-find claims does not fit\nwithin Rochford’s carve-out is reinforced by the fact that we\ndecided  Adashunas  less  than  three  years  after  Rochford  but\ndid not even cite it.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 34 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (35 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 31\nThe  plaintiffs  identify  the  following  common  issue:\n“[A]ll potential class members have suffered as a result\nof MPS’ failure to ensure their Child Find rights under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law.” This completely misunder-\nstands Rule 23(a)(2). Whether MPS failed in its obliga-\ntions under the IDEA and thereby deprived an eligible\ndisabled child of a free appropriate public education is\nthe bottom-line liability question in any individual plain-\ntiff’s  IDEA  claim.  To  bring  individual  IDEA  claims\ntogether to litigate as a class, the plaintiffs must show\nthat they share some question of law or fact that can be\nanswered  all  at  once  and  that  the  single  answer  to\nthat question will resolve a central issue in all class mem-\nbers’ claims. That all the class members have “suffered”\nas a result of disparate individual IDEA child-find viola-\ntions  is  not  enough;  it  does  not  establish  that  the\nindividual claims have any question of law or fact in com-\nmon. The plaintiffs have identified no common factual\nor legal question that satisfies the Rule 23(a)(2) standard,\nand it is their burden to do so. See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.\nTo illustrate the commonality problem in the certified\nclass,  consider  two  hypothetical  students  within  the\nclass:  one  has  a  disability  and  would  be  eligible  for\nspecial education but has never been identified as being\ndisabled  nor  gone  through  the  IEP  process;  another\nwas  identified  as  disabled  and  received  a  timely  IEP\nmeeting, but the child’s parents did not attend the IEP\nmeeting and were not notified of their right to do so. Both\nscenarios  involve  violations  of  the  IDEA,  but  what\ncommon  question  can  be  answered  that  would  assist\nthe court in determining MPS’s liability for each? On the\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 35 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (36 of 56)\n32 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nplaintiffs’  theory,  that  question  is  something  like  this:\nDid MPS fulfill its IDEA obligations to each child? But\nwhile that generic question is surely a part of both chil-\ndren’s claims, it must be answered separately for each\nchild based on individualized questions of fact and law,\nand  the  answers  are  unique  to  each  child’s  particular\nsituation.\nThis was the basic commonality problem in Wal-Mart,\nwhich  involved  a  nationwide  class-action  suit  on\nbehalf  of  female  employees  of  the  discount  retailer\nfor alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.\nThe  Supreme  Court  summarized  the  lack  of  com-\nmonality in this way:\nIn  this  case,  proof  of  commonality  necessarily\noverlaps with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-\nMart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimina-\ntion. That is so because, in resolving an individual’s\nTitle VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the reason\nfor a particular employment decision . . . . Here respon-\ndents wish to sue about literally millions of employ-\nment decisions at once. Without some glue holding\nthe alleged reasons for all those decisions together,\nit will be impossible to say that examination of all\nthe class members’ claims for relief will produce a\ncommon  answer  to  the  crucial  question  why  was\nI disfavored.\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations  omitted).  Here,  too,  resolving  any  individual\nclass member’s claim for relief under the IDEA requires\nan  inherently  particularized  inquiry  into  the  cir-\ncumstances of the child’s case.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 36 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (37 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 33\nThat the court narrowed its focus to child-find viola-\ntions (what the court called “pre-determination claims”)\nis not enough. Child-find inquiries, like other aspects of\nthe IDEA, are necessarily child specific. There is no such\nthing as a “systemic” failure to find and refer individual\n—\ndisabled children for IEP evaluation except perhaps if\nthere was “significant proof” that MPS operated under\nchild-find policies that violated the IDEA. See id. at 2553.\nAs  the  Supreme  Court  noted  in  Wal-Mart,  an  illegal\npolicy  might  provide  the  “glue”  necessary  to  litigate\notherwise highly individualized claims as a class. Id. at\n2552-54. But again, as in Wal-Mart, proof of an illegal\npolicy “is entirely absent here.” Id. at 2553; see also J.B. ex\nrel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1289 (10th Cir. 1999)\n(affirming  the  denial  of  class  certification  because  the\n“plaintiffs merely attempt to broadly conflate a variety\nof  claims  [under  the  IDEA  and  other  statutes]  to\nestablish  commonality  via  an  allegation  of  ‘systematic\nfailures’”).  Lacking  any  common  questions,  the  class\nfails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) and should not have been\ncertified.\nFinally,  it  should  be  clear  from  our  discussion  thus\nfar  that  the  district  court  also  erred  when  it  certified\nan  injunction  class  under  Rule  23(b)(2).  Rule  23(b)(2)\npermits the court to certify a case for class-action treat-\nment if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so\nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” FED.\nR.

In\nother words, “claims for individualized relief . . . do not\nsatisfy [Rule 23(b)(2)].” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. To\nthe contrary, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single\ninjunction  or  declaratory  judgment  would  provide\nrelief to each member of the class. It does not authorize\nclass  certification  when  each  individual  class  member\nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory\njudgment against the defendant.” Id.\nThat  the  plaintiffs  have  superficially  structured\ntheir case around a claim for class-wide injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a\nsubstantive  matter  the  relief  sought  would  merely\ninitiate a process through which highly individualized\ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made;  this\nkind  of  relief  would  be  class-wide in  name  only,  and\nit would certainly not be final.

That  much  is  clear  from  the\nintricate remedial scheme ordered by the district court,\nwhich requires thousands of individual determinations\nof class membership, liability, and appropriate remedies.\nWhile the compensatory-education remedies will often\nor  always  be  injunctive  in  nature,  there  can  be  no\nsingle  injunction  that  provides  final  relief  to  the class\nas a whole. It is no answer to say that the June 9 remedial\norder  affects  the entire  class;  that  order  merely  estab-\nlishes a system for eventually providing individualized\nrelief. It does not, on its own, provide “final” relief to\nany class member. See Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. More-\nover, the remedial order requires class notice as a neces-\nsary element of its operation: Only those class members\nwho  respond  are  to  be  evaluated  within  the  hybrid\nIEP  system;  nonresponders  are  unaffected.  That  the\nputative class members must opt in after notice and then\n—\nbe evaluated for membership in the class before making\n—\na  claim  for  entitlement  to  compensatory  education\nbelies the notion that the court can provide final injunc-\ntive relief to the class as a whole. This is not the stuff of\na proper Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n6 Our discussion of commonality makes it clear that the present\nclass  does  not  satisfy  Rule  23(b)(3). Without  even  a  single\ncommon question of law or fact, common questions cannot\npredominate. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 39 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (40 of 56)\n36 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nSo  the  class-certification  order  must  be  vacated.  It\nfollows that without a class to whom MPS can be liable\nand provide a remedy, the liability and remedial orders\nmust be vacated as well. What remains are the claims of\nthe individual plaintiffs; the district court did not find\na denial of a free appropriate public education in any\nindividual  case.7  Furthermore,  the  court’s  reasons  for\nexcusing  administrative  exhaustion  appear  to  have\nbeen  tied  to  the  class  allegations,  and  it’s  not  clear\nwhether the court would have excused exhaustion for\n—\nany of the individual claims. Finally, it’s possible perhaps\n—\nlikely that  some  of  the  named  plaintiffs’  individual\nfactual  circumstances  have  changed  such  that  their\nclaims are now moot. We leave to the district court on\nremand  the  task  of  determining  whether  anything\nremains  of  this  case  and  what,  if  anything,  should\nhappen next.\nC.  DPI Settlement\nFinally, we turn to DPI’s settlement with the plaintiff\nclass. A district court may approve a class settlement if\nit  is  “fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate.”  FED.  R.  CIV.

We review an order approving a class settlement\n7 As stated in the remedial order: “[A]t no point did the court\nreceive  specific  evidence  from  educational  professionals\nwho engaged in an individualized assessment of the named\nplaintiffs, determined the nature of any denial of [a free appro-\npriate public education], and determined precisely what sorts\nof services were necessary . . . .”\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 40 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (41 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 37\nfor an abuse of discretion. Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., 450\nF.3d  745,  748  (7th  Cir.  2006).  As  with  any  order\nreviewed under this standard, if the district court’s analy-\nsis  turned  on  an  error  of  law,  the  court  necessarily\nabused  its  discretion.  Wis.  Right  to  Life  State  PAC\nv. Barland, 644 F.3d 139, 150 (7th Cir. 2011).\nAfter the district court found MPS and DPI liable for\nIDEA  violations,  DPI  commenced  settlement  negotia-\ntions  with  class  counsel  and  eventually  submitted  a\nsettlement agreement for court approval. DPI agreed to\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee MPS’s IDEA\n—\ncompliance and develop a compliance plan for MPS\nwith  input  from  class  counsel  and  the  independent\n—\nmonitor establishing  specific  requirements  that  DPI\nwould in turn impose on MPS. The plan’s implementa-\ntion would be tied to several benchmarks DPI promised\nto enforce against MPS. Among other things, DPI agreed\nthat  MPS  would  evaluate  95%  of  referred  students\nwithin the statutory time frame; that MPS would make\nreasonable attempts to include a parent in 95% of IEP\nmeetings;  and  that  MPS  would  refer  95%  of  students\nwith  a  specified  number  of  suspensions  and  95%  of\nstudents  retained  in  grade  to  an  early  intervention\nsystem for the possibility of disability evaluations. The\nsettlement  also  gave  the  independent  monitor  sig-\nnificant  oversight  authority  over  MPS,  including  the\nability to order MPS to make administrative changes to\ncomply  with  the  settlement  agreement.  In  exchange\nfor  these  and  other  promises,  the  settlement  released\nDPI from all claims in this suit and also purported to\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 41 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (42 of 56)\n38 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\npreclude all class members from bringing any representa-\ntive suit against DPI for IDEA violations that occurred\nprior to the settlement date.\nIt should be apparent from the foregoing description\nthat this settlement agreement is highly unusual. DPI’s\nprimary  concessions  require  performance  from  MPS,\nwhich is not a party to the agreement and did not con-\nsent. Sensing the problem, the district court allowed MPS\nto file an objection to the settlement. MPS argued that the\nsettlement  agreement  impermissibly  affected  its  legal\nrights and conflicted with state statutes governing DPI’s\noversight  authority.  The  district  court  framed  the\nquestion  this  way:  Does  “DPI  ha[ve]  the  authority  to\norder  MPS  to  take  the  actions  called  for  in  the  pro-\nposed  settlement  agreement[?]”  If  DPI  has  the  legal\nauthority to command MPS to take the specified actions,\nthen the state agency’s agreement to impose mandates\non MPS would pose no problem. But if DPI does not\n—\nhave that legal authority stated differently, if MPS has\n—\na legal right to resist such a demand from DPI then a\nsettlement agreement binding DPI to impose mandates\non MPS, a nonparty, infringes MPS’s legal rights.\n“The general rule . . . is that a non-settling party does not\nhave standing to object  to a settlement between other\nparties.” Agretti v. ANR Freight Sys., Inc., 982 F.2d 242,\n246  (7th  Cir.  1992).  There  is  an  exception  when  the\nnonsettling  party  “can  show  plain  legal  prejudice\nresulting from the settlement.” See id. at 246-47 (citing\nQuad/Graphics, Inc. v. Fass, 724 F.2d 1230, 1233 (7th Cir.\n1983), and other cases).

Id. at 247.\nHere,  as  the  district  court  correctly  acknowledged,\nMPS’s  substantive  objection  to  the  settlement  and  its\nbasis for standing are one and the same: If the settlement\nagreement  prejudiced  MPS’s  legal  rights,  MPS  may\nobject, and its objection has merit.\nThe  district  court  ultimately  held  that  MPS  did  not\nhave  standing  to  object  because  DPI  has  authority  to\nimplement  the  agreement.  As  the  state  agency  with\nauthority  to  dispense  federal  special-education\nfunding, DPI is responsible for ensuring local compliance\nwith the IDEA’s requirements. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).\nSection  115.90  of  the  Wisconsin  Statutes  outlines  the\nthree enforcement mechanisms available to DPI should\na local school district fail to comply:\n(1) If, as the result of a monitoring procedure or a\ncomplaint investigation, the state superintendent finds\nthat  a  local  educational  agency  has  violated  this\nsubchapter, the state superintendent may require the\nlocal educational agency to submit a corrective plan ad-\ndressing the violation.\n(2) If the state superintendent, after reasonable notice\nand an opportunity for a hearing, finds that a local\neducational  agency  has  failed  to  comply  with  any\nrequirement in this subchapter, the state superinten-\ndent  shall  reduce  or eliminate  special  education  aid  to\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 43 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (44 of 56)\n40 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthe local educational agency until he or she is satisfied\nthat the local educational agency is complying with\nthat requirement.\n(3) If the state superintendent finds that a corrective\nplan  under  sub.  (1)  has not been implemented,  or\nthat withholding aid under sub. (2) has been inade-\nquate to ensure compliance with this subchapter, the\nstate superintendent shall request the attorney general\nto  proceed  against  the  local  educational  agency for  in-\njunctive or other appropriate relief.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe district court focused on DPI’s statutory authority\nunder  subsection  (2)  to  withhold  MPS’s  funding  for\nfailure to comply with the IDEA’s requirements. Because\nMPS retained the right to appeal any suspension of funds\nto the Department of Education, see 34 C.F.R. § 76.401,\nthe district court concluded that the settlement did not\nviolate  MPS’s  rights  but  rather  “could  be  viewed  as\nessentially another corrective action, similar to any one\nof the numerous other corrective action plans previously\nestablished by DPI.”\nThis analysis overlooks key parts of Wisconsin’s en-\nforcement scheme. It’s true that DPI has the authority\nto  reduce  MPS’s  federal  funding  or  eliminate  it  alto-\ngether.  But  the  settlement  agreement  does  not  im-\nplicate  DPI’s  authority  over  the  disbursement  of\nfederal funds; rather, DPI bound itself to impose a cor-\nrective plan on MPS. DPI does not, however, have the\nunilateral  authority  to  impose  a  corrective  plan  on  a\nnoncompliant  local  school  district.  To  the  contrary,\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 44 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (45 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 41\nDPI may only require that a local school district develop\nand submit a plan to address areas of IDEA noncompli-\nance; the details of the plan are left to the local school\ndistrict. See WIS. STAT. § 115.90(1). DPI can force a local\nschool  district  to  take  specific  remedial  action  only  if\nthe district fails to implement its own corrective plan.\nAlternatively, DPI can withhold or reduce federal funds,\nand if this more dramatic action does not induce compli-\nance, the state superintendent of public instruction can\nask  the  state  attorney  general  to  sue  to  bring  the\nschool district into compliance. See id. § 115.90(3).\nThe  local  school  district’s  autonomous  authority  to\ndevelop its own corrective plan is no small distinction\nin  the  context  of  this  case.  Because  DPI  cannot\nunilaterally force MPS to take specific remedial action, a\nsettlement  that  attempts  to  do  exactly  that  prejudices\nMPS’s legal rights by requiring more of MPS than Wis-\nconsin law permits DPI to impose. The district court’s\nconclusion  to  the  contrary  was  an  error  of  law,  and\nbecause the decision to approve DPI’s settlement turned\nin  large part on  this  legal  error,  that  decision  was  an\nabuse of discretion.8\n8 The  parties  note  a  change  in  Wisconsin  law  during  the\npendency  of  these  appeals.  Under  2009  Wisconsin  Act  215\n(published May 13, 2010), the state superintendent of public\ninstruction  is  empowered  to  order  certain  low-performing\nschool  districts  to  take  certain  remedial  actions.  However,\nAct 215 does not amend section 115.90, or any other provision\nin  the  Wisconsin  Statutes,  Chapter  115,  Subchapter  V,  the\n(continued...)\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 45 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (46 of 56)\n42 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nApart  from  this  misunderstanding  about  DPI’s\nstatutory oversight authority, the district court’s approval\nof DPI’s settlement must be vacated for a much simpler\nreason: There can be no class settlement if the class should\nnot  have  been  certified  in  the  first  place. See  Ortiz  v.\nFibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 858 (1999) (“[T]he determina-\ntion whether ‘proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication’ must focus on ‘questions that\npreexist any settlement.’” (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\nWindsor,  521  U.S.  591,  622-23  (1997))).  Although  class\ncertification and settlement approval were sought sepa-\nrately here, the caselaw on so-called “settlement only”\nclasses  is  instructive.9  The  Supreme  Court  has  made\nclear that a settlement-only class must satisfy the bulk\nof Rule 23’s requirements in order to be certified. See id.\nat  864;  Amchem,  521  U.S.  at  620.  And  when  a  district\ncourt abuses its discretion in certifying a settlement-only\nclass,  we  unwind  not  only  the  class  certification  but\nalso  the  class  settlement.  See,  e.g.,  Crawford  v.  Equifax\nPayment Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 877, 881-82 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(vacating  order  approving  class  settlement  because\nclass did not satisfy Rule 23(b)).

Because  the\nnamed plaintiffs do not legally represent the absent class\nmembers, they cannot settle the absent class members’\nclaims. The district court’s order approving DPI’s settle-\nment must be vacated.\n10 As summarized by the Court in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.:\n[Class  actions]  implicate  the  due  process  “principle  of\ngeneral  application  in  Anglo-American  jurisprudence\nthat one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a\nlitigation in which he is not designated as a party or to\nwhich he has not been made a party by service of process,”\nHansberry v.

I share many of my colleagues’ concerns about\nthe way in which the class was defined in this case, and\nI  further  agree  that  because  DPI  lacked  the  authority\nto  unilaterally  impose  a  corrective  plan  on  a  local\nschool district, it was error to approve DPI’s settlement\nwith  the  plaintiffs.  However,  I  am  not  convinced  that\nno  class  was  feasible  in  this  case,  nor  do  I  believe\nthat  the  inability  to  identify  class  members  until  the\nremedial  phase  of  the litigation  precludes certification\nof the class. For these reasons, I write separately.\nOn its face, the class certified in this case bears the\nhallmarks of the sort of open-ended classes of which we\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 48 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (49 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 45\ndisapproved in Adashunas v.

Although the class that the district court\napproved (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside  within  the  MPS  district,  who  are  or  may  be\neligible  for  special  education  services,  and  who  are,\nhave been, or will be denied or delayed entry into or\nparticipation  in  the  IEP  process)  is  considerably  more\nnarrow  than  the  class  originally  proposed  by  the\nplaintiffs (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district and who are or may be\neligible  for  special  education  services),  it  was  never\nformally delimited by the particular types of violations\nthat  the  plaintiffs  were  alleging.  The  consequence  of\nsuch an open-ended description of the class, as we noted\nin Rahman, is that “every time plaintiffs file a brief or\nmotion, membership in the class[ ] may change.” Id. at 625.\nThus, at any given point during the litigation, it may not\nbe possible to know from the class definition itself what\nthe true parameters of the class are and what types of\nindividuals might be in the class. Id. at 625-26. In this\ncase, the class has been defined to include all students\neligible  for  special  services  who  have  been  denied  or\ndelayed  entry  into  the  IEP  system.  That  definition\nliterally  may  include  students  who  were  delayed  or\ndenied  entry  due  to  circumstances  having  little  or\nnothing to do with the defendants’ actions, by essentially\nrandom  circumstances  that  are  unique  to  one  student\nor limited to a small number of students, or by circum-\nstances that the class representatives have not identified\nas a basis for relief to the class.\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 49 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (50 of 56)\n46 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nI am mindful that the parties and the court, from the\ntime  that  the  class  was  certified  forward,  appear  to\nhave developed an understanding that the class would\ninclude the four sets of individuals that the court later\nexpressly identified in its liability decision: (1) students\nwith suspected disabilities who were never referred for\nan evaluation; (2) students who were referred for evalua-\ntion, but whose evaluations were not completed within\nthe  requisite 90-day  limit;  (3)  students  who were  sus-\npended in such a way as to frustrate their evaluation;\nand (4) students whose IEP meetings took place in the\nabsence of their parents. See ante at 9; R. 195 at 3-6; R. 389\nat 61. Moreover, the court’s liability decision was limited\nto the time period commencing in September 2000 and\nending in June 2005. R. 389 at 3. In these respects, the\nlitigation ultimately focused on a class of students that\nwas much more limited than the certified class was on\nits face, and one that in the end was much more definite\nthan  the  sweeping  class  we  criticized  in  Adashunas,\nfor example.\nBut even as confined to these four groups of students\nand  this  roughly  five-year  period,  the  class  includes\nunknown numbers of variations. To cite one example:\nWhen, in her 2004 report, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson addressed\nMPS’s  failure  to  meet  statutory  deadlines  during  the\nassessment  process,  she  identified  at  least  four  differ-\nent patterns of delays: (1) delays occasioned by the initial\nmis-categorization  of  a  student’s  suspected  disability;\n(2)  delays  caused  by  extensions  of  time  routinely\nrequested for disability assessments solicited during the\nspring  semester;  (3)  delays  triggered  by  the  need  for\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 50 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (51 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 47\nadditional medical records; and (4) delays for reasons not\nrevealed in the files she reviewed. Plaintiffs’ Ex. 8 at 6, 8-9.\nEach  of  these  four  scenarios  might  be  a  manifesta-\ntion  of  MPS’s  failure  to  timely  identify  students  with\ndisabilities and to convene IEP meetings to address those\ndisabilities, but it is difficult to discern a common, wrong-\nful policy or practice that might account for them all.\nInstead, this looks more like an effort to sweep many\nindividual plaintiffs and sets of facts into one class on\nthe  premise  that  all  reflect  illegal  conduct  by  the\ndefendant in practice and culture if not in policy. As the\nmajority points out, ante at 32, that is precisely the sort\nof class that the Supreme Court recently rejected in Wal-\nMart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  131  S.  Ct.  2541  (2011).  Like\nmy colleagues, I am not convinced that the certified class\nin this case is united by common legal or factual issues.\nNonetheless,  I  do  not  rule  out  the possibility that a\nclass properly could be certified in this case or one like\nit, and it is to this limited extent that I dissent. My col-\nleagues have concerns both with the notion that a class\naction may be premised on “systemic” violations of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations and with a class\ncomposed  of  individuals  whose  identity  cannot  be\nknown until the remedial phase of the litigation. How-\never, I believe that notwithstanding the inherently child\nspecific  nature  of  child-find  inquiries,  a  class  action\nbased  on  a  truly  systemic  child-find  failure  may  be\nviable.  And  the  fact  that  it  may  not  be  possible  to\nidentify  individual  class  members  until  the  remedial\nphase of the litigation, when prospective members of the\nclass  are  invited  to  come  forward  and  establish  that\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 51 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (52 of 56)\n48 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthey were among those injured by this systemic failure,\nshould not preclude a class action, which may be the\nonly  realistic  avenue  of  relief  for  those  injured  by\nsystemic violations of their rights.\nSystemic  violations  of  the  IDEA  are  cognizable.  See\nDoe ex rel. Brockhuis v. Ariz. Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th  Cir.  1997)  (coll.  cases).  The  problem  here  is  that\nthe  plaintiffs’  claims  appear  to  be  based  on  multiple,\ndisparate  failures  to  comply  with  the  school  district’s\nstatutory  child-find  obligations  rather  than  a  truly\nsystemic policy or practice which affects them all. But\nmy  colleagues  go  so  far  as  to  state  that  “[t]here  is\nno such thing as a ‘systemic’ failure to find and refer\n—\nindividual disabled children for IEP evaluation except\nperhaps  if  there  was  ‘significant  proof’  that  MPS\noperated  under  child-find  policies  that  violated  the\nIDEA.” Ante at 33 (emphasis in original) (citing Wal-Mart,\n130 S. Ct. at 2553). Certainly I agree that an illegal policy\nwould support a claim for a systemic violation of the\nIDEA’s child-find mandate. But I also think that wide-\nspread  practices  might  also  support  such  a  claim.  Cf.\nKing ex rel. King v. E. St. Louis School Dist. 189, 496 F.3d\n812,  817  (7th  Cir.  2007)  (citing  Calhoun  v.  Ramsey,  408\nF.3d  375,  379  (7th  Cir.  2005))  (noting  that  municipal\nliability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 may be based on customs\nand practices as well as formal, written policies). Suppose,\nfor  example,  that  MPS  ignored  and  did  not  refer  for\nevaluation students with a particular type of potential\n— —\ndisability e.g., dyslexia and as a result, large numbers\nof students with that disability went unidentified  and\nwere deprived of the educational services to which they\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 52 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (53 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 49\nwere entitled under the IDEA. To my mind, this would\nbe a genuinely systemic violation of the district’s child-\nfind obligations that would be amenable to recognition\nand remediation in a class action: Notwithstanding the\nfact  that each student  is unique  and is  entitled to  his\nown,  individualized  IEP,  all  members  of  the  class\nwould suffer a common injury resulting from the school\ndistrict’s failure to have appropriate systems in place to\nidentify students with that particular disability. Insisting\ninstead  that  each  student  exhaust  his  administrative\nremedies and/or sue independently would surely mean\nthat  many  such  students  would  reamin  unidentified\nand denied their right to free appropriate public educa-\ntion  (if  only  because  they  would  be  unaware  of  their\nrights) and likely would mean that the systemic viola-\ntion underlying their claims to relief would persist, as\nany individual proceedings would result in individual\nrather than structural relief.\nA key reason why my colleagues are reluctant to ac-\nknowledge  the  possibility  of  a  systemic  violation  of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations is the inability to\nidentify  individual  class  members  except  by  asking\nthe parents of putative class members to come forward\nat the remedial phase of the litigation and to establish, in\nindividual  hearings,  that  their  children  were  in  fact\nthe victims of the district’s child-find failures. But this\nmethod of identifying class members is hardly unprece-\ndented. Our decision in McDonald v. United Air Lines, Inc.,\n745 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984), reflects a similar approach.\nThe class in McDonald comprised women who had lost\ntheir jobs as a result of United Air Line’s rule (dating\nback  to  the  1930s)  prohibiting  marriage  for  its  female\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 53 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (54 of 56)\n50 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ncabin attendants. Once this court declared the no-marriage\nrule to be a violation of Title VII’s ban on sex discrim-\nination in Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194\n(7th Cir. 1971), any woman who had lost her position as\na result of that rule between the date Title VII took effect\nin  1965  and  United’s  abolition  of  the  rule  in  1968\nbecame entitled to relief. See McDonald v. United Air Lines,\nInc., 587 F.2d 357 (7th Cir. 1978). But many if not most\nof the class members had simply resigned their positions\nin  contemplation  of  the  no-marriage  rule  rather  than\nformally protesting the rule or waiting for the company\nto  discharge  them,  so  there  was  no  record  enabling\neasy  identification  of  those  women  who  left  because\nof the no-marriage rule as opposed to another reason.\nConsequently, the onus was on former flight attendants\nto come forward at the final stage of the litigation and\nclaim  entitlement  to  relief,  at  which  point  individual,\nadversarial  hearings  were  convened  before  special\nmasters  in  order  to  establish  whether  each  claimant\nin fact left her position because of the illegal rule. See\nMcDonald, 745 F.2d at 1087-88.\nAs in McDonald, there will be times when the nature\nof the challenged conduct makes it difficult if not impos-\nsible to identity who is in the class and is entitled to\nrelief absent some sort of opt-in procedure by putative\nclass members coupled with an adjudicatory procedure\nto confirm that they in fact qualify as class members. In\nMcDonald this was true because so many class members\nsilently  resigned  their  jobs  in  deference  to  their  em-\nployer’s  illegal  rule;  in  a  child-find  case  like  this  one\nit  would  be  true  because the  school  district  neglected\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 54 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719885      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 51 (55 of 56)\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 51\nits obligation under the IDEA to identify students with\npotential disabilities. This is not a function of a poor or\nopen-ended  class  definition  as  in  Rahman,  but  rather\ndue  to  the  fact  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  did  not\nproduce  a  tidy  record  of  the  individuals  harmed  by\nthat conduct. Identifying class members in such circum-\nstances necessarily will require a relatively cumbersome,\nafter-the-fact inquiry of the sort employed in McDonald\nand as the district court envisioned here. The only alter-\nnative  is  to  foreclose  class-wide  relief  in  such  cases\nand  leave  each  individual  harmed  by  the  defendant’s\nconduct to pursue relief on his or her own, if he or she\nis even aware that a wrong has been committed. Realisti-\ncally, that will mean no relief at all for most individuals.\nFor all of these reasons, I concur in the court’s conclu-\nsion that the class certified in this case was improper, but\nI  do  not  join  its  conclusion  that  no  class  would  be\nviable in this case or other litigation alleging violation\nof  a  school  district’s  child-find  obligations  absent  an\nability to identify an express policy that violates the IDEA.\n2-3-12\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/13/12   Page 55 of 56   Document 669\n\nCase: 09-2741      Document: 00711719886      Filed: 03/13/2012      Pages: 1 (56 of 56)\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\nChicago, Illinois  60604\nMarch 5, 2012\nBefore\nJOEL M.

PLAINTIFF CLASS \nA.  Class Definition \n1.  The plaintiff class was certified by this Court on November 14, 2003 and consists \nof: those students eligible for special services who are, have been or will be denied or delayed \nentry into the special education process which results in a properly constituted initial IEP \nmeeting between the IEP team and the parents or guardians of the student. \nB.  Named Plaintiffs \n2.  Jamie S.- Mother Kena K. and Advocate Pat Patterson \na.  In June 2001 Pat Patterson was contacted by the parent ofJamie S.  At that \ntime Jamie was attending Emerson Elementary and was aged 8 and in the second grade.  Pat \nPatterson referred the child for an evaluation in June 2001.  It was found then that Jamie's IQ \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 1 of 40   Document 267\n\nwas 60.  Jamie was found eligible for special education in 2001.  Jamie has not lived in the \nMilwaukee Public Schools' attendance area since 2003. \n3.  Bryan E.- Mother Bridgette E. \na.  Since at least 1999, Bryan has had issues with poor attendance. The school \nadministrators and social workers have offered multiple interventions regarding attendance to \nBryan and his mother.  In 1998, the school offered interventions due to Bryan's lack of \nachievement in reading.  In 1999-2000, Bryan was retained in the 61h grade at Bell Middle \nSchool.  In 2001-2002, Bryan had over 22 absences and I 0 suspensions in 71h grade and his \ngrades were poor.  His end of the year report cards indicated Bryan was not being promoted, but \nthe next year he was placed in the g'h grade. \nb.  The school contacted Bridgette in writing twice during that same year to \ninform her of his absences.  Bridgette requested a school with a later starting time because Bryan \ncould not get up to go to school on time at Bell.  The social worker and guidance counselor sent \nher the application for alternative schools on two separate occasions. \nc.  In 2002-2003, during the 8th grade Bryan's attendance and grades did not \nImprove.  Bryan was promoted to the 9'h grade.  In 2003-2004, at Marshall High School Bryan \nhad 52 absences.  At the beginning of the school year, Bryan went to special education classes by \nmistake because there was another child with the same name who was in Special Education.  The \nduplicative name situation with two Bryan/Brian Edwards attending occurred for approximately \nten (I 0) days.  When it was straightened out Bryan went back to regular education classes. \nd.  Bridgette referred Bryan for a special education evaluation on December \n17,2003.  On December 7, 2003 the school sent Bridgette a notice of receipt of referral and \nscheduled the initia!IEP team meeting for February 26, 2004 at that time.  On January 22, 2004 \n2 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 2 of 40   Document 267\n\nthe diagnostic teacher called Bridgette to ask for consent for testing.  Bridgette gave consent for \nthe school to evaluate Bryan on January 26, 2004.  Bridgette was sent the first invitation to the \nIEP team meeting on February 9, 2004.  On February 17, 2004 Bridgette was sent a reminder \nletter for the initial IEP meeting and offer of alternative participation. On February 24, 2004 the \ndiagnostic teacher followed up with a phone call as a reminder and to offer alternative means \nparticipation.  The offer of alternative participation letter includes options to schedule the \nmeeting at a different time, participation by telephone individually or as a conference call, \nreceipt of draft prior to the meeting for review/input or conferences prior to or after the \nscheduled meeting.  MPS held the first IEP meeting without Bryan or his mother, Bridgette \npresent because Bridgette had just had surgery and was physically unable to get to school. The \nIEP team did find him eligible for special education.  Bryan is currently enrolled at the \nCommunity High School and is making progress towards his IEP goals and is earning credits \ntowards graduation. \n4.  Melanie V. ~Mother Jane P. and Father Peter V. \na.  Melanie attended Milwaukee School of the Languages for 6th grade in \n2001-2002.  Melanie failed the 6th grade that year.  During the 2002-2003 school year Melanie \nrepeated 6th grade.  At the start of the 2003-2004 school year Melanie had progressively more \nbehavior problems.  On September 18,2003, the school psychologist met with Melanie's parents \nto discuss academic and emotional concerns.  A homework plan was implemented.  It was \nagreed that Melanie would continue to receive school psychological services.  The school \nremained in contact with Melanie's parents regarding her progress.  On November 17, 2003 \nMelanie's parents and the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) were called to school because \n3 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 3 of 40   Document 267\n\nMelanie was engaging in self-injurious behaviors. MPD escorted her to the Milwaukee County \nMental Health Complex. \nb.  The school remained in contact with Melanie's parents regarding \ninterventions for Melanie.  MPS had not evaluated Melanie for a special education disability at \nthis time. \nc.  The school was informed of her medications for depression.  Melanie was \nfailing academically.  The school contacted Melanie's parents and MPD on December 5, 2003, \nand Melanie was taken to the Mental Health Complex with the permission of Melanie's mother, \nbecause the school psychologist found that she had been cutting on her arms and made threats to \nkill others.  When Melanie returned to school, no school staff contacted her parents about failing \ngrades or absenteeism.  The school contacted Melanie's parents about her psychiatric problems. \nBetween December 5th and 17'h, 2003 MPS did not refer Melanie for a special education \nevaluation. \nd.  On December 17, 2003, at the request ofMPS, Melanie was transported to \nthe county mental health center by the MPD for self-injurious behavior with a razor blade and \nglass, which occurred at school.  Melanie's mother gave her permission for this removal and her \nfather came to the school.  At this time, Melanie was suspended for five days for possession of a \nweapon under school district policy prohibiting the possession of a weapon by any student on \nschool grounds. \ne.  On January 5, 2004, the district held a conference where the facts of the \nincident were reviewed by staff and Melanie's parents.  Prior to this meeting, MPS sent \nMelanie's parents paperwork for a Section 504 evaluation.  At this meeting, Melanie's parents \nrequested a special education evaluation.  The IEP team meeting was held in January within the \n4 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 4 of 40   Document 267\n\n90 day timeline and Melanie was found eligible for special education.  MPS has continued to \noffer special education and related services that include social worker intervention, counseling \nand regular home contact.  Melanie is on a reduced-day schedule, has regular psychological \nservices at school, and is allowed to utilize other adaptive behavioral strategies.  In addition to \nannual IEP reviews, there have been nine IEP meetings scheduled between August 2004 and \nMarch 2005, five of which were cancelled by Melanie's mother with little notice to the school, \ndue to illness of Melanie and/or her mother. \n5.  Biagio R.- Mother Debra W. \na.  On April 10, 2002 Biagio was referred for special education evaluation by \nhis mother.  The initial IEP team meeting was scheduled for May 23, 2002.  The case was closed \non May 20, 2002 due to lack of parental responsiveness in obtaining necessary pre-existing \nmedical records.  School staff attempted on no less than twenty-one separate occasions to contact \nBiagio' s parents in order to obtain the necessary information. \nb.  In September 2003, according to Debra, Biagio's mother, he was \naggressive with other kids, didn't listen to teachers and didn't want to participate in school \nactivities.  He was attending grade K4 at Corpus Christi parochial school. Because of these \nproblems, his mother kept Biagio out of school for the next year K5 but Biagio's behavior was \nstill bad at home.  He was receiving in home therapy by Dr. Shellie Locke from September 2003 \nto May 2004.  He was hospitalized for mental health treatment about one week in December \n2003 and again in February 2004.  He was given diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \nDisorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Intermittent Explosive Disorder and a Mood Disorder \nNot Otherwise Specified (NOS).  In April 2004, the Mood Disorder diagnosis was changed to \nBi-polar Disorder.  Biagio was given Resperidal.  In March 2004, Biagio's doctor, Dr. Ferguson \n5 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 5 of 40   Document 267\n\nrecommended that Biagio go to Childynamics a special day treatment program for the treatment \nof behavioral and psychiatric disorders in children. \nc.  In January 2004, MPS was first notified by Biagio's mother about her \nconcerns regarding his significant behavior in his non-MPS social work history.  Up to and \nincluding this point, Biagio was not attending an MPS school/pre-school program.  Biagio was \nattending a therapeutic, non-academic day treatment program at Childynamics.  On January 29, \n2004 Biagio' smother requested a special education evaluation.  The Emerson staff met with him \none time at Emerson School but never saw him in a classroom setting.  Debra requested that they \nobserve Biagio at Childynamics but they would not, saying they weren't allowed at \nChildynamics because it was against the law.  The IEP meeting was held and Biagio was found \nineligible for special education services because MPS staff did not adequately observe him \nduring the brief observation time they had at the school for the testing. \nd.  A Special Education Leadership Liaison (\"SELL\") from MPS contacted \nDebra in June 2004 to state that MPS would like to re-visit the eligibility determination made \nduring Biagio's evaluation.  This SELL contacted Debra again in June, July and August 2004 to \ndiscuss revisiting the evaluation and setting up a school observation session.  Debra declined this \noffer and asked instead to wait until Biagio started Emerson in the fall to determine whether \nanother evaluation was necessary.  Debra did not want Biagio evaluated outside ofthe school \nsetting because previously MPS had not observed him inside of the classroom setting and had \nfound him ineligible. \ne.  Biagio started at Emerson school in September 2004.  He began by \nattending half of the school day at Emerson; and attended Childynamics the other half of the day \nfor continued mental health treatment and behavior therapy.  That same month, his mother \n6 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 6 of 40   Document 267\n\nagreed to the SELL's request that the MPS evaluation team reconvene and consider additional \ninformation including the records from his K4 experience and medical records from his \nhospitalizations as well as current treatment records.  On September 30, 2004 the entire IEP team \nconvened at the home ofBiagio and his family, including Biagio's Childynamics' therapist who \nparticipated by phone, to re-examine the previous evaluation results and new information.  Debra \nagreed that more information was needed for the team to conduct a proper analysis.  The team \ndiscussed what testing was needed, including observations by the psychologist and diagnostic \nteacher.  The team decided that additional information was needed before evaluating Biagio for \nan emotional/behavioral disability.  The team scheduled the next meeting for November 19, \n2004. \nf.  The team met in November and Biagio's mother brought in more \ninformation about his various emotional/behavioral privately diagnosed disabilities.  The team \nmade eligibility determinations for Biagio for Other Health Impairment, Speech and Language, \nOccupational Therapy and Physical Therapy and an Emotional/Behavioral Disability at this \nmeeting. \ng.  The team determined that Biagio did not qualify for special education \nservices.  The Wisconsin emotional behavioral disability eligibility criteria requires a student to \nhave chronic, severe and frequent behavioral problems at school and in one other environment \n(in addition to other criteria) to qualify as a student with an emotional disability.  The team \ndetermined that Biagio had serious behavior problems at home and in the Childynamics program \n(a therapeutic program), but not at school.  Biagio's classroom teacher reported that he had two \nbehavioral incidents thus far. \n7 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 7 of 40   Document 267\n\nh.  Biagio's mother was informed orally and in writing of her right to appeal \nthe decision of the team and to seek resolution through administrative remedies available to her. \nOn December 9, 2004 the school convened a Collaborative Support Team that included Biagio's \nparent, to review Biagio's progress in school and collaborate on any non-special education \ninterventions or learning strategies that Biagio may benefit from at Emerson. \nC.  Other potential class members \n6.  Jyran J. \na.  In 2000-2001, Jyran began having problems with his behavior and school \nwork in 2\"d grade at Lee Elementary School.  He was retained in 2\"d grade.  His mother had him \nevaluated for federal Social Security Disability and he was found eligible to receive Social \nSecurity benefits.  She informed the school that he was eligible for the Social Security benefits. \nNo referral was made by school staff for special education at this time. Social Security disability \nevaluation process and eligibility criteria is wholly separate from special education evaluations \nand disability criteria, but can be considered during evaluations of children to determine if they \nmeet special education eligibility criteria. \nb.  During the next two years, his family moved twice.  He continued to have \nproblems at 381h St. school, which was his neighborhood school at that time.  His mother \ncontinued to be in frequent contact with the school staff.  During 2001-2002, Jyran attended third \ngrade at the 381h Street School and Bryant Elementary School and he was retained at the end of \nthis year.  During this year, he also had a Central Office hearing for a behavioral incident. \nc.  Jyran attended Phyllis Wheatley School in 2002-2003, as an  II year old \nin third grade due to being retained.  His mother placed him in Willowglen Day treatment at the \nadvice of her son's private therapist.  She made the request for getting Jyran evaluated for special \neducation and placed in the right school.  The referral was made on November 16, 2004. \n8 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 8 of 40   Document 267\n\nd.  On February 22\"d the building coordinator made contact with Cynthia by \ntelephone and the two agreed that Cynthia would come to school the next day to sign consent \npapers for MPS to evaluate Jyran.  On February 23, 2005 Cynthia signed the consent forms. \ne.  The initial IEP meeting was held on May 5, 2005 and continued on \nMay 12, 2005.  Jyran was found eligible for special education services in the area of \nemotional/behavioral disability and specific learning disabilities.  The team discussed Jyran's \neligibility for compensatory services because of the delay in his evaluation and 5 days of \nsuspension which exceeded the statutory limitations for a child with a disability. The team \ndecided to make the compensatory services determination at a later team meeting. \nf.  On May 26, 2005, the team met to develop a Functional Behavioral \nAssessment (FBA) and Behavioral Intervention Plan (BIP).  In addition, the team discussed the \nissue of compensatory services.  MPS staff determined that Jyran was owed a total of 57 days. \nBased on discussions between J yran and his mother, and because of a planned trip to Alabama in \nJuly, they agreed to accept one-on-one tutoring for one hour each time, twice ore week for a total \nof 57 one hour tutoring sessions to start in fall2005. \n7.  Shaquille J. \na.  Shaquille attended the Head Start program at Clark Street school at age 4. \nShaquille was enrolled in 5 year old kindergarten at Clark Street School the next year.  Prior to \nadmitting him, she met with the principal and the school nurse and informed them of his seizure \ndisorder and the side effects of the medications he was on.  She provided the school with a \nprintout from the pharmacy about these side effects.  Shaquille was retained in the second grade. \nb.  He was suspended many times resulting in a Central Office hearing. \nShaquille's mother requested a special education evaluation on June 4, 2004.  The request was \n9 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 9 of 40   Document 267\n\nnot followed up on until September 27, 2004 via a note sent home in Shaquille's backpack \nstating she needed to sign the authorization to evaluate.  The IEP was held November 30, 2004 \nand he was found eligible. \nc.  Shaquille's mother filed a complaint regarding this issue with the \nDepartment of Public Instruction.  The DPI found that MPS was out of compliance in complaint \nCase No. 04-043 for failing to timely evaluate Shaquille for special education.  MPS offered \nShaquille forty hours of compensatory services for the delay in Shaquille's evaluation process. \nII.  CHILD FIND \nA.  Prevalence and Demographic Data \n8.  Milwaukee has a population of approximately 600,000 people, 54% of whom are \npersons of color.  Nearly 16% of households speak a language other than English in the home. \nTwenty percent of the population are children between the ages of 5 and 17.  In addition, 36% of \nchildren who live with their family, live with a single mother as the head of the household. \nAlmost one-third of the children live in a household with persons other than their family \nmembers as the head of household. Over half of the households earn less than $35,000/year. \nOver 30% of all children in Milwaukee live below the poverty line. These demographics are not \nunusual for urban areas across our country.  Mobility rates as high as 10,000 students per year \nand rising (ranging from 8.8 % to 11.7 % from elementary to high school), parent access, parent \nresponsiveness, and high student needs are the reality within MPS. \n9.  On an annual basis, all school districts, including the MPS, submit data to the DPI \nregarding overall prevalence of students in special education, numbers of referrals, referral rate, \nand overall identification rate.  This data is reviewed at least annually by both the MPS Division \nof Special Services (\"DSS\") and the DPI.  As shown in the chart below, MPS data for the 1999-\n10 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 10 of 40   Document 267\n\n2000, 2000-2001, 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004 school years shows that overall \nprevalence ofMPS students in special education is roughly the same as for the overall State. \nPrevalence rate is the total number of children with disabilities divided by the total public and \nprivate school enrollment in grades pre-K through 12.  Identification rate is the percentage of \ninitial referrals resulting in an identification of a disability. \nPrevalence of All \nChildren in Special \nEducation:  1999-2000  2000-2001 \nB.  SOAP and SEP:  Foundations of Oversight \ni.  School Education Plans (SEP) \n10.  MPS requires each individual school to develop a School Educational Plan (SEP) \nthat outlines how each school will be working towards increasing student achievement \nthroughout the school year. The foundation of all school based planning and decision making is \nguided by the SEP. The SEP is developed at the building level by a team of individuals usually \ncalled the \"Learning Team\". The SEP is to be developed to incorporate the district's mission and \nteaching and learning targets which are aligned with state standards into a working document to \nguide the day-to-day activities of each school. School based administrators are trained and \noffered in-service opportunities on the development of the SEP throughout the school year. The \nSEP is intended to be a roadmap and a working document for each school to use during the \nschool year to support their efforts in increasing student achievement. The ten sections of the \n11 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 11 of 40   Document 267\n\nSEP guide the school's efforts in developing and implementing an effective educational plan. \nThe development of the plan is supported by the central administration through the provision of \nworkbooks, electronic support, and personal training seminars to ensure that schools have the \ntools available to them to develop a meaningful plan aimed at boosting the achievement of all \nstudents. \n11.  Each School Education Plan (SEP) is reviewed by a review committee that, at \nminimum, consist of an administrative specialist, a leadership coach, and a special education \nleadership liaison to determine if the following items specific to special education have been met \nin the plan: \na.  Description of service delivery model (e.g., continuum of services); \nb.  Disaggregated special education test scores; \nc.  Research-based specially designed instructional and behavioral strategies \nembedded in the plan that addresses students with special needs for the \npurpose of increasing academic and behavioral achievements; \nd.  Demographic description of special education population; \ne.  Representation of special education staff, parent, or student on the learning \nteam; \nf.  Professional development for special educators and general educators \nspecific to the schools, special education, student population instructional \nneeds (behavioral and academic); \ng.  Evidence of utilization of related service staff such as psychologist, school \nsocial worker, and nurse; \nh.  Disaggregated suspension, truancy, and attendance rates; \n1.  Trainings, workshops, meetings to improve procedural compliance and \nother special education needs identified at the school level; \nJ.  Discipline plan that includes school-wide, classroom, and individualized \npositive behavioral interventions/supports; \nk.  Include parent of students with special needs in the Family and \nCommunity Involvement Plan; \n12 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 12 of 40   Document 267\n\nI.  Strategies are developed by the school to monitor procedural compliance \nin addition to the district compliance tools; \nm.  Were all items at 94% accuracy or below addressed in the compliance \nneeds assessment surrunary; \nn.  Compliance implementation plan developed to address all items at 94% \naccuracy or below; and \no.  A variety of formative data sources are used (e.g., discipline day \nrecorders, progress reports, report cards). \n12.  In the course of the SEP plan development, the learning team first collects and \nanalyzes data to determine what their school's strengths and needs are. Following the data \nanalysis, the team categorizes and prioritizes needs based on the assessment and chooses three to \nfive areas where there is greatest need to focus on for the school year. Clear, measurable and \nsustainable goals are then developed to increase performance in the areas of greatest need which \nare supported by the implementation of specific strategies in those areas. Once the SEP is \ndeveloped, it is submitted to the office of the Superintendent and a centrally located review team \nis assigned to conduct an onsite review of the SEP with the school based learning team. The \npurpose of the central office review is to provide support to the individual school in the areas \nidentified as the greatest need by the school and to provide feedback on the plan to assist in its \nimplementation.  The entire SEP is then reviewed by the school-based learning team on a regular \nbasis to evaluate the effectiveness of those strategies. \n13.  Each school is also required to embed strategies of increasing the achievement of \nstudents with disabilities in their SEP. The learning team is required to have at least one special \neducation stakeholder representative to ensure that the SEP provides oversight of a clearly \narticulated philosophy and best practice approach to the provision of special education in a non-\nlabel driven service delivery model. This building level effort is supported by central services \nstaff through the SELL position as well as other special education administrative staff. SELLs \n13 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 13 of 40   Document 267\n\nand special education supervisors work with individual schools to develop service provision \nmodels that shift special education service delivery from program driven models to service \ndelivery models based on individual student needs versus individual student labels. \nii.  Special Education Action and Oversight Plan (\"SOAP\") \n14.  DPI's July 17, 2001letter to MPS summarizing its 2000-2001 on-site monitoring \nfindings observed that MPS needed an effective system of administrative accountability at the \nschool building level in order to resolve the compliance issues DPI had found through on-site \nmonitoring and its other oversight activities.  The letter expressed DPI's pleasure that MPS had \nagreed to develop and implement such a system by September I, 2001.  MPS did not develop \nand implement a system of administrative accountability at the school building level by \nSeptember 1, 2001. \n15.  In October 2001, DPI entered into a consulting contract with Lee Greenwald, the \nformer director of special education in the Madison Public Schools.  Initially, Dr. Greenwald's \nrole was to serve as DPI's chief negotiator in mediation efforts between the parties shortly after \nthis lawsuit was filed. \n16.  Shortly after Dr. Greenwald was engaged by DPI, DPI expanded Dr. Greenwald's \nrole to assist MPS in creating a centralized system of special education accountability within \nMPS 's decentralized educational service delivery system. \n17.  In April, 2002, Dr. Greenwald completed a written plan for creating a centralized \nsystem of special education accountability within MPS 's decentralized service delivery model. \nThe title of Dr. Greenwald's plan is \"Milwaukee Public Schools Special Education Oversight \nAction Plan.\"  The parties and witnesses in this case frequently refer to the plan by its initials--\n\"SOAP.\" \n14 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 14 of 40   Document 267\n\n18.  DPI's 2001-2002 on-site monitoring ofMPS in May, 2002, revealed that MPS \nhad not corrected the implementation errors found in DPI's 2000 on-site monitoring, and had not \ncorrected the implementation errors identified in the five Consolidated Corrective Action Plans \n(CCAPs) created in 2000 and 2001.  CCAPs are corrective action plans centered around broadly \ndefined themes of placement, non-attendance, discipline, speech and language, and IEP services, \nidentified in monitoring findings and IDEA complaint findings. \n19.  During the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 school years, DPI did not conduct on-site \nmonitoring ofMPS using the methodology acknowledged by OSEP in its October 2000 \nmonitoring report; i.e., a combination of student record reviews, staff and parent interviews, and \npolicy reviews.  Instead, DPI focused its oversight activities on assisting MPS to build the \neffective, centrally administered system of special education procedural oversight and \naccountability mechanisms within MPS, and the mechanisms to be implemented at each school \nbuilding, that DPI had ordered in its June 18, 2002 monitoring report to MPS. \n20.  DPI required the Milwaukee Board of School Directors to adopt and implement \nthe essential components of Dr. Greenwald's SOAP plan. \n21.  With minor modifications, Dr. Greenwald's SOAP plan was adopted by the \nMilwaukee Board of School Directors on June 27, 2002, with instructions to MPS administrators \nto implement SOAP as soon as possible. \n22.  In June of 2002, the Board adopted the Special Education Oversight Action Plan \n(SOAP) and implemented several other initiatives to improve the provision of special education \nservices within the Milwaukee Public School system.  The SOAP is a centralized special \neducation accountability system that provides oversight and evaluation of the delivery of special \neducation services in each school.  This system is based on a centrally designed and locally \n15 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 15 of 40   Document 267\n\nimplemented self-assessment and continuous improvement monitoring process using each \nschool's specific School Education Plan.  Highlights of SOAP include provisions for:  the \nappointment of a District Ombudsperson to receive special education complaints if required; the \ndevelopment and implementation of a parent dispute resolution process; increased opportunities \nfor parental involvement and support for parents through the expansion of the centrally located \nParent Information Center; greater accountability of building principals in the provision of \nspecial education services through an individual evaluation process; greater oversight and \nevaluation through the requirement that each school include a major special education \ncomponent in its education plan; additional staff members to provide expertise and guidance to \nindividual schools in special education; implementation of on-site self monitoring activities; and \nestablishment of a Board-level committee on special education to monitor and assess the special \neducation program for the district as a whole. \n23.  One of the essential features of SOAP is the establishment of direct lines of \nauthority and accountability in the district's special education program.  The Director of the \nDSS, currently Patricia Y ahle, has been charged with the accountability for SOAP with the \nauthority equal to the Director of Leadership Services, who provides comparable direction, \nsupport, and oversight of the District's general education program. \n24.  Under SOAP, the Director ofDSS has the responsibility for oversight ofthe \nspecial education compliance and monitoring functions ofMPS and supervises the special \nservices administration, including the Special Education Leadership Liaisons (SELLs) \nestablished as part of the SOAP and the Special Education Coordinators.  Although the original \nSOAP plan called for six SELLs, MPS and DPI was concerned that six was an insufficient \nnumber.  Currently MPS employs nine SELLs.  DPI provides funding support for the salaries \n16 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 16 of 40   Document 267\n\nand fringe benefits of two SELL positions.  The Special Education Coordinators have district \nwide responsibilities, including Psychological Services, Speech and Language Services, and \nAllied Health; Social Work Services and Transition and Community Services; Non-Conventional \nPrograms; Coordinator of Compliance Management Services, Equitable Education Opportunities \nLiaison for Students with Disabilities. \n25.  Each SELL works with approximately 20-26 schools.  The SELLS work under \nthe direction of the DSS director, and have the responsibility to ensure procedural compliance, \nappropriate resolution of parental disputes, and appropriate educational programming within an \ninclusive local school building. The SELL serves as a liaison between the schools and the district \ncentral office. Within the centralized special education accountability system, the SELLs have \nthe authority, in coordination with the principal, to require a teacher or other staffmember(s) to \nparticipate in appropriate meetings. The SELLs have additional district-wide responsibilities, \nincluding Child Find, compliance and management services, extended school year, Early \nChildhood Assessment Team, Wraparound Services, non-conventional programs, home and \nhospital program, Section 504, residential care centers, partnership schools with MPS, charter \nschools, and non-instrumentality charter programs. \n26.  At least one Special Education Supervisor is assigned to each school.  Supervisors \nare assigned to more than one school.  Each school has at least one Diagnostic Teacher.  The \nSupervisors are supervised by the SELLs and are responsible for overseeing the compliance \nmonitoring of the building-beginning with the receipt of referral, through diagnosis and \nevaluation, and IEP development and implementation. The Special Education Supervisors and \nbuilding principals oversee the Diagnostic Teachers who have the responsibility for calling the \nparent and setting up the evaluations and the IEP meetings. The Supervisors are responsible to \n17 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 17 of 40   Document 267\n\nwork with building administration to ensure that the initial IEP meeting takes place in time to \ncomplete the evaluation and placement process within 90 days from the initial receipt of referral, \nand that evaluation data is entered into the MPS Special Services Information Management \nSystem. \n27.  Consistent with SOAP, nine DSS workgroups have been formed by the Director \nofDSS as a team approach to lead the efforts in the schools to achieve the goals of SOAP.  Each \nwork group is led by a SELL and composed of approximately 5-7 Special Education Supervisors \nand one special education parent liaison.  Each work group member is encouraged in writing, at \nleast twice a year, to submit comments and suggestions for improvement of workgroups or DSS \noperations. \n28.  SOAP makes each school principal accountable for the provision of special \neducation services and for the implementation of program improvements in his/her school. \nPrincipals are evaluated by both the Director of Special Services and by the Director of \nLeadership Services. \n29.  In addition, the DSS Director, the other members ofthe DSS Administrative \nTeam, the nine SELLs, and the five Special Education Coordinators are evaluated as to the \nperformance of SOAP. \niii.  SOAP/SEP Interactivity \n30.  Under SOAP, the building-based oversight and evaluation of the delivery of \nspecial education services takes place through the SEP. The SEP is developed each year by a \nschool committee that represents the school's constituents.  The content of the SEP is \ndetermined, generally, by self-assessment, by data based, outcome focused decision making, and \nby continuous improvement planning.  The SEP addresses general education issues as well as \n18 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 18 of 40   Document 267\n\nspecial education issues.  Under SOAP, each SEP contains a self-assessment of the school's \nspecial education performance through a review of student outcome data, surveys of parents and \nstaff, and classroom observations.  The self-assessment must also contain a rigorous armual self \nassessment of special education compliance, developed jointly between MPS and DPI.  Under \nSOAP, the school's special education needs, identified through the self-assessment, must be \naddressed in the school's school improvement plan.  In addition to the school's self-assessment, \nSOAP requires DPI to annually conduct activities to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of the \nspecial education component of the SEP, and to independently assess the district's procedural \ncompliance with special education requirements. \n31.  SOAP requires that the special education component of each school's SEP be \nreviewed and approved by the Special Education Supervisor and SELL assigned to that school. \nUnder SOAP, each school's assigned SELL is required to conduct a quarterly review of the \nschool's progress on its school improvement goals using district and school performance data \nand special education compliance data.  The SELLs are required to meet on a monthly basis with \nthe Director ofDSS and with the leadership specialist assigned to the SELL for the purpose of \nreporting on the status of special education and the SEP process in each building. \n32.  SOAP also requires MPS to link school and district budgets to the self-assessment \nand continuous improvement process.  Under SOAP, MPS offered assurance that its budgets \nwould support the implementation of SOAP in every building, and required that its schools' \nbudgets provide for the needs identified in each school's SEP.  To ensure that identified needs \nare properly budgeted, SOAP requires that the appropriate leadership specialist and SELL review \neach school's budget. \n19 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 19 of 40   Document 267\n\nC.  MPS Child Find Policies \n33.  According to MPS policy, all school administrators, teachers, psychologists, \nbuilding coordinators, Special Education Leadership Liaisons (SELLs), health professionals, \ncounselors, pupil services central office staff among others in MPS are responsible for meeting \nthe district's Child Find obligations. \n34.  All MPS staff are trained, to some extent commensurate with their duties, in Child \nFind.  This includes, but is not limited to, teachers, administrators, social workers, Head Start \nstaff, literacy coaches, building coordinators, special education supervisors and leadership \nliaisons, secretaries, diagnostic teachers, psychologists, guidance counselors, speech \npathologists, nurses and occupational and physical therapists.  For example, in August 2004, all \nMPS building coordinators and special education supervisors were trained in Child Find.  The \nspecial services administration and parent information specialists were trained in Child Find in \nSeptember and October 2004.  The building coordinators and supervisors in-serviced their \nrespective building staff during the opening week of school on Child Find.  It is MPS policy that \nattendance at each of the training sessions is mandatory. \n35.  Ultimate oversight responsibilities for Child Find rest with the Superintendent, \ncurrently William Andrekopolous, and School Board.  The Chief of Pupil Services, currently \nAda Rivera, is third behind the School Board and the Superintendent in ensuring that Milwaukee \nPublic Schools meet their Child Find obligations.  A majority of the oversight duties regarding \nChild Find activities have been delegated to the Director of Special Education, currently Patricia \nYahle, and her office. \n36.  Because Child Find is an important responsibility, the MPS has assigned a SELL, \nCharlyn Pozza, to oversee district-wide Child Find activities, even though the responsibilities for \nreferral and evaluation are with the schools. \n20 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 20 of 40   Document 267\n\n37.  MPS publishes handbooks which contain the district's policies and procedures \nrelating to special education, and which contain the districts policies and procedures specifically \nrelating to the responsibilities ofiEP teams. \n38.  Each MPS school identifies a Building Coordinator who receives referrals for \nevaluation for possible special education support. There is mandatory training at the beginning of \neach school year and periodically for new Coordinators regarding the special education process \nand procedures.  General and special education teachers also received Child Find training during \nthe opening week of the 2004-05 school year. \n39.  MPS policy requires any licensed school staff member who reasonably believes a \nchild has a disability to make a special education referral. \n40.  MPS policy requires every school staff member to accept initial special education \nreferrals from parents or guardians. \n41.  The MPS Parent/Guardian Rights and Responsibilities Handbook is distributed to \nthe parents and guardians ofMPS students at the beginning of each school year, and is also \nprovided to parents when their students enroll in the district during the school year. \n42.  The MPS Parent/Guardian Rights and Responsibilities Handbook details the \nrights of parents of children suspected of having special education needs-with the MPS Child \nFind telephone number. \n43.  MPS published Special Education Policies and Procedures manual in 2002.  A \ndraft of the publication was reviewed by staff from the DPI special education team prior to \npublication for the purpose of determining whether the policies and procedures complied with \nstate and federal special education law.  As published, the content of the 2002 manual was \napproved by DPI. \n21 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 21 of 40   Document 267\n\n44.  MPS published a revised version of the Special Education Policies and \nProcedures manual in February 2004.  A draft of the publication was reviewed by staff from the \nDPI special education team prior to publication for the purpose of determining whether the \npolicies and procedures complied with state and federal special education law.  As published, the \ncontent of the February 2004 Special Education Policies and Procedures manual was approved \nbyDPI. \n45.  MPS published a revision of the IEP Team Procedural Handbook in September \n2004.  A draft ofthe publication was reviewed by staff from the DPI special education team prior \nto publication for the purpose of determining whether the policies and procedures complied with \nstate and federal special education law.  As published, the content of the September 2004 IEP \nTeam Procedural Handbook was approved by DPI. \n46.  MPS policy requires that when a parent requests a special education referral, the \ndistrict must evaluate the student, develop an IEP for eligible students, and send the student's \nparent a notice of educational placement, within 90-days of the receipt of the referral. \n47.  MPS policy requires that any time a parent or other individual inquires, verbally \nor in writing, about a referral for special education services or expresses concern regarding a \npossible disability, the parent or individual must be provided with information about how to \ninitiate a referral. \n48.  MPS policy requires that when the district receives correspondence from any \nperson requesting an evaluation for a student and the correspondence does not state that the \nreason for the evaluation is a suspected disability, or does not identify the request as a special \neducation referral, the district must determine if the correspondence is a special education \n22 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 22 of 40   Document 267\n\nreferral.  This policy is documented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised \nSeptember 2004. \n49.  MPS policy requires that, in order to make a determination within a reasonable \ntime after receipt of such correspondence, the district must inform the correspondent of their \nright to make a special education referral and how to make a written referral.  This policy is \ndocumented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n50.  MPS policy requires that, in every case where it is unclear whether the person is \nrequesting a special education referral, the district representative may not discourage, refuse or \nclose out a referral for lack of perceived reasonable cause.  This policy is documented in MPS' \nIEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n51.  MPS policy assigns responsibility for processing initial referrals for special \neducation to the building coordinator in each school. \n52.  MPS policy provides that parents and others are not required to use the district's \nforms when making a special education referral. \n53.  MPS policy requires that parents who need help making a written referral should \nfirst be directed to the building coordinator, but that if the building coordinator is unavailable, \nanother staff member must be prepared to assist the parent.  This policy is documented in MPS' \nIEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n54.  MPS policy requires that parents be provided with written notice of their \nprocedural rights at the time they are notified that a referral has been received.  This policy is \ndocumented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n55.  MPS policy requires that parents be given the opportunity to participate in the \nreview of existing data on the child, and in identifying what additional data, if any, are needed to \n23 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 23 of 40   Document 267\n\ncomplete the evaluation.  This policy is documented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, \nrevised September 2004. \n56.  MPS policy requires that parents be notified that a referral has been received, and \nthat a signed consent to proceed be received before additional testing is administered.  This \npolicy is documented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n57.  MPS policy requires that IEP Team meetings include the following participants: \none or more of the student's parents; at least one regular education teacher familiar with the \nstudent; at least one special education teacher; a qualified, knowledgeable representative of the \nlocal educational agency (LEA) with authority to commit the district's resources; and under \nsome circumstances, other specified individuals.  This policy is documented in MPS' IEP Team \nProcedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n58.  MPS policy requires that diagnostic teachers follow and document a protocol of \nsteps to ensure parent participation in IEP Team meetings, and specific actions to take when a \nparent does not participate in an IEP meeting after the protocol is followed.  This policy is \ndocumented in MPS' IEP Team Procedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n59.  MPS policies restrict requests for extensions of time beyond 90 days to complete \nthe IEP Team process and determine placement to a specific set of reasons, require that the \nreasons be documented, require that the requests be approved by a supervisor, and limit the \nnumber of extension requests to two per case.  This policy is documented in MPS' IEP Team \nProcedural Handbook, revised September 2004. \n60.  When a parent registers their child for school attendance in MPS, they also \ncomplete a form that asks whether their child has a disability. \n24 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 24 of 40   Document 267\n\n61.  MPS has district-wide screenings when students enter school (i.e., vision, hearing, \npre-academic, social, and communication). \n62.  MPS sends information about special education forums to some community \norganizations for meetings that are held periodically throughout the year.  MPS sends a packet of \nchild find information to clinics and doctors' office upon request.  The packet is available in \nEnglish, Spanish and Hmong languages.  The packet includes a referral form, school and district \ncontact information and a booklet on the special education evaluation process, including a \nstatement of parental rights. \nD.  MPS Child Find Procedures \n63.  Child Find information appears in the MPS calendar and Parent/Student Rights & \nResponsibilities and Discipline handbook which is mailed annually at the beginning of the \nschool year to every MPS household with school age children and to all MPS schools. \n64.  At least two Parent Forums and between two and ten Community Resource Fairs \nare held during the school year.  The MPS Special Education Task Force also holds monthly \nmeetings that include administration, teacher, parent and community members. \n65.  Child Find information is provided in CESA Consortium Child Find Directory, \nwhich lists all the Child Finds in the state. \n66.  Child Find information is listed in the Community Information Data Base of the \nMilwaukee Public Library. \n67.  Child Find information is also found in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee Resource \nManual. \n68.  Child Find in-service presentations are done for Public Health nurses, day care \ncenters, (through MPS Early Childhood Assessment Team (ECAT), WIC centers, and \ncommunity organizations which provide family/parent empowerment assistance.  For example, \n25 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 25 of 40   Document 267\n\non September 14, 2004, a meeting was held with the representatives from various community \nbased Head Start programs. \n69.  Child Find information is published annually in the December issue of \nMetroParent resource guide. \n70.  Various SELLs, special education supervisors and administrators are responsible \nfor outreach and training to private and parochial schools. Dare Boling, an administrator, is the \ncoordinator of non-conventional programs.  She coordinates the provision of services for private \nand parochial schools with MPS.  In conjunction with many MPS personnel and \nprivate/parochial school representatives, develops the MPS service plan for private and parochial \nschool students in need of special education services. Ms. Boling also coordinates the IEP teams \nfor special education students in court-ordered, residential and other non-traditional education \nsettings.  Peggy Holtman coordinates staff development training efforts for the non-traditional \nsites, which includes training on the referral and evaluation process. \n71.  The MPS Parent Center staff are located at Central Office in two locations.  The \nparent center was expanded.  The parent center staff answer calls and meet in-person with \nparents. Their role is to direct parents to the proper resource within MPS to have their issues \nresolved.  Parent information specialists coordinate with parents to find the appropriate avenue \nfor resolution.  They are trained in Child Find and other special education issues.  The parent \ncenter staff assist in the summer and district-wide three choice enrollment processes as well, \nwhich maybe a parent's first contact with the district.  The school application that the parent \ncenter staff assists the parents in filling out asks whether a child has special education needs. \n72.  MPS Parent Center staff are not given protocols or scripts regarding what \nquestions to ask parents or others who call in regards to a child, nor are they told under what \n26 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 26 of 40   Document 267\n\ncircumstances they should tell a parent to seek a special education referral. If a parent requests a \nspecial education referral, it is MPS policy that the parent center processes that request. \n73.  The two Parent Information Specialists who were deposed described some ofthe \nsituations in which they suggest parents may consider special education as follows.  Georgette \nRodriguez may suggest a referral for special education if there is a pattern of retentions or \nbehavior concerns. Monica Lopez stated that if a child is being retained for a second time she \nsuggested the child be evaluated for special education. \n74.  Rodriguez testified in her deposition that she had been contacted by parents, \nteachers and an assistant principal who told her that they had not been successful at getting \nspecial education referrals processed. \n75.  A secretary in the Parent Information Center, currently Donna Maras, receives \nreferrals for special education at Central Office.  Ms. Maras is housed in the MPS Parent Center, \ndescribes her Child Find duties as taking referrals from administrators, nurses, physicians, social \nservice agencies and parents.  During the school year she gets on average eight to ten referrals \nper week.  In the summer time that number rises to fifteen to twenty because most school \nbuildings are closed so parents come to central office to initiate referrals. \n76.  When Ms. Maras gets a referral, she fills out a referral form and then sends it  to \nthe child's school or if the child is not in school she sends it to the school closest to the home \naddress.  During the summer, the referral is sent to the summer special education team.  She \nenters the referral into the district-wide Encore database.  At this point, it is the responsibility of \nthe building coordinator and special education supervisor at that particular school to begin the \nevaluation process.  MPS policy is that the building coordinator and special education \nsupervisor conduct follow-ups to ensure the 90 day time-line from referral to placement is met. \n27 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 27 of 40   Document 267\n\n77.  If a parent seems hesitant to make a special education referral Ms. Maras asks \nthem if they want to do a screening instead.  It is district policy that she fills out a screening form \nand sends it to the building coordinator who then contact the parents to set up an interview to \ndiscuss their child's issues and if appropriate, conduct an evaluation of their child by the \nappropriate professionals. \n78.  Two additional staff members receive and distribute special education referrals \nsubmitted to the Milwaukee Public School Support Center, a facility separate from the Central \nOffice where the Parent Center is located.  Plaintiffs requested copies ofthe complaint intake \ncards filled out by Parent Information Specialists in the MPS Parent Center located at MPS \nCentral Office.  They fill out blue cards for what they label as special education complaints and \nyellow cards for what they label as regular education complaints.  The use of blue and yellow \ncomplaint cards was discontinued in the 2004-05 school year. \nE.  Additional Child Find Practices for Specific Target Groups \ni.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong Students With Behavioral Issues \n79.  The 2004-2005 MPS district policy regarding disciplinary removal procedures, \nDuties of the Administrator Responsible for Discipline, requires MPS staff to consider, in \nsituations where a student has been removed for more than ten days in a school year, whether the \nchild should be suspected of having a disability.  Paragraph 8 of the policy provides, \"if the \nstudent does not have an IEP and is not in the referral process but has been removed more than \nI 0 days, the student may be in need of consideration for a special education or Section 504 \nevaluations.  In such cases, the staff will need to consult with the building coordinator or Special \nServices Supervisor/Administrator regarding possible 'Child Find' obligations under IDEA and \nSection 504.\" \n28 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 28 of 40   Document 267\n\n80.  The MPS central office provides periodic training for teachers on classroom \nbehavioral management, accommodations, and modifications to assist nonpublic and private \nschool teachers with learning strategies to deal with challenging behaviors.  Outreach by the \ncentral office also takes the form of meetings with nonpublic and private agencies/programs \nregarding special education procedures.  For example, during the 2004-05 school year, MPS \nprovided four staff development opportunities at no cost to staff members ofthe Milwaukee-area \nnon-public schools.  One of these trainings was on Child Find Activities. \nii.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Stndents Who May Have \nDisabilities Among Children Birth -Three Years Old \n81.  MPS has an Early Childhood Assessment Team (\"ECAT\").  The ECAT team is \naccountable for ensuring that evaluations are completed and IEPs are held in a timely manner \nprior to the child transitioning to MPS at age three.  The ECAT team receives referrals from \nHead Start, Birth to 3 programs, hospitals, physicians, and parents. The ECAT team currently \nhas two part-time and 1 full-time Special Education Supervisors and four Diagnostic Teachers. \nA centralized database manages data for children in birth to 3 (Part C) programs who are \ntransferring into MPS to assist in evaluation and indicates whether the 90 day timeline is being \nmet, or whether there is a valid extension for a child-related reason. \n82.  MPS's data reflects that about 90 percent of the children referred to MPS from the \nbirth to three agencies qualify for special education. \n83.  During the school year the Early Childhood Assessment Team (ECAT) gets about \nten referrals from outside the Birth to Three network that come through Child Find at central \noffice. During the summer months the ECAT gets about 30 cases through the Child Find at \ncentral office for referral. \n29 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 29 of 40   Document 267\n\n84.  ECAT gives out Head Start information resources as outreach at IEP meetings. \nMPS houses a Head Start program office at Central office under the direction of the office of \npupil services that coordinates Head Start programs throughout the city. \n85.  ECAT   gives developmental milestone charts that have the MPS and Birth to 3 \nreferral phone numbers on them to day care centers when they go to the centers to do special \neducation evaluations. \n86.  During the period of April2004-May 2005, the MPS website had inaccurate \ninformation as to the age at which children can be referred for a special education evaluation at \none location on the website, on one page titled \"Special Education Kindergarten.\"  This \ninformation has been corrected.  The website also contained multiple places where the accurate \ninformation was posted, such as the Special Education Parent Information Pages. \niii.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong Students with Attendance Issues \n87.  Weekly truancy reports are generated by school and central office administrators, \nincluding principals, vice principals, and special services administrators.  Each school is required \nto have a building Truancy Intervention Coordinator (i.e., social worker, psychologist, or another \nidentified person) who is responsible to monitor these weekly reports, contact and meet with the \nparents, work with regular education teachers, and encourage students to attend school. \n88.  Jon VanSteckleman, a social worker, is assigned to the community truancy \nabatement project (the TABS program).  Also, it is MPS policy that its social workers work in \nthe community providing training and assessing individual student needs, with the goal of \nbringing the student back to school and determining what types of services may be needed, \nincluding possible referral to special education. \n30 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 30 of 40   Document 267\n\niv.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong Students Characterized as \"At-Risk\" \n89.  MPS has numerous programs and policies that target at risk students in the \ngeneral education school population that may need special education or non-special education \nassistance in order to succeed at school. \n90.  MPS policy provides that teachers may bring concerns about students who are in \ndanger of being retained to the school learning team, the collaborative support team, or problem \nsolving team to determine what interventions might be needed, including possible referral to \nspecial education.  It is MPS policy that the teacher or principal also holds conversations with the \nparents about the child's needs and possible retention. \nv.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong Students Homeless Youth \n91.  MPS has two liaisons that work with the community to identify homeless children \nand to provide needed services.  These liaisons work in the DSS and inform other DSS staff if \nthey suspect that any homeless child may have a disability and be in need of special services.  If \nso, a special education referral is initiated. \nvi.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong Students Adjudicated Youth \n92.  MPS employs staff who work with the adjudicated youth programs. \n93.  It is MPS policy that MPS school psychologists also work with staff from the \ncommunity mental health programs to provide information regarding the special education \nprocess, procedures, and services of the MPS. \nvii.  MPS' Actions to Assist in Identifying Students Who May Have Disabilities \nAmong those Student Who Drop Out \n94.  The MPS's computerized Special Education Data Information System provides \nongoing data regarding students who drop out of school for the school principals, Leadership \n31 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 31 of 40   Document 267\n\nSpecialists, Special Education Supervisors, and SELLS.  It is MPS policy that schools are to \nmonitor this data to determine trends and reasons for dropping out. \nF.  Technology/Data Management \n95.  MPS utilizes new technologies to improve tracking and accessibility of special \neducation related information.  For example, since 2001 MPS has been developing and is \nimplementing a web-based data management systems known as the SSIMS/ Encore system. \nThis system allows both building and district level staff to access a student's education records \nelectronically at any time, including behavioral and academic records.  This technological \nimprovement will allow MPS staff to review records immediately when MPS students transfer \nintra-district.  MPS expects the IEP viewing and development web-based option to be fully \noperational by October 2005.  As a large urban district, MPS has a high mobility rate. \n96.  MPS tracks all IDEA complaints and parental special education concerns, as well \nas their resolutions, are tracked on the Parent Dispute Resolution System (PDRS).  PDRS is a \nweb-based database that allows convenient, real-time access at the district and building level of \nthe processing and resolution of special education related complaints.  PDRS was functional as \nof September 1, 2004.  Per MPS policy, the use ofPDRS, became mandatory as ofJanuary 1, \n2004.  Those complaints not logged in PDRS from September !-December 31,2003, were \nrecorded on complaint cards at the Parent Center. \n97.  Compliance with the 90-day timeline for evaluating students for special education \nneeds is tracked using the SSIMS/Encore system.  It is MPS policy that special education \nsupervisors generate and review reports from Encore weekly to determine what progress is being \nmade on each referral and identify and resolve potential issues, should they occur. \n98.  Referrals for special education evaluation are tracked within the MPS Special \nServices Information Management System.  It is MPS policy that Special Education Supervisors \n32 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 32 of 40   Document 267\n\nwork with building administration and are accountable for making sure that the Child Find \nprocess is actually being implemented-monitoring timelines and determining whether referrals \nare being submitted and processed in an appropriate way. \n99.  One of the elements of the Special Education Oversight Action Plan (\"SOAP\") \nadopted by the MPS Board of Directors in June 2002 was the recognition that data management \nis an important component of any accountability system. \n100.  MPS is implementing a web-based computerized Special Services Information \nManagement System-that begins with referral and goes through the entire special education \nprocess.  The electronic Special Services Information Management System has two \ncomponents-a database system called Encore, which is fully operational, and the web-based \ndevelopment of the IEP document system, which MPS expects to be fully operational in October \n2005. \n101.  The Encore database system has been operational since August I, 2003.  It \nprovides information such as demographic information about students with disabilities being \nserved, evaluation timelines, numbers of certified staff, and school discipline actions, including \nsuspensions and expulsions. \n102.  The web-based IEP document system is live, and provides authorized personnel to \nhave access to the child's IEP-with data that is inputted directly from the child's referral by \nBuilding Coordinators and appropriate MPS staff who conduct assessments, send invitations to \nIEP meetings, document participation in the IEP meetings, and document the content of the IEP \ndevelopment and the IEP process.  MPS expects the web-based IEP system to be fully \noperational in October 2005.  In the meantime, MPS is still using a computer-based program to \ndevelop and document the IEP process and content. \n33 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 33 of 40   Document 267\n\n103.  With both the current IEP computer-based system and the Encore system, it is \nMPS policy that the Special Education Supervisor, Diagnostic Teachers(s), and SELLS identify \nwhen an evaluation is getting close to the 90-day timeline and work proactively to make sure \ntimelines are met.  An IEP meeting may be convened to determine ifthere was any harm caused \nby an exceeded timeline.  It is MPS policy that follow-up for staff errors are dealt with during the \nstaff evaluation process. \nIII.  MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE \nA.  MPS Complaint Resolution Process \n104.  One of the elements of the Special Education Oversight Action Plan (\"SOAP\") \nadopted by the MPS Board of Directors in June 2002 with DPI's direction was the creation of a \nParental Dispute Resolution System. \n105.  It is MPS policy that each school principal is responsible for implementing and \nmonitoring a dispute resolution process in their schools.  Parents with a complaint may file an \nMPS complaint with their school principal.  Parent complaints are promptly addressed and \nresolved at the school site, if possible.  If a principal cannot resolve a complaint within five \nschool days of the receipt of the written or verbal complaint, immediate intervention is requested \nfrom a SELL.  The SELL must resolve the matter within five days ofthe request for intervention \nand may consult with the leadership specialist for that school, if necessary. \n106.  It is MPS policy that if the SELL determines that a violation of state or federal \nspecial education law has occurred, the SELL will consult with the Leadership Specialist, and the \nschool principal will be directed to correct the violation. \n107.  The Director of the DSS, Patricia Yahle, monitors parent complaints on a regular \nbasis.  If she sees a number of complaints in a particular school, she contacts the SELL or the \n34 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 34 of 40   Document 267\n\nLeadership Coach that works with the principal.  It is MPS policy that these contacts lead to \nspecific interventions by the principal as well as discussions with the DSS management team to \nbe certain that there is sensitivity and attention to the complaint issues, location ofthese issues, \nand their resolution.  As part of the monthly report to the Board of Directors on the \nimplementation of the SOAP, the Chief of Pupil Services, Ada Rivera, presents a summary ofthe \ndata in the school and Parent Service Center complaint logs, including the number of complaints, \nthe issues, resolutions achieved, and actions to improve the dispute resolution system in any \nschool. \n108.  It is MPS policy that a parent may also choose to file a complaint with the Parent \nInformation Center.  The District's Parent Information Center is currently staffed by nine Parent \nInformation Specialists, who are charged with assisting parents in the resolution of their issues. \nEach ofthe Parent information Specialists works with 30-40 schools. DPI provides financial \nsupport to MPS for some Parent Information Center staffing. \n109.  It is MPS policy that parents are encouraged, but not required to make their \ncomplaint in writing. School principals maintain a log of each complaint at their school.  The \nParent Information Center also maintains a log of complaints received and referred on to the \nappropriate school for resolution. \nII 0.  School principals have ongoing access to information regarding the total number \nof complaints, complaint issues, and content regarding specific complaints within a recently \ndeveloped electronic Special Services Information Management System.  The complaint is sent \nthrough PDRS to the principal when an IDEA and/or Parent Information Center complaint has \nbeen filed. \n35 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 35 of 40   Document 267\n\nIll.  On June 27, 2002, in a companion resolution to the one that created SOAP, the \nMPS Board of Directors adopted Resolution (0203R-018), which provided for the appointment \nof an individual to be the District Exceptional Education Ombudsman-in the event that MPS \nreceives complaints that cannot be resolved by the DSS. \n112.  It is MPS policy that parental complaints must be taken into account by each \nschool, through the Parent and Community Involvement/Partnerships section of each school's \nSEP.  Each school must describe and conduct twice yearly self-assessments of the dispute \nresolution process within the school.  Monitoring ofthe dispute resolution process is carried out \nin the central office review of all SEPs. \n113.  The IDEA Complaints Manager (Equitable Education Opportunity Liaison), \nRichard Brigham, manages a web-based dispute resolution database that is integrated across \nIDEA complaints to DPI, mediations, and due process hearings. School principals and assistant \nprincipals also have access to the database through a password.  This integrated data system also \ntracks informal complaints that are resolved before they become an IDEA complaint.  Schools \ncan access this data regularly in order to look across complaints, mediations, and due process \nissues in order to improve school programs.  This integrated dispute resolution data can assist in \nfollowing up formal complaints resolution, mediation agreements, and due process hearing \ndecisions to determine whether child issues are being resolved. \n114.  Under Federal law, formal complaints can be filed with DPI, the state educational \nagency (\"SEA\").  When an IDEA complaint received by DPI is forwarded to MPS, the \nCoordinator of the Office of Complaints assigns a citywide Program Support Teacher to \npromptly gather documents and other information needed by the DPI to investigate the \ncomplaint. The SELL assists in the investigation, if necessary, to ensure prompt responses to the \n36 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 36 of 40   Document 267\n\ncomplaint.  A letter over the MPS Superintendent's signature is sent to the appropriate school \nprincipal directing him/her to cooperate in investigating and resolving the complaint. If the \ncomplaint is substantiated by the DPI, the citywide program support teacher assists the school in \nimplementing the corrective action plan in a timely manner. The SELL may assist, if necessary, \nin assuring a timely response. \n115.  In addition to complaints resolution, mediation, and due process hearings as a way \nto resolve disputes, MPS is currently piloting facilitated IEPs as a less formal dispute resolution \nsystem and a way to resolve differences between parents and schools at the IEP level.  MPS's \ngoal is to intervene with concerns before they become a formal complaint. \nB.  Development and Implementation of MPS Internal Auditing System \n116.  On July 12, 2002, DPI sent a letter to the MPS Director of Special Services \nacknowledging the district's recent adoption of SOAP, offering MPS two additional special \neducation team members to assist MPS with the implementation of SOAP, and directing MPS \nthat the district's continuing procedural implementation errors identified in DPI's on-site \nmonitoring and the issues in the CCAPs had to be among the first issues addressed by the special \neducation oversight process in each school building. The letter advised MPS that DPI would be \nworking with MPS staff during the month of August, 2002, to develop a strategic plan to \nimplement SOAP, with an initial focus on the special education procedural oversight provisions \nof SOAP. \n117.  During the 2002-2003 school year, DPI focused its MPS oversight activities on \nbuilding MPS' compliance capacity through the implementation of SOAP and the development \nof the MPS Internal Audit Action Plan, later renamed the MPS CIFM Action Plan.  During that \nsame school year DPI did not conduct on-site monitoring activities using the on-site monitoring \nmodel acknowledged by OSEP in its 2000 monitoring ofDPI's oversight.  Where DPI found any \n37 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 37 of 40   Document 267\n\ncompliance problems at this time, it ordered corrective action through the mechanism of IDEA \ncomplaint decisions and directives, and their modifications to the CCAPs. \n118.  On September 9, 2002, DPI and MPS agreed on a plan that focused MPS's \nimplementation of SOAP on the correction ofthe implementation errors identified by DPI in its \n2001-2002 school year on-site monitoring reports, and identified by DPI in the IDEA complaint \nCCAPs.  These errors were not necessarily the same as the allegations in this lawsuit.  The plan, \nentitled \"Milwaukee Public Schools Internal Audit Action Plan,\" summarized the \nimplementation errors to be corrected, described in detail the corrective activities MPS was \nobligated to perform, the date by which each corrective activity should be completed, the person \nor persons responsible for completing the activity, the documentation required as part ofthe \nactivity, and the information that MPS was required to provide to demonstrate that the required \ncorrective activity had corrected the identified errors. \n119.  Like the SOAP itself, the Internal Audit Action Plan contained two main \ncomponents.  One part of the Plan required each MPS school to address the implementation \nerrors identified by DPI through the process of including compliance improvement in the \nschool's SEP, trained self-assessment of the school's performance, and revision of the SEP based \non the results of the school's self-assessment.  The other part of the Plan required MPS to \nestablish an ongoing system of internal audit that addresses the implementation errors found by \nDPI.  The Plan required that the system be implemented first in a pilot group of schools, \nincluding the nine schools visited during DPI's 2001-2002 school year on-site monitoring, and \nthen be implemented in every MPS school in the 2002-2003 school year.  The Plan required the \nsetting of compliance standards, the training ofMPS staff to perform at the identified standards, \n38 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 38 of 40   Document 267\n\nthe training of special education supervisory personnel to reliably evaluate staff compliance with \nthe standards, and a feedback mechanism to improve staff performance. \n120.  In the 2002-2003 school year, MPS used the IEP checklist system in 18 pilot \nschools.  At the completion of the pilot, MPS did not provide DPI with a report on the \nassessment or the results. \n121.  The Internal Audit Action Plan was revised in January 2003 to include a total of \neighteen schools in the initial phase ofthe district's accountability system.  The Plan was revised \nagain in March 2003 to reflect the completion of some of the Plan activities. \n122.  In November 2003, the plan was renamed \"MPS Continuous Improvement and \nFocused Monitoring Action Plan\" (\"MPS CIFM Action Plan\"), and was  revised to reflect the \ncompletion of activities during the 2002-2003 school year and to add additional activities for the \n2003-2004 school year.  The format of the MPS CIFM Action Plan was also changed to \nspecifically identify whether an activity had been completed, and to specify the target dates for \nDPI's verification of the efficacy of the required corrective activities. \n123.  The MPS CIFM Action Plan was revised again in February 2004, to reflect the \ncompletion of many of the additional activities required by the November 2003 revision. \n124.  During the 2003-2004 school year, the MPS CIFM Action Plan consisted of five \nparts: (1) A system for continuous training of staff using the MPS Special Education Record \nReview Checklist method that summarizes the procedural requirements of special education law \nthat MPS had been erroneously implementing; (2) an annual point-in-time assessment in each \nschool of the school's compliance with the checklist requirements; (3) an annual assessment \nabout the systems and knowledgeable personnel in each school with respect to non-checklist \ncompliance matters such as IEPs, discipline practices, and non-attendance policies; (4 ) actions \n39 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 39 of 40   Document 267\n\ndeveloped annually for each school and included in each school's School Education Plan, based \non the results of the school's annual assessment; and (5) a district-wide support plan for the \nschools, developed after analyzing the data from the annual building assessments, to identify \ndistrict-wide actions to support each school's effort to improve its compliance performance on \nthe checklist and non-checklist items. \n125.  IEP checklist monitoring was implemented as a staff development activity for \nspecial education teachers and other IEP team members.  This activity was ongoing throughout \nthe 2003-2004 school year.  Individual teachers received in-service training or staff development \nand then the Special Education Supervisors conducted checklist monitoring on their IEPs until \nthey achieved three correct IEPs in a row. After that the Supervisors and/or other building \nadministrators did intermittent checks of each person's completed IEPs, and the SELLs reviewed \nthe Supervisors' work. \n126.  Implementation of non-checklist requirements not readily assessed via IEP record \nreview alone in a school, including IEP, Discipline, and Non-attendance were more operational \nin nature.  Staff developments on the non-checklist items were provided throughout the school \nyear. These compliance elements were monitored through interviews, and document reviews. At \nthe end of calendar year 2003, each SELL held a conference with the Special Education \nSupervisor members of his/her team to survey and discuss the status of the non-checklist items. \nIf problem areas were identified, the SELL and the supervisor conferred with the building \nprincipal to develop activities within 30 calendar days of the meeting.  Another conference \namong these parties was held within 30 calendar days of initiating the activities.  This plan was \nincorporated into Section 11 of the SEP in each school building. \n40 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 40 of 40   Document 267\n\n127.  DPI and the MPS mutually developed the forms, procedures, standards, and \nguidance to gather self-assessment data for the March 2004 point-in-time assessment in each \nMPS school.  Data gathered through the March school self-assessment was based on a series of \nsamples of student records or personnel, drawn using a published, random sampling table. \n128.  DPI provided MPS technical assistance in developing the tools for the assessment. \nThis involved working with the SELLs to compile a checklist to evaluate compliance with \nprocedural requirements when checking a student's records.  The checklist consisted of issues \nfrom past DPI monitoring and from the pre-existing Consolidated Corrective Action Plans \n(CCAPs). \n129.  The checklist contained all of the issues from the 2000, 2001 and 2002 on-site \nreviews that DPI found to be out of compliance. \n130.  The assessment also used non-checklist items to assess issues related to \nimplementation and to gather more in-depth information. \n131.  The March 2004 self-assessment within each school was conducted by the Special \nEducation Supervisor(s) assigned to the school, the school principal, the school building \ncoordinator, and other school staff.  Special Education Supervisors and building coordinators did \nthe bulk of the assessments in the schools. \n132.  During the continuous portion of CIFM in 2003-2004, SELLs reviewed actual \nIEPs and completed the checklist process.  During the point-in-time portion of CIFM in March \n2004, the SELLs were not required to review IEPs for accuracy of the supervisor's reporting. \nBeginning in the 2004-2005 school year, MPS policy changed to require all SELLs to check each \nunderlying IEP to determine if the special education supervisor accurately recorded monitoring \ndata. \n41 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 1 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n133.  In April2004, MPS policy required each SELL to review the monitoring work of \neach of the Special Education Supervisors in the schools in his/her team.  It was MPS policy that \nfor each Special Education Supervisor, the SELL reviewed a random sample of the assessment \ninstruments the Supervisor completed for one of the Supervisor's schools. \n134.  Although the SELLs reviewed some of the underlying student records during the \n2003-2004 school year, the focus of SELLs' April 2004 review was whether the assessment \nmethods for checklist and non-checklist items were being implemented appropriately by the \nSupervisors.  It is MPS policy that if a SELL determined that a Special Education Supervisor did \nnot follow the methods given for one or more of the items of the non-checklist elements relating \nto the still-open CCAPs (IEP, Discipline, Placement, and Nonattendance) or the methods for the \nchecklist items, the SELL checked that particular item in all of the Special Education \nSupervisor's schools to determine whether the assessment plan's procedures and methods were \nfollowed. \n135.  Once the self-assessments were completed, the Special Education Supervisors and \nthe SELLS scored each of the 62 checklist items measured by the school as requiring one of \nthree levels for monitoring support-periodic review (95% or greater compliance), ongoing \nreview (80-94% compliance), or intensive monitoring (below 80% compliance).  Some schools \nwere at different levels of support for different checklist items.  This assigned level of support \nfor each of the 62 compliance items was also used as a basis for planning district-wide \nprofessional development activities. \n136.  An average percentage of compliance of all checklist items combined was also \nassigned to each school and an overall level of required support was assigned to each school. \nThis data was used to plan individual school oversight activities for Special Education \n42 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 2 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nSupervisors and the SELLs.  In addition, this information was provided to the Departments of \nAdministrative Accountability and Principal Leadership Support to assist in planning coaching \nsupport activities and evaluation oversight for administrative staff. \n137.  Each school principal received a summary of their individual rankings for all \nchecklist and non-checklist items.  In addition, the school rankings were compared to overall \ndistrict-wide averages.  This data was shared with the SELLs and Special Education Supervisors \nto help them plan targeted staff development. \n138.  Following receipt of their school data, the principals were required to develop a \nplan, including goals and actions, to remediate or address any of the 62 checklist or non-checklist \nitems that were measured below 95% compliance.  Principals were not required to develop a \nremediation plan for compliance items assessed at 95% or higher compliance (\"periodic review\" \nlevel of support), even though the district goal is 100% compliance in all schools. This plan was \nincorporated into the Special Education Section of each school's overall SEP.  The SELLs and \nthe Special Education Supervisors conducted follow-up meetings with school principals and SEP \nrepresentatives, as needed, for the purpose of amending or strengthening the special education \ncomponent of the SEP. \n139.  In August 2004, DSS reported to the MPS Board of Directors the activities each \nschool would be required to complete with respect to the compliance areas assessed at the \nschool, depending on whether the compliance area was assessed as intensive monitoring (less \nthan 80% compliance), ongoing support (80-94% compliance) or periodic review (95% or higher \ncompliance). \n140.  On August 26, 2004 the Milwaukee Board of School directors directed the \nadministration to adopt the following policy:  For items assessed as requiring \"intensive \n43 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 3 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nmonitoring,\" MPS required the individual school's SEP committee to review, revise and \nimplement the SEP's special education continuous improvement plan for each checklist and non \nchecklist item assessed to be at the \"intensive monitoring\" level, with the focus on improving the \nbuilding's performance.  Special education providers and diagnostic teachers who would be \nreturning to the building for the 2004-2005 school year were required to undergo review of their \nIEPs for all checklist items that were contained in their SEP; i.e., items for which compliance \nwas less than 95%.  Special education supervisors who determined that particular returning \nspecial education providers and diagnostic teachers required additional support applied the IEP \nchecklist review procedure to those returning staff.  Special education providers new to the \nbuilding were required to undergo review of their IEP's for all items of the IEP checklist \nprocedure.  The support plan further required SELLs to apply the activities required by the \nschool's SEP special education improvement plan by December 1, 2004, in anticipation of the \nMarch 2005 annual assessment. \n141.  On August 26, 2004 the Milwaukee Board of School directors directed the \nadministration to adopt the following policy:  For items assessed as requiring \"ongoing support,\" \nMPS required the school's SEP committee, the special education providers, the diagnostic \nteachers, and the SELLS to conduct the same activities as they conducted for items assessed as \n\"intensive monitoring.\" \n142.  On August 26,2004 the Milwaukee Board of School directors directed the \nadministration to adopt the following policy:  For items assessed as requiring \"periodic review,\" \nMPS allowed the school to not include the items in its SEP.  For schools with new principals, \nMPS required the SELLS to complete the pre-measurement activities by December 1, 2004, \nincluding non-checklist items and the implementation of the school's SEP Special Education \n44 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 4 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nContinuous hnprovement Plan.  MPS required special education providers and diagnostic \nteachers returning to the building to use the record review checklist at least once per semester for \ncompliance items at the \"periodic review\" level.  MPS further required those returning personnel \nwho made errors on periodic review checklist items to be subjected to continuous review until \nthree consecutive IEPs are correct.  Special education providers who are new to the building are \nrequired to undergo review of their IEPs for all items of the IEP checklist procedure.  MPS \nrequired SELLs to confer, no later than December I, 2004, with the special education supervisor \nassigned to the building on all non-checklist items assessed at the periodic review level, and to \nconfer with building principals if problem items are identified, and to complete activities to \ncorrect the problems within 30 days. \n143.  After the March 2004 assessment, DPI staff evaluated whether each SELL carried \nout his/her work consistent with the training DPI had provided the SELLs, by reviewing the \nforms the SELL had completed for one of the SELL's schools. \n144.  The results of the overall assessment indicate compliance concerns including the \nfollowing findings.  The following findings are not limited to the allegations in this lawsuit. \na.  Half ofMPS schools (50.6%) merit ongoing oversight. \nb.  I 0.9% need intensive monitoring, including 25% of high schools and 28% \nof middle schools. \nc.  61.5% ofMPS schools either merit intensive monitoring or ongoing \noversight. \n145.  As measured by MPS standards, the MPS district as a whole is 90.05% compliant \nand merits ongoing oversight. \n146.  The MPS CIFM Action Plan was revised in September, 2004, to reflect activities \ncompleted during the 2003-2004 school year, and to include activities for the 2004-2005 school \nyear. \n45 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 5 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n147.  As with the original MPS CIFM Action Plan and subsequent revisions, MPS was \nrequired to address IDEA requirements identified as \"not implemented\" during the DPI May \n2000, May 2001 and May 2002 on-site compliance reviews, and was required to address the \nissues identified in the IDEA complaint CCAPs. \n148.  The September 2004 MPS CIFM Action Plan required MPS to conduct refresher \ntraining for the SELLS and for returning building-level reviewers, on the checklist and non-\nchecklist requirements, the checklist system, and the support level requirements for \nnoncompliance items.  The September 2004 plan also required the SELLs to train new building \nlevel and other reviewers on these areas. \n149.  The September 2004 MPS CIFM Action Plan required MPS to evaluate the same \nspecific checklist and non-checklist items as were in the original September 2002 Internal Audit \nSystem Action Plan in its March 2005 annual self-assessment. \n150.  The September 2004 MPS CIFM Action Plan required MPS to complete a \nbuilding-level support plan for its buildings. \n151.  MPS has submitted, and DPI has approved a District-Level Support Plan which \nidentifies MPS's 2004-2005 numerical objectives in 14 specific compliance areas, identifies the \nspecific activities MPS will engage in to reach its numerical objectives, and which identifies the \ncriteria by which DPI will measure MPS's success and identifies the March 2005 point-in-time \nself-assessment as the process by which MPS's achievement will be evaluated. \n152.  For the March 2005 self-assessment, DPI required MPS to address the following \nitems related to Child Find: \na.  \"The child's parent attended the meeting to determine whether the child is \nor continues to be a child with a disability or participated by other means, \nsuch as individual or conference telephone calls; or if the child's parent \ndid not attend or participate by other means in the meeting to determine \n46 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 6 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nwhether the child is a child with a disability, there is a record of attempts \nto arrange a mutually agreeable time and place.\" \nb.  \"LEA representative attended the meeting(s) to determine whether the \nchild is a child with a disability.\" \n153.  With respect to the first item above- whether the parent attends or otherwise \nparticipates in initial and/or subsequent IEP team meetings-the 2004-2005 MPS Continuous \nImprovement Focused Monitoring District-Level Support Plan provides the following objective: \n\"MPS will reach the periodic review level for 100% of the parent participation items.\" \n154.  With respect to the second item above-whether the LEA representative attends \ninitial and/or subsequent IEP team meetings-the 2004-2005 MPS Continuous Improvement \nFocused Monitoring District-Level Support Plan provides the following objectives:  (!) \"95% of \nall IEP's (initial and reevaluations) developed between September 2004 and March 24, 2005, \nwill include the participation of a regular education teacher and a representative of the local \neducational agency (LEA) in the review of data and determination ofthe possible need for \nadditional testing;\" and (2) \"The District will achieve 99% LEA participation in all IEP team \nmeetings.\" \n155.  During fall2004, DPI consultants Elliott Weiman and Janice Duff met with MPS \nemployee Paul Pelzek to revise the annual building assessment for 2005 based upon \nrecommendations from MPS supervisors and SELLs and DPI staffs experience with the 2004 \nMPS annual building assessment.  Changes were made to procedures and the use of information \ntechnology was planned.  DPI and MPS analysis of the 2004 annual building assessment \nidentified a need for additional training related to discipline requirements.  In January 2005, DPI \nconsultants Janice Duff and Brent Odell trained MPS supervisors on annual building assessment \nitems relating to discipline requirements.  DPI consultants Janice Duff, Elliott Weiman, Brent \nOdell and Anita Castro participated in the February 2005 training ofMPS supervisors regarding \n47 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 7 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nthe standards and procedures for the annual building assessment.  Also in February 2005, DPI \nconsultants Janice Duff and Elliott Weiman trained DPI consultants Lynn Boreson, Jack Marker, \nBrent Odell and Teresa Goodier to conduct oversight activities to assess the reliability of the \nMPS annual building assessment. \n156.  In March, 2005 DPI completed oversight activities to assess the reliability of the \nMPS annual building assessments. DPI reviewed individual student records, including IEP team \nrecords related to individual students, and interviewed special education supervisors and SELLs \nabout their assessment activities. \n157.  In March, 2005 the DPI consultants trained in February assessed the reliability of \nthe MPS annual building assessment.  One school was selected for each of the nine SELLs.  In \nthe schools selected, DPI assessed each item in the MPS annual building assessment to \ndetermine whether the item was reliably assessed by the SELL and the special education \nsupervisor.  DPI staff selected student records from the sample of student records assessed by \nMPS.  DPI staff reviewed these student records to determine whether DPI staff agreed with the \nMPS staff about compliance for each item in the annual building assessment.  Non-checklist \nitems in the annual building assessment are addressed through interview in addition to or in lieu \nof records reviewed.  To assess items addressed through interviews, DPI staff interviewed the \nschool's SELL and supervisor who conducted the interviews during the annual building \nassessment.  DPI staff determined whether MPS staff obtained relevant information upon which \nto make a reliable conclusion and whether MPS staff correctly applied the standard for each \nitem.  When DPI staff found an item was not reliably assessed, DPI staff provided feedback and \ntraining as part of the on-sight activities.  After completing on-sight activities in April2005, DPI \nstaff compiled for each SELL a list of items that may not have been reliably assessed.  DPI staff \n48 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 8 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nmet with the SELLs as a group and individually in April 2005 to discuss the lists and train them \non follow-up procedures.  Two SELLs, Claudia Weaver and Jim Lawton assessed all items. \nEach remaining SELL was provided an individual list of items which they had not reliably \nassessed in the building visited by DPI.  Each of those SELLs was instructed to reassess those \nitems in the school's visited by DPI and to use the new score for those schools.  Those SELLs \nwere also trained and instructed to test the reliability of the items on each of their lists in all of \ntheir other schools.  To test the reliability of those items, the SELL used the same procedure used \nby DPI to test the reliability of annual building assessments.  If the SELL found that an item was \nnot reliably assessed after testing, the SELL was instructed to reassess the item in the building \nand use the new score.  Where the assessment process revealed an error, DPI ordered MPS to \ncorrect the error by July I, 2005. \n158.  The MPS CIFM Action Plan was recently revised in April, 2005, to reflect the \ncompletion of many ofthe activities surrounding MPS's second district-wide, building-based \nassessment of each school's performance with respect to the checklist and non-checklist items; to \nreflect the completion of many ofDPI's activities to assess the reliability of those assessments, \nsuch as the review of IEP team records related to individual students and interviews of special \neducation supervisors and SELLs; and to identify additional activities that will occur. \nC.  MPS Data Regarding Untimely Evaluations \n159.  MPS provided WCA with two reports pertaining to Initial Referrals to Special \nEducation with Placement occurring after the legally required 90 day time-line. The first report is \ndated with referral Dates 6/1103-7/8/04. This is the most recent report of over-due evaluations \nreceived by WCA from MPS. \n160.  The first report mentioned in the previous finding, documents 114 IEP placement \noffer dates that were over the 90 day time-line. Past-due days range between 1 and 267 days. 58 \n49 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 9 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nchildren had evaluations that were overdue between 1 and 20 days. 44 children had IEP \nevaluations that were completed between 21-60 days past due. 5 children had evaluations that \nwere completed more than 90 days over due. One child had an initial evaluation that was 267 \ndays past due. No information is provided regarding the reason for the delay in initial evaluation. \nThe average past due number of days was 30 days. \n161.  The second report is an older report of special education evaluations that are past \nthe legally required 90 day time-line for completion. This report is dated 11118/03. The period of \nthe report is 8/23/95 through 6/30/03. \n162.  From page 6 through 43 of the report there were 978 past due initial evaluations \nfor the report dates of06/00 through 06/03. Overdue days ranged from I to 579. 68 children had \ntheir evaluations completed I 00 or more days past due. Two children had initial evaluations that \ntook 600 or more days to complete. The average days number of past due days is 37. \n163.  Additionally, in December 2004, the special education supervisory staff was \ntrained again regarding timely evaluations and compensatory services at Central Office.  The \ncurrent MPS IEP Team Procedural Handbook reflects district policy and procedures regarding \ntimely evaluations and compensatory education if those time lines are not met. \n164.  It is MPS policy that in order to ensure continued compliance with the evaluation \ntimeline, special education supervisors generate IEP activity reports through SSlMS/Encore on a \nweekly basis.  This report gives the supervisor information regarding all upcoming IEP activities \nin each building which allows them to monitor and comply with the 90-day timeline \nrequirements.  It is MPS policy that if an evaluation goes over the timeline without a valid \nextension, the supervisor must ensure that compensatory services are discussed at the initial IEP \n50 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 10 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nteam meeting if the student is found eligible for special education.  It is MPS policy that SELLs \nalso monitor this process. \nD.  Specific IDEA Complaints \n165.  DPI has ordered MPS to change its policies and procedures for special education \nreferrals when they are found to be deficient; e.g., in 2001, when it directed MPS to eliminate \npolicies that might have required MPS staff to take actions when making a referral that are not \nrequired in the law, and ordered MPS to clarify that when persons other than MPS staff request \nevaluations, the 90-day time line begins at the time any MPS staff member receives the written \nrequest. \n166.  Part ofDPI's oversight responsibility is to investigate and resolve special \neducation complaints against school districts. \n167.  Copies ofDPI's complaint investigation decisions from 1995 to the present time \ncan be found on DPI's website, http://www.dpi.state.wi.us/dpi/dlsea/een!complain.html. , except \nas noted on the web pages for each year's decisions. \n168.  Between January 1, 1995 and May 24, 2005, DPI has issued decisions in five \ncases where the issues related to initial referral, initial evaluation and the initial IEP Team \nmeeting. \n169.  In Case No. 01-001, a parent signed the MPS written request for an extension of \nthe 90-day timeline for completing an initial evaluation, but the district did not clarify her \nintentions in light of her not having checked one of the boxes on the form either consenting, or \nrefusing to consent, to the extension. On February 19, 2001, DPI ordered MPS to submit a \ncorrective action plan to ensure that the district evaluates children with a suspected disability in a \ntimely manner.  The case was closed on June 26, 2002, after DPI found acceptable progress in \n51 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 11 of 39   Document 267-2\n\naddressing the directives in the complaint decision, after its review ofMPS' corrective action \ndocumentation. \n170.  In Case No. 02-027, MPS convened an IEP team meeting with respect to a child \nwho had previously been determined to be eligible for special education for the purposes of \ndetermining whether the child continued to be eligible for special education, developing an \nannual IEP, and other issues.  The parents were present at the meeting.  The case did not involve \nan initial referral, evaluation, or IEP team meeting.  At the meeting, the child's mother requested \nan independent educational evaluation (\"lEE\"), but the district did not timely respond to the \nrequest.  On May 15, 2002, DPI directed MPS to notify DPI about the corrective action it would \nbe taking, and further directed MPS to revise its lEE policy to ensure that the district responds \nwithout unnecessary delay to a parent's request for an lEE, either by initiating a hearing to show \nits evaluation is appropriate or by ensuring that an lEE is provided at public expense.  The case \nwas closed on October 23,2002, after DPI approved MPS's corrective action measures. \n171.  In Case No. 02-031, DPI concluded on July 17, 2002, that MPS did not respond \ntimely to a private child welfare agency case manager's request for a special education initial \nevaluation of a child.  The case involved a miscommunication between a case manager and a \nschool psychologist. DPI ordered MPS to carry out a number of corrective actions including the \nprovision of training, evaluation of a child in a timely manner and inclusion of an appropriate \nitem in the Disability Digest on evaluation.  This case was closed on November 18, 2002 \nfollowing receipt ofMPS documentation that the required activities had been completed. \n172.  In Case No. 02-045, the child's mother requested an lEE following the initial IEP \nmeeting to determine the child's eligibility, develop an initial IEP, and determine an initial \nplacement.  MPS failed to respond to the parent's IEP request in a timely manner.  The case \n52 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 12 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nrelated to a parent request ofMPS made after the initial IEP team meeting.  On August 6, 2002, \nDPI directed MPS to engage in the same remedial activity with respect to lEE requests as it \nrequired in Case No. 02-027.  The case was closed on October 23, 2002, after DPI approved \nMPS's corrective action measures. \n173.  In Case No. 04-43, DPI issued a decision on November 8, 2004, in which it \ndetermined that MPS failed to complete the evaluation of a child referred for evaluation within \nthe 90-day timeline provided by state statute.  As a part of the corrective action, MPS distributed \na copy ofthe October 2004 revision of the \"IEP Team Procedural Handbook\" to all local \neducation agency representatives, special education providers, school psychologists, building \ncoordinators, special education leadership liaisons, special education supervisors, and student \nservices program administrators no later than December 3, 2004, and to provide DPI with written \nassurances by that same date that all noted staff were informed about referral procedures and \nrequirements.  DPI closed the case on May 2, 2005, following receipt ofMPS documentation \nthat the activities which DPI had ordered, had been carried out. \nE.  DPI On-Site Monitoring of MPS \ni.  DPI's On-Site Monitoring Of MPS, 1991 To 1997 Re-Authorization OfiDEA \n174.  In 1991, the Department of Public Instruction (\"DPI\") established a three-year on \nsite review cycle to evaluate Wisconsin school districts' compliance with the special education \nprocedural requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") and state \nlaw. \n175.  In October 1993, the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs (\"OSEP\") \nconducted an on-site review ofDPI's implementation ofthe IDEA.  As a result of the review, in \nwhich OSEP found DPI to be out of compliance with its obligations to adequately monitor \nschool districts' implementation of the IDEA, and before the second three-year review cycle \n53 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 13 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nbegan, OSEP required DPI to redesign its procedures for onsite review of school districts. \nReviews of school districts were suspended during the redesign period. \nii.  DPI's on-site Monitorinl! ofMPS, 1997-98 throu~:h 1999-2000 School Years. \n176.  IDEA was re-authorized in the summer of 1997, before the beginning of the third \nyear ofDPI's new six-year on-site review schedule.  Because of the numerous changes to special \neducation law, DPI's six-year on-site review process was suspended and compliance review \nefforts were refocused to assist Wisconsin school districts to understand and implement the new \nprovisions of IDEA. \n177.  During the 1997-98 school year, the DPI special education team provided state \nwide in-services to Wisconsin school districts to familiarize themselves with the new law and to \nassist them to develop and implement an IDEA '97 self-assessment and implementation plan \n(\"SAIP\").  During the 1997-98 school year, school districts completed an assessment of their \ncompliance with IDEA '97, and developed their plan to fully implement it. \n178.  During the summer of 1998, DPI disseminated to all school districts a model \nspecial education forms system to assist them in implementing special education procedures \ncorrectly and to efficiently document their procedural compliance.  With the exception of one \nschool building, MPS adopted DPI's model forms.  DPI again reviewed MPS' forms in the \nsummer of2000, and told MPS that its forms would be adequate ifMPS adopted DPI's June \n2000 forms updates.  DPI reviewed the forms from one MPS school, Milwaukee Education \nCenter, in February 2001.  DPI informed MPS that the school's forms failed to include prompts \nfor many items on DPI's forms checklist, and that some of the prompts on the forms were not \ninformative enough to adequately prompt the user. \n54 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 14 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n179.  During the fall of 1998, DPI staff conducted multipurpose statewide regional \nmeetings concerning the refocused compliance review process.  All school districts, including \nMPS, were required to attend the meetings.  In preparation for the meetings, school districts were \nrequired to complete a SAIP progress report.  Included in the reports were a description of the \ndistrict's progress on each element in the SAIP, parental involvement and empowerment, staff \ndevelopment activities regarding IDEA and the SAIP process, and the results ofDPI's required \nself-assessment of compliance with several of the new IDEA requirements through a review of \nstudent records.  The meetings gave DPI the opportunity to provide technical assistance \nregarding the interpretation of state and federal law, and refinements to the SAIP process to \ncorrect the implementation errors found in the record reviews. \n180.  DPI found in the Spring of 1998 that 17% ofMPS students with disabilities did \nnot have a current IEP in effect.  In addition, the evaluation logs MPS submitted to DPI showed \nthat only 81.1% of evaluations during the 1997-98 school year had been timely completed. \n181.  Throughout the 1998-1999 school year, DPI required MPS to take corrective \naction with respect to these issues, and required MPS to regularly provide DPI with data that \nreflected the extent ofMPS's compliance with the requirements to have current IEPs in effect \nand to timely complete student evaluations. \n182.  Between 1998 and 1999, DPI continued to receive complaints from individual \nstudents regarding MPS's duty to timely evaluate and MPS's duty to have current IEPs in effect. \n183.  On June 1,1999, DPI notified MPS that 7.4% ofMPS students did not have \ncurrent IEPs recorded in the district database as of December 1, 1998 and that many of its \nevaluations were untimely.  As a result, DPI notified MPS that the district would not receive \n$604,206 of its IDEA funds.  DPI further informed MPS that it would approve the use of IDEA \n55 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 15 of 39   Document 267-2\n\ndiscretionary funds only to resolve outstanding compliance issues.  DPI directed MPS to have a \ncurrent IEP in effect for all children and to eliminate the evaluation backlog prior to the \nbeginning of the 1999-2000 school year. \n184.  Also in June, 1999, DPI first consolidated its oversight of the corrective actions \nMPS had been ordered to take in response to substantiated IDEA complaints from individual \nstudents on the issue of timely evaluations.  On June 28, 1999, DPI sent a letter to MPS, stating: \n\"As you know, the department has five open complaints against MPS regarding timely \nevaluations (94-044, 98-050, 98-059,99-009, 99-014).  The department will consolidate its \noversight of necessary corrective action in those complaints and close each of the complaints \nwhen MPS documents: (1) compliance with any child-specific directive(s) in the decision, and \n(2) compliance with the two relevant directives issued in Superintendent Benson's letter of June \n1, 1999.\" \n185.  On July 7, 1999, DPI consolidated its oversight of the corrective actions MPS had \nbeen ordered to take in response to substantiated IDEA complaints from individual students on \nthe issue of current IEPs.  DPI's letter stated: \"As you know, the department has four open \ncomplaints against MPS regarding current IEPs in effect (97-045, 98-009, 98-049, 99-013).  The \ndepartment will consolidate its oversight of necessary corrective action in those complaints and \nwill consider the relevant issue closed when MPS documents: (I) compliance with any child \nspecific directive(s) in the decision, and (2) compliance with the two relevant directives issued in \nSuperintendent Benson's letter of June 1, 1999.\" \n186.  In August 1999, MPS provided DPI with data indicating that 99.7% of eligible \nstudents have current IEPs.  Also in August 1999, DPI verified that a sample of students all had \ncurrent IEPs.  In September 1999, DPI informed MPS that the district had corrected the violation \n56 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 16 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nof not having current IEPs in effect, and told MPS that it would continue to work with MPS to \nmaintain its progress.  In January 2000, DPI again verified that a sample of students had current \nIEPs.  In May 2000 on-site monitoring, DPI found that 98.3% of students had current IEPs.  In \nMay 2001 on-site monitoring, DPI reviewed a larger sample of children, and concluded that \n98.9% of students had current IEPs.  In May 2002 on-site monitoring, DPI concluded that \n99.61% of the reviewed sample of student records had current IEPs.  In March 2004, data from \nMPS' annual building assessment indicated that 98.4% of students had current IEPs. \n187.  Since June 1999, DPI has also continued to follow up on MPS's duty to timely \ncomplete evaluations.  In May 2000, DPI on-site monitoring revealed that 95.6% ofMPS's \nsampled evaluations were completed timely.  In July 2000, MPS evaluation logs submitted for \nDPI's review showed that 98.1% of evaluations initiated in January through March were \ncompleted timely.  Although DPI informed MPS in July 2000 that the issue of timely evaluations \nwas resolved, DPI has continued to require MPS to submit IEP team evaluation logs since the \nresolution of the issue. \n188.  The federal regulations implementing IDEA '97 were finalized in March 1999. \n189.  OSEP authorized DPI to continue its refocused on-site review process during the \n1999-2000 school year.  DPI conducted on-site reviews in 96 school districts, chosen to represent \n50% of total public school enrollment.  MPS was among the school districts chosen. \n190.  MPS and the other 95 districts performed a review of student records for the \npurpose of making a self-assessment of its compliance with IDEA requirements related to (a) \nparent participation in the individualized educational plan (\"IEP\") process; (b) participation in \nthe general curriculum; (c) IEP team composition, duties and accountability; (d) teacher \nknowledge of their IEP responsibilities; and (e) transition requirements for 14 year olds. \n57 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 17 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n191.  DPI expanded its 1999-2000 review ofMPS to include a review of IDEA \nviolations found through DPI's IDEA complaint investigations in MPS.  DPI reviewed MPS's (f) \nimplementation of student IEPs, (g) the completeness ofMPS evaluations and IEPs and the \ntimeliness ofMPS's notice to parents of their child's placement, and (h) the extent to which MPS \nstudents had IEPs in effect. \n192.  DPI conducted its 1999-2000 on-site review ofMPS by visiting three elementary \nschools, three middle schools and three high schools.  Ten student records were reviewed for \neach site.  DPI reviewers evaluated the soundness ofMPS's self-assessment of its IDEA 1997 \ncompliance, and also interviewed parents, regular education teachers, special education teachers, \nthe building principal and the special education supervisor for each site. \n193.  DPI's 1999-2000 on-site monitoring did not find implementation errors with \nrespect to issues (f), (g), and (h), above, but did find implementation errors in six other areas: \na.  Parental participation in the review of existing evaluation data to \ndetermine the need for additional testing during initial evaluations andre \nevaluations; \nb.  Explanations in IEPs ofthe extent to which students will participate in the \nregular education enviromnent and curriculum; \nc.  Proper description in IEPs of students' present level of educational \nperformance; \nd.  Proper statements in IEPs of students age 14 and older of transition service \nneeds; \ne.  LEA representative participation in IEP meetings; and \nf.  Proper annual goal progress reports for all students. \n194.  On October 26,2000, DPI approved MPS's CAP regarding the 1999-2000 on-site \nreview.  DPI accepted MPS' written verification of its completion of all corrective activities by \nthe summer of2001. \n58 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 18 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n195.  As part of the 1999-2000 on-site review process, DPI also reviewed MPS's \nspecial education forms.  DPI determined that, with the exception of some minor language \nchanges that were not inconsistent with state or federal law, MPS had adopted DPI's sample \nforms, and that MPS's forms were adequate. \niii.  DPI's on-site monitoring of MPS compliance with the requirements of IDEA \nand state law, 2000-2001 school year. \n196.  During the 2000-2001 school year, DPI conducted on-site reviews at MPS and 76 \nother school districts.  DPI designed the process to focus on core areas in IDEA '97 that were \nmost related to student outcomes, consistent with the emphasis in OSEP's Continuous \nImprovement Monitoring Process (\"CIMP\") which focused on federal, state and local resources \non improved results for children with disabilities and their families. \n197.  The core areas selected for review included those reviewed in the prior year's \nreview, and a review of other procedures related to: (a) annual goal statements; (b) behavior as a \nspecial factor; (c) discipline; (d) implementation ofiEPs; (e) children in residential care centers; \nand (f) educational environment and prevalence rates. \n198.  DPI expanded its on-site review ofMPS to include (g) MPS's progress in \nimplementing corrective activities resulting from the 1990-2000 review; (h) MPS's progress in \nimplementing corrective activities resulting from six IDEA complaint investigations concerning \nspecial education placements; (i) the efficacy ofMPS's corrective actions concerning special \neducation placement procedures and certain IEP team responsibilities of LEA representatives; (j) \nbuilding leadership staff and special education supervisors' knowledge of the IDEA disciplinary \nrequirements; and (k) the district's system for recording and tracking disciplinary removals of \nstudents. \n59 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 19 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n199.  As DPI did in 1999-2000, DPI reviewers reviewed records from three elementary, \nthree middle and three high schools, and interviewed parents, teachers and administrators. \n200.  DPI's 2000-2001 on-site monitoring ofMPS found implementation errors in six \nareas: \na.  documentation and notice of the review of existing data as part of initial \nand re-evaluations; \nb.  IEP content including present levels of educational performance and \nannual goal statements, documentation of students' participation in \nstatewide assessments, and statements of supplementary aids and services \nand program modifications and supports for school personnel; \nc.  placement procedures; \nd.  disciplinary removals of children for more than 10 days in a school year; \ne.  informing teachers with IEP responsibilities oftheir specific \nresponsibilities; and \nf.  policies and procedures for accepting and processing special education \nreferrals. \n201.  DPI required MPS (1) to complete the corrective activities in the district's 1999-\n2000 onsite review CAP and the CAPs related to IDEA complaints concerning placement; (2) to \ntake action to ensure that all LEA representatives understand their IEP role and responsibilities; \n(3) to continue staff development activities concerning special education placement procedures \nand the disciplinary requirements; and (4) to develop a plan to ensure that the district's methods \nfor documenting and tracking disciplinary removals of special education students from school for \nmore than 10 days in a school year protects their rights to a free and appropriate public education \n(\"F APE\"). \n202.  DPI's July 17, 2001 Jetter to MPS summarizing its 2000-2001 on-site monitoring \nfindings observed that MPS needed an effective centralized system of administrative \naccountability that reached down to the school building level in order to resolve the compliance \n60 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 20 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nissues DPI had found through on-site monitoring and its other oversight activities.  DPI stated \nthat it was encouraged that MPS had agreed to develop and implement such a system by \nSeptember 2001. and expressed its pleasure that the initial focus of the accountability system \nwould be on the unresolved compliance issues DPI and MPS had been discussing. \n203.  One ofDPI's findings in its 2000-2001 monitoring report specifically related to a \nMPS policy and procedure that could potentially delay the referral of a student suspected of \nbeing a child with a disability.  The district's policies in effect at the time might have required \ndistrict staff to take actions when making a referral that are not required in the law (i.e., a \nreasonable cause determination).  These actions might delay a referral by a staff member or \ninterfere with the duty to make a referral.  DPI instructed MPS that the district's policies and \nprocedures must make clear that these actions may not delay the referral when the referring \nperson reasonably believes the child is a child with a disability.  While MPS 's policies correctly \nexplained the 90-day evaluation time limit requirement following referrals from parents and \nothers, it did not clarify that the requirement also applies to referrals from district staff.  DPI \ntherefore directed MPS to add a clarification that any licensed school staff member who \nreasonably believes that a child has a disability is required to make a special education referral. \nIn addition, DPI directed MPS to add new policy language clarifying that any physician, nurse, \npsychologist, social worker, or administrator of a social agency who reasonably believes that a \nchild brought to him or her for services has a disability is required to refer the child to MPS. \nMoreover, DPI directed MPS to add policy language to clarify that when persons other than the \nschool district staff make a written referral to the district, the receipt of the written referral by \nany MPS staff person marks the beginning of the 90-day timeline.  MPS complied with DPI's \ndirectives. \n61 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 21 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n204.  DPI approved MPS's CAP regarding the 2000-2001 on-site monitoring findings \nand directives on October 9, 2001.  In April2002, DPI informed MPS that it needed only to \ndemonstrate that the IEP Team Handbook Updates document was delivered to specified MPS \npersonnel in order for DPI to verify that all activities required by the 2000-2001 onsite \nmonitoring CAP were completed. \niv.  DPI's on-site monitoring of MPS compliance with the requirements of IDEA \nand state law, 2001-2002 school year. \n205.  During the 2001-2002 school year, DPI conducted on-site reviews at MPS and 69 \nother school districts.  DPI reviewers focused their review on three areas.  First, the review team \nlooked at the effectiveness ofMPS's activities to correct the implementation errors identified in \nthe 1999-2000 on-site monitoring report.  Second, DPI reviewed the areas of procedural \nnoncompliance identified as statewide noncompliance areas in OSEP's October 2000 report. \nThird, DPI reviewed the procedural compliance issues contained in the five MPS CCAPs. \n206.  DPI reviewers concluded that, although MPS was correctly implementing the \nrequirements identified by OSEP as statewide compliance issues, MPS continued to make \nimplementation errors with respect to the issues identified in the 2000 on-site monitoring report, \nand that MPS's activities to implement the CCAPs had not corrected the procedural errors the \nCCAPs were designed to correct. \n207.  With respect to the implementation errors identified in the 2000 on-site \nmonitoring report, DPI ordered MPS to collaborate with DPI staff to develop a corrective action \nplan to ensure correct implementation of each requirement, including time frames for \nimplementation of the corrective activities, identification of persons responsible for \nimplementation, documentation to verify completion of the corrective activity, and a description \nof how and when MPS will measure whether the corrective activities had the desired effect. \n62 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 22 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nWith respect to the procedural errors identified in the CCAPs, DPI ordered MPS to continue \nworking through the CCAP process to correct the implementation errors. \n208.  In addition to the specific corrective activities ordered above, DPI ordered MPS to \nestablish, by the beginning ofthe 2002-2003 school year, an effective, centrally administered \nsystem of special education procedural oversight and accountability mechanisms, with such \nmechanisms to be implemented at each school building. \nF.  October 2000 Office of Special Education Programs' Evaluation of DPI's \nCompliance With Its Oversight Responsibilities \n209.  During the weeks ofNovember 2, 1998, and February 22, 1999, the Office of \nSpecial Education Programs (\"OSEP\") of the United States Department of Education conducted \non-site visits in Wisconsin for the purpose of assessing the state's compliance with the \nrequirements of IDEA '97.  OSEP reviewed the state's compliance with both IDEA Part C \n(services for children aged birth through two) and IDEA Part B (services for children aged three \nthrough 21 ).  OSEP issued a report detailing its findings and recommendations on October 18, \n2000. \n210.  OSEP's review consisted of two phases.  First, OSEP engaged in a planning \nprocess  to gather information about the state's Part C and Part B programs, using the results of \nself-studies, surveys of system participants, formally organized steering committees, and public \nforums in locations around the state, including Milwaukee, focused on the core ideas of IDEA \n'97.  Second, OSEP conducted on-site visits to selected school districts, including MPS, for the \npurpose of collecting data to address issues identified during the planning phase.  For its Part C \nreview, OSEP collected information from the review of children's records, interviewed state \npersonnel county personnel and interviewed parents.  For its Part B review, OSEP reviewed \nstudent records, and reviewed district policies and procedures relating to the focus issues.  OSEP \n63 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 23 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nalso reviewed state policies, procedures and records, and interviewed DPI personnel, regarding \nthe state's monitoring, complaint, mediation, due process and personnel development systems, \ntechnical assistance, and other issues. \n211.  OSEP's Part C review evaluated five broad areas for compliance with IDEA's \nrequirements:(!) general supervision, (2) Child Find and public awareness, (3) early intervention \nservices in natural environments, (4) family-centered system of services, and (5) early childhood \ntransition. \n212.  OSEP found no areas of non-compliance with respect to statewide efforts to find \nchildren aged birth through three who may be in need of services, or with respect to public \nawareness of those early childhood services.  OSEP found, however, that the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Health and Family Services (\"DHFS\"), the state's lead agency for Part C, did not \nensure that in every county a transition planning conference was held at least 90 days before a \nchild's third birthday for those children who might be eligible for Part B, or ensure that in every \ncounty a transition conference be convened for children who are not likely to be eligible for Part \nB services. some school districts. \n213.  MPS provides outreach to birth to three programs, Head Start programs, and other \ncommunity early childhood programs regarding MPS referral procedures and special education \nprograms and services.  Data shows that about 90 percent of the children referred to MPS from \nthe birth to three agencies qualify for special education. \n214.  MPS has an Early Childhood Assessment Team (ECAT) that makes certain that \nevaluations are completed and IEPs are developed in a timely manner prior to the child \ntransitioning to MPS at age three.  ECAT referrals are received from Head Start, Birth to 3 \nprograms, hospitals, physicians, and parents. The ECAT has three Special Education Supervisors \n64 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 24 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nand four Diagnostic Teachers.  A centralized database helps to assure that children in birth to \nthree (Part C) programs who are transferring into MPS are evaluated and that the 90-day timeline \nis being met, unless there is a valid extension for a child-related reason. \n215.  If a child is not found to be eligible for special education, MPS staff give \ninformation to the parent regarding a placement that the child may be going to and provide other \nsuggestions to the parent regarding their child needs.  This information is part oftheir permanent \nMPS Special Services Information Management System for future tracking, as needed, \ndepending on the progress of the child. \n216.  OSEP's Part B review evaluated four broad areas for compliance with IDEA's \nrequirements:  (1) parent involvement, (2) free appropriate education in the least restrictive \nenvironment, (3) secondary transition, and (4) general supervision. \n217.  OSEP's October 2000 Report states that one of the purposes of IDEA '97 was to \nexpand and promote opportunities for parents and school personnel to work in new partnerships \nat the state and local levels.  Under IDEA '97, parents gained the right to participate in meetings \nwith respect to the identification, evaluation and educational placement of their child, and the \nprovision of a free appropriate education to their child.  OSEP found two strengths in the area of \nparent participation; DPI's Wisconsin Statewide Parent-Educator Initiative (\"WSPEI'') to build \nparent-educator partnerships at the local school district level, and DPI's user-friendly web-site. \nOSEP encouraged school districts and DPI to support greater training for parents.  OSEP found \nno areas of non-compliance with the parental involvement requirements ofiDEA that it gathered \ninformation about- in Milwaukee or in any of the other districts visited. \n218.  During the planning phase ofOSEP's review ofDPI's general supervision, \nparticipants expressed concern regarding the timeliness ofDPI's decisions on IDEA complaints, \n65 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 25 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nand concern about DPI's effectiveness in ensuring the timely correction of non-compliance, \nespecially in districts with longstanding histories of noncompliance.  OSEP noted that the \nparticipants in the planning phase were particularly concerned about longstanding non \ncompliance in two of the large urban districts OSEP visited in February 1999.  At that time, \nOSEP visited Madison, Milwaukee, Racine, Bloomer, Mount Horeb, and River Falls.  MPS was \none of the school districts about which planning participants had expressed concern. \n219.  OSEP's report summarized DPI's on-site and other annual monitoring during the \nyears 1995 through 2000, and DPI's planned monitoring activities for the 2000-2001 school \nyear.  OSEP noted no areas of non-compliance regarding this aspect ofDPI's oversight \nresponsibilities. \n220.  OSEP found that DPI was not in compliance with IDEA's requirement that IDEA \ncomplaints be resolved within 60 calendar days. \n221.  DPI had acknowledged in 1998 that complaint decisions often were not issued \nwithin sixty days, and began to make improvements.  From September 2000 to June 10, 2005, 77 \nIDEA complaints were filed against MPS.  Two complaints were withdrawn.  The issues in three \nother complaints were held in abeyance pending the outcome of due process hearings.  Ofthe \nremaining 72 complaints, the decisions in all but number 01-067 were issued within 60 days. \nThe decision in 01-067 was issued within 71 days.  In that complaint, additional issues were \nraised after the complaint had been filed. \n222.  OSEP specifically addressed DPI's actions to ensure MPS's compliance with \nIDEA's requirements in its October 2000 report.  The report summarized DPI's actions with \nrespect to MPS's failure in 1998 to ensure that all students had current IEPs and MPS's failure to \nensure that evaluations were completed within 90 days, including the withholding of funds, the \n66 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 26 of 39   Document 267-2\n\ndirection of funds specifically for improving compliance, and continuing reporting and \nverification requirements. OSEP encouraged DPI to continue to use financial and other \nsanctions, where necessary, to achieve improved results, and encouraged DPI to evaluate the \neffectiveness of the corrective activities it requires, and if necessary, to take more rigorous action \nto ensure timely correction of districts' non-compliance. \n223.  Except for DPI's failure to resolve IDEA complaints within sixty days, OSEP did \nnot find any areas of non-compliance within Part B, the section of its report relating to DPI's \ngeneral supervision responsibility. \nG.  DPI's Oversight OfMPS' Compliance with IDEA and State Law Through the \nDevelopment And Enforcement of Consolidated Corrective Action Plans \n224.  During the years 1998 through 2001, DPI experienced a large rise in the number \nof IDEA complaints filed against MPS, alleging that MPS violated a student's rights under IDEA \nand state law.  A summary of the numbers of substantiated complaint decisions from January \n1995 through March 31, 2005, appears in the following chart: \nIDEA complaints filed aeainst MPS \nTotal cases filed  Cases where violation(s) fonnd \n1995  4  2 \n1996  8  2 \n1997  5  4 \n1998  19  16 \n1999  22  14 \n2000  18  13 \n2001  39  33 \n2002  12  9 \n2003  9  6 \n2004  9  9 \n2005 \n(through Case  3  2 \n05-004) \n67 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 27 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n225.  On June 8, 2000, DPI issued a decision in IDEA Complaint No. 00-10, finding \nthat MPS violated IDEA's placement requirements.  The directives to MPS noted that DPI had \nfour open complaints where MPS was determined to have violated the law regarding how it \nselected the building in which services were to be delivered to children with disabilities.  DPI \ninformed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight ofthe corrective activities MPS would be \nrequired to complete with respect to this area.  DPI's consolidated oversight regarding this issue \ncame to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the \"Placement Consolidated Corrective Action Plan \n(CCAP).\" \n226.  On October 2, 2000, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of \nrequired corrective action in four open complaints where MPS had been directed to take steps to \nprovide children with a free and appropriate public education within a reasonable amount of time \nafter the district learns that a child with a disability is not attending school.  DPI's consolidated \noversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the \"Non-Attendance \nConsolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).\" \n227.  On October II, 2000, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of \nrequired corrective action in five complaints where MPS was determined unlawfully failed to \nprovide a free and appropriate public education by repeatedly suspending or excluding children \nwith disabilities.  DPI's consolidated oversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by \nDPI and MPS as the \"Discipline Consolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).\" \n228.  On August 10, 2001, DPI informed MPS that it was consolidating its oversight of \nrequired corrective action in three open complaints involving speech and language issues.  DPI's \nconsolidated oversight regarding this issue came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the \n\"Speech and Language Consolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).\" \n68 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 28 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n229.  On October 3, 2001, DPI issued a decision in IDEA Complaint No. 01-058, \nfinding that MPS failed to provide services to a student consistent with the requirements of the \nstudent's IEP.  The decision notified MPS that DPI had seven open complaints regarding MPS's \nfailure to provide services consistent with the IEPs, and notified MPS that DPI was consolidating \nits oversight of required corrective action in the seven open complaints.  DPI's consolidated \noversight regarding this issue area came to be referred to by DPI and MPS as the \"IEP \nConsolidated Corrective Action Plan (CCAP).\" \n230.  As DPI substantiated additional complaints on issues under the rubric of the five \nCCAPs, DPI added the complaint to the CCAP and imposed additional corrective actions that \nhad to be performed by MPS to DPI's satisfaction in order to be closed. \n231.  By October 19,2001, fourteen complaints had been incorporated into the \nPlacement CCAP.  Seven complaints had been incorporated into the Non-Attendance CCAP. \nNine complaints had been incorporated into the Discipline CCAP.  Three complaints had been \nincorporated into the Speech and Language CCAP.  Seven open complaints were part of the IEP \nCCAP. \nH.  DPI's Response to the Directives in the 2004 Re-Authorization ofiDEA Regarding \nState Oversight of Local School Districts. \n232.  Under IDEA, states, through their state educational agency (\"SEA\"), are obligated \nto ensure that all children with disabilities residing in the State, including children with \ndisabilities attending private schools, regardless of severity of their disabilities, and who are in \nneed of special education and related services are identified, located, and evaluated. \n233.  Under IDEA, the SEA is responsible for approving or disapproving applications \nby local educational agencies (\"LEAs\") for IDEA funds.  Within the LEA application, the LEA \nmust assure that it has effective policies and procedures consistent with state and federal legal \n69 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 29 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nrequirements of IDEA. Within the LEA application and approval process, if the SEA determines \nthat the LEA or State agency is failing to maintain programs providing free appropriate pubic \neducation to children with disabilities through implementation of its policies and procedures, \ncorrective actions will need to be made by the LEA to assure compliance with IDEA. \n234.  Under IDEA, states must have procedures for resolving special education related \ncomplaints, including an independent on-site investigation ofthe allegations within the \ncomplaint. In addition, the complainant must be given opportunity to submit additional \ninformation, either orally or in writing, and all relevant information must be reviewed prior to \nmaking an independent determination of compliance. \n235.  In order to carry out its responsibilities under the IDEA, the SEA must monitor \nthe LEA for compliance with IDEA requirements.  If the SEA finds that the LEA is not \nfollowing such requirements, the SEA must take steps to see that corrective action is taken.  The \nSEA may reduce or not provide any further payments it would have made to the LEA until the \nSEA is satisfied that the LEA has come into compliance. \n236.  The 1997 Amendments of the IDEA and the implementing federal regulations for \nIDEA are silent on the prescribed type and frequency of procedures that an SEA is to use in \nassuring that the legal provisions are being met.  However, each SEA is responsible for the \nadoption and use of proper methods to monitor public agencies responsible for carrying out \nspecial education programs. \n237.  Since at least 1993, DPI has received periodic guidance from the United States \nDepartment of Education Office of Special Education Programs (\"OSEP\") about its special \neducation oversight activities. \n70 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 30 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n238.  In October 2000, OSEP found no errors in DPI's method of ensuring the \ncompliance of Wisconsin school districts with the requirements of IDEA and state special \neducation law.  Under that method, DPI made on-site visits to a subset of Wisconsin school \ndistricts each year, reviewed a sample of student records, interviewed staff, and reviewed the \ndistrict's policies and procedures.  The principal emphasis in DPI's on-site reviews was on the \ndistrict's compliance with the procedural requirements of IDEA. \n239.  DPI completed the sixth year of monitoring under the OSEP-approved model in \nthe 2002-2003 school year. \n240.  In 2000, OSEP began to focus its monitoring efforts on those requirements most \nclosely related to improving results for children with disabilities and those States most in need of \nsupport to improve compliance and performance. \n241.  In 2003, OSEP moved from a Continuous Improvement Monitoring Process \n(\"CIMP\") to the Continuous Improvement and Focused Monitoring System (\"CIFMS\"), and \nmade a commitment to states to provide technical assistance about that system. \n242.  In 2003, OSEP funded the National Center for Special Education Accountability \nMonitoring (\"NCSEAM\") to assist states in developing monitoring systems using a continuous \nimprovement focused-monitoring approach. In implementing a focused-monitoring, continuous \nimprovement system, it is assumed that the SEAs have limited resources for carrying out state \nmonitoring efforts and, therefore, should strategically focus on some, but not all of the literally \nhundreds of legal requirements within monitoring systems.  Implementation of such a system \nalso assumes that SEAs and LEAs will make monitoring decisions based on data and information \nand will select school systems to be monitored based on selected outcomes that have been \nidentified to be critical by the state's stakeholders. \n71 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 31 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n243.  Many states sought NCSEAM's assistance soon after it was created.  Because the \ndemand for NCSEAM's services exceeded its ability to effectively provide those services, \nseveral states, including Wisconsin, were put on a waiting list. \n244.  Although DPI did not have NCSEAM's guidance, it piloted a statewide CIFMS \nMonitoring System during the second semester of the 2003-2004 school year.  The purpose of \nthe new system is to achieve positive results for children with disabilities in Wisconsin while \nensuring continued procedural compliance with state and federal laws and regulations.  The \npilots occurred in six school districts and focused on exiting, participation and performance on \nstatewide assessment, disproportionality, and environment.  Activities in the pilots included data \nanalysis; parent, student, and staff focus groups, interviews, and surveys; policy reviews; and a \nself-assessment of procedural requirements.  The purpose of the pilots was to test the new \nprotocols.  Feedback from participating districts was positive; districts appreciated the \ncollaborative nature of the new system and the focus on improving student outcomes.  The \nresults of the pilots were shared with a CIFMS stakeholder group in May, 2004. \n245.  DPI entered into a partner relationship with NCSEAM in August 2004, for the \npurpose of getting NCSEAM's technical assistance with the development ofDPI's CIFMS \nMonitoring System. \n246.  The Continuous Improvement Focused Monitoring Process articulated by \nNCSEAM is built around the following themes: \na.  Consensual, measurable priorities identified by stakeholders. \nb.  Effective policies and procedures to guide and direct program planning \nand implementation. \nc.  Data on program processes and results and use of these results to guide \nprogram improvement. \n72 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 32 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nd.  Targeted training and technical assistance to remedy problems and \nimprove teaching and learning. \ne.  An effective and responsive dispute resolution system to resolve \ncomplaints and differences among school personnel, among school \npersonnel and parents, and among schools and other agencies. \nf.  Meaningful focused monitoring that measures selected compliance areas \nand outcomes. \ng.  Corrective actions to remedy identified problems, incentives to support \nneeded change, and sanctions to insure noncompliance will be corrected. \n247.  IDEA was reauthorized by the passage ofH.R. 1350, the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, in December, 2004. \n248.  The IDEA re-authorization has codified focused monitoring as the primary focus \nof both Federal and state monitoring activities.  The Act requires those monitoring activities to \nprimarily focus on: \na.  Improving educational results and functional outcomes for all children \nwith disabilities; and \nb.  Ensuring that IDEA program requirements are met, with particular \nemphasis on those requirements that are most closely related to improving \neducational results for children with disabilities. \n249.  The IDEA re-authorization requires each state to monitor the local educational \nagencies located in the state using quantifiable indicators, and using such qualitative indicators as \nare needed to adequately measure performance in the following priority areas: \na.  Provision of a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive \nenviromnent; \nb.  State exercise of general supervisory authority, including child find, \neffective monitoring, the use of resolution sessions, mediation, voluntary \nbinding arbitration, and a system of transition services as defined in \nsections 602(34) and 637(a)(9); and \nc.  Disproportionate representation of racial and ethnic groups in special \neducation and related services, to the extent the representation is the result \nof inappropriate identification. \n73 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 33 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n250.  Based on NCSEAM's guidance, DPI has expanded the membership and diversity \nof the statewide stakeholders group, and has expanded the scope of the subjects on which the \ngroup's input is being sought.  DPI has involved stakeholders in the development and review of \nthe new CIFMS system by holding meetings to seek stakeholder input.  In November 2004, Dr. \nAlan Coulter and Dr. Sandy Schmitz, Director of Technical Assistance for NCSEAM facilitated \na stakeholder meeting to identify priority areas for focused monitoring.  After a review of \nstatewide data, the stakeholders group selected graduation rates and gth grade reading \nperformance as focus areas for monitoring. \n251.  The twenty-two member statewide CIFMS stakeholders group includes attorney \nJeffrey Spitzer-Resnick from the Wisconsin Coalition for Advocacy (lead counsel for the class in \nthis lawsuit), MPS Director of Special Services Patricia Y ahle, MPS Parent Information \nSpecialist Georgette Rodriguez, and Jan Serak, from the Family Assistance Center for Education, \nTraining and Support, Inc. (\"FACETS\"), a statewide parent advocacy group based in Milwaukee. \n252.  The stakeholders also determined a process for selecting districts for on-site \nmonitoring was also outlined.  The stakeholders determined that the state should divide the state \ninto monitoring cohorts by enrollment size, and concluded that CIFMS monitoring should be \ndone on the basis of seven enrollment-based cohorts, and an eighth cohort consisting of \nrandomly selected districts.  Because MPS's enrollment is approximately four times larger than \nthe enrollment of Wisconsin's next-largest school district, the stakeholders concluded that MPS \nshould be its own cohort.  The effect of the stakeholders' decision means that MPS will be \nsubject to statewide CIFMS on-site monitoring every year, beginning with the 2005-2006 school \nyear. \n74 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 34 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n253.  On January 7, 2005, representatives ofDPI and MPS had a telephone conference \nwith Dr. Coulter to discuss how the state's focused monitoring would be done in MPS schools. \nDPI and MPS agreed to use the administrative accountability structure of the Special Education \nOversight Accountability Plan (\"SOAP\"), through which MPS is divided into nine groups of \nschools, each overseen by a Special Education Leadership Liaison (\"SELL\"), as the within-MPS \ncohorts for implementing statewide CIFMS monitoring. \n254.  During the spring semester of the 2004-2005 school year, DPI has conducted pilot \nfocused monitoring and data verification visits in volunteer districts. The pilots consist of data \nanalysis activities with the district, focus forums, individual interviews, surveys, policy reviews, \nand individualized education program (IEP) record reviews.  DPI staff has shared results with the \ndistrict and has discussed strengths and possible areas for improvement.  DPI also shared the \nresults with NCSEAM and the stakeholders group. \n255.  On May 3-4, 2005, the stakeholders group met with Dr. Coulter to provide \nstakeholders with an update on the development of Wisconsin's CIFMS System and to develop a \nplan for completing the Part B State Performance Plan (SPR) and Annual Performance Report \n(APR) required by IDEA 2004. \n256.  The stakeholders group is currently scheduled to meet with Dr. Coulter on three \nfuture dates.  On July 19-20,2005, the stakeholders will continue discussing the differing \nrequirements of state and federal law and how to address those differences; and will get an \nupdate on the status of the application(s) for waiver.  On October 20-21,2005, and again on \nFebruary 7-8, 2006, the stakeholders will receive an update in the statewide CIFMS monitoring \nsystem. \n75 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 35 of 39   Document 267-2\n\n257.  The statewide CIFMS System is separate and distinct from DPI's oversight of \nMPS's implementation of SOAP and the MPS CIFMS Action Plan.  The statewide CIFMS \nSystem is designed to provide focused monitoring of all state school districts, specifically \nincluding MPS, with respect to the statewide graduation rates and gth grade reading performance \nfocus areas selected by the stakeholders group, in accordance with the focused monitoring \nrequirements of IDEA 2004.  SOAP is designed to create a centralized special education \ncompliance accountability structure within MPS's decentralized, building-based educational \nservices delivery model.  The MPS CIFMS Action Plan is designed to improve MPS's \ncompliance with the procedural requirement deficiencies identified in 2000-2002 monitoring \nreports and CCAPs, to create continuity between the procedural compliance focus of the state's \nprevious oversight model and the student outcome focus of the new federally mandated \ncontinuous improvement focused monitoring model, and to create capacity within MPS to \nreliably perform the self-assessments required under the continuous improvement focused \nmonitoring model, and to reliably implement district-wide change when necessary. \n76 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 06/24/05   Page 36 of 39   Document 267-2\n\nWISCONSIN COALITION FOR ADVOCACY, INC. \n-td \nJj \nDated this  day of June, 2005. \nMonica M.

Case No. 01-C-928 \nMILW  AUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, \nWILLIAM ANDREKOPOLOUS, \nWISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION, \nELIZABETH BURMASTER, and \nMILWAUKEE BOARD OF SCHOOL DIRECTORS, \nDefendants. \nDECISION AND ORDER REGARDING CLASS CERTIFICATION \nOn May 23, 2003, the court, in its Decision and Order Regarding Class Certification, \ndirected the plaintiffs to submit an amended class certification motion. The plaintiffs filed the \nmotion and defendants have responded. In addition to the amended class certification motion, \nthere are a number of other outstanding motions that need to be addressed by the court. \nThe  court,  in its  May 23,  2003,  order,  after thoroughly reviewing plaintiffs' \nsubmissions, concluded that the plaintiffs'.complaints could be divided into two general areas \nof alleged failures: pre-determination and post-determination. The court further concluded that \n!~ \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 1 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.S/82) \n\n' \n0\n. \nthe claims falling within the post-determination category were not viable for class certification \nbecause they were not systemic in nature, but were individual and therefore subject to the \nexhaustion requirement under the due process format.  In regard to the pre-determination \ncategory, the court concluded that this encompassed claims in which there was an alleged failure \nto get a student into services; to the court, these appeared to be failures in the process and were \nsystemic in nature.  As a result, the court ordered that the plaintiff submit an amended class \ncertification motion on the pre-determination claims. \nIt appears, after reading the parties' amended submissions, that the court's May 23, 2003, \norder may have suffered from a lack of clarity or specificity  when it discussed the pre-\ndetermination claims and the need for an amended class certification motion.  As such, the \ndefendants and the plaintiffs have each opted to interpret the order in a light most favorable to \ntheir own causes. Unfortunately, this has not advanced the court's task of determining whether \nor not a class should be certified.  The plaintiffs have construed the court's order in such a way \nthat they are, in effect, seeking reconsideration of their first motion for class certification. The \nplaintiffs are now presenting two subclasses; the second clearly runs afoul of the May 23, 2003 \norder; and the first does little more than reassert the arguments oftheir earlier class certification \nmotion.  The defendants, on the other hand, have taken a very narrow reading of the court's \norder.  In fact, the defendants' reading is so narrow that it defines any putative class out of \nexistence.  The court's view of the defendants' approach is exemplified by the motion for \nsummary judgment the defendants filed on July 30, 2003.  More about that motion later. \nMore specifically, in the plaintiffs' second proposed subclass, they are, in effect, seeking \nto revisit the post-determination class by defining it as a class of students who have been denied \n2 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 2 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.8/82) \n\n•,  0 \n' \nspecial education rights other than procedural rights.  The plaintiffs argue that when looking at \nthe violations, the court should not focus on the due process hearing mechanisms in its \nexhaustion analysis because the due process system cannot solve systemic problems. But, what \nare the systemic problems raised by the plaintiffs? As the court previously indicated, all of the \nissues or problems presented by the plaintiffs are individual problems for which a remedy can \nbe sought through the due process hearing system if the system is given a chance to address \nthose alleged problems. The problems alleged are substantive complaints raised by individual \nchildren.  And, each child has available to him or her, the opportunity to seek a remedy for the \ncomplaint through the due process hearing system. Consequently, the court will not revisit what \nit labeled the post-determination claims as those claims need to be exhausted. \nIn regard to the plaintiffs' first proposed subclass, this also suffers from the plaintiffs' \nattempt to reargue their prior submissions. This proposed definition concentrates on the denial \nofp rocedural rights, but in the examples presented, it clearly encompasses what this court views \nas post-determination claims, especially those involving complaints after the tE.P. meeting. \nSee, Plaintiffs' BriefinSupportofAmendedMotion for Class Certification atp.3, :fu.3. In other \nwords, even with their first proposed subclass, the plaintiffs have kept the same representative \nplaintiffs and have not applied the Rule 23(a ) and Rule 23(b) (2) analyses to the particular pre-\ndetermination claims, as defined by the court. As stated above, they have reargued their earlier \nmotion. \nOn the other side, both the state defendants and the Milwaukee defendants have \nessentially defined the class out of existence.  The Milwaukee defendants look to the court's \nwording and would find a pre-determination failure \"only when 'the child is not yet in services \n3 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 3 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.8/82) \n\nand the parents or guardians may not be aware of the child's procedural rights or how to invoke \nthose rights.\"' Milwaukee Defendants' Brief at 10 (emphasis in original). However, the court \ndid not use an exclusive phrase such as \"only when\" in its May 23, 2003, order.  And, by no \nmeans did the court intend to limit pre-determination failures to only situations where (1) the \nchild is not in services and (2) whose parents may not know how to invoke those rights, as \nsuggested by the state defendants. State Defendants' Brief at 16. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing criticism of the plaintiffs' amended proposal, this court \nstill believes that a  group of claims exists that can be classified as systemic.  Those are the \nclaims that the court had previously labeled pre-determination claims.  The court is of the \nopinion that such a putative class reposes in the plaintiffs' submissions, i.e., those students who \nsuffer from deficiencies in the system which hinder, unduly delay or prevent them from being \ninitially served.  Such deficiencies do not lend themselves to individualized exhaustion, and \neven if one person follows through, numerous others will continue to be frustrated. \nThis is the putative class the court characterized as consisting of pre-determination \nissues.  Because the plaintiffs have not specifically defined the class, and the defendants \ninterpreted the court's language too narrowly, in an effort to advance ultimate resolution oft his \nmatter, the court will provide its own class definition. ·The class, if one is to be certified, shall \nbe defined as: \nThose students eligible for special education services from the Milwaukee \nPublic School System who are, have been or will be either denied or delayed \nentry or participation in the processes which result in a meeting between the \nI.E.P. team and the parents or guardians of the student. \nIn other words, the class is open to both students currently in services and those who have not \n4 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 4 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.B/82) \n\n0  0 \nyet been placed into services so long as those students are, have been or will be denied or \ndelayed access to services because MPS failed to recognize their need for special education \nservices of some type. The court's concern in these situations is that the individual students may \nnot have adequate remedies available to them through the due process system because, even \ndespite the procedures that MPS already has in place, parents or guardians may not either be \naware at all or adequately informed of their rights to have the child evaluated for services. For \nexample, in the declarations the plaintiffs included with their original class certification motion, \nthe parent of Joseph D. declared that she repeatedly asked teachers for several years, beginning \nin preschool, to evaluate Joseph D. for special education.  However, Joseph D. was not \nevaluated until third grade. In another case, Aaron F. manifested behavioral problems since the \nbeginning of kindergarten.  By the time Aaron F. was in first grade, his mother requested that \nhe be evaluated for special education.  However, Aaron F. was not evaluated until the second \ngrade. \nTo be clear, the court is not extending its definition of the class to the issues that arise \nbeyond the I.E.P. meeting, such as the implementation of the I.E.P. plan and transitional \nservices.  In such situations, the risk of uniformed parents  is alleviated by the I.E.P. meeting \nbetween the I.E.P. team and the parents or guardians. At this face-to-face meeting, the parent \nor guardian is made aware of the right to challenge the I.E.P. team's determination or raise any \nother issues the parent or guardian may have with the need for services or the quality of those \nservices, as well as the procedures for raising such challenges. \nThe state defendants note the court's use of the word \"eligible\" in its May 23, 2003, \norder.  The state defendants use the same definition of eligible as is used in Wis. Stats § \n5 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 5 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.S/82) \n\n115.728(3).  In the statute, a child is eligible for services if (1) the child has been referred for \nevaluation; (2) the child has been evaluated by an I.E.P. team; and (3) a determination was made \nby the I.E.P. team.  Although the court recognizes that this is the definition of eligible used by \nthe State of Wisconsin in the special education setting, it is not what the court meant by eligible. \nInstead, the court intends to include all children who are not already in services and who are \nthought to have special needs or otherwise require special services, whether or not they are \neventually placed in services. \nIn regard to their claims against the state defendants, the plaintiffs argue that these do \nnot need to be exhausted, because exhaustion through the due process hearing system is not a \nproper avenue to address claims about the state's monitoring ofMPS. In essence, the plaintiffs \nare trying to back-door the substantive claims that the court would otherwise not allow to \nconstitute a class.  In other words, the plaintiffs claim that faulty or inadequate oversight by the \nDPI permitted the whole panoply ofMPS violations to occur and, as such, all should be certified \nas a class against the DPI. \nWhether or not a student, or his parents or guardian, would have an individual remedy \nfor the DPI' s failure to monitor MPS through the due process hearing system, the underlying \nalleged violations still do not qualify for a class for reasons previously presented. It is because \nthe underlying claims do not qualify for class certification that the court cannot recognize a class \nbased on the alleged dereliction of the DPI.  To repeat,  the reason  for  the exhaustion \nrequirement is to give the system a chance to correct itsel£  If the parents or guardians of a \nstudent raise their grievances in a due process hearing, MPS is presented with an opportunity \nto address those problems.  If the problem is addressed and corrected, the DPI can not be \n6 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 6 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.B/82) \n\n0 \n. \ncharged with the dereliction of the duty to monitor MPS, as to Lamont A.  or the other \nrepresentative plaintiffs.  Consequently, only the pre-determination claims, as now defined in \nthis order, can be raised against the state defendants. \nNow, the question becomes, who will represent the class and does the class meet the \nrequirements ofRules 23(a) and 23(b)(2)? Of particular concern, under Adashunas v. Negley, \n626 F.2d 600, 603 (7th Cir. 1980), the class must be identifiable and not merely speculative. \nIn short, the court must be persuaded that a class exists outside ofthe potential plaintiffs listed \nbelow.  Of the named plaintiffs, it appears that only Jamie S. might represent this class. \nHowever, as stated above, there appear to be other potential plaintiffs (Joseph D., LassomerC., \nTyrone D., Aaron F. and Michael T. ), who are included in the plaintiffs' declarations in support \nof the motion for class certification. \nBecause the apparent lack of clarity in the court's language in its May 23, 2003, order \nmay have obscured the issues for class certification, the plaintiffs will be given the opportunity \nto submit a second amended class certification motion based upon the class as it is defined in \nthis order.  The plaintiffs must submit their second amended class certification motion by no \nlater than August 22, 2003. The defendants shall file their response by no later than September \n8, 2003. The plaintiffs may file their reply by no later than September 18, 2003.  Based upon \nthese final submissions, either a class will be certified, or it will not. \nHaving dealt with the amended class certification motion, the court turns to the other \noutstanding motions.  The first outstanding motion is the plaintiff Lamont A's motion for a \npreliminary injunction, dated September 18,2002. That motion was filed in conjunction with \nthe plaintiff Lamont A's motion to file a supplemental complaint.  The motion to  file a \n7 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 7 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.S/82) \nII llilli  I  !III TlillliiiiTllllrT  I  T Jlllill  II II  JJJII1.  i  I \n\n.. \nsupplemental complaint was denied on October 9, 2002.  The motion for a preliminary \ninjunction should have been denied at that time as well, but it was overlooked by the court. \nConsequently, the plaintiffLamont A's motion for a preliminary injunction will now be denied \nas moot. \nThe next outstanding motion is the plaintiffs' November 19, 2002, motion to compel and \nseek responses to additional interrogatories beyond those permitted by rule.  In this motion, the \nplaintiffs seek either an order compelling the defendants to answer the plaintiffs' third set of \ninterrogatories or, in the alternative, if the court finds that, because of the plaintiffs; use of \nsubparts, the plaintiffs have already exceeded their 25-interrogatory limit, the plaintiffs seek \nleave to file additional interrogatories. The defendants believe that the plaintiffs have exceeded \ntheir interrogatory limit and refuse to answer the plaintiffs' third set of interrogatories. \nBecause it appears that all oftheplaintiffs' requests concern the issues that the court has \nlabeled post-determination, those interrogatories are no longer germane to the class action. \nConsequently, the plaintiffs' motion will be denied.  However, if the plaintiffs feel that some \nof the interrogatories are germane to the class, as defined in this order, it may resubmit its \nmotion after the class certification motion has been decided.  As such, the motion is denied \nwithout prejudice. \nOn July 23,2003, the parties filed a joint motion to seal the affidavit ofPatricia Yahle, \nalong with the documents that were submitted with the affidavit. The parties ask that the motion \nbe granted because the Milwaukee defendants inadvertently included the unredacted names of \nthe seven named plaintiffs.  Upon the stipulation of the parties and for good cause shown, the \nmotion to seal the affidavit ofPatricia Yahle, along with all of the documents submitted with \n8 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 8 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.S/82) \nIll 111  _n u u r Iii liT c;rn~• n. nn;  r --,- til r cc:  - n -\n\n0  A \n*  '  T  v \nit, shall be granted. \nNext, the court is in receipt oft he plaintiffs' Civil Local Rule 7.4 non-dispositive motion \nto strike the Milwaukee defendants' brief in opposition to the amended motion for class \ncertification, as well as the Milwaukee defendants' response to that motion.  In the plaintiffs' \nmotion, they seek to strike the Milwaukee defendants' brief in opposition to the amended class \ncertification motion because the Milwaukee defendants originally filed a copy oftheir third set \nof interrogatories to the plaintiffs, separate from their brief in opposition to the amended class \ncertification motion, which violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d ). However, the Milwaukee Defendants' \nresponse makes it clear that the interrogatories were intended to be filed with the brief and \ntherefore were intended to be used in the proceeding. Consequently, there is no Fed. R. Civ. P. \n5(d ) violation, and the plaintiffs' motion to strike the Milwaukee defendants' brief will be \ndenied. \nLastly, the court returns to the Milwaukee defendants' motion for summary judgment \nwhich was just filed. In fact, the motion was received so recently thatthe plaintiffs have not had \nan opportunity to respond .  Nonetheless, in light of the court's action in this order, it is \nappropriate to address the Milwaukee defendants' motion now. In the motion, the Milwaukee \ndefendants seek summary judgment because six of the named plaintiffs only assert post-\ndetermination claims and the one plaintiff who asserts a pre-determination claim should have \nexhausted the available administrative remedies.  The defendants' argument is based on their \nunduly narrow reading of the court's order.  Since the court is giving the plaintiffs an \nopportunity to file a second amended class certification motion, the Milwaukee defendants' \nmotion  for  summary judgment is  premature.  The  plaintiffs'  second  motion  for  class \n9 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 9 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.B/82) \n\n.. \n0 \n\\ \ncertification may include both some or all of the named plaintiffs, as well as other potential \nplaintiffs who have not yet been named.  The Milwaukee defendants' motion for summary \njudgment will be dismissed without prejudice. \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the plaintiffs shall submit their second amended \nclass certification motion by not later than August 22, 2003.  The defendants shall file their \nresponse by no later than September 8, 2003.  And any reply must be filed by no later than \nSeptember 18, 2003. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction is \ndenied as moot. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs' November 19, 2002, motion to \ncompel is denied without prejudice. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the parties' joint motion to seal the affidavit of \nPatricia Y ahle, along with all of the supporting documents is granted. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the plaintiffs motion to strike the Milwaukee \ndefendants' brief in opposition to the amended motion for class certification is denied. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Milwaukee defendants' motion for summary \njudgment is denied with prejudice.  rsr \nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this  - day of August, 2003. \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n10 \nA072A \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 08/01/03   Page 10 of 10   Document 184\n(Rev.S/82) \n1 . . .. \nJ Tfffl!llii  l!l!

Once counsel for plaintiffs and DPI have signed their settlement agreement, they \nshall jointly convey the settlement agreement to the MPS defendants with an offer \nto join the agreement, without changes to said agreement. \n2.  MPS shall be given until March 14, 2008, to either join the settlement agreement \nbetween DPI and plaintiffs, or to reject it. \n3.  Regardless of whether or not MPS joins the settlement agreement between DPI \nand plaintiffs, DPI and plaintiffs agree to file a Motion to Approve the Settlement \nAgreement  and  Issue a  Consent  Decree  with  the  court,  as  set  forth  in said \nsettlement agreement, no later than April 8, 2008. \n4.

If this matter proceeds to trial in November, 2008, DPI and plaintiffs agree to \njointly retain one (1) expert to support the resolutipn described in their settlement \nagreement.  DPI and plaintiffs agree to split the costs of said expert evenly. \n6.  Subject to paragraph 7 of this Memorandum of Understanding, if after trial or any \nsubsequent appeal the court determines that DPI is liable for a greater amount of \nattorneys fees and costs than the amount required by the settlement agreement, \nDRW agrees to accept the amount of fees and costs required by the settlement \nagreement  as  full  payment  of DRW's  liability,  notwithstanding  the  court's \ndetermination.  Subject to paragraph 7 of this Memorandum of Understanding, if \nafter trial or any subsequent appeal the court determines that DPI is liable for a \nlesser  amount  of attorneys  fees  and  costs  than  the  amount  required  by the \nsettlement agreement, DPI agrees to pay DRW the full amount of fees and costs \nrequired by the settlement agreement, notwithstanding the court's determination. \n2 \nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR  Filed 04/29/08  Page 2 of 4  Document 448 \n\n7.  The provisions in paragraph 6 of this Memorandum of Understanding shall not \nprevent plaintiffs' counsel from petitioning the Court for an award of reasonable \nattorney's fees and costs against DPI in connection with a motion to enforce the \nSettlement Agreement. \n8.  DPI agrees not to assert any objection to any fee petition which DRW has filed or \nwill file against the MPS defendants in this matter. \n9.  DPI agrees not to oppose any compensation which DRW seeks from the MPS \ndefendants  for  the named plaintiffs and  class  members  in this  matter,  either \nbefore, during or after trial. \n10.  DRW shall not publicly release the settlement agreement until it is filed with the \ncourt, unless DPI publicly releases the settlement agreement prior to  filing in \nresponse to a public records request.  DPI may publicly release the settlement \nagreement before it is filed with the court only in response to a public records \nrequest, and only with reasonable prior notice to plaintiffs' counsel.  Counsel for \nDRW, DPI and DOJ agree that they will not make any public comment about the \nsettlement agreement, until it is filed with the court.  At the time the settlement \nagreement is  filed  with the court, DRW and DPI will issue a joint statement \nregarding the settlement agreement containing mutually agreed language.  DRW \nand  DPI  agree  that  no  agent  or employee  of either  party  will  make  public \nstatements  regarding  the  settlement  agreement  or  the  other  party  that  is \ninconsistent with the joint statement. \n11.

Goodstein, Magistrate Judge.\n \nARGUED SEPTEMBER 7, 2010—DECIDED FEBRUARY 3, 2012 \n \nBefore FLAUM, ROVNER, and SYKES, Circuit Judges.\nSYKES, Circuit Judge.  We are asked in these consolidated\nappeals to review multiple procedural and substantive\norders  in  a  long-running  class-action  lawsuit  seeking\n\n2 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nstructural reform of special education in the Milwaukee\npublic school district. Under the Individuals with Dis-\nabilities Education Act (the “IDEA” or “the Act”), 20 U.S.C.\n§§  1400  et  seq.,  the  States  receive  federal  funding  for\nthe education of disabled children on the condition that\ntheir local school districts comply with the procedural\nrequirements of the Act and provide a “free appropriate\npublic education” to all resident children with disabilities.\nId. § 1412(a)(1)(A). As relevant here, local districts must\nidentify  children  with  disabilities,  determine  whether\nthese  children  require  special-education  services,  and\ndevelop  individualized  education  programs  (“IEPs”)\ntailored to each student’s specific needs. Each step in the\nprocess is highly individualized because every child is\nunique.\nIn 2001 seven students with disabilities sued the Mil-\nwaukee Public Schools (“MPS”) and the Wisconsin De-\npartment of Public Instruction (“DPI”) on behalf of them-\nselves and a class of “all school age children with dis-\nabilities  who  reside  in  the  Milwaukee  Public  School\nDistrict boundaries and who are or may be eligible for\nspecial education and related services under IDEA and\nWisconsin  law.”  The  complaint  alleged  widespread\nviolations of the IDEA touching on nearly every aspect\nof MPS’s implementation of the Act. The district court\nrejected  the  plaintiffs’  ambitious  proposed  class  but\ncertified a somewhat more modest one: students eligible\nto receive special education from MPS “who are, have\nbeen or will be” denied or delayed entry into or partic-\nipation in the IEP process. This narrower class definition\nhad the effect of focusing the case on alleged violations\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 3\nof the so-called “child find” requirements of the IDEA.\nId. § 1412(a)(3)(A).\nThe district court held a bench trial and found MPS\nand DPI liable for various “systemic” IDEA violations.\nDPI then settled with the class by agreeing to order MPS\nto meet certain compliance benchmarks; the district court\napproved the settlement over MPS’s objection. On June 9,\n2009,  the  court  ordered  a  complex  remedial  scheme\nrequiring  MPS  to  set  up  a  court-monitored  system  to\nidentify disabled children who were delayed or denied\nentry  into  the  IEP  process,  implement  “hybrid”  IEP\nmeetings, and craft compensatory-education remedies.\nMPS appealed the remedial order and also challenged\nthe  district  court’s  class-certification  decision,  the\nliability order, and the approval of the DPI settlement.\nThe plaintiffs sought review of the order rejecting their\nsweeping class definition but missed the filing deadline\nfor a cross-appeal. On August 19 the district court issued\ntwo  follow-up  orders  appointing  an  independent\nmonitor  and  approving  the  class  notice.  The  plaintiffs\nappealed  from  these  orders  but  do  not  contest  either\ndecision; instead, they ask us to review the order denying\ntheir original class-certification motion.\nBoth sides moved to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.\nWe took the motions with the merits and now dismiss\nthe plaintiffs’ appeal. The orders from which the plain-\ntiffs appealed are not final orders; nor are they the equiva-\nlent of injunctions, so they do not qualify for immediate\nappeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs  are  attempting  a  flagrantly  improper  procedural\n\n4 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nmaneuver;  they  may  not  revive  their  untimely  appeal\nby appealing from orders they do not want reviewed.\nWe deny the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal. The June 9\nremedial order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion and may be immediately appealed under § 1292(a)(1);\nwe  have  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction  over  the\nrelated orders.\nOn the merits we vacate the class-certification order.\nLike the Title VII claims in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes,\n131 S. Ct. 2541 (2011), the IDEA claims in this case are\nhighly  individualized  and  vastly  diverse,  making  this\ncase unsuitable for class-action treatment under Rule 23\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The class itself\nis  fatally  indefinite,  the  claims  lack  the  commonality\nrequired by Rule 23(a)(2), and it’s not possible to order\nfinal injunctive or corresponding declaratory relief on a\nclass-wide basis, as required by Rule 23(b)(2). Because\nthe  class  should  not  have  been  certified,  the  liability\nand remedial orders must be vacated as well. Finally,\nDPI’s settlement with the class prejudiced MPS’s legal\nrights by requiring more of MPS than DPI had the statu-\ntory  authority  to  demand.  In  any  case,  because  the\nclass  was  certified  in  error,  the  order  approving  the\nDPI settlement must also be vacated.\nI.  Background\nA.  Legal Framework\nThe IDEA requires participating States to provide to\nall disabled students a “free appropriate public education.”\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 5\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A). Complying with this require-\nment is a complex and inherently child-specific under-\ntaking. First, the IDEA requires that “[a]ll children with\ndisabilities residing in the State . . . and who are in need\nof special education and related services” be “identified,\nlocated, and evaluated,” a process known as “child find.”\nId.  §  1412(a)(3)(A).  Once  a  disabled  child  in  need  of\nspecial education is identified, the local school district\nmust  evaluate  the  child’s  specific  needs  and  develop\nan  “individualized  educational  program,”  or  “IEP,”\noutlining  the  particular  special-education  services  that\nare necessary to allow the  child to learn in the “least\nrestrictive environment.” Id. §§ 1412(a)(4)-(5), 1414. The\ncontent of an IEP and the meaning of “least restrictive\nenvironment”  are  nuanced  topics  that  we  need  not\nexplore  here.  With  limited  exceptions,  an  “IEP  Team”\nmust be convened and meet within 90 days of the child’s\ninitial referral, see WIS. STAT. § 115.78(3)(a) (1998);1 the\nIEP Team must include various educational professionals\nand  the  child’s  parent  or  guardian,  see  20  U.S.C.\n§ 1414(d)(1)(B). Once an IEP is in place, the school must\nprovide the services listed in it, and the IDEA sets out\nmany rules governing the process of amending an IEP.\nThese topics, too, are beyond the scope of inquiry here.\nTo ensure that each disabled child receives a free ap-\npropriate  public  education,  the  IDEA  also  requires\nStates to provide various procedural safeguards to stu-\n1 The  statutory  time  frame  has  since  been  shortened  to\n60 days. See WIS. STAT § 115.78(3)(a).\n\n6 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ndents and parents. See id. § 1415. A parent may file a\ncomplaint  “with  respect  to  any  matter  relating  to  the\nidentification,  evaluation,  or  educational  placement  of\nthe  child,”  id.  §  1415(b)(6)(A),  and  may  request  an\nimpartial due-process hearing to resolve the complaint,\nid.  §  1415(f).  After  receiving  a  final  decision  from  the\nhearing officer, the parent may appeal to the state educa-\ntional  agency.  Id.  §  1415(g).  Finally,  a  still-aggrieved\nparent may file a civil action seeking review of the deci-\nsion. Id. § 1415(i)(2). The IDEA also requires that parents\nbe  given  notice  of  their  procedural  rights  at  various\ntimes, including when the school district first proposes\nor  refuses  to  evaluate  a  child  for  a  disability.  Id.\n§ 1415(b)(3), (c)(1).\nWisconsin  implements  the  IDEA  through  sections\n115.758-115.90 of the Wisconsin Statutes, which track the\nIDEA’s  requirements  while  adding  functional  detail.\nOne  provision  of  particular  importance  here,  section\n115.90, gives DPI—the state educational agency charged\nwith overseeing Wisconsin’s IDEA compliance—various\nenforcement mechanisms if individual schools or school\ndistricts  are  not  fulfilling  their  statutory  obligations.\nSpecifically, DPI may order a school district to submit\na “corrective plan” that addresses the area of noncom-\npliance,  withhold  state  funding  until  the  violation  is\nfixed, or if the first two methods are unsuccessful, ask\nthe state attorney general to bring a lawsuit against the\nschool district to force compliance. WIS. STAT. § 115.90.\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 7\nB.  Proceedings Below\nThe  procedural  history  of  this  case  is  lengthy  and\ncomplex; we will simplify where we can. In 2001 Jamie S.\nand six other named plaintiffs brought this class-action\nsuit against MPS and DPI alleging a host of IDEA viola-\ntions. Jamie is cognitively impaired and was at that time\nan eight-year-old student in an MPS school. The other\nnamed plaintiffs are (or were) MPS students with disabili-\nties ranging from deafness to Asperger’s syndrome to\nvarious  emotional  disturbances.  The  parties  consented\nto the jurisdiction of a magistrate  judge, see 28 U.S.C.\n§  636(c)(1),  and  the plaintiffs  moved  to certify  a  class\nof  all  Milwaukee-area  students  who  “are  or  may  be\neligible for special education and related services under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law due to their disabilities.” The\nmagistrate  judge  declined  to  certify  a  class  of  this\nscope  based  largely  on  concerns  about  exhaustion  of\nadministrative  remedies.  But  the  judge  believed  that\nsome of plaintiffs’ claims could be litigated as a class\nnotwithstanding their failure to exhaust administrative\nremedies.\nTo  that  end,  the  judge  divided  the  proposed  class\ninto  two  categories:  those  having  “pre-determination\nclaims” and those having “post-determination claims.”\nThese were terms of the court’s own creation and referred\nto IDEA violations arising before an IEP meeting takes\nplace  and  IDEA  violations  arising  after  an  IEP  takes\nplace. Although  the  IDEA  generally  requires  plaintiffs\nto  use  the  administrative  dispute-resolution  process\nbefore filing suit, the judge thought that exhaustion of\n\n8 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nadministrative remedies for “pre-determination claims”\nwould be futile because parents of children with these\nkinds  of  claims  might  not  know  they  have  a  right  to\nadministrative  review.  For  this  reason  the  judge\nexcused,  on  a  class-wide  basis,  the  failure  to  exhaust\nadministrative  remedies  for  pre-determination  claims.\nOn the other hand, the judge thought that parents who\nhad  attended  an  IEP  meeting  would  understand  their\nright  to  administrative  review.  Accordingly,  the  judge\nheld that the administrative system is adequate for post-\ndetermination claims and declined to excuse the exhaus-\ntion requirement for this category.\nThis  approach  meant  the  plaintiffs  could  litigate\ntheir pre-determination claims as a class, but their post-\ndetermination  claims  had  to  proceed  individually  (or\nnot at all if administrative remedies had not been ex-\nhausted). Accordingly, the judge invited the plaintiffs to\ntry  again  at  class  certification  using  the  court’s  pre-\ndetermination/post-determination distinction. After two\nmore rounds of briefing, the judge settled on his own\nclass definition. On November 14, 2003, the court entered\nan order certifying the following class:\nThose students eligible for special education services\nfrom the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\nhave been or will be either denied or delayed entry\nor  participation  in  the  processes  which  result in  a\nproperly constituted meeting between the IEP team\nand the parents or guardians of the student.\nFollowing class certification and several years of dis-\ncovery, the court conducted a two-phase bench trial on\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 9\nliability.  In  Phase  I  the  court  heard  testimony  from\nexperts regarding MPS’s and DPI’s compliance with the\nIDEA. Satisfied that a full trial was warranted, the court\nconducted  lengthy  Phase  II  proceedings  in  which  the\nparties presented further evidence regarding the basis for\nthe  experts’  opinions.  In  a  written  decision  issued  on\nSeptember 11, 2007, the court found both MPS and DPI\nliable for “systemic” violations of the child-find require-\nments  of  the  IDEA.  Specifically,  the  court  found  that\nfrom September 2000 to June 2005, MPS committed the\nfollowing  IDEA  violations  on  a  system-wide  basis:  it\nfailed  to  identify  children  with  suspected  disabilities\nand refer them for evaluation within the statutory 90-\nday  time  frame;  improperly  extended  the  90-day  time\nframe;  imposed  suspensions  in  a  way  that  frustrated\ndisability  referrals;  and  failed  to  ensure  that  parents\nattended IEP meetings. The court also found that DPI\nfailed in its oversight duties.\nThe  court  based  its  liability  findings  primarily  on\nthe  opinion  testimony  of  Dr.  Diana  Rogers-Adkinson,\na  special-education  professor  at  the  University  of\nWisconsin-Whitewater  who  served  as  the  plaintiffs’\nprimary  expert.  She  reviewed  approximately  200  MPS\nstudent  files  but  engaged  in  no  statistical  analysis  or\nother accepted analytical method to determine whether\nany particular violation of the IDEA could properly be\ncharacterized  as  “systemic.”  Instead,  she  based  her\nopinion entirely on “patterns” or “trends” she observed\nin the student files. During the time period in question,\nMPS  annually  enrolled  95,000  to  97,000  students,  ap-\nproximately  16,000  of  whom  were  eligible  for  special\n\n10 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\neducation  every  year.  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson  did  not\nexplain how a  review of  200 student  files could  yield\na conclusion that MPS was in systemic violation of the\nIDEA during the relevant five-year period.\nIndeed,  the  court’s  64-page  liability  order  does  not\ncontain  any  analysis  subjecting  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson’s\ntestimony to the standards applicable to expert witnesses\nunder Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. To the\ncontrary,  the  court  expressly  acknowledged  that  her\nopinion  was  not  based  on  any  scientific  method  but\ninstead rested on what she loosely termed a “qualitative\nanalysis” of the student files she reviewed. After iden-\ntifying “certain patterns” and “trends” in the student files,\nDr. Rogers-Adkinson simply “projected” the patterns and\ntrends  “over  the  entire  MPS  district”  and  said  she\n“believe[d]  .  .  .  the  same  trends  would  appear  if  a\nscientific  or  true  random  sampling  of  files  had  been\nconducted.”  Without  mentioning  the  requirements  of\nRule  702,  the  court  summarily  accepted  Dr.  Rogers-\nAdkinson’s methodology as an adequate factual founda-\ntion for finding MPS in systemic violation of the IDEA:\n“The court accepts the qualitative analysis methodology\nused  by  Dr.  Rogers-Adkinson.  The  court  further\naccepts her Child Find trends or patterns and applies\nthem system wide to MPS.”\nIn response to the court’s liability order, DPI entered\ninto settlement negotiations with the plaintiff class and\neventually  presented  a  settlement  agreement  to  the\ncourt  for  approval. We  will  describe  it  in  more  detail\nlater,  but  in  brief,  DPI  agreed  to  order  MPS  to  meet\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 11\nvarious  compliance  benchmarks  within  a  certain  time\nframe and to pay for an independent monitor to oversee\nMPS’s performance. In exchange the plaintiff class dis-\nmissed its claims against DPI and gave away the rights\nof  class  members  to  bring  representative  suits  against\nDPI for IDEA violations predating the agreement. Over\nMPS’s  vigorous  objection,  the  district  court  approved\nthe settlement.\nThe case then proceeded to the remedial phase of the\ntrial  against  MPS  alone.  The  court  heard  evidence\nand argument on possible remedies, and on November 17,\n2008, ordered the parties to submit posttrial briefs re-\ngarding  their  final  remedial  proposals.  This  order\nincluded two pages of detailed questions, the answers to\nwhich  informed  the  content  of  the  parties’  final  pro-\nposals.  For  example,  the  court  directed  the  parties  to\naddress how putative members of the class were to be\nevaluated  for  inclusion  in  the  class;  how  individual\nliability  and  compensatory-education  determinations\nshould be made; which party should prevail when the\nevidence  is  inconclusive;  how  disputes  between  the\nparties should be resolved; and who should pay for the\ndispute-resolution process. The parties submitted briefs\noutlining  their  preferred  remedies  and  responded  to\neach other’s proposal.\nOn June 9, 2009, the court issued a lengthy order setting\nforth an elaborate court-monitored remedial scheme. The\ncourt  ordered  both  general  and  specific  class  notice\ndesigned  to  reach  the  parent  or  guardian  of  as  many\npotential  class  members  as  possible.  Recipients  would\n\n12 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nidentify  their  children  as  potential  class  members  by\nsubmitting response forms that would initiate a process\nof professional evaluation to determine whether or not\nthe child was a member of the class. The court ordered\nthe creation of a “hybrid” IEP team, closely resembling\nthe IEP team required by the IDEA but including a court-\nappointed independent monitor to oversee its operation.\nThe hybrid IEP team was charged with evaluating the\nresponses  to  the  class  notice  to  determine  how  to\nproceed in each individual case. In some cases it might be\nobvious that the  child is not disabled, and no further\nevaluation would be required. In others a professional\nevaluation would be required to determine whether the\nchild  has  a  disability.  In  others  a  full  IEP  meeting\nwould be needed to determine whether the child requires\nspecial-education services in order to receive a free ap-\npropriate public education. And finally, in some cases\nthe child might be entitled to compensatory education—\na remedy available under the IDEA—to compensate for\na  past  denial  of  a  free  appropriate  public  education.\nThe hybrid IEP team was given the authority to grant\ncompensatory-education  awards,  subject  to  the  court’s\noversight. The estimated cost to MPS to implement this\nremedy: between $11.5 and $40 million, depending on\nhow many parents responded and the extent of the com-\npensatory education awarded to qualifying children.\nThe June 9 remedial order also rejected some of the\nremedial proposals made by the parties. For example, the\njudge  rejected  the  plaintiffs’  request  for  a  segregated\ncompensatory-education fund and for “parent advocates”\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 13\nseparate  from  the  independent  monitor  and  denied\nMPS’s  request  for  a  binding-arbitration  system  to\nresolve disputes. Finally, the court ordered the parties to\nnegotiate  regarding  the  independent  monitor  and  the\nform  of  the  class  notice.  If  they  could  not  agree,  the\nparties were to submit nominations for the independent\nmonitor and a proposed class-notice form.\nMPS  appealed  the  June  9  remedial  order  and  also\nsought review of the court’s class-certification decision,\nthe liability order, and the court’s order approving the\nDPI  settlement.  The  plaintiffs  sought  review  of  the\ndistrict court’s rejection of their original class definition\nbut missed the deadline for filing a cross-appeal. In the\nmeantime the parties could not agree on an independent\nmonitor or class-notice form, so they submitted competing\nproposals on these two follow-on matters.\nOn August 19, 2009, the court entered an order naming\nthe  independent  monitor  and  charging  her  with  the\nresponsibility of “implement[ing] the remedy set forth\nwithin” the June 9 order. This brief order also summarizes\nthe independent monitor’s duties, explains how she is to\nbe paid, and provides some detail about how she would\ninteract with the parties and the court. In a second order\nissued  on  August  19,  the  court  approved  the  class-\nnotice form and explained how it should be distributed.\nThe plaintiffs appealed the August 19 orders, but they\nhave no quarrel with the substance of these decisions. That\nis, they do not disagree with the judge’s choice of an\nindependent  monitor  or  the  form  of  the  class  notice.\nInstead, they ask us to review the denial of their original\nclass-certification motion.\n\n14 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nBoth  sides  moved  to  dismiss  the  other’s  appeal  for\nlack of jurisdiction. MPS also moved to stay the June 9\nremedial  order  pending  resolution  of  its  appeal.  We\nconsolidated the cases, stayed the remedial order, and\nasked  the  parties  to  brief  the  jurisdictional  questions\nalong with the merits.\nII.  Discussion\nThese consolidated appeals raise important procedural\nand substantive issues regarding the suitability of IDEA\nclaims  for  class  certification,  the  kind  and  degree  of\nevidence necessary to find a local school district in sys-\ntemic violation of the IDEA, and the propriety of a federal-\ncourt  takeover  of  a  school  district’s  special-education\nprogram  as  a  remedy  for  individual  IDEA  violations.\nWe begin, however, with jurisdictional issues.\nA.  Jurisdiction\nBoth  appeals  claim  appellate  jurisdiction  under  28\nU.S.C.  §  1292(a)(1),  which  permits  immediate  appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order “granting, continuing, modi-\nfying,  refusing  or  dissolving”  an  injunction.  Section\n1292(a)(1) “creates an exception from the long-established\npolicy against piecemeal appeals,” but “[t]he exception is\na  narrow  one  and  is  keyed  to  the  ‘need  to  permit\nlitigants to effectually challenge interlocutory orders of\nserious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’” Gardner v.\nWestinghouse Broad. Co., 437 U.S. 478, 480 (1978) (quoting\nBalt.  Contractors  v.  Bodinger,  348  U.S.  176,  181  (1955)).\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 15\nAccordingly,  mandatory  interlocutory  orders  are  con-\nsidered injunctions reviewable under § 1292(a)(1) “only\nif they effectively grant or withhold the relief sought on\nthe merits and affect one party’s ability to obtain such\nrelief in a way that cannot be rectified by a later appeal\n(that is, ‘irreparably’).” In re City of Springfield, Ill., 818 F.2d\n565, 567 (7th Cir. 1987) (citing Stringfellow v. Concerned\nNeighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 377-79 (1987), and Carson\nv. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981)). Stated differ-\nently,  “[a]n  order  .  .  .  is  properly  characterized  as  an\n‘injunction’  when  it  substantially  and  obviously  alters\nthe  parties’  pre-existing  legal  relationship.”  Jones-El  v.\nBerge, 374 F.3d 541, 544 (7th Cir. 2004) (citing Gautreaux\nv. Chi. Hous. Auth., 178 F.3d 951, 958 (7th Cir. 1999)).\nThe  parties  agree  that  by  ordering  the  creation  of\nthe  hybrid  IEP  system,  the  district  court  granted  an\ninjunction within the meaning of § 1292(a)(1), but they\ndisagree  about  which  order  achieved that  result.  MPS\nappealed from the June 9 remedial order and contends\nthat this order is the functional equivalent of an injunc-\ntion. The plaintiffs argue that MPS’s appeal was prema-\nture. They maintain that the remedial order did not fully\n“ripen” into an appealable injunction until the district\ncourt appointed the independent monitor and approved\nthe class notice on August 19.\nThe plaintiffs direct our attention to Sherpell v. Humnoke\nSchool District No. 5, 814 F.2d 538, 539-40 (8th Cir. 1987),\nand Groseclose v. Dutton, 788 F.2d 356, 361 (6th Cir. 1986),\nboth  of  which  held  that  an  order  requiring  parties  to\nsubmit  proposed  remedial  plans  is  generally  not  an\n\n16 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ninjunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). In our decision\nin  Springfield,  we  agreed  with  that  general  principle:\n“[O]nly directives awarding the relief plaintiffs seek or\nputting the case on a collision course with that relief are\n‘injunctions’  under  §  1292(a)(1).”  818  F.2d  at  568.  The\nplaintiffs  insist  that  the  June  9  order  was  merely  an\norder  to  formulate  proposals  for  the  independent\nmonitor and class notice and that it was only after the\nAugust 19 orders appointing the monitor and approving\nthe  class  notice  that  the  hybrid  IEP  system  was  truly\nin place.\nThis characterization of the June 9 order is disingen-\nuous.  It’s  true  that  the  court  directed  the  parties\nto consult with each other about the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the form of the class notice, and\nto submit proposals if they could not agree. But the bulk\nof the court’s 71-page order was devoted to evaluating\nthe comprehensive remedial proposals the parties had\nalready submitted and explaining the elaborate remedial\nscheme the court had crafted. The order established in\nfine detail the remedial program MPS was required to\nimplement—a  scheme  designed  to  produce  indi-\nvidualized  compensatory-education  awards,  the  ulti-\nmate relief sought in the case.\nAlthough the June 9 order left the identity of the inde-\npendent monitor and the content of the class notice to\nbe worked out by the parties, MPS’s obligations were\nnot contingent on those details. Whoever the monitor, and\nwhatever the form of the class notice, the June 9 order\nrequired  MPS  to  create  a  massive  identification  and\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 17\nevaluation  system  consuming  significant  educational\nresources  and  costing  millions  of  dollars.  Even  if  the\nhybrid IEP system could not begin operating until the\nindependent  monitor  was  appointed  and  the  class\nnotice was approved, the June 9 order gave the plaintiffs\nthe  relief  they  were  seeking  and  substantially  altered\nMPS’s legal rights. The remedial order is the functional\nequivalent of an injunction for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). See\nSpringfield,  818  F.2d  at  568.  We  have  jurisdiction  over\nMPS’s appeal; the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss is denied.\nIn  contrast,  the  plaintiffs’  jurisdictional  argument  in\nsupport of their own appeal is at best inconsistent and at\nworst incoherent. The plaintiffs initially tried to cross-\nappeal from the June 9 remedial order, seeking review\nof  the  denial  of  their  original  class-certification  mo-\ntion. But they missed the filing deadline, so they tried a\ndifferent  route  to  get  their  preferred  class  definition\nbefore this court: They appealed the August 19 orders\nappointing  the  independent  monitor  and  approving\nthe class notice, insisting that these orders are the “injunc-\ntion” for purposes of § 1292(a)(1). They are not. Unlike\nthe June 9 order, the August 19 orders do not grant relief\non  the  merits  or  substantively  alter  the  parties’  legal\nrelationship.  See  Jones-El,  374  F.3d  at  544;  Springfield,\n818 F.2d at 567. They do not require the parties to do\nor  refrain  from  doing  anything  at  all.  The  district\ncourt  had  already  announced  the  remedial  scheme  in\nthe June 9 order, including the appointment of an inde-\npendent  monitor  and  the  requirement  of  general  and\nspecific class notice. All that remained was to decide the\nidentity  of  the  monitor  and  approve  the  form  of  the\n\n18 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nclass  notice.  These  details  were  surely  important,  but\nresolving them did not amount to an appealable injunc-\ntion.  Cf.  Jones-El,  374  F.3d  at  544  (“[A]n  unappealable\norder is one that interprets or clarifies a prior order and\ndoes not create new rights or obligations independently\nenforceable through a contempt action.”).\nMoreover, the plaintiffs are plainly engaged in a boot-\nstrapping  procedural  maneuver.  They  have  no  com-\nplaint about the independent monitor or the class notice,\nthough they appealed those decisions; rather, they want\nus to review the denial of their original class-certifica-\ntion  motion.  This  is  an  improper  attempt  to  revive\ntheir  untimely  cross-appeal  from  the  June  9  remedial\norder. We dismiss the plaintiffs’ appeal.\nFinally, MPS seeks review of the district court’s orders\ncertifying  the  class,  finding  liability,  and  approving\nDPI’s  settlement. Ordinarily  these  interlocutory  orders\nwould be unappealable, but MPS argues that the doc-\ntrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction applies. In Swint\nv. Chambers County Commission, 514  U.S. 35,  51  (1995),\nthe Supreme Court ”‘set out a general rule against exer-\ncising  pendent  jurisdiction  over  related  rulings.’”\nMcKinney v. Duplain, 463 F.3d 679, 692 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(quoting Watkins v. City of Oakland, Cal., 145 F.3d 1087, 1092\n(9th Cir. 1998)). Pendent appellate jurisdiction “may be\ninvoked  ‘only  if  there  are  compelling  reasons  for  not\ndeferring the appeal of the former order to the end of the\nlawsuit.’ ” Montano v. City of Chicago, 375 F.3d 593, 599\n(7th Cir. 2004) (quoting U.S. for Use of Valders Stone &\nMarble, Inc. v. C-Way Constr. Co., 909 F.2d 259, 262 (7th\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 19\nCir. 1990)). We may “review an otherwise unappealable\ninterlocutory  order  if  it  is  ‘inextricably  intertwined\nwith  an  appealable  one.’”  Research  Automation,  Inc.  v.\nSchrader-Bridgeport  Int’l,  Inc.,  626  F.3d  973,  977  (7th\nCir. 2010) (quoting Montano, 375 F.3d at 599). In other\nwords,  ”‘it  must  be  practically  indispensable  that  we\naddress the merits of the unappealable order in order to\nresolve the properly-taken appeal.’” Montano, 375 F.3d\nat 600 (quoting Valders Stone & Marble, 909 F.2d at 262).\nIf an otherwise unappealable order is sufficiently inter-\ntwined  to  permit  pendent  appellate  jurisdiction,  we\nmay exercise our discretion to review it. Jones v. InfoCure\nCorp., 310 F.3d 529, 536-37 (7th Cir. 2002).\nThe decision to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction\nis inherently case specific. See Montano, 375 F.3d at 600.\nHere, our review of the appealable order—the June 9 order\nimposing the remedial scheme—simply cannot be con-\nducted in isolation from the earlier orders. The June 9\norder  imposes  a  remedy  for  MPS’s  liability  to  the\nplaintiff class; deferring review of the class-certification\nand liability decisions until after final judgment would\nmake our present review of the remedial scheme mean-\ningless. As this case comes to us, it is “practically indis-\npensable”  that  we  review  the  class-certification  and\nliability orders now “in order to resolve the properly-\ntaken appeal.” Id.; see also Asset Allocation & Mgmt. Co. v.\nW.  Emp’rs  Ins.  Co.,  892  F.2d  566,  569  (7th  Cir.  1989)\n(“[A]ny ruling on which the validity of the [appealable\norder] turns is reviewable . . . .”).\nThe court’s order approving DPI’s settlement presents\na closer question, but viewing the case as a whole, we\n\n20 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthink this order is so closely linked with the others that\nit cannot be separated. Because we vacate the class certifi-\ncation,  declining  to  exercise  pendent  jurisdiction  over\nthe order approving DPI’s settlement would create the\nstrangely  anomalous  result  of  a  free-standing  district\ncourt  order  approving  and  incorporating  a  settlement\nbetween a defendant and a class that no longer exists.\nFurthermore,  with  essentially  the  entire  case  already\nbefore us, deferring appellate review of the settlement\nwould create rather than prevent piecemeal appeals; this\ntoo  favors  pendent  appellate  review.  See  Greenwell  v.\nAztar Ind. Gaming Corp., 268 F.3d 486, 491 (7th Cir. 2001).\nB.  Class Certification\n“The  class  action  is  ‘an  exception  to  the  usual  rule\nthat litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the indi-\nvidual  named  parties  only.’”  Wal-Mart  Stores,  Inc.  v.\nDukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2550 (2011) (quoting Califano v.\nYamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979)). A district court\nmay certify a case for class-action treatment only if it\nsatisfies the four requirements of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure  23(a)—numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,\nand adequacy of representation—and one of the condi-\ntions of Rule 23(b). See FED. R. CIV. P. 23. In addition, a\nclass  must  be  sufficiently  definite  that  its  members\nare ascertainable. Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506,\n513 (7th Cir. 2006); see Simer v. Rios, 661 F.2d 655, 669\n(7th Cir. 1981) (“It is axiomatic that for a  class action\nto be certified a ‘class’ must exist.”).\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 21\nClass  certification  is  appropriate  only  if,  “after  a\nrigorous  analysis,”  the  trial  court  is  satisfied  that  the\nrequirements of Rule 23 have been met. Wal-Mart, 131\nS.  Ct.  at  2551  (quotation  marks  omitted).  “Frequently,\nthat ‘rigorous analysis’ will entail some overlap with the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s underlying claim. That cannot be\nhelped.” Id.; see also Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 634 F.3d 883, 890 n.6 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing Szabo v.\nBridgeport Machs., Inc., 249 F.3d 672, 676 (7th Cir. 2001)).\nWe  review  the  district  court’s  class-certification  order\nfor abuse of discretion, but legal determinations made\nin support of the decision are reviewed de novo. Andrews\nv. Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 573 (7th Cir. 2008).\nThere are several basic flaws in the district court’s class-\ncertification decision. First, the class is both fatally indefi-\nnite and lacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2).\nFurthermore, although the case was certified as a class\naction  for  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  under\nRule  23(b)(2),  final  injunctive  or  corresponding  de-\nclaratory relief cannot be ordered on a class-wide basis,\nas required for a Rule 23(b)(2) class.\nWe begin with the terms of the class definition, some-\nthing  over  which  the  parties  and  the  judge  struggled\nmightily.  The  plaintiffs  initially  sought  to  represent  a\nclass  so  broad  that  it  effectively  included  all  students\neligible for special education and related services from\nMPS. The original proposed class thus joined together\nall  Milwaukee-area  disabled  students,  regardless  of\ndifferences in their disabilities or educational situations,\nwhose procedural or substantive rights under the IDEA\n\n22 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nwere  violated  in  any  way.  The  district  court  properly\nrejected this sweeping class definition, but not for the\nobvious reason that it sought to lump together thousands\nof  disparate  plaintiffs  with  widely  varying  individual\nclaims. Rather, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ proposed\nclass definition based on difficulties associated with the\nIDEA’s  requirement  that  administrative  remedies  be\nexhausted before filing suit.\nThe district court was justifiably concerned about the\nadministrative-exhaustion  requirement.  But  the  court’s\neffort to resolve the problem was misguided. The court\nsua sponte divided the class into two categories: those\nwith “pre-determination claims” and those with “post-\ndetermination  claims.”  These  designations  were  ap-\nparently meant to categorize individual violations of the\nIDEA,  separating  those  that  occurred  prior  to  an  IEP\nmeeting from those that occurred after an IEP meeting.\nThe judge thought this categorization made it possible\nto  excuse  the  exhaustion  requirement  for  “pre-deter-\nmination claims” and allow these  alleged IDEA viola-\ntions  to  be  litigated  on  a  class-wide  basis,  while\nenforcing the exhaustion requirement for “post-determina-\ntion claims,” excluding them from class-action treatment.\nThere is reason to doubt the propriety of this approach,\nbut for present purposes we will address it on its own\nterms.  Ordinarily,  a  plaintiff  may  not  file  an  IDEA\nlawsuit without first exhausting available administrative\nremedies. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415; Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305,\n326-27 (1988); Charlie F. v. Bd. of Educ. of Skokie Sch. Dist. 68,\n98 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 1996). However, exhaustion may\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 23\nbe excused if administrative review would be futile or\ninadequate. Honig, 484 U.S. at 326-27. The district court\napplied  this  exception  to all  pre-determination  claims,\nreasoning  that  the  parents  of  disabled  students  might\nnot  be  fully  aware  of  the  right  to  administrative\nremedies prior to a properly constructed IEP meeting,\nmaking exhaustion an exercise in futility.2 Once an IEP\nmeeting  is  convened,  however,  the court  thought  that\n2 We  question  this  reasoning.  Wisconsin  law  requires  that\nparents be notified of their administrative-review rights when\na child is initially referred for evaluation, well before an IEP\nmeeting  occurs.  WIS.  STAT.  §  115.792(1)(b).  For  this  reason\nthe  defendants  argued  below  that  if  exhaustion  was  to  be\nexcused on a class-wide basis for violations occurring before\nparents  received  notice  of  their  right  to  administrative\nremedies,  it  should  be  excused  for  pre-referral  claims  only.\nThe  district  court  rejected  this  argument,  perceiving  “too\ngreat” a “potential of having parties unwittingly forgo their\nrights.”  Even  when  notice  of  administrative  remedies  was\nprovided, the judge was “not sanguine with the fact that this\ninformation is always properly delivered or that the parents\nhave a full understanding of the information.” Let’s assume\nfor the sake of argument that it was appropriate to waive the\nexhaustion requirement on a class-wide basis on the rationale\nthat parents “lacked full understanding” of their rights. The\nplaintiffs,  as  the  proponents  of  the  futility  exception  to\nthe exhaustion requirement, would bear the burden of estab-\nlishing this lack of understanding. See Polera v. Bd. of Educ.\nof Newburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., 288 F.3d 478, 488 n.8 (2d\nCir. 2002). That burden is not satisfied by the district court’s\nunsupported  intuition  that  notice  might  not  always  be\n“properly delivered” or that parents might not always under-\nstand it.\n\n24 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nparents  would  sufficiently  understand  their  rights,\nmaking  administrative  review  adequate  and  keeping\nthe IDEA’s exhaustion requirement intact for post-determi-\nnation  claims.  On this rationale the  court was  willing\nto certify a class defined to include only pre-determina-\ntion claims, for which it excused the plaintiffs’ failure\nto exhaust administrative remedies.3\n3 In  settling  on  the  pre-determination/post-determination\nline of demarcation, the district court relied heavily on the\nconcept of  “systemic”  IDEA  violations  developed  by  other\ncircuits,  most  prominently  the  Ninth  Circuit  in  Doe  ex  rel.\nBrockhuis v. Arizona Department of Education, 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th Cir. 1997). Doe discussed the distinction between “systemic”\nand “nonsystemic” IDEA claims in the context of deciding\nwhether to apply the futility exception to excuse the plaintiffs’\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a\nclass-action suit. Here, however, the district court applied the\nNinth Circuit’s definition of a “systemic” IDEA violation in\ndetermining MPS’s liability, using it as the substantive legal\nstandard for evaluating whether MPS was in noncompliance\nwith  the  IDEA  system-wide.  We  question  whether  Doe’s\ndefinition of “systemic” IDEA noncompliance has any value\noutside  its  specific  context—that  is,  outside  the  context  of\ndeciding as a threshold matter in a proposed IDEA class action\nwhether to excuse the failure to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies. And even in that context, the line drawn in Doe between\nsystemic  and  nonsystemic  violations  for  purposes  of  the\nexhaustion requirement seems rather arbitrary. While some\nIDEA  violations  may  implicate  the  structure  of  a  school\ndistrict’s  special-education  program  and  may  not  be\nremediable through ordinary administrative review, it does\nnot necessarily follow that administrative review is futile or\n(continued...)\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 25\nThe court thus certified a class of its own creation:\nThose students eligible for special education services\nfrom the Milwaukee Public School System who are,\nhave been or will be either denied or delayed entry\nor  participation  in  the  processes  which  result in  a\nproperly constituted meeting between the IEP team\nand the parents or guardians of the student.\nIn other words, the certified class combined all disabled\nstudents  eligible  for  special  education  from  MPS  who\nwere not identified as potentially eligible for services, not\ntimely  referred  for  evaluation  after  identification,  not\ntimely  evaluated  after  referral,  not  evaluated  in  a\nproperly constituted IEP meeting, or whose parents did\nnot  (for  whatever  reason)  attend  an  otherwise  proper\nIEP  meeting.  The  court  made  it  clear  that  students\nwho  suffered  a  pre-determination  violation  but  have\nsince received a proper IEP meeting—for example, stu-\ndents  who  received  a  late  IEP  meeting—are  also  in-\ncluded in the class.\nOne  immediately  obvious  defect  in  this  class  is  its\nindefiniteness.  A  significant  segment  of  the  class  (of\nunknown  and  unknowable  size)  comprises  disabled\nstudents who may have been eligible for special education\n3 (...continued)\ninadequate for all violations that are alleged to be “systemic.”\nHowever, because our decision rests on other flaws in the class-\ncertification decision and does not reach the substance of the\ncourt’s  liability  decision,  we  neither  accept  nor  reject  the\nNinth Circuit’s reasoning in Doe.\n\n26 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nbut were not identified and remain unidentified. There is\nno question that MPS has a legal obligation under the\nIDEA to seek out disabled students and refer for evalua-\ntion  those  it  reasonably  believes  are  disabled  and  in\nneed of special education. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3)(A);\nWIS.  STAT.  §  115.77(1m)(a).  The  failure  to  properly\nidentify a disabled student can itself be a violation of\nthe IDEA if the failure results in the denial of a free ap-\npropriate public education to a qualifying child with a\ndisability. Cf. Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129 S. Ct. 2484,\n2495  (2009)  (“A  reading  of  the  Act  that  left  parents\nwithout  an  adequate  remedy  when  a  school  district\nunreasonably failed to identify a child with disabilities\nwould not comport with Congress’ acknowledgment of\nthe paramount importance of properly identifying each\nchild eligible for services.”). The problem with a class\nof  potentially  eligible  but  unidentified  students  is  not\nthat  their  rights  might  not  been  violated  but  that  the\nrelevant  criteria  for  class  membership  are  unknown.\nBy what standard is class membership to be determined?\nHow is the court to decide whether there was reason\nto believe in 2000-2005 that a presently unidentified child\nwas  potentially  eligible  for  special-education  services\nfrom MPS? It’s not hard to see how this class lacks the\ndefiniteness required for class certification; there is no\nway to know or readily ascertain who is a member of the\nclass.4 See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513; Simer, 661 F.2d at 669.\n4 Typical  suits  for  child-find-violations  focus  on  a  school\ndistrict’s failure to timely identify a qualifying disability in an\nidentified student, e.g., Richard S. v. Wissahickon Sch. Dist., 334\n(continued...)\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 27\nOf course, unidentified but potentially eligible disabled\nstudents  are  defined  not  only  by  having  not  been\nidentified but also by having a disability. If we could\neasily identify all Milwaukee students with disabilities\nduring the relevant time period, perhaps we could cross-\ncheck that list against a list of known disabled students\nto determine which students MPS failed to identify and\nrefer  for  an  IEP  evaluation.  But  identifying  disabled\nstudents  who  might  be  eligible  for  special-education\nservices  is  a  complex,  highly  individualized  task,  and\ncannot be reduced to the application of a set of simple,\nobjective  criteria.  Every  step  of  the  child-find  inquiry\nand IEP process under the IDEA is child specific and\nrequires  the  application  of  trained  and  particularized\nprofessional educational judgment. In short, a class of\nunidentified but potentially IDEA-eligible disabled stu-\ndents is inherently too indefinite to be certified.\nThis  conclusion  draws  support  from  Adashunas  v.\nNegley,  626  F.2d  600  (7th  Cir.  1980).  The  plaintiffs  in\nAdashunas  alleged  widespread  violations  of  the  child-\nfind  requirements  in  the  IDEA’s  predecessor  statute\nand proposed a class consisting of “all children within\n4 (...continued)\nF. App’x 508, 510 (3d Cir. 2009), or a school district’s failure\nto identify a disability despite a parental referral, e.g., Forest\nGrove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 129 S. Ct. 2484, 2488 (2009). In both\nsituations  the  identity  of  the  student  is  known.  The  class\nhere  includes  all  students  not  properly  identified  as\npotentially eligible for special education, the vast majority of\nwhom are not individually known.\n\n28 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthe  State  of  Indiana  entitled  to  a  public  education\nwho  have  learning  disabilities  who  are  not  properly\nidentified  and/or  who  are  not  receiving  such  special\ninstruction as to guarantee them of minimally adequate\neducation.” Id. at 601. We noted the practical difficulty\nin  defining  the  class  in  this  way:  “How  does  one\nidentify class members consisting of persons not identi-\nfied?” Id. at 603. In theory such a class might make sense\nif  the  process  of  identifying  unknown  class  members\nwas relatively simple. But because the task of identifying\nlearning-disabled children is a “long, arduous process,”\nand  the  proposed  class  of  plaintiffs  was  “so  highly\ndiverse  and  so  difficult to  identify,” we  held  that the\nclass was “not adequately defined or nearly ascertain-\nable” and the class action could not be maintained. Id. at\n603-04  (citing  DeBremaecker  v.  Short,  433  F.2d  733,  734\n(5th Cir. 1970)). The same is true here.\nThe plaintiffs insist that because the class is defined\nby reference to MPS’s illegal actions—that is, by MPS’s\nfailure to comply with the IDEA—the defect of indefinite-\nness  may  be  forgiven.  For  this  principle  they  rely  on\nAlliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 977-\n78 (7th Cir. 1977), in which we upheld the certification\nof two plaintiff classes consisting of organizations and\npersons  in  Chicago  who  had  been  unconstitutionally\nmonitored  and  harassed  by  various  municipal  and\nfederal  defendants  in  retaliation  for  exercising  their\nFirst  Amendment  rights.  The  defendants  in  Rochford\nargued  that  this  class—potentially  large  in  scope  and\nwith no ready means of identifying its members—was\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 29\ntoo  indefinite  to  be  certified.  We  concluded  that  “a\nclass  that  satisfies  all  of  the  other  requirements  of\nRule 23 will not be rejected as indefinite when its con-\ntours are defined by the defendants’ own conduct.” Id.\nat 978.\nRochford’s tolerance of a wildly indefinite class defini-\ntion  under  Rule  23  is  no  longer  the  norm.  We  have\nnoted  that  “[Rochford]  is  a  relic  of  a  time  when  the\nfederal  judiciary  thought  that  structural  injunctions\ntaking control of executive functions were sensible. That\ntime is past.” Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 626 (7th\nCir.  2008).  Moreover,  the  class  certified  in  Rochford  is\ndifferent from the one here in at least two critical respects.\nFirst,  for  reasons  we  will  explain  in  a  moment,  class\ncertification  in  this  case  does  not  comply  with  other\nrequirements of Rule 23; more specifically, the class does\nnot  satisfy  Rule  23(a)(2)’s  commonality  requirement,\nand it does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2). Second, the defen-\ndants’ actions in Rochford provided at least some means\nof  identifying  class  members:  Each  class  member  was\nthe victim of some discrete act of harassment that once\nrevealed—for  example,  through  discovery—would  in\nturn reveal the identity of the victimized class member.\nNot so with the present class. MPS’s alleged failure to\nidentify  disabled  students  in  no  way  pins  down  the\nidentities  of  the  class  members;  the  relevant  conduct\nhere is not a discrete action as in Rochford but rather a\nfailure to act. The liability and remedial orders are power-\nful  evidence  of  this  difference;  the  elaborate  scheme\nfor identifying class members via a hybrid IEP process\n\n30 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ndramatically  illustrates  the  fatal  indefiniteness  of  this\nclass. Rochford is no help to the plaintiffs here.5\nBeyond its inherent indefiniteness, the class certified\nhere fails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2)’s commonality prereq-\nuisite,  which  requires  that  the  class  claims  involve\n“questions of law or fact common to the class.” FED. R. CIV.\nP. 23(a)(2). It’s true that ” ‘[e]ven a single [common] ques-\ntion’  will  do.”  Wal-Mart,  131  S.  Ct.  at  2556  (quoting\nRichard A. Nagareda, The Preexistence Principle and the\nStructure of the Class Action, 103 COLUM. L. REV. 149, 176,\nn.110  (2003))  (alteration  in  original).  But  the  Supreme\nCourt  explained  in  Wal-Mart  that  superficial  common\nquestions—like whether each class member is an MPS\nstudent or whether each class member “suffered a viola-\ntion of the same provision of law”—are not enough. Id. at\n2551.  Rather,  “[c]ommonality  requires  the  plaintiffs  to\ndemonstrate that the class members ‘have suffered the\nsame injury.’” Id. (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon,\n457 U.S. 147, 157 (1982)). The class “claims must depend\nupon a common contention,” and “[t]hat common con-\ntention,  moreover,  must  be  of  such  a  nature  that  it\nis  capable  of  classwide  resolution—which  means  that\ndetermination  of  its  truth  or  falsity  will  resolve  an\nissue that is central to the validity of each one of the\nclaims in one stroke.” Id.\n5 Our conclusion that a class of child-find claims does not fit\nwithin Rochford’s carve-out is reinforced by the fact that we\ndecided  Adashunas  less  than  three  years  after  Rochford  but\ndid not even cite it.\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 31\nThe  plaintiffs  identify  the  following  common  issue:\n“[A]ll potential class members have suffered as a result\nof MPS’ failure to ensure their Child Find rights under\nIDEA and Wisconsin law.” This completely misunder-\nstands Rule 23(a)(2). Whether MPS failed in its obliga-\ntions under the IDEA and thereby deprived an eligible\ndisabled child of a free appropriate public education is\nthe bottom-line liability question in any individual plain-\ntiff’s  IDEA  claim.  To  bring  individual  IDEA  claims\ntogether to litigate as a class, the plaintiffs must show\nthat they share some question of law or fact that can be\nanswered  all  at  once  and  that  the  single  answer  to\nthat question will resolve a central issue in all class mem-\nbers’ claims. That all the class members have “suffered”\nas a result of disparate individual IDEA child-find viola-\ntions  is  not  enough;  it  does  not  establish  that  the\nindividual claims have any question of law or fact in com-\nmon. The plaintiffs have identified no common factual\nor legal question that satisfies the Rule 23(a)(2) standard,\nand it is their burden to do so. See Oshana, 472 F.3d at 513.\nTo illustrate the commonality problem in the certified\nclass,  consider  two  hypothetical  students  within  the\nclass:  one  has  a  disability  and  would  be  eligible  for\nspecial education but has never been identified as being\ndisabled  nor  gone  through  the  IEP  process;  another\nwas  identified  as  disabled  and  received  a  timely  IEP\nmeeting, but the child’s parents did not attend the IEP\nmeeting and were not notified of their right to do so. Both\nscenarios  involve  violations  of  the  IDEA,  but  what\ncommon  question  can  be  answered  that  would  assist\nthe court in determining MPS’s liability for each? On the\n\n32 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nplaintiffs’  theory,  that  question  is  something  like  this:\nDid MPS fulfill its IDEA obligations to each child? But\nwhile that generic question is surely a part of both chil-\ndren’s claims, it must be answered separately for each\nchild based on individualized questions of fact and law,\nand  the  answers  are  unique  to  each  child’s  particular\nsituation.\nThis was the basic commonality problem in Wal-Mart,\nwhich  involved  a  nationwide  class-action  suit  on\nbehalf  of  female  employees  of  the  discount  retailer\nfor alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.\nThe  Supreme  Court  summarized  the  lack  of  com-\nmonality in this way:\nIn  this  case,  proof  of  commonality  necessarily\noverlaps with respondents’ merits contention that Wal-\nMart engages in a pattern or practice of discrimina-\ntion. That is so because, in resolving an individual’s\nTitle VII claim, the crux of the inquiry is the reason\nfor a particular employment decision . . . . Here respon-\ndents wish to sue about literally millions of employ-\nment decisions at once. Without some glue holding\nthe alleged reasons for all those decisions together,\nit will be impossible to say that examination of all\nthe class members’ claims for relief will produce a\ncommon  answer  to  the  crucial  question  why  was\nI disfavored.\nWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2552 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations  omitted).  Here,  too,  resolving  any  individual\nclass member’s claim for relief under the IDEA requires\nan  inherently  particularized  inquiry  into  the  cir-\ncumstances of the child’s case.\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 33\nThat the court narrowed its focus to child-find viola-\ntions (what the court called “pre-determination claims”)\nis not enough. Child-find inquiries, like other aspects of\nthe IDEA, are necessarily child specific. There is no such\nthing as a “systemic” failure to find and refer individual\ndisabled children for IEP evaluation—except perhaps if\nthere was “significant proof” that MPS operated under\nchild-find policies that violated the IDEA. See id. at 2553.\nAs  the  Supreme  Court  noted  in  Wal-Mart,  an  illegal\npolicy  might  provide  the  “glue”  necessary  to  litigate\notherwise highly individualized claims as a class. Id. at\n2552-54. But again, as in Wal-Mart, proof of an illegal\npolicy “is entirely absent here.” Id. at 2553; see also J.B. ex\nrel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1289 (10th Cir. 1999)\n(affirming  the  denial  of  class  certification  because  the\n“plaintiffs merely attempt to broadly conflate a variety\nof  claims  [under  the  IDEA  and  other  statutes]  to\nestablish  commonality  via  an  allegation  of  ‘systematic\nfailures’”).  Lacking  any  common  questions,  the  class\nfails to satisfy Rule 23(a)(2) and should not have been\ncertified.\nFinally,  it  should  be  clear  from  our  discussion  thus\nfar  that  the  district  court  also  erred  when  it  certified\nan  injunction  class  under  Rule  23(b)(2).  Rule  23(b)(2)\npermits the court to certify a case for class-action treat-\nment if “the party opposing the class has acted or refused\nto act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so\nthat final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\nrelief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.” FED.\nR.  CIV.  P.  23(b)(2).  The  final  clause  is  important:  The\n\n34 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ninjunctive or declaratory relief sought must be “final” to\n“the class as a whole.” See Kartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94. In\nother words, “claims for individualized relief . . . do not\nsatisfy [Rule 23(b)(2)].” Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2557. To\nthe contrary, “Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single\ninjunction  or  declaratory  judgment  would  provide\nrelief to each member of the class. It does not authorize\nclass  certification  when  each  individual  class  member\nwould be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory\njudgment against the defendant.” Id.\nThat  the  plaintiffs  have  superficially  structured\ntheir case around a claim for class-wide injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a\nsubstantive  matter  the  relief  sought  would  merely\ninitiate a process through which highly individualized\ndeterminations  of  liability  and  remedy  are  made;  this\nkind  of  relief  would  be  class-wide in  name  only,  and\nit would certainly not be final. See id. (“The key to the\n(b)(2)  class  is  ‘the  indivisible  nature  of  the  injunctive\nor  declaratory  remedy  warranted  .  .  .  .’  ”  (quoting\nRichard  A.  Nagareda,  Class  Certification  in  the  Age  of\nAggregate  Proof,  84  N.Y.U.  L.  REV.  97,  132  (2009)));  see\nalso id. at 2558 (“[T]he relief sought [under Rule 23(b)(2)]\nmust  perforce  affect  the  entire  class  at  once  .  .  .  .”);\nKartman, 634 F.3d at 892-94; Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. If\nindividualized relief is sought—even individual injunc-\ntive  relief—the  named  plaintiffs  must  look  elsewhere\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 35\nin Rule 23(b) to obtain certification.6 See Wal-Mart, 131\nS. Ct. at 2558-59; Kartman, 634 F.3d at 895.\nThe relief sought here does not come close to satisfying\nRule  23(b)(2)’s  standard.  That  much  is  clear  from  the\nintricate remedial scheme ordered by the district court,\nwhich requires thousands of individual determinations\nof class membership, liability, and appropriate remedies.\nWhile the compensatory-education remedies will often\nor  always  be  injunctive  in  nature,  there  can  be  no\nsingle  injunction  that  provides  final  relief  to  the class\nas a whole. It is no answer to say that the June 9 remedial\norder  affects  the entire  class;  that  order  merely  estab-\nlishes a system for eventually providing individualized\nrelief. It does not, on its own, provide “final” relief to\nany class member. See Andrews, 545 F.3d at 577. More-\nover, the remedial order requires class notice as a neces-\nsary element of its operation: Only those class members\nwho  respond  are  to  be  evaluated  within  the  hybrid\nIEP  system;  nonresponders  are  unaffected.  That  the\nputative class members must opt in after notice and then\nbe evaluated for membership in the class—before making\na  claim  for  entitlement  to  compensatory  education—\nbelies the notion that the court can provide final injunc-\ntive relief to the class as a whole. This is not the stuff of\na proper Rule 23(b)(2) class.\n6 Our discussion of commonality makes it clear that the present\nclass  does  not  satisfy  Rule  23(b)(3). Without  even  a  single\ncommon question of law or fact, common questions cannot\npredominate. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(b)(3).\n\n36 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nSo  the  class-certification  order  must  be  vacated.  It\nfollows that without a class to whom MPS can be liable\nand provide a remedy, the liability and remedial orders\nmust be vacated as well. What remains are the claims of\nthe individual plaintiffs; the district court did not find\na denial of a free appropriate public education in any\nindividual  case.7  Furthermore,  the  court’s  reasons  for\nexcusing  administrative  exhaustion  appear  to  have\nbeen  tied  to  the  class  allegations,  and  it’s  not  clear\nwhether the court would have excused exhaustion for\nany of the individual claims. Finally, it’s possible—perhaps\nlikely—that  some  of  the  named  plaintiffs’  individual\nfactual  circumstances  have  changed  such  that  their\nclaims are now moot. We leave to the district court on\nremand  the  task  of  determining  whether  anything\nremains  of  this  case  and  what,  if  anything,  should\nhappen next.\nC.  DPI Settlement\nFinally, we turn to DPI’s settlement with the plaintiff\nclass. A district court may approve a class settlement if\nit  is  “fair,  reasonable,  and  adequate.”  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.\n23(e)(2). We review an order approving a class settlement\n7 As stated in the remedial order: “[A]t no point did the court\nreceive  specific  evidence  from  educational  professionals\nwho engaged in an individualized assessment of the named\nplaintiffs, determined the nature of any denial of [a free appro-\npriate public education], and determined precisely what sorts\nof services were necessary . . . .”\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 37\nfor an abuse of discretion. Mirfasihi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp., 450\nF.3d  745,  748  (7th  Cir.  2006).  As  with  any  order\nreviewed under this standard, if the district court’s analy-\nsis  turned  on  an  error  of  law,  the  court  necessarily\nabused  its  discretion.  Wis.  Right  to  Life  State  PAC\nv. Barland, 644 F.3d 139, 150 (7th Cir. 2011).\nAfter the district court found MPS and DPI liable for\nIDEA  violations,  DPI  commenced  settlement  negotia-\ntions  with  class  counsel  and  eventually  submitted  a\nsettlement agreement for court approval. DPI agreed to\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee MPS’s IDEA\ncompliance and develop a compliance plan for MPS—\nwith  input  from  class  counsel  and  the  independent\nmonitor—establishing  specific  requirements  that  DPI\nwould in turn impose on MPS. The plan’s implementa-\ntion would be tied to several benchmarks DPI promised\nto enforce against MPS. Among other things, DPI agreed\nthat  MPS  would  evaluate  95%  of  referred  students\nwithin the statutory time frame; that MPS would make\nreasonable attempts to include a parent in 95% of IEP\nmeetings;  and  that  MPS  would  refer  95%  of  students\nwith  a  specified  number  of  suspensions  and  95%  of\nstudents  retained  in  grade  to  an  early  intervention\nsystem for the possibility of disability evaluations. The\nsettlement  also  gave  the  independent  monitor  sig-\nnificant  oversight  authority  over  MPS,  including  the\nability to order MPS to make administrative changes to\ncomply  with  the  settlement  agreement.  In  exchange\nfor  these  and  other  promises,  the  settlement  released\nDPI from all claims in this suit and also purported to\n\n38 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\npreclude all class members from bringing any representa-\ntive suit against DPI for IDEA violations that occurred\nprior to the settlement date.\nIt should be apparent from the foregoing description\nthat this settlement agreement is highly unusual. DPI’s\nprimary  concessions  require  performance  from  MPS,\nwhich is not a party to the agreement and did not con-\nsent. Sensing the problem, the district court allowed MPS\nto file an objection to the settlement. MPS argued that the\nsettlement  agreement  impermissibly  affected  its  legal\nrights and conflicted with state statutes governing DPI’s\noversight  authority.  The  district  court  framed  the\nquestion  this  way:  Does  “DPI  ha[ve]  the  authority  to\norder  MPS  to  take  the  actions  called  for  in  the  pro-\nposed  settlement  agreement[?]”  If  DPI  has  the  legal\nauthority to command MPS to take the specified actions,\nthen the state agency’s agreement to impose mandates\non MPS would pose no problem. But if DPI does not\nhave that legal authority—stated differently, if MPS has\na legal right to resist such a demand from DPI—then a\nsettlement agreement binding DPI to impose mandates\non MPS, a nonparty, infringes MPS’s legal rights.\n“The general rule . . . is that a non-settling party does not\nhave standing to object  to a settlement between other\nparties.” Agretti v. ANR Freight Sys., Inc., 982 F.2d 242,\n246  (7th  Cir.  1992).  There  is  an  exception  when  the\nnonsettling  party  “can  show  plain  legal  prejudice\nresulting from the settlement.” See id. at 246-47 (citing\nQuad/Graphics, Inc. v. Fass, 724 F.2d 1230, 1233 (7th Cir.\n1983), and other cases). That a settling defendant creates\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 39\na  tactical  disadvantage  for  another  defendant  is  not\nsufficient to support standing to object; the prejudice to\nthe  nonsettling  defendant  must  be  legal,  such  as  (for\nexample)  interference  with  contractual  or  contribution\nrights or the stripping away of a cross-claim. Id. at 247.\nHere,  as  the  district  court  correctly  acknowledged,\nMPS’s  substantive  objection  to  the  settlement  and  its\nbasis for standing are one and the same: If the settlement\nagreement  prejudiced  MPS’s  legal  rights,  MPS  may\nobject, and its objection has merit.\nThe  district  court  ultimately  held  that  MPS  did  not\nhave  standing  to  object  because  DPI  has  authority  to\nimplement  the  agreement.  As  the  state  agency  with\nauthority  to  dispense  federal  special-education\nfunding, DPI is responsible for ensuring local compliance\nwith the IDEA’s requirements. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(11).\nSection  115.90  of  the  Wisconsin  Statutes  outlines  the\nthree enforcement mechanisms available to DPI should\na local school district fail to comply:\n(1) If, as the result of a monitoring procedure or a\ncomplaint investigation, the state superintendent finds\nthat  a  local  educational  agency  has  violated  this\nsubchapter, the state superintendent may require the\nlocal educational agency to submit a corrective plan ad-\ndressing the violation.\n(2) If the state superintendent, after reasonable notice\nand an opportunity for a hearing, finds that a local\neducational  agency  has  failed  to  comply  with  any\nrequirement in this subchapter, the state superinten-\ndent  shall  reduce  or eliminate  special  education  aid  to\n\n40 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthe local educational agency until he or she is satisfied\nthat the local educational agency is complying with\nthat requirement.\n(3) If the state superintendent finds that a corrective\nplan  under  sub.  (1)  has not been implemented,  or\nthat withholding aid under sub. (2) has been inade-\nquate to ensure compliance with this subchapter, the\nstate superintendent shall request the attorney general\nto  proceed  against  the  local  educational  agency for  in-\njunctive or other appropriate relief.\n(Emphasis added.)\nThe district court focused on DPI’s statutory authority\nunder  subsection  (2)  to  withhold  MPS’s  funding  for\nfailure to comply with the IDEA’s requirements. Because\nMPS retained the right to appeal any suspension of funds\nto the Department of Education, see 34 C.F.R. § 76.401,\nthe district court concluded that the settlement did not\nviolate  MPS’s  rights  but  rather  “could  be  viewed  as\nessentially another corrective action, similar to any one\nof the numerous other corrective action plans previously\nestablished by DPI.”\nThis analysis overlooks key parts of Wisconsin’s en-\nforcement scheme. It’s true that DPI has the authority\nto  reduce  MPS’s  federal  funding  or  eliminate  it  alto-\ngether.  But  the  settlement  agreement  does  not  im-\nplicate  DPI’s  authority  over  the  disbursement  of\nfederal funds; rather, DPI bound itself to impose a cor-\nrective plan on MPS. DPI does not, however, have the\nunilateral  authority  to  impose  a  corrective  plan  on  a\nnoncompliant  local  school  district.  To  the  contrary,\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 41\nDPI may only require that a local school district develop\nand submit a plan to address areas of IDEA noncompli-\nance; the details of the plan are left to the local school\ndistrict. See WIS. STAT. § 115.90(1). DPI can force a local\nschool  district  to  take  specific  remedial  action  only  if\nthe district fails to implement its own corrective plan.\nAlternatively, DPI can withhold or reduce federal funds,\nand if this more dramatic action does not induce compli-\nance, the state superintendent of public instruction can\nask  the  state  attorney  general  to  sue  to  bring  the\nschool district into compliance. See id. § 115.90(3).\nThe  local  school  district’s  autonomous  authority  to\ndevelop its own corrective plan is no small distinction\nin  the  context  of  this  case.  Because  DPI  cannot\nunilaterally force MPS to take specific remedial action, a\nsettlement  that  attempts  to  do  exactly  that  prejudices\nMPS’s legal rights by requiring more of MPS than Wis-\nconsin law permits DPI to impose. The district court’s\nconclusion  to  the  contrary  was  an  error  of  law,  and\nbecause the decision to approve DPI’s settlement turned\nin  large part on  this  legal  error,  that  decision  was  an\nabuse of discretion.8\n8 The  parties  note  a  change  in  Wisconsin  law  during  the\npendency  of  these  appeals.  Under  2009  Wisconsin  Act  215\n(published May 13, 2010), the state superintendent of public\ninstruction  is  empowered  to  order  certain  low-performing\nschool  districts  to  take  certain  remedial  actions.  However,\nAct 215 does not amend section 115.90, or any other provision\nin  the  Wisconsin  Statutes,  Chapter  115,  Subchapter  V,  the\n(continued...)\n\n42 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nApart  from  this  misunderstanding  about  DPI’s\nstatutory oversight authority, the district court’s approval\nof DPI’s settlement must be vacated for a much simpler\nreason: There can be no class settlement if the class should\nnot  have  been  certified  in  the  first  place.  See  Ortiz  v.\nFibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 858 (1999) (“[T]he determina-\ntion whether ‘proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive\nto warrant adjudication’ must focus on ‘questions that\npreexist any settlement.’” (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\nWindsor,  521  U.S.  591,  622-23  (1997))).  Although  class\ncertification and settlement approval were sought sepa-\nrately here, the caselaw on so-called “settlement only”\nclasses  is  instructive.9  The  Supreme  Court  has  made\nclear that a settlement-only class must satisfy the bulk\nof Rule 23’s requirements in order to be certified. See id.\nat  864;  Amchem,  521  U.S.  at  620.  And  when  a  district\ncourt abuses its discretion in certifying a settlement-only\nclass,  we  unwind  not  only  the  class  certification  but\nalso  the  class  settlement.  See,  e.g.,  Crawford  v.  Equifax\nPayment Servs., Inc., 201 F.3d 877, 881-82 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(vacating  order  approving  class  settlement  because\nclass did not satisfy Rule 23(b)). Basic principles of due\nprocess  prevent  individual  named  plaintiffs  from\nbinding—through  litigation  or  court-approved  settle-\n8 (...continued)\nstatutory scheme relevant to special education. Accordingly,\nAct 215 does not appear to affect the state regulatory apparatus\npertaining to the IDEA. \n9 Settlement-only classes are those for which class certifica-\ntion and settlement approval are sought simultaneously.\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 43\nment—absent class members the plaintiffs do not legally\nrepresent.10\nAs we have explained, the class here is fatally indefinite,\nlacks the commonality required by Rule 23(a)(2), and was\nimproperly  certified  under  Rule  23(b)(2).  Because  the\nnamed plaintiffs do not legally represent the absent class\nmembers, they cannot settle the absent class members’\nclaims. The district court’s order approving DPI’s settle-\nment must be vacated.\n10 As summarized by the Court in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.:\n[Class  actions]  implicate  the  due  process  “principle  of\ngeneral  application  in  Anglo-American  jurisprudence\nthat one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a\nlitigation in which he is not designated as a party or to\nwhich he has not been made a party by service of process,”\nHansberry v. Lee, [311 U.S. 32, 40 (1940)], it being “our ‘deep-\nrooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own\nday in court,’” Martin v. Wilkes, [490 U.S. 755, 762 (1989)]\n(quoting 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 4449, p. 417 (1981)); see Richards\nv. Jefferson County, [517 U.S. 793, 798-99 (1996)]. Although\n“‘[w]e have recognized an exception to the general rule\nwhen, in certain limited circumstances, a person, although\nnot a party, has his interests adequately represented by\nsomeone with the same interests who is a party,’” . . .\nMartin, [490 U.S. at 762 n.2], the burden of justification rests\non the exception.\n527 U.S. 815, 846 (1999).\n\n44 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nIII.  Conclusion\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  DISMISS  the  plaintiffs’\nappeal (number 09-3274) for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nWe DENY the motion to dismiss MPS’s appeal (number 09-\n2741). We VACATE the district court’s class-certification\norder, its liability order following Phase II of the trial,\nits order approving DPI’s settlement, and its remedial\norder  following  Phase  III  of  the  trial.  We  REMAND\nthe  case  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this\nopinion.\nROVNER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\nin part.  I share many of my colleagues’ concerns about\nthe way in which the class was defined in this case, and\nI  further  agree  that  because  DPI  lacked  the  authority\nto  unilaterally  impose  a  corrective  plan  on  a  local\nschool district, it was error to approve DPI’s settlement\nwith  the  plaintiffs.  However,  I  am  not  convinced  that\nno  class  was  feasible  in  this  case,  nor  do  I  believe\nthat  the  inability  to  identify  class  members  until  the\nremedial  phase  of  the litigation  precludes certification\nof the class. For these reasons, I write separately.\nOn its face, the class certified in this case bears the\nhallmarks of the sort of open-ended classes of which we\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 45\ndisapproved in Adashunas v. Negley, 626 F.2d 600, 603-04\n(7th Cir. 1980), and Rahman v. Chertoff, 530 F.3d 622, 625-26\n(7th Cir. 2008). Although the class that the district court\napproved (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside  within  the  MPS  district,  who  are  or  may  be\neligible  for  special  education  services,  and  who  are,\nhave been, or will be denied or delayed entry into or\nparticipation  in  the  IEP  process)  is  considerably  more\nnarrow  than  the  class  originally  proposed  by  the\nplaintiffs (all school age children with disabilities who\nreside within the MPS district and who are or may be\neligible  for  special  education  services),  it  was  never\nformally delimited by the particular types of violations\nthat  the  plaintiffs  were  alleging.  The  consequence  of\nsuch an open-ended description of the class, as we noted\nin Rahman, is that “every time plaintiffs file a brief or\nmotion, membership in the class[ ] may change.” Id. at 625.\nThus, at any given point during the litigation, it may not\nbe possible to know from the class definition itself what\nthe true parameters of the class are and what types of\nindividuals might be in the class. Id. at 625-26. In this\ncase, the class has been defined to include all students\neligible  for  special  services  who  have  been  denied  or\ndelayed  entry  into  the  IEP  system.  That  definition\nliterally  may  include  students  who  were  delayed  or\ndenied  entry  due  to  circumstances  having  little  or\nnothing to do with the defendants’ actions, by essentially\nrandom  circumstances  that  are  unique  to  one  student\nor limited to a small number of students, or by circum-\nstances that the class representatives have not identified\nas a basis for relief to the class.\n\n46 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nI am mindful that the parties and the court, from the\ntime  that  the  class  was  certified  forward,  appear  to\nhave developed an understanding that the class would\ninclude the four sets of individuals that the court later\nexpressly identified in its liability decision: (1) students\nwith suspected disabilities who were never referred for\nan evaluation; (2) students who were referred for evalua-\ntion, but whose evaluations were not completed within\nthe  requisite 90-day  limit;  (3)  students  who were  sus-\npended in such a way as to frustrate their evaluation;\nand (4) students whose IEP meetings took place in the\nabsence of their parents. See ante at 9; R. 195 at 3-6; R. 389\nat 61. Moreover, the court’s liability decision was limited\nto the time period commencing in September 2000 and\nending in June 2005. R. 389 at 3. In these respects, the\nlitigation ultimately focused on a class of students that\nwas much more limited than the certified class was on\nits face, and one that in the end was much more definite\nthan  the  sweeping  class  we  criticized  in  Adashunas,\nfor example.\nBut even as confined to these four groups of students\nand  this  roughly  five-year  period,  the  class  includes\nunknown numbers of variations. To cite one example:\nWhen, in her 2004 report, Dr. Rogers-Adkinson addressed\nMPS’s  failure  to  meet  statutory  deadlines  during  the\nassessment  process,  she  identified  at  least  four  differ-\nent patterns of delays: (1) delays occasioned by the initial\nmis-categorization  of  a  student’s  suspected  disability;\n(2)  delays  caused  by  extensions  of  time  routinely\nrequested for disability assessments solicited during the\nspring  semester;  (3)  delays  triggered  by  the  need  for\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 47\nadditional medical records; and (4) delays for reasons not\nrevealed in the files she reviewed. Plaintiffs’ Ex. 8 at 6, 8-9.\nEach  of  these  four  scenarios  might  be  a  manifesta-\ntion  of  MPS’s  failure  to  timely  identify  students  with\ndisabilities and to convene IEP meetings to address those\ndisabilities, but it is difficult to discern a common, wrong-\nful policy or practice that might account for them all.\nInstead, this looks more like an effort to sweep many\nindividual plaintiffs and sets of facts into one class on\nthe  premise  that  all  reflect  illegal  conduct  by  the\ndefendant in practice and culture if not in policy. As the\nmajority points out, ante at 32, that is precisely the sort\nof class that the Supreme Court recently rejected in Wal-\nMart  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Dukes,  131  S.  Ct.  2541  (2011).  Like\nmy colleagues, I am not convinced that the certified class\nin this case is united by common legal or factual issues.\nNonetheless,  I  do  not  rule  out  the possibility that a\nclass properly could be certified in this case or one like\nit, and it is to this limited extent that I dissent. My col-\nleagues have concerns both with the notion that a class\naction may be premised on “systemic” violations of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations and with a class\ncomposed  of  individuals  whose  identity  cannot  be\nknown until the remedial phase of the litigation. How-\never, I believe that notwithstanding the inherently child\nspecific  nature  of  child-find  inquiries,  a  class  action\nbased  on  a  truly  systemic  child-find  failure  may  be\nviable.  And  the  fact  that  it  may  not  be  possible  to\nidentify  individual  class  members  until  the  remedial\nphase of the litigation, when prospective members of the\nclass  are  invited  to  come  forward  and  establish  that\n\n48 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\nthey were among those injured by this systemic failure,\nshould not preclude a class action, which may be the\nonly  realistic  avenue  of  relief  for  those  injured  by\nsystemic violations of their rights.\nSystemic  violations  of  the  IDEA  are  cognizable.  See\nDoe ex rel. Brockhuis v. Ariz. Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 681\n(9th  Cir.  1997)  (coll.  cases).  The  problem  here  is  that\nthe  plaintiffs’  claims  appear  to  be  based  on  multiple,\ndisparate  failures  to  comply  with  the  school  district’s\nstatutory  child-find  obligations  rather  than  a  truly\nsystemic policy or practice which affects them all. But\nmy  colleagues  go  so  far  as  to  state  that  “[t]here  is\nno such thing as a ‘systemic’ failure to find and refer\nindividual disabled children for IEP evaluation—except\nperhaps  if  there  was  ‘significant  proof’  that  MPS\noperated  under  child-find  policies  that  violated  the\nIDEA.” Ante at 33 (emphasis in original) (citing Wal-Mart,\n130 S. Ct. at 2553). Certainly I agree that an illegal policy\nwould support a claim for a systemic violation of the\nIDEA’s child-find mandate. But I also think that wide-\nspread  practices  might  also  support  such  a  claim.  Cf.\nKing ex rel. King v. E. St. Louis School Dist. 189, 496 F.3d\n812,  817  (7th  Cir.  2007)  (citing  Calhoun  v.  Ramsey,  408\nF.3d  375,  379  (7th  Cir.  2005))  (noting  that  municipal\nliability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 may be based on customs\nand practices as well as formal, written policies). Suppose,\nfor  example,  that  MPS  ignored  and  did  not  refer  for\nevaluation students with a particular type of potential\ndisability—e.g., dyslexia—and as a result, large numbers\nof students with that disability went unidentified  and\nwere deprived of the educational services to which they\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 49\nwere entitled under the IDEA. To my mind, this would\nbe a genuinely systemic violation of the district’s child-\nfind obligations that would be amenable to recognition\nand remediation in a class action: Notwithstanding the\nfact  that each student  is unique  and is  entitled to  his\nown,  individualized  IEP,  all  members  of  the  class\nwould suffer a common injury resulting from the school\ndistrict’s failure to have appropriate systems in place to\nidentify students with that particular disability. Insisting\ninstead  that  each  student  exhaust  his  administrative\nremedies and/or sue independently would surely mean\nthat  many  such  students  would  reamin  unidentified\nand denied their right to free appropriate public educa-\ntion  (if  only  because  they  would  be  unaware  of  their\nrights) and likely would mean that the systemic viola-\ntion underlying their claims to relief would persist, as\nany individual proceedings would result in individual\nrather than structural relief.\nA key reason why my colleagues are reluctant to ac-\nknowledge  the  possibility  of  a  systemic  violation  of a\nschool district’s child-find obligations is the inability to\nidentify  individual  class  members  except  by  asking\nthe parents of putative class members to come forward\nat the remedial phase of the litigation and to establish, in\nindividual  hearings,  that  their  children  were  in  fact\nthe victims of the district’s child-find failures. But this\nmethod of identifying class members is hardly unprece-\ndented. Our decision in McDonald v. United Air Lines, Inc.,\n745 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir. 1984), reflects a similar approach.\nThe class in McDonald comprised women who had lost\ntheir jobs as a result of United Air Line’s rule (dating\nback  to  the  1930s)  prohibiting  marriage  for  its  female\n\n50 Nos. 09-2741 & 09-3274\ncabin attendants. Once this court declared the no-marriage\nrule to be a violation of Title VII’s ban on sex discrim-\nination in Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d 1194\n(7th Cir. 1971), any woman who had lost her position as\na result of that rule between the date Title VII took effect\nin  1965  and  United’s  abolition  of  the  rule  in  1968\nbecame entitled to relief. See McDonald v. United Air Lines,\nInc., 587 F.2d 357 (7th Cir. 1978). But many if not most\nof the class members had simply resigned their positions\nin  contemplation  of  the  no-marriage  rule  rather  than\nformally protesting the rule or waiting for the company\nto  discharge  them,  so  there  was  no  record  enabling\neasy  identification  of  those  women  who  left  because\nof the no-marriage rule as opposed to another reason.\nConsequently, the onus was on former flight attendants\nto come forward at the final stage of the litigation and\nclaim  entitlement  to  relief,  at  which  point  individual,\nadversarial  hearings  were  convened  before  special\nmasters  in  order  to  establish  whether  each  claimant\nin fact left her position because of the illegal rule. See\nMcDonald, 745 F.2d at 1087-88.\nAs in McDonald, there will be times when the nature\nof the challenged conduct makes it difficult if not impos-\nsible to identity who is in the class and is entitled to\nrelief absent some sort of opt-in procedure by putative\nclass members coupled with an adjudicatory procedure\nto confirm that they in fact qualify as class members. In\nMcDonald this was true because so many class members\nsilently  resigned  their  jobs  in  deference  to  their  em-\nployer’s  illegal  rule;  in  a  child-find  case  like  this  one\nit  would  be  true  because the  school  district  neglected\n\nNos. 09-2741 & 09-3274 51\nits obligation under the IDEA to identify students with\npotential disabilities. This is not a function of a poor or\nopen-ended  class  definition  as  in  Rahman,  but  rather\ndue  to  the  fact  that  the  defendant’s  conduct  did  not\nproduce  a  tidy  record  of  the  individuals  harmed  by\nthat conduct. Identifying class members in such circum-\nstances necessarily will require a relatively cumbersome,\nafter-the-fact inquiry of the sort employed in McDonald\nand as the district court envisioned here. The only alter-\nnative  is  to  foreclose  class-wide  relief  in  such  cases\nand  leave  each  individual  harmed  by  the  defendant’s\nconduct to pursue relief on his or her own, if he or she\nis even aware that a wrong has been committed. Realisti-\ncally, that will mean no relief at all for most individuals.\nFor all of these reasons, I concur in the court’s conclu-\nsion that the class certified in this case was improper, but\nI  do  not  join  its  conclusion  that  no  class  would  be\nviable in this case or other litigation alleging violation\nof  a  school  district’s  child-find  obligations  absent  an\nability to identify an express policy that violates the IDEA.\n2-3-12",

In the previous district court proceedings,\nJudge  Goodstein  certified  a c lass  based  upon al leged  violations  of t he  “child  find”\nrequirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  After a bench trial, the\nDepartment of Public Instruction reached a settlement with the class, agreeing to order the\nMilwaukee Public Schools to meet certain compliance benchmarks.\nOn appeal, the Seventh Circuit vacated the district court’s class-certification order.\nThe Seventh Circuit also vacated the settlement reached between the plaintiffs and the\nDepartment of Public Instruction.  The Seventh Circuit remanded for further proceedings,\nthe necessity of which appears to be an open question.  “What remains are the claims of the\nindividual plaintiffs; the district court did not find a denial of a free appropriate public\neducation  in  any  individual  case.   Fur thermore,  the  court’s  reasons  for  excusing\nCase 2:01-cv-00928-RTR   Filed 03/20/12   Page 1 of 2   Document 670\n\nadministrative exhaustion appear to have been tied to the class allegations, and it’s not clear\nwhether the court would have excused exhaustion for any of the individual claims.  Finally,\nit’s possible – perhaps likely – that some of the named plaintiffs’ individual factual\ncircumstances have changed such that their claims are now moot.  We leave to the district\ncourt on remand the task of determining whether anything remains of this case and what, if\nanything, should happen next.”  Jamie S. v. Mil. Pub. Sch., 668 F.3d 481, 499-500 (7th Cir.\n2012).\nIf the plaintiffs want to pursue this case any further, they should meet and confer with\nthe defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(f) and submit a proposed\ndiscovery plan within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  Failing that, the Court will\nenter an order of dismissal.\nDated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 20th day of March, 2012.\nBY THE COURT:\n__________________________\nHON. RUDOLPH T.
