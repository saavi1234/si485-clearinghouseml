    "summary": "<p>On May 21, 2011, plaintiffs, two men of color, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. ยง1983 and state law against the City of New York in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Foley Square. The plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked the court for injunction and compensatory relief, claiming that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had violated their rights by unreasonably searching them during routine livery cab stops.</p><p>On September 3, 2010, at 11:30 P.M., one plaintiff, a lawyer in the Bronx, was leaving work and chose to use a livery cab. The cab was enrolled in the Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP), which gave consent for the cab to be stopped and inspected by the NYPD. The cab displayed a decal that indicated enrollment in TRIP.  The NYPD stopped the livery cab, and ordered the plaintiff out of the vehicle. The plaintiff protested the search without reasonable suspicion, but the police indicated that enrollment in the TRIP program gave them the right to search passengers in the livery cab.  Nothing was found.</p><p>On October 30, 2010, at 3:00 A.M., the second plaintiff, who was a manager at a popular radio station and a comedian, was returning to his home in Brooklyn in a livery cab.  This cab was also enrolled in TRIP. The car was stopped and the plaintiff ordered to exit the vehicle, at which point the plaintiff's person and belongings were searched.  Again, nothing was found. </p><p>The plaintiffs' case was accepted by the NYCLU and the New York University School of Law Civil Rights Clinic, and a complaint was filed alleging that the search of passengers in livery cabs without reasonable suspicion was unconstitutional.</p><p>On May 14, 2012, the Court (Judge Richard M. Berman) entered a stipulation and order of dismissal, because the case had settled.  The Settlement contained $10,000 relief for each plaintiff ($20,000 total), $38,000 in attorney's fees, and injunctive-like provisions.  The NYPD agreed to suspend its routine searching of passengers of vehicles that were pulled over as part of the TRIPS program. The NYPD further agreed that it would only search passengers when reasonable suspicion of a violent crime existed.  Furthermore, the NYPD provided information that it was amending its training manual, informing officers at roll-call citywide (repeating it for 10 day periods, for three times over the next year), and issuing an operations order communicating the order to not search passengers absent reasonable suspicion of a violent crime during a TRIP stop.</p><p>The case was dismissed with the approval of the settlement.</p><p></p>",

      "text": "http://www.nyclu.org/news/nyclu-settlement-ends-stop-and-frisk-of-livery-cab-passengers  \n \n/ NYCLU SETTLEMENT ENDS STOP-AND-FRISK OF ...  \nNYCLU Settlement Ends Stop-and-Frisk of Livery \nCab Passengers \nMay 15, 2012 โ In settling a federal lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union, the \nBloomberg administration has agreed to train NYPD officers to stop the unlawful practice of \ndetaining, questioning and searching innocent New Yorkers โ particularly people of color โ who \nare passengers in livery cabs. \nThe NYCLU filed the lawsuit in May 2011, charging that the NYPD had used its Taxi/Livery \nInspection Program (TRIP) to expand the reach of its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices. \nPlaintiffs Terrence Battle and Munir Pujara, both men of color, were riding in livery cabs and \nwere detained, questioned and searched even though the livery drivers told officers there was no \nproblem and even though the officers did not suspect the plaintiffs of any wrongdoing. \nโBeing pulled out of a livery car late at night when I had done nothing wrong was outrageous \nand frightening,โ Battle said. โI can only hope this settlement saves others from a similar \nexperience.โ \nUnder the settlement, the NYPD last week instructed all officers about the lawful treatment of \npassengers, directing them that they are not to question, frisk, search or demand identification \nfrom passengers simply because they are riding in cars participating in the TRIP program. \nInstead, officers are to take no action against passengers unless the officers have independent \nsuspicion that the passenger has committed a crime. The NYPD will repeat these instructions in \nsix months and again in a year.  \nโUnder this settlement, the NYPD will undertake sweeping training of officers and commanders \nto halt the unlawful treatment of law-abiding passengers in livery cabs,โ said NYCLU Associate \nLegal Director Christopher Dunn, lead counsel in the case. โThis should put an end to the \nunjustified stopping and frisking of people whose only crime was to be riding in a livery car.โ  \nIn addition, the NYPD has issued an operations order to commanding officers throughout the \nDepartment directing them to assure that passengers are not mistreated under the TRIP \n\nprogram. Finally, the NYPD will add a training memorandum on TRIP to the NYPD Police \nStudentโs Guide, which is used in the training of cadets at the NYPD Police Academy. \nโThis is a victory for the right of all New Yorkers to go about their business without being \nunlawfully detained, questioned and searched by police,โ NYCLU Executive Director Donna \nLieberman said. โWhile the NYPD has agreed to take steps to end this discriminatory practice, \nits officers continue to subject record numbers of black and Latino new Yorkers to unlawful and \nsuspicionless street stops. Itโs time for the Bloomberg administration and the NYPD to put a \nstop to all discriminatory policing.โ  \nLivery cab drivers enroll in TRIP voluntarily. The program authorizes police officers to stop \nparticipating cabs, identifiable by a special decal, and to perform driver safety checks.  \nUnder the settlement, the city will pay both plaintiffs $10,000 in damages, as well as attorneysโ \nfees.  \nNYU Law School Civil Rights Clinic students Lisa Braff and Evan Parzych assisted Dunn on the \nlawsuit. \n ",

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT\nKELLY, Commissioner of the New York City\nPolice Department; WENDEL YN COSTANZA,\nPHILIP FACENDA, MICHAEL MILLER,\nTOMAS REYES, and JEFF TORREDA, members\nof the New York City Police Department, ECF Case\nDefendants.\n---;,-~--~---;,--~;:,-----------------------..-.----------------------)C\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n1. This is a civil rights action seeking to halt aNew York City Police Department practice\nof detaining, questioning, frisking, and searching law-abiding New Yorkers --primarily\nAfrican-Americans, Latinos, and other non-whites -- who ride in livery cars. These\ninnocent New Yorkers are targeted for this aggressive and frightening mistreatment, often\nlate at night, without any suspicion of wrongdoing. Rather, the NYPD is using aprogram\nthat allows it to stop livery cars to ask the drivers about their well-being and to visually\ninspect the cars as a license to remove passengers from the cars and to question, frisk, and\nsearch the passengers and to search their possessions.\n2. Plaintiff Terrence Battle, an African-American radio executive, was riding home in a\nBrooklyn livery car late at night in October 2010 when police officers stopped the car.\nEven though the driver told the officers there was no problem and even though the\nofficers had no reason to suspect Mr. Battle of any wrongdoing, they ordered him out of\n1\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 2 of 14\nthe car and then questioned, friskรซd, and searched him and his bag. Plaintiff Munir\nPujara, an attorney and of South Asian descent, had a similar experience when riding\nhome in a livery car in the Bronx in September 2010. In.both instances the officers who\nquestioned, frisked, and searched Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara stated that this was routine\nNYPD practice and claimed that each man had consented to this treatment by riding in a\nlivery car that was participating in the livery-car safety program.\n3. Under the NYPD's Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP), police officers may\npull over livery cars with decals indicating they have enrolled in the program, visually\ninspect the vehicles, and briefly question drivers. The plaintiffs do not challenge these\naspects of the program. Nothing about the program, however, can or does authorize\nofficers to detain, question, frisk, or search passengers without independent suspicion of\nwrongdoing. Nonetheless, the NYPD has apractice of doing so, with officers apparently\nbelieving that driver participation in the program means that passengers consent to this\ntreatment. And because livery cabs operate predominantly in non-white neighborhoods, it\nis African-Americans, Latinos, and other non-whites who bear the brunt ofthis unlawful\npractice, just as is true with the NYPD's notorious practice of stopping and frisking law-\nabiding pedestrians.\n4. The NYPD's practice of detaining, questioning, frisking, and searching passengers\nwithout suspicion under its TRIP program violates the United States and New York\nConstitutions. Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara seek a declaration that their treatment was\nunlawful, a declaration that the NYPD' spractice is unlawful, and an injunction against\nthe practice.\n2\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 3 of 14\nPARTIES\n5.

Terrence Battle is anative New Yorker who currently lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant\nneighborhood of Brooklyn with his two children. Mr. Battle is African-American and is\n38 years old.\n3\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 4 of 14\n12. Mr. Battle is a manager afprominent New York City radio stations Hot 97 and KISS FM\nand has worked in the radio business since 1991. He also works as a stand-up comedian\nperforming throughout New York City.\n13. Mr. Battle frequently takes livery cars, especially when his comedy performances end late\nin the night, because yellow cabs rarely are available in his neighborhood.\n14. On Saturday, October 30, 2010, Mr. Battle returned to Brooklyn after performing in a\ncomedy show in Manhattan. He got off the subway at the Broadway Junction stop in\nBedford-Stuyvesant sometime after 3:00 a.m.\n15. Mr. Battle got into a livery car to take him home from the station. He sat in the backseat\nof the car and placed his bag beside him. He was wearing ajacket, tee shirt, jeans, and a\nHot 97 hat.\n16. The livery car turned on to Mr. Battle's street around 3:30 a.m. As the car approached his\nhome, Mr. Battle noticed police lights flashing behind him. Initially unconcerned, he\nassumed the livery car was being pulled over for aminor reason such as abroken taillight.\n17. The livery driver pulled the car over to the side of the road. Sitting in the rear passenger\nseat, Mr. Battle saw three men in street clothing step out of the police car. They walked\nover to the parked livery car and stood by the driver's window. The men wore badges\naround their necks identifying them as police officers, but their names were not displayed.\nThe officers since have been identified as defendants Philip Facenda, Michael Miller, and\nThomas Reyes.\n18. One of the officers asked the driver if everything in the vehicle was alright. The driver\nsaid that everything was fine.\n4\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 5 of 14\n\"\n19. The officers, shining their flashlights, looked through the interior of the car. Mr. Battle\nwas still sitting in the rear passenger seat.\n20. One ofthe officers then ordered Mr. Battle to get out ofthe car. Though fearful, Mr.\nBattle cooperated and stepped out ofthe car.\n21. Mr. Battle stood next to the car door, with his back to the car. The three officers faced\nhim from the street, blocking any movement.\n22. Mr. Battle was alone in the street with the officers in the middle of the night. Vulnerable\nand exposed to the officers, Mr. Battle felt afraid. He made sure not to make any sudden\nmovements and kept his hands in view.\n23. Mr. Battle thought of incidents where African-Americans were killed or injured by NYPD\nofficers without provocation. Surrounded by three arrned police officers, Mr. Battle was\nin extreme fear for his personal safety.\n24. One of the of the officers demanded identification from Mr. Battle. Mr. Battle gave the\nofficer his driver's license.\n25. The police officers then searched Mr. Battle. He was patted down, and his jacket pockets\nwere searched. Mr. Battle did not consent to this.\n26. Mr. Battle's bag, which he had placed on the ground next to him, was searched by one of\nthe officers. Mr. Battle did not consent to this.\n27. As he was being patted down, Mr. Battle asked the police officers why they were\nsearching him. One officer said that it was routine. He pointed to a TRIP decal on the\ncar, which Mr. Battle had not previously noticed, and told Mr. Battle they were allowed to\nsearch him under TRIP.\n28. After searching Mr. Battle and his bag, the officers told him they were done with him.\n5\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 6 of 14\n29. Though free to go, Mr. Battle told the officers that he was upset at their treatment of him.\nThe officers replied that he had consented to being questioned and searched when he\nentered a livery car that participated in TRIP. They again stated that their actions were\npart of a routine stop under TRIP.\n30. The officers explained that these stops and searches were amethod of removing weapons\nand drugs from the street. Referring to the 81st Precinct, where the stop took place, one\nof the officers asked Mr. Battle, \"Do you know how many murders we have in the eight-\none?\"\n31. The 81st Precinct is known for controversial policing. In recently published recordings of\n1'011calls in the 81st Precinct, officers were routinely pressured to stop and frisk\nindividuals as often as possible, even if unlawfully. During one roll call, a sergeant in the\nSlst Precinct stated, \"Anybody walking around, shake them up, stop them, 250 them, no\nmatter what the explanation is.\" (The term \"250\" refers to the fonn completed by police\nofficers who conduct stops and frisks.)\n32. Aware of this controversy and believing he was the victim of an improper stop, Mr. Battle\nrequested the names ofthe police officers. They gave their names as Officer Facenda,\nOfficer Reyes, and Sergeant Miller.\n33. Mr. Battle was not charged with any crime. He had done nothing unlawful or suspicious\nbefore or during the encounter. The NYPD officers had no lawful reason to detain,\nquestion, frisk, or search him.\n34. After being detained and searched by the police officers, Mr. Battle felt fearful,\npowerless, and indignant. He knew that the officers mistreated him and had no right to do\nwhat they had done to him.\n6\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 7 of 14\n35. The following Monday, November 1,Mr. Battle filed complaints with the NYPD's\nInternal Affairs Bureau and the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board. Mr.\nBattle attended an interview with the Civilian Complaint Review Board on November 23,\n2010.\n36. On January 21,2011, Mr. Battle filed a timely Notice of Claim.\n37. At all times during the encounter with Mr. Battle, the police officers were acting under\ncolor oflaw.\n38. Because he often has no other choice, Mr. Battle continues to use livery cabs at night. He\nis anxious, however, when he is in a livery car because he fears that he may have another\nsimilar encounter with police officers.\nMunir Pujara\n39. Munir Pujara lives in Harlem. He is of South Asian descent and is 37 years old.\n40. Mr. Pujara is an attomey and works for Part ofthe Solution (POTS), a social service\norganization located in the northwest Bronx.\n41. Mr. Pujara regularly takes livery cars to travel between his Bronx office, the Bronx\ncourthouse, and his home in Harlem. Like Mr. Battle, Mr. Pujara often takes livery cars\nto return home from work late at night. He does this because yellow cabs are generally\nnot available and because he has at times tried to avoid the subway after having been\nstopped repeatedly atNYPD subway bag-search checkpoints because, he believes, of his\nethnicity.\n42. At approximately 11:30p.m. on Friday, September 3, 2010, Mr. Pujara left work in the\nBronx to return home and got into a livery car. After traveling only a Sh01idistance, the\ncar was pulled over by apolice car. Two officers stepped out of the vehicle.\n7\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 8 of 14\n43. A female officer, later identified as defendant Wende1yn Costanza, walked over to the\npassenger side. Meanwhile, amale officer, later identified as defendant Jeff Torreda,\napproached the driver of the car.\n44. Officer Torreda asked the driver if everything was alright. The driver responded that\neverything was fine.\n45. Officer Torreda then joined Officer Costanza at the passenger side of the car. One ofthe\nofficers opened Mr. Pujara's door and told him to get out ofthe car.\n46. Mr. Pujara was surprised at the officer's command. Mr. Pujara asked the officers if they\nhad any suspicion or cause to ask him to leave the car. They said they did not. He then\nasked what would happen ifhe did not leave the car. The officers told him he would be\narrested.\n47. Mr. Pujara stepped out of the car. He noticed that the Officer Torreda's hand was on his\ngun.\n48. The officers told Mr. Pujara to tum around, place his hands on the roof of the car, and\nspread his legs. Mr. Pujara told the officers that they were not allowed to search him\nwithout his consent. Officer Torreda replied that he could.\n49. Troubled by this exchange, Mr. Pujara repeated that the officers had no legal basis for\nsearching him. Officer Torreda insisted that he did because of \"the program,\" referring to\nTRIP.\n50. Mr. Pujara was familiar with TRIP because he had previously defended a client in the\ncontext of avehicle passenger search. He correctly told Officer Torreda that TRIP\nallowed them to stop the car only under some circumstances and that he could not be\n8\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 9 of 14\nsearched as apassenger without suspicion. The officer continued to disagree. He pointed\nto the TRIP decal on the livery car and said \"it shows it right there.\"\n51. Officer Torreda suddenly pushed Mr. Pujara and frisked his waist area and patted down\nand searched the front and back pockets of his pants. Mr. Pujara had not consented to be\nsearched.\n52. After the frisk, Mr. Pujara continued to dispute the lega1รฎty ofthe police officers' actions.\n53. Officer Torreda stated that police officers were doing these stop-and-frisks oflivery\npassengers and that it was part of \"the program.\" Officer Torreda said that officers would\ncontinue frisking passengers during TRIP stops, saying, in substance, \"We'll be doing\nthem more often.\"\n54. Finally, Mr. Pujara was allowed to walk away from the car, though the officers did not\nexpressly consent to it and he was fearful as he stepped away from them. As Mr. Pujara\nwas leaving the scene, the livery car began to drive away. Mr. Pujara stopped the car and\npaid the driver ten dollars.\n55. The officers did not find anything illegal on Mr. Pujara or charge him with any crime.\nAt no point before or during the encounter with the police officers did Mr. Pujara do\nanything unlawful or suspicious, and the NYPD officers had no lawful basis to detain,\nquestion, or frisk him.\n56. At all times during the encounter with Mr. Pujara, the police officers were acting under\ncolor oflaw.\n57. Mr. Pujara filed a complaint with the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board\nabout his encounter.\n58. On November 23, 2010, Mr. Pujara filed a timely Notice of Claim.\n9\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 10 of 14\n- 59. Because he has little choice, Mr. Pujura continues to use livery cars, but he is anxious\nwhen riding in them out of fear that he will have another similar encounter with the\npolice. For a while after the September incident, Mr. Pujura made an effort to avoid\nliveries with TRIP decals, but he abandoned this when livery drivers in cars without\ndecals told him that they too were being stopped for driver safety checks.\nTaxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program\n60. The Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP) was created by the NYPD in 1994.\nUpon information and belief, a large number oflivery cars enrolled in the program.\n61. In2009 the NYPD initiated Operation Safe Cab, which led to the enrollment in TRIP of\nhundreds of additional livery cars. On information and belief, virtually all of the vehicles\nenrolled in TRIP are livery cars.\n62. Livery cars are the main fonn of for-hire passenger car service in minority-populated\nneighborhoods in New York City. According to the Taxi & Limousine Commission, 97%\nof yellow taxi pickups are in Manhattan or at airports.\n63. Drivers participating in TRIP affix a decal to their cars stating, \"This vehicle may be\nstopped and visually inspected by the police at any time to ensure driver's safety.\" An\nNYPD operations order about TRIP provides that passengers may not be removed from\nvehicles absent independent factors causing the officers conducting the stop to fear for\ntheir safety. The operations order further states that passengers may not be frisked during\nstops absent reasonable suspicion of the existence of violent criminal activity or the\npossession of a weapon.\n10\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 11 of 14\n64. Nonetheless, the NYPD has a pattern and practice or custom of detaining, questioning,\nfrisking, and searching passengers in livery cars that participate in TRIP without any\nsuspicion of unlawful conduct by the passenger.\n65. NYPD officers stated to both Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara that itwas routine to detain,\nquestion, and search or frisk passengers riding in vehicles enrolled in TRIP. In both\ncases, the officers explicitly stated that they were authorized to search or frisk passengers\nmerely because they were riding in avehicle enrolled in TRIP. When their authority was\nquestioned, the police officers brought the TRIP decal to the attention ofthe plaintiffs.\nBoth sets of officers also described their actions as part of a larger crime-fighting strategy.\nOfficer Torreda told Mr. Pujara that stop-and-frisks of livery passengers were occurring\nand would continue to occur.\n66. Livery drivers of vehicles enrolled in the TRIP program report that police officers pull\nover their cars and detain, question, frisk, and search passengers, even after the drivers\ninform the police officers that there is nothing wrong in the car.\n67. The detention, questioning, frisking, and searching of law-abiding passengers in livery\ncars under the TRIP program closely resembles the treatment of pedestrians under the\nNYPD's program of aggressively stopping and frisking pedestrians. Since 2003 there\nhave been over 4 million such stops, with nearly 90% of those stopped being entirely\ninnocent. That program is also racially skewed, with over 80% of the stops being of\nAfrican-Americans and Latinos and only 10% being of whites.\n68. As evidenced by the statements and actions ofthe officers the plaintiffs encountered and\nby the reports oflivery cab drivers and others, the NYPD has failed to adequately train\nand supervise officers conducting stops under the TRIP program to ensure that they are\n11\n\nCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP   Document 19    Filed 07/21/11   Page 12 of 14\n\",\nnot violating the constitutional rights of passengers for whom no independent suspicion\nexists. The NYPD Patrol Guide, which contains policies and procedures for NYPD\nofficers, contains no guidelines governing the actions of officers conducting stops under\nTRIP.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n69.
